[00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:20.175]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:24.717]  Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen...
[00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:46.417]  Ladies and gentlemen, last night Joe Biden announced to the nation that you're all slaves to Big Pharma, said you cannot be free again until you consume Big Pharma's vaccine.
[00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:51.202]  And so, we've done something special for you here at InfoWars, and
[00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:55.273]  You know, a lot of people obviously were watching Biden's address.
[00:00:55.273 --> 00:00:57.834]  It was his biggest live audience yet, ever.
[00:00:57.834 --> 00:01:00.936]  It actually hit 10,000 people live on the internet.
[00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:03.036]  That's by far his biggest audience.
[00:01:03.036 --> 00:01:06.518]  Trump gets millions, but you know, he lost to Biden, supposedly.
[00:01:06.518 --> 00:01:15.582]  But we were able, so while everybody was listening to Biden talking, we were able to pull off some InfoWars magic.
[00:01:15.582 --> 00:01:20.904]  We actually had a microphone inside Joe Biden's head, in his mind.
[00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:28.449]  So, look, this is a family audience, so I have to warn you, you're about to go into Joe Biden's mind.
[00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:28.969]  Okay?
[00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.210]  This is not a place for children.
[00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.250]  Trust me.
[00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.491]  Although they end up in there a lot.
[00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:36.592]  I'll stop right there.
[00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:40.494]  So, we had a microphone inside Joe Biden's head last night.
[00:01:41.597 --> 00:01:42.537]  As he was speaking.
[00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:52.620]  So we're going to roll in live time, the Biden speech with his thoughts for the first time ever on live television and radio, the thoughts of a human recorded.
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.662]  And now we're going to play the video and in live time, play what Joe Biden was thinking.
[00:01:58.662 --> 00:02:01.522]  Let's go.
[00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:03.863]  Where am I?
[00:02:03.863 --> 00:02:06.064]  What am I doing here?
[00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:08.925]  What are all these other people doing here?
[00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:10.425]  These lights are hurting my eyes.
[00:02:11.658 --> 00:02:14.659]  Am I supposed to be reading off that thing right there?
[00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:15.620]  It's kind of far away.
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.941]  I'm having trouble seeing it.
[00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:19.961]  Whoa, who's that?
[00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:23.663]  Boy, she's got a nice rack, doesn't she?
[00:02:23.663 --> 00:02:26.724]  Do you think my wife would care if I hit on her?
[00:02:26.724 --> 00:02:29.965]  Do you think my wife would care if I sniffed her neck?
[00:02:29.965 --> 00:02:31.145]  I'd like to go a little further.
[00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:34.887]  Oh, it looks like there's a child over there, too.
[00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:36.467]  Whoa.
[00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:39.349]  Oh, what do you think that kid smells like?
[00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.509]  Oh, I can only imagine.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.322]  I remember the good old days when Barack was in office.
[00:02:45.322 --> 00:02:49.204]  They'd bring kiddos in there all the time for me to sniff and grope.
[00:02:49.204 --> 00:02:51.126]  Wait a second.
[00:02:51.126 --> 00:02:53.107]  Am I the president now?
[00:02:53.107 --> 00:02:54.808]  Oh my gosh.
[00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:56.609]  That's what happened.
[00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.330]  I'm the president now.
[00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.311]  Oh.
[00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:02.172]  I think I'm supposed to be giving a speech or something.
[00:03:02.172 --> 00:03:04.093]  Oh, that's right.
[00:03:04.093 --> 00:03:06.635]  I'm supposed to be reading that teleprompter.
[00:03:06.635 --> 00:03:07.736]  Oh boy.
[00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:09.076]  Don't look at the lady.
[00:03:09.076 --> 00:03:10.597]  Don't look at the lady.
[00:03:10.597 --> 00:03:11.438]  Look at the teleprompter.
[00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:13.973]  Look at the teleprompter.
[00:03:13.973 --> 00:03:14.934]  Read the teleprompter.
[00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:16.094]  Oh, boy.
[00:03:16.094 --> 00:03:18.514]  The eyes are wandering again.
[00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:19.074]  Oh, my gosh.
[00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:21.495]  I didn't even notice that girl over there.
[00:03:21.495 --> 00:03:24.075]  How old do you think she is?
[00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:26.396]  Do you think I'm too old for her?
[00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:29.837]  She looks like she's at least 18.
[00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:31.417]  Oh, that's right.
[00:03:31.417 --> 00:03:32.937]  Now I remember.
[00:03:32.937 --> 00:03:37.778]  I'm supposed to be telling Americans they can't be free again until they take the vaccine.
[00:03:37.778 --> 00:03:38.839]  Whew.
[00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:40.699]  Boy, it's a good thing I'm still up here talking.
[00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.691]  Otherwise, I would have blown it completely.
[00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:51.713]  Okay, now, to tell Americans they won't be free until they take the vaccine.
[00:03:51.713 --> 00:03:56.555]  Wow, journeys inside of Joe Biden's head, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:56.555 --> 00:03:58.936]  Not a place you want to be.
[00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:00.937]  Not a place you want to be, trust me.
[00:04:00.937 --> 00:04:01.517]  But you know what?
[00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:08.079]  We do have some news on what goes on in Biden's head and then what comes out as policy.
[00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:20.367]  Or what goes on behind closed doors where, you know, you didn't know, but big pharmaceutical companies and vaccine manufacturers are actually the president of the United States.
[00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:21.087]  But it's beyond that.
[00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:24.710]  They're actually the kings of the world.
[00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.834]  And so Joe Biden said, if you take your vaccines, then you can be free again.
[00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:34.837]  And they even use Independence Day
[00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:41.871]  As the fulcrum point to say, you can be free again, just like on Independence Day, but you gotta take your vaccine.
[00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:43.852]  Uh, no.
[00:04:43.852 --> 00:04:52.876]  No, I believe that we fought for independence and liberty, and that's what July 4th represents, not being forced to take a vaccine.
[00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:55.477]  How's it different?
[00:04:55.477 --> 00:04:59.219]  I get up in the morning, look at you, and say, where the hell are we?
[00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:01.961]  I sell supplements for two reasons.
[00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:02.701]  Because they work,
[00:05:03.331 --> 00:05:07.473]  They're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market.
[00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.974]  But again, why is there a giant market?
[00:05:09.974 --> 00:05:11.574]  Because it works.
[00:05:11.574 --> 00:05:13.555]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[00:05:13.555 --> 00:05:30.042]  So whether it's Saw Palmetto and other key ingredients in our prostate formula, Prostagard, or whether it is the super high-grade organic vitamin B12 in Ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA Force,
[00:05:31.005 --> 00:05:34.066]  Or the pure Deep Earth Crystal Iodine X2.
[00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:42.229]  These are all the very best supplements you're going to find in an already great market of high quality products out there.
[00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:43.909]  And it funds the InfoWars.
[00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.311]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're funding the InfoWars so you can't lose.
[00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:50.592]  InfoWars delivers in spades.
[00:05:50.592 --> 00:05:54.033]  Please visit InfoWarsStore.com and get the products today.
[00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:57.494]  And again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.251]  It's Friday, March 12th.
[00:06:23.251 --> 00:06:29.237]  The year is 2021 and we are living in spectacularly incredible times.
[00:06:29.237 --> 00:06:30.858]  Incredibly good things are happening.
[00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:37.604]  Incredibly horrible things are happening, but we know this humanity is awakening as evil rises.
[00:06:37.604 --> 00:06:40.487]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Friday edition.
[00:06:40.487 --> 00:06:41.948]  We've had an extremely successful
[00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.019]  We're good to go.
[00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:26.369]  Now speaking of Tucker Carlson, I'm going to hit a very important piece that he put out last night where the Pentagon is now coming after him.
[00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:30.590]  That's right, the military coming after a US citizen inside the US for their speech.
[00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.591]  That isn't just illegal.
[00:07:31.591 --> 00:07:32.671]  It isn't just dangerous.
[00:07:32.671 --> 00:07:36.873]  It's a bellwether of where we've actually come, not where we're going.
[00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.973]  And I'll cover that in a moment.
[00:07:38.973 --> 00:07:46.356]  Then we're also going to be playing some excerpts when Owen takes over of the disgusting speech given by Biden because he's been under such pressure for hiding
[00:07:47.359 --> 00:07:51.681]  Uh, for most of the last month and a half that he's been in office since they stole the election.
[00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:55.403]  And he came out last night and said, does it matter if you take vaccines?
[00:07:55.403 --> 00:07:58.225]  There's still things you're never going to be able to do.
[00:07:58.225 --> 00:08:00.546]  They're never taking their foot off your neck.
[00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:09.411]  And now we see Democrats, communists, socialists, believing they're part of the power structure, even though they're the ones losing their jobs and their future and the dollar's position in the world.
[00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:13.573]  They're running around cheerleading in LA and New York and Austin, Texas.
[00:08:14.321 --> 00:08:17.024]  Beating people up on the streets now that don't wear masks.
[00:08:17.024 --> 00:08:29.315]  So the mask Nazis are getting more intense, more aggressive, more out of control now as they see local governments and common sense starting to kick in and as they see state governments.
[00:08:29.315 --> 00:08:33.819]  So this has always been the perfect divide and conquer tactic.
[00:08:33.819 --> 00:08:38.643]  Now they're going to say, well, things never go back to normal until you're all vaccinated, even though they admit this vaccine doesn't protect you.
[00:08:42.432 --> 00:08:43.052]  We're good to go.
[00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:13.221]  Uh, or saying that white people aren't inherently bad is evil.
[00:09:13.221 --> 00:09:14.702]  This is officially taught everywhere now.
[00:09:14.702 --> 00:09:18.085]  This is the big globalist corporate move to create more divide and conquer.
[00:09:18.085 --> 00:09:21.127]  And so this guy is a nightmare pick for Secretary of Defense.
[00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:26.030]  Uh, and now they have announced they're going to have pregnant women in the second trimester.
[00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:33.796]  We're talking women three, four, five months pregnant, flying around in aircraft and flying, uh, munitions and troops in the combat zones.
[00:09:33.796 --> 00:09:34.837]  So first they want to get women
[00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:39.731]  Not taking care of their children and into factories to break up the family.
[00:09:39.731 --> 00:09:41.633]  Now it's going to be, let's get the babies up there.
[00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:46.775]  This is all just to sabotage the military ahead of total AI mechanized robot takeover.
[00:09:46.775 --> 00:09:50.858]  Because the silicon troops, the silicon robots, the silicon drones,
[00:09:52.253 --> 00:09:53.854]  Again, we'll be commanded by the technocracy.
[00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:56.575]  They're trying to get humans out of the decision-making process.
[00:09:56.575 --> 00:10:07.019]  And then if you think the technocracy is bad, they're already rolling out robots in New York, robots in Singapore, robots in Tokyo, robots in Tel Aviv, and freedom bracelets to make sure you're a good little slave.
[00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:09.140]  If you think that's all bad, this is just the beginning.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:18.644]  So, Tucker Carlson understands this, and you're not supposed to have the Pentagon and the military involved in domestic operations, politically.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.682]  But we know just historically how bad it is when other countries go this direction.
[00:10:27.682 --> 00:10:31.525]  So the Democrats are creating a rapid reaction force permanently for the Capitol.
[00:10:31.525 --> 00:10:33.846]  They're saying their main enemy is the American people.
[00:10:33.846 --> 00:10:48.234]  And now even the Pentagon come out in the media and release press releases attacking Tucker Carlson because as a citizen, he thinks it's wrong to try to have transgender surgeries in the military paid for by taxpayers.
[00:10:48.234 --> 00:10:51.876]  He thinks it's wrong to have pregnant women in combat zones.
[00:10:52.668 --> 00:10:55.713]  And again, that's his right to say that, whether he's right or wrong.
[00:10:55.713 --> 00:10:57.375]  He's obviously common sense right.
[00:10:57.375 --> 00:11:08.472]  But the Pentagon's trying to act like now, following Big Tech, following Congress, following mainstream media, that it's normal to try to shut somebody down, and normal to demonize him like he's the enemy.
[00:11:09.033 --> 00:11:18.539]  So Tucker Carlson, who I've known as a friend for over 10 years, has really transcended anybody else in modern media at his level to be able to put this type of information out.
[00:11:18.539 --> 00:11:26.383]  And I can tell you, almost the entire military, including women in the military, totally get this as a sabotaging of readiness and of the human force, the human military.
[00:11:26.383 --> 00:11:28.785]  So this is again about a post-human world they're building.
[00:11:28.785 --> 00:11:30.806]  It's about sabotaging the military.
[00:11:30.806 --> 00:11:32.707]  China doesn't have women in combat.
[00:11:32.707 --> 00:11:34.348]  China doesn't have pregnant women in the military.
[00:11:34.908 --> 00:11:36.009]  They know that.
[00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:41.531]  But again, their own propaganda systems that own Hollywood, much of the MSM, they're pushing that here.
[00:11:41.531 --> 00:11:57.658]  So this is the military that says it's going to be domestically involved in gun confiscation under General Honoré, and all the rest of them now really stepping into that role against their enemy, the American people, because for decades now at West Point and at the Army War College and areas, they have taught the officer corps
[00:12:08.867 --> 00:12:11.269]  Politicians have demanded it.
[00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:14.972]  Now if you dare to point any of this out, they become hysterical.
[00:12:14.972 --> 00:12:18.354]  And they become hysterical because they can't defend their own policies.
[00:12:18.354 --> 00:12:21.517]  When people can't defend what they've done, they yell.
[00:12:21.517 --> 00:12:25.540]  They can't even explain what those policies are, at least in public, so they attack.
[00:12:26.585 --> 00:12:33.648]  Your politicians like Tammy Duckworth say that it's unpatriotic to question the Pentagon unless you have served in the military yourself.
[00:12:33.648 --> 00:12:35.949]  You haven't earned that right.
[00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:37.110]  Really?
[00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.871]  Can only cops talk about police brutality?
[00:12:39.871 --> 00:12:44.693]  If you haven't been elected to office, are you allowed to criticize Congress?
[00:12:44.693 --> 00:12:46.273]  They're not making a real argument.
[00:12:46.273 --> 00:12:48.434]  They're trying to silence dissent.
[00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.395]  Not playing along.
[00:12:49.395 --> 00:12:49.635]  Sorry.
[00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:57.665]  Every American citizen has a right, maybe an obligation, to know what the military they pay for is doing.
[00:12:57.665 --> 00:13:00.147]  Because our lives may depend on it.
[00:13:00.147 --> 00:13:05.891]  Today, the Department of Defense launched a large and coordinated public relations offensive against the show.
[00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:08.413]  Pentagon brass issued hostile statements.
[00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:11.736]  People in uniforms sent out videos on social media.
[00:13:11.736 --> 00:13:15.959]  The DoD even issued a news release attacking us.
[00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:19.401]  Press Secretary smites Fox News host.
[00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:19.842]  Smites!
[00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.928]  Like we're a hostile foreign power.
[00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:25.370]  We suspect this is one war they might actually win.
[00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.032]  They've got a manpower advantage.
[00:13:28.032 --> 00:13:29.834]  We could play you a lot of tape from this today.
[00:13:29.834 --> 00:13:31.155]  It took up most of their day.
[00:13:31.155 --> 00:13:32.997]  And we could marvel over it.
[00:13:32.997 --> 00:13:38.041]  Since when does the Pentagon declare war on a domestic news operation?
[00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:40.183]  Can't remember that ever happening.
[00:13:40.183 --> 00:13:40.924]  But we're not going to do that.
[00:13:40.924 --> 00:13:42.165]  We're going to pass.
[00:13:42.165 --> 00:13:46.629]  Because this is bigger than a feud with some flack at the Pentagon.
[00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:48.230]  This is genuinely worrisome.
[00:13:48.954 --> 00:13:54.498]  The Department of Defense has never been more aggressively or openly political.
[00:13:54.498 --> 00:14:02.103]  Tonight, there are 2,500 American troops stationed in Afghanistan, and they remain there to prevent the fall of Kabul to extremists.
[00:14:02.103 --> 00:14:12.550]  At the same time, there are 5,000 troops in our own capital tonight, also as protection against extremists, meaning people who voted for the losing candidate in the last election.
[00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.593]  Judging by those numbers, the Pentagon is now twice as focused on controlling our own citizens
[00:14:18.254 --> 00:14:20.976]  As it is on controlling the Taliban.
[00:14:20.976 --> 00:14:26.580]  Meanwhile, as Lloyd Austin hyperventilates about white supremacy, there are real threats out there.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.382]  And the biggest ones continue to be ignored.
[00:14:29.382 --> 00:14:30.724]  Those threats are not Syria.
[00:14:30.724 --> 00:14:32.905]  They're not suburban Virginia.
[00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:35.187]  They're not domestic extremism, at least right now.
[00:14:36.124 --> 00:14:41.806]  The main threat that we face, and everyone who is honest knows this, is the government of China.
[00:14:41.806 --> 00:14:43.547]  China is ascendant.
[00:14:43.547 --> 00:14:45.767]  Their economy will soon outpace ours.
[00:14:45.767 --> 00:14:48.868]  China now has the largest navy on the planet.
[00:14:48.868 --> 00:14:50.189]  Why do they have that?
[00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:52.149]  Why did they feel the need to build it?
[00:14:52.149 --> 00:14:55.591]  Does that have potential consequences for us?
[00:14:55.591 --> 00:14:56.931]  Yes.
[00:14:56.931 --> 00:15:01.092]  If China moved against Taiwan, how exactly would we respond?
[00:15:01.092 --> 00:15:05.614]  More likely, if the Chinese decided to close international shipping lanes, it would cripple our economy.
[00:15:06.477 --> 00:15:11.178]  If they decide to shut down our internet, it would bring our life to a halt.
[00:15:11.178 --> 00:15:16.139]  If they decided to occupy Malaysia, that would be a grave concern to the world.
[00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:23.681]  If any of these things happen, or a hundred other things that might happen, what exactly would our Pentagon do about it?
[00:15:23.681 --> 00:15:24.341]  Can the U.S.
[00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:27.942]  military still win a real war?
[00:15:27.942 --> 00:15:29.602]  Those are the questions that matter.
[00:15:29.602 --> 00:15:32.643]  Those are the only questions that matter.
[00:15:32.643 --> 00:15:35.704]  Which may be why Joe Biden wants to talk about maternity flight suits.
[00:15:47.252 --> 00:15:52.495]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, when we come back, it's not only the Biden DOD that's out of control.
[00:15:52.495 --> 00:15:56.217]  You won't believe the latest move from his Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin.
[00:15:56.217 --> 00:15:57.098]  It's not good.
[00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.052]  The people are awakening.
[00:16:00.052 --> 00:16:02.774]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[00:16:02.774 --> 00:16:04.856]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[00:16:04.856 --> 00:16:07.198]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's hand-held.
[00:16:07.198 --> 00:16:20.990]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the chi-coms especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data.
[00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:24.934]  They can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[00:16:25.434 --> 00:16:32.137]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[00:16:32.137 --> 00:16:33.557]  In their own words, they admit it.
[00:16:33.557 --> 00:16:38.480]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.420]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.501]  They're Faraday cages.
[00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.201]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[00:16:43.201 --> 00:16:45.182]  They work absolutely great.
[00:16:45.182 --> 00:16:54.046]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.

[00:18:01.341 --> 00:18:03.965]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:28.078 --> 00:18:29.159]  Yeah!
[00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:30.440]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.842]  History in the making every day.
[00:18:33.842 --> 00:18:36.243]  The most censored news network in the world.
[00:18:36.243 --> 00:18:38.685]  Infowars.com.
[00:18:38.685 --> 00:18:39.886]  Owen Troyer sitting in for Alex.
[00:18:39.886 --> 00:18:43.768]  We'll be hearing again from Alex before the end of this transmission.
[00:18:43.768 --> 00:18:44.729]  It's been a crazy week here.
[00:18:45.598 --> 00:18:47.780]  And Alex has been a busy beaver down there in Florida.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.002]  It's going to be a lot of exciting announcements once he gets back.
[00:18:51.002 --> 00:18:55.126]  I've got a news desk here that is just overrun.
[00:18:55.126 --> 00:18:56.487]  I'm going to get to all of this news.
[00:18:56.487 --> 00:19:00.350]  We've got Nick Begich hosting the fourth hour.
[00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.691]  And if there's time, I may even take some phone calls.
[00:19:02.691 --> 00:19:06.494]  If not during this, I am back in the war room today, so we may take calls.
[00:19:06.494 --> 00:19:08.176]  Then I've also got some video clips.
[00:19:09.913 --> 00:19:11.875]  Of what's happening in Portland right now.
[00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:15.277]  Did you know Antifa has been rioting in Portland for months on end?
[00:19:15.277 --> 00:19:17.879]  Yeah, that's not an insurrection though.
[00:19:17.879 --> 00:19:20.181]  Mostly peaceful as buildings burn.
[00:19:20.181 --> 00:19:23.984]  They even lit a federal building on fire with people inside once again.
[00:19:23.984 --> 00:19:25.745]  War on the streets of Portland.
[00:19:25.745 --> 00:19:27.567]  Mainstream media not interested.
[00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:38.435]  And of course the real story is that the political class of this country, and you have to be honest though, Republicans are calling for the wall to be torn down.
[00:19:39.463 --> 00:19:46.229]  I'm not seeing Democrats complaining about the wall, except the one at the southern border, not the one in D.C.
[00:19:46.229 --> 00:19:52.675]  But see, oh, all of a sudden the Democrats are concerned about violence when it's in their backyard.
[00:19:52.675 --> 00:19:53.876]  See how that works?
[00:19:53.876 --> 00:19:57.179]  When it's in your backyard, they don't give a damn.
[00:19:57.179 --> 00:19:59.601]  They promote it and they bail out the criminals.
[00:20:00.481 --> 00:20:07.747]  But when it's in their backyard, all hands on deck, and in fact, we've got the numbers now of how much it's going to cost.
[00:20:07.747 --> 00:20:13.092]  Folks, when this whole escapade is done, it's going to cost a billion dollars.
[00:20:13.092 --> 00:20:13.973]  A billion.
[00:20:13.973 --> 00:20:24.142]  They're estimating, if the National Guard, under the current pretenses, is removed in May, which is what they're saying, the final bill
[00:20:25.413 --> 00:20:37.516]  For the Democrat criminal protection, for the politician criminal protection, for Congress's criminal protection, is going to be $521 million.
[00:20:37.516 --> 00:20:44.958]  That's on top of the COVID scam that they just, the COVID stimulus scam, that they just signed enriching themselves, bailing themselves out.
[00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:47.298]  Incredible.
[00:20:47.298 --> 00:20:49.399]  We've got vaccine news today.
[00:20:50.572 --> 00:21:04.299]  I've got news from the Biden administration that you're not even going to believe, including we're now figuring out what's happening with the National Guard and the Biden administration.
[00:21:04.299 --> 00:21:07.160]  You've got Pelosi announcing that they'll steal any election they want?
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.041]  Yeah, I mean, literally, that's how bold they are now.
[00:21:09.673 --> 00:21:10.494]  We'll be covering that.
[00:21:10.494 --> 00:21:19.099]  We'll be covering the Biden administration members and how each one of them comes in with a real dark cloud over their head.
[00:21:19.099 --> 00:21:21.361]  But you notice the mainstream media doesn't make a big deal of it.
[00:21:21.361 --> 00:21:24.243]  You notice that you don't have the protests in D.C.
[00:21:24.243 --> 00:21:27.125]  I guess that's because the criminals have their criminal protection now.
[00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:32.669]  But remember when it was Kavanaugh or Coney Barrett or you name the Trump administration appointee.
[00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:34.050]  Oh, the protests were rampant.
[00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.070]  The media was all over it.
[00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.452]  They were getting inside the rooms, causing chaos.
[00:21:37.452 --> 00:21:38.012]  No arrest.
[00:21:38.012 --> 00:21:38.833]  All charges dropped.
[00:21:42.253 --> 00:21:49.719]  But boy oh boy, you look at these Biden appointees and it is bad.
[00:21:49.719 --> 00:21:50.480]  It is not good.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.260]  So we'll be covering that.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:57.725]  But of course, Biden last night, Biden last night gives his first live address.
[00:21:57.725 --> 00:22:03.230]  Now, I could open up the phone lines and ask, do you believe that Joe Biden was actually live last night?
[00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.612]  And 50% of the people would probably not believe it.
[00:22:05.612 --> 00:22:05.752]  So,
[00:22:06.872 --> 00:22:08.073]  I'm not saying he wasn't live.
[00:22:08.073 --> 00:22:13.117]  The point is, if you go look at all the videos of Biden's speech on YouTube and everything.
[00:22:13.117 --> 00:22:16.480]  And guys, by the way, pull up the CNBC one.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.102]  Because nobody else showed this except CNBC.
[00:22:19.102 --> 00:22:24.467]  After Biden concludes his 20 minute address, which was his longest address yet.
[00:22:24.467 --> 00:22:25.868]  We tell the truth here at Infowars.
[00:22:25.868 --> 00:22:29.251]  20 minutes, Biden's longest address yet since he's been installed in the White House.
[00:22:29.987 --> 00:22:38.412]  And it was his largest live audience, by my numbers, it did cap, it did go just over 10,000 people live.
[00:22:38.412 --> 00:22:41.934]  Normally Biden gets about 400-600 people, maybe 800 tops.
[00:22:41.934 --> 00:22:44.936]  He got about 10,000 live last night, so that was a new high for him.
[00:22:46.201 --> 00:22:49.024]  Of course, Trump gets half a million live, but that's neither here nor there.
[00:22:49.024 --> 00:22:51.646]  Biden beat him, don't you know, with 81 million votes.
[00:22:51.646 --> 00:23:01.615]  But at the end of this video, guys, the reason why I told you to pull up this one, at the end of this, no other news outlet showed this, and I wanted to see this because I saw it live, but then I could not find it on the internet.
[00:23:01.615 --> 00:23:06.319]  At the end, Biden, when he walks away, you can tell how weak this guy is.
[00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:13.085]  You can tell how... He has to look down at the ground while he walks away because he's afraid he's going to fall.
[00:23:14.708 --> 00:23:24.414]  And so he's shuffling along and he has to stare down at the ground and his feet while he's walking because he's afraid he's going to fall.
[00:23:24.414 --> 00:23:28.596]  And so, oh my gosh, no, they couldn't have edited it.
[00:23:28.596 --> 00:23:30.497]  There's no way they've edited this in the last hour.
[00:23:30.497 --> 00:23:32.678]  So the video is out there, but that's what I'm saying.
[00:23:32.678 --> 00:23:37.641]  Every other, there was only one video of like the six or seven that have the whole speech up there.
[00:23:37.641 --> 00:23:38.642]  I thought it was a CNBC.
[00:23:41.832 --> 00:23:44.953]  I don't know how they could have edited this in the last, like, hour since I watched it.
[00:23:44.953 --> 00:23:45.993]  But that's what I'm saying.
[00:23:45.993 --> 00:23:50.034]  Everyone else cut away, but while Biden's walking away, everyone else cuts away.
[00:23:50.034 --> 00:23:56.876]  While Biden's walking away, you can see he's stumbling, he can barely walk, he's looking down at his feet, he's afraid he's going to fall.
[00:23:56.876 --> 00:23:59.497]  That was probably the hardest thing he's done in a long time.
[00:23:59.497 --> 00:24:03.538]  A 20-minute speech, and then a 30-foot walk.
[00:24:03.538 --> 00:24:05.599]  But here's the real story.
[00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:10.540]  Biden, in his speech, announces to you, the American people, you are a slave to Big Pharma.
[00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:17.733]  Biden announces last night for the whole world to see that America is no longer a free country.
[00:24:17.733 --> 00:24:19.934]  You are no longer an independent citizen.
[00:24:19.934 --> 00:24:21.834]  You are no longer a sovereign citizen.
[00:24:21.834 --> 00:24:24.356]  And you can only be free if you take your vaccine.
[00:24:24.356 --> 00:24:24.976]  That's what he said.
[00:24:24.976 --> 00:24:30.718]  And he said, we will have a vaccine for every American's arm.
[00:24:30.718 --> 00:24:38.002]  And if every American is vaccinated by July 4th, hopefully you can have family and friends over for a cookout and a barbecue.
[00:24:38.002 --> 00:24:38.982]  Hey, here's an idea.
[00:24:38.982 --> 00:24:40.383]  Kiss my ass, Commie.
[00:24:44.266 --> 00:24:50.612]  Remember last 4th of July, how they tried to shut 4th of July down and close it and say no because of the pandemic, and it was the biggest 4th of July?
[00:24:50.612 --> 00:24:59.339]  You saw the fireworks all around Los Angeles, like everybody, lighting off fireworks.
[00:24:59.339 --> 00:25:11.050]  Out on Lake Travis here in Austin, it was like so busy and filled with boat traffic you could barely even move.
[00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:11.210]  So,
[00:25:12.481 --> 00:25:16.285]  Joe Biden let you know last night, you no longer live in a free country.
[00:25:16.285 --> 00:25:18.387]  You no longer live in the United States of America.
[00:25:18.387 --> 00:25:23.612]  You are now a big pharmaceutical slave.
[00:25:23.612 --> 00:25:24.332]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:25:24.332 --> 00:25:29.718]  Oh, because Independence Day isn't about free men, free women.
[00:25:29.718 --> 00:25:37.405]  Independence Day, July 4th, isn't about declaring your independence from corrupt entities, from corrupt overlords, from kings and queens and
[00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.051]  Oligarchs and corporations.
[00:25:41.051 --> 00:25:42.412]  No, no, no, no.
[00:25:42.412 --> 00:25:45.813]  Now July 4th is all about bowing to the corporations.
[00:25:45.813 --> 00:25:49.355]  Now July 4th is all about bowing to Big Pharmaceutical.
[00:25:49.355 --> 00:25:51.416]  Bowing to the kingmakers.
[00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:53.437]  And Biden let you know that last night.
[00:25:53.437 --> 00:25:55.898]  You want to celebrate 4th of July?
[00:25:55.898 --> 00:25:57.279]  You want to be a free citizen?
[00:25:57.279 --> 00:26:00.161]  You better take that vaccine.
[00:26:00.161 --> 00:26:00.661]  That's right.
[00:26:00.661 --> 00:26:01.581]  You want to have a cookout?
[00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:03.642]  You want to have barbecue?
[00:26:03.642 --> 00:26:04.683]  Take that vaccine.
[00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:07.629]  You want to have hot dogs with Barack Obama?
[00:26:07.629 --> 00:26:09.090]  You better take that vaccine!
[00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.010]  You probably don't want to do that, by the way.
[00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.951]  That I would avoid.
[00:26:14.951 --> 00:26:17.532]  But so the big announcement last night from Biden!
[00:26:17.532 --> 00:26:18.592]  The big announcement!
[00:26:18.592 --> 00:26:21.232]  You are all slaves!
[00:26:21.232 --> 00:26:23.833]  You are not free!
[00:26:23.833 --> 00:26:26.393]  No, you cannot move about the country freely!
[00:26:26.393 --> 00:26:28.774]  No, you cannot have family and friends over!
[00:26:28.774 --> 00:26:29.994]  No!
[00:26:29.994 --> 00:26:33.975]  No, you cannot celebrate Independence Day, because you're not independent!
[00:26:34.645 --> 00:26:38.587]  That is until you take our vaccine.
[00:26:38.587 --> 00:26:43.510]  Which is not even a vaccine, it's experimental gene therapy biotechnology.
[00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:50.154]  Which is gonna kill probably about 1% of the people that take it, but I don't care because they're doing a worldwide experiment on humanity.
[00:26:50.154 --> 00:26:51.595]  You thought you were free?
[00:26:51.595 --> 00:26:53.856]  Well I'm here to remind you, you're not!
[00:26:53.856 --> 00:26:57.919]  You're a slave to big pharma medical tyranny!
[00:26:57.919 --> 00:27:03.462]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[00:27:04.864 --> 00:27:09.506]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[00:27:09.506 --> 00:27:14.568]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[00:27:14.568 --> 00:27:19.650]  They will do whatever they are told, as if obedience is a virtue.
[00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.912]  It is the patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[00:27:25.306 --> 00:27:35.414]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:27:35.414 --> 00:27:39.057]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:45.542]  That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[00:27:45.542 --> 00:27:51.086]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:52.507]  So help me God.
[00:27:52.507 --> 00:27:53.267]  Infowars.com
[00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:02.211]  Humanity has been domesticated, by and large.
[00:28:02.211 --> 00:28:06.773]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all gonna pass.
[00:28:06.773 --> 00:28:15.977]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[00:28:15.977 --> 00:28:20.099]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[00:28:20.419 --> 00:28:37.951]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:54.383]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[00:28:54.383 --> 00:28:58.405]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[00:28:58.405 --> 00:29:01.828]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[00:29:02.412 --> 00:29:05.416]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[00:29:05.416 --> 00:29:08.040]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.044]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[00:29:11.044 --> 00:29:14.668]  That's why Jesus said, My people perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:29:14.668 --> 00:29:16.952]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies.
[00:29:17.592 --> 00:29:23.857]  Are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[00:29:23.857 --> 00:29:27.000]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.121]  Because it's so simple.
[00:29:28.121 --> 00:29:30.103]  Because you won't be under their control anymore.
[00:29:30.103 --> 00:29:38.990]  Well, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the highest quality Vitamin Mineral Fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form, is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.312]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[00:29:41.312 --> 00:29:44.454]  It funds the InfoWare at the same time.
[00:29:44.454 --> 00:29:46.316]  No other product you can buy does that.
[00:29:46.496 --> 00:29:47.957]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[00:29:47.957 --> 00:29:48.898]  It's very bittersweet.
[00:29:48.898 --> 00:29:52.880]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have a lot of credibility.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.341]  But I don't care about that.
[00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:55.582]  I care about beating the new world order.
[00:30:09.617 --> 00:30:14.323]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[00:30:14.323 --> 00:30:17.668]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[00:30:17.668 --> 00:30:19.190]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.392]  But let's just say this.
[00:30:20.392 --> 00:30:21.693]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[00:30:21.693 --> 00:30:24.177]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[00:30:24.797 --> 00:30:28.419]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[00:30:28.419 --> 00:30:31.000]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.181]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[00:30:34.181 --> 00:30:35.041]  Do they fund freedom?
[00:30:35.041 --> 00:30:36.162]  No, a lot of them don't.
[00:30:36.162 --> 00:30:42.604]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[00:30:42.604 --> 00:30:44.325]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[00:30:44.325 --> 00:30:47.166]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[00:30:47.726 --> 00:30:50.848]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[00:30:50.848 --> 00:31:00.816]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air, and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[00:31:00.816 --> 00:31:05.179]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:05.179 --> 00:31:10.103]  We've got it.
[00:31:10.103 --> 00:31:15.687]  The transmission is coming to you.
[00:31:18.375 --> 00:31:26.762]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:40.412]  That basically developed the theory of gravity, as we know, and so much more.
[00:31:40.412 --> 00:31:50.137]  And he postulated, it's been proven to be very accurate across the scientific studies of every field, that for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[00:31:50.137 --> 00:31:51.097]  And we're seeing that right now.
[00:31:51.097 --> 00:32:00.662]  So as bad as Joe Biden and the globalists and shycoms are, stealing the election, that is making people dig their heels in and is causing what they call a counter-revolution against it.
[00:32:00.662 --> 00:32:02.783]  And it is absolutely massive.
[00:32:02.783 --> 00:32:05.625]  I ran into here in Sarasota, Florida, where I'm at today.
[00:32:06.314 --> 00:32:20.180]  Yesterday, an amazing Irish-American who had come here in the 1990s with nothing but $700 in his pocket with his wife and children back in Ireland because he couldn't make a living there.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:23.301]  And now today, he owns a very successful business.
[00:32:24.216 --> 00:32:28.117]  Uh, that let's just say is, is, is a great service to people.
[00:32:28.117 --> 00:32:30.138]  Uh, and it's very, very exciting as well.
[00:32:30.138 --> 00:32:31.158]  And he just loves life.
[00:32:31.158 --> 00:32:31.838]  He's so free.
[00:32:31.838 --> 00:32:33.358]  And he said, this is the American dream.
[00:32:33.358 --> 00:32:40.760]  And he had tears in his eyes talking about how they're trying to destroy that and how the globals want to sew up the entire economy and destroy it.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:46.662]  So the next couple minutes we have, I guess four minutes or so, I want to just reach out to everybody.
[00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:52.534]  Watching and let you realize, don't let the enemy get you depressed about what's happening today.
[00:32:52.534 --> 00:33:04.844]  As long as you're speaking up, as long as you're standing up, as long as you're saying no to the globalists, as long as you're living and loving your neighbors and being a good person, you're building the human community that is the American dream, that is the renaissance.
[00:33:04.844 --> 00:33:16.432]  And this Irishman, who's now an American, I also got a chance to meet his son, who partners with him in his company, both his sons, but I met one of his sons, that, again, do some amazing stuff.
[00:33:16.432 --> 00:33:17.013]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:33:18.664 --> 00:33:21.707]  He said, listen, you don't get Joe Biden's name right.
[00:33:21.707 --> 00:33:23.028]  He's a stooge.
[00:33:23.028 --> 00:33:24.209]  And I said, wow, you're right.
[00:33:24.209 --> 00:33:31.294]  A stooge is a puppet put in by somebody else who's an idiot, but who's also used to rule over people.
[00:33:31.294 --> 00:33:37.019]  So the stooge gets the blame and the actual controllers don't get the blame for the crimes they're committing.
[00:33:37.019 --> 00:33:38.420]  And he said, that's exactly right.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.761]  He is a puppet.
[00:33:39.761 --> 00:33:41.142]  He is an imposter.
[00:33:41.142 --> 00:33:41.803]  He is a fraud.
[00:33:41.803 --> 00:33:44.385]  So everybody should look at the different definitions of stooges.
[00:33:45.571 --> 00:33:47.733]  And understand what that is.
[00:33:47.733 --> 00:33:49.013]  That's what he is.
[00:33:49.013 --> 00:33:51.735]  You know, the Dune books by Frank Herbert are amazing.
[00:33:51.735 --> 00:33:57.839]  The movie by Lynch was powerful, but also cheesy in parts.
[00:33:57.839 --> 00:34:07.165]  But it's accurate as a historical fiction reference to some of the things that have actually happened in the real world.
[00:34:07.165 --> 00:34:12.408]  And if you notice, Baron Harkonnen is supposedly losing control of the planet Arrakis with a spice.
[00:34:13.234 --> 00:34:18.996]  Which is basically why this is in technology, the ethos of the globalist, eternal life.
[00:34:18.996 --> 00:34:25.098]  But really they're just setting up the main rival of the emperor, Duke Atreides.
[00:34:25.098 --> 00:34:39.264]  But before, after he set up Atreides and his son's been thrown out in the desert and all the rest of it, he sends in the Beast Rabban, his nephew, to squeeze and attack and destroy all his opposition.
[00:34:39.264 --> 00:34:42.385]  But then he removes him later, gives him the blame,
[00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:46.833]  And that's what you do with a stooge who you put in as a viceroy or a vice king.
[00:35:08.101 --> 00:35:12.663]  And the Romans would do this, the British Empire would do this, the French would do this.
[00:35:12.663 --> 00:35:19.186]  It's in the history books that they would come in and oppress a group, take them over, put in somebody to be unpopular, to squeeze and be a tyrant.
[00:35:19.186 --> 00:35:35.353]  Then their own publications and own heralds would demonize that person, remove them, sometimes chop their head off, and then bring in the new tyrant who would loosen up some of the controls, but not as much as it was before they invaded.
[00:35:35.353 --> 00:35:36.714]  So again, you tighten down,
[00:35:37.765 --> 00:35:40.406]  Then you loosen up, but not as much as you did before.
[00:35:40.406 --> 00:35:43.226]  And that's where a stooge comes in.
[00:35:43.226 --> 00:35:45.747]  And that's really what Joe Biden is.
[00:35:45.747 --> 00:35:47.488]  Joe Biden is a stooge.
[00:35:47.488 --> 00:35:48.608]  Joe Biden is a puppet.
[00:35:48.608 --> 00:35:50.688]  We should all start calling him Joe Biden's stooge.
[00:35:50.688 --> 00:35:53.409]  So that said, they're going to, they brought him in.
[00:35:53.409 --> 00:35:58.891]  They're going to blame him for all the collapse of the economy, for the, for the open borders, for all the mismanagement.
[00:35:58.891 --> 00:36:00.551]  And then whether it's Kamala Harris or whoever next.
[00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:02.950]  They will then be set up as the savior.
[00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:04.912]  But I think Kamala will be stooge number two.
[00:36:04.912 --> 00:36:09.595]  I mean, this is real Imperium Machiavelli nasty stuff we're going under.
[00:36:09.595 --> 00:36:11.136]  Non-American style government.
[00:36:11.136 --> 00:36:14.478]  This is really very, very corrupt government.
[00:36:14.478 --> 00:36:16.820]  But again, in closing, I'm just going to say this.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:25.365]  We can't stay on air and fight this stooge and fight these globalists while the public's mind is more fertile to be awoken than ever without your support.
[00:36:25.365 --> 00:36:27.767]  That's why I salute you and I thank you for your support.
[00:36:27.767 --> 00:36:29.368]  And I encourage you to go to info or store.
[00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:31.515]  We're good to go!
[00:36:47.353 --> 00:36:48.794]  Until next week.
[00:36:48.794 --> 00:36:50.094]  But it's months until we get more.
[00:36:50.094 --> 00:36:53.856]  It's going to go back to 25% off next Tuesday or so.
[00:36:53.856 --> 00:36:57.318]  Just because we need the funding to fund ourselves in the 50% off.
[00:36:57.318 --> 00:36:58.019]  We've done the math.
[00:36:58.019 --> 00:36:59.219]  It's not really the funding we need.
[00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:02.661]  If we could keep it coming in at 50% off and keep selling it, we would do that.
[00:37:02.661 --> 00:37:11.766]  But because we can't get enough of it, because of breakdowns in the economy and all the rest of it, and because our quality standards are so high, then I'm going to go ahead and go 25% off starting next week.
[00:37:11.766 --> 00:37:13.667]  Still free shipping store wide.
[00:37:13.667 --> 00:37:16.008]  We also have down and out, which is the liquid rocket rest.
[00:37:17.015 --> 00:37:22.798]  Huge, high quality doses of things that make you sleep deeply, calmly, restfully.
[00:37:22.798 --> 00:37:23.678]  It really is strong.
[00:37:23.678 --> 00:37:25.519]  It will help you down and out in a good way.
[00:37:25.519 --> 00:37:30.041]  It's the liquid form based on the same formula as Rocket Rest that sold out.
[00:37:30.041 --> 00:37:31.202]  It's coming in soon.
[00:37:31.202 --> 00:37:32.082]  But this is even stronger.
[00:37:32.082 --> 00:37:33.183]  This liquid is even stronger.
[00:37:33.183 --> 00:37:33.923]  You take it under the tongue.
[00:37:33.923 --> 00:37:35.744]  It goes right into the bloodstream.
[00:37:35.744 --> 00:37:37.105]  Four milligrams of melatonin.
[00:37:37.105 --> 00:37:39.286]  It's just L-Tryptophan, valerian root.
[00:37:39.286 --> 00:37:40.646]  It just goes on from there.
[00:37:40.646 --> 00:37:41.507]  That is in stock, 50% off.
[00:37:43.149 --> 00:37:46.910]  We have the Faraday Cages, Privacy Pouches, those are back in stock.
[00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:48.531]  Those are massively discounted.
[00:37:48.531 --> 00:37:51.111]  X2 is selling out very soon, 50% off.
[00:37:51.111 --> 00:37:54.152]  And Ultra 12, we've still got a lot of them, but it's going to sell in about a month.
[00:37:54.152 --> 00:37:58.093]  Highest quality 9V12, that is also 50% off.
[00:37:58.093 --> 00:37:59.053]  Implemorestore.com.
[00:37:59.053 --> 00:37:59.754]  And it will end.
[00:37:59.754 --> 00:38:02.634]  I extended it one week because I've been on the road and still busy.
[00:38:02.634 --> 00:38:04.135]  I've been putting new specials.
[00:38:04.135 --> 00:38:08.156]  We will have the sales until this Sunday or so.
[00:38:09.045 --> 00:38:09.205]  I think?
[00:38:39.105 --> 00:38:40.146]  Well, you still can.
[00:38:40.146 --> 00:38:42.688]  Thank you for your support.
[00:38:42.688 --> 00:38:45.811]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got just a minute or so left here.
[00:38:45.811 --> 00:38:47.152]  I want to play again.
[00:38:47.152 --> 00:38:49.394]  Guys, let's have clip seven ready.
[00:38:49.394 --> 00:38:59.742]  This is Mao Zedong, Chairman Joe, telling you, the American people, supposedly a free people, that you are not free.
[00:38:59.742 --> 00:39:04.346]  But if you take your vaccine, then maybe you can celebrate the Fourth of July.
[00:39:06.741 --> 00:39:09.163]  I need every American to do their part.
[00:39:09.163 --> 00:39:10.263]  How creepy is this?
[00:39:10.263 --> 00:39:11.404]  That's not hyperbole.
[00:39:11.404 --> 00:39:12.965]  I need you.
[00:39:12.965 --> 00:39:16.947]  I need you to get vaccinated when it's your turn and when you can find an opportunity.
[00:39:16.947 --> 00:39:18.108]  When it's your turn, yeah.
[00:39:18.108 --> 00:39:23.211]  And to help your family, your friends, your neighbors get vaccinated as well.
[00:39:23.211 --> 00:39:25.953]  Because here's the point.
[00:39:25.953 --> 00:39:32.457]  If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there's a good chance you
[00:39:35.228 --> 00:39:44.293]  Your families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day.
[00:39:44.293 --> 00:39:53.878]  That doesn't mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together after this long, hard year.
[00:39:53.878 --> 00:39:58.500]  That will make this Independence Day something truly special.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.441]  Oh, I'm sure you will.
[00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:07.603]  Where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.
[00:40:07.603 --> 00:40:09.645]  Yes, because that's up to you and Fauci.
[00:40:09.645 --> 00:40:14.148]  But to get there, we can't let our guard down.
[00:40:14.148 --> 00:40:16.410]  This fight is far from over.
[00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:20.493]  As I told the woman in Pennsylvania, I'll tell you the truth.
[00:40:20.493 --> 00:40:25.656]  On July 4th, with your loved ones, is the goal.
[00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:27.698]  But a goal, a lot can happen.
[00:40:29.105 --> 00:40:35.567]  Yeah, this is like the old, this is like the old rodeo.
[00:40:35.567 --> 00:40:38.148]  Or, um, the old bullfighting.
[00:40:38.148 --> 00:40:44.550]  Joe Biden waving the red carpet, waving the red towel, waving the red linen.
[00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:52.052]  Oh, July 4th, July 4th, the bull comes charging, lifts the veil, stabs you in the back.
[00:40:52.052 --> 00:40:52.733]  That's what this is.
[00:40:52.733 --> 00:40:53.933]  But oh, Joe, thank you.
[00:40:53.933 --> 00:40:55.334]  I can be free on July 4th.
[00:40:55.334 --> 00:40:56.214]  Oh, thank you so much.
[00:40:56.214 --> 00:40:56.574]  Oh, my God.
[00:40:57.213 --> 00:41:01.157]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[00:41:01.157 --> 00:41:03.779]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[00:41:03.779 --> 00:41:04.540]  Why do you do that?
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.482]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[00:41:07.482 --> 00:41:09.504]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:19.097]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[00:41:19.097 --> 00:41:19.337]  Boom!
[00:41:19.337 --> 00:41:19.738]  We did it.
[00:41:19.738 --> 00:41:20.999]  It's popular at Sex3.
[00:41:20.999 --> 00:41:22.240]  Is it better than X2?
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:22.880]  You decide.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.361]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[00:41:24.361 --> 00:41:28.505]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular Powdered Pill
[00:41:29.385 --> 00:41:31.547]  Sleep Aid, and that is down and out.
[00:41:31.547 --> 00:41:36.251]  It's super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other.
[00:41:36.251 --> 00:41:43.436]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off, out of the gates, at InfoWareStore.com and free shipping.
[00:41:43.436 --> 00:41:47.840]  Secure your down and out today, and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the InfoWare at the same time.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.823]  Down and out, exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com for 40% off and free shipping.
[00:41:57.526 --> 00:42:01.275]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[00:42:01.275 --> 00:42:05.004]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[00:42:05.004 --> 00:42:07.590]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[00:42:08.257 --> 00:42:12.621]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[00:42:12.621 --> 00:42:18.386]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[00:42:18.386 --> 00:42:29.996]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[00:42:30.596 --> 00:42:32.737]  I need your help more than ever now.
[00:42:32.737 --> 00:42:36.839]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[00:42:36.839 --> 00:42:47.465]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:42:47.465 --> 00:42:56.990]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.650]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:59.503 --> 00:43:03.024]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[00:43:03.024 --> 00:43:10.067]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought down to nothing.
[00:43:10.067 --> 00:43:15.049]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team.
[00:43:15.049 --> 00:43:18.030]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:25.273]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[00:43:25.273 --> 00:43:27.294]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[00:43:28.063 --> 00:43:30.425]  The enemy can't help itself.
[00:43:30.425 --> 00:43:34.468]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:43:34.468 --> 00:43:48.679]  We sit here as good people and get upset about that and try to stop it, and we should, but once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[00:43:49.915 --> 00:43:52.077]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[00:43:52.077 --> 00:43:55.679]  You're going under judgment, just like all the children that were aborted.
[00:43:55.679 --> 00:43:57.340]  This is the truth.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:01.583]  This is the Infowar.
[00:44:01.583 --> 00:44:07.286]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[00:44:07.286 --> 00:44:14.151]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.792]  With or without a battery.
[00:44:16.557 --> 00:44:22.659]  Now, with the Infowars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:23.519]  Excellent.
[00:44:23.519 --> 00:44:29.101]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[00:44:29.101 --> 00:44:32.142]  And you can too, at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:44:33.722 --> 00:44:44.490]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:49.413]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[00:44:49.413 --> 00:44:55.317]  Support the InfoWar and get your InfoWars privacy pouch today.
[00:44:55.317 --> 00:44:56.398]  InfoWarStore.com
[00:45:01.824 --> 00:45:04.448]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:45:26.721 --> 00:45:34.284]  Owen Troyer in studio for Alex Jones in the Infowars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[00:45:34.284 --> 00:45:45.108]  You just heard Chairman Joe Biden, uh, here, tyrannical leader Joe Biden, telling you, maybe you can be free again, maybe.
[00:45:45.108 --> 00:45:49.450]  Maybe you can have a small gathering with family, friends, and loved ones because this isn't a free country.
[00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:49.670]  I need you.
[00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:52.531]  I need... Yeah, he needs me, alright.
[00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:54.112]  He needs me to be a good little slave.
[00:45:55.126 --> 00:46:00.830]  He needs me to take that vaccine, which they say doesn't stop the spread.
[00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:03.632]  Although now they're saying, oh, it's proven to stop the spread.
[00:46:03.632 --> 00:46:07.895]  But they're admitting there's these new variants, these new strains.
[00:46:07.895 --> 00:46:11.498]  So they really don't know what is going on.
[00:46:11.498 --> 00:46:14.861]  So I've got news coming out of the Biden administration.
[00:46:14.861 --> 00:46:17.102]  I want to get to that, but.
[00:46:17.102 --> 00:46:21.265]  I feel like I should get to the vaccine news here first now.
[00:46:21.265 --> 00:46:22.126]  So you just heard Joe.
[00:46:23.653 --> 00:46:33.435]  Just as InfoWars told you a year ago today, they're never going to lift any of these restrictions until they can force you to take a vaccine.
[00:46:33.435 --> 00:46:35.696]  And so that's what Joe Biden just admitted.
[00:46:35.696 --> 00:46:44.538]  Now when InfoWars says that a year ago on these airwaves, nobody wants to blink an eye.
[00:46:44.538 --> 00:46:48.519]  But then when Joe Biden says it a year later from the White House,
[00:46:51.132 --> 00:46:52.692]  Well maybe now you'll believe.
[00:46:52.692 --> 00:46:53.773]  Maybe now you'll get it.
[00:46:53.773 --> 00:46:55.033]  Maybe now you'll understand.
[00:46:55.033 --> 00:46:56.733]  This is a cult.
[00:46:56.733 --> 00:46:58.254]  This is a satanic cult.
[00:46:58.254 --> 00:46:59.194]  You must enter it.
[00:46:59.194 --> 00:47:00.414]  This is their ritual.
[00:47:00.414 --> 00:47:02.615]  They're telling you.
[00:47:02.615 --> 00:47:17.098]  And the fact that the average American would even consider going along with this shows how ignorant and brainwashed and just in general domesticated we've become.
[00:47:19.457 --> 00:47:25.440]  That we have to have some old, doddering fool, who we found the video of him shuffling away.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:34.565]  It's an early sign if you're suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's that you just shuffle, you look down because you're not sure you can walk without falling down.
[00:47:34.565 --> 00:47:38.146]  You need to see the ground, you need to see your feet shuffling.
[00:47:38.146 --> 00:47:41.248]  But you already know about Biden's health, so it's not even about that.
[00:47:43.186 --> 00:47:53.335]  They're now telling you, if you haven't seen it enough, if you haven't heard it enough, if you haven't seen the Freedom Pass in Israel and everywhere else, they're telling you, you want to be free again?
[00:47:53.335 --> 00:48:00.502]  You consume the big pharmaceutical vaccine that's never been tested, a brand new technology.
[00:48:00.502 --> 00:48:02.644]  Yeah, there's the mentally decrepit
[00:48:05.806 --> 00:48:07.287]  Shuffle of Joe Biden.
[00:48:07.287 --> 00:48:12.189]  How many drugs did they pump him up with last night so he could deliver that speech?
[00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:16.011]  Whether it was live or not, it doesn't matter.
[00:48:16.011 --> 00:48:17.551]  And then he had to walk 30 feet.
[00:48:17.551 --> 00:48:22.894]  Let me tell you, he might not even get out of bed today with whatever cocktail of medicine they put him.
[00:48:22.894 --> 00:48:26.976]  He'll be knocked out for the next 48 hours.
[00:48:26.976 --> 00:48:30.217]  But so imagine, hey, you live in a free country.
[00:48:30.217 --> 00:48:31.338]  You live in a republic.
[00:48:31.338 --> 00:48:32.298]  Independence, right?
[00:48:32.298 --> 00:48:33.719]  Independence Day, we declared.
[00:48:34.711 --> 00:48:44.435]  Our independence as individuals, as Americans, from a tyrannical government, from any sort of overwhelming government.
[00:48:44.435 --> 00:48:47.156]  We have freedoms here.
[00:48:47.156 --> 00:48:49.617]  Oh, but as of today, as of March 11th, 2021,
[00:48:53.112 --> 00:48:56.815]  Joe Biden says, nope, you're not in a free country.
[00:48:56.815 --> 00:48:58.956]  Nope, you're not a free citizen.
[00:48:58.956 --> 00:49:03.900]  But maybe you can be if you take the vaccine like a good slave.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:06.902]  So you want to be a free slave?
[00:49:06.902 --> 00:49:10.664]  Take that vaccine.
[00:49:10.664 --> 00:49:14.507]  But just like Kanye West said, it's never been more prevalent.
[00:49:14.507 --> 00:49:15.788]  Slavery was a choice.
[00:49:15.788 --> 00:49:17.049]  Slavery is a choice.
[00:49:19.312 --> 00:49:21.814]  May have actually been the more accurate statement.
[00:49:21.814 --> 00:49:25.517]  Not slavery was a choice in the context of his conversation.
[00:49:25.517 --> 00:49:29.700]  It made sense, but the more accurate statement is slavery is a choice.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.002]  Now I get it!
[00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:34.984]  We know what those choices could entail.
[00:49:34.984 --> 00:49:40.429]  The Democrat Party already has their political dissidents rounded up and put in jail, put in camps.
[00:49:40.429 --> 00:49:41.770]  Physically actually doing that.
[00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.512]  They're also censoring their political dissidents.
[00:49:44.512 --> 00:49:48.395]  So, this is the New World Order cult.
[00:49:49.685 --> 00:49:51.246]  This is the end of independence.
[00:49:51.246 --> 00:49:56.530]  This is the end of American citizen sovereignty.
[00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:01.934]  And as of March 11, 2021, Joe Biden just announced that to the world.
[00:50:01.934 --> 00:50:05.496]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:50:05.496 --> 00:50:09.219]  So you don't get a border and you're not free until you take a vaccine.
[00:50:09.219 --> 00:50:11.040]  Think about that.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.062]  Oh, and by the way, we just signed a $2 trillion stimulus bill.
[00:50:14.062 --> 00:50:15.503]  It's going to put you in further into debt.
[00:50:17.862 --> 00:50:20.365]  And you won't even see a dime from it.
[00:50:20.365 --> 00:50:21.686]  And so I've got all that coming on.
[00:50:21.686 --> 00:50:23.248]  But let's look at what's happening with the vaccines.
[00:50:23.248 --> 00:50:34.700]  Now remember, they have said, and there's probably, well there have been new developments on this, but it's not a specific one where they say,
[00:50:35.746 --> 00:50:46.470]  If you're going to have a mammogram, have it before you get the COVID vaccine or wait a year after you get it because you're going to have a false positive for cancer from your COVID vaccine.
[00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:50.352]  And so that was the beginning of it.
[00:50:50.352 --> 00:50:52.993]  And they wouldn't even tell you that that's what was going on.
[00:50:52.993 --> 00:50:56.434]  But if you read into it and you read between the lines, you understand that's what's going on.
[00:50:56.434 --> 00:50:57.695]  So we reported on that.
[00:50:57.695 --> 00:50:59.116]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:50:59.116 --> 00:51:02.497]  False positives for cancer after the COVID vaccine.
[00:51:03.539 --> 00:51:06.680]  Do you think those are actually false, though?
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.300]  Well, we don't know.
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:12.061]  They just say it's false.
[00:51:12.061 --> 00:51:20.244]  And now, Norway is investigating whether AstraZeneca vaccine caused deadly blood clots.
[00:51:20.244 --> 00:51:25.365]  And so, because of that, they've decided to hold some of these vaccines back.
[00:51:25.365 --> 00:51:27.586]  But don't worry, they'll release them again.
[00:51:27.586 --> 00:51:32.647]  They just need some time to make you think that they're investigating what's going on with all these negative side effects.
[00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:39.753]  Half of French nursing home workers reluctant to receive COVID vaccine.
[00:51:39.753 --> 00:51:43.275]  I think reluctant is a kind way of putting it.
[00:51:43.275 --> 00:51:56.222]  I have friends in France and Paris and while they have their problems over there, they are really into health, natural health, organic health.
[00:51:57.359 --> 00:51:59.901]  And they don't want this vaccine.
[00:51:59.901 --> 00:52:05.284]  This is very unpopular in France, and even the lockdown is reaching a point of extreme unpopularity in France.
[00:52:05.284 --> 00:52:08.386]  It's not really being reported anywhere.
[00:52:08.386 --> 00:52:13.850]  You're not seeing yellow vest protests like we saw in the past.
[00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:16.832]  But what are they going to do when people don't want to take the vaccine?
[00:52:16.832 --> 00:52:19.974]  See, these people don't want to admit they're tyrants.
[00:52:19.974 --> 00:52:26.178]  These people don't want to admit they're totalitarians, but see, the execution of their policy proves it.
[00:52:26.178 --> 00:52:26.298]  So,
[00:52:27.276 --> 00:52:37.719]  Like in Texas, they say, no, the liberal groups here, funded by who knows who, that go out and have these protests, they say, you can't open Texas 100% until 70% of the people are vaccinated.
[00:52:37.719 --> 00:52:40.740]  Well, what if only 50% of the people want to get vaccinated?
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:41.420]  So then what do you do?
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.040]  Well, I guess you have to force them, don't you?
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.121]  Oh, so you are a tyrant.
[00:52:44.121 --> 00:52:47.281]  You are an authoritarian, just like Joe Biden.
[00:52:47.281 --> 00:52:51.403]  You are not celebrating Independence Day until we all take our vaccines.
[00:52:51.403 --> 00:52:52.883]  He needs you to.
[00:52:52.883 --> 00:52:54.763]  Why do you need me to do anything, Joe?
[00:52:54.763 --> 00:52:56.424]  I need you to do a few things.
[00:52:59.162 --> 00:53:02.883]  Italy imposes national lockdown as mutant COVID strains spread.
[00:53:02.883 --> 00:53:09.184]  So tell me, with all these mutant strains, how the vaccine is going to work?
[00:53:09.184 --> 00:53:10.784]  Well, it's not!
[00:53:10.784 --> 00:53:13.785]  That's the big joke.
[00:53:13.785 --> 00:53:16.486]  That's the big pharmaceutical ploy.
[00:53:16.486 --> 00:53:19.246]  Oh, there's going to be strains and mutant strains, just like the flu shot.
[00:53:19.246 --> 00:53:21.947]  They have to do a new flu shot every year because the new strain.
[00:53:21.947 --> 00:53:23.007]  I guess the flu is dead now.
[00:53:23.007 --> 00:53:23.727]  It's all COVID.
[00:53:23.727 --> 00:53:28.068]  So they've rebranded the flu to COVID so they could sell you vaccines and make trillions of dollars.
[00:53:30.911 --> 00:53:40.639]  So how is the vaccine you made for the strain, when you started making these vaccines six months ago or eight months ago, how is that going to work against the new strain?
[00:53:40.639 --> 00:53:41.260]  Well, it's not.
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:44.662]  They'll have a new vaccine that they'll force you to take and then maybe you can have a barbecue.
[00:53:44.662 --> 00:53:45.983]  Oh, there's a new strain.
[00:53:45.983 --> 00:53:49.086]  Sorry, no barbecue, no school, no church, but don't worry, we'll get another vaccine.
[00:53:49.306 --> 00:54:08.080]  And then you'll just keep paying, and paying, and paying, and paying, and big pharmaceutical vaccine manufacturers will make trillions, and all the people on the inside are trading, holding their stock, will make billions, and Fauci, and Gates, and the Democrats will just laugh all the way to the bank.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.662]  Europe's COVID vaccine rollout faces even more delays.
[00:54:10.662 --> 00:54:12.683]  Again, because there's all these new strains.
[00:54:12.683 --> 00:54:16.847]  So you can never come out of lockdown, because the virus is never going to stop mutating.
[00:54:16.847 --> 00:54:17.527]  Apparently.
[00:54:17.527 --> 00:54:18.648]  Who believes any of it anyway?
[00:54:19.238 --> 00:54:23.301]  They've never even isolated the virus!
[00:54:23.301 --> 00:54:29.284]  Want more proof that Trump supporters are smarter than the Trump haters?
[00:54:29.284 --> 00:54:30.445]  According to the latest poll,
[00:54:31.431 --> 00:54:34.913]  Half of Trump supporters will not take the COVID vaccine.
[00:54:34.913 --> 00:54:37.455]  This is a NPR, PBS, Marist poll.
[00:54:37.455 --> 00:54:43.599]  So half of Trump supporters won't take the vaccine, but 78% of Democrats believe the lockdowns must stay in place.
[00:54:43.599 --> 00:54:48.903]  So again, Democrats love their slavery to the big government, don't they?
[00:54:48.903 --> 00:54:51.385]  Oh, the Democrats are all about the little guy.
[00:54:51.385 --> 00:54:53.546]  They're all anti-establishment.
[00:54:53.546 --> 00:54:54.507]  They want the small government.
[00:54:54.507 --> 00:54:55.928]  They want the government out of our lives.
[00:54:55.928 --> 00:54:57.689]  Lie!
[00:54:57.689 --> 00:55:00.471]  The Democrat Party is now the party of totalitarianism.
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.562]  The Democrat Party is now the party of big government.
[00:55:03.562 --> 00:55:06.444]  The Democrat Party is the party of censoring free speech.
[00:55:06.444 --> 00:55:16.652]  The Democrat Party is the party of communist-style takeovers of free nations, like the United States of America.
[00:55:16.652 --> 00:55:25.899]  And yes, as you saw, they are using past presidents to push the experimental vaccines on the public, and Michelle Obama encourages people to do it, George Bush.
[00:55:25.899 --> 00:55:27.220]  They all wear the masks, too.
[00:55:28.436 --> 00:55:33.719]  And they say now there's a story in this Stanford Advocate wearing masks is liberating.
[00:55:33.719 --> 00:55:37.281]  And I learned this now, it's liberating because people are ugly.
[00:55:37.281 --> 00:55:38.762]  They literally say that.
[00:55:38.762 --> 00:55:44.086]  So now ugly people are going to be ruling the world and make you not show your face because you're good looking.
[00:55:44.086 --> 00:55:45.186]  This is the left.
[00:55:45.186 --> 00:55:46.347]  This is the Democrat Party.
[00:55:47.376 --> 00:55:55.463]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we've brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[00:55:55.463 --> 00:55:56.524]  It is Down and Out.

[00:55:58.345 --> 00:56:01.328]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[00:56:01.328 --> 00:56:04.390]  It's got 4 milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:06.952]  It's got 25 milligrams of passionflower.
[00:56:06.952 --> 00:56:10.595]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[00:56:10.595 --> 00:56:12.457]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm.
[00:56:12.957 --> 00:56:15.618]  And 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[00:56:15.618 --> 00:56:18.219]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[00:56:18.219 --> 00:56:21.260]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:23.641]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[00:56:23.641 --> 00:56:27.422]  If you take it subliminally under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off to sleep?
[00:56:27.422 --> 00:56:28.123]  It's incredible.
[00:56:28.123 --> 00:56:30.643]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[00:56:30.643 --> 00:56:33.124]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.

[00:56:48.715 --> 00:56:56.879]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[00:56:56.879 --> 00:57:03.202]  Even before I had an access TV show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that was fun.
[00:57:04.167 --> 00:57:09.214]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[00:57:09.214 --> 00:57:11.037]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[00:57:13.089 --> 00:57:14.169]  We're not worthy!
[00:57:14.169 --> 00:57:14.989]  We're not worthy!
[00:57:14.989 --> 00:57:18.970]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you.
[00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:20.971]  Because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[00:57:20.971 --> 00:57:22.351]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[00:57:22.351 --> 00:57:24.411]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[00:57:24.411 --> 00:57:26.071]  The globalists love lying to you.
[00:57:26.071 --> 00:57:27.392]  They love manipulating you.
[00:57:27.392 --> 00:57:30.092]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[00:57:30.092 --> 00:57:34.713]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[00:57:34.713 --> 00:57:37.053]  That for me is really satan.
[00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:38.094]  And disgusting.
[00:57:38.094 --> 00:57:40.454]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole Infowars crew
[00:57:42.092 --> 00:57:43.975]  We will never join the Globals.
[00:57:43.975 --> 00:57:46.057]  We will never knowingly manipulate you.
[00:57:46.057 --> 00:57:51.344]  Because we know we're all in this together.
[00:57:51.344 --> 00:57:53.968]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:12.987 --> 00:58:19.912]  Imagine thinking you're anti-establishment and then doing everything the establishment tells you to do.
[00:58:19.912 --> 00:58:22.734]  This is the Modern Day Leftist Libtard.
[00:58:22.734 --> 00:58:23.915]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:23.915 --> 00:58:25.136]  We're in the second hour.
[00:58:25.136 --> 00:58:32.100]  Before I get into this other news coming out of the Biden camp, I want to show you what's been going on in Portland, Oregon.
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:35.042]  Completely ignored by the mainstream media and the Democrat Party.
[00:58:35.042 --> 00:58:36.724]  How convenient for them.
[00:58:36.724 --> 00:58:38.565]  First, let's go to clip nine.
[00:58:39.668 --> 00:58:45.650]  Where, uh, in the beginning hours of the evening last night, Portland Antifa showed up at a federal courthouse.
[00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:46.610]  This is the beginning of the evening.
[00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:56.173]  We'll show you the developments with more video, but, uh, let's take a look at what, uh, the, the left wing was doing in Portland, Oregon last night in clip nine.
[00:58:56.173 --> 00:58:57.274]  Touch me again!
[00:58:57.274 --> 00:58:58.934]  I ain't touchin' that one door!
[00:58:58.934 --> 00:59:00.234]  Don't touch me!
[00:59:00.234 --> 00:59:02.335]  Take that girl to me right there!
[00:59:02.335 --> 00:59:05.056]  Touch me!
[00:59:05.056 --> 00:59:07.357]  It's outside a federal courthouse in Portland.
[00:59:08.993 --> 00:59:10.554]  This goon's ass, I don't understand.
[00:59:26.363 --> 00:59:26.783]  Pull it!
[00:59:26.783 --> 00:59:27.744]  Do it!
[00:59:27.744 --> 00:59:29.145]  You don't scare me!
[00:59:29.145 --> 00:59:32.108]  You don't f***ing scare me, bitch!
[00:59:32.108 --> 00:59:35.691]  Yeah, they're not scared because the Democrats have told them, we're gonna let you be terrorists.
[00:59:35.691 --> 00:59:37.152]  That will not hold.
[00:59:37.152 --> 00:59:39.474]  That is not gonna hold!
[00:59:39.474 --> 00:59:44.338]  Why are these people behaving like... I mean, turn off the intercom.
[00:59:44.338 --> 00:59:49.142]  Do it!
[00:59:49.142 --> 00:59:49.722]  Do it!
[00:59:49.722 --> 00:59:51.924]  Hey, look, I'll give the left wing credit.
[00:59:51.924 --> 00:59:53.405]  They're violent revolutionaries.
[00:59:53.405 --> 00:59:54.886]  I mean, they're violent revolutionaries.
[00:59:54.886 --> 00:59:55.707]  Trump's voters are not.
[00:59:56.887 --> 01:00:00.089]  Here they are spraying who knows what that is inside the building.
[01:00:00.089 --> 01:00:01.510]  That's a felony.
[01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:02.771]  Destruction of federal property.
[01:00:02.771 --> 01:00:05.032]  No arrest made.
[01:00:05.032 --> 01:00:07.274]  So that's at the beginning of the night.
[01:00:07.274 --> 01:00:10.215]  So this is how they're behaving at the beginning of the night while the sun is still out.
[01:00:10.215 --> 01:00:11.856]  This is just them getting warmed up.
[01:00:11.856 --> 01:00:15.058]  And look at how law enforcement does nothing.
[01:00:15.058 --> 01:00:18.781]  How are these individuals not arrested?
[01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:21.302]  That's incredible.
[01:00:21.302 --> 01:00:22.243]  Well it didn't stop there.
[01:00:24.904 --> 01:00:30.845]  They came back later in the evening to the same federal courthouse and tried to burn it to the ground while people were still inside.
[01:00:30.845 --> 01:00:35.646]  Check out clip 10.
[01:00:35.646 --> 01:00:42.167]  So Antifa lights a fire on the courthouse there that you just saw them at.
[01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:45.608]  And now they've lit the building on fire.
[01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:49.189]  This is a mostly peaceful protest, by the way.
[01:00:49.189 --> 01:00:51.629]  And arrests are not being made, folks.
[01:00:52.575 --> 01:00:58.220]  And the reason is because if they get arrested, the charges get dropped and they get released from jail immediately.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:03.445]  I'm going to have a guest on that, a lawyer who's dealing with this directly on The War Room next week.
[01:01:03.445 --> 01:01:05.066]  We've got him scheduled.
[01:01:05.066 --> 01:01:11.933]  I won't say too much right now, but let's just say we've got some inside information on what's going on there.
[01:01:11.933 --> 01:01:16.857]  The reason why Antifa is out of control in Portland is because they know they won't get arrested and they know even if they do, their charges will be dropped.
[01:01:17.998 --> 01:01:31.565]  So here's, uh, after the Portland Antifa tried to burn a building down with federal officers inside, here's what it looked like on the streets afterward in clip 12.
[01:01:31.565 --> 01:01:33.786]  So, uh, where's the war zone again?
[01:01:33.786 --> 01:01:35.126]  It's not in D.C., folks.
[01:01:35.126 --> 01:01:37.767]  There's no activity in D.C.
[01:01:37.767 --> 01:01:40.429]  This is in Portland, Oregon last night.
[01:01:40.429 --> 01:01:47.052]  So radical left-wing terrorists and, uh, Democrat Party surrogates
[01:01:48.803 --> 01:01:54.527]  Riding every night in Portland trying to burn buildings to the ground and the mainstream media doesn't cover it.
[01:01:54.527 --> 01:01:56.548]  The mainstream media doesn't mention it.
[01:01:56.548 --> 01:01:58.729]  The Democrat Party has no problem with it.
[01:01:58.729 --> 01:02:00.330]  They refuse to send law enforcement.
[01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:01.531]  They don't build walls.
[01:02:01.531 --> 01:02:02.792]  They don't put up barriers.
[01:02:02.792 --> 01:02:06.294]  They don't put up barbed wire fences.
[01:02:06.294 --> 01:02:07.615]  They're not allowed to make arrests.
[01:02:08.135 --> 01:02:16.638]  But if you step foot sideways in Washington, D.C., the entire National Guard will come down on you because that's what Nancy Pelosi wants.
[01:02:16.638 --> 01:02:21.699]  She actually wanted them to shoot you down with a machine gun turret on every corner, but they didn't get that.
[01:02:21.699 --> 01:02:23.840]  They may yet, though.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.520]  They may yet, though.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.681]  And so, while all this is going on,
[01:02:29.784 --> 01:02:32.785]  The National Guard is saying we should not be in D.C.
[01:02:32.785 --> 01:02:34.065]  We're not needed here.
[01:02:34.065 --> 01:02:36.365]  We're costing the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:02:36.365 --> 01:02:37.926]  Please relieve us of this duty in D.C.
[01:02:37.926 --> 01:02:38.846]  Let's take down these walls.
[01:02:38.846 --> 01:02:41.126]  There's no threat here.
[01:02:41.126 --> 01:02:43.207]  And the Democrats say, nope, you have to stay here.
[01:02:43.207 --> 01:02:51.848]  And then the new Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, says you're going to be staying here until at least May with thousands of troops on guard, 24-7, and the fences stay up.
[01:02:51.848 --> 01:02:53.969]  But they ignore the Democrat violence in Portland.
[01:02:53.969 --> 01:02:54.509]  How convenient.
[01:02:56.292 --> 01:03:00.317]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[01:03:00.317 --> 01:03:03.320]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.943]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[01:03:05.943 --> 01:03:08.946]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[01:03:08.946 --> 01:03:12.550]  That's why Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:14.853]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies.
[01:03:15.473 --> 01:03:21.736]  Are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[01:03:21.736 --> 01:03:24.897]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals.
[01:03:24.897 --> 01:03:26.017]  Because it's so simple.
[01:03:26.017 --> 01:03:27.998]  Because you won't be under their control anymore.
[01:03:27.998 --> 01:03:36.862]  Well, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the highest quality Vitamin Mineral Fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form, is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:03:36.862 --> 01:03:39.203]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[01:03:39.203 --> 01:03:42.344]  It funds the InfoWare at the same time.
[01:03:42.344 --> 01:03:44.205]  No other product you can buy does that.
[01:03:44.625 --> 01:03:46.548]  So again, InfoWareStore.com.
[01:03:46.548 --> 01:03:48.612]  It's back in stock, 50% off.
[01:03:48.612 --> 01:03:49.633]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:03:49.633 --> 01:03:52.097]  I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[01:03:52.097 --> 01:03:54.882]  So take action today and give it to your friends and family as a gift.
[01:04:05.544 --> 01:04:08.788]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:04:08.788 --> 01:04:13.953]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:04:13.953 --> 01:04:18.218]  Don't expect the Democrat tyranny to end any time soon.
[01:04:19.483 --> 01:04:24.146]  Don't expect the Democrat terrorism to end anytime soon.
[01:04:24.146 --> 01:04:33.331]  They are fully endorsing both of these activities, whether it's big pharmaceutical tyranny or just telling you can't go to church or school or open your business.
[01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:44.698]  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands a month are pouring in over the southern border and being put in small facilities, elbow to elbow, back to back, and testing positive for COVID.
[01:04:44.698 --> 01:04:46.759]  By the way, it was just those that volunteer
[01:04:48.047 --> 01:04:54.413]  Just out of those that volunteer for COVID, about 5% were testing positive.
[01:04:54.413 --> 01:04:56.715]  And that's, so that's the math of the overall number.
[01:04:56.715 --> 01:04:58.837]  So I'm sorry, I'm not even saying that right.
[01:04:58.837 --> 01:05:03.722]  It's not even 5% of the overall number, or it is 5% of the overall number, but it's not even
[01:05:04.597 --> 01:05:09.739]  We don't know what the actual percentage is because they just volunteer to get tested for COVID, so not everybody's getting tested for COVID.
[01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:15.702]  Now again, you can test everybody in the nation for COVID, or the flu, or herpes, or God knows what else!
[01:05:15.702 --> 01:05:19.543]  And 50%, 60%, 70% of the nation may have it!
[01:05:19.543 --> 01:05:27.907]  Doesn't matter we stop being free, doesn't matter we lock ourselves down, humans have been here for thousands, millions, who knows how many years!
[01:05:27.907 --> 01:05:30.908]  But now a virus controls us, see?
[01:05:30.908 --> 01:05:33.529]  No, the media is the virus, the politicians are the virus,
[01:05:34.369 --> 01:05:35.629]  Anthony Fauci is the virus.
[01:05:35.629 --> 01:05:37.130]  Bill Gates is the virus.
[01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:47.453]  That's why they want to say that you're the virus or that you have a virus because they know they are the virus.
[01:05:47.453 --> 01:05:54.816]  So it shows how everything that they tell us is a lie.
[01:05:54.816 --> 01:05:56.516]  Everything they tell us is a lie.
[01:05:56.516 --> 01:05:59.717]  And what's even sadder, we expect them to lie.
[01:05:59.717 --> 01:06:01.358]  But what's even more depressing
[01:06:02.831 --> 01:06:13.801]  Is that Americans fall for the big lie, but then are willing to give up all of their freedoms because of the big lie.
[01:06:13.801 --> 01:06:17.525]  That's what really hurts.
[01:06:17.525 --> 01:06:18.586]  That's what's going to hurt.
[01:06:22.862 --> 01:06:31.044]  So, it just goes to show you, so you don't get a wall at the southern border, you don't get National Guard in Portland, where there's real crises happening.
[01:06:31.044 --> 01:06:36.445]  It gets ignored by the media, ignored by the politicians, but they're gonna make sure that wall in D.C.
[01:06:36.445 --> 01:06:37.686]  is never coming down.
[01:06:37.686 --> 01:06:43.107]  Even though I did see a video of them taking the barbed wire off the fence, so that's nice.
[01:06:43.107 --> 01:06:46.188]  They didn't want it to look like a total third world hell hole yet.
[01:06:47.154 --> 01:06:54.579]  You know, the dystopic look of the barbed wire fence, I guess, was a little too much for Nancy Pelosi, even though she wanted the machine gun turrets on every corner.
[01:06:54.579 --> 01:07:05.707]  And if Lloyd Austin would have been the Secretary of Defense at the time, and Mal Biden would have been in the White House at the time, maybe they would have gotten it.
[01:07:05.707 --> 01:07:15.895]  But the White House says there's no crisis at the border as you have hundreds of thousands pouring in a month, costing us hundreds of millions of dollars, filling our prison systems,
[01:07:18.374 --> 01:07:27.943]  Filling these facilities, overwhelming border patrol, bringing in drugs, sex trafficking, human trafficking.
[01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:28.984]  Again, that's not a story though.
[01:07:28.984 --> 01:07:30.946]  That's not even happening, they say.
[01:07:30.946 --> 01:07:38.592]  Because if they admit it's happening, it shows how much of a fraud every one of their policies is, specifically when it comes to COVID.
[01:07:38.592 --> 01:07:42.616]  When they're entering the country with COVID and then being released into the general population.
[01:07:42.616 --> 01:07:43.817]  In fact, I think it was Brownsville.
[01:07:43.817 --> 01:07:44.318]  Guys, look it up.
[01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:48.793]  Once again, hundreds, thousands of illegals pour in.
[01:07:48.793 --> 01:07:50.475]  They don't have room at the facilities.
[01:07:50.475 --> 01:08:00.963]  So you, you, the American taxpayer, pay for them to get on Greyhound buses or pay for them to get on flights to be redistributed.
[01:08:00.963 --> 01:08:02.184]  They're redistributing your wealth.
[01:08:02.184 --> 01:08:09.590]  They're redistributing the human population of Earth all into America.
[01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:11.612]  And so, Brownsville
[01:08:12.389 --> 01:08:13.931]  He's like, well, wait a second.
[01:08:13.931 --> 01:08:14.752]  This is ridiculous.
[01:08:14.752 --> 01:08:21.400]  You're dropping off all of these illegal migrants here, busloads of them, and they're not even being tested for COVID.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.843]  So then they're saying, hey, we'd like to test you for COVID.
[01:08:23.843 --> 01:08:25.305]  About half the people volunteer.
[01:08:25.305 --> 01:08:26.947]  Turns out 100 says positive.
[01:08:26.947 --> 01:08:27.868]  And then what happens?
[01:08:27.868 --> 01:08:29.550]  They get released into the population.
[01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:30.932]  Now, again, I don't care.
[01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:33.154]  I don't care about COVID.
[01:08:33.154 --> 01:08:33.915]  It's the flu.
[01:08:33.915 --> 01:08:34.556]  It's the cold.
[01:08:34.556 --> 01:08:36.738]  It's been rebranded so they can sell you a vaccine.
[01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:45.586]  It's been hopped up in a lab to see how quickly they can spread a virus in a bioweapons test.
[01:08:45.586 --> 01:08:49.650]  So it's not even about the COVID, but it is about the COVID because it shows they're fraud.
[01:08:49.650 --> 01:08:54.294]  So you can't be free because of COVID, but they can have a wide open border policy
[01:08:55.848 --> 01:09:05.056]  And ignore all the COVID positive people coming in, even though it's the deadliest thing, it's the biggest thing ever, you have to be a slave because of COVID.
[01:09:05.056 --> 01:09:09.840]  Oh, and they're also putting kids in cages.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:16.886]  And at this rate, it's already reached this, but I mean, how many months in a row does that have to happen?
[01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:17.827]  100,000 on record.
[01:09:17.827 --> 01:09:20.008]  This is just on record.
[01:09:20.008 --> 01:09:23.912]  Oh, and by the way, there's portions, so Trump building the wall,
[01:09:26.351 --> 01:09:32.717]  There's portions of the wall that have like 20 foot gaps that were still in process of construction.
[01:09:32.717 --> 01:09:41.745]  There's like three or four portions that were like two, three days away from completion in major areas where there's people coming across the border.
[01:09:41.745 --> 01:09:43.306]  Like 20 foot gaps.
[01:09:43.306 --> 01:09:46.389]  Biden got in office and canceled the construction.
[01:09:46.389 --> 01:09:47.790]  What the hell is that?
[01:09:47.790 --> 01:09:50.112]  Two or three more days.
[01:09:50.112 --> 01:09:51.734]  The contracts have already been written.
[01:09:52.794 --> 01:10:01.769]  And he stops construction of the walls so there can be 20 to 30 foot gaps in all these different places where there's heavy immigration, illegal immigration happening.
[01:10:05.842 --> 01:10:08.363]  And then news crews go down there because they hear about it.
[01:10:08.363 --> 01:10:10.743]  They're like, hey, we heard there's these gaps in the wall.
[01:10:10.743 --> 01:10:12.284]  Biden shut down the construction.
[01:10:12.284 --> 01:10:13.564]  Two or three days, it would have been finished.
[01:10:13.564 --> 01:10:14.985]  They would have closed those gaps.
[01:10:14.985 --> 01:10:16.185]  And they get down there.
[01:10:16.185 --> 01:10:18.986]  They don't even have time to set up their cameras.
[01:10:18.986 --> 01:10:20.646]  So they have to pull out a phone.
[01:10:20.646 --> 01:10:27.308]  They don't even have time to set up their cameras because as soon as they get on the ground, there's already illegal immigrants crossing in.
[01:10:27.308 --> 01:10:29.369]  And they don't even have time to set up a camera.
[01:10:29.369 --> 01:10:31.029]  They just have to whip out their phone to record it.
[01:10:33.163 --> 01:10:34.863]  This is Biden's policy.
[01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:37.124]  Biden's policy spreads COVID.
[01:10:37.124 --> 01:10:39.625]  Biden's policy has a wide open border.
[01:10:39.625 --> 01:10:46.947]  And then when Jen Psaki is asked about it, she just laughs in Peter Doocy's face.
[01:10:46.947 --> 01:10:52.988]  And, you know, I would be in defense of Jen Psaki because they're obviously not telling her anything.
[01:10:52.988 --> 01:10:56.389]  But, you know, she could be honest about that and said she wants to be a pompous bitch.
[01:10:56.389 --> 01:10:58.229]  So screw her.
[01:10:58.229 --> 01:11:00.150]  Little sock puppet of the Biden administration.
[01:11:02.347 --> 01:11:04.689]  Yeah, there's just thousands.
[01:11:04.689 --> 01:11:13.436]  This is just one part where a coyote is floating them across the river.
[01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:15.557]  Hey, at least he puts a life vest on them.
[01:11:15.557 --> 01:11:19.000]  Cares more about them than the Biden administration, I guess.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.902]  And then they get here and then they come in.
[01:11:21.902 --> 01:11:26.746]  And Border Patrol can do nothing about it because the Biden administration policy is let them go.
[01:11:26.746 --> 01:11:27.726]  Let them in.
[01:11:27.726 --> 01:11:28.247]  Let them free.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:34.762]  So COVID pandemic for you, but not for thee.
[01:11:34.762 --> 01:11:39.825]  COVID pandemic for you, but they can pour into this country with COVID.
[01:11:39.825 --> 01:11:41.746]  We're doing everything to stop this virus.
[01:11:41.746 --> 01:11:43.467]  We need to get this virus under control.
[01:11:43.467 --> 01:11:49.010]  Then we can go back to normal as they let the virus spread intentionally.
[01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:50.271]  I've said it once.
[01:11:50.271 --> 01:11:51.932]  I'm going to say it till I'm blue in the face.
[01:11:51.932 --> 01:11:53.733]  No pun intended.
[01:11:53.733 --> 01:11:57.635]  A Democrat politician or a liberal
[01:11:58.453 --> 01:12:03.917]  Democrat on television is the biggest liar in world history.
[01:12:03.917 --> 01:12:17.408]  There is not a lie too big, there is not a lie these people won't tell, even when they're caught in their lie, even when they're caught in their fraud, even when they're caught in their double standards and their hypocrisy, they never stop!
[01:12:17.408 --> 01:12:20.571]  These are committed liars!
[01:12:20.571 --> 01:12:26.936]  If the American people had the same commitment to fighting for freedom that the Democrats have to lying, we could actually save this country.
[01:12:28.266 --> 01:12:31.649]  Now I'm going to get into the latest coming out of the Biden Administration with some of these individuals.
[01:12:31.649 --> 01:12:33.070]  You're not even going to believe it.
[01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:39.695]  But ladies and gentlemen, remember, InfoWars leading the fight for truth and the awakening and renaissance here in the United States of America.

[01:12:52.036 --> 01:12:53.557]  Believe me, they want to.
[01:12:53.557 --> 01:12:57.100]  Do not look back and say, man, I wish I would have supported InfoWars while I could.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:06.208]  I wish I would have gotten the air filters while they were available, the water filters while they were available, the emergency food while it was available before it's too late.

[01:13:36.121 --> 01:13:38.342]  We always appreciate your prayers.
[01:13:38.342 --> 01:13:40.422]  But hop on over to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:13:40.422 --> 01:13:42.223]  Yeah, we've got George Washington socks.
[01:13:43.123 --> 01:13:46.484]  There's all kinds of stuff that we have there that we just don't even talk about.
[01:13:46.484 --> 01:13:50.626]  The great supplements, hats, t-shirts, air filters, water filters, books, DVDs.
[01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:57.028]  It's all at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:13:57.028 --> 01:14:11.753]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[01:14:12.413 --> 01:14:20.596]  Being given free will, being given consciousness, is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[01:14:20.596 --> 01:14:33.080]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.060]  We're good to go.
[01:14:55.794 --> 01:14:59.739]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[01:14:59.739 --> 01:15:02.361]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[01:15:02.361 --> 01:15:03.122]  Why do you do that?
[01:15:03.122 --> 01:15:06.066]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[01:15:06.066 --> 01:15:08.088]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[01:15:08.874 --> 01:15:17.660]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:17.920]  Boom!
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.300]  We did it.
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:18.800]  It's popular.
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.581]  It's X3.
[01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:20.822]  Is it better than X2?
[01:15:20.822 --> 01:15:21.462]  You decide.
[01:15:21.462 --> 01:15:22.943]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[01:15:22.943 --> 01:15:27.086]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill
[01:15:27.966 --> 01:15:30.128]  Sleep Aid, and that is down and out.
[01:15:30.128 --> 01:15:34.832]  It's super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other.

[01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:01.593]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:24.091 --> 01:16:25.892]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:25.892 --> 01:16:30.195]  Owen Troyer sitting in studio for Alex today.
[01:16:30.195 --> 01:16:44.604]  I want to get into what's going on inside the Biden administration and what they're doing to you, the American taxpayer, what you're paying for.
[01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:56.788]  Oh yeah, don't worry, that COVID stimulus bill is ripping you off in ways that, I mean, they have to be laughing.
[01:16:56.788 --> 01:17:02.552]  The politicians have to be laughing that they just pulled this.
[01:17:02.552 --> 01:17:04.713]  This may be the biggest steal in world history.
[01:17:04.713 --> 01:17:12.778]  This may be the biggest theft in the history of humanity, what Congress just pulled off, a $2 trillion stimulus bill.
[01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:18.478]  And we'll get into some of the lies of that, but where your money will really be going.
[01:17:18.478 --> 01:17:25.702]  But first, Biden executive order forces taxpayers to cover cost of military transgender surgeries.
[01:17:25.702 --> 01:17:27.123]  There you go.
[01:17:27.123 --> 01:17:30.485]  Don't you feel good you're no longer a bigot?
[01:17:30.485 --> 01:17:35.288]  Because of the executive order on enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform act.
[01:17:35.288 --> 01:17:38.089]  Don't you know that you're, doesn't it feel good not to be a bigot?
[01:17:38.089 --> 01:17:42.772]  You're finally paying for people to have their balls chopped off and join the military.
[01:17:44.581 --> 01:17:46.042]  You must feel good about yourself.
[01:17:46.042 --> 01:17:48.483]  Pat yourself on the back, American.
[01:17:48.483 --> 01:17:50.263]  You are no longer a bigot.
[01:17:50.263 --> 01:17:53.204]  You're paying for transgender surgeries of the military.
[01:17:53.204 --> 01:17:56.305]  And they also say they want pregnant women on the front lines.
[01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:58.266]  Way to go, boys.
[01:17:58.266 --> 01:17:58.906]  Way to go.
[01:17:58.906 --> 01:18:01.587]  Of course, that's insane.
[01:18:01.587 --> 01:18:05.068]  They say, oh, pregnant women are going to be on the front lines of the military.
[01:18:05.068 --> 01:18:07.249]  Pregnant women are going to be blasting off into space.
[01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:08.950]  Is that a joke?
[01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:09.610]  Is that a joke?
[01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:20.796]  I would be willing to bet, I don't know this, I don't know if anybody, could a baby, could a pregnant, could a woman that's pregnant with a baby inside her, could she, could that baby even survive being blasted off into space?
[01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:25.219]  It was like hundreds of G's of force, the baby would be dead!
[01:18:25.219 --> 01:18:30.322]  But they're going to build spacesuits for pregnant women to go into space!
[01:18:30.322 --> 01:18:31.423]  Would probably kill their baby!
[01:18:31.423 --> 01:18:37.186]  They're going to have a little pouch under it too for when the baby falls out dead?
[01:18:37.186 --> 01:18:38.167]  Good God!
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.382]  But I feel proud as an American today.
[01:18:41.382 --> 01:18:43.345]  I'm paying for transgender surgeries.
[01:18:43.345 --> 01:18:49.172]  Thank God I'm not a bigot anymore.
[01:18:49.172 --> 01:18:56.341]  You know, I was wondering why, and I get it now, I get why Trump did it now, I still don't support it, but I was wondering why is Trump promoting himself
[01:18:57.561 --> 01:18:59.842]  As the person who got the vaccines.
[01:18:59.842 --> 01:19:01.042]  The vaccines are deadly.
[01:19:01.042 --> 01:19:03.363]  His supporters don't like the vaccines.
[01:19:03.363 --> 01:19:04.063]  They never did.
[01:19:04.063 --> 01:19:05.284]  We don't want the vaccine.
[01:19:05.284 --> 01:19:06.344]  Why is he touting this?
[01:19:06.344 --> 01:19:07.885]  Why is he promoting it?
[01:19:07.885 --> 01:19:09.025]  And I get it now.
[01:19:09.025 --> 01:19:14.187]  It's kind of an ego thing, but it's more of a just rubbing it in the liberals' faces.
[01:19:14.187 --> 01:19:19.789]  And it hit me as I'm seeing the liberals worship the vaccine.
[01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:25.691]  Now, whether they actually believe in the vaccine that much or it's all just a political statement, I'm not totally sure.
[01:19:25.691 --> 01:19:26.591]  Maybe it's a mixture of both.
[01:19:28.044 --> 01:19:30.145]  The Libs love the vaccine.
[01:19:30.145 --> 01:19:31.145]  I mean, they're promoting it.
[01:19:31.145 --> 01:19:32.225]  They're saying, it saved me.
[01:19:32.225 --> 01:19:33.446]  I can finally see my grandma.
[01:19:33.446 --> 01:19:34.966]  I can finally see my daughter.
[01:19:34.966 --> 01:19:36.167]  I can finally hug somebody.
[01:19:36.167 --> 01:19:37.007]  Oh my gosh.
[01:19:37.007 --> 01:19:37.347]  Yay.
[01:19:37.347 --> 01:19:38.667]  Thank God for the vaccine.
[01:19:38.667 --> 01:19:39.848]  Oh my gosh.
[01:19:39.848 --> 01:19:41.788]  Oh, the vaccine freed us.
[01:19:41.788 --> 01:19:43.389]  The vaccine did it again.
[01:19:43.389 --> 01:19:44.929]  Thank God for the vaccine.
[01:19:44.929 --> 01:19:46.930]  I mean, they love, they love their vaccine.
[01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:47.870]  They need the vaccine.
[01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:48.291]  You heard right.
[01:19:48.291 --> 01:19:49.231]  I need it.
[01:19:49.231 --> 01:19:50.671]  I need you to take the vaccine.
[01:19:50.671 --> 01:19:51.932]  I need the vaccine.
[01:19:51.932 --> 01:19:52.192]  Oh.
[01:19:53.763 --> 01:20:05.452]  So they love the vaccine so much, and that's why Trump decided to claim it, to rub it in the Liberals' face, because he sees them, he sees the Liberals fawning over the vaccine, like getting weak at the knees.
[01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:14.700]  It was like Marilyn Monroe coming up to them with an offer, like, oh, oh, oh, oh, the vaccine, oh, oh, oh, thank God for the vaccine, oh!
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:22.046]  And so Trump just sees all this worship fest of the vaccine and says, hey, while you're bowing down to that vaccine, remember, you wouldn't have it if it wasn't for me.
[01:20:23.866 --> 01:20:27.147]  So that's really just Trump rubbing it in the liberal's face.
[01:20:27.147 --> 01:20:31.048]  Because he wants them to know, he's already living in their head rent-free, he doesn't need to do this.
[01:20:31.048 --> 01:20:34.149]  So again, I don't agree with him doing it, but I understand why he did it.
[01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:42.671]  So, he sees the left praising the vaccine, worshipping the vaccine, and he just reminds them, hey, while you're worshipping that vaccine, you better thank me!
[01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:43.471]  You better thank me!
[01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:48.412]  Of course, that'll never happen.
[01:20:48.412 --> 01:20:50.173]  But that's the story of the Gateway Pundit.
[01:20:52.054 --> 01:21:00.360]  Never seen a president in American history simultaneously executing a plan and denying its existence.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:05.644]  Trump official rips Biden for disgusting lies about Trump vaccine and distribution plan.
[01:21:05.644 --> 01:21:06.384]  Yeah, remember?
[01:21:06.384 --> 01:21:11.468]  When Biden came in, he said, when I got in, there was no vaccine.
[01:21:11.468 --> 01:21:12.728]  There was no plan.
[01:21:12.728 --> 01:21:17.692]  The guy had already had the vaccine and he's implementing Trump's warp speed plan.
[01:21:18.490 --> 01:21:25.776]  And he says there was no plan, there was no vaccine, as he's executing the plan and takes the vaccine!
[01:21:25.776 --> 01:21:30.179]  Now, does Biden know he's lying, or is he just so gone it's not even funny?
[01:21:30.179 --> 01:21:31.980]  How about this big lie?
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.942]  This is, I mean, wow!
[01:21:33.942 --> 01:21:40.206]  I'm telling you, man, look, people need to, it needs to be seared into your children's heads.
[01:21:40.206 --> 01:21:41.948]  Democrats are lying to you.
[01:21:41.948 --> 01:21:42.408]  Period.
[01:21:43.530 --> 01:21:46.711]  A Democrat in Congress and a liberal on TV is lying to you.
[01:21:46.711 --> 01:21:47.232]  Period.
[01:21:47.232 --> 01:21:48.512]  It needs to be accepted.
[01:21:48.512 --> 01:21:49.853]  It needs to be taught.
[01:21:49.853 --> 01:21:55.315]  It needs to become mainstream knowledge and information because it's the damn truth.
[01:21:55.315 --> 01:21:57.816]  How about this whopper from Chuck Schumer?
[01:21:57.816 --> 01:22:01.098]  Have you ever heard a bigger whopper of a lie?
[01:22:01.098 --> 01:22:03.799]  Chuck Schumer asked about the crisis at the border.
[01:22:03.799 --> 01:22:07.021]  Of course, you can't get an answer from the Biden administration from this.
[01:22:07.021 --> 01:22:10.082]  Jen Psaki laughs it off and Biden can't take questions.
[01:22:11.115 --> 01:22:20.961]  So Schumer says, when he's asked, Schumer says that Joe Biden inherited a huge mess from Trump at the border.
[01:22:20.961 --> 01:22:26.345]  Have you ever seen a bigger liar in your life?
[01:22:26.345 --> 01:22:33.630]  How could you even possibly portray that statement as accurate?
[01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:38.953]  Since Biden got into office, border crossings are doubling and tripling.
[01:22:40.194 --> 01:22:43.316]  Now you tell me how that's Trump.
[01:22:43.316 --> 01:22:44.876]  And then you had the lady come out yesterday.
[01:22:44.876 --> 01:22:46.457]  This is incredible.
[01:22:46.457 --> 01:22:53.561]  The lady comes out yesterday and says, yeah, illegal border crossings were way down under Trump and now they're way up.
[01:22:53.561 --> 01:22:59.323]  But that's because we're providing hope and humanity and treating them humanely.
[01:22:59.323 --> 01:23:04.146]  No, it's because you promised them free stuff and invited them across the border.
[01:23:04.146 --> 01:23:05.747]  There's nothing humane about what you're doing.
[01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:06.447]  It's disgusting.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.303]  You're complicit in the rape of women and children, is what you are.
[01:23:11.303 --> 01:23:13.144]  You're complicit in human trafficking.
[01:23:13.144 --> 01:23:15.125]  You're complicit in drug trafficking.
[01:23:15.125 --> 01:23:19.207]  Maybe they're consciously involved in this.
[01:23:19.207 --> 01:23:31.214]  But for Chuck Schumer to say Biden inherited a mess from Trump at the border, again, I shouldn't have to spend any time explaining how that is an entirely inaccurate, false statement, and Schumer knows it.
[01:23:32.151 --> 01:23:34.952]  What a dirtbag Chuck Schumer is.
[01:23:34.952 --> 01:23:37.113]  What a total and complete dirtbag.
[01:23:37.113 --> 01:23:42.835]  By the way, speaking of the dirtbags, think about what you have so far from Biden's administration.
[01:23:42.835 --> 01:23:49.017]  You have a guy that likes to dress up as a girl and wants to genitally mutilate children.
[01:23:49.017 --> 01:23:50.697]  Admitted it during the hearings.
[01:23:50.697 --> 01:23:52.238]  So that's one member of Biden's cabinet.
[01:23:53.564 --> 01:23:57.126]  Then you have the new Attorney General, who can't even answer questions.
[01:23:57.126 --> 01:23:59.067]  He seems like a real dumbass.
[01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:00.608]  Did you see his hearing?
[01:24:00.608 --> 01:24:01.948]  Do you believe border crossings are illegal?
[01:24:01.948 --> 01:24:03.149]  Well, I'm really not sure.
[01:24:03.149 --> 01:24:03.769]  Really?
[01:24:03.769 --> 01:24:05.270]  That's your new Attorney General.
[01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:08.032]  Now you've got this individual, Vinita Gupta.
[01:24:08.032 --> 01:24:12.314]  Oh, also, they had to cancel Neera Tanden, so that didn't work out.
[01:24:12.314 --> 01:24:16.836]  Now you've got Vinita Gupta, who holds millions in stock.
[01:24:17.814 --> 01:24:22.415]  An enterprise accused of enabling Mexican cartels heroin manufacturing.
[01:24:22.415 --> 01:24:24.135]  No, they have been caught.
[01:24:24.135 --> 01:24:34.477]  It's their ingredients used in the heroin that then gets smothered across the southern border that now Joe Biden is promoting and allowing to happen.
[01:24:34.477 --> 01:24:41.579]  And it's his appointee, Vanita Gupta, who is directly involved in it.
[01:24:41.579 --> 01:24:43.279]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[01:24:45.026 --> 01:24:46.747]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[01:24:46.747 --> 01:24:48.268]  This is the Biden administration.
[01:24:48.268 --> 01:24:49.048]  A clown show.
[01:24:49.048 --> 01:24:50.289]  A joke.
[01:24:50.289 --> 01:24:51.409]  Tyrannical.
[01:24:51.409 --> 01:24:52.170]  Illegal.
[01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:53.050]  Corrupt.
[01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:54.851]  Destroying everything that is free and good.
[01:24:55.621 --> 01:24:59.242]  Humanity has been domesticated, by and large.
[01:24:59.242 --> 01:25:03.783]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all gonna pass.
[01:25:03.783 --> 01:25:13.005]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[01:25:13.005 --> 01:25:17.126]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:34.985]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[01:25:35.565 --> 01:25:51.415]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[01:25:51.415 --> 01:25:55.337]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[01:25:55.337 --> 01:25:58.739]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[01:25:59.344 --> 01:26:02.348]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[01:26:02.348 --> 01:26:04.972]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[01:26:04.972 --> 01:26:07.976]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[01:26:07.976 --> 01:26:11.580]  That's why Jesus said, My people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:13.884]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies.
[01:26:14.344 --> 01:26:20.767]  Vitamins are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[01:26:20.767 --> 01:26:23.928]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals.
[01:26:23.928 --> 01:26:25.028]  Because it's so simple.
[01:26:25.028 --> 01:26:27.009]  Because you won't be under their control anymore.

[01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:51.012]  Never been a better time than right now.
[01:27:51.012 --> 01:27:51.752]  Super!
[01:27:51.752 --> 01:27:53.053]  Veil Vitality!
[01:27:53.053 --> 01:27:58.417]  At InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:27:58.417 --> 01:28:01.099]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:15.034 --> 01:28:20.335]  Imagine being so brainwashed, you celebrate your own slavery.
[01:28:20.335 --> 01:28:28.017]  That's the average liberal today, celebrating a mass mandate.
[01:28:28.017 --> 01:28:40.719]  Of course, if they have any linear logic, thinking ability, they know that it's a false premise, and they know that they're engaged in totalitarianism, authoritarianism, and tyranny.
[01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:43.703]  But they like it because they like telling you what to do.
[01:28:43.703 --> 01:28:44.924]  That's really what this is all about.
[01:28:44.924 --> 01:28:50.028]  They would gladly chop off their own leg, but that meant they got to chop off your leg too.
[01:28:50.028 --> 01:28:52.569]  That's the kind of sick, sadistic people we're dealing with right now.
[01:28:52.569 --> 01:28:53.510]  They call themselves liberals.
[01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:54.311]  They're not.
[01:28:54.311 --> 01:28:55.792]  They're tyrants.
[01:28:55.792 --> 01:28:56.713]  They're authoritarians.
[01:28:56.713 --> 01:28:57.673]  They're totalitarians.
[01:28:57.673 --> 01:28:59.695]  They're brainwashed slaves.
[01:28:59.695 --> 01:29:03.978]  I'm beginning to wonder if they're even human.
[01:29:03.978 --> 01:29:07.241]  So Biden says you can't be free until you take the vaccine.
[01:29:07.241 --> 01:29:08.642]  Hopefully we all take the vaccine by
[01:29:10.194 --> 01:29:12.838]  July 4th and we can all be free again.
[01:29:12.838 --> 01:29:20.187]  Mayor Adler, a Democrat mayor of Austin, Texas, is fighting tooth and nail to make sure that Austinites have to still wear a mask.
[01:29:20.187 --> 01:29:24.833]  Is he doing anything about the spike in violent crime under his watch?
[01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:25.835]  Nah, he ignores that.
[01:29:26.701 --> 01:29:33.763]  Is he doing anything about the random fires that happen at homeless camps that he's allowed to take over the city?
[01:29:33.763 --> 01:29:35.183]  Nah, nothing on that.
[01:29:35.183 --> 01:29:39.525]  Oh, but when it comes to you being a free citizen, he hates that and he's gonna make you wear that mask.
[01:29:39.525 --> 01:29:43.406]  And all the little libtards here in Austin love it and worship him for it.
[01:29:43.406 --> 01:29:44.206]  Yeah!
[01:29:44.206 --> 01:29:46.867]  Breathe in your own carbon dioxide!
[01:29:46.867 --> 01:29:50.488]  Breathe in your carbon dioxide that you claim is killing the planet, please!
[01:29:54.557 --> 01:29:58.519]  And they just love it.
[01:29:58.519 --> 01:30:05.223]  And they even say, the story came out in the Stanford Advocate, for some wearing a mask is liberating.
[01:30:05.223 --> 01:30:10.206]  It's liberating because they don't like showing their face, they don't like seeing your face.
[01:30:10.206 --> 01:30:17.470]  It's liberating because they love knowing that they had something to do with dominating you.
[01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:20.272]  So they see you with that mask on, that makes them feel good.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.001]  That makes them feel in control.
[01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:27.184]  And that's what they love, to control you.
[01:30:27.184 --> 01:30:33.527]  The modern-day liberal is a extreme authoritarian.
[01:30:33.527 --> 01:30:39.151]  And they can't even see it yet, which is the wildest part.
[01:30:39.151 --> 01:30:49.257]  And now, they've passed a $2 trillion theft, $2 trillion steal, the biggest money heist in world history,
[01:30:50.996 --> 01:30:53.317]  Was just pulled off by our Congress.
[01:30:53.317 --> 01:30:55.457]  The biggest money heist.
[01:30:55.457 --> 01:30:56.057]  Guys, look up.
[01:30:56.057 --> 01:31:02.879]  What was the biggest, the biggest, the biggest cash steal or the biggest money heist of all time ever?
[01:31:02.879 --> 01:31:08.001]  I believe it was a, it was a... Loomis Fargo, I believe?
[01:31:08.001 --> 01:31:10.841]  What was it?
[01:31:10.841 --> 01:31:11.501]  Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.
[01:31:11.501 --> 01:31:12.102]  It's okay.
[01:31:12.102 --> 01:31:15.142]  I believe the biggest money heist of all time was a Loomis Fargo heist.
[01:31:15.142 --> 01:31:17.183]  It was like 17 million dollars or something.
[01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:25.191]  But guys, see what the biggest money heist of all time is.
[01:31:25.191 --> 01:31:28.173]  Go down, go down to number one.
[01:31:28.173 --> 01:31:34.138]  Let's see what the biggest money heist of all time is, because it's been broken.
[01:31:34.138 --> 01:31:36.740]  The biggest money heist of all time has been broken.
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:40.783]  These are some pretty big numbers we're getting here.
[01:31:40.783 --> 01:31:41.424]  So let's go.
[01:31:41.424 --> 01:31:45.086]  The Central Bank of Iraq robbery is 920 million stolen.
[01:31:48.763 --> 01:31:52.766]  Back in 2003, before the Iraq War started.
[01:31:52.766 --> 01:31:56.328]  Okay, so the biggest money heist in the history of the world, $920 million.
[01:31:56.328 --> 01:32:01.152]  The Democrats beat that by trillions.
[01:32:01.152 --> 01:32:02.853]  So they stole $2 trillion.
[01:32:02.853 --> 01:32:05.815]  And so that's obviously the biggest theft in American history as well.
[01:32:05.815 --> 01:32:06.795]  So congratulations!
[01:32:06.795 --> 01:32:11.658]  I want to congratulate the Democrat Party and Nancy Pelosi and the Republicans that went along with it too.
[01:32:11.658 --> 01:32:14.200]  You guys should be congratulated.
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.381]  Congratulations!
[01:32:15.381 --> 01:32:16.862]  You have just completed
[01:32:18.001 --> 01:32:25.367]  The biggest money heist in the world, in world history, and really it's five trillion dollars.
[01:32:25.367 --> 01:32:29.070]  It's five trillion dollars that they've stolen in the last 12 months.
[01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:34.114]  Five trillion dollars in stimulus that they, quote-unquote, stimulus.
[01:32:35.595 --> 01:32:37.616]  Five trillion dollar money heist.
[01:32:37.616 --> 01:32:39.516]  Congratulations to our Congress.
[01:32:39.516 --> 01:32:43.197]  You are now the biggest thieves in the history of the world.
[01:32:43.197 --> 01:32:44.457]  Congratulations.
[01:32:44.457 --> 01:32:47.198]  No wonder why you have walls around the Congress.
[01:32:47.198 --> 01:32:50.359]  No wonder why you have walls around the Capitol.
[01:32:50.359 --> 01:32:52.939]  No wonder why you have the National Guard protecting you.
[01:32:52.939 --> 01:32:57.861]  You just stole five trillion dollars!
[01:32:57.861 --> 01:33:03.242]  You are living every day in fear that your criminal activity will finally come back to bite you.
[01:33:04.326 --> 01:33:06.750]  And so that's why you have armed guards and walls.
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:25.815]  Protecting you at the Capitol because you just stole five trillion dollars and you gave it to your friends, you gave it to Bill Gates, you gave it to Illinois and California and New York who shut down their economy and destroyed it and now are begging for handouts and they just got it.
[01:33:25.815 --> 01:33:35.363]  The biggest theft, the biggest crime in world history, five trillion dollars stolen by the United States Congress right in front of our eyes and then they told us to thank them for it too.
[01:33:37.182 --> 01:33:39.564]  Because it wasn't enough to rob us blind.
[01:33:39.564 --> 01:33:42.087]  They want to really rub our noses in it.
[01:33:42.087 --> 01:33:47.552]  And so they made us thank them for it, too.
[01:33:47.552 --> 01:33:52.436]  And so last night, Biden announced how he's ending poverty with the stimulus bill.
[01:33:52.436 --> 01:33:52.877]  Yeah, right.
[01:33:52.877 --> 01:33:55.399]  It's not going to do anything.
[01:33:55.399 --> 01:33:58.482]  And then they said, again, this is all lies, by the way.
[01:33:58.482 --> 01:33:59.823]  This is all lies.
[01:33:59.823 --> 01:34:00.524]  Basic logic.
[01:34:00.524 --> 01:34:01.285]  You can figure this out.
[01:34:02.153 --> 01:34:08.097]  Biden says 85% of American households will get direct checks from the American Rescue Plan.
[01:34:08.097 --> 01:34:09.297]  How did he get that number?
[01:34:09.297 --> 01:34:10.018]  Nobody knows.
[01:34:10.018 --> 01:34:10.858]  He doesn't even know.
[01:34:10.858 --> 01:34:14.040]  Pulled it out of his ass.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:16.582]  Oh, 85% he says.
[01:34:16.582 --> 01:34:17.662]  Well, what's the actual number?
[01:34:17.662 --> 01:34:21.465]  So, how can they, because they've never crunched these numbers.
[01:34:21.465 --> 01:34:22.205]  You couldn't even do it.
[01:34:22.205 --> 01:34:25.407]  It would take years.
[01:34:25.407 --> 01:34:28.509]  How would you be able to crunch the numbers where they're claiming
[01:34:29.346 --> 01:34:54.794]  If you made less than $75,000 in the year 2019, which, by the way, is before the pandemic even started, yeah, showers money, ends poverty, is what all the mainstream media headlines are saying about this stimulus theft, this trillion dollar theft, this putting a large debt on the future Americans, just destroying any future prosperity.
[01:34:54.794 --> 01:34:56.875]  But how are they going to do this math?
[01:34:56.875 --> 01:34:57.815]  They obviously never did it.
[01:34:58.621 --> 01:35:06.342]  When they say, if you made less than $75,000 in 2019, then you qualify for the $1,400 stimulus check.
[01:35:06.342 --> 01:35:07.083]  Well, okay.
[01:35:07.083 --> 01:35:08.623]  So have they crunched those numbers?
[01:35:08.623 --> 01:35:10.523]  Do they know how many people made less than that?
[01:35:10.523 --> 01:35:12.404]  No, that would take years to do.
[01:35:12.404 --> 01:35:15.804]  So they never even did that.
[01:35:15.804 --> 01:35:24.166]  And since they didn't do that, how do they know the exact dollar amount of monies that needs to be doled out to these individuals that made less than $75,000
[01:35:26.289 --> 01:35:33.613]  And then how would they be able to take that exact amount of money and put it into the stimulus bill if they don't even have it?
[01:35:33.613 --> 01:35:35.534]  Because they aren't going to do it.
[01:35:35.534 --> 01:35:36.774]  They never did do it.
[01:35:36.774 --> 01:35:39.476]  It was all a lie.
[01:35:39.476 --> 01:35:41.397]  Nobody crunched those numbers.
[01:35:41.397 --> 01:35:48.540]  Nobody went in and said, okay, here's the amount of people that didn't make $75,000, and here's how they're all going to be doled out their $1,400 checks.
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:49.300]  That never happened.
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:50.241]  It was another big lie.
[01:35:51.511 --> 01:35:58.794]  And so for Biden to say 85% of American households will get direct checks from the American Rescue Plan, that is a lie.
[01:35:58.794 --> 01:36:01.655]  That is a lie.
[01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:03.336]  And when are you going to get this check?
[01:36:03.336 --> 01:36:06.477]  I don't know.
[01:36:06.477 --> 01:36:09.499]  That'll be interesting to find out.
[01:36:09.499 --> 01:36:19.403]  So I encourage you, do a little experiment, if or when this money is ever doled out, and find out if 85% of households that you know got
[01:36:20.905 --> 01:36:22.766]  Checks from the American Rescue Plan.
[01:36:22.766 --> 01:36:24.927]  But think about this.
[01:36:24.927 --> 01:36:27.548]  Forget about whether you're going to get that $1,400 check or not.
[01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:30.309]  You probably won't.
[01:36:30.309 --> 01:36:42.595]  Of the five, so $5 trillion, $5 trillion in theft, oh, stimulus, $5 trillion in stimulus has been signed by our Congress in the last 12 months.
[01:36:42.595 --> 01:36:43.935]  So less than a year.
[01:36:43.935 --> 01:36:44.476]  $5 trillion.
[01:36:46.187 --> 01:36:56.214]  Now, if they gave direct cash payments to every American citizen, everybody listening to this broadcast, and not listening to this broadcast that's an American citizen, would receive $42,000.
[01:36:56.214 --> 01:36:56.354]  $42,000.
[01:36:56.354 --> 01:37:03.079]  That's how much they've stolen.
[01:37:03.079 --> 01:37:06.041]  That's how much debt they've put on everyone's head in the last year.
[01:37:06.041 --> 01:37:06.061]  $42,000.
[01:37:06.061 --> 01:37:07.642]  Now, did you get a dime of that?
[01:37:13.957 --> 01:37:18.383]  Are you even going to be lucky enough to get a $1,400 check from the government?
[01:37:18.383 --> 01:37:19.845]  Probably not.
[01:37:19.845 --> 01:37:23.769]  They could have given you $42,000 a head, but it was never about you.
[01:37:23.769 --> 01:37:29.336]  It was always about them.
[01:37:29.336 --> 01:37:32.741]  So, once again, we congratulate the United States Congress.
[01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:39.236]  Guys, we need to contact whoever made that list of the biggest money heist of all time, and we need to tell them you're missing it.
[01:37:39.236 --> 01:37:46.464]  The United States Congress in the years 2020 and 2021 stole $5 trillion.
[01:37:46.464 --> 01:37:53.111]  Stole $5 trillion from future Americans to enrich themselves, and they didn't even share a dime of it.
[01:37:54.412 --> 01:38:02.478]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[01:38:02.478 --> 01:38:03.559]  It is Down-N-Out.
[01:38:03.559 --> 01:38:05.360]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:08.342]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[01:38:08.342 --> 01:38:11.404]  It's got 4 milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[01:38:11.404 --> 01:38:13.966]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[01:38:13.966 --> 01:38:17.609]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[01:38:17.609 --> 01:38:19.490]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm.
[01:38:19.970 --> 01:38:22.631]  And 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[01:38:22.631 --> 01:38:25.232]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:28.293]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[01:38:28.293 --> 01:38:30.654]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[01:38:30.654 --> 01:38:32.715]  If you take it subliminally under the tongue, oh!
[01:38:32.715 --> 01:38:34.436]  Talk about blasting off to sleep.
[01:38:34.436 --> 01:38:35.136]  It's incredible.
[01:38:35.136 --> 01:38:37.657]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[01:38:37.657 --> 01:38:40.138]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.
[01:38:40.138 --> 01:38:44.660]  Get yours today, down and out, exclusively at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:47.141]  40% off, out of the gates, with free shipping, while supplies last.
[01:38:54.567 --> 01:38:58.310]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[01:38:58.310 --> 01:39:02.033]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[01:39:02.033 --> 01:39:04.635]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[01:39:05.285 --> 01:39:09.670]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[01:39:09.670 --> 01:39:15.435]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[01:39:15.435 --> 01:39:27.027]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[01:39:27.647 --> 01:39:29.768]  I need your help more than ever now.
[01:39:29.768 --> 01:39:33.890]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[01:39:33.890 --> 01:39:44.495]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:39:44.495 --> 01:39:54.040]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:54.680]  Thank you so much.
[01:39:56.693 --> 01:40:02.895]  Every product you hear me on air advertising, we have in stock in our warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[01:40:02.895 --> 01:40:04.056]  Every product.
[01:40:04.056 --> 01:40:05.196]  So if you order it, we've got it.
[01:40:05.196 --> 01:40:06.257]  It ships out in a couple days.
[01:40:06.257 --> 01:40:08.097]  Sometimes it's the same day.
[01:40:08.097 --> 01:40:15.300]  Listeners get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain's breaking down and it's future orders.
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:20.002]  It's product we're trying to reorder to get back in that we're having trouble with.
[01:40:20.002 --> 01:40:23.443]  I mean, I'm talking about double, triple, quadruple delivery times.
[01:40:24.438 --> 01:40:29.163]  And it's across, not just the supplement vitamin mineral industry, it's across every industry.
[01:40:29.163 --> 01:40:32.707]  So the globalists have successfully devastated the economy.
[01:40:33.937 --> 01:40:35.958]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[01:40:35.958 --> 01:40:37.119]  It's very bittersweet.
[01:40:37.119 --> 01:40:39.961]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[01:41:03.268 --> 01:41:04.529]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[01:41:04.529 --> 01:41:05.450]  But I don't care about that.
[01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:07.491]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[01:41:07.491 --> 01:41:12.194]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[01:41:12.194 --> 01:41:15.556]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[01:41:15.556 --> 01:41:17.077]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[01:41:17.077 --> 01:41:18.258]  But let's just say this.
[01:41:18.258 --> 01:41:19.579]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[01:41:19.579 --> 01:41:22.041]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[01:41:22.661 --> 01:41:26.303]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[01:41:26.303 --> 01:41:28.884]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[01:41:28.884 --> 01:41:32.065]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[01:41:32.065 --> 01:41:32.925]  Do they fund freedom?
[01:41:32.925 --> 01:41:34.046]  No, a lot of them don't.
[01:41:34.046 --> 01:41:40.488]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[01:41:40.488 --> 01:41:42.209]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[01:41:42.209 --> 01:41:45.050]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:48.752]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[01:41:48.752 --> 01:41:57.917]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[01:41:57.917 --> 01:42:00.519]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:42:19.017 --> 01:42:29.224]  We are truly witnessing, perhaps, the most corrupt criminal cabal on an international planetary scale in human history.
[01:42:29.224 --> 01:42:31.326]  It's really incredible, isn't it?
[01:42:31.326 --> 01:42:33.207]  Now, these people will fall.
[01:42:33.207 --> 01:42:39.052]  They will lose, eventually, but we may have to deal with their plans for us before that happens.
[01:42:40.091 --> 01:42:46.015]  But it's getting really bad when Biden, they have to put Biden in, the guy that can't think, the guy that can't talk.
[01:42:46.015 --> 01:42:48.737]  And then you have Pelosi, like, who's the real president.
[01:42:48.737 --> 01:42:51.039]  Pelosi's actually the one pulling the strings behind the scenes.
[01:42:51.039 --> 01:42:54.381]  Kamala's doing all the foreign diplomatic phone calls.
[01:42:54.381 --> 01:42:56.222]  Biden is just a puppet.
[01:42:56.222 --> 01:42:57.804]  He has no idea what's even going on.
[01:42:57.804 --> 01:43:02.006]  So it's really just incredible to be living through this and witnessing this.
[01:43:02.006 --> 01:43:09.632]  And then it's, like, even more surreal to actually be the tip of the spear in the information war against it, knowing they have the long guns out for us.
[01:43:10.916 --> 01:43:22.001]  And, you know, someday, hopefully, if we can be victorious and we can get these people off of our necks, you know, maybe we'll tell the stories of everything that happens around here behind the scenes that you wouldn't even believe.
[01:43:22.001 --> 01:43:24.542]  But we live to fight another day.
[01:43:24.542 --> 01:43:28.063]  Thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:28.063 --> 01:43:31.024]  We live to fight another day for now.
[01:43:31.024 --> 01:43:33.345]  Let me just say, we've got breaking news coming out now.
[01:43:33.345 --> 01:43:33.826]  30 women
[01:43:36.988 --> 01:43:41.932]  30 women, InfoWars, Tomorrow's News Today, yours truly, called this months ago.
[01:43:41.932 --> 01:43:47.917]  30 women have now come out and accused Cuomo of harassment.
[01:43:47.917 --> 01:43:51.300]  30 women.
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:58.986]  And now Boylan, the original accuser, said that Cuomo is the most dangerous man right now.
[01:43:58.986 --> 01:43:59.206]  It's Cuomo.
[01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:08.812]  And you also have 11 House Democrats who have called on Cuomo to resign.
[01:44:08.812 --> 01:44:18.175]  The only one of them, to her credit, the only one of them that mentioned the nursing home death scandal was AOC.
[01:44:18.175 --> 01:44:20.496]  None of the others mentioned that in their statements.
[01:44:20.496 --> 01:44:25.338]  So hey, look, you know, AOC, maybe she's learning a thing or two for the first time in her life.
[01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:31.294]  And she's also working with Matt Gaetz to end the war on drugs, at least on marijuana.
[01:44:31.294 --> 01:44:33.155]  So good on her for those two things.
[01:44:33.155 --> 01:44:36.118]  I guess a commie gets it right every once in a while.
[01:44:36.118 --> 01:44:40.422]  But, you know, I might as well just, I might as well just stay on this now that I'm here.
[01:44:40.422 --> 01:44:47.508]  So, guys, because this was just breaking, and I guess there was some sort of like group interview conducted.
[01:44:48.539 --> 01:44:49.180]  Guys, plug it in.
[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:52.102]  Let's see if anybody's publishing any stories on this yet.
[01:44:52.102 --> 01:44:53.844]  30 women accusing Cuomo.
[01:44:53.844 --> 01:45:03.092]  Or just find out what the latest news on Cuomo is, because I'm sure there's been something new published since I was doing my prep here for the show.
[01:45:03.092 --> 01:45:05.875]  But you've got 11 Democrats calling on Cuomo to resign now.
[01:45:05.875 --> 01:45:08.437]  Nadler amongst them.
[01:45:08.437 --> 01:45:13.262]  And most names you wouldn't have heard of, but Nadler and Ocasio-Cortez.
[01:45:13.965 --> 01:45:19.067]  And again, of the 11, Ocasio-Cortez is the only one that mentions the nursing home death scandal.
[01:45:19.067 --> 01:45:20.507]  Uh, the Cuomo death.
[01:45:20.507 --> 01:45:24.209]  The nursing home slayer, uh, Cuomo.
[01:45:24.209 --> 01:45:25.269]  I mean, just the psycho.
[01:45:25.269 --> 01:45:29.191]  I mean, you just, you look in that guy's eyes and it's psycho.
[01:45:29.191 --> 01:45:34.293]  Like, he should be, he's the American psycho from the movie.
[01:45:34.293 --> 01:45:37.974]  So it's only gonna get worse for him, but he says he's not going anywhere.
[01:45:37.974 --> 01:45:41.055]  And he's, he's saying he's innocent of all of these charges.
[01:45:41.055 --> 01:45:42.316]  What happened to Believe All Women?
[01:45:42.316 --> 01:45:43.276]  Remember that one?
[01:45:44.142 --> 01:45:47.823]  Again, showing you the total fraud.
[01:45:47.823 --> 01:45:51.685]  Okay, so the crew is just pulling up all the latest.
[01:45:51.685 --> 01:45:54.625]  So we'll see when all this comes out, but you watch.
[01:45:54.625 --> 01:45:58.327]  This number is going to be skyrocketing.
[01:45:58.327 --> 01:46:00.447]  Just watch over the next week.
[01:46:00.447 --> 01:46:03.508]  This number is going to be skyrocketing.
[01:46:03.508 --> 01:46:07.570]  So I don't know what the official number is, but I'm telling you it's dozens, folks.
[01:46:07.570 --> 01:46:08.110]  It's dozens.
[01:46:10.518 --> 01:46:13.802]  But again, showing you the fraud of the Democrat Party.
[01:46:13.802 --> 01:46:15.544]  Oh, believe all women!
[01:46:15.544 --> 01:46:16.145]  Me too!
[01:46:16.145 --> 01:46:21.291]  Remember Kamala Harris on the stage during the presidential debates for the Democrat Party?
[01:46:21.291 --> 01:46:25.215]  Remember she said she believed the women that accused Joe Biden?
[01:46:25.215 --> 01:46:27.318]  Remember that?
[01:46:27.318 --> 01:46:29.300]  Boy, she dropped that act real fast.
[01:46:30.077 --> 01:46:41.765]  Or maybe it was a Machiavellian move by her to shoehorn her way into the Vice Presidency saying, I will bring down Biden for the sexual harassment claims or you're making me the Vice President.
[01:46:41.765 --> 01:46:44.006]  Because everything switched after that.
[01:46:44.006 --> 01:46:47.969]  She came after Biden, said she believes the accusers like Tara Reid.
[01:46:47.969 --> 01:46:51.371]  She then dropped out of the race before a single vote was cast.
[01:46:51.371 --> 01:46:53.452]  And then she became Biden's Vice President.
[01:46:53.452 --> 01:46:54.513]  So I think we know how that worked.
[01:46:56.071 --> 01:47:02.033]  Oh, but the claims against Cuomo, Me Too, he says he believes all women, but now he doesn't because they're accusing him.
[01:47:02.033 --> 01:47:04.073]  See how that works?
[01:47:04.073 --> 01:47:08.975]  And so now, the Me Too movement is fractured badly.
[01:47:08.975 --> 01:47:11.135]  It's really dead in its cracks.
[01:47:11.135 --> 01:47:19.137]  Inside the, this is from Vice, inside the Me Too scandal that's tearing Time's Up apart, Time's Up is the original group that launched the Me Too movement.
[01:47:19.137 --> 01:47:25.059]  So all the money they've raised, all the activism they've done, has all been brought to nothing.
[01:47:26.115 --> 01:47:36.561]  Because it's ironic, because the whole MeToo movement was started to hurt President Trump and help the Democrat Party politically, and it turns out it's all been Democrats that have been haunted by the MeToo movement.
[01:47:36.561 --> 01:47:45.586]  Bill Clinton, Harvey Weinstein, Franken, Al Franken, Andrew Cuomo, the list goes on and on.
[01:47:45.586 --> 01:47:46.167]  Fairfax,
[01:47:47.879 --> 01:47:49.160]  So, I mean, the list goes on and on.
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:54.243]  So the MeToo movement is dead because it was started as a political weapon against Trump.
[01:47:54.243 --> 01:47:55.384]  Trump's out of office.
[01:47:55.384 --> 01:47:56.825]  It's only hurt the Democrats.
[01:47:56.825 --> 01:47:59.207]  So now MeToo is dead.
[01:47:59.207 --> 01:48:00.208]  It was never about women.
[01:48:00.208 --> 01:48:02.569]  It was never about survivors.
[01:48:02.569 --> 01:48:12.136]  It was always about politics, just like every other big lie that the Democrats and their media cohorts tell you.
[01:48:12.136 --> 01:48:15.298]  These people can't help themselves.
[01:48:16.454 --> 01:48:19.795]  From lying every day.
[01:48:19.795 --> 01:48:27.817]  But so this is part of the Democrat policy that ends up coming back to bite them.
[01:48:27.817 --> 01:48:32.218]  And perhaps here are some others.
[01:48:32.218 --> 01:48:34.819]  See, because black Americans are getting sick of this too.
[01:48:37.805 --> 01:48:39.266]  This whole critical race theory.
[01:48:39.266 --> 01:48:47.673]  You saw a woman in Ohio yesterday scold a school board, a black lady, scold a school board for critical race theory, making kids racist.
[01:48:47.673 --> 01:49:06.609]  There was a lady on Fox News last night, I forget, a black lady, but she's married to a white guy, and so their son has white skin, looks like Meghan Markle, and she says that her son gets bullied at school because he's white, but has a black mother, and so he's white because he gets bullied from he's white, then when he's like, my mom's black, they bully him even more.
[01:49:07.998 --> 01:49:10.059]  So it's all Democrat policy.
[01:49:10.059 --> 01:49:16.361]  Black Naval Academy grad slams paternalistic white liberals demanding lower standards for elite high school.
[01:49:16.361 --> 01:49:18.722]  And so what have they done?
[01:49:18.722 --> 01:49:29.385]  Well, they have testing programs that put you into either elite learning schools or they put you into different learning curriculums inside the schools.
[01:49:30.325 --> 01:49:33.607]  I remember when I was at school, it was called A-track, B-track, C-track.
[01:49:33.607 --> 01:49:40.671]  Basically, when you take the test before the school year, if you test the highest, you go into A-track, and then B-track, C-track, and so on.
[01:49:40.671 --> 01:49:59.581]  And so, they found out that when they looked at the demographics of these tests, that it was mostly white people, or Asians, that were getting into the elite high schools, and getting into the A-track classes, if you will, and so they said, this is racist, we're canceling all of it.
[01:50:02.367 --> 01:50:10.253]  And so, I could sit here and talk about how this has destroyed higher education, but understand, black people don't like this.
[01:50:10.253 --> 01:50:11.253]  Nobody likes this.
[01:50:11.253 --> 01:50:18.118]  Again, it's all Democrat Party policy to virtue signal, and it actually hurts society.
[01:50:18.118 --> 01:50:23.842]  In fact, let me segue into that, because that was my point here.
[01:50:23.842 --> 01:50:25.784]  And I'll come back on this later with other news, but
[01:50:26.850 --> 01:50:30.533]  In the UK, stunning images are coming out on the lunch program.
[01:50:30.533 --> 01:50:34.237]  It's kind of like Michelle Obama's lunch program that looked like dog food.
[01:50:34.237 --> 01:50:39.781]  Unacceptable school meal with half raw potato slammed as Marcus Rashford shares pick.
[01:50:39.781 --> 01:50:42.183]  And so here's what's going on.
[01:50:42.183 --> 01:50:51.932]  Here's what happens when liberal policy destroys actual prosperity and actual free markets and real legitimate competition.
[01:50:51.932 --> 01:50:54.154]  You just destroy the morale
[01:50:55.061 --> 01:50:56.902]  Of your entire community.
[01:50:56.902 --> 01:50:58.843]  You destroy the morale of your entire country.
[01:50:58.843 --> 01:50:59.683]  So what happens?
[01:50:59.683 --> 01:51:05.285]  So police become a joke, lunch programs become a joke, media becomes a joke, because nobody cares!
[01:51:05.285 --> 01:51:08.247]  Everything's falling apart!
[01:51:08.247 --> 01:51:18.011]  It's kind of like, um, I forget there was a study, I remember in college we talked about this, but basically, you know, because college students tend to be a bit sloppy, but basically it was,
[01:51:18.937 --> 01:51:41.089]  If you have people in a household, and I remember experiencing this when I had roommates, if you have people in a household and one of the individuals is really sloppy, but the other two are really neat, even when outnumbered, the sloppy individual ends up having more influence on the state of the household than the neat individuals.
[01:51:42.842 --> 01:51:44.724]  The household ends up being dirty.
[01:51:44.724 --> 01:51:46.585]  Say you have five people in a household.
[01:51:46.585 --> 01:51:48.547]  One of them is a sloppy dirtball.
[01:51:48.547 --> 01:51:54.152]  It ends up, the whole house ends up becoming sloppy dirtballs because the other people that like it clean, they just can't.
[01:51:54.152 --> 01:51:54.872]  It's always dirty.
[01:51:54.872 --> 01:51:55.453]  It's always dirty.
[01:51:55.453 --> 01:51:56.994]  So they just give up.
[01:51:56.994 --> 01:51:59.656]  They just give up and it just all falls apart.
[01:51:59.656 --> 01:52:01.378]  Well, this happens on the big scale too.
[01:52:02.944 --> 01:52:04.444]  So when they collapse the U.S.
[01:52:04.444 --> 01:52:13.447]  border, when they say everything is racist, when they endure and enforce their cancel culture, eventually all of society just gives up, just doesn't care.
[01:52:13.447 --> 01:52:16.647]  Oh, they're going to pass a $5 trillion stimulus and pay themselves off?
[01:52:16.647 --> 01:52:18.688]  Well screw it, I'll be a criminal.
[01:52:18.688 --> 01:52:21.889]  I'll steal, I'll cheat, I'll lie.
[01:52:21.889 --> 01:52:23.309]  So the same thing happens in the UK.
[01:52:23.309 --> 01:52:26.990]  So they destroy the UK, they destroy its culture, they destroy its police force,
[01:52:28.321 --> 01:52:29.762]  They're just ending it all.
[01:52:29.762 --> 01:52:32.864]  And so, the people in the lunch program that feed the kids, they don't give a damn.
[01:52:32.864 --> 01:52:36.346]  Yeah, half-cooked potato, raw this, raw that, we don't care.
[01:52:36.346 --> 01:52:37.766]  Our entire country is falling apart.
[01:52:37.766 --> 01:52:39.227]  Civilization is falling apart.
[01:52:39.227 --> 01:52:40.208]  Eat a half-raw potato.
[01:52:40.208 --> 01:52:44.350]  I don't give a damn anyway.
[01:52:44.350 --> 01:52:48.292]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[01:52:48.292 --> 01:52:50.914]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[01:52:50.914 --> 01:52:51.654]  Why do you do that?
[01:52:51.654 --> 01:52:54.596]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[01:52:54.596 --> 01:52:56.417]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say,
[01:52:57.423 --> 01:53:05.551]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[01:53:06.201 --> 01:53:06.441]  Boom.
[01:53:06.441 --> 01:53:06.841]  We did it.
[01:53:06.841 --> 01:53:07.342]  It's popular.
[01:53:07.342 --> 01:53:08.122]  It's X3.
[01:53:08.122 --> 01:53:08.782]  Is it better than X2?
[01:53:08.782 --> 01:53:10.023]  You decide.
[01:53:10.023 --> 01:53:11.483]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[01:53:11.483 --> 01:53:17.246]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleep aid.
[01:53:17.246 --> 01:53:18.686]  And that is down and out.
[01:53:18.686 --> 01:53:19.927]  It's super strong.
[01:53:19.927 --> 01:53:21.807]  Way stronger than knockout.
[01:53:21.807 --> 01:53:23.368]  But they don't compete with each other.
[01:53:23.368 --> 01:53:25.249]  Different strokes for different folks.
[01:53:25.249 --> 01:53:26.069]  Different formulas.
[01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:27.730]  And it's 40% off.
[01:53:27.730 --> 01:53:28.210]  Out of the gates.
[01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:30.531]  At InfoWareStore.com and free shipping.
[01:53:30.531 --> 01:53:34.954]  Secure your down-and-out today and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the InfoWare at the same time.
[01:53:34.954 --> 01:53:38.936]  Down-and-out, exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com for 40% off and free shipping.
[01:53:45.419 --> 01:53:49.263]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[01:53:49.263 --> 01:53:53.587]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[01:53:53.587 --> 01:54:01.714]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:54:02.455 --> 01:54:19.064]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:54:19.064 --> 01:54:30.110]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:39.073]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[01:54:39.073 --> 01:54:48.876]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:54:48.876 --> 01:54:51.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:15.889 --> 01:55:22.414]  Ladies and gentlemen, never forget about band.video, where there's so much great content, a lot we don't even get to hear on air.
[01:55:22.414 --> 01:55:28.239]  Like, for example, Gregory's special reports, John Bowne's special reports, other special reports, some fun stuff we do.
[01:55:28.239 --> 01:55:29.680]  Here's the latest report from Gregory.
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:34.544]  It's a very powerful piece about the global tyranny we are now going under.
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:41.125]  If you want to know the enemy, read their agenda in their own documents.
[01:55:41.125 --> 01:55:54.956]  In their weekly Strategic Intelligence Newsletter, the World Economic Forum spotlighted the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which they define as a fundamental change in the ways we live and work.
[01:55:56.093 --> 01:56:06.760]  Merging the physical, digital, and biological worlds and fusing technologies in ways that create both promise and peril.
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:13.804]  They link to a library of articles on the subject and give us the trending top five.
[01:56:13.804 --> 01:56:20.428]  Requiring vaccine passports for certain activities, discrimination, or behavioral change.
[01:56:21.588 --> 01:56:29.213]  Except when the subject of discrimination comes up, it has nothing to do with a person's rights not to be vaccinated.
[01:56:29.213 --> 01:56:35.457]  The so-called discrimination has to do with lower-income countries not getting the jab until 2022.
[01:56:35.457 --> 01:56:43.782]  The doublespeak is that not getting a vaccine for an imaginary virus is discrimination.
[01:56:45.231 --> 01:57:04.097]  The author, Joan Costa-Iffant, an associate professor of political science at the London School of Economics, writes that taking a vaccine is pro-social behavior, and described those who would refuse a vaccine as vaccine-resistant.
[01:57:04.097 --> 01:57:13.500]  Costa-Iffant went on to describe these people as contrarians, stating that their very existence might be healthy for the rest of us.
[01:57:14.466 --> 01:57:22.373]  And that vaccine passports would change their behavior by forcing them to get vaccinated if they wanted to travel.
[01:57:22.373 --> 01:57:31.781]  Kosey Font wrote that those who comply do so to virtue signal, and that this should be used as a way to push the vaccine passport.
[01:57:31.781 --> 01:57:40.749]  And if anyone thinks he's concerned about a dangerous pandemic, he also wrote that the use of passports should be limited to non-essential services.
[01:57:42.026 --> 01:57:54.416]  The next article, written by senior executive at Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, warns that the world has only 10 years to change course before ultimate climate disaster.
[01:57:54.416 --> 01:58:05.505]  And the only way to save the world is to give government leaders oversight of policy, regulation, and research and development of all the world's industry.
[01:58:06.628 --> 01:58:13.953]  Sounds like old school communism, but they are now calling it circularity.
[01:58:13.953 --> 01:58:26.901]  In The Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccines is Linked to Good Nutrition, the author admits that a healthy diet and nutrition will strengthen the immune system and protect a person from infection.
[01:58:26.901 --> 01:58:34.666]  But the efficacy to be concerned about is how malnutrition can affect the quality of immune response to vaccination.
[01:58:35.899 --> 01:58:43.582]  And what is of utmost importance is providing information on COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:58:43.582 --> 01:58:48.704]  A boring article on carbon revenue and the redistribution of wealth.
[01:58:48.704 --> 01:58:53.466]  And finally, how happiness, anger, and anxiety can help you negotiate.
[01:58:54.244 --> 01:59:09.197]  Which speaks to their mentally ill communist cult selling the anti-human agenda on how it would be wise to reserve happiness and how anger can lead to gains by soliciting concessions from the counterpart.
[01:59:09.197 --> 01:59:13.320]  However, the anger must be deeply felt.
[01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:21.387]  The World Economic Forum is indeed a weird cult of big bank multinational corporation weirdos.
[01:59:21.387 --> 01:59:22.488]  But this is reality.
[01:59:23.459 --> 01:59:31.342]  Without any sort of resistance, this global communist model is what's coming to your new normal.
[01:59:31.342 --> 01:59:35.103]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:59:35.103 --> 01:59:38.305]  And, of course, that can be found at Band.Video.
[01:59:38.305 --> 01:59:49.829]  All brought to you by the World Economic Forum that has 666, the mark of the beast, in its logo, telling you, it's evil, we are Satan, but accept us anyway.
[01:59:53.377 --> 01:59:57.401]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[01:59:57.401 --> 02:00:00.404]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[02:00:00.404 --> 02:00:03.026]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[02:00:03.026 --> 02:00:06.029]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[02:00:06.029 --> 02:00:09.632]  That's why Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:00:09.632 --> 02:00:11.935]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies.
[02:00:12.575 --> 02:00:18.820]  Are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:21.982]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals.
[02:00:21.982 --> 02:00:23.103]  Because it's so simple.
[02:00:23.103 --> 02:00:25.084]  Because you won't be under their control anymore.
[02:00:25.084 --> 02:00:33.971]  Well, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the highest quality Vitamin Mineral Fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form, is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:00:33.971 --> 02:00:36.292]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[02:00:36.292 --> 02:00:39.435]  It funds the Info War at the same time.
[02:00:39.435 --> 02:00:41.316]  No other product you can buy does that.
[02:00:41.716 --> 02:00:43.638]  So again, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:00:43.638 --> 02:00:45.700]  It's back in stock, 50% off.
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:46.761]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:00:46.761 --> 02:00:49.183]  I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[02:00:49.183 --> 02:00:57.930]  So take action today and give it to your friends and family as a gift.
[02:00:57.930 --> 02:01:03.415]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Troyer.
[02:01:03.415 --> 02:01:06.238]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:07.153 --> 02:01:09.955]  Alright, we've got a report coming up from Alex in the next segment.
[02:01:09.955 --> 02:01:15.358]  In the meantime though, I'm gonna drink this Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:01:15.358 --> 02:01:20.942]  It's so delicious.
[02:01:20.942 --> 02:01:22.483]  My favorite coffee.
[02:01:22.483 --> 02:01:27.026]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:01:27.026 --> 02:01:29.207]  Get your coffee from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:01:29.207 --> 02:01:30.508]  Support the Info War.
[02:01:32.754 --> 02:01:38.297]  All right, I'm just going to do a news blitz here and just pile drive through the rest of this news before the Alex report comes up.
[02:01:38.297 --> 02:01:42.859]  And if I can get through all of it, maybe we can take a couple segments for your phone calls.
[02:01:42.859 --> 02:01:46.601]  And I also imagine I'll just open up the War Room today at 3 o'clock p.m.
[02:01:46.601 --> 02:01:52.584]  Central and just open that up for phone calls, too, just because I'll already have covered all of this news.
[02:01:52.584 --> 02:01:55.545]  But let me get focused here and just pile drive through the rest of this news here.
[02:01:58.266 --> 02:02:09.830]  From Infowars.com, translator of Biden's inauguration poem says he was kicked off project because he's not black or female.
[02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:14.891]  So eventually, I guess that means Biden will step aside because he's a white male too.
[02:02:14.891 --> 02:02:22.954]  But in a funnier translator translation event, oh man, I forget the lady's name.
[02:02:22.954 --> 02:02:25.754]  Guys, see if you can find this.
[02:02:25.754 --> 02:02:27.655]  It was either yesterday or Wednesday.
[02:02:28.713 --> 02:02:38.815]  A member from the Biden team is addressing the issue at the southern border, and at the end of the address says, in English, the border is not open.
[02:02:38.815 --> 02:02:40.556]  The border is not open.
[02:02:40.556 --> 02:02:50.118]  And then, in Spanish, to speak to the Hispanic audience, or the people that speak Spanish, and then so she tries to speak in Spanish, and she says, the border is not closed.
[02:02:52.142 --> 02:02:55.485]  So was that intentional to tell people to come in?
[02:02:55.485 --> 02:02:57.366]  Or was it a slip-up?
[02:02:57.366 --> 02:03:03.672]  And she says that the border is not closed accidentally because she can't speak Spanish.
[02:03:03.672 --> 02:03:05.513]  Yeah, there it is right there.
[02:03:05.513 --> 02:03:07.555]  Again though, in that story they're not telling you.
[02:03:07.555 --> 02:03:14.260]  When she does the Spanish translation, she tells people in Spanish that the border is not closed.
[02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:15.301]  Not very bright.
[02:03:15.301 --> 02:03:16.182]  These characters
[02:03:16.932 --> 02:03:18.573]  That the Biden administration has put in.
[02:03:18.573 --> 02:03:25.018]  And, you know, in my head last night, like, for example, the crew pulled up the picture of all the people from Antifa that have been arrested.
[02:03:25.018 --> 02:03:29.321]  I mean, look at this freak.
[02:03:29.321 --> 02:03:31.522]  Look at this freak.
[02:03:31.522 --> 02:03:36.906]  This is not, I'm telling you, every day goes by, I'm debating just going full on alien invasion.
[02:03:36.906 --> 02:03:40.089]  I mean, you look at these people, man, they don't look human.
[02:03:40.089 --> 02:03:42.150]  There's something off there.
[02:03:42.150 --> 02:03:44.732]  And so it's kind of like when you put together the mosaic
[02:03:46.121 --> 02:03:49.044]  Of all the Antifa in Portland, and they look alien.
[02:03:49.044 --> 02:03:50.585]  They don't even look human.
[02:03:50.585 --> 02:03:55.289]  You could do the same thing with all these top Democrats and all these Biden appointees.
[02:03:55.289 --> 02:03:56.349]  They don't look human.
[02:03:56.349 --> 02:03:59.952]  There's something off there.
[02:03:59.952 --> 02:04:02.795]  Even Biden doesn't look like he's there.
[02:04:02.795 --> 02:04:03.796]  But he has in the past.
[02:04:03.796 --> 02:04:04.997]  But yeah, look at that.
[02:04:04.997 --> 02:04:10.381]  What is that?
[02:04:10.381 --> 02:04:12.443]  What is Rachel Devine?
[02:04:12.443 --> 02:04:13.924]  What is Nancy Pelosi?
[02:04:15.871 --> 02:04:19.994]  What are these freaks?
[02:04:19.994 --> 02:04:22.816]  Seriously, I'm almost to the point, these are just alien invasions.
[02:04:22.816 --> 02:04:25.257]  But it's like, you know, demons, demons possessing souls.
[02:04:25.257 --> 02:04:29.160]  Call it aliens, call it demons, call it whatever you want.
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:34.743]  These are demons, these are aliens, they're occupying human meat suits.
[02:04:34.743 --> 02:04:38.386]  Just like in They Live, the formaldehyde face.
[02:04:38.386 --> 02:04:43.349]  But it's getting so bad, they're beginning to get to the point where they don't even look human, folks.
[02:04:44.867 --> 02:04:47.850]  They don't even look human anymore.
[02:04:47.850 --> 02:04:57.217]  So the Biden team says that the border is open, whether accidentally or intentionally, I don't know.
[02:04:57.217 --> 02:05:04.223]  Meanwhile, over 80, excuse me, almost 9,000 child migrants in federal care facilities.
[02:05:04.223 --> 02:05:06.045]  Oh, I thought we were getting rid of the kids in cages.
[02:05:07.236 --> 02:05:08.617]  No, they're packed in.
[02:05:08.617 --> 02:05:09.978]  Facilities are overflowing.
[02:05:09.978 --> 02:05:13.820]  They now may have to open up a NASA facility in California.
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:20.625]  A giant NASA facility in California may have to be opened up now to take in all the illegal immigration overflow.
[02:05:20.625 --> 02:05:24.167]  And they stack them one on top of another, all testing positive for COVID.
[02:05:24.167 --> 02:05:26.008]  It's all good.
[02:05:26.008 --> 02:05:28.670]  It's all good, baby.
[02:05:28.670 --> 02:05:29.950]  Yeah.
[02:05:29.950 --> 02:05:32.792]  We want to stop COVID, but only if it's an American spreading it.
[02:05:32.792 --> 02:05:35.414]  If it's somebody who came across the southern border,
[02:05:36.365 --> 02:05:38.606]  Well, that's just fine.
[02:05:38.606 --> 02:05:53.255]  Speaking of a problem that they're having with migration in the UK, heartbreaking story, and it turns out this is a regular thing, which we kind of already knew, but this is just crazy.
[02:05:53.255 --> 02:05:58.578]  So it came out today in CNN and other outlets though.
[02:05:58.578 --> 02:06:02.700]  Police identify body of Sarah Everard who went missing in London.
[02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:03.421]  So this 33-year-old girl
[02:06:05.316 --> 02:06:06.877]  Walking around the streets of London.
[02:06:06.877 --> 02:06:08.578]  Disappears for days.
[02:06:08.578 --> 02:06:09.638]  Nobody knows where she is.
[02:06:09.638 --> 02:06:12.480]  They eventually find her dead body 50 miles from the scene.
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:15.881]  Obviously raped and tortured.
[02:06:15.881 --> 02:06:21.584]  And so you read into it a little bit and then you find out there's these other stories.
[02:06:21.584 --> 02:06:23.785]  No woman should live in fear of going out.
[02:06:23.785 --> 02:06:25.426]  It's time their voices were listened to.
[02:06:25.426 --> 02:06:27.307]  And that was in the mirror.
[02:06:27.307 --> 02:06:32.550]  Now remember, it was two or three years ago where you had the series of migrant rapes
[02:06:34.133 --> 02:06:57.066]  In Germany, in Sweden, in France, and so the response by the liberal politicians who let all the migrants who are in there raping people, and then the media says, well that's just their culture, so their culture is rape, and they want to culturally enrich you with their rape, and the Democrats are promoting all of it, and the liberals in the European Union are promoting all of it, and in the UK,
[02:06:59.309 --> 02:07:08.376]  And so, but remember when you had these series of migrant rapes that they said was just, oh, that's just their culture to come in here and rape you from North Africa or the Middle East.
[02:07:08.376 --> 02:07:09.196]  They just get to rape you.
[02:07:09.196 --> 02:07:10.197]  That's their culture.
[02:07:10.197 --> 02:07:14.620]  You don't get culture, but they do when they rape you.
[02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:24.687]  And so they said, well, we're going to give women now in Sweden bracelets that say, please don't rape me because that will stop the assailant.
[02:07:24.687 --> 02:07:27.069]  The migrant from North Africa or the Middle East
[02:07:27.748 --> 02:07:38.071]  Is getting ready to rape you, a woman in Sweden, and then you show your wristband and you say, no it says don't rape me, and they say, oh I'm sorry, I had no idea, I won't rape you now.
[02:07:38.071 --> 02:07:39.972]  That's their culture though, see?
[02:07:39.972 --> 02:07:46.014]  I'm not here to rape you, I'm here to culturally enrich you.
[02:07:46.014 --> 02:07:50.895]  So, it turns out, this is normal for women in Europe,
[02:07:52.020 --> 02:08:06.113]  They have fear going out in the streets, they have fear going out at night, they can't go out by themselves because they're afraid they're going to get raped and tortured by the migrant gangs that are roaming around the cities.
[02:08:06.113 --> 02:08:07.654]  Imagine that.
[02:08:07.654 --> 02:08:12.819]  Anti-rape wristbands, do they work?
[02:08:12.819 --> 02:08:14.801]  Is it a gun?
[02:08:14.801 --> 02:08:16.642]  No.
[02:08:16.642 --> 02:08:18.384]  A gun would work, but they don't want you to have a gun either.
[02:08:20.066 --> 02:08:24.249]  Because then you'd have to culturally enrich them before they culturally enrich you.
[02:08:24.249 --> 02:08:25.430]  And then the rape doesn't happen.
[02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:27.151]  And the Democrats and the Liberals don't want that.
[02:08:27.151 --> 02:08:33.075]  So it turns out in the UK, in Europe, women can't even walk the streets anymore.
[02:08:33.075 --> 02:08:34.436]  They can't go out alone.
[02:08:34.436 --> 02:08:37.799]  They're scared to death that they're going to get raped and tortured by migrants.
[02:08:37.799 --> 02:08:41.381]  Isn't that nice?
[02:08:41.381 --> 02:08:46.485]  Isn't that just wonderful, I say?
[02:08:46.485 --> 02:08:48.286]  But there's your anti-rape wristband.
[02:08:48.286 --> 02:08:49.507]  Yeah, that'll stop them.
[02:08:51.570 --> 02:08:54.412]  Congratulations.
[02:08:54.412 --> 02:08:57.474]  You now have an anti-rape wristband.
[02:08:57.474 --> 02:09:03.678]  Meanwhile, this is just hilarious.
[02:09:03.678 --> 02:09:13.685]  CNN publishes this story, you know, because it's all about victims, talking about during the pandemic, guys, I'm going to need a doc cam shot here because you're not even going to believe this, folks.
[02:09:15.271 --> 02:09:22.653]  Story on CNN about people struggling in California during the pandemic because the governor shut down and killed the economy so they're starving to death.
[02:09:22.653 --> 02:09:27.915]  Now, look at the image that CNN uses here for this story.
[02:09:27.915 --> 02:09:35.537]  Trying to humanize the struggle because of the fake pandemic all brought on by Democrat Party politics and Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci faking a pandemic.
[02:09:36.448 --> 02:09:39.429]  Sometimes we eat, sometimes we don't.
[02:09:39.429 --> 02:09:41.770]  Some families are struggling to eat during the pandemic.
[02:09:41.770 --> 02:09:47.292]  And folks, they show a lady on here who's at least 300 pounds.
[02:09:47.292 --> 02:09:50.353]  I mean, morbidly obese.
[02:09:50.353 --> 02:09:53.134]  Probably hasn't seen her undercarriage in decades.
[02:09:53.134 --> 02:09:55.474]  Excuse me.
[02:09:55.474 --> 02:09:57.515]  So this is what I'm saying, though.
[02:09:57.515 --> 02:09:58.415]  I've been saying this.
[02:09:58.415 --> 02:10:02.877]  The reason why you don't have a real uprising in America is because poor people are fat.
[02:10:04.346 --> 02:10:10.068]  If poor people are actually starving, then there would be legitimate uprisings like you see in communist countries.
[02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:12.469]  But see, what they've done here in America is smart.
[02:10:12.469 --> 02:10:19.251]  They've kept food prices down enough so that people can still be fat on the hog while living in poverty.
[02:10:19.251 --> 02:10:32.796]  And so they use this woman to virtue signal and say people are starving in the fake pandemic and the woman is over 300 pounds and morbidly obese and the number one risk for catching COVID.
[02:10:32.796 --> 02:10:33.736]  But it doesn't even stop there.
[02:10:35.811 --> 02:10:43.255]  You see these pictures of the refugees illegally crossing the southern border, and they're 500 pounds, too!
[02:10:43.255 --> 02:10:45.936]  And it says, a starving refugee checks her iPhone.
[02:10:45.936 --> 02:10:48.817]  Yeah, a starving, poor refugee that weighs 350 pounds and has an iPhone.
[02:10:52.483 --> 02:10:54.005]  The people are awakening.
[02:10:54.005 --> 02:10:56.727]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[02:10:56.727 --> 02:10:58.809]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[02:10:58.809 --> 02:11:01.151]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's hand-held.
[02:11:01.151 --> 02:11:07.758]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Comps especially, are using this.
[02:11:08.098 --> 02:11:19.403]  To steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[02:11:19.403 --> 02:11:26.086]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[02:11:26.086 --> 02:11:27.526]  In their own words, they admit it.
[02:11:27.526 --> 02:11:31.928]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[02:11:32.428 --> 02:11:34.370]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[02:11:34.370 --> 02:11:35.451]  They're Faraday cages.
[02:11:35.451 --> 02:11:37.153]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[02:11:37.153 --> 02:11:39.155]  They work absolutely great.
[02:11:39.155 --> 02:11:48.304]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.

[02:12:32.884 --> 02:12:35.404]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[02:12:35.404 --> 02:12:37.905]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.

[02:12:45.729 --> 02:12:47.252]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:13:03.337 --> 02:13:06.699]  And welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:06.699 --> 02:13:13.522]  This is a taped transmission I'm sending out to you, taped on this Friday morning, but Owen Schroeder is live on air right now.
[02:13:13.522 --> 02:13:15.363]  He'll be back in just a few minutes.
[02:13:15.363 --> 02:13:22.047]  But I have been encouraged by a lot of really smart people, formerly in the highest positions of U.S.
[02:13:22.047 --> 02:13:22.567]  intelligence,
[02:13:23.613 --> 02:13:27.476]  To take more of the videos where I predicted things in the past and to air those.
[02:13:27.476 --> 02:13:32.240]  And we have hundreds and hundreds of these that our archivist has been finding.
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:35.642]  Because at one level, I'm not trying to brag whenever I show these videos.
[02:13:35.642 --> 02:13:42.107]  It's so people understand that we really know what we're talking about then, we know what we're talking about now, and people should really listen.
[02:13:42.107 --> 02:13:51.214]  So, here are a bunch of excerpts from 2010 with myself and another really smart guy, Alan Watt, on the show.
[02:13:51.214 --> 02:13:52.735]  It's a seven-minute compilation.
[02:13:53.405 --> 02:13:56.354]  From 2010 on more than seven different dates.
[02:13:56.354 --> 02:13:59.443]  So if you're a radio listener, you'll hear a second or two pause.
[02:14:00.106 --> 02:14:02.208]  Between each clip, that's for TV viewers.
[02:14:02.208 --> 02:14:07.733]  We're showing the date of when this was broadcast, when this was transmitted.
[02:14:07.733 --> 02:14:14.900]  Now, the New World Order hopes in the future, when they're actually carrying out the total mass extermination, there'll be total AI censorship control of everybody.
[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:24.669]  And so, the only way these clips in the future, if they're successful, will be alive, is on hidden hard drives, DVDs, and things that you share in what is low-tech.
[02:14:25.678 --> 02:14:26.478]  Today.
[02:14:26.478 --> 02:14:34.560]  What is low-tech today in the future will be even more low-tech because the globals are about 20, 30, 40, 50 years, depending on the technology ahead of us.
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:42.122]  I don't want us to get to this point, but just like I didn't want 10 years ago for us to get to the point we're at now, we're on a path like a roadmap.
[02:14:42.122 --> 02:14:52.705]  Like if I'm driving down from Omaha, Nebraska, and then I know the big cities I'm going to go through, and then I'm going to hit Oklahoma City, and then next I'm going to hit Dallas, and next
[02:14:54.206 --> 02:14:55.406]  We're good to go.
[02:15:13.027 --> 02:15:14.589]  Again, I didn't envision all this.
[02:15:14.589 --> 02:15:16.030]  The globalists said they'd do it.
[02:15:16.030 --> 02:15:17.151]  It's a real plan.
[02:15:17.151 --> 02:15:18.493]  We're insane if we don't stop it.
[02:15:18.493 --> 02:15:20.355]  It's a post-human future.
[02:15:20.355 --> 02:15:27.702]  So here is 7-minute excerpts from 11 years ago of us laying this out right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:27.702 --> 02:15:29.144]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[02:15:29.144 --> 02:15:30.966]  Thanks for keeping us in attack formation.
[02:15:30.966 --> 02:15:34.009]  Without you, we would not even have this platform today to be able to warn the world.
[02:15:34.688 --> 02:15:50.439]  We have a psychotic group of eugenicists that openly say they want to brain damage us and make us servile ahead of just openly releasing megabio weapons to kill basically the majority of the population.
[02:15:50.439 --> 02:16:01.787]  All the eugenics and the soft kill that we've seen, again soft kill is something that kills you 20 years later, so you don't know what kills you, you don't know what caused the disease, you don't understand the underlying chemical or biological
[02:16:03.644 --> 02:16:14.313]  Precursors, or binary systems that mix together to create that degenerative disease.
[02:16:14.313 --> 02:16:16.455]  What does James Bond say to Goldfinger?
[02:16:16.455 --> 02:16:18.156]  He says, you expect me to talk?
[02:16:18.156 --> 02:16:20.398]  No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!
[02:16:20.398 --> 02:16:30.026]  This is about shutting us down, bankrupting us, and then coming in with the soft kill weapons.
[02:16:30.026 --> 02:16:31.788]  Bill Joy, why the future doesn't need us?
[02:16:33.564 --> 02:16:38.509]  And he has a meeting with several hundred top technology leaders and owners and they just said, they had a discussion.
[02:16:38.509 --> 02:16:39.790]  Do we kill everybody?
[02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:41.332]  We don't need them anymore?
[02:16:41.332 --> 02:16:44.555]  Or do we give them mindless games and entertainment?
[02:16:44.555 --> 02:16:49.080]  And the decision is basically soft kill you, slowly sterilize you and get rid of your generations that way.
[02:16:53.385 --> 02:16:59.987]  All these eugenicists, all these scientists that think they're saving the earth by dumbing people down ahead of the mass culling.
[02:16:59.987 --> 02:17:11.489]  They first got to render you servile and drugged, so when they release the mega-plagues and start killing everybody, you've heard Dr. Pianka say, coming soon, and he got a standing ovation at the Texas Academy of Sciences.
[02:17:11.489 --> 02:17:13.730]  It went on for minutes, the paper reported.
[02:17:13.730 --> 02:17:14.250]  Remember that?
[02:17:14.250 --> 02:17:16.350]  We talked about it, it became national news.
[02:17:16.350 --> 02:17:19.211]  He goes to Europe and gets awards from the royalty over there.
[02:17:19.921 --> 02:17:28.389]  He projected red skulls on the wall of PowerPoint and said, the time is coming when we will 90% die when the airborne Ebola comes.
[02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:31.132]  I am sad for my family, but it's good for the Earth.
[02:17:31.132 --> 02:17:31.952]  We will die.
[02:17:31.952 --> 02:17:34.295]  It is going to be beautiful.
[02:17:34.295 --> 02:17:36.417]  And, and, and, and, standing ovation.
[02:17:36.417 --> 02:17:39.039]  Oh, people, oh, yes, oh.
[02:17:39.039 --> 02:17:41.882]  The time of the control freak orgy is coming.
[02:17:41.882 --> 02:17:43.764]  The time of the mass death is coming.
[02:17:48.167 --> 02:17:59.556]  The public has to come to the chemicals in the water and now they're going straight to the end game of an injection that turns you into a biological android and the cops are going to hold everybody down.
[02:17:59.556 --> 02:18:03.819]  They're going to do it themselves and they just want to lose their soul, their body.
[02:18:03.819 --> 02:18:04.780]  They love it.
[02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:09.823]  They love it because they feel that petty power trip of submitting and so good.
[02:18:09.823 --> 02:18:11.725]  Your family, your whole family line,
[02:18:12.265 --> 02:18:17.709]  They plan to neutralize us psychologically before they just release mega-plagues and actually kill you.
[02:18:17.709 --> 02:18:24.074]  They even said last week in the British papers, it's time to stop mincing words, we need to start getting rid of everybody.
[02:18:24.074 --> 02:18:27.856]  I mean, they're now coming out, they're getting really ready for the hot kill weapons.
[02:18:27.856 --> 02:18:30.038]  And so for the people out there that are laughing right now,
[02:18:30.718 --> 02:18:33.002]  You know, when they release these, we're unable to stop them.
[02:18:33.002 --> 02:18:35.505]  Just, I want you, at least while you're dying, to know who killed you.
[02:18:35.505 --> 02:18:37.508]  The news will be telling you Al-Qaeda did it.
[02:18:37.508 --> 02:18:42.755]  But how long do you think they really start the mass plagues to... They've just been testing the soft kills up until now.
[02:18:42.755 --> 02:18:44.598]  They really want to devastate and kill a lot of people.
[02:18:45.253 --> 02:18:52.597]  Well, they do, and that was all part of the fake swine flu and other flu, avian flu before that, to remember, too.
[02:18:52.597 --> 02:18:53.878]  And SARS?
[02:18:53.878 --> 02:19:03.964]  Yeah, it's getting us used to the idea that it's definitely coming, and that's what even the professors will tell their students in university, the plague is just around the corner.
[02:19:03.964 --> 02:19:13.449]  And so they will release it when it's the right time, when people are dumbed down enough to simply die off quietly and say, oh, well, what could they do?
[02:19:13.449 --> 02:19:14.330]  They tried their best.
[02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:18.533]  And most folk actually, unfortunately, will go that way.
[02:19:18.533 --> 02:19:20.335]  But it's coming.
[02:19:20.335 --> 02:19:21.035]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:19:21.035 --> 02:19:21.696]  It's coming.
[02:19:21.696 --> 02:19:26.961]  And remember, too, I've gone into bacterial and viral warfare in a big way over the years.
[02:19:26.961 --> 02:19:38.691]  And in all the writings that they've disclosed to the public on these topics from the governments themselves, they admit that for every plague that they create in the laboratory, and they've got thousands of them,
[02:19:39.389 --> 02:19:40.551]  Since World War II.
[02:19:40.551 --> 02:19:44.037]  They had lots during World War II, in fact, they created in the lab.
[02:19:44.037 --> 02:19:52.192]  They always must have, by international law, the antidote for them as well, at every stage of mutation of virus or bacterium.
[02:19:52.916 --> 02:20:00.239]  So, they have them and the big rigs themselves, of course, will get a real inoculation that will prevent them from catching it.
[02:20:00.239 --> 02:20:12.223]  And that's one of the incentives to get on board for those who are climbing the ladder, of course, is to get up there and to make sure that you and your family, it's promised that your family will also be preserved and looked after.
[02:20:12.683 --> 02:20:19.247]  But it's all in the name of bringing down the population because we, you see, the useless eaters are now unsustainable.
[02:20:19.247 --> 02:20:27.312]  We are using the resources they claim that will feed their families, you know, the right kind of people's families who should survive, to feed them for thousands of years.
[02:20:27.312 --> 02:20:28.893]  So they must get rid of us now.
[02:20:28.893 --> 02:20:32.816]  That's what they're openly saying, and you're quite right, they are openly saying it now.
[02:20:32.816 --> 02:20:34.257]  They aren't hiding anything, yeah.
[02:20:34.757 --> 02:20:43.541]  Well, first they're going to collapse the population, give people inoculations for flu that have the viruses that will destroy the resistance centers.
[02:20:43.541 --> 02:20:44.181]  So what?
[02:20:44.181 --> 02:20:46.122]  I mean, if we don't back them off?
[02:20:46.122 --> 02:20:49.263]  I mean, they're already slaughtering people en masse in Latin America and Africa.
[02:20:49.263 --> 02:20:51.144]  They've been admittedly caught over and over again.
[02:20:51.144 --> 02:20:54.245]  What's the time frame, Alan, when they'll really start releasing Megadeth on people?
[02:20:55.050 --> 02:20:57.371]  Uh, I'm sure you know like everything else that they do.
[02:20:57.371 --> 02:21:01.254]  I'm sure 9-11 was planned probably 40 years before they hit it.
[02:21:01.254 --> 02:21:02.254]  Um, that's how they do things.
[02:21:02.254 --> 02:21:04.015]  A long, long-term business plan.
[02:21:04.015 --> 02:21:07.497]  Long, long- So Northwoods was 40 years- about 30 years before, yeah.
[02:21:07.497 --> 02:21:08.057]  Yeah.
[02:21:08.057 --> 02:21:10.339]  And, and so they'll have a definite timetable.
[02:21:10.339 --> 02:21:15.602]  They'll know exactly when the public's ready to accept it by how dumb we are in the polls they constantly take.
[02:21:15.602 --> 02:21:21.065]  And then they will release it.
[02:21:21.065 --> 02:21:22.946]  You are being poisoned!
[02:21:23.698 --> 02:21:27.301]  You have got to choose sides, and there's no decision.
[02:21:27.301 --> 02:21:28.582]  You're already on our side.
[02:21:28.582 --> 02:21:30.924]  You're already slated for extermination.
[02:21:30.924 --> 02:21:35.207]  Slow, soft kill extermination, getting more and more intense.
[02:21:35.207 --> 02:21:45.935]  The system's already tested how to roll out a new plague, have a celebrity lead the plague, and to make sure they manage the plague so that real cures and the real cause is never found.
[02:21:51.460 --> 02:21:58.788]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes Infowars has had.
[02:21:58.788 --> 02:22:02.092]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[02:22:02.092 --> 02:22:11.222]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[02:22:12.060 --> 02:22:14.442]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[02:22:14.442 --> 02:22:20.065]  So, now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[02:22:20.065 --> 02:22:23.208]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[02:22:23.208 --> 02:22:25.989]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[02:22:25.989 --> 02:22:30.272]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[02:22:30.272 --> 02:22:34.975]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[02:22:34.975 --> 02:22:36.697]  We have the power.
[02:22:36.697 --> 02:22:40.019]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[02:22:40.985 --> 02:22:46.587]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[02:22:46.587 --> 02:22:52.409]  So be the Paul Revere as you are.
[02:22:52.409 --> 02:22:56.011]  Humanity has been domesticated, by and large.
[02:22:56.011 --> 02:23:00.573]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all gonna pass.
[02:23:00.573 --> 02:23:09.456]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[02:23:09.776 --> 02:23:14.220]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:31.776]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us, under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[02:23:32.356 --> 02:23:48.182]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[02:23:48.182 --> 02:23:52.104]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist.
[02:23:52.104 --> 02:23:55.805]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[02:23:56.994 --> 02:23:59.015]  People ask me all the time, they go, Jones, are you on cocaine?
[02:23:59.015 --> 02:24:00.095]  Are you on meth?
[02:24:00.095 --> 02:24:01.475]  How are you so excited?
[02:24:01.475 --> 02:24:10.298]  How do I not get excited about world government, forced mass, forced inoculations, open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved?
[02:24:10.298 --> 02:24:10.738]  I'm sorry.
[02:24:10.738 --> 02:24:12.659]  I'm a fighter.
[02:24:12.659 --> 02:24:15.360]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:17.520]  And so I'll just say this.
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:18.541]  I try to be calm.
[02:24:18.541 --> 02:24:20.461]  I try to be focused.
[02:24:20.461 --> 02:24:22.502]  I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't still on air right now.
[02:24:24.045 --> 02:24:26.723]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air.
[02:24:27.532 --> 02:24:32.614]  Because you have to realize, when I tell you that you're the InfoWar, that's not me patting you on the head.
[02:24:32.614 --> 02:24:36.335]  You are 99% of the equation.
[02:24:36.335 --> 02:24:44.078]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products, InfoWarStore.com, when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[02:24:44.078 --> 02:24:46.279]  So, you are the InfoWar.
[02:24:46.279 --> 02:24:47.899]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[02:24:47.899 --> 02:24:49.200]  Thank you for all you've done.
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:52.001]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalists.
[02:24:52.001 --> 02:24:54.382]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[02:24:54.382 --> 02:24:55.142]  It's very bittersweet.
[02:24:56.110 --> 02:24:59.091]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[02:24:59.091 --> 02:25:00.351]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[02:25:00.351 --> 02:25:01.272]  But I don't care about that.
[02:25:01.272 --> 02:25:03.312]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[02:25:03.312 --> 02:25:08.014]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[02:25:08.014 --> 02:25:11.375]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[02:25:11.375 --> 02:25:12.895]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[02:25:12.895 --> 02:25:14.096]  But let's just say this.
[02:25:14.096 --> 02:25:15.416]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[02:25:15.416 --> 02:25:17.857]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[02:25:18.497 --> 02:25:22.139]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[02:25:22.139 --> 02:25:24.700]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:27.902]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[02:25:27.902 --> 02:25:28.743]  Do they fund freedom?
[02:25:28.743 --> 02:25:29.863]  No, a lot of them don't.
[02:25:29.863 --> 02:25:36.306]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[02:25:36.306 --> 02:25:38.047]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[02:25:38.047 --> 02:25:40.869]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[02:25:41.449 --> 02:25:44.571]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[02:25:44.571 --> 02:25:55.256]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[02:25:55.256 --> 02:25:57.857]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:15.197 --> 02:26:28.401]  One of the most beautiful renditions of America the Beautiful there by Ray Charles.
[02:26:28.401 --> 02:26:32.442]  Back in the day when we had pride.
[02:26:32.442 --> 02:26:38.564]  Back in the day when we loved our country, we understood what it meant and how important it was.
[02:26:38.564 --> 02:26:41.025]  We've fallen far from that grace.
[02:26:43.235 --> 02:26:50.659]  And a perfect example is what's going on with the George Floyd case right now where we have breaking news.
[02:26:50.659 --> 02:26:58.803]  Minneapolis City Council has just approved a $27 million dollar settlement with George Floyd's family.
[02:26:58.803 --> 02:27:00.784]  Wow!
[02:27:00.784 --> 02:27:06.687]  Boy, they should just walk away with their riches.
[02:27:06.687 --> 02:27:08.628]  That they're sadly drug-addicted criminal
[02:27:09.722 --> 02:27:12.084]  Family member George Floyd just got for them.
[02:27:12.084 --> 02:27:13.045]  Wow.
[02:27:13.045 --> 02:27:16.968]  Talk about a victory.
[02:27:16.968 --> 02:27:19.590]  This country is so messed up, man.
[02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:28.837]  And it was Robert Barnes that was saying that the average payout in a situation like this is less than a million dollars.
[02:27:28.837 --> 02:27:30.098]  So how did Floyd's family get 27 million?
[02:27:32.284 --> 02:27:46.114]  Well, I'll tell you how, because the terrorist mobs, the terrorist mobs, led by the Democrat Party and their media cohorts, had already burned Minneapolis to the ground once, and they were set to do it again.
[02:27:46.114 --> 02:27:53.259]  And if you think, though, $27 million is going to stop that from happening, you've got a sad reality about to hit you in the face.
[02:27:53.259 --> 02:27:56.061]  The trial for Chauvin is ongoing.
[02:27:56.061 --> 02:27:59.063]  The trial for the other officers involved starts in August.
[02:28:00.882 --> 02:28:07.585]  And you know, the judge said something this morning that indicates he wants to play this thing square.
[02:28:07.585 --> 02:28:12.428]  Judge bars prosecution from describing George Floyd as a gentle giant at Chauvin trial.
[02:28:12.428 --> 02:28:14.529]  Yeah, because that's a lie.
[02:28:14.529 --> 02:28:16.830]  You could describe him as a drug addict.
[02:28:16.830 --> 02:28:20.611]  That would be honest.
[02:28:20.611 --> 02:28:23.093]  A criminal.
[02:28:23.093 --> 02:28:26.574]  That would be honest.
[02:28:26.574 --> 02:28:27.755]  You already had one shooting
[02:28:28.775 --> 02:28:39.942]  At the George Floyd Autonomous Zone in Minneapolis, you've had thousands of people out there ready to burn the city to the ground, if a result comes out that they don't like.
[02:28:39.942 --> 02:28:43.444]  Which is any result.
[02:28:43.444 --> 02:28:50.928]  Even if they hung Chauvin in the streets of Minneapolis, they'd still riot.
[02:28:50.928 --> 02:28:52.349]  Because that's what they want.
[02:28:52.349 --> 02:28:53.830]  You're only empowering them.
[02:28:54.412 --> 02:29:02.361]  What should be happening is they should all be getting busted up by the police for engaging in felonious behavior, but that won't happen.
[02:29:02.361 --> 02:29:11.831]  So they will riot and they will burn, and now George Floyd's family has made $27 million off of the death of a drug overdose from George Floyd.
[02:29:14.897 --> 02:29:19.160]  And so, you now have the lawyer, Ben Crump, who's always in all these cases.
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:20.001]  He's a real dirtbag.
[02:29:20.001 --> 02:29:23.603]  You have ambulance chasers, and then you have fake racism chasers.
[02:29:23.603 --> 02:29:27.145]  That would be Ben Crump.
[02:29:27.145 --> 02:29:34.090]  He says, Mr. Floyd died because the weight of the entire Minneapolis Police Department was on his neck.
[02:29:34.090 --> 02:29:40.314]  And he says that this was a violation of George Floyd's rights.
[02:29:43.723 --> 02:29:44.783]  Well, I guess he's right.
[02:29:44.783 --> 02:29:58.689]  I mean, George Floyd has the right to peacefully and gracefully die from his drug overdose and his heart failure from years of drug overdosing.
[02:29:58.689 --> 02:30:02.731]  Oh, bringing controlled substances into the defense is old playbook.
[02:30:02.731 --> 02:30:06.893]  He was on a deadly amount of three different drugs.
[02:30:06.893 --> 02:30:08.653]  The guy obviously overdosed.
[02:30:08.653 --> 02:30:12.615]  He was probably going to die any day soon anyway with the condition his heart was in.
[02:30:14.056 --> 02:30:16.357]  And he couldn't handle that event.
[02:30:16.357 --> 02:30:20.498]  His heart gave out, his body gave out, he overdosed on drugs.
[02:30:20.498 --> 02:30:23.179]  Oh, that's an old defense.
[02:30:23.179 --> 02:30:26.720]  Racism is the old defense!
[02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:31.521]  You think Derek Chauvin doesn't wake up every day wishing he never met George Floyd?
[02:30:31.521 --> 02:30:35.483]  You don't think Derek Chauvin wakes up every day wishing he never became a police officer?
[02:30:35.483 --> 02:30:37.923]  Wishing he called in sick that day?
[02:30:37.923 --> 02:30:40.124]  That's the worst day of Derek Chauvin's life!
[02:30:43.914 --> 02:30:44.814]  He's racist!
[02:30:44.814 --> 02:30:45.775]  He did it on purpose!
[02:30:45.775 --> 02:30:46.715]  It's murder!
[02:30:46.715 --> 02:30:51.897]  Lies, lies, lies.
[02:30:51.897 --> 02:30:58.839]  George Floyd's family has been enriched to the tunes of probably hundreds of millions of dollars by this event.
[02:30:58.839 --> 02:31:04.541]  Greatest thing George Floyd ever did for his family was overdosing on drugs with a police officer's knee on his neck.
[02:31:04.541 --> 02:31:06.121]  Oh, I'm sorry, is that insensitive?
[02:31:06.121 --> 02:31:06.841]  Screw you!
[02:31:06.841 --> 02:31:08.582]  I don't give a damn!
[02:31:09.617 --> 02:31:12.439]  What's insensitive is burning a damn city to the ground.
[02:31:12.439 --> 02:31:19.042]  What's insensitive is lying about this event so that you can burn a damn city to the ground and claim it's righteous and just.
[02:31:19.042 --> 02:31:21.483]  That's insensitive!
[02:31:21.483 --> 02:31:27.006]  Not telling the damn truth about George Floyd.
[02:31:27.006 --> 02:31:32.549]  Before the day Floyd died, how much do you think he did to help his family?
[02:31:32.549 --> 02:31:34.850]  Oh, but then afterwards, his family loves him now.
[02:31:34.850 --> 02:31:37.732]  Yeah, after he made you about 50 million dollars, you love him, don't you?
[02:31:39.258 --> 02:31:40.338]  Disgusting!
[02:31:40.338 --> 02:31:44.360]  They should donate every cent of that to black communities.
[02:31:44.360 --> 02:31:47.941]  They won't do it.
[02:31:47.941 --> 02:31:51.963]  Oh, but they will give half a million dollars to the George Floyd Memorial site.
[02:31:51.963 --> 02:31:54.924]  Isn't that nice?
[02:31:54.924 --> 02:31:56.544]  Wow, how gracious of them.
[02:31:56.544 --> 02:32:06.288]  They've made almost 50 million dollars off the death of George Floyd, that we even know of, but they're going to give half a million to the Floyd Memorial.
[02:32:06.288 --> 02:32:06.788]  That's nice.
[02:32:08.331 --> 02:32:11.414]  This is so disgusting.
[02:32:11.414 --> 02:32:14.917]  This is so disgusting.
[02:32:14.917 --> 02:32:19.240]  27 million settlement with George Floyd's family.
[02:32:19.240 --> 02:32:23.945]  So boy oh boy, now get ready for this to happen.
[02:32:23.945 --> 02:32:35.955]  There will now be probably actually real George Floyd mimic deaths where you will have people bomb themselves out on drugs
[02:32:36.756 --> 02:32:37.456]  Sitting in a car.
[02:32:37.456 --> 02:32:39.257]  By the way, George Floyd was in the car.
[02:32:39.257 --> 02:32:40.417]  Bombed out on drugs.
[02:32:40.417 --> 02:32:42.798]  He could have started that vehicle and killed somebody.
[02:32:42.798 --> 02:32:45.078]  Oh, that doesn't count.
[02:32:45.078 --> 02:32:46.139]  So you watch.
[02:32:46.139 --> 02:32:50.600]  You're now going to see, and it won't matter if a white guy does it, but you'll watch.
[02:32:50.600 --> 02:33:00.203]  I bet you there's mimic events where, black or white, it doesn't matter, where men will intentionally overdose on drugs
[02:33:02.330 --> 02:33:13.292]  And then get into a conflict with police and then hoping they die during the overdose while in the conflict with the police so that they can be enriched.
[02:33:13.292 --> 02:33:17.433]  They can enrich their family in the deaths and then become world famous in the process.
[02:33:17.433 --> 02:33:19.874]  It's going to become a copycat event now.
[02:33:19.874 --> 02:33:29.156]  When you put numbers like 27 million out there, you better damn believe somebody's going to kill themselves with drugs but try to do it during a police confrontation to get that payout.
[02:33:29.156 --> 02:33:30.556]  Kind of like what just happened in Dallas.
[02:33:31.368 --> 02:33:33.149]  By the way, where's the mainstream media on this?
[02:33:33.149 --> 02:33:38.471]  A black guy in Dallas jail for years.
[02:33:38.471 --> 02:33:41.992]  The number off the top of my head is 43, but maybe the guy was 43 years old.
[02:33:41.992 --> 02:33:44.733]  I can't remember, but 43 is the year coming in my head.
[02:33:44.733 --> 02:33:55.157]  But he goes to jail because, and now they admit, there was a cash reward put out for the suspect in, I think it was a murder case or something.
[02:33:55.157 --> 02:33:56.398]  I don't remember the case exactly.
[02:33:57.245 --> 02:34:10.211]  And this guy was in jail in Dallas because three men wanted that reward money, and so they turned in this individual, ID'd him during a lineup, and now they've all come out and said, nope, we lied, we just wanted the cash payout.
[02:34:10.211 --> 02:34:13.673]  That's all it was.
[02:34:13.673 --> 02:34:19.475]  And a man sat in jail for years because of that.
[02:34:19.475 --> 02:34:21.176]  Nobody even picked it up.
[02:34:21.176 --> 02:34:23.037]  Happened in Dallas this week, he was released.
[02:34:24.545 --> 02:34:24.965]  There it is.
[02:34:24.965 --> 02:34:34.067]  How a judge decided lies and reward money led a jury to wrongfully convict a Dallas man in deadly robbery.
[02:34:34.067 --> 02:34:46.090]  And that man right there, Ben Spencer, black by the way, media doesn't care about him, sat in jail, an innocent man, for years because somebody wanted that reward money.
[02:34:46.090 --> 02:34:47.891]  Well now they just put reward money
[02:34:49.228 --> 02:34:52.750]  On you, if you die during a police exchange and it doesn't matter.
[02:34:52.750 --> 02:35:03.635]  I'm telling you man, people will cut themselves and then get into a conflict with police and then bleed out dying from a self-inflicted wound and the media will still blame the police.
[02:35:03.635 --> 02:35:11.078]  And then you'll have the Democrat terrorists burn cities to the ground and then the city council will say, here, here's millions of dollars, please!
[02:35:11.078 --> 02:35:14.479]  34 years in jail is what he spent.
[02:35:14.479 --> 02:35:16.560]  So I had a little dyslexia in my photographic memory.
[02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:16.961]  I said 43, it's 34.
[02:35:19.272 --> 02:35:20.713]  So you get ready now.
[02:35:20.713 --> 02:35:33.000]  Now you've just put reward money... Now you've just issued millions in reward money if you get killed by police, and you're black, and the Democrats burn your city to the ground.
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.682]  So you will now see copycat attempts.
[02:35:35.682 --> 02:35:48.329]  Now I don't know if they'll get the payouts, but there will be copycat attempts to stage a wrongful death against police officers, to stage that wrongful death, to get their family millions of dollars when they die.
[02:35:51.047 --> 02:35:54.991]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[02:35:54.991 --> 02:35:57.634]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[02:35:57.634 --> 02:35:58.375]  Why do you do that?
[02:35:58.375 --> 02:36:01.319]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[02:36:01.319 --> 02:36:03.341]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[02:36:04.130 --> 02:36:12.913]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[02:36:12.913 --> 02:36:13.173]  Boom!
[02:36:13.173 --> 02:36:13.573]  We did it.
[02:36:13.573 --> 02:36:14.073]  It's popular.
[02:36:14.073 --> 02:36:14.833]  It's X3.
[02:36:14.833 --> 02:36:16.074]  Is it better than X2?
[02:36:16.074 --> 02:36:16.734]  You decide.
[02:36:16.734 --> 02:36:18.215]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[02:36:18.215 --> 02:36:22.336]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill
[02:36:23.216 --> 02:36:25.399]  SleepAid, and that is down and out.
[02:36:25.399 --> 02:36:30.083]  It's super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other.
[02:36:30.083 --> 02:36:37.271]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates at InfoWareStore.com and free shipping.
[02:36:37.271 --> 02:36:41.675]  Secure your down and out today, and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the info at the same time.

[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:55.149]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[02:36:55.149 --> 02:36:58.878]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[02:36:58.878 --> 02:37:01.484]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[02:37:02.125 --> 02:37:06.506]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:37:06.506 --> 02:37:12.267]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[02:37:12.267 --> 02:37:23.850]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[02:37:24.490 --> 02:37:26.611]  I need your help more than ever now.
[02:37:26.611 --> 02:37:30.733]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[02:37:30.733 --> 02:37:41.318]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:37:41.318 --> 02:37:50.883]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[02:37:50.883 --> 02:37:51.523]  Thank you so much.
[02:37:53.326 --> 02:37:57.351]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[02:37:57.351 --> 02:38:00.315]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[02:38:00.315 --> 02:38:02.978]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[02:38:02.978 --> 02:38:05.962]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[02:38:05.962 --> 02:38:09.587]  That's why Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:38:09.587 --> 02:38:11.890]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies.
[02:38:12.510 --> 02:38:18.773]  Are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[02:38:18.773 --> 02:38:21.934]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals.
[02:38:21.934 --> 02:38:23.034]  Because it's so simple.
[02:38:23.034 --> 02:38:25.015]  Because you won't be under their control anymore.
[02:38:25.015 --> 02:38:33.899]  Well, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the highest quality Vitamin Mineral Fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form, is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:38:33.899 --> 02:38:36.220]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[02:38:36.220 --> 02:38:39.361]  It funds the Info War at the same time.
[02:38:39.361 --> 02:38:41.242]  No other product you can buy does that.
[02:38:41.642 --> 02:38:44.384]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[02:38:44.384 --> 02:38:47.126]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[02:38:47.126 --> 02:38:47.747]  With or without a battery.
[02:39:10.482 --> 02:39:16.588]  Now, with the InfoWars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[02:39:16.588 --> 02:39:17.449]  Excellent.
[02:39:17.449 --> 02:39:23.054]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[02:39:23.054 --> 02:39:26.077]  And you can too at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:39:27.638 --> 02:39:38.402]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[02:39:38.402 --> 02:39:43.324]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[02:39:43.324 --> 02:39:49.226]  Support the InfoWar and get your InfoWars privacy pouch today.
[02:39:49.226 --> 02:39:50.307]  InfoWarStore.com
[02:39:55.224 --> 02:39:57.833]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:12.331 --> 02:40:19.593]  So imagine, George Floyd's family is now going to be living in million-dollar mansions, driving around Bentleys and Ferraris.
[02:40:19.593 --> 02:40:24.374]  All because George Floyd died of a drug overdose and heart failure with a police officer's knee on his neck.
[02:40:24.374 --> 02:40:24.874]  Wow!
[02:40:24.874 --> 02:40:27.135]  And you, the taxpayer, are paying for all of it.
[02:40:28.712 --> 02:40:29.953]  It's just out of control, man.
[02:40:29.953 --> 02:40:31.714]  This country is so out of control.
[02:40:31.714 --> 02:40:35.035]  And the only option is just limited, small government.
[02:40:35.035 --> 02:40:36.476]  That's the only solution to any of this.
[02:40:36.476 --> 02:40:38.577]  But, of course, what do we see being pushed for?
[02:40:38.577 --> 02:40:39.938]  Bigger, more government.
[02:40:39.938 --> 02:40:44.740]  And it's all coming from our politicians, mostly the Democrat Party and the media.
[02:40:44.740 --> 02:40:50.983]  Now, I have to move on here because this is so key.
[02:40:50.983 --> 02:40:52.264]  And I got all these other news stories.
[02:40:52.264 --> 02:40:54.965]  I'm gonna have to put them on hold and I'll cover them during the war room coming up.
[02:40:54.965 --> 02:40:56.125]  And I'll take your phone calls, too.
[02:40:56.125 --> 02:40:57.186]  And I got great guests, but
[02:40:59.207 --> 02:41:01.008]  Nick Begich is about to take over on the fourth hour.
[02:41:01.008 --> 02:41:02.668]  This is so key, though.
[02:41:02.668 --> 02:41:08.731]  Now, nobody other than InfoWars in the media has been reporting on this.
[02:41:08.731 --> 02:41:13.393]  And it's really been... Well, I mean, I don't know.
[02:41:13.393 --> 02:41:28.239]  I mean, I could have the crew go back and find the shows that I did even last week, where I dedicated entire shows and segments and titles saying, this is a trial vaccine, this is a new technology being tested,
[02:41:29.756 --> 02:41:36.880]  And I do so many other radio hits and stuff, I mean, it's like I can't even keep track, but I've been parroting this.
[02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:38.081]  We're being tested on.
[02:41:38.081 --> 02:41:39.742]  This is a global test.
[02:41:39.742 --> 02:41:50.968]  This is a planetary scale trial that you're all being engaged in right now with this, what they're calling a vaccine, which is actually gene therapy.
[02:41:50.968 --> 02:41:52.188]  I've been pounding the desk.
[02:41:52.188 --> 02:41:53.869]  I've been pulling my hair out.
[02:41:53.869 --> 02:41:55.210]  I've been trying to warn people.
[02:41:56.909 --> 02:42:00.213]  You are part of an experiment, worldwide.
[02:42:00.213 --> 02:42:04.517]  You're guinea pigs in a messenger RNA experiment.
[02:42:04.517 --> 02:42:06.439]  I explain this to people when I talk to them.
[02:42:06.439 --> 02:42:09.442]  I rant and hoot and holler on air about it.
[02:42:09.442 --> 02:42:10.803]  Sounds crazy, right?
[02:42:10.803 --> 02:42:15.648]  Well, maybe if Anthony Fauci told you that, then maybe people would listen.
[02:42:15.648 --> 02:42:18.131]  So, in an incredible revelation,
[02:42:19.318 --> 02:42:25.443]  Anthony Fauci being interviewed on some, I don't even know, like this guy apparently, all this guy does is go on TV and radio.
[02:42:25.443 --> 02:42:30.527]  That's literally all this guy does with his big pharmaceutical talking points.
[02:42:30.527 --> 02:42:47.880]  The big pharmaceutical whore, Dr. Fauci, for decades he's been a big pharmaceutical whore, still is, and so he goes on some radio show or YouTube show, I've never seen this or heard of the guy, and the guy's actually asking him real questions
[02:42:49.105 --> 02:43:00.923]  And Fauci admits what InfoWars and what I and Alex Jones and other guests that come on our shows have been screaming about, ranting about, warning, dire, sound the alarm.
[02:43:02.719 --> 02:43:08.245]  But see, nobody listens when InfoWars says it, they just will freak out when ten years later it comes true.
[02:43:08.245 --> 02:43:11.889]  But when we actually say it, it's like, ah, forget about it, it's just passe.
[02:43:11.889 --> 02:43:19.257]  That's just InfoWars breaking next year's news today, but we'll be in shock and awe in next year or ten years when all of it comes true, like, oh!
[02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:24.622]  Okay, we've been warning you that this is a giant worldwide experiment.
[02:43:24.622 --> 02:43:26.083]  People didn't want to listen.
[02:43:26.083 --> 02:43:29.424]  Maybe if they hear it from Fauci, maybe then they'd listen.
[02:43:29.424 --> 02:43:32.285]  So here's Fauci on some no-name podcast or something.
[02:43:32.285 --> 02:43:33.706]  I'm not trying to be insulting to the guy.
[02:43:33.706 --> 02:43:35.427]  I just don't know who it is.
[02:43:35.427 --> 02:43:38.808]  So Fauci just does interviews all day long with his big pharmaceutical talking points.
[02:43:39.634 --> 02:43:51.617]  And then, he has to admit, in an interview yesterday, that yes, this is a worldwide experiment, all humans are being used like guinea pigs, this is not a vaccine, but don't take it from me!
[02:43:51.617 --> 02:43:54.298]  Don't take it from Infowars, who's been saying this for months.
[02:43:54.298 --> 02:43:56.678]  Here's Fauci admitting it yesterday!
[02:43:56.678 --> 02:44:03.540]  Has this kind of mRNA vaccine technology ever been injected into humans before?
[02:44:03.540 --> 02:44:08.381]  Well, this is the first time, and the good news is that the results are really, really good.
[02:44:09.466 --> 02:44:10.187]  Okay.
[02:44:10.187 --> 02:44:15.231]  But, in essence, this is an experimental technology.
[02:44:15.231 --> 02:44:25.239]  Well, it's a new technology and it is proven in a very large group of clinical trials to be safe and highly effective.
[02:44:25.239 --> 02:44:29.522]  Are you completely positive that this new technology is safe?
[02:44:29.522 --> 02:44:30.203]  I mean, how can...
[02:44:31.081 --> 02:44:41.670]  How can we be sure there won't be long-term effects when these vaccines were seemingly developed so quickly and have only been tested for months and not years?
[02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:49.297]  The speed with which it's been done is a reflection of the extraordinary advances in science.
[02:44:49.297 --> 02:44:52.159]  And there was no compromise of safety.
[02:44:52.159 --> 02:44:52.980]  But as I said,
[02:44:53.681 --> 02:45:02.387]  Before, in the history of vaccinology, you don't see effects that occur years later.
[02:45:02.387 --> 02:45:12.033]  Almost all of the bad effects, as rare as they are, and they are very rare, occur between 15 and 45 days from the time you get vaccinated.
[02:45:16.793 --> 02:45:17.153]  Rare?
[02:45:17.153 --> 02:45:18.214]  What are you talking about rare?
[02:45:18.214 --> 02:45:23.396]  We've had thousands of deaths, tens of thousands of negative side effects, even Bill Gates admits that.
[02:45:23.396 --> 02:45:29.139]  But he even lies during that because he says, but this is vaccination history.
[02:45:29.139 --> 02:45:31.520]  But he admits at the beginning it's not even a vaccine!
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:40.525]  Now look, I'm a little overwhelmed right now, and so this is such bombshell news.
[02:45:43.371 --> 02:45:45.652]  It's not about being vindicated here at InfoWars.
[02:45:45.652 --> 02:45:47.933]  We know we're vindicated in everything we say.
[02:45:47.933 --> 02:45:51.855]  This is like... The world needs to see this.
[02:45:51.855 --> 02:45:54.256]  So I'm like kind of in a pinch myself moment right now.
[02:45:54.256 --> 02:45:59.098]  In fact, guys, I need the crew to find out, because I almost don't even believe that's real.
[02:45:59.098 --> 02:46:01.138]  Like, that has to be a deep fake.
[02:46:01.138 --> 02:46:05.260]  Because if that's real, I mean, it should be game over for these people.
[02:46:05.260 --> 02:46:09.262]  The whole world's jaw should drop to the floor and say, what the hell?
[02:46:10.476 --> 02:46:18.017]  You just launched an experimental new technology into my body that you don't even know?
[02:46:18.017 --> 02:46:19.458]  Long-term tests you don't know?
[02:46:19.458 --> 02:46:20.198]  You don't know anything!
[02:46:20.198 --> 02:46:22.118]  You're admitting it's a brand new technology!
[02:46:22.118 --> 02:46:23.838]  Holy crap, InfoWars was right!
[02:46:23.838 --> 02:46:26.239]  So I'm like having a pinch myself moment right now.
[02:46:26.239 --> 02:46:28.819]  This is too bombshell to even believe.
[02:46:28.819 --> 02:46:32.880]  Guys, can we find out what podcast or radio show that was?
[02:46:38.417 --> 02:46:44.000]  A Mexican actor, a comedian, named what now?
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:45.060]  Eugenio Debres?
[02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:45.961]  I'm probably saying that wrong.
[02:46:45.961 --> 02:46:48.122]  I just have the crew in my ear.
[02:46:48.122 --> 02:46:49.883]  Is there any way you can go on the mic and say this?
[02:46:49.883 --> 02:46:51.143]  Because I don't want to butcher it.
[02:46:51.143 --> 02:46:52.764]  I mean, so, but this is confirmed though.
[02:46:52.764 --> 02:46:53.485]  This is real.
[02:46:53.485 --> 02:46:58.047]  This is not a deepfake.
[02:46:58.047 --> 02:47:00.928]  So that's because... I mean, the crew is telling me it's real.
[02:47:00.928 --> 02:47:06.071]  Again, I just found this video and I mean...
[02:47:07.268 --> 02:47:14.353]  I already knew it was real because I saw it and I read the response but I'm like it's like pinch myself like this is crazy man.
[02:47:14.353 --> 02:47:25.802]  So like I need to like double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, octuple down like this is real like this Fauci just admitted everything we've been telling you for months.
[02:47:25.802 --> 02:47:27.523]  Wow.
[02:47:27.523 --> 02:47:32.807]  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
[02:47:32.807 --> 02:47:36.810]  So Eugeno Derbez, Eugeno Derbez,
[02:47:38.272 --> 02:47:45.618]  A Mexican actor-comedian gets this interview with Fauci somehow.
[02:47:45.618 --> 02:47:46.979]  I don't know where or what.
[02:47:46.979 --> 02:47:47.920]  Does he have a podcast?
[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:49.481]  Does he have a TV show?
[02:47:49.481 --> 02:47:53.604]  And Fauci admits this is a new technology.
[02:47:53.604 --> 02:47:57.547]  This is brand new biotechnology that they're testing worldwide right now.
[02:47:57.547 --> 02:47:59.409]  They've never done long-term testing.
[02:47:59.409 --> 02:48:01.270]  They didn't even do short-term testing.
[02:48:01.270 --> 02:48:02.971]  They didn't do animal testing.
[02:48:02.971 --> 02:48:04.232]  They did no testing!
[02:48:04.232 --> 02:48:05.934]  They're testing it on you right now!
[02:48:06.992 --> 02:48:28.886]  And then he admits, this is unbelievable, and then he admits it's a new technology, so they've never had proper testing, but then when he tries to, when he tries to divert off of the fact it's a giant test with new technology that he admits, he then says
[02:48:29.685 --> 02:48:42.250]  Yes, but with the history of vaccinations, we know that effects really only happen during the first month or two, but he admits this isn't even a vaccine.
[02:48:42.250 --> 02:48:45.132]  Incredible, folks.
[02:48:45.132 --> 02:48:48.693]  Seriously, this is incredible.
[02:48:48.693 --> 02:48:52.655]  So I need that video up on Banned Out Video, just a Fauci,
[02:48:53.940 --> 02:48:54.841]  Okay?
[02:48:54.841 --> 02:48:56.662]  And you got to share this far and wide, folks.
[02:48:56.662 --> 02:48:59.545]  This is, I'm telling you, this is the end of Fauci if we make this go viral.
[02:48:59.545 --> 02:49:03.168]  This is end, this is game over of the whole fake pandemic.
[02:49:03.168 --> 02:49:05.690]  This is game over of the whole vaccine.
[02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:09.153]  People need to know you are being tested right now.
[02:49:09.153 --> 02:49:12.656]  You are part of a worldwide human experiment.
[02:49:12.656 --> 02:49:14.257]  This is a new technology.
[02:49:14.257 --> 02:49:16.359]  Fauci just admitted it all.
[02:49:16.359 --> 02:49:17.660]  He just admitted it all.
[02:49:17.660 --> 02:49:22.104]  So I need this, that video, that minute and a half video or whatever, put it on Banned.video and title it
[02:49:23.468 --> 02:49:29.678]  Anthony Fauci admits COVID vaccine is new technology never tested before.
[02:49:29.678 --> 02:49:34.265]  Anthony Fauci admits COVID vaccine is new technology never tested before.
[02:49:38.610 --> 02:49:41.871]  And so that video will go up, just that video.
[02:49:41.871 --> 02:49:43.891]  So not with my commentary or anything.
[02:49:43.891 --> 02:49:46.892]  And then we'll put up the other video with my commentary, too.
[02:49:46.892 --> 02:49:51.373]  This needs to go mega, absolute, total viral.
[02:49:51.373 --> 02:49:53.534]  It needs to be on Tucker Carlson tonight.
[02:49:53.534 --> 02:49:56.575]  It needs to be everywhere.
[02:49:56.575 --> 02:50:05.497]  Anthony Fauci admits COVID shot is new technology being tested on humans in live time.
[02:50:09.841 --> 02:50:21.044]  Here, you know, look... I just... You know, people's always like, oh, how do you do it?
[02:50:21.044 --> 02:50:22.085]  How do you do three hours a day?
[02:50:22.085 --> 02:50:23.105]  How do you do all this?
[02:50:23.105 --> 02:50:31.828]  Folks, this is like... No, the challenge here is knowing that everything we talk about is true.
[02:50:31.828 --> 02:50:33.228]  That's the challenge.
[02:50:33.228 --> 02:50:34.568]  I don't care.
[02:50:34.568 --> 02:50:36.029]  Who it is.
[02:50:36.029 --> 02:50:36.509]  Somebody.
[02:50:37.339 --> 02:50:41.280]  Play this on your TV show without you admitting it's a giant experiment!
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:49.542]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're gonna love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[02:50:49.542 --> 02:50:50.423]  It is Down-N-Out.
[02:50:50.423 --> 02:50:51.823]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[02:50:51.823 --> 02:50:55.224]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[02:50:55.224 --> 02:50:58.285]  It's got 4 milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[02:50:58.285 --> 02:51:00.845]  It's got 25 milligrams of passionflower.
[02:51:00.845 --> 02:51:04.486]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[02:51:04.486 --> 02:51:06.347]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm.
[02:51:06.847 --> 02:51:09.508]  And 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[02:51:09.508 --> 02:51:12.109]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[02:51:12.109 --> 02:51:15.170]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[02:51:15.170 --> 02:51:17.531]  It's liquid, so it goes right into your body fast.
[02:51:17.531 --> 02:51:19.692]  If you take it subliminally, under the tongue, oh!
[02:51:19.692 --> 02:51:21.313]  Talk about blasting off to sleep.
[02:51:21.313 --> 02:51:22.013]  It's incredible.
[02:51:22.013 --> 02:51:24.534]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[02:51:24.534 --> 02:51:27.035]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.
[02:51:27.035 --> 02:51:30.416]  Get yours today, down and out, exclusively at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:51:30.416 --> 02:51:34.038]  40% off, out of the gates, with free shipping, while supplies last.
[02:51:42.698 --> 02:51:50.922]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[02:51:50.922 --> 02:51:55.824]  This experience, this life on this planet, is a reckoning.
[02:51:56.949 --> 02:52:05.797]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[02:52:05.797 --> 02:52:07.219]  And it really does come down to that.
[02:52:07.219 --> 02:52:15.686]  So, as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[02:52:15.686 --> 02:52:19.310]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[02:52:19.310 --> 02:52:21.572]  God is the author of us having free will.
[02:52:22.248 --> 02:52:25.589]  And that free will is a beautiful thing.
[02:52:25.589 --> 02:52:34.913]  When you look at mainstream media and Hollywood and this whole evil culture and Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[02:52:34.913 --> 02:52:37.735]  It's all about telling you you're dirty and you're ugly and you're bad.
[02:52:37.735 --> 02:52:44.758]  Because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[02:52:44.758 --> 02:52:47.359]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:01.727 --> 02:53:11.591]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Begich.
[02:53:11.591 --> 02:53:18.653]  So good to be here again on a Friday afternoon in most of the country just before noon here in Anchorage, Alaska.
[02:53:18.653 --> 02:53:22.695]  You know, I've not been on a couple of weeks and I do try and keep up with all the
[02:53:23.711 --> 02:53:30.973]  Email traffic, and that's kind of where I get my feedback from listeners, because as you know, I generally, and I haven't, taken callers, and I don't plan to.
[02:53:30.973 --> 02:53:38.374]  That's the way to get to me, info at earthpulse.com, if you want to participate in giving me something to talk about.
[02:53:38.374 --> 02:53:40.495]  But don't overload me, man!
[02:53:40.495 --> 02:53:43.415]  If you got an assignment for me, don't do that, don't do that.
[02:53:43.415 --> 02:53:50.036]  If you want to do that, you go upstairs first, ask that guy, he comes over, he dumps it in, and then I get my instructions that way.
[02:53:50.036 --> 02:53:52.157]  So, don't add anything to my backpack.
[02:53:53.038 --> 02:53:57.901]  But that's the way you reach out to me, info at earthpulse.com.
[02:53:57.901 --> 02:54:05.065]  And I want to take the first couple of minutes and I want to talk about the last feed because I have all different reactions from one.
[02:54:05.065 --> 02:54:08.847]  I got a few that said, oh, that guy must be on drugs to run that fast.
[02:54:08.847 --> 02:54:12.449]  And so I'll try and slow it down to reassure everyone that is not the case.
[02:54:13.911 --> 02:54:14.852]  But that was kind of funny.
[02:54:14.852 --> 02:54:17.956]  At first a little offensive, you know, but then I thought it was kind of funny.
[02:54:17.956 --> 02:54:21.840]  Because I always run it slow most of the time and if I pick it up I forget.
[02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:27.286]  There's some people that just can't keep up when you're picking it up and when you're jamming it out and making it move and all that happens.
[02:54:27.842 --> 02:54:29.023]  Makes people nervous.
[02:54:29.023 --> 02:54:31.744]  So I'll try and slow it down, pace it out.
[02:54:31.744 --> 02:54:38.188]  But I lost the conclusion of that, which I talked about a lot of misery in my life, and people were reacting to that differently.
[02:54:38.188 --> 02:54:39.208]  They didn't really get the picture.
[02:54:39.208 --> 02:54:42.070]  What I was trying to say is, I wouldn't change a thing.
[02:54:42.070 --> 02:54:43.991]  All the things you know about me, I wouldn't change.
[02:54:43.991 --> 02:54:48.954]  One breath I've ever taken in this lifetime to be where I am right now in my life.
[02:54:48.954 --> 02:54:53.176]  All those trials, tribulations, whatever you want to call them, I would do it all again 10,000 times.
[02:54:54.884 --> 02:55:02.608]  To experience what in my lifetime could be characterized as a very long suffering starting with the disappearance of my dad at a young age.
[02:55:02.608 --> 02:55:06.130]  So I started reading pretty seriously about when I was 12.
[02:55:06.130 --> 02:55:07.050]  I'm 62 now.
[02:55:07.050 --> 02:55:10.352]  That's 50 years, a half a century of reading.
[02:55:10.352 --> 02:55:11.933]  These cabinets behind me, they're not
[02:55:12.979 --> 02:55:14.200]  They're not empty, man.
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:16.883]  This is a real library.
[02:55:16.883 --> 02:55:19.465]  Somebody wrote me a nasty note once and said, look at all those labels.
[02:55:19.465 --> 02:55:21.707]  He steals his books from the library.
[02:55:21.707 --> 02:55:22.648]  No, I don't.
[02:55:22.648 --> 02:55:24.810]  I have a library in my house, see?
[02:55:24.810 --> 02:55:30.315]  And I have to keep track of what's where when I put it all back, you know, because I like to use it as a reference library.
[02:55:30.315 --> 02:55:33.678]  So I got about 10% of the books I've read are in my library.
[02:55:33.678 --> 02:55:34.278]  A little over 1,500.
[02:55:35.666 --> 02:55:59.509]  I think maybe 10,000, 15,000, pretty good number across many disciplines, many platforms from, let's see, psychology, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, economics, political science, government, how about Alaska history, national history, international history, philosophy, the occult, all of the religious traditions that there are that I can find, maybe a hundred or so,
[02:56:00.390 --> 02:56:16.993]  Over the backdrop of a lifetime and 50,000 hours of conversation with some of the most interesting people in the world from waitresses who are lit up and know what's really going on, that a lot of the CEOs I know don't have a clue about, all the way up to vice presidents, presidents, senators, congressmen, economists,
[02:56:17.722 --> 02:56:19.663]  Nobel Prize winners across the sciences.
[02:56:19.663 --> 02:56:21.324]  A whole bunch.
[02:56:21.324 --> 02:56:23.665]  So I talk fast because there's a lot in here.
[02:56:23.665 --> 02:56:24.826]  I never get it out.
[02:56:24.826 --> 02:56:28.267]  It's always frustrating when you don't have a way to get it out.
[02:56:28.267 --> 02:56:31.849]  So I'm setting up for a 10-hour continuous feed uninterrupted.
[02:56:31.849 --> 02:56:37.992]  So once and for all, 50 years comes in in a coherent way, starting with the human being.
[02:56:37.992 --> 02:56:38.692]  Us.
[02:56:38.692 --> 02:56:40.113]  The starting point.
[02:56:40.113 --> 02:56:44.155]  You and I. And the message is how to wake up.
[02:56:44.966 --> 02:56:46.267]  To this awakening.
[02:56:46.267 --> 02:56:49.089]  What are the keys to creation?
[02:56:49.089 --> 02:56:54.714]  What is it that lights Dr. Nick up and gets the game going?
[02:56:54.714 --> 02:56:57.797]  Because you are the spark of life.
[02:56:57.797 --> 02:57:00.939]  You are the flame within that spark.
[02:57:00.939 --> 02:57:02.421]  Wake up!
[02:57:02.421 --> 02:57:06.404]  It's five minutes to midnight, folks.
[02:57:06.404 --> 02:57:11.308]  It's time for a rumble to be felt within the earth.
[02:57:11.983 --> 02:57:25.172]  Where we rise into who we are as individuals, we project that into the world in a different way on a platform of love.
[02:57:25.172 --> 02:57:32.698]  Something soft that can touch us, that can change us, that can activate the living soul that we are as individuals.
[02:57:32.698 --> 02:57:35.259]  And the message today is the beginning of that.
[02:57:35.259 --> 02:57:36.140]  How do we do that?
[02:57:36.140 --> 02:57:38.662]  How do we change hate and anger?
[02:57:42.176 --> 02:57:53.765]  This is Greg Reese from InfoWars.com.
[02:57:53.765 --> 02:57:57.768]  I have many reasons to be grateful for working at InfoWars.
[02:57:57.768 --> 02:58:03.413]  One of them is that we support ourselves with great products that promote physical health and vitality.
[02:58:04.642 --> 02:58:12.467]  I've been using health supplements for years and I have found our products at InfoWarsStore.com to be the best.
[02:58:12.467 --> 02:58:15.749]  Especially our Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:58:15.749 --> 02:58:22.352]  Before trying Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I always questioned if vitamin supplements ever actually did anything.
[02:58:22.352 --> 02:58:25.895]  I never felt much of an effect from other products.
[02:58:25.895 --> 02:58:29.357]  But I felt Vitamin Mineral Fusion the first time I took it.
[02:58:29.357 --> 02:58:29.957]  Immediately.
[02:58:30.879 --> 02:58:32.940]  I love how it dissolves in water.
[02:58:32.940 --> 02:58:34.780]  I take it every day with my supper.
[02:58:34.780 --> 02:58:37.341]  It tastes great, feels great.
[02:58:37.341 --> 02:58:40.162]  And right now, it's 50% off.
[02:58:40.162 --> 02:58:46.724]  It sells out fast, so stock up now at 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:46.724 --> 02:58:49.845]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:56.628 --> 02:58:58.389]  Alright, now we calm it down a bit.
[02:58:58.389 --> 02:59:00.210]  I want to get your attention.
[02:59:00.210 --> 02:59:02.151]  I want to hold it.
[02:59:17.362 --> 02:59:21.764]  Or this hour, and I'd like you to think about what's being said.
[02:59:21.764 --> 02:59:23.785]  And I know that's a lot of energy, right?
[02:59:23.785 --> 02:59:27.607]  That's a lot of energy you saw out of Dr. Nick, out of Nicholas.
[02:59:27.607 --> 02:59:30.208]  Why is that energy focused in that way?
[02:59:30.208 --> 02:59:35.111]  Because you can control the energy so you have the effect, which is to get people's attention.
[02:59:35.111 --> 02:59:35.831]  I want your attention.
[02:59:35.831 --> 02:59:37.332]  I want to hear what I'm going to say.
[02:59:37.332 --> 02:59:38.212]  I think it's important.
[02:59:38.212 --> 02:59:38.893]  It's not about me.
[02:59:38.893 --> 02:59:39.413]  It's about you.
[02:59:40.578 --> 02:59:45.000]  And, you know, I go into this program, I start my day singing in the Spirit.
[02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:48.781]  It's a concept some people understand, others don't have a clue.
[02:59:48.781 --> 02:59:50.962]  I do some things in my prayer life in the morning.
[02:59:50.962 --> 02:59:52.923]  I spend about an hour in it.
[02:59:52.923 --> 02:59:58.625]  I'm not going to get into the details of that today because that's between me and God and what I believe the Creator is.
[02:59:58.625 --> 03:00:00.225]  And I'm not getting into brand names.
[03:00:00.225 --> 03:00:02.046]  I'm not getting into any of that.
[03:00:02.046 --> 03:00:04.347]  Because I think the most important thing right now
[03:00:05.311 --> 03:00:18.195]  Is when we look at the world and we see the chaos in it is we can choose some things about how we project ourselves into that world and whether we're going to be the victims of it or whether we're going to begin to become the controllers of our lives.
[03:00:18.195 --> 03:00:25.417]  I spent 30 years of the 50 becoming a subject matter expert in the area of mind control.
[03:00:25.417 --> 03:00:26.197]  I probably know it
[03:00:27.148 --> 03:00:42.281]  Better than most, and I certainly know everyone in the game, and I know a few of the people on the wrong side of that game, but what I do know is the knowledge that's been built has been built over not centuries, not decades, but a couple thousand years, perhaps even earlier.
[03:00:42.281 --> 03:00:44.923]  The knowledge comes from deep areas of thought.
[03:00:44.923 --> 03:00:46.424]  I've looked into those areas.
[03:00:46.424 --> 03:00:54.331]  They're in this library, some of it, what I've kept, what I've been able to keep through two bankruptcies and a bunch of other things, which don't take that as complaint because
[03:00:55.186 --> 03:00:57.088]  My torment are my greatest lessons.
[03:00:57.088 --> 03:01:04.094]  They gave me the ability to know what I can do and how to stand through things that others probably couldn't.
[03:01:04.094 --> 03:01:11.920]  I was gifted with the ability to take all that information and condense it in the brain God gave me to be able to project it out in a way that's coherent.
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:18.606]  And people know me as an educated, I mean a lot of different brains, but nobody knows me as me in the broader sense of what I've been doing.
[03:01:19.344 --> 03:01:21.547]  And that brings the knowledge into where I am.
[03:01:21.547 --> 03:01:23.791]  So I'm getting ready to do a 10-hour straight feed.
[03:01:23.791 --> 03:01:25.033]  It's going to go out on YouTube.
[03:01:25.033 --> 03:01:26.695]  It's going to happen April Fool's Day.
[03:01:26.695 --> 03:01:28.077]  It's going to start at 8 a.m.
[03:01:28.077 --> 03:01:30.040]  my time here in Anchorage, Alaska.
[03:01:30.040 --> 03:01:34.126]  What I'm going to start with is a lot of the principles I've been talking about, a lot of the science.
[03:01:35.607 --> 03:01:40.168]  All of the things that deal with the mechanical real world, the problems of the world, how do we solve them?
[03:01:40.168 --> 03:01:41.729]  What are those solutions?
[03:01:41.729 --> 03:01:49.871]  So I'm going to start first talking about who we are as individuals, not in the context of religion or any of that, but in the context of what I know.
[03:01:49.871 --> 03:02:01.654]  And I don't want you to believe anything except this, that my mission in that is to do one thing, is to cause people to look inside themselves, you to look inside yourself,
[03:02:02.765 --> 03:02:14.019]  And have a way of kind of exploring what's there, activating what's there, shedding a lot of guilt that shouldn't be there at this point but needs to modulate your behaviors perhaps.
[03:02:14.019 --> 03:02:16.282]  But those are all your choices individually for sure.
[03:02:16.934 --> 03:02:40.704]  What I want to do in a soft and gentle way is explain some of the keys to unlock that door into yourself a bit so you can make that exploration, reconnect with what I believe and many physicists believe with consciousness or what others call the spark of life or what you might call the breath of life or you might give a million different names or you might say your soul even.
[03:02:40.704 --> 03:02:41.785]  So I want to help people
[03:02:43.041 --> 03:02:45.242]  Learn some things to turn inward.
[03:02:45.242 --> 03:02:53.825]  Ask that question to someone and I'll deliver that in a coherent way, not in some telegraphed way through the internet in an abbreviated form.
[03:02:53.825 --> 03:03:10.412]  So I'm going to bring you into that conversation to explore what we're going to do today and what I want to teach today that are practical to take all of this energy that I could blow out as anger, you can see that, and it'd be totally acceptable on this platform and everyone would be fine with that, but that is not who I am.
[03:03:11.161 --> 03:03:15.745]  But I do have power in my voice, and you saw it as we closed out of that last segment.
[03:03:15.745 --> 03:03:18.667]  But it's me who controls the power of my voice.
[03:03:18.667 --> 03:03:21.129]  It's not my voice that controls me.
[03:03:21.129 --> 03:03:31.037]  And this is the power of self-control that builds into us the ability to amplify out of us the full energy that we were created to be.
[03:03:31.037 --> 03:03:40.545]  Which means our gifts come into play, the gifts that we know we have, and we find ways to bring those forward in our lives as we lift each day, as we begin to move
[03:03:41.405 --> 03:03:49.547]  The creative essence of what we are into the reality that we project and create and the actions that we engage, all of which are choices.
[03:03:49.547 --> 03:03:56.468]  So what I'd like to teach in this 10 hours, and I say 10 because that's what I know my voice can do, but I'll go until I'm done.
[03:03:56.468 --> 03:03:59.409]  And so it'll be recorded where you can get it.
[03:03:59.409 --> 03:04:01.589]  It'll be free access to everyone in the world.
[03:04:01.589 --> 03:04:02.650]  You can do whatever you want.
[03:04:02.650 --> 03:04:08.191]  And what I want is just two responses that will help me today decide what I do on this platform.
[03:04:08.191 --> 03:04:09.271]  I need one of two things.
[03:04:09.871 --> 03:04:13.474]  Send it to me at info at earthbolts.com.
[03:04:13.474 --> 03:04:20.739]  I want either a thank you, which is the message, keep doing what you're doing, Nick, or I want an F you that says, Nick, we don't want to hear it anymore.
[03:04:20.739 --> 03:04:22.140]  Find a new platform.
[03:04:22.140 --> 03:04:28.725]  I want to know what you think, because if you do either one, I'm going to be happy because then you're not sitting on the bank, just warming it, doing nothing.
[03:04:28.725 --> 03:04:30.447]  You've at least registered something.
[03:04:30.447 --> 03:04:32.628]  You say, I don't, I don't want to hear it.
[03:04:32.628 --> 03:04:32.949]  Fine.
[03:04:32.949 --> 03:04:33.529]  I want to know it.
[03:04:34.187 --> 03:04:35.108]  I want to hear it.
[03:04:35.108 --> 03:04:35.488]  Fine.
[03:04:35.488 --> 03:04:36.769]  I want to know that too.
[03:04:36.769 --> 03:04:46.655]  But either way, I win because my only purpose has always been to wake people up, to have an opinion, but based on an inward look first.
[03:04:46.655 --> 03:04:48.896]  Please, at least do that.
[03:04:48.896 --> 03:04:49.837]  Not for me.
[03:04:49.837 --> 03:04:51.038]  Do that for you.
[03:04:51.038 --> 03:04:53.739]  I'd like to give the keys to that as we go through this hour.
[03:04:53.739 --> 03:04:56.081]  Some of the beginning ones I'll talk to you about today.
[03:04:56.081 --> 03:04:57.882]  You'll get the rest later.
[03:04:57.882 --> 03:05:01.464]  But instead of starting with all the issues of the day, I'm going to start with man.
[03:05:01.464 --> 03:05:02.525]  I'm going to start at the end.
[03:05:03.143 --> 03:05:05.264]  Which should be the beginning of the story.
[03:05:05.264 --> 03:05:11.367]  How do we activate our minds being a subject matter expert in that?
[03:05:11.367 --> 03:05:21.873]  I know that to do that, to interfere with what you think, what you believe, what you feel, is the grossest violation that anyone can make against another living soul.
[03:05:22.737 --> 03:05:34.446]  The only one that judges a living soul is you judge your performance against yourself and your standard of ethics, map values, all of the things that drive you that you do.
[03:05:34.446 --> 03:05:35.327]  You know when you're right.
[03:05:35.327 --> 03:05:36.167]  You know when you're wrong.
[03:05:36.167 --> 03:05:37.048]  You hear it inside.
[03:05:37.048 --> 03:05:39.009]  Every human being has that.
[03:05:39.009 --> 03:05:41.011]  Whether you listen or not is your choice.
[03:05:41.011 --> 03:05:43.132]  How you listen is also your choice.
[03:05:43.132 --> 03:05:49.557]  But the train wrecks that become our lives are based on those choices.
[03:05:49.557 --> 03:05:50.418]  And when we think about
[03:05:51.824 --> 03:05:57.445]  All of this as we move into this next phase of what's happening in our world.
[03:05:57.445 --> 03:06:09.188]  We need to draw down now a different way of seeing that allows us to be calm when everything around us is falling apart.
[03:06:09.188 --> 03:06:11.029]  Calm in the middle of the storm.
[03:06:11.713 --> 03:06:13.514]  The peace in the middle of the moment.
[03:06:13.514 --> 03:06:18.978]  The breath that flows through us as a breath of creation itself as a trigger to consciousness.
[03:06:18.978 --> 03:06:20.919]  This is what it's about.
[03:06:20.919 --> 03:06:22.660]  I don't read from teleprompters.
[03:06:22.660 --> 03:06:28.644]  I can go from comedy to poetry to loud to slow because the vehicle serves me.
[03:06:28.644 --> 03:06:31.926]  This body serves me and my awareness.
[03:06:31.926 --> 03:06:33.567]  And I want to be aware.
[03:06:33.567 --> 03:06:38.990]  I want to be functioning within the creation as a co-creator with my conception of what creation is.
[03:06:39.739 --> 03:06:51.782]  My hope is that the words I give today will assist you in finding a way to activate yourself to be who you are, not who anyone else is, and to be that person.
[03:06:51.782 --> 03:06:57.623]  To be that person that doesn't rip themselves to shreds in self-condemnation.
[03:06:57.623 --> 03:06:59.103]  I want to teach how not to do that.
[03:06:59.103 --> 03:07:06.165]  I want to teach ways to help learn from our mistakes, elevate ourselves out of them in a way that always lifts.
[03:07:06.849 --> 03:07:14.915]  And we get out of this drag thing where we're, you know, we feed the beast, our anger, our frustrations, as we kick that out there.
[03:07:14.915 --> 03:07:19.459]  I'll teach you, if you'll listen long enough, of how that feeds the beast.
[03:07:19.459 --> 03:07:25.704]  And we create a reality, a hell on earth, by feeding the beast with emotions or power.
[03:07:25.704 --> 03:07:30.868]  It is the power of the occult draws it out of you when they can pull that out of you.
[03:07:30.868 --> 03:07:36.072]  I went through an exercise, maybe we'll have time to talk about it, where I brought a house guest into my home.
[03:07:37.017 --> 03:07:38.438]  And I don't get angry.
[03:07:38.438 --> 03:07:39.098]  I don't.
[03:07:39.098 --> 03:07:42.921]  Alex asked me one time over dinner, how often do you get angry, Nick?
[03:07:42.921 --> 03:07:48.064]  I said, you know, Alex, maybe once in a decade, every 10 years at most.
[03:07:48.064 --> 03:07:49.945]  I mean, what I call anger.
[03:07:49.945 --> 03:08:00.952]  The man in my home for a week, in my entire life of 62 years in that week, I had more anger in that week come through me than I had in a whole compilation of my lifetime.
[03:08:01.804 --> 03:08:13.689]  And I would go from anger to dropping to my knees, turn my back on that situation, drop to my knees and pray for forgiveness in the moment and understand that anger so that I would be able to understand it and not do that.
[03:08:13.689 --> 03:08:17.891]  Because sometimes you need the anger to wake up.
[03:08:17.891 --> 03:08:19.732]  I understand that's how it goes.
[03:08:19.732 --> 03:08:22.733]  So many people need that projection out of them.
[03:08:22.733 --> 03:08:24.234]  Someone else needs to carry that anger.
[03:08:24.234 --> 03:08:27.735]  So that's a lot of InfoWars is carrying other people's anger.
[03:08:27.735 --> 03:08:28.656]  So you don't have to.
[03:08:28.656 --> 03:08:30.096]  So we don't have to do it.
[03:08:30.096 --> 03:08:31.117]  Let's lift.
[03:08:31.954 --> 03:08:40.437]  Let's lift, let's transmute the anger into our own transfiguration, our own transformation, as we move in to this next decade.
[03:08:40.437 --> 03:08:44.479]  And where we live and where we live will be the way we live in life.
[03:08:44.479 --> 03:08:49.481]  I'll be right back.
[03:08:49.481 --> 03:08:51.522]  My enemies are your enemies.
[03:08:51.522 --> 03:08:54.783]  They're the globalists, they're exterminists.
[03:08:54.783 --> 03:09:01.506]  They're a consortium of mad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil whispers, vampires, whatever you want to call them.
[03:09:02.555 --> 03:09:22.342]  That are highly predatory and are setting up a false fantasy land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and electromagnetic radiation to change the very DNA of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[03:09:22.342 --> 03:09:25.202]  The bottom line is they want to play God.
[03:09:25.202 --> 03:09:26.203]  They are playing God and
[03:09:27.828 --> 03:09:30.929]  The noose is only going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[03:09:30.929 --> 03:09:32.790]  So many other people want to be positive.
[03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:37.432]  They want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with the new world order.
[03:09:37.432 --> 03:09:40.433]  But at the end of the day, it's all about depopulation.
[03:09:40.433 --> 03:09:41.633]  It's all about world government.
[03:09:41.633 --> 03:09:44.475]  It's all about the end of the human system as we know it.
[03:09:44.475 --> 03:09:46.535]  And on its ashes, a nightmare being built.
[03:09:46.535 --> 03:09:48.196]  Only admitting it can turn it around and stop it.
[03:09:48.883 --> 03:09:52.827]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[03:09:52.827 --> 03:09:55.449]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[03:09:55.449 --> 03:09:56.209]  Why do you do that?
[03:09:56.209 --> 03:09:59.152]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[03:09:59.152 --> 03:10:01.174]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[03:10:01.960 --> 03:10:10.746]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[03:10:10.746 --> 03:10:11.006]  Boom!
[03:10:11.006 --> 03:10:11.386]  We did it.
[03:10:11.386 --> 03:10:11.906]  It's popular.
[03:10:11.906 --> 03:10:12.667]  It's X3.
[03:10:12.667 --> 03:10:13.908]  Is it better than X2?
[03:10:13.908 --> 03:10:14.568]  You decide.
[03:10:14.568 --> 03:10:16.049]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[03:10:16.049 --> 03:10:20.092]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill
[03:10:21.052 --> 03:10:23.235]  Sleep Aid, and that is down and out.
[03:10:23.235 --> 03:10:27.919]  It's super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other.
[03:10:27.919 --> 03:10:35.107]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off, out of the gate, at m4wrestore.com and free shipping.
[03:10:35.107 --> 03:10:39.511]  Secure your down and out today, and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the M4 at the same time.
[03:10:39.511 --> 03:10:43.495]  Down and out, exclusively available at m4wrestore.com for 40% off and free shipping.
[03:10:52.592 --> 03:11:09.684]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:09.684 --> 03:11:11.805]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:11.805 --> 03:11:19.571]  Because there is a war on for your mind with Nick Begich.
[03:11:19.571 --> 03:11:21.472]  All right, stay on during the breaks, please.
[03:11:25.393 --> 03:11:26.453]  All right, we're back.
[03:11:26.453 --> 03:11:27.654]  I'm glad to be here.
[03:11:27.654 --> 03:11:31.895]  A couple things, just to lighten it up for just a minute.
[03:11:31.895 --> 03:11:33.016]  I've been saving this.
[03:11:33.016 --> 03:11:34.636]  I didn't have a chance to show it earlier.
[03:11:34.636 --> 03:11:37.897]  This is February 24th, 2021.
[03:11:37.897 --> 03:11:41.179]  Sunday, front page, or not front page, but back there, 810.
[03:11:41.179 --> 03:11:42.779]  But it's a nice article.
[03:11:42.779 --> 03:11:44.720]  Great promo for the team, man.
[03:11:44.720 --> 03:11:46.961]  You even make the Anchorage papers.
[03:11:46.961 --> 03:11:52.883]  A nasty article, but hey, as my dad used to say, the only bad press is obituary and only if it's yours.
[03:11:52.883 --> 03:11:53.383]  Otherwise,
[03:11:54.085 --> 03:11:58.487]  Call it a half a page of free publicity for the Info Warriors in Alaska.
[03:11:58.487 --> 03:11:59.627]  Three cheers!
[03:11:59.627 --> 03:12:10.372]  Hey, and if you're in Alaska and you're around and you want to give me a hand from time to time, send me a note at info.earthpulse.com so I know you're around and you're breathing.
[03:12:10.372 --> 03:12:15.775]  Anyway, and if you run into me on the street and you see me smiling, at least tap me on the shoulder and say hello.
[03:12:15.775 --> 03:12:18.836]  I'll say hello back and maybe stand around and talk to you for a few minutes.
[03:12:19.774 --> 03:12:30.902]  I enjoy doing that actually and I'm thinking about doing like a road trip where I stop in different towns and arrange so I'm in a park and everybody knows it can drop by and pay me a visit and have a chit chat.
[03:12:30.902 --> 03:12:31.842]  So I want to do that.
[03:12:31.842 --> 03:12:37.586]  I'm going to do that coming up as we get into more spring and more summer and more of the next chapter in my life.
[03:12:37.586 --> 03:12:39.868]  And you're going to find out what that chapter looks like later.
[03:12:39.868 --> 03:12:41.649]  But I'm going to get into the teaching of the day.
[03:12:41.649 --> 03:12:44.371]  And this deal is called love and relationships.
[03:12:44.371 --> 03:12:46.132]  I haven't figured that out from the front end.
[03:12:46.132 --> 03:12:47.473]  You'll figure it out by the back end.
[03:12:47.473 --> 03:12:49.234]  But if you go back and look at it, it'll all make sense.
[03:12:49.634 --> 03:12:51.035]  So what is that about?
[03:12:51.035 --> 03:12:53.075]  Time is space, right?
[03:12:53.075 --> 03:12:54.316]  Relationships.
[03:12:54.316 --> 03:12:56.277]  They take time and they take up space.
[03:12:56.277 --> 03:12:57.897]  You know, I got a house that's just me in it.
[03:12:57.897 --> 03:13:03.520]  As soon as I put someone else in it, you know, you got to collapse your programming and expand theirs.
[03:13:03.520 --> 03:13:06.501]  That gets uncomfortable in most relationships when they merge.
[03:13:06.501 --> 03:13:13.304]  And all of you are laughing a little bit now as you think about that through the trajectory of your past life experience on this planet as you've lived it.
[03:13:13.304 --> 03:13:13.744]  And it's a
[03:13:14.364 --> 03:13:16.806]  Funny thought when you think about it that way, but it's the truth.
[03:13:16.806 --> 03:13:21.088]  So you've got to provide space, and that creates tension, and that creates function.
[03:13:21.088 --> 03:13:24.790]  And as union comes together within relationships, those things smooth out.
[03:13:24.790 --> 03:13:26.091]  Or you get a bigger house.
[03:13:26.091 --> 03:13:28.132]  Or some people get two houses, and that works out good.
[03:13:28.132 --> 03:13:31.174]  They visit each other, have all kinds of configurations these days.
[03:13:32.463 --> 03:13:33.524]  Guess what?
[03:13:33.524 --> 03:13:40.833]  If it works for you, and it works for your union, and it makes you guys happy, and it supports your value system, rah-rah!
[03:13:40.833 --> 03:13:43.035]  Do it like you, not like anyone else.
[03:13:43.035 --> 03:13:46.720]  Another place to start the conversation about being like you is there.
[03:13:46.720 --> 03:13:48.582]  Hey, what kind of relationships do you want?
[03:13:48.582 --> 03:13:51.085]  For me, it's the most important thing I have, besides time.
[03:13:51.545 --> 03:13:54.727]  Because without time I can't even have one of those, you know, because I'm gone.
[03:13:54.727 --> 03:13:56.929]  At least not in this trajectory.
[03:13:56.929 --> 03:14:00.731]  Now we can talk about the multiverse or however you want to roll it out.
[03:14:00.731 --> 03:14:02.112]  I've got those books on the shelf.
[03:14:02.112 --> 03:14:03.473]  Some of the best physicists in the world.
[03:14:03.473 --> 03:14:09.117]  We'll discuss them in the course of review for 10 hours as we roll through the trajectory.
[03:14:09.757 --> 03:14:17.740]  So what I try and do is take the science, bring it into the practicality, put it in your life in a way that you might say, wow, that's kind of an interesting thing.
[03:14:17.740 --> 03:14:18.860]  How about I think about that?
[03:14:18.860 --> 03:14:21.101]  Maybe I do a bit differently.
[03:14:21.101 --> 03:14:22.421]  And that's your choices.
[03:14:22.421 --> 03:14:27.583]  So time and space, spending time with relationship is how you build them.
[03:14:27.583 --> 03:14:31.044]  So the quality of those relationships is all about that.
[03:14:31.044 --> 03:14:34.305]  For instance, at work, you have a certain quality based on a lot of time there.
[03:14:35.052 --> 03:14:39.918]  Or you might do remote work like me, where I dial in and dial out, no time in between.
[03:14:39.918 --> 03:14:46.386]  Yeah, it's okay for getting the job done, but it doesn't build the kind of relationships that could lift it maybe a little higher.
[03:14:46.386 --> 03:14:48.949]  So I drop into Austin about once a year for a week and
[03:14:49.668 --> 03:14:51.009]  Work on that a bit.
[03:14:51.009 --> 03:14:52.711]  But there's not any in between.
[03:14:52.711 --> 03:14:54.092]  Everyone's too busy.
[03:14:54.092 --> 03:14:56.254]  Everyone in everyone's life is busy.
[03:14:56.254 --> 03:15:00.997]  So what I'd like people to do is don't spend time chasing the other guy's trajectory.
[03:15:00.997 --> 03:15:03.299]  Turn in a little bit and dial up your own.
[03:15:03.299 --> 03:15:11.046]  Start providing some time, first for your family, then for your friends, and then the things that make your living, obviously.
[03:15:11.046 --> 03:15:13.348]  And then you might have something to share with the world.
[03:15:13.348 --> 03:15:14.529]  Make sure all of these
[03:15:15.329 --> 03:15:19.412]  Run smooth, or there's at least cooperation when sacrifices are to be made.
[03:15:19.412 --> 03:15:25.476]  So everyone's on the same warpath as it comes and it keeps calm in those relationships.
[03:15:25.476 --> 03:15:27.258]  So time is important.
[03:15:27.258 --> 03:15:34.543]  Think about that in the context of how you organize your life and always tie it to your own temple, which is your body, your physical form.
[03:15:34.543 --> 03:15:37.245]  Give 10% of your life to yourself.
[03:15:37.245 --> 03:15:39.346]  It is not selfish to do this.
[03:15:39.346 --> 03:15:40.247]  It is necessary.
[03:15:41.241 --> 03:15:43.983]  In order to be a fully functioning human being.
[03:15:43.983 --> 03:15:45.404]  Key one for the day.
[03:15:45.404 --> 03:15:48.086]  Save 10% for the temple that is you.
[03:15:48.086 --> 03:15:49.287]  Honor yourself.
[03:15:49.287 --> 03:15:52.530]  Honor your body that God gave you, however you picture that.
[03:15:52.530 --> 03:15:54.851]  Or nature gave you, however you picture that.
[03:15:54.851 --> 03:15:56.933]  Businesses say it's consciousness gave it to you.
[03:15:56.933 --> 03:15:57.934]  Okay, I'll buy into that.
[03:15:58.434 --> 03:15:59.115]  For the moment.
[03:15:59.115 --> 03:16:00.936]  Because that's good for the conversation.
[03:16:00.936 --> 03:16:04.880]  Doesn't alienate anybody because they were bad advertisers for the religion.
[03:16:04.880 --> 03:16:05.981]  Whatever that was.
[03:16:05.981 --> 03:16:08.944]  There are a bunch of bad advertisers floating around the world today.
[03:16:08.944 --> 03:16:09.765]  And you've all met them.
[03:16:09.765 --> 03:16:11.106]  Tripped over and they tripped over you.
[03:16:11.106 --> 03:16:15.490]  Want to shove something down your throat or pat something where the sun don't shine from the other end.
[03:16:15.490 --> 03:16:18.333]  They hope it compresses the middle and something else works out of your heart.
[03:16:18.333 --> 03:16:19.173]  Doesn't work that way.
[03:16:19.173 --> 03:16:20.515]  Funny way to look at it.
[03:16:20.515 --> 03:16:22.236]  See, I can be a comedian too.
[03:16:22.236 --> 03:16:22.296]  But
[03:16:23.743 --> 03:16:31.549]  I just want to keep your attention on the message, which is time is important than being there, which is space.
[03:16:31.549 --> 03:16:33.250]  You need to be together in you.
[03:16:33.250 --> 03:16:42.877]  So relationships with friendships, your marriages, your brotherhoods, and often it's your friendships that are deeper relationships than your biological connections.
[03:16:42.877 --> 03:16:44.018]  In my life, that's happened.
[03:16:44.514 --> 03:16:46.676]  I want to also say something within this.
[03:16:46.676 --> 03:16:49.119]  I feel a lot of love from this audience all the time.
[03:16:49.119 --> 03:16:55.825]  And when people hear about something going on in my life, I know there's people praying, dialing into the prayer stream that's running 24-7.
[03:16:55.825 --> 03:16:56.886]  They know how to do it.
[03:16:56.886 --> 03:16:58.828]  So do I. I want to teach more about that.
[03:16:58.828 --> 03:17:02.832]  I want to tell you the things I said about my family and the state of my daughter's not dealing with it.
[03:17:02.832 --> 03:17:03.813]  They're still not talking to me.
[03:17:04.531 --> 03:17:19.364]  But in the course of the anger in my living room for a week, I learned a lot about myself, had opportunities to present themselves within the context of all this to learn a great deal about my last daughter I'm raising at home, who amazed me in what I learned.
[03:17:19.364 --> 03:17:27.211]  And what it did is trigger the settlement of a lot of anger that was built over 25 years of my last marriage.
[03:17:27.211 --> 03:17:29.593]  It was cured and healing with my former spouse.
[03:17:30.211 --> 03:17:36.499]  That lifts her, lifts me, and lifts our children up, whether they're talking to me or not.
[03:17:36.499 --> 03:17:40.044]  And I want to thank those of you that prayed for that, because you gave me that.
[03:17:40.044 --> 03:17:43.629]  And that was the greatest gift I got from that day.
[03:17:43.629 --> 03:17:44.710]  And I thank you for it.
[03:17:45.464 --> 03:17:48.806]  And the man who came in my house and provoked my anger, I made her to study.
[03:17:48.806 --> 03:17:58.270]  I pulled the books, study what provoked anger means and dealt with that in a way that will calm me and use a greater, deeper understanding of that that I can share.
[03:17:58.270 --> 03:18:00.691]  And so I'll be sharing that as I drift along.
[03:18:00.691 --> 03:18:04.713]  And I've also talked about this idea of lift and drag.
[03:18:04.713 --> 03:18:06.354]  Key number two for the day.
[03:18:06.354 --> 03:18:07.634]  Oh, well, perhaps this is three.
[03:18:07.634 --> 03:18:10.536]  The one on managing anger, I think it's in there.
[03:18:10.536 --> 03:18:12.197]  I'll define that more as we go on.
[03:18:14.529 --> 03:18:15.629]  I have a lot to say.
[03:18:15.629 --> 03:18:26.172]  I'm going to try and talk long enough so it blows that 10 hours right out the door and you hear the longest smooth oratory from anyone you've ever heard in your life.
[03:18:26.172 --> 03:18:33.714]  It'll be poetry, it'll be humor, it'll be the whole context of who I am, and it'll teach you how to live in your life every day.
[03:18:33.714 --> 03:18:35.375]  Not mine, yours.
[03:18:35.375 --> 03:18:35.915]  How to lift
[03:18:36.630 --> 03:18:37.790]  And not drag.
[03:18:37.790 --> 03:18:39.871]  How to flow and not be crushed.
[03:18:39.871 --> 03:18:49.933]  How to move your energy into the world as a person you were created to be and the expression of who you are as a you that you are as God intended you to be as you are.
[03:18:49.933 --> 03:18:54.034]  To project into the changes of the earth that are in front of you every day.
[03:18:54.034 --> 03:18:55.034]  I'll teach.
[03:18:55.034 --> 03:18:56.334]  I'll provide the information.
[03:18:56.334 --> 03:18:58.435]  These are just the beginning of those keys.
[03:18:58.435 --> 03:18:59.635]  I have a few more for the day.
[03:18:59.635 --> 03:19:03.656]  I don't know how much time we're going to get, but I want to not lose sight of a couple things.
[03:19:03.656 --> 03:19:05.056]  So as you come into the next segment,
[03:19:05.618 --> 03:19:11.623]  We'll light right into that because I want to make sure I tell you how to dial in all that, how you can help me make that happen.
[03:19:11.623 --> 03:19:14.265]  So Dr. Nick Bagus has a lot more to say.
[03:19:14.265 --> 03:19:15.286]  Lift and drag.
[03:19:15.286 --> 03:19:16.067]  Let's get into that.
[03:19:16.067 --> 03:19:18.429]  Drag can be characterized as anything negative.
[03:19:18.429 --> 03:19:19.670]  Negative is easy to do.
[03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:20.591]  You define it yourself.
[03:19:21.295 --> 03:19:23.436]  Try and catch yourself when you're in the drag mode.
[03:19:23.436 --> 03:19:24.156]  Just notice it.
[03:19:24.156 --> 03:19:27.037]  As soon as you notice it, you gain control over it.
[03:19:27.037 --> 03:19:28.458]  This is key four.
[03:19:28.458 --> 03:19:31.739]  Notice when you're dragging and just decide not to in the moment.
[03:19:31.739 --> 03:19:32.799]  Just stop.
[03:19:32.799 --> 03:19:42.083]  Take a breath and I'll teach you what to do with that breath once you get it back and how to turn that anger into something that solves, lives, and does not hurt anyone.
[03:19:42.083 --> 03:19:43.823]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:19:43.823 --> 03:19:45.184]  Keys are yours to have.
[03:19:48.590 --> 03:20:02.441]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[03:20:02.441 --> 03:20:07.805]  And I, you know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:20:07.805 --> 03:20:08.506]  But it's true.
[03:20:08.506 --> 03:20:11.889]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:20:12.649 --> 03:20:15.112]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[03:20:15.112 --> 03:20:17.194]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[03:20:17.194 --> 03:20:18.956]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[03:20:18.956 --> 03:20:19.837]  And we're still here.
[03:20:19.837 --> 03:20:24.262]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility's going up.
[03:20:24.262 --> 03:20:25.883]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:20:25.883 --> 03:20:28.006]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:20:28.006 --> 03:20:31.810]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America's still quasi-free.
[03:20:32.410 --> 03:20:37.537]  You can't have InfoWars, it's been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[03:20:37.537 --> 03:20:39.620]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[03:20:39.620 --> 03:20:45.767]  So thank you all, and get into InfoWarsTore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more.
[03:20:45.767 --> 03:20:47.810]  They're wonderful products, and they support the info we're thinking.
[03:20:49.370 --> 03:20:52.973]  Humanity has been domesticated, by and large.
[03:20:52.973 --> 03:20:57.537]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all gonna pass.
[03:20:57.537 --> 03:21:06.744]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[03:21:06.744 --> 03:21:10.887]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[03:21:11.187 --> 03:21:28.719]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[03:21:29.299 --> 03:21:45.159]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[03:21:45.159 --> 03:21:48.583]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[03:21:52.381 --> 03:21:57.367]  Look, I've proven that InfoWars information is some of the best in the world.
[03:21:57.367 --> 03:21:59.870]  It's just absolutely on target.
[03:21:59.870 --> 03:22:02.934]  The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate.
[03:22:02.934 --> 03:22:04.455]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[03:22:04.455 --> 03:22:09.261]  I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered because I know that John F. Kennedy was right.
[03:22:09.261 --> 03:22:12.244]  A raising tide raises all ships.
[03:22:12.244 --> 03:22:12.385]  Now,
[03:22:13.138 --> 03:22:24.591]  The supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have at InfoWarsTore.com are the very best sourced, wild-crafted, organic, and natural product you're going to find anywhere.
[03:22:24.591 --> 03:22:31.219]  Whether it's Natural Defense, or whether it's Ultra 12, or whether it's X2, or DNA Force Plus, or Prostagard, or Vazovitz,
[03:22:32.003 --> 03:22:39.148]  These are all cutting-edge, top-of-the-line products that will help you and your family at the same time fund the InfoWar.
[03:22:39.148 --> 03:22:40.589]  So don't procrastinate.
[03:22:40.589 --> 03:22:44.052]  Take action today at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:22:49.329 --> 03:22:50.851]  The people are awakening.
[03:22:50.851 --> 03:22:53.574]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[03:22:53.574 --> 03:22:55.656]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[03:22:55.656 --> 03:22:57.999]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[03:22:57.999 --> 03:23:04.646]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this.
[03:23:04.946 --> 03:23:16.235]  To steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[03:23:16.235 --> 03:23:22.940]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[03:23:22.940 --> 03:23:24.361]  In their own words, they admit it.
[03:23:24.361 --> 03:23:28.805]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[03:23:29.265 --> 03:23:31.206]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[03:23:31.206 --> 03:23:32.287]  They're Faraday cages.
[03:23:32.287 --> 03:23:34.008]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[03:23:34.008 --> 03:23:35.989]  They work absolutely great.
[03:23:35.989 --> 03:23:45.135]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.
[03:23:45.135 --> 03:23:52.140]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[03:23:52.140 --> 03:23:54.781]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:08.247 --> 03:24:27.271]  Man, I'm really having a great Friday, and I'm glad you're with me on this ride, sharing your time as I'm sharing mine, because this is how it happens.
[03:24:27.271 --> 03:24:29.771]  You know, the one thing we do get, time.
[03:24:29.771 --> 03:24:30.831]  And I share mine with you.
[03:24:30.831 --> 03:24:32.591]  I was telling you that's the base of the relationship.
[03:24:32.591 --> 03:24:35.192]  I really do consider you my friends, even if some of you are angry at me.
[03:24:35.993 --> 03:24:37.855]  I'm doing what I need to do.
[03:24:37.855 --> 03:24:39.978]  What I do is programmed in from my relationship with the creation.
[03:24:39.978 --> 03:24:42.281]  If you have something to say about what you think I ought to be doing,
[03:24:53.118 --> 03:24:54.019]  Pray about it, then.
[03:24:54.019 --> 03:24:55.119]  Send it on upstairs.
[03:24:55.119 --> 03:24:59.001]  If he sends it over and drops it into my contest, believe me, I'll be on it.
[03:24:59.001 --> 03:25:00.962]  But that's the only way it comes into my trajectory.
[03:25:00.962 --> 03:25:04.204]  I'm not doing it either way, and I'm not taking instructions from anyone else.
[03:25:04.204 --> 03:25:06.245]  So if you've got instructions for me, it ain't gonna work.
[03:25:06.245 --> 03:25:06.965]  I'm gonna ignore it.
[03:25:06.965 --> 03:25:08.606]  Don't waste your time sending it to me.
[03:25:08.606 --> 03:25:09.327]  Send it upstairs.
[03:25:09.327 --> 03:25:09.927]  He'll send it over.
[03:25:09.927 --> 03:25:10.647]  He'll download it.
[03:25:10.647 --> 03:25:11.128]  Don't worry.
[03:25:11.128 --> 03:25:12.128]  It gets in.
[03:25:12.128 --> 03:25:14.209]  You'll see it in it.
[03:25:14.209 --> 03:25:17.411]  Now, because I'm doing this 10-hour feed coming up,
[03:25:18.044 --> 03:25:26.149]  You know, I did this segment, it was one of the lessons my sweet Anne, and I talk about her because she was my fiance.
[03:25:26.149 --> 03:25:31.692]  I had to break that off, but she is in fact, and we see each other just as friends, deep friends.
[03:25:31.692 --> 03:25:39.817]  She's a person I trust more than anyone in the world, just where she is health-wise, where I am in the work I'm doing, and all the things that are happening in our lives.
[03:25:41.579 --> 03:25:50.781]  I'm pretty, I've been running at 5% for 10 years and I just kicked it back in first year and it's scary for people, but she's good and we're there where we need to be.
[03:25:50.781 --> 03:25:55.342]  But she gave me this concept called, what we used to joke about called the naked hour, right?
[03:25:55.342 --> 03:25:56.682]  Being naked, you know?
[03:25:56.682 --> 03:26:01.923]  Because there's a man in the way I was raised being naked in front of a woman, make me a little bit uncomfortable, you know?
[03:26:01.923 --> 03:26:07.044]  So she joked with me to make me comfortable about who I was in terms of my own form even.
[03:26:08.224 --> 03:26:11.087]  And then who I was even at a deeper level in lots of ways.
[03:26:11.087 --> 03:26:13.268]  And she did it in such a gentle, sweet way.
[03:26:13.268 --> 03:26:14.469]  And she taught me a lot.
[03:26:14.469 --> 03:26:22.356]  And in that, instead of what always happens in a relationship, you know, the information comes through with, hey, man, you're screwed up.
[03:26:22.356 --> 03:26:23.316]  You know, change.
[03:26:23.316 --> 03:26:24.878]  Get rid of those white skivvies.
[03:26:24.878 --> 03:26:25.858]  I like colored ones.
[03:26:25.858 --> 03:26:29.121]  You know, your girl's telling you, well, I guess so.
[03:26:29.121 --> 03:26:30.042]  You know, whatever you think.
[03:26:30.522 --> 03:26:37.270]  Or whatever that funny thing is that just comes at you in that wrong way, you know, and all she's trying to do is improve you a little bit.
[03:26:37.270 --> 03:26:40.633]  It's a little more attractive of a package to her or whatever it is.
[03:26:40.633 --> 03:26:42.115]  You know, but we can come at that.
[03:26:42.115 --> 03:26:43.476]  Safiyan was always good.
[03:26:43.476 --> 03:26:45.479]  She said, have you considered, uh...
[03:26:45.999 --> 03:26:47.699]  Have you thought about Nick?"
[03:26:47.699 --> 03:26:50.900]  And she'd lay it into me that way and I'd go, and that makes you think.
[03:26:50.900 --> 03:26:52.220]  See, then you have to go turn in.
[03:26:52.220 --> 03:26:55.681]  She knows how to get you to turn in instead of giving the judgment from the outside.
[03:26:55.681 --> 03:26:57.881]  You know, hey, have you thought about, have you considered?
[03:26:57.881 --> 03:27:03.062]  Nice way to get you to turn in on the question and answer it yourself and project out what your answer might be.
[03:27:03.062 --> 03:27:06.103]  And generally, it's more gentler and more softer.
[03:27:06.103 --> 03:27:08.783]  So Anne taught me the concept of the naked hour.
[03:27:08.783 --> 03:27:11.844]  So literally, when I do this 10-hour feed, it'll be kind of fun.
[03:27:12.404 --> 03:27:13.765]  Because I'm going to jump out of bed.
[03:27:13.765 --> 03:27:14.886]  The camera's going to catch me.
[03:27:14.886 --> 03:27:16.628]  They're going to wake me up, really.
[03:27:16.628 --> 03:27:20.411]  I'm going to go through my morning ritual, which is a ritual.
[03:27:20.411 --> 03:27:21.852]  I have a ritual I do.
[03:27:21.852 --> 03:27:23.673]  It's developed over my lifetime.
[03:27:23.673 --> 03:27:24.154]  It's how I
[03:27:25.074 --> 03:27:26.695]  Tune up my day and do my day.
[03:27:55.174 --> 03:27:55.614]  Yeah.
[03:27:55.614 --> 03:28:02.856]  And you'll see where I've been doing this show on these two baskets over here, which work fine for me because I get to reconfigure my life and get back into my frame.
[03:28:02.856 --> 03:28:07.298]  But where I do a lot of my work tends to be at this table in my kitchen.
[03:28:07.298 --> 03:28:08.258]  So I'll introduce that.
[03:28:08.258 --> 03:28:14.260]  We've got five cameras we're going to try and get rolling so we have everything captured right fed into a stream.
[03:28:14.260 --> 03:28:16.360]  That's where I do most of my work in between.
[03:28:16.360 --> 03:28:18.441]  That's my coffee setup over there in my kitchen.
[03:28:19.278 --> 03:28:23.319]  And, you know, and I like art, so I've collected art from all over the place.
[03:28:23.319 --> 03:28:27.181]  I got a lot gifted to me in time, and I make art part of my life.
[03:28:27.181 --> 03:28:28.901]  I've got some things for Alex over there.
[03:28:28.901 --> 03:28:34.663]  There's a Damascus steel sword I've got set up for him, a Roman fourth century I'm going to give him.
[03:28:34.663 --> 03:28:35.443]  There's a sword.
[03:28:35.443 --> 03:28:38.725]  Then there's some spears, because we're the tip of the spear here, folks.
[03:28:38.725 --> 03:28:41.986]  I want to get one of those to Alex when I go back down there.
[03:28:41.986 --> 03:28:44.707]  But sweeping in, we're going to walk into my space.
[03:28:44.707 --> 03:28:47.888]  This image on the wall with the cross is one Anne shot.
[03:28:47.888 --> 03:28:48.708]  It's one of my favorite.
[03:28:49.995 --> 03:28:50.636]  And this is it.
[03:28:50.636 --> 03:28:52.799]  You know, I come into this space.
[03:28:52.799 --> 03:28:57.447]  This is where I'll start this feed, where I sleep at night.
[03:28:57.447 --> 03:29:00.292]  This is where I do my morning prayer work, in this room.
[03:29:02.569 --> 03:29:04.209]  And I'll introduce all that later.
[03:29:04.209 --> 03:29:05.910]  But this just gives you kind of an idea.
[03:29:05.910 --> 03:29:07.630]  This is my living space.
[03:29:07.630 --> 03:29:08.951]  This is the space I live in.
[03:29:08.951 --> 03:29:10.771]  I have a floor below me.
[03:29:10.771 --> 03:29:13.192]  It's primarily an office.
[03:29:13.192 --> 03:29:18.813]  It's got a green screen setup, lights, all the things to run that part of my life, a full kitchen, guest room.
[03:29:18.813 --> 03:29:22.314]  And my daughter, when she's with me, has that space.
[03:29:22.981 --> 03:29:24.802]  And the daughter I'm raising, I've adopted.
[03:29:24.802 --> 03:29:29.386]  As many of you know, she's my granddaughter.
[03:29:29.386 --> 03:29:30.687]  She's biracial.
[03:29:30.687 --> 03:29:32.468]  She's black and Caucasian.
[03:29:33.328 --> 03:29:36.490]  And my son, my youngest son, could not do it.
[03:29:36.490 --> 03:29:39.072]  And so we've been raising her since she was one.
[03:29:39.072 --> 03:29:40.393]  And she is the light of my life.
[03:29:40.393 --> 03:29:50.139]  And in the course of this week of nuttiness in my own house with anger, I saw things in her that just touched my soul in a way that I've never known my daughter.
[03:29:50.139 --> 03:29:52.661]  I mean, there's so much healing in my life right now.
[03:29:54.853 --> 03:29:57.234]  I just, I can't be more grateful.
[03:29:57.234 --> 03:30:10.181]  But on April Fool's Day, I picked that day, and it's when Dr. Nick gets naked, explaining some of the keys to creation, and living a life of lift, and reclaiming life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:30:10.181 --> 03:30:17.565]  And those were read from my notes, and I read them so I won't be clear what we're doing, so it is a page of notes.
[03:30:17.565 --> 03:30:23.829]  But that's what I'm going to try and do there, because if you don't have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, if I don't have it,
[03:30:24.483 --> 03:30:29.087]  And you don't have it, then we have failed in what we are as a nation.
[03:30:29.087 --> 03:30:36.414]  So I'd like to bring some of that light back into the conversation in the most powerful way I ever have in my life.
[03:30:36.414 --> 03:30:38.035]  I'm going to deliver 10 hours minimum.
[03:30:38.035 --> 03:30:41.158]  I'll go as long as it takes, as long as my voice holds out.
[03:30:41.158 --> 03:30:42.439]  So it'll be calm and slow.
[03:30:42.439 --> 03:30:46.322]  Because if I can go 24 hours, I'm going to make the attempt.
[03:30:46.322 --> 03:30:51.267]  But I'm going the distance to deliver a coherent message that starts with you.
[03:30:52.027 --> 03:30:52.728]  We're good to go.
[03:31:15.033 --> 03:31:17.215]  There's a sign up, Nick's List.
[03:31:17.215 --> 03:31:18.337]  Don't send me a bunch of emails.
[03:31:18.337 --> 03:31:27.508]  I'm going to punch thing out on Sunday with a small video feed that will take you into the YouTube channel that we're setting up and I got to have a thousand people minimum sign up.
[03:31:28.203 --> 03:31:31.365]  To get that channel activated live by the 1st of April.
[03:31:31.365 --> 03:31:56.142]  So I need that as your mission, if you're going to help me, is when I send you that newsletter, go in there and activate that channel and let's turn Nick on and let's let the world get a feed in a way that you've never gotten before with a full coherent message of a comprehensive view of how I see the trajectory we're in based on a half a century of scholarly work, lots of conversation,
[03:31:56.822 --> 03:31:58.363]  Lots of delivery of information.
[03:31:58.363 --> 03:32:06.425]  I've done 4,000 radio broadcasts from one to three hours across 200 platforms with 200 different producers.
[03:32:06.425 --> 03:32:11.307]  I've delivered hundreds of lectures around the world in 44 countries, many times, many times.
[03:32:12.385 --> 03:32:15.207]  I've had a lot of experience I want to share.
[03:32:15.207 --> 03:32:16.328]  And then I'm going to disappear.
[03:32:16.328 --> 03:32:19.771]  Because the month of April, you're not going to hear anything from me after that day.
[03:32:19.771 --> 03:32:22.433]  When that runs clock runs, I'm taking a rest.
[03:32:22.433 --> 03:32:23.974]  I'm breaking from the world.
[03:32:23.974 --> 03:32:28.898]  I'm disappearing for a while as I determine how I'm going to do the next bit of my life.
[03:32:28.898 --> 03:32:30.599]  I've laid a plan and I've talked about that.
[03:32:31.604 --> 03:32:34.247]  But how I come back in, I don't want me to be the issue.
[03:32:34.247 --> 03:32:35.688]  So I break off from what I say.
[03:32:35.688 --> 03:32:37.711]  I won't take any interviews at all.
[03:32:37.711 --> 03:32:39.633]  I won't do any feeds at all.
[03:32:39.633 --> 03:32:41.375]  I'll just talk to my friends.
[03:32:41.375 --> 03:32:43.217]  And if you see me, be my friend.
[03:32:43.217 --> 03:32:48.783]  Or if you're going to be the F you guy, just come up and tell me what the issue is and be kind about it.
[03:32:48.783 --> 03:32:50.785]  And I'll be respectful to you and hear it.
[03:32:50.785 --> 03:32:51.726]  Because I do want to know.
[03:32:52.706 --> 03:32:54.367]  I don't want to provoke people to anger.
[03:32:54.367 --> 03:32:56.848]  That's the last thing I want to do.
[03:32:56.848 --> 03:32:58.548]  I want to provoke you to love.
[03:32:58.548 --> 03:33:00.169]  And that's my only mission.
[03:33:00.169 --> 03:33:01.910]  And I know that's the mission going forward.
[03:33:01.910 --> 03:33:03.950]  The scholarship supports that.
[03:33:03.950 --> 03:33:07.432]  I have a platform to speak with, speak on.
[03:33:07.432 --> 03:33:09.392]  I'm not afraid to face myself in the public.
[03:33:09.392 --> 03:33:12.113]  We'll have a feed where I've sinned against any man.
[03:33:12.113 --> 03:33:13.834]  They'll have a way to feed that in.
[03:33:13.834 --> 03:33:17.355]  And when that shows over, I'll admit anything that someone wants put on my plate.
[03:33:17.355 --> 03:33:18.656]  I will live a transparent life.
[03:33:19.136 --> 03:33:23.237]  I will encourage you to do the same by being an example of a transparent man.
[03:33:23.237 --> 03:33:26.978]  I'm not afraid to face anything in my past, anyone I've hurt.
[03:33:26.978 --> 03:33:28.538]  I ask for forgiveness.
[03:33:28.538 --> 03:33:32.019]  You want to bring it on the air, I'll do it publicly if it's required.
[03:33:32.019 --> 03:33:43.222]  But not a day goes by where I'm not going to say that we can lift ourselves to a higher place and every one of us has a power of change because we have the power of choice and the spark of life within us.
[03:33:43.222 --> 03:33:44.762]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:33:44.762 --> 03:33:46.683]  Nicholas is my new transition.
[03:33:46.683 --> 03:33:47.163]  See you soon.

[03:34:48.243 --> 03:34:51.992]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[03:34:51.992 --> 03:34:55.721]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[03:34:55.721 --> 03:34:58.327]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[03:34:58.974 --> 03:35:03.357]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[03:35:03.357 --> 03:35:09.121]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[03:35:09.121 --> 03:35:20.710]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[03:35:21.330 --> 03:35:23.471]  I need your help more than ever now.
[03:35:23.471 --> 03:35:27.574]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[03:35:27.574 --> 03:35:38.180]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:35:38.180 --> 03:35:47.725]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[03:35:47.725 --> 03:35:48.386]  Thank you so much.
[03:35:50.117 --> 03:35:54.141]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[03:35:54.141 --> 03:35:57.144]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[03:35:57.144 --> 03:35:59.767]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[03:35:59.767 --> 03:36:02.750]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[03:36:02.750 --> 03:36:06.373]  That's why Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[03:36:06.373 --> 03:36:08.676]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies.
[03:36:09.316 --> 03:36:15.559]  Are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[03:36:15.559 --> 03:36:18.720]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals.
[03:36:18.720 --> 03:36:19.680]  Because it's so simple.
[03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:21.821]  Because you won't be under their control anymore.
[03:36:21.821 --> 03:36:30.685]  Well, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the highest quality Vitamin Mineral Fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form, is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:36:30.685 --> 03:36:33.006]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[03:36:33.006 --> 03:36:36.167]  It funds the InfoWare at the same time.
[03:36:36.167 --> 03:36:38.028]  No other product you can buy does that.
[03:36:38.428 --> 03:36:40.350]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[03:36:40.350 --> 03:36:41.411]  It's very bittersweet.
[03:36:41.411 --> 03:36:44.615]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have a lot of credibility.
[03:36:44.615 --> 03:36:46.056]  But I don't care about that.
[03:36:46.056 --> 03:36:47.297]  I care about beating the new world order.
[03:37:01.357 --> 03:37:06.063]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[03:37:06.063 --> 03:37:09.408]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[03:37:09.408 --> 03:37:10.930]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[03:37:10.930 --> 03:37:12.132]  But let's just say this.
[03:37:12.132 --> 03:37:13.453]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[03:37:13.453 --> 03:37:15.897]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[03:37:16.537 --> 03:37:20.179]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at Infolwerestore.com.
[03:37:20.179 --> 03:37:21.240]  They're great products.
[03:37:21.240 --> 03:37:22.740]  Plus they fund the operation.
[03:37:22.740 --> 03:37:25.942]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[03:37:25.942 --> 03:37:26.763]  Do they fund freedom?
[03:37:26.763 --> 03:37:27.883]  No, a lot of them don't.
[03:37:27.883 --> 03:37:34.346]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[03:37:34.346 --> 03:37:36.067]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[03:37:36.067 --> 03:37:38.909]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[03:37:39.469 --> 03:37:42.591]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[03:37:42.591 --> 03:37:52.136]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[03:37:52.136 --> 03:37:54.797]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:10.262 --> 03:38:18.006]  You know, it always goes so fast and I got the whole hour and I'm into the last 10 minutes of broadcast time.
[03:38:18.006 --> 03:38:25.069]  But I have to say how much I appreciate everyone and how grateful I am for having the privilege of being here and having this conversation today.
[03:38:25.990 --> 03:38:30.495]  Because you do give up your time, and that's the most precious thing that we have in the world.
[03:38:30.495 --> 03:38:40.146]  And when we give it up to spend with someone, that's a precious moment for me, and I spend it with you with that sincerity, going with the time I take out of my life to do this work.
[03:38:41.368 --> 03:38:44.112]  And it's my privilege.
[03:38:44.112 --> 03:38:45.354]  You know, that's why I'm always happy.
[03:38:45.354 --> 03:38:46.215]  This is my gift.
[03:38:46.215 --> 03:38:46.976]  This is what I do.
[03:38:46.976 --> 03:38:56.071]  I use my voice with full intent that will empower people that you might change your world and the rest of the world as well as a consequence of that.
[03:38:56.871 --> 03:38:58.172]  Not that we have to.
[03:38:58.172 --> 03:39:11.141]  So I do it a little bit differently, you know, and I try to activate the individual to find out who they are and wake up and in the context of a lot of information makes sense to people and also in the context of my own suffering as a human being to make me human like you.
[03:39:11.141 --> 03:39:18.046]  And so the thing I'm going to do, you know, because I got this, you know, it's kind of bothered me, you know, the thing about people thinking I'm on some kind of drug or something.
[03:39:18.684 --> 03:39:21.954]  And so I'm going to deal with that in this 10-hour feed this way.
[03:39:21.954 --> 03:39:24.722]  It'll be funny, but it'll maybe make my mom uncomfortable.
[03:39:24.722 --> 03:39:25.544]  She's still alive.
[03:39:25.544 --> 03:39:26.607]  She's in her 80s, you know.
[03:39:27.538 --> 03:39:28.919]  So I'll have a mechanism.
[03:39:28.919 --> 03:39:51.154]  It'll be send flowers to mom card that pops up every time I embarrass her and do something to make you feel better and her feel better and I don't have to anything do with it because hopefully she's not watching the feed show to see her about later but flowers will show up at her house that'll make her happy that'll make me happy that'll make you happy everybody's happy and you can go oh man that's embarrassing Nick why'd you show that well because sometimes you got to show yourself so people know that you suffer too.
[03:39:52.069 --> 03:39:52.890]  But I want to make it funny.
[03:39:52.890 --> 03:39:56.231]  Now, if somebody accused me of drugs, all right, I'm going to eliminate that.
[03:39:56.231 --> 03:40:00.554]  At the beginning of this thing, somewhere on the front end of this feed, I'm going to pee in a cup.
[03:40:00.554 --> 03:40:02.135]  And maybe we'll run a contest.
[03:40:02.135 --> 03:40:03.275]  You'll get to see who holds the cup.
[03:40:03.275 --> 03:40:05.897]  If you can't hold the unit, you know, that's mine to hold.
[03:40:05.897 --> 03:40:08.799]  Sorry, I'm just being a little funny here, but I'm actually going to do it.
[03:40:08.799 --> 03:40:10.079]  We'll screen it out for the young kids.
[03:40:10.079 --> 03:40:11.260]  We don't want to do that.
[03:40:11.260 --> 03:40:12.501]  But, you know.
[03:40:13.221 --> 03:40:14.942]  I'm proud of it, but I ain't gonna show it.
[03:40:14.942 --> 03:40:16.642]  You're not, like, it's not live.
[03:40:16.642 --> 03:40:17.583]  So here's how we'll do it.
[03:40:17.583 --> 03:40:18.503]  So we'll make that happen.
[03:40:18.503 --> 03:40:19.243]  We'll do it at the beginning.
[03:40:19.243 --> 03:40:21.124]  We'll do it somewhere in the middle, and we'll do it at the end.
[03:40:21.124 --> 03:40:23.845]  That way, and I'll get everybody in the room who's filming this thing.
[03:40:23.845 --> 03:40:24.945]  They're gonna sign affidavits.
[03:40:24.945 --> 03:40:26.165]  I'm gonna get my turn to draw them up.
[03:40:26.165 --> 03:40:26.726]  Sign affidavit.
[03:40:26.726 --> 03:40:27.126]  Yep.
[03:40:27.126 --> 03:40:27.766]  Dr. Nick.
[03:40:27.766 --> 03:40:28.046]  Yep.
[03:40:28.046 --> 03:40:29.947]  Nicholas did the pee test, just like you said.
[03:40:29.947 --> 03:40:31.507]  It's all good.
[03:40:31.507 --> 03:40:33.508]  And I'll tell you what's gonna be in that pee test.
[03:40:33.508 --> 03:40:34.228]  I'll tell you then.
[03:40:34.228 --> 03:40:35.289]  I'll tell you, I won't tell you now.
[03:40:35.289 --> 03:40:36.769]  That'll be your surprise.
[03:40:36.769 --> 03:40:39.250]  And, and you'll be surprised, probably.
[03:40:39.250 --> 03:40:40.190]  But maybe not.
[03:40:40.190 --> 03:40:42.311]  Okay, so we slow that all down.
[03:40:43.140 --> 03:40:45.621]  We're getting in the frame again about what we're teaching today.
[03:40:45.621 --> 03:40:46.962]  That's important.
[03:40:46.962 --> 03:40:52.864]  And it's the keys I started with, the naked hour, which is being honest with yourself, which kind of goes right where I was, right?
[03:40:52.864 --> 03:40:54.385]  Because I'm about to be transparent.
[03:40:55.157 --> 03:40:57.238]  In a way that might even embarrass my mom.
[03:40:57.238 --> 03:40:58.199]  But I'll do it.
[03:40:58.199 --> 03:41:02.841]  I'll be a fool for Christ, a fool for me, in my religion, my view.
[03:41:02.841 --> 03:41:06.283]  But I'm not asking you to do anything about that.
[03:41:06.283 --> 03:41:07.564]  That's my model.
[03:41:07.564 --> 03:41:09.364]  That's my programming.
[03:41:09.364 --> 03:41:12.146]  I'm sorry if it's not yours, but please take no offense.
[03:41:12.146 --> 03:41:15.408]  I'm not the advertiser you heard before, and I'm not going to talk about that.
[03:41:15.408 --> 03:41:19.810]  Because I believe that it is respectful.
[03:41:19.810 --> 03:41:21.791]  I believe it is respectful.
[03:41:22.555 --> 03:41:35.201]  To be respectful of human beings on their paths, whichever alters they need to learn from to fulfill their destinies as God intended them to fulfill them.
[03:41:35.201 --> 03:41:41.284]  And as consciousness within the framework of each individual is framed around their experience.
[03:41:41.284 --> 03:41:50.048]  And I believe God is loving a father to every one of us as I am and wish to be better with my own children.
[03:41:51.903 --> 03:42:05.786]  So when I think of a loving God and Father, and I started cultivating that type of relationship differently than I have before, but in November, and in the course of this time in November, it has really altered me.
[03:42:05.786 --> 03:42:08.066]  I used a phrase that offended people.
[03:42:08.066 --> 03:42:15.928]  I have gone through a transformation, a transfiguration, a compilation of all I've experienced, and in my own awareness,
[03:42:16.528 --> 03:42:36.071]  All that data all that stuff I described if you think about it that's my data warehouse my data storage all the experiences emotions all that represents if you think about it data storage and as I compare it to the other parts of my life I actually worked on this for the evil side who have data warehouses you can read about it.
[03:42:36.551 --> 03:42:36.931]  I think so.
[03:42:53.792 --> 03:42:57.593]  Um, that was locking or even blocking our program.
[03:42:57.593 --> 03:43:00.834]  And it's the phrase, you are the resistance.
[03:43:00.834 --> 03:43:07.875]  Now that we know what that means as as info warriors, we're resisting that which comes against us.
[03:43:07.875 --> 03:43:12.537]  But in the common usage of the word resistance, it's used differently.
[03:43:12.537 --> 03:43:15.737]  It's resist what's being said is how most people see it.
[03:43:15.737 --> 03:43:18.118]  So we have set up with the very phrase we use.
[03:43:18.118 --> 03:43:21.639]  This is another key I'm teaching a lock on our own thing.
[03:43:21.639 --> 03:43:22.299]  It goes like this.
[03:43:23.081 --> 03:43:23.881]  Resist.
[03:43:23.881 --> 03:43:24.601]  We know what it means.
[03:43:24.601 --> 03:43:25.842]  It goes out of the frame.
[03:43:25.842 --> 03:43:33.704]  But the big push is what the majority of psychic energy, which is how it works, tied to emotions and meaning of word, which pushes us against it.
[03:43:33.704 --> 03:43:40.806]  So we have chaos within this cycle, probably within everything around it, and an inertia that doesn't seem to move.
[03:43:40.806 --> 03:43:50.449]  And I saw it when I asked 2 million people one day to send me a message, and I got 12 out of 2 million that are not lukewarm and sitting on a bench.
[03:43:50.982 --> 03:43:55.004]  So an F you or a thank you works for me if it gets you out of the lukewarm deal.
[03:43:55.004 --> 03:44:04.009]  Even if you fall on the floor laughing or crying or whatever, at least you're moving again and begin asking, oh man, is he right?
[03:44:04.009 --> 03:44:04.670]  Is he wrong?
[03:44:04.670 --> 03:44:07.471]  That's a good question to ask yourself, not me.
[03:44:07.471 --> 03:44:12.174]  And that's what I'd like you to do is let's come together in a different way.
[03:44:12.174 --> 03:44:19.058]  Recognize the dignity and respect that each of us should share with one another and come together in a different way.
[03:44:20.095 --> 03:44:31.379]  Where we actually look into each other's eyes, that we see the vision that we share in the spark of life that we are.
[03:44:31.379 --> 03:44:36.200]  Look into that eye of the person next to you that you share your life with.
[03:44:36.200 --> 03:44:44.423]  More importantly, when you look in the mirror in the morning, look directly in your eyes after you've done the surface work of teeth and makeup.
[03:44:44.423 --> 03:44:46.623]  Look in your own eyes.
[03:44:46.623 --> 03:44:49.004]  Gaze into your own self for just a moment.
[03:44:49.600 --> 03:44:53.562]  And reconnect with yourself in that morning breath.
[03:44:53.562 --> 03:44:58.445]  As you breathe in the breath of life, look in your own eyes and decide who's responsible for your day.
[03:44:58.445 --> 03:45:00.086]  You'll discover them there.
[03:45:00.086 --> 03:45:06.690]  Your best critic, the only one worth listening to, looking in your own eyes in the morning, is how you'll start your day.
[03:45:06.690 --> 03:45:16.316]  And then as you've contemplated in your mind how that day will roll out, things you'll see and the people you know, and how you're going to smile into that, lift them everywhere you go, you'll be able to set that up.
[03:45:17.012 --> 03:45:25.178]  Once you have that locked in, however you relate to creation, speak it in words so the vibration of your words actually goes into it.
[03:45:25.178 --> 03:45:29.281]  No one's there with you in the bathroom but you and consciousness itself.
[03:45:29.281 --> 03:45:31.603]  It's a way to connect with yourself in the morning.
[03:45:31.603 --> 03:45:44.953]  Start out your day and own your day all the way through the day and reflecting on that moment when you looked in your own eyes whenever you start to drag and remember that's the one carrying your day today and you're linked to consciousness.
[03:45:45.749 --> 03:45:48.771]  Is carrying the weight of anything dragging you down.
[03:45:48.771 --> 03:45:50.653]  Keep your trajectory up.
[03:45:50.653 --> 03:45:54.696]  End of the day, brush your teeth, wash your face, do things you can do at night.
[03:45:54.696 --> 03:45:56.277]  Get the makeup off.
[03:45:56.277 --> 03:45:57.638]  Do it again.
[03:45:57.638 --> 03:45:58.739]  Just for a few moments.
[03:45:58.739 --> 03:46:00.360]  One minute is all it takes.
[03:46:00.360 --> 03:46:01.201]  This is another key.
[03:46:01.201 --> 03:46:02.281]  This is a key.
[03:46:02.281 --> 03:46:04.243]  Run it in the back end of your day.
[03:46:04.243 --> 03:46:05.824]  So you have a conversation with yourself.
[03:46:05.824 --> 03:46:07.005]  How did I do?
[03:46:07.005 --> 03:46:07.745]  How did my day go?
[03:46:07.745 --> 03:46:09.807]  Did I do what I wanted to do?
[03:46:09.807 --> 03:46:10.427]  Did I drag?
[03:46:10.427 --> 03:46:11.728]  What are the ways I could fix that?
[03:46:11.728 --> 03:46:13.069]  You make your own decision.
[03:46:13.069 --> 03:46:13.910]  You decide how it went.
[03:46:14.562 --> 03:46:22.361]  And then ask whatever your relationship is to creation to work with you as you sleep and as you get unentangled from your operating system.
[03:46:23.385 --> 03:46:32.030]  Kicks in gear because the separation of the memory and the emotion thing that drive us cause to react to be swung around by emotional to try to control that.
[03:46:32.030 --> 03:46:49.041]  How to kick in the awareness, your own operating system to own everything in your experience, your emotion to your operating system takes control of your data warehouse instead of letting it run wild, which is what it does reacting to everyone else's movement within the reality we live in.
[03:46:49.581 --> 03:46:55.463]  So it's important for you to find the you in you that gives you the power to understand what's happening.
[03:46:55.463 --> 03:47:04.646]  I'll teach this in a way that you've never heard before, that has nothing to do with your religion, but has everything to do with what creation is, according to the best science in the world.
[03:47:05.226 --> 03:47:12.893]  And that takes you into the realm of consciousness, which takes you in the realm of God and love and what consciousness is.
[03:47:12.893 --> 03:47:24.844]  You may not like the words in which I frame it, but I will give you a coherent way to consider it, a way that will change the world, perhaps change you, and will complete what I believe my primary mission in this lifetime is.
[03:47:24.844 --> 03:47:26.626]  That feed is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:47:26.626 --> 03:47:27.827]  After that, I need a month.
[03:47:28.450 --> 03:47:36.675]  To figure out what I'm going to do, because the only thing I want to change in this world is I want to activate people to recognize themselves.
[03:47:36.675 --> 03:47:53.705]  And then I have to decide how I do that within the framework of my life, the resources creation has given me to put in play, to do my part of encouraging you to lift, not drag, come into the spirit that we're intended to be as created human beings.
[03:47:54.305 --> 03:47:57.468]  Manifest love in this earth in a very different way.
[03:47:57.468 --> 03:47:59.390]  I need you to get on my list.
[03:47:59.390 --> 03:48:05.315]  I need you to look at info at earthbolts.com and I need you to support this network.
[03:48:05.315 --> 03:48:06.856]  Support everyone on this network.
[03:48:06.856 --> 03:48:07.977]  It's a paycheck I don't.
[03:48:08.627 --> 03:48:10.869]  But they do and they need to be there.
[03:48:10.869 --> 03:48:16.174]  Help Alex Jones now when he needs it the most because now is the hour.
[03:48:16.174 --> 03:48:18.336]  Now we have the power to make the change.
[03:48:18.336 --> 03:48:27.225]  If we can come into who we are and manifest the gifts of creation in this earth and bring down a new earth into this frame.
[03:48:27.225 --> 03:48:34.272]  This is Dr. Nick Baggage, Nicholas, April 1st, arriving 10 hours deep.
[03:48:34.272 --> 03:48:36.133]  Get in it to win it.
[03:48:36.133 --> 03:48:36.734]  Thanks for being here.
