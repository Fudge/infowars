[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:13.000 --> 00:34.500]  front lines of the Info War. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen
[00:34.500 --> 00:40.720]  last night Joe Biden announced the nation that you're all slaves to big pharma said you cannot
[00:40.720 --> 00:48.520]  be free again until you consume big pharma's vaccine. And so we've done something special
[00:48.520 --> 00:54.880]  for you here at Info Wars. And you know, a lot of people obviously were watching Biden's
[00:54.880 --> 01:00.400]  address. It was his biggest live audience yet ever. It actually hit 10,000 people live
[01:00.400 --> 01:04.200]  on the internet. That's by far his biggest audience. Trump gets millions, but you know,
[01:04.200 --> 01:09.360]  he lost to Biden supposedly. But we were able so while everybody was listening to Biden
[01:09.360 --> 01:17.840]  talking, we were able to pull off some Info Wars magic. We actually had a microphone inside
[01:17.840 --> 01:26.040]  Joe Biden's head in his mind. So look, this is a family audience. So I have to warn you,
[01:26.040 --> 01:32.360]  you're about to go into Joe Biden's mind. Okay, this is not a place for children. Trust me,
[01:32.360 --> 01:38.920]  although they end up in there a lot. Now I'll stop right there. So we had a microphone inside
[01:38.920 --> 01:44.880]  Joe Biden's head last night as he was speaking. So we're going to roll in live time the Biden
[01:44.880 --> 01:50.760]  speech with his thoughts for the first time ever on live television and radio, the thoughts
[01:50.760 --> 01:57.320]  of a human recorded. And now we're going to play the video and in live time, play what
[01:57.320 --> 02:06.440]  Joe Biden was thinking. Let's go. Where am I? What am I doing here? What are all these
[02:06.440 --> 02:12.480]  other people doing here? These lights are hurting my eyes. Am I supposed to be reading
[02:12.480 --> 02:19.480]  off that thing right there? It's kind of far away. I'm having trouble seeing it. Whoa,
[02:19.480 --> 02:25.000]  who's that? Well, she's got a nice rack, doesn't she? Do you think my wife would care if I
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.800]  hit on her? Do you think my wife would care if I sniffed her neck? I'd like to go a little
[02:30.800 --> 02:37.160]  further. Oh, it looks like there's a child over there too. Oh, what do you think that
[02:37.160 --> 02:43.960]  kid smells like? Oh, I can only imagine. I remember the good old days when Barack was
[02:43.960 --> 02:49.400]  in office. They'd bring kiddos in there all the time for me to sniff and grope. Wait a
[02:49.400 --> 02:58.160]  second. Am I the president now? Oh my gosh. That's what happened. I'm the president now.
[02:58.160 --> 03:04.440]  Oh, I think I'm supposed to be giving a speech or something. Oh, that's right. I'm supposed
[03:04.440 --> 03:10.680]  to be reading that teleprompter. Oh boy. Don't look at the lady. Don't look at the lady.
[03:10.680 --> 03:16.440]  Look at the teleprompter. Look at the teleprompter. Read the teleprompter. Oh boy. The eyes are
[03:16.440 --> 03:22.000]  wandering again. Oh my gosh. I didn't even notice that girl over there. How old do you
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.040]  think she is? Do you think I'm too old for her? She looks like she's at least 18. Oh,
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.080]  that's right. Now I remember. I'm supposed to be telling Americans they can't be free
[03:35.080 --> 03:41.920]  again until they take the vaccine. Boy, it's a good thing I'm still up here talking. Otherwise
[03:41.920 --> 03:47.280]  I would have blown it completely. Okay, now to tell Americans they won't be free until
[03:47.280 --> 03:56.600]  they take the vaccine. Wow. Journeys inside of Joe Biden's head, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:56.600 --> 04:01.560]  Not a place you want to be. Not a place you want to be. Trust me. But you know what? We
[04:01.560 --> 04:09.760]  do have some news on what goes on in Biden's head and then what comes out as policy or
[04:09.760 --> 04:16.160]  what goes on behind closed doors where, you know, you didn't know, but big pharmaceutical
[04:16.160 --> 04:20.520]  companies and vaccine manufacturers are actually the president of the United States. But if
[04:20.520 --> 04:27.720]  beyond that, they're actually the kings of the world. And so Joe Biden said, if you take
[04:27.720 --> 04:36.220]  your vaccines, then you can be free again. And they even use Independence Day as the
[04:36.220 --> 04:40.960]  fulcrum point to say you can be free again, just like on Independence Day, but you got
[04:40.960 --> 04:47.280]  to take your vaccine. No. No, I believe that we fought for independence and liberty and
[04:47.280 --> 04:54.120]  that's what July 4th represents, not being forced to take a vaccine. How's it different?
[04:54.120 --> 05:00.080]  I get up in the morning and look at you and say, where the hell are we? I sell supplements
[05:00.080 --> 05:05.920]  for two reasons because they work. They're real. They're powerful. And because it's
[05:05.920 --> 05:11.880]  a giant market. But again, why is there a giant market? Because it works. That's why
[05:11.880 --> 05:18.880]  it exponentially grows. So whether it's saw palm meadow and other key ingredients in our
[05:18.880 --> 05:25.800]  prostate formula, prostagard, or whether it is the super high grade organic vitamin B12
[05:25.800 --> 05:32.000]  and ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ or the Tokyo 10 in DNA force or the pure deep
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.200]  breath crystal iodine X2, these are all the very best supplements you're going to find
[05:38.200 --> 05:44.200]  in already great market of high quality products out there. And it funds the InfoWare. So even
[05:44.200 --> 05:47.400]  these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're finding the InfoWare's you
[05:47.400 --> 05:52.800]  can't lose. InfoWare's delivers in space. Please visit InfoWareStore.com and get the
[05:52.800 --> 06:21.920]  products today. Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at InfoWareStore.com.
[06:21.920 --> 06:28.200]  It's Friday, March 12th, the year is 2021, and we are living in spectacularly incredible
[06:28.200 --> 06:33.080]  times. Incredibly good things are happening. Incredibly horrible things are happening.
[06:33.080 --> 06:38.640]  But we know this humanity is awakening as evil rises. Thank you so much for joining
[06:38.640 --> 06:43.360]  us on this Friday edition. We've had an extremely successful trip here in Florida. I'm going
[06:43.360 --> 06:47.360]  to leave it at that. I'll be able to tell you more about it in the future. I have one
[06:47.360 --> 06:52.960]  more leg of my trip to complete today, and I'll be returning to the ATX tomorrow. I
[06:52.960 --> 06:58.560]  want to thank Owen Schreuer, Tom Papert, the great producers, and the crew for doing a
[06:58.560 --> 07:02.480]  wonderful job while we've been on the road. And of course, the crew here behind the scenes
[07:02.480 --> 07:07.800]  on the ground with me in Florida that is really awakening. Everybody's down here. I'll just
[07:07.800 --> 07:11.640]  leave it at that. Not just the President, not just Tucker Carlson, but so many other
[07:11.640 --> 07:17.080]  great people are really coming to the state and fighting hard like Governor Sander, some
[07:17.080 --> 07:23.160]  others. Now, speaking of Tucker Carlson, I'm going to hit a very important piece that he
[07:23.160 --> 07:27.640]  put out last night where the Pentagon is now coming after him. That's right, the military
[07:27.640 --> 07:31.440]  coming after a U.S. citizen inside the U.S. for their speech. That isn't just illegal.
[07:31.440 --> 07:36.240]  It isn't just dangerous. It's a bellwether of where we've actually come, not where we're
[07:36.240 --> 07:40.480]  going, and I'll cover that in a moment. Then we're also going to be playing some excerpts
[07:40.480 --> 07:45.720]  when Owen takes over of the disgusting speech given by Biden. He's been under such pressure
[07:45.720 --> 07:50.400]  for hiding for most of the last month and a half that he's been in office since they
[07:50.400 --> 07:55.480]  stole the election. And he came out last night and said, does it matter if you take vaccines?
[07:55.480 --> 07:59.080]  There's still things you're never going to be able to do. They're never taking their
[07:59.080 --> 08:04.160]  foot off your neck. Now we see Democrats, communists, socialists believing they're part of the power
[08:04.160 --> 08:07.680]  structure, even though they're the ones losing their jobs and their future and the dollars
[08:07.680 --> 08:13.360]  position in the world. They're running around cheerleading in LA and New York and Austin,
[08:13.360 --> 08:17.880]  Texas, beating people up on the streets now that don't wear masks. So the mass Nazis
[08:17.880 --> 08:24.240]  are getting more intense, more aggressive, more out of control now as they see local
[08:24.240 --> 08:30.080]  governments and common sense starting to kick in and as they see state governments. So this
[08:30.080 --> 08:34.920]  has always been the perfect divide and conquer tactic. Now they're going to say, well, things
[08:34.920 --> 08:38.080]  never go back to normal until you're all vaccinated, even though they admit this vaccine doesn't
[08:38.080 --> 08:42.680]  protect you from the coronavirus family. It makes you sick. It's a hoax. They're just
[08:42.680 --> 08:47.480]  going to keep gaslighting, keep doubling down. But now let's get to this Tucker Carlson piece
[08:47.480 --> 08:50.840]  and I'll play an excerpt of it and then no one's going to come in and give his commentary
[08:50.840 --> 08:56.920]  in a moment. Let's first set the table for this. We have the new Secretary of Defense,
[08:56.920 --> 09:03.160]  Austin, who is a big leftist Marxist globalist saying inherently the main mission of the
[09:03.160 --> 09:08.400]  U.S. military is to crush white supremacism. And they say under military definition now
[09:08.400 --> 09:13.440]  that supporting Trump or saying that white people are inherently bad is evil. This is
[09:13.440 --> 09:16.800]  officially taught everywhere now. This is the big globalist corporate move to create
[09:16.800 --> 09:21.400]  more divide and conquer. And so this guy is a nightmare pick for Secretary of Defense.
[09:21.400 --> 09:24.920]  And now they have announced they're going to have pregnant women in the second trimester.
[09:24.920 --> 09:30.400]  We're talking women three, four, five months pregnant flying around an aircraft and flying
[09:30.400 --> 09:35.640]  munitions and troops in the combat zones. So the first thing we're going to get women
[09:35.640 --> 09:39.840]  not taking care of their children and into factories and to break up the family. Now
[09:39.840 --> 09:43.280]  it's going to be let's get the babies up there. This is all just to sabotage the military
[09:43.280 --> 09:49.000]  ahead of total AI mechanized robot takeover because the silicon troops of the silicon
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.360]  robots and silicon drones again will be commanded by the technocracy. They're trying to get
[09:54.360 --> 09:57.640]  humans out of the decision making process. And then if you think the technocracy is
[09:57.640 --> 10:02.520]  bad already rolling out robots in New York, robots in Singapore, robots in Tokyo, robots
[10:02.520 --> 10:07.520]  in Tel Aviv and freedom bracelets to make sure you're a good little slave. We think that's
[10:07.520 --> 10:13.080]  all bad. This is just the beginning. So Tucker Carlson understands this and you're not supposed
[10:13.080 --> 10:20.240]  to have the Pentagon and the military involved in domestic operations politically. It's unconstitutional.
[10:20.240 --> 10:25.400]  It's against the middle rights. It's against the Constitution. But we know just historically
[10:25.400 --> 10:29.040]  how bad it is when other countries go this direction. So the Democrats are creating a
[10:29.040 --> 10:32.800]  rapid reaction force permanently for the capital. They're saying they're main enemies, the American
[10:32.800 --> 10:37.720]  people. And now even the Pentagon come out in the media and release press releases attacking
[10:37.720 --> 10:46.320]  Tucker Carlson because as a citizen, he thinks it's wrong to try to have transgender surgeries
[10:46.320 --> 10:51.040]  in the military paid for by taxpayers. He thinks it's wrong to have pregnant women in
[10:51.040 --> 10:55.800]  combat zones. And again, that's his right to say that whether he's right or wrong. He's
[10:55.800 --> 11:00.800]  obviously comments that's right. But the Pentagon's trying to act like now following big tech,
[11:00.800 --> 11:05.840]  following Congress, following mainstream media, that it's normal to try to shut somebody down
[11:05.840 --> 11:11.000]  and normal to demonize him like he's the enemy. So Tucker Carlson, who I've known as a friend
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.320]  for over 10 years, has really transcended anybody else in modern media at his level to be able
[11:17.320 --> 11:20.720]  to put this type of information out. I can tell you almost the entire military, including
[11:20.720 --> 11:26.200]  women in the military, totally get this as a sabotaging of writing us and of the human
[11:26.200 --> 11:29.040]  force, the human military. So this is again about a post human world they're building.
[11:29.040 --> 11:33.120]  It's about sabotaging the military. China doesn't have women in combat. China doesn't
[11:33.120 --> 11:37.520]  have pregnant women in the military. They know that. But again, their own propaganda
[11:37.520 --> 11:42.000]  systems that own Hollywood and much of the MSM, they're pushing that here. So this is
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.080]  the military that says it's going to be domestically involved in gun confiscation under general
[11:47.080 --> 11:51.760]  honoree and all the rest of them now really stepping into that role against their enemy,
[11:51.760 --> 11:55.760]  the American people, because for decades down at West Point and at the Army War College
[11:55.760 --> 11:59.600]  and areas, they have taught the officer corps that we're a new world order, that they're
[11:59.600 --> 12:03.840]  going to preside over the end of America and the merger of America in this global system.
[12:03.840 --> 12:09.360]  So here's Tucker Carlson last night. Can't wait to see what he has to say tonight.
[12:09.360 --> 12:14.920]  Politicians have demanded it. Now, if you dare to point any of this out, they become hysterical
[12:14.920 --> 12:18.880]  and they become hysterical because they can't defend their own policies. When people can't
[12:18.880 --> 12:23.720]  defend what they've done, they yell. They can't even explain what those policies are,
[12:23.720 --> 12:30.040]  at least in public. So they attack. Your politicians like Tammy Duckworth say that it's unpatriotic
[12:30.040 --> 12:34.400]  to question the Pentagon unless you have served in the military yourself. You haven't earned
[12:34.400 --> 12:40.960]  that right. Really? Can only cops talk about police brutality? If you haven't been elected
[12:40.960 --> 12:46.360]  to office, are you allowed to criticize Congress? They're not making a real argument. They're
[12:46.360 --> 12:53.280]  trying to silence dissent. Not playing along. Sorry. Every American citizen has a right,
[12:53.280 --> 12:58.360]  maybe an obligation to know what the military they pay for is doing because our lives may
[12:58.360 --> 13:03.880]  depend on it. Today, the Department of Defense launched a large and coordinated public relations
[13:03.880 --> 13:09.160]  offensive against the show. Pentagon brass issued hostile statements. People in uniforms
[13:09.160 --> 13:16.080]  set up videos on social media. The DOD even issued a news release attacking us. Press
[13:16.080 --> 13:23.440]  Secretary Smites, Fox News host. Smites. Like we're a hostile foreign power. We suspect
[13:23.440 --> 13:28.400]  this is one war they might actually win. They've got a manpower advantage. We could play you
[13:28.400 --> 13:32.240]  a lot of tape from this today. It took up most of their day and we could marvel over
[13:32.240 --> 13:38.360]  it. Since when does the Pentagon declare war on a domestic news operation? Can't remember
[13:38.360 --> 13:42.440]  that ever happening. But we're not going to do that. We're going to pass because this
[13:42.440 --> 13:49.040]  is bigger than a feud with some flak at the Pentagon. This is genuinely worrisome. The
[13:49.040 --> 13:55.080]  Department of Defense has never been more aggressively or openly political. Tonight,
[13:55.080 --> 13:59.640]  there are 2,500 American troops stationed in Afghanistan and they remain there to prevent
[13:59.640 --> 14:05.840]  the fall of Kabul to extremists. At the same time, there are 5,000 troops in our own capital
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.680]  tonight. Also as protection against extremists, meaning people who voted for the losing candidate
[14:10.680 --> 14:16.520]  in the last election. Judging by those numbers, the Pentagon is now twice as focused on controlling
[14:16.520 --> 14:22.840]  our own citizens as it is on controlling the Taliban. Meanwhile, as Lloyd Austin hyperventilates
[14:22.840 --> 14:28.080]  about white supremacy, there are real threats out there and the biggest ones continue to
[14:28.080 --> 14:33.680]  be ignored. Those threats are not Syria. They're not suburban Virginia. They're not domestic
[14:33.680 --> 14:39.560]  extremism at least right now. The main threat that we face and everyone who is honest knows
[14:39.560 --> 14:45.280]  this is the government of China. China is ascendant. Their economy will soon outpace
[14:45.280 --> 14:50.520]  ours. China now has the largest navy on the planet. Why do they have that? Why did they
[14:50.520 --> 14:57.280]  feel the need to build it? Does that have potential consequences for us? Yes. If China
[14:57.280 --> 15:02.400]  moved against Taiwan, how exactly would we respond? More likely if the Chinese decided
[15:02.400 --> 15:06.840]  to close international shipping lanes, it would cripple our economy. If they decided
[15:06.840 --> 15:12.800]  to shut down our internet, it would bring our life to a halt. If they decided to occupy
[15:12.800 --> 15:17.280]  Malaysia, that would be a grave concern to the world. If any of these things happened
[15:17.280 --> 15:23.760]  or a hundred other things that might happen, what exactly would our Pentagon do about it?
[15:23.760 --> 15:29.680]  Can the U.S. military still win a real war? Those are the questions that matter. Those
[15:29.680 --> 15:35.080]  are the only questions that matter, which may be why Joe Biden wants to talk about maternity
[15:35.080 --> 15:36.080]  flight suits.
[15:36.080 --> 15:51.680]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, when we come back, it's not only the Biden DOD that's
[15:51.680 --> 15:56.280]  out of control. You won't believe the latest move from his Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.
[15:56.280 --> 16:25.080]  It's not good.
[16:25.080 --> 16:47.560]  Hello.

[16:50.320 --> 16:52.400]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother
[16:52.400 --> 16:54.360]  to know what you're up to because it's another business.
[16:54.360 --> 16:57.040]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.

[17:01.200 --> 17:02.720]  and we brought you a new supplement,
[17:02.720 --> 17:04.640]  a new product that we know you're gonna love,
[17:04.640 --> 17:06.080]  especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[17:06.080 --> 17:07.280]  It is down and out.
[17:07.280 --> 17:09.080]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[17:09.080 --> 17:12.040]  We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[17:12.040 --> 17:15.080]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[17:15.080 --> 17:17.640]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[17:17.640 --> 17:21.240]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[17:21.240 --> 17:23.480]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm
[17:23.480 --> 17:26.320]  and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[17:26.320 --> 17:28.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[17:28.920 --> 17:31.160]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half
[17:31.160 --> 17:32.000]  the first time.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.400]  It's liquid, so it goes right into your body fast.
[17:34.400 --> 17:36.280]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue,
[17:36.280 --> 17:38.160]  oh, how about blasting off of sleep?
[17:38.160 --> 17:39.000]  It's incredible.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.400]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[17:41.400 --> 17:43.840]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[18:01.280 --> 18:04.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:04.360 --> 18:09.200]  Yes, it's the Alex Jones show.
[18:09.200 --> 18:30.900]  History in the making every day.
[18:30.900 --> 18:39.340]  every day. The most censored news network in the world, infowars.com. Owen Shroyer sitting
[18:39.340 --> 18:43.820]  in for Alex. We'll be hearing again from Alex before the end of this transmission. It's
[18:43.820 --> 18:47.820]  been a crazy week here. And Alex has been a busy beaver down there in Florida. It's
[18:47.820 --> 18:53.020]  going to be a lot of exciting announcements once he gets back. I've got a news desk here
[18:53.020 --> 18:57.700]  that is just overrun. I'm going to get to all of this news. We've got Nick Begge hosting
[18:57.700 --> 19:03.540]  the fourth hour. And if there's time, I may even take some phone calls. If not, during
[19:03.540 --> 19:07.460]  this, I am back in the war room today. So we may take calls. Then I've also got some
[19:07.460 --> 19:13.300]  video clips of what's happening in Portland right now. Did you know Antifa has been riding
[19:13.300 --> 19:18.580]  in Portland for months on end? Yeah, that's not an insurrection, though. Mostly peaceful
[19:18.580 --> 19:24.140]  as buildings burn. They even let a federal building on fire with people inside once again.
[19:24.140 --> 19:28.220]  People are on the streets of Portland, mainstream media not interested. And of course, the real
[19:28.220 --> 19:36.540]  story is that the political class of this country, and yet to be honest, though, Republicans
[19:36.540 --> 19:41.180]  are calling for the wall to be torn down. I'm not seeing Democrats complaining about
[19:41.180 --> 19:48.340]  the wall except the one at the southern border, not the one in D.C. But see, oh, all of a
[19:48.340 --> 19:53.980]  sudden the Democrats are concerned about violence when it's in their backyard. See how that works?
[19:53.980 --> 19:59.060]  When it's in your backyard, they don't give a damn. They promote it and they bail out
[19:59.060 --> 20:04.700]  the criminals. But when it's in their backyard, all hands on deck. And in fact, we've got
[20:04.700 --> 20:09.780]  the numbers now of how much it's going to cost. Folks, when this whole escapade is done,
[20:09.780 --> 20:17.060]  it's going to cost a billion dollars, a billion. They're estimating if the National Guard
[20:17.060 --> 20:23.740]  under the current pretenses is removed in May, which is what they're saying, the final
[20:23.740 --> 20:30.700]  bill for the Democrat criminal protection, for the politician criminal protection, for
[20:30.700 --> 20:38.620]  Congress's criminal protection, is going to be $521 million. That's on top of the COVID
[20:38.620 --> 20:43.340]  scan that they just, the COVID stimulus scam that they just signed enriching themselves,
[20:43.340 --> 20:51.300]  bailing themselves out. Incredible. We've got vaccine news today. I've got news from
[20:51.300 --> 20:58.100]  the Biden administration that you're not even going to believe, including we're now figuring
[20:58.100 --> 21:04.620]  out what's happening with the National Guard and the Biden administration. You've got
[21:04.620 --> 21:08.300]  Pelosi announcing that they'll steal any election they want. Yeah, I mean, literally,
[21:08.300 --> 21:13.900]  that's how bold they are now. We'll be covering that. We'll be covering the Biden administration
[21:13.900 --> 21:19.300]  members and how each one of them comes in with a real dark cloud over their head. But
[21:19.300 --> 21:22.700]  you notice the mainstream media doesn't make a big deal of it. You notice that you don't
[21:22.700 --> 21:26.180]  have the protests in DC. I guess that's because the criminals have their criminal protection
[21:26.180 --> 21:31.940]  now. But remember when it was Kavanaugh or Coney Barrett or you named the Trump administration
[21:31.940 --> 21:35.580]  appointee. Oh, the protests were rampant. The media was all over it. They were getting
[21:35.580 --> 21:43.340]  inside the rooms causing chaos, no arrest, all charges dropped. But boy, oh boy, you
[21:43.340 --> 21:51.340]  look at these Biden appointees and it is bad. It is not good. So we'll be covering that.
[21:51.340 --> 21:59.660]  But of course, Biden last night, Biden last night gives his first live address. Now, I
[21:59.660 --> 22:02.740]  could open up the phone lines and ask, do you believe that Joe Biden was actually live
[22:02.740 --> 22:07.780]  last night and 50% of the people would probably not believe it. So I'm not saying he wasn't
[22:07.780 --> 22:12.620]  live. The point is, if you go look at all the videos of Biden's speech on YouTube and
[22:12.620 --> 22:17.540]  everything, and guys, by the way, pull up the CNBC one because nobody else showed this
[22:17.540 --> 22:22.660]  except CNBC. After Biden concludes his 20 minute address, which was his longest address
[22:22.660 --> 22:28.020]  yet, we tell the truth here at InfoWars, 20 minutes, Biden's longest address yet since
[22:28.020 --> 22:33.780]  he's been installed in the White House. And it was his largest live audience with by my
[22:33.780 --> 22:39.220]  numbers. It did cap. It did go just over 10,000 people live. Normally, Biden gets about
[22:39.220 --> 22:44.320]  4,600 people, maybe 800 tops. He got about 10,000 live last night. So that was a new
[22:44.320 --> 22:48.780]  high for him. Of course, Trump gets half a million live, but that's neither here nor
[22:48.780 --> 22:52.900]  there. Biden beat him, don't you know, with 81 million votes. So at the end of this video,
[22:52.900 --> 22:57.100]  guys, the reason why I told you to pull up this one at the end of this, no other news
[22:57.100 --> 23:00.740]  outlet showed this. And I wanted to see this because I saw it live, but then I could not
[23:00.740 --> 23:05.100]  find it on the internet. At the end, Biden, when he walks away, you can tell how weak
[23:05.100 --> 23:11.940]  this guy is. You can tell how he has to look down at the ground while he walks away because
[23:11.940 --> 23:18.900]  he's afraid he's going to fall. And so he's shuffling along and he has to stare down at
[23:18.900 --> 23:24.540]  the ground in his feet while he's walking because he's afraid he's going to fall. And
[23:24.540 --> 23:29.700]  so, oh, oh my gosh, no, they couldn't have edited it. There's no way they've edited this
[23:29.700 --> 23:33.300]  in the last hour. So the video is out there, but that's what I'm saying. Every other, there
[23:33.300 --> 23:37.860]  was only one video of like the six or seven that had the whole speech up there. I thought
[23:37.860 --> 23:44.020]  it was a CNBC. I don't know how they could have edited this in the last like hour since
[23:44.020 --> 23:48.060]  I watched it, but that's what I'm saying is no, everyone else cut away. But while Biden's
[23:48.060 --> 23:52.460]  walking away, everyone else cuts away while Biden's walking away, you get to, he's, he's
[23:52.460 --> 23:56.180]  stumbling. He can barely walk. He's looking down at his feet. He's afraid he's going
[23:56.180 --> 24:01.900]  to fall. That was probably the hardest thing he's done in a long time, a 20 minute speech.
[24:01.900 --> 24:07.540]  And then, and then a 30 foot walk. But here's the real story. Biden in his speech announces
[24:07.540 --> 24:13.700]  to you, the American people, you are a slave to big pharma. Biden announces last night
[24:13.700 --> 24:18.540]  for the whole world to see that America is no longer a free country. You are no longer
[24:18.540 --> 24:22.900]  an independent citizen. You are no longer a sovereign citizen, and you can only be free
[24:22.900 --> 24:27.580]  if you take your vaccine. That's what he said. And he said, we will have a vaccine for every
[24:27.580 --> 24:35.660]  American's arm. And if every American is vaccinated by July 4th, hopefully you can have family
[24:35.660 --> 24:44.500]  and friends over for a cookout and a barbecue. Hey, here's an idea. Kiss my ass, commie.
[24:44.500 --> 24:47.860]  Remember last 4th of July, how they tried to shut 4th of July down and close it and say
[24:47.860 --> 24:51.460]  no because of the pandemic. And it was the biggest 4th of July. You saw the fireworks
[24:51.460 --> 25:01.020]  all around Los Angeles, like everybody, lighting off fireworks. Out on Lake Travis here in
[25:01.020 --> 25:11.100]  Austin, it was like so busy and filled with boat traffic, you could barely even move.
[25:11.100 --> 25:16.900]  So Joe Biden, let you know last night, you no longer live in a free country. You no longer
[25:16.900 --> 25:23.780]  live in the United States of America. You are now a big pharmaceutical slave. Oh, but
[25:23.780 --> 25:30.180]  don't worry. Oh, because Independence Day isn't about free men, free women. Independence
[25:30.180 --> 25:35.420]  Day, July 4th, isn't about declaring your independence from corrupt entities, from corrupt
[25:35.420 --> 25:42.980]  overlords, from kings and queens and oligarchs and corporations. No, no, no, no. Now July
[25:42.980 --> 25:49.420]  4th is all about bowing to the corporations. Now July 4th is all about bowing to big pharmaceutical,
[25:49.420 --> 25:54.180]  bowing to the king makers. And Biden let you know that last night. You want to celebrate
[25:54.180 --> 26:00.740]  4th of July? You want to be a free citizen? You better take that vaccine. That's right.
[26:00.740 --> 26:05.980]  You want to have a cookout? You want to have barbecue? Take that vaccine. You want to have
[26:05.980 --> 26:09.740]  hot dogs with Barack Obama? You better take that vaccine. You probably don't want to do
[26:09.740 --> 26:17.540]  that, by the way. That I would avoid. But so the big announcement last night from Biden,
[26:17.540 --> 26:25.180]  the big announcement, you are all slaves. You are not free. No, you cannot move about
[26:25.180 --> 26:31.380]  the country freely. No, you cannot have family and friends over. No, no, you cannot celebrate
[26:31.380 --> 26:38.700]  Independence Day because you're not independent. That is until you take our vaccine, which
[26:38.700 --> 26:43.980]  is not even a vaccine. It's experimental gene therapy biotechnology, which is going to
[26:43.980 --> 26:47.580]  kill probably about 1% of the people that take it. But I don't care because they're
[26:47.580 --> 26:52.060]  doing a worldwide experiment on humanity. We thought you were free. Well, I'm here to
[26:52.060 --> 26:59.900]  remind you you're not. You're a slave to big pharma medical tyranny. The word apocalypse
[26:59.900 --> 27:08.580]  means the revealing of what was once hidden. And now that all the lies are being revealed,
[27:08.580 --> 27:15.820]  what will you do? We know that millions will do absolutely nothing. They will do whatever
[27:15.820 --> 27:23.540]  they are told as if obedience is a virtue. It is the Patriots of the world versus everybody
[27:23.540 --> 27:30.980]  else. I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United
[27:30.980 --> 27:38.900]  States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance
[27:38.900 --> 27:44.500]  to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation for purpose
[27:44.500 --> 27:51.460]  of evasion. And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can. So help
[27:51.460 --> 27:52.460]  me God.
[27:52.460 --> 28:04.300]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large. The population has been trained to submit
[28:04.300 --> 28:08.980]  to what you're told that's all going to pass. But if you study authoritarians, if you study
[28:08.980 --> 28:13.060]  the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta
[28:13.060 --> 28:16.860]  and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved. And because the globalists
[28:16.860 --> 28:21.460]  see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move. And they are collapsing
[28:21.460 --> 28:25.620]  the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that
[28:25.620 --> 28:31.900]  the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate
[28:31.900 --> 28:36.540]  to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood
[28:36.540 --> 28:42.540]  of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate change as the UN and Klaus
[28:42.540 --> 28:47.980]  Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year long lockdowns that the
[28:47.980 --> 28:53.860]  UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank
[28:53.860 --> 28:58.460]  money. And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist.
[28:58.460 --> 29:03.580]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset. They figured out that the globalists
[29:03.580 --> 29:08.220]  are literally trying to kill us. They're trying to take over civilization and society and
[29:08.220 --> 29:13.340]  they depend on the public being ignorant. That's why Jesus said my people perish for
[29:13.340 --> 29:18.900]  lack of knowledge. Knowledge is power. Like our bodies are made up of all these tissues
[29:18.900 --> 29:24.300]  and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals. And that's why they
[29:24.300 --> 29:28.300]  don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because it's so simple because
[29:28.300 --> 29:32.220]  you won't be under their control anymore. Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest
[29:32.220 --> 29:36.820]  quality vitamin mineral fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form is now back
[29:36.820 --> 29:41.340]  in stock at infowarstore.com. And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[29:41.340 --> 29:47.340]  It funds the info war at the same time. No other product you can buy does that. So again,
[29:47.340 --> 29:52.180]  infowarstore.com, it's back in stock, 50% off vitamin mineral fusion. I'm going to keep
[29:52.180 --> 29:56.460]  it at that until it sells out. So take action today and give it to your friends and family
[29:56.460 --> 29:58.340]  as a gift.
[29:58.340 --> 30:03.060]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked
[30:03.060 --> 30:06.740]  about has happened just like we said it would. And now we have a lot of credibility, but
[30:06.740 --> 30:10.460]  I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order. And it's because we have
[30:10.460 --> 30:14.820]  so much credibility. They can't allow us to stay on air much longer. And I don't have
[30:14.820 --> 30:18.140]  time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us. For a lot of reasons, I can't tell
[30:18.140 --> 30:22.180]  you what's going on. But let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end. We're
[30:22.180 --> 30:27.260]  going to stay on air as long as we can. So please pray for us and please buy the products
[30:27.260 --> 30:31.820]  and infowarstore.com. They're great products. Plus, they fund the operation. So you know,
[30:31.820 --> 30:35.340]  unlike other products you can buy, they're still great. Do they fund freedom? No, a lot
[30:35.340 --> 30:40.260]  of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice. When the whole
[30:40.260 --> 30:44.740]  world's waking up and looking for truth, that's why the globalists are censoring. They can't
[30:44.740 --> 30:48.620]  bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us from the air. So while you're at it,
[30:48.620 --> 30:52.380]  don't just financially support us and spread the word. Download everything we've done.
[30:52.380 --> 30:55.900]  You can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and
[30:55.900 --> 31:02.540]  the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said. You're listening to the Alex
[31:02.540 --> 31:25.020]  Jones show. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[31:25.020 --> 31:39.340]  lines of the info war that basically developed the theory of gravity, as we know, and so
[31:39.340 --> 31:44.100]  much more. And he postulated has been proven to be very accurate across the scientific
[31:44.100 --> 31:50.260]  studies of every field that for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction. And
[31:50.260 --> 31:54.300]  we're seeing that right now. So as bad as Joe Biden and the globalists and chai comms are
[31:54.300 --> 31:58.900]  stealing the election, that is making people dig their heels in and is causing what they
[31:58.900 --> 32:04.020]  call the counterrevolution against it. And it is absolutely massive. I ran into here
[32:04.020 --> 32:10.740]  in Southern Florida where I met today, yesterday, an amazing, uh, Irish American who had come
[32:10.740 --> 32:16.820]  here in the 1990s with nothing but $700 in his pocket with his wife and children back
[32:16.820 --> 32:22.860]  in Ireland, because he couldn't make a living there. And now today he owns a very successful
[32:22.860 --> 32:28.540]  business, uh, that let's just say is, is, is a great service to people. Uh, and it's
[32:28.540 --> 32:33.060]  very, very exciting as well. And he just loves life and so free. He said, this is the American
[32:33.060 --> 32:37.500]  dream. He had tears in his eyes talking about how they're trying to destroy that and how
[32:37.500 --> 32:41.940]  the globalists want to sew up the entire economy and destroy it. So the next couple of minutes
[32:41.940 --> 32:48.260]  we have, I guess, four minutes or so, I want to just reach out to everybody watching and
[32:48.260 --> 32:52.580]  let you realize, don't let the enemy get you depressed about what's happening today. As
[32:52.580 --> 32:56.340]  long as you're speaking up, as long as you're standing up, as long as you're saying no to
[32:56.340 --> 33:00.260]  the globalists, as long as you're living and loving your neighbors, being a good person,
[33:00.260 --> 33:05.260]  you're building the human community that is the American dream that is the Renaissance.
[33:05.260 --> 33:10.700]  And this Irishman who's now an American, also got a chance to meet his son who is a partner's
[33:10.700 --> 33:15.820]  William and his company, both the sons, but I met one of the sons that again, do some
[33:15.820 --> 33:21.820]  amazing stuff. I'll leave it at that. He said, listen, you don't get Joe Biden's name right.
[33:21.820 --> 33:27.260]  He's a stooge. And I said, wow, you're right. A stooge is a puppet put in by somebody else
[33:27.260 --> 33:33.460]  who's an idiot, but who's also used to rule over people. So the stooge gets the blame
[33:33.460 --> 33:37.580]  and the actual controllers don't get the blame for the crimes they're committing. He said,
[33:37.580 --> 33:42.260]  that's exactly right. He is a puppet. He is an impostor. He is a fraud. So everybody should
[33:42.260 --> 33:48.500]  look at the different definitions of stooges and understand what that is. That's what he
[33:48.500 --> 33:55.900]  says. You know, the Dune books by Frank Herbert are amazing. The movie by Lynch was powerful,
[33:55.900 --> 34:04.340]  but also cheesy in parts, but it's accurate as a historical fiction reference to some
[34:04.340 --> 34:08.260]  of the things that have actually happened in the real world. And if you notice, Baron
[34:08.260 --> 34:13.820]  Harkinen is supposedly losing control of the planet Arrakis with a spice, which is basically
[34:13.820 --> 34:19.300]  why this is a technology, the ethos of the globalist eternal life. And, but, but really
[34:19.300 --> 34:27.140]  they're just setting up the main rival of the emperor, Duke of Trades. But before, you
[34:27.140 --> 34:31.660]  know, after he set up a trade, he's, his son's thrown out of the desert and all the rest
[34:31.660 --> 34:37.980]  of it, he sends in the beast. We're bond his nephew to squeeze an attack and destroy all
[34:37.980 --> 34:45.820]  his opposition. But then he removes him later, gives him the blame, and puts in Fade Rebonne,
[34:45.820 --> 34:49.940]  who he really wants to be his main heir as the savior. So that they put him under tyranny
[34:49.940 --> 34:55.660]  this high, and then Fade comes in and the tyranny is totally high. And they would have hated
[34:55.660 --> 35:00.460]  Fade, but, but, but because the tyranny was so much higher before, they now accept that
[35:00.460 --> 35:06.700]  new benchmark of tyranny. And that's what you do with a stooge who you put in as a viceroy
[35:06.700 --> 35:11.900]  or a vice king. And the Romans would do this. The British Empire would do this. The French
[35:11.900 --> 35:15.380]  would do this. It's in the history books that they would come in an oppressive group, take
[35:15.380 --> 35:19.580]  them over, put in somebody to be unpopular, to squeeze and be a tyrant. Then their own
[35:19.580 --> 35:25.020]  publications and own heralds would demonize that person, remove them, sometimes chop their
[35:25.020 --> 35:30.300]  head off, and then bring in the new tyrant who would loosen up some of the controls,
[35:30.300 --> 35:37.980]  but not as much as, as, as it was before they invaded. So again, you tighten down, then
[35:37.980 --> 35:43.300]  you loosen up, but not as much as you did before. And that's where a stooge comes in.
[35:43.300 --> 35:48.780]  And that's really what Joe Biden is. Joe Biden is a stooge. Joe Biden is a puppet. We should
[35:48.780 --> 35:53.220]  also call him Joe Biden's stooge. So that said, they're going to, they brought him
[35:53.220 --> 35:56.620]  in. They're going to blame him for all the collapse of the economy, for the, for the
[35:56.620 --> 36:00.420]  open borders, for all the mismanagement. And then whether it's Kamala Harris or whoever
[36:00.420 --> 36:05.380]  next, they will then be set up as the savior. But I think Kamala will be stooge number two.
[36:05.380 --> 36:10.180]  I mean, this is real Imperium, Machiavelli, nasty stuff we're going under, non-American
[36:10.180 --> 36:15.140]  style government. This is really very, very corrupt government. But again, in close, I
[36:15.140 --> 36:20.660]  was going to say this, we can't stay on air and fight this stooge and fight these globalists
[36:20.660 --> 36:25.020]  while the public's mind is more fertile to be awoken than ever without your support.
[36:25.020 --> 36:28.620]  That's why I salute you. And I thank you for your support. And I encourage you to go to
[36:28.620 --> 36:32.820]  infowarstore.com to get a t-shirt, to get a boat, to get a film, but also to get these
[36:32.820 --> 36:36.220]  game changing supplements. They're the highest quality and highest end you're going to find
[36:36.220 --> 36:41.140]  anywhere because that's how we stay on air. And because we're selling out of vitamin mineral
[36:41.140 --> 36:47.740]  fusion way faster than I thought we would, I'm going to keep the sale on at 50% off until
[36:47.740 --> 36:52.580]  next week, but it's months till we get more. It's going to go back to 25% off next Tuesday
[36:52.580 --> 36:57.580]  or so, just because we need the funding to fund ourselves in the 50% off. We've done
[36:57.580 --> 37:01.260]  the math. It's not really the funding we need. If we could keep it coming at 50% off and
[37:01.260 --> 37:04.980]  keep selling it, we would do that, but because we can't get enough of it because of breakdowns
[37:04.980 --> 37:08.380]  of the economy and all the rest of it. And because our quality standards are so high,
[37:08.380 --> 37:12.500]  then I'm going to go ahead and go 25% off starting next week. Still free shipping's
[37:12.500 --> 37:18.300]  four wide. We also have down and out, which is the liquid rocket rest. Huge, high quality
[37:18.300 --> 37:23.860]  doses of things that make you sleep deeply, calmly, restfully. It really is strong. It
[37:23.860 --> 37:27.620]  will have you down and out in a good way. It's the liquid form, basically the same formula
[37:27.620 --> 37:32.300]  as rocket rest that sold out. It's coming in soon, but this is even stronger because
[37:32.300 --> 37:35.980]  the liquid's even stronger. You take it under the tongue. It goes right into the bloodstream.
[37:35.980 --> 37:40.140]  Four milligrams of melatonin and it just L-tripped the van, valerian root. It just goes on from
[37:40.140 --> 37:46.020]  there. That is in stock 50% off. We have the Faraday cages, privacy pouches. Those are
[37:46.020 --> 37:51.260]  back in stock. Those are massively discounted. X2 is selling out very soon, 50% off. And
[37:51.260 --> 37:54.420]  Ultra 12, we've still got a lot of them, but it's going to sell in about a month. Highest
[37:54.420 --> 37:59.780]  quality of that would be 12. That is also 50% off. Impalwarestore.com. And it will end.
[37:59.780 --> 38:04.220]  I extended it one week because I've been on the road so busy. I'm going to do specials.
[38:04.220 --> 38:12.380]  We will have the sale also until this Sunday or so on everything, but the vitamin mineral
[38:12.380 --> 38:16.300]  fusion and then I will extend that out a little bit longer. But the free shipping and all
[38:16.300 --> 38:21.580]  of this has to end this weekend because we're selling out of the product, can't get more.
[38:21.580 --> 38:24.220]  So again, I need to be able to sell it at a higher price to get the funds, just be in
[38:24.220 --> 38:27.500]  point and link with you how this works. So take advantage of that right now. I know you're
[38:27.500 --> 38:29.900]  finding the very tip of the spear. I want to thank you all for your support. Back to
[38:29.900 --> 38:37.100]  Owen Schroer on the live broadcast. Impalwarestore.com or AAA-253-3139. Get the vitamin mineral fusion,
[38:37.100 --> 38:40.260]  boost your immune system, share it with friends and family while you still can. Thank you
[38:40.260 --> 38:43.860]  for your support. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got
[38:43.860 --> 38:49.540]  just a minute or so left here. I want to play again. Guys, let's have the clip seven ready.
[38:49.540 --> 38:57.580]  This is Mao Zed Biden, Chairman Joe, telling you the American people, supposedly a free
[38:57.580 --> 39:03.620]  people that you are not free. But if you take your vaccine, then maybe you can celebrate
[39:03.620 --> 39:09.220]  the 4th of July. I need you. I need every American to do their part.
[39:09.220 --> 39:13.140]  How creepy is this? That's not hyperbole. I need you. I need
[39:13.140 --> 39:17.180]  you to get vaccinated when it's your turn and when you can find an opportunity. When it's
[39:17.180 --> 39:22.020]  your turn, yeah. And to help your family, your friends, your neighbors get vaccinated
[39:22.020 --> 39:30.420]  as well. Because here's the point. If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this
[39:30.420 --> 39:36.860]  together, join the cult by July the 4th, there's a good chance you, your families and friends
[39:36.860 --> 39:40.980]  will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout
[39:40.980 --> 39:46.860]  and a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn't mean large events with lots
[39:46.860 --> 39:51.140]  of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together.
[39:51.140 --> 39:52.140]  Oh, only a small group.
[39:52.140 --> 39:58.380]  After this long, hard year, that will make this Independence Day something truly special.
[39:58.380 --> 40:00.620]  Oh, I'm sure you will.
[40:00.620 --> 40:05.820]  Where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence
[40:05.820 --> 40:07.260]  from this virus.
[40:07.260 --> 40:09.460]  Yes, because that's up to you and Fauci.
[40:09.460 --> 40:11.580]  But to get there, because the virus is in control now.
[40:11.580 --> 40:13.540]  We can't let our guard down.
[40:13.540 --> 40:14.540]  President virus.
[40:14.540 --> 40:18.420]  This fight is far from over. From over. As I told the woman in Pennsylvania, I'll tell
[40:18.420 --> 40:19.420]  you the truth.
[40:19.420 --> 40:20.420]  Oh.
[40:20.420 --> 40:24.540]  But July 4th, with your loved ones, is the goal.
[40:24.540 --> 40:25.540]  Ah.
[40:25.540 --> 40:28.460]  But a goal, a lot can happen.
[40:28.460 --> 40:38.620]  Yeah, this is like the old, this is like the old rodeo or the old bullfighting, Joe Biden
[40:38.620 --> 40:44.380]  waving the red carpet, waving the red towel, waving the red linen.
[40:44.380 --> 40:52.220]  Oh, July 4th, July 4th, the bull comes charging, lifts the veil, stabs you in the back.
[40:52.220 --> 40:53.220]  That's what this is.
[40:53.220 --> 40:54.220]  But oh, Joe, thank you.
[40:54.220 --> 40:55.220]  I can be free on July 4th.
[40:55.220 --> 40:56.220]  Oh, thank you so much.
[40:56.220 --> 40:57.220]  Oh, my God.
[40:57.220 --> 41:01.220]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[41:01.220 --> 41:03.860]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodines?
[41:03.860 --> 41:04.860]  Why do you do that?
[41:04.860 --> 41:07.060]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[41:07.060 --> 41:11.500]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[41:11.500 --> 41:15.540]  earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and
[41:15.540 --> 41:18.660]  the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[41:18.660 --> 41:19.660]  Boom.
[41:19.660 --> 41:20.660]  We did it.
[41:20.660 --> 41:21.660]  It's popular.
[41:21.660 --> 41:22.660]  It's X3.
[41:22.660 --> 41:23.660]  Is it better than X2?
[41:23.660 --> 41:24.660]  You decide.
[41:24.660 --> 41:25.660]  It's different strokes, different folks.
[41:25.660 --> 41:31.220]  It's a supplement to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping, and that is down and
[41:31.220 --> 41:32.220]  out.
[41:32.220 --> 41:36.540]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[41:36.540 --> 41:41.340]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates
[41:41.340 --> 41:43.380]  at m4store.com and free shipping.
[41:43.380 --> 41:46.620]  Secure your down and out today, and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the
[41:46.620 --> 41:47.620]  M4 at the same time.
[41:47.620 --> 41:57.460]  Down and out, exclusively available at m4store.com or 40% off and free shipping.
[41:57.460 --> 42:00.860]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[42:00.860 --> 42:05.140]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that, but
[42:05.140 --> 42:08.300]  let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[42:08.300 --> 42:11.380]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[42:11.380 --> 42:16.540]  can to shut us down, so please pray to keep m4s on the air and please support the local
[42:16.540 --> 42:18.140]  station you're listening to as well.
[42:18.140 --> 42:24.140]  At the same time, go to m4store.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get
[42:24.140 --> 42:29.220]  a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the
[42:29.220 --> 42:30.540]  face of this thing.
[42:30.540 --> 42:32.620]  I need your help more than ever now.
[42:32.620 --> 42:37.380]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us, so
[42:37.380 --> 42:42.340]  pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great
[42:42.340 --> 42:47.700]  products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at m4store.com whether it's
[42:47.700 --> 42:52.980]  high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all
[42:52.980 --> 42:57.140]  of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-god.
[42:57.140 --> 42:59.580]  Thank you so much.
[42:59.580 --> 43:03.460]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[43:03.460 --> 43:08.420]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought
[43:08.420 --> 43:10.100]  down to nothing.
[43:10.100 --> 43:15.380]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team, you're about
[43:15.380 --> 43:18.100]  to find out how pathetic you are.
[43:18.100 --> 43:25.300]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[43:25.300 --> 43:28.100]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[43:28.100 --> 43:30.420]  The enemy can't help itself.
[43:30.420 --> 43:34.500]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[43:34.500 --> 43:40.060]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it, we should, but once
[43:40.060 --> 43:45.620]  it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking
[43:45.620 --> 43:49.940]  us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[43:49.940 --> 43:53.980]  So prepare yourselves America, you're going under judgment just like all the children
[43:53.980 --> 43:55.780]  that were aborted.
[43:55.780 --> 43:59.020]  This is the truth, this is the info war.
[43:59.020 --> 44:02.100]  I actually bought this at Blocks, UHF frequencies.
[44:02.100 --> 44:08.140]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[44:08.140 --> 44:15.180]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without
[44:15.180 --> 44:16.580]  a battery.
[44:16.580 --> 44:22.620]  Now with the info wars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[44:22.620 --> 44:23.620]  Excellent.
[44:23.620 --> 44:34.100]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want and you can too at infowarstore.com.
[44:34.100 --> 44:41.540]  Content agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers, are all tracking your
[44:41.540 --> 44:44.540]  every move through your mobile phone.
[44:44.540 --> 44:49.860]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[44:49.860 --> 45:02.020]  Support the info war and get your info wars privacy pouch today, infowarstore.com.
[45:02.020 --> 45:27.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:27.020 --> 45:51.220]  I need you, I need you.
[45:51.220 --> 45:59.060]  He needs me to be a good little slave, he needs me to take that vaccine, which they
[45:59.060 --> 46:02.820]  say doesn't stop the spread, although now they're saying, oh, it's proven to stop the
[46:02.820 --> 46:08.340]  spread, but they're admitting there's these new variants, these new strains, so they really
[46:08.340 --> 46:11.540]  don't know what is going on.
[46:11.540 --> 46:14.780]  So I've got news coming out of the Biden administration.
[46:14.780 --> 46:20.020]  I want to get to that, but I feel like I should get to the vaccine news here first.
[46:20.020 --> 46:28.260]  Now, so you just heard Joe, just as info wars told you a year ago today, they're never going
[46:28.260 --> 46:33.540]  to lift any of these restrictions until they can force you to take a vaccine.
[46:33.540 --> 46:35.780]  And so that's what Joe Biden just admitted.
[46:35.780 --> 46:44.660]  Now when info wars says that a year ago on these airwaves, nobody wants to blink an eye,
[46:44.660 --> 46:52.140]  but then when Joe Biden says it a year later from the White House, well, maybe now you'll
[46:52.140 --> 46:56.940]  believe, maybe now you'll get it, maybe now you'll understand this is a cult, this is
[46:56.940 --> 47:02.700]  a satanic cult, you must enter it, this is their ritual, they're telling you.
[47:02.700 --> 47:08.140]  And the fact that the average American would even consider going along with this shows
[47:08.140 --> 47:19.980]  how ignorant and brainwashed and just in general domesticated we've become, that we have to
[47:19.980 --> 47:25.740]  have some old, doddering fool who we found the video of him shuffling away.
[47:25.740 --> 47:30.100]  It's an early sign if you're suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's that
[47:30.100 --> 47:33.860]  you just, you shuffle, you look down because you're not sure you can walk without falling
[47:33.860 --> 47:34.860]  down.
[47:34.860 --> 47:39.420]  You see the ground, you need to see your feet shuffling, but you already know about Biden's
[47:39.420 --> 47:43.380]  health, so it's not good about that.
[47:43.380 --> 47:46.420]  They're now telling you if you haven't seen it enough, if you haven't heard it enough,
[47:46.420 --> 47:51.620]  if you haven't seen the freedom passed in Israel and everywhere else, they're telling
[47:51.620 --> 47:56.620]  you, you want to be free again, you consume the big pharmaceutical vaccine that's never
[47:56.620 --> 47:59.380]  been tested, a brand new technology.
[47:59.380 --> 48:07.340]  Yeah, there's the mentally decrepit, mentally decrepit shuffle of Joe Biden.
[48:07.340 --> 48:12.300]  How many drugs did they pump him up with last night so he could deliver that speech, whether
[48:12.300 --> 48:16.060]  it was live or not, it doesn't matter.
[48:16.060 --> 48:17.700]  And then he had to walk 30 feet.
[48:17.700 --> 48:22.380]  Let me tell you, he might not even get out of bed today with whatever cocktail of medicine
[48:22.380 --> 48:23.380]  they put him.
[48:23.380 --> 48:27.020]  He only knocked out for the next 48 hours.
[48:27.020 --> 48:32.740]  But so imagine, hey, you live in a free country, you live in a republic, independence, right?
[48:32.740 --> 48:40.500]  Independence Day, we declared our independence as individuals, as Americans, from a tyrannical
[48:40.500 --> 48:44.740]  government, from any sort of overwhelming government.
[48:44.740 --> 48:46.500]  We have freedoms here.
[48:46.500 --> 48:56.060]  Oh, but as of today, as of March 11th, 2021, Joe Biden says, nope, you're not in a free
[48:56.060 --> 48:57.060]  country.
[48:57.060 --> 48:59.060]  Nope, you're not a free citizen.
[48:59.060 --> 49:03.940]  But maybe you can be if you take the vaccine like a good slave.
[49:03.940 --> 49:07.020]  So you want to be a free slave?
[49:07.020 --> 49:10.740]  Take that vaccine.
[49:10.740 --> 49:14.860]  But just like Kanye West said, it's never been more prevalent.
[49:14.860 --> 49:16.180]  Slavery was a choice.
[49:16.180 --> 49:19.340]  Slavery is a choice.
[49:19.340 --> 49:21.900]  May have actually been the more accurate statement.
[49:21.900 --> 49:26.980]  Not slavery was a choice in the context of his conversation, it made sense, but the more
[49:26.980 --> 49:29.740]  accurate statement is slavery is a choice.
[49:29.740 --> 49:32.020]  Now I get it.
[49:32.020 --> 49:34.980]  We know what those choices could entail.
[49:34.980 --> 49:38.700]  The Democrat Party already has their political dissidents rounded up and put in jail, put
[49:38.700 --> 49:41.820]  in camps, physically actually doing that.
[49:41.820 --> 49:44.500]  They're also censoring their political dissidents.
[49:44.500 --> 49:49.780]  So this is the New World Order cult.
[49:49.780 --> 49:51.300]  This is the end of independence.
[49:51.300 --> 49:56.860]  This is the end of American citizen sovereignty.
[49:56.860 --> 50:05.540]  And as of March 11, 2021, Joe Biden just announced that to the world, kind of a big deal.
[50:05.540 --> 50:09.340]  So you don't get a border and you're not free until you take a vaccine.
[50:09.340 --> 50:10.340]  Think about that.
[50:10.340 --> 50:15.020]  Oh, and by the way, we just signed a $2 trillion stimulus bill that's going to put you in further
[50:15.020 --> 50:21.740]  into debt and you won't even see a dime from it, and so I've got all that coming on.
[50:21.740 --> 50:23.300]  But let's look at what's happening with the vaccines.
[50:23.300 --> 50:30.900]  Now, remember, they have said, and there's, well, there have been new developments on
[50:30.900 --> 50:38.020]  this, but it's not a specific one where they say, if you're going to have a mammogram,
[50:38.020 --> 50:41.660]  have it before you get the COVID vaccine or wait a year after you get it because you're
[50:41.660 --> 50:46.540]  going to have a false positive for cancer from your COVID vaccine.
[50:46.540 --> 50:50.420]  And so that was the beginning of it.
[50:50.420 --> 50:53.060]  And they wouldn't even tell you that that's what was going on.
[50:53.060 --> 50:55.900]  But if you read into it and you read between the lines, you understand that's what's going
[50:55.900 --> 50:56.900]  on.
[50:56.900 --> 50:57.900]  So we reported on that.
[50:57.900 --> 51:03.580]  Now it's mainstream news, false positives for cancer after the COVID vaccine.
[51:03.580 --> 51:06.020]  Do you think those are actually false though?
[51:06.020 --> 51:07.340]  Well, we don't know.
[51:07.340 --> 51:16.620]  They just say it's false, and now Norway is investigating whether AstraZeneca vaccine
[51:16.620 --> 51:20.380]  caused deadly blood clots.
[51:20.380 --> 51:25.420]  And so because of that, they've decided to hold some of these vaccines back.
[51:25.420 --> 51:27.620]  But don't worry, they'll release them again.
[51:27.620 --> 51:31.540]  They just need some time to make you think that they're investigating what's going on
[51:31.540 --> 51:35.580]  with all these negative side effects.
[51:35.580 --> 51:39.100]  Love of French nursing home workers reluctant to receive COVID vaccine.
[51:39.100 --> 51:43.180]  I think reluctant is a kind way of putting it.
[51:43.180 --> 51:47.340]  I have friends in France and Paris.
[51:47.340 --> 51:55.900]  And while they have their problems over there, they are really into health, natural health,
[51:55.900 --> 52:00.060]  organic health, and they don't want this vaccine.
[52:00.060 --> 52:02.220]  This is very unpopular in France.
[52:02.220 --> 52:05.260]  And even the lockdown is reaching a point of extreme unpopularity in France.
[52:05.260 --> 52:08.460]  It's not really being reported anywhere.
[52:08.460 --> 52:13.940]  You're not seeing yellow vest protests like we saw in the past.
[52:13.940 --> 52:16.260]  But what are they going to do when people don't want to take the vaccine?
[52:16.260 --> 52:20.020]  See, these people don't want to admit their tyrants.
[52:20.020 --> 52:22.020]  These people don't want to admit their totalitarians.
[52:22.020 --> 52:26.180]  But see, the execution of their policy proves it.
[52:26.180 --> 52:32.460]  So like in Texas, they say, no, the liberal groups here funded by who knows who, that
[52:32.460 --> 52:33.580]  go out and have these protests.
[52:33.580 --> 52:37.500]  They say you can't open Texas 100% till 70% of the people are vaccinated.
[52:37.500 --> 52:40.780]  Well, what if only 50% of the people want to get vaccinated?
[52:40.780 --> 52:41.780]  So then what do you do?
[52:41.780 --> 52:42.940]  Well, I guess you have to force them, don't you?
[52:42.940 --> 52:44.180]  Oh, so you are a tyrant.
[52:44.180 --> 52:47.420]  You are an authoritarian, just like Joe Biden.
[52:47.420 --> 52:51.460]  You are not celebrating Independence Day until we all take our vaccines.
[52:51.460 --> 52:52.940]  He needs you to.
[52:52.940 --> 52:54.700]  Why do you need me to do anything, Joe?
[52:54.700 --> 52:59.380]  I need you to do a few things.
[52:59.380 --> 53:02.940]  Italy imposes national lockdown as mutant COVID strains spread.
[53:02.940 --> 53:09.260]  So tell me, with all these mutant strains, how the vaccine is going to work?
[53:09.260 --> 53:11.020]  Well, it's not.
[53:11.020 --> 53:13.980]  That's the big joke.
[53:13.980 --> 53:15.620]  That's the big pharmaceutical ploy.
[53:15.620 --> 53:19.340]  Oh, there's going to be strains and mutant strains, just like the flu shot.
[53:19.340 --> 53:22.540]  They have to do a new flu shot every year because the new strain, I guess the flu is
[53:22.540 --> 53:23.540]  dead now.
[53:23.540 --> 53:24.540]  It's all COVID.
[53:24.540 --> 53:27.580]  So they've rebranded the flu to COVID so they could sell you vaccines and make trillions
[53:27.580 --> 53:30.940]  of dollars.
[53:30.940 --> 53:36.860]  So how is the vaccine you made for the strain when you started making these vaccines six
[53:36.860 --> 53:38.540]  months ago or eight months ago?
[53:38.540 --> 53:40.460]  How is that going to work against the new strain?
[53:40.460 --> 53:41.460]  Well, it's not.
[53:41.460 --> 53:43.900]  They'll have a new vaccine that they'll force you to take, and then maybe you can have a
[53:43.900 --> 53:44.900]  barbecue.
[53:44.900 --> 53:45.900]  Oh, there's a new strain.
[53:45.900 --> 53:49.340]  Sorry, no barbecue, no school, no church, but don't worry, we'll get another vaccine.
[53:49.340 --> 53:52.820]  And then you'll just keep paying and paying and paying and paying.
[53:52.820 --> 53:56.780]  And big pharmaceutical vaccine manufacturers will make trillions.
[53:56.780 --> 54:01.260]  And all the people on the inside are trading, holding their stock, will make billions.
[54:01.260 --> 54:07.260]  And Fauci and Gates and the Democrats will just laugh all the way to the bank.
[54:07.260 --> 54:11.660]  Europe's COVID vaccine rollout faces even more delays, again, because there's all these
[54:11.660 --> 54:12.660]  new strains.
[54:12.660 --> 54:16.780]  So you could never come out of lockdown because the virus is never going to stop mutating.
[54:16.780 --> 54:19.300]  Apparently, who believes any of it anyway?
[54:19.300 --> 54:23.380]  They've never even isolated the virus.
[54:23.380 --> 54:28.100]  Want more proof that Trump supporters are smarter than the Trump haters?
[54:28.100 --> 54:34.980]  According to the latest poll, half of Trump supporters will not take the COVID vaccine.
[54:34.980 --> 54:37.460]  This is a NPR PBS Marist poll.
[54:37.460 --> 54:42.020]  So half of Trump supporters won't take the vaccine, but 78% of Democrats believe the
[54:42.020 --> 54:43.620]  lockdowns must stay in place.
[54:43.620 --> 54:48.380]  So again, Democrats love their slavery to the big government, don't they?
[54:48.380 --> 54:51.420]  Oh, the Democrats are all about the little guy.
[54:51.420 --> 54:53.580]  They're all anti-establishment.
[54:53.580 --> 54:54.580]  They want the small government.
[54:54.580 --> 54:57.700]  They want the government out of our lives, lie.
[54:57.700 --> 55:01.340]  The Democrat Party is now the party of totalitarianism.
[55:01.340 --> 55:03.620]  The Democrat Party is now the party of big government.
[55:03.620 --> 55:06.460]  The Democrat Party is the party of censoring free speech.
[55:06.460 --> 55:14.260]  The Democrat Party is the party of communist-style takeovers of free nations, like the United
[55:14.260 --> 55:16.700]  States of America.
[55:16.700 --> 55:22.140]  And yes, as you saw, they are using past presidents to push the experimental vaccines
[55:22.140 --> 55:23.140]  on the public.
[55:23.140 --> 55:25.140]  And Michelle Obama encourages people to do it.
[55:25.140 --> 55:26.140]  George Bush.
[55:26.140 --> 55:28.540]  They all wear the masks, too.
[55:28.540 --> 55:33.820]  And they say now there's a story in this Stanford advocate wearing masks is liberating.
[55:33.820 --> 55:35.540]  And I learned this now.
[55:35.540 --> 55:37.340]  It's liberating because people are ugly.
[55:37.340 --> 55:38.820]  They literally say that.
[55:38.820 --> 55:42.860]  So now ugly people are going to be ruling the world and make you not show your face
[55:42.860 --> 55:44.240]  because you're good looking.
[55:44.240 --> 55:45.240]  This is the left.
[55:45.240 --> 55:47.460]  This is the Democrat Party.
[55:47.460 --> 55:51.940]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M4 Wars, and we brought you a new supplement,
[55:51.940 --> 55:55.500]  a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[55:55.500 --> 55:56.580]  It is down and out.
[55:56.580 --> 55:58.380]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[55:58.380 --> 56:01.380]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[56:01.380 --> 56:04.460]  It's got four milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[56:04.460 --> 56:06.980]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[56:06.980 --> 56:10.660]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[56:10.660 --> 56:15.660]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[56:15.660 --> 56:18.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[56:18.140 --> 56:21.340]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[56:21.340 --> 56:23.340]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[56:23.340 --> 56:27.460]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off the sleep?
[56:27.460 --> 56:28.460]  It's incredible.
[56:28.460 --> 56:30.660]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[56:30.660 --> 56:33.220]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[56:48.740 --> 56:57.740]  In the early 1990s, it was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[56:57.740 --> 57:01.980]  Even before I had an access to this show in the mid-1990s, I wouldn't call that movie
[57:01.980 --> 57:03.460]  and thought, man, that was fun.
[57:03.460 --> 57:08.100]  In fact, you speak out, have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining
[57:08.100 --> 57:09.100]  because you're real.
[57:09.100 --> 57:11.100]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[57:11.100 --> 57:12.100]  We're not worthy.
[57:12.100 --> 57:13.100]  We're not worthy.
[57:13.100 --> 57:14.100]  We're not worthy.
[57:14.100 --> 57:19.100]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you, because
[57:19.100 --> 57:21.020]  these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[57:21.020 --> 57:22.260]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[57:22.260 --> 57:24.420]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[57:24.420 --> 57:26.060]  The globalists love lying to you.
[57:26.060 --> 57:27.420]  They love manipulating you.
[57:27.420 --> 57:30.060]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[57:30.060 --> 57:34.820]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[57:34.820 --> 57:37.540]  That for me is really set to end discussion.
[57:37.540 --> 57:43.460]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we will never join
[57:43.460 --> 57:44.460]  the globalists.
[57:44.460 --> 57:51.540]  We will never knowingly manipulate you, because we know we're all in this together.
[57:51.540 --> 58:17.540]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:17.540 --> 58:23.980]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[58:23.980 --> 58:25.300]  We're in the second hour.
[58:25.300 --> 58:29.220]  Before I get into this other news coming out of the Biden camp, I want to show you what's
[58:29.220 --> 58:34.740]  been going on in Portland, Oregon, completely ignored by the mainstream media and the Democrat
[58:34.740 --> 58:35.740]  Party.
[58:35.740 --> 58:36.740]  How convenient for them.
[58:36.740 --> 58:43.780]  First, let's go to clip 9, where in the beginning hours of the evening last night, Portland
[58:43.780 --> 58:45.540]  Antifa showed up at a federal courthouse.
[58:45.540 --> 58:48.220]  This is the beginning of the evening, we'll show you the developments with more video.
[58:48.220 --> 58:53.460]  But let's take a look at what the left wing was doing in Portland, Oregon last night in
[58:53.460 --> 58:54.460]  clip 9.
[58:54.460 --> 59:24.260]  It's outside a federal courthouse in Portland.
[59:24.260 --> 59:25.260]  I don't understand.
[59:25.260 --> 59:35.100]  They're not scared because the Democrats have told them we're going to let you be
[59:35.100 --> 59:38.100]  I will not hold.
[59:38.100 --> 59:43.100]  Why are these people behaving like they don't want to be here?
[59:43.100 --> 59:45.100]  Do it! Do it!
[59:48.100 --> 59:53.100]  I'll give the left wing credit. They're violent revolutionaries.
[59:53.100 --> 59:56.100]  They're violent revolutionaries, prosecutors are not.
[59:56.100 --> 59:59.100]  Here they are spraying who knows what that is inside the building.
[59:59.100 --> 1:00:01.100]  That's a felony.
[1:00:01.100 --> 1:00:04.100]  Destruction of federal property, no arrest made.
[1:00:04.100 --> 1:00:07.100]  So that's at the beginning of the night.
[1:00:07.100 --> 1:00:10.100]  So this is how they're behaving at the beginning of the night while the sun is still out.
[1:00:10.100 --> 1:00:12.100]  This is just them getting warmed up.
[1:00:12.100 --> 1:00:15.100]  And look at how law enforcement does nothing.
[1:00:15.100 --> 1:00:18.100]  How are these individuals not arrested?
[1:00:18.100 --> 1:00:21.100]  That's incredible.
[1:00:21.100 --> 1:00:24.100]  Well, it didn't stop there.
[1:00:24.100 --> 1:00:29.100]  They came back later in the evening to the same federal courthouse and tried to burn it to the ground
[1:00:29.100 --> 1:00:35.100]  while people were still inside. Check out clip 10.
[1:00:35.100 --> 1:00:42.100]  So the Antifa lights a fire on the courthouse there that you just saw them at.
[1:00:42.100 --> 1:00:45.100]  And now they've lit the building on fire.
[1:00:45.100 --> 1:00:48.100]  This is a mostly peaceful protest, by the way.
[1:00:48.100 --> 1:00:52.100]  And arrests are not being made, folks.
[1:00:52.100 --> 1:00:58.100]  And the reason is because if they get arrested, the charges get dropped and they get released from jail immediately.
[1:00:58.100 --> 1:01:03.100]  I'm going to have a guest on that, a lawyer who's dealing with this directly on the war room next week.
[1:01:03.100 --> 1:01:05.100]  We've got him scheduled.
[1:01:05.100 --> 1:01:10.100]  I won't say too much right now, but let's just say we've got some inside information on what's going on there.
[1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:14.100]  So the reason why Antifa is out of control in Portland because they know they won't get arrested
[1:01:14.100 --> 1:01:17.100]  and they know even if they do, their charges will be dropped.
[1:01:17.100 --> 1:01:23.100]  So here's after the Portland Antifa tried to burn a building down with federal officers inside.
[1:01:23.100 --> 1:01:27.100]  Here's what it looked like on the streets afterward in clip 12.
[1:01:27.100 --> 1:01:33.100]  So where's the war zone again?
[1:01:33.100 --> 1:01:37.100]  It's not in D.C., folks. There's no activity in D.C.
[1:01:37.100 --> 1:01:40.100]  This is in Portland, Oregon last night.
[1:01:40.100 --> 1:01:48.100]  So radical left-wing terrorists and Democrat party surrogates,
[1:01:48.100 --> 1:01:54.100]  riding every night in Portland trying to burn buildings to the ground and the mainstream media doesn't cover it.
[1:01:54.100 --> 1:01:58.100]  The mainstream media doesn't mention it. The Democrat party has no problem with it.
[1:01:58.100 --> 1:02:01.100]  They refuse to send law enforcement. They don't build walls.
[1:02:01.100 --> 1:02:06.100]  They don't put up barriers. They don't put up barbed wire fences.
[1:02:06.100 --> 1:02:08.100]  They're not allowed to make arrests.
[1:02:08.100 --> 1:02:14.100]  But if you step foot sideways in Washington, D.C., the entire National Guard will come down on you
[1:02:14.100 --> 1:02:16.100]  because that's what Nancy Pelosi wants.
[1:02:16.100 --> 1:02:21.100]  She actually wanted them to shoot you down with a machine gun turret on every corner, but they didn't get that.
[1:02:21.100 --> 1:02:25.100]  They may yet, though. They may yet, though.
[1:02:25.100 --> 1:02:32.100]  And so while all this is going on, the National Guard is saying we should not be in D.C.
[1:02:32.100 --> 1:02:36.100]  We're not needed here. We're costing the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.
[1:02:36.100 --> 1:02:40.100]  Please relieve us of this duty in D.C. Let's take down these walls. There's no threat here.
[1:02:40.100 --> 1:02:43.100]  And the Democrats say, no, you have to stay here.
[1:02:43.100 --> 1:02:47.100]  And then the new Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, says you're going to be staying here till at least May
[1:02:47.100 --> 1:02:51.100]  with thousands of troops on guard, 24-7, and the fences stay up.
[1:02:51.100 --> 1:02:55.100]  But they ignore the Democrat violence in Portland. How convenient.
[1:02:55.100 --> 1:02:59.100]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[1:02:59.100 --> 1:03:03.100]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[1:03:03.100 --> 1:03:05.100]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[1:03:05.100 --> 1:03:08.100]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[1:03:08.100 --> 1:03:12.100]  That's what Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:03:12.100 --> 1:03:17.100]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems
[1:03:17.100 --> 1:03:21.100]  that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[1:03:21.100 --> 1:03:24.100]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals,
[1:03:24.100 --> 1:03:27.100]  because it's so simple, because you won't be under their control anymore.
[1:03:27.100 --> 1:03:32.100]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out there
[1:03:32.100 --> 1:03:36.100]  in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at InfowarsTour.com.
[1:03:36.100 --> 1:03:38.100]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[1:03:38.100 --> 1:03:44.100]  It funds the Infowar at the same time. No other product you can buy does that.
[1:03:44.100 --> 1:03:49.100]  So again, InfowarsTour.com, it's back in stock, 50% off vitamin mineral fusion.
[1:03:49.100 --> 1:03:51.100]  I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[1:03:51.100 --> 1:03:55.100]  So take action today and give it to your friends and family as a gift.
[1:03:55.100 --> 1:04:14.100]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:19.100]  Don't expect the Democrat tyranny to end anytime soon.
[1:04:19.100 --> 1:04:24.100]  Don't expect the Democrat terrorism to end anytime soon.
[1:04:24.100 --> 1:04:27.100]  They are fully endorsing both of these activities,
[1:04:27.100 --> 1:04:33.100]  whether it's big pharmaceutical tyranny or just telling you you can't go to church or school or open your business.
[1:04:33.100 --> 1:04:39.100]  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands a month are pouring in over the southern border and being put in small facilities,
[1:04:39.100 --> 1:04:44.100]  elbow to elbow, back to back, and testing positive for COVID.
[1:04:44.100 --> 1:04:50.100]  By the way, it was just those that volunteer, just out of those that volunteer for COVID,
[1:04:50.100 --> 1:04:54.100]  about 5% were testing positive.
[1:04:54.100 --> 1:04:56.100]  So that's the math of the overall number.
[1:04:56.100 --> 1:04:58.100]  So I'm sorry, I'm not even saying that right.
[1:04:58.100 --> 1:05:03.100]  It's not even 5% of the overall number, or it is 5% of the overall number,
[1:05:03.100 --> 1:05:08.100]  but it's not even, we don't know what the actual percentage is because they just volunteer to get tested for COVID.
[1:05:08.100 --> 1:05:09.100]  So not everybody's getting tested for COVID.
[1:05:09.100 --> 1:05:15.100]  Now again, you can test everybody in the nation for COVID or the flu or herpes or God knows what else.
[1:05:15.100 --> 1:05:19.100]  And 50%, 60%, 70% of the nation may have it.
[1:05:19.100 --> 1:05:21.100]  It doesn't matter we stop being free.
[1:05:21.100 --> 1:05:23.100]  It doesn't matter we lock ourselves down.
[1:05:23.100 --> 1:05:26.100]  Humans have been here for thousands, millions.
[1:05:26.100 --> 1:05:30.100]  Who knows how many years, but now a virus controls us.
[1:05:30.100 --> 1:05:32.100]  See, no, the media is the virus.
[1:05:32.100 --> 1:05:34.100]  The politicians are the virus.
[1:05:34.100 --> 1:05:35.100]  Anthony Fauci is the virus.
[1:05:35.100 --> 1:05:37.100]  Bill Gates is the virus.
[1:05:37.100 --> 1:05:47.100]  That's why they want to say that you're the virus or that you have a virus because they know they are the virus.
[1:05:47.100 --> 1:05:54.100]  So it shows how everything that they tell us is a lie.
[1:05:54.100 --> 1:05:56.100]  Everything they tell us is a lie.
[1:05:56.100 --> 1:05:59.100]  And what's even sadder, we expect them to lie.
[1:05:59.100 --> 1:06:05.100]  But what's even more depressing is that Americans fall for the big lie,
[1:06:05.100 --> 1:06:13.100]  but then are willing to give up all of their freedoms because of the big lie.
[1:06:13.100 --> 1:06:17.100]  That's what really hurts.
[1:06:17.100 --> 1:06:22.100]  That's what's going to hurt.
[1:06:22.100 --> 1:06:24.100]  So it just goes to show you.
[1:06:24.100 --> 1:06:26.100]  So you don't get a wall at the southern border.
[1:06:26.100 --> 1:06:30.100]  You don't get National Guard in Portland where there's real crises happening.
[1:06:30.100 --> 1:06:33.100]  It gets ignored by the media, ignored by the politicians,
[1:06:33.100 --> 1:06:37.100]  but they're going to make sure that wall in DC is never coming down.
[1:06:37.100 --> 1:06:41.100]  Even though I did see a video of them taking the barbed wire off the fence.
[1:06:41.100 --> 1:06:43.100]  So that's nice.
[1:06:43.100 --> 1:06:47.100]  They didn't want to look like a total third world hellhole yet.
[1:06:47.100 --> 1:06:51.100]  The dystopic look of the barbed wire fence, I guess, was a little too much for Nancy Pelosi,
[1:06:51.100 --> 1:06:54.100]  even though she wanted the machine gun turrets on every corner.
[1:06:54.100 --> 1:06:58.100]  And if Lloyd Austin would have been the Secretary of Defense at the time,
[1:06:58.100 --> 1:07:01.100]  and Mal Biden would have been in the White House at the time,
[1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:05.100]  maybe they would have gotten it.
[1:07:05.100 --> 1:07:10.100]  But the White House says there's no crisis at the border as you have hundreds of thousands pouring in a month.
[1:07:10.100 --> 1:07:18.100]  Costing us hundreds of millions of dollars filling our prison systems,
[1:07:18.100 --> 1:07:27.100]  filling these facilities, overwhelming border patrol, bringing in drugs, sex trafficking, human trafficking.
[1:07:27.100 --> 1:07:30.100]  And again, that's not a story, though. That's not even happening, they say.
[1:07:30.100 --> 1:07:35.100]  Because if they admit it's happening, it shows how much of a fraud every one of their policies is,
[1:07:35.100 --> 1:07:38.100]  specifically when it comes to COVID.
[1:07:38.100 --> 1:07:42.100]  When they're entering the country with COVID and then being released into the general population.
[1:07:42.100 --> 1:07:44.100]  In fact, I think it was Brownsville. Guys, look it up.
[1:07:44.100 --> 1:07:50.100]  So once again, hundreds, thousands of illegals pour in. They don't have room at the facilities.
[1:07:50.100 --> 1:07:56.100]  So you, you, the American taxpayer, pay for them to get on Greyhound buses,
[1:07:56.100 --> 1:08:00.100]  or pay for them to get on flights to be redistributed.
[1:08:00.100 --> 1:08:07.100]  They're redistributing your wealth. They're redistributing the human population of Earth all into America.
[1:08:07.100 --> 1:08:14.100]  And so Brownsville is like, well, wait a second. This is ridiculous.
[1:08:14.100 --> 1:08:19.100]  You're dropping off all of these illegal migrants here, busloads of them,
[1:08:19.100 --> 1:08:21.100]  and they're not even being tested for COVID.
[1:08:21.100 --> 1:08:23.100]  So then they're saying, hey, we'd like to test you for COVID.
[1:08:23.100 --> 1:08:26.100]  About half the people volunteer turns out hundreds test positive.
[1:08:26.100 --> 1:08:29.100]  And then what happens? They get released into the population.
[1:08:29.100 --> 1:08:34.100]  Now again, I don't care. I don't care about COVID. It's the flu. It's the cold.
[1:08:34.100 --> 1:08:45.100]  It's been rebranded so they could sell you a vaccine. It's been hopped up in a lab to see how quickly they could spread a virus in a bio weapons test.
[1:08:45.100 --> 1:08:49.100]  So it's not even about the COVID, but it is about the COVID because it shows their fraud.
[1:08:49.100 --> 1:08:55.100]  So you can't be free because of COVID, but they can have a wide open border policy
[1:08:55.100 --> 1:08:59.100]  and ignore all the COVID positive people coming in, even though it's the deadliest thing.
[1:08:59.100 --> 1:09:05.100]  It's the biggest thing ever. You have to be a slave because of COVID.
[1:09:05.100 --> 1:09:10.100]  Oh, and they're also putting kids in cages.
[1:09:10.100 --> 1:09:15.100]  And at this rate, it's already reached this, but I mean, how many months in a row does that have to happen?
[1:09:15.100 --> 1:09:20.100]  100,000 on record. This is just on record.
[1:09:20.100 --> 1:09:26.100]  Oh, and by the way, there's portions. So Trump building the wall.
[1:09:26.100 --> 1:09:32.100]  There's portions of the wall that have like 20 foot gaps that were still in process of construction.
[1:09:32.100 --> 1:09:41.100]  There's like three or four portions that were like two, three days away from completion in major areas where there's where there's people coming across the border.
[1:09:41.100 --> 1:09:46.100]  Like 20 foot gaps, Biden got in office and canceled the construction.
[1:09:46.100 --> 1:09:49.100]  What the hell is that two or three more days?
[1:09:49.100 --> 1:10:05.100]  The contracts have already been written and he stops construction of the walls so there can be 20 to 30 foot gaps in all these different places where there's heavy immigration, illegal immigration happening.
[1:10:05.100 --> 1:10:10.100]  And then news crews go down there because they hear about it. They're like, hey, we heard there's these gaps in the wall.
[1:10:10.100 --> 1:10:16.100]  Biden shut down the construction two or three days. It would have been finished. They would have closed those gaps and they get down there.
[1:10:16.100 --> 1:10:20.100]  They don't even have time to set up their cameras so they have to pull out a phone.
[1:10:20.100 --> 1:10:29.100]  They don't even have time to set up their cameras because as soon as they get on the ground, there's already illegal immigrants crossing in and they don't even have time to set up a camera.
[1:10:29.100 --> 1:10:33.100]  They just have to whip out their phone to record it.
[1:10:33.100 --> 1:10:35.100]  This is Biden's policy.
[1:10:35.100 --> 1:10:37.100]  Biden's policy spreads COVID.
[1:10:37.100 --> 1:10:39.100]  Biden's policy has a wide open border.
[1:10:39.100 --> 1:10:47.100]  And then when Jen Psaki has asked about it, she just laughs in Peter Ducey's face.
[1:10:47.100 --> 1:10:53.100]  And you know, I would be in defense of Jen Psaki because they're obviously not telling her anything.
[1:10:53.100 --> 1:10:56.100]  But you know, she could be honest about that and said she wants to be a pompous bitch.
[1:10:56.100 --> 1:10:58.100]  So screw her.
[1:10:58.100 --> 1:11:02.100]  Little sock puppet of the Biden administration.
[1:11:02.100 --> 1:11:07.100]  Yeah, there's just thousands. This is just one part.
[1:11:07.100 --> 1:11:13.100]  Where a coyote is floating them across the river.
[1:11:13.100 --> 1:11:15.100]  Hey, at least he puts a life vest on him.
[1:11:15.100 --> 1:11:18.100]  Cares more about him than the Biden administration, I guess.
[1:11:18.100 --> 1:11:26.100]  And then they get here and then they come in and Border Patrol can do nothing about it because the Biden administration administration policy is let them go.
[1:11:26.100 --> 1:11:30.100]  Let them in. Let them free.
[1:11:30.100 --> 1:11:36.100]  So COVID pandemic for you, but not for the COVID pandemic for you.
[1:11:36.100 --> 1:11:39.100]  But they can pour into this country with COVID.
[1:11:39.100 --> 1:11:41.100]  We're doing everything to stop this virus.
[1:11:41.100 --> 1:11:43.100]  We need to get this virus under control.
[1:11:43.100 --> 1:11:48.100]  Then we can go back to normal as they let the virus spread intentionally.
[1:11:48.100 --> 1:11:53.100]  I've said it once. I'm going to say it till I'm blue in the face. No pun intended.
[1:11:53.100 --> 1:12:03.100]  A Democrat politician or a liberal Democrat on television is the biggest liar in world history.
[1:12:03.100 --> 1:12:06.100]  There is not a lie too big. There is not a lie.
[1:12:06.100 --> 1:12:17.100]  These people won't tell even when they're caught in their lie, even when they're caught in their fraud, even when they're caught in their double standards and their hypocrisy, they never stop.
[1:12:17.100 --> 1:12:20.100]  These are committed liars.
[1:12:20.100 --> 1:12:27.100]  If the American people had the same commitment to fighting for freedom that the Democrats have to lying, we could actually save this country.
[1:12:27.100 --> 1:12:33.100]  Now, I'm going to get into the latest coming out of the Biden administration with some of these individuals. You're not even going to believe it.
[1:12:33.100 --> 1:12:40.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, remember, Infowars leading the fight for truth and the awakening and renaissance here in the United States of America.
[1:12:40.100 --> 1:12:45.100]  The most banned network in the world, but we are still on air every day, 10 hours a day.

[1:12:51.100 --> 1:12:53.100]  Finally shut the doors here. Believe me, they want to.
[1:12:53.100 --> 1:12:57.100]  Do not look back and say, man, I wish I would have supported Infowars while I could.
[1:12:57.100 --> 1:13:05.100]  I wish I would have gotten the air filters while they were available, the water filters while they were available, the emergency food while it was available before it's too late.
[1:13:05.100 --> 1:13:09.100]  We have one day left right now on free shipping store wide.

[1:13:35.100 --> 1:13:40.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always appreciate your prayers, but hop on over to InfowarsStore.com.
[1:13:40.100 --> 1:13:42.100]  Yeah, we've got George Washington socks.

[1:14:41.100 --> 1:14:49.100]  So don't worship the globalist. Don't worship the NFL. Don't worship all the things in the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God.
[1:14:49.100 --> 1:14:55.100]  And appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[1:14:55.100 --> 1:15:02.100]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins? Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[1:15:02.100 --> 1:15:06.100]  Why do you do that? Because different strokes for different folks.
[1:15:06.100 --> 1:15:17.100]  So we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[1:15:17.100 --> 1:15:23.100]  Boom, we did it. It's popular. It's X3. Is it better than X2? You decide. It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:15:23.100 --> 1:15:30.100]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleep aid, and that is down and out.
[1:15:30.100 --> 1:15:42.100]  It's super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other. Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates at mforestore.com and free shipping.

[1:16:21.100 --> 1:16:46.100]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I want to get into what's going on inside the Biden administration and what they're doing to you, the American taxpayer, what you're paying for.
[1:16:46.100 --> 1:16:56.100]  Oh, yeah. Don't worry. That COVID stimulus bill is ripping you off in ways that, I mean, they have to be laughing.
[1:16:56.100 --> 1:17:10.100]  The politicians have to be laughing that they just pulled this. This may be the biggest steal in world history. This may be the biggest theft in the history of humanity.
[1:17:10.100 --> 1:17:18.100]  What Congress just pulled off, a $2 trillion stimulus bill, and we'll get into some of the lies of that, but where your money will really be going.
[1:17:18.100 --> 1:17:35.100]  But first, Biden executive order forces taxpayers to cover cost of military transgender surgeries. There you go. Don't you feel good? You're no longer a bigot because of the executive order on enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform act.
[1:17:35.100 --> 1:17:43.100]  Don't you know that doesn't it feel good not to be a bigot? You're finally paying for people to have their balls chopped off and join the military.
[1:17:43.100 --> 1:17:53.100]  You must feel good about yourself. Pat yourself on the back, American. You are no longer a bigot. You're paying for transgender surgeries of the military.
[1:17:53.100 --> 1:18:02.100]  And they also say they want pregnant women on the front lines. Way to go, boys. Way to go. Of course, that's insane.
[1:18:02.100 --> 1:18:09.100]  They say, oh, pregnant women are going to be on the front lines of the military. Pregnant women are going to be blasting off into space. Is that a joke? Is that a joke?
[1:18:09.100 --> 1:18:21.100]  In fact, I would be willing to bet. I don't know this. I don't know if anybody, could a baby, could a pregnant woman that's pregnant with a baby inside her, could that baby even survive being blasted off into space?
[1:18:21.100 --> 1:18:32.100]  It was like hundreds of G's of force. The baby would be dead. But they're going to build spacesuits for pregnant women to go into space, would try to kill their baby.
[1:18:32.100 --> 1:18:39.100]  They're going to have a little, little pouch under it too for when the baby falls out dead. Good God.
[1:18:39.100 --> 1:18:49.100]  But I feel proud as an American today. I'm paying for transgender surgeries. Thank God I'm not a bigot anymore.
[1:18:49.100 --> 1:18:59.100]  You know, I was wondering why, and I get it now. I get why Trump did it now. I still don't support it. But I was wondering why is Trump promoting himself as the person who got the vaccines?
[1:18:59.100 --> 1:19:07.100]  The vaccines are deadly. His supporters don't like the vaccines. They never did. We don't want the vaccine. Why is he touting this? Why is he promoting it?
[1:19:07.100 --> 1:19:19.100]  And I get it now. It's kind of an ego thing, but it's more of a just rubbing it in the liberals' faces. And it hit me as I'm seeing the liberals worship the vaccine.
[1:19:19.100 --> 1:19:26.100]  Now, whether they actually believe in the vaccine that much, or it's all just a political statement, I'm not totally sure. Maybe it's a mixture of both.
[1:19:26.100 --> 1:19:38.100]  But the Libs love the vaccine. I mean, they're promoting it. They're saying it saved me. I can finally see my grandma. I can finally see my daughter. I can finally hug somebody. Oh my gosh. Yay. Thank God for the vaccine.
[1:19:38.100 --> 1:19:47.100]  Oh my gosh. The vaccine freed us. The vaccine did it again. Thank God for the vaccine. I mean, they love, they love their vaccine. They need the vaccine.
[1:19:47.100 --> 1:20:00.100]  You heard about it. I need it. I need you to take the vaccine. I need the vaccine. So they love the vaccine so much. And that's why Trump decided to claim it, to rub it in the liberals' face.
[1:20:00.100 --> 1:20:11.100]  Because he sees them. He sees the liberals fawning over the vaccine, like getting weak at the knees. Like it was like Marilyn Monroe coming up to them with an offer. Oh, the vaccine.
[1:20:11.100 --> 1:20:23.100]  Oh, thank God for the vaccine. And so Trump just sees all this worship fest of the vaccine and says, hey, while you're bowing down to that vaccine, remember, you wouldn't have it if it wasn't for me.
[1:20:23.100 --> 1:20:31.100]  So that's really just Trump rubbing it in the liberals' face because he wants them to know he's already living in their head rent free. He doesn't need to do this.
[1:20:31.100 --> 1:20:42.100]  So again, I don't agree with him doing it, but I understand why he did it. So he sees the left praising the vaccine, worshiping the vaccine, and he just reminds them, hey, while you're worshiping that vaccine, you better thank me.
[1:20:42.100 --> 1:20:48.100]  You better thank me. Of course, that will never happen.
[1:20:48.100 --> 1:21:05.100]  But that's the story at the Gateway Pundit. Never seen a president in American history simultaneously executing a plan and denying its existence. Trump official rips Biden for disgusting lies about Trump vaccine and distribution plan.
[1:21:05.100 --> 1:21:18.100]  Yeah, remember when Biden came in, he said, when I got in, there was no vaccine. There was no plan. The guy had already had the vaccine and he's implementing Trump's warp speed plan.
[1:21:18.100 --> 1:21:25.100]  And he says there was no plan. There was no vaccine as he's executing the plan and takes the vaccine.
[1:21:25.100 --> 1:21:33.100]  Now, does Biden know he's lying or is he just so gone? It's not even funny. How about this big lie? This is, I mean, wow.
[1:21:33.100 --> 1:21:43.100]  I'm telling you, man, look, people need to, it needs to be seared into your children's heads. Democrats are lying to you, period.
[1:21:43.100 --> 1:21:49.100]  A Democrat in Congress and a liberal on TV is lying to you, period. It needs to be accepted. It needs to be taught.
[1:21:49.100 --> 1:21:55.100]  It needs to become mainstream knowledge and information because it's the damn truth.
[1:21:55.100 --> 1:22:00.100]  How about this whopper from Chuck Schumer? Have you ever heard a bigger whopper of a lie?
[1:22:00.100 --> 1:22:07.100]  Chuck Schumer asked about the crisis at the border. Of course, you can't get an answer from the Biden administration from this.
[1:22:07.100 --> 1:22:11.100]  Jen Psaki laughs it off and Biden can't take questions.
[1:22:11.100 --> 1:22:20.100]  So Schumer says, when he's asked, Schumer says that Joe Biden inherited a huge mess from Trump at the border.
[1:22:20.100 --> 1:22:26.100]  Have you ever seen a bigger liar in your life?
[1:22:26.100 --> 1:22:33.100]  How could you even possibly portray that statement as accurate?
[1:22:33.100 --> 1:22:40.100]  Since Biden got into office, border crossings are doubling and tripling.
[1:22:40.100 --> 1:22:43.100]  Now, you tell me how that's Trump.
[1:22:43.100 --> 1:22:46.100]  And then you had the lady come out yesterday. This is incredible.
[1:22:46.100 --> 1:22:53.100]  The lady comes out yesterday and says, yeah, illegal border crossings were way down under Trump and now they're way up.
[1:22:53.100 --> 1:22:59.100]  But that's because we're providing hope and humanity and treating them humanely.
[1:22:59.100 --> 1:23:04.100]  No, it's because you promised them free stuff and invited them across the border.
[1:23:04.100 --> 1:23:07.100]  There's nothing humane about what you're doing. It's disgusting.
[1:23:07.100 --> 1:23:11.100]  You're complicit in the rape of women and children is what you are.
[1:23:11.100 --> 1:23:15.100]  You're complicit in human trafficking. You're complicit in drug trafficking.
[1:23:15.100 --> 1:23:19.100]  Maybe they're consciously involved in this.
[1:23:19.100 --> 1:23:23.100]  But for Chuck Schumer to say Biden inherited a mess from Trump at the border.
[1:23:23.100 --> 1:23:30.100]  Again, I shouldn't have to spend any time explaining how that is an entirely inaccurate false statement.
[1:23:30.100 --> 1:23:32.100]  And Schumer knows it.
[1:23:32.100 --> 1:23:35.100]  What a dirtbag Chuck Schumer is.
[1:23:35.100 --> 1:23:37.100]  What a total and complete dirtbag.
[1:23:37.100 --> 1:23:43.100]  By the way, speaking of the dirtbags, think about what you have so far from Biden's administration.
[1:23:43.100 --> 1:23:50.100]  The guy that likes to dress up as a girl and wants to generally mutilate children, admitted it during the hearings.
[1:23:50.100 --> 1:23:53.100]  So that's one member of Biden's cabinet.
[1:23:53.100 --> 1:23:57.100]  Then you have the new attorney general who can't even answer questions.
[1:23:57.100 --> 1:23:59.100]  He seems like a real dumbass.
[1:23:59.100 --> 1:24:02.100]  Did you see his hearing? Do you believe border crossing is illegal?
[1:24:02.100 --> 1:24:05.100]  Well, I'm really not sure. Really? That's your new attorney general.
[1:24:05.100 --> 1:24:08.100]  Now you've got this individual, Vanita Gupta.
[1:24:08.100 --> 1:24:12.100]  Oh, also they had to cancel near a Tandon. So that didn't work out.
[1:24:12.100 --> 1:24:22.100]  Now you've got Vanita Gupta who holds millions in stock in enterprise accused of enabling Mexican cartels heroin manufacturing.
[1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:24.100]  No, they have been caught.
[1:24:24.100 --> 1:24:34.100]  It's their ingredients used in the heroin that then gets smothered across the southern border that now Joe Biden is promoting and allowing to happen.
[1:24:34.100 --> 1:24:41.100]  And it's his appointee, Vanita Gupta, who is directly involved in it.
[1:24:41.100 --> 1:24:44.100]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[1:24:44.100 --> 1:24:46.100]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[1:24:46.100 --> 1:24:55.100]  This is the Biden administration, a clown show, a joke, tyrannical, illegal, corrupt, destroying everything that is free and good.
[1:24:55.100 --> 1:24:59.100]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[1:24:59.100 --> 1:25:03.100]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[1:25:03.100 --> 1:25:12.100]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[1:25:12.100 --> 1:25:17.100]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[1:25:17.100 --> 1:25:28.100]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[1:25:28.100 --> 1:25:35.100]  would capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees,
[1:25:35.100 --> 1:25:41.100]  not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber is saying and Bill Gates is saying,
[1:25:41.100 --> 1:25:51.100]  but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[1:25:51.100 --> 1:25:55.100]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[1:25:55.100 --> 1:25:59.100]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[1:25:59.100 --> 1:26:02.100]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[1:26:02.100 --> 1:26:07.100]  They're trying to take over civilization and society and they depend on the public being ignorant.
[1:26:07.100 --> 1:26:11.100]  That's why Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:26:11.100 --> 1:26:13.100]  Knowledge is power.
[1:26:13.100 --> 1:26:20.100]  Like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[1:26:20.100 --> 1:26:24.100]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because it's so simple.
[1:26:24.100 --> 1:26:26.100]  Because you won't be under their control anymore.
[1:26:26.100 --> 1:26:32.100]  Well, the vitamin and mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin and mineral fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form,

[1:27:55.100 --> 1:28:06.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:06.100 --> 1:28:28.100]  Imagine being so brainwashed you celebrate your own slavery.
[1:28:28.100 --> 1:28:35.100]  Of course, if they have any linear logic thinking ability, they know that it's a false premise.
[1:28:35.100 --> 1:28:41.100]  And they know that they're engaged in totalitarianism, authoritarianism and tyranny.
[1:28:41.100 --> 1:28:43.100]  But they like it because they like telling you what to do.
[1:28:43.100 --> 1:28:45.100]  That's really what this is all about.
[1:28:45.100 --> 1:28:47.100]  They would gladly chop off their own leg.
[1:28:47.100 --> 1:28:49.100]  If that meant they got to chop off your leg too.
[1:28:49.100 --> 1:28:52.100]  That's the kind of six sadistic people we're dealing with right now.
[1:28:52.100 --> 1:28:53.100]  They call themselves liberals.
[1:28:53.100 --> 1:28:55.100]  They're not their tyrants.
[1:28:55.100 --> 1:28:56.100]  They're authoritarians.
[1:28:56.100 --> 1:28:57.100]  They're totalitarians.
[1:28:57.100 --> 1:28:59.100]  They're brainwashed slaves.
[1:28:59.100 --> 1:29:03.100]  I'm beginning to wonder if they're even human.
[1:29:03.100 --> 1:29:07.100]  So Biden says you can't be free until you take the vaccine.
[1:29:07.100 --> 1:29:12.100]  Hopefully we all take the vaccine by July 4th and we can all be free again.
[1:29:12.100 --> 1:29:20.100]  Mayor Adler, a Democrat mayor of Austin, Texas is fighting tooth and nail to make sure that Austinites have to still wear a mask.
[1:29:20.100 --> 1:29:24.100]  Is he doing anything about the spike in violent crime under his watch?
[1:29:24.100 --> 1:29:26.100]  No, he ignores that.
[1:29:26.100 --> 1:29:33.100]  Is he doing anything about the random fires that happen at homeless camps that he's allowed to take over the city?
[1:29:33.100 --> 1:29:35.100]  No, nothing on that.
[1:29:35.100 --> 1:29:39.100]  Oh, but when it comes to you being a free citizen, he hates that and he's going to make you wear that mask.
[1:29:39.100 --> 1:29:43.100]  And all the little libtards here in Austin love it and worship him for it.
[1:29:43.100 --> 1:29:44.100]  Yeah.
[1:29:44.100 --> 1:29:46.100]  Breathe in your own carbon dioxide.
[1:29:46.100 --> 1:29:50.100]  Breathe in your carbon dioxide that you claim is killing the planet.
[1:29:50.100 --> 1:29:54.100]  Please.
[1:29:54.100 --> 1:29:58.100]  And they just love it.
[1:29:58.100 --> 1:30:05.100]  And they even say the story came out in the Stanford advocate for some wearing a mask is liberating.
[1:30:05.100 --> 1:30:08.100]  It's liberating because they don't like showing their face.
[1:30:08.100 --> 1:30:10.100]  They don't like seeing your face.
[1:30:10.100 --> 1:30:17.100]  It's liberating because they love knowing that they had something to do with dominating you.
[1:30:17.100 --> 1:30:21.100]  So they see you with that mask on that makes them feel good.
[1:30:21.100 --> 1:30:27.100]  That makes them feel in control and that's what they loves to control you.
[1:30:27.100 --> 1:30:39.100]  The modern day liberal is a extreme authoritarian and they can't even see it yet, which is the wildest part.
[1:30:39.100 --> 1:30:55.100]  And now they passed a $2 trillion theft, $2 trillion steal, the biggest money heist in world history was just pulled off by our Congress, the biggest money heist.
[1:30:55.100 --> 1:30:56.100]  Guys, look up.
[1:30:56.100 --> 1:31:03.100]  What was the biggest, the biggest, the biggest cash steal or the biggest money heist of all time ever?
[1:31:03.100 --> 1:31:09.100]  It was a Loomis Fargo, I believe.
[1:31:09.100 --> 1:31:11.100]  What was it?
[1:31:11.100 --> 1:31:12.100]  Yeah, yeah, no, no, it's okay.
[1:31:12.100 --> 1:31:15.100]  I believe the biggest money heist of all time was a Loomis Fargo heist.
[1:31:15.100 --> 1:31:20.100]  It was like $17 million or something.
[1:31:20.100 --> 1:31:25.100]  But guys, see what the biggest money heist of all time is.
[1:31:25.100 --> 1:31:28.100]  Go down, go down to number one.
[1:31:28.100 --> 1:31:34.100]  Let's see what the biggest money heist of all time is because it's been broken.
[1:31:34.100 --> 1:31:37.100]  The biggest money heist of all time has been broken.
[1:31:37.100 --> 1:31:41.100]  These are some pretty big numbers we're getting here.
[1:31:41.100 --> 1:31:42.100]  So let's go.
[1:31:42.100 --> 1:31:53.100]  The central bank of Iraq robbery is $920 million stolen back in 2003 before the Iraq war started.
[1:31:53.100 --> 1:32:01.100]  So the biggest money heist in history of the world, $920 million, the Democrats beat that by trillions.
[1:32:01.100 --> 1:32:03.100]  So they stole $2 trillion.
[1:32:03.100 --> 1:32:06.100]  And so that's obviously the biggest theft in American history as well.
[1:32:06.100 --> 1:32:07.100]  So congratulations.
[1:32:07.100 --> 1:32:12.100]  I want to congratulate the Democrat Party and Nancy Pelosi and the Republicans that went along with it too.
[1:32:12.100 --> 1:32:14.100]  You guys should be congratulated.
[1:32:14.100 --> 1:32:15.100]  Congratulations.
[1:32:15.100 --> 1:32:22.100]  You have just completed the biggest money heist in the world in world history.
[1:32:22.100 --> 1:32:24.100]  And really it's $5 trillion.
[1:32:24.100 --> 1:32:28.100]  It's $5 trillion that they've stolen in the last 12 months.
[1:32:28.100 --> 1:32:34.100]  $5 trillion in stimulus that they quote unquote stimulus.
[1:32:34.100 --> 1:32:37.100]  $5 trillion money heist.
[1:32:37.100 --> 1:32:39.100]  Congratulations to our Congress.
[1:32:39.100 --> 1:32:43.100]  You are now the biggest thieves in the history of the world.
[1:32:43.100 --> 1:32:44.100]  Congratulations.
[1:32:44.100 --> 1:32:47.100]  No wonder why you have walls around the Congress.
[1:32:47.100 --> 1:32:50.100]  No wonder why you have walls around the Capitol.
[1:32:50.100 --> 1:32:53.100]  No wonder why you have the National Guard protecting you.
[1:32:53.100 --> 1:32:58.100]  You just stole $5 trillion.
[1:32:58.100 --> 1:33:04.100]  You are living every day in fear that your criminal activity will finally come back to bite you.
[1:33:04.100 --> 1:33:13.100]  And so that's why you have armed guards and walls protecting you at the Capitol because you just stole $5 trillion.
[1:33:13.100 --> 1:33:15.100]  And you gave it to your friends.
[1:33:15.100 --> 1:33:16.100]  You gave it to Bill Gates.
[1:33:16.100 --> 1:33:24.100]  You gave it to Illinois and California and New York who shut down their economy and destroyed it and now are begging for handouts.
[1:33:24.100 --> 1:33:25.100]  And they just got it.
[1:33:25.100 --> 1:33:32.100]  The biggest theft, the biggest crime in world history, $5 trillion stolen by the United States Congress right in front of our eyes.
[1:33:32.100 --> 1:33:36.100]  And then they told us to thank them for it too.
[1:33:36.100 --> 1:33:39.100]  Because it wasn't enough to rob us blind.
[1:33:39.100 --> 1:33:41.100]  They want to really rub our noses in it.
[1:33:41.100 --> 1:33:45.100]  And so they made us thank them for it too.
[1:33:45.100 --> 1:33:52.100]  And so last night, Biden announced how he's ending poverty with the stimulus bill.
[1:33:52.100 --> 1:33:53.100]  Yeah, right.
[1:33:53.100 --> 1:33:54.100]  It's not going to do anything.
[1:33:54.100 --> 1:33:58.100]  And then they said, again, this is all lies, by the way.
[1:33:58.100 --> 1:33:59.100]  This is all lies.
[1:33:59.100 --> 1:34:00.100]  Basic logic.
[1:34:00.100 --> 1:34:01.100]  You can figure this out.
[1:34:01.100 --> 1:34:07.100]  Biden says 85% of American households will get direct checks from the American Rescue Plan.
[1:34:07.100 --> 1:34:09.100]  How did he get that number?
[1:34:09.100 --> 1:34:10.100]  Nobody knows.
[1:34:10.100 --> 1:34:11.100]  He doesn't even know.
[1:34:11.100 --> 1:34:12.100]  Pulled it out of his ass.
[1:34:12.100 --> 1:34:16.100]  Oh, 85% he says.
[1:34:16.100 --> 1:34:18.100]  Well, what's the actual number?
[1:34:18.100 --> 1:34:21.100]  So how can they, because they've never crunched these numbers.
[1:34:21.100 --> 1:34:22.100]  How can you couldn't even do it?
[1:34:22.100 --> 1:34:25.100]  It would take years.
[1:34:25.100 --> 1:34:37.100]  How would you be able to crunch the numbers where they're claiming if you made less than $75,000 in the year 2019, which by the way is before the pandemic even started.
[1:34:37.100 --> 1:34:55.100]  Yeah, showers, money ends poverty is what all the mainstream media headlines are saying about this stimulus theft, this trillion dollar theft, this putting a large debt on the future Americans just destroying any future prosperity.
[1:34:55.100 --> 1:34:57.100]  But how are they going to do this math?
[1:34:57.100 --> 1:34:59.100]  They obviously never did it.
[1:34:59.100 --> 1:35:07.100]  They say, if you made less than $75,000 in 2019, then you qualify for the $1400 stimulus check.
[1:35:07.100 --> 1:35:09.100]  Well, OK, so have they crunched those numbers?
[1:35:09.100 --> 1:35:11.100]  Do they know how many people made less than that?
[1:35:11.100 --> 1:35:13.100]  No, that would take years to do.
[1:35:13.100 --> 1:35:16.100]  So they never even did that.
[1:35:16.100 --> 1:35:27.100]  And since they didn't do that, how do they know the exact dollar amount of monies that needs to be doled out to these individuals that made less than $75,000?
[1:35:27.100 --> 1:35:33.100]  How do they know to take that exact amount of money and put it into the stimulus bill if they don't even have it?
[1:35:33.100 --> 1:35:35.100]  Because they aren't going to do it.
[1:35:35.100 --> 1:35:37.100]  They never did do it.
[1:35:37.100 --> 1:35:39.100]  It was all a lie.
[1:35:39.100 --> 1:35:41.100]  Nobody crunched those numbers.
[1:35:41.100 --> 1:35:45.100]  Nobody went in and said, OK, here's the amount of people that didn't make $75,000.
[1:35:45.100 --> 1:35:48.100]  And here's how they're all going to be doled out their $1400 checks.
[1:35:48.100 --> 1:35:49.100]  That never happened.
[1:35:49.100 --> 1:35:51.100]  It was another big lie.
[1:35:51.100 --> 1:35:57.100]  And so providing to say 85% of American households will get direct checks from the American rescue plan.
[1:35:57.100 --> 1:35:59.100]  That is a lie.
[1:35:59.100 --> 1:36:01.100]  That is a lie.
[1:36:01.100 --> 1:36:03.100]  And when are you going to get this check?
[1:36:03.100 --> 1:36:05.100]  No.
[1:36:05.100 --> 1:36:09.100]  That'll be interesting to find out.
[1:36:09.100 --> 1:36:13.100]  So I encourage you do a little experiment.
[1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:20.100]  If or when this money is ever doled out and find out if 85% of households that you know got.
[1:36:20.100 --> 1:36:22.100]  Checks from the American rescue plan.
[1:36:22.100 --> 1:36:24.100]  But think about this.
[1:36:24.100 --> 1:36:27.100]  Forget about whether you're going to get that $1400 check or not.
[1:36:27.100 --> 1:36:29.100]  You probably won't.
[1:36:29.100 --> 1:36:42.100]  So $5 trillion in theft, a stimulus, $5 trillion in stimulus has been signed by our Congress in the last 12 months.
[1:36:42.100 --> 1:36:43.100]  So less than a year.
[1:36:43.100 --> 1:36:45.100]  $5 trillion.
[1:36:45.100 --> 1:36:54.100]  Now, if they gave direct cash payments to every American citizen, everybody listening to this broadcast and not listening to this broadcast.
[1:36:54.100 --> 1:36:57.100]  It's an American citizen would receive $42,000.
[1:36:57.100 --> 1:36:59.100]  $42,000.
[1:36:59.100 --> 1:37:02.100]  That's how much they've stolen.
[1:37:02.100 --> 1:37:06.100]  That's how much debt they've put on everyone's head in the last year.
[1:37:06.100 --> 1:37:09.100]  $42,000.
[1:37:09.100 --> 1:37:13.100]  Now, did you get a dime of that?
[1:37:13.100 --> 1:37:18.100]  Are you even going to be lucky enough to get a $1400 check from the government?
[1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:19.100]  Probably not.
[1:37:19.100 --> 1:37:24.100]  They could have given you $42,000 ahead, but it was never about you.
[1:37:24.100 --> 1:37:29.100]  It was always about them.
[1:37:29.100 --> 1:37:33.100]  So once again, we congratulate the United States Congress.
[1:37:33.100 --> 1:37:39.100]  Guys, we need to contact whoever made that list of the biggest money heist of all time and we need to tell them you're missing it.
[1:37:39.100 --> 1:37:46.100]  The United States Congress in the years 2020 and 2021 stole $5 trillion.
[1:37:46.100 --> 1:37:54.100]  Stole $5 trillion from future Americans to enrich themselves and they didn't even share a dime of it.
[1:37:54.100 --> 1:38:02.100]  As you know, we're always upping our game at Info Wars and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[1:38:02.100 --> 1:38:03.100]  It is down and out.
[1:38:03.100 --> 1:38:05.100]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[1:38:05.100 --> 1:38:08.100]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[1:38:08.100 --> 1:38:11.100]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[1:38:11.100 --> 1:38:14.100]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[1:38:14.100 --> 1:38:17.100]  It's got 50 milligrams of Valerian root extract concentrate.
[1:38:17.100 --> 1:38:22.100]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[1:38:22.100 --> 1:38:25.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[1:38:25.100 --> 1:38:28.100]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[1:38:28.100 --> 1:38:30.100]  It's liquid, so it goes right into your body fast.
[1:38:30.100 --> 1:38:34.100]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep?
[1:38:34.100 --> 1:38:35.100]  It's incredible.
[1:38:35.100 --> 1:38:38.100]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[1:38:38.100 --> 1:38:40.100]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.
[1:38:40.100 --> 1:38:47.100]  Get yours today, down and out exclusively at InfoWareStore.com, 40% off out of the gates with free shipping while supplies last.
[1:38:47.100 --> 1:38:50.100]  Down and out, InfoWareStore.com.
[1:38:54.100 --> 1:38:58.100]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:38:58.100 --> 1:39:02.100]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:39:02.100 --> 1:39:05.100]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:39:05.100 --> 1:39:09.100]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[1:39:09.100 --> 1:39:15.100]  So please pray to keep InfoWare on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[1:39:15.100 --> 1:39:23.100]  At the same time, go to InfoWareStore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements,
[1:39:23.100 --> 1:39:27.100]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[1:39:27.100 --> 1:39:29.100]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:39:29.100 --> 1:39:33.100]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:39:33.100 --> 1:39:38.100]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[1:39:38.100 --> 1:39:44.100]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[1:39:44.100 --> 1:39:49.100]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul,
[1:39:49.100 --> 1:39:53.100]  all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[1:39:53.100 --> 1:39:55.100]  Thank you so much.
[1:39:55.100 --> 1:40:02.100]  Every product you hear me on air advertising, we have it stocked in our warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[1:40:02.100 --> 1:40:03.100]  Every product.
[1:40:03.100 --> 1:40:07.100]  So if you order it, we've got it shipped out in a couple of days, sometimes the same day.
[1:40:07.100 --> 1:40:12.100]  Listers get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain's breaking down
[1:40:12.100 --> 1:40:19.100]  and its future orders, its product we're trying to reorder to get back in that we're having trouble with.
[1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:25.100]  I mean, I'm talking about double, triple, quadruple delivery times, and it's across.
[1:40:25.100 --> 1:40:29.100]  Not just the supplement, vitamin, mineral industry, it's across every industry.
[1:40:29.100 --> 1:40:33.100]  So the globalists have successfully devastated the economy.
[1:40:33.100 --> 1:40:35.100]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:40:35.100 --> 1:40:39.100]  You need to visit InfoWareStore.com today and get high quality supplements while you still can
[1:40:39.100 --> 1:40:44.100]  and storeable food at InfoWareStore.com because we have it in stock, it's ready to ship.
[1:40:44.100 --> 1:40:49.100]  But with the supply chain breakdowns, prices are going up, availability is going down,
[1:40:49.100 --> 1:40:50.100]  and it's just crazy.
[1:40:50.100 --> 1:40:55.100]  So please get products while you still can and support the InfoWareStore.com.
[1:40:56.100 --> 1:40:58.100]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[1:40:58.100 --> 1:40:59.100]  It's very bittersweet.
[1:40:59.100 --> 1:41:02.100]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[1:41:02.100 --> 1:41:05.100]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[1:41:05.100 --> 1:41:07.100]  I care about beating the new world order.
[1:41:07.100 --> 1:41:11.100]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:41:11.100 --> 1:41:14.100]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[1:41:14.100 --> 1:41:16.100]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[1:41:16.100 --> 1:41:19.100]  But let's just say this, we're going to see this through to the end.
[1:41:19.100 --> 1:41:22.100]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[1:41:22.100 --> 1:41:26.100]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at InfoWareStore.com.
[1:41:26.100 --> 1:41:28.100]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[1:41:28.100 --> 1:41:31.100]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[1:41:31.100 --> 1:41:32.100]  Do they fund freedom?
[1:41:32.100 --> 1:41:33.100]  No, a lot of them don't.
[1:41:33.100 --> 1:41:37.100]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[1:41:37.100 --> 1:41:40.100]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[1:41:40.100 --> 1:41:42.100]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[1:41:42.100 --> 1:41:45.100]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[1:41:45.100 --> 1:41:48.100]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[1:41:48.100 --> 1:41:51.100]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it.
[1:41:51.100 --> 1:41:53.100]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[1:41:53.100 --> 1:42:19.100]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[1:42:19.100 --> 1:42:26.100]  We are truly witnessing perhaps the most corrupt criminal cabal
[1:42:26.100 --> 1:42:29.100]  on an international planetary scale in human history.
[1:42:29.100 --> 1:42:31.100]  It's really incredible, isn't it?
[1:42:31.100 --> 1:42:33.100]  Now, these people will fall.
[1:42:33.100 --> 1:42:40.100]  They will lose eventually, but we may have to deal with their plans for us before that happens.
[1:42:40.100 --> 1:42:43.100]  But it's getting really bad when Biden, they have to put Biden in,
[1:42:43.100 --> 1:42:46.100]  the guy that can't think, the guy that can't talk,
[1:42:46.100 --> 1:42:49.100]  and then you have Pelosi like who's the real president.
[1:42:49.100 --> 1:42:51.100]  Pelosi is actually the one pulling the strings behind the scenes.
[1:42:51.100 --> 1:42:54.100]  Kamala is doing all the foreign diplomatic phone calls.
[1:42:54.100 --> 1:42:56.100]  Biden is just a puppet.
[1:42:56.100 --> 1:42:58.100]  He has no idea what's even going on.
[1:42:58.100 --> 1:43:02.100]  So it's really just incredible to be living through this and witnessing this.
[1:43:02.100 --> 1:43:06.100]  And then it's like even more surreal to actually be the tip of the spear
[1:43:06.100 --> 1:43:11.100]  and the information war against it knowing they have the long guns out for us.
[1:43:11.100 --> 1:43:16.100]  You know, someday hopefully if we can be victorious and we can get these people off of our necks,
[1:43:16.100 --> 1:43:19.100]  you know, maybe we'll tell the stories of everything that happens around here
[1:43:19.100 --> 1:43:22.100]  behind the scenes that you wouldn't even believe.
[1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:25.100]  But we live to find another day.
[1:43:25.100 --> 1:43:28.100]  Thanks to your support at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:28.100 --> 1:43:31.100]  We live to find another day for now.
[1:43:31.100 --> 1:43:34.100]  Let me just say, we've got breaking news coming out now.
[1:43:34.100 --> 1:43:40.100]  30 women, 30 women, info wars, tomorrow's news today.
[1:43:40.100 --> 1:43:43.100]  It's truly called this months ago.
[1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:47.100]  30 women have now come out and accused Cuomo of harassment.
[1:43:47.100 --> 1:43:51.100]  30 women.
[1:43:51.100 --> 1:43:58.100]  And now Boylan, the original accuser, said that Cuomo is the most dangerous,
[1:43:58.100 --> 1:44:01.100]  the most dangerous man right now.
[1:44:01.100 --> 1:44:04.100]  It's Cuomo.
[1:44:04.100 --> 1:44:09.100]  And you also have 11 House Democrats who have called on Cuomo to resign.
[1:44:09.100 --> 1:44:18.100]  Only one of them, to her credit, the only one of them that mentioned the nursing home death scandal was AOC.
[1:44:18.100 --> 1:44:20.100]  None of the others mentioned that in their statements.
[1:44:20.100 --> 1:44:27.100]  So, hey look, you know, AOC, maybe she's learning a thing or two for the first time in her life.
[1:44:27.100 --> 1:44:31.100]  And she's also working with Matt Gates to end the war on drugs, at least on marijuana.
[1:44:31.100 --> 1:44:33.100]  So good on her for those two things.
[1:44:33.100 --> 1:44:36.100]  I guess a commie gets it right every once in a while.
[1:44:36.100 --> 1:44:40.100]  But, you know, I might as well just stay on this now that I'm here.
[1:44:40.100 --> 1:44:45.100]  So, guys pull up because this was just breaking.
[1:44:45.100 --> 1:44:48.100]  And I guess there was some sort of like group interview conducted.
[1:44:48.100 --> 1:44:49.100]  Guys plug it in.
[1:44:49.100 --> 1:44:51.100]  Let's see if anybody's publishing any stories on this yet.
[1:44:51.100 --> 1:44:56.100]  30 women accusing Cuomo or just find out what the latest news on Cuomo is.
[1:44:56.100 --> 1:45:03.100]  Because I'm sure there's been something new published since I was doing my prep here for the show.
[1:45:03.100 --> 1:45:08.100]  But you've got 11 Democrats calling on Cuomo to resign now, Nadler amongst them.
[1:45:08.100 --> 1:45:14.100]  And most names you wouldn't have heard of, but Nadler and Ocasio-Cortez.
[1:45:14.100 --> 1:45:19.100]  And again, of the 11, Ocasio-Cortez is the only one that mentioned the nursing home death scandal.
[1:45:19.100 --> 1:45:24.100]  The Cuomo death, the nursing home slayer, Cuomo.
[1:45:24.100 --> 1:45:25.100]  I mean, just the psycho.
[1:45:25.100 --> 1:45:29.100]  I mean, you just, you look in that guy's eyes and it's psycho.
[1:45:29.100 --> 1:45:34.100]  Like he should be, he's the American psycho from the movie.
[1:45:34.100 --> 1:45:38.100]  So it's only going to get worse for him, but he says he's not going anywhere.
[1:45:38.100 --> 1:45:41.100]  And he's saying he's innocent of all of these charges.
[1:45:41.100 --> 1:45:42.100]  What happened to believe all women?
[1:45:42.100 --> 1:45:44.100]  Remember that one?
[1:45:44.100 --> 1:45:49.100]  Again, showing you the total fraud.
[1:45:49.100 --> 1:45:51.100]  Okay, so the crew is just pulling up all the latest.
[1:45:51.100 --> 1:45:54.100]  So we'll see when all of this comes out, but you watch.
[1:45:54.100 --> 1:45:58.100]  This number is going to be skyrocketing.
[1:45:58.100 --> 1:46:00.100]  Just, just watch over the next week.
[1:46:00.100 --> 1:46:03.100]  This number is going to be skyrocketing.
[1:46:03.100 --> 1:46:07.100]  So I don't know what the official number is, but I'm telling you it's dozens, folks.
[1:46:07.100 --> 1:46:10.100]  It's dozens.
[1:46:10.100 --> 1:46:13.100]  But again, showing you the fraud of the Democrat Party.
[1:46:13.100 --> 1:46:15.100]  Oh, believe all women.
[1:46:15.100 --> 1:46:16.100]  Me too.
[1:46:16.100 --> 1:46:21.100]  Remember Kamala Harris on the stage during the presidential debates for the Democrat Party?
[1:46:21.100 --> 1:46:25.100]  Remember she said she believed the women that accused Joe Biden?
[1:46:25.100 --> 1:46:27.100]  Remember that?
[1:46:27.100 --> 1:46:30.100]  Boy, she dropped that act real fast.
[1:46:30.100 --> 1:46:36.100]  Or maybe it was a Machiavellian move by her to shoehorn her way into the vice presidency saying,
[1:46:36.100 --> 1:46:42.100]  I will bring down Biden for the sexual harassment claims or you're making me the vice president.
[1:46:42.100 --> 1:46:44.100]  Because everything switched after that.
[1:46:44.100 --> 1:46:48.100]  She came after Biden said she believes the accusers like Tara Reid.
[1:46:48.100 --> 1:46:51.100]  She then dropped out of the race before a single vote was cast.
[1:46:51.100 --> 1:46:53.100]  And then she became Biden's vice president.
[1:46:53.100 --> 1:46:56.100]  So I think we know how that worked.
[1:46:56.100 --> 1:46:58.100]  No, but the claims against Cuomo, Me too.
[1:46:58.100 --> 1:47:02.100]  He says he believes all women, but now he doesn't because they're accusing him.
[1:47:02.100 --> 1:47:04.100]  See how that works?
[1:47:04.100 --> 1:47:09.100]  And so now the Me Too movement is fractured badly.
[1:47:09.100 --> 1:47:11.100]  It's really dead in its tracks.
[1:47:11.100 --> 1:47:15.100]  Inside the Me Too scandal that's tearing Times Up apart.
[1:47:15.100 --> 1:47:18.100]  Times Up is the original group that launched the Me Too movement.
[1:47:18.100 --> 1:47:25.100]  So all the money they've raised, all the activism they've done has all been brought to nothing.
[1:47:25.100 --> 1:47:30.100]  Because it's ironic because the whole Me Too movement was started to hurt President Trump
[1:47:30.100 --> 1:47:32.100]  and help the Democrat Party politically.
[1:47:32.100 --> 1:47:36.100]  And it turns out it's all been Democrats that have been haunted by the Me Too movement.
[1:47:36.100 --> 1:47:43.100]  Bill Clinton, Harvey Weinstein, Al Franken, Andrew Cuomo.
[1:47:43.100 --> 1:47:46.100]  The list goes on and on. Fairfax.
[1:47:46.100 --> 1:47:53.100]  So the Me Too movement is dead because it was started as a political weapon against Trump.
[1:47:53.100 --> 1:47:56.100]  Trump's out of office. It's only hurt the Democrats.
[1:47:56.100 --> 1:47:58.100]  So now Me Too is dead.
[1:47:58.100 --> 1:48:02.100]  It was never about women. It was never about survivors.
[1:48:02.100 --> 1:48:11.100]  It was always about politics, just like every other big lie that the Democrats and their media cohorts tell you.
[1:48:11.100 --> 1:48:19.100]  These people can't help themselves from lying every day.
[1:48:19.100 --> 1:48:27.100]  But so this is part of the Democrat policy that ends up coming back to bite them.
[1:48:27.100 --> 1:48:32.100]  And perhaps here are some others.
[1:48:32.100 --> 1:48:37.100]  See, because black Americans are getting sick of this too.
[1:48:37.100 --> 1:48:39.100]  This whole critical race theory.
[1:48:39.100 --> 1:48:43.100]  You saw a woman in Ohio yesterday scold a school board, a black lady,
[1:48:43.100 --> 1:48:47.100]  scold a school board for critical race theory, making kids racist.
[1:48:47.100 --> 1:48:49.100]  There was a lady on Fox News last night.
[1:48:49.100 --> 1:48:52.100]  I forget a black lady, but she's married to a white guy.
[1:48:52.100 --> 1:48:56.100]  And so their son has white skin, looks like Meghan Markle.
[1:48:56.100 --> 1:49:01.100]  And she says that her son gets bullied at school because he's white, but has a black mother.
[1:49:01.100 --> 1:49:04.100]  And so he's white because he gets bullied from his white.
[1:49:04.100 --> 1:49:07.100]  Then when he's like, my mom's black, they bully him even more.
[1:49:07.100 --> 1:49:09.100]  So it's all Democrat policy.
[1:49:09.100 --> 1:49:16.100]  Black Naval Academy grad slams paternalistic white liberals demanding lower standards for elite high school.
[1:49:16.100 --> 1:49:18.100]  And so what have they done?
[1:49:18.100 --> 1:49:24.100]  Well, they have testing programs that put you into either elite learning schools,
[1:49:24.100 --> 1:49:30.100]  or they put you into different learnings, curriculums inside the schools.
[1:49:30.100 --> 1:49:33.100]  I remember when I went to school, it was called A track, B track, C track.
[1:49:33.100 --> 1:49:38.100]  Basically, when you take the test before the school year, if you test the highest, you go into A track,
[1:49:38.100 --> 1:49:40.100]  and then B track, C track, and so on.
[1:49:40.100 --> 1:49:48.100]  And so they found out that when they looked at the demographics of these tests,
[1:49:48.100 --> 1:49:54.100]  that it was mostly white people or Asians that were getting into the elite high schools
[1:49:54.100 --> 1:49:57.100]  and getting into the A track classes, if you will.
[1:49:57.100 --> 1:50:02.100]  And so they said, this is racist, we're canceling all of it.
[1:50:02.100 --> 1:50:06.100]  And so I could sit here and talk about how this is destroyed higher education,
[1:50:06.100 --> 1:50:10.100]  understand black people don't like this, nobody likes this.
[1:50:10.100 --> 1:50:17.100]  Again, it's all Democrat party policy to virtue signal, and it actually hurts society.
[1:50:17.100 --> 1:50:23.100]  In fact, let me segue into that because that was my point here.
[1:50:23.100 --> 1:50:25.100]  And I'll come back on this later with other news.
[1:50:25.100 --> 1:50:30.100]  But in the UK, stunning images are coming out on the lunch program.
[1:50:30.100 --> 1:50:33.100]  It's kind of like Michelle Obama's lunch program that looked like dog food.
[1:50:33.100 --> 1:50:39.100]  Unacceptable school meal with half raw potatoes slammed as Marcus Rashford shares pick.
[1:50:39.100 --> 1:50:41.100]  And so here's what's going on.
[1:50:41.100 --> 1:50:48.100]  Here's what happens when liberal policy destroys actual prosperity and actual free markets
[1:50:48.100 --> 1:50:51.100]  and real legitimate competition.
[1:50:51.100 --> 1:50:56.100]  You just destroy the morale of your entire community.
[1:50:56.100 --> 1:50:58.100]  You destroy the morale of your entire country.
[1:50:58.100 --> 1:50:59.100]  So what happens?
[1:50:59.100 --> 1:51:05.100]  So police become a joke, lunch programs become a joke, media becomes a joke because nobody cares.
[1:51:05.100 --> 1:51:07.100]  Everything's falling apart.
[1:51:07.100 --> 1:51:10.100]  It's kind of like, I forget there was a study.
[1:51:10.100 --> 1:51:14.100]  I remember in college we talked about this, but basically, you know,
[1:51:14.100 --> 1:51:18.100]  because college students tend to be a bit sloppy, but basically it was,
[1:51:18.100 --> 1:51:24.100]  if you have people in a household, and I remember experiencing this when I had roommates,
[1:51:24.100 --> 1:51:29.100]  if you have people in a household and one of the individuals is really sloppy,
[1:51:29.100 --> 1:51:34.100]  but the other two are really neat, even when outnumbered,
[1:51:34.100 --> 1:51:41.100]  the sloppy individual ends up having more influence on the state of the household than the neat individuals.
[1:51:41.100 --> 1:51:44.100]  So the household ends up being dirty.
[1:51:44.100 --> 1:51:48.100]  Say you have five people in a household, one of them is a sloppy dirt ball.
[1:51:48.100 --> 1:51:53.100]  The whole house ends up becoming sloppy dirt balls because the other people that like to clean,
[1:51:53.100 --> 1:51:56.100]  they just can't, it's always dirty, it's always dirty, so they just give up.
[1:51:56.100 --> 1:51:59.100]  They just give up and it just all falls apart.
[1:51:59.100 --> 1:52:02.100]  Well, this happens on the big scale too.
[1:52:02.100 --> 1:52:06.100]  So when they collapse the U.S. border, when they say everything is racist,
[1:52:06.100 --> 1:52:10.100]  when they endure and enforce their canceled culture,
[1:52:10.100 --> 1:52:13.100]  eventually all of society just gives up, just doesn't care.
[1:52:13.100 --> 1:52:16.100]  Oh, they're going to pass a $5 trillion stimulus and pay themselves off.
[1:52:16.100 --> 1:52:18.100]  Well, screw it, I'll be a criminal.
[1:52:18.100 --> 1:52:21.100]  I'll steal, I'll cheat, I'll lie.
[1:52:21.100 --> 1:52:23.100]  So the same thing happens in U.K.
[1:52:23.100 --> 1:52:27.100]  So they destroy the U.K., they destroy its culture, they destroy its police force.
[1:52:27.100 --> 1:52:29.100]  They're just ending it all.
[1:52:29.100 --> 1:52:32.100]  And so the people in the lunch program that feed the kids, they don't give a damn.
[1:52:32.100 --> 1:52:36.100]  Yeah, half cooked potato, raw this, raw that, we don't care.
[1:52:36.100 --> 1:52:39.100]  Our entire country is falling apart. Civilization is falling apart.
[1:52:39.100 --> 1:52:41.100]  Eat a half raw potato. I don't give a damn anyway.
[1:52:44.100 --> 1:52:48.100]  Blisters ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[1:52:48.100 --> 1:52:51.100]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine? Why do you do that?
[1:52:51.100 --> 1:52:54.100]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[1:52:54.100 --> 1:52:57.100]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[1:52:57.100 --> 1:53:00.100]  a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine,
[1:53:00.100 --> 1:53:03.100]  but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types
[1:53:03.100 --> 1:53:06.100]  because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[1:53:06.100 --> 1:53:08.100]  Boom, we did it, it's popular, it's X3.
[1:53:08.100 --> 1:53:11.100]  Is it better than X2? You decide, it's different strokes for different folks.
[1:53:11.100 --> 1:53:17.100]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[1:53:17.100 --> 1:53:21.100]  And that is down and out. It's super strong, way stronger than knock out,
[1:53:21.100 --> 1:53:23.100]  but they don't compete with each other.
[1:53:23.100 --> 1:53:26.100]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas,

[1:54:10.100 --> 1:54:14.100]  Decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction
[1:54:14.100 --> 1:54:18.100]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:54:18.100 --> 1:54:23.100]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[1:54:23.100 --> 1:54:30.100]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:54:30.100 --> 1:54:35.100]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion
[1:54:35.100 --> 1:54:39.100]  about actual facts that pertain to reality.

[1:55:09.100 --> 1:55:18.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, never forget about Band.video,
[1:55:18.100 --> 1:55:22.100]  where there's so much great content, a lot we don't even get to hear on air.
[1:55:22.100 --> 1:55:26.100]  Like, for example, Gregory's special reports, John Bown special reports,
[1:55:26.100 --> 1:55:28.100]  other special reports, some fun stuff we do.
[1:55:28.100 --> 1:55:31.100]  Here's the latest report from Gregory's, a very powerful piece,
[1:55:31.100 --> 1:55:35.100]  about the global tyranny we are now going under.
[1:55:35.100 --> 1:55:40.100]  If you want to know the enemy, read their agenda in their own documents.
[1:55:40.100 --> 1:55:44.100]  In their weekly Strategic Intelligence newsletter,
[1:55:44.100 --> 1:55:50.100]  the World Economic Forum spotlighted the Fourth Industrial Revolution,
[1:55:50.100 --> 1:55:55.100]  which they defined as a fundamental change in the ways we live and work,
[1:55:55.100 --> 1:56:06.100]  merging the physical, digital, and biological worlds and fusing technologies and ways that create both promise and peril.
[1:56:06.100 --> 1:56:13.100]  They link to a library of articles on the subject and give us the trending top five,
[1:56:13.100 --> 1:56:21.100]  requiring vaccine passports for certain activities, discrimination, or behavioral change.
[1:56:21.100 --> 1:56:29.100]  Except when the subject of discrimination comes up, it has nothing to do with a person's rights not to be vaccinated.
[1:56:29.100 --> 1:56:37.100]  The so-called discrimination has to do with lower-income countries not getting the jab until 2022.
[1:56:37.100 --> 1:56:45.100]  The double-speak is that not getting a vaccine for an imaginary virus is discrimination.
[1:56:45.100 --> 1:56:53.100]  The author Joan Costa-Efant, an associate professor of political science at the London School of Economics,
[1:56:53.100 --> 1:57:04.100]  writes that taking a vaccine is pro-social behavior and described those who would refuse a vaccine as vaccine-resistant.
[1:57:04.100 --> 1:57:14.100]  Costa-Efant went on to describe these people as contrarians, stating that their very existence might be healthy for the rest of us,
[1:57:14.100 --> 1:57:22.100]  and that vaccine passports would change their behavior by forcing them to get vaccinated if they wanted to travel.
[1:57:22.100 --> 1:57:31.100]  Costa-Efant wrote that those who comply do so to virtue signal, and that this should be used as a way to push the vaccine passport.
[1:57:31.100 --> 1:57:35.100]  And if anyone thinks he is concerned about a dangerous pandemic,
[1:57:35.100 --> 1:57:41.100]  he also wrote that the use of passports should be limited to non-essential services.
[1:57:41.100 --> 1:57:47.100]  The next article, written by senior executive at Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation,
[1:57:47.100 --> 1:57:54.100]  warns that the world has only 10 years to change course before ultimate climate disaster.
[1:57:54.100 --> 1:58:06.100]  And the only way to save the world is to give government leaders oversight of policy, regulation, and research and development of all the world's industry.
[1:58:06.100 --> 1:58:13.100]  Sounds like old school communism, but they are now calling it circularity.
[1:58:13.100 --> 1:58:18.100]  In the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines is linked to good nutrition,
[1:58:18.100 --> 1:58:26.100]  the author admits that a healthy diet and nutrition will strengthen the immune system and protect a person from infection.
[1:58:26.100 --> 1:58:35.100]  But the efficacy to be concerned about is how malnutrition can affect the quality of immune response to vaccination.
[1:58:35.100 --> 1:58:42.100]  And what is of utmost importance is providing information on COVID-19 vaccines.
[1:58:42.100 --> 1:58:48.100]  A boring article on carbon revenue and the redistribution of wealth.
[1:58:48.100 --> 1:58:53.100]  And finally, how happiness, anger, and anxiety can help you negotiate,
[1:58:53.100 --> 1:58:59.100]  which speaks to their mentally ill communist cult selling the anti-human agenda
[1:58:59.100 --> 1:59:09.100]  on how it would be wise to reserve happiness and how anger can lead to gains by soliciting concessions from the counterpart.
[1:59:09.100 --> 1:59:13.100]  However, the anger must be deeply felt.
[1:59:13.100 --> 1:59:21.100]  The World Economic Forum is indeed a weird cult of big bank multinational corporation weirdos.
[1:59:21.100 --> 1:59:23.100]  But this is reality.
[1:59:23.100 --> 1:59:31.100]  Without any sort of resistance, this global communist model is what's coming to your new normal.
[1:59:31.100 --> 1:59:53.100]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[1:59:53.100 --> 2:00:01.100]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset. They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[2:00:01.100 --> 2:00:06.100]  They're trying to take over civilization and society, and they depend on the public being ignorant.
[2:00:06.100 --> 2:00:10.100]  That's why Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[2:00:10.100 --> 2:00:19.100]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[2:00:19.100 --> 2:00:25.100]  That's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because it's so simple because you won't be under their control anymore.
[2:00:25.100 --> 2:00:34.100]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at Infowars.com.
[2:00:34.100 --> 2:00:39.100]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price. It funds the Infowar at the same time.
[2:00:39.100 --> 2:00:42.100]  No other product you can buy does that.

[2:00:58.100 --> 2:01:07.100]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Owen Shroyer. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:01:07.100 --> 2:01:15.100]  All right, we've got a report coming up from Alex in the next segment. In the meantime, though, I'm going to drink this Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee from Infowars.com.
[2:01:15.100 --> 2:01:18.100]  It's so delicious.
[2:01:18.100 --> 2:01:27.100]  My favorite coffee. Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee available exclusively at Infowars.com.

[2:01:33.100 --> 2:01:38.100]  I'm just going to do a news blitz here and just pile drive through the rest of this news before the Alex report comes up.
[2:01:38.100 --> 2:01:42.100]  And if I can get through all of it, maybe we can take a couple segments for your phone calls.
[2:01:42.100 --> 2:01:49.100]  And I also imagine I'll just open up the War Room today at 3 o'clock PM Central and just open that up for phone calls too.
[2:01:49.100 --> 2:01:52.100]  Just because I already have covered all of this news.
[2:01:52.100 --> 2:01:58.100]  But let me get focused here and just pile drive through the rest of this news here.
[2:01:58.100 --> 2:02:09.100]  From Infowars.com, translator of Biden's inauguration poem says he was kicked off project because he's not black or female.
[2:02:09.100 --> 2:02:14.100]  So eventually I guess that means Biden will step aside because he's a white male too.
[2:02:14.100 --> 2:02:23.100]  But in a funnier translator translation event, oh man, I forget the lady's name.
[2:02:23.100 --> 2:02:29.100]  But I see if you can find this. It was either yesterday or Wednesday.
[2:02:29.100 --> 2:02:33.100]  A member from the Biden team is addressing the issue with the southern border.
[2:02:33.100 --> 2:02:39.100]  And at the end of the address says in English, the border is not open.
[2:02:39.100 --> 2:02:41.100]  The border is not open.
[2:02:41.100 --> 2:02:46.100]  And then in Spanish to speak to the Hispanic audience or the people that speak Spanish.
[2:02:46.100 --> 2:02:52.100]  And then so she tries to speak in Spanish and she says the border is not closed.
[2:02:52.100 --> 2:02:57.100]  So was that intentional to tell people to come in or was it a slip up?
[2:02:57.100 --> 2:03:03.100]  And she says that the border is not closed accidentally because she can't speak Spanish.
[2:03:03.100 --> 2:03:05.100]  Yeah, there it is right there.
[2:03:05.100 --> 2:03:09.100]  Now again, though, in that story, they're not telling you when she does the Spanish translation,
[2:03:09.100 --> 2:03:13.100]  she tells people in Spanish that the border is not closed.
[2:03:13.100 --> 2:03:15.100]  Not very bright.
[2:03:15.100 --> 2:03:18.100]  These characters that the Biden administration has put in.
[2:03:18.100 --> 2:03:25.100]  And you know, in my head last night, for example, the crew pulled up the picture of all the people from Antifa that have been arrested.
[2:03:25.100 --> 2:03:28.100]  I mean, look at this freak.
[2:03:28.100 --> 2:03:31.100]  Look at this freak.
[2:03:31.100 --> 2:03:37.100]  This is not, I'm telling you, every day goes by I'm debating just going full on alien invasion.
[2:03:37.100 --> 2:03:42.100]  I mean, you look at these people, man, they don't look human. There's something off there.
[2:03:42.100 --> 2:03:50.100]  And so it's kind of like when you put together the mosaic of all the Antifa in Portland and they look alien, they don't even look human.
[2:03:50.100 --> 2:03:55.100]  You could do the same thing with all these top Democrats and all these Biden appointees.
[2:03:55.100 --> 2:03:59.100]  They don't look human. There's something off there.
[2:03:59.100 --> 2:04:02.100]  Even Biden doesn't look it like he's there.
[2:04:02.100 --> 2:04:10.100]  But he has in the past. But yeah, look at that. What what is that?
[2:04:10.100 --> 2:04:15.100]  What is Rachel divine? What is Nancy Pelosi?
[2:04:15.100 --> 2:04:19.100]  What are these freaks?
[2:04:19.100 --> 2:04:29.100]  Seriously, I'm almost to the point. These are just alien invasions, but it's like, you know, demons, demons possessing souls, call it aliens, call it demons, call it whatever you want.
[2:04:29.100 --> 2:04:34.100]  These are demons. These are aliens. They're occupying human meat suits.
[2:04:34.100 --> 2:04:38.100]  Just like in they live the formaldehyde face.
[2:04:38.100 --> 2:04:44.100]  But it's getting so bad. They're they're not even they're beginning to the point where they don't even look human, folks.
[2:04:44.100 --> 2:04:47.100]  They don't even look human anymore.
[2:04:47.100 --> 2:04:54.100]  So the Biden, the Biden team says that the border is open, whether accidentally or intentionally. I don't know.
[2:04:54.100 --> 2:04:56.100]  Meanwhile.
[2:04:56.100 --> 2:05:00.100]  Meanwhile, over 80. Excuse me.
[2:05:00.100 --> 2:05:07.100]  Almost 9000 child migrants in federal care facilities. Oh, I thought we were getting rid of the kids in cages.
[2:05:07.100 --> 2:05:14.100]  No, they're packed in facilities are overflowing. They now may have to open up a NASA facility in California.
[2:05:14.100 --> 2:05:21.100]  A giant NASA facility in California may have to be opened up now to take in all the illegal immigration overflow.
[2:05:21.100 --> 2:05:26.100]  And they stack them one on top of another, all testing positive for covid. It's all good.
[2:05:26.100 --> 2:05:29.100]  It's all good, baby.
[2:05:29.100 --> 2:05:34.100]  Yeah, we want to stop covid, but only if it's an American spreading it.
[2:05:34.100 --> 2:05:39.100]  If somebody who came across the southern border. Well, that's just fine.
[2:05:39.100 --> 2:05:47.100]  Speaking of a problem that they're having with migration in the UK heartbreaking story and it turns out this is a regular thing.
[2:05:47.100 --> 2:05:53.100]  Which we kind of already knew, but this is just crazy.
[2:05:53.100 --> 2:05:59.100]  So it came out today and CNN and other outlets, though.
[2:05:59.100 --> 2:06:06.100]  They identify body of Sarah Everard who went missing in London. So this 33 year old girl.
[2:06:06.100 --> 2:06:10.100]  Walking around the streets of London disappears for days. Nobody knows where she is.
[2:06:10.100 --> 2:06:16.100]  They eventually find her dead body 50 miles from the scene, obviously raped and tortured.
[2:06:16.100 --> 2:06:22.100]  And so you read into it a little bit and then you find out there's these other stories.
[2:06:22.100 --> 2:06:27.100]  No woman should live in fear of going out. It's time their voices were listened to.
[2:06:27.100 --> 2:06:38.100]  Now, remember, it was two or three years ago where you had the series of migrant rapes in Germany, in Sweden, in France.
[2:06:38.100 --> 2:06:46.100]  And so the response by the liberal politicians who let all the migrants who are in their raping people and then the media says, well, that's just their culture.
[2:06:46.100 --> 2:06:56.100]  So their culture is rape and they want to culturally enrich you with their rape and the Democrats are promoting all of it and the liberals and the European Union are promoting all of it.
[2:06:56.100 --> 2:07:08.100]  And then the UK. And so, but remember when you had these these these series of migrant rapes that they said was just, oh, that's just their culture to come in here and rape you from North Africa or the Middle East.
[2:07:08.100 --> 2:07:14.100]  They just get to rape you. That's their culture. You don't get culture, but they do when they rape you.
[2:07:14.100 --> 2:07:24.100]  And so they said, well, we're going to give women now in Sweden bracelets that say, please don't rape me because that will stop the assailant.
[2:07:24.100 --> 2:07:30.100]  The migrant from from North Africa or the Middle East is getting ready to rape you a woman in Sweden.
[2:07:30.100 --> 2:07:37.100]  And then you show your wristband and you say, no, it says, don't rape me. And they say, oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea. I won't rape you now.
[2:07:37.100 --> 2:07:45.100]  That's their culture, though. See, I'm not here to rape you. I'm here to culturally enrich you.
[2:07:45.100 --> 2:07:55.100]  So it turns out this is normal for women in Europe. They have fear going out in the streets. They have fear going out at night.
[2:07:55.100 --> 2:08:05.100]  They can't go out by themselves because they're afraid they're going to get raped and tortured by the migrant gangs that are roaming around the cities.
[2:08:05.100 --> 2:08:16.100]  Imagine that. Anti-rape wristbands. Do they work? Is it a gun? No.
[2:08:16.100 --> 2:08:24.100]  A gun would work, but they don't want you to have a gun either because then you'd have to culturally enrich them before they culturally enrich you.
[2:08:24.100 --> 2:08:33.100]  And then the rape doesn't happen and the Democrats and liberals don't want that. So it turns out in the UK, in Europe, women can't even walk the streets anymore.
[2:08:33.100 --> 2:08:41.100]  They can't go out alone. They're scared to death that they're going to get raped and tortured by migrants. Isn't that nice?
[2:08:41.100 --> 2:08:51.100]  Isn't that just wonderful, I say? But there's your anti-rape wristband. Yeah, that'll stop them.
[2:08:51.100 --> 2:08:57.100]  Congratulations. You now have an anti-rape wristband.
[2:08:57.100 --> 2:09:08.100]  Meanwhile, this is just hilarious. CNN publishes this story, you know, because it's all about victims.
[2:09:08.100 --> 2:09:14.100]  Talking about during the pandemic, guys, I'm going to need a doc-ham shot here because you're not even going to believe this, folks.
[2:09:14.100 --> 2:09:22.100]  A story on CNN about people struggling in California during the pandemic because the governor shut down and killed the economy so they're starving to death.
[2:09:22.100 --> 2:09:27.100]  Now, look at the image that CNN uses here for this story.
[2:09:27.100 --> 2:09:36.100]  Trying to humanize the struggle because of the fake pandemic, all brought on by Democrat Party politics, and Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci faking a pandemic.
[2:09:36.100 --> 2:09:41.100]  Sometimes we eat. Sometimes we don't. Some families are struggling to eat during the pandemic.
[2:09:41.100 --> 2:09:47.100]  And folks, they show a lady on here who's at least 300 pounds.
[2:09:47.100 --> 2:09:55.100]  I mean, morbidly obese probably hasn't seen her undercarriage in decades. Excuse me.
[2:09:55.100 --> 2:09:58.100]  So this is what I'm saying, though. I've been saying this.
[2:09:58.100 --> 2:10:04.100]  The reason why you don't have a real uprising in America is because poor people are fat.
[2:10:04.100 --> 2:10:10.100]  If poor people were actually starving, then there would be legitimate uprisings like you see in communist countries.
[2:10:10.100 --> 2:10:12.100]  But see, what they've done here in America is smart.
[2:10:12.100 --> 2:10:19.100]  They've kept food prices down enough so that people can still be fat on the hog while living in poverty.
[2:10:19.100 --> 2:10:25.100]  And so they use this woman to virtue signal and say people are starving in the fake pandemic.
[2:10:25.100 --> 2:10:33.100]  And the woman is over 300 pounds and morbidly obese and the number one risk for catching COVID.
[2:10:33.100 --> 2:10:35.100]  But it doesn't even stop there.
[2:10:35.100 --> 2:10:43.100]  You see these pictures of the refugees illegally crossing the southern border and they're 500 pounds too.
[2:10:43.100 --> 2:10:46.100]  And it says a starving refugee checks her iPhone.
[2:10:46.100 --> 2:10:52.100]  Yeah, a starving poor refugee that weighs 350 pounds and has an iPhone.
[2:10:52.100 --> 2:10:56.100]  The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment.
[2:10:56.100 --> 2:11:01.100]  Cell phones are an amazing tool. Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[2:11:01.100 --> 2:11:06.100]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHIComs especially,
[2:11:06.100 --> 2:11:12.100]  are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets.
[2:11:12.100 --> 2:11:19.100]  When they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[2:11:19.100 --> 2:11:25.100]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[2:11:25.100 --> 2:11:27.100]  In their own words, they admit it.
[2:11:27.100 --> 2:11:32.100]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[2:11:32.100 --> 2:11:35.100]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight. They're faraday cages.
[2:11:35.100 --> 2:11:38.100]  They just look like a cloth envelope. They work absolutely great.
[2:11:38.100 --> 2:11:45.100]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling
[2:11:45.100 --> 2:11:48.100]  and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because it's not their business.

[2:12:55.100 --> 2:13:03.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:13:03.100 --> 2:13:07.100]  And welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[2:13:07.100 --> 2:13:11.100]  This is a tape transmission I'm sending out to you taped on this Friday morning.
[2:13:11.100 --> 2:13:15.100]  But Owen Schreuer is live on air right now. I'll be back in just a few minutes.
[2:13:15.100 --> 2:13:19.100]  But I have been encouraged by a lot of really smart people,
[2:13:19.100 --> 2:13:23.100]  formerly in the highest positions of U.S. intelligence,
[2:13:23.100 --> 2:13:27.100]  to take more of the videos where I predicted things in the past and to air those.
[2:13:27.100 --> 2:13:32.100]  And we have hundreds and hundreds of these that our archivist has been finding.
[2:13:32.100 --> 2:13:35.100]  Because at one level, I'm not trying to brag whenever I show these videos.
[2:13:35.100 --> 2:13:39.100]  It's so people understand that we really know what we're talking about then.
[2:13:39.100 --> 2:13:42.100]  We know what we're talking about now, and people should really listen.
[2:13:42.100 --> 2:13:50.100]  So here are a bunch of excerpts from 2010 with myself and another really smart guy, Alan White,
[2:13:50.100 --> 2:13:57.100]  on the show. It's a seven-minute compilation from 2010 on more than seven different dates.
[2:13:57.100 --> 2:14:01.100]  And so if you're a radio listener, you'll hear a second or two pause between each clip.
[2:14:01.100 --> 2:14:07.100]  That's for TV viewers. We're showing the date of when this was broadcast, when this was transmitted.
[2:14:07.100 --> 2:14:11.100]  Now, the New World Order hopes in the future when they're actually carrying out the total mass extermination,
[2:14:11.100 --> 2:14:14.100]  there'll be total AI censorship control of everybody.
[2:14:14.100 --> 2:14:20.100]  And so the only way these clips in the future, if they're successful, will be alive is on hidden hard drives,
[2:14:20.100 --> 2:14:26.100]  DVDs, and things that you share in what is low-tech today.
[2:14:26.100 --> 2:14:29.100]  What is low-tech today in the future will be even more low-tech,
[2:14:29.100 --> 2:14:34.100]  because the global's here about 20, 30, 40, 50 years, depending on the technology ahead of us.
[2:14:34.100 --> 2:14:36.100]  I don't want us to get to this point.
[2:14:36.100 --> 2:14:40.100]  But just like I didn't want 10 years ago for us to get to the point where at now,
[2:14:40.100 --> 2:14:42.100]  we're on a path like a roadmap.
[2:14:42.100 --> 2:14:49.100]  Like if I'm driving down from Omaha, Nebraska, and then I know the big cities I'm going to go through,
[2:14:49.100 --> 2:14:52.100]  and then I'm going to hit Oklahoma City, and then next I'm going to hit Dallas,
[2:14:52.100 --> 2:14:57.100]  and next I'm going to hit Waco, Temple, Austin, San Antonio.
[2:14:57.100 --> 2:15:02.100]  I mean, I started telling people back when we were up in Omaha to use that analogy.
[2:15:02.100 --> 2:15:05.100]  And now we're all the way down to Oklahoma City.
[2:15:05.100 --> 2:15:10.100]  And by the time you get down to Austin, I mean, we're talking billions being killed,
[2:15:10.100 --> 2:15:13.100]  robots on the streets, combat robots, all of it, which you're now seeing.
[2:15:13.100 --> 2:15:15.100]  Again, I didn't envision all this.
[2:15:15.100 --> 2:15:17.100]  The globalists said they'd do it. It's a real plan.
[2:15:17.100 --> 2:15:20.100]  We're insane if we don't stop it. It's a post-human future.
[2:15:20.100 --> 2:15:27.100]  So here is 7 Minute X Serbs from 11 years ago of us laying this out right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[2:15:27.100 --> 2:15:29.100]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[2:15:29.100 --> 2:15:31.100]  Thanks for keeping us in attack formation.
[2:15:31.100 --> 2:15:34.100]  Without you, we would not even have this platform today to be able to warn the world.
[2:15:34.100 --> 2:15:39.100]  We have a psychotic group of eugenicists that openly say they want to brain damage us
[2:15:39.100 --> 2:15:43.100]  and make a servile ahead of just openly releasing megabyte weapons to kill,
[2:15:43.100 --> 2:15:46.100]  basically, the majority of the population.
[2:15:50.100 --> 2:15:55.100]  All the eugenics and the soft kill that we've seen, again, soft kill is something that kills you 20 years later
[2:15:55.100 --> 2:15:57.100]  so you don't know what killed you.
[2:15:57.100 --> 2:15:59.100]  You don't know what caused the disease.
[2:15:59.100 --> 2:16:06.100]  You don't understand the underlying chemical or biological precursors or binary systems
[2:16:06.100 --> 2:16:10.100]  that mix together to create that degenerative disease.
[2:16:14.100 --> 2:16:16.100]  What does James Bond say to Goldfinger?
[2:16:16.100 --> 2:16:18.100]  He says, do you expect me to talk?
[2:16:18.100 --> 2:16:20.100]  No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[2:16:20.100 --> 2:16:30.100]  This is about shutting us down, bankrupting us, and then coming in with the soft kill weapons.
[2:16:30.100 --> 2:16:33.100]  Bill Joy, why the future doesn't need us.
[2:16:33.100 --> 2:16:37.100]  And he has a meeting with several hundred top technology leaders and owners,
[2:16:37.100 --> 2:16:39.100]  and they just said they had a discussion.
[2:16:39.100 --> 2:16:40.100]  Do we kill everybody?
[2:16:40.100 --> 2:16:41.100]  We don't need them anymore?
[2:16:41.100 --> 2:16:44.100]  Or do we give them mindless games and entertainment?
[2:16:44.100 --> 2:16:50.100]  And the decision is, basically, soft kill you, slowly sterilize you, and get rid of your generations that way.
[2:16:53.100 --> 2:17:00.100]  All these eugenicists, all these scientists that think they're saving the earth by dumbing people down ahead of the mass culling.
[2:17:00.100 --> 2:17:06.100]  They first got to render you servile and drugged, so when they release the mega-plagues and start killing everybody,
[2:17:06.100 --> 2:17:08.100]  you've heard Dr. Pianca say, coming soon.
[2:17:08.100 --> 2:17:11.100]  And he got a standing ovation at the Texas Academy of Sciences.
[2:17:11.100 --> 2:17:13.100]  It went on for minutes, the paper reported.
[2:17:13.100 --> 2:17:14.100]  Remember that?
[2:17:14.100 --> 2:17:16.100]  We talked about it and it became national news.
[2:17:16.100 --> 2:17:19.100]  He goes to Europe and gets awards from the royalty over there.
[2:17:19.100 --> 2:17:23.100]  He projected red skulls on the wall on the PowerPoint and said,
[2:17:23.100 --> 2:17:28.100]  the time is coming when we will 90% die when the airborne Ebola comes.
[2:17:28.100 --> 2:17:31.100]  I am sad for my family, but it's good for the earth.
[2:17:31.100 --> 2:17:32.100]  We will die.
[2:17:32.100 --> 2:17:34.100]  It is going to be beautiful.
[2:17:34.100 --> 2:17:36.100]  And standing ovation.
[2:17:36.100 --> 2:17:38.100]  Oh, people, oh, yes, oh.
[2:17:38.100 --> 2:17:41.100]  The time of the control freak orgy is coming.
[2:17:41.100 --> 2:17:44.100]  The time of the mass death is coming.
[2:17:47.100 --> 2:17:53.100]  Most republic has to come to the chemicals in the water and now they're going straight to the endgame
[2:17:53.100 --> 2:17:59.100]  of an injection that turns you into a biological android and the cops are going to hold everybody down.
[2:17:59.100 --> 2:18:03.100]  They're going to do it themselves and they just want to lose their soul, their body.
[2:18:03.100 --> 2:18:04.100]  They love it.
[2:18:04.100 --> 2:18:09.100]  They love it because they feel that petty power trip of submitting and so good.
[2:18:09.100 --> 2:18:14.100]  Your family, your whole family line, they plan to neutralize us psychologically
[2:18:14.100 --> 2:18:17.100]  before they just release mega plagues and actually kill you.
[2:18:17.100 --> 2:18:21.100]  They even said last week in the British papers, it's time to stop mincing words.
[2:18:21.100 --> 2:18:23.100]  We need to start getting rid of everybody.
[2:18:23.100 --> 2:18:25.100]  I mean, they're now coming out.
[2:18:25.100 --> 2:18:27.100]  They're getting really ready for the hot kill weapons.
[2:18:27.100 --> 2:18:30.100]  And so for the people out there that are laughing right now, you know,
[2:18:30.100 --> 2:18:33.100]  when they release these, if we're unable to stop them, just I want you,
[2:18:33.100 --> 2:18:35.100]  at least while you're dying to know who killed you.
[2:18:35.100 --> 2:18:37.100]  The news will be telling you Al Qaeda did it.
[2:18:37.100 --> 2:18:40.100]  But how long do you think they really start the mass plagues?
[2:18:40.100 --> 2:18:42.100]  They've just been testing the soft kills up until now.
[2:18:42.100 --> 2:18:45.100]  They really want to devastate and kill a lot of people.
[2:18:45.100 --> 2:18:46.100]  Well, they do.
[2:18:46.100 --> 2:18:49.100]  And that was all part of the fake swine flu and other flu,
[2:18:49.100 --> 2:18:53.100]  the avian flu before that to remember, too, that fizzled off into nowhere.
[2:18:53.100 --> 2:18:54.100]  And SARS.
[2:18:54.100 --> 2:18:58.100]  Yeah, it's getting as used to the idea that it's definitely coming.
[2:18:58.100 --> 2:19:01.100]  And that's what even the professors will tell their students in university.
[2:19:01.100 --> 2:19:03.100]  The plague is just around the corner.
[2:19:03.100 --> 2:19:07.100]  And so they will release it when it's the right time,
[2:19:07.100 --> 2:19:12.100]  when people are dumbed down enough to simply die off quietly and say,
[2:19:12.100 --> 2:19:14.100]  oh, well, what could they do to try their best?
[2:19:14.100 --> 2:19:18.100]  And most folks actually unfortunately will go that way.
[2:19:18.100 --> 2:19:20.100]  But it's coming.
[2:19:20.100 --> 2:19:21.100]  There's no doubt about it.
[2:19:21.100 --> 2:19:22.100]  It's coming.
[2:19:22.100 --> 2:19:26.100]  And remember, too, I've got into bacterial viral warfare in a big way over the years.
[2:19:26.100 --> 2:19:31.100]  And all the writings that they've disclosed to the public on these topics
[2:19:31.100 --> 2:19:33.100]  from the governments themselves,
[2:19:33.100 --> 2:19:37.100]  they admit that for every plague that they create in the laboratory,
[2:19:37.100 --> 2:19:40.100]  and they've got thousands of them since World War II.
[2:19:40.100 --> 2:19:43.100]  They had lots during World War II, in fact, they created in the lab.
[2:19:43.100 --> 2:19:48.100]  They always must have, by international law, the antidote for them as well
[2:19:48.100 --> 2:19:52.100]  at every stage of mutation of virus or bacterium.
[2:19:52.100 --> 2:19:54.100]  So they have them.
[2:19:54.100 --> 2:19:57.100]  And the big rigs themselves, of course, will get a real inoculation
[2:19:57.100 --> 2:19:59.100]  that will prevent them from catching it.
[2:19:59.100 --> 2:20:02.100]  And that's one of the incentives to get on board
[2:20:02.100 --> 2:20:05.100]  for those who are climbing the ladder, of course, is to get up there
[2:20:05.100 --> 2:20:07.100]  and to make sure that you and your family,
[2:20:07.100 --> 2:20:12.100]  that's promised that your family will also be preserved and looked after.
[2:20:12.100 --> 2:20:14.100]  But it's all in the name of bringing down the population
[2:20:14.100 --> 2:20:18.100]  because we, you see, the useless eaters are now unsustainable.
[2:20:18.100 --> 2:20:22.100]  We are using the resources they claim that will feed their families.
[2:20:22.100 --> 2:20:25.100]  You know, the right kind of people's families who should survive
[2:20:25.100 --> 2:20:27.100]  to feed them for thousands of years.
[2:20:27.100 --> 2:20:29.100]  So they must get rid of us now.
[2:20:29.100 --> 2:20:31.100]  That's what they're openly saying, and you're quite right.
[2:20:31.100 --> 2:20:33.100]  They are openly saying it now.
[2:20:33.100 --> 2:20:35.100]  They aren't hiding anything, yeah.
[2:20:35.100 --> 2:20:37.100]  Well, first they're going to collapse the population,
[2:20:37.100 --> 2:20:41.100]  give people inoculations for flu that have the viruses
[2:20:41.100 --> 2:20:43.100]  that will destroy the resistance centers.
[2:20:43.100 --> 2:20:46.100]  So what? I mean, if we don't back them off,
[2:20:46.100 --> 2:20:49.100]  I mean, they're already slaughtering people in mass in Latin America and Africa.
[2:20:49.100 --> 2:20:51.100]  They've been admittedly caught over and over again.
[2:20:51.100 --> 2:20:55.100]  What's the timeframe, Alan, when they'll really start releasing megadeth on people?
[2:20:55.100 --> 2:20:57.100]  I'm sure you know, like everything else that they do,
[2:20:57.100 --> 2:21:01.100]  I'm sure 9-11 was planned probably 40 years before they hit it.
[2:21:01.100 --> 2:21:04.100]  That's how they do things, a long, long-term business plan, long, long-term...
[2:21:04.100 --> 2:21:07.100]  The Northwoods was 40 years, about 30 years before, yeah.
[2:21:07.100 --> 2:21:10.100]  Yeah, and so they'll have a definite timetable.
[2:21:10.100 --> 2:21:12.100]  They'll know exactly when the public's ready to accept it.
[2:21:12.100 --> 2:21:15.100]  If I have done what we are in the polls, they'll constantly take,
[2:21:15.100 --> 2:21:17.100]  and then they will release it.
[2:21:21.100 --> 2:21:23.100]  You are being poisoned.
[2:21:23.100 --> 2:21:25.100]  You have got to choose sides.
[2:21:25.100 --> 2:21:27.100]  And there's no decision.
[2:21:27.100 --> 2:21:28.100]  You're already on our side.
[2:21:28.100 --> 2:21:30.100]  You're already slated for extermination.
[2:21:30.100 --> 2:21:34.100]  Slow, soft kill extermination, getting more and more intense.
[2:21:34.100 --> 2:21:37.100]  The system's already tested how to roll out a new plague,
[2:21:37.100 --> 2:21:40.100]  have a celebrity lead the plague,
[2:21:40.100 --> 2:21:46.100]  and to make sure they manage the plague so that real cures and the real cause is never found.
[2:21:46.100 --> 2:21:53.100]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off
[2:21:53.100 --> 2:21:59.100]  the successes and full-worses that if you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[2:21:59.100 --> 2:22:05.100]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game,
[2:22:05.100 --> 2:22:09.100]  and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[2:22:09.100 --> 2:22:14.100]  They're trying to shutter and silence the human resistance, so now is the time.
[2:22:14.100 --> 2:22:17.100]  To understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate,
[2:22:17.100 --> 2:22:20.100]  and everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[2:22:20.100 --> 2:22:23.100]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[2:22:23.100 --> 2:22:27.100]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't.
[2:22:27.100 --> 2:22:32.100]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:22:32.100 --> 2:22:38.100]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:22:38.100 --> 2:22:43.100]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that we fight hard.
[2:22:43.100 --> 2:22:46.100]  We have to make sure that long, dark night doesn't come.
[2:22:46.100 --> 2:22:49.100]  So be the polar bears you are.
[2:22:52.100 --> 2:22:56.100]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[2:22:56.100 --> 2:23:00.100]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[2:23:00.100 --> 2:23:04.100]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that
[2:23:04.100 --> 2:23:08.100]  they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being cold,
[2:23:08.100 --> 2:23:10.100]  being totally enslaved.
[2:23:10.100 --> 2:23:14.100]  Because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[2:23:14.100 --> 2:23:19.100]  And they are collapsing the Third World with their economic weapons to then flood us with the Third World
[2:23:19.100 --> 2:23:25.100]  that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[2:23:25.100 --> 2:23:30.100]  capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood
[2:23:30.100 --> 2:23:36.100]  of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab
[2:23:36.100 --> 2:23:42.100]  are saying, and Bill Gates are saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN
[2:23:42.100 --> 2:23:48.100]  and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[2:23:48.100 --> 2:23:52.100]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[2:23:52.100 --> 2:23:56.100]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[2:23:56.100 --> 2:24:00.100]  People ask me all the time, they go, Joe, are you on cocaine or are you on meth?
[2:24:00.100 --> 2:24:01.100]  How are you so excited?
[2:24:01.100 --> 2:24:06.100]  How do I not get excited about world government, forced mass, forced inoculations,
[2:24:06.100 --> 2:24:10.100]  open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved?
[2:24:10.100 --> 2:24:12.100]  I'm sorry, I'm a fighter.
[2:24:12.100 --> 2:24:17.100]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well, and so I'll just say this.
[2:24:17.100 --> 2:24:20.100]  I try to be calm, I try to be focused.
[2:24:20.100 --> 2:24:23.100]  I don't know what I do if I wasn't still on air right now.
[2:24:23.100 --> 2:24:28.100]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air because you have to realize,
[2:24:28.100 --> 2:24:32.100]  when I tell you that you're the Info War, that's not me patting on the head.
[2:24:32.100 --> 2:24:36.100]  You are 99% of the equation.
[2:24:36.100 --> 2:24:38.100]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products,
[2:24:38.100 --> 2:24:43.100]  infowarstore.com, when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[2:24:43.100 --> 2:24:45.100]  So you are the Info War.
[2:24:45.100 --> 2:24:47.100]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[2:24:47.100 --> 2:24:49.100]  Thank you for all you've done.
[2:24:49.100 --> 2:24:51.100]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalists.
[2:24:51.100 --> 2:24:54.100]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[2:24:54.100 --> 2:24:55.100]  It's very bittersweet.
[2:24:55.100 --> 2:24:58.100]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[2:24:58.100 --> 2:25:01.100]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[2:25:01.100 --> 2:25:03.100]  I care about beating the new world war.
[2:25:03.100 --> 2:25:07.100]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[2:25:07.100 --> 2:25:11.100]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[2:25:11.100 --> 2:25:14.100]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[2:25:14.100 --> 2:25:16.100]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[2:25:16.100 --> 2:25:18.100]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[2:25:18.100 --> 2:25:20.100]  So please pray for us and please buy the products.
[2:25:20.100 --> 2:25:24.100]  And then infowarstore.com, they're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[2:25:24.100 --> 2:25:27.100]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[2:25:27.100 --> 2:25:29.100]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[2:25:29.100 --> 2:25:33.100]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[2:25:33.100 --> 2:25:36.100]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[2:25:36.100 --> 2:25:38.100]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:25:38.100 --> 2:25:41.100]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[2:25:41.100 --> 2:25:44.100]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:25:44.100 --> 2:25:47.100]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it,
[2:25:47.100 --> 2:25:49.100]  because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[2:25:49.100 --> 2:25:54.100]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:26:20.100 --> 2:26:23.100]  One of the most beautiful renditions of America,
[2:26:23.100 --> 2:26:27.100]  the beautiful there by Ray Charles.
[2:26:27.100 --> 2:26:32.100]  Back in the day when we had pride.
[2:26:32.100 --> 2:26:35.100]  Back in the day where we loved our country, we understood what it meant
[2:26:35.100 --> 2:26:38.100]  and how important it was.
[2:26:38.100 --> 2:26:42.100]  We've fallen far from that grace.
[2:26:42.100 --> 2:26:47.100]  And a perfect example is what's going on with the George Floyd case right now,
[2:26:47.100 --> 2:26:50.100]  where we have breaking news.
[2:26:50.100 --> 2:26:56.100]  Minneapolis City Council has just approved a $27 million settlement
[2:26:56.100 --> 2:26:58.100]  with George Floyd's family.
[2:26:58.100 --> 2:27:00.100]  Wow.
[2:27:00.100 --> 2:27:06.100]  Boy, they should just walk away with their riches
[2:27:06.100 --> 2:27:11.100]  that their sadly drug addicted criminal family member, George Floyd, just got for them.
[2:27:11.100 --> 2:27:12.100]  Wow.
[2:27:12.100 --> 2:27:16.100]  Talk about a victory.
[2:27:16.100 --> 2:27:19.100]  This country is so messed up, man.
[2:27:19.100 --> 2:27:24.100]  And it was Robert Barnes that was saying that the average payout
[2:27:24.100 --> 2:27:28.100]  in a situation like this is less than a million dollars.
[2:27:28.100 --> 2:27:32.100]  So how did Floyd's family get $27 million?
[2:27:32.100 --> 2:27:36.100]  Well, I'll tell you how because the terrorist mobs,
[2:27:36.100 --> 2:27:41.100]  the terrorist mobs led by the Democrat Party and their media cohorts
[2:27:41.100 --> 2:27:44.100]  had already burned Minneapolis to the ground once
[2:27:44.100 --> 2:27:46.100]  and they were set to do it again.
[2:27:46.100 --> 2:27:49.100]  And if you think, though, $27 million is going to stop that from happening,
[2:27:49.100 --> 2:27:53.100]  you've got a sad reality about to hit you in the face.
[2:27:53.100 --> 2:27:56.100]  The trial for Chauvin is ongoing.
[2:27:56.100 --> 2:28:00.100]  The trial for the other officers involved starts in August.
[2:28:00.100 --> 2:28:03.100]  And you know, the judge said something this morning
[2:28:03.100 --> 2:28:07.100]  that indicates he wants to play this thing square.
[2:28:07.100 --> 2:28:10.100]  Judge Barr's prosecution from describing George Floyd
[2:28:10.100 --> 2:28:12.100]  as a gentle giant at Chauvin trial.
[2:28:12.100 --> 2:28:14.100]  Yeah, because that's a lie.
[2:28:14.100 --> 2:28:16.100]  You could describe him as a drug addict.
[2:28:16.100 --> 2:28:20.100]  That would be honest.
[2:28:20.100 --> 2:28:26.100]  A criminal, that would be honest.
[2:28:26.100 --> 2:28:30.100]  You already had one shooting at the George Floyd Autonomous Zone
[2:28:30.100 --> 2:28:32.100]  in Minneapolis.
[2:28:32.100 --> 2:28:35.100]  You've had thousands of people out there ready to burn the city to the ground
[2:28:35.100 --> 2:28:41.100]  if a result comes out that they don't like, which is any result.
[2:28:41.100 --> 2:28:48.100]  If even if they hung Chauvin in the streets of Minneapolis,
[2:28:48.100 --> 2:28:50.100]  they'd still riot.
[2:28:50.100 --> 2:28:52.100]  Because that's what they want.
[2:28:52.100 --> 2:28:54.100]  You're only empowering them.
[2:28:54.100 --> 2:28:58.100]  What should be happening is they should all be getting busted up by the police
[2:28:58.100 --> 2:29:01.100]  for engaging in felonious behavior, but that won't happen.
[2:29:01.100 --> 2:29:04.100]  So they will riot and they will burn.
[2:29:04.100 --> 2:29:08.100]  And now George Floyd's family has made $27 million off of the death
[2:29:08.100 --> 2:29:14.100]  of a drug overdose from George Floyd.
[2:29:14.100 --> 2:29:18.100]  And so you now have the lawyer, Ben Crump, who's always in all these cases.
[2:29:18.100 --> 2:29:20.100]  He's a real dirtbag.
[2:29:20.100 --> 2:29:23.100]  You have ambulance chasers and then you have fake racism chasers.
[2:29:23.100 --> 2:29:26.100]  That would be Ben Crump.
[2:29:26.100 --> 2:29:31.100]  He says, Mr. Floyd died because the weight of the entire Minneapolis Police Department
[2:29:31.100 --> 2:29:33.100]  was on his neck.
[2:29:33.100 --> 2:29:43.100]  And he says that this was a violation of George Floyd's rights.
[2:29:43.100 --> 2:29:45.100]  Well, I guess he's right.
[2:29:45.100 --> 2:29:50.100]  I mean, George Floyd has the right to peacefully and gracefully die from his drug overdose
[2:29:50.100 --> 2:29:58.100]  and his heart failure from years of drug overdosing.
[2:29:58.100 --> 2:30:02.100]  Oh, bringing controlled substances into the defense's old playbook.
[2:30:02.100 --> 2:30:07.100]  He was on a deadly amount of three different drugs.
[2:30:07.100 --> 2:30:09.100]  The guy obviously overdosed.
[2:30:09.100 --> 2:30:13.100]  He was probably going to die any day soon anyway with the condition his heart was in.
[2:30:13.100 --> 2:30:16.100]  And he couldn't, he couldn't, he couldn't handle that event.
[2:30:16.100 --> 2:30:18.100]  His heart gave out, his body gave out.
[2:30:18.100 --> 2:30:20.100]  He overdosed on drugs.
[2:30:20.100 --> 2:30:23.100]  Oh, that's an old defense.
[2:30:23.100 --> 2:30:26.100]  Racism is the old defense.
[2:30:26.100 --> 2:30:31.100]  You think Derek Shalvin doesn't wake up every day wishing he never met George Floyd.
[2:30:31.100 --> 2:30:35.100]  You don't think Derek Shalvin wakes up every day wishing he never became a police officer,
[2:30:35.100 --> 2:30:37.100]  wishing he called in sick that day?
[2:30:37.100 --> 2:30:43.100]  That's the worst day of Derek Shalvin's life.
[2:30:43.100 --> 2:30:44.100]  He's racist.
[2:30:44.100 --> 2:30:45.100]  He did it on purpose.
[2:30:45.100 --> 2:30:46.100]  It's murder.
[2:30:46.100 --> 2:30:51.100]  Lies, lies, lies.
[2:30:51.100 --> 2:30:58.100]  George Floyd's family has been enriched to the tunes of probably hundreds of millions of dollars by this event.
[2:30:58.100 --> 2:31:04.100]  The greatest thing George Floyd ever did for his family was overdosing on drugs with a police officer's knee on his neck.
[2:31:04.100 --> 2:31:05.100]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[2:31:05.100 --> 2:31:06.100]  Is that insensitive?
[2:31:06.100 --> 2:31:07.100]  Screw you.
[2:31:07.100 --> 2:31:09.100]  I don't give a damn.
[2:31:09.100 --> 2:31:12.100]  What's insensitive is burning a damn city to the ground.
[2:31:12.100 --> 2:31:19.100]  What's insensitive is lying about this event so that you can burn a damn city to the ground and claim it's righteous and just.
[2:31:19.100 --> 2:31:21.100]  That's insensitive.
[2:31:21.100 --> 2:31:26.100]  Not telling the damn truth about George Floyd.
[2:31:26.100 --> 2:31:32.100]  Before the day Floyd died, how much do you think he did to help his family?
[2:31:32.100 --> 2:31:34.100]  Oh, but then afterwards his family loves him now.
[2:31:34.100 --> 2:31:38.100]  Yeah, after he made you about 50 million dollars, you love him, don't you?
[2:31:38.100 --> 2:31:40.100]  Disgusting.
[2:31:40.100 --> 2:31:44.100]  They should donate every cent of that to black communities.
[2:31:44.100 --> 2:31:47.100]  They won't do it.
[2:31:47.100 --> 2:31:51.100]  Oh, but they will give half a million dollars to the George Floyd Memorial site.
[2:31:51.100 --> 2:31:54.100]  Isn't that nice?
[2:31:54.100 --> 2:31:56.100]  Wow, how gracious of them.
[2:31:56.100 --> 2:32:03.100]  They've made almost 50 million dollars off the depth of George Floyd that we even know of.
[2:32:03.100 --> 2:32:06.100]  But they're going to give half a million to the Floyd Memorial.
[2:32:06.100 --> 2:32:08.100]  That's nice.
[2:32:08.100 --> 2:32:11.100]  This is so disgusting.
[2:32:11.100 --> 2:32:14.100]  This is so disgusting.
[2:32:14.100 --> 2:32:19.100]  27 million settlement with George Floyd's family.
[2:32:19.100 --> 2:32:23.100]  So boy, oh boy, now, now get ready for this to happen.
[2:32:23.100 --> 2:32:31.100]  There will now be probably actually real George Floyd mimic deaths.
[2:32:31.100 --> 2:32:37.100]  Well, you will have people bomb themselves out on drugs, sitting in a car.
[2:32:37.100 --> 2:32:40.100]  By the way, George Floyd was in the car, bombed out on drugs.
[2:32:40.100 --> 2:32:42.100]  He could have started that vehicle and killed somebody.
[2:32:42.100 --> 2:32:44.100]  Oh, that doesn't count.
[2:32:44.100 --> 2:32:46.100]  So you watch.
[2:32:46.100 --> 2:32:50.100]  You're now going to see, and it won't matter if a white guy does it, but you'll watch.
[2:32:50.100 --> 2:32:56.100]  I bet you there's mimic events where black or white, it doesn't matter.
[2:32:56.100 --> 2:33:04.100]  Where men will intentionally overdose on drugs and then get into a conflict with police
[2:33:04.100 --> 2:33:10.100]  and then hoping they die during the overdose while in the conflict with the police
[2:33:10.100 --> 2:33:15.100]  so that they can be enriched, they can enrich their family and the deaths
[2:33:15.100 --> 2:33:17.100]  and then become world famous in the process.
[2:33:17.100 --> 2:33:19.100]  It's going to become a copycat event now.
[2:33:19.100 --> 2:33:22.100]  When you put numbers like 27 million out there,
[2:33:22.100 --> 2:33:26.100]  you better damn believe somebody's going to kill themselves with drugs
[2:33:26.100 --> 2:33:29.100]  but try to do it during a police confrontation to get that payout.
[2:33:29.100 --> 2:33:31.100]  Kind of like what just happened in Dallas.
[2:33:31.100 --> 2:33:33.100]  By the way, where's the mainstream media on this?
[2:33:33.100 --> 2:33:38.100]  A black guy in Dallas jail for years.
[2:33:38.100 --> 2:33:41.100]  The number of the time ahead is 43, but maybe the guy was 43 years old.
[2:33:41.100 --> 2:33:44.100]  I can't remember, 43 is the year coming in my head.
[2:33:44.100 --> 2:33:51.100]  But he goes to jail because and now they admit there was a cash reward put out
[2:33:51.100 --> 2:33:55.100]  for the suspect in, I think it was a murder case or something.
[2:33:55.100 --> 2:33:57.100]  I don't remember the case exactly.
[2:33:57.100 --> 2:34:02.100]  And this guy was in jail in Dallas because three men wanted that reward money
[2:34:02.100 --> 2:34:04.100]  and so they turned in this individual.
[2:34:04.100 --> 2:34:08.100]  I deed him during a lineup and now they've all come out and said,
[2:34:08.100 --> 2:34:09.100]  no, we lied.
[2:34:09.100 --> 2:34:10.100]  We just wanted the cash payout.
[2:34:10.100 --> 2:34:13.100]  That's all it was.
[2:34:13.100 --> 2:34:19.100]  And a man sat in jail for years because of that.
[2:34:19.100 --> 2:34:21.100]  Nobody even picked it up.
[2:34:21.100 --> 2:34:22.100]  Happened in Dallas this week.
[2:34:22.100 --> 2:34:24.100]  He was released.
[2:34:24.100 --> 2:34:25.100]  There it is.
[2:34:25.100 --> 2:34:27.100]  How a judge decided lies and reward money,
[2:34:27.100 --> 2:34:34.100]  led a jury to wrongfully convict a Dallas man in deadly robbery.
[2:34:34.100 --> 2:34:37.100]  And that man right there, Ben Spencer, black, by the way,
[2:34:37.100 --> 2:34:40.100]  media doesn't care about him.
[2:34:40.100 --> 2:34:45.100]  He sat in jail and innocent man for years because somebody wanted that reward
[2:34:45.100 --> 2:34:46.100]  money.
[2:34:46.100 --> 2:34:51.100]  Well, now they just put reward money on you if you die during a police exchange
[2:34:51.100 --> 2:34:52.100]  and it doesn't matter.
[2:34:52.100 --> 2:34:57.100]  I'm telling you, man, people will cut themselves and then get into a conflict
[2:34:57.100 --> 2:35:00.100]  with police and then bleed out dying from a self-inflicted wound
[2:35:00.100 --> 2:35:03.100]  and the media will still blame the police.
[2:35:03.100 --> 2:35:07.100]  And then you'll have the Democrat terrorists burn cities to the ground
[2:35:07.100 --> 2:35:12.100]  and then the city council will say, here, here's millions of dollars, please.
[2:35:12.100 --> 2:35:14.100]  Thirty-four years in jail is what he spent.
[2:35:14.100 --> 2:35:16.100]  So I had a little dyslexia in my photographic memory.
[2:35:16.100 --> 2:35:19.100]  I said 43 is 34.
[2:35:19.100 --> 2:35:20.100]  So you get ready now.
[2:35:20.100 --> 2:35:23.100]  Now you've just put reward money.
[2:35:23.100 --> 2:35:28.100]  Now you've just issued millions in reward money if you get killed by police
[2:35:28.100 --> 2:35:32.100]  and you're black and the Democrats burn your city to the ground.
[2:35:32.100 --> 2:35:35.100]  So you will now see copycat attempts.
[2:35:35.100 --> 2:35:40.100]  Now I don't know if they'll get the payouts, but there will be copycat attempts
[2:35:40.100 --> 2:35:45.100]  to stage a wrongful death against police officers, to stage that wrongful death
[2:35:45.100 --> 2:35:50.100]  to get their family millions of dollars when they die.
[2:35:50.100 --> 2:35:54.100]  Blisters ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[2:35:54.100 --> 2:35:57.100]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[2:35:57.100 --> 2:35:58.100]  Why do you do that?
[2:35:58.100 --> 2:36:00.100]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[2:36:00.100 --> 2:36:03.100]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[2:36:03.100 --> 2:36:06.100]  a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine,
[2:36:06.100 --> 2:36:10.100]  but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types
[2:36:10.100 --> 2:36:12.100]  because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[2:36:12.100 --> 2:36:13.100]  Boom, we did it.
[2:36:13.100 --> 2:36:14.100]  It's popular.
[2:36:14.100 --> 2:36:15.100]  It's X3.
[2:36:15.100 --> 2:36:16.100]  Is it better than X2?
[2:36:16.100 --> 2:36:17.100]  You decide.
[2:36:17.100 --> 2:36:18.100]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[2:36:18.100 --> 2:36:23.100]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping,
[2:36:23.100 --> 2:36:25.100]  and that is down and out.
[2:36:25.100 --> 2:36:28.100]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out,
[2:36:28.100 --> 2:36:30.100]  but they don't compete with each other.
[2:36:30.100 --> 2:36:32.100]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas,

[2:36:51.100 --> 2:36:55.100]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[2:36:55.100 --> 2:36:58.100]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[2:36:58.100 --> 2:37:02.100]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[2:37:02.100 --> 2:37:04.100]  The big globalist publications are coming after us,
[2:37:04.100 --> 2:37:06.100]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[2:37:06.100 --> 2:37:09.100]  So please pray to keep M4s on the air,
[2:37:09.100 --> 2:37:12.100]  and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[2:37:12.100 --> 2:37:15.100]  At the same time, go to mforestore.com while you still can,
[2:37:15.100 --> 2:37:19.100]  and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements,
[2:37:19.100 --> 2:37:24.100]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[2:37:24.100 --> 2:37:26.100]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:37:26.100 --> 2:37:30.100]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:37:30.100 --> 2:37:35.100]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[2:37:35.100 --> 2:37:41.100]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at mforestore.com.
[2:37:41.100 --> 2:37:44.100]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements, or books or films,
[2:37:44.100 --> 2:37:48.100]  all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity.
[2:37:48.100 --> 2:37:50.100]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[2:37:50.100 --> 2:37:52.100]  Thank you so much.
[2:37:52.100 --> 2:37:56.100]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[2:37:56.100 --> 2:38:00.100]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[2:38:00.100 --> 2:38:02.100]  They're trying to take over civilization and society,
[2:38:02.100 --> 2:38:05.100]  and they depend on the public being ignorant.
[2:38:05.100 --> 2:38:09.100]  That's what Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[2:38:09.100 --> 2:38:13.100]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies are made up of all these tissues
[2:38:13.100 --> 2:38:18.100]  and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[2:38:18.100 --> 2:38:21.100]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals,
[2:38:21.100 --> 2:38:24.100]  because it's so simple because you won't be under their control anymore.
[2:38:24.100 --> 2:38:29.100]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out there
[2:38:29.100 --> 2:38:33.100]  in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at mforestore.com.

[2:38:55.100 --> 2:39:00.100]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us,
[2:39:00.100 --> 2:39:04.100]  not just tracking and recording our GPS location,
[2:39:04.100 --> 2:39:09.100]  but recording audio and video as well, with or without a battery.
[2:39:09.100 --> 2:39:16.100]  Now, with the info wars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[2:39:16.100 --> 2:39:23.100]  Excellent. Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.

[2:39:27.100 --> 2:39:34.100]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers
[2:39:34.100 --> 2:39:38.100]  are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[2:39:38.100 --> 2:39:43.100]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[2:39:43.100 --> 2:39:49.100]  Support the info war and get your info wars privacy pouch today.
[2:39:49.100 --> 2:39:54.100]  infowarstore.com
[2:39:54.100 --> 2:40:03.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:40:03.100 --> 2:40:12.100]  Like about 18 and 25, I left Tennessee very much alive.
[2:40:12.100 --> 2:40:17.100]  So imagine George Floyd's family is now going to be living in million dollar mansions
[2:40:17.100 --> 2:40:21.100]  driving around Bentley's and Ferrari's all because George Floyd died
[2:40:21.100 --> 2:40:24.100]  of a drug overdose and heart failure with a police officer's knee on his neck.
[2:40:24.100 --> 2:40:28.100]  Wow. And you the taxpayer are paying for all of it.
[2:40:28.100 --> 2:40:32.100]  It's just out of control, man. This country is so out of control.
[2:40:32.100 --> 2:40:35.100]  And the only option is just limited small government.
[2:40:35.100 --> 2:40:37.100]  That's the only solution any of this.
[2:40:37.100 --> 2:40:40.100]  But of course, what do we see being pushed for bigger, more government
[2:40:40.100 --> 2:40:44.100]  to all coming from our politicians, mostly the Democrat Party and the media.
[2:40:44.100 --> 2:40:50.100]  Now, I have to move on here because this is so key.
[2:40:50.100 --> 2:40:52.100]  And I got all these other news stories.
[2:40:52.100 --> 2:40:55.100]  I'm going to have to put them on hold and I'll cover them during the war room coming up
[2:40:55.100 --> 2:40:59.100]  and I'll take your phone calls too. And I got great guests, but
[2:40:59.100 --> 2:41:01.100]  Nick Begich is about to take over on the fourth hour.
[2:41:01.100 --> 2:41:03.100]  This is so key though.
[2:41:03.100 --> 2:41:08.100]  Now nobody other than info wars in the media has been reporting on this.
[2:41:08.100 --> 2:41:12.100]  And it's really been.
[2:41:12.100 --> 2:41:14.100]  Well, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I could go.
[2:41:14.100 --> 2:41:19.100]  I could have the crew go back and find the shows that I did even last week
[2:41:19.100 --> 2:41:25.100]  where I dedicated entire shows and segments and titles saying this is a trial vaccine.
[2:41:25.100 --> 2:41:29.100]  This is a new technology being tested.
[2:41:29.100 --> 2:41:31.100]  And I do so many other radio hits and stuff.
[2:41:31.100 --> 2:41:36.100]  I mean, it's like I can't even keep track, but I've been parroting this.
[2:41:36.100 --> 2:41:39.100]  We're being tested on this is a global test.
[2:41:39.100 --> 2:41:46.100]  This is a planetary scale trial that you're all being engaged in right now with this.
[2:41:46.100 --> 2:41:50.100]  What they're calling a vaccine, which is actually gene therapy.
[2:41:50.100 --> 2:41:53.100]  I've been pounding the desk. I've been pulling my hair out.
[2:41:53.100 --> 2:41:56.100]  I've been trying to warn people.
[2:41:56.100 --> 2:42:00.100]  You are part of an experiment worldwide.
[2:42:00.100 --> 2:42:04.100]  You're guinea pigs in a messenger RNA experiment.
[2:42:04.100 --> 2:42:06.100]  I explain this to people when I talk to them.
[2:42:06.100 --> 2:42:09.100]  I rant and hoot and holler on air about it.
[2:42:09.100 --> 2:42:10.100]  Sounds crazy, right?
[2:42:10.100 --> 2:42:15.100]  Well, maybe if Anthony Fauci told you that, then maybe people would listen.
[2:42:15.100 --> 2:42:21.100]  So in an incredible revelation, Anthony Fauci being interviewed on some.
[2:42:21.100 --> 2:42:22.100]  I don't even know.
[2:42:22.100 --> 2:42:25.100]  Like this guy, apparently all this guy does is go on TV and radio.
[2:42:25.100 --> 2:42:30.100]  That's literally all this guy does with his big pharmaceutical talking points.
[2:42:30.100 --> 2:42:34.100]  The big pharmaceutical whore Dr. Fauci.
[2:42:34.100 --> 2:42:39.100]  For decades, he's been a big pharmaceutical whore still is.
[2:42:39.100 --> 2:42:43.100]  And so he goes on some radio show or YouTube show.
[2:42:43.100 --> 2:42:49.100]  I've never seen this or heard of the guy and the guy is actually asking him real questions.
[2:42:49.100 --> 2:42:58.100]  And Fauci admits what info wars and what I and Alex Jones and others guests that come on our shows have been screaming about ranting about
[2:42:58.100 --> 2:43:01.100]  warning dire sound the alarm.
[2:43:01.100 --> 2:43:04.100]  I mean, but see, nobody listens when info war says it.
[2:43:04.100 --> 2:43:07.100]  They just they just will freak out when 10 years later it comes true.
[2:43:07.100 --> 2:43:13.100]  But when we actually say it, it's like, I forget about it to just pass say that's just info wars breaking next year's news today.
[2:43:13.100 --> 2:43:18.100]  But we'll we'll we'll be in shock and awe in next year or 10 years when all of it comes true.
[2:43:18.100 --> 2:43:24.100]  Like, oh, so but okay, we've been warning you that this is a giant worldwide experiment.
[2:43:24.100 --> 2:43:25.100]  People didn't want to listen.
[2:43:25.100 --> 2:43:29.100]  Maybe if they hear it from Fauci, maybe then they'd listen.
[2:43:29.100 --> 2:43:32.100]  So here's Fauci on some no name podcast or something.
[2:43:32.100 --> 2:43:33.100]  I'm not trying to be insulting to the guy.
[2:43:33.100 --> 2:43:35.100]  I just don't know who it is.
[2:43:35.100 --> 2:43:39.100]  So Fauci just says interviews all day long with his big pharmaceutical talking point.
[2:43:39.100 --> 2:43:45.100]  And then he has to admit in an interview yesterday that yes, this is a worldwide experiment.
[2:43:45.100 --> 2:43:48.100]  All humans are being used like guinea pigs.
[2:43:48.100 --> 2:43:49.100]  This is not a vaccine.
[2:43:49.100 --> 2:43:51.100]  But don't take it from me.
[2:43:51.100 --> 2:43:54.100]  Don't take it from info wars who's been saying this for months.
[2:43:54.100 --> 2:43:56.100]  Here's Fauci admitting it yesterday.
[2:43:56.100 --> 2:44:03.100]  Has this kind of mRNA vaccine technology ever been injected into humans before?
[2:44:03.100 --> 2:44:09.100]  Well, this is the first time and the good news is that the results are really, really good.
[2:44:09.100 --> 2:44:10.100]  Okay.
[2:44:10.100 --> 2:44:15.100]  But in essence, this is an experimental technology.
[2:44:15.100 --> 2:44:25.100]  Well, it's a new technology and it is proven in a very large group of clinical trials to be safe and highly effective.
[2:44:25.100 --> 2:44:29.100]  Are you completely positive that this new technology is safe?
[2:44:29.100 --> 2:44:41.100]  I mean, how can we be sure there won't be long term effects when these vaccines were seemingly developed so quickly and have only been tested for months and not years?
[2:44:41.100 --> 2:44:49.100]  The speed with which it's been done is a reflection of the extraordinary advances in science.
[2:44:49.100 --> 2:44:52.100]  And there was no compromise of safety.
[2:44:52.100 --> 2:45:02.100]  But as I said before, in the history of vaccinology, you don't see effects that occur years later.
[2:45:02.100 --> 2:45:16.100]  Almost all of the bad effects as rare as they are and they are very rare occur between 15 and 45 days from the time you get vaccinated.
[2:45:16.100 --> 2:45:17.100]  Rare.
[2:45:17.100 --> 2:45:18.100]  What are you talking about rare?
[2:45:18.100 --> 2:45:22.100]  We've had thousands of deaths, tens of thousands of negative side effects.
[2:45:22.100 --> 2:45:23.100]  Even Bill Gates admits that.
[2:45:23.100 --> 2:45:29.100]  But he even lies during that because he says this is but these are this is vaccination history.
[2:45:29.100 --> 2:45:31.100]  But he admits at the beginning it's not even a vaccine.
[2:45:31.100 --> 2:45:37.100]  Now look, I'm a little overwhelmed right now.
[2:45:37.100 --> 2:45:42.100]  And so this is such bombshell news.
[2:45:42.100 --> 2:45:45.100]  It's not about being vindicated here at Info Wars.
[2:45:45.100 --> 2:45:47.100]  We know we're vindicated in everything we say.
[2:45:47.100 --> 2:45:51.100]  This is like the world needs to see this.
[2:45:51.100 --> 2:45:54.100]  So I'm like kind of pinch myself moment right now.
[2:45:54.100 --> 2:45:59.100]  In fact, guys, I need the crew to find out because I almost don't even believe that's real.
[2:45:59.100 --> 2:46:05.100]  Like that has to be a deep fake because if that's real, I mean, it should be game over for these people.
[2:46:05.100 --> 2:46:10.100]  The whole world's jaw should drop to the floor and say, what the hell?
[2:46:10.100 --> 2:46:19.100]  You just launched an experimental new technology into my body that you don't even know long term test.
[2:46:19.100 --> 2:46:20.100]  You don't know anything.
[2:46:20.100 --> 2:46:22.100]  You're admitting it's a brand new technology.
[2:46:22.100 --> 2:46:24.100]  Holy crap, Info Wars was right.
[2:46:24.100 --> 2:46:26.100]  So I'm like having a pinch myself moment right now.
[2:46:26.100 --> 2:46:28.100]  This is too bombshell to even believe.
[2:46:28.100 --> 2:46:36.100]  Guys, can we find out what podcast or radio show that was?
[2:46:36.100 --> 2:46:43.100]  He's a Mexican actor, a comedian named what now?
[2:46:43.100 --> 2:46:44.100]  Ojaniel de Bres.
[2:46:44.100 --> 2:46:45.100]  I'm probably saying that wrong.
[2:46:45.100 --> 2:46:47.100]  I just had the crew in my ear.
[2:46:47.100 --> 2:46:50.100]  Is there any way you can go on the mic and say this because I don't want to butcher it?
[2:46:50.100 --> 2:46:52.100]  I mean, so, but this is confirmed though.
[2:46:52.100 --> 2:46:53.100]  This is real.
[2:46:53.100 --> 2:46:57.100]  This is not a deep fake.
[2:46:57.100 --> 2:47:01.100]  So that's because the crew is telling me it's real.
[2:47:01.100 --> 2:47:09.100]  Again, I just found this video and I mean, I already knew it was real because I saw it and I read the response.
[2:47:09.100 --> 2:47:11.100]  But I'm like, it's like pinch myself.
[2:47:11.100 --> 2:47:13.100]  Like this is crazy, man.
[2:47:13.100 --> 2:47:18.100]  So like I need to like double triple quadruple quintuple octuple down.
[2:47:18.100 --> 2:47:19.100]  Like this is real.
[2:47:19.100 --> 2:47:25.100]  Like this Fauci just admitted everything we've been telling you for months.
[2:47:25.100 --> 2:47:26.100]  Wow.
[2:47:26.100 --> 2:47:27.100]  Wow.
[2:47:27.100 --> 2:47:28.100]  Wow.
[2:47:28.100 --> 2:47:29.100]  Wow.
[2:47:29.100 --> 2:47:30.100]  Wow.
[2:47:30.100 --> 2:47:31.100]  Wow.
[2:47:31.100 --> 2:47:32.100]  Wow.
[2:47:32.100 --> 2:47:33.100]  Wow.
[2:47:33.100 --> 2:47:34.100]  Wow.
[2:47:34.100 --> 2:47:35.100]  Wow.
[2:47:35.100 --> 2:47:36.100]  Wow.
[2:47:36.100 --> 2:47:37.100]  Wow.
[2:47:37.100 --> 2:47:45.100]  So Eugenio de Bres, Eugenio de Bres, a Mexican actor comedian gets this interview with Fauci
[2:47:45.100 --> 2:47:46.100]  somehow.
[2:47:46.100 --> 2:47:47.100]  I don't know where or what.
[2:47:47.100 --> 2:47:48.100]  Does he have a podcast?
[2:47:48.100 --> 2:47:49.100]  Does he have a TV show?
[2:47:49.100 --> 2:47:54.100]  And Fauci admits this is a new technology.
[2:47:54.100 --> 2:47:57.660]  brand new biotechnology that they're testing World Ride right now.
[2:47:57.660 --> 2:47:59.460]  They've never been long-term testing.
[2:47:59.460 --> 2:48:01.300]  They didn't even do short-term testing.
[2:48:01.300 --> 2:48:03.020]  They didn't do animal testing.
[2:48:03.020 --> 2:48:04.340]  They didn't know testing.
[2:48:04.340 --> 2:48:07.100]  They're testing it on you right now.
[2:48:07.100 --> 2:48:14.620]  And then he admits, this is unbelievable, and then he admits it's a new technology,
[2:48:14.620 --> 2:48:23.060]  so they've never had proper testing, but then when he tries to, when he tries to divert
[2:48:23.060 --> 2:48:29.580]  off of the fact it's a giant test with new technology that he admits, he then says,
[2:48:29.580 --> 2:48:35.580]  yes, but with the history of vaccinations, we know that effects really only happened
[2:48:35.580 --> 2:48:41.980]  during the first month or two, but he admits this isn't even a vaccine.
[2:48:41.980 --> 2:48:45.060]  Incredible, folks.
[2:48:45.060 --> 2:48:48.620]  Seriously, this is incredible.
[2:48:48.620 --> 2:48:54.940]  So I need that video up on Band Out Video, just a Fauci, okay?
[2:48:54.940 --> 2:48:56.780]  And you got to share this far and wide, folks.
[2:48:56.780 --> 2:48:59.620]  This is, I'm telling you, this is the end of Fauci if we make this go viral.
[2:48:59.620 --> 2:49:03.260]  This is end, this is game over of the whole fake pandemic.
[2:49:03.260 --> 2:49:05.940]  This is game over of the whole vaccine.
[2:49:05.940 --> 2:49:09.220]  People need to know you are being tested right now.
[2:49:09.220 --> 2:49:12.740]  You are part of a worldwide human experiment.
[2:49:12.740 --> 2:49:14.540]  This is a new technology.
[2:49:14.540 --> 2:49:16.420]  Fauci just admitted it all.
[2:49:16.420 --> 2:49:17.700]  He just admitted it all.
[2:49:17.700 --> 2:49:21.300]  So I need this, that video, that minute and a half video or whatever, put it on Band Out
[2:49:21.300 --> 2:49:29.580]  Video and title it Anthony Fauci admits COVID vaccine is new technology never tested before.
[2:49:29.580 --> 2:49:38.700]  Anthony Fauci admits COVID vaccine is new technology never tested before.
[2:49:38.700 --> 2:49:41.940]  And so that video will go up just that video.
[2:49:41.940 --> 2:49:43.980]  So not with my commentary or anything.
[2:49:43.980 --> 2:49:47.100]  And then we'll put up the other video with my commentary too.
[2:49:47.100 --> 2:49:51.420]  This needs to go mega absolute total viral.
[2:49:51.420 --> 2:49:53.580]  It needs to be on Tucker Carlson tonight.
[2:49:53.580 --> 2:49:56.820]  It needs to be everywhere.
[2:49:56.820 --> 2:50:06.940]  Anthony Fauci admits COVID shot is new technology being tested on humans in live time.
[2:50:06.940 --> 2:50:21.100]  Here, you know, look, I just, you know, people are like, How do you do it?
[2:50:21.100 --> 2:50:22.100]  How do you do three hours a day?
[2:50:22.100 --> 2:50:23.100]  How do you do all this?
[2:50:23.100 --> 2:50:30.660]  Folks, this is like, no, the challenge here is knowing that everything we talk about is
[2:50:30.660 --> 2:50:31.660]  true.
[2:50:31.660 --> 2:50:33.160]  That's the challenge.
[2:50:33.160 --> 2:50:36.460]  I don't care who it is.
[2:50:36.460 --> 2:50:41.340]  Anthony, play this on your TV show about admitting it's a giant experiment.
[2:50:41.340 --> 2:50:45.780]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M Full Wars and we brought you a new supplement,
[2:50:45.780 --> 2:50:49.380]  a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[2:50:49.380 --> 2:50:50.380]  It is down and out.
[2:50:50.380 --> 2:50:52.260]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[2:50:52.260 --> 2:50:55.300]  We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[2:50:55.300 --> 2:50:58.340]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[2:50:58.340 --> 2:51:00.900]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[2:51:00.900 --> 2:51:04.580]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[2:51:04.580 --> 2:51:09.580]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[2:51:09.580 --> 2:51:12.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[2:51:12.060 --> 2:51:15.260]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[2:51:15.260 --> 2:51:16.260]  It's liquid.
[2:51:16.260 --> 2:51:17.260]  So it goes right into your body fast.
[2:51:17.260 --> 2:51:21.380]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep?
[2:51:21.380 --> 2:51:22.380]  It's incredible.
[2:51:22.380 --> 2:51:24.540]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[2:51:24.540 --> 2:51:27.140]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.
[2:51:27.140 --> 2:51:32.020]  Get yours today, down and out exclusively at M Full Wars Store.com, 40% off out of the
[2:51:32.020 --> 2:51:42.740]  gates with free shipping while supplies last, down and out at FullWarsStore.com.
[2:51:42.740 --> 2:51:49.700]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[2:51:49.700 --> 2:51:51.060]  that this is all a test.
[2:51:51.060 --> 2:51:57.020]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[2:51:57.020 --> 2:52:02.300]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension, so we can decide
[2:52:02.300 --> 2:52:06.580]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to, and it really does come
[2:52:06.580 --> 2:52:07.580]  down to that.
[2:52:07.580 --> 2:52:11.660]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[2:52:11.660 --> 2:52:15.940]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[2:52:15.940 --> 2:52:19.540]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[2:52:19.540 --> 2:52:25.180]  God is the author of us having free will, and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[2:52:25.180 --> 2:52:29.340]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington,
[2:52:29.340 --> 2:52:34.700]  D.C., and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[2:52:34.700 --> 2:52:37.940]  It's all about telling you you're dirty and you're ugly and you're in the bad because
[2:52:37.940 --> 2:52:44.940]  Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[2:52:44.940 --> 2:53:01.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:53:01.820 --> 2:53:11.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Nick Baggage.
[2:53:11.620 --> 2:53:16.740]  So good to be here again on a Friday afternoon in most of the country just before noon here
[2:53:16.740 --> 2:53:18.740]  in Anchorage, Alaska.
[2:53:18.740 --> 2:53:23.940]  You know, I've not been out in a couple weeks and I do try and keep up with all the email
[2:53:23.940 --> 2:53:27.380]  traffic and that's kind of where I get my feedback from the listeners because as you
[2:53:27.380 --> 2:53:31.140]  know, I generally and I haven't taken callers and I don't plan to.
[2:53:31.140 --> 2:53:36.980]  That's the way to get to me info at earthpulse.com if you want to participate in getting me something
[2:53:36.980 --> 2:53:38.480]  to talk about.
[2:53:38.480 --> 2:53:39.980]  But don't overload me, man.
[2:53:39.980 --> 2:53:42.580]  If you got an assignment for me, don't do that.
[2:53:42.580 --> 2:53:43.580]  Don't do that.
[2:53:43.580 --> 2:53:48.300]  If you want to do that, you go upstairs first, ask that guy, he comes over, he dumps it in
[2:53:48.300 --> 2:53:50.100]  and then I get my instructions that way.
[2:53:50.100 --> 2:53:53.260]  So don't add any names to my backpack.
[2:53:53.260 --> 2:53:58.940]  But that's the way you reach out to me info at earthpulse.com and I want to take the first
[2:53:58.940 --> 2:54:03.100]  couple of minutes and I want to talk about the last feed because I have all different
[2:54:03.100 --> 2:54:04.980]  reactions from one.
[2:54:04.980 --> 2:54:08.900]  I got a few that said, oh, that guy must be on drugs to run that fast.
[2:54:08.900 --> 2:54:14.020]  And so I'll try and slow it down to reassure everyone that is not the case.
[2:54:14.020 --> 2:54:15.020]  But that was kind of funny.
[2:54:15.020 --> 2:54:18.880]  First, a little offensive, you know, but then I thought it was kind of funny because I always
[2:54:18.880 --> 2:54:21.980]  run it slow most of the time and if I pick it up, I forget.
[2:54:21.980 --> 2:54:24.940]  There's some people that just can't keep up when you're picking it up and when you're
[2:54:24.940 --> 2:54:28.620]  jamming it out and making it move and all that happens makes people nervous.
[2:54:28.620 --> 2:54:31.860]  So I'll try and slow it down, pace it out.
[2:54:31.860 --> 2:54:36.820]  But I lost the conclusion of that, which I talked about a lot of misery in my life and
[2:54:36.820 --> 2:54:38.020]  people were reacting to that.
[2:54:38.020 --> 2:54:39.020]  They didn't really get the picture.
[2:54:39.020 --> 2:54:42.140]  What I was trying to say is I wouldn't change a thing.
[2:54:42.140 --> 2:54:46.340]  All the things you know about me, I wouldn't change one breath I've ever taken this lifetime
[2:54:46.340 --> 2:54:49.020]  to be where I am right now in my life.
[2:54:49.020 --> 2:54:52.940]  All those trials, tribulations, whatever you want to call them, I would do it all again
[2:54:52.940 --> 2:54:59.540]  10,000 times to experience what in my lifetime could be characterized as a very long suffering
[2:54:59.540 --> 2:55:02.700]  starting with the disappearance of my dad at a young age.
[2:55:02.700 --> 2:55:06.100]  So I started reading pretty seriously about when I was 12.
[2:55:06.100 --> 2:55:10.460]  I'm 62 now, that's 50 years, a half a century of reading.
[2:55:10.460 --> 2:55:15.740]  These cabinets behind me, they're not empty, man.
[2:55:15.740 --> 2:55:17.180]  This is a real library.
[2:55:17.180 --> 2:55:20.020]  Somebody wrote me and asked, you know what, I said, look at all those labels, these skills
[2:55:20.020 --> 2:55:21.020]  and books from the library.
[2:55:21.020 --> 2:55:22.540]  No, I don't.
[2:55:22.540 --> 2:55:27.700]  I have a library in my house and I have to keep track of what's where when I put it
[2:55:27.700 --> 2:55:30.340]  all back because I like to use it as a reference library.
[2:55:30.340 --> 2:55:35.580]  So I got about 10% of the books I read in my library, a little over 1,500.
[2:55:35.580 --> 2:55:41.300]  I think maybe 10,000, 15,000, pretty good number across many disciplines, many platforms
[2:55:41.300 --> 2:55:48.860]  from let's see psychology, sociology, anthropology, archeology, economics, political science,
[2:55:48.860 --> 2:55:55.580]  government, how about Alaska history, national history, international history, philosophy,
[2:55:55.580 --> 2:55:59.220]  the occult, all of the religious traditions that there are that I can find maybe a hundred
[2:55:59.220 --> 2:56:00.220]  or so.
[2:56:00.220 --> 2:56:04.660]  Over the backdrop of a lifetime and 50,000 hours of conversation with some of the most
[2:56:04.660 --> 2:56:08.100]  interesting people in the world from waitresses who are lit up and know what's really going
[2:56:08.100 --> 2:56:09.100]  on.
[2:56:09.100 --> 2:56:14.180]  But a lot of the CEOs I know don't have a clue about all the way up to vice presidents,
[2:56:14.180 --> 2:56:20.420]  president, senators, congressmen, economists, Nobel Prize winners across the sciences, a
[2:56:20.420 --> 2:56:21.420]  whole bunch.
[2:56:21.420 --> 2:56:23.620]  So I talked fast because there are a lot in here.
[2:56:23.620 --> 2:56:24.620]  I never get it out.
[2:56:24.620 --> 2:56:28.340]  It's always frustrating when you don't have a way to get it out.
[2:56:28.340 --> 2:56:32.340]  So I'm setting up for a 10 hour continuous feed uninterrupted.
[2:56:32.340 --> 2:56:37.900]  So once and for all 50 years comes in in a coherent way, starting with the human being,
[2:56:37.900 --> 2:56:42.100]  us, the starting point, you and I.
[2:56:42.100 --> 2:56:46.460]  And the message is how to wake up to this awakening.
[2:56:46.460 --> 2:56:49.260]  What are the keys to creation?
[2:56:49.260 --> 2:56:54.980]  What is it that lights Dr. Nick up and gets the game going?
[2:56:54.980 --> 2:56:57.900]  Because you are the spark of life.
[2:56:57.900 --> 2:57:01.140]  You are the flame within that spark.
[2:57:01.140 --> 2:57:02.500]  Wake up.
[2:57:02.500 --> 2:57:06.500]  It's five minutes to midnight, folks.
[2:57:06.500 --> 2:57:15.500]  It's time for a rumble to be felt within the earth where we rise into who we are as individuals.
[2:57:15.500 --> 2:57:25.460]  We project that into the world in a different way on a platform of love.
[2:57:25.460 --> 2:57:30.700]  Something soft that can touch us, that can change us, that can activate the living soul
[2:57:30.700 --> 2:57:32.740]  that we are as individuals.
[2:57:32.740 --> 2:57:35.300]  And the message today is the beginning of that.
[2:57:35.300 --> 2:57:36.300]  How do we do that?
[2:57:36.300 --> 2:57:44.500]  How do we change hate and anger into the peace where the humble inherit this earth?
[2:57:44.500 --> 2:57:50.500]  We'll be right back after these messages.
[2:57:50.500 --> 2:57:53.660]  This is Greg Rees from infowars.com.
[2:57:53.660 --> 2:57:57.820]  I have many reasons to be grateful for working at Infowars.
[2:57:57.820 --> 2:58:02.660]  One of them is that we support ourselves with great products that promote physical health
[2:58:02.660 --> 2:58:03.660]  and vitality.
[2:58:03.660 --> 2:58:10.820]  I have been using health supplements for years, and I have found our products at infowars.com
[2:58:10.820 --> 2:58:16.020]  to be the best, especially our vitamin mineral fusion.
[2:58:16.020 --> 2:58:21.100]  Before trying vitamin mineral fusion, I always questioned if vitamin supplements ever actually
[2:58:21.100 --> 2:58:22.100]  did anything.
[2:58:22.100 --> 2:58:25.980]  I never felt much of an effect from other products.
[2:58:25.980 --> 2:58:30.860]  But I felt vitamin mineral fusion the first time I took it, immediately.
[2:58:30.860 --> 2:58:32.900]  I love how it dissolves in water.
[2:58:32.900 --> 2:58:34.820]  I take it every day with my supper.
[2:58:34.820 --> 2:58:40.220]  It tastes great, feels great, and right now it's 50% off.
[2:58:40.220 --> 2:58:47.100]  It sells out fast, so stock up now at 50% off at infowarsstore.com.
[2:58:47.100 --> 2:58:56.780]  Vitamin mineral fusion at infowarsstore.com.
[2:58:56.780 --> 2:59:06.220]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones, and now your host, Nick
[2:59:06.220 --> 2:59:07.220]  Baggage.
[2:59:07.220 --> 2:59:15.860]  All right, now we calm it down a bit, because I want to get your attention.
[2:59:15.860 --> 2:59:21.860]  I want to hold it for this hour, and I'd like you to think about what's being said.
[2:59:21.860 --> 2:59:23.940]  And I know that's a lot of energy, right?
[2:59:23.940 --> 2:59:27.700]  That's a lot of energy you saw Dr. Nicholas.
[2:59:27.700 --> 2:59:30.740]  Why is that energy focused in that way?
[2:59:30.740 --> 2:59:34.620]  Because you can control the energy, so you have the effect, which is to get people's
[2:59:34.620 --> 2:59:35.620]  attention.
[2:59:35.620 --> 2:59:36.620]  I want your attention.
[2:59:36.620 --> 2:59:37.620]  I want you to hear what I'm going to say.
[2:59:37.620 --> 2:59:38.620]  I think it's important.
[2:59:38.620 --> 2:59:39.620]  It's not about me.
[2:59:39.620 --> 2:59:40.620]  It's about you.
[2:59:40.620 --> 2:59:45.820]  And I go into this program, I start my day singing in the spirit, it's a concept some
[2:59:45.820 --> 2:59:48.700]  people understand, others don't have a clue.
[2:59:48.700 --> 2:59:52.780]  I do some things in my prayer life in the morning, I spend about an hour in it.
[2:59:52.780 --> 2:59:57.420]  I'm not going to get into the details of that today, because that's between me and God and
[2:59:57.420 --> 3:00:00.660]  what I believe the Creator is, and I'm not getting into brand names, I'm not getting
[3:00:00.660 --> 3:00:01.660]  into any of that.
[3:00:01.660 --> 3:00:06.620]  Because I think the most important thing right now is when we look at the world and
[3:00:06.620 --> 3:00:11.340]  we see the chaos in it, is we can choose some things about how we project ourselves into
[3:00:11.340 --> 3:00:15.020]  that world, and whether we're going to be the victims of it, or whether we're going
[3:00:15.020 --> 3:00:17.900]  to begin to become the controllers of our lives.
[3:00:17.900 --> 3:00:24.260]  Now, I spent 30 years of the 50 becoming a subject matter expert in the area of mind
[3:00:24.260 --> 3:00:25.260]  control.
[3:00:25.260 --> 3:00:31.420]  I probably know it better than most, and I certainly know everyone in the game, and
[3:00:31.420 --> 3:00:35.940]  I know a few of the people on the wrong side of that game, but what I do know is the knowledge
[3:00:35.940 --> 3:00:40.100]  that's been built has been built over not centuries, not decades, but a couple thousand
[3:00:40.100 --> 3:00:42.300]  years, perhaps even earlier.
[3:00:42.300 --> 3:00:44.860]  The knowledge comes from deep areas of thought.
[3:00:44.860 --> 3:00:49.180]  I've looked into those areas, they're in this library, some of it, what I've kept, but
[3:00:49.180 --> 3:00:53.140]  I've been able to keep through two bankruptcies and a bunch of other things, which don't take
[3:00:53.140 --> 3:00:58.660]  that as complaint, because my torment or my greatest lessons, they gave me the ability
[3:00:58.660 --> 3:01:03.740]  to know what I can do and how to stand through things that others probably couldn't.
[3:01:03.740 --> 3:01:07.540]  I was gifted with the ability to take all that information and condense it, and the
[3:01:07.540 --> 3:01:12.220]  brain God gave me, to be able to project it out in a way that's coherent, and people
[3:01:12.220 --> 3:01:13.220]  know me as an educator.
[3:01:13.220 --> 3:01:17.380]  They know me in a lot of different brains, but nobody knows me as me and the broader
[3:01:17.380 --> 3:01:22.180]  sense of what I've been doing, and that brings the knowledge into where I am, so I'm getting
[3:01:22.180 --> 3:01:25.460]  ready to do a 10-hour straight fees, going to go out on YouTube, it's going to happen
[3:01:25.460 --> 3:01:30.100]  April Fool's Day, it's going to start at 8 a.m. my time here in Anchorage, Alaska, when
[3:01:30.100 --> 3:01:33.340]  I'm going to start with, is a lot of the principles I've been talking about, a lot
[3:01:33.340 --> 3:01:38.820]  of the science, all of the things that deal with the mechanical real world, the problems
[3:01:38.820 --> 3:01:41.820]  of the world, how do we solve them, what are those solutions.
[3:01:41.820 --> 3:01:45.900]  So I'm going to start first talking about who we are as individuals, not in the context
[3:01:45.900 --> 3:01:52.900]  of religion or any of that, but in the context of what I know, and I don't want you to believe
[3:01:52.900 --> 3:01:58.700]  anything except this, that my mission in that is to do one thing, is to cause people to
[3:01:58.700 --> 3:02:05.620]  look inside themselves, you, to look inside yourself, and have a way of kind of exploring
[3:02:05.620 --> 3:02:10.700]  what's there, activating what's there, shedding a lot of guilt that shouldn't be there at
[3:02:10.700 --> 3:02:15.780]  this point, but needs to modulate your behaviors perhaps, but those are all your choices individually
[3:02:15.780 --> 3:02:16.780]  for sure.
[3:02:16.780 --> 3:02:23.220]  What I want to do in a soft and gentle way is explain some of the keys to unlock that
[3:02:23.220 --> 3:02:28.620]  door into yourself a bit, so you can make that exploration, reconnect with what I believe
[3:02:28.620 --> 3:02:34.940]  and many physicists believe, with consciousness, or what others call the spark of life, or
[3:02:34.940 --> 3:02:38.140]  what you might call the breath of life, or you might give a million different names,
[3:02:38.140 --> 3:02:40.740]  or you might say, you're soul even.
[3:02:40.740 --> 3:02:47.020]  So I want to help people learn some things to turn inward, ask that question, someone
[3:02:47.020 --> 3:02:52.700]  that I'll deliver that in a coherent way, not in some telegraphed way through the internet,
[3:02:52.700 --> 3:02:56.180]  in abbreviated form, so I'm going to bring you into that conversation, what we're going
[3:02:56.180 --> 3:03:03.060]  to do today, and what I want to teach today that are practical to take all of this energy
[3:03:03.060 --> 3:03:06.740]  that I could blow out as anger, you can see that, and it'd be totally acceptable on this
[3:03:06.740 --> 3:03:11.620]  platform, and everyone would be fine with that, but that is not who I am, but I do have
[3:03:11.620 --> 3:03:16.340]  power in my voice, and you saw it as we closed out of that last segment, but it's me who
[3:03:16.340 --> 3:03:22.500]  controls the power of my voice, it's not my voice that controls me, and this is the power
[3:03:22.500 --> 3:03:28.700]  of self-control that builds into us the ability to amplify out of us the full energy that
[3:03:28.700 --> 3:03:34.420]  we were created to be, which means our gifts come into play, the gifts that we know we
[3:03:34.420 --> 3:03:40.020]  have, and we find ways to bring those forward in our lives as we lift each day, as we begin
[3:03:40.020 --> 3:03:45.980]  to move the creative essence of what we are into the reality that we project and create
[3:03:45.980 --> 3:03:49.620]  in the actions that we engage, all of which are choices.
[3:03:49.620 --> 3:03:54.020]  So what I'd like to teach in this 10 hours, and I say 10 because that's what I know my
[3:03:54.020 --> 3:03:59.180]  voice can do, but I'll go until I'm done, and so it'll be recorded where you can get
[3:03:59.180 --> 3:04:02.860]  it, it'll be free access to everyone in the world, you can do whatever you want, and what
[3:04:02.860 --> 3:04:08.140]  I want is just two responses that will help me today decide what I do on this platform.
[3:04:08.140 --> 3:04:13.420]  I need one of two things, send to me at infoetearthbolse.com.
[3:04:13.420 --> 3:04:17.740]  I want neither a thank you, which is a message, keep doing what you're doing, Nick, or I want
[3:04:17.740 --> 3:04:22.100]  an FU that says, Nick, we don't want to hear it anymore, find a new platform.
[3:04:22.100 --> 3:04:25.620]  I want to know what you think, because if you do either one, I'm going to be happy because
[3:04:25.620 --> 3:04:28.820]  then you're not sitting on the bench just warming it, doing nothing.
[3:04:28.820 --> 3:04:33.500]  You've at least registered something you say, I don't want to hear it, fine, I want to know
[3:04:33.500 --> 3:04:34.500]  it.
[3:04:34.500 --> 3:04:38.860]  I want to hear it, fine, I want to know that too, but either way I win, because my only
[3:04:38.860 --> 3:04:45.740]  purpose has always been to wake people up, to have an opinion, but based on an inward
[3:04:45.740 --> 3:04:50.980]  look first, please, at least do that, not for me, do that for you.
[3:04:50.980 --> 3:04:53.820]  I'd like to give the keys to that as we go through this hour.
[3:04:53.820 --> 3:04:57.940]  Some of the beginning ones I'll talk to you about today, you'll get the rest later, but
[3:04:57.940 --> 3:05:01.380]  instead of starting with all the issues of the day, I'm going to start with man.
[3:05:01.380 --> 3:05:05.340]  I'm going to start at the end, which should be the beginning of the story.
[3:05:05.340 --> 3:05:11.220]  How do we activate our minds being the subject matter expert in that?
[3:05:11.220 --> 3:05:15.780]  I know that to do that, to interfere with what you think, what you believe, what you
[3:05:15.780 --> 3:05:22.760]  feel is the grossest violation that anyone can make against another living soul.
[3:05:22.760 --> 3:05:28.820]  The only one that judges a living soul is you judge your performance against yourself
[3:05:28.820 --> 3:05:34.500]  and your standard of ethics, map values, all of the things that drive you that you do.
[3:05:34.500 --> 3:05:37.380]  You know when you're right, you know when you're wrong, you hear it inside, every human
[3:05:37.380 --> 3:05:39.180]  being has that.
[3:05:39.180 --> 3:05:43.580]  So you listen out is your choice, how you listen is also your choice, but the train
[3:05:43.580 --> 3:05:49.620]  wrecks that become our lives are based on those choices.
[3:05:49.620 --> 3:05:56.020]  And when we think about all of this as we move into this next phase of what's happening
[3:05:56.020 --> 3:06:06.420]  in our world, we need to draw down now a different way of seeing that allows us to be calm when
[3:06:06.420 --> 3:06:12.420]  everything around us is falling apart, calm in the middle of the storm, the peace in the
[3:06:12.420 --> 3:06:17.020]  middle of the moment, the breath that flows through us as a breath of creation itself
[3:06:17.020 --> 3:06:19.140]  as a trigger to consciousness.
[3:06:19.140 --> 3:06:20.780]  This is what it's about.
[3:06:20.780 --> 3:06:22.580]  I don't read from teleprompters.
[3:06:22.580 --> 3:06:28.780]  I can go from comedy to poetry to loud to slow because the vehicle serves me.
[3:06:28.780 --> 3:06:33.500]  This body serves me and my awareness and I want to be aware.
[3:06:33.500 --> 3:06:38.180]  I want to be functioning within the creation as a co-creator with my conception of what
[3:06:38.180 --> 3:06:39.780]  creation is.
[3:06:39.780 --> 3:06:47.460]  My hope is that the words I give today will assist you in finding a way to activate yourself
[3:06:47.460 --> 3:06:50.260]  to be who you are, not who anyone else is.
[3:06:50.260 --> 3:06:57.620]  And to be that person, to be that person that doesn't rip themselves to shreds and self-condemnation.
[3:06:57.620 --> 3:06:59.140]  I want to teach how not to do that.
[3:06:59.140 --> 3:07:05.100]  I want to teach ways to help learn from our mistakes, elevate ourselves out of them in
[3:07:05.100 --> 3:07:06.940]  a way that always lifts.
[3:07:06.940 --> 3:07:12.900]  And we get out of this drag thing where we feed the beast, our anger, our frustrations
[3:07:12.900 --> 3:07:14.860]  as we kick that out there.
[3:07:14.860 --> 3:07:20.340]  I'll teach you if you'll listen long enough of how that feeds the beast and we create
[3:07:20.340 --> 3:07:25.740]  a reality, a hell on earth by feeding the beast with emotions or power.
[3:07:25.740 --> 3:07:30.820]  It is the power of the occult draws it out of you when they can pull that out of you.
[3:07:30.820 --> 3:07:35.060]  I went through an exercise, maybe we'll have time to talk about it, where I brought a house
[3:07:35.060 --> 3:07:38.420]  guest into my home and I don't get angry.
[3:07:38.420 --> 3:07:39.420]  I don't.
[3:07:39.420 --> 3:07:42.340]  Alex asked me one time over dinner, how often do you get angry?
[3:07:42.340 --> 3:07:48.340]  Nick, I said, you know, Alex maybe once in a decade, every 10 years at most, I mean what
[3:07:48.340 --> 3:07:49.980]  I'd call anger.
[3:07:49.980 --> 3:07:55.980]  The man in my home for a week, in my entire life of 62 years in that week, I had more
[3:07:55.980 --> 3:08:01.900]  anger in that week come through me than I had in the whole compilation of my lifetime.
[3:08:01.900 --> 3:08:06.060]  And I would go from anger to dropping to my knees, turn my back on that situation, drop
[3:08:06.060 --> 3:08:10.660]  to my knees and pray for forgiveness in the moment and understand that anger so that I
[3:08:10.660 --> 3:08:14.020]  would be able to understand it and not do that.
[3:08:14.020 --> 3:08:19.820]  Because sometimes you need the anger to wake up, I understand that's how it goes.
[3:08:19.820 --> 3:08:24.340]  So many people need that projection out of them, someone else needs to carry that anger.
[3:08:24.340 --> 3:08:28.860]  So that's a lot of info wars is carrying other people's anger, so you don't have to, so we
[3:08:28.860 --> 3:08:30.340]  don't have to do it.
[3:08:30.340 --> 3:08:36.380]  Let's lift, let's lift, let's transmute the anger into our own transfiguration, our own
[3:08:36.380 --> 3:08:42.340]  transformation as we move in to this next decade and where we live and where we live
[3:08:42.340 --> 3:08:44.460]  will be the way we live in life.
[3:08:44.460 --> 3:08:46.020]  I'll be right back.
[3:08:46.020 --> 3:08:55.620]  My enemies are your enemies, they're the globalists, they're the starmasks, they're a consortium
[3:08:55.620 --> 3:09:01.060]  of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers, vampires wherever you want
[3:09:01.060 --> 3:09:07.940]  to call them that are highly predatory and are setting up a false famously land system
[3:09:07.940 --> 3:09:14.980]  of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs and electromagnetic radiation to change the
[3:09:14.980 --> 3:09:21.660]  very DNA of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn
[3:09:21.660 --> 3:09:23.660]  on a chessboard.
[3:09:23.660 --> 3:09:28.700]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God and the news is only going
[3:09:28.700 --> 3:09:30.980]  to tighten around our necks from year on out.
[3:09:30.980 --> 3:09:34.980]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news and want to
[3:09:34.980 --> 3:09:38.740]  only cover limited amounts of what's happening with New World Order but at the end of the
[3:09:38.740 --> 3:09:42.100]  day it's all about the population, it's all about world government, it's all about the
[3:09:42.100 --> 3:09:46.660]  end of the human system as we know it and all its ashes and nightmare being built only
[3:09:46.660 --> 3:09:49.140]  admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[3:09:49.140 --> 3:09:54.260]  Listeners ask me all the time why do you have multiple multivitamins, why do you have multiple
[3:09:54.260 --> 3:09:56.500]  high quality iodine, why do you do that?
[3:09:56.500 --> 3:10:00.580]  Because different strokes for different folks, if we're talking to researchers and scientists
[3:10:00.580 --> 3:10:05.060]  and they say hey a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine but you should
[3:10:05.060 --> 3:10:08.820]  put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't
[3:10:08.820 --> 3:10:10.220]  absorb pure iodine.
[3:10:10.220 --> 3:10:13.980]  Boom, we did it, it's popular, it's X3, is it better than X2?
[3:10:13.980 --> 3:10:16.100]  You decide, it's different strokes for different folks.
[3:10:16.100 --> 3:10:21.860]  Well now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping and
[3:10:21.860 --> 3:10:27.140]  that is down and out, it's super strong, way stronger than knocked out but they don't compete
[3:10:27.140 --> 3:10:32.140]  with each other, different strokes for different folks, different formulas and it's 40% off
[3:10:32.140 --> 3:10:35.380]  out of the gates at m4store.com and free shipping.
[3:10:35.380 --> 3:10:38.220]  Secure your down and out today and while you're sleeping you know you're funding the
[3:10:38.220 --> 3:10:43.180]  m4 at the same time, down and out exclusively available at m4store.com for 40% off and for
[3:10:43.180 --> 3:10:52.820]  shipping.
[3:10:52.820 --> 3:11:09.740]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:09.740 --> 3:11:17.620]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind with Nick Begich.
[3:11:17.620 --> 3:11:25.540]  All right, stay on then during the breaks please.
[3:11:25.540 --> 3:11:30.380]  All right, we're back, I'm glad to be here, a couple things just to lighten it up for
[3:11:30.380 --> 3:11:31.380]  just a minute.
[3:11:31.380 --> 3:11:38.060]  I've been saving this, I didn't have a chance to show it earlier, this is February 24, 2021,
[3:11:38.060 --> 3:11:42.980]  Sunday front page or not front page but back there at 810 but it's a nice article, great
[3:11:42.980 --> 3:11:47.020]  promo for the team man, you even make the anchorage papers.
[3:11:47.020 --> 3:11:51.780]  It's a nasty article but hey as my dad used to say the only bad presence of obituary and
[3:11:51.780 --> 3:11:57.340]  only if it's yours otherwise call it a half a page of free publicity for the info warriors
[3:11:57.340 --> 3:11:58.340]  in Alaska.
[3:11:58.340 --> 3:11:59.340]  Three cheers.
[3:11:59.340 --> 3:12:04.260]  Hey and if you're in Alaska and you're around you want to give me a hand from time to time
[3:12:04.260 --> 3:12:10.460]  send me a note at info.earthbolts.com so I know you're around and you're breathing.
[3:12:10.460 --> 3:12:14.900]  Anyway and if you run into me on the street and you see me smiling at least at me on the
[3:12:14.900 --> 3:12:18.180]  shoulder and say hello, I'll say hello back and maybe stand around and talk to you for
[3:12:18.180 --> 3:12:19.180]  a few minutes.
[3:12:19.180 --> 3:12:23.940]  I enjoy doing that actually and I'm thinking about doing like a road trip where I stop
[3:12:23.940 --> 3:12:28.780]  in different towns and arrange so I'm in a park and everybody knows it and drop by and
[3:12:28.780 --> 3:12:32.900]  pay me a visit and have a chit chat so I'm going to do that, I'm going to do that coming
[3:12:32.900 --> 3:12:37.660]  up as we get into more spring and more summer and more of the next chapter in my life and
[3:12:37.660 --> 3:12:41.020]  you'll find out what that chapter looks like later but I'm going to get into the teaching
[3:12:41.020 --> 3:12:45.180]  of the day and this deal is called love and relationships and I haven't figured that out
[3:12:45.180 --> 3:12:46.180]  from the front end.
[3:12:46.180 --> 3:12:48.900]  You'll figure it out by the back end but if you go back and look at it it will all make
[3:12:48.900 --> 3:12:49.900]  sense.
[3:12:49.900 --> 3:12:51.340]  So what is that about?
[3:12:51.340 --> 3:12:53.820]  Time is space, right?
[3:12:53.820 --> 3:12:54.820]  Relationships.
[3:12:54.820 --> 3:12:58.020]  They take time and they take up space, you know I got a house that's just me in it.
[3:12:58.020 --> 3:13:02.700]  As soon as I put someone else in it, you know, you got to collapse your programming and expand
[3:13:02.700 --> 3:13:03.700]  their urge.
[3:13:03.700 --> 3:13:07.340]  That gets uncomfortable in most relationships when they merge and all of you are laughing
[3:13:07.340 --> 3:13:10.980]  a little bit now as you think about that through the trajectory of your past life,
[3:13:10.980 --> 3:13:15.420]  experience on this planet as you've lived it and it's a funny thought when you think
[3:13:15.420 --> 3:13:19.740]  about it that way but it's the truth so you've got to provide space and that creates tension
[3:13:19.740 --> 3:13:23.940]  and that creates friction and as union comes together within relationships, those things
[3:13:23.940 --> 3:13:28.180]  smooth out or you get a bigger house or some people get two houses and that works out good,
[3:13:28.180 --> 3:13:33.580]  they visit each other, have all kinds of configurations these days, hey, guess what?
[3:13:33.580 --> 3:13:38.340]  If it works for you and it works for your union and it makes you guys happy and it supports
[3:13:38.340 --> 3:13:44.140]  your value system, raw, raw, do it like you, not like anyone else, not the place to start
[3:13:44.140 --> 3:13:48.620]  the conversation about being like you is there, hey, what kind of relationships do you want?
[3:13:48.620 --> 3:13:52.620]  For me, it's the most important thing I have besides time because without time I can't
[3:13:52.620 --> 3:13:57.260]  even have one of those, you know, because I'm gone, at least not in this trajectory.
[3:13:57.260 --> 3:14:00.700]  Now we can talk about the multiverse or however you want to roll it out.
[3:14:00.700 --> 3:14:03.980]  I've got those books on the shelf and some of the best physicists in the world will discuss
[3:14:03.980 --> 3:14:09.820]  them in the course of review for 10 hours as we roll through the trajectory.
[3:14:09.820 --> 3:14:14.180]  So what I try and do is take the science, bring it into the practicality, put it in
[3:14:14.180 --> 3:14:18.100]  your life in a way that you might say, wow, that's kind of an interesting thing, but I
[3:14:18.100 --> 3:14:22.460]  think about that, maybe I do a bit differently and that's your choices.
[3:14:22.460 --> 3:14:27.620]  So time and space, spending time with relationship is how you build them.
[3:14:27.620 --> 3:14:31.060]  So the quality of those relationships is all about that.
[3:14:31.060 --> 3:14:35.780]  For instance, at work you have a certain quality based on a lot of time there, or you might
[3:14:35.780 --> 3:14:41.420]  do remote work like me where I dial in and dial out, no time in between, yeah, it's okay
[3:14:41.420 --> 3:14:45.180]  for getting the job done, but it doesn't build the kind of relationships that could lift
[3:14:45.180 --> 3:14:46.180]  it maybe a little higher.
[3:14:46.180 --> 3:14:51.340]  So I drop into Austin about once a year for a week and work on that a bit, but there's
[3:14:51.340 --> 3:14:56.340]  not any in between, everyone's too busy, everyone in everyone's life is busy.
[3:14:56.340 --> 3:15:01.180]  So what I'd like people to do is don't spend time chasing the other guy's trajectory,
[3:15:01.180 --> 3:15:07.100]  turn in a little bit and dial up your own, start providing some time first for your family,
[3:15:07.100 --> 3:15:11.300]  then for your friends, and then the things that make your living, obviously, and then
[3:15:11.300 --> 3:15:13.420]  you might have something to share with the world.
[3:15:13.420 --> 3:15:18.900]  Make sure all of these run smooth, or there's at least cooperation when it starts to be
[3:15:18.900 --> 3:15:25.540]  made, so everyone's on the same or path as it comes, and it keeps calm in those relationships.
[3:15:25.540 --> 3:15:27.420]  So time is important.
[3:15:27.420 --> 3:15:31.620]  Think about that in the context of how you organize your life and always tie it to your
[3:15:31.620 --> 3:15:34.620]  own temple, which is your body, your physical form.
[3:15:34.620 --> 3:15:39.380]  If 10% of your life to yourself, it is not selfish to do this.
[3:15:39.380 --> 3:15:44.060]  It is necessary in order to be a fully functioning human being.
[3:15:44.060 --> 3:15:50.020]  Key one for the day, save 10% for the temple that is you, honor yourself, honor your body
[3:15:50.020 --> 3:15:55.140]  that God gave you, however you picture that, or nature gave you, however you picture that.
[3:15:55.140 --> 3:15:59.340]  Just say it's consciousness gave it to you, okay, I'll buy into that for the moment, because
[3:15:59.340 --> 3:16:01.100]  that's good for the conversation.
[3:16:01.100 --> 3:16:05.140]  Doesn't alienate anybody because they were bad advertisers for their religion, whatever
[3:16:05.140 --> 3:16:06.140]  that was.
[3:16:06.140 --> 3:16:09.540]  There are a bunch of bad advertisers floating around the world today, and you've all met
[3:16:09.540 --> 3:16:11.020]  them, tripped over, and they tripped over.
[3:16:11.020 --> 3:16:14.760]  You want to shove something down your throat or pack something in where the sun don't shy
[3:16:14.760 --> 3:16:15.760]  from the other end.
[3:16:15.760 --> 3:16:18.740]  They hope it compresses the middle and something else works out of your heart, doesn't work
[3:16:18.740 --> 3:16:19.740]  that way.
[3:16:19.740 --> 3:16:23.060]  But anyway, to look at it, see, I can be a comedian too.
[3:16:23.060 --> 3:16:29.420]  But I just want to keep your attention on the message, which is, time is important than
[3:16:29.420 --> 3:16:33.300]  being there, which is space, you need to be together in you.
[3:16:33.300 --> 3:16:38.300]  So relationships are the friendships, your marriages, your brotherhoods, and often it's
[3:16:38.300 --> 3:16:42.420]  your friendships that are deeper relationships than your biological connections.
[3:16:42.420 --> 3:16:44.100]  In my life, that's happened.
[3:16:44.100 --> 3:16:46.620]  I want to also see something within this.
[3:16:46.620 --> 3:16:48.900]  I feel a lot of love from this audience all the time.
[3:16:48.900 --> 3:16:53.180]  And when people hear about something going on in my life, I know there's people praying,
[3:16:53.180 --> 3:16:55.860]  dialing into the prayer screen that's running 24-7.
[3:16:55.860 --> 3:16:56.860]  They know how to do it.
[3:16:56.860 --> 3:16:57.860]  So do I.
[3:16:57.860 --> 3:16:58.860]  I want to teach more about that.
[3:16:58.860 --> 3:17:02.340]  I want to tell you the things I said about my family and the state of my daughters not
[3:17:02.340 --> 3:17:03.340]  dealing with me.
[3:17:03.340 --> 3:17:04.720]  They're still not talking to me.
[3:17:04.720 --> 3:17:10.380]  But in the course of the anger in my living room for a week, I learned a lot about myself.
[3:17:10.380 --> 3:17:13.780]  Had opportunities to present themselves within the context of all this, to learn a great
[3:17:13.780 --> 3:17:19.460]  deal about my last daughter I'm raising at home who amazed me in what I learned.
[3:17:19.460 --> 3:17:25.820]  And what it did is triggered the settlement of a lot of anger that was built over 25 years
[3:17:25.820 --> 3:17:27.220]  of my last marriage.
[3:17:27.220 --> 3:17:33.660]  It was cured in healing with my former spouse that lifts her, lifts me, and lifts our children
[3:17:33.660 --> 3:17:36.580]  up, whether they're talking to me or not.
[3:17:36.580 --> 3:17:40.140]  And I want to thank those of you that prayed for that, because you gave me that.
[3:17:40.140 --> 3:17:43.700]  And that was the greatest gift I got from that day.
[3:17:43.700 --> 3:17:45.540]  And I thank you for it.
[3:17:45.540 --> 3:17:48.780]  And the man who came in my house and provoked my anger, I made her to study.
[3:17:48.780 --> 3:17:53.740]  I pulled the books, study what provoked anger means, and dealt with that in a way that will
[3:17:53.740 --> 3:17:58.860]  calm me and use a greater, deeper understanding of that that I can share.
[3:17:58.860 --> 3:18:00.740]  And so I'll be sharing that as I drift along.
[3:18:00.740 --> 3:18:06.060]  And I've also talked about this idea of lift and drag, key number two for the day.
[3:18:06.060 --> 3:18:10.420]  Well, perhaps this is three, the one on managing anger, I think it's in there.
[3:18:10.420 --> 3:18:14.460]  I'll define that more as we go on.
[3:18:14.460 --> 3:18:16.340]  I have a lot to say.
[3:18:16.340 --> 3:18:20.860]  I'm going to try and talk long enough, so it blows that 10 hours right out the door
[3:18:20.860 --> 3:18:26.220]  and you hear the longest, smooth oratory from anyone you've ever heard in your life.
[3:18:26.220 --> 3:18:27.220]  It'll be poetry.
[3:18:27.220 --> 3:18:28.220]  It'll be humor.
[3:18:28.220 --> 3:18:33.140]  It'll be the whole context of who I am, and it will teach you how to lift in your life
[3:18:33.140 --> 3:18:39.900]  every day, not mine, yours, how to lift and not drag, how to flow and not be crushed,
[3:18:39.900 --> 3:18:44.280]  how to move your energy into the world as a person you were created to be and the expression
[3:18:44.280 --> 3:18:50.380]  of who you are as a you that you are, as God intended you to be as you are, to project
[3:18:50.380 --> 3:18:53.980]  into the changes of the earth that are in front of you every day.
[3:18:53.980 --> 3:18:54.980]  I'll teach.
[3:18:54.980 --> 3:18:56.580]  I'll provide the information.
[3:18:56.580 --> 3:18:58.380]  These are just the beginning of those keys.
[3:18:58.380 --> 3:19:00.100]  I have a few more for the day.
[3:19:00.100 --> 3:19:03.300]  I don't know how much time we're going to get, but I want to not lose sight of a couple
[3:19:03.300 --> 3:19:04.300]  of things.
[3:19:04.300 --> 3:19:08.020]  So as you come into that segment, we'll light right into that because I want to make sure
[3:19:08.020 --> 3:19:11.660]  I tell you how to dial in all that, how you can help me make that happen.
[3:19:11.660 --> 3:19:14.460]  So Dr. Nick Begas has a lot more to say.
[3:19:14.460 --> 3:19:15.460]  Lift and drag.
[3:19:15.460 --> 3:19:16.460]  Let's get into that.
[3:19:16.460 --> 3:19:18.700]  Drag can be characterized as anything negative.
[3:19:18.700 --> 3:19:19.700]  Negative is easy to do.
[3:19:19.700 --> 3:19:21.380]  You define it yourself.
[3:19:21.380 --> 3:19:23.540]  Try and catch yourself when you're in the drag mode.
[3:19:23.540 --> 3:19:24.540]  Just notice it.
[3:19:24.540 --> 3:19:27.100]  As soon as you notice it, you gain control over it.
[3:19:27.100 --> 3:19:28.780]  This is key four.
[3:19:28.780 --> 3:19:33.540]  Notice when you're dragging and just decide not to in the moment just take a breath and
[3:19:33.540 --> 3:19:37.420]  I'll teach you what to do with that breath once you get it back and how to turn that
[3:19:37.420 --> 3:19:42.140]  anger into something that solves, lifts and does not hurt anyone.
[3:19:42.140 --> 3:19:43.860]  This is Dr. Nick Begas.
[3:19:43.860 --> 3:19:48.660]  Keys are yours to have.
[3:19:48.660 --> 3:19:53.660]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:19:53.660 --> 3:19:59.900]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support
[3:19:59.900 --> 3:20:04.180]  and for word of mouth and then we're all in this together and you know, it gets old having
[3:20:04.180 --> 3:20:07.860]  the company and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:20:07.860 --> 3:20:11.300]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[3:20:11.300 --> 3:20:15.940]  at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and
[3:20:15.940 --> 3:20:17.220]  almost shut down everybody else.
[3:20:17.220 --> 3:20:21.500]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order
[3:20:21.500 --> 3:20:24.380]  comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[3:20:24.380 --> 3:20:25.900]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:20:25.900 --> 3:20:28.020]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:20:28.020 --> 3:20:32.420]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi free.
[3:20:32.420 --> 3:20:36.380]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's
[3:20:36.380 --> 3:20:37.380]  about to unfold.
[3:20:37.380 --> 3:20:39.700]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:20:39.700 --> 3:20:44.700]  So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements
[3:20:44.700 --> 3:20:45.700]  and so much more.
[3:20:45.700 --> 3:20:47.700]  They're wonderful products and they support the info.
[3:20:47.700 --> 3:20:49.900]  We're thanking you.
[3:20:49.900 --> 3:20:53.020]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[3:20:53.020 --> 3:20:56.820]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told and it's all going to
[3:20:56.820 --> 3:20:57.820]  pass.
[3:20:57.820 --> 3:21:01.420]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[3:21:01.420 --> 3:21:05.580]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being
[3:21:05.580 --> 3:21:06.580]  totally enslaved.
[3:21:06.580 --> 3:21:10.380]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[3:21:10.380 --> 3:21:11.380]  that move.
[3:21:11.380 --> 3:21:15.380]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[3:21:15.380 --> 3:21:21.060]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[3:21:21.060 --> 3:21:26.020]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[3:21:26.020 --> 3:21:31.660]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[3:21:31.660 --> 3:21:36.260]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[3:21:36.260 --> 3:21:42.260]  year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[3:21:42.260 --> 3:21:45.220]  get more IMF and World Bank money.
[3:21:45.220 --> 3:21:52.500]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[3:21:52.500 --> 3:21:57.460]  Look, I've proven that InfoWars information is some of the best in the world.
[3:21:57.460 --> 3:21:59.900]  It's just absolutely on target.
[3:21:59.900 --> 3:22:02.980]  The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate.
[3:22:02.980 --> 3:22:04.340]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[3:22:04.340 --> 3:22:08.420]  I believe in humanity and I want to see what powers, because I know that John F. Kennedy
[3:22:08.420 --> 3:22:12.300]  was right, raising tide raises all ships.
[3:22:12.300 --> 3:22:18.220]  Now the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have at infowars.com are

[3:22:49.380 --> 3:22:50.940]  The people are awakening.
[3:22:50.940 --> 3:22:54.100]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[3:22:54.100 --> 3:22:55.420]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[3:22:55.420 --> 3:22:58.140]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[3:22:58.140 --> 3:23:02.660]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHIComs
[3:23:02.660 --> 3:23:09.180]  especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets
[3:23:09.180 --> 3:23:13.140]  when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on
[3:23:13.140 --> 3:23:16.500]  record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[3:23:16.500 --> 3:23:22.980]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[3:23:22.980 --> 3:23:24.420]  In their own words, they admit it.
[3:23:24.420 --> 3:23:28.420]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and blockets and things like that for more than
[3:23:28.420 --> 3:23:29.420]  a decade.
[3:23:29.420 --> 3:23:31.300]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[3:23:31.300 --> 3:23:32.300]  They're Faraday cages.
[3:23:32.300 --> 3:23:34.060]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[3:23:34.060 --> 3:23:36.060]  They work absolutely great.
[3:23:36.060 --> 3:23:41.060]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[3:23:41.060 --> 3:23:44.180]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because
[3:23:44.180 --> 3:23:45.180]  it's another business.
[3:23:45.180 --> 3:23:52.340]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com today.
[3:23:52.340 --> 3:24:08.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:08.260 --> 3:24:15.580]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Baggage.
[3:24:15.580 --> 3:24:18.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:18.900 --> 3:24:24.300]  Man, I'm really having a great Friday and I'm glad you're with me on this ride sharing
[3:24:24.300 --> 3:24:28.220]  your time as I'm sharing mine because this is how it happens, you know, the one thing
[3:24:28.220 --> 3:24:30.860]  we do get time and I share mine with you.
[3:24:30.860 --> 3:24:32.500]  I was telling you that's based a relationship.
[3:24:32.500 --> 3:24:37.300]  I really do consider my friends, even if some of you are angry at me, time to time because
[3:24:37.300 --> 3:24:40.020]  friends do that, you know, and it hones us, makes it sharper.
[3:24:40.020 --> 3:24:43.500]  I really want to know what you think, but please don't try and assign things to me.
[3:24:43.500 --> 3:24:44.500]  Ask me to do more.
[3:24:44.500 --> 3:24:50.300]  I'm doing what I need to do, what I do is programmed in from my relationship with creation.
[3:24:50.300 --> 3:24:54.220]  If you have something to say about what you think I ought to be doing, pray about it then.
[3:24:54.220 --> 3:24:55.220]  Send it on upstairs.
[3:24:55.220 --> 3:24:59.460]  If he sends it over and drops it into my constant, believe me, I'll be on it, but that's the only
[3:24:59.460 --> 3:25:00.940]  way it comes into my trajectory.
[3:25:00.940 --> 3:25:03.900]  I'm not doing it any other way and I'm not taking instructions from anyone else.
[3:25:03.900 --> 3:25:07.100]  So, if you've got instructions for me and going to work, I'm going to ignore it.
[3:25:07.100 --> 3:25:08.100]  Don't waste your time.
[3:25:08.100 --> 3:25:09.100]  Send it to me.
[3:25:09.100 --> 3:25:10.100]  Send it upstairs.
[3:25:10.100 --> 3:25:11.100]  He'll send it over.
[3:25:11.100 --> 3:25:12.100]  He'll download it.
[3:25:12.100 --> 3:25:13.100]  Don't worry.
[3:25:13.100 --> 3:25:14.100]  It gets in.
[3:25:14.100 --> 3:25:15.100]  All right.
[3:25:15.100 --> 3:25:19.100]  Now, because I'm doing this 10-hour feed coming up, I did this segment.
[3:25:19.100 --> 3:25:26.100]  It was one of the lessons of my suite and I talk about her because she was my fiance.
[3:25:26.100 --> 3:25:31.260]  I had to break that off, but she is in fact, and we see each other just as friends, deep
[3:25:31.260 --> 3:25:32.260]  friends.
[3:25:32.260 --> 3:25:35.940]  She's the person I trust more than anyone in the world, just where she is health-wise,
[3:25:35.940 --> 3:25:41.500]  where I am in the work I'm doing and all the things that are happening in our lives.
[3:25:41.500 --> 3:25:47.140]  I've been running at 5% for 10 years and I just kicked it back in first gear and it's
[3:25:47.140 --> 3:25:51.340]  scary for people, but she's good and we're there where we need to be, but she gave me
[3:25:51.340 --> 3:25:56.060]  this concept called, what we used to joke about called the naked hour, right, being naked,
[3:25:56.060 --> 3:25:57.060]  you know?
[3:25:57.060 --> 3:26:00.700]  Because there's a man in the way I was raised being naked in front of him, making me a little
[3:26:00.700 --> 3:26:01.980]  bit uncomfortable, you know?
[3:26:01.980 --> 3:26:08.300]  So, she joked with me to make me comfortable about who I was in terms of my own form even.
[3:26:08.300 --> 3:26:12.020]  And then who I was even at a deeper level in lots of ways, and she did such a gentle
[3:26:12.020 --> 3:26:13.020]  sweet way.
[3:26:13.020 --> 3:26:14.540]  And she taught me a lot.
[3:26:14.540 --> 3:26:19.180]  And in that, instead of what always happens or a lot of that happens in a relationship,
[3:26:19.180 --> 3:26:23.420]  you know, the information comes through with, hey, man, you're screwed up, you know, change,
[3:26:23.420 --> 3:26:27.860]  get rid of those white skivvies, I like colored ones, you know, your girl's telling you,
[3:26:27.860 --> 3:26:32.500]  well, I guess so, you know, whatever you think, or whatever that funny thing is that just
[3:26:32.500 --> 3:26:36.660]  comes at you in that wrong way, you know, and all she's trying to do is improve you
[3:26:36.660 --> 3:26:37.660]  a little bit.
[3:26:37.660 --> 3:26:41.460]  So, a little more attractive of a package to her or whatever it is, you know, we can
[3:26:41.460 --> 3:26:42.460]  come at that soft.
[3:26:42.460 --> 3:26:43.460]  The M was always good.
[3:26:43.460 --> 3:26:47.740]  She said, yeah, have you considered, have you thought about Nick?
[3:26:47.740 --> 3:26:51.500]  And she'd lay it into me that way, and I go, that makes you think, see, then you have to
[3:26:51.500 --> 3:26:52.500]  go turn in.
[3:26:52.500 --> 3:26:55.500]  She knows how to get your turn in, instead of giving the judgment from the outside.
[3:26:55.500 --> 3:26:58.980]  You know, hey, have you thought about, have you considered nice way to get your turn in
[3:26:58.980 --> 3:27:03.060]  on the question and answer it yourself and project out what your answer might be.
[3:27:03.060 --> 3:27:05.780]  And generally, it's more gentler and more softer.
[3:27:05.780 --> 3:27:08.860]  So Anne taught me the concept of the naked hour.
[3:27:08.860 --> 3:27:12.900]  So literally, when I do this 10-hour feed, it'll be kind of fun, because I'm going to
[3:27:12.900 --> 3:27:16.620]  jump out of bed, the camera's going to catch me, they're going to wake me up really.
[3:27:16.620 --> 3:27:20.300]  I'm going to go through my morning ritual, which is a ritual.
[3:27:20.300 --> 3:27:26.100]  I have a ritual I do, it's developed over my lifetime, it's how I tune up my day and
[3:27:26.100 --> 3:27:27.100]  do my day.
[3:27:27.100 --> 3:27:30.300]  And it says something to be taught in this, you'll have your own, but within this there
[3:27:30.300 --> 3:27:34.500]  are these little mini keys I'll identify, and I'll come out of that frame, we'll roll
[3:27:34.500 --> 3:27:38.740]  into some other things, and we'll come into my kitchen, in my table where I work, and
[3:27:38.740 --> 3:27:42.140]  I'm going to sweep this camera around and make everybody nervous, they've got a pair
[3:27:42.140 --> 3:27:46.020]  of warnings, show you the set that we're going to use, so you know what we're doing.
[3:27:46.020 --> 3:27:49.740]  This is where I live, this is my home, I'm going to share my home with everybody, and
[3:27:49.740 --> 3:27:55.660]  try and catch some camera angles to appreciate it a bit as I do, and get far enough back,
[3:27:55.660 --> 3:27:58.660]  and you'll see where I've been doing this show on these two baskets over here, which
[3:27:58.660 --> 3:28:02.540]  work fine for me, because I get to reconfigure my life and get back into my frame.
[3:28:02.540 --> 3:28:07.340]  But where I do a lot of my work tends to be at this table in my kitchen.
[3:28:07.340 --> 3:28:11.420]  So I'll introduce that, we've got five cameras, we're going to try and get rolling, so we
[3:28:11.420 --> 3:28:15.740]  have everything captured right, fed into a stream, that's where I do most of my work
[3:28:15.740 --> 3:28:20.940]  in between, that's my coffee set up over there in my kitchen, and you know, and I like art,
[3:28:20.940 --> 3:28:26.220]  so I've collected art from all over the place, I got a lot gifted to me in time, and I make
[3:28:26.220 --> 3:28:27.220]  art part of my life.
[3:28:27.220 --> 3:28:32.660]  I've got some things for Alex over there as a Damascus steel sword, I've got set up for
[3:28:32.660 --> 3:28:36.500]  him a Roman 4th century, I'm going to give him, there's a sword, then there's some spears,
[3:28:36.500 --> 3:28:40.340]  because we're the tip of the spear here folks, I want to get one of those to Alex, I want
[3:28:40.340 --> 3:28:45.300]  to go back down there, but sweeping in, we're going to walk into my space, this image on
[3:28:45.300 --> 3:28:50.780]  the wall with the crosses, one hand shot, it's one of my favorite, and this is it, you
[3:28:50.780 --> 3:28:57.540]  know, I come into this space, this is where I'll start this feed, where I sleep at night,
[3:28:57.540 --> 3:29:03.580]  this is where I do my morning prayer work in this room, and I'll introduce you to all
[3:29:03.580 --> 3:29:07.940]  that later, but this just gives you kind of an idea, this is my living space, this is
[3:29:07.940 --> 3:29:13.780]  a space I live in, I have a floor below me, it's primarily an office, it's got a green
[3:29:13.780 --> 3:29:17.940]  screen set up, lights, all the things to run that part of my life, a full kitchen guest
[3:29:17.940 --> 3:29:24.060]  room, and my daughter when she's with me has that space, and the daughter I'm raising
[3:29:24.060 --> 3:29:31.860]  I've adopted, as many of you know, she's my granddaughter, she's biracial, she's black,
[3:29:31.860 --> 3:29:37.420]  and Caucasian, and my son, my youngest son could not do it, and so we've been raising
[3:29:37.420 --> 3:29:42.180]  her since she was one, and she is the light of my life, and in the course of this week
[3:29:42.180 --> 3:29:47.980]  of nuttiness in my own house for the anger, I saw things in her that just touched my soul
[3:29:47.980 --> 3:29:52.140]  in a way that I've never known my daughter, I mean there's so much healing in my life
[3:29:52.140 --> 3:29:59.740]  right now, I just, I can't be more grateful, but on April Fool's Day I picked that day
[3:29:59.740 --> 3:30:05.100]  and it's when Dr. Nick gets naked, explaining some of the keys to creation, and living a
[3:30:05.100 --> 3:30:10.620]  life of lift, and reclaiming life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and those were
[3:30:10.620 --> 3:30:14.900]  read from my notes, and I read them because I want to be clear what we're doing, so that
[3:30:14.900 --> 3:30:19.900]  it is a page in notes, but that's what I'm going to try and do there, because if you
[3:30:19.900 --> 3:30:24.660]  don't have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, if I don't have it, and you
[3:30:24.660 --> 3:30:29.860]  don't have it, then we have failed in what we are as a nation, so I'd like to bring
[3:30:29.860 --> 3:30:35.420]  some of that light back into the conversation in the most powerful way I ever have in my
[3:30:35.420 --> 3:30:40.100]  life, I'm going to deliver 10 hours minimum, I'll go as long as it takes, as long as my
[3:30:40.100 --> 3:30:45.060]  voice holds out, so it'll be calm and slow, because if I can go 24 hours, I'm going to
[3:30:45.060 --> 3:30:50.220]  make the attempt, but I'm going the distance to deliver a coherent message that starts
[3:30:50.220 --> 3:30:57.020]  with you and ends with you, but in the middle we'll give you the tools and some things to
[3:30:57.020 --> 3:31:03.140]  target that will give positive trajectories for the world we can take over, and what you
[3:31:03.140 --> 3:31:08.900]  can do to really help me in that effort is get on my mailing list, so I can let you know
[3:31:08.900 --> 3:31:15.860]  what you can do in detail without taking up time here, and it's easy, infoetearthbols.com,
[3:31:15.860 --> 3:31:19.100]  there's a sign up, Nick's list, don't send me bunch of emails, I'm going to punch thing
[3:31:19.100 --> 3:31:24.660]  out on Sunday with a small video feed that will take you into the YouTube channel that
[3:31:24.660 --> 3:31:28.940]  we're setting up, and I've got to have 1,000 people minimum sign up to get that channel
[3:31:28.940 --> 3:31:33.540]  activated live by the 1st of April, so I need that as your mission if you're going to help
[3:31:33.540 --> 3:31:39.700]  me, is when I send you that newsletter, go in there and activate that channel and let's
[3:31:39.700 --> 3:31:44.820]  turn Nick on and let's let the world get a feed in a way that you've never gotten before
[3:31:44.820 --> 3:31:51.580]  with a full coherent message of a comprehensive view of how I see the trajectory we're in
[3:31:51.580 --> 3:31:57.540]  based on the half a century of scholarly work, lots of conversation, lots of delivery
[3:31:57.540 --> 3:32:04.620]  of information, I've done 4,000 radio broadcasts from one to three hours across 200 platforms
[3:32:04.620 --> 3:32:09.540]  with 200 different producers, I've delivered hundreds of lectures around the world in 44
[3:32:09.540 --> 3:32:15.380]  countries, many times, many times, I've had a lot of experience, I want to share it, and
[3:32:15.380 --> 3:32:18.340]  then I'm going to disappear, because the month of April you're not going to hear anything
[3:32:18.340 --> 3:32:23.060]  from me after that day, when that runs, clock runs, I'm taking a rest, I'm breaking from
[3:32:23.060 --> 3:32:28.060]  the world, I'm disappearing for a while as I determine how I'm going to do the next
[3:32:28.060 --> 3:32:32.780]  bit of my life, I've laid a plan and I've talked about that, but how I come back in,
[3:32:32.780 --> 3:32:37.220]  I don't want me to be the issue, so I break off from what I say, I won't take any interviews
[3:32:37.220 --> 3:32:42.580]  at all, I won't do any feeds at all, I just talk to my friends, and if you see me, be
[3:32:42.580 --> 3:32:47.660]  my friend, or if you're going to be the FU guy, just come up and tell me what the issue
[3:32:47.660 --> 3:32:52.620]  is and be kind about it and I'll be respectful to you and hear it, because I do want to know,
[3:32:52.620 --> 3:32:57.500]  I don't want to provoke people to anger, that's the last thing I want to do, I want to provoke
[3:32:57.500 --> 3:33:01.940]  you to love, and that's my only mission, and I know that's the mission going forward,
[3:33:01.940 --> 3:33:08.020]  the scholarship supports that, I have a platform to speak with, speak on, I'm not afraid to
[3:33:08.020 --> 3:33:12.220]  face myself in the public, we'll have a feed where I've sinned against any man, they'll
[3:33:12.220 --> 3:33:16.100]  have a way to feed that in, and when that shows over, I'll admit anything that someone
[3:33:16.100 --> 3:33:20.860]  wants to put on my plate, I will live a transparent life, I will encourage you to do the same
[3:33:20.860 --> 3:33:25.620]  by being an example of a transparent man, I'm not afraid to face anything in my past,
[3:33:25.620 --> 3:33:30.740]  anyone I've hurt, I ask for forgiveness, you want to bring it on the air, I'll do it publicly
[3:33:30.740 --> 3:33:36.460]  if it's required, but not a day goes by where I'm not going to say that we can lift ourselves
[3:33:36.460 --> 3:33:40.580]  to a higher place and everyone of us has the power of change, because we have the power
[3:33:40.580 --> 3:33:46.820]  of choice and the spark of life with us, this is Dr. Nick Baggage, Nicholas is my new transition,

[3:34:51.580 --> 3:34:55.820]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[3:34:55.820 --> 3:34:59.020]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[3:34:59.020 --> 3:35:02.140]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[3:35:02.140 --> 3:35:03.420]  can to shut us down.
[3:35:03.420 --> 3:35:07.700]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air and please support the local states here
[3:35:07.700 --> 3:35:08.700]  listening to us well.
[3:35:08.700 --> 3:35:13.900]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can and get a book, get a
[3:35:13.900 --> 3:35:18.980]  film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay
[3:35:18.980 --> 3:35:21.180]  on air in the face of this thing.
[3:35:21.180 --> 3:35:23.300]  I need your help more than ever now.
[3:35:23.300 --> 3:35:27.620]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[3:35:27.620 --> 3:35:33.020]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great

[3:35:41.940 --> 3:35:43.700]  All of it nurtures the soul.
[3:35:43.700 --> 3:35:45.300]  All of it empowers humanity.
[3:35:45.300 --> 3:35:47.780]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[3:35:47.780 --> 3:35:50.140]  Thank you so much.
[3:35:50.140 --> 3:35:54.180]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[3:35:54.180 --> 3:35:57.180]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[3:35:57.180 --> 3:36:01.740]  They're trying to take over civilization and society and they depend on the public being
[3:36:01.740 --> 3:36:02.740]  ignorant.
[3:36:02.740 --> 3:36:06.740]  That's what Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[3:36:06.740 --> 3:36:11.860]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems
[3:36:11.860 --> 3:36:15.620]  that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[3:36:15.620 --> 3:36:18.860]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because
[3:36:18.860 --> 3:36:21.900]  it's so simple because you won't be under their control anymore.
[3:36:21.900 --> 3:36:26.340]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out
[3:36:26.340 --> 3:36:30.340]  there in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.

[3:36:35.180 --> 3:36:36.180]  same time.

[3:36:38.500 --> 3:36:42.780]  So again, InfoWarsStore.com, it's back in stock, 50% off.
[3:36:42.780 --> 3:36:45.980]  Vitamin mineral fusion, I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[3:36:45.980 --> 3:36:50.100]  So take action today and give it to your friends and family as a gift.
[3:36:50.100 --> 3:36:52.460]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[3:36:52.460 --> 3:36:54.380]  It's very bittersweet.
[3:36:54.380 --> 3:36:57.220]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[3:36:57.220 --> 3:36:59.300]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[3:36:59.300 --> 3:37:00.860]  I care about beating the new world order.
[3:37:00.860 --> 3:37:06.100]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[3:37:06.100 --> 3:37:09.340]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[3:37:09.340 --> 3:37:12.980]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[3:37:12.980 --> 3:37:13.980]  the end.
[3:37:13.980 --> 3:37:16.580]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[3:37:16.580 --> 3:37:20.220]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:37:20.220 --> 3:37:22.780]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[3:37:22.780 --> 3:37:25.940]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[3:37:25.940 --> 3:37:26.940]  Do they fund freedom?
[3:37:26.940 --> 3:37:27.940]  No, a lot of them don't.
[3:37:27.940 --> 3:37:32.620]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[3:37:32.620 --> 3:37:34.460]  up and looking for truth.
[3:37:34.460 --> 3:37:36.140]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[3:37:36.140 --> 3:37:39.540]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[3:37:39.540 --> 3:37:43.020]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[3:37:43.020 --> 3:37:46.460]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're
[3:37:46.460 --> 3:37:52.340]  going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[3:37:52.340 --> 3:38:10.300]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:38:10.300 --> 3:38:16.020]  You know, it always goes so fast and I got the whole hour and I'm into the last 10 minutes
[3:38:16.020 --> 3:38:21.740]  of broadcast time, but I have to say, how much I appreciate everyone and how grateful
[3:38:21.740 --> 3:38:26.260]  I am for having the privilege of being here and having this conversation today.
[3:38:26.260 --> 3:38:30.060]  Because you do give up your time and that's the most precious thing that we have in the
[3:38:30.060 --> 3:38:31.060]  world.
[3:38:31.060 --> 3:38:35.260]  And when we give it up to spend with someone, that's a precious moment for me and I spend
[3:38:35.260 --> 3:38:40.300]  it with you, with that sincerity, going with the time I take out of my life to do this
[3:38:40.300 --> 3:38:41.300]  work.
[3:38:41.300 --> 3:38:45.460]  And it's my privilege, you know, that's why I'm always happy.
[3:38:45.460 --> 3:38:46.460]  This is my gift.
[3:38:46.460 --> 3:38:47.460]  This is what I do.
[3:38:47.460 --> 3:38:53.220]  I do it with boys with full intent that will empower people that you might change your world
[3:38:53.220 --> 3:38:56.980]  and the rest of the world as well as a consequence of that.
[3:38:56.980 --> 3:39:00.740]  Not that we have to, so I do it a little bit differently, you know, and I try to activate
[3:39:00.740 --> 3:39:05.140]  the individual to find out who they are and wake up and in the context of a lot of information
[3:39:05.140 --> 3:39:09.500]  makes sense to people and also in the context of my own suffering as a human being to make
[3:39:09.500 --> 3:39:11.260]  me human like you.
[3:39:11.260 --> 3:39:15.140]  And so the thing I'm going to do, you know, because I got this, you know, it's kind of
[3:39:15.140 --> 3:39:18.780]  bothering me, you know, the thing about people thinking, oh, I'm some kind of drug or something.
[3:39:18.780 --> 3:39:21.900]  And so I'm going to deal with that in this 10 hour feed this way.
[3:39:21.900 --> 3:39:24.780]  It'll be funny, but it'll make, maybe make my mom uncomfortable.
[3:39:24.780 --> 3:39:25.780]  She's still alive.
[3:39:25.780 --> 3:39:29.980]  She's in her eighties, you know, and so, so I'll have a mechanism to be send flowers
[3:39:29.980 --> 3:39:34.460]  to mom cards or pops up every time I embarrass her and do something to make you feel better
[3:39:34.460 --> 3:39:38.580]  and her feel better and I don't have to do with it because hopefully she's not watching
[3:39:38.580 --> 3:39:41.540]  the feed show us here about later, but flowers will show up in her house.
[3:39:41.540 --> 3:39:42.540]  That'll make her happy.
[3:39:42.540 --> 3:39:43.540]  That'll make me happy.
[3:39:43.540 --> 3:39:44.540]  That'll make you happy.
[3:39:44.540 --> 3:39:46.420]  And you can go, oh man, that's embarrassing.
[3:39:46.420 --> 3:39:47.420]  Nick, why'd you show that?
[3:39:47.420 --> 3:39:51.380]  Well, because sometimes you got to show yourself so people know that you suffer too.
[3:39:51.380 --> 3:39:52.940]  But I want to make funny.
[3:39:52.940 --> 3:39:57.300]  Now, somebody accused me of drugs or I'm going to eliminate that beginning of this thing,
[3:39:57.300 --> 3:40:00.700]  some in the front end of this feed, I'm going to pee in a cup.
[3:40:00.700 --> 3:40:04.220]  And maybe we run a contest and get to see who holds cup can't hold the unit.
[3:40:04.220 --> 3:40:05.900]  You know, that's not, that's mine to hold.
[3:40:05.900 --> 3:40:06.900]  Sorry.
[3:40:06.900 --> 3:40:08.900]  I want to just be a little funny here, but I'm actually going to do it.
[3:40:08.900 --> 3:40:10.140]  We'll screen it out for the young kids.
[3:40:10.140 --> 3:40:11.380]  We want to do that.
[3:40:11.380 --> 3:40:14.980]  You know, I'm proud of it, but I ain't going to show it.
[3:40:14.980 --> 3:40:16.700]  You know, no, he's not live.
[3:40:16.700 --> 3:40:17.700]  So here's how we'll do it.
[3:40:17.700 --> 3:40:18.700]  So we'll make that happen.
[3:40:18.700 --> 3:40:19.700]  We'll do it at the beginning.
[3:40:19.700 --> 3:40:21.180]  We'll do it somewhere in the middle and we'll do it again.
[3:40:21.180 --> 3:40:22.180]  That way.
[3:40:22.180 --> 3:40:24.340]  And I'll get everybody in the room who's filming this thing, they're going to sign
[3:40:24.340 --> 3:40:25.340]  after Davis.
[3:40:25.340 --> 3:40:26.340]  I'm going to get my turn to draw them up.
[3:40:26.340 --> 3:40:27.340]  Sign after that.
[3:40:27.340 --> 3:40:28.340]  Yep.
[3:40:28.340 --> 3:40:29.340]  Dr. Nick.
[3:40:29.340 --> 3:40:30.340]  Yep.
[3:40:30.340 --> 3:40:31.340]  Nicholas did the pee test.
[3:40:31.340 --> 3:40:32.340]  Just like he said, it's all good.
[3:40:32.340 --> 3:40:33.340]  And I'll tell you what's going to be in that pee test.
[3:40:33.340 --> 3:40:34.340]  I'll tell you then.
[3:40:34.340 --> 3:40:35.340]  I'll tell you that.
[3:40:35.340 --> 3:40:36.340]  I won't tell you now.
[3:40:36.340 --> 3:40:37.340]  That'll be your surprise.
[3:40:37.340 --> 3:40:43.260]  And you'll be surprised probably, but maybe not, okay, so we slow that all down.
[3:40:43.260 --> 3:40:45.780]  We get in the frame again about what we're teaching today.
[3:40:45.780 --> 3:40:46.780]  That's important.
[3:40:46.780 --> 3:40:47.780]  And it's the keys.
[3:40:47.780 --> 3:40:51.860]  I started with the naked hour, which is being honest with yourself, which kind of goes right
[3:40:51.860 --> 3:40:52.860]  where I was, right?
[3:40:52.860 --> 3:40:57.460]  Cause I'm about to be transparent in a way that might even embarrass my mom, but I'll
[3:40:57.460 --> 3:40:58.460]  do it.
[3:40:58.460 --> 3:41:03.620]  I'll be a fool for Christ, a fool for me in my religion, my view, but I'm not asking
[3:41:03.620 --> 3:41:06.460]  you to do anything about that.
[3:41:06.460 --> 3:41:07.740]  It's my model.
[3:41:07.740 --> 3:41:09.300]  That's my programming.
[3:41:09.300 --> 3:41:12.100]  I'm sorry if it's not yours, but please take no offense.
[3:41:12.100 --> 3:41:15.580]  I'm not the advertiser you heard before, and I'm not going to talk about that because
[3:41:15.580 --> 3:41:19.700]  I believe that is, it is respectful.
[3:41:19.700 --> 3:41:27.100]  I believe it is respectful to be respectful of human beings on their paths, whichever
[3:41:27.100 --> 3:41:34.260]  alters they need to learn from to fulfill their destinies as God intended them to fulfill
[3:41:34.260 --> 3:41:40.180]  them and as consciousness within the framework of each individual is framed around their
[3:41:40.180 --> 3:41:41.340]  experience.
[3:41:41.340 --> 3:41:49.100]  And I believe God is, is loving a father to every one of us as I am and wish to be better
[3:41:49.100 --> 3:41:51.980]  with my own children.
[3:41:51.980 --> 3:41:57.700]  So when I think of a loving God and father, and I started cultivating that type of relationship
[3:41:57.700 --> 3:42:03.740]  differently than I have before, but in November and in the course of this time in November,
[3:42:03.740 --> 3:42:05.700]  it has really altered me.
[3:42:05.700 --> 3:42:07.980]  I used a phrase that offended people.
[3:42:07.980 --> 3:42:14.900]  I have gone through a transformation, a transfiguration, a compilation of all I've experienced, and
[3:42:14.900 --> 3:42:20.620]  in my own awareness, all that data, all that stuff I described, if you think about it,
[3:42:20.620 --> 3:42:26.620]  that's my data warehouse, my data storage, all the experiences, emotions, all that represents,
[3:42:26.620 --> 3:42:28.780]  if you think about it, data storage.
[3:42:28.780 --> 3:42:32.300]  And as I compare it to the other parts of my life where I actually had worked on this,
[3:42:32.300 --> 3:42:37.340]  to the evil side who have data warehouses, you can read about it in Earth Rising the
[3:42:37.340 --> 3:42:39.020]  Revolution to learn what all that is.
[3:42:39.020 --> 3:42:42.700]  Well, there's a evil side to what I'm going to teach, and I'll bring that in the picture
[3:42:42.700 --> 3:42:44.220]  so people can see what they are.
[3:42:44.220 --> 3:42:49.420]  The whole idea of mind control on the other side of this, you know, even within the InfoWars,
[3:42:49.420 --> 3:42:55.580]  there's a phrase that is 12-year-old and New Brunswick identified that was locking or
[3:42:55.580 --> 3:43:00.900]  even locking our program, and it's the phrase, you are the resistance.
[3:43:00.900 --> 3:43:07.980]  Now that, we know what that means as InfoWars, we're resisting that which comes against us.
[3:43:07.980 --> 3:43:12.580]  But in the common usage of the word resistance, it's used differently.
[3:43:12.580 --> 3:43:15.820]  It's resist what's being said, it's how most people see it.
[3:43:15.820 --> 3:43:20.180]  So we have set up with the very phrase we use, this is another key I'm teaching, a
[3:43:20.180 --> 3:43:25.100]  law on our own thing, it goes like this, resist, we know what it means, it goes out of the
[3:43:25.100 --> 3:43:29.980]  frame, but the big push is what the majority of psychic energy, which is how it works,
[3:43:29.980 --> 3:43:33.780]  tied to emotions and meaning of word, which pushes against it.
[3:43:33.780 --> 3:43:39.620]  So we have chaos within this cycle, probably within everything around it, and an inertia
[3:43:39.620 --> 3:43:45.620]  that doesn't seem to move, and I saw it when I asked two million people one day to send
[3:43:45.620 --> 3:43:51.060]  me a message, and I got 12 out of two million that are not lukewarm sitting on a bench.
[3:43:51.060 --> 3:43:55.340]  So an F you or a thank you works for me if it gets you out of the lukewarm deal, even
[3:43:55.340 --> 3:44:01.260]  if you'll fall on the floor laughing or crying or whatever, at least you're moving again
[3:44:01.260 --> 3:44:04.060]  and begin asking, oh man, is he right?
[3:44:04.060 --> 3:44:05.060]  Is he wrong?
[3:44:05.060 --> 3:44:06.060]  That's a good question.
[3:44:06.060 --> 3:44:07.580]  Ask yourself, not me.
[3:44:07.580 --> 3:44:12.740]  And that's where I'd like you to do is let's come together in a different way, recognize
[3:44:12.740 --> 3:44:18.260]  the dignity and respect that each of us should share with one another, and come together
[3:44:18.260 --> 3:44:27.500]  in a different way, where we actually look into each other's eyes, that we see the vision
[3:44:27.500 --> 3:44:31.500]  that we share in the spark of life that we are.
[3:44:31.500 --> 3:44:36.300]  Look into that eye of the person next to you that you share your life with.
[3:44:36.300 --> 3:44:41.260]  More importantly, when you look in the mirror in the morning, look directly in your eyes
[3:44:41.260 --> 3:44:47.220]  after you've done the surface work of teeth and makeup, look in your own eyes, gaze into
[3:44:47.220 --> 3:44:53.620]  your own self for just a moment, and reconnect with yourself in that morning breath.
[3:44:53.620 --> 3:44:57.740]  As you breathe in the breath of life, look in your own eyes and decide who's responsible
[3:44:57.740 --> 3:44:58.740]  for your day.
[3:44:58.740 --> 3:44:59.740]  You'll discover them there.
[3:44:59.740 --> 3:45:05.020]  Your best critic, the only one worth listening to, looking in your own eyes in the morning
[3:45:05.020 --> 3:45:06.780]  is how you'll start your day.
[3:45:06.780 --> 3:45:10.460]  And then as you've contemplated in your mind how that day will roll out, things you'll
[3:45:10.460 --> 3:45:14.740]  see in the people you know, and how you're going to smile into that and lift them everywhere
[3:45:14.740 --> 3:45:15.740]  you go.
[3:45:15.740 --> 3:45:17.100]  So set that up.
[3:45:17.100 --> 3:45:22.420]  Once you have that locked in, however you relate to creation, speak it in words so the
[3:45:22.420 --> 3:45:25.220]  vibration of your words actually goes into it.
[3:45:25.220 --> 3:45:28.660]  No one's there with you in the bathroom but you, and consciousness itself.
[3:45:28.660 --> 3:45:33.860]  It's a way to connect with yourself in the morning, start out your day, and own your
[3:45:33.860 --> 3:45:38.180]  day all the way through the day, and reflecting on that moment when you looked in your own
[3:45:38.180 --> 3:45:40.100]  eyes whenever you start to drag.
[3:45:40.100 --> 3:45:45.780]  And remember that's the one carrying your day today, and your link to consciousness is
[3:45:45.780 --> 3:45:50.780]  carrying the weight of anything dragging you down, keep your trajectory up.
[3:45:50.780 --> 3:45:55.300]  End of the day, brush teeth, wash face, do things you can do at night, get the makeup
[3:45:55.300 --> 3:45:58.780]  off, do it again, just for a few moments.
[3:45:58.780 --> 3:46:00.420]  One minute is all it takes.
[3:46:00.420 --> 3:46:01.420]  This is another key.
[3:46:01.420 --> 3:46:03.820]  This is a key on the back end of your day.
[3:46:03.820 --> 3:46:07.020]  So you do, you have a conversation yourself, how did I do?
[3:46:07.020 --> 3:46:08.020]  How did my day go?
[3:46:08.020 --> 3:46:09.820]  Did I do what I wanted to do?
[3:46:09.820 --> 3:46:11.780]  Did I drag over the ways I could fix that?
[3:46:11.780 --> 3:46:12.780]  You make your own decision.
[3:46:12.780 --> 3:46:14.660]  You decide how it went.
[3:46:14.660 --> 3:46:18.780]  And then ask whatever your relationship is to creation to work with you as you sleep
[3:46:18.780 --> 3:46:25.100]  and as you get untangled from your operating system, kicks in gear, because the separation
[3:46:25.100 --> 3:46:29.820]  of the memory and the emotion, the thing that drive us cause to react to me, swung around
[3:46:29.820 --> 3:46:30.820]  by emotion.
[3:46:30.820 --> 3:46:31.820]  I'll teach you how to control that.
[3:46:31.820 --> 3:46:37.620]  How to kick in the awareness, your own operating system to own everything in your experience,
[3:46:37.620 --> 3:46:43.260]  your emotion to your operating system takes control of your data warehouse instead of
[3:46:43.260 --> 3:46:48.020]  letting it run wild, which is what it does reacting to everyone else's movement within
[3:46:48.020 --> 3:46:49.660]  the reality we live in.
[3:46:49.660 --> 3:46:54.500]  So it's important for you to find the you and you that gives you the power to understand
[3:46:54.500 --> 3:46:55.500]  what's happening.
[3:46:55.500 --> 3:46:59.060]  I'll teach this in a way that you've never heard before that has nothing to do with your
[3:46:59.060 --> 3:47:04.100]  religion, but has everything to do with what creation is according to the best science
[3:47:04.100 --> 3:47:05.340]  in the world.
[3:47:05.340 --> 3:47:11.340]  And that takes you into the realm of consciousness, which takes you in the realm of God and love
[3:47:11.340 --> 3:47:12.980]  and what consciousness is.
[3:47:12.980 --> 3:47:16.180]  You may not like the words in which I frame it, but I will give you a coherent way to
[3:47:16.180 --> 3:47:21.860]  consider it, a way that will change the world, perhaps change you and will complete what
[3:47:21.860 --> 3:47:24.980]  I believe my primary mission in this lifetime is.
[3:47:24.980 --> 3:47:26.820]  That feat is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:47:26.820 --> 3:47:31.540]  After that, I need a month to figure out what I'm going to do because the only thing I
[3:47:31.540 --> 3:47:36.740]  want to change in this world is I want to activate people to recognize themselves.
[3:47:36.740 --> 3:47:41.940]  And then I have to decide how I do that within the framework of my life, the resources the
[3:47:41.940 --> 3:47:49.580]  creation has given me to put in play, to do my part of encouraging you to lift, not drag,
[3:47:49.580 --> 3:47:55.180]  come into the spirit that we're intended to be as created human beings, manifest love
[3:47:55.180 --> 3:47:57.860]  in this earth in a very different way.
[3:47:57.860 --> 3:48:03.700]  I need you to get on my list, I need you to look at info at earthbols.com and I need you
[3:48:03.700 --> 3:48:08.780]  to support this network, support everyone on this network as a paycheck, I don't.
[3:48:08.780 --> 3:48:11.100]  But they do and they need to be there.
[3:48:11.100 --> 3:48:16.220]  Help Alex Jones now, when he needs it the most, because now is the hour.
[3:48:16.220 --> 3:48:21.140]  Now we have the power to make the change, but we can come into who we are and manifest
[3:48:21.140 --> 3:48:27.300]  the gifts of creation in this earth and bring down a new earth into this frame.
[3:48:27.300 --> 3:48:36.100]  This is Dr. Nick Baggage, Nicholas, April 1st, arriving, 10 hours deep, get in it, win it.
[3:48:36.100 --> 3:48:58.260]  Thanks for being.
