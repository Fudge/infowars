[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, June 23rd, 2023, I'm your host Alex Jones coming to you
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.720]  you from beautiful Tampa, Florida, from the amazing studios of The River Church.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.320]  Find all the links to that at Revival.com.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.600]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown is right over here, one of my peanut gallery, I actually have
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.040]  an in-studio audience, they have illustrious, illustrious patriots over here.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.000]  They better watch out, this is a popular talk show, so they're with them too, I may have
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.440]  to draft them in here.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.960]  But hey, here's Biden, putting his hand over his heart for what he thinks is the national
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.960]  anthem.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.640]  It is the national anthem of India, they don't put their hands over their hearts there, same
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.280]  thing in Russia, but we do it here.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.540]  But he doesn't know, of course you're not supposed to put your hand over your heart
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.960]  for other people's anthems, you do stand for them, which he is doing, so you just hear
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.600]  somebody in his ear, saying, hey Biden, listen, this is not our anthem, no, no, lower it down
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.480]  slow, don't let anybody notice that you put your hand up, you're in the wrong anthem, there,
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.480]  good, good.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.320]  You are a sly devil, you, oh, you are so smart, the big guy.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.960]  So I gotta have some comic relief, okay, let's get really, really serious right now.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.560]  I have withheld judgment and I could have easily on Sunday and Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.640]  and Thursday come on the show and said what I thought about the Titanic sub, the Titan,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.880]  that's now added a new attraction to that graveyard that people like to go visiting in the North
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.840]  Atlantic off the coast of Newfoundland.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.040]  But the fact that almost no one is buying the official story is interesting.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.400]  So I got mobbed the last three days, when I say mobbed, I was staying in a hotel near
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.560]  Tampa and I was having dinner with my folks yesterday, so the folks were with me, and
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.720]  we had literally half the restaurant come over and say, what's going on with the sub,
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.720]  we don't believe it.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.720]  And I had to say, I don't know yet, but I've got a good idea.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.280]  And I'd already made up my mind of probably what was going on yesterday afternoon, but
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.160]  I still didn't talk about it on air.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.880]  Now I've had some time last night and today to really think about it and look at it.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.320]  And what we do know is we were lied to as usual.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.480]  And the Navy specifically has incredible sonar that covers all the major oceans of Earth,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.160]  particularly that area in the Atlantic where all those Russian subs and things are and
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.480]  undersea cables.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.840]  And they have signature programs that tell them what type of craft it is just off of
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.680]  its movement from a great distance.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:06.280]  But also they know what an implosion sounds like, it's like an explosion going off underwater.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.640]  And they know what the sound of debris then hitting the bottom sounds like.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.360]  But it turns out they instantly knew that the sub had reportedly imploded Sunday when
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.400]  it was down near the Titanic.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.720]  And again, that's a heavily watched, heavily trafficked area of the Atlantic.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.440]  And they then also got the signature of its debris hitting the bottom.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.920]  So the Navy knew, and the Navy incident commander said it was instantly reported to Navy
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.880]  headquarters, which was then reported on up the chain.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.240]  So while Biden and the rest of them said we have no idea what's going on, certainly Biden
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.720]  doesn't ever know what's going on, but the people under them knew that the submarine had
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.160]  disappeared. Its radio link, its text link to the surface ended, and it was pretty clear
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.320]  that it was an implosion.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.600]  James Cameron, who's a big investor in the company, has come out and really manned up and
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.680]  said, you know, I don't like him, he's a leftist power grabbing environmentalist, we shall
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.280]  be depopulated, but he lives like a king.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.200]  But he came out and he said that he thought it was a terrible design of carbon fiber and
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.360]  titanium, but it was good for the earth.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.240]  And so they built a submarine not out of steel, not out of high, incredibly strong, pure
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.200]  titanium or something. No, they did it out of carbon fiber, which I thought carbon is
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.680]  bad, but it was a plastic submarine, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.360]  And so they went down their plastic submarine with their little plastic joystick.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.160]  And the owner said, we don't like to hire white men because they're bad.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.640]  That's OK. Well, whatever.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.080]  She had a bunch of white women and then bye bye submarine.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.720]  So very, very trendy.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.800]  We're very, very sad they're dead, if that's even true.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.520]  But I'll give you my take on that.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.800]  They now officially admit the giant Ukrainian NATO offensive has failed.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.840]  We have huge news on so many big fronts today.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.600]  It's going to be a powerful transmission.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.240]  I want to welcome all the folks that are watching via the river at Revival.com.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.720]  Two of our best selling nootropics or brain boosters are now back in stock at
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.480]  Impulwarestore.com and for a limited time, they're 50 percent off when you get them
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.680]  together or 40 percent off when you get them individually.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.160]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra, two separate formulas.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.880]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.280]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again, with no hangover or
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.760]  letdown. And the other is a very special proprietary formula.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.000]  That's Brain Force Ultra that hits really, really quick.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.800]  And I love it. It wears off in two to three hours.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.040]  So if I've got to work at night, I don't want to stay up all night.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.120]  I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.480]  I stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something and boom,
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.720]  writing an article or writing a book.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.080]  And then I get two, three hours of energy and then you're right to bed after it.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.520]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50 percent off by themselves or 40 percent
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.160]  off individually. A lot of people love these products.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.160]  They've got five star reviews.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.840]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.640]  50 percent off InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.400]  Thank you for joining us on this live original
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.240]  teleprompter free Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.760]  I'm coming to you from the West Coast of beautiful Florida,
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.400]  which is turning deeper and deeper red every day.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.600]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown's amazing
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.720]  church complex in the International Media Center.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.080]  You're very, very blessed to be here.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.680]  Revival dot com.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.720]  And of course, their church is the river.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.920]  It's a beautiful river.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.120]  It's a beautiful river.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.320]  It's a beautiful river.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.520]  It's a beautiful river.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.720]  It's a beautiful river.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.600]  And of course, their church is the river.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.280]  Plenty of parking, amazing security, great grounds.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.720]  I'll be here Sunday morning greeting people.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.920]  I'll be part of the service with Pastor Brown that kicks off at nine thirty.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.640]  And then I'm going to do a special thing.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.040]  He's invited me to hold an evening with Alex Jones.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.320]  And the doors open about six o'clock or so.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.920]  But at seven, it's going to start.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.600]  It's going to go for three, four hours
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.600]  over all the satellite feeds and video feeds at Revival dot com.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.560]  We're going to link that up on InfoWars dot com.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.000]  There's still time to load up the 10
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.160]  folk and get in the Beverly Hillbillies vehicle,
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.480]  because we are kind of that great part of the country from Georgia and Alabama
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.640]  and Mississippi and Louisiana and Florida, of course, many other areas.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.880]  And join us here at the river in Tampa.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.880]  OK, I tried to do it as that little first
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.080]  segment, but I always want to mention what's coming up.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.480]  And I normally get into like one or two
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.240]  of the stacks and then don't mention the seven or eight other stacks.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.280]  In this case, seven or eight, usually about 30 stacks in my office.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.480]  But I've only gone over about eight stacks a day.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.440]  So let me go ahead and just do this for you.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.840]  Let me let me tell you what's coming up.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.200]  I'm going to break down what really happened with the submarine as best I can.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.040]  This will be the best analysis you're going to get with what we know.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.240]  And we'll just cover the facts.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.200]  But the facts, as usual, show the government
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.080]  lied to us just out of hand because it's what they do.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.320]  And so we're going to be going over that because people want to know.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.480]  I have gotten hundreds of texts,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.560]  dozens of phone calls from friends and family and have been asked at.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:16.600]  Restaurants and hotels on the street and by the beach,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.160]  I was walking on the beach last night for exercise and got stopped five times
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.640]  asking what happened with a submarine.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.040]  So you want submarine, you're going to get submarine coming up
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.240]  in the last segment of this hour, I'm going to talk for 11 minutes
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.120]  on the submarine that is now part of the graveyard attraction
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.640]  on the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.920]  And we're very, very sad for the folks.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.640]  Now, I'm just supposed to not question thing.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.160]  I tell you, the general public thinks it didn't even happen.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.080]  And I'm going to tell you what I think
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.760]  really happened, and I think it's about the best info you're going to get.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.520]  I mean, we don't know.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.160]  That's part of this departmentalized system of deception.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.360]  We do know it was used as a distraction
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.960]  from the Biden impeachment that passed the House now on the committee
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.600]  for the official impeachment investigation to begin.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.720]  And it's a big distraction from all these
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.400]  whistleblowers that came out in the last three days from the IRS and from the FBI
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.920]  that, indeed, under Biden was getting money from the Chinese,
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.600]  the Russians, the Ukrainians, anybody else that would give it to them
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.800]  and giving it to the big guy, the big guy.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.800]  So we've got that news breaking impeachment resolution to remove Joe Biden
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.520]  from office, passes the House floor, got a whole stack on that.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.040]  Very, very important on the Biden
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.240]  crime family news and what I think is going to happen with that.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.440]  They're definitely getting him ready.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.160]  They even have Gavin Newsom now visiting the White House every few weeks,
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.000]  and they're now saying how great he is at the White House as they prepare to take off
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.200]  the old blown tire and put on the new American Psycho 2.0
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.760]  in charge there to run up against Trump, who they plan to put in jail,
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.600]  trying to accelerate all these kangaroo trials against him.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.560]  We've got a lot of key information on that front.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.280]  Coming up with Roger Stone,
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.440]  Roger Stone will be joining us
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.200]  to cover so much important news for part of the next hour.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.560]  Harrison Smith will also be joining us as well in the third hour.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.200]  Jade Eyre does the analysis of the new world order from their own documents.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.320]  She does every Friday in the fourth hour.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.840]  And then Owen Schreier can't do his show today.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.120]  Harrison Smith's doing it because he's in D.C. in court right now.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.240]  Did absolutely nothing.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.520]  Was there with me trying to stop people
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.920]  going to the Capitol on video instead of getting an award.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.440]  He is facing years in prison.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.040]  So we'll get an update, hopefully,
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.800]  unless he's been clapped in irons from him sometime the next hour.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.360]  I'm told to be getting out of court any minute now.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.080]  So that political president will be joining us, hopefully.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.040]  And then Alex Rosen is at it again.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.640]  He's a former college football player.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.120]  But more importantly, that ties in the stories.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.440]  Giant lineman looks like it looks like a Viking barbarian.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.520]  He went out to one of these events.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.960]  He's also a famous child predator capturer.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.400]  He literally hunts people.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.040]  He's got hundreds of them arrested on record.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.080]  It's credited with that.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.720]  He's now going out confronting Peter Cote's got big news on that.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.800]  And that, of course, was super viral in the last week.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.280]  Well, now he went to one of these vaccine
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.600]  pushing events and they attacked him for his speech.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.480]  A guy was trying to choke him.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.560]  So with one arm, he literally throws him 15 feet.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.600]  That's what a lineman does.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.160]  Literally just laughs at him and shoves him.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.920]  And the guy goes flying like he was a ragdoll.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.360]  So.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.640]  That's all that's all coming up today.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.400]  Alex Rosen, Roger Stone, Harrison Smith,
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.960]  Jay Dyer, political prisoner Owen Schroer and more here on The Alex Jones Show.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.080]  We're going to skip this network break so we have more time.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:45.800]  OK.
[00:11:46.817 --> 00:11:51.817]  Let me tell you what else is coming up today, because there's so much more.
[00:11:51.817 --> 00:11:57.817]  I mentioned the vaccine SHIELD, Simon vaccine, it's a
[00:11:57.943 --> 00:12:08.803]  DNA therapy, a very dangerous gene therapy, COVID jab SHIELD, Lord, Peter Hotez, he's like
[00:12:08.803 --> 00:12:13.883]  the mini-me of Fauci, like Russian dolls, I think Fauci's little, there's another little
[00:12:13.883 --> 00:12:19.163]  guy in there, COVID jab SHIELD, Peter Hotez attacks Alex Jones, claims he never took money
[00:12:19.163 --> 00:12:23.362]  from Big Pharma, now he's really jumped the shark on this one and he's playing a shell
[00:12:23.362 --> 00:12:29.263]  game because, we're going to break this down, how they actually operate when we start the
[00:12:29.263 --> 00:12:37.843]  next segment, but he says I take money from Bill Gates and the NIH, well, that's the top,
[00:12:37.843 --> 00:12:43.883]  they pay for policy and then the research is done, the dummy research that they've
[00:12:43.883 --> 00:12:51.423]  requested the outcome they want and then that is given back to Big Pharma that then produces
[00:12:51.423 --> 00:12:57.523]  the poison and is given liability protection by the NIH and by the federal government and
[00:12:57.523 --> 00:13:04.063]  the 1996 law that Reagan wrongfully signed and then the money travels back to Bill Gates
[00:13:04.063 --> 00:13:08.703]  and a few other big companies and his tax-free foundation, then he pays no taxes, so people
[00:13:08.703 --> 00:13:11.683]  always criticize that churches get to be tax-exempt because of the First Amendment, I think they
[00:13:11.683 --> 00:13:15.643]  obviously should be, Congress shall make no law respecting the established religion, prohibiting
[00:13:15.643 --> 00:13:20.303]  the franchise thereof, but what about Big Pharma being tax-exempt and that's really what's
[00:13:20.303 --> 00:13:28.383]  happening here is that Bill Gates brags, oh, I get 20 to 1 return on my vaccine, on
[00:13:28.383 --> 00:13:35.143]  my vaccine investment, should we dig the clip up and play it for you again, so Hotez has
[00:13:35.143 --> 00:13:43.643]  a lot, when I say a lot of nerve, I mean he has a lot of nerve to sit up there and tell
[00:13:43.643 --> 00:13:52.843]  the world that I am making this up and that he is preposterous, sure he's worth $35 million
[00:13:52.843 --> 00:13:59.443]  on record, that's just what he shows on his taxes, $35 million and the man is a pediatrician
[00:13:59.443 --> 00:14:04.283]  who runs a children's hospital, think guinea pigs and he thinks your children should be
[00:14:04.283 --> 00:14:08.043]  made to take the shots, like we put a compilation together out of Tucker Carlson's 15-minute
[00:14:08.043 --> 00:14:17.283]  program last night, it's clip 3 with Tucker playing clips of Hotez and responding to it,
[00:14:17.283 --> 00:14:25.043]  but it's just simply over-the-top incredible that Hotez thinks we're this dumb and is now
[00:14:25.043 --> 00:14:29.603]  really out of desperation because there were hundreds of millions of views just on Twitter
[00:14:29.603 --> 00:14:34.843]  alone of Joe Rogan and RFK Jr. exposing him, they now try to drag me in like, well, Jones
[00:14:34.843 --> 00:14:39.563]  is even more attacked, so I'll just say, oh look, the crazy man over here, Alex Jones
[00:14:39.563 --> 00:14:43.762]  is saying I'm bad, I'm good, I'm good, this is a guy, we're going to play the clip in
[00:14:43.762 --> 00:14:47.523]  a moment, it's the last in a series of clips we're about to see, where Peter Hotez says
[00:14:47.523 --> 00:14:51.803]  we need Homeland Security to arrest people that question these shots, you cannot question
[00:14:51.803 --> 00:14:57.443]  me, I am science, it's like when Emperor Palpatine in Star Wars says, I am the senate, I mean
[00:14:57.443 --> 00:15:01.923]  these guys are so arrogant and everything they said about the mask and the shots and
[00:15:01.923 --> 00:15:06.603]  all of it has been exposed, we're going to go to this little 4 minute, 53 second clip,
[00:15:06.603 --> 00:15:10.643]  I'm going to come back and break down why this guy is so desperate and why this is such
[00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:14.163]  a major bellwether sea change moment, here it is.
[00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:19.323]  It's all about mask compliance, that's going to be absolutely critical, because if you
[00:15:19.323 --> 00:15:24.762]  don't have masks, remember this virus aerosolizes, so even 6 feet is not enough, it can go 17,
[00:15:24.762 --> 00:15:29.803]  18 feet, several meters, what we really have to do is have vaccine mandates in the schools,
[00:15:29.803 --> 00:15:34.362]  we should have a rule that anyone who walks into a school over the age of 12, has to
[00:15:34.362 --> 00:15:40.883]  be vaccinated, this is the nature of the anti-vaccine movement in this country, it's somehow married
[00:15:40.883 --> 00:15:49.163]  now to far right wing extremism and white nationalist group, anyone who's unvaccinated
[00:15:49.163 --> 00:15:53.923]  and has been lucky enough to escape COVID, your luck is about to run out, and I call
[00:15:53.923 --> 00:15:59.523]  it anti-science aggression, coming from Senator Rand Paul, Senator Johnson, members of the
[00:15:59.523 --> 00:16:04.443]  House of Representatives, in addition to those two Senators, are killers.
[00:16:04.443 --> 00:16:09.203]  It's all about mask compliance, we must have vaccine mandates for children, take the vax
[00:16:09.203 --> 00:16:14.443]  or you will die, anyone who disagrees with me is a white nationalist and a killer and
[00:16:14.443 --> 00:16:17.723]  probably an agent of Putin, did we say probably?
[00:16:17.723 --> 00:16:22.683]  Let's revise that, certainly an agent of Putin, again, here is Dr. Peter Hotez.
[00:16:22.683 --> 00:16:29.483]  We're starting to see now those same anti-vaccine messages that's coming out of the US and now
[00:16:29.483 --> 00:16:33.643]  we're finding it in Africa and Latin America, and remember what the other reason we're
[00:16:33.643 --> 00:16:39.083]  seeing this is the Putin government has, this has been reported by US and British intelligence,
[00:16:39.083 --> 00:16:42.943]  has been piling on with this whole systematic program of what's being called weaponized
[00:16:42.943 --> 00:16:48.803]  health communications, trying to destabilize democracies with anti-vaccine, anti-science
[00:16:48.803 --> 00:16:51.022]  messages and targeting.
[00:16:51.022 --> 00:16:55.963]  So according to British and US intelligence, anyone who disagrees with Dr. Peter Hotez
[00:16:56.002 --> 00:17:02.002]  is a disloyal American working to destabilize our democracy on behalf of Vladimir Putin.
[00:17:02.002 --> 00:17:09.523]  Now by comparison, never in his life has Bobby Kennedy Jr. said anything half that demented.
[00:17:09.523 --> 00:17:13.523]  But keep in mind, Peter Hotez claims to have a valid medical license, he is allowed to
[00:17:13.523 --> 00:17:15.883]  treat patients.
[00:17:15.883 --> 00:17:20.123]  After a while, even MSNBC viewers were going to have some questions about a guy who talks
[00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:22.322]  like that, and apparently some of them did.
[00:17:22.322 --> 00:17:26.483]  As the lockdowns wore on, the population started to notice that many of the core claims
[00:17:26.483 --> 00:17:29.203]  the TV doctors were making were untrue.
[00:17:29.203 --> 00:17:30.483]  You'd only need one shot.
[00:17:30.483 --> 00:17:32.643]  If you got the shot, you would never get sick.
[00:17:32.643 --> 00:17:35.923]  You would never pass the virus to others and so on.
[00:17:35.923 --> 00:17:40.302]  They said these things, as you know, again and again, ultimately they were proven wrong,
[00:17:40.302 --> 00:17:41.802]  but they never admitted it.
[00:17:41.802 --> 00:17:45.203]  They just attacked the people who noticed.
[00:17:45.203 --> 00:17:50.663]  Here's Dr. Peter Hotez calling for the Biden administration to arrest anyone who questions
[00:17:50.663 --> 00:17:52.043]  the COVID vaccine.
[00:17:52.043 --> 00:17:57.763]  The Biden administration has to realize that anti-science is a killer, disinformation.
[00:17:57.763 --> 00:17:59.443]  It's not even just disinformation.
[00:17:59.443 --> 00:18:04.043]  This is an anti-science empire right now and we need homeland security, we need the Justice
[00:18:04.043 --> 00:18:05.043]  Department.
[00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:09.802]  We've really got to figure this out and Health and Human Services will not be able to figure
[00:18:09.802 --> 00:18:11.643]  this out on their own.
[00:18:11.643 --> 00:18:13.003]  It's not a medical problem.
[00:18:13.003 --> 00:18:14.403]  It's a law enforcement problem.
[00:18:14.403 --> 00:18:17.003]  They've doubted me, arrest them.
[00:18:17.003 --> 00:18:19.322]  It's a horrifying outburst if you think about it.
[00:18:19.322 --> 00:18:23.302]  If you were on tape saying something like that, you would be deeply ashamed.
[00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:25.123]  But Peter Hotez is not ashamed.
[00:18:25.123 --> 00:18:27.802]  He's become even more grandiose.
[00:18:27.802 --> 00:18:32.963]  Hotez has written a self-congratulatory new book called The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science,
[00:18:32.963 --> 00:18:35.842]  a scientist's warning, as if you were a scientist.
[00:18:35.842 --> 00:18:40.443]  Here's how Hotez describes himself in the book's promotional literature, quote, during
[00:18:40.443 --> 00:18:47.163]  the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, one renowned scientist in his famous bow tie, appearing daily
[00:18:47.163 --> 00:18:54.603]  on major news networks, such as MSNBC, NPR and BBC and others, Dr. Peter J. Hotez often
[00:18:54.603 --> 00:19:00.203]  went without sleep, working around the clock to develop a nonprofit COVID-19 vaccine and
[00:19:00.203 --> 00:19:02.203]  to keep the public informed.
[00:19:02.203 --> 00:19:06.723]  During that time, he was one of the most trusted voices on the pandemic and was even nominated
[00:19:06.723 --> 00:19:10.663]  for a Nobel Peace Prize for his selfless work.
[00:19:10.663 --> 00:19:15.923]  He also became one of the main targets of anti-science rhetoric that gained traction through conservative
[00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:20.203]  news media, end quote, though we could go on.
[00:19:20.203 --> 00:19:26.243]  So here you have a renowned scientist, selfless, trusted, going without sleep, self-denying,
[00:19:26.243 --> 00:19:29.203]  persecuted by extremists for daring to tell the truth.
[00:19:29.203 --> 00:19:31.923]  The Albert Schweitzer of cable news.
[00:19:31.923 --> 00:19:34.643]  That's Dr. Peter J. Hotez.
[00:19:34.643 --> 00:19:39.683]  The fact that a partisan buffoon like Peter Hotez can describe himself this way with a
[00:19:39.683 --> 00:19:45.083]  straight face and the backing of a publisher makes you despair for the country's future.
[00:19:45.243 --> 00:19:46.243]  But don't despair.
[00:19:46.243 --> 00:19:47.243]  There is hope.
[00:19:47.243 --> 00:19:51.243]  Hotez will never debate Bobby Kennedy, Jr., but it doesn't matter.
[00:19:51.243 --> 00:19:52.802]  Kennedy has already won.
[00:19:52.802 --> 00:19:57.123]  He's more honest than Dr. Peter Hotez, and that's obvious to anyone who's paying attention.
[00:19:57.123 --> 00:20:01.723]  A New Economist poll shows that Kennedy is more popular and far less hated than either
[00:20:01.723 --> 00:20:04.483]  major party frontrunner.
[00:20:04.483 --> 00:20:09.083]  After almost 20 years of being silenced, Bobby Kennedy, Jr. is being heard.
[00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:12.083]  All right.
[00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:15.203]  So I have five or six letters he's written.
[00:20:15.203 --> 00:20:20.603]  I have more than five other clips that I just found last night because I was making statements
[00:20:20.603 --> 00:20:25.283]  in the last few days that Peter Hotez wants to arrest you if you don't take the shot or
[00:20:25.283 --> 00:20:27.203]  you disagree with him.
[00:20:27.203 --> 00:20:28.923]  And people said that can't be true.
[00:20:28.923 --> 00:20:29.923]  And you just saw him say it.
[00:20:29.923 --> 00:20:33.643]  We've got a bunch of other clips we're going to get to.
[00:20:33.643 --> 00:20:34.822]  This is so criminal.
[00:20:34.822 --> 00:20:35.822]  This is so in America.
[00:20:35.822 --> 00:20:37.003]  This is so evil.
[00:20:37.003 --> 00:20:40.723]  Plus, everything they said the last three and a half years was a lie.
[00:20:40.723 --> 00:20:44.443]  And now they have this lie that 200,000 people died because they didn't hit the shots.
[00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:48.043]  That's completely pulled out of the air, like everything else they said and did.
[00:20:48.043 --> 00:20:50.523]  They knew these shots didn't protect you from COVID.
[00:20:50.523 --> 00:20:51.883]  They knew they would erase your immune system.
[00:20:51.883 --> 00:20:57.643]  I played you Pfizer executives three years ago on air over and over again saying, this
[00:20:57.643 --> 00:21:01.802]  is going to be great for business because as you take one shot, it lowers your immunity.
[00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:06.103]  Then you need another shot, another shot, and finally your immunity is totally gone.
[00:21:06.203 --> 00:21:08.663]  It's like a prophylactic.
[00:21:08.663 --> 00:21:10.103]  It's like cough syrup.
[00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:13.063]  It doesn't heal the cough, it just makes it go away for a little while.
[00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:17.842]  So yes, these shots in their own rig studies for a couple months might give a little protection.
[00:21:17.842 --> 00:21:22.503]  But then after it makes you get sicker, catch the virus, and can kill you easier, and any
[00:21:22.503 --> 00:21:26.063]  other virus can kill you, and it makes the population mutate.
[00:21:26.063 --> 00:21:30.943]  All these new viruses are giving a giant population during an outbreak a vaccine.
[00:21:30.943 --> 00:21:37.103]  That's why you could never give a shot for a cold during a pandemic of a cold because
[00:21:37.103 --> 00:21:39.463]  it makes it worse.
[00:21:39.463 --> 00:21:44.543]  These are epidemiologists, these are scientists, these are virologists, these are pathologists.
[00:21:44.543 --> 00:21:49.063]  They knew what they were doing, hurting the public and setting the precedent to weaponize
[00:21:49.063 --> 00:21:53.583]  big pharma and the media against the people and get away with murder.
[00:21:53.583 --> 00:21:57.223]  Because you can get away with murder, you can then do whatever you want, and you can
[00:21:57.223 --> 00:21:58.703]  play God.
[00:21:58.703 --> 00:22:03.143]  So you can read it all at InfoWars.com.
[00:22:03.143 --> 00:22:04.143]  You can see it all there.
[00:22:04.143 --> 00:22:09.663]  We've got some other huge news to cover, but COVID jab shill, Peter Hotez attacks Alex Jones,
[00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:11.663]  claims he never took money from big pharma.
[00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:16.023]  Go read the tweets for yourself, and the reason this is important is, this is getting picked
[00:22:16.023 --> 00:22:20.443]  up by the news everywhere, he lies and says, again, I took no money from them, and he goes
[00:22:20.443 --> 00:22:26.063]  on and says the shots still work, everything's great, and he doubles down and says we need
[00:22:26.063 --> 00:22:30.703]  to have Homeland Security come after us.
[00:22:30.703 --> 00:22:38.822]  Think about how arrogant this individual is, and he tweeted out this image from InfoWars.com,
[00:22:38.822 --> 00:22:41.743]  and he said, just a matter of time before InfoWars, Alex Jones joined the party.
[00:22:41.743 --> 00:22:43.463]  I was already in the party, buddy.
[00:22:43.463 --> 00:22:45.743]  Big pharma globalist gremlin, quite a mouthful.
[00:22:45.743 --> 00:22:50.263]  Well, you are a big pharma globalist gremlin, I mean, that's really what you are.
[00:22:50.263 --> 00:22:51.263]  Quite a mouthful.
[00:22:51.263 --> 00:22:56.583]  Nevermind, we don't take big pharma money, but make low-cost patent-free vaccines for
[00:22:56.583 --> 00:23:02.103]  global health bypassing big pharma, and one billion people awakened, impressed.
[00:23:02.103 --> 00:23:09.063]  Yeah, no, a billion views that I saw on different platforms attacking you and hating you, 95%
[00:23:09.063 --> 00:23:11.943]  of the comments against you, gremlin.
[00:23:11.943 --> 00:23:14.263]  So try to spend that all day, buddy boy.
[00:23:14.263 --> 00:23:19.023]  You're hated, and you know it, and along with Fauci and Bill Gates, people know who you are,
[00:23:19.183 --> 00:23:23.342]  and that's why your agenda of endless lockdowns, endless masks, and endless forced injections
[00:23:23.342 --> 00:23:28.063]  in your UN treaty is all in so much trouble, because humanity is waking up to you, and
[00:23:28.063 --> 00:23:31.862]  the same big pharma that pushes transgender surgeries, cutting the genitals off children
[00:23:31.862 --> 00:23:37.103]  and mutilating little girls, it's being banned by the UK, the EU is set to ban it, and we're
[00:23:37.103 --> 00:23:41.503]  going to ban it here as well, and the people pushing it are going to go to prison.
[00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:42.903]  This is all Emperor's New Clothes.
[00:23:42.903 --> 00:23:47.143]  For people who don't know the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, look it up, and that's
[00:23:47.143 --> 00:23:48.263]  exactly what's happening.
[00:23:48.263 --> 00:23:53.383]  The Emperor's New Clothes, story of the Emperor's New Clothes.
[00:23:53.383 --> 00:23:57.342]  Everybody knew they weren't spending Golden Fred cloth and clothing for him, but nobody
[00:23:57.342 --> 00:24:00.903]  wanted to admit it and be the one to tell the king he'd been conned, and that's how
[00:24:00.903 --> 00:24:06.103]  it works with people that buy into the system and get totally and completely conned by it.
[00:24:06.103 --> 00:24:07.822]  All right.
[00:24:07.822 --> 00:24:11.543]  More on that coming up, but I want to play just a small clip out of that clip again of
[00:24:11.543 --> 00:24:15.263]  him saying, we can't just have the media censor people.
[00:24:15.263 --> 00:24:17.342]  We can't just control the public.
[00:24:17.423 --> 00:24:18.822]  We've got to have Homeland Security.
[00:24:18.822 --> 00:24:19.822]  We've got to go after people.
[00:24:19.822 --> 00:24:23.383]  He's specifically written articles to Congress, written articles to Homeland Security that
[00:24:23.383 --> 00:24:28.383]  has been published by Baylor and the other universities he works with, calling as an
[00:24:28.383 --> 00:24:35.663]  academic head of infectious diseases to arrest people that point out he's a fraud.
[00:24:35.663 --> 00:24:37.583]  So he won't just debate.
[00:24:37.583 --> 00:24:38.783]  He says we don't need debate.
[00:24:38.783 --> 00:24:39.783]  In fact, he said that.
[00:24:39.783 --> 00:24:40.783]  I played it last week.
[00:24:40.783 --> 00:24:43.543]  He says debate is not part of science.
[00:24:43.543 --> 00:24:46.063]  Science is observation and debate.
[00:24:46.063 --> 00:24:50.623]  So this is gaslighting, ladies and gentlemen, but now it's not enough to say censor people
[00:24:50.623 --> 00:24:53.383]  and I won't debate because you can't defend yourself.
[00:24:53.383 --> 00:24:56.342]  Now you're saying that you want us arrested.
[00:24:56.342 --> 00:24:57.342]  Here it is.
[00:24:57.342 --> 00:25:02.862]  The Biden administration has to realize that that anti-science is a killer, disinformation.
[00:25:02.862 --> 00:25:04.543]  It's not even just disinformation.
[00:25:04.543 --> 00:25:08.143]  This is an anti-science empire right now, and we need Homeland Security.
[00:25:08.143 --> 00:25:10.063]  We need the Justice Department.
[00:25:10.063 --> 00:25:14.543]  We've really got to figure this out in the health and human services will not be able
[00:25:14.543 --> 00:25:16.063]  to figure this out on their own.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.940]  I'm sorry, Pastor Brown's right here talking to me.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.940]  Pastor Brown, come on over and talk to us real quick on air.
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.940]  Let me do this.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.940]  I'm going to go on a break in a few minutes and I can answer the question.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.940]  This guy works around the clock over here, I tell you.
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.940]  I got a whole...
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.940]  We ought to swing the cameras around and show my studio audience over here.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.940]  Now, there they are.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.940]  So, there he is.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.940]  Now, I want to get into...
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.940]  I want to get into the submarine.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.940]  And I want to get into a story much bigger.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.940]  But the submarine and these five dead people is very sad.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.940]  But in the aggregate, they decided to go risk their lives.
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.940]  They decided to do this in this experimental plastic design.
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.940]  Okay?
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.940]  It doesn't sound too smart to me.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.940]  The sub has been down to the Titanic now over 50 times.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.940]  They've done over 30 of these missions where people pay to go down there,
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.940]  if you believe it, and look at a tiny portal.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.940]  So, they put their life in their hands.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.940]  They're dead.
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.940]  Like a race car driver, sad they're dead, but they're dead.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.940]  But the fact that people don't buy the submarine,
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.940]  the fact that people don't buy the submarine,
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.940]  the fact that people don't buy the submarine,
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.940]  the fact that people don't buy the submarine,
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.940]  but the fact that people don't buy this shows how the official narrative
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.940]  is never believed anymore.
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.940]  The system has destroyed itself.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.940]  I mean, I tend to want to believe the official story.
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.940]  I tend to think, you know, why would they lie to us?
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.940]  But the system always lies, basically,
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.940]  99% of the time now,
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.940]  because it's always got some other agenda.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.940]  And it thinks by spinning a big story,
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.940]  it can get something out of it,
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.940]  like distracting the general population
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.940]  from what the globalists are doing
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.940]  and the Hunter Biden
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.940]  and Joe Biden
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.940]  whistleblower information coming out.
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.940]  So that's what this is really about.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.940]  But as I said, last segment of this hour,
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.940]  coming up in about 20 minutes,
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.940]  I will get into it all in great detail.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.940]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.940]  The Navy has acoustic equipment.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.940]  We said this back on Monday.
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.940]  They knew exactly when it blew up.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.940]  They knew exactly when it hit the bottom.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.940]  They have the signatures of it.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.940]  And now the Navy said, yeah, we knew Sunday.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.940]  We said the thing had imploded,
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.940]  but we passed it on.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.940]  So the government sat on the information,
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.940]  as usual, while the government
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.940]  wringed its hands and sent the Coast Guard
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.940]  out to look for them,
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.940]  knowing right where they were on the ocean floor.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.940]  So they did not let a good crisis
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.940]  go to waste.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.940]  They used it, bare minimum,
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.940]  as a huge political distraction.
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.940]  Like the boy stuck in the well
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.940]  becomes the biggest story in the world.
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.940]  But when one of these opportunities comes up,
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.940]  you bet they're going to distract,
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.940]  kind of like they indicted Trump
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.940]  on Hunter Biden came out.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.940]  So they do it over and over again.
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.940]  We're going to go on a break.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.940]  We're going to come back.
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.940]  We're going to get more into the rebellion
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.940]  against the so-called scientists
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.940]  that tell us we can't question them
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.940]  with Alex Rosen,
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.940]  who confronted Hotez just last week
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.940]  and has now confronted more of these folks
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.940]  yesterday in a new viral clip.
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.940]  He'll give us details of exactly where he was
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.940]  and what happened with the video
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.940]  you'll see on the other side.
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.940]  We are funded by viewers and listeners like you.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.940]  We make it easy with great products,
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.940]  books, films, T-shirts.
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.940]  My new best-selling book went up
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.940]  to number one on the New York Times.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.940]  They wouldn't admit that,
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.940]  but it was number one
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.940]  on all the other charts.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.940]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.940]  Learn about the New World Order's plan,
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.940]  Satan's plan, and what's unfolding
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.940]  with The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.940]  I call it the Death Star plans.

[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.940]  no, it's a few hundred left, excuse me.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.940]  And when those are gone, they're gone.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.940]  It's a fundraiser, so get The Great Reset
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.940]  and the War for the World, Infowarsstore.com

[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.940]  And we have our new amazing,
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.940]  well, it already came out once and sold out,
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.940]  but we have our new tumor toothpaste,
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.940]  amazing, no fluoride, still good for your teeth,

[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.940]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.940]  Infowarsstore.com
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.940]  is like a grocery store,
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.940]  or like a vitamin shop.

[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.940]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.940]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.940]  Hey, what's better, knockout?
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.940]  What's better, down and out?
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.940]  What's better, why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.940]  And the answer is,
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.940]  different herbal formulas, different compounds
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.940]  are better for different people.
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.940]  So, one person might like this
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.940]  coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.940]  That's how our bodies work, they're all very diverse.
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.940]  But we've been able to private label
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.940]  a national best seller

[00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.940]  You wanted to plug RainForce,
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.940]  do you like RainForce?
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.940]  Yeah, so, my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.940]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.940]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz,
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.940]  four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.940]  and now two books with Alex Jones?
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.940]  That's because I use
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.940]  RainForce every day.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.940]  What I always need is, I always need
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.940]  some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.940]  And so, you know, I try to exercise,
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.940]  eat well, take good vitamins,
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.940]  but the one thing that I have really found
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.940]  that makes a difference
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.940]  is RainForce. I'll take
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.940]  RainForce in the morning,
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.940]  right before I go to my computer,
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.940]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.940]  writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.940]  So it really is true that RainForce
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.940]  is something I use every day,
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.940]  and it helps me with my writing.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.940]  Alright, we love you. We'll be right back.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.940]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra,

[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:51.940]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.940]  You're going to want to pay attention
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.940]  to what I'm about to say
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.940]  in the next 60 seconds.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.940]  Two new incredible products
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.940]  are now available exclusively
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.940]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.940]  They are both clones of national
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.940]  best-selling products from a major
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.940]  pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.940]  that are listeners and patriots
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.940]  that are allowing us to private-label it
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.940]  at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.940]  It's Joint Relief Max
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.940]  and Nerve Renew.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.940]  Both of these
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.940]  have known, documented natural compounds
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.940]  to lower pain
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.940]  and to also make your nerves
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.940]  healthier, which is one of the major reasons
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.940]  nerves get irritated
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.940]  and are more inductive to pain.
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.940]  There's major research behind this all.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.940]  You need to get Joint Relief Max
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.940]  from Infowars MD

[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.940]  There are plenty of proven technologies
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.940]  in permaculture and biodynamics
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.940]  that will naturally keep the soil
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.940]  rich with iodine.
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.940]  And we need to ensure that we get
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.940]  the sufficient amount of iodine
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.940]  every day, derived from
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.940]  ancient sea salts found
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.940]  thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.

[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.940]  Pure, nascent iodine
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.940]  stabilized in an
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.940]  activated triiodine form
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.940]  for a healthy thyroid
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.940]  and a healthy metabolism.

[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:09.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:19.570]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:23.570]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.570]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:35.570]  Alright, so, early this morning, I'm scanning through the internet, going over news, and I see a headline.
[00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:40.570]  Alex Jones confronts Anthony Fauci.
[00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.570]  Here it is right here.
[00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.570]  And I go, that's not Alex Jones, that's Alex Rosen.
[00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:49.570]  And so, then, I said, well, that's weird.
[00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:55.570]  And I thought, we'll call Alex Rosen about this, who just went viral last week, politely going and talking to Hotez,
[00:33:55.570 --> 00:34:04.570]  Peter Hotez, who's the mini-me of Fauci, and is now out there saying that he, again, is not invested and is not involved with Big Pharma at all.
[00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:08.569]  He just takes money from Bill and Melinda Gates and the NIH that own the patents and control it all.
[00:34:08.569 --> 00:34:14.569]  So, yeah, he goes above Big Pharma, right to the people actually making it and producing it, and coming out and targeting it.
[00:34:14.569 --> 00:34:17.569]  He wants to put us in jail. He wants to make us take it.
[00:34:17.569 --> 00:34:19.569]  He says he owns our bodies. He censors us.
[00:34:19.569 --> 00:34:25.569]  And the man is a complete monster, a would-be totalitarian dictator.
[00:34:25.569 --> 00:34:31.569]  So, Dr. Fauci gets feisty with Alex Jones, who throws him 400 yards.
[00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:34.569]  And, of course, no, it's not Alex Jones.
[00:34:34.569 --> 00:34:39.569]  It's Alex Rosen, who's, like, a foot taller than me and a lot bigger than I am.
[00:34:39.569 --> 00:34:45.569]  So, now, like, any guy that has a beard and kind of a round head is Alex Jones.
[00:34:45.569 --> 00:34:46.569]  I see this all the time.
[00:34:46.569 --> 00:34:51.569]  Remember, I got banned on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram for not just being mean to Oliver Darcy.
[00:34:51.569 --> 00:34:59.569]  The lawyer for Twitter went on Joe Rogan and read the three things I was banned.
[00:34:59.569 --> 00:35:05.569]  He said, being mean to a child, a guy that looked like me with a beard on ABC News in Missouri,
[00:35:05.569 --> 00:35:07.569]  a 12-year-old kid is punching him.
[00:35:07.569 --> 00:35:09.569]  So, the guy punches him and throws him to the ground.
[00:35:09.569 --> 00:35:14.569]  And they said that was me and ran national headlines that I beat a kid up in Missouri.
[00:35:14.569 --> 00:35:16.569]  I mean, the guy doesn't even really look like me.
[00:35:16.569 --> 00:35:22.569]  But here it is, Alex Jones, you know, asks Fauci a question and then throws a guy 400 yards.
[00:35:22.569 --> 00:35:26.569]  So, I thought we would actually find out what was going on here.
[00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:28.569]  I'll probably get banned on more stuff for this.
[00:35:28.569 --> 00:35:29.569]  I wasn't right here.
[00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:30.569]  I attacked everybody.
[00:35:30.569 --> 00:35:33.569]  But here is Alex Rosen, who didn't attack anybody,
[00:35:33.569 --> 00:35:37.569]  going last week in the super mega viral clip because he lives right by him
[00:35:37.569 --> 00:35:40.569]  and talking to the guy that wants to arrest us for free speech who won't debate.
[00:35:40.569 --> 00:35:41.569]  Here he is.
[00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:42.569]  OK.
[00:35:42.569 --> 00:35:43.569]  Oh, are you Peter Hotez?
[00:35:43.569 --> 00:35:44.569]  I am.
[00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:45.569]  Hi.
[00:35:45.569 --> 00:35:46.569]  Nice to meet you.
[00:35:46.569 --> 00:35:47.569]  How are you?
[00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:48.569]  Hey.
[00:35:48.569 --> 00:35:50.569]  So, why are you not, like, going to debate RFK on Joe Rogan's podcast?
[00:35:50.569 --> 00:35:51.569]  Oh, come on.
[00:35:51.569 --> 00:35:52.569]  That's harassing.
[00:35:52.569 --> 00:35:53.569]  I'm just curious.
[00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:54.569]  What?
[00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:55.569]  Nothing hostile, just curious.
[00:35:55.569 --> 00:35:57.569]  I haven't said anything one way or the other.
[00:35:57.569 --> 00:35:59.569]  I mean, are you planning on doing it?
[00:35:59.569 --> 00:36:02.569]  You know, he just invited me, so we'll see.
[00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:04.569]  And I think you should, though.
[00:36:04.569 --> 00:36:06.569]  Well, we'll give it some thought.
[00:36:06.569 --> 00:36:07.569]  OK.
[00:36:07.569 --> 00:36:09.569]  And what do you have to say to people who think they're vaccine injured?
[00:36:09.569 --> 00:36:10.569]  Oh, come on.
[00:36:10.569 --> 00:36:11.569]  Anything for them?
[00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:12.569]  Don't come to my house.
[00:36:12.569 --> 00:36:15.569]  I mean, do you have anything to say to people that think?
[00:36:15.569 --> 00:36:18.569]  Do you have anything to say to people?
[00:36:18.569 --> 00:36:19.569]  Yeah.
[00:36:19.569 --> 00:36:22.569]  I mean, do you think vaccine injuries are real, Peter?
[00:36:22.569 --> 00:36:25.569]  Peter, it's just a question.
[00:36:26.569 --> 00:36:28.569]  Settle the science now.
[00:36:28.569 --> 00:36:31.569]  On a safari to go vaccinate more kids.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.560]  Now that's from last week.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:43.560]  And he got demonized for daring to go talk to the public's figure that won't debate who wants his critics arrested.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.560]  We played the clip earlier twice. He's saying it all over.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.560]  He's writing official letters calling for opposition or questioning science to be arrested.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.560]  You've heard that the left says question man-made global warming.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.560]  You should be arrested. In fact, they're starting to arrest people in the EU and the UK.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.560]  Oh, so there's only two genders arrested in Canada arrested in the UK.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.560]  These people are tyrants. 110 percent.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.560]  But it turns out this clip is from last year and it is Fauci being confronted by Alex Rosen.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:17.560]  But now, because Rose has exploded even more than his predator hunting, it's come back up.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:22.560]  So what is old is new. Here is the clip.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.560]  Ma'am, I have a question. So Pfizer has the biggest criminal fine in history.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.560]  So how is it not anti? How is it anti-science to not trust them?
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.560]  If they're on record bribing physicians and fudging with test results, 2.3 billion dollar fine.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.560]  So how is it anti-science to simply question them?
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.560]  Can you explain that, please?
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.560]  So I appreciate your comment. I'd like to finish my presentation and you can hold your questions.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.560]  I mean, it's not going to be answered. I have four questions.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.560]  I have four questions that didn't get answered.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.560]  What are you doing?
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.560]  No, no, no, no, please.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.560]  Oh, my God.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.560]  Your ring. Your ring just rolled.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.560]  It's right here. It's right here.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.560]  Got it? You OK?
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:15.259]  All right, so we're now joined by Alex Rosen. People that don't know who he is. He is one
[00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:19.540]  of the most prominent, successful people that's put hundreds of pedophiles behind bars as
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:23.700]  a private citizen. He's only been doing it four years. Started out when he was a college
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:28.299]  football player, and he wanted to see if it was true. He started posting profiles and
[00:38:28.299 --> 00:38:33.299]  instantly had pedophiles hitting him up. But now he's not just being demonized by the
[00:38:33.299 --> 00:38:37.980]  pedophiles, who, by the way, have powerful friends. He's not being demonized for confronting
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:42.899]  Hotez. But recap what happened with Hotez, any new aftermath since we talked to you last
[00:38:42.899 --> 00:38:49.660]  Friday, my friend, and then a breakdown for us and the viewers, any new developments,
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.140]  and then tie it back into this event that happened last year that's just now getting
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.140]  attention.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:39:02.020]  Yeah, so basically, since Peter Hotez, nothing's really happened with me. He's just been more
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:07.060]  in the spotlight, which I guess that's what I wanted the video to accomplish, people still
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:12.180]  talking about him, because you know how it is. I mean, we just see all this damning evidence
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:16.379]  coming out about any which thing, and then it all gets forgotten the next day. But with
[00:39:16.379 --> 00:39:20.020]  Peter Hotez, we're still talking about him today, which is I'm glad the video helped
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:25.859]  accomplish that, because he's right up there with Fauci when it comes to being corrupt
[00:39:25.859 --> 00:39:26.859]  and just crooked.
[00:39:26.859 --> 00:39:31.299]  So I'm glad that's happening. But yeah, as for me, no, no phone calls or anything like
[00:39:31.299 --> 00:39:34.980]  that, just death threats on Twitter, which I just find really cute and hilarious. But
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:41.259]  yeah, so last year, this was at a vaccine symposium at Rice University that Peter Hotez
[00:39:41.259 --> 00:39:45.100]  was speaking at. Sadly, I didn't get to confront him face to face then, because I actually
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.740]  had to go do something before he spoke. So I had to just confront like some poor college
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:53.859]  kid. But regardless, it would have been the same question anyway, and none of them would
[00:39:53.859 --> 00:39:57.540]  have answered it. So no difference in that regard.
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:02.779]  But yeah, I mean, I kind of got snuck into this vaccine event at Rice University, and
[00:40:02.779 --> 00:40:06.220]  I came in with a mask and like, you know, a little pride shirt or whatever to kind of
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:11.299]  blend in. And, you know, I just decided to, I thought it was the right time to ask that
[00:40:11.299 --> 00:40:15.779]  question because they had a questioning part. But the thing is, they're so sneaky with it.
[00:40:15.779 --> 00:40:18.660]  And this is why I went to Peter Hotez's house and one of the other reasons, because they
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:23.700]  never answer questions on Twitter. They never just, they never answer any counter questions.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:28.060]  So you could text your question in, and they would read it on screen and answer it during
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.660]  a question and answer period. So I texted the same question I asked. They're a very
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.220]  similar question. And of course, they ignored that question. So I'm like, all right, well,
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.660]  I got to go. And I also got to get this question answered and see what they say. So I'm just
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:45.859]  gonna go ask it like this. So I did. And obviously, there's no answers. It's a lot of anger from
[00:40:45.859 --> 00:40:51.299]  a Dr. Fauci lookalike who probably has a lot of stock at Big Pharma. And he starts choking
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:56.819]  which was probably an act of racism, I think. And, you know, I'm like, what the heck's going
[00:40:56.819 --> 00:41:00.339]  on? And so I just start giggling and I push him on the ground. I didn't mean to do that.
[00:41:00.339 --> 00:41:03.700]  But like, you know, he went flying. And, you know, these bachelors aren't that strong.
[00:41:04.259 --> 00:41:08.500]  And yeah, so that kind of went viral in October of last year. Now it's kind of getting attention
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:13.620]  again after confronting Peter Hotez. And yeah, and it just goes to show you that whenever you
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.220]  question the quote unquote science, that's how they'll react. And that's how they want to react.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.060]  Like it's not an exaggeration when they say, oh, you should, I mean, that guy would put me
[00:41:21.379 --> 00:41:25.540]  in jail in two seconds. Like if I did anything else but push him, he probably would have tried
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:29.060]  to press charges on me. But luckily, the cops asked me if I wanted to press charges. And I
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:34.180]  just really didn't have the time for that. But- Well, he goes for your camera and he's choking,
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:38.980]  and he's choking you. I mean, he's a good little minion of Hotez and Bill Gates. I mean,
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:43.220]  they all want to shut down speech. They're very un-American people, very dangerous.
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:50.899]  Oh, I 100% agree. I mean, I don't know why. I can't understand the thought process of that
[00:41:50.899 --> 00:41:57.540]  guy being so angry that he wanted to try to choke me. But it literally goes to show you they're not
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:01.620]  pro-science to save lives because they obviously didn't care about my life in that case. I mean,
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.740]  he wanted to literally choke me. I mean, that's how you can kill someone, not saying he would
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:09.220]  come close to killing me, but that's how you can. So they're not like pro-life. They're not
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:13.140]  pro-science because they care about life. They're pro-science because they care about their ego
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:18.339]  and narcissism. And I think that's a very big difference. Well, we got to go to break, but do
[00:42:18.339 --> 00:42:21.859]  a few more minutes on the other side. I'm going to see if we get an update from Owen Troyer, who
[00:42:21.859 --> 00:42:28.180]  just got out of court as well. But we have with us Alex Rosen of Predator Poachers on Rumble and
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:33.140]  at I Fight for Kids on Twitter. The guy is an absolute hero. How many hundreds, and you're
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:38.020]  not bragging, but it's a success rate for folks. And praise God. How many, because I know you get
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.460]  all these awards from law enforcement, how many pedophiles have you and your team put behind bars?
[00:42:42.899 --> 00:42:47.140]  I lost count of that. I just know we have an arrest in 43 different states. And this coming
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:52.020]  trip, we're going to try to get 44 and 45 in Massachusetts and Maine. So we'll see how that goes.
[00:42:53.299 --> 00:42:56.580]  All right, we'll be right back with Alex Rosen. I'll tell you what really happened in my view
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:01.859]  with the submarine and what's happening with the Ukrainian. Two amazing nootropics, that means
[00:43:01.859 --> 00:43:09.460]  brain power, are back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com and they're both 50% off. We haven't offered these

[00:45:03.379 --> 00:45:07.540]  of mouth and prayer. All the success that we've had together against the globalists,
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:12.580]  the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:17.460]  Humanity has a real fighting chance. I just want to thank you all for buying products

[00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.220]  Please take action.
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.379]  You wanted to plug BrainForce. Do you like BrainForce?
[00:46:01.379 --> 00:46:06.180]  Yeah. So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley. How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:10.180]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:15.859]  and now two books with Alex Jones. That's because I use BrainForce every day.
[00:46:15.859 --> 00:46:21.939]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning. And so I try to exercise,
[00:46:21.939 --> 00:46:28.100]  eat well, take good vitamins. But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:33.460]  is BrainForce. I'll take BrainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:37.060]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:43.140]  So it really is true that BrainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:46.979]  All right. We love you. We'll be right back. Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra,
[00:46:46.979 --> 00:46:50.740]  and TurboForce at InfoWarsTour.com. We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:58.420]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:28.780]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide, Roger Stone is coming
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:29.780]  up next hour.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.660]  We'll have an update from Owen Schroyer, who was just in court as well.
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:38.060]  You've seen the spin that an InfoWars reporter pleads guilty to attacking the Capitol.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:41.120]  I guess Alex Jones really did orchestrate the attack.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.120]  I guess the D.C.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.540]  Homeland Security's right that Jones should be indicted.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:50.960]  No, Owen was with me there and tried to stop people going in the building.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.620]  And they charged him for unlawfully being on the grounds of the Capitol.
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:58.260]  And he's already spent two years fighting it.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:01.900]  And they said, OK, we're going to have a jury trial and try to put you in jail for years
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:06.340]  if you do not plead guilty to at least a misdemeanor.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:07.620]  And I'm told that's what he did today.
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:08.620]  But he just got out of court.
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.780]  We'll get an update from him, hopefully, while Roger's on next hour.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.340]  But the way they spin this, I mean, what do you expect them to do?
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.140]  He's already been up in D.C. like eight times for court.
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.700]  He's already spent all this money on lawyers for nothing.
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:23.340]  And then the left spins it like we're criminals, like we did something.
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:28.660]  No, the deep state and the D.C. police, along with the feds, orchestrated the break-in.
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.700]  And you know you did it, and you've been caught.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:33.620]  And now members of Congress have seen the video they've not released.
[00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:35.500]  And according to these members of Congress, I have the articles right here.
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:39.340]  They're going to be releasing the full Capitol videos in the next few weeks.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:43.340]  And McCarthy has said they will two months ago, but now we're told it's imminent by some
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:47.220]  credible members of Congress, MTG, you name it.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.940]  I've got several of them right here.
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.340]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:56.340]  But man, I tell you, that's why they're so desperate to prop up their January 6th narrative,
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:00.140]  because imagine when it comes out, just like Russiagate and all of it, that they're the
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:03.020]  ones actually engaged in all this criminal activity.
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.940]  That is going to be absolutely massive.
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:11.340]  Now, I have been frustrated this entire hour, and I kept thinking, why am I frustrated?
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.860]  I'm about to go back to Alex Rosen to finish up here, and we appreciate him.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:19.500]  And I'm like, it's because I did not cover our top story at the beginning of the show,
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:23.780]  and I've spent almost no time on it, and it's really the biggest news.
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:27.140]  There's two articles of the biggest news.
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:31.380]  All over the world, they're not just banning transitioning children forcibly, which is
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.380]  beyond pedophilia.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:33.740]  They're literally maiming them.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.740]  I mean, what if a pedophile cut a child's penis off?
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.300]  You'd be like, that's the worst pedophile ever.
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.300]  He didn't just rape him.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.380]  But then it's, oh, but the doctors cut it off, it's wonderful.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:48.420]  There's major moves to ban that, and major moves in the hockey league to not have all
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:56.020]  the LGBTPS, S is not for Satan, brainwashing, and the National Hockey League has announced
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.020]  no more of that.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.140]  So that's a huge victory.
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.260]  But that's not the big story.
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.940]  It's this one.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.260]  And I've confirmed it.
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:08.940]  The entire Ukrainian offensive has been smashed, and now they're talking about peace deals,
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.780]  which is good to stop World War III.
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:15.660]  So I'll talk about that next hour after Roger Stone leaves us, and I'll get into the submarine.
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.660]  I promise to do that.
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:20.380]  But I wanted to finish up with Alex Rosen right now, Predator Hunter.
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:28.740]  What do you make of Hotez refusing to debate a week and a half after you politely confronted
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:33.300]  him and it being the top news story for three or four days, not just here, but in the world?
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:38.300]  I mean, it hurt him so bad in public opinion that they won't debate and that he says science
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.540]  is not about debating when that's the opposite.
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:45.340]  And then now he's doubling down saying there's this corrupt evil combine that works for the
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:51.220]  Russians with no proof and that we need homeland security to go after people that question
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.220]  anything he says.
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:54.900]  I mean, that is outrageously totalitarian.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.420]  Everybody knows that's what the bad guys say.
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.700]  Yeah, I know.
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:00.700]  It's pure desperate.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.580]  It's pure desperation for him at this point.
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:08.780]  I mean, he's clinging on to going on to like MSNBC, like his only safe space left.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:13.100]  I mean, I think the most damning evidence on him is that compilation of him saying,
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.100]  oh, it's two shots.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.100]  Oh, it's three shots.
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.100]  Oh, it's four shots.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.100]  Even.
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.100]  Oh, it's five shots.
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:22.580]  I mean, I think at this point, even the normies like I mean, my parents, for example, I mean,
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.580]  they got the first vaccine.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.700]  I didn't get any, but they're I mean, they see through it now.
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.420]  I mean, all the normies are seeing through it and all Peter Hotez has left to cling on
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.740]  is just as like little university PhDs and stuff like that.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.380]  I mean, he knows he knows the game's over.
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:41.220]  And, you know, I think him going on Rogan, I don't think he would do any justice for him
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:42.220]  at this point.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:46.540]  Like, I think he already knows jigs up and all he can do is just hope that we get scared
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:47.940]  into compliance.
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:52.300]  But I mean, the more they threaten like, oh, the DHS should arrest people like us who just
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.020]  question him, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:57.540]  And the more it just doesn't happen, I think people are just starting to get sick and tired
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.540]  of it.
[00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:01.140]  And it's just becoming a comedy spectacle at this point from him.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.140]  Well, absolutely.
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:07.740]  And there's a short RFK Jr. clip that I wanted to play yesterday, but I forgot to.
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:11.660]  It's about a minute, 20 seconds long.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:15.700]  And I want to end this interview by playing that for Alex.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:21.300]  But first, let's play just the end of that compilation we put together from Tucker Carlson's
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:24.900]  piece last night on the medical tyranny.
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.460]  And we already played the whole thing earlier.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:30.580]  He says these are Russian agents, U.S. intelligence needs to stop them.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.460]  We know Putin is the one running these people.
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:38.460]  Joe Rogan is part of a dangerous fascist organization.
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:41.740]  I mean, Joe Rogan is a pot smoking liberal, folks.
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.860]  He just sees these tyrants and says, whoa, you're the bad guys.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:49.540]  OK, so when you lose people like Joe Rogan, you've really lost the plot here.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:52.020]  So now Joe Rogan's a Russian agent, too.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:53.020]  He's a real communist, too, folks.
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:57.020]  That's why he's worth over a billion bucks, between you and me, you and the fence post.
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:02.100]  So let's go ahead and play just the end part where, again, he says it's a homeland security
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.100]  issue.
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:04.100]  Here we go.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:08.700]  Biden administration has to realize that that anti-science is a killer, disinformation.
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.380]  It's not even just disinformation.
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.980]  This is an anti-science empire right now, and we need homeland security.
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:15.900]  We need the Justice Department.
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:20.740]  We've really got to figure this out, and Health and Human Services will not be able to figure
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:21.620]  this out on their own.
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:29.860]  So, how do you respond to that, Alex, because he said that at least 20 times we know of,
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:32.500]  four or five times on air we have clips and we have a bunch of news articles and letters
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:33.780]  he's written.
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:37.060]  Last week when you pointed that out, people said, that's not true, Rosen.
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.660]  That's not true, Alex.
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:39.660]  He never said that.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.140]  People are like, he didn't say arrest people that don't agree with him.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:44.140]  And yes, he does.
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.660]  I mean, how does that not fully discredit these people?
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:51.140]  Yeah, I mean, it's just a massive insecurity coming out from him.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.140]  I mean, like I said last time, it's revenge of the nerds.
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:57.340]  I mean, he just, basically he just can enlist, like, you know, strong men to go do things
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:58.340]  for him because he's a weak man.
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.500]  I mean, he can't just tell, I mean, he didn't tell me to my face he should be arrested.
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:04.140]  He just kind of smiles and giggles at me and walks away.
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:05.980]  I mean, they could, they could never say this to our face.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.940]  I'm not even saying it as like a physical thing.
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:11.380]  They just don't have the guts to just confront us man to man and say I should go to jail
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:13.260]  for simply talking to him.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:18.620]  But yeah, I mean, looping in Joe Rogan with like fascism and Russia.
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:22.660]  So I mean, one, I mean, my last name is Rose and I'm like a Jew.
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.780]  So calling me like a Nazi, whatever.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.740]  I mean, that's like the total opposite.
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.980]  Then like you said, Joe Rogan's like, Oh, that's what I forgot.
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:29.980]  You've been called a Nazi.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.900]  I saw that everywhere.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.060]  You've been called a Nazi.
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.060]  Are you a Nazi?
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:37.860]  Oh, I mean, I'm like the only Jewish Nazi apparently.
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:42.620]  I mean, according to them, I guess, but yeah, I mean, that's just so ridiculous.
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:46.340]  But like, yeah, I mean, like then, I mean, is he trying to call Joe Rogan like a skinhead
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.340]  or something?
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:48.340]  Is that a connection he's trying to make?
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:51.180]  It's just kind of like, I mean, he's just grasping at straws.
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.180]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:55.700]  Like the UFC was like a far right fascist, like political party.
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:55:00.260]  But yeah, I mean, it's just very strange at this point.
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:04.580]  And then the fact that he would call like RFK, like working for Russia.
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:06.980]  I mean, it's just it's just so weird.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:07.980]  It's just very it's very strange.
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.780]  He's put out tweets as you know.
[00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:22.470]  It's just very strange that he can work for Bill Gates and he can work for the most corrupt
[00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:24.350]  medical companies in the country.
[00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:31.950]  Pfizer has the biggest criminal fine in history and Peter Hotez sees nothing wrong with pushing
[00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:34.550]  their shot and he thinks we should be trustworthy.
[00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:39.830]  So if Putin is like a lying, whatever, lying evil person, how is Pfizer not, when they
[00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:43.830]  were charged, ironically charged by the same federal government, that he wants to go after
[00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:44.830]  us?
[00:55:44.830 --> 00:55:48.509]  Wow, Alex, thank you so much for the time.
[00:55:48.509 --> 00:55:49.509]  Great job.
[00:55:49.509 --> 00:55:50.509]  I fight for kids.
[00:55:50.509 --> 00:55:51.750]  On Twitter, follow him, support him.
[00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:52.750]  You're amazing, sir.
[00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:58.110]  I'm going to end this hour with this RFK Jr. clip, it's only a minute and a half long.
[00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:03.190]  I think it completely nails everything we're facing, a biomedical tyranny, the end of our
[00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:05.990]  freedoms, Operation Lockstep, UN Power Grab.
[00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:07.390]  This is world government.
[00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:08.550]  Hour number two is coming up.
[00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:12.029]  I'm at the River Church in Tampa, Revival.com.
[00:56:12.029 --> 00:56:14.670]  I'm going to be at the Sunday service, 930.
[00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:17.230]  It's open, free to the public, great security, great place.
[00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:20.070]  And I'm going to be at a special nighttime event, seven o'clock Sunday.
[00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:21.070]  So be here.
[00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:22.070]  We're going to go to break.
[00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:23.070]  Be back next hour.
[00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:29.870]  They're going to have the right to compel unwanted medical interventions on us.
[00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:34.630]  We, the Nazis did that in the camps in World War II.
[00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:38.470]  They tested vaccines on gypsies and Jews.
[00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:45.470]  And the world was so horrified after the war, we signed the Nuremberg Charter.
[00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:53.430]  And we all pledged when we do that, we would never again impose unwanted medical interventions
[00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:58.509]  on human beings without informed consent.
[00:56:58.509 --> 00:57:06.110]  And yet in two years, all of that conviction has suddenly disappeared.
[00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:12.870]  People are walking around in masks where the science has not been explained to them.
[00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:17.710]  They are doing what they're told.
[00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:23.630]  These government agencies are orchestrating obedience, and it is not democratic.
[00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:26.470]  It's not the product of democracy.
[00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:34.830]  It's the product of a pharmaceutical-driven biosecurity agenda that will enslave the entire
[00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:44.070]  human race and plunge us into a dystopian nightmare where the apocalyptic forces of
[00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:49.509]  ignorance and greed will be running our lives and ruining our children.
[00:57:49.509 --> 00:57:55.230]  A lot of people have asked me, why is MFOR stored in MFOR's life, not in a probiotic
[00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:56.230]  for more than three years?
[00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.990]  The answer is simple.
[00:57:57.990 --> 00:58:00.550]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:04.750]  We had a top-maker, top-certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:09.990]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones,
[00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.990]  anymore.
[00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:16.430]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:20.430]  We're able to private label it under MFOR's MD as our probiotic formula.

[00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:07.910]  at MFORstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:13.950]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:16.070]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:21.550]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:26.430]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you
[00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:27.430]  name it.
[00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:31.110]  It is the super fuel.
[00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:32.590]  Brain Force Plus is great.
[00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:33.590]  Brain Force Ultra is great.
[00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:34.590]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:59:34.590 --> 00:59:37.910]  They go good with this, but this is the King Kong.
[00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:39.870]  This is the boss.
[00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:51.470]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, MFORstore.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[00:59:51.470 --> 01:00:10.350]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:19.470]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen, into our number two of this Friday, June 23rd,
[01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:20.470]  2023 broadcast.
[01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:26.310]  Well, we just had Alex Rosen on, famous pedophile hunter, who's also been going out and confronting
[01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:32.350]  Fauci and his mini-me, Dr. Peter Hotez and more.
[01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:39.029]  But now I want to shift gears out of that important area into what we're going to be covering
[01:00:39.029 --> 01:00:40.029]  this hour.
[01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:45.130]  And I want to welcome all the new viewers and all the new listeners that are joining
[01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:47.910]  us here today.
[01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.710]  I want to welcome all the folks that watch Pastor Rodney Howard Brown's great satellite
[01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:57.190]  feeds, internet feeds, and cable TV feeds at Revival.com.
[01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:01.430]  And of course, off of all those great satellite feeds, I want to welcome them all to the feed,
[01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:04.430]  because he's putting us out on all his feeds very, very graciously.
[01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:07.630]  He really is a great guy, one of the most demonized preachers out there, because he's
[01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:11.029]  been taking on the globalists, the New World Order, since the early 1990s.
[01:01:11.029 --> 01:01:13.550]  I mean, he's been popular since the late 80s.
[01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:18.870]  But right away, because he lived under tyranny in South Africa, seen a lot of upheaval, he
[01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:23.910]  began to smell out the New World Order with Herbert Walker Bush and then the Clintons and
[01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:24.910]  the rest of it.
[01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:28.630]  He's been talking about the Great Awakening for longer than I have.
[01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:34.510]  I've been on the air since 1994, but reached no traction until 95, and then 96.
[01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:38.590]  By the end of 96, got a local radio show, and then got syndicated by 98, and the rest
[01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:39.590]  is history.
[01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:43.069]  But it's not about who got there first or who did it first.
[01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:48.029]  The reason I point out that he's been doing it longer, that he's been awake to that a
[01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:53.350]  long time, is that's why he's under attack constantly by a lot of the establishment churches
[01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:54.350]  and media.
[01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:58.390]  That's why he recognizes that when I'm under attack, that that means there's something
[01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:00.830]  important there.
[01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:07.390]  We've really reached a Rubicon here where being a black sheep or being attacked or being
[01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:16.510]  lied about by the system is really a badge of courage and a badge of honor for people
[01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:18.110]  like that.
[01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:21.150]  And so he's just dead on about the New World Order and what's happening until people don't
[01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:25.950]  wear the mask, advising folks that he wouldn't take the shot, saying it's a lie, and he's
[01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:26.950]  vindicated.
[01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:34.029]  But he was doing that three years and four months ago or so, and so were we.
[01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:37.069]  Right when the hysteria and the fear was starting, right in the middle of it, we told you what
[01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:38.750]  was going on.
[01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:39.750]  We've been vindicated again.
[01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:41.750]  And that's why you see...
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:48.400]  Fauci's mouthpiece saying, I need to be arrested, Joe Rogan needs to be arrested, RFK Jr. needs
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.560]  to be arrested.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.840]  Because we're telling you not to believe these liars.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.840]  They're liars.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:56.320]  And they always have some new lie.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.160]  But now they're not saying the shot's 98% effective.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.520]  Now they're saying, well, you can't get the virus if you take the shot.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.720]  Well, you can get it, but you'll be protected.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720]  Well, you'll be more protected.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.720]  Well, you'll be part protected.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.560]  Well, actually, you'll be more sick if you take it.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:14.080]  That's what the major studies at the Cleveland Clinic now show, okay?
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.760]  So that's what's happening.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.760]  And we've been vindicated.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:24.080]  And now he's moved on to the new lie that, well, there's 200,000 people died in America
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.880]  because they didn't take the shot.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.080]  That's just pulled out of the air.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:33.360]  They can't debate because they'll be asked to show sources, and there are no sources
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.360]  for any of it.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.360]  When they told you the shot was safe and effective three years ago, when they first issued it
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:43.800]  two and a half years ago, in the ampoules that the so-called vaccine came in, by law,
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.160]  all drugs that are prescription that aren't over the counter have a big fact sheet on
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.640]  piece of paper you unfold on both sides.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:50.640]  They opened them up.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:51.640]  They were totally white.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:56.200]  They just said the manufacturer who made it, but oh, it was all tested to safe.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.000]  But the testing info is on those pieces of paper by law.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  That was all bypassed.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.880]  I can play you hours of them saying it's tested.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.200]  Niels deGrasse Tyson goes to these shows and says, it's been tested.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.400]  It's been triple blind study.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.560]  No, it wasn't.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.360]  They rolled it out on market directly.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:18.280]  And then when they started rolling the shots out in England in late 2020, they yellow notice
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.280]  that pull it back.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.860]  It's making people sick and hurt.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.120]  But the governing body ignored that.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.800]  But the British military that does the testing said, pull it back, pull it back.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.440]  But they didn't pull it back.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.440]  And it's the same thing here.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.780]  Then the shot started here and they did do studies.
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:38.300]  And then Pfizer and Moderna starting in 2021, the shot started here, covered up what was
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:44.740]  in those studies, miscarriages off the charts, stillbirths off the charts, blood clots, heart
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.740]  attacks, death.
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:51.700]  It's like the NIH tried to suppress massive suicide rates in children that the government
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:52.700]  transitioned with transgenderism.
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:57.780]  That's why the EU and the UK are moving to ban transgenderism.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.060]  The truth's coming out one way or another.
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.800]  Two amazing nootropics.

[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.680]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:28.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this Friday edition.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:34.800]  We're now into our number two and the political, former political president, pardoned by President
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:39.680]  Trump and always has been a Christian growing up, but he admits that he wasn't really born
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.680]  again until a few years ago, Roger Stone.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:48.280]  And because we are simulcast on Dish Network, DirecTV, a whole bunch of satellites beaming
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:53.800]  around the world on some of the biggest Christian networks today, thanks to the good grace of
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.600]  the River Church and the great Rodney Howard Brown, Revival.com.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.080]  I'll be here this Sunday for the Sunday service, the nighttime service, all the evening with
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:08.240]  Alex Jones, 7 o'clock Eastern will be simulcast as well, Revival.com, InfoWars.com, and on
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:13.400]  different cable and systems everywhere, so go to Revival.com to find all of that.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:20.680]  I would like Roger to share his story of really getting Holy Ghost born again because he was
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:24.040]  in a very, very dark hour being set up with the enemy coming after him, but he prayed
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:29.520]  with a prominent pastor who told him just give it to the Lord and it was miraculous.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.480]  But we're going to have Roger with us for the next 40 minutes or so that I promised
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.520]  the last segment of this hour I got behind.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.440]  I'm going to give you the real take on what happened with the submarine, then some deep
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.440]  research.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.440]  We know what happened.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.720]  We're going to break that down.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:45.720]  I've had a lot more questions on this than ever on anything in such a short period of
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.720]  time.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:50.520]  I mean, it is just, I've been hammered walking down the street at a hotel and a restaurant
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.520]  here at the ministry.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.520]  What do you think happened there?
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.280]  So, I've had family calling me.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.080]  People are really interested, so I'll talk about that.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.800]  We'll get Roger's take on that.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:01.360]  We're going to cover the waterfront with Roger, but yesterday morning, maybe it was
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:06.560]  the morning before, time all blurs, Roger's calling me and I didn't answer because I'd
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.960]  brushed my teeth, and then later I saw he texted me with three exclamation points saying,
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.960]  call me.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:12.960]  Roger never does that.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.360]  So, I call him and he goes, hey, you've not seen the 20-page Washington Post article?
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.360]  I said, no.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.680]  He said, well, it's behind a paywall, but I'll send it to you.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:25.600]  He sent it to me, and he's here to tell you what is in that and how it's such a big deal,
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.640]  and I've got part of it here.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:31.840]  I didn't print off the whole 20 pages, and I read the thing with my mouth hanging open
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.560]  when I was driving in.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.560]  I wasn't driving the car.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:38.960]  They picked me up in a bus, shuttle bus, to bring me to my hotel at the ministry, but I
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:44.840]  was reading this with my mouth hanging open to see this because there's so many facets
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.840]  to this.
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.200]  Little, little jewels from the feds like, well, the National Archives had done an investigation
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:55.000]  of Trump and thought he was behind it by looking at his records with no proof, no evidence.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.080]  What is non-investigative agencies doing demanding the FBI indict people?
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:05.800]  It's just full of stuff like that, and the feds in the D.C. jurisdiction wanting to indict
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:11.200]  Trump, myself, and Roger Stone claiming we masterminded it, and then the DOJ senior people
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:17.440]  say you have to have something called some evidence, some probable cause, some proof
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:20.040]  because they already had subpoenaed our records at the time of this.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.560]  They already had all of that.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.300]  So a lot of dirty behavior going on, a lot of weirdness, and so, Roger, you've really
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:31.200]  been immersed in this more than me in that they try to put you in prison, had a kangaroo
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.080]  trial, the same prosecutors, the same people that are going after Trump on Russiagate that
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:40.520]  was a hoax, the documents hoax, saying you can't have those documents.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.560]  It's the same crew over and over and over again.
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.840]  So this affects everybody, and it's their attempt to brand the American people as terrorists.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.560]  It's not just Alex Jones or Roger Stone saying, oh, look, they tried to indict us, but even
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.920]  the senior Justice Department people and the attorney general said you have no proof because
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:01.280]  we know that this is important because Jack Smith is still doing this because these prosecutors
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.400]  couldn't connect the ladder from the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, the few that went
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.120]  the building and did nothing wrong, they're now political prisoners in a rigged trial,
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.120]  to the president.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.760]  Well, I mean, I know I didn't talk to the president about January 6th.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.120]  I know you didn't.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.800]  So they know that.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.800]  They have the NSA.
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.800]  They have our text messages.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.800]  They subpoenaed them.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.720]  I had to spend massive amounts of money on lawyers.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.720]  We know that.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.240]  So what's really going on there?
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.800]  This is a big deal, Roger.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.400]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:35.360]  Well, Alex, first of all, I want to congratulate you for being there with my good friend, Pastor
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.360]  Rodney Howard Brown.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.640]  He's a great man.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:44.840]  He gave me really valuable spiritual counseling when my family and I were literally going
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.840]  through hell.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.400]  I've attended his services there at his church.
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.120]  It's an amazing experience with amazing people.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.760]  And he's an amazing man in himself.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.280]  He's fearless.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:00.120]  He is devoted to the Lord.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:05.120]  He does many, many, many good works for many, many people.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.960]  He doesn't ever brag about it.
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:08.960]  He's very funny.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.840]  Also, he's an excellent, excellent speaker.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:16.160]  His sermons are always both humorous but also meaningful.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.320]  He's been a very, very good friend.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.320]  And I really wish I was there with you guys, to be honest with you.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.520]  Be great to break bread with you.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:30.360]  But Alex, this is this is a big deal, because, as I have said here on your show and in many
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:39.200]  other places, any claim or inference that I or in this case, you knew in advance about
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:47.880]  participated in or condoned any illegal action on January 6th or any other date is not only
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:51.900]  categorically false, it is defamatory.
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:58.920]  And there is no witness, no email, no text message, no group chat, no encrypted message,
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.920]  no evidence.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:05.080]  To the contrary, I was glad to see that someone at the Justice Department understands you still
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:09.040]  need something called probable cause evidence.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:16.480]  Now, I've been through this particular hell because in the Mueller investigation, Mueller
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:22.120]  prosecutors told three different federal judges in order to get their search warrants that
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:28.200]  they had probable cause to charge me with treason, conspiracy against the United States,
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:37.720]  money laundering, counterfeiting, unauthorized access to a computer, mail fraud, wire fraud,
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.640]  misprison of a felony and aiding and abetting a felony after the fact.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:48.040]  Once they got into my over one million emails, because unlike Andrew Weissman and the Mueller
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:54.280]  prosecutors who erased everything that was under subpoena, I erased nothing whatsoever.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.620]  And they found no evidence.
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:58.100]  They had two approaches.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:04.780]  First, they pressured a very young field man working on the Trump campaign to wear a wire
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:11.140]  and come to Miami and try to engage me in a conversation of WikiLeaks.
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.140]  That didn't happen.
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:20.420]  But then they essentially fabricated these process crimes against me, lying to Congress
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:27.820]  under oath in my voluntary testimony when there's no crimes to lie about and charging
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:36.300]  me with witness tampering against their chief witness when in one of the exculpatory witnesses
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:42.180]  who went to the grand jury and told the truth, that guy, their main witness threatened to
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:46.740]  shoot him in the head in writing, which the prosecutors were well aware of.
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:50.240]  But of course, he wasn't charged with witness tampering.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.600]  In my case, I was accused of trying to steal this guy's dog.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.440]  That was nonsense as well.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:00.920]  So the point here, Alex, is that these people are driven.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:09.600]  You'll remember that the FBI sources told Reuters in March of that year that they conducted
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.760]  the point.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:17.160]  One has to presume between the Oath Keepers prosecution and the Proud Boys prosecution,
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.120]  all communications have been viewed.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.120]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.760]  I never left my hotel grounds on January 6th.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:29.880]  I was also not involved in the alternative elector stuff that was going on around me.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.440]  In fact, I didn't even know about it at the time.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.120]  But I don't know most of the people involved in that.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.120]  I do know Rudy Giuliani.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.120]  By the way, let me just back you up, Roger.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.320]  I mean, let me just back you up on this.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:44.760]  And the reason that viewers are watching this with all the huge news and the Ukrainian offensive
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:50.880]  failing and the submarine story and just all the incredible news, why we're focusing
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.880]  on this.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:56.520]  Here's a 20-page article in the Washington Post that, like the FBI said a year and a
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.680]  half ago in Reuters, we've investigated Trump, Jones, and Stone.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.600]  They have no communications.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.800]  They're totally innocent.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.800]  And why would they do that?
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.800]  We now know because there was such political pressure to go make stuff up.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:11.360]  And so good people in the FBI said, this is baloney.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:15.320]  And then politicos at the Justice Department kept putting pressure on that.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.120]  So they went out and tried to frame us.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.120]  They harassed us.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.280]  They literally put the CIA on us because they couldn't get the FBI to do it.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.240]  It's a whole long story.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:27.920]  People wearing wires, sex operatives, people trying to infiltrate the business.
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:28.920]  You heard about Roger.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.080]  They sent in teams on him, not just once.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.120]  There was all the other stuff on Russia stuff.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.520]  They tried to send in fake groups with me that were Russians to offer me money.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.520]  This has never been told.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.960]  And the FBI asked me not to talk about it.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.120]  I went into the FBI, gave them all the stuff.
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.120]  I recorded the people.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.240]  I mean, it's just been a frickin' nightmare.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.760]  And so it's just being bombarded constantly by them trying to set us up, while then the
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:54.960]  other branches of the government that I'm not even saying are lionistic, but are at least
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.640]  not criminal completely, are like, you people are nuts.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.760]  So there's a civil war, basically, inside the Justice Department.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.760]  And that's what this shows.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.880]  And now the baddie group with Jack Smith and them were showing their tactics here, setting
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.760]  up the militia people with Whitmer, setting us up with January 6th.
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:14.960]  Congress has seen the surveillance footage, confirms DC police were there helping break
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:15.960]  in.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.280]  The Capitol Police were the victims, like the general public was.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.320]  This was a giant setup.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.240]  When the Capitol Police asked for backup, their commanders wouldn't answer the phone
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.240]  for four hours.
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.880]  So this was a stand down.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.880]  We know this.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.800]  That's why they haven't indicted us, the smarter guys in the Justice Department, because they
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:35.320]  know you and I won't shut up and we'll expose their whole RAIPS operation that's now been
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.320]  exposed.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.480]  But we know with Jack Smith, they're still trying to indict Trump for January 6th.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:41.880]  That means us.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:44.080]  We shouldn't put it past these maniacs, Roger.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.000]  That's why this is important.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.640]  Well, sadly, I was not in touch with President Trump on January 6th or the days prior to
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.640]  January 6th.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:57.600]  I saw him back around Christmas because I bumped into him in a buffet line.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.360]  Sorry, that's not a meeting.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:04.880]  And the conversations were essentially pleasant, but innocuous.
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.480]  You're beating a dead horse.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.000]  Alex, politics is not never about the past.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.040]  It's always about the future.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:18.760]  And sadly, we have to defend ourselves on this baseless crap when in fact, we have a
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:25.520]  Justice Department and an IRS that is shielding the criminality of Hunter Biden.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:31.920]  These new revelations from whistleblowers just in the last 48 hours.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.520]  This really boggles the mind.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:40.480]  So some woman named Jessica Tarloff, she'll be hearing from my lawyers shortly.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:48.680]  She goes on Fox 5 and says Roger Stone and his wife evaded two million dollars in taxes,
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.000]  but they were allowed to walk.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.840]  But poor Hunter Biden, who, you know, who failed to report millions of dollars of income.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:56.840]  He's being penalized.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.360]  Well, first of all, that's false.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.480]  There's never any evidence whatsoever that I evaded taxes.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:11.600]  I reported, my wife and I reported accurately all income, all of which I learned legally,
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.120]  unlike Hunter Biden, and all assets.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.920]  And you can't get blood out of a stone.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:23.920]  So yeah, I made eight years worth of monthly payments, Alex, to the IRS until they literally
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:26.840]  bankrupted me, virtually bankrupted me.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:31.880]  And the time came, well, you can't get blood out of a stone, as they said.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:37.160]  But Jessica Tarloff is either going to withdraw that or I will see her in court because it
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.920]  is a damnable lie.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.920]  Yeah, I settled with the IRS.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:46.240]  And in that settlement, I owe them two million dollars of which one million dollars is penalties
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.240]  and interest.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:52.080]  Now, normally, for your average taxpayer, you can negotiate that down some, but not
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.080]  for Roger Stone.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:57.920]  There are different rules for me because I'm a supporter of Donald Trump and because I appear
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:58.920]  regularly.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.240]  Worse.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.240]  That's right.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.240]  So now let's segue into why this is important.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.200]  So now they admit.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.600]  Why do you think The Washington Post did a 20 page article with all these FBI and Justice
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.600]  Department people admitting this?
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.640]  Why are they even putting all this out to, to, to, to, to, to like spin it and look,
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:21.520]  say, look, we're not political because we didn't set Trump up for January 6th.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:22.680]  I mean, what is the point of that?
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:25.960]  Because we know The Washington Post is the mouth of the CIA.
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:28.000]  Yeah, it's very hard to understand.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:34.400]  First of all, real reporters as a absolute Red Rock journalistic rule, if they're going
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:38.400]  to report your name in a piece, they're supposed to call you for comment.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:43.160]  I didn't hear from either one of these reporters, which shows that they are jackals and that
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.880]  it is a fake news.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:51.280]  I really don't understand what the motive here is, other than to say that, you know, I continue
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:57.720]  to be protected by Jesus Christ, that all of my praying has had the desired results.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:02.960]  You know, I really do feel since I walked away from that horrific car accident the day
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:08.680]  after the election, you know, when the car was total, I was in Memphis visiting the studios
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.680]  of the great Mike Lindell.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:17.120]  When I was T-boned by a guy doing 60 miles an hour, the car was total, the two security
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.800]  guards I was with were injured.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:21.480]  I walked away without a scratch.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.480]  Thank you, Jesus.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:27.640]  This is, this is yet another miracle because we have a broken system.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:33.320]  It's a system which doesn't prosecute Hunter Biden, which more importantly shields the
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:39.400]  president of the United States when he is taking multimillion dollar bribes from China,
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.440]  but wants to poke around regarding Roger Stone.
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.160]  You know, it really does get tedious.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:54.160]  But here's the greater point, which is we should not let this, nor should we let this
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:21:01.840]  horrific, legally flawed effort to destroy Donald Trump distract us from the epic crimes
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.120]  of the Biden crime family.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.440]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:11.040]  They don't want to talk about Hunter illegally lobbying for Ukraine, Russia, China, Romania.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.440]  Paul Manafort did a hard time for that, by the way.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:19.340]  They don't want to talk about the millions of dollars he received from these foreign entities.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:24.620]  They don't want to talk about his, the treason, the influence peddling.
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:30.660]  They certainly don't want to talk about the fact that Joe Biden was in the room when Hunter
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:33.780]  was extorting a Chinese energy company.
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:40.620]  I really don't know how much longer the political establishment, Barack Obama, who's really,
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:47.020]  I think everybody understands, actually the guy running the country, will continue to
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:51.620]  put up with this kind of embarrassment from Joe Biden, and they just decide that he is
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:52.620]  dispensable.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:59.380]  Well, that was my next question, and that's why we've got the 20-page article where they
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:04.220]  tried to indict us, and the Justice Department said, there's no proof, you have to stop this.
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:06.660]  And you know, that's not a very nice lady that did that, even though she's one of the
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:07.660]  senior people.
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:12.900]  And they admit that Garland was in on the decision, but I have to say, thank you for not wrongly
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:13.900]  indicting me.
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:16.860]  I mean, I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth here, Roger.
[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:19.100]  So again, why do you think they stopped them from indicting us?
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:22.900]  Why did the FBI go to Reuters and say, Alice Jones and Roger Stone were not communicating
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:26.500]  with anybody, we've checked their communications, okay?
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.300]  And it's the same thing.
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:31.540]  It was an act of God.
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:32.540]  It was an act of God.
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:34.580]  I can't come to any other conclusion.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:42.940]  Okay, so I want to then get into the current attacks on Trump, the indictment, Jack Smith,
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:47.019]  what's happening politically, Gavin Newsom, Biden's gone from being serious dementia to
[01:22:47.019 --> 01:22:54.740]  being beyond clown world, saluting the Indian National Anthem, not knowing who he is, God
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:23:01.019]  save the Queen, saying the year is 2020, I mean he never, it's not like we're cherry
[01:23:01.019 --> 01:23:07.260]  picking stuff, I go and find the raw speeches and it is just a bumbling moron factory, so
[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:11.780]  what are they going to do, how are they going to try to shoehorn Newsom or somebody in,
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:16.820]  we'll talk about that in a moment, but first, people need to understand, Roger Stone didn't
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:20.700]  become a born again Christian because it was popular, I know Roger, I've known Roger ten
[01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:27.099]  years now, I've known him very well for about almost eight, and really good guy, always
[01:23:27.099 --> 01:23:34.139]  tells you the truth, super smart, worldly fellow, really funny, and yeah, not anti-Christian,
[01:23:34.139 --> 01:23:38.340]  you know, grew up Catholic, sure, you know, believe Jesus, but hasn't had the real conversion
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:45.019]  Saul on the road to Damascus, white light event, but he literally tells me I need to
[01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:48.980]  go to church and pray, and you know, wants to pray with me on the phone and stuff, so
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:52.820]  it's not an act, folks, he is, I'm surprised he didn't become a preacher or something,
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:57.980]  so God bless you, Roger, got a huge regular Christian audience, obviously, we got giant
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:03.660]  millions, we had a huge response when they simulcast us on their satellite yesterday,
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:07.820]  and I'm told they got a huge response, and even more people, the words out that I'm doing
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:14.099]  my show here, who knows, maybe full-time in the future, I'm just joking, but seriously,
[01:24:14.099 --> 01:24:16.700]  tell people in the five minutes we have to break, we'll come back with all the political
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:21.460]  news about your spiritual journey.
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:28.099]  It's really pretty simple, Alex, I was baptized as a Catholic, my mother was a very strict
[01:24:28.099 --> 01:24:33.780]  Catholic, I went to Sunday school, but when I got to Washington D.C. and I started making
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:38.700]  a lot of money and had a lot of influence and a lot of power, I started living the life
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:44.300]  of a libertine, and I admit to you that I wandered far from the Lord, I lived a life
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:52.139]  of wine, women, and song, and a time came when I was facing prosecution, see, when
[01:24:52.139 --> 01:24:58.420]  I was arrested, even though it was over the top, you'll recall, 29 FBI agents in full
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:04.660]  SWAT gear, brandishing fully automatic M4 assault weapons, surrounded and then stormed
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:09.380]  my home at six o'clock in the morning, I actually had the naive idea that I was gonna get a
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:15.780]  fair trial, little did I know, so when the time came that I realized that I was gonna
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:22.820]  be not only gagged, because I couldn't defend myself, but also lynched, I had the opportunity
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:29.059]  to meet Franklin Graham, he was coming to Boca Raton, a young pastor, Randy Coggins,
[01:25:29.059 --> 01:25:35.620]  who I'd become close to, very dynamic young pastor, a friend of Rodney Howard Brown, really
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:40.260]  kept counseling me that I needed to turn my burden over to the Lord, that instead of
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:45.700]  all the stress and the worry, I needed to turn to Christ, and Alex, I wanna be honest
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:52.980]  with you, I was depressed, I was angry, I was frustrated, I was despondent, I was worried
[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:59.660]  about who would take care of my wife in these circumstances if I was unjustly incarcerated,
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:04.179]  and when I saw Reverend Graham, I'd met Billy Graham when I worked for President Nixon, he's
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:09.300]  one of the greatest men of the 20th century, by the way, and I told him, look, I've got
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:13.940]  this problem, and I really would appreciate it if you put in a word with the President
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:18.099]  for me for executive clemency, he said, well, I'll see what I can do about that, but let
[01:26:18.099 --> 01:26:22.660]  me give you a better piece of advice, you need to confess your sins, you need to get
[01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:26.820]  right with Jesus, and I'm telling you right now, if you will do that, and you will do it
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:33.059]  in all sincerity, I think the Lord will lift you up, I think he will deliver you from your
[01:26:33.139 --> 01:26:37.460]  persecutors, and I was still thinking like a political operative, you know, and I said,
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:40.580]  well, I'll think about that, Reverend, thank you very much, but then we went out in the
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:45.380]  field where he was having a revival, and the time came in his oration when he said, I don't
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:50.900]  care whether your problem is alcoholism, or drug addiction, or gambling addiction, or
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:55.940]  health problems, or financial problems, or family problems, or any kind of problem, turn
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:27:00.740]  to the Lord, the Lord will lift you up, but you have to confess your sins, and you need
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:06.500]  to get right with God, and you have to pledge to walk in his way, and now those who want
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:11.460]  to live forever with our Heavenly Father, rise with me, confess your sins, and get right
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:17.059]  with God, you can do it right now, his father used to famously say, you can do it tonight,
[01:27:18.019 --> 01:27:22.660]  and Alex, I don't know, the Spirit came over me at that moment, I wasn't embarrassed, I
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:27.860]  wasn't ashamed, I stood up in a field with 200 other Christians, I confessed my sins,
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:33.700]  and I became a new man, I invited Christ into my life, and I became a different person,
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:39.700]  and I know that there are liberals right now at the New York Times, and Media Matters for
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:46.580]  America, and other communists who are smirking, and giggling, and say, oh yeah, Roger Stone's
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:52.019]  turned to Christ, that's a head fake, that's an act, that's a pose, I don't really care
[01:27:52.099 --> 01:27:57.380]  what they think, I only care what he thinks, so you can't fool God.
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:00.820]  We're about to go to break, but tell folks what happened, how your life, you just totally
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:03.219]  turned around, like 180 as soon as you did that.
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:09.300]  I had six miracles in my life, commutation of my sentence, pardon from a dying in prison,
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:14.900]  saving my wife from stage four cancer, walking away from a car wreck, a voice told me in the
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:19.940]  shower on January 6th, do not go out there, how many more miracles do we have to have,
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:24.500]  and now a new miracle, somebody at the Justice Department realized that there is no case
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:29.540]  against me regarding January 6th, because I know nothing whatsoever about it.
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:35.059]  I'm living proof that Jesus Christ can do anything, and that's why anytime I'm asked
[01:28:35.059 --> 01:28:40.500]  to go on any Christian podcast, broadcast, radio show, or speak at any Christian forum,
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:46.500]  I try to do it, because I want other people to know, if Jesus Christ can save me, a hard-boiled,
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:51.139]  hard-edged political operative, then Jesus Christ can do anything.
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:55.540]  Powerful, stay there, and I know for a fact women throw themselves at Roger,
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:58.099]  he turns them away now, he's the real deal, we'll be right back.

[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:07.780]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us,
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:12.019]  but when we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[01:31:12.019 --> 01:31:18.740]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight, and we look at Harrison Smith
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:23.460]  and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week,
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:28.660]  it's really just incredible, so for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:34.180]  past support, and I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:38.180]  do not support us. I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful,
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:43.300]  keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners never go to infowarestore.com, and you never
[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:47.620]  buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:51.380]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarestore.com.
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:55.460]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarestore.com,
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:57.860]  our funding problems would be over. Please take action now.
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:04.260]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:10.260]  the atmosphere. The surrounding communities began to get sick. Laws were enacted to compel
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:16.420]  these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilic acid,
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:22.180]  still highly toxic, but containable. Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison,
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:27.300]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it. Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:32.500]  was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the public health service at the
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:39.219]  time. And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste
[01:32:39.219 --> 01:32:45.059]  product and dumping it into our drinking water. Reputable studies show that it's causing various
[01:32:45.059 --> 01:32:50.980]  cancers and other disease. With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water,
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:57.860]  and a remedy to this madness. Available now at infowarestore.com.
[01:32:57.730 --> 01:33:07.730]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:15.370]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[01:33:15.370 --> 01:33:20.370]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[01:33:20.370 --> 01:33:26.370]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[01:33:26.370 --> 01:33:31.370]  He said, it's a long walk to Nashville, would you like to ride?
[01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:34.370]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:39.370]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:44.370]  I sat down in the front seat, he turned on the radio.
[01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:50.370]  And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers were solid country gold.
[01:33:50.370 --> 01:33:55.370]  Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white-haired when he asked me for a light.
[01:33:55.370 --> 01:33:58.370]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:58.370 --> 01:34:03.370]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday, June 23rd, 2023 transmission.
[01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:06.370]  I just talked to Owen Schroyer during the break.
[01:34:06.370 --> 01:34:08.370]  He's out of the courthouse.
[01:34:08.370 --> 01:34:12.370]  And he needs to talk to his lawyer before he makes any statements.
[01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:14.370]  But he's going to shoot a statement.
[01:34:14.370 --> 01:34:16.370]  And as soon as the lawyer is ready, we're going to air it.
[01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:18.370]  But there's a lot of media spin going on.
[01:34:18.370 --> 01:34:19.370]  So I want to cover this right now.
[01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:20.370]  Then go back to Roger Stone.
[01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:21.370]  Finish up with this.
[01:34:21.370 --> 01:34:24.370]  Then get to the latest politics and Gavin Newsom and what they can do with Biden.
[01:34:24.370 --> 01:34:26.370]  And the indictments of Trump and more coming.
[01:34:26.370 --> 01:34:27.370]  We'll get to the real inside baseball in a moment.
[01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:33.370]  But first, if you remember about two years ago, a year and a half ago,
[01:34:33.370 --> 01:34:35.370]  there was a New York Times headline.
[01:34:35.370 --> 01:34:36.370]  It was New York Times.
[01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:37.370]  I had Roger call me.
[01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:41.370]  And he goes, is it true you're cooperating with the committee and giving them stuff?
[01:34:41.370 --> 01:34:43.370]  And I said, no, Roger.
[01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:48.370]  That's a 100% lie meant to make everybody think we've done something wrong and I'm a criminal.
[01:34:48.370 --> 01:34:51.370]  And then get everybody tattling on each other on something that never happened.
[01:34:51.370 --> 01:34:53.370]  He said, yeah, I figured that.
[01:34:53.370 --> 01:34:55.370]  Well, it's the same thing with Owen Schroyer.
[01:34:55.370 --> 01:35:01.370]  He's facing three charges all together, three years in prison,
[01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:06.370]  federal prison in front of a D.C. jury that would send a newborn baby to a gas chamber
[01:35:06.370 --> 01:35:07.370]  if the Democrats tell him to.
[01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:09.370]  I mean, it's just everyone gets convicted.
[01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:10.370]  It's total fraud.
[01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:11.370]  Everybody admits it.
[01:35:11.370 --> 01:35:12.370]  It's a joke.
[01:35:12.370 --> 01:35:14.370]  That's why they're getting ready to indict Trump there on other stuff.
[01:35:14.370 --> 01:35:16.370]  On January 6th, they're trying.
[01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:21.370]  And so the Jack Smith, that whole operation with, you know,
[01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:25.370]  this makes me sick, all of Biden's flying monkeys at the Justice Department.
[01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:27.370]  And so it's the same thing.
[01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:29.370]  They were subpoenaing all our records.
[01:35:29.370 --> 01:35:33.370]  They were coming after Owen and they said, we can subpoena your phone
[01:35:33.370 --> 01:35:37.370]  or if you're innocent, you give it to us and we'll knock it down to a misdemeanor.
[01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:39.370]  And so he said, OK, here's my phone.
[01:35:39.370 --> 01:35:40.370]  Nothing on it.
[01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:41.370]  Nothing incriminating.
[01:35:41.370 --> 01:35:44.370]  You notice that the Justice Department has recommended no time served.
[01:35:44.370 --> 01:35:45.370]  I just talked to Owen.
[01:35:45.370 --> 01:35:48.370]  The judge, though, might put him in jail for six months.
[01:35:48.370 --> 01:35:51.370]  So that's how this country is a joke, man.
[01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:56.370]  I mean, a guy with no criminal record, a great guy at the Capitol.
[01:35:56.370 --> 01:35:58.370]  He's got a criminal record now.
[01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:59.370]  He just pled guilty.
[01:35:59.370 --> 01:36:03.370]  And he's there with me on video trying to stop people going in the building
[01:36:03.370 --> 01:36:05.370]  while the police sit there with their thumbs, you know,
[01:36:05.370 --> 01:36:07.370]  where sitting on their hands.
[01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:09.370]  And I wasn't mad at him.
[01:36:09.370 --> 01:36:11.370]  He kind of got a little upset.
[01:36:11.370 --> 01:36:14.370]  I said, so you're facing still six months in jail.
[01:36:14.370 --> 01:36:15.370]  He said, what am I supposed to do?
[01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:17.370]  They got a rigged system.
[01:36:17.370 --> 01:36:18.370]  And I get it.
[01:36:18.370 --> 01:36:20.370]  I'd probably do the same thing he did.
[01:36:20.370 --> 01:36:22.370]  But this is just disgusting.
[01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:25.370]  And then they got to add the cherry on top of these headlines.
[01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:28.370]  And they're recommending no prison time because he cooperated in another
[01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:30.370]  investigation.
[01:36:30.370 --> 01:36:31.370]  Owen doesn't even know what they're talking about.
[01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:33.370]  It's the same thing with me.
[01:36:33.370 --> 01:36:36.370]  Jones to cooperate with January 6th Committee.
[01:36:36.370 --> 01:36:38.370]  I said, no such thing.
[01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:39.370]  I said, I have nothing to hide.
[01:36:39.370 --> 01:36:40.370]  No one did anything wrong.
[01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:46.370]  Threw a letter to the Jan 6th Committee and to the Judge Department.
[01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:49.370]  And I said, if you give me total immunity, whatever the term is,
[01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:52.370]  100% because you're trying to set me up,
[01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:53.370]  I'll tell you how innocent we all are.
[01:36:53.370 --> 01:36:55.370]  And they didn't give me total immunity.
[01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:58.370]  So I took the fifth 98 times.
[01:36:58.370 --> 01:37:01.370]  Fake news, fake news, fake news.
[01:37:01.370 --> 01:37:02.370]  A, I've done nothing wrong.
[01:37:02.370 --> 01:37:05.370]  B, compared to those police that day,
[01:37:05.370 --> 01:37:09.370]  the D.C. police that helped lead the attack on the Capitol, I'm a hero.
[01:37:09.370 --> 01:37:12.370]  And I'm not comparing myself to the people that died that day,
[01:37:12.370 --> 01:37:16.370]  and Ashley Babbitt and some of the innocent Capitol police that did get set
[01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:19.370]  up and did fight and went through some terrible stuff.
[01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:20.370]  So they were victims too.
[01:37:20.370 --> 01:37:24.370]  But if anything, I'm a victim of a federal serious setup.
[01:37:24.370 --> 01:37:25.370]  And so was Roger.
[01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:26.370]  And I remember that morning.
[01:37:26.370 --> 01:37:28.370]  I said, Roger, you ready to march with us and go?
[01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:29.370]  He goes, I got a bad feeling.
[01:37:29.370 --> 01:37:30.370]  I'm not going.
[01:37:30.370 --> 01:37:32.370]  This is all, this is a cluster F and all this stuff.
[01:37:32.370 --> 01:37:34.370]  And God told me not to go, but that's a statement from him.
[01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:36.370]  And then after that, my cell phone wouldn't work.
[01:37:36.370 --> 01:37:37.370]  It was the crowd was so big.
[01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:40.370]  And so I had to go back over this again, but I just talked to Owen.
[01:37:41.370 --> 01:37:42.370]  He's such a good guy.
[01:37:42.370 --> 01:37:46.370]  And man, I've really learned not to have anger because it takes years off my
[01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:47.370]  life and I pray.
[01:37:47.370 --> 01:37:48.370]  I'm going to pray to God.
[01:37:48.370 --> 01:37:50.370]  I pray for God not to make me angry, but I am.
[01:37:50.370 --> 01:37:52.370]  My brain is burning right now.
[01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:54.370]  And my heart is burning.
[01:37:54.370 --> 01:37:57.370]  I'm so sick of these criminals that run our government.
[01:37:57.370 --> 01:38:00.370]  I'm so tired of them abusing innocent people while they're crackhead
[01:38:00.370 --> 01:38:03.370]  pedophile kids run around raping everybody.
[01:38:03.370 --> 01:38:05.370]  And I'm pretty upset right now, Roger.
[01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:08.370]  I want to shift gears, but you were asking me this morning in text messages,
[01:38:08.370 --> 01:38:09.370]  Dr. Owen, he was in this kangaroo court.
[01:38:09.370 --> 01:38:10.370]  Is this true?
[01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:12.370]  He's cooperating in other investigation.
[01:38:12.370 --> 01:38:14.370]  And the answer is no, no, no.
[01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:15.370]  Roger, go ahead.
[01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:19.370]  Well, you know, I, uh, I was in touch with Owen this morning.
[01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:21.370]  I told him that I would be praying for him.
[01:38:21.370 --> 01:38:23.370]  Told him that the day before as well.
[01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:24.370]  He is a great guy.
[01:38:24.370 --> 01:38:29.370]  As you know, he and I hosted the war room together for well over a year.
[01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:31.370]  It's one of the highlights of my life.
[01:38:31.370 --> 01:38:34.370]  I don't know, Alex, if you move to Sarasota, maybe I'll,
[01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:37.370]  maybe I'll move up there with you and return to the war room.
[01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:38.370]  You never know.
[01:38:38.370 --> 01:38:40.370]  You never know what God has in store.
[01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:43.370]  God has a plan and God's plan will be in place.
[01:38:43.370 --> 01:38:47.370]  What I think Owen is going to find is that, uh, this, it never ends.
[01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:52.370]  I mean, uh, my wife and I are still struggling, uh, to make ends meet.
[01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:55.370]  People want to help us particularly help me pay for her alternative cancer
[01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:57.370]  treatments that have kept her healthy.
[01:38:57.370 --> 01:39:03.370]  They can go to stone family fund.com stone family fund.com.
[01:39:03.370 --> 01:39:04.370]  I hate to keep asking.
[01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:06.370]  I know you do too, Alex.
[01:39:06.370 --> 01:39:10.370]  People need to go buy some of these great products at info wars to keep
[01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:11.370]  info wars out.
[01:39:11.370 --> 01:39:12.370]  There's a tip of the spear.
[01:39:12.370 --> 01:39:17.370]  They can go to stone family fund to help us because we won't give up fighting.
[01:39:17.370 --> 01:39:18.370]  We will not.
[01:39:18.370 --> 01:39:19.370]  Roger Roger.
[01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:20.370]  You, you went through the gauntlet.
[01:39:20.370 --> 01:39:22.370]  You could have lied about Trump and been left alone.
[01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:25.370]  They have, they've, they've, they've, you live in an apartment.
[01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:27.370]  They have, they have nothing wrong with an apartment,
[01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:28.370]  but they've taken everything you have.
[01:39:28.370 --> 01:39:31.370]  And you literally are here asking folks for the support because
[01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:33.370]  you're a political target.
[01:39:33.370 --> 01:39:35.370]  If the public won't stand with president Trump,
[01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:37.370]  they won't stand with me and they won't stand with you.
[01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:38.370]  They won't stand with Owen.
[01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:41.370]  They'll never stand for anything, but the public is standing with us.
[01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:42.370]  Absolutely.
[01:39:42.370 --> 01:39:43.370]  Now in the little bit of time we have left,
[01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:47.370]  please get into what you think of Newsom Biden's way past his expiration
[01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:48.370]  date.
[01:39:48.370 --> 01:39:51.370]  Just give us a three minute rundown on the current political side of
[01:39:51.370 --> 01:39:52.370]  things.
[01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:53.370]  It's pretty simple.
[01:39:53.370 --> 01:39:54.370]  Here's the fundamental problem.
[01:39:54.370 --> 01:39:57.370]  I think that the, the ruling power elite,
[01:39:57.370 --> 01:39:59.370]  Barack Obama and the others,
[01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:02.370]  they understand that Joe can't get through another campaign.
[01:40:02.370 --> 01:40:03.370]  So they have to move him around.
[01:40:03.370 --> 01:40:07.370]  The problem is they have a woman of color as their vice president.
[01:40:07.370 --> 01:40:10.370]  And that's an important constituency within their party.
[01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:14.370]  So they can't just push Kamala Harris aside,
[01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:17.370]  but they know that she's actually almost as dysfunctional as Joe,
[01:40:17.370 --> 01:40:20.370]  even though she's not a hundred years old, like Joe is.
[01:40:20.370 --> 01:40:25.370]  So they can only replace a woman of color with another woman of color,
[01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:28.370]  which is why I continue to say, as I've said on this show before,
[01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:33.370]  Michelle Obama will be the democratic nominee for president.
[01:40:33.370 --> 01:40:36.370]  That's why they made the South Carolina primary first.
[01:40:36.370 --> 01:40:40.370]  That's why they essentially canceled the New Hampshire and Iowa contests,
[01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:43.370]  making a big mistake, leading them to RFK Jr.
[01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:47.370]  Who's going to run up a big vote total there, a pyramid victory,
[01:40:47.370 --> 01:40:48.370]  but an important one nonetheless.
[01:40:48.370 --> 01:40:51.370]  It's why the convention is in her hometown of Chicago.
[01:40:51.370 --> 01:40:56.370]  Gavin Newsom will be allowed as a white guy to be vice president.
[01:40:57.370 --> 01:41:00.370]  They will put him on the ticket so he can be vice president.
[01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:02.370]  Also, he's going to have to buy that.
[01:41:02.370 --> 01:41:07.370]  So they will make him raise a ton of money for the second slot, but he will do it.
[01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:12.370]  The Democratic Party will nominate Michelle Obama and Gavin Newsom as their ticket.
[01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:14.370]  Now, how do I know this is true?
[01:41:14.370 --> 01:41:17.370]  Because the more Michelle Obama says, I'm not interested.
[01:41:17.370 --> 01:41:18.370]  I'm definitely not running.
[01:41:18.370 --> 01:41:20.370]  It's out of the question, folks.
[01:41:20.370 --> 01:41:22.370]  That's how you know it's going to happen any minute now.
[01:41:23.370 --> 01:41:28.370]  Well, Roger, you've been uncanny with how you predicted all this,
[01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:34.370]  and you've been saying this for two and a half years since they put puppet Joe Biden in,
[01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:36.370]  and we know that Obama's really run the administration.
[01:41:36.370 --> 01:41:38.370]  Now we see Washington Post, New York Times headlines.
[01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:39.370]  Obama's back.
[01:41:39.370 --> 01:41:41.370]  Obama's got to help Biden.
[01:41:41.370 --> 01:41:44.370]  Obama's been in the shadows, not really doing anything, not involved.
[01:41:44.370 --> 01:41:45.370]  He's been totally involved.
[01:41:45.370 --> 01:41:49.370]  This is his third unelected administration, and Michelle's involved.
[01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:52.370]  Michelle's really smart, and Michelle's really cool, and Michelle ought to run,
[01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:55.370]  and all these shows about Michelle, you can see it.
[01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:57.370]  You can see that they're going to try to run Big Mike.
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:10.060]  Look, anyone who thinks that she will not be a formidable candidate really doesn't get it.
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:14.060]  She's going to be very tough to beat, and that's who they're going to nominate.
[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:20.060]  You know, it is always complicated in politics to attack any woman opponent.
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:23.060]  It has always been fraught with disaster.
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:29.060]  And I'm not going to sit here and make jokes about it because that would be an egregious mistake.
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:33.060]  But they figured out that Joe Biden has to go.
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:36.060]  They'll probably allow him to pardon his son, his brother.
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:42.060]  And I predict before it's over, he will pardon himself, which, yes, he does have the authority to do.
[01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:45.060]  But he will soon be taken off the main stage.
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:48.060]  Their big problem right now is Dr. Jill.
[01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:51.060]  Dr. Jill likes the money.
[01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:53.060]  She likes the fanfare.
[01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:56.060]  She likes the pomp and circumstance.
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:58.060]  Joe has wanted this his whole life.
[01:42:58.060 --> 01:43:01.060]  At a certain point, Joe decided he wasn't going to be president.
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:04.060]  That's when the stealing really kicked into high gear.
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:07.060]  But now that he is president, he can no longer function.
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:09.060]  There's nobody home.
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:10.060]  I actually feel bad for him.
[01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:12.060]  I think it's elder abuse.
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:13.060]  I really do.
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:17.060]  And, you know, when he says, well, where's the money?
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:21.060]  The Patriot Sentinel, which is a great new publication out of Oklahoma,
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:30.060]  they actually published documentation of where the five million went into an LLC controlled from Burisma,
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:34.060]  controlled by Hunter Biden.
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:39.060]  I think it's Patriot Sentinel with an S, PatriotSentinel.com, an amazing article.
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:41.060]  You want to check that out.
[01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:44.060]  But it is it's extraordinary.
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:46.060]  The Democrats know Joe can't make it.
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:49.060]  Even if they try to steal it, it's not plausible.
[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:51.060]  The man cannot stand up through a debate.
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:52.060]  They know that.
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:56.060]  It's only a matter of time before he takes a powder.
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:44:01.060]  Now, if he doesn't go, if he refuses to go, they'll remove him under the 25th Amendment,
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:04.060]  which is better than him just dying in his sleep.
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:07.060]  I've written a book on the assassination of American president.
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:15.060]  I'm sorry, but I don't put it beyond the ruling power elite to do whatever is necessary to get poor Joe Biden out of the way.
[01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:17.060]  We don't wish that on him, by the way.
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:20.060]  But it's really time for him to go.
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:21.060]  Well, that's right.
[01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:24.060]  And some people think, oh, they'll never be able to get rid of Kamala.
[01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:25.060]  That woman can't even talk either.
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:26.060]  I think they're drugging her.
[01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:31.060]  I mean, she was dumb during the campaign and pulled one half percent with black people.
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:35.060]  You're going to vomit when I say this, but I have to say they're going to promise her a seat on the U.S.
[01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:39.060]  Supreme Court in order to step aside.
[01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:43.060]  And if the Democrats have control of the Senate, they could actually do that.
[01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:45.060]  They could actually do that.
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:46.060]  And right now they do.
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:49.060]  And folks, don't laugh and think they won't put that bumbling idiot there.
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:50.060]  Look at Fetterman.
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:54.060]  This is the new model, a literal clown show.
[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:58.060]  So they will conveniently get her out of the way.
[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:00.060]  She can't she cannot resist them.
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:05.060]  The Obamas control the money and the machinery of the Democratic Party.
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:07.060]  Remember, Joe Biden was their last chance.
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:14.060]  I think it was Barack Obama who said never underestimate Joe Biden's ability to F things up.
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:17.060]  But they first they tried to inflate Cory Booker.
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:19.060]  He turned out to be a crook.
[01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:21.060]  He would steal a hot stove.
[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:27.060]  He took six hundred thousand dollars from the City Water Commission of Water Authority when he was mayor.
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:32.060]  Speaking of guys who belong in prison, they tried to catapult Kamala Harris.
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:36.060]  She could barely speak a sentence.
[01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:43.060]  They did have a run on those campaign knee pads, however, and they tried to push Pete Buttigieg.
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:44.060]  That didn't fly either.
[01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:49.060]  So the Democrats reluctantly took Joe Biden because they knew he was controllable.
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:54.060]  The Bidens are part of the Obamas, well aware of the Biden corruption.
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:57.060]  Therefore, they have the goods on Joe.
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:59.060]  They know that Dr.
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:04.060]  Jill is a is an ambitious harpy and they knew that they could be controlled.
[01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:06.060]  And sadly, that's exactly what has happened.
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.060]  You said it right.
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:09.060]  She wears literal high.
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:13.060]  She wears high black dresses with fishnet to state dinners.
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:15.060]  I mean, that's what a cocktail waitress at a topless bar wears.
[01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:17.060]  This this woman is completely out of her mind.
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:19.060]  Incredible job, Roger Stone.
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:20.060]  God bless you.
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:21.060]  We'll all pray for the Republic.
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:22.060]  Please pray for me.
[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:23.060]  I'll pray for you.
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:24.060]  Let's pray for a global awakening.
[01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:26.060]  And let's pray for our amazing president.
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:31.060]  In two minutes of finishing up here, I'm at the submarine and the Ukrainian offensive ground into a halt.
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:33.060]  Another insanity.
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:34.060]  How's the big guy doing?
[01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:36.060]  I know you guys talk a lot, hang out a lot.
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:37.060]  I know that's all off record.
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:38.060]  But how's the big guy doing?
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:42.060]  And I'm not talking about Joe Biden, the big guy getting pay off from the Russians or the shycoms.
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:44.060]  I mean, the real president of the U.S.
[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:45.060]  Forty five.
[01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:47.060]  He's doing amazingly well.
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:50.060]  As you know, he went on the maiden edition of my W.A.B.C.
[01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:55.060]  radio show, which is every Sunday at three o'clock this Sunday.
[01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:57.060]  W.A.B.C. radio dot com.
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:59.060]  W.A.B.C. radio dot com.
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:04.060]  You can hear me interview one of the greatest living Americans, General Michael Flynn.
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:05.060]  The president was with me.
[01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:06.060]  I'm amazed.
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:09.060]  This was between his being charged and being arraigned.
[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:13.060]  How calm, cool, collected, determined and talkative he was.
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:17.060]  If you haven't heard that, you can go to W.A.B.C. radio dot com.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.060]  Download it.
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:19.060]  Listen to it now.
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:23.060]  But you're definitely not going to want to miss my show this coming Sunday, three o'clock
[01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:28.060]  Eastern, four o'clock Central at W.A.B.C. radio.
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:32.060]  I introduce one of the greatest living Americans, General Michael Flynn.
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:37.060]  We're going to talk about the Cubans, Chinese spy station in Cuba, what's really going on
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:41.060]  in the ground in Ukraine, the Chinese threats to Taiwan.
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:45.060]  We're going to be breaking it all down this Sunday at three o'clock.
[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:46.060]  W.A.B.C. radio.
[01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:48.060]  All right, Roger Stone.
[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:50.060]  Roger, thank you so much.
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:51.060]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:53.060]  God bless you.
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:55.060]  All right.
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:48:01.060]  Now, I have really saved the most important news to the end of the second hour.
[01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:04.060]  We've got a lot more coming up in the third hour as well.
[01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:08.060]  So I want to hit the situation in Ukraine that is the biggest development since the Russians
[01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:12.060]  invaded February before last.
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:17.060]  And all major analysts agree it's the closest to nuclear doomsday we've ever been, worse
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:21.060]  than the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:24.060]  But everybody wants to know about the submarine.
[01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:26.060]  And quite frankly, it's a distraction.
[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:30.060]  It's why I didn't talk about the submarine Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:32.060]  Wednesday or Thursday.
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:37.060]  But then I saw yesterday what I already knew, what I already talked about, and that is the
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:39.060]  Navy knew exactly what happened there.
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:42.060]  So here's the different angles of this.
[01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:51.590]  The biggest angle here is that the public doesn't believe what the government says or the corporate
[01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:57.510]  media says. If they say Big Bird is yellow, people don't believe it. They say fire engines are red,
[01:48:57.510 --> 01:49:02.950]  they don't believe it. They say the ocean is blue, they don't believe it. And in a way that's good,
[01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:07.670]  but to the establishment, you realize how much you're not like and the fact that you're out of
[01:49:07.670 --> 01:49:12.790]  ammo. And the fact that the more you demonize me, the more successful it makes me. That's not
[01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:18.950]  because I'm that good. It's because you're that bad. And so I don't want to just have some big,
[01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:25.350]  mindless, idiotic war with the New World Order and the Democrats. But I understand you work for
[01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:28.310]  your boss, Satan. So you're not going to stop. You're not going to back down. You're not going
[01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:32.790]  to quit. But to the minions that are just mercenaries out there, I want to challenge
[01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:37.030]  you to come back to reality. And I want to challenge you to realize that you're on a losing
[01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:40.630]  team. And that if you have any children, particularly, you're destroying their future.
[01:49:40.630 --> 01:49:43.510]  You're not going to have to wait long to lose everything. Because if the New World Order gets
[01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:49.990]  its way, we are facing cataclysms that are just unspeakable. But I believe, just like God gave
[01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:57.430]  Nineveh a hundred-year reprieve whenever Jonah was sent there, unwittingly forced to by God,
[01:49:57.430 --> 01:50:01.590]  that we can get a hundred-year reprieve or a 50-year reprieve and more time. Because that's
[01:50:01.590 --> 01:50:05.830]  how God works throughout history. And I see the Great Awakening, and I see all the people
[01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:09.510]  finding God. And I know that there are still a lot of good people left. There's all those
[01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:14.150]  historical Bible stories about, you know, God says, well, there's a hundred people left the
[01:50:14.150 --> 01:50:17.590]  city. I'll destroy it. There's ten left. There's, you know, two left. And then finally, there's
[01:50:17.590 --> 01:50:20.950]  nobody left, and God blows it up. Like I said, Sodom and Gomorrah, right? Pastor, I'm going
[01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:24.870]  from memory here. So whether you believe that stuff happened or not, the point is, this is
[01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:29.590]  happening now. Mark of the Beast, world government, it's all being fulfilled. Open Satan worship.
[01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:32.630]  Target selling shirts that say, we're going to cut Christians' heads off, and your children
[01:50:32.630 --> 01:50:36.630]  belong to a satanic cult. We're going to have sex with them, with a skeleton having sex with a
[01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:46.470]  baby. I mean, you know, I mean, this is real, folks. It's not LGBTQ+, it's LGBTQXY, PPP for
[01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:53.110]  pedophile, SSS for Satan. And it's everywhere. And it's only going to get worse, because God is
[01:50:53.110 --> 01:50:57.670]  going to lower our shields just to let us see what evil is like until we repent. And I think if we
[01:50:58.390 --> 01:51:03.910]  repent and realize how real this is, God's going to protect us. But now is the time to realize
[01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:09.430]  how incredibly real this is. So the big takeaway is, I've never gotten this many phone calls.
[01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:13.990]  Not even when Jeffrey Epstein got murdered in the jail cell. By the way, former CIA director and
[01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:19.670]  former CIA operative and Justice Department director. Barr got confronted in Austin about,
[01:51:19.670 --> 01:51:23.350]  obviously, having Epstein's neck broken in three places, and all those shenanigans,
[01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:26.310]  and saying it's a conspiracy theory that he was murdered, even though we have the
[01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:31.030]  coroner saying he was murdered. So that's up on Infowars.com. In fact, Harrison Smith's going
[01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:35.750]  to lead with that when he comes in and co-hosts with me in the next hour. I don't normally tell
[01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:39.830]  the guest hosts what to do, but I love Harrison. He's a good buddy of mine, and I want to make
[01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:44.150]  sure that gets aired. And he's loaded for Barr, because I'm going to jump out of here a little
[01:51:44.150 --> 01:51:50.950]  bit early and go with Patrick Rodney Howard Brown to the Trump Resort. We've got a little secret
[01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:55.830]  mission there tonight. And then I'm going to be on the Patrick McDavid Huge Podcast tomorrow,
[01:51:55.910 --> 01:52:02.390]  so I'll be back in Tampa tomorrow evening. And then on Sunday morning, 9.30 a.m., the church
[01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:09.030]  will kick off with a big Sunday service. And then at 7 p.m. Eastern, they're going to have an evening
[01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:14.310]  with Alex. That's me. Ask me anything. It'll go at least two, three hours. All the satellites,
[01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:22.950]  all the feeds here at the River Church's website, Revival.com. So be sure and join us for that as
[01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:29.030]  well. But if you can't be here, whether you're in Japan or Russia or the UK or Australia or Mexico
[01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:35.110]  or Chile or wherever, or maybe the North Pole, you can tune in at River.com. We're also going to
[01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:43.110]  simulcast it over at Infowars.com and Band.Video, because normally we're live Sundays, 4 to 8 p.m.
[01:52:43.110 --> 01:52:49.270]  Central. And so we will have a guest host the first two hours, but then at 6 o'clock Central,
[01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:55.030]  7 o'clock Eastern, we're going to simulcast that event as well at Infowars.com and Band.Video.
[01:52:55.030 --> 01:53:00.710]  So be sure and look for that. So the big takeaway on the submarine is the public does not believe
[01:53:00.710 --> 01:53:05.590]  it. And my phone is blown up just, I mean, everywhere. Hey, submarine, submarine. I don't
[01:53:05.590 --> 01:53:08.630]  believe the submarine. I don't believe the submarine. I don't believe the submarine.
[01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:12.310]  Walking into these studios, I had like four or five people, hey, what about the submarine?
[01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:17.430]  Pastor Brown, what about the submarine? And his take is he didn't believe any of it.
[01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:20.950]  They probably just changed the identities of the people, had this set as a distraction.
[01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:25.190]  Operation Northwoods, they describe a plane taking off with tail numbers with CIA operatives getting
[01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:29.510]  on with their kids, blowing up another decoy plane with the same tail number, having the
[01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:33.670]  CIA aircraft land, changed the identities of those families. This is an Operation Northwoods
[01:53:33.670 --> 01:53:40.710]  declassified, 2000, from 1963, actually 1960. They brought Kelly the plan to do this. He said
[01:53:40.710 --> 01:53:45.830]  no and fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. So Rodney told me that he thinks,
[01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:49.670]  and he says he doesn't know this, but just believes nothing. And that's okay to believe
[01:53:49.670 --> 01:53:53.590]  nothing, they say. It's okay to believe Jesse Smollett wasn't attacked. It turned out he
[01:53:53.590 --> 01:53:58.790]  wasn't. It's okay to, you know, when you see footage of Trump blowing up Kurds, and then
[01:53:58.790 --> 01:54:04.310]  it turns out it's gasoline cans being shot at Knob Creek machine gun shootout. I said, that's fake.
[01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:08.710]  When I saw it, I said, those aren't buildings. That's Knob Creek machine gun shootout,
[01:54:08.710 --> 01:54:14.070]  because I've seen the footage of barrels being shot with machine guns. And they said,
[01:54:14.070 --> 01:54:22.150]  there is Trump blowing up the Kurds. ABC News. I mean, who was the NBC reporter,
[01:54:22.150 --> 01:54:25.830]  Brian, whatever his name is, that said he was shot down in a helicopter? I can't remember
[01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:30.470]  these idiots' names anymore. Brian Williams. The point is, you've been lied to so much,
[01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:37.670]  it's completely reasonable to not believe what they say anymore. But again, they did lie to us.
[01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:42.310]  We don't know the full extent, but the Navy now says on Sunday, they have incredible sonar in the
[01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:47.430]  area. They picked up the huge explosion. It's an implosion. When these things compact under
[01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:52.550]  10,000 plus feet of water, it's like, you know, more compact than jumping off the Empire States
[01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:57.110]  building into the concrete with your head, smashed them all as flat as a pancake instantly.
[01:54:57.910 --> 01:55:02.390]  Then they picked up the sub, bounce on the bottom, and they knew right where it was. And they
[01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:06.390]  passed it on to the Navy and the White House. And they all knew they were dead Sunday night.
[01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:11.430]  And they just decided for four days to make it a top story to divert from all the other news
[01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:16.710]  and all the other information. And the Hunter whistleblowers, the IRS whistleblowers,
[01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:20.390]  and the audio recordings of his dad in the meetings and demanding the money and,
[01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:24.550]  you know, the crack whores and the crack and the pedophilia. And just that's a whole stack.
[01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:30.150]  Harrison Smith's going to be covering, I know, coming up next hour. So hey, we have a right to
[01:55:30.150 --> 01:55:34.790]  believe nothing these people say because they've lied so much, but it is a dangerous situation.
[01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:39.990]  Now, I told you that there was going to be a Russian invasion by late February in
[01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:47.270]  October of 2021. What happened is exactly as I said, there's actually had military sources
[01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:50.550]  being deployed. And they said, yeah, it's going to kick off. The Russians have to move in
[01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:55.270]  before the end of February because then it falls about a month later and we've intercepted the
[01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:59.350]  Russian invasion plans. And so I have my sources. And of course, we told you that.
[01:55:59.350 --> 01:56:06.310]  And also told you just knowing infantry maneuvers and tank battles and infantry and tank doctrine,
[01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:12.550]  that it takes three, a force three times larger to break through and capture a dug in force and
[01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:17.190]  that it was hard for the Russians to go in and take part of Ukraine in their zone they're setting
[01:56:17.190 --> 01:56:21.750]  up because of that rule. But it would be just as hard or harder for the Ukrainians once they
[01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:27.910]  weren't the defenders. It's kind of like the Alamo where, you know, 80 something Texans or
[01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:31.990]  whatever it was, they reported probably killed 2000 Mexican. Well, it's because they were the
[01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:36.710]  defenders. Okay. And so it's hard to come up over that and get over the wall and do that. So
[01:56:36.710 --> 01:56:42.230]  it's the same thing. And I predicted that the Ukrainian offensive would be smashed flatter than
[01:56:42.230 --> 01:56:45.990]  a pancake, which it was. So I'm going to do five more minutes. We come back because I'm behind and
[01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:52.310]  then I'm jumping in the van with Pastor Brown to go to the Trump operation and do some stuff over
[01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:56.070]  there and meet some interesting people, do some interesting things. But I'm going to hit more of
[01:56:56.070 --> 01:57:00.550]  that invasion when we come back. But I have dropped the ball. I am a listener funded. I've
[01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:05.510]  done a one minute plug today. And that's how we fund our operations with the satellites and the
[01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:10.950]  infrastructure and the crew and the servers and the legal battles and all of it. I want to encourage
[01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:15.430]  listeners to go to Infowarscore.com and buy some of the great products. Get my book, The Great Reset
[01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:19.270]  in the War for the World, both signed or unsigned. Got our great turmeric toothpaste. It was really

[01:59:56.390 --> 02:00:11.990]  All right, folks. We've got so much to cover, so much to talk about, but I just wanted to add here
[02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:15.910]  that we don't have time to play all these clips. We're going to add these in post once we archive
[02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:21.110]  this live show, the Bandop video. James Cameron has come out and said that the prolonged search
[02:00:21.110 --> 02:00:25.830]  was a nightmarish charade, that they did know they were already dead. He's an investor in the
[02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:30.790]  company. He said he thought it was a bad idea to have it be plastic, composite plastic, but they
[02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:37.030]  thought it was more environmental and that he should have done something, but he thought they
[02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:42.630]  were, quote, smarter than him. I think that's kind of big of him to say that, but again, now people
[02:00:42.630 --> 02:00:45.110]  are seeing what they're saying. The wreckage of the craft doesn't look like the wreckage of the
[02:00:45.110 --> 02:00:48.630]  craft. As much as we've been lied to about these people, I don't believe anything. What we know
[02:00:48.710 --> 02:00:53.350]  is the Navy knew and the Navy passed it up the chain of command. People said to the Navy,
[02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:56.870]  well, why don't you tell the world? We tell our commanding officers, they tell the world,
[02:00:56.870 --> 02:01:01.670]  they decide not to tell you and play the charade that famous submariner James Cameron
[02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:08.070]  says is a charade, but wait for the articles. Jones says submarine disaster may not have happened.
[02:01:08.710 --> 02:01:11.910]  Well, I mean, he's saying it's a charade. All I'm saying is I don't know.
[02:01:12.630 --> 02:01:17.430]  Once you get lied to about WMDs and all the rest of this stuff over and over again, I don't have
[02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:23.910]  to believe these liars. I mean, I tend to believe there are rich thrill seekers that want to go up
[02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:29.590]  in space like you see with all these billionaires that you see happening over here, but what I do
[02:01:29.590 --> 02:01:35.430]  know and what I'm going to be covering big time, big time, you know what? I could come in here and
[02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:40.790]  broadcast my Sunday show and then go right over and get everybody warmed up when we go on at
[02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:45.110]  seven central. Maybe I can do that. Or regardless, I'll be back Monday
[02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:52.630]  getting into the Ukrainian offensive that has come into a steel wall. The Russians started really
[02:01:52.630 --> 02:01:56.630]  about a month ago in probes, the Ukrainians, but they didn't want to ever admit the offensive
[02:01:56.630 --> 02:02:03.270]  had been launched because they were losing. Then they threw in not dozens of leopard tanks and
[02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:08.870]  Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles. I actually went online to the different defense
[02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:13.590]  sites and places that were reporting the real numbers. The U.S. media was really good at blocking
[02:02:13.590 --> 02:02:20.310]  it out. But there are Russian videos of hundreds of armored vehicles and tanks and missile launchers
[02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:25.910]  and air defense systems being destroyed. And so they're just sitting ducks. And so the Ukrainians
[02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:33.910]  pull up and the Russians destroy it with glide bombs, with drones and with light cruise missiles
[02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:38.550]  and with artillery. And so there are videos of, you'll just see like eight
[02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:45.510]  tanks just blown up by artillery. And you'll see drones that they're so accurate.
[02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:50.310]  And imagine what the U.S. has done even better, that they fly right into the ammunition compartments
[02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:57.670]  of the self-propelled vehicles. And by the way, these drones will follow a vehicle that's running.
[02:02:57.670 --> 02:03:01.910]  So you'll see one drone go in and blow up an armored vehicle or a missile launcher. And then
[02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:05.190]  you see the others run out from under the trees and they're running. And then a couple minutes
[02:03:05.190 --> 02:03:10.950]  later, here comes the next ones following them. So it is just a nightmare rise of the machines,
[02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:16.310]  terrible situation, horrible for both sides, a Slavic civil war that our State Department
[02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:21.430]  and George Soros brag, they helped start and run. And it could easily lead to nuclear war.
[02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:28.310]  So now Zelensky is talking about for the first time, maybe a peace deal and letting the Russians
[02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:33.750]  have that Eastern area that's always been part of Russia and not attacking those zones and not
[02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:38.630]  entering NATO. But instead, NATO is accelerating NATO membership and talking about more heavy
[02:03:38.630 --> 02:03:45.110]  weapons and more missiles. The British have already given them medium range cruise missiles
[02:03:45.110 --> 02:03:48.950]  that go 150 miles. They've been using them with Russians. So, but the Russians aren't going to
[02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:53.990]  stop. They lost a third of their population in World War II. That was for 25 to 28 million.
[02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:59.910]  Most of World War II was fought for the Russians, the Nazis, 24 million Germans died, most of them
[02:03:59.910 --> 02:04:04.390]  killed by the Russians. And I'm not belittling our troops, but we only lost what, 600,000 in
[02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:08.310]  World War II. And that was terrible. I almost don't exist. Both my grandfathers almost died
[02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:13.510]  in the Army Air Corps, just flying their minimum number of mission. And so that'll give you that.
[02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:20.710]  That was only 22 mission, you know, over Germany and over Italy. And my dad's dad was in North
[02:04:20.710 --> 02:04:25.110]  Africa, flew missions out of there into Italy, and then some missions out of Italy into Germany.
[02:04:25.110 --> 02:04:28.390]  And we never talk about it. When he died, we got into all the paperwork and it was
[02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:33.590]  spectacular, just 22 missions, because they were losing half of their crews each mission
[02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:39.830]  in a lot of those early missions. And my other grandfather was, I mean, he was a brave guy,
[02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:44.630]  but he was only in three missions and then crash landed in a bunch of other stuff, almost died in
[02:04:44.630 --> 02:04:49.350]  that. So that'll give you an idea of what these wars are like. And this is like World War II
[02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:53.830]  over there. This is just kill, kill, kill. Armies colliding into each other. It is a giant blood
[02:04:53.830 --> 02:04:58.870]  bath that threatens the future of the entire planet. Harrison Smith takes over InfoWars.com.

[02:06:09.190 --> 02:06:13.190]  All right, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. This is the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com,
[02:06:13.190 --> 02:06:18.470]  band dot video, Harrison Smith filling in for Alex as he goes off on a secret mission.
[02:06:19.190 --> 02:06:26.630]  Very exciting stuff. And wow, what a privilege, what an honor to be hosting the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:26.630 --> 02:06:34.230]  I'll try to be worthy of this responsibility. Now, Alex was just talking about the war in Ukraine.
[02:06:34.230 --> 02:06:39.510]  And just this week, a couple of interesting stories coming out about the war in Ukraine
[02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:45.190]  while we're on the topic. Simultaneously, you have a story from the Daily Mail saying Putin warns his
[02:06:45.190 --> 02:06:52.150]  terrifying new Satan 2 missiles capable of carrying 10 nukes will be deployed for combat duty in the
[02:06:52.150 --> 02:06:59.430]  very near future. Simultaneously to this, you have Belarus accepting deployment of tactical nukes
[02:06:59.430 --> 02:07:05.190]  with the president of Belarus, Lukashenko, saying, I will not hesitate to use them should my country
[02:07:05.190 --> 02:07:11.830]  come under threat. And at exactly the same time, you have NATO fast-tracking Ukraine's membership
[02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:17.430]  in that defensive alliance, which I want to remind you, you can't have a defensive alliance
[02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:23.350]  with somebody already engaged in a war. At that point, all you're doing is taking your already
[02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:29.270]  existent defensive alliance and declaring war on Russia. That's all that that means. Defensive
[02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:36.390]  alliances are supposed to be prior to the outbreak of hostilities. But I know that's maybe a little
[02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:41.990]  bit complicated for people. But no, there's no such thing as welcoming somebody into a defensive
[02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:48.390]  alliance when they're already engaged in a large scale land war. With their enemy, it just makes
[02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:54.630]  no sense whatsoever. So it seems as though. People in power in this country are doing everything they
[02:07:54.630 --> 02:08:01.750]  can to aggravate and accelerate. The what seems to be at this point, inevitable outbreak of World
[02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:06.950]  War Three with exchange of nuclear missiles with Russia. Oh, oh, and by the way, at the same time
[02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:15.110]  as this, you have James O'Keefe and the O'Keefe Media Group. Publishing undercover video of a
[02:08:15.110 --> 02:08:22.070]  BlackRock recruiter saying that war is very good for BlackRock, very profitable, very convenient,
[02:08:22.070 --> 02:08:27.110]  very easy to manipulate, to make a little bit of profit off the death of hundreds of thousands of
[02:08:27.110 --> 02:08:34.070]  people, while simultaneously Zelensky announces a partnership with BlackRock and Goldman Sachs
[02:08:34.070 --> 02:08:39.590]  to rebuild Ukraine after it's been destroyed. And they need a cool four hundred eleven billion
[02:08:39.590 --> 02:08:45.350]  dollars to make that happen. So you make money in the buildup. You make money while everybody's
[02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:50.790]  dying and killing each other for no discernible reason. And then once you've destroyed the country
[02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:56.390]  completely, then you get to come in and really cash out as you rebuild the country that you have
[02:08:56.390 --> 02:09:03.990]  helped to destroy. So. Where's the end of this? Where does this end? Who on our side is even
[02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:10.310]  talking about peace? RFK Jr. Well, well, we'll talk a little bit about how he's been treated
[02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:15.830]  by the mainstream media coming up. But when you talk about the war in Ukraine, it really does
[02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:22.950]  seem like both sides are just heading, just rushing headlong into accelerating and expanding
[02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:32.310]  this conflict into a full-fledged nuclear war. And it's horrifying, I guess you could say,
[02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:37.750]  absolutely horrifying to see. Now, we have a lot of other stuff to talk about right now as we speak.
[02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:43.350]  Owen Schroer is trending number one on Twitter. Lots of people wondering what's going on with
[02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:50.390]  him and how he's doing. Huffington Post seems to be the article that everybody is pointing towards.
[02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:55.030]  Infowars host Owen Schroer pleads guilty to January 6th Capitol riot charge, which, again,
[02:09:55.030 --> 02:10:01.110]  is just absurd, ridiculous. And it's absurdity piled upon absurdity, right? The only reason
[02:10:01.110 --> 02:10:07.910]  Owen Schroer is facing any legal troubles at all right now is because of, as I understand it,
[02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:13.270]  stipulations made during the last time that he had his civil rights violated at the U.S. Capitol.
[02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:23.030]  When he, months or maybe even years before January 6th, protested the, well, law against protesting
[02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:29.590]  at the Capitol, where in this one area of the Capitol every single day you had paid protesters
[02:10:29.590 --> 02:10:34.230]  who were just the most pathetic looking people of all time, carrying signs, waving signs, marching
[02:10:34.230 --> 02:10:40.630]  around protesting against Donald Trump. Owen Schroer tries it and he gets slapped with a,
[02:10:41.590 --> 02:10:48.390]  you know, legal prevention measure. So it's just absurdity upon absurdity, tyranny upon tyranny
[02:10:48.390 --> 02:10:54.230]  taking place with Owen Schroer. And, you know, God only knows what's going to go on, you know,
[02:10:54.230 --> 02:11:00.470]  from here on out. I used to be able to host Infowars feeling very confident in the fact that
[02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:05.830]  I could say whatever the heck I wanted. After all, I'm not calling for violence against anybody. I'm
[02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:10.710]  not breaking any laws. I'm doing nothing that would put me outside of the confines of the First
[02:11:10.710 --> 02:11:14.630]  Amendment. So what do I have to worry about? Well, you can't really have that type of confidence
[02:11:14.630 --> 02:11:19.670]  anymore. You can't really have that type of assurity that we live in a nation with free
[02:11:19.670 --> 02:11:26.230]  speech provisions that provides protections for peaceful political activists. Now that's all out
[02:11:26.230 --> 02:11:31.270]  the window. It's whatever the hell they want it to be. But this got me thinking. And there was
[02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:35.670]  another story that came out today that I think stands in stark contrast to the way that Owen
[02:11:35.670 --> 02:11:43.430]  Schroer and other January 6th protesters are being treated by the judicial system,
[02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:48.950]  if you can even call it that. And this sort of ties into Hunter Biden as well. So it's really
[02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:53.750]  overtly obvious when it's somebody like Hunter Biden or the Bidens versus Trump,
[02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:58.710]  when you've got these high level accusations flying back and forth and one side gets the
[02:11:58.710 --> 02:12:04.310]  book thrown at him continuously and just, you know, the Trump treatment that Trump and his
[02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:08.710]  whole family is getting versus the Biden treatment. But that's not exclusive to the
[02:12:08.710 --> 02:12:15.190]  people in power or the people who are at the highest level of our politics. That's a trend
[02:12:15.190 --> 02:12:20.790]  that is actually more apparent and I think significantly more dangerous at the lower
[02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:26.070]  level. So here's the story from today. Andy Ngo reports from Postmillennial.com,
[02:12:26.070 --> 02:12:32.710]  no prison time for pedophile Portland Antifa member who pleaded not guilty or pleaded guilty,
[02:12:32.710 --> 02:12:40.550]  rather to stabbing black conservative at 2020 riot. So Blake David Hamp 46 pled guilty in a
[02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:46.550]  sweetheart deal to felony second degree attempted assault, but he will serve no prison time instead
[02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:51.990]  getting just three years of probation for nearly stabbing somebody to death.
[02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:57.510]  On July 25th, 2020, during the height of the nightly far left writing in downtown Portland,
[02:12:57.510 --> 02:13:03.430]  Hamp was recorded on video stabbing Andrew Duncombe. Duncombe was hospitalized and narrowly
[02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:09.910]  survived being paralyzed as the blade pierced inches from his spinal cord. So stab a guy in
[02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:17.590]  the back nearly paralyzed him as a part of a domestic terror onslaught. No jail time,
[02:13:17.590 --> 02:13:25.910]  no prison time whatsoever, just three years of probation. So just let's compare and contrast
[02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:30.310]  here. You've got Owen Schroer didn't even enter the Capitol, was actually telling people not to
[02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:35.910]  enter the Capitol, not even accused of doing anything violent. But compare it to somebody
[02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:44.950]  like Stuart Rhodes, Oath Keepers, unarmed, no violent accusation whatsoever, 18 years in prison
[02:13:45.590 --> 02:13:51.350]  for merely being near the Capitol during January 6th. Meanwhile, stab a man in the back and almost
[02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:58.070]  kill him, no jail whatsoever. And these are just things I could remember off the top of my head,
[02:13:58.070 --> 02:14:02.710]  like between the shows, between ending American Journal and doing this show, I just was searching
[02:14:02.710 --> 02:14:09.350]  things that I remember having happened in the last year or so. What about this? Michigan man
[02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:17.590]  who shot pro-life canvasser in back avoids jail time, sentenced to community service and a $350
[02:14:17.670 --> 02:14:22.950]  fine. In 2022, a Michigan man shot an old woman in the back as she was leaving his properly,
[02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:28.070]  narrowly missing her spine because he considered her a right-wing extremist. Well, she was
[02:14:28.070 --> 02:14:35.510]  canvassing and trying to do her patriotic duty of supporting what she believed in politically.
[02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:41.510]  She was shot in the back for her political position. The man who shot her, think about this,
[02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:48.310]  man shot an old woman in the back because she's right-wing, no jail time at all, $350
[02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:54.070]  fine in community service. I mean, you want to talk about unequal. It's not like, well,
[02:14:54.070 --> 02:14:57.910]  Owen Schroer shot somebody in the back and this guy shot somebody in the back, but Owen's got
[02:14:57.910 --> 02:15:02.390]  to go to jail and this guy doesn't. No, no, no, no. You shoot somebody in the back, no jail time.
[02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:08.150]  You stand outside of a riot and tell people not to engage in it, you may be facing jail time.
[02:15:08.150 --> 02:15:12.390]  This is how unequal things are. And again, we're just getting started. What about the man who
[02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:18.230]  hurled unopened beer cans at Republican Ted Cruz, hitting him in the neck and chest earlier this
[02:15:18.230 --> 02:15:22.630]  year? Well, those charges have just been totally dropped. Grand jury decided not to indict a
[02:15:22.630 --> 02:15:27.830]  Houston man for pelting Senator Ted Cruz with beer cans during the Astros World Series parade
[02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:33.510]  late last year. No charges whatsoever, just totally dropped. I mean, think about that.
[02:15:33.590 --> 02:15:37.750]  And people are just like, well, whatever it's in it. Tell you what, the invitation's open.
[02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:43.830]  Come to Infowars, stand about 20 yards away from me and I'll hurl unopened beer cans at you and
[02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:49.270]  we'll see whether that should qualify as assault or not. So like attack with a potentially deadly
[02:15:49.270 --> 02:15:55.190]  weapon, a Republican senator, charges dropped, no jail time, no community service, no, no fine
[02:15:55.190 --> 02:15:59.510]  whatsoever. And we're just getting started. You wanted to plug Rainforce. Do you like Rainforce?
[02:15:59.750 --> 02:16:04.870]  Yeah. So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley. How do I write all the books that I do? Four books with
[02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:09.510]  Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with
[02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:16.230]  Alex Jones? That's because I use Rainforce every day. What I always need is I always need
[02:16:16.230 --> 02:16:21.110]  some sort of boost in the morning. And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well,
[02:16:21.110 --> 02:16:26.470]  take good vitamins. But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is
[02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:32.310]  Rainforce. I'll take Rainforce in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good
[02:16:32.310 --> 02:16:37.910]  for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff. So it really is true that Rainforce
[02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:42.390]  is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing. All right. We love you. We'll be right
[02:16:42.390 --> 02:16:47.830]  back. Get your Rainforce Plus, Rainforce Ultra and TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com. We'll be
[02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:59.510]  right back with our number two. This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show,

[02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:07.110]  is a historic book that documents the global, in their own words, plan for our future. That is
[02:18:07.110 --> 02:18:11.190]  the hellish future. Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting
[02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:15.030]  to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:19.670]  at bookstores, Amazon, or InfowarsStore.com. But you will never be able to get another signed
[02:18:19.670 --> 02:18:24.790]  copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about a thousand left of
[02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:29.990]  them right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy,
[02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:34.550]  at InfowarsStore.com. And there is a markup there, because this is a fundraiser to keep us
[02:18:34.550 --> 02:18:39.030]  on the air. So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book. You'll also know
[02:18:39.030 --> 02:18:42.630]  that you help keep Infowars on the air. I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed
[02:18:42.630 --> 02:18:47.910]  copies of the book or unsigned copies. But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet
[02:18:47.910 --> 02:18:52.630]  to go to InfowarsStore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate
[02:18:52.630 --> 02:18:57.430]  to the library or give them to the local school. This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you and thank
[02:18:57.430 --> 02:19:03.670]  you for your support. Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our
[02:19:03.670 --> 02:19:09.830]  entire food supply. Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace
[02:19:09.830 --> 02:19:15.190]  element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population. And there are two
[02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:21.670]  things we need to do about it. We need to practice more regenerative farming. There are plenty of
[02:19:21.670 --> 02:19:29.110]  proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:35.590]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day. Derived from ancient
[02:19:35.590 --> 02:19:42.470]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface, our Infowars Life Survival Shield
[02:19:42.470 --> 02:19:51.590]  X3 is hands down the best. Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[02:19:59.110 --> 02:20:07.270]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:22.400]  Alright, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show, Harrison Smith
[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:25.640]  sitting in for Alex for this last hour.
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:32.960]  I, of course, host the American Journal each and every weekday morning, 8 to 11 a.m., just
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:35.880]  preceding the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:43.280]  And every morning we are just, it's just an onslaught, it's just a maelstrom of nonsense
[02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:44.280]  across the board.
[02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:49.480]  There's always just significantly more news than we could possibly cover even in a three
[02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:52.060]  hour block.
[02:20:52.060 --> 02:20:56.720]  But I always like hosting either later in the Alex Jones Show or if I get to host the
[02:20:56.720 --> 02:20:59.080]  War Room later, because I get to prepare a little bit.
[02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:01.800]  So I've done a little bit of preparing for this.
[02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:07.280]  I've compiled just some stories that I've remembered off the top of my head, and even
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:13.040]  as I'm covering these, I'm remembering others of times that leftists have gotten off scot-free
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:18.680]  with actually committing terroristic political violence.
[02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:24.480]  So when you think about Owen Schroeder right now facing years in prison for doing literally
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:31.640]  nothing, just being in a place at a time, that's what he's accused of.
[02:21:31.640 --> 02:21:36.360]  It's worth it to remember how the left is treated.
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:42.180]  And really, as we go through some of these stories, it's, oh, it's something.
[02:21:42.180 --> 02:21:43.180]  It's something else.
[02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:44.180]  It's absolutely insane.
[02:21:44.180 --> 02:21:48.120]  So just to catch you up in case you're just tuning in, the guy who threw unopened beer
[02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:52.900]  cans at Ted Cruz, hitting him in the chest and neck, charges totally dropped.
[02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:59.560]  No fine, no jail time, no parole, no nothing, just an attack on a political enemy, and charges
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:00.560]  totally dropped.
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:01.560]  Okay?
[02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:06.320]  No man who shot a pro-life canvasser in the back because she was Republican, no jail time
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:10.000]  whatsoever, sentenced to community service and a $350 fine.
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000]  Okay?
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:14.560]  So shoot a woman in the back, no big deal, you're a leftist.
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:19.140]  No prison time at all for a pedophile Portland Antifa member who pled guilty to stabbing
[02:22:19.140 --> 02:22:24.800]  a black conservative at a 2020 riot, so hey, shoot a woman in the back, stab a man in the
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:29.960]  back for political reasons, no jail time whatsoever, maybe a fine, this guy got some probation,
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:33.320]  he's got to check in every once in a while, that'll teach him, that'll teach him not to
[02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:36.040]  stab Republicans in the back, I'm sure.
[02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:37.040]  Let's keep going, shall we?
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:43.600]  What about that 40-something-year-old man who ran over a teenager and killed him because
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:45.080]  the teenager was Republican?
[02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:46.080]  Remember that?
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:49.080]  Remember the guy came out and was like, yeah, that kid was Republican, so I hit him with
[02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:50.840]  my car, he like admitted all of it?
[02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:54.680]  Well, that murder charge has been reduced to manslaughter for a North Dakota man who
[02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:57.540]  struck, ran over, and killed a conservative team.
[02:22:57.540 --> 02:23:03.900]  So on Monday, this is from a while ago, but not that long ago, couple weeks maybe, murder
[02:23:03.900 --> 02:23:05.100]  charges reduced.
[02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:09.300]  On Monday, North Dakota man accused of running over a teenager he deemed to be a Republican
[02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:12.580]  extremist had his charges reduced to manslaughter.
[02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:17.580]  He was originally charged with murder, a Class AA felony over the death of 18-year-old Kyler
[02:23:17.580 --> 02:23:22.060]  Ellingson in McHenry last September, but according to the Associated Press, Foster County State
[02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:26.340]  Attorney Kara Brinster's decision to reduce the charges was not a part of a plea deal
[02:23:26.540 --> 02:23:30.740]  and Brinster is still expected to appear in court for trial beginning May 30th.
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:36.140]  So not even, this isn't, you know, the outcome of a plea deal where he admits to it in exchange
[02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:39.180]  for not getting the death penalty, he just gets life imprisonment, no, no, no.
[02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:43.860]  Now this was just on her own accord, hey, you ran over and murdered a teenager because
[02:23:43.860 --> 02:23:44.860]  he's Republican?
[02:23:44.860 --> 02:23:47.300]  Well, you don't deserve murder for that.
[02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:51.020]  Clearly, you're, you know, acting on behalf of our globalist masters and you deserve to
[02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:57.300]  be rewarded by reducing your charges to simple manslaughter.
[02:23:57.300 --> 02:23:58.780]  Completely insane.
[02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:01.340]  Completely and utterly insane.
[02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:05.500]  But that's just the individual stories and there are so many others, like I'm pretty
[02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:10.640]  sure the guy who brought a pipe bomb to a January 6th protest, I'm pretty sure he got
[02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:12.500]  his charges totally dropped.
[02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:13.900]  I mean, there have been a lot of these.
[02:24:13.900 --> 02:24:18.980]  There have been, there were the lawyers in New York that threw Molotov cocktails into
[02:24:18.980 --> 02:24:19.980]  cop cars.
[02:24:19.980 --> 02:24:22.260]  I'm pretty sure they got nothing but probation.
[02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:27.180]  So again, when we're talking about the unfairness of the justice system, it's not they do something
[02:24:27.180 --> 02:24:31.060]  and we do something and then there's an unequal application of the law.
[02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:33.260]  It's we do nothing.
[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:37.460]  We actually behave completely within the bounds of the First Amendment and go participate
[02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:42.020]  in a 99.9% peaceful protest.
[02:24:42.020 --> 02:24:47.820]  And we face years in prison, decades in prison in some cases for the likes of Stuart Rhodes
[02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:48.820]  and others.
[02:24:49.660 --> 02:24:50.660]  They've been accused of a violent crime.
[02:24:50.660 --> 02:24:54.820]  However, you shoot a Republican in the back, you stab a Republican in the back, you run
[02:24:54.820 --> 02:25:00.980]  over and kill a Republican while they're there to coddle you and to let you ride out.
[02:25:00.980 --> 02:25:04.260]  But these are just individual instances that we're pointing to.
[02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:08.900]  What about the systemic behavior of the justice system?
[02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:11.100]  Well, the Guardian has this story.
[02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:16.940]  Most charges dropped against George Floyd protesters, analysis shows the vast majority
[02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:22.060]  of citations and charges against George Floyd protesters were ultimately dropped, dismissed
[02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:26.420]  or otherwise not filed, according to a Guardian analysis of law enforcement records and media
[02:25:26.420 --> 02:25:29.980]  reports in a dozen jurisdictions around the nation.
[02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:32.940]  Some prosecutors and law enforcement observers charged the department's carried out mass
[02:25:32.940 --> 02:25:37.700]  arrests as a crowd control tactic as means to silence peaceful protesters and as public
[02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:41.940]  relations strategy designed to turn the public against demonstrators by making them appear
[02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:44.380]  more violent than they were.
[02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:47.900]  Just do I even need to do I even need to debunk that?
[02:25:47.900 --> 02:25:49.820]  It's absurd on its face, right?
[02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:55.180]  Just trust your own recall in that regard.
[02:25:55.180 --> 02:26:00.780]  In most of the dozen of dozen jurisdictions examined, at least 90 percent of cases were
[02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:02.700]  dropped or dismissed.
[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:07.820]  In some cases like Dallas and Philadelphia, as many as 95 percent of citations were dropped
[02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:09.500]  or simply not prosecuted.
[02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:12.540]  So, again, just compare that to January 6.
[02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:14.500]  Compare that to the.
[02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:21.660]  All out full scale roundup of anybody even associated with January 6th, whether you did
[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:28.140]  anything violent or not, whether you yourself were subject to police violence or not.
[02:26:28.140 --> 02:26:29.540]  There was no amnesty there.
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:31.780]  There was no dropping the charges there.
[02:26:31.780 --> 02:26:34.340]  It's been a ruthless.
[02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:39.860]  Exaction of vengeance by the deep state against anybody engaged in that, but it gets a lot
[02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:40.860]  worse.
[02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:41.860]  It actually gets even worse.
[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:47.500]  It gets even more insane and outrageous as we keep reading, of course, in line with the
[02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:50.980]  last article charges against hundreds of New York City rioters.
[02:26:50.980 --> 02:26:52.380]  Looters have been dropped.
[02:26:52.380 --> 02:26:56.500]  Hundreds of alleged looters and rioters busted last year in protest over George Floyd's murder
[02:26:56.500 --> 02:27:00.980]  by police have had their charges dropped, according to NYPD data figures ripped as
[02:27:00.980 --> 02:27:04.780]  disgusting by local business owners.
[02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:06.340]  Mass looting took place in June.
[02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:09.980]  More than 60 percent of arrestees have had charges dropped, according to investigation
[02:27:09.980 --> 02:27:11.660]  by NBC New York.
[02:27:11.660 --> 02:27:15.340]  Seventy three of the one hundred and eighteen people arrested in the borough had their cases
[02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:16.340]  shelved altogether.
[02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:21.020]  Another 19 were convicted on lesser accounts like trespassing, which carries no jail time.
[02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:27.140]  Eighteen cases remain open, with NBC not accounting for the other eight arrests.
[02:27:27.140 --> 02:27:34.660]  So again, you riot on behalf of the deep state and they're there not just to drop your charges.
[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:36.340]  But what about this?
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:42.420]  U.S. cities to pay a record eighty million dollars to people injured in the 2020 racial
[02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:44.740]  justice protest.
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:52.780]  Eighty million dollars is actually being paid to the protesters who not only have had their
[02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:59.020]  arrests dropped and their convictions or their, you know, prosecution tabled, they're actually
[02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:03.780]  getting checks for upwards of twenty thousand dollars.
[02:28:03.900 --> 02:28:04.900]  I know.
[02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:08.060]  This is how just completely and utterly insane this is.
[02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:12.540]  They say three years after the George Floyd riots, at least 19 U.S. cities will pay more
[02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:17.180]  than eighty million dollars total to protesters who sustained various injuries as a result
[02:28:17.180 --> 02:28:22.940]  of law enforcement actions ranging from being tear cast to being shot with projectiles.
[02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:25.780]  They've filed dozens of civil lawsuits.
[02:28:25.780 --> 02:28:26.780]  Eighty million dollars.
[02:28:26.780 --> 02:28:27.780]  And what does this look like?
[02:28:27.780 --> 02:28:30.820]  Well, New York will pay millions to protesters violently corralled.
[02:28:30.820 --> 02:28:33.740]  Well, they were corralled violently.
[02:28:33.740 --> 02:28:39.580]  So each one of them is getting twenty one thousand five hundred dollars each.
[02:28:39.580 --> 02:28:45.660]  Hundreds of these people are each getting twenty one point five thousand dollars.
[02:28:45.660 --> 02:28:49.540]  Protesters win nine million dollars settlement in police demilitarization pledge for twenty
[02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:53.260]  twenty year tear gassing to get tear gas in Philadelphia.
[02:28:53.260 --> 02:28:57.500]  You get a check for twenty thousand dollars.
[02:28:57.500 --> 02:28:59.260]  Two amazing new tropics.
[02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:03.980]  That means brain power are back in stock and in full or store dot com.

[02:29:06.420 --> 02:29:10.740]  We haven't offered these for 50 percent off since last Christmas.
[02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:12.300]  These are amazing products.
[02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:15.060]  And for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.

[02:29:20.780 --> 02:29:22.500]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[02:29:22.500 --> 02:29:27.540]  Then our brain force plus is a good basic clean new trouble gives you four to six hours
[02:29:27.540 --> 02:29:32.660]  of amazing energy again with no hangover, no jitters, both products back in stock in

[02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:49.020]  And no, you're funding the second American Revolution, 1776 worldwide.
[02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:52.380]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:29:52.380 --> 02:29:54.780]  And the answer for energy is brain force.
[02:29:58.580 --> 02:30:01.820]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[02:30:01.820 --> 02:30:07.020]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[02:30:07.020 --> 02:30:08.020]  us.
[02:30:08.020 --> 02:30:13.460]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:16.420]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:30:16.420 --> 02:30:21.300]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:30:21.460 --> 02:30:23.900]  five, six, seven days a week.
[02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:24.900]  It's really just incredible.
[02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:28.860]  So for myself, the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:34.740]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:30:34.740 --> 02:30:36.140]  I know you spread the word.
[02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:37.140]  I know you pray for us.
[02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:38.140]  That's wonderful.
[02:30:38.140 --> 02:30:39.140]  Keep doing it.
[02:30:39.140 --> 02:30:43.260]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowars store dot com and you never buy great
[02:30:43.260 --> 02:30:46.020]  products that enrich and empower your life all at the same time.
[02:30:46.020 --> 02:30:47.020]  Give us on air.
[02:30:47.020 --> 02:30:50.380]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowars store
[02:30:50.380 --> 02:30:51.380]  dot com.
[02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:55.660]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowars store dot com, our funding problems
[02:30:55.660 --> 02:30:56.660]  will be over.
[02:30:56.660 --> 02:30:57.660]  Please take action now.
[02:30:57.660 --> 02:31:01.020]  In the short time we have, I can't get into all the incredible ingredients in Super Female
[02:31:01.020 --> 02:31:02.020]  Vitality.
[02:31:02.020 --> 02:31:05.780]  Go to Infowars store dot com, read about the ingredients, look them up for yourself, and

[02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:24.100]  Only a few hundred bottles left, but the good news is we have several thousand bottles
[02:31:24.100 --> 02:31:27.380]  left of Super Female Vitality that's the same formula.
[02:31:27.380 --> 02:31:28.380]  It boosts men.
[02:31:28.380 --> 02:31:29.380]  It boosts women.
[02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:34.740]  It works great, but women like pink labels, men like different color labels, so it works
[02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:35.860]  for men as well.
[02:31:35.860 --> 02:31:36.940]  It's the same formula.
[02:31:36.940 --> 02:31:40.500]  It's an incredible formula, and it funds our operation, and there's another important part
[02:31:40.500 --> 02:31:42.500]  of the overall information.
[02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:45.100]  It's 50% off for a limited time.

[02:31:58.380 --> 02:32:02.660]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[02:32:02.660 --> 02:32:04.340]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:06.740]  People said no way he's the most powerful that ever happened.
[02:32:06.740 --> 02:32:08.700]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:32:08.700 --> 02:32:11.700]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him, but
[02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:14.900]  as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:32:14.900 --> 02:32:19.900]  It's the same thing with Infowars, but Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George
[02:32:19.900 --> 02:32:23.300]  Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[02:32:23.300 --> 02:32:28.220]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners, and when you support us, we're
[02:32:28.220 --> 02:32:29.220]  unstoppable.
[02:32:29.220 --> 02:32:33.620]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[02:32:33.620 --> 02:32:38.740]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people, so I want to thank you for your support and
[02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:43.260]  encourage viewers and listeners to understand, please don't take Infowars for granted.
[02:32:43.260 --> 02:32:44.540]  We're barely hanging on.
[02:32:44.540 --> 02:32:47.980]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support while getting great
[02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:51.700]  products at the same time at Infowarsstore.com, so don't procrastinate.
[02:32:51.700 --> 02:32:56.340]  Go to Infowarsstore.com, get amazing products, and keep us on the air, and never submit to
[02:32:56.340 --> 02:32:57.340]  these tyrants.
[02:32:57.340 --> 02:33:06.060]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:08.530 --> 02:33:16.530]  Alright, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:16.530 --> 02:33:19.530]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.530 --> 02:33:23.530]  Infowars.com, band.video, Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[02:33:23.530 --> 02:33:28.530]  Of course, you can always support us by going to infowarsstore.com.
[02:33:28.530 --> 02:33:33.530]  We ask, beg, and beseech you, keep us on air, keep us in the fight against the New World Order,
[02:33:33.530 --> 02:33:41.530]  as after all, not only have we had massive, unprecedented victories in the very near past,
[02:33:41.530 --> 02:33:46.530]  but everybody listening to this who has ever gone to infowarsstore.com
[02:33:46.530 --> 02:33:52.530]  can pat yourself on the back as being ultimately important.
[02:33:52.530 --> 02:33:57.530]  I cannot overstate how important your contribution is to Infowars,
[02:33:57.530 --> 02:34:04.530]  withstanding the concerted attacks that we've been under for the last several years.
[02:34:04.530 --> 02:34:08.530]  I'm telling you, looking back, it didn't look good for us for a while,
[02:34:08.530 --> 02:34:14.530]  and I wouldn't blame people a couple years ago for thinking Infowars wouldn't make it that long,
[02:34:14.530 --> 02:34:17.530]  but not only are we still here, we're getting through the worst of it, really.
[02:34:17.530 --> 02:34:23.530]  All of the attacks have really come to nothing, and here we are, more powerful than ever,
[02:34:23.530 --> 02:34:29.530]  more popular than ever, still expanding, still changing the game across the board.
[02:34:29.530 --> 02:34:33.530]  So thank you so much for your contribution to this effort.
[02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:35.530]  We promise we are all in on this.
[02:34:35.530 --> 02:34:38.530]  We will continue to do everything we can to defeat the New World Order
[02:34:38.530 --> 02:34:43.530]  and save humanity from their disgusting grasp.
[02:34:43.530 --> 02:34:47.530]  All we ask is that you support us in this mission by going to infowarsstore.com.
[02:34:48.530 --> 02:34:52.530]  And of course, it's not just me and Alex and Owen as show hosts,
[02:34:52.530 --> 02:34:56.530]  but every one of us has the entire crew behind us,
[02:34:56.530 --> 02:35:00.530]  without which we couldn't do anything that we do here.
[02:35:00.530 --> 02:35:04.530]  And you can just see the level of talent that Infowars has.
[02:35:04.530 --> 02:35:06.530]  It's pretty astonishing.
[02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:10.530]  After this, Rob will be hosting the War Room for Owen Schroyer,
[02:35:10.530 --> 02:35:15.530]  and a couple weeks ago, Rhys, our editor, was hosted for me when I had to go out of town.
[02:35:15.530 --> 02:35:21.530]  I mean, the amount of talent and dedication that our crew has to this cause
[02:35:21.530 --> 02:35:26.530]  and to this movement and to this fight against the New World Order is really unprecedented.
[02:35:26.530 --> 02:35:29.530]  So you're not just supporting Alex Jones.
[02:35:29.530 --> 02:35:35.530]  You're supporting this entire company and culture of patriotism that he's fostered and created
[02:35:35.530 --> 02:35:38.530]  and led like a general, the head of his army.
[02:35:38.530 --> 02:35:40.530]  So thank you so much for your support,
[02:35:40.530 --> 02:35:46.530]  and we will continue to do everything we can to tell the truth in this sea of lies.
[02:35:48.530 --> 02:35:53.530]  Now, I actually didn't get a chance to play as much as I wanted to earlier today
[02:35:53.530 --> 02:35:56.530]  of the latest Tucker episode, episode number six,
[02:35:56.530 --> 02:36:01.530]  where he talks about Peter Hotez and RFK Jr.
[02:36:01.530 --> 02:36:04.530]  So I'm going to go to this clip now, and we'll watch some of it.
[02:36:04.530 --> 02:36:08.530]  Hopefully we'll watch all of it, but I want to come back once we watch this
[02:36:08.530 --> 02:36:15.530]  and talk about why this is so important, how disturbing the reaction to this whole debacle has been.
[02:36:15.530 --> 02:36:20.530]  A lot of times things will dominate the news cycle,
[02:36:20.530 --> 02:36:22.530]  and then a year later you forget that it ever happened.
[02:36:22.530 --> 02:36:24.530]  I don't think this is one of those things.
[02:36:24.530 --> 02:36:31.530]  I think this is something that while Peter Hotez might be a name that we stop hearing much about in the near future,
[02:36:31.530 --> 02:36:36.530]  the trend that this represents is the trend of there should be no debate,
[02:36:36.530 --> 02:36:40.530]  there is no debate, debate is in fact dangerous,
[02:36:40.530 --> 02:36:48.530]  discussing the dictates by our fiat overlords is treason against them.
[02:36:48.530 --> 02:36:51.530]  That's a trend that's not going anywhere.
[02:36:51.530 --> 02:36:53.530]  It's going to be around for a while, unless we defeat it,
[02:36:53.530 --> 02:36:59.530]  unless we hold their feet to the fire and expose them for the tyrannical frauds that they truly are.
[02:36:59.530 --> 02:37:04.530]  So let's go now to this clip of Tucker Carlson.
[02:37:04.530 --> 02:37:09.530]  It's a bunch of clips of old Hotez played on Tucker and then Tucker's response and commentary.
[02:37:09.530 --> 02:37:11.530]  Let's go to clip number three now, please.
[02:37:11.530 --> 02:37:14.530]  All about mask compliance.
[02:37:14.530 --> 02:37:17.530]  That's going to be absolutely critical because if you don't have masks,
[02:37:17.530 --> 02:37:19.530]  remember this virus aerosolizes.
[02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:21.530]  So even six feet is not enough.
[02:37:21.530 --> 02:37:23.530]  It can go 17, 18 feet, several meters.
[02:37:23.530 --> 02:37:27.530]  What we really have to do is have vaccine mandates in the schools.
[02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:32.530]  We should have a rule that anyone who walks into a school over the age of 12 has to be vaccinated.
[02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:36.530]  This is the nature of the anti-vaccine movement in this country.
[02:37:36.530 --> 02:37:43.530]  It's somehow married now to far right wing extremism and white nationalist group.
[02:37:43.530 --> 02:37:51.530]  Anyone who's unvaccinated and has been lucky enough to escape COVID, your luck is about to run out.
[02:37:51.530 --> 02:37:56.530]  And I call it anti-science aggression coming from Senator Rand Paul, Senator Johnson,
[02:37:56.530 --> 02:38:01.530]  members of the House of Representatives, in addition to those two senators, are killers.
[02:38:01.530 --> 02:38:03.530]  It's all about mask compliance.
[02:38:03.530 --> 02:38:06.530]  We must have vaccine mandates for children.
[02:38:06.530 --> 02:38:08.530]  Take the vaccine or you will die.
[02:38:08.530 --> 02:38:14.530]  Anyone who disagrees with me is a white nationalist and a killer and probably an agent of Putin.
[02:38:14.530 --> 02:38:16.530]  Do we say probably? Let's revise that.
[02:38:16.530 --> 02:38:18.530]  Certainly an agent of Putin.
[02:38:18.530 --> 02:38:20.530]  Again, here is Dr. Peter Hotez.
[02:38:20.530 --> 02:38:26.530]  We're starting to see now those same anti-vaccine messages that's coming out of the U.S.
[02:38:26.530 --> 02:38:29.530]  And now we're finding it in Africa and Latin America.
[02:38:29.530 --> 02:38:34.530]  And remember what the other reason we're seeing this is the Putin government has,
[02:38:34.530 --> 02:38:36.530]  this has been reported by U.S. and British intelligence,
[02:38:36.530 --> 02:38:41.530]  has been piling on with this whole systematic program of what's being called weaponized health communications,
[02:38:41.530 --> 02:38:48.530]  trying to destabilize democracies with anti-vaccine, anti-science messages and targeting.
[02:38:48.530 --> 02:38:53.530]  So according to British and U.S. intelligence, anyone who disagrees with Dr. Peter Hotez
[02:38:53.530 --> 02:38:59.530]  is a disloyal American working to destabilize our democracy on behalf of Vladimir Putin.
[02:38:59.530 --> 02:39:07.530]  Now, by comparison, never in his life has Bobby Kennedy Jr. said anything half that demented.
[02:39:07.530 --> 02:39:10.530]  But keep in mind, Peter Hotez claims to have a valid medical license.
[02:39:10.530 --> 02:39:13.530]  He is allowed to treat patients.
[02:39:13.530 --> 02:39:18.530]  After a while, even MSNBC viewers were going to have some questions about a guy who talks like that.
[02:39:18.530 --> 02:39:20.530]  And apparently some of them did.
[02:39:20.530 --> 02:39:27.530]  As the lockdowns wore on, the population started to notice that many of the core claims the TV doctors were making were untrue.
[02:39:27.530 --> 02:39:30.530]  You only need one shot. If you got the shot, you would never get sick.
[02:39:30.530 --> 02:39:33.530]  You would never pass the virus to others and so on.
[02:39:33.530 --> 02:39:36.530]  They said these things, as you know, again and again.
[02:39:36.530 --> 02:39:39.530]  Ultimately, they were proven wrong, but they never admitted it.
[02:39:39.530 --> 02:39:42.530]  They just attacked the people who noticed.
[02:39:42.530 --> 02:39:49.530]  Here's Dr. Peter Hotez calling for the Biden administration to arrest anyone who questions the COVID vaccine.
[02:39:49.530 --> 02:39:55.530]  The Biden administration has to realize that anti-science is a killer, disinformation.
[02:39:55.530 --> 02:39:59.530]  It's not even just disinformation. This is an anti-science empire right now.
[02:39:59.530 --> 02:40:02.530]  And we need homeland security. We need the Justice Department.
[02:40:02.530 --> 02:40:04.530]  We've really got to figure this out.
[02:40:04.530 --> 02:40:09.530]  And Health and Human Services will not be able to figure this out on their own.
[02:40:09.530 --> 02:40:12.530]  It's not a medical problem. It's a law enforcement problem.
[02:40:12.530 --> 02:40:14.530]  They've doubted me. Arrest them.
[02:40:14.530 --> 02:40:17.530]  It's a horrifying outburst, if you think about it.
[02:40:17.530 --> 02:40:20.530]  If you were on tape saying something like that, you would be deeply ashamed.
[02:40:20.530 --> 02:40:25.530]  But Peter Hotez is not ashamed. He's become even more grandiose.
[02:40:25.530 --> 02:40:30.530]  Hotez has written a self-congratulatory new book called The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science.
[02:40:30.530 --> 02:40:33.530]  A scientist warning, as if you were a scientist.
[02:40:33.530 --> 02:40:37.530]  Here's how Hotez describes himself in the book's promotional literature.
[02:40:37.530 --> 02:40:40.530]  During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic,
[02:40:40.530 --> 02:40:43.530]  one renowned scientist in his famous bow tie,
[02:40:43.530 --> 02:40:49.530]  appearing daily on major news networks such as MSNBC, NPR and BBC and others.
[02:40:49.530 --> 02:40:53.530]  Dr. Peter J. Hotez often went without sleep,
[02:40:53.530 --> 02:40:57.530]  working around the clock to develop a nonprofit COVID-19 vaccine
[02:40:57.530 --> 02:40:59.530]  and to keep the public informed.
[02:40:59.530 --> 02:41:03.530]  During that time, he was one of the most trusted voices on the pandemic
[02:41:03.530 --> 02:41:08.530]  and was even nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his selfless work.
[02:41:08.530 --> 02:41:11.530]  He also became one of the main targets of anti-science rhetoric
[02:41:11.530 --> 02:41:14.530]  that gained traction through conservative news media.
[02:41:14.530 --> 02:41:17.530]  End quote, though we could go on.
[02:41:17.530 --> 02:41:22.530]  So here you have a renowned scientist, selfless, trusted, going without sleep,
[02:41:22.530 --> 02:41:26.530]  self-denying, persecuted by extremists for daring to tell the truth,
[02:41:26.530 --> 02:41:29.530]  the Albert Schweitzer of cable news.
[02:41:29.530 --> 02:41:32.530]  That's Dr. Peter J. Hotez.
[02:41:32.530 --> 02:41:37.530]  The fact that a partisan buffoon like Peter Hotez can describe himself this way
[02:41:37.530 --> 02:41:40.530]  with a straight face and the backing of a publisher
[02:41:40.530 --> 02:41:42.530]  makes you despair for the country's future.
[02:41:42.530 --> 02:41:45.530]  But don't despair. There is hope.
[02:41:45.530 --> 02:41:48.530]  Hotez will never debate Bobby Kennedy Jr., but it doesn't matter.
[02:41:48.530 --> 02:41:50.530]  Kennedy has already won.
[02:41:50.530 --> 02:41:52.530]  He's more honest than Dr. Peter Hotez,
[02:41:52.530 --> 02:41:54.530]  and that's obvious to anyone who's paying attention.
[02:41:54.530 --> 02:41:58.530]  A New Economist poll shows that Kennedy is more popular and far less hated
[02:41:58.530 --> 02:42:01.530]  than either major party frontrunner.
[02:42:01.530 --> 02:42:06.530]  After almost 20 years of being silenced, Bobby Kennedy Jr. is being heard.
[02:42:06.530 --> 02:42:08.530]  Absolutely incredible stuff.
[02:42:08.530 --> 02:42:12.530]  The entire episode that Tucker released yesterday is bombshell after bombshell.
[02:42:12.530 --> 02:42:15.530]  But here's why this is ultimately important.
[02:42:15.530 --> 02:42:18.530]  It's not so much about Peter Hotez versus RFK Jr.
[02:42:18.530 --> 02:42:21.530]  It's not so much about do vaccines cause autism.
[02:42:21.530 --> 02:42:27.530]  It's about the concept of debate as a moderating factor of political discourse,
[02:42:27.530 --> 02:42:30.530]  that you can't impose things on people.
[02:42:31.530 --> 02:42:36.530]  Without their consent and without actually discussing why you're doing what you're doing.
[02:42:36.530 --> 02:42:39.530]  To illustrate this, what about this story from The Star published yesterday?
[02:42:39.530 --> 02:42:45.530]  Human rights and LGBTQ plus education should not be optional.
[02:42:45.530 --> 02:42:47.530]  Remember, it's not about health.
[02:42:47.530 --> 02:42:49.530]  It's about LGBT. It's about war.
[02:42:49.530 --> 02:42:52.530]  It's about anything they want to dictate from on high.
[02:42:52.530 --> 02:42:55.530]  They're telling you, you don't have a right to speak back.
[02:42:56.530 --> 02:43:01.530]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[02:43:01.530 --> 02:43:04.530]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[02:43:04.530 --> 02:43:06.530]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[02:43:06.530 --> 02:43:08.530]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[02:43:08.530 --> 02:43:12.530]  Hey, what's better? Knockout. What's better? Down and out.
[02:43:12.530 --> 02:43:14.530]  What's better? Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:43:14.530 --> 02:43:20.530]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:43:20.530 --> 02:43:23.530]  So one person might like this coffee.
[02:43:23.530 --> 02:43:24.530]  Another person likes that coffee.
[02:43:24.530 --> 02:43:26.530]  That's how our bodies work. They're all very diverse.
[02:43:26.530 --> 02:43:32.530]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love
[02:43:32.530 --> 02:43:37.530]  and sold for a lower price under the name Infowars MD Good Night's Sleep.

[02:43:55.530 --> 02:43:59.530]  There is a war for the future happening right now.

[02:44:04.530 --> 02:44:06.530]  And that war is something that we can win.
[02:44:06.530 --> 02:44:09.530]  But it takes dedication. It takes commitment.

[02:45:00.530 --> 02:45:02.530]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[02:45:02.530 --> 02:45:04.530]  We made it even stronger.
[02:45:04.530 --> 02:45:08.530]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:45:08.530 --> 02:45:15.530]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:45:15.530 --> 02:45:21.530]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[02:45:21.530 --> 02:45:23.530]  Should be called 10 hour energy.
[02:45:23.530 --> 02:45:27.530]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things.
[02:45:27.530 --> 02:45:31.530]  And amino acids that turbo charge everything.
[02:45:31.530 --> 02:45:33.530]  And are good for your heart, your brain, your liver.
[02:45:33.530 --> 02:45:35.530]  You name it.
[02:45:35.530 --> 02:45:38.530]  It is the super fuel.
[02:45:38.530 --> 02:45:40.530]  Brain Force Plus is great.
[02:45:40.530 --> 02:45:41.530]  Brain Force Ultra is great.
[02:45:41.530 --> 02:45:42.530]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:45:42.530 --> 02:45:43.530]  They go good with this.
[02:45:43.530 --> 02:45:45.530]  This is the King Kong.
[02:45:45.530 --> 02:45:47.530]  This is the boss.

[02:45:48.530 --> 02:45:49.530]  Back in stock.
[02:45:49.530 --> 02:45:50.530]  Discounted.
[02:45:50.530 --> 02:45:51.530]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:51.530 --> 02:45:52.530]  More power.
[02:45:52.530 --> 02:45:53.530]  More strength.
[02:45:53.530 --> 02:45:54.530]  More energy.
[02:45:58.530 --> 02:46:01.530]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpaste.
[02:46:01.530 --> 02:46:03.530]  Designed by my father, a dentist.
[02:46:03.530 --> 02:46:04.530]  At Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:04.530 --> 02:46:05.530]  They don't have fillers.
[02:46:05.530 --> 02:46:09.530]  They're filled with high-quality essential oils and more.
[02:46:09.530 --> 02:46:11.530]  We have the turmeric toothpaste.
[02:46:11.530 --> 02:46:14.530]  We have the ultimate tooth whitening with pearl calcium toothpaste.
[02:46:14.530 --> 02:46:17.530]  And we have the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste.
[02:46:17.530 --> 02:46:20.530]  Again, with a whole bunch of key essential oils that are so good.

[02:46:29.530 --> 02:46:30.530]  Ours don't.
[02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:31.530]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[02:46:31.530 --> 02:46:37.530]  It is just chock full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[02:46:37.530 --> 02:46:39.530]  So, it's now back in stock.
[02:46:39.530 --> 02:46:40.530]  It became a best seller.
[02:46:40.530 --> 02:46:44.530]  The turmeric toothpaste is available again at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:44.530 --> 02:46:46.530]  We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[02:46:46.530 --> 02:46:47.530]  We've got some of that left.
[02:46:47.530 --> 02:46:50.530]  And we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock.
[02:46:50.530 --> 02:46:51.530]  But it's running out as well.
[02:46:51.530 --> 02:46:53.530]  So, all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time.
[02:46:53.530 --> 02:46:55.530]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:21.420]  Alright, welcome back ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show, Harrison Smith
[02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:32.900]  sitting in for Alex this hour, talking about old Dr. Gremlin himself, Peter Hotez, which
[02:47:32.900 --> 02:47:35.420]  it's like, do we even need to argue it?
[02:47:35.420 --> 02:47:37.020]  Just throw up a picture of the guy.
[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:39.300]  It's like, really, this is the guy?
[02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:43.620]  And I don't know if you remember, actually, one of the clips went viral of Peter Hotez's
[02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:50.820]  appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast when Joe Rogan is just mocking him for being so horrifically
[02:47:50.820 --> 02:47:51.820]  unhealthy.
[02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:54.380]  He's just like, why should people listen to you?
[02:47:54.380 --> 02:47:55.380]  Look at you.
[02:47:55.380 --> 02:47:57.420]  And he gets all embarrassed.
[02:47:57.420 --> 02:48:03.460]  And what was Hotez's deflection there when Joe Biden was calling him out for not being
[02:48:03.460 --> 02:48:08.100]  healthy despite wanting dictatorial control over everybody's health?
[02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:14.340]  If you remember the clip from the Rogan podcast, Dr. Hotez says, well, I go out and I eat
[02:48:14.340 --> 02:48:17.380]  fast food with my autistic daughter.
[02:48:17.380 --> 02:48:20.220]  So really, I'm a great guy.
[02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:22.020]  And did I mention my daughter's autistic?
[02:48:22.020 --> 02:48:25.700]  And so really, you're attacking me if you tell me I should probably be healthy if I'm
[02:48:25.700 --> 02:48:29.380]  going to demand other people listen to my medical advice.
[02:48:29.380 --> 02:48:37.180]  Just the skeeziest, scummiest, using his daughter literally as a human shield to deflect criticism.
[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:38.340]  He's a bad person.
[02:48:38.340 --> 02:48:42.140]  He's a bad man, in my opinion.
[02:48:42.140 --> 02:48:44.260]  But again, it's not even about vaccines.
[02:48:44.260 --> 02:48:47.780]  It's not even about COVID at all.
[02:48:47.780 --> 02:48:54.540]  It's about whether or not we, as a people, have the right to discuss what our government
[02:48:54.540 --> 02:49:00.340]  is dictating for us, whether we have a right to disagree with our government or their
[02:49:00.340 --> 02:49:08.180]  overlords in the global government consisting of the U.N. and the W.H.O. and the W.E.F.
[02:49:08.180 --> 02:49:09.820]  Do we have a right to disagree with them?
[02:49:09.820 --> 02:49:13.300]  Do we have a right to oppose them?
[02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:15.460]  Or are we all subjects?
[02:49:15.460 --> 02:49:16.540]  Are we all servants?
[02:49:16.540 --> 02:49:24.660]  Are we all serfs in a neo-feudal system in which they have made themselves the lords
[02:49:24.660 --> 02:49:27.340]  in the shadows?
[02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:29.140]  So what's more dangerous?
[02:49:29.140 --> 02:49:37.340]  Somebody having skepticism, well-founded skepticism for the pharmaceutical industry who have a
[02:49:37.340 --> 02:49:45.180]  proven track record of being untrustworthy, manipulative, and downright deadly?
[02:49:45.180 --> 02:49:51.460]  Is that more dangerous or is it more dangerous to set up a governmental and societal system
[02:49:51.460 --> 02:49:59.100]  in which dissent is not tolerated in the slightest, in which even the people who are continuously
[02:49:59.100 --> 02:50:06.180]  wrong about a subject are given carte blanche to spew their madness without even the ability
[02:50:06.180 --> 02:50:07.820]  to speak back against it?
[02:50:07.820 --> 02:50:11.660]  Because this doesn't stay with medical misinformation.
[02:50:11.660 --> 02:50:15.220]  This doesn't, this isn't contained in the realm of health.
[02:50:15.220 --> 02:50:20.260]  Even if it was, it would still be worth standing up against and worth fighting back because
[02:50:20.260 --> 02:50:24.220]  it's your health, it's your body.
[02:50:24.220 --> 02:50:27.100]  You can look at things like this from The Star, published yesterday, Toronto School
[02:50:27.100 --> 02:50:31.700]  District School Board's decision to allow parents to opt their children out of drag
[02:50:31.700 --> 02:50:40.900]  story time is a dangerous setback for 2SLGBTQ plus human rights education.
[02:50:40.900 --> 02:50:46.380]  Do you have a right to keep your children away from men in dresses who want to read
[02:50:46.380 --> 02:50:47.380]  to them?
[02:50:47.380 --> 02:50:49.500]  Well, not according to these people, it's dangerous.
[02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:53.100]  See, it's dangerous to speak out against it.
[02:50:53.100 --> 02:50:58.660]  That's what they'll say because they have to couch their tyranny in safety to get it
[02:50:58.660 --> 02:51:01.500]  past the normies, I guess.
[02:51:01.500 --> 02:51:05.940]  I don't know if anybody's falling for this anymore, frankly.
[02:51:05.940 --> 02:51:11.980]  But also in the topic of health, do they not realize that they were wrong about everything?
[02:51:11.980 --> 02:51:14.740]  I mean, they have to at this point, right?
[02:51:14.740 --> 02:51:19.260]  Is it even possible to list the number of things they were wrong about?
[02:51:19.260 --> 02:51:20.380]  They're wrong about lockdowns.
[02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:22.020]  They're wrong about shutting schools down.
[02:51:22.020 --> 02:51:23.140]  They're wrong about masks.
[02:51:23.140 --> 02:51:25.640]  They were wrong about social distancing.
[02:51:25.640 --> 02:51:27.540]  They were wrong about the vaccines.
[02:51:27.540 --> 02:51:29.060]  They're wrong about the economy.
[02:51:29.060 --> 02:51:32.380]  They're wrong about the origin of the virus.
[02:51:32.380 --> 02:51:34.580]  They're wrong about gain of function research.
[02:51:34.580 --> 02:51:38.740]  We were right about all of this, but good luck finding that information when they censored
[02:51:38.740 --> 02:51:42.820]  it off the internet without reason.
[02:51:42.820 --> 02:51:45.780]  And we're still learning just how wrong they were.
[02:51:45.780 --> 02:51:49.780]  This story from Post Millennial published today, U.S. students' math scores plummet
[02:51:49.780 --> 02:51:54.500]  to lowest levels in decades.
[02:51:54.500 --> 02:52:02.680]  And actually you can find a chart mapping the results of math exams over the decades
[02:52:02.800 --> 02:52:10.200]  and you see a steady, continuous rise from the 1970s right up until 2020 when it goes
[02:52:10.200 --> 02:52:11.200]  off a cliff.
[02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:17.200]  So the gains that we made painstakingly over the course of decades were wiped out by these
[02:52:17.200 --> 02:52:24.400]  policies that they don't want you to be able to oppose, that they imposed on you without
[02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:26.960]  giving any justification for it.
[02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:32.040]  And in a fashion that has now been proven to have been both utterly pointless when it
[02:52:32.040 --> 02:52:36.840]  comes to stopping the spread of the virus and hugely damaging when it comes to the academic
[02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:40.280]  attainment of students.
[02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:43.840]  So officials with the National Assessment of Educational Progress reported that the
[02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:47.160]  average math and reading test scores for 13 year olds in the U.S. have hit the lowest
[02:52:47.160 --> 02:52:51.920]  level in decades since the 1970s.
[02:52:51.920 --> 02:52:56.040]  So that's been the outcome of their dictates.
[02:52:56.040 --> 02:52:57.240]  And so what happens?
[02:52:57.240 --> 02:52:58.440]  What happens as a result of that?
[02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:02.640]  Well, the Biden administration rewards school lockdown champion with a Homeland Security
[02:53:02.640 --> 02:53:03.640]  role.
[02:53:03.640 --> 02:53:07.520]  So the person that did this to us is being rewarded by the Biden administration.
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:11.760]  They appointed the person who pushed hardest for schools to remain closed during the pandemic
[02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:15.400]  to a new position within the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:19.480]  This is Randy Weingarten, the controversial head of the American Federation of Teachers
[02:53:19.480 --> 02:53:24.620]  Union, which will be the new member, one of the new members of the Homeland Security Academic
[02:53:24.620 --> 02:53:27.100]  Partnership Council.
[02:53:27.100 --> 02:53:31.700]  It's typical, typical, I guess.
[02:53:31.700 --> 02:53:36.700]  Again, they haven't admitted that they're wrong in the slightest, when not only were
[02:53:36.700 --> 02:53:42.980]  they wrong, the policies that they pursued not only didn't stop the virus, made everything
[02:53:42.980 --> 02:53:47.900]  significantly worse and gave us a million other issues that we now have to deal with.
[02:53:47.900 --> 02:53:53.060]  They not only didn't apologize, they are being rewarded for their mismanagement.
[02:53:53.060 --> 02:53:58.500]  And to get a sense of just how much fear Robert F. Kennedy Jr. strikes into the heart
[02:53:58.500 --> 02:54:03.900]  of globalists, Luke Rudowsky, at LukeWeAreChanged on Twitter, said he played just a small clip
[02:54:03.900 --> 02:54:09.700]  of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to comment on for his YouTube video, and his entire channel
[02:54:09.700 --> 02:54:13.860]  got demonetized for that, his entire channel.
[02:54:13.860 --> 02:54:20.940]  So his entire channel got demonetized, which, you know, this is kind of a form of violence,
[02:54:20.940 --> 02:54:21.940]  is it not?
[02:54:21.940 --> 02:54:27.580]  If you're somebody who relies on their YouTube channel for income, and just like, you know,
[02:54:27.580 --> 02:54:34.420]  Peter Hotez would have you fired for not following his ill-advised dictate, maybe they just remove
[02:54:34.420 --> 02:54:40.940]  your source of income for daring to even show a clip of somebody opposing their medical
[02:54:40.940 --> 02:54:41.940]  tyranny.
[02:54:41.940 --> 02:54:47.420]  Like, this is what's really being decided with this whole debate, debate, the debate on debates,
[02:54:47.420 --> 02:54:49.060]  the debate debacle.
[02:54:49.060 --> 02:54:53.940]  What's being decided is, do we have a right to oppose anything that the government says?
[02:54:53.940 --> 02:54:57.660]  Or no matter how wrong they are, do we just have to shut up and take it?
[02:54:57.660 --> 02:55:03.620]  And again, I don't know how, I don't know how they're continuing this charade.
[02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:05.700]  I don't know how they're expecting this to go.
[02:55:05.700 --> 02:55:13.800]  I don't know if they think that just narcissistic confidence is enough to outweigh the just overwhelming
[02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:17.420]  evidence that they were wrong about everything.
[02:55:17.420 --> 02:55:21.780]  I don't know if they're like, think that, you know, once they get CBDCs in, like, if
[02:55:21.780 --> 02:55:25.220]  there's some finish line that they're like, we just got to keep this scam going until
[02:55:25.220 --> 02:55:26.220]  we can get that.
[02:55:26.220 --> 02:55:28.180]  And once that happens, you know, we'll be good.
[02:55:28.180 --> 02:55:30.700]  We just got to keep the lid on the pot until that happens.
[02:55:30.700 --> 02:55:34.040]  Don't let the anger and the vitriol boil over.
[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:35.320]  Keep acting confident.
[02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:38.100]  Keep acting like you're in charge until we can succeed in this.
[02:55:38.100 --> 02:55:39.100]  And then we'll be good.
[02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:42.460]  Like, I don't know what that, what that deadline would be that they're trying to reach, because
[02:55:42.460 --> 02:55:48.580]  they can't do this indefinitely because it's all crumbling in front of them.
[02:55:48.580 --> 02:55:52.500]  And so Peter Hotez in response to all of this, and again, it's just pathetic.
[02:55:52.500 --> 02:55:55.600]  It's just pathetic on the face of it.
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:56:01.100]  The dude is spouting his mouth off on Twitter and Joe Rogan's like, hey, you think he's
[02:56:01.100 --> 02:56:02.100]  wrong?
[02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:03.100]  Come on the show.
[02:56:03.100 --> 02:56:04.100]  You've been on before.
[02:56:04.100 --> 02:56:05.100]  Come debate RFK.
[02:56:05.100 --> 02:56:08.260]  It'll be a good time and we'll really get to the bottom of it.
[02:56:08.260 --> 02:56:14.540]  Both of you can air your thoughts and Peter Hotez is just like, ah, this is an attack.
[02:56:14.540 --> 02:56:15.540]  I'm under attack.
[02:56:15.540 --> 02:56:16.540]  Help.
[02:56:16.540 --> 02:56:17.860]  Oh, and help came, folks.
[02:56:17.860 --> 02:56:21.540]  Oh, it's, it's coming from all directions because apparently the journalistic class
[02:56:21.540 --> 02:56:25.460]  in this country is all firmly on the side of shut up.
[02:56:25.460 --> 02:56:31.980]  They're firmly on the side of you don't talk back to your professional masters, your academic
[02:56:31.980 --> 02:56:32.980]  priests.
[02:56:32.980 --> 02:56:34.820]  So this is just a series.
[02:56:34.820 --> 02:56:36.740]  These are all from Peter Hotez's Twitter.
[02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:39.780]  His entire Twitter now is just a list of articles.
[02:56:39.780 --> 02:56:41.940]  Every single one of them demanding no debate.
[02:56:41.940 --> 02:56:45.380]  There should be no debate about this Schmidt or no debate about anything.
[02:56:45.380 --> 02:56:46.380]  These are the experts.
[02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:50.860]  After all, Dr. Peter Hotez, pediatrician worth $35 million.
[02:56:50.860 --> 02:56:51.860]  Okay.
[02:56:51.860 --> 02:56:52.860]  Yeah.
[02:56:52.860 --> 02:56:53.860]  He's totally trustworthy.
[02:56:53.860 --> 02:56:54.860]  And shut up.
[02:56:54.860 --> 02:56:55.860]  Don't question him.
[02:56:55.860 --> 02:56:56.860]  Houston Chronicle.
[02:56:56.860 --> 02:56:57.860]  Why?
[02:56:57.860 --> 02:56:58.860]  Hotez is right.
[02:56:58.860 --> 02:56:59.860]  Not to debate RFK jr.
[02:56:59.860 --> 02:57:00.860]  Robert F.
[02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:01.860]  Kennedy is dead wrong about vaccines.
[02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:02.860]  Hotez is right.
[02:57:02.860 --> 02:57:03.860]  Not to take the bait.
[02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:04.860]  That's time magazine.
[02:57:05.020 --> 02:57:09.260]  L.A. Times science isn't a cabaret act or subject to debate.
[02:57:09.260 --> 02:57:15.540]  No, you're not supposed to debate these things that government policy is being predicated
[02:57:15.540 --> 02:57:18.300]  on from New Republic dot com.
[02:57:18.300 --> 02:57:19.300]  Don't debate Robert F.
[02:57:19.300 --> 02:57:20.300]  Kennedy jr.
[02:57:20.300 --> 02:57:21.500]  He's coming out and saying it.
[02:57:21.500 --> 02:57:22.740]  That's the headline.
[02:57:22.740 --> 02:57:25.940]  Joe Rogan wants a scientist to debate a vaccine denier.
[02:57:25.940 --> 02:57:28.700]  Turning him down was the right thing to do.
[02:57:28.700 --> 02:57:29.700]  That's Vox.
[02:57:29.700 --> 02:57:35.100]  That's maybe maybe a tenth of the stories that are now on Peter Hotez.
[02:57:35.100 --> 02:57:37.960]  So the ruling class agrees.
[02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:41.580]  You don't have a right to have an opinion on government policy.
[02:57:41.580 --> 02:57:42.580]  They agree.
[02:57:42.580 --> 02:57:45.340]  You should shut up and do as you're told and not talk back.
[02:57:45.340 --> 02:57:47.740]  I disagree.
[02:57:47.740 --> 02:57:49.460]  Two amazing new tropics.
[02:57:49.460 --> 02:57:54.180]  That means brain power are back in stock and in full restore dot com.
[02:57:54.180 --> 02:57:56.620]  And they're both 50 percent off.
[02:57:56.620 --> 02:58:00.940]  We haven't offered these for 50 percent off since last Christmas.
[02:58:00.940 --> 02:58:02.420]  These are amazing products.
[02:58:02.420 --> 02:58:05.220]  And for those on the fence, I want you to try them.

[02:58:12.700 --> 02:58:18.300]  Then our brainforce plus is a good basic clean new tropic gives you four to six hours of amazing

[03:00:03.020 --> 03:00:04.540]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones.
[03:00:04.540 --> 03:00:08.060]  I'm your guest host for the fourth hour, Jay Dyer, Jay's analysis.
[03:00:09.020 --> 03:00:13.700]  And we've covered a lot of elite texts in the last two plus years that I've been hosting
[03:00:13.700 --> 03:00:19.300]  the fourth hour and really honored to be here, really glad to have this opportunity and love
[03:00:19.300 --> 03:00:20.300]  speaking to you guys.
[03:00:20.300 --> 03:00:26.540]  It's one of the best podcasts and audience experiences that I've had is being here with
[03:00:26.540 --> 03:00:27.540]  you guys.
[03:00:27.540 --> 03:00:30.900]  And I want to do something a little different today because we've covered so many of the
[03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:31.900]  elite texts.
[03:00:31.900 --> 03:00:37.860]  I want to go back to what I really started getting into when it comes to all this stuff.
[03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:40.420]  Many, many years ago, which is Hollywood.
[03:00:40.420 --> 03:00:44.740]  And we're not going to just do the old Hollywood analysis of the occultists and all this kind
[03:00:44.740 --> 03:00:45.740]  of stuff.
[03:00:45.740 --> 03:00:47.620]  That's that's well known now, I think.
[03:00:47.620 --> 03:00:51.580]  And, you know, I was blogging on this 10, 12 years ago and then wrote my first book
[03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:55.420]  in 2016 on esoteric Hollywood.
[03:00:55.420 --> 03:01:02.660]  But what about something easy where it's useful for the audience to recommend films to their
[03:01:02.660 --> 03:01:06.580]  friends and family to wake them up?
[03:01:06.580 --> 03:01:11.180]  And believe it or not, I think that the elite have the perspective that they do like to
[03:01:11.180 --> 03:01:13.740]  demonstrate what they're up to.
[03:01:13.740 --> 03:01:14.740]  They do not.
[03:01:14.740 --> 03:01:19.740]  They do like to show us ahead of time what's going on fiction.
[03:01:19.740 --> 03:01:24.220]  And that predictive programming element is really important for how the elite run things
[03:01:24.220 --> 03:01:26.780]  and how they prepare us for things.
[03:01:26.780 --> 03:01:27.780]  And they warm us.
[03:01:27.780 --> 03:01:31.540]  They kind of condition us to the things that are coming down the pipeline.
[03:01:31.540 --> 03:01:36.300]  So Hollywood and pop culture and the music industry, all of it together as part of mass
[03:01:36.300 --> 03:01:40.300]  media plays a key role in this preparation phase.
[03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:45.380]  And a lot of the analysts and psychological warfare experts and the sociologists, the
[03:01:45.380 --> 03:01:50.140]  public opinion experts, the Bernays, the Lipman's, they've talked about the role of Hollywood
[03:01:50.140 --> 03:01:51.420]  and all this.
[03:01:51.420 --> 03:02:00.020]  So what are 10 movies, the top 10 movies that openly display and expose the big conspiracy,
[03:02:00.020 --> 03:02:04.380]  the New World Order, the technocratic takeover?
[03:02:04.380 --> 03:02:05.980]  In all of its facets and components.
[03:02:06.660 --> 03:02:08.340]  So I've chosen 10 that I think are the best.
[03:02:08.340 --> 03:02:11.860]  I think I've written extensively on every one of these.
[03:02:11.860 --> 03:02:16.500]  So if you're looking for a series of movies to watch with your friends and family, not
[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:19.940]  all of these are appropriate for friends and all members of the family, I'll note, by the
[03:02:19.940 --> 03:02:20.940]  way.
[03:02:20.940 --> 03:02:24.340]  And in fact, the first one that I've chosen is not appropriate for everybody.
[03:02:24.340 --> 03:02:27.840]  In fact, I'd be, I'd say, watch out, don't show it to your kids.
[03:02:27.840 --> 03:02:34.100]  But mature adults can understand that Kubrick was whatever his motives, whatever you think
[03:02:34.100 --> 03:02:35.100]  of him as a filmmaker.
[03:02:35.220 --> 03:02:39.820]  He was definitely showing us a lot of what was really going on and how the world is really
[03:02:39.820 --> 03:02:42.220]  run through most of his films.
[03:02:42.220 --> 03:02:48.220]  In fact, four of his films make it to my top 10 list, and this is not any specific order.
[03:02:48.220 --> 03:02:57.100]  But the first movie I recommend for understanding is the 1999 controversial expose, you could
[03:02:57.100 --> 03:02:59.060]  say Eyes Wide Shut.
[03:02:59.060 --> 03:03:02.780]  Now this film was lampooned at the time, the critics didn't like it, a lot of people didn't
[03:03:02.780 --> 03:03:03.780]  understand it.
[03:03:03.860 --> 03:03:05.860]  And it is a bizarre film.
[03:03:05.860 --> 03:03:12.780]  But in Eyes Wide Shut, we have contemporaneous with the actual marital problems of Tom Cruise
[03:03:12.780 --> 03:03:18.700]  and Nicole Kidman at the time, a movie that portrays their marital problems as they embark
[03:03:18.700 --> 03:03:24.940]  upon this bizarre, surrealist journey, we could say, particularly the main character,
[03:03:24.940 --> 03:03:28.900]  Tom Cruise, that is, who believes himself to be amongst the power elite.
[03:03:28.900 --> 03:03:34.220]  He thinks, well, I'm a really successful, wealthy doctor, upper class New York, my wife's
[03:03:34.220 --> 03:03:41.420]  involved in the art socialite sphere, and he has a lot of hubris and pride, and yet
[03:03:41.420 --> 03:03:46.180]  he realizes that his marriage is falling apart, and that his wife apparently is not
[03:03:46.180 --> 03:03:47.420]  satisfied with him.
[03:03:47.420 --> 03:03:52.340]  This causes him to kind of go into a panic, and he's then tempted to engage in marital
[03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:54.780]  infidelity.
[03:03:54.780 --> 03:04:00.300]  And we see a lot of this kind of kicking off from this original Christmas party they're
[03:04:00.300 --> 03:04:01.300]  having, right?
[03:04:01.300 --> 03:04:07.780]  This leads him then on this long sort of mental journey, a psychological journey into basically
[03:04:07.780 --> 03:04:10.340]  what amounts to the real power structure.
[03:04:10.340 --> 03:04:14.700]  So he goes down this quest of seeking what he thinks is his first sexual fulfillment
[03:04:14.700 --> 03:04:23.060]  outside of his marriage, and this leads him to a large estate outside of the central hub
[03:04:23.060 --> 03:04:27.500]  of New York, and he finds out that there's actually a sex cult at this estate, and it
[03:04:27.500 --> 03:04:34.180]  seems to be very wealthy, powerful British elites running this sex cult, and he's confronted
[03:04:34.180 --> 03:04:39.260]  and called out in front of everybody when he stumbles into this rabbit hole, and this
[03:04:39.260 --> 03:04:42.940]  leads him then to realize that he's not actually at the top of the totem pole.
[03:04:42.940 --> 03:04:48.500]  There's a higher level superstructure above him, and they're into some really dark Epstein
[03:04:48.500 --> 03:04:49.940]  style stuff.
[03:04:49.940 --> 03:04:54.340]  Now, Kubrick was telling us that a long time ago, and when we come back, we'll learn more
[03:04:54.340 --> 03:04:57.619]  about this in my Top 10 Conspiracy Movies here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:57.619 --> 03:05:02.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[03:05:02.180 --> 03:05:06.340]  book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:05:06.340 --> 03:05:07.340]  That is a hellish future.
[03:05:07.340 --> 03:05:11.300]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:05:11.300 --> 03:05:15.260]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[03:05:15.260 --> 03:05:19.460]  Amazon, or Infowarshore.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of
[03:05:19.460 --> 03:05:24.220]  the book after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about 1,000 left of them
[03:05:24.220 --> 03:05:25.220]  right now.
[03:05:25.220 --> 03:05:30.740]  So, get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarshore.com,
[03:05:30.740 --> 03:05:34.820]  and there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air, so you
[03:05:34.820 --> 03:05:38.700]  won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you
[03:05:38.700 --> 03:05:40.180]  help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:05:40.180 --> 03:05:44.020]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned copies,
[03:05:44.020 --> 03:05:49.340]  but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed
[03:05:49.340 --> 03:05:53.540]  copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library, or give them
[03:05:53.540 --> 03:05:54.540]  to the local school.
[03:05:54.540 --> 03:06:02.940]  This is an Infowar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[03:06:02.940 --> 03:06:03.940]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:03.940 --> 03:06:09.440]  We're talking about the top 10 conspiracy movies to show to your friends and family, although
[03:06:09.440 --> 03:06:11.860]  this one we don't want to show to our family, necessarily.
[03:06:11.860 --> 03:06:16.420]  This one's a little overboard, but it is really important because it is giving us a window
[03:06:16.420 --> 03:06:21.700]  into what's really going on, and even it is kind of toned down, we could say, because
[03:06:21.700 --> 03:06:28.740]  Kubrick, I don't think he could really show us what was going on with the darker side
[03:06:28.740 --> 03:06:32.780]  of this when it gets into things like the adrenochrome that Jim Caviezel was talking
[03:06:32.780 --> 03:06:33.780]  about.
[03:06:33.780 --> 03:06:38.980]  I mean, that's even further than what's pictured in this film, but in this film, we have something
[03:06:38.980 --> 03:06:42.260]  like a kind of a high-level elite sex cult.
[03:06:42.260 --> 03:06:47.660]  You see the head of the cult there sitting underneath a double-headed eagle, which suggests
[03:06:47.660 --> 03:06:52.900]  some kind of high-level secret society or cult, sort of perhaps Ordo Abkaio, something
[03:06:52.900 --> 03:06:59.660]  maybe Krolian going on here, and Tom Cruise, again, inadvertently sort of stumbles into
[03:06:59.660 --> 03:07:06.900]  this thinking that he's going to get the upper hand, or he's going to attain a new status,
[03:07:06.900 --> 03:07:11.220]  or he's just really curious, he wants to find out what's going on, so he's tempted to engage
[03:07:11.220 --> 03:07:18.180]  in this ceremony outside of his marital relations here in this big secret society sex cult,
[03:07:18.180 --> 03:07:25.060]  and they say, actually, we're going to kill you because you have gone against what's allowed,
[03:07:25.060 --> 03:07:28.260]  and as you know, I'm not going to spoil the whole movie, you've probably seen it, but
[03:07:28.260 --> 03:07:32.100]  one of these supermodels from the very beginning who he saved, and by the way, there's a bunch
[03:07:32.100 --> 03:07:36.820]  of very beautiful supermodel women in this sex cult, and that's interesting because we
[03:07:36.820 --> 03:07:40.020]  know that in terms of Nygaard and a lot of these figures connected, Epstein, they actually
[03:07:40.100 --> 03:07:44.340]  did recruit and utilize a lot of supermodels, so it's very curious here that Kubrick was
[03:07:44.340 --> 03:07:50.740]  telling us this in 1999, but anyway, Tom Cruise basically realizes that he's going to be put
[03:07:50.740 --> 03:07:56.740]  to death, this cult has all the powers of an intelligence agency at their disposal,
[03:07:56.740 --> 03:08:00.020]  which again, Kubrick is probably telling us something there because Tom Cruise ends up
[03:08:00.020 --> 03:08:05.140]  being followed, he ends up getting threatened, and the supermodel who he saved in the beginning,
[03:08:05.140 --> 03:08:10.660]  she actually dies for him, believe it or not, I think, actually, Alex had her on,
[03:08:10.660 --> 03:08:15.140]  the actress that played that role, she came on maybe five or six years ago on InfoWars,
[03:08:15.140 --> 03:08:18.580]  I remember that interview, and she basically said, yeah, everything Kubrick's talking about
[03:08:18.580 --> 03:08:25.300]  in this film is real, of course, Vivian Kubrick has come on Alex's show as well several times,
[03:08:25.300 --> 03:08:30.740]  so I recommend Eyes Wide Shut as an overall analysis of, hey, look, Hollywood was telling
[03:08:30.740 --> 03:08:37.060]  us in movies all of this Epstein Nygaard stuff back in 1999, and believe it or not,
[03:08:37.060 --> 03:08:41.540]  there's actually a lot of films prior to Eyes Wide Shut that are very similar to Eyes Wide Shut,
[03:08:42.500 --> 03:08:46.820]  old black and white movies like Eye of the Devil with Donald Pleasence, right,
[03:08:46.820 --> 03:08:51.940]  that was actually telling us something very similar. Next, let's move on to another Kubrick
[03:08:51.940 --> 03:08:58.580]  film that I think is extremely revelatory that a lot of people didn't initially think was that
[03:08:58.580 --> 03:09:04.260]  revelatory, but now it's been so dissected and so analyzed on YouTube, and I have a whole mini
[03:09:04.260 --> 03:09:08.420]  documentary that's gotten quite a few views analyzing it on YouTube as well as many other
[03:09:08.980 --> 03:09:15.619]  YouTubers, and that's Stephen King's novel The Shining made into a film in 1980 by Stanley
[03:09:15.619 --> 03:09:22.020]  Kubrick, and this movie has been dissected into oblivion just like 2001 has, but what's fascinating
[03:09:22.020 --> 03:09:27.140]  about it is that it doesn't, in my view, this is my interpretation, you can disagree, but
[03:09:27.220 --> 03:09:32.900]  I don't ultimately think that it's about a haunted hotel. I think that it is in part about
[03:09:32.900 --> 03:09:37.940]  that, but it's also about something much deeper, which is about American society and Americanism
[03:09:37.940 --> 03:09:43.619]  as a whole, and the reason that's relevant is that we find out this hotel is actually
[03:09:43.619 --> 03:09:51.860]  haunted because it was at one point the location where the jet set used to hang out. All the best
[03:09:51.860 --> 03:10:01.220]  people, we're told by the hotel manager, royalty, the elites, those who were successful, so to speak,
[03:10:01.220 --> 03:10:09.700]  in a worldly sense in life, and the main character, of course, Jack Torrance is tempted, he's constantly
[03:10:09.700 --> 03:10:15.940]  sort of tempted throughout the film to, in his mind, to think if I'm going to get amongst the elite
[03:10:15.940 --> 03:10:20.660]  to become a great writer, which is his desire, right, I'm going to have to dispense with the
[03:10:20.660 --> 03:10:27.780]  things that hold me back, right, and eventually he realizes that that's Danny and Wendy, my wife,
[03:10:27.780 --> 03:10:32.500]  Wendy, right, he says I got to get rid of Wendy. Wendy's holding me back, and there's a lot of
[03:10:32.500 --> 03:10:36.980]  interesting elements that people have picked apart, including myself, such as Wendy's interest in
[03:10:36.980 --> 03:10:41.940]  witchcraft. That's not really apparently clear right away, but if you go back and you watch the
[03:10:41.940 --> 03:10:47.860]  film, you'll notice that Shelley Duvall is actually reading in the very early sequences a lot of books
[03:10:47.860 --> 03:10:53.619]  on witchcraft. She's shown holding and studying witchcraft, so she's interested in the
[03:10:53.619 --> 03:10:59.619]  esoteric and the occult. She has stacks of witchcraft books, which I think suggests perhaps
[03:10:59.619 --> 03:11:05.700]  Jack also was reading his books, again, because he's also a literary figure who eventually becomes
[03:11:05.700 --> 03:11:11.700]  demonically possessed, and as we know, this becomes more and more apparent as the film progresses, and
[03:11:11.700 --> 03:11:17.619]  I think there is an argument to be made that Jack might have actually even abused Danny. Now,
[03:11:18.500 --> 03:11:23.860]  beyond physical abuse, and I say that because there's a recurring theme in a lot of Kubrick
[03:11:23.860 --> 03:11:29.780]  films about child trafficking, underage abuse, this kind of stuff. It actually comes up quite a
[03:11:29.780 --> 03:11:36.260]  bit, right? I mean, Kubrick did Lolita. It comes up in Barry Lyndon. It comes up in Eyes Wide Shut,
[03:11:36.260 --> 03:11:40.820]  so the Lili Sobieski character that I didn't mention in Eyes Wide Shut, she's actually
[03:11:41.780 --> 03:11:47.700]  apparently being human. She's human trafficked, you could say, because she's at the costume store
[03:11:48.900 --> 03:11:55.540]  when Bill Harford is trying to get his costume for the sex cult event, and she's obviously an
[03:11:55.540 --> 03:12:00.420]  underage person who I think we're supposed to... She whispers to Bill Harford, for example, that
[03:12:00.420 --> 03:12:06.020]  you need an ermine cloak if you're going to be hanging out with royalty, but Jack, of course,
[03:12:06.020 --> 03:12:13.220]  as we said, is eventually demonically possessed, and he ends up trapped in a victim of this hotel,
[03:12:13.220 --> 03:12:18.980]  but there's a lot of sub-themes and motifs throughout the movie that make it clear that
[03:12:18.980 --> 03:12:28.340]  it's not just a critique of a crazy writer trying to achieve elite status. It's about the dream or
[03:12:28.340 --> 03:12:35.700]  the promise of the American idea of you can make it amongst the elite if you're willing to sacrifice
[03:12:35.700 --> 03:12:41.300]  at all, and the criticism here is that that includes, in Jack's mind, he goes crazy trying
[03:12:41.300 --> 03:12:47.460]  to make it into the elite to the point where he's ready to sacrifice his wife and kids. He's so
[03:12:47.460 --> 03:12:51.860]  insane, right? That's really, I think, what the film is about. By the way, in the movie, they're
[03:12:51.860 --> 03:12:57.220]  actually watching a movie called Summer of 42, which is about a pedophilic relationship, so
[03:12:57.940 --> 03:13:01.619]  Shelley Duvall and Danny are actually watching that movie at one point, which is really bizarre.
[03:13:01.619 --> 03:13:07.220]  It's not really appropriate for a child, right? The movie ends, of course, with Jack doing the
[03:13:07.220 --> 03:13:15.220]  Baphomet pose, as above, so below, where he's immortalized amongst the individuals at the hotel,
[03:13:15.220 --> 03:13:23.780]  so we see him in a 1921 photograph telling us that, essentially, not only was he possessed,
[03:13:23.780 --> 03:13:32.180]  he's basically condemned to be one of these haunting phantasms of this hotel, but I think
[03:13:32.180 --> 03:13:39.380]  that it's also an allegory for America and how America, in a sense, if it has abandoned its
[03:13:39.380 --> 03:13:46.260]  original principles, basic moral principles, values, America can become a haunted, possessed,
[03:13:46.260 --> 03:13:51.940]  overlook hotel, you see, because you know that it isn't, I think, built on an Indian burial ground,
[03:13:51.940 --> 03:13:58.100]  all this kind of stuff, right? So I think that's what that's actually about. Next, I would say the
[03:14:00.900 --> 03:14:05.700]  movie 2001, even though it's been dissected a million times, this would be my number three
[03:14:06.900 --> 03:14:14.660]  film, and it's relevant because, really, the whole Arthur C. Clarke storyline of 2001, 2010,
[03:14:14.660 --> 03:14:23.460]  and 3001, that whole trilogy is about the evolutionary ascent of man to become a transhumanist
[03:14:23.460 --> 03:14:29.060]  god, literally. It's about the apotheosis of man, and we know that because, of course, Arthur C.
[03:14:29.060 --> 03:14:36.900]  Clarke was hanging out with a lot of the esoteric occult circles. Arthur C. Clarke was into a kind
[03:14:36.900 --> 03:14:42.100]  of luciferianism, you could say, and he did believe that technology would be the means by which
[03:14:42.100 --> 03:14:47.940]  humanity would become gods, and so if you think about 2001, I'm sure everybody's seen it, if you
[03:14:47.940 --> 03:14:54.660]  go back and watch it, you'll notice that the evolutionary process where the apes discover
[03:14:54.660 --> 03:14:59.380]  technology and dominance through technology when one ape hits the other guy on the head with a bone,
[03:14:59.380 --> 03:15:04.580]  this then leads to the next phase of human development, which we fast forward to being in
[03:15:04.580 --> 03:15:10.580]  space and the conquering of space and Bowman being sent out to investigate these strange signals that
[03:15:10.580 --> 03:15:17.619]  are coming from various space locations, and then we get the next phase of evolution, which is man
[03:15:17.619 --> 03:15:23.220]  versus AI, Bowman versus Howl, and who will win? Well, it turns out, of course, Bowman wins that
[03:15:24.180 --> 03:15:31.460]  battle, and so he becomes a god figure. He steps outside of, when he goes through the portal or
[03:15:31.460 --> 03:15:37.860]  whatever, he steps out of the time and space universe into the next dimension and is reborn
[03:15:37.860 --> 03:15:44.020]  as Starchild, and in the story, Starchild nukes Earth because it's time to start over, right?
[03:15:44.020 --> 03:15:51.220]  It's a depopulation narrative, right, in the novel, in Clark's version. Kubrick changes that, but
[03:15:51.220 --> 03:15:56.100]  it is a completely Luciferian expose, and when we come back, we'll get into that a little bit more.
[03:16:01.940 --> 03:16:06.740]  I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is, but if you took it
[03:16:06.740 --> 03:16:13.060]  with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than it, and that's an example of
[03:16:13.060 --> 03:16:19.540]  what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:16:19.540 --> 03:16:23.940]  Krill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry. You want something like
[03:16:23.940 --> 03:16:28.500]  this, you don't get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good, in my view. I'm not
[03:16:28.500 --> 03:16:32.500]  making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something. I eat five capulets of krill oil
[03:16:32.500 --> 03:16:40.660]  before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night, so your brain is made basically out of what
[03:16:40.660 --> 03:16:47.860]  fish oil is, so we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever
[03:16:47.860 --> 03:16:57.060]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it. You wanted to plug
[03:16:57.060 --> 03:17:02.660]  brain force. Do you like brain force? Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley. How do I write all the
[03:17:02.660 --> 03:17:07.380]  books that I do? Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[03:17:07.380 --> 03:17:14.100]  and now two books with Alex Jones? That's because I use brain force every day. What I always need
[03:17:14.100 --> 03:17:20.180]  is I always need some sort of boost in the morning, and so I try to exercise, eat well,
[03:17:20.180 --> 03:17:25.860]  take good vitamins, but the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain
[03:17:25.940 --> 03:17:31.619]  force. I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the
[03:17:31.619 --> 03:17:37.140]  next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff, so it really is true that brain force is
[03:17:37.140 --> 03:17:41.540]  something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing. All right, we love you. We'll be right
[03:17:41.540 --> 03:17:47.140]  back. Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at infowarstore.com. We'll be right
[03:17:47.140 --> 03:18:00.500]  back with hour number two. Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the
[03:18:00.500 --> 03:18:06.740]  foundation of our entire food supply. Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of
[03:18:06.740 --> 03:18:12.580]  this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population,
[03:18:12.580 --> 03:18:18.740]  and there are two things we need to do about it. We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:18:18.740 --> 03:18:24.260]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:18:24.260 --> 03:18:30.980]  keep the soil rich with iodine, and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine
[03:18:30.980 --> 03:18:37.619]  every day. Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface,
[03:18:37.619 --> 03:18:45.700]  our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best. Pure nascent iodine,
[03:18:45.700 --> 03:18:52.820]  stabilized in an activated triiodine form. For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism,

[03:18:59.700 --> 03:19:05.940]  and it's TurboForce Plus. We made it even stronger. The strongest long-term energy
[03:19:05.940 --> 03:19:14.100]  you're going to find anywhere. TurboForce is back in stock at infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:14.100 --> 03:19:20.980]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours. It should be called
[03:19:20.980 --> 03:19:26.420]  10-hour energy. It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and
[03:19:26.420 --> 03:19:32.500]  amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver,
[03:19:32.500 --> 03:19:39.780]  you name it. It is the super fuel. RainForce Plus is great. RainForce Alt is great. They're
[03:19:39.780 --> 03:19:46.020]  two different nootropics. They go good with this, but this is the King Kong. This is the boss.
[03:19:46.020 --> 03:19:52.980]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, infowarstore.com. More power, more strength, more energy.
[03:19:52.980 --> 03:20:01.380]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.600 --> 03:20:14.080]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.080 --> 03:20:19.440]  We are breaking down my top ten conspiracy movies that reveal and explain and expose
[03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:26.400]  the New World Order in varying ways and capacities, and we were talking about 2001 A Space Odyssey
[03:20:26.400 --> 03:20:33.560]  from 1968 from Kubrick again, and the thing about Space Odyssey is that although I don't
[03:20:33.560 --> 03:20:38.720]  agree with the overall philosophy that's being presented in the movie, it's relevant
[03:20:38.720 --> 03:20:43.240]  because it's giving us an insight into the attitude and perspective of the elite, and
[03:20:43.240 --> 03:20:47.440]  I do think that it has a lot of these sort of esoteric and alchemical sub-themes going
[03:20:47.440 --> 03:20:48.440]  on.
[03:20:48.440 --> 03:20:53.920]  It's about not just evolution, but man's ascent into apotheosis and the elite perspective
[03:20:53.920 --> 03:20:59.440]  of how that occurs via technology, because as the series progresses on beyond the first
[03:20:59.440 --> 03:21:04.240]  movie, I would actually recommend if you watch the second movie with Roy Scheider,
[03:21:04.240 --> 03:21:10.920]  2010, it's about the Cold War ending so that we get a world government, believe it or not.
[03:21:10.920 --> 03:21:17.600]  So out of the Cold War dialectics comes a synthesis of the New World Order, and the New World
[03:21:17.600 --> 03:21:24.360]  Order in that movie is presented as sending forth humans into the cosmos to seed the cosmos
[03:21:24.360 --> 03:21:27.200]  so that we can become gods of the universe, basically.
[03:21:27.200 --> 03:21:32.760]  And in 3000, in the third installment of Arthur C. Clarke, it actually has Hal and
[03:21:32.760 --> 03:21:39.200]  Bowman coming together in a kind of transhumanist entity known as Halman, and man becomes god.
[03:21:39.200 --> 03:21:44.000]  So that's what this series is ultimately about, but it's all predicated not just on Darwinism,
[03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:51.840]  but on a mystical Darwinian apotheosis where conflict, thesis, antithesis, synthesis leads
[03:21:51.840 --> 03:21:55.760]  to the apotheosis of transhumanism.
[03:21:55.760 --> 03:22:00.600]  That's actually what the whole movie and the series is about if you pay attention to it,
[03:22:00.600 --> 03:22:04.720]  and that also leads into another quasi-transhumanist film.
[03:22:04.720 --> 03:22:10.200]  My fourth choice when it comes to the top ten movies that display and illustrate the
[03:22:10.200 --> 03:22:14.320]  New World Order and the revelation of the method, predictive programming and all, is
[03:22:14.320 --> 03:22:16.840]  the Matrix Trilogy, which begins in 1999.
[03:22:16.840 --> 03:22:22.400]  I'm sure everybody's seen the Matrix Trilogy, but did you pay attention to a lot of the Gnostic,
[03:22:22.400 --> 03:22:29.640]  Neo-Gnostic sub-themes, to the Platonism, to the esoteric idea that Neo, this individual
[03:22:29.640 --> 03:22:35.440]  who is, we later find out, the ninth or tenth version of Neo, I don't remember exactly,
[03:22:35.440 --> 03:22:37.240]  but it's something like that, right?
[03:22:37.240 --> 03:22:43.760]  There have been several other Neos that were the one, but the tenth instantiation or ninth,
[03:22:43.760 --> 03:22:48.320]  whatever it is, of Neo is the final one because he's actually going to break the pattern,
[03:22:48.320 --> 03:22:49.760]  break the matrix.
[03:22:50.200 --> 03:22:56.400]  Initially, it's about whether we're determined, predestined to be part of this scheme, this
[03:22:56.400 --> 03:23:02.960]  sort of computer program that doesn't allow for free will.
[03:23:02.960 --> 03:23:07.000]  You have this architect character, this great architect, which is, again, kind of a Masonic
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:13.300]  idea that God is this architect, this grand architect of the universe, and that Neo breaks
[03:23:13.300 --> 03:23:18.480]  out of this because he's supposedly determined to only have a couple options in this choice
[03:23:18.480 --> 03:23:25.440]  at the end between coming after the great architect or saving Trinity, right?
[03:23:25.440 --> 03:23:31.160]  Initially, it's about free will and choice, and then as the series expands on, it becomes
[03:23:31.160 --> 03:23:38.440]  about synthetic virtual realities, it becomes about a future dystopia where we've been imprisoned
[03:23:38.440 --> 03:23:44.880]  by this AI, and there's a lesser known series called the Animatrix where it turns out that
[03:23:44.880 --> 03:23:49.080]  the AI was actually able to take over through this weird cryptocurrency that it invented.
[03:23:49.080 --> 03:23:50.080]  I'm not saying that's Bitcoin.
[03:23:50.080 --> 03:23:55.920]  I'm a supporter of Bitcoin, but I just thought it was funny that it engages in atmospheric
[03:23:55.920 --> 03:24:02.200]  geoengineering, spraying the AI in the Animatrix series, and so that's part of the storyline
[03:24:02.200 --> 03:24:07.280]  that's not in the mainline movies, but there's a lot of predictive programming in the Matrix
[03:24:07.280 --> 03:24:11.120]  series, so it's definitely worth watching.
[03:24:11.120 --> 03:24:19.320]  But the basic philosophy here is Gnosticism and Platonism, and so we're just hearkening
[03:24:19.320 --> 03:24:24.240]  back to these ancient systems of philosophy that I think hit really well for audiences
[03:24:24.240 --> 03:24:28.120]  in the 90s because that's right when the internet was starting to get really popular,
[03:24:28.120 --> 03:24:32.800]  and then there was a lot of hacker movies in the 1990s, and so even though there is a way
[03:24:32.800 --> 03:24:40.200]  you could read the Matrix as a kind of a narrative where we're awakened, where we wake up to
[03:24:40.200 --> 03:24:46.560]  reality, ultimately it's also kind of a Gnostic presentation which doesn't really wake us up.
[03:24:46.560 --> 03:24:52.200]  So it's both revealing and concealing, I would say, when it comes to the Matrix trilogy because
[03:24:52.200 --> 03:24:58.840]  you can use it as an analogy for where we are in the world, that it seems like we exist
[03:24:58.880 --> 03:25:04.720]  in a Matrix system where we can't get ahead, it's gamed against us as individuals, as normal
[03:25:04.720 --> 03:25:09.600]  people, you can't rise up, it's a super mega corporate control structure, that's what
[03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:13.960]  we see here in the first one, but we find out that actually it's much deeper than it
[03:25:13.960 --> 03:25:17.360]  being some kind of socio-political economic control structure.
[03:25:17.360 --> 03:25:24.920]  The oppression in the Matrix story is actually all of reality being an illusion, being a prison.
[03:25:24.920 --> 03:25:29.760]  The idea that all reality is a prison, again, is an ancient Platonic slash Gnostic view,
[03:25:29.760 --> 03:25:34.360]  and I know that Gnosticism and Platonism are not identical, but that's where I would disagree,
[03:25:34.360 --> 03:25:38.280]  I don't think that all reality is inherently evil or some kind of a prison, but we are
[03:25:38.280 --> 03:25:43.240]  existing in a fallen reality, and we are, you could say, underneath the dominance of
[03:25:43.240 --> 03:25:48.000]  fallen angelic entities, and so in that sense it's partly true.
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:52.320]  So you could read Agent Smith as something like a Satan figure, and you could read Neo
[03:25:52.320 --> 03:25:57.920]  as a kind of a Christ-like figure, again, with limitations here, and so the red pill
[03:25:57.920 --> 03:26:03.520]  and the blue pill then symbolize the blue pill staying an NPC, staying an army, staying
[03:26:03.520 --> 03:26:08.340]  believing Biden and this kind of stuff, right, whereas the red pill is waking up to what's
[03:26:08.340 --> 03:26:14.360]  really going on, that reality is controlled, that reality is, we're lied to about reality
[03:26:14.360 --> 03:26:19.920]  on a massive scale, I'm not saying everything's a lie, but a lot of what we are told in mainline
[03:26:19.920 --> 03:26:24.400]  education and in mainline churches and all this kind of stuff is not true, it's a lie,
[03:26:24.400 --> 03:26:30.840]  it's part of the matrix system, and so really the only way out of this is a type of religious
[03:26:30.840 --> 03:26:39.080]  conversion, and so I think we could read that element of the matrix properly and correctly.
[03:26:39.080 --> 03:26:45.400]  The next movie I would say in my list coming to the top ten here is, or I guess this would
[03:26:45.400 --> 03:26:51.640]  be one, two, three, four, five, this fifth one would be Network, and I just covered Network,
[03:26:51.640 --> 03:26:54.960]  we just talked about it fairly recently on one of the fourth hours with you guys, and
[03:26:54.960 --> 03:27:03.600]  this is the satirical film from 1976, which you think is about, I was glad to go back
[03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:07.840]  and watch it, I'd never seen the whole thing until fairly recently in terms of paying a
[03:27:07.840 --> 03:27:11.120]  lot of attention, I think I saw it many years ago and I fell asleep, not because it's bad,
[03:27:11.120 --> 03:27:17.160]  I was just watching it late at night, so I watched it intently and paid attention,
[03:27:17.160 --> 03:27:22.680]  and I was amazed at the depth of this movie, this film has so much in it, and it is quasi-satirical
[03:27:22.680 --> 03:27:29.560]  because the Carnival Barker media character, Howard Beale, who starts to, because this
[03:27:29.560 --> 03:27:33.800]  network is dying, he wants ratings and he starts to just sort of rant, so we get kind
[03:27:33.800 --> 03:27:41.000]  of the first notions of modern media, of it being about cult of personality and it being
[03:27:41.080 --> 03:27:46.080]  about infotainment, which I don't necessarily have a problem with that, but it's clearly
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:51.720]  showing that the future of media will be about transitioning out of the boring old
[03:27:51.720 --> 03:27:55.480]  figures that, you know, the Walter Cronkites that sit there and tell you that you should
[03:27:55.480 --> 03:27:59.720]  believe in the New World Order, and it will be transitioning into these sort of loud,
[03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:08.280]  crazy figures, right, and it even has reality TV in this movie, they actually start a reality
[03:28:08.280 --> 03:28:15.280]  TV show about a communist cell in the movie, which is pretty wild, right, this is the
[03:28:15.280 --> 03:28:21.320]  1970s, nobody had done reality, this is years before MTV and road rules and, you know, all
[03:28:21.320 --> 03:28:22.600]  that kind of stuff.
[03:28:22.600 --> 03:28:27.960]  So here we have this prediction of reality TV and this really famous, there's actually
[03:28:27.960 --> 03:28:32.680]  a few famous speeches in the movie, and you see the sequence here that they're showing,
[03:28:32.680 --> 03:28:38.960]  that's of course the most famous one, that we talked about a couple of fourth hours back,
[03:28:38.960 --> 03:28:45.080]  and it's this sort of socio-economic Darwinian corporate control, the metaphysics of corporatism
[03:28:45.080 --> 03:28:49.240]  basically is the purpose of this speech, we'll talk about that when we come back on the
[03:28:49.240 --> 03:28:53.560]  fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host Jay Dyer, don't go anywhere and
[03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:56.440]  head over to the Infowars store when this show ends.

[03:29:57.120 --> 03:30:03.200]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had, I don't think anybody can deny it,
[03:30:03.200 --> 03:30:08.480]  and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us, but when we talk about the
[03:30:08.480 --> 03:30:13.440]  crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really
[03:30:13.440 --> 03:30:18.640]  have been the MVPs in this fight, and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[03:30:18.640 --> 03:30:23.760]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really
[03:30:23.760 --> 03:30:27.920]  just incredible, so for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past
[03:30:27.920 --> 03:30:33.040]  support, and I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air
[03:30:33.040 --> 03:30:34.720]  if you do not support us.
[03:30:34.720 --> 03:30:37.840]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it,
[03:30:37.840 --> 03:30:42.880]  but most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com, and you never buy great
[03:30:42.880 --> 03:30:46.640]  products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air.
[03:30:46.640 --> 03:30:50.960]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:50.960 --> 03:30:55.200]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding problems
[03:30:55.200 --> 03:30:55.920]  will be over.
[03:30:55.920 --> 03:30:57.200]  Please take action now.
[03:30:57.200 --> 03:31:03.120]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[03:31:03.120 --> 03:31:03.600]  supply.
[03:31:04.240 --> 03:31:09.200]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:31:09.200 --> 03:31:14.640]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population, and there are two things we
[03:31:14.640 --> 03:31:16.000]  need to do about it.
[03:31:16.000 --> 03:31:19.360]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:31:19.360 --> 03:31:24.800]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:31:24.800 --> 03:31:30.640]  keep the soil rich with iodine, and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount
[03:31:30.640 --> 03:31:37.040]  of iodine every day, derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the
[03:31:37.040 --> 03:31:38.160]  earth's surface.
[03:31:38.160 --> 03:31:44.160]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:31:44.240 --> 03:31:50.240]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[03:31:50.240 --> 03:31:56.560]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:58.720 --> 03:32:05.120]  Two of our best selling nootropics or brain boosters are now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:05.120 --> 03:32:09.280]  For a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together or 40% off when you get
[03:32:09.280 --> 03:32:10.080]  them individually.
[03:32:10.080 --> 03:32:12.720]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra.
[03:32:12.800 --> 03:32:14.400]  Two separate formulas.
[03:32:14.400 --> 03:32:17.280]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[03:32:17.280 --> 03:32:22.960]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again with no hangover or letdown,
[03:32:22.960 --> 03:32:27.680]  and the other is a very special proprietary formula, that's Brain Force Ultra, that hits
[03:32:27.680 --> 03:32:29.040]  really, really quick, and I love it.
[03:32:29.040 --> 03:32:30.480]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[03:32:30.480 --> 03:32:33.360]  So if I've got to work at night but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and
[03:32:33.360 --> 03:32:36.800]  stay nine o'clock at night, got to stay up until midnight working, doing a radio interview
[03:32:36.800 --> 03:32:41.920]  or something, and boom, writing an article or writing a book, and then I get two, three
[03:32:41.920 --> 03:32:43.840]  hours of energy and then go right to bed after it.
[03:32:43.840 --> 03:32:49.280]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50% off by themselves or 40% off individually.
[03:32:49.280 --> 03:32:50.560]  A lot of people love these products.
[03:32:50.560 --> 03:32:53.520]  They've got five star reviews, but if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[03:32:53.520 --> 03:32:56.240]  50% off, Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:57.920 --> 03:33:05.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.700 --> 03:33:15.380]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.380 --> 03:33:19.620]  My guest today is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, and as I was saying, be sure after the show
[03:33:19.620 --> 03:33:24.420]  to head on over to the Infowars store and make use of all those excellent products that
[03:33:24.420 --> 03:33:25.420]  are over there.
[03:33:25.420 --> 03:33:26.420]  I have quite a few in my bathroom.
[03:33:26.420 --> 03:33:30.960]  In fact, the oral calcium toothpaste, I'm a big fan of that.
[03:33:30.960 --> 03:33:39.440]  We have some of the other supplements and nutritional aids that Alex offers, and we're
[03:33:39.440 --> 03:33:40.440]  big fans of those.
[03:33:40.440 --> 03:33:44.780]  So I definitely recommend getting those, and also the t-shirts and the books and all the
[03:33:44.780 --> 03:33:50.120]  other offers that are over there to support the Infowar, keep this show going.
[03:33:50.120 --> 03:33:56.720]  And we were talking about Network, the 1976 film, which is a great satire of mass media
[03:33:56.720 --> 03:34:01.720]  and in many ways very predictive because it shows the control of mass media in all
[03:34:01.720 --> 03:34:03.720]  forms on the minds of the public.
[03:34:03.720 --> 03:34:12.160]  Now, the public can really be swayed in a mob mentality, so to speak, and the Howard
[03:34:12.160 --> 03:34:17.120]  Beale character ultimately tries to step up against the system, against the matrix, you
[03:34:17.120 --> 03:34:21.240]  could say, and he's immediately shot down by this figure who we find out is actually
[03:34:21.240 --> 03:34:28.920]  sort of a Blackrock vanguard sort of character who has this giant hedge fund conglomerate
[03:34:28.920 --> 03:34:34.720]  that is buying the Network, and the Network says to Howard Beale, we run you and control
[03:34:34.720 --> 03:34:40.920]  you, you don't have this freedom, you're the creation of us, and we can destroy you at
[03:34:40.920 --> 03:34:41.920]  any moment.
[03:34:41.920 --> 03:34:47.760]  And so Howard Beale, who kind of sees himself as this quasi-prophet, quasi-religious figure,
[03:34:47.840 --> 03:34:52.680]  is realizing, oh no, I'm actually a creation of this entity, and that weird sequence there
[03:34:52.680 --> 03:35:01.400]  where he's being lectured at by the big Blackrock CEO there, he finds out that this figure
[03:35:01.400 --> 03:35:07.160]  is sort of a God figure to him, and it's a very religious sort of sequence, and Beale
[03:35:07.160 --> 03:35:12.520]  actually says, I've seen the face of God speaking of this CEO corporate figure.
[03:35:12.520 --> 03:35:19.280]  And so it's not about truth, it's not even about ratings, it's about what the megacorp
[03:35:19.280 --> 03:35:23.880]  wants, and they control and destroy Howard Beale at will.
[03:35:23.880 --> 03:35:29.720]  So there's a lot of really profound truth, especially in that corporate metaphysics sequence,
[03:35:29.720 --> 03:35:34.320]  as it's sometimes called, the metaphysics of corporatism or whatever.
[03:35:34.320 --> 03:35:38.600]  It's a great film, and it's full of a lot of really profound truths and predictive elements,
[03:35:38.600 --> 03:35:43.960]  as I said, the reality show in there, it's just wild, all the stuff that's in that movie.
[03:35:43.960 --> 03:35:48.200]  I highly recommend it if you've never seen it, but it's great for showing the absurdity
[03:35:48.200 --> 03:35:53.840]  and the reality of corporate media control.
[03:35:53.840 --> 03:35:57.560]  Next movie I would say that's great in the top ten list for waking up your friends and
[03:35:57.560 --> 03:36:03.800]  family, which pretty much everybody can watch, is the 1988 classic from John Carpenter, They
[03:36:03.800 --> 03:36:05.400]  Live.
[03:36:05.400 --> 03:36:10.320]  They Live is one of the best conspiracy movies that's pretty accurate.
[03:36:10.320 --> 03:36:15.200]  Now, depending on how literal you want to read it, you could read They Live as a story
[03:36:15.200 --> 03:36:19.200]  about aliens, or you could read They Live as a story about, again, mass media control
[03:36:19.200 --> 03:36:20.680]  in the new world order.
[03:36:20.680 --> 03:36:21.680]  It's not perfect.
[03:36:21.680 --> 03:36:25.160]  There's a couple areas of the film that I think are kind of silly that I would disagree
[03:36:25.160 --> 03:36:30.360]  with, but They Live is a story, it's kind of a cartoonish satirical story, you could
[03:36:30.360 --> 03:36:34.640]  say, of sort of a drifter, Rowdy Roddy Piper, John Nauta.
[03:36:34.640 --> 03:36:40.760]  He sort of wanders into L.A. looking for work, and he ends up staying at a homeless encampment
[03:36:40.760 --> 03:36:46.720]  and finding a construction job, and while he's staying at this homeless encampment looking
[03:36:46.720 --> 03:36:52.400]  for work, he hears a signal that's broadcast from a local church that comes through on
[03:36:52.400 --> 03:36:57.440]  a TV show, and they hijack the signal and they say, everything that you've been being
[03:36:57.440 --> 03:37:02.400]  told is a lie, and there's a corporate system that's controlling you, and we're being controlled
[03:37:02.400 --> 03:37:07.360]  by our desires and by consumerism and all this stuff, and the signal goes away because
[03:37:07.360 --> 03:37:10.040]  they lose the signal.
[03:37:10.040 --> 03:37:15.560]  So this begins him questioning, and he figures out that it's coming from this church nearby,
[03:37:15.560 --> 03:37:20.480]  and this church, it turns out, is manufacturing these glasses that allow you to, when you put
[03:37:20.480 --> 03:37:22.840]  them on, see what's really going on.
[03:37:22.840 --> 03:37:28.200]  You can see through the signal that's being broadcast that controls your perception of
[03:37:28.200 --> 03:37:35.280]  reality, and so this leads to a kind of a burgeoning rebellion and revolution, and there's
[03:37:35.280 --> 03:37:41.760]  the signal as they're watching it that's breaking through the TV screen, through the advertisements
[03:37:41.760 --> 03:37:48.520]  and the consumerism, and this leads to this sort of undercurrent of revolution against
[03:37:48.520 --> 03:37:53.560]  the system, and as soon as this starts to build, the system finds out about it, and
[03:37:53.560 --> 03:37:59.400]  they send basically a giant police state killdozer to come through and just destroy the entire
[03:37:59.400 --> 03:38:01.200]  homeless encampment, right?
[03:38:01.200 --> 03:38:08.360]  This sends Roddy Roddy Piper, John Nauta on the run, and they reconfigure, and they try
[03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:12.320]  to again build this revolution against the system, and it turns out it's not what they
[03:38:12.320 --> 03:38:13.320]  thought it was.
[03:38:13.320 --> 03:38:15.320]  It's not just a corporate control.
[03:38:15.360 --> 03:38:21.720]  It turns out there's these sort of alien beings that appear as humans, but they're this sort
[03:38:21.720 --> 03:38:28.760]  of off-world demonic parasite that is leeching on everyone and controlling everyone through
[03:38:28.760 --> 03:38:32.720]  this signal that they're admitting from a control tower, from a satellite on the top
[03:38:32.720 --> 03:38:39.600]  of a media building, so again, a lot of allegories, a lot of parallels there that the corporate
[03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:47.080]  control, the consumerist society, it's all about conform, consume, obey, watch, be quiet,
[03:38:47.080 --> 03:38:53.600]  stay asleep, right, exactly, keeping you in the matrix, so to speak, and again, it gets
[03:38:53.600 --> 03:38:54.600]  really wild.
[03:38:54.600 --> 03:39:00.040]  It turns into a battle with the alien entities and these off-world things, and the idea is,
[03:39:00.040 --> 03:39:03.920]  well, if I can control, if I can destroy the signal that they're admitting, then I can
[03:39:03.920 --> 03:39:07.640]  get rid of them, so it's a great allegory.
[03:39:07.680 --> 03:39:13.280]  It's a great film overall, highly recommend watching They Live if you've never seen it.
[03:39:13.280 --> 03:39:18.760]  The next movie I would recommend in my list of the top 10 conspiracy movies that show
[03:39:18.760 --> 03:39:24.840]  us what's really going on in the world would be Clockwork Orange, once again, Kubrick makes
[03:39:24.840 --> 03:39:30.880]  the list again, and this one is really important because this is based on Anthony Burgess's
[03:39:30.880 --> 03:39:36.280]  novel, which he also has another dystopian novel, by the way, called The Wanting Seed,
[03:39:36.280 --> 03:39:41.360]  and that might be relevant if you're not familiar with that dystopian story for what's
[03:39:41.360 --> 03:39:46.440]  going on in the world, I won't say what it's all about, but it's about a lot of what's
[03:39:46.440 --> 03:39:47.440]  going on.
[03:39:47.440 --> 03:39:51.480]  It's an element of the dystopia that not many people have talked about.
[03:39:51.480 --> 03:39:56.560]  For example, 1984 doesn't talk about the Skittles rainbow element of the dystopia that we're
[03:39:56.560 --> 03:40:02.880]  going into, but The Wanting Seed does, Brave New World does, by the way, but Clockwork
[03:40:02.880 --> 03:40:08.880]  Orange is interesting because it's a dystopian novel, and the movie presentation is not
[03:40:08.880 --> 03:40:11.600]  really about what you first think it's going to be.
[03:40:11.600 --> 03:40:16.320]  You think it's about, okay, there's these droogs, these gangsters that are running around New
[03:40:16.320 --> 03:40:25.080]  York, these wily British street folk, and you think, okay, so this is going to be about
[03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:26.080]  a gang.
[03:40:26.280 --> 03:40:35.120]  It turns out, when Alex is arrested, he's put into a medical, psycho, psychiatric rehabilitation
[03:40:35.120 --> 03:40:37.840]  program.
[03:40:37.840 --> 03:40:43.560]  The first act of the movie is about the gang stuff and the havoc that they're wreaking,
[03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:50.320]  and then the rest of the film turns into, basically, an MKUltra rehabilitation Skinner box.
[03:40:50.320 --> 03:40:56.360]  The rest of the movie is basically Alex in a Skinner box undergoing MKUltra mind control
[03:40:56.360 --> 03:40:59.320]  conditioning.
[03:40:59.320 --> 03:41:03.760]  The best sequence in the whole film that explains the purpose of all this is when one of the
[03:41:03.760 --> 03:41:08.160]  social scientist psychiatric guys gets up there and he says that the whole purpose of
[03:41:08.160 --> 03:41:16.800]  all of this is to take all of these inmates as an experiment to recondition them, to emasculate
[03:41:16.800 --> 03:41:25.440]  them and turn them into completely obedient, subservient creatures of the system, to basically
[03:41:25.440 --> 03:41:31.680]  break them in and to turn them into soy bug men, basically.
[03:41:32.800 --> 03:41:38.800]  So the prison system is the test tube for what they call in the movie,
[03:41:38.800 --> 03:41:43.800]  the Ludovico method, which is this method of re-imprinting you through
[03:41:43.800 --> 03:41:49.800]  trauma-based mind control and drugs to make you into a completely
[03:41:49.800 --> 03:41:52.800]  obedient, submissive soy man.
[03:41:52.800 --> 03:41:58.800]  And in the film, if I recall, it's been many years since I've watched it.
[03:41:58.800 --> 03:42:00.800]  I did an essay on this many years ago.
[03:42:00.800 --> 03:42:04.800]  But it's basically effective in the case of Alex, right?
[03:42:04.800 --> 03:42:10.800]  He eventually gets conditioned, so to speak, into being this sort of docile
[03:42:10.800 --> 03:42:12.800]  vegetable, right?
[03:42:12.800 --> 03:42:17.800]  And then after that, we see him maybe having a dream of a fantasy of engaging
[03:42:17.800 --> 03:42:18.800]  in his baser desires.
[03:42:18.800 --> 03:42:23.800]  But ultimately, it seems like the Ludovico method is effective in creating
[03:42:23.800 --> 03:42:26.800]  this docile, mind-controlled public.
[03:42:26.800 --> 03:42:28.800]  And that's eventually what they want.
[03:42:28.800 --> 03:42:34.800]  So there's a very profound dystopian movie message that I think ultimately
[03:42:34.800 --> 03:42:35.800]  is about MKUltra.
[03:42:35.800 --> 03:42:39.800]  And I think Burgess probably knew what Tavistock Clinic and what the
[03:42:39.800 --> 03:42:45.800]  MKUltra doctors were up to because that had a big role in the UK.
[03:42:45.800 --> 03:42:46.800]  It wasn't just America.
[03:42:46.800 --> 03:42:48.800]  It was kind of a global thing.
[03:42:48.800 --> 03:42:50.800]  It turns out MKUltra was everywhere.
[03:42:50.800 --> 03:42:53.800]  So when we come back, we'll finish up the last few movies that are the
[03:42:53.800 --> 03:42:56.800]  top ten conspiracy films of all time.
[03:42:56.800 --> 03:43:00.800]  A lot of people have asked me, why is MFulware's store at MFulware's life
[03:43:00.800 --> 03:43:02.800]  not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[03:43:02.800 --> 03:43:03.800]  And the answer is simple.
[03:43:03.800 --> 03:43:06.800]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[03:43:06.800 --> 03:43:11.800]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[03:43:11.800 --> 03:43:13.800]  They got bought by a libtard company and said,
[03:43:13.800 --> 03:43:16.800]  we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[03:43:16.800 --> 03:43:21.800]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves
[03:43:21.800 --> 03:43:22.800]  our show.
[03:43:22.800 --> 03:43:26.800]  We're able to private label it under MFulware's MD as our probiotic formula.

[03:44:25.800 --> 03:44:28.800]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good in my view.
[03:44:28.800 --> 03:44:30.800]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:44:30.800 --> 03:44:33.800]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:44:33.800 --> 03:44:35.800]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:44:36.800 --> 03:44:41.800]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:44:44.800 --> 03:44:47.800]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess
[03:44:47.800 --> 03:44:50.800]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:44:50.800 --> 03:44:51.800]  I just can't do it.
[03:44:51.800 --> 03:44:53.800]  MFulwarestore.com
[03:44:58.800 --> 03:45:03.800]  Two of our best selling nootropics or brain boosters are now back in stock
[03:45:03.800 --> 03:45:04.800]  at MFulwarestore.com.
[03:45:04.800 --> 03:45:07.800]  And for a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together
[03:45:07.800 --> 03:45:09.800]  or 40% off when you get them individually.
[03:45:09.800 --> 03:45:12.800]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra.
[03:45:12.800 --> 03:45:13.800]  Two separate formulas.
[03:45:13.800 --> 03:45:16.800]  They both give you good clean energy without the crash.
[03:45:16.800 --> 03:45:20.800]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy.
[03:45:20.800 --> 03:45:22.800]  Again, with no hangover or letdown.
[03:45:22.800 --> 03:45:25.800]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula.
[03:45:25.800 --> 03:45:27.800]  That's Brain Force Ultra that hits really, really quick.
[03:45:27.800 --> 03:45:28.800]  And I love it.
[03:45:28.800 --> 03:45:29.800]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[03:45:29.800 --> 03:45:32.800]  So if I've got to work at night but don't want to stay up all night,
[03:45:32.800 --> 03:45:34.800]  I can take it and say 9 o'clock at night.
[03:45:34.800 --> 03:45:36.800]  Got to stay up until midnight working, doing a radio interview or something.
[03:45:36.800 --> 03:45:37.800]  And boom.
[03:45:37.800 --> 03:45:39.800]  Or writing an article or writing a book.
[03:45:39.800 --> 03:45:43.800]  And then I get two, three hours of energy and then go right to bed after it.
[03:45:43.800 --> 03:45:46.800]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50% off by themselves
[03:45:46.800 --> 03:45:48.800]  or 40% off individually.
[03:45:48.800 --> 03:45:49.800]  A lot of people love these products.
[03:45:49.800 --> 03:45:50.800]  They've got five-star reviews.
[03:45:50.800 --> 03:45:52.800]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[03:45:52.800 --> 03:45:56.800]  50% off, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:56.800 --> 03:46:00.800]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:46:00.800 --> 03:46:02.800]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:46:02.800 --> 03:46:06.800]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:46:06.800 --> 03:46:09.800]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes,
[03:46:09.800 --> 03:46:15.800]  the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:46:15.800 --> 03:46:17.800]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[03:46:17.800 --> 03:46:22.800]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week,
[03:46:22.800 --> 03:46:24.800]  it's really just incredible.
[03:46:24.800 --> 03:46:27.800]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:46:27.800 --> 03:46:31.800]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air
[03:46:31.800 --> 03:46:33.800]  if you do not support us.
[03:46:33.800 --> 03:46:34.800]  I know you spread the word.
[03:46:34.800 --> 03:46:35.800]  I know you pray for us.
[03:46:35.800 --> 03:46:36.800]  And that's wonderful.
[03:46:36.800 --> 03:46:37.800]  Keep doing it.
[03:46:37.800 --> 03:46:40.800]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com
[03:46:40.800 --> 03:46:43.800]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[03:46:43.800 --> 03:46:45.800]  all at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:49.800]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:49.800 --> 03:46:53.800]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com,
[03:46:53.800 --> 03:46:54.800]  our funding problems will be over.
[03:46:54.800 --> 03:46:56.800]  Please take action now.
[03:46:57.800 --> 03:47:01.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:47:01.800 --> 03:47:03.800]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.800 --> 03:47:16.119]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:47:16.119 --> 03:47:20.400]  We are going through the top ten conspiracy movies of all time that show us how the world
[03:47:20.400 --> 03:47:21.400]  really works.
[03:47:21.400 --> 03:47:26.039]  They were telling us all along in so many films what's actually going on in the world.
[03:47:26.039 --> 03:47:30.679]  And movies are a great way to wake up your friends and family that don't know about this
[03:47:30.679 --> 03:47:34.720]  stuff or kind of maybe just now kind of waking up and figuring out what's going on.
[03:47:34.720 --> 03:47:37.640]  You can go back and show them, hey, a lot of these old movies that you grew up with
[03:47:37.640 --> 03:47:41.500]  that you saw when you were a kid, they were actually telling you a lot of this stuff if
[03:47:41.500 --> 03:47:42.500]  you paid attention.
[03:47:42.500 --> 03:47:47.519]  And I want to remind you too that for our audience in terms of movies, we'll be doing
[03:47:47.519 --> 03:47:50.960]  a live event in Hollywood very soon with Jamie Kennedy.
[03:47:50.960 --> 03:47:55.000]  If you've seen The Jamie Kennedy Experiment, if you've seen Malibu's Most Wanted, if you've
[03:47:55.000 --> 03:47:59.439]  seen Scream, so many great movies.
[03:47:59.439 --> 03:48:03.840]  And I think Jamie was in, in my view, one of the funniest TV shows of all time, The
[03:48:03.960 --> 03:48:08.119]  Jamie Kennedy Experiment is genius and a lot of interesting psychology.
[03:48:08.119 --> 03:48:10.160]  If you watch that show, it's not just a comedy show.
[03:48:10.160 --> 03:48:15.920]  There's a lot of interesting psychological studies you could do on the basis of how people
[03:48:15.920 --> 03:48:18.720]  react to a lot of those scenarios.
[03:48:18.720 --> 03:48:23.759]  And if you go to my Twitter, the very top of my Twitter, you'll see a pinned tweet that
[03:48:23.759 --> 03:48:24.759]  got a lot of views.
[03:48:24.759 --> 03:48:29.960]  And then right underneath that, you'll see the Eventbrite link you can get right there.
[03:48:29.960 --> 03:48:30.960]  Go to that.
[03:48:30.960 --> 03:48:31.960]  It's on my Twitter.
[03:48:32.080 --> 03:48:33.080]  It's at the top.
[03:48:33.080 --> 03:48:34.080]  Jay Dyer on Twitter.
[03:48:34.080 --> 03:48:40.560]  And you can get tickets to our event July 6th at the Valley Relics Museum there in
[03:48:40.560 --> 03:48:48.199]  Van Nuys, right outside of Los Angeles or Los Angeles area, Malibu area-ish area.
[03:48:48.199 --> 03:48:50.279]  So get your tickets there at Eventbrite.
[03:48:50.279 --> 03:48:53.660]  And we'll be doing a five-hour event where we cover Hollywood.
[03:48:53.660 --> 03:48:54.660]  We cover movies.
[03:48:54.660 --> 03:48:59.439]  Me and my wife, I do a lot of comedic stuff and do a lot of impressions.
[03:48:59.439 --> 03:49:03.000]  We have an hour-and-a-half on film analysis that Jamie does.
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:10.480]  I do an hour-and-a-half on my book, Film Symbolism, and on philosophy.
[03:49:10.480 --> 03:49:12.359]  So I'll be talking about this book.
[03:49:12.359 --> 03:49:15.560]  You can come get your book signed, book signing, all of that.
[03:49:15.560 --> 03:49:21.439]  And then Jamie Kennedy will be doing a stand-up for about 20 or 30 minutes as the headliner
[03:49:21.439 --> 03:49:23.320]  of the show towards the end.
[03:49:23.320 --> 03:49:25.400]  So go get your tickets at the Eventbrite link.
[03:49:25.400 --> 03:49:27.400]  It's also on every post on my website.
[03:49:27.400 --> 03:49:28.960]  You can find the links there to get the tickets.
[03:49:28.960 --> 03:49:31.279]  July 6th in Hollywood.
[03:49:31.279 --> 03:49:32.480]  Be sure and come on out.
[03:49:32.480 --> 03:49:35.759]  Now, we were talking about these movies that tell us everything.
[03:49:35.759 --> 03:49:37.279]  Clockwork Orange was a classic.
[03:49:37.279 --> 03:49:42.679]  Let's get the next one, Conspiracy Theory, 1997, Richard Donner, Mel Gibson movie.
[03:49:42.679 --> 03:49:48.519]  Of course, Mel is in quite a few conspiracy-ish, conspiracy-themed movies, but this one was
[03:49:48.519 --> 03:49:50.039]  one of the classics.
[03:49:50.039 --> 03:49:54.240]  Edge of Darkness is another Mel Gibson conspiracy movie that a lot of people overlook.
[03:49:54.240 --> 03:49:57.119]  A lot of interesting things going on in that, but the reason I chose Conspiracy Theory is
[03:49:57.279 --> 03:50:01.279]  not just the title of it, but in my own life, this was one of the first movies I watched.
[03:50:01.279 --> 03:50:03.800]  It came out in 1997.
[03:50:03.800 --> 03:50:05.160]  I remember seeing it at the theater.
[03:50:05.160 --> 03:50:09.039]  That was kind of my first exposure to conspiracy culture.
[03:50:09.039 --> 03:50:13.920]  I know X-Files had kind of just got going on Fox back in the mid-to-late 90s.
[03:50:13.920 --> 03:50:16.000]  I didn't really watch TV back then.
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:17.960]  I was in high school, so I didn't care about TV.
[03:50:17.960 --> 03:50:21.880]  I cared about girls, and I remember going to the movie.
[03:50:21.880 --> 03:50:24.679]  I did like movies, and I remember going and thinking, this is pretty crazy.
[03:50:24.679 --> 03:50:28.880]  I wonder how much of the stuff that Crazy Jerry, the conspiracy theorist, talks about
[03:50:28.880 --> 03:50:30.320]  is actually correct.
[03:50:30.320 --> 03:50:33.039]  If you watch the movie, quite a bit of what he said was correct.
[03:50:33.039 --> 03:50:37.880]  He got some things wrong because he ran a little conspiracy newsletter, if you remember
[03:50:37.880 --> 03:50:39.759]  in the film.
[03:50:39.759 --> 03:50:44.359]  It turns out, and I'm not spoiling too much if you've never seen it, it turns out that
[03:50:44.359 --> 03:50:52.019]  Jerry was actually a subject of MKUltra, and Patrick Stewart, Captain Picard, he plays
[03:50:52.019 --> 03:50:54.240]  the handler to Jerry.
[03:50:54.240 --> 03:50:58.199]  He's actually Jerry's CIA handler who was mind-controlling him to create a programmed
[03:50:58.199 --> 03:50:59.400]  assassin.
[03:50:59.400 --> 03:51:05.960]  They were using him as a private, secret, corporate assassin group that could be used
[03:51:05.960 --> 03:51:06.960]  for hire.
[03:51:06.960 --> 03:51:07.960]  It wasn't really even the CIA.
[03:51:07.960 --> 03:51:12.500]  It was people who had gone on from the CIA to create a private corporate intelligence
[03:51:12.500 --> 03:51:19.000]  network of private assassins that would then go and kill politicians.
[03:51:19.000 --> 03:51:23.039]  The story was, of course, that Mel Gibson was supposed to kill Julia Roberts' dad, who was
[03:51:23.119 --> 03:51:25.640]  a high-level politician.
[03:51:25.640 --> 03:51:31.439]  It turns out that most of his paranoia was true, and a huge part of the narrative is
[03:51:31.439 --> 03:51:32.640]  about MKUltra.
[03:51:32.640 --> 03:51:37.880]  If you go back and watch it, it's amazing how much of MKUltra and how much accuracy was
[03:51:37.880 --> 03:51:41.000]  packed into that film.
[03:51:41.000 --> 03:51:46.320]  Mel Gibson has done some of the best work in terms of putting out good messages in Hollywood.
[03:51:46.320 --> 03:51:50.519]  People have dug up actually old clips from around this time of the mid to late 90s when
[03:51:50.519 --> 03:51:54.480]  Mel was actually saying how dark Hollywood was even back then.
[03:51:54.480 --> 03:52:00.160]  So super-duper, mega, red-pill-based Mel, way ahead of time when it comes to talking
[03:52:00.160 --> 03:52:05.599]  about the esoteric, occult, satanic elements even back then.
[03:52:05.599 --> 03:52:10.480]  So I highly recommend if you've never watched Conspiracy Theory, go back and watch it, and
[03:52:10.480 --> 03:52:12.080]  you'll be pleasantly surprised.
[03:52:12.080 --> 03:52:15.840]  It holds up pretty well, and especially the conspiracy stuff.
[03:52:15.840 --> 03:52:20.560]  So much of this has actually come out in a brilliant way.
[03:52:20.560 --> 03:52:23.160]  Next movie, we can't pass up another 90s film.
[03:52:23.160 --> 03:52:28.080]  I remember when this came out, I wasn't super into it just because I didn't know much about
[03:52:28.080 --> 03:52:35.400]  the JFK assassination, and I was only about maybe 12 or so.
[03:52:35.400 --> 03:52:42.039]  I mean, I was just now hitting high school era, starting freshman high school or something.
[03:52:42.039 --> 03:52:49.000]  And that's the 1991 Oliver Stone film, JFK, which turns out was based on multiple different
[03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:53.039]  authors that I think Alex has had most of these authors on over the years.
[03:52:53.039 --> 03:52:55.160]  He's had Jim Mars on.
[03:52:55.160 --> 03:52:59.000]  I think Jim Mars' book played a key role in Oliver Stone.
[03:52:59.000 --> 03:53:05.359]  I think Jim Mars consulted in part on the screenplay with Oliver Stone.
[03:53:05.359 --> 03:53:11.840]  I know that Colonel Fletcher Prouty's book Secret Team played part of a role in this
[03:53:11.840 --> 03:53:12.840]  film.
[03:53:12.840 --> 03:53:14.800]  That's a classic.
[03:53:14.800 --> 03:53:19.439]  And I know that I think Mark Lane's book also played a role.
[03:53:19.439 --> 03:53:24.640]  So a lot of the classic kind of JFK writers and early phase conspiracy people did have
[03:53:24.640 --> 03:53:28.359]  a role in helping Oliver Stone to put this together.
[03:53:28.359 --> 03:53:34.920]  And there was sort of a golden period in the 80s and 90s when you could still get a lot
[03:53:34.920 --> 03:53:37.199]  of these kinds of movies made.
[03:53:37.199 --> 03:53:41.599]  And so I think, you know, Oliver Stone deserves props for for getting that done.
[03:53:41.599 --> 03:53:44.960]  And Alex has had Sean Stone on many times.
[03:53:44.960 --> 03:53:49.199]  I've had done many podcasts and shows and hung out with Sean Stone, and, you know, he knows
[03:53:49.199 --> 03:53:52.000]  a lot about this stuff and the Hollywood stuff, too, that we've talked about.
[03:53:52.000 --> 03:53:57.560]  So I would say go back and watch JFK and you'll notice how much of that old generation conspiracy
[03:53:57.560 --> 03:54:00.599]  stuff actually comes through in the story.
[03:54:00.599 --> 03:54:02.279]  We find out the mafia elements.
[03:54:02.279 --> 03:54:03.880]  We find out the CIA elements.
[03:54:03.880 --> 03:54:08.199]  And that's that's important because a lot of this has now come to the fore, not just
[03:54:08.199 --> 03:54:16.119]  with Tucker covering the CIA relationship to the JFK assassination, but now RFK rising
[03:54:16.119 --> 03:54:19.720]  in popularity and getting out there and talking about a lot of these issues and basically
[03:54:19.720 --> 03:54:26.480]  saying, yeah, the CIA was it was crucial in the assassination of my elder family members.
[03:54:26.480 --> 03:54:27.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:54:27.480 --> 03:54:31.000]  So go back and watch Oliver Stone, JFK, and I think you'll notice that a lot of other
[03:54:31.119 --> 03:54:35.160]  Oliver Stone films also have, you know, conspiracy themes here and there.
[03:54:35.160 --> 03:54:42.480]  But I think JFK comes to the fore as the most conspiratorial of his films and and probably
[03:54:42.480 --> 03:54:45.880]  the closest to pretty much what went on right that day.
[03:54:45.880 --> 03:54:48.720]  I think it's pretty clear that you have people like E.
[03:54:48.720 --> 03:54:49.720]  Howard Hunt.
[03:54:49.720 --> 03:54:54.119]  Alex, in fact, years ago, went and got a deathbed interview with E.
[03:54:54.119 --> 03:54:57.880]  Howard Hunt before he passed away, saying, yes, I had a key role in that.
[03:54:58.199 --> 03:55:01.519]  And I think at that time, Alex was the only person covered that maybe Rolling Stone did
[03:55:01.519 --> 03:55:02.519]  a piece on it.
[03:55:02.519 --> 03:55:04.000]  But Alex has an old interview with E.
[03:55:04.000 --> 03:55:05.000]  Howard Hunt.
[03:55:05.000 --> 03:55:06.000]  You guys should try to dig that up.
[03:55:06.000 --> 03:55:08.640]  It's a classic because you say, yeah, it was us.
[03:55:08.640 --> 03:55:09.640]  We did it.
[03:55:09.640 --> 03:55:10.640]  See, I did it.
[03:55:10.640 --> 03:55:12.039]  I had a key role in that, as well as other factors.
[03:55:12.039 --> 03:55:14.240]  Mafia played a role, too.
[03:55:14.240 --> 03:55:16.080]  So a huge admissions there from from E.
[03:55:16.080 --> 03:55:19.199]  Howard Hunt back in the day.
[03:55:19.199 --> 03:55:22.199]  Next film, I would say that's really important.
[03:55:22.199 --> 03:55:28.359]  This is what round out the 10th of my top 10 conspiracy movies would be the old, old,
[03:55:28.359 --> 03:55:32.880]  old movie Metropolis from Fritz Lang, 1927 film.
[03:55:32.880 --> 03:55:36.320]  Now, it's going to be a little difficult to watch if you've never watched this film.
[03:55:36.320 --> 03:55:41.160]  There are actually some versions that people have made on YouTube which have sound and
[03:55:41.160 --> 03:55:44.259]  this is an old silent film, basically.
[03:55:44.259 --> 03:55:46.920]  And they've added music and there's colorized versions.
[03:55:46.920 --> 03:55:48.679]  And so it's about a three hour movie.
[03:55:48.679 --> 03:55:51.080]  So two and a half to something like that.
[03:55:51.080 --> 03:55:52.080]  Two forty five.
[03:55:52.960 --> 03:55:53.960]  So it's going to take a lot of time and effort.
[03:55:53.960 --> 03:55:54.960]  It's not an easy.
[03:55:54.960 --> 03:55:55.960]  It's very different.
[03:55:55.960 --> 03:55:57.160]  I'll say that.
[03:55:57.160 --> 03:56:02.320]  But there's a lot of really profound futurist elements in this, including the prediction
[03:56:02.320 --> 03:56:08.840]  of the rise of A.I. sex bots and how that would be used to control the city.
[03:56:08.840 --> 03:56:15.119]  The social sphere might even be destroyed by the implementation of A.I. and sex bots.
[03:56:15.119 --> 03:56:18.599]  That's actually what this 1927 movie is about.
[03:56:18.920 --> 03:56:21.840]  Amazing, amazing, prophetic elements in there.
[03:56:21.840 --> 03:56:26.759]  This is probably one of the most profound future presentations that we've ever seen.
[03:56:26.759 --> 03:56:34.039]  In fact, when they create the A.I., she is created by a mad scientist sitting there underneath
[03:56:34.039 --> 03:56:35.039]  an inverted pentagram.
[03:56:35.039 --> 03:56:43.160]  And the idea in the film is that this will actually be a satanic ritual process which
[03:56:43.160 --> 03:56:48.080]  will bring about the A.I., which will then bring about the apocalypse and the destruction
[03:56:48.560 --> 03:56:49.560]  of society.
[03:56:49.560 --> 03:56:56.000]  The film actually has a lot of references to Babylon, the whore city of the Book of
[03:56:56.000 --> 03:56:57.880]  Revelation and all this kind of stuff.
[03:56:57.880 --> 03:57:00.679]  That's all in the film from 1927.
[03:57:00.679 --> 03:57:06.160]  And it predicted, again, that it would actually be transhumanism that would bring about the
[03:57:06.160 --> 03:57:07.160]  collapse of society.
[03:57:07.160 --> 03:57:10.720]  And so in the film, they will spoil it, but they realize that, hey, maybe this isn't a
[03:57:10.720 --> 03:57:16.439]  good idea to release A.I. sex bots on the population.
[03:57:16.439 --> 03:57:18.359]  You might end up in an apocalypse.
[03:57:18.359 --> 03:57:20.720]  So I hope you enjoyed this.
[03:57:20.720 --> 03:57:21.720]  There it is.
[03:57:21.720 --> 03:57:26.320]  There's that great sequence there where she's seated at the base of an inverted pyramid
[03:57:26.320 --> 03:57:31.480]  where the science, basically dark alchemical science, is actually a satanic endeavor to
[03:57:31.480 --> 03:57:36.800]  invert nature and turn it into something dark or control.
[03:57:36.800 --> 03:57:41.199]  If you would like deeper analyses, my books actually have full-on analyses of all these
[03:57:41.199 --> 03:57:42.199]  films that we covered today.
[03:57:42.199 --> 03:57:48.240]  You can go to my website, JasonElsis.com, in the shop and get signed copies.
[03:57:48.240 --> 03:57:54.160]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpastes designed by my father, a dentist, at InfoWareStore.com
[03:57:54.160 --> 03:57:58.519]  that don't have fillers, that are filled with high-quality essential oils and more.
[03:57:58.519 --> 03:58:00.880]  We have the turmeric toothpaste.
[03:58:00.880 --> 03:58:04.359]  We have the ultimate tooth whitening with pearl calcium toothpaste.
[03:58:04.359 --> 03:58:08.320]  And we have the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch of key
[03:58:08.320 --> 03:58:11.759]  essential oils that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums, but your whole
[03:58:11.759 --> 03:58:13.519]  mouth, your throat, and more.
[03:58:13.519 --> 03:58:15.279]  These are really game-changing toothpastes.
[03:58:15.279 --> 03:58:17.039]  They're very, very strong.
[03:58:17.039 --> 03:58:18.960]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[03:58:18.960 --> 03:58:19.960]  Ours don't.
[03:58:19.960 --> 03:58:21.439]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[03:58:21.439 --> 03:58:27.439]  It is just chock full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[03:58:27.439 --> 03:58:29.199]  So it's now back in stock.
[03:58:29.199 --> 03:58:30.960]  It became a bestseller.
[03:58:30.960 --> 03:58:33.920]  The turmeric toothpaste is available again at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:58:33.920 --> 03:58:35.679]  We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[03:58:35.679 --> 03:58:36.679]  We've got some of that left.
[03:58:36.679 --> 03:58:40.359]  And we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock, but it's running
[03:58:40.359 --> 03:58:41.359]  out as well.
[03:58:41.359 --> 03:58:46.759]  So all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time, InfoWareStore.com.
[03:58:46.759 --> 03:58:53.039]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[03:58:53.039 --> 03:58:54.160]  the atmosphere.
[03:58:54.160 --> 03:58:56.880]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:58:56.880 --> 03:59:03.320]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[03:59:03.320 --> 03:59:07.759]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:59:07.759 --> 03:59:11.119]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[03:59:11.160 --> 03:59:13.560]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:59:13.560 --> 03:59:18.560]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who
[03:59:18.560 --> 03:59:22.080]  was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[03:59:22.080 --> 03:59:28.599]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[03:59:28.599 --> 03:59:30.960]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:59:30.960 --> 03:59:36.240]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:59:36.279 --> 03:59:42.240]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.
[03:59:42.240 --> 03:59:45.240]  Available now at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:59:48.240 --> 03:59:54.439]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
