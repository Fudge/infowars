[02:13.480 --> 02:18.320]  foods and the industrial complex it's trying to shove those down our
[02:18.320 --> 02:22.080]  throats but let's get into some of the headlines here I'm just going to cover
[02:22.080 --> 02:25.840]  them briefly we'll get into more details on the other side of the break coming up
[02:25.840 --> 02:31.320]  here shortly we've got tainted beef hits Japanese market right now Japan has
[02:31.320 --> 02:36.960]  realized oh my goodness people have been eating beef that's radioactive it has
[02:36.960 --> 02:43.760]  up to seven times the level of radioactive cesium that is allowed by law
[02:43.760 --> 02:49.000]  and it has been sold into the food supply remember when we warned about this
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.720]  remember right here on the show Alex was warning you about this we were talking
[02:53.720 --> 02:59.320]  about this the food supply is tainted with cesium it's not an exaggeration
[02:59.320 --> 03:04.320]  it's not a conspiracy theory it's physics cesium is in the food supply and
[03:04.320 --> 03:09.320]  it's in the beef in Japan that is now being consumed in fact they say this is
[03:09.320 --> 03:14.400]  this is from the Wall Street Journal it says that some of the beef has already
[03:14.400 --> 03:21.960]  been consumed Japanese government officials said oops there's no way to
[03:21.960 --> 03:28.940]  undo that I suppose radioactive beef we call it we call it pre-cooked beef you
[03:28.940 --> 03:34.600]  don't have to microwave it as much as you normally do somehow and look I'm
[03:34.600 --> 03:37.760]  imagine what's in the food that they're not telling you about I mean this is the
[03:37.760 --> 03:42.120]  stuff they're admitting publicly imagine what they're not admitting it's not
[03:42.120 --> 03:46.680]  just the radiation it's also the GMOs it's also the chemical preservatives it's
[03:46.680 --> 03:50.800]  also also the artificial food colors that we know cause behavioral disorders
[03:50.800 --> 03:56.040]  in children it's many other contaminants that aren't even listed on the label so
[03:56.040 --> 03:59.720]  many things in the food that they won't tell us about it's amazing when they
[03:59.720 --> 04:07.320]  ever admit something DC firefighters now are being called on to help police the
[04:07.320 --> 04:14.520]  streets in Washington DC yes this is an amazing new program in Washington DC
[04:14.520 --> 04:21.600]  firefighters and EMS personnel have been asked to park their trucks in high crime
[04:21.600 --> 04:28.000]  neighborhoods and this is supposed to prevent crime look I wouldn't park my
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.480]  truck in a high crime neighborhood most people wouldn't the firefighters are
[04:32.480 --> 04:36.200]  being asked to but they're not given any firearms or any training on how to deal
[04:36.200 --> 04:39.840]  with criminals that might come up to them in those high crime neighborhoods
[04:39.840 --> 04:43.560]  anyway stay with us we're taking a short break here we'll be right back to
[04:43.560 --> 04:47.400]  break this down and talk about the death ceiling and a lot more right here on the

[06:03.040 --> 06:07.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[06:07.360 --> 06:11.560]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[06:11.560 --> 06:15.600]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.600 --> 06:19.480]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.480 --> 06:23.720]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:23.720 --> 06:27.880]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:27.880 --> 06:32.200]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:32.200 --> 06:35.920]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[08:04.440 --> 08:11.520]  Jones show because there's a war on for your mind welcome back everybody this is
[08:11.520 --> 08:16.720]  Mike Adams the health ranger filling in today for Alex Jones I'm the editor of
[08:16.720 --> 08:21.160]  natural news and a frequent contributor to infowars.com where we break down
[08:21.160 --> 08:24.960]  issues like health freedom and GMOs the chemical contaminants in your food
[08:24.960 --> 08:29.800]  supply and many other issues and before the break we were talking about this new
[08:29.800 --> 08:36.240]  thing in DC the firefighters are being asked now to play a police role check
[08:36.240 --> 08:41.160]  this out the city is asking them to park their fire trucks in high crime
[08:41.160 --> 08:45.560]  neighborhoods right because just the presence of their fire truck is supposed
[08:45.560 --> 08:50.960]  to somehow suppress crime in those neighborhoods but of course firefighters
[08:50.960 --> 08:53.920]  are up in arms over this except they don't have arms I mean they don't have
[08:53.920 --> 08:58.880]  firearms so but they're protesting it because look they don't have the fire
[08:58.880 --> 09:03.080]  arms they don't have the training of how to deal with criminals with violent
[09:03.080 --> 09:08.480]  crime you know physical combat that kind of thing so they're not given the
[09:08.480 --> 09:12.200]  proper training or equipment to deal with these law enforcement situations and
[09:12.200 --> 09:16.520]  yet they're being asked to play a law enforcement role now this isn't the first
[09:16.520 --> 09:23.120]  time remember remember when the postal workers were asked to spy on Americans
[09:23.120 --> 09:27.200]  when they were delivering the mail they were supposed to be on the lookout for
[09:27.200 --> 09:32.400]  anything suspicious and report it to the government yeah because they're going
[09:32.400 --> 09:37.400]  house-to-house why not turn them into a band of little secret police this is
[09:37.400 --> 09:42.360]  what's happening in America today everybody who's on the government payroll
[09:42.360 --> 09:47.960]  is now eventually likely to be asked to play a law enforcement role this is
[09:47.960 --> 09:52.240]  this is how police states happen you know and today it's the firefighters
[09:52.240 --> 09:57.600]  tomorrow it's the teachers let's say or it's the people at the DMV maybe they're
[09:57.600 --> 10:01.320]  supposed to report terrorism right in fact I think they're already asked to do
[10:01.320 --> 10:08.160]  that but firefighters here a union spokesperson for the DC police says
[10:08.160 --> 10:13.720]  quote I think this is a disaster you're putting untrained unsupervised on
[10:13.720 --> 10:18.600]  equipped firefighters in some of the most dangerous neighborhoods in town to
[10:18.600 --> 10:22.560]  perform a law enforcement function I mean what are what are they supposed to do
[10:22.560 --> 10:28.160]  fight back with their hatchets fire hoses turn on the fire hose Bob we've
[10:28.160 --> 10:32.800]  got a an armed gang approaching our fire truck I think they're likely to get
[10:32.800 --> 10:40.320]  their fire trucks jacked look there's a fire truck rolling around DC and there's
[10:40.320 --> 10:47.280]  no fireman in it somebody took that for a joyride moving on Apple pays a South
[10:47.280 --> 10:56.040]  Korean user compensation over the iPhone tracking wow okay remember when we were
[10:56.040 --> 10:59.360]  told there was no tracking going on and that was just a crazy conspiracy theory
[10:59.360 --> 11:02.560]  what tracking what are you talking about these are just cell phones and they're
[11:02.560 --> 11:06.480]  not even bad for you they don't even cause cancer nothing nothing wrong with
[11:06.480 --> 11:09.640]  cell phones load them up use them on both sides of your head at the same time
[11:09.640 --> 11:14.280]  who cares make your head into a giant toaster oven it's all fine now they've
[11:14.280 --> 11:20.240]  that it's come out that the tracking is happening it has come out that Apple that
[11:20.240 --> 11:25.640]  the phones actually synchronize with the Apple servers and they upload tracking
[11:25.640 --> 11:29.320]  information about which cell phone towers you're connected to every hour of
[11:29.320 --> 11:35.760]  the day so now they've agreed to the first payout ever from Apple inks Korean
[11:35.760 --> 11:41.080]  unit to pay compensation to a user and the compensation is for collecting
[11:41.080 --> 11:47.200]  location data without consent hmm aren't they doing that to us all if they're
[11:47.200 --> 11:51.720]  going to pay a South Korean user some compensation what's going to happen in
[11:51.720 --> 11:55.760]  the US what if what if everybody who use an iPhone asked for compensation company
[11:55.760 --> 11:59.960]  would be in some trouble by the way related to Apple there's another story
[11:59.960 --> 12:06.760]  and we posted this earlier today there's a guy a young guy who sold a kidney in
[12:06.760 --> 12:12.440]  order to buy an iPad yeah he sold a kidney this is in China and I think he
[12:12.440 --> 12:19.920]  got something like $3,000 roughly for his kidney one of his kidneys and he went
[12:19.920 --> 12:23.880]  to a hospital they surgically removed it because you know the organ trade is
[12:23.880 --> 12:28.880]  is quite a prolific and very profitable system throughout China the whole black
[12:28.880 --> 12:33.280]  market of organ trading is just that's a whole another show right there actually
[12:33.280 --> 12:37.280]  and that goes on in the US too it's not just China there are there are organs
[12:37.280 --> 12:42.840]  being traded all over the place in the US market and in Canada as well whole
[12:42.840 --> 12:47.880]  another story but this this young guy sold his kidney for three grand to buy
[12:47.880 --> 12:54.280]  an iPad and now he's having health problems go figure you know your kidneys
[12:54.280 --> 12:57.600]  are in there for a reason folks your gallbladder is in there for a reason I
[12:57.600 --> 13:02.120]  always hear these stories about people having the gallbladder removed is that
[13:02.120 --> 13:05.720]  some pain in their side and the doctor says no big deal let's just take it out
[13:05.720 --> 13:08.640]  we take it out all the time it's routine everybody does it just take it out and
[13:08.640 --> 13:12.920]  they don't even tell you what is for like oh you might need some digestive
[13:12.920 --> 13:19.240]  enzymes to digest some dietary oils if you're missing that part that function
[13:19.240 --> 13:24.720]  every organ has a function you know the liver the heart the gallbladder and yes
[13:24.720 --> 13:29.080]  the kidneys as well and if you're missing those organs something's wrong I
[13:29.080 --> 13:32.120]  don't think an iPad can compensate for that I don't think you can download an
[13:32.120 --> 13:36.560]  iPad app that's going to clean the junk out of your blood like your kidney does
[13:36.560 --> 13:41.560]  doesn't work that way moving on the debt ceiling today this is a big issue and
[13:41.560 --> 13:45.760]  by the way for those of you just joining us I'm filling in for Alex today Mike
[13:45.760 --> 13:48.920]  Adams the health ranger happy to join you just in case you didn't recognize
[13:48.920 --> 13:54.080]  who's who's talking who is this I'm not Alex Jones I'm Mike Adams thank you for
[13:54.080 --> 13:57.320]  joining us and we have an action-packed show for you today lots of guests lined
[13:57.320 --> 14:01.440]  up we're gonna have in fact Julie Bass at the bottom of the hour she's the
[14:01.440 --> 14:05.880]  woman in Oak Park Michigan who's being threatened with jail time for growing her
[14:05.880 --> 14:12.240]  own garden we're gonna get to her later Obama walkout linked to debt panic ploy
[14:12.240 --> 14:19.080]  that's the headline on info wars.com Paul Joseph Watson he's got a great story
[14:19.080 --> 14:22.600]  on there check out info wars.com today for the breaking news on this the debt
[14:22.600 --> 14:28.240]  ceiling issue is coming to a head August 2nd that deadline is coming right up
[14:28.240 --> 14:34.280]  and people are starting to panic out there in the US that is I should say
[14:34.280 --> 14:38.520]  people who don't know what's going on people who don't really listen to the
[14:38.520 --> 14:43.720]  Alex Jones show because they're too busy to be informed they don't know what's
[14:43.720 --> 14:48.240]  going on so they're starting to panic and Obama said hey look August 3rd we
[14:48.240 --> 14:52.400]  don't know if we can even send out the checks that's right all those social
[14:52.400 --> 14:56.280]  security checks going out how many tens of millions of people are on social
[14:56.280 --> 14:59.440]  security checks and other checks is not just social security it's also veterans
[14:59.440 --> 15:05.200]  checks we're not sure if we can even send those out hmm that's got some people in
[15:05.200 --> 15:12.040]  a panic so now so now Obama is in this crazy game of financial chicken with
[15:12.040 --> 15:19.040]  Congress and in this game Obama doesn't even admit that Congress is the
[15:19.040 --> 15:24.080]  entity in government that's supposed to control all the finances remember that
[15:24.080 --> 15:28.720]  Congress controls the purse strings and Obama and the executive branch of
[15:28.720 --> 15:33.840]  government simply carries them out well that seems to be going by the wayside
[15:33.840 --> 15:37.880]  all of a sudden because the executive branch wants to invoke all of these
[15:37.880 --> 15:43.640]  crazy remember the stuff from what this this this strange segment in the 14th
[15:43.640 --> 15:48.800]  amendment that was used in the Civil War reparations wants to invoke that to
[15:48.800 --> 15:54.080]  make to make us raise the debt ceiling and and go deeper into debt well anyway
[15:54.080 --> 15:59.920]  Obama walked out and now the Republican leaders are they're playing that chicken
[15:59.920 --> 16:04.880]  game with them too look folks this is all this is all theater okay they're
[16:04.880 --> 16:09.320]  going to reach some kind of agreement before August 2nd you can be sure of
[16:09.320 --> 16:14.240]  that they're going to reach something this is just jockeying for position this
[16:14.240 --> 16:20.720]  is political posturing this is everybody's trying to say we're not going
[16:20.720 --> 16:25.760]  to back down but eventually they will have to because if they don't reach an
[16:25.760 --> 16:30.000]  agreement before August 2nd in fact they need to reach it well before August
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.760]  2nd so that the government can actually get organized enough to send out the
[16:34.760 --> 16:40.640]  checks on August 3rd so they will reach an agreement because if they don't on
[16:40.640 --> 16:45.840]  August 3rd guess what's going to happen the US credit rating is it could be
[16:45.840 --> 16:51.200]  downgraded in fact Moody's is now this is in Bloomberg Moody's places US on
[16:51.200 --> 17:00.720]  review for downgrade as debt talks stall Moody's finally look the US has a
[17:00.720 --> 17:07.840]  AAA debt rating which it should be junk bond status as of right now and then
[17:07.840 --> 17:12.000]  they're threatening to downgrade them just slightly just a little bit from the
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.200]  AAA super wonderful rating down to something slightly less than super
[17:16.200 --> 17:20.720]  wonderful that's that's what the threat is all about well the US can't afford
[17:20.720 --> 17:24.720]  that because if its debt rating was downgraded all of a sudden it would
[17:24.720 --> 17:31.320]  cost more money to borrow money but what's the point anyway because the Fed
[17:31.320 --> 17:36.120]  is just keeps printing more money more quantitative easing which is really just
[17:36.120 --> 17:40.880]  a code word for creating more fiat currency that's devaluing the value of
[17:40.880 --> 17:45.600]  your dollars the dollars that you're depending on from Social Security from
[17:45.600 --> 17:49.880]  your paycheck from your retirement fund whatever it might be those dollars are
[17:49.880 --> 17:53.920]  becoming increasingly worthless every single day it's like Alex said on the
[17:53.920 --> 17:58.280]  show earlier this week sure you may get your Social Security check after August
[17:58.280 --> 18:04.160]  3rd but it's not worth as much anymore guess what the jokes on you haha you got
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.360]  your check it still has the same numbers on it but those numbers don't mean half
[18:08.360 --> 18:13.200]  as much anymore that's where it's all heading in the in the near future if the
[18:13.200 --> 18:17.160]  Fed keeps on printing money you could be getting your Social Security check they
[18:17.160 --> 18:20.400]  could add a couple of zeros on the end of it and you could still maybe buy a
[18:20.400 --> 18:23.680]  few loaves of bread and put a few gallons of gas in the tank and that's
[18:23.680 --> 18:28.160]  about all it's going to be able to handle because the dollars themselves are
[18:28.160 --> 18:34.960]  increasingly worthless thanks to the Fed thanks to these cowards in Congress
[18:34.960 --> 18:39.360]  and in the executive branch who don't tackle the real issue which is
[18:39.360 --> 18:43.840]  eliminating the debt which is bringing down government spending which is
[18:43.840 --> 18:49.720]  cutting government by as much as 80% I think let's cut it let's cut it down to
[18:49.720 --> 18:52.960]  where we can actually afford a government that so that we can actually
[18:52.960 --> 18:57.960]  pay our way and not go deeper into debt they don't want to do that
[18:57.960 --> 19:03.000]  Obama wants to raise taxes well what's the point what's the point if they raise
[19:03.000 --> 19:08.240]  taxes they're just going to find another way to spend those trillions gonna
[19:08.240 --> 19:12.600]  spend it you think that's going to come back to you as some kind of some kind of
[19:12.600 --> 19:15.480]  savings down the road you think they're going to invest that in something that's
[19:15.480 --> 19:20.040]  going to help you not a chance it's just going to be spent and wasted away on
[19:20.040 --> 19:24.400]  more government programs and then two years down the road the government will
[19:24.400 --> 19:29.880]  be broke again and then they'll say guess what we're broke again and if you
[19:29.880 --> 19:34.080]  don't give us another couple of trillion dollars in taxes we're not going to be
[19:34.080 --> 19:37.880]  able to pay our way so it's one emergency after another they keep
[19:37.880 --> 19:42.240]  milking us for more and more dollars as the government remains in a state of
[19:42.240 --> 19:45.760]  bankruptcy stay with us here on the other side we'll be talking about Julie

[24:12.880 --> 24:16.480]  your host today Mike Adams the health ranger editor of natural news and
[24:16.480 --> 24:20.920]  frequent contributor to info wars.com on issues like health freedom and GMOs
[24:20.920 --> 24:25.120]  many others we've been talking about the debt ceiling in the last segment and
[24:25.120 --> 24:31.040]  I've got some freaky news for you here today 15 examples that show many
[24:31.040 --> 24:36.600]  Americans have become desperate and they will do just about anything for money
[24:36.600 --> 24:41.520]  this is from the economic collapse and this is posted on info wars as well
[24:41.520 --> 24:46.200]  check this out you're not gonna believe this in Utah a 28-year-old man is
[24:46.200 --> 24:52.840]  offering to be hunted he's offering to be human prey for hunters for the bargain
[24:52.840 --> 24:58.840]  price of ten thousand dollars hmm and for an additional two grand he says he
[24:58.840 --> 25:04.000]  will run around naked I don't understand why is that an extra fee that
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.120]  should be a penalty and I'm not sure that that there's a big market for that
[25:09.120 --> 25:13.640]  kind of hunting going on but it just shows how desperate people are wow the
[25:13.640 --> 25:17.160]  Huffington Post is reporting that there's an epidemic of air conditioning
[25:17.160 --> 25:22.440]  thefts all across the country remember remember when they used to steal the
[25:22.440 --> 25:25.960]  air conditioning for the air conditioning unit now they're just stealing it
[25:25.960 --> 25:31.400]  for the copper in it you've got thieves all across the country bringing down the
[25:31.400 --> 25:35.320]  power grid in local communities just because they want to steal the copper
[25:35.320 --> 25:41.680]  wire no kidding coppers going sky high and alongside that by the way this whole
[25:41.680 --> 25:47.560]  issue of minerals that you've got to mine out of planet earth these minerals
[25:47.560 --> 25:51.120]  are going to be in very short supply in the years ahead especially the rare
[25:51.120 --> 25:55.960]  earth minerals rare earths they're mined out of the dirtiest mines you can
[25:55.960 --> 26:01.280]  imagine in China for the most part China controls the vast majority of the
[26:01.280 --> 26:06.920]  global supply of these rare earth metals and these are used in solar panels
[26:06.920 --> 26:13.120]  these are used in wind turbines these are used in electric motors these the
[26:13.120 --> 26:17.920]  the metals and minerals that are the dirtiest mined metals in the world these
[26:17.920 --> 26:22.560]  are used in all the so-called green energy devices isn't that interesting
[26:22.560 --> 26:28.120]  there's a dark side of green when you get into the mines that we don't often
[26:28.120 --> 26:32.680]  talk about I'm not saying solar's bad I mean I use solar panels I'm not saying
[26:32.680 --> 26:36.560]  wind is bad wind is good wind energy is good it's clean but there is a supply
[26:36.560 --> 26:42.520]  line issue it does depend on these rare earths that come from China but getting
[26:42.520 --> 26:46.120]  back getting back to the financial desperation of the American people in
[26:46.120 --> 26:51.960]  Corpus Christi Texas thieves have been breaking in the funeral homes to steal
[26:51.960 --> 26:58.680]  embalming fluid if you can believe that who who goes in to steal embalming fluid
[26:58.680 --> 27:02.280]  can't they just drink a lot of diet soda if they wanted if they wanted that
[27:02.280 --> 27:06.640]  there's formaldehyde that comes out of something breaking down of aspartame
[27:06.640 --> 27:11.240]  there so stealing stealing embalming fluid doesn't make any sense police
[27:11.240 --> 27:18.240]  officers one Chicago police officer stole $50,000 from his elderly father to
[27:18.240 --> 27:24.400]  pay office bills and gambling debts that's that's too bad nothing is off
[27:24.400 --> 27:28.560]  limits these days criminals recently broke into a beauty supply store and
[27:28.560 --> 27:34.960]  stole $30,000 worth of hair extensions probably a special on those on ebay
[27:34.960 --> 27:40.800]  right as we speak look the bottom line is that that the desperation is growing
[27:40.800 --> 27:46.120]  out there people are losing their jobs because the economy is in a scheduled
[27:46.120 --> 27:52.360]  engineered implosion it's collapsing by design it's designed to make people
[27:52.360 --> 27:55.720]  desperate to put people on the streets to put people on the government payroll
[27:55.720 --> 27:59.280]  to put them on unemployment benefits and food stamps because that's where people
[27:59.280 --> 28:04.000]  are easier to control and the idea that individuals and entrepreneurs could go
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.280]  out and start their own businesses and have a successful business that's being
[28:07.280 --> 28:12.360]  suppressed by things like Obamacare right where the big corporations that
[28:12.360 --> 28:16.440]  have the inside track with big government oh they get they get the
[28:16.440 --> 28:19.600]  waivers don't worry if you're a McDonald's or some of these other
[28:19.600 --> 28:23.480]  companies you don't have to buy insurance for your employees but if you're an
[28:23.480 --> 28:28.080]  individual entrepreneur trying to create jobs in America and do something
[28:28.080 --> 28:34.360]  innovative you are punished you are financially called to task by the
[28:34.360 --> 28:38.640]  government this is what's happening in America today the regulatory environment
[28:38.640 --> 28:43.440]  is so oppressive and even in the health area we've talked about this a lot that
[28:43.440 --> 28:48.040]  the cancer cures that really work all those clinics are chased out of the
[28:48.040 --> 28:51.880]  country that's why the cancer clinics that you go to today that really do the
[28:51.880 --> 28:55.440]  job they're in Mexico or the Cayman Islands or other places they're not
[28:55.440 --> 28:59.520]  allowed in America why not because they don't want people cured of cancer in
[28:59.520 --> 29:03.960]  America and they don't want the cancer clinics to be successful in America we
[29:03.960 --> 29:08.760]  could revitalize this country with health freedom in fact in the third hour today
[29:08.760 --> 29:15.000]  we are going to have Jonathan E. Mord on to talk about that in more detail he is
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.560]  a really amazing health freedom attorney probably know him he's been on the
[29:18.560 --> 29:22.400]  show several times he's gonna break that down for us the bottom line is they're
[29:22.400 --> 29:27.480]  trying to destroy us they're trying to get our economy back down to almost zero
[29:27.480 --> 29:34.600]  because it creates desperation because it creates a wage slave system stay with
[29:34.600 --> 29:38.200]  us we're coming back with Julie Bass from Oak Park Michigan this is the Alex

[33:40.480 --> 33:42.960]  you Julie Bass here let me give you a little bit of background about this
[33:42.960 --> 33:47.840]  situation in case you're not familiar with it Julie Bass is being threatened
[33:47.840 --> 33:56.120]  with up to 93 days of jail time for the amazing crime the crime of planting a
[33:56.120 --> 34:02.280]  vegetable garden in her own front yard yeah we've got we've been covering this
[34:02.280 --> 34:07.360]  on natural news and info wars dot com has articles on this as well this is real
[34:07.360 --> 34:10.800]  this is really happening in America today the bureaucrats are out of control
[34:10.800 --> 34:16.400]  with suppressing food freedom it's not just the food safety bill from last year
[34:16.400 --> 34:21.320]  remember Senate bill 510 food safety modernization act that allowed the FDA
[34:21.320 --> 34:26.680]  to come in and inspect small greenhouses and small farms and required loads of
[34:26.680 --> 34:31.240]  paperwork just to be able to sell your own food to your own neighbors now
[34:31.240 --> 34:37.120]  they're getting they're suppressing the actual farms themselves and they're
[34:37.120 --> 34:42.040]  going after front yard gardeners like Julie Bass so we're gonna be talking to
[34:42.040 --> 34:48.800]  Julie but in Oak Park Oak Park Michigan they have a regulation that says that
[34:48.800 --> 34:53.360]  front yards have to be planted with either pavement they're okay with pavement
[34:53.360 --> 34:56.400]  you can just pave your whole yard they'd be fine with that how beautiful would
[34:56.400 --> 35:02.160]  that be or you have to use quote suitable live plant material suitable
[35:02.160 --> 35:07.040]  that's the key operative word here what is suitable live plant material now
[35:07.040 --> 35:11.800]  Julie Bass who'll be joining us here in a minute she says what's suitable is a
[35:11.800 --> 35:16.840]  garden what could be more suitable it's food it's organic food it's good for you
[35:16.840 --> 35:20.320]  it prevents cancer you can teach your children how to garden how wonderful is
[35:20.320 --> 35:23.720]  that it's local food it's good for the environment it's good for your health
[35:23.720 --> 35:26.880]  it's good for everybody's good for the air in the city makes the city a more
[35:26.880 --> 35:33.720]  beautiful place but Kevin Rulkowski the city planner from Oak Park Michigan he
[35:33.720 --> 35:38.920]  has some strange dictionary from Mars and in that dictionary he says suitable
[35:38.920 --> 35:43.360]  means common he quotes Webster's dictionary that's not in Webster's
[35:43.360 --> 35:49.240]  dictionary suitable doesn't mean common suitable means appropriate like it's an
[35:49.240 --> 35:54.840]  appropriate garden or an appropriate live plant for your front yard and now
[35:54.840 --> 35:58.000]  it's not just Kevin it's also the neighbors these whiny neighbors that
[35:58.000 --> 36:03.680]  complain about people like Julie these neighbors they they have nothing to do
[36:03.680 --> 36:08.760]  they're pathetic all they do is look over the fence and complain about somebody
[36:08.760 --> 36:14.200]  next door doing something that they don't like it's it's it's just unbelievable
[36:14.200 --> 36:20.880]  anyway joining us today to talk about this is Julie Bass Julie are you with
[36:20.880 --> 36:29.400]  us can you hear us Julie okay awesome thanks for joining us today can you
[36:29.400 --> 36:34.560]  break this down for our listeners who may not be familiar with the situation I
[36:34.560 --> 36:39.080]  gave the intro there but did I leave anything out give us the rundown of
[36:39.080 --> 36:42.960]  what's going on I think you had a pretty good summary the only thing I do want
[36:42.960 --> 36:47.440]  to crack is my neighbors are actually awesome my neighbors are super and
[36:47.440 --> 36:51.480]  they're supportive and they're friendly and our neighborhood is really close to
[36:51.480 --> 36:56.240]  it and our neighbors have really been terrific so it's not any you know bad
[36:56.240 --> 37:01.240]  whiny neighbor or anything that's great to hear well who called who called the
[37:01.240 --> 37:06.120]  city and and had them dispatch the enforcement officers who is that so we
[37:06.120 --> 37:09.440]  don't know that anyone actually even did call the city if they were just
[37:09.440 --> 37:14.080]  driving by what we were told originally by the code enforcement person was that
[37:14.080 --> 37:17.920]  he was following up since I've spoken to the technical and planning director
[37:17.920 --> 37:22.000]  Kevin O'Callke as he pointed out I've spoken to him about what we wanted to do
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.800]  and we went back and forth about whether he could find anything or not and the
[37:26.800 --> 37:31.480]  planning director told me that he couldn't find anything about vegetables
[37:31.480 --> 37:34.320]  specifically or gardens specifically but he knew you could use decorative
[37:34.320 --> 37:38.680]  planting but he would keep talking about the vegetables so we went ahead and did
[37:38.680 --> 37:43.480]  decorative planting meanwhile and then the code enforcement person came and he
[37:43.480 --> 37:48.240]  said he was following off with us from my conversation as a planning official so
[37:48.240 --> 37:51.800]  it could be you know people have said oh you process on yourself by trying to ask
[37:51.800 --> 37:55.000]  permission but you know we were just trying to go through the proper channels
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.720]  and do the right thing and I'm not really sure why the city is coming down
[37:58.720 --> 38:03.400]  enough well what would they say if you planted decorative cabbages you know that
[38:03.400 --> 38:08.400]  the colorful cabbages that that you see used in cities as decorative plants
[38:08.400 --> 38:11.880]  they're edible they could be you know your cabbage salad or whatever coleslaw
[38:11.880 --> 38:15.800]  yeah so we actually have I mean things are out there flowering we've got the
[38:15.800 --> 38:20.280]  skinny flowering and tomato flowering and cucumber flowering they don't really
[38:20.280 --> 38:25.360]  care whether it's pretty or not pretty at this point they have cited the
[38:25.360 --> 38:29.880]  vegetables in the warning they very clearly wrote in no vegetables in front
[38:29.880 --> 38:34.320]  yard space must be low paid and then the actual ticket what they cited us for
[38:34.320 --> 38:38.400]  even though the language says other you know has the other physical life
[38:38.400 --> 38:43.600]  material what they actually wrote on our citation is vegetables in front yard
[38:43.600 --> 38:47.640]  and that's what the misdemeanor charges but that's not in the regulations even
[38:47.640 --> 38:50.440]  for the city they don't have anything against vegetables written in there they
[38:50.440 --> 38:54.960]  just say suitable live plant material right exactly how do they get to being
[38:54.960 --> 38:59.040]  anti-vegetable you know I don't know maybe Kevin Rokofsky had some really
[38:59.040 --> 39:03.160]  traumatic childhood experience with a broccoli or something somebody you know
[39:03.160 --> 39:08.000]  got hit in the head with a tomato I'm not sure but they they have decided that
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.560]  suitable means not vegetables all right so so in their minds so they're they're
[39:13.560 --> 39:18.680]  making a subjective decision of what they think is beautiful what what if the
[39:18.680 --> 39:24.720]  city passes a code that says you can't wear non-beautiful shirts yeah so we
[39:24.720 --> 39:27.520]  probably get ticketed for that as well because I don't know if Kevin Rokofsky
[39:27.520 --> 39:32.400]  is the same case as I do in Wardrobe or exactly yeah it that's exactly the
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.680]  problem is these very ambiguous you know code things and then they expect people
[39:36.680 --> 39:40.760]  to follow code but nobody really knows exactly what they mean so it leaves the
[39:40.760 --> 39:44.680]  city room to just harass you at will if they decide that they have something
[39:44.680 --> 39:51.960]  against you now were you aware of how much tyranny is present in even local
[39:51.960 --> 39:55.240]  government before this happened I mean did you follow anything about what's
[39:55.240 --> 39:58.440]  happening with the government and our freedoms and our rights or did all of
[39:58.440 --> 40:02.600]  this just sort of happen for you spontaneously out of this gardening
[40:02.600 --> 40:05.840]  situation you know I follow politics and a general
[40:05.840 --> 40:13.160]  sense I have some sense of what the federal government is doing on a local level though especially a little city like Oak Park we've
[40:13.160 --> 40:16.840]  always had very friendly relations with everybody we wave at the police when they
[40:16.840 --> 40:21.640]  drive by you know everybody smiles everybody's polite it's very very small
[40:21.640 --> 40:26.200]  town Midwest so to have something like this we're just trying to do this ugly
[40:26.200 --> 40:31.200]  ugly mess that's something I never ever would have anticipated yeah and you just
[40:31.200 --> 40:34.480]  in your defense too you weren't trying to make a big national issue of this I
[40:34.480 --> 40:40.000]  this this sort of exploded outside of your control right yeah we actually were
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.960]  I mean like I said we call the city before we did anything we tried to be a
[40:43.960 --> 40:46.920]  hundred percent in compliance with what they told us originally which was
[40:46.920 --> 40:51.480]  decorative plantings are allowed never a mention of the nuts and vegetables in
[40:51.480 --> 40:54.720]  fact we specifically asked about vegetables and he said he couldn't find
[40:54.720 --> 40:59.760]  anything so we thought we were just doing what we had permission to do we never
[40:59.760 --> 41:04.360]  expected this to become a gigantic huge you know a polarizing issue for people
[41:04.360 --> 41:07.880]  like it is and now you're getting national coverage not just here on the
[41:07.880 --> 41:11.800]  Alex Jones show but other media sources have been talking to you right can you
[41:11.800 --> 41:16.400]  give us a sense of how how big this story has become we're getting people
[41:16.400 --> 41:22.960]  commenting on the blog from Australia from Tunisia from England from other places
[41:22.960 --> 41:27.520]  in Africa we've had people from New Zealand writing in for support we've had
[41:27.520 --> 41:31.720]  people from Scandinavia what about the US media are they covering this they
[41:31.720 --> 41:35.800]  really are we're getting calls every day my kids are joking that you know they're
[41:35.800 --> 41:39.240]  fighting over who gets to be the secretary next and take messages but
[41:39.240 --> 41:43.480]  pretty much every single day now is juggling between doing interviews
[41:43.480 --> 41:48.200]  taking phone calls responding to emails going on different shows that you know
[41:48.200 --> 41:52.680]  people really a lot of people are invested in this issue from different
[41:52.680 --> 41:56.280]  standpoints you know we've got the gardening people and the sustainability
[41:56.280 --> 42:00.600]  people and the water conservation people and the environmental people and the
[42:00.600 --> 42:05.400]  freedom people and you know everyone sees part of their own issue encapsulated
[42:05.400 --> 42:08.640]  in what we're doing right isn't that cool and by the way you're really well
[42:08.640 --> 42:14.200]  spoken Julie and I hope that you realize what an important role you are now
[42:14.200 --> 42:18.320]  playing in the food freedom movement and I think that's the key issue it could
[42:18.320 --> 42:22.360]  be could be environment it could be local food but food freedom is really a
[42:22.360 --> 42:26.000]  big a big part of it but you're doing a great job and can you give out your
[42:26.000 --> 42:34.480]  blog address so people can stay informed about you? Sure it's oakparkhatesveggies.wordpress.com
[42:34.480 --> 42:38.480]  Let me repeat that oakparkhatesveggies.wordpress.com
[42:38.480 --> 42:42.640]  maybe we can bring that up for the prisonplan.tv viewers but you're doing a
[42:42.640 --> 42:45.840]  great job Julie and I'm really glad that you found the courage to just stand up
[42:45.840 --> 42:50.480]  and and speak out on your truth you are you going to take this to a different
[42:50.480 --> 42:54.840]  level now maybe do public speaking maybe maybe write a book about it what
[42:54.840 --> 42:58.880]  what's your plan my plan is to give my kids a lot more attention than they've
[42:58.880 --> 43:03.520]  been getting my plan is to try to you know do some homemade baked goods to the
[43:03.520 --> 43:08.320]  kids stop eating junk food my plan is really just to put my life back together
[43:08.320 --> 43:11.920]  as soon as the city takes the pressure off I'm happy to go back to just being
[43:11.920 --> 43:17.600]  regular suburban mom now in the meantime you are still facing a court date yes
[43:17.600 --> 43:23.760]  you are facing potentially 90 is it 93 days in jail mm-hmm that still hangs
[43:23.760 --> 43:29.160]  over your head is there any indication that the Oak Park City officials are
[43:29.160 --> 43:35.160]  going to back off of this are they just driving it out of ego now well I did
[43:35.160 --> 43:39.680]  read something from another source I can't remember where but the mayor did
[43:39.680 --> 43:45.000]  tell somebody he doesn't want me to do jail time which is really nice and
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.200]  really sweet I don't know if the mayor actually has anything directly to do with
[43:48.200 --> 43:51.080]  the court system or not it's my understanding that it's not for branches
[43:51.080 --> 43:55.000]  of government but you know at least it was nice to make that statement so I
[43:55.000 --> 43:58.840]  can say here's one more person who wants me to stay out of jail well what an
[43:58.840 --> 44:01.880]  incredible idea I mean maybe the mayor is on your side I don't know where your
[44:01.880 --> 44:05.720]  mayor stands on this issue but just to make that statement to say we don't
[44:05.720 --> 44:09.920]  want you to have jail time because you're facing I mean jail is taking away
[44:09.920 --> 44:14.120]  all of your rights jail is a place where you have no bill of rights right you
[44:14.120 --> 44:16.800]  don't have freedom of speech you don't have freedom of movement you don't even
[44:16.800 --> 44:21.360]  I mean your garden would die yeah out of neglect and that would make it look even
[44:21.360 --> 44:24.920]  worse which would make the city look worse how do they think throwing you in
[44:24.920 --> 44:29.880]  jail is going to help Oak Park look better you know I think that at first
[44:29.880 --> 44:33.400]  it happened so quickly they didn't really think about having a park look
[44:33.400 --> 44:37.320]  better I think they just were very focused on trying to bully me it's taking
[44:37.320 --> 44:40.040]  regard in the way and trying to intimidate me and you know when the
[44:40.040 --> 44:43.480]  warning didn't didn't work then they issued the citation and when the
[44:43.480 --> 44:47.200]  citation didn't work we had the court date and when the court date didn't work
[44:47.200 --> 44:52.720]  they said you know it's the misdemeanor and there's the jail time attached so
[44:52.720 --> 44:58.240]  they keep kind of bumping up the stakes of things I think just to get us to be
[44:58.240 --> 45:02.080]  quiet and stop talking to the media and to just be intimidated and go along a
[45:02.080 --> 45:06.040]  way but you wouldn't back down yeah unfortunately I've been taught to stand
[45:06.040 --> 45:09.400]  up to bullies and that's what we're trying to do good for you and by the way
[45:09.400 --> 45:13.960]  I remember Kevin Rulkowski saying I think on a Fox interview he said he was
[45:13.960 --> 45:17.560]  saying that you asked for the trial it's all your fault you asked for the
[45:17.560 --> 45:22.120]  trial what an incredible spin can you explain that I'm sure I mean when we
[45:22.120 --> 45:25.480]  were in court and the judge was explaining that in most communities
[45:25.480 --> 45:28.880]  what we're doing would only be an ordinance violation but in Oak Park it
[45:28.880 --> 45:32.920]  actually is a misdemeanor where we're going to need to have a trial and she's
[45:32.920 --> 45:35.560]  not we could either have a trial in front of just the judge or we can have a
[45:35.560 --> 45:40.600]  trial by jury and I said okay well take the jury please and they've they've
[45:40.600 --> 45:44.000]  turned that into me asking you know like somehow I went and knocked on the
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.520]  courthouse door and said hey could you guys take me to trial for something could
[45:47.520 --> 45:51.280]  you guys you know give me a trial I really want to be persecuted by the
[45:51.280 --> 45:56.080]  city I don't have enough to do so it's kind of absurd but well that's what he
[45:56.080 --> 45:58.560]  makes it sound like he makes it sound like you're the one who wanted to go to
[45:58.560 --> 46:03.960]  trial how dare you how dare you not give in to our regulatory enforcement you
[46:03.960 --> 46:08.080]  should take our deal and and put your head down and kiss our boots and walk
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.320]  away and stop asking for a trial by your peers right pretty much I mean I don't
[46:12.320 --> 46:16.280]  even know how they could credibly spin it so that you know I don't know how a
[46:16.280 --> 46:21.040]  citizen would just go to the court and ask for a trial about nothing you know
[46:21.040 --> 46:25.320]  the city has to excuse the city has to bring charges the city has to initiate
[46:25.320 --> 46:29.880]  all of the actions and yeah we're not doing too much boo-kissing so I guess
[46:29.880 --> 46:34.800]  that's really making them upset I guess it is do you have any idea how many
[46:34.800 --> 46:39.640]  emails or phone calls the city planners office of Oak Park has been receiving
[46:39.640 --> 46:43.720]  we've had some word of that but maybe you have more inside information I know
[46:43.720 --> 46:47.280]  on one of the days that the media spoke to them somebody said that they had
[46:47.280 --> 46:51.800]  received 2000 phone calls I know that they're getting thousands of emails I
[46:51.800 --> 46:55.960]  know that for a time their email system was just bouncing back emails it wasn't
[46:55.960 --> 47:00.480]  even accepting any new emails I know that the phone system is either a lot of
[47:00.480 --> 47:04.520]  times busy or off the hook people can't get through and we had a friend who
[47:04.520 --> 47:08.360]  went into City Hall and it was the secretaries just the big mayor and they
[47:08.360 --> 47:12.040]  said all the officials were behind closed doors not talking to anybody and
[47:12.040 --> 47:16.080]  they said that the secretary should just deal with it so you know if you want to
[47:16.080 --> 47:18.640]  do something they should send some cupcakes to the secretaries or something
[47:18.640 --> 47:23.320]  for trying to do such a great job in the face of so much publicity yeah well
[47:23.320 --> 47:25.880]  isn't it interesting the city officials now that they're circling the wagon
[47:25.880 --> 47:30.320]  shutting the doors it's all going to be conversations in secret they're still
[47:30.320 --> 47:34.880]  plotting against you you know if they had any sense of public relations I mean
[47:34.880 --> 47:40.280]  if they had any experience at all they would issue an apology they would back
[47:40.280 --> 47:45.760]  down and they would make this a non-news issue and it would fade away in 24
[47:45.760 --> 47:57.480]  hours
[47:57.480 --> 48:04.040]  and come on really if the city hadn't been pushing this pushing this at every
[48:04.040 --> 48:07.600]  step of the way and adding fuel to the fire this would all have gone away my
[48:07.600 --> 48:10.760]  neighbors would just be helping us in the garden we would just be eating fresh
[48:10.760 --> 48:15.080]  vegetables and everyone would be happy so it's really been a city the entire
[48:15.080 --> 48:18.160]  time that's right the city is pushing this agenda and and they're angry that
[48:18.160 --> 48:20.720]  you didn't give in and now they're going to try to prove that they're in
[48:20.720 --> 48:25.480]  control right you know how dare you stand up to their regulatory rules which
[48:25.480 --> 48:28.840]  aren't even rules it's not even written that you can't have vegetables they're
[48:28.840 --> 48:32.840]  just making this up they're making it up as I really like people to remember you
[48:32.840 --> 48:36.800]  know when when they're debating the correctness or the wrongness or anything
[48:36.800 --> 48:41.960]  it's just that there's actually no rule that I'm violating there's nothing that I
[48:41.960 --> 48:46.040]  set out to do wrong it wasn't meant to be an act of civil disobedience their own
[48:46.040 --> 48:50.360]  rules really don't say anything about what I'm doing that would be in violation
[48:50.360 --> 48:54.640]  well and this is this is going to be I think a national issue and those of you
[48:54.640 --> 48:59.320]  listening today I encourage you grow your own food grow it in your backyard if
[48:59.320 --> 49:03.320]  you want but grow it in your front yard if you want make a statement grow what
[49:03.320 --> 49:08.360]  we used to call victory gardens yeah exercise food freedom you remember that
[49:08.360 --> 49:14.000]  I mean you've heard of those right yeah so I thought about it and now I've had
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.840]  I have a very elderly neighbor who came down the block when we first planted it
[49:18.840 --> 49:23.120]  she just got this huge smile and she said this reminds me of the victory garden
[49:23.120 --> 49:27.280]  when I was growing up this is so great and she was like almost crying she was
[49:27.280 --> 49:31.920]  so touched and she was so excited so yeah a lot of people from Sun has said
[49:31.920 --> 49:36.280]  this is a victory garden you should call it a victory garden and I'm hoping
[49:36.280 --> 49:38.760]  that that's what it's gonna end up being hoping it's gonna be a garden that
[49:38.760 --> 49:42.720]  symbolizes victory you know what you you should I I mean I think call it a
[49:42.720 --> 49:46.480]  victory garden call it a food freedom garden make make make the point even
[49:46.480 --> 49:50.920]  even stronger okay and I'm curious by the way do you practice or get organic
[49:50.920 --> 49:55.280]  gardening techniques or is it a convention it's all organic huh good for
[49:55.280 --> 49:59.280]  you and you and you're teaching your kids how to garden yeah absolutely well
[49:59.280 --> 50:02.320]  that's not allowed in America you can't teach children anything that's not on
[50:02.320 --> 50:06.320]  the official agenda yeah apparently this is a real controversial thing you know it's a
[50:06.320 --> 50:10.120]  they could feed and plant it and then water it just I don't know where will the
[50:10.120 --> 50:14.640]  madness end oh yeah you know what they don't want kids learning that stuff
[50:14.640 --> 50:18.200]  because then they might have their own independent food supply and they wouldn't
[50:18.200 --> 50:23.120]  be dependent on government food stamps pretty much yep that's that's the
[50:23.120 --> 50:26.880]  issue yeah now also for those who want to take action who are listening to this
[50:26.880 --> 50:30.080]  because a lot of people want to help you out and and be in support should they
[50:30.080 --> 50:35.240]  keep calling Oak Park or is it or is it just too much now um I really have no
[50:35.240 --> 50:39.040]  sense of whether it's too much not enough I know this is a petition online

[54:07.800 --> 54:12.240]  Jones show thanks for joining us today a Mike Adams health ranger filling in for
[54:12.240 --> 54:17.880]  Alex we work on another projects today as he's a workaholic like me yeah we all
[54:17.880 --> 54:23.020]  are and we're joined today by Julie Bass she is joining us by phone she's the
[54:23.020 --> 54:28.720]  woman from Oak Park Michigan threatened with 93 days of jail time for growing a
[54:28.720 --> 54:34.440]  victory garden in her own front yard now Julie Julie what what's the court date
[54:34.440 --> 54:38.480]  and are you going to be able to keep us informed along the way here because we
[54:38.480 --> 54:42.560]  want to cover your story and find out where this is headed so our next court
[54:42.560 --> 54:48.520]  date is July 26th that's going to be a pre-trial and I'm pretty diligent about
[54:48.520 --> 54:51.400]  updating the blog anytime there's anything to report or anytime there's
[54:51.400 --> 54:55.520]  something you know that's happening new I try to put it pretty soon on the blog
[54:55.520 --> 54:59.000]  so you know if people want to follow what's going on they're welcome to check
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.000]  in I know there's also a Facebook page that my friend started and that's just
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.960]  gone crazy I hear that there are thousands of people on there all the
[55:06.960 --> 55:11.640]  time what's that what's the Facebook tag for that I'm not sure I know that my
[55:11.640 --> 55:15.280]  husband put a link to it on the right side of the blog okay really though I
[55:15.280 --> 55:17.600]  guess the source for official information would kind of be the blog
[55:17.600 --> 55:21.400]  because that's me writing so that anything that's there you know it's actually
[55:21.400 --> 55:25.200]  truthful and has been you know people can say whatever they want on Facebook but
[55:25.200 --> 55:29.920]  my blog is actually me okay that's oak park hates veggies that word press yeah
[55:29.920 --> 55:33.040]  right calm you know the way they're treating you it's almost like they
[55:33.040 --> 55:36.680]  think are growing marijuana in your front yard or something isn't it I think
[55:36.680 --> 55:40.520]  actually in Michigan it's legal now to grow a certain amount of marijuana
[55:40.520 --> 55:44.800]  so could be we'd have an easier time if we just switch over to a marijuana garden
[55:44.800 --> 55:49.600]  that's it that's it dig up the tomatoes plant pot right and the city will leave
[55:49.600 --> 55:54.440]  you alone right and you know my kids might be a little more mellow so wow oh
[55:54.440 --> 55:59.920]  man what what is what is our country coming to now are you gonna actually
[55:59.920 --> 56:03.520]  make something special out of these freedom tomatoes that you're growing I
[56:03.520 --> 56:07.840]  mean you could sell tomato paste on eBay for like 500 bucks of jars and now
[56:07.840 --> 56:12.320]  because they're famous tomatoes yeah my son kind of joked about that and I sort
[56:12.320 --> 56:17.480]  of I'm just so in disbelief this is also surreal to me at this point you know
[56:17.480 --> 56:21.040]  I'm hoping that we're able to grow enough so that my kids can just have some
[56:21.040 --> 56:24.960]  and if we have extra we can share with the neighbors and I've never really had
[56:24.960 --> 56:29.360]  a garden before so I don't I think have a concept of how much produce I'm
[56:29.360 --> 56:32.760]  actually going to get out of the garden this is your first garden this is I
[56:32.760 --> 56:36.760]  mean we had last year a few little planter boxes but yeah this is the
[56:36.760 --> 56:40.960]  first time which I jokingly my husband after we put it out in front you know
[56:40.960 --> 56:43.960]  this has been a bad idea because if we kill everything it's gonna be a pretty
[56:43.960 --> 56:47.800]  public failure you know here's the thing the food prices are skyrocketing
[56:47.800 --> 56:51.560]  across not just the country but around the world right because we have these
[56:51.560 --> 56:55.120]  droughts we have the floods we have the the crazy weather radical things
[56:55.120 --> 56:58.840]  happening all over the planet right prices are going up and you what you
[56:58.840 --> 57:02.600]  are growing your you could probably grow five hundred a thousand dollars worth
[57:02.600 --> 57:06.360]  of vegetables in your own front yard I sure hope so man if that happens I would
[57:06.360 --> 57:09.800]  be one of the happiest people I would be so pleasantly surprised that would be
[57:09.800 --> 57:14.120]  fantastic I mean this is such a solution for people people who are on food
[57:14.120 --> 57:18.760]  stamps they could go out and grow half of their food needs in their own yard I
[57:18.760 --> 57:22.720]  mean I grow to I grow gardens all the time been doing it for years at one
[57:22.720 --> 57:27.520]  point I was growing 70% of my own diet out of my garden that was that was in
[57:27.520 --> 57:31.600]  South America where the climate was different but look this is a solution
[57:31.600 --> 57:35.120]  for people so why why wouldn't the city come to you and say Julie you should be
[57:35.120 --> 57:40.520]  our spokesperson for healthy happy cities I think the city is very much
[57:40.520 --> 57:46.040]  trying to stay mired in it you know 1954 mentality somebody actually wrote a
[57:46.040 --> 57:52.320]  really really incorrect article that was on time on their website and basically
[57:52.320 --> 57:56.200]  stressed how but she was positive and she said you know oh park is so into
[57:56.200 --> 57:59.560]  conformity and it's so nice to be there because everything is exactly the same
[57:59.560 --> 58:04.080]  and it's so good to be there because nothing ever changes and I know people
[58:04.080 --> 58:08.080]  commented like oh that's like a separate town you know that oh yeah we drive down
[58:08.080 --> 58:10.800]  the road you don't even know what road you're on cuz cuz everything looks
[58:10.800 --> 58:16.200]  exactly the same yeah Julie I'm sorry to cut you off but we're going we're
[58:16.200 --> 58:20.280]  going out to break here I want to thank you for joining us you're welcome thank

[58:43.200 --> 58:51.480]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is alex jones with
[58:51.480 --> 58:55.240]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.240 --> 58:59.000]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.000 --> 59:03.520]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.520 --> 59:07.720]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:07.720 --> 59:12.360]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.360 --> 59:16.360]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[59:16.360 --> 59:20.480]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[59:20.480 --> 59:24.440]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[59:24.440 --> 59:28.600]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[59:28.600 --> 59:32.400]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[59:32.400 --> 59:35.880]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:35.680]  health ranger editor of natural news filling in for alex today and we have
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.680]  Paul Joseph Watson joining us during this half hour and at the bottom of the
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.800]  hour going to be joined by Jeffrey Smith with a GMO update that's going to be
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:52.280]  very interesting and Paul Watson as you know one of the best investigative
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:58.360]  writers out there on the front lines of the freedom movement constant
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:04.360]  contributor to prisonplanet.com and infowars.com mr. Watson are you with
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:08.760]  us right now yes Mike good good to be back on the air with you today
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.600]  ah good good to be with you too man always always great to banter with you
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.480]  and chat with you here I understand you're going to be bringing us some
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:22.240]  information updates about the war in Libya today that's right Mike it appears
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:28.320]  as if we're approaching the endgame in Libya this is kind of floating under the
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:34.400]  radar today what with all the debt news and the economic fallout going on but
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:40.640]  basically where they're either going to see Colonel Gaddafi step down or see
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:45.560]  it triply leveled by NATO bombardment and this is something that's going to
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:51.720]  happen within weeks rather than months so I want to give a pretty big update on
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:56.600]  the situation there at the moment all right I want to ask you more details
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.360]  about that on the other side of this break as well because you know not not all
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:05.400]  the radio affiliates carry carry this segment but it sounds like the details
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:09.520]  here are getting pretty pretty gruesome and this is still all taking place in a
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:16.120]  context of not war somehow this is not war how does that work well exactly I
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:20.640]  mean that's the arrogance with which the Obama administration has pursued this
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:26.640]  campaign by labeling it a kinetic military action and not a war which is
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:32.640]  kind of in conflict to the fact that over 800 there have been over 800 bombing
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:39.040]  runs involved in US warplanes now according to Libyan another third party
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:44.160]  authorities over a thousand civilians killed obviously those numbers are
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:48.480]  highly dispute on either side but for sure there have been civilian deaths in
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:54.520]  the past few weeks we've had bombings of universities hospitals and apartment
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.640]  buildings and all those have been confirmed NATO had to admit to the
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:03.960]  fact that in those three cases the bombs the smart bombs had gone astray and
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:08.000]  civilians had been killed basically what's happening now certainly in
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.480]  Europe and as you've seen over the past couple of days in the US the debt
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.920]  situation is so out of control that basically there's no money to fund this
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:22.200]  anymore Obama said it would be days not weeks we're now nearly four months into
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:27.680]  it and the Pentagon basically has run out of ideas on how to creatively fiddle
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:32.720]  the accounts to move money to pay for all these bombs and these these bombing
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:37.880]  missions so the the NATO forces are completely exhausted and they're having
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:44.440]  to settle for second best which is this kind of second choice Gaddafi step down
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:50.120]  whereby his government would maintain a lot of influence in the country so when
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:54.840]  we come back I just want to go over the fact that this is now in the works and
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.200]  it's basically going to be imminent but it could still go the other way
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:03.440]  Gaddafi can still still change his mind yeah very volatile situation and you
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.880]  got to love the word games that the administration is playing with all of
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:13.960]  this like you said days not weeks days but it's been months and to talk about
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.760]  kinetic action well you know here's an example this is kinetic action I'm
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.760]  holding a pen that's kinetic action when I drop a pen kinetic action is
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:27.600]  something small and simple like that not war that's something very very different
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.360]  the word games are out of control especially with the debt ceiling now
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:34.800]  approaching seems like they're getting desperate Paul now I know we're going to
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.000]  break here on the other side of this Paul Joseph Watson will break this down in
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.720]  far more detail the situation in Libya and the endgame strategy that's coming
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:50.520]  our way stay with us here on the Alex Jones show
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.920]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:11.360]  is our last chance to not relive history is it finishing off this agenda that
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.480]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this influence on our
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.680]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:25.960]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:31.080]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:35.440]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.640]  Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.320]  Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:49.320]  care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic yet
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:54.640]  your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching

[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:09.040]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:15.760]  welcome back folks Mike Adams here filling in for alex jones today and we
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:21.760]  are talking with Paul joseph Watson about the situation in libya and Paul
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:27.600]  before the break we're giving us some details can you give us the the rundown
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:35.520]  again the end game plan for libya and this can you comment also on this
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:41.880]  Gaddafi suicide plan for the capital that's being reported in the news yeah
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:47.320]  well basically this is breaking news we're approaching end game in libya and
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:52.480]  it's likely to be weeks not months until this thing's wrapped up the more likely
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.640]  of the two scenarios and this is what's been reported today in shin who are out
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:03.960]  of Chinese news and also debka file is apparently in a bid to save triply from
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:09.560]  basically being completely flattened Gaddafi has agreed to cut a deal which
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:15.640]  is being mediated by the russians and the french to step down from power but
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:20.440]  it comes with a lot of attachments one of which is is that his son has to be
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.520]  involved in the next so-called democratic election and another is the
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.760]  Gaddafi himself wants to avoid extradition obviously because it would
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:35.320]  mean he would be carted off to face the international criminal court so yesterday
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:41.000]  the Obama administration gave the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.240]  permission to broker a deal with Gaddafi that will see him step down as a
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:51.800]  symbolic leader but in the long run it won't eliminate much of his influence
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:58.400]  over the country so basically we have Obama walking away from the Libya war
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.800]  with his tail between his legs you know that as we said before the break the
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.840]  battle of the debt ceiling the imminent downgrading of America's credit status
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.440]  the plunging economy all this has taken precedence and the White House along
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.400]  with NATO is basically having to abandon this one they can't afford to pay for it
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:23.080]  anymore we have the debt crisis again like America reverberating around Europe
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:27.320]  and there's just no money to pay for the fighter jets and the bombs so debka file
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:33.360]  reports today this is their headline the Libyan war ends Obama makes Moscow
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:40.160]  peace broker NATO halts strikes and those sentiments are also being echoed
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.640]  out of shinhua Chinese media with a headline Obama conditionally backs
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:51.760]  political solution to Libya conflict so if Gaddafi follows through on this
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:56.440]  promise to step down then the war is over but as I said before the break if
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.360]  he changes tack and the last you know at the last minute then the outcome is
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:06.680]  going to be very different indeed last month we report the fact that US troops
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:11.760]  are being ready for a ground invasion set to take place in October if Gaddafi
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:18.240]  refused to step down and indeed I report on prisonplanet.com two weeks ago
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:23.080]  the fact that NATO was basically at the end of its tether and ready to launch a
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:28.920]  full-out ground assault again if Gaddafi refused to talk which it appears of it
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:34.800]  as if he's now agreed to do but the bottom line is that Gaddafi is not going
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:40.640]  to allow these rebels or NATO or anyone else to take Tripoli without a fire
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:46.120]  even though the rebels are keen to go in you know they're 50 miles from Tripoli
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:50.880]  they're in the mountainous regions surrounding Tripoli but their funding is
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.760]  simply drying up whereas Gaddafi has these hordes of cash and gold that he
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:01.600]  stored a secreted away for a crisis that when it would enable him to fund his
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.640]  government for the best part of another year but as you just mentioned we now
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:11.080]  have this claim by the special envoy from Russia from the Kremlin Mikhail
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:16.440]  Maragov who says that Gaddafi has promised to line the city with missiles
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:20.960]  and raise it to the ground if it looks like they're going to come in and
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:27.240]  violently topple him so Gaddafi would rather launch a suicide mission than
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:32.040]  surrender to NATO or these rebels militarily do you think so again
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.680]  sorry to rep all of it but do you think that part of what's going through his
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:41.280]  mind I mean you notice that Gaddafi has stored gold not US dollars as his
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.880]  currency of choice do you think part of what's going through his mind is if he
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:52.440]  can hold out long enough to allow the debt crisis in the US to worsen that he's
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.760]  going to have more leverage in all of this is that part of his game plan
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:02.760]  certainly yeah because as we know Libya has six billion dollars worth of gold
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.200]  and that was one of the primary reasons for NATO and the White House going in
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.800]  there in the first place in addition of course to the fact that it's the richest
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.880]  oil country in the whole continent of Africa so yeah Gaddafi has got the
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:21.560]  resources to sit tight and wait this out whereas the rebels and NATO do not and
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:27.400]  in fact it also on the US side of it it was reported last week that the Pentagon
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:32.080]  was trying to ask Congress if it could move money around to cover the debts
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:36.920]  that they've already spent on bombing Libya since March so they're already
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:41.000]  having to get creative with the accounting of course Congress has refused
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.760]  sanctioned funding for the war so whereas NATO and the US and the White
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:49.840]  House of their funds have dried up Gaddafi's got got the resources
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:53.680]  resources to sit tight and he can wait it out for the best part of another year
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:58.640]  yeah well non-war is expensive kinetic action costs money I guess I'm very
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.760]  interesting how that works do you do you think how is the West going to make
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:09.840]  sure that it has its hands in the pie so to speak in Libya after Gaddafi steps
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.720]  down because we always know the West wants to have control of every puppet
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.000]  government that goes in place how are they planning to maintain control over
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.920]  Libya in this situation well obviously they're gonna first have a transitional
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:27.560]  government which is then gonna lead to some so-called democratic elections but
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:32.160]  just as we saw in Iraq and of course in Afghanistan they're just gonna get the
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:37.080]  most loyal mafia bosses that will basically do anything they say and
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.720]  they're gonna try and get them to run and be successful in the election but
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:46.000]  the problem is if Gaddafi still has an influence and if his son is involved in
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.040]  that election then huge numbers of Libyans still support Gaddafi you know
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.600]  some people have said 60% Webster Saab he went over there and recently appeared
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:00.200]  on the Alex Jones show and he said everywhere he went basically they were
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:05.480]  pro-Gaddafi obviously around Tripoli it's more pro-Gaddafi than other areas but
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:10.080]  he's got significant support in the country so if Gaddafi could just get
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:16.280]  his people to run in the elections then he could turn himself into a Vladimir
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:22.240]  Putin style dictator who although isn't symbolically in power is still kind of
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:26.240]  running things from behind the scenes well the last thing the West wants is
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.280]  free and open elections for for Libya right I mean they want controlled
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.520]  elections where they can make sure their candidates get into office and the ones
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:40.400]  they don't want somehow end up losing the elections well exactly which is why
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:44.600]  they need to extradite Gaddafi they need to get him out of the country and in
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:49.760]  front of the ICC so then his whole power structure will inevitably collapse
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.520]  but if he's allowed to remain in the country obviously he's gonna have massive
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:58.080]  control over the aftermath of any transitional government even if he is
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:02.880]  forced to step down but I mean there's there are still people who think they
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.840]  won't step down and that he's too proud to do so which is why we had this report
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:12.600]  a couple of weeks back about NATO planning a final all-out assault a
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.240]  coup d'etat in a bid to topple Gaddafi and they said they already had the
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:22.040]  American the French the British troops on standby so it's certainly not cut and
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:26.160]  dried yet and they could still they could still go for this massive final
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:31.920]  bombardment but it appears as if they've given Gaddafi this ultimatum you
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:36.240]  know either go or we're gonna completely level triply turn it into a car
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:40.880]  park and basically that's what we're gonna see unfold over the next six to
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:45.720]  eight weeks if Gaddafi agrees to go then it will all happen quite peacefully
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.480]  right on the other hand then the next government that goes in will have to
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.880]  borrow money from the World Bank to rebuild its infrastructure and all all
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:00.200]  of that contract money will be awarded to US companies to rebuild so I mean
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.160]  there's almost an incentive to level the city because there's so much money in
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.480]  rebuilding isn't there well yeah exactly and then it'll just turn out like Egypt
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:12.720]  which is now become dependent on a IMF loan so yeah but bear in mind that this
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:18.360]  whole diplomatic solution was Gaddafi's idea he was the one that proposed it in
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:24.640]  early April shortly after the bombardment began but at the time NATO rejected it
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.360]  because they thought you know again days not weeks they thought it would be a
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:33.280]  walk in the park and they would just topple him within a matter of days you
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:37.560]  know three months later it's proven to be the opposite Gaddafi's government has
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:43.160]  held back NATO he's held back these Al Qaeda rebels without deploying a single
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:49.480]  fighter jet or firing a single missile so this represents a complete failure for
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.200]  both NATO and the Obama administration that the outset they claimed it was fit
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:58.920]  for humanitarian purposes and that it had nothing to do with regime change but
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:03.640]  now the only thing that will stop the bombardment on their part is regime
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:08.640]  change and one by one the countries in NATO have abandoned the cause obviously
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:15.400]  a few weeks ago Italy bailed out and basically Obama's gone away with his
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.280]  tail between his legs because now he's so distracted with his debt situation
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:24.640]  he's basically lost the enthusiasm to prosecute this war right and it
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.760]  represents a kind of victory in that sense for Gaddafi this this crucial
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:35.600]  mistake of underestimating the complexity of occupying ground with
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:38.920]  ground forces I mean this is the same mistake that Western nations especially
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:44.480]  the US make again and again in Iraq in Afghanistan in Vietnam going going back
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:50.600]  a few years and today in Libya I mean why why do Western governments have such
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:54.440]  military arrogance where they think they can just press a few buttons knock
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:19:01.160]  off a few bases and just march right in it never works that way I think Mike is
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:05.640]  because they believe their own echo chamber of propaganda they believe that
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:10.520]  you know everything's going to be a cakewalk and that Gaddafi's government
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:14.240]  people would suddenly just abandon him that the army would just stand down and
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:19.200]  flee the whole country and it's not the case the probably the majority of
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.840]  people still support Gaddafi and especially in the stronghold areas that
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:28.200]  is the case Gaddafi's army has the most sophisticated weapons he's got the money
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:33.720]  you know and he's got the moral imperative to hold his ground so the
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:37.280]  fact that they said it would be days not weeks again just shows their arrogance
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.400]  and their stupidity and believe in their own propaganda all right Paul Watson

[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:14.440]  we are talking with Paul Joseph Watson here on the Alice Jones show and the
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:20.080]  fill-in host today Mike Adams the health ranger and Mr. Watson who is really one
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:25.840]  of the best geopolitical analysts out there today in the world is giving us
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:30.640]  a breakdown of the situation in Libya and I know you have some additional
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:35.320]  information but I want to ask you specifically Paul Watson how in your
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:41.600]  view in your analysis is this likely to affect oil prices in the short term but
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:47.000]  and also the oil supply in the long term assuming that Western forces can get
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  some control over over the nation of Libya well at the moment the oil from
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.680]  Libya is basically completely cut off but as far as I understand it these
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:05.880]  rebels are about to seize control of some major oil ports so basically it wants
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:10.560]  the Western powers once the globalists get full control of the oil they can
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:14.680]  decide what to do with it of course in the case of Iraq it was largely the
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:19.560]  fact that they wanted to keep this artificial scarcity going and that the
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:23.760]  oil never really flowed from Iraq so again to say that they just want to do
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:27.360]  this to make money out of selling the oil is not the case it's more about just
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:32.480]  controlling the area strategically and being able to maintain this artificial
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:36.680]  scarcity which keeps oil prices high which is precisely what they want as
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:43.320]  part of this post industrial revolution as they've said on many occasions so if
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:49.040]  the rebels get control of that oil then that eventuality will quickly become
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.360]  clear but for the moment it's the oil is still cut off because most of it is
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.000]  still under the control of Gaddafi's forces and all of all of this action
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.200]  taking place right now and this announcement by Gaddafi is just pushing
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:08.000]  oil into huge volatility it seems like right now right in the markets
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.120]  certainly I mean immediately after the the bombardment began oil shot up it's
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:17.600]  it's kind of leveled off now so I mean we'll wait we'll wait to see in which
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.240]  direction it heads because obviously you know oil is is leveling off at the 100
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:28.120]  to 110 level so it remains to be seen but I mean either way if Gaddafi steps
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:32.640]  down or if NATO have to launch this final massive assault to topple him they
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:37.480]  want this done and dusted by early September because that's when Obama
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:42.320]  and President Sarkozy the French president plan on hosting this peace
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:47.880]  summit again you know Obama the Nobel Peace Laureate or more troops deployed
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:51.960]  than at any time under Bush you know involved in more wars but they've got
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.640]  this peace summit planned for September 2nd in Paris between the Israelis and
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:02.280]  the Palestinians and Obama and Sarkozy it's important for them not to still be
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:07.960]  involved in this war because they want to pose as peacemakers so either way for
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:12.320]  them Gaddafi has to be gone by September so we're talking six to eight weeks
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:17.480]  before this thing has to be signed off but as I said before the break it's
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:22.000]  it's largely been a complete failure because it's going to be a heck of a
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.640]  lot more difficult for NATO and the White House to control the post Gaddafi
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:30.560]  transition exactly and I can't help thinking that there's got to be a lot
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:36.160]  of economic pressure in the US to get more oil flowing and keep oil prices
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.480]  artificially low somehow out of this situation in Libya because price
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:44.800]  inflation is causing a lot of pain across America and that's getting people
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.080]  even more freaked out than they are already with the the idea that they
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.560]  won't get their social security checks after August 3rd precisely that's
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:56.160]  exactly what the the White House is now trying to do it's trying to scare
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:00.680]  monger both lawmakers and the American people into acquiescing with whatever it
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:05.400]  wants to do with the financial agenda by threatening to not send out the checks
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:11.960]  by threatening similar catastrophic events as we had before the 2008 bailout
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.840]  vote when Hank Paulson went and told everybody that there would be you know
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.280]  a complete crisis martial law on the streets of America if they didn't vote
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:25.080]  for the bailout so now we're seeing a similar situation but in Libya it's also
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:31.200]  about stopping China from re-colonizing the entire continent of Africa so it's
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:36.200]  not only related to resources oil and gold being prime amongst them it's also
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:42.360]  to do with stopping China's geopolitical expansion so I mean they're trying to get
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.560]  this through on multiple levels but it looks as if they're going to have to
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:50.880]  settle for a lot less if they merely get Gaddafi to step down and if his
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.280]  influence still pervades the country which is it's looking like it will do
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:59.240]  unless they launch this massive final bombardment which they're still
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:03.000]  obviously considering well these are crucial issues is going to be fascinating
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.960]  to see how this plays out and I want to thank you for joining us today with this
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:12.280]  analysis Paul Watson want to encourage listeners to read more of Paul's

[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:27.880]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:31.680]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:35.280]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:18.400]  yeah welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm your host today filling in for
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:23.440]  Alex and Mike Adams the health ranger editor of natural news and in this
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:28.640]  segment we're going to be joined by GMO expert and advocate for safe food
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:34.560]  Jeffrey Smith from the Institute for Responsible Technology Jeffrey Smith is
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:39.880]  one of our favorite informers of what's going on on the front lines of food and
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:46.640]  GMOs and biotechnology and fact let me let me bring Jeffrey right on in here
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:50.600]  with a quick intro Institute for Responsible Technology they're a great
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:55.280]  nonprofit group doing some of the most important work out there responsible
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:01.040]  technology.org is their website and every year by the way we at natural news we
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:04.040]  actually raise money for this group because they're doing such great work
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:07.480]  so we're always happy to have Jeffrey on Jeffrey can you hear me are you with us
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:12.440]  I am with you Mike awesome great great to have you on now with there has been a
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:17.840]  disturbing development regarding Scott's miracle grow and a petition with the
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:23.420]  USDA regarding Kentucky bluegrass genetically modified yard grass
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:27.880]  essentially can you give us the breakdown of what that's all about and
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:34.160]  why it will impact us for the foreseeable future well there's two really
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.880]  important things to understand about this latest release of information by the
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:45.120]  USDA the first is that they're saying that for technical reasons they have no
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:51.240]  choice no desire to do any regulatory oversight over the release of this
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:55.560]  Kentucky bluegrass it's genetically engineered not to die when sprayed with
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:59.880]  roundup herbicide so people will douse it with herbicide in order to kill the
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:04.360]  weeds but it doesn't fit into some obscure categories which has been the
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:09.440]  USDA's requirements to be involved it doesn't affect the EPA whatsoever which
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.520]  looks after certain GM crops and it doesn't affect the FDA so in other
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:18.440]  words this ruling means that certain genetically engineered crops maybe most
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:22.400]  of the future crops that we introduced in the United States that are not food
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:27.680]  will have no regulatory agency to look after them it'll be completely
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:32.320]  self-regulated by the companies who can decide to put it on the market and not
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:35.960]  even tell us that it's genetically engineered let me be clear about this
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:41.760]  for those listening this is a huge deal this is huge the USDA is essentially
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:48.280]  saying we have no basis from which to regulate this genetically modified grass
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:53.440]  and that same logic if I'm hearing you correctly Jeff Jeffrey that same logic
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:58.200]  and reasoning could now be used for virtually all well maybe not all but
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:02.640]  many varieties of genetically modified crops is that correct you see the reason
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:10.280]  why this is the case is that back in 1992 the pro GM Bush administration wanted
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:15.600]  to figure out how to get GMOs on the market with as little resistance as
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:20.880]  possible so they desperately did not want Congress to pass any new laws so
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:25.960]  they they created what they called a regulatory framework which looked at
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:30.200]  existing laws which were not competent to actually evaluate and assess
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:33.880]  genetically modified crops but were able to kind of gerry rig them to say ah
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:38.840]  here's how we're going to review GM crops using this old law from 1914 and
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:43.680]  this old law from 1950 and this law etc well because the laws aren't really
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:48.760]  designed for genetically modified crops the USDA required that certain plans
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:54.640]  have actual pest potential or weed potential in order to be regulated but
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:37:01.560]  because they say that this scott's Kentucky bluegrass has no pest potential
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:05.280]  and slight weed potential that they're not even going to look at it they don't
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.520]  have to approve it they don't have to do an environmental impact study they can
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:13.280]  simply allow scott to do whatever it wants with its rounder pretty grass so
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:18.360]  then as of right now scott's miracle grow company could begin selling this
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:22.840]  genetically modified Kentucky bluegrass and we could have people all over the
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:26.800]  United States planting genetically modified grass in their own front yards
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.400]  I mean this this could be happening now not only could it be happening now
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:34.120]  although they say it'll be a while before they develop its marketing it
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:40.320]  not only could happen now but already there's about 185 million pounds of
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:46.720]  roundup being sprayed in the United States and the USDA just approved roundup
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:50.960]  ready alfalfa and alfalfa has grown on more than 20 million acres so that'll
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:54.640]  dramatically increase the amount of roundup and if we have grasses now
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:38:00.120]  getting roundup what we're gonna see is a is a formula for a catastrophe roundup
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:03.520]  has been linked to birth defects Parkinson's disease endocrine
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:08.200]  disruption lower sperm counts abnormal sperm birth defects etc and we're seeing
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:13.240]  a situation now where it's in such high quantities it's in our food it's in our
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:17.040]  water and it was going to be on the playgrounds where kids are playing
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:21.320]  soccer where golfers are playing golf just so it's clear again for those
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:27.040]  listening I I almost can't overemphasize this based on this decision by the USDA
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:30.160]  which is essentially a hands-off decision we can't regulate it we don't
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.920]  have any regulatory framework to even deal with this that's what they're
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:37.520]  saying it's a surrender of the USDA to the biotech industry because of this
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:43.360]  your neighbors could soon begin planting GMO grass all around you and
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:49.200]  spraying their yards with roundup just non-stop your whole neighborhood all the
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:53.120]  playgrounds all the areas around you could be sprayed with roundup because of
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:57.760]  this decision which accumulates over time for months or years and stays in the
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:02.880]  soil to affect people animals and also it increases plant disease nice I wrote
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:07.480]  a letter to the USDA spokesperson this morning and got a reply back also this
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:12.120]  morning I wanted to try and punch holes in this regulatory framework I said let's
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:17.880]  say you have a GM grass that puts out aromas that cause people to become
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:22.600]  mellow or complacent or sexually aroused or highly alert which promote
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:26.600]  hunger or cravings for a particular company's food or lack of cravings
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:31.200]  would could that be completely unregulated the FDA wouldn't necessarily
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:35.480]  regulate it the EPA doesn't regulate it the USDA wouldn't regulate it so now you
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:40.720]  have marketers that can come and put in they can do lawns that attract cats to
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.960]  go to the bathroom on it or lawns that attract that push to repel cats and dogs
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:50.640]  they can have cat grass that can produce catnip to get cat stoned in fact years
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:56.440]  ago there was a nicotine company a tobacco company that grew tobacco with
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:01.440]  higher levels of addictive nicotine they smuggled it into Brazil grew it and
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:05.160]  brought it into the United States and put a cigarette in each pack of 20 to
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:11.640]  create more more addiction in US smokers it is possible with this law that
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:17.160]  this would be completely unregulated by the USDA FDA or EPA alright so now so
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.760]  now what you're painting here for us is a future of genetically modified lawns
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:26.520]  where they could have lawns growing drugs or even vaccines couldn't you
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:31.920]  actually have grass growing vaccines in your front yard and if they're
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:37.520]  technically drugs and they're taken in then the FDA may have jurisdiction they
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:41.280]  might say something about that huh but in this case you know if it's simply like
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.240]  a plant that has some aroma qualities you know you can get different smells
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:50.800]  from plants maybe the smell has them so it's known to be cause alertness or
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:54.360]  arousal you know it's possible that these can go in with absolutely no
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:59.880]  regulatory oversight like Viagra lawns come on over we're having a block party
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:06.720]  on our Viagra lawn and in the backyard we have Prozac lawn I think we need to
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.160]  run this by the Oak Park City planners office in Michigan to see if they
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:15.240]  approve of these suitable live plant material of your Viagra lawn what do
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:19.640]  you think about that I think it's a great idea what we have a situation here is
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:25.680]  it demonstrates the complete facade you see back in 1992 when the Bush
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:29.960]  administration told the regulatory agencies to promote GMOs there was only
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:34.920]  one of them that had real strong laws in place that could slow down the
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:40.120]  promotion that was the FDA so what they did is the FDA brought in Monsanto's
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:44.440]  former attorney Michael Taylor to be in charge of policy and through some kind
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:49.840]  of sleight of hand somehow he was able to allow GMOs to go on the market and
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:54.640]  give them generally recognized as safe status in other words he told the
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:42:00.040]  companies themselves we require no safety studies whatsoever if you determine
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:04.640]  that your food genetically modified is safe we believe you we believe you
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:10.000]  Monsanto who told us the DDT agent orange and PCBs were safe now Michael
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.440]  Taylor was my who was in charge of policy was Monsanto's former attorney
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:18.640]  later Monsanto's vice president and now he was put in as the US food
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.040]  safeties are in the Obama administration right the great revolving door
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:27.400]  between government and private industry but does all this mean now Jeffrey that
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:31.400]  has the government basically just surrendered to biotech just thrown in
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:35.680]  the towel and said surrender you see they're on the same side that's right
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:39.040]  that's right it's not like they're against them and they've given up they
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:42.560]  actually the WikiLeaks have showed us that they've deployed the entire State
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:46.800]  Department apparatus which we already knew but this kind of showed their actual
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:52.560]  tactics where for example the ambassador to France asked his handlers in the US
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.600]  to issue a retaliation list against countries in Europe that have been
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:02.240]  resistant to GMO that's right specifically asked them to cause some pain
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:07.680]  now we know that when my I was in Zambia talking to some Jesuit priests there
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:11.400]  that were taught that were involved in the Zambian decision to reject
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:17.040]  Janelki modified corn from the United States they told me that Colin Powell had
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:22.160]  tried to intervene in the Vatican to try and censure the Jesuit priests that they
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:26.680]  were they had sent I talked to one secretary of former secretary or the
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:30.680]  minister of agriculture there he said when he was went to shake and Venomans
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:34.200]  hand who was the secretary of agriculture in the US she refused to shake his hand
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:37.960]  when he when she heard that he was from Zambia who had rejected our GM corn and
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:42.600]  just said backward country and walked away wow it's it's incredible now you've
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:47.360]  been doing a lot of traveling you spent time in India can you give us a quick
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:51.880]  rundown of what you saw there on the streets about the farmers committing
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:57.840]  suicide after experiencing massive crop failures due to the GMO crops there
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:02.880]  what's what's going on well what turns out an investigative report by UK daily
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:09.960]  mail estimated in 2008 that 125,000 farmers who planted genetically modified
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:14.280]  BT cotton committed suicide because their yields were not sufficient to pay
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:18.480]  back their high-interest loans my friend Vanda Nishiva puts that number now
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:25.000]  closer to 2.5 or 250,000 farmers and she commissioned a group that
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.400]  actually went door-to-door to a hundred homes where suicides had taken place in
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:34.080]  a cotton belt and found that about 95 out of a hundred were directly or
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:39.320]  indirectly related to the failure of BT cotton and I'm sorry but isn't the method
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:44.520]  of suicide usually they drink pesticide they often do they often do it's a
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:50.960]  tragedy I just in fact read an article this week that they they found an
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:54.640]  official from Monsanto was visiting a town so they brought him to an area
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:59.040]  showing that half of the seeds did not even sprout or germinate and when he
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:06.320]  refused to acknowledge any fault they beat him up previously other seed
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:10.320]  salesman like a Monsanto salesman was was kidnapped and tied up until he was
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.640]  released by the police you know the farmers obviously they're ruining
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:18.040]  their lives they're ruining their communities and not only that but I've
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:21.840]  spoke I went to one village where they allowed their buffalo to graze on cotton
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:25.560]  plants after harvest for eight years but when they allow them to graze on GM
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:30.600]  genetically modified cotton plants all 13 buffalo died within a after a single
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:34.320]  day's eating they lost 26 goats and sheep and this was emblematic and
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:39.120]  illustrative of what's happening around the cotton belt sheep goats some cows
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:46.440]  and buffalo are dying or having serious diseases or disorders after consuming
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:51.680]  genetic of modified BT cotton plants or cotton seed cakes but Jeffrey the press
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:56.800]  in the in the US almost never covers this mainline media almost never reports
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:00.440]  what's going on with the suicides of the farmers with the dead animals with the
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:05.880]  devastating crop yields we're all told that GMOs increase crop yields that this
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:09.840]  is the way to abundance this is how we're going to feed the world I mean how
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:14.040]  why are we all being lied to so consistently why can't we break through
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:17.760]  that with some honest information I mean you're doing a great job Alice Jones is
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:21.520]  doing a great job I'm hoping to play my part with on natural news as well we're
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:25.200]  trying but we're not we're not getting to the masses on this what's what's it
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:28.960]  going to take well you know fortunately because this is an issue where people can
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:35.000]  respond to GMOs by not buying them we don't need to have 51% of Americans
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.120]  reject GM ingredients in order for craft food to say well we've lost half of our
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:43.640]  market share it's time to switch when a small percentage of US shoppers were
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:48.520]  made to avoid GMOs I we think about 5% or 15 million Americans because there's
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:52.840]  no consumer benefits to GMOs they either drink poison like herbicides or
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:58.400]  produce poison like pesticides then when we see that many people rejecting GM
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:02.200]  brands it will drop the market share of the same companies that have already
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:06.320]  removed GMOs from their European and Japanese lines because there the tipping
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:09.680]  point has been achieved we already saw a tipping point against bovine growth
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:13.560]  hormone in this country where most American the dairies including Walmart
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:18.560]  Starbucks Joe Platten Dan and have removed it so our plan is to go to the
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:23.320]  most receptive groups and to use groups like natural news which has been
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:27.320]  fantastic in presenting this information to very receptive people so that people
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:32.120]  not only understand the dangers but realize that there's alternatives which
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:36.600]  they can buy non-gmo products very easily and we have non-gmo shopping guide
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:41.240]  dot com to help people make healthier non-gmo choices and drive the tipping
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:43.880]  point that's a really good shopping guide I do recommend that that's a great
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:48.680]  that's a great downloadable guide but doesn't this depend Jeffrey on honest
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:55.040]  labeling and we have the FDA and the USDA just completely against accurate
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:59.080]  labeling of foods they do not want people to know that there are GMOs in
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:02.200]  their foods they're fighting this labeling tooth and nail and the biotech
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:06.320]  industry as well saying that oh if it's labeled on there that might confuse
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:09.760]  people it might people might think it's different well it is different I mean
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:13.760]  doesn't doesn't that doesn't isn't the labeling the real key issue here well I
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:17.600]  think labeling obviously if things were labeled it would wipe out GMOs from the
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.680]  food supply because 53% of Americans say they wouldn't eat GMOs if they were
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:26.640]  labeled and the and the FDA is officially mandated with promoting the
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:31.800]  biotechnology industry so they ignore the desire of 95% Americans who want
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:35.440]  mandatory labeling to promote the economic interests of five biotech
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:41.480]  companies however Mike the thing is this we don't absolutely need labeling in
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:46.720]  order to create a tipping point because if people have we now have a lot thousands
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:50.680]  of products that are enrolled in this new non-gimo project which is a third
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:55.120]  party verifier for non-gimo claims there's already 1200 products that have
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:59.720]  been verified many of them bear the seal non-gimo project verified if we can
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:04.080]  drive the health conscious shoppers the parents of young kids the people who
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:08.480]  are sick the doctors if we can drive the most receptive demographics who are
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:13.760]  aware of these problems to choose products that are labeled non-gimo to
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:16.680]  choose products that are organic to choose products that don't have the
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:21.360]  at-risk ingredients from the 8 GM food crops that would be enough even without
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:26.040]  labeling yeah that's that's really key and again for those listening or
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:31.040]  watching this is just crucial if you're eating GMOs I believe that you are
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:34.840]  subjecting yourself to a risk of poisoning through your food and I know
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:39.080]  Jeffrey completely agrees with that believe it or not Jeffrey we're just
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.080]  about out of time for your segment do you have any final thoughts before we
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:46.080]  wrap this up yes the American Academy of Environmental Medicine now urges all
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:52.160]  doctors to prescribe non-gimo diets to every patient they actually indicate
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:56.040]  that animal feeding studies show reproductive problems digestive problems
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:00.800]  immune system problems accelerated aging etc. it's not enough to simply be a
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:05.400]  against GMOs and be against Monsanto and be against the government we have to be
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:10.240]  empowered to make healthier choices ourselves we have to say it's gonna be
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:13.800]  us that decides what we put in our mouths and not the biotic industry or
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:17.240]  their enforcement wing in Washington and so I encourage people to learn more
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:21.240]  about the dangers of GMOs and to take those steps to protect themselves and
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:24.200]  if they have extra energy to protect the community by sharing the information
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:28.600]  with others well said Jeffrey Smith everybody thank you for joining us and

[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:25.000]  issues today just finished up a segment with Jeffrey Smith on GMOs get ready for
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.160]  genetically modified lawns coming to a neighborhood near you where people are
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:33.520]  spraying roundup all over your neighborhood and the children's
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:39.160]  pray playgrounds isn't it amazing it's okay it's okay to have GMO grass in your
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:43.120]  yard and to spray it with roundup but if you try to grow organic vegetables
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:48.480]  haha nope big brother doesn't want you to have that kind of food chemicals are
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:53.120]  fine right but real food forget it now this segment as I promised we're going
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:56.000]  to be talking with Ted Anderson it's going to be a lot of fun with another
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  update on gold but let me give you a quick introduction to some of the
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.280]  breaking news today on gold prices gold is surging today this is being reported
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:12.440]  by Bloomberg a record after Moody's of course threatened to downgrade US debt
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:18.280]  ratings down from its triple a rating if you can believe that triple a rating
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:22.160]  man this is like I wish we had these kind of ratings when I was going to high
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:26.960]  school you know you flunk a test and you get an a-plus that's what the US is
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:31.640]  doing right now with its debt system failing the people failing everybody but
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:35.560]  getting a triple a rating and it's being threatened with oh we're going to turn it
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:40.880]  down a notch if you don't reach a debt ceiling increase which would only make
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:45.640]  the problem even worse no wonder gold prices are going so high so joining us
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:51.160]  here is Ted Anderson Ted are you are you with us I'm right here with you man I
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:54.840]  tell you the markets are screaming screaming right now that there's going
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:59.280]  to be a crash that's what that's what the gold and silver market is saying I mean
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:03.920]  right now we have gold almost into the sixteen hundred dollar level we've seen
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:10.040]  fifteen ninety four seventy today silver reaching just about forty dollars an
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:15.040]  ounce thirty nine forty seven and like you said Moody's downgrading the United
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:18.720]  States Treasuries I mean the only reason why the United States Treasuries had
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:23.680]  value in the past is because it was a the the currency was exchangeable for
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:28.040]  gold all the way through 1971 and we've been living on this legacy of being the
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:32.520]  world power currency and now they're saying hey if we don't go further into
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:36.640]  debt so we can make our past due debt payments that they're going to downgrade
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:43.040]  our our triple a rating I mean Moody's is a bond house and they do rate bonds and
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:47.120]  and what they're saying is that there's a chance for the in the that things might
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:51.920]  be defaulting which you would think that Moody's will also make the assessment
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:55.280]  that hey if you have to go into debt further just in order to pay the past do
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:57:00.200]  interest in the and principal then you have a problem we have to downgrade you
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:02.560]  anyways but that's that's the whole thing there
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:07.880]  Italy and Greece and all the northern European countries they're falling apart
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:13.800]  to I mean it just is there's a stench of of destruction going on across the
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:17.520]  entire world and that's why you see people getting into the gold and silver
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:21.520]  and it seems like people are picking up on this now there there is a growing
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:24.880]  sense of urgency maybe I wouldn't quite call it panic yet but it's a sense of
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:30.000]  urgency to get squared away with gold a lot of people have have waited on this
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.880]  and now they're they're realizing gee I better take action now otherwise it's
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:36.840]  going to be too late and it is almost too late already I can tell you we had a
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:42.400]  run here this spring and for me to try to buy the kind of quantity of gold and
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:47.440]  silver mostly silver eagles and to be specific you know I mean I was trying to
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:53.560]  buy silver eagles at you know but at at at a hundred thousand ounces at a time
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:57.480]  and I'd be lucky to buy be able to buy 20 to 40,000 from various different
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:01.960]  places it was just dried up there the US men can't make enough to meet the
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:06.320]  demand and if you just get the common person back into gold and silver there
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:10.960]  just isn't going to be enough and I wanted to tell I'm sorry I want to hold
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:13.480]  you over for the next segment and I've got a couple of questions for you I want
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:16.360]  to give you more time here too I apologize for interrupting you but we

[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:53.840]  easing which just means flooding more useless fiat currency into the money
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:57.480]  supply devaluing the dollars that you're holding right now and the dollars
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:00.120]  that you're getting in your checks whatever kind of checks you're getting
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:03.760]  retirement social security veterans benefits those are going to become
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:09.120]  increasingly worthless in the days months and years ahead thanks to the
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:13.120]  actions of our own federal government now insurance against that is of course
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:18.240]  found in precious metals and continuing with Ted Anderson we are talking about
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:23.040]  why precious metals make sense especially with today's debt ceiling
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:27.480]  crisis now upon us Ted sorry to cut you off before the break there please
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:32.560]  continue yeah no just the thing is everybody knows that gold and silver's
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:36.840]  been money for thousands of years I mean like over 6,000 years you can go back
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:40.880]  to look at the Egyptians and when they opened up their tombs you didn't find
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:46.000]  fiat paper money they had gold and silver in those tombs and it's been used
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.360]  for years and years and you can't print you can't you can't monetize gold and
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:56.280]  silver by turning on a printing press it the supplies are limited so what's
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:00.840]  there is there and that's why it's so important to take away the printing
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:05.840]  press from our politicians I mean look Mitch McConnell is proposing that we
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:10.040]  let Barack Obama decide where the debt ceiling is going to go it's just going
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:14.120]  to become a presidential order and Alex has been talking about dictatorship for
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:18.080]  you know I don't know how long now and this is exactly the kind of thing you
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:22.560]  give the president the power to coin the currency and decide how much is going
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:27.080]  to go under the system he can destroy the economy or he can and he can
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:31.640]  accelerate the economy at his own whim and he'll have control there will be no
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:35.880]  longer elections the free nation will be gone yeah I've never seen it get this
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:38.760]  crazy and this this is why getting squared away right now with gold and
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:44.000]  silver makes so much sense a Ted you are legendary for helping people get their
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.400]  hands on some of these precious metals at prices that are like going back in a
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:51.520]  time machine what do you what do you have available right now for the
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:56.240]  listeners well right now presently I mean we do have a list of we have some
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:03:00.760]  Mexican pesos we have some gold coronas and there's some things like that that
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:04.880]  I have on my list that the market is you know not in we haven't increased our
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:08.680]  prices but the market's got up like crazy so you do get a great buy there but
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:12.640]  one of the most Alex had me put together this American dream video and
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:18.400]  Mark Dice's book and two silver dollars for $75 delivered I can tell you right
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:23.120]  now just to buy the silver dollars alone directly from Midas or any other
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:26.920]  company for that matter is going to be over 80 bucks just to get the silver
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:31.840]  dollars you get the books and the videos for free for $75 delivered that's
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:35.160]  probably where you want to get started and then you can ask about the gold and
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:39.640]  silver because right now at this time the markets are just crumbling as we're
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:42.880]  looking at them and then gold and silver's going up through the roof if
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:46.880]  you watch Ron Paul confronting Ben Bernanke you can see that Bernanke is
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:51.360]  just tripping all over his tongue and Ron Paul's just dead on right and people
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:55.240]  need to have gold and silver they need to have these silver dollars because if
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:59.640]  you're sitting with money in the bank if money in the stock market you name it
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:06.000]  all that stuff is just literally eroding and erasing the value where the gold and
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:10.280]  silver's just going up in tandem so it's simple yeah all you need to do is call
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:20.400]  1-800-686-2237 again 1-800-686-2237 ask for the silver dollar special with the
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:24.480]  American dream and if you're looking at doing something more I mean just
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:27.600]  yesterday I said people should be getting into the $20 gold pieces they're
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:32.440]  trading at about $900 they just jumped over a thousand for I'm sorry for the
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:36.680]  $10 gold pieces in the 20s just over 2,000 yeah that's what's going on in
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:40.600]  this market right now it's all people need to get motivated and I mean now and
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:43.920]  they are getting motivated anybody who's paying attention it understands that
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:47.840]  this debt crisis is upon us time to take action is right now thank you Ted for

[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:07.360]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:11.560]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:15.440]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:19.120]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:23.680]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:28.320]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:32.080]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:35.520]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:39.480]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:42.640]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:46.320]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:23.840]  Alex Jones
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:30.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm the fill-in host today Mike Adams the
[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:32.960]  health ranger man what a day we've had a lot of great
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:36.720]  information already bringing you a lot more in this hour at the bottom of the
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:40.240]  hour we're going to be joined by health freedom attorney
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:44.080]  Jonathan E. Mord the author of the rise of tyranny great book
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:48.080]  talks about how regulatory agencies get out of control and make their own laws
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:51.280]  without congressional approval that's coming up at the bottom of the hour
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:55.760]  and in this segment we are joined by Aaron Dykes right here from the infowars
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:59.520]  team a great analyst a great reporter researcher
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:02.720]  who's going to be breaking down for some additional information
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:07.200]  about how corporations are all tied into the same core power structures
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:11.280]  also we will cover the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:16.640]  vaccines throughout the world in addition how that foundation is pushing
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:20.640]  genetically engineered crops on Africa they just never quit
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:24.560]  always have ideas don't they pushing more chemicals and more strange
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:28.400]  genetic sequences on different countries around the world
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:32.000]  Aaron how you doing today great Mike good to be with you again
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:36.320]  it's always very interesting so what I want to talk about today is obviously
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:40.240]  there's concerns for decades now about GMO crops
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:44.160]  what they're doing with big pharma but I just want to point out that this is
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:47.280]  bigger than big pharma bigger than just big agra
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:50.640]  these are systems that are corporately locked in
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:53.680]  with the people we've been talking about for most of the past month the
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:57.760]  Bilderberg group very important ties in the government
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:01.360]  of course it's pretty well known by this point Michael Taylor
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:05.280]  currently the deputy commissioner for foods at the FDA
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:08.800]  was formerly a Monsanto lawyer and I think a member of their corporate
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:11.840]  structure as well and I just stumbled upon this earlier
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:14.560]  today after we already were going to talk about this
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:20.880]  Michael Taylor reappointment to the FDA in July of 2009 came just after Obama
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:25.440]  and the other g8 leaders pledged 20 billion to fight hunger in Africa
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:28.880]  over the next three years and fighting hunger is always done with genetically
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:32.000]  modified foods yeah we talked about how Obama the
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.280]  first black president may be the only one who could bomb
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:39.840]  Africa bomb levia carry out these wars maybe he's the only one who can carry
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:43.760]  out genocidal policies in Africa as well
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:48.560]  wow what a great benefit i'm saying that sarcastically of course but
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:51.520]  what you're doing here what's really cool about your research is your your
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:55.440]  you're helping people open up to the bigger picture and tying into
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:58.880]  the overlay of corporate control because a lot of people
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:03.200]  for example a lot of my readers say their their concern might end with big
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:06.080]  pharma it's always big pharma or it's always FDA
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:09.680]  but you're saying wait a minute the people who are key decision makers
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:13.200]  in in big pharma and in the FDA they actually go up higher
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:16.560]  and they're part of a whole different corporate web of control that goes way
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:21.360]  outside the pharmaceutical industry yeah uh i mean take monsanto on the
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:24.800]  corporate board you have companies that include
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:28.720]  sorry that's the wrong paper but you have come you have lockheed martin
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:32.800]  you know the military industrial complex on the board of monsanto you have
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:36.800]  uh mcdonald's on the board of monsanto you have sarah lee corporation on the
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:41.760]  board of monsanto uh can you get a shot of this for
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:46.960]  for tv i don't know we've got all these little charts there's good sites like
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:51.200]  in uh nndb which is a database thing that'll show you the links between
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:55.680]  companies there's also mukhidi.com but they don't have all the details but
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:58.800]  and we obviously we can't present it all here but if you track these
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:02.560]  corporations it's just disgusting the bill melinda gates foundation who's
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:06.640]  funding all this food in africa stuff has ties to monsanto ties to
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:10.480]  bsf uh what i'm trying to say is this goes
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:13.840]  back to what we commonly refer to as the military
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:17.440]  industrial complex it's branched out into big agra big pharma
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:23.280]  well let's read some of these robert supero ceo monsanto from 1995 to 2000
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:28.560]  he sat on the boards of city bank city group new york stock exchange
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:32.800]  searl uh monsanto far well of course monsanto pharm uh
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:36.880]  pharmacy a builder bird group member of the group you've been covering that a lot
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:41.440]  so robert supero attended the builder bird group back in 99 when gmo was still
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:46.160]  a fresh topic he was the one who debated uh the gmo topic that year at builder
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:49.120]  bird uh with another guy from britain who was kind of a
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:53.440]  depopulation uh fanatic and they discussed the dangers uh how
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:57.040]  terminator seeds would actually have a genocidal effect on third world
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:01.120]  populations uh but of course they say that's all for intellectual property
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:05.520]  rights and of course right but this guy robert supero
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:10.000]  was part of searl he was instrumental in getting aspartame approved
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.560]  in conjunction with don rumsfeld yes who also has ties to these very same
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:18.320]  companies uh you have other former secretaries of
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:22.000]  defense like frank carlucci who's also tied to these companies
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:26.800]  and uh so this guy robert supero very closely tied to pharmacy a monsanto
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:31.520]  surle who all uh later had a merger and then he was also in u.s. government in
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:36.160]  fact he is the advisor who you may
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:40.960]  remember from about a year and a half ago who said only a terror attack and save
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:44.560]  obama all right right i'm pre-announcing the
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:48.240]  false flag intention so we've got this monsanto guy who's tied to
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:51.360]  defense who yeah pre-announce that we need another
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:55.280]  911 or oklahoma city bombing to save obama's approval ratings
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:59.520]  but he has ties to the bush administration as well so he's a non-partisan
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:02.960]  so what you're describing really is a big good ol boys club with all these
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:06.000]  different companies they're all tied in and these are the kinds of companies
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.440]  that get the obama care waivers of course from washington right
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:12.720]  they don't have to play by the same rules that everybody else plays by
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:16.160]  they're the inner club they're the ones who are who are part of the secret
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:18.480]  agenda that's talked about at bill de berg
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:21.280]  i mean they're the ones who are given the government grants and the
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:24.880]  government waivers so they have these unfair business advantages i mean
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:28.960]  companies like this list right here coca-cola coca-cola is still allowed to
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:32.400]  import coca leaves the only corporation in the united
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:36.240]  states allowed to import coca leaves which from which cocaine is still
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:40.080]  extracted and sold off to a company in st lewis and i did i did research on this
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:42.800]  so i i know that and there's there's cocaine being
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:46.800]  made in the us as a byproduct of you know the soda industry
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:50.240]  that's one of the companies in this you know privileged group
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:54.000]  that kind of thing goes on all the time doesn't it yeah sure and the bill
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:57.840]  millinda gates foundation are in particular uh tied with this report
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:01.600]  from truth out really interesting and the title is monsanto and gates
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:05.600]  foundation push gcrops on africa so why would they be
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:08.720]  interested in that they just want to save the world and feed them right
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:12.160]  right well you've got the reports from global research
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:17.120]  pointing out how the green revolution of the 70s in the third world was really
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:21.120]  in large part a rockefeller foundation ploy for
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:25.200]  dominance in the biotech industry now it's gotten even worse
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:28.400]  uh because they're going to have exclusive
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:34.080]  water efficient maze for africa uh crop climate ready crops these genetically
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:36.720]  engineered things that are meant to deal with
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:40.400]  uh you know drought conditions for africa supposedly to feed the world
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:44.640]  but then we have all the problems with gmo it causes according to these studies
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:49.120]  with lab rats cancer and sterility infertility
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:53.280]  other infertility isn't that the common thread and you look at the bill gates
[02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:56.640]  bill and millinda gates foundation pushing vaccines
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:00.480]  studying infertility technologies like the ultrasound that they use
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:03.680]  on men's reproductive organs and it gives them infertility
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:07.840]  for six months yeah how much fun that must be and then also of course
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:11.440]  genetically modified foods now that have according to many reports
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:15.520]  side effects of infertility isn't that the common thread really it's infertility
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:19.840]  that's being exported into africa yeah real strange since they called for
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:23.840]  depopulation in the 70s kissinger when he was secretary of state
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:29.280]  issued the nsm 200 memo uh saying it was the first priority in the third world
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:32.640]  and he listed specific countries and said that
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:36.000]  uh basically the agreements would even be to the point that a global
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.840]  institution would withhold food from countries that did not reduce their
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:43.360]  population in order to uh through a blackmail
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:46.640]  threat reduce the population forcibly by withholding
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:49.760]  world aggregated food but let's go back to the bill and millinda gates
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:52.480]  foundation yeah who are teamed up with basf who are
[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:56.960]  teamed up with monsanto uh singento which is a swiss gmo
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:59.680]  company which also attends bill de berg each year
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:03.600]  bayer dal they're all in this article from truth out but then you have bill
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:07.360]  and millinda gates foundation part of the global seed vault in the north
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:10.480]  preserving the things that aren't genetically modified and you have bill
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:14.320]  gates saying he wants to control the weather he wants to steer hurricanes
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:17.120]  wait why didn't i didn't i wasn't aware of that is that a new
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:21.520]  uh it's about a year old but oh okay he's also part of this climate geo
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:24.320]  engineering project and they claim they're gonna
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:28.240]  take a target you know potentially like new orleans in a hurricane katrina
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:31.120]  scenario and for a fee he can kindly steer that
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:34.880]  hurricane away uh but you know it's very hard to prove
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:37.920]  when weather's manipulated uh certainly at this point
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:41.600]  we have critics and observers always blaming these globalists for doing these
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:45.200]  things uh but the tangible proof is harder to come by
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:48.560]  then you have these drought conditions in africa somewhere in asia
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:51.680]  and they're going to supply these water efficient crops
[02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:55.280]  that are genetically modified that they have a total monopoly on
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:58.320]  and where there's corporate and infrastructure locked in do you do you
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:02.000]  think in some way that that africa is sort of a test case
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:05.920]  where maybe this is this is their the place where they they try out
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:09.760]  different different technologies and to see if they're going to work
[02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:14.960]  on depopulation elements in in africa and then if that works they're going to
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:18.080]  bring them more aggressively to north america
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:21.760]  i mean is there any hint that it's a testing ground
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:24.800]  i think we've already seen the kind of uh parallel
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:30.240]  you know we got the the overfed world and the west with its own problems of
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:34.000]  eating all this junk food and the health problems the diabetes etc
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.440]  hey that's another thing i saw on your website last week the juvenile diabetes
[02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:40.160]  research foundation being promoted by these soda
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:42.720]  companies and fast food companies oh yeah
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:45.840]  look here at the board they're all part of it this robert Shapiro guys on the
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:48.400]  board for that yeah uh the johnson and johnson
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:51.680]  foundation guys on the board for juvenile diabetes research
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:54.960]  i remember it's tied directly in to monsanto you're right it's all the same
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:58.480]  stuff uh grocery stores sometimes will have these things buy a
[02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:01.840]  coke and will donate something for diabetes
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:04.480]  it's the high fructose corn syrup in the coke
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:08.000]  uh that was at a kentucky fried chicken i think we did a story on that a
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:12.080]  giant like a big gulp sized container of soda
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:15.280]  and they'll donate a little bit of money for diabetes research to the juvenile
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:17.840]  diabetes group yeah so it's insane when these four
[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:21.120]  frosties and they'll donate a dollar for yeah it's insane
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:24.880]  why don't you just stop selling us the the high fructose corn syrup and we
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:28.800]  wouldn't have such an issue the diabetes i mean that's the that's the
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:32.880]  research make your run across the parking lot to get your your coke
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:36.560]  but that's that's the bigger problem i'm trying to draw people too of course we
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:40.320]  have gmo problems and the rest of it and health problems uh
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:43.360]  but then you've got people like bill melinda gator sorry to cut you off we
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:45.920]  got to go to a break here right now we're going to come back with a little
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:50.560]  more information here on the big corporate structure that is working on
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:53.440]  taking over our world stay with us right here on the alex
[02:19:53.440 --> 02:20:01.440]  jones show we'll be right back after this break
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:05.840]  question can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:09.840]  minds author jose calazo answers yes in his two
[02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:14.320]  new books america's new slavery for more than 13 years
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:18.080]  author jose calazo has been trying to prove that the u.s.
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:21.360]  government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts
[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:25.280]  with a revolutionary technology known as f m r i
[02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:29.920]  functional magnetic resonance imaging and there is proof that it exists
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:33.280]  america's new slavery explores this technology
[02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:36.720]  and it's many possible applications in national security
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:41.840]  who has access to it how is it being used does america's salvation rest in
[02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:44.880]  this technology these and many other questions
[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:50.160]  are answered in america's new slavery the new books by jose calazo

[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:11.120]  i hear the train coming yes we're back man
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:15.600]  all right welcome back to the alex joneshow mike adams here joined by
[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:19.760]  erin dykes we're just chatting off camera about some of the insanity
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:26.160]  out there in the world of pharmaceutical bioengineered crops
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:29.520]  yes you've heard about this right alex has covered it before
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:34.160]  this is where they put genes into the crops tobacco plants rice plants corn
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:38.240]  plants whatever the case may be so that they can then grow drugs
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:41.280]  yes they grow drugs and they grow vaccines right in the crops and then
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:45.040]  they harvest those and pull the drugs out and then feed them to people or
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:48.160]  inject them into people this is one of the most
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:52.720]  outrageously dangerous acts of violation of god and nature that we've
[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:55.600]  ever seen witnessed on planet earth it's
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:25:00.800]  absolutely insane erin you're going to bring us some more analysis on this
[02:25:00.800 --> 02:25:04.160]  what why why is this happening why do they keep
[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:07.200]  doing this to us they obviously have something planned
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:12.560]  because as i said before big agra and big gmo are teamed up with the
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:16.000]  bigger boys the Rockefeller and bill gates foundations where all the elite
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.040]  money is steered so why are they running doomsday seed
[02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:23.200]  vaults while creating drought conditions and supplying the ready made
[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:27.600]  solution of drought resistant crops that are genetically modified
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:31.440]  we can only speculate but we know that depopulation is part of their overall
[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:35.600]  agenda and which little sub sectors directly relate to that
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:41.680]  with fear do i speculative upon this but i've got this headline from 2004
[02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:46.960]  pharmaceutical gmo pharma crop interest growth so does concern
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:49.680]  then parallel with that i've got this company here
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:56.320]  just the overview on syngenta uh it's their board of directors uh let's see
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:00.560]  martin taylor is a bill deberg steering group member he's been there for years
[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:04.720]  they are a swiss agribusiness company who do gmo's and pesticides
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:10.720]  who were formed out of novartis and astro zeneca agro chemicals
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:15.360]  so you can see where it ties in right there with pharmaceutical gmo crops
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:18.560]  yeah what are they going to do to us what drug will they push and
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:22.720]  will that cause sterility in cancer just from taking these prescription drugs
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:25.600]  well that's really where all this is going isn't it because they know
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:28.880]  they know that these genetic contaminations of the crops are going to
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:31.280]  escape into the wild i mean that's what already happened
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:34.480]  that happened a year and a half ago they got out into the wild and it was
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:37.360]  contaminating the crops and it caused a big uproar
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:41.600]  and they sort of backed off for a while but now they're restarting these same
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:43.920]  efforts and it's just it's sure to happen
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:47.520]  you can't put nature in a box you can't control seeds
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:50.720]  they're going to blow around and contaminate other crops and end up
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:55.440]  putting drugs in our corn even if it did help us there's no long-term testing
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:00.320]  but then it's these big institutions the fda the epa the regulators
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:03.520]  who we've put our trust in to watch these things
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:08.080]  they're part of these same onsanto type companies they are directly or indirectly
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:11.200]  mostly directly that's what jeffrey smith was sharing with us earlier in the
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:14.080]  last hour too you know these these companies aren't against
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:17.840]  i mean the regulators are not against the companies they're in the same
[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:22.160]  bed the same they're on the same team they're all trying to push gmo's on us
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:26.480]  you have any final thoughts as we wrap up this final thoughts is don't only
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:29.440]  follow the money but follow these interlocking boards and you will be
[02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:32.640]  surprised what you learned and and we have to fight against this and take back
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:35.760]  control of our own lives obviously what was that website once again that shows
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:38.800]  the interrelations there's two that i'm aware of one
[02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:44.640]  is nn db db like a database and then the others muckity
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:48.560]  com and both of them will help you map some of these corporate relations
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:51.200]  but i could tell you right out they don't have all the information so you
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:54.320]  should use that as a starting point yeah there's also the issue of there's a lot
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:57.840]  of invisible influence over these companies that of
[02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:00.960]  course isn't on the record someone's not necessarily on the
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:05.120]  board but they inflight like a kissinger can come in and influence these
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:07.200]  companies not even being on the board
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:11.760]  certainly and these fortune 100 and 500 companies even if they do have
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:15.440]  somewhat beneficial separate identities are all linked in with these big
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:18.720]  foundations you can see here on them bill and melinda gauge got coca-cola
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:22.080]  craft everything major going on incredible

[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:03.920]  our nutritional supplements that were formulated after 1994
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:08.960]  that's right anything formulated in the last 17 years is now potentially
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:15.120]  subjected to new regulatory approval by the fda it's
[02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:18.160]  like they're declaring war on our supplements once again
[02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:21.200]  and jonathan emorde is going to be breaking that down with us on the other

[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:43.040]  other topics even he's written a book called the rise of tyranny
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:48.160]  which explains how the fda and the usda and other government agencies get out
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:51.200]  of control how does it happen how come congress
[02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:54.880]  doesn't have authority over the regulations that these agencies roll
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:59.360]  out and try to steamroll us with well jonathan's book explains that so

[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:27.120]  favorite books i really appreciate your writing and your leadership on this
[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:30.560]  issue now let's start with the new dietary
[02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:34.800]  ingredients requirements that the fda is threatening
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:39.040]  to burden us with all across the country to question or
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:43.600]  let's say require a new sort of approval of all ingredients
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:48.000]  that were introduced into dietary supplements since 1994 can you break down
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.400]  that issue for us jonathan sure uh this is a horrendous expansion of
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:56.480]  federal power out of the bureaucracy uh with the
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:00.720]  full blessing of the congress of the united states principally those
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:04.560]  people like dick durbin who sponsored these measures
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:09.600]  really really detest individual liberty he loves the government hates
[02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:13.840]  individual liberty and has proven that point over and over again by
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:17.280]  favoring measures that deprive people of liberty and
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:21.040]  have the government basically uh determine what's in your own best
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:24.960]  interest rather than allowing you to which is the ultimate in
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:29.040]  destruction of individual liberty but for decades you know mike
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:34.480]  the fda has repeatedly tried to either reclassify dietary supplements as
[02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:37.920]  unsafe food additives put a limit on the quantitative
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:41.760]  amount of ingredients and say anything above the rda level
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:46.960]  makes it a drug or otherwise restrict the availability of supplements
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:51.600]  in the market and those have come up against significant public opposition
[02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:56.720]  but the uh the lessons learned from those battles by the agency
[02:36:56.720 --> 02:37:00.080]  did not result in them changing their interest in
[02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:04.160]  removing supplements from the market but changing their tactics and how they
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:08.800]  go after supplements under the guise of food safety or health
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:12.560]  safety and they're doing the same with organic food producers
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:16.720]  essentially the government of the united states and principally the food drug
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:21.360]  administration is a captive of leading industry
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:25.280]  in the case of the fda it's a patsy for the drug industry
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:30.240]  in fact the fda associate director of the office of drug safety david graham
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:36.560]  has said that the fda uh is views the drug industry as its client and will
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:40.160]  approve as many drugs as it possibly can
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:44.400]  in order to placate the interest the financial interests of that industry
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:49.040]  and so we have many unsafe drugs that have been approved into the market
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:53.600]  yet on the other side where people can take control of their own health through
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:56.560]  organic foods and through dietary supplements
[02:37:56.560 --> 02:37:59.760]  the fda has gone after those things with a vengeance
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:03.280]  but here's what's happening legislatively and at the fda with this
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:12.000]  new emphasis on on quote unquote safety the the food safety modernization act
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.640]  which dick durvin principally promoted uh liberal democratic senator from
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:20.480]  illinois and this is the act of past in december of last year
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:24.000]  exactly and it is now being implemented by fda
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:29.040]  and what fda is doing is using its new power and new
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:34.480]  army of agents the bill will enable in the next several years the fda to have
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:40.320]  some 20 000 new inspectors and its aim this bill requires
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:44.640]  every food producer to be registered with the federal government for the
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:49.440]  first time in american history and by every food producer i mean everyone
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:53.600]  i'm talking about the organic food farmer
[02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:58.080]  who gets his food to the market he's going to have to register with the fda
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:01.920]  the farm that you're on right now mike the owner of that farm is going to
[02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:07.280]  have to register with the fda and in addition to registering with the fda
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:10.800]  he's going to have to be inspected by federal agents
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:16.560]  and they if they find anything remiss even if the products are perfectly safe
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:21.680]  if they find anything remiss on his farm they can do a re-inspection and
[02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:25.360]  charge him the cost of the inspection fda estimates
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:29.440]  that they will raise 100 million dollars that's a conservative estimate
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:33.200]  in the first year of implementation of this so just wait just to be clear here
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:37.760]  jonathan the the issue here is that these
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:41.600]  even small farms we're talking about small local farms
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:44.320]  people who are selling food at your local farmers market
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:48.240]  they are going to be in a government database as a food producer
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:54.080]  and they are going to have to apply or at least be be regulated by the fda all
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:56.400]  that talk remember during the food safety
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:00.240]  debate they said these small farmers are going to be exempt but that was a lie
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:03.520]  wasn't it they're not really exempt they still have to be in in the
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:06.560]  fda's database and abide by many regulations
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:09.680]  they're still going to have to register they're still going to have to be under
[02:40:09.680 --> 02:40:14.240]  fda scrutiny every food producer is under fda scrutiny right now
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:18.800]  the difference is that this bill puts into the fda's
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:23.040]  power base an enormous army of inspectors
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:27.760]  and a requirement a set of requirements that force these outfits to register
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:30.080]  with the federal government for the first time
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:35.600]  and that's that the big thing here is not this is this is not a food safety bill
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:40.480]  this is a federal government control bill this bill is designed to take away
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:45.040]  from the local health and safety people who are responsible for ensuring
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:50.480]  integrity of the local food market the power to make ultimate determinations
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:53.920]  and giving that to the centralized food and drug administration which has an
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:56.800]  axe to grind lobbied heavily by the major food
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:00.080]  producers lobby heavily by the drug industry
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:05.040]  when it comes to these small producers they have significantly created a
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:08.640]  economic threat to the market share of large food
[02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:12.400]  producers who are not organic well that's what this is john this is this is a
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:17.120]  declaration of war against small farmers i i already spoke i i have on camera
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:20.160]  farmers in texas who say because of this bill
[02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:23.680]  they are not going to expand they're not going to grow they're not going to hire
[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:26.880]  more people they're going to essentially start shutting down their food
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:29.840]  operations because they can't deal with the paperwork burden so this is going
[02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:33.840]  to drive small local farmers out of business and as you're explaining
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:38.160]  that's the entire point of the thing now if this weren't bad enough
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:42.400]  then you've got dick durbin who just introduced this is the liberal senator
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:47.280]  from illinois this fellow has absolutely nothing in common with the
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:49.840]  founding fathers of the united states in fact
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:53.600]  every principle the founding fathers believed in fundamentally
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:59.200]  he opposes to his very core and so it's not surprising that he is aggressively
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:03.440]  advocating federal government takeover of various market sectors
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:07.040]  and massive increases in federal spending and in
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:10.720]  regulation and he just introduced the bill called
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:15.920]  the dietary supplement labeling act now this bill will require every dietary
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:19.920]  supplement company to register with the food and drug administration
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:24.480]  but also will require them to turn over to the food and drug administration
[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:28.000]  a list of every ingredient and every product that they make
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:31.760]  as well as every label for every product they make and all
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:36.160]  advertising and promotional material what the fda
[02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:40.160]  commissioner will then do with that is evaluated and determine whether there's
[02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:44.640]  any possibility of risk that could arise from the products now of course
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:47.840]  every product ingredient in the world even water
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:51.200]  will at some dose level create a risk therefore
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:56.160]  at the discretion of the fda commissioner she can remove from the market or
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:59.840]  order you to stop selling any product now it gets worse than that so under the
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:05.520]  food safety modernization act the right to trial by juries taken away from
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:09.280]  anyone accused of violating the act you have to go through an
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:14.000]  administrative court at the fda so the very party that is accusing you of
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.600]  wrongdoing will try your case are you getting this folks are you
[02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:21.760]  getting this you can be hauled into a kangaroo court
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:26.960]  and face a a non-legal trial just a trumped up trial from the same people
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:30.000]  who accuse you based on their opinion saying that one of your
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.400]  ingredients may have some kind of health risk
[02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:36.080]  that isn't even proven right i mean they right they can just fabricate this in
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:41.280]  addition just like the the forfeiture laws
[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:44.640]  the the law here the food safety modernization act
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:49.600]  allows the fda to summarily take away your registration
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:54.240]  suspend your registration so you don't have the right to sell anything
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:58.000]  while the agency proceeds with the administrative process so
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:01.600]  they take away all your resources your funding
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:04.560]  while they try you in the administrative court so you can't defend
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:07.520]  yourself you can't you can't even afford an attorney
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:11.680]  so you're effectively guilty until proven innocent because they are taking away
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:16.560]  your ability to earn a living while they try you
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:20.160]  what jonathan what what is the reaction
[02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:24.160]  to this is i mean this is one of the key questions i wanted to ask you today
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:29.120]  is the dietary supplements industry pulling together in some way i mean i
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:31.920]  already heard from from bill faloon at the life extension
[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:34.640]  foundation he's interested in taking action on this
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:37.760]  some others i don't want to mention their names have talked to me about possible
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:41.280]  actions what are you hearing as the health freedom
[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:45.680]  attorney in the u.s of organization to help combat these
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:49.440]  ndi regulations for example you know this is a tragedy
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:53.760]  that i explained in the rise of tyranny and also in global censorship of health
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:57.600]  information this is a great tragedy because you see
[02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:02.480]  the dietary supplement market as the yeoman farmers in the
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:08.160]  in the organic market are today was a very vibrant independent you would say
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:13.840]  libertarian uh group of people who were anti-government
[02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:17.600]  and very much in favor of self-help and achieving things
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:21.040]  through hard work and honest living people that the founding fathers would
[02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:27.200]  have adored and that industry's leaders went to the FDA
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:30.800]  with a thing called the good manufacturing practice guidelines and
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:37.120]  they argued to the industry that you've got to work with the FDA
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:41.440]  you have to allow the FDA to regulate our industry more because if you don't
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:45.520]  they view us with this hostile regard and unless we befriend them and show them
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:48.400]  that we're good actors and that we make good products
[02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:52.400]  they're going to attack us and so they went in with this
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:56.800]  idiotic conception that if you allow the FDA to regulate
[02:45:56.800 --> 02:46:03.120]  products by your own agreement from the creation of them till they're
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:08.080]  they reach the market process controls over every aspect of production
[02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:12.480]  that the agency will like you but what has happened is they miscalculated
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:17.040]  their lobbying power exactly and what they did is give the
[02:46:17.040 --> 02:46:21.440]  drug industry the ability to destroy the supplement industry and the FDA
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:25.040]  the legal authority to come in and act as the proxy of the drug industry they
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:28.240]  miscalculated their lobbying power they're not it
[02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:33.200]  inside the FDA they said okay let's befriend the FDA let's play nice and
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:36.880]  then they'll treat us nice but the FDA turned out years of telling the
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:40.880]  industry that this was a mistake and arguing at the outset that they this
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:45.280]  is horrendous you shouldn't do this i've i've now had the
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:50.400]  word back from folks telling me hey we didn't realize it would go this way
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:54.160]  it's what you predicted then it's horrific for us now
[02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:57.760]  it hasn't gotten better it's so much worse
[02:46:57.760 --> 02:47:02.080]  that we we can barely take it and what's happened is the big guys
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:07.120]  are finding out that it's it's it's it's it's it's absolutely beyond the cost
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:10.400]  estimation they figured it was going to destroy them
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:13.920]  it's going to put them out of business it's going to slap them in the face next
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:17.520]  yeah i mean who who can afford the regulatory burden the paperwork burden
[02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:21.120]  you have to uh uh individually apply for every new ingredient that's been
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:24.320]  introduced since 1994 you have to turn in all your marketing
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:27.680]  materials i mean jonathan even the drug companies don't have to provide all
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:31.280]  this documentation right and what's really tragic about this when you take
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:35.600]  into account the FDA's recent proposal for
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:40.800]  guidance for new dietary ingredients is that they're squeezing the supplement
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:45.440]  industry from every angle you've got an increased cost on the order of
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:48.640]  approximately a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year for the average
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:51.840]  supplement company and the average supplement company only makes profits of
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:56.160]  about a hundred thousand at most a year so you've got a hundred and fifty
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:47:59.680]  thousand dollars of regulatory costs from gmp enforcement
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:03.520]  you've got to top that the new food safety modernization act which requires
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:07.920]  registration additional legal fees for that and inspections and require you to
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:11.680]  pay for the cost of the inspection atop that you have this
[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:15.600]  a new movement by durbin to get make every supplement company register
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:19.840]  so you've got costs upon cost upon cost risks that are higher
[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:23.680]  and and this adds to what it adds to the cost of the products
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:27.520]  you have to pass it on to the consumers it limits the
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:31.440]  it limits the variety of products in the marketplace so consumers have less
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:35.120]  option fewer options it increases unemployment in a
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:41.360]  sector that is that the quintessential medium to small
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:46.000]  business sector that is responsible for the growth of the economy so you
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  crush it so you add to unemployment that's that's the thing i mean we are
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:53.600]  we are in in economic time right now where jobs are scarce
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:58.080]  where industries are leaving america and we have we have an abundant natural
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:01.760]  health supplement industry that's contributing tens of billions of
[02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:05.680]  dollars to the economy and now this industry is under threat of being
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:09.120]  essentially crushed or a large part of it based on these
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:13.280]  regulations it's almost as if they're literally just trying
[02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:17.520]  to destroy our economy and our health at the same time
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:21.600]  well for those who want the end to be that the government the parasite that
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:25.440]  is government suck the life's blood out of everything that is private
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:29.280]  that pays the bills for the government they'll achieve a collapse of the
[02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:33.040]  private sector at this rate now they're going to find
[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:35.840]  the hard reality of destroying the private sector is
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:39.440]  self-destruction for the parasite but that's a way off
[02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:42.560]  in the interim they're going to seize as much power as they can and this is the
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:47.200]  Durban plan this is the method by which he hopes and and several in the
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:50.560]  administration he's the fellow senator with uh
[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:55.520]  with obama from illinois this is their goal their goal is to make the private
[02:49:55.520 --> 02:49:59.360]  sector function only in the way they they plan
[02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:03.440]  and to eliminate freedom to the extent that it it works for something they
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:06.480]  either disagree with or don't understand in the case of the supplement
[02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:10.720]  market Durban has a very shallow understanding of nutrition
[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:14.960]  and he thinks that it's all a build with a bunch of quackpots and the people
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:18.320]  who use supplements have got to be out of their mind all right hold on hold on
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:21.040]  jonathan i tell you i wouldn't i wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:24.480]  nutritional supplements and i certainly wouldn't be able to to

[02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:18.160]  it's true total government control of electricity
[02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:21.680]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:25.280]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:52:25.280 --> 02:52:29.200]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:32.720]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids

[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:35.200]  the FDA's new regulations to try to approve or deny
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:38.880]  any supplement ingredients that have been introduced since 1994
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:43.280]  as well as additional information on the implementation of the food safety
[02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:46.240]  modernization act which really should be called
[02:54:46.240 --> 02:54:49.280]  throw the farmers back to the stone age act because that's what it's really
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:51.520]  doing jonathan are you still with us on the phone
[02:54:51.520 --> 02:54:55.520]  i am all right man thanks thanks for joining us today
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:55:02.480]  i gotta ask you what hope do we have as freedom loving individuals to take back
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:05.920]  control over our food over our medicine to have
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:10.000]  health freedom and first amendment rights for our dietary supplements what
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:13.440]  can we do to win this fight against tyranny
[02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:17.680]  well in in my book the rise of tyranny i explained the way back to liberty at
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:21.520]  the end of the book and and i explained this whole problem
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:25.760]  we started with a country that was a republic a constitutional republic
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:29.760]  the most brilliant construction in the history of mankind
[02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:34.160]  in government and that was because it placed sovereignty with the individual
[02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:39.120]  it trusted that the individual would be responsible for the existence of the
[02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:41.840]  government just governments are instituted among them to protect the
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:44.960]  rights of the government our declaration of independence says
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:49.120]  and just governments exist only based on the consent of the government well
[02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:52.160]  sovereignty has been wrenched from the individual
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:54.800]  placed in the hands of bureaucrats in washington
[02:55:54.800 --> 02:55:58.400]  we've transformed this republic into a bureaucratic oligarchy
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:01.920]  nine-tenths of all federal laws not the product of those we elect
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:04.720]  but the product of the unelected heads of the bureaucracy
[02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:08.720]  that is the gist of the problem and the solution to the problem lies in
[02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:12.560]  reversing that and there is legislation that i've written for ron paul that
[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:16.720]  would do that very thing uh and there's also legislation on these
[02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:20.080]  health issues that would get the fda out of this business
[02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:24.000]  of second-guessing consumers and their right to determine what is in their own
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:27.680]  best interest now real quickly how can people stay

[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:20.960]  well we were born a free people we should remain that way and we have to take
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:23.920]  back our liberty we have to vote out of office the bad

[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:44.560]  so you get a big picture view of of what we're talking about here
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:48.160]  we talked to julie bass remember the gardener from oak park michigan being
[02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:52.000]  threatened with jail time for her crime of growing organic
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:56.080]  vegetables in her own yard and teaching her children how to grow seeds as well
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:59.600]  because that's a crime well you can't grow vegetable gardens in your front yard
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:03.600]  but as jeffrey smith brought us in the second hour of today's show
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:09.600]  you can soon plant genetically modified grass and spray your lawn with roundup
[02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:13.120]  oh yes we're going to have roundup chemicals in neighborhoods all across
[02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:16.720]  america we heard from paul joseph watson we heard from erin dykes and of
