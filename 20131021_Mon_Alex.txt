[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:36.440]  well now that oh vomit excuse me oh bozo oh trader oh globalist oh banker frontman
[00:36.440 --> 00:44.880]  oh foreign new world order occupier puppeteer and puppet himself Obama now
[00:44.880 --> 00:50.960]  that he has been forced to cover healthcare.gov instead of distracting
[00:50.960 --> 00:57.120]  people with the so-called partial government shutdown folks are freaking
[00:57.120 --> 01:00.440]  out as they learn that nobody can sign up that it's doubling premiums bare
[01:00.440 --> 01:05.560]  minimum and even consumer reports has come out and said stay away from
[01:05.560 --> 01:12.520]  healthcare.gov because it's a giant scam and basically steals your
[01:12.520 --> 01:18.480]  data we told you this two weeks ago when it launched any computer programmer
[01:18.480 --> 01:23.000]  could go and see that that it wasn't just broken it was a fraud the truth is
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.520]  they don't want to implement the so-called freebie parts of it and they
[01:27.520 --> 01:31.400]  never will they're only going to implement the tax part where you get
[01:31.400 --> 01:38.160]  five thousand dollar fines and more when you can't sign up for it so the goal is
[01:38.160 --> 01:41.480]  that you not be able to sign up for it and then it just becomes something like
[01:41.480 --> 01:46.800]  the Israeli Palestinian peace process it just turns into this new system of
[01:46.800 --> 01:51.200]  where healthcare is all screwed up and costs more and the insurance companies
[01:51.200 --> 01:55.560]  can do whatever they want they're the same ones that screwed up healthcare the
[01:55.560 --> 01:59.880]  big ones and who wrote it to shut down their competition and who wrote it to
[01:59.880 --> 02:05.240]  lower the quality of care if doesn't matter the lottery ticket crowd and I'm
[02:05.240 --> 02:08.440]  not saying you're a bad person we buy a lottery ticket for fun and it's
[02:08.440 --> 02:11.520]  something you like to do for the suspense or whatever that you know you
[02:11.520 --> 02:15.160]  might be struck by a meteorite when you sit there and tune in and watch the show
[02:15.160 --> 02:17.620]  because you've got about as good a chance of winning a big lottery as being
[02:17.620 --> 02:23.320]  you know hit by a meteorite or struck by lightning three times in one year but
[02:23.320 --> 02:26.080]  the only thing that's more rare than winning a major lottery is being struck
[02:26.080 --> 02:29.160]  by meteorite so you actually have a better chance of winning a lottery it's
[02:29.160 --> 02:35.200]  true but it's that same mentality of folks that really think well it doesn't
[02:35.200 --> 02:39.960]  matter if I got big bills and I'm going bankrupt I'm gonna go take my entire
[02:39.960 --> 02:47.160]  welfare check and I'm gonna go fence it for cash so I can go buy $500 worth of
[02:47.160 --> 02:52.960]  lottery tickets and then you go buy your $500 worth of lottery tickets and you
[02:52.960 --> 02:58.520]  sit there desperately and you don't win anything or you go buy the other type of
[02:58.520 --> 03:03.200]  scratch off stuff and you spend $500 and you you'll win 300 but still feel like
[03:03.200 --> 03:07.880]  you won 300 even though you lost 200 that mindset is what they're counting on
[03:07.880 --> 03:11.880]  people are just gonna clamor and they're not gonna get mad and say we don't
[03:11.880 --> 03:15.880]  want Obamacare now they're gonna say do whatever you got to do to make it work
[03:15.880 --> 03:20.200]  and anybody that's against Obamacare you're the ones are now messing it up
[03:20.200 --> 03:26.920]  and I told you this was coming Obama says that it's been a big success we've
[03:26.920 --> 03:33.040]  got his rose garden speech coming up he's saying it's been a big success and
[03:33.040 --> 03:39.640]  he's blamed the problems with it on the government shutdown I told you that was
[03:39.640 --> 03:41.920]  coming I just know how their brain works
[03:41.920 --> 03:46.600]  before they were even saying any of this I said last week I said you watch
[03:46.600 --> 03:50.520]  they are going to blame this on the government shutdown even though
[03:50.520 --> 03:57.920]  healthcare.gov came out right before it up on drudgereport.com

[09:58.920 --> 10:04.200]  Obama just completed a rose garden speech and some woman collapsed Obama
[10:04.200 --> 10:09.920]  calls in techies for the fix calling it a new Manhattan project to get it
[10:09.920 --> 10:15.600]  repaired well you can't fix what was designed to be broken best and brightest
[10:15.600 --> 10:23.080]  drafted emergency SOS issued hospitals face whole new world under
[10:23.080 --> 10:27.040]  Obamacare Sebelius will not testify before Congress even though she's been
[10:27.040 --> 10:31.480]  ordered to appear five million lines of software code needs to be rewritten
[10:31.480 --> 10:35.520]  we've had software engineers on two and a half weeks ago who showed copies of the
[10:35.520 --> 10:40.640]  code on TV for our radio listeners and they can always go to infowars.com
[10:40.640 --> 10:45.240]  for its last show and see the free video feed but we actually showed the code
[10:45.240 --> 10:50.920]  in articles on infowars.com that Mike Adams first broke for natural news.com
[10:50.920 --> 10:56.360]  dealing with this where it was designed to not work it wasn't just bad code it
[10:56.360 --> 11:04.240]  was gibberish it was just having 14 monkeys chained up to word processors
[11:04.240 --> 11:11.360]  feeding them a mixture of PCP mountain dew and hot pockets and methamphetamine
[11:11.360 --> 11:17.400]  just wildly typing I mean they didn't say all work and no play makes Jack a
[11:17.400 --> 11:22.800]  dull boy over and over again all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy I mean
[11:22.800 --> 11:25.440]  that would have least said something even though it was said hundreds and
[11:25.440 --> 11:29.680]  hundreds of times in the shining no no I mean that at least made some sense at
[11:29.680 --> 11:38.160]  least it to me but the point is is that we're dealing with monkeys on PCP and
[11:38.160 --> 11:42.600]  mountain dew chained up typing this as a complete joke on everyone and now they
[11:42.600 --> 11:47.120]  can take six months a year whatever to quote make it work and by then you'll
[11:47.120 --> 11:53.920]  just be accustomed to the fact that you now just have to pay giant fines if you
[11:53.920 --> 11:58.480]  don't have the original healthcare system and that the insurance companies are
[11:58.480 --> 12:02.840]  allowed to double the premiums on you bare minimum while lowering the type of
[12:02.840 --> 12:07.760]  care you get and then getting rid of original charity care that's why 15
[12:07.760 --> 12:11.880]  years ago they faced out do no harm the Hippocratic oath of medicine because now
[12:11.880 --> 12:16.560]  it's exterminate people as fast as possible for the New World Order kill
[12:16.560 --> 12:21.640]  one granny higher-ten teachers Allah Bill Gates Allah the case for killing
[12:21.640 --> 12:28.160]  granny Newsweek cover so I told you this is the plan and this is how
[12:28.160 --> 12:33.840]  pirates operate and believe me they are laughing intensely over this right now
[12:33.840 --> 12:41.920]  because the lottery ticket mentality of the obozo followers clearly states that
[12:41.920 --> 12:48.200]  the law of the the the lottery ticket purchaser and again I'm not saying you're
[12:48.200 --> 12:51.720]  bad if you buy by an occasional lot of tickets for fun or as a diversion but
[12:51.720 --> 12:55.000]  people that really think that's that's their business plan in life is they're
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.200]  gonna win a big multimillion dollar lottery again they've got a better
[12:58.200 --> 13:03.640]  chance of finding a leprechaun of the pot of gold at the end of it or maybe a
[13:03.640 --> 13:08.280]  unicorn in their backyard I mean this is ridiculous they are going to now
[13:08.280 --> 13:12.880]  defend the program even more and say that anyone that criticizes it you're
[13:12.880 --> 13:18.120]  the ones keeping them from their goody because vicious offshore banks that run
[13:18.120 --> 13:23.240]  giant death camp operations in China with suicide nets they're liberal and
[13:23.240 --> 13:27.640]  trendy and these big mega banks that wrote the obozo care they really love
[13:27.640 --> 13:32.440]  poor Americans even though they set up total slave grids worldwide in this
[13:32.440 --> 13:35.920]  exception they really want to give you something free because they care about
[13:35.920 --> 13:41.440]  you and want to take long walks down forest paths with you and kiss you all
[13:41.440 --> 13:45.000]  day they're not predators they're not vicious you didn't get scammed you
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.520]  didn't get had those of us that don't like Obamacare and we're right about it
[13:49.520 --> 13:54.760]  we're the bad men and indeed that's now being said obozo is said during his
[13:54.760 --> 14:02.240]  press conference that the glitches are due to the government shutdown and that
[14:02.240 --> 14:06.480]  it's quote a really good deal and wait it gets better he just finished his
[14:06.480 --> 14:11.160]  speech a few minutes ago we're gonna get this clip this is the best part
[14:11.160 --> 14:18.560]  exceeding expectations oh yes and actually it is it actually is exceeding
[14:18.560 --> 14:23.360]  expectations in a big way because they've been able to already more than
[14:23.360 --> 14:28.080]  double the average premium and more than triple the average deductible from
[14:28.080 --> 14:37.160]  around $2,000 to around $6,400 so it is exceeding the the expectation of the
[14:37.160 --> 14:42.600]  raping the American people with a giant red-hot poker while pouring acid over
[14:42.600 --> 14:48.200]  your head I mean yes it is a great deal kind of like when Al Gore on Larry King
[14:48.200 --> 14:55.480]  live back in 1993 said Larry this is a good deal don't listen to Ross Perot
[14:55.480 --> 15:03.600]  NAFTA and Gad will raise our wages which actually have gone down not just the
[15:03.600 --> 15:09.800]  inflation but literal wages according to 1993 numbers are down compared to that
[15:09.800 --> 15:19.640]  date just in cold hard cash but see Al Gore Al Gore Al Gore he said it was a
[15:19.640 --> 15:29.480]  good deal and the unions all signed on to it because they like Democrats and how
[15:29.480 --> 15:35.600]  did that go for you NAFTA and Gad I couldn't laugh I'm just sorry I was
[15:35.600 --> 15:39.720]  actually out there up for the show started in the coffee room and he was up
[15:39.720 --> 15:44.240]  on television and I heard him say that I heard him say that it's exceeded
[15:44.240 --> 15:48.440]  expectations and as he looked back and forth at the teleprompter and I just
[15:48.440 --> 15:53.040]  cannot handle it anymore with this group of morons surrounding him all getting
[15:53.040 --> 15:58.880]  off on being near the president I mean I just cannot imagine it excuse me I'm
[15:58.880 --> 16:03.840]  kind of having a meltdown here of my own Obama health care website problems
[16:03.840 --> 16:08.360]  inexcusable though but that the health care deal itself is exceeding
[16:08.360 --> 16:13.360]  expectations and is a good deal and he's hiring an emergency team to get in
[16:13.360 --> 16:18.560]  there and fix it as soon as they can and if we don't stand up to these folks
[16:18.560 --> 16:22.480]  will they'll be having health care summits 10 years from now like the
[16:22.480 --> 16:28.360]  Middle Eastern Israeli a Palestinian peace process total diversion there is
[16:28.360 --> 16:32.560]  no peace process it's just a way to keep it going off into the future as part of
[16:32.560 --> 16:37.560]  a fake process forever this is the same thing the bill is a success just like
[16:37.560 --> 16:41.640]  the drug war is a success for the big six banks that launder 500 billion
[16:41.640 --> 16:45.600]  North American dollars a year over a trillion worldwide controlling the
[16:45.600 --> 16:49.840]  narcotics trade owning the aircraft funding the mercenaries loaning them
[16:49.840 --> 16:53.640]  the money for the arms it's an incredible success having the biggest
[16:53.640 --> 16:57.680]  prison population in the world filled with nonviolent offenders working for
[16:57.680 --> 17:02.240]  the big narcotics cartels and the banks that own the private prisons the drug
[17:02.240 --> 17:07.000]  war is a smashing total absolute devastating success for the crime
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.240]  syndicates who also run the child kidnapping rings and other things on
[17:10.240 --> 17:17.320]  the side publicly so big success there the Obamacare is a devastating success
[17:17.320 --> 17:22.560]  Obama is a devastating success for the new world order crushing the lemmings
[17:22.560 --> 17:27.000]  crushing the American people shutting down the power plants federalizing the
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.400]  schools but trying to open the borders up legalizing the illegals to drive down
[17:31.400 --> 17:36.360]  wages by fiat he's just devastating the Republic right now but he'll be called a
[17:36.360 --> 17:39.960]  failure and fade off into the distance but it won't matter he would have gotten
[17:39.960 --> 17:45.000]  his job done so every hats off to Obama if you love the new world order and are
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.520]  rooting for the 6,000 globalist superclass show emergency surgery oh
[17:49.520 --> 17:53.640]  why he is like an hellraiser when one of the guys is gonna do surgery on

[34:06.680 --> 34:10.600]  transmission your phone calls are coming up by the way I told you I've been
[34:10.600 --> 34:16.840]  doing deep research into water fluoridation now it began the 1920s in
[34:16.840 --> 34:22.480]  the first gulag set up by linen and then Stalin and how Hitler during the
[34:22.480 --> 34:29.600]  Russian German pact that they had to split up Poland was advised on how to put
[34:29.600 --> 34:36.280]  bromine and sodium fluoride in the water and of course that had actually come
[34:36.280 --> 34:42.000]  from England in the US where they would give kids bromine and other pills and
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.480]  now I'm pull up all the mainstream articles I've actually been able to
[34:44.480 --> 34:48.800]  pull up we're putting a commercial together for the iodine we sell actually
[34:48.800 --> 34:54.800]  showing magazine ads from 1910 1912 of the ones we found advertising these
[34:54.800 --> 35:02.080]  different bromine fluoride pills that you would give people who were hyperactive
[35:02.080 --> 35:07.120]  or who were upset or kids that weren't you know doing what you're told it would
[35:07.120 --> 35:12.280]  turn them into zombies basically and I actually found a medical report on this
[35:12.280 --> 35:20.240]  an actual medical paper by Guy E. Abraham medical doctor breaking down this
[35:20.240 --> 35:24.320]  program I want to show TV viewers this I'm gonna go to your phone calls here it
[35:24.320 --> 35:30.440]  was on page 20 of this study quotes a bunch of studies this medical paper
[35:30.440 --> 35:36.760]  therefore bromine has a zombifying potential why iodine was replaced with
[35:36.760 --> 35:44.800]  G-O-I-T-O-R-G-E-N possessing carcinogenic and zombifying potentials in a
[35:44.800 --> 35:49.160]  population already very iodine deficient even by very low RDA standard
[35:49.160 --> 35:53.200]  remains a mystery nevertheless it is very effective way to keep a nation sick
[35:53.200 --> 35:58.480]  and zombified this is a medical paper this is from 2004 but I've got papers
[35:58.480 --> 36:06.560]  from 1890s and 1920 and all of it and then of course so now I've learned it's
[36:06.560 --> 36:12.120]  not just in Pulitzer Prize winning books about World War two two of them it's
[36:12.120 --> 36:17.360]  all in and the Nuremberg trials it this this was old technology being used in
[36:17.360 --> 36:21.480]  England in the United States you'd go to the local drugs store the apothecary and
[36:21.480 --> 36:25.760]  say my kids are not doing what I told them they're jumping around whatever
[36:25.760 --> 36:30.880]  they just giving these pills and then you would give them to people to make
[36:30.880 --> 36:37.400]  them behave and they would also put other chemicals like salt peter until the
[36:37.400 --> 36:42.760]  50s on young people at camp in the summer when you had boys and girls camps
[36:42.760 --> 36:47.320]  together so they wouldn't have sex I mean this is a whole chemical weapons
[36:47.320 --> 36:52.480]  program and I know that I know it and you know it but I mean it's all documented
[36:52.480 --> 36:59.280]  mainline history why they put bromine and fluoride in the water they're all in
[36:59.280 --> 37:05.920]  the same we show folks periodic table right here the halides discovery
[37:05.920 --> 37:14.440]  chronological order chloride was found in eight chloride was found in 1809 in
[37:14.440 --> 37:20.960]  France iodine was found in France in 1811
[37:20.960 --> 37:32.920]  bromide was found in France in 1826 fluoride was found in France in 1886 and
[37:32.920 --> 37:41.320]  they discovered another halide in the US in 19 or statin yeah a statin but the
[37:41.320 --> 37:46.040]  point is you can see these on the periodic table basically and you notice
[37:46.040 --> 37:49.960]  now they're wanting to put the statins in the water ladies and gentlemen this is
[37:49.960 --> 37:54.600]  a chemical warfare operation and I know we know that I always mention it but I
[37:54.600 --> 37:57.320]  never show it anymore were you gonna give me that eco science over there real
[37:57.320 --> 38:01.280]  quick you guys walk in front of the cameras it's fine thank you you can
[38:01.280 --> 38:07.760]  read from 1974 when they published it the White House science are talking about
[38:07.760 --> 38:14.840]  it and you realize that no wonder Americans can't resist anything no
[38:14.840 --> 38:19.560]  wonder people act like zombies we have a lower IQ and lower brainwaves thank you
[38:19.560 --> 38:25.720]  we have been hit by chemical warfare by the way this book was showing for like
[38:25.720 --> 38:31.120]  $10 on eBay and places until I started plugging it five years ago talking
[38:31.120 --> 38:35.160]  about it so it was then selling for thousands in some cases there's no need
[38:35.160 --> 38:38.720]  to buy an original the whole thing's been scanned in by major universities and
[38:38.720 --> 38:45.320]  his online eco science population resources and environment and this was
[38:45.320 --> 38:51.840]  adopted by the early 80s as official US government policy so just like State
[38:51.840 --> 38:58.840]  Department of Random 200 was so I would suggest that's one more thing about
[38:58.840 --> 39:02.400]  having a big syndicate radio show I can like make any book I want if it's a rare
[39:02.400 --> 39:06.160]  book super rare that was on our intention it's just we've noticed that
[39:06.160 --> 39:10.800]  happens but here's eco science you read the whole thing free online Paul are
[39:10.800 --> 39:16.200]  earlick who says reduced population by 90% his wife Annie earlick and John P
[39:16.200 --> 39:24.720]  Holdren and the point is you can argue there's too many people but the issue is
[39:24.720 --> 39:28.120]  they're doing it to everybody and they're trying to reduce population in the
[39:28.120 --> 39:31.600]  most advanced nations and then they're trying to block development the third
[39:31.600 --> 39:35.480]  world which would actually reduce third-world populations but at a
[39:35.480 --> 39:40.000]  manageable happy level where you know the average person has like 1.3 kids like
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.280]  every other industrialized country then you've actually got a problem of
[39:43.280 --> 39:47.920]  collapse of civilization we need 2.1 that's sustainable once you build a
[39:47.920 --> 39:51.920]  civilization this big if you don't have sustainability little numbers all the
[39:51.920 --> 39:56.520]  statistics and actuary show you have collapse of society but that's why
[39:56.520 --> 40:00.920]  they're building into 21 to create that artificial collapse that is going to be
[40:00.920 --> 40:05.040]  quite hellish where you don't have enough people to take care of the old folks
[40:05.040 --> 40:11.360]  by the way there are less people in the West by about 1.4 every two baby boomers
[40:11.360 --> 40:16.160]  born there's about 1.4 on average if you average in Japan Italy Germany the US
[40:16.160 --> 40:20.720]  Canada all the industrialized nations there's about 1.4 some places are as
[40:20.720 --> 40:26.280]  low as 1.2 but about 1.4 on average you need 2.1 just to take care of the old
[40:26.280 --> 40:33.160]  people every two parents have 2.1 children in the average at 1.4 it is
[40:33.160 --> 40:37.960]  they're going to euthanize all of you so just be ready and then folks that are my
[40:37.960 --> 40:42.840]  age I'm already now 40 40 in a couple months they're gonna euthanize my butt
[40:42.840 --> 40:46.720]  real fat no matter how much money I got doesn't matter if I'm not an insider I'm
[40:46.720 --> 40:50.480]  not gonna get life extension none of it and none of you are as well you yuppies
[40:50.480 --> 40:53.240]  out there that think you're part of the power structure as you can go to some
[40:53.240 --> 40:57.120]  Obama event or some Republican event have them patch you on the head all right
[40:57.120 --> 41:00.960]  I said I'd go to your phone calls my point is is that we've sold out of the
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.160]  most amazing nation iodine out there the consumer reviews are coming in we're
[41:06.160 --> 41:09.400]  going to be doing some articles on those some people are blown away by it this
[41:09.400 --> 41:13.480]  stuff on record you can see all the details and facts and informers wife
[41:13.480 --> 41:19.000]  calm is a shield against the fluoride the bromide the bromine the garbage a
[41:19.000 --> 41:24.080]  detoxifier and a shield against new fluoride it is survival shield and it's
[41:24.080 --> 41:27.600]  the only proprietary nason iodine when I had my dad look into this about three
[41:27.600 --> 41:31.200]  months ago when I looked into manufacturing it myself from the only
[41:31.200 --> 41:35.560]  lab in the country that can do it put out small amounts he went he said my
[41:35.560 --> 41:39.320]  gosh this is the National Federation of scientists and all these special
[41:39.320 --> 41:43.600]  certifications and some special machine the only one in the country and my
[41:43.600 --> 41:46.440]  goodness this is special stuff because I had him doing due diligence and
[41:46.440 --> 41:50.200]  everything because he's a oral surgeon and a dentist and also you know has a
[41:50.200 --> 41:56.280]  degree in biology there's also developed patented drugs separately and he said
[41:56.280 --> 41:59.880]  man this stuff is something else this isn't regular iodine and so that's the
[41:59.880 --> 42:03.040]  point I'm getting across to you folks we only bring you the most amazing stuff
[42:03.040 --> 42:08.640]  the problem is is that they are having to expand and they're done now they put
[42:08.640 --> 42:13.080]  it in a bigger bottling system that have a bunch of zoning stuff done and a
[42:13.080 --> 42:17.200]  bunch of inspectors and you know just had the FDA back in for it and
[42:17.200 --> 42:21.640]  everything to crank up to produce on enough to be able to supply everybody
[42:21.640 --> 42:26.200]  so you they're making it right now it'll be here in about two weeks you want to
[42:26.200 --> 42:30.400]  be first in line to get the most amazing nason iodine out there this is it
[42:30.400 --> 42:35.480]  folks true atomic iodine the thyroid and so much more and then it supercharges
[42:35.480 --> 42:38.560]  according to all the experts we've had on all the other natural hormone levels
[42:38.560 --> 42:46.800]  my only problem is everybody's noticed it I am literally crazed now I have like
[42:46.800 --> 42:53.320]  double the energy folks to have double the energy no no obviously not not not
[42:53.320 --> 42:57.160]  not twice the craziness but no I mean I'm I'm just supercharged well I mean go
[42:57.160 --> 43:03.640]  ahead and come on air CJ am I how have I been the last two months on this you've
[43:03.640 --> 43:07.720]  been more aware more more fast-paced quick to notice things you didn't
[43:07.720 --> 43:14.080]  previously yeah it's it's incredible and that's exactly what Dr. Group said but
[43:14.080 --> 43:16.960]  anyways we'll see what happens for you out there your vision's been sharper you
[43:16.960 --> 43:21.120]  see things you don't normally notice we can't keep anything from you are you
[43:21.120 --> 43:30.400]  on air saying all that yes anyways the point is is that I'm telling you folks
[43:30.400 --> 43:35.600]  they don't want you to be healthy they put bromide and fluoride in the stinking
[43:35.600 --> 43:40.440]  water and food to turn you into a zombie I can't imagine what I would be like if
[43:40.440 --> 43:45.600]  I had not been exposed to fluoride most of my life and had had proper levels
[43:45.600 --> 43:49.120]  iodine I guess I've always ate a lot of red meat my mom's always used gourmet
[43:49.120 --> 43:53.400]  salts and and try to always get organic food so I guess I've had a leg up even
[43:53.400 --> 43:56.880]  though I've had a lot of bad things in my lifestyle as well I didn't mean to go
[43:56.880 --> 44:05.200]  off into a long plug in fourslife.com or 888-253-3139 they have a patented on
[44:05.200 --> 44:09.040]  record way at the laboratory we use to make this stuff and it's the first of a
[44:09.040 --> 44:12.160]  long line of products we're developing the problem is is they were waiting for
[44:12.160 --> 44:15.480]  one thing from the Himalayas that comes out of the rocks I've been waiting like
[44:15.480 --> 44:19.240]  three months for this giant purchase of that to come in just to mix it with this
[44:19.240 --> 44:22.760]  detox thing we're coming out with and we could just throw stuff in a bottle and
[44:22.760 --> 44:25.720]  sell it but I'm not going to do that I'm going to promote the best stuff out
[44:25.720 --> 44:30.560]  there that is revolutionary against the globalist so again in fourslife.com or
[44:30.560 --> 44:36.400]  888-253-3139 enough of me I want to get into Obamacare if you want to read
[44:36.400 --> 44:44.840]  that study it's the safe and effective implementation of ortho dose
[44:44.840 --> 44:49.440]  supplementation am I pronouncing that right the safe and effective
[44:49.440 --> 44:54.640]  implementation of ortho dose supplementation in medical practice is that
[44:54.640 --> 45:02.680]  right by doctor how do you say it ortho iota is Richard Reeves brought me this
[45:02.680 --> 45:05.560]  study because he was digging around through all these studies about how
[45:05.560 --> 45:10.960]  they would shell stuff in drug stores in the 18 you know 50s on till I give your
[45:10.960 --> 45:16.600]  kids to make them zombie so they behave they just said hey put it in the water
[45:16.600 --> 45:24.280]  for everybody all right I'm sorry here's some of the other news we've got them
[45:24.280 --> 45:29.080]  we're going to your calls food stamps benefits going down before the holidays
[45:29.080 --> 45:33.520]  millions of American families could face the sparse holiday table when food
[45:33.520 --> 45:36.880]  step benefits get reduced in November and that could be just part of a deeper
[45:36.880 --> 45:41.800]  cuts to the program to feed poor families the modern-day food stamp plan
[45:41.800 --> 45:45.800]  now called the supplemental nutritional assistance program is scheduled to scale
[45:45.800 --> 45:56.680]  back and it's got these women all on there well I guess I'm gonna be able to
[45:56.680 --> 46:03.040]  get food look at those poor ladies imagine that they had I don't know I'm
[46:03.040 --> 46:09.320]  sorry I just it's just very sad and it just goes over the whole point of the
[46:09.320 --> 46:13.160]  snap program is going to be cut because Obama's been reelected now they got to
[46:13.160 --> 46:16.360]  give those extra hundreds of billions to foreign banks so you're not gonna be
[46:16.360 --> 46:20.760]  getting your food stamps so there you go but don't worry homeland security with
[46:20.760 --> 46:24.720]  armored vehicles is standing by if you don't like it let's go ahead see they
[46:24.720 --> 46:28.360]  ship your jobs out shut down the economy raise the taxes on businesses so they
[46:28.360 --> 46:31.800]  can't hire you and then you just become domesticated and look these social
[46:31.800 --> 46:35.120]  engineers know that's when you go to a park they say don't feed the pigeons
[46:35.120 --> 46:41.800]  don't feed the aquatic life don't feed the squirrels because they'll become
[46:41.800 --> 46:45.360]  domesticated and won't be able to take care of themselves but when it comes to
[46:45.360 --> 46:49.800]  the general population that's what they want let's go ahead and talk to Beth in
[46:49.800 --> 46:54.240]  Tennessee Beth give us your take on Obamacare and what you think of it hi
[46:54.240 --> 47:03.000]  Alex hi I think Obamacare is a rape of the American citizen insurance for my
[47:03.000 --> 47:07.920]  husband and I have now gone up $600 for the year we have higher deductibles
[47:07.920 --> 47:14.960]  higher co-pay less treatment we're just upset about the whole mass are you a
[47:14.960 --> 47:21.080]  racist are you a racist I am not a racist I served in the Army we saw green
[47:21.080 --> 47:24.760]  that's the only color we saw well ma'am ma'am you know if you criticize anything
[47:24.760 --> 47:30.000]  Obama does your racist MSNBC Senate you want to apologize for your racism I do
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.680]  not apologize I apologize that there aren't enough people in our country awake
[47:34.680 --> 47:39.880]  and they they don't get rid of all of this crap that's going on I have a
[47:39.880 --> 47:44.160]  story and this is why I got on the phone with you today not we listen every day
[47:44.160 --> 47:49.280]  present planet customers thank you ma'am your magazine delivered we had
[47:49.280 --> 47:54.760]  the probe here filled are we just up the iodine thank you we do all of Dr. Wollick's
[47:54.760 --> 47:58.760]  drugs anyway or not drugs nutrients well nutrients are basically like drugs
[47:58.760 --> 48:06.400]  for that I know my husband and I are off work on Monday so we went to the
[48:06.400 --> 48:12.280]  grocery store this morning I would need a one-drink alcohol too much but we were
[48:12.280 --> 48:17.120]  going down the aisle saw the woodchuck fall hard cider with the nutmeg and what
[48:17.120 --> 48:21.520]  not and I said Tom I want to get some of that so we get to the checkout lane and
[48:21.520 --> 48:26.600]  I get carted and I said you know this is an honor I haven't been carted since I
[48:26.600 --> 48:34.920]  was 21 30 years ago so she said well we can't finish this transaction until you
[48:34.920 --> 48:40.240]  know we get ID now and so yeah and at first the feds started this telling
[48:40.240 --> 48:43.480]  corporations do it about a decade ago first they would just look at it then
[48:43.480 --> 48:46.520]  they would enter the date of birth now they swipe it and it's going into a
[48:46.520 --> 48:51.160]  healthcare database they're phasing it in slave training did she swipe your
[48:51.160 --> 48:56.840]  card I don't know but when I know I've seen them I've seen them as a test buying
[48:56.840 --> 49:01.440]  alcohol they will swipe it and it's going into a database at the larger stores
[49:01.440 --> 49:05.080]  they're phasing it in and this is getting you ready for when you'll have to do
[49:05.080 --> 49:09.040]  that to buy and sell even when you use cash as part of the cashless society
[49:09.040 --> 49:14.240]  control grid exactly well I didn't it got me more upset and by the time we got
[49:14.240 --> 49:21.880]  home I said do you suppose they swipe my card well then this clerk proceeded to say that they now
[49:21.880 --> 49:27.000]  have the card for lighter fluid I said you have got to be kidding me and she
[49:27.000 --> 49:32.520]  said no the government says that it's for use in drugs and they actually send
[49:32.520 --> 49:37.720]  government people in and pretend just so they make sure people yeah and again
[49:37.720 --> 49:42.360]  there's no law they started it with a suit of Fedran and then did pass state
[49:42.360 --> 49:45.240]  laws but no they're just doing it until everything you're going to be carted
[49:45.240 --> 49:48.840]  for everything they admit they have these big consortium meetings with all
[49:48.840 --> 49:52.800]  the big IT people and the digital biometrics companies we've covered it
[49:52.800 --> 49:57.400]  on air where they say you're not just going to get carted in the future to buy
[49:57.400 --> 50:01.160]  and sell you're going to have an implantable microchip this is official
[50:01.160 --> 50:05.640]  the head of Google came out and said you will soon have brain chips to use the
[50:05.640 --> 50:15.760]  phone to our top military brass active and retired and anybody else in our
[50:15.760 --> 50:20.400]  federal agencies that have the power and the knowledge to know what's going on so
[50:20.400 --> 50:25.200]  they can do what they need to do right remove all of our politicians out get
[50:25.200 --> 50:31.080]  them out of there all of them not one is worth anything Alex we need to do
[50:31.080 --> 50:35.400]  something and we will gather if those well I appreciate your call that but
[50:35.400 --> 50:40.560]  that's pretty racist thank you look if you like family if you like to own
[50:40.560 --> 50:43.880]  firearms it's racist and I want to apologize for my racism as well I'm
[50:43.880 --> 50:47.880]  being sarcastic of course this is authoritarianism they're taking over
[50:47.880 --> 50:53.200]  we better resist it now or we can all become wall Martians and wander around
[50:53.200 --> 50:58.400]  Walmart's drinking our Prozac we'll be right back with Jeffrey and many others
[50:58.400 --> 51:03.680]  straight ahead stay with us there are those curious about bitcoins and those

[55:34.960 --> 55:35.840]  To meet him in person
[55:35.840 --> 55:37.760]  He's arriving at about 45 minutes
[55:37.760 --> 55:39.040]  He's already here in Austin

[55:46.400 --> 55:47.200]  Obamacare
[55:49.200 --> 55:51.360]  Oh, you mean Obamacare, sir?
[55:52.800 --> 55:54.000]  What did you say
[55:55.280 --> 55:57.200]  Gang raping the Obamacare?
[55:57.200 --> 55:58.320]  Or what did you say?
[55:59.040 --> 56:00.640]  Oh yeah, Obamacare
[56:00.640 --> 56:02.080]  Obamacare, I couldn't tell you
[56:02.080 --> 56:05.760]  Yeah, my MA went up by double
[56:05.760 --> 56:06.320]  I believe
[56:06.320 --> 56:08.000]  I took a look at it just today
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.520]  I had to go out and get my bank statement
[56:09.520 --> 56:10.320]  By the way, don't worry
[56:10.320 --> 56:11.600]  They say it's going to double again
[56:11.600 --> 56:12.720]  Because it's affordable care
[56:12.720 --> 56:16.080]  Well, yeah, I already know it is
[56:17.120 --> 56:18.560]  I heard somebody else say
[56:19.440 --> 56:21.600]  On I think it was your radio show
[56:21.600 --> 56:24.320]  That no, it was a coast to coast AM
[56:24.320 --> 56:26.640]  That whatever they say
[56:26.640 --> 56:28.000]  In something like that
[56:28.000 --> 56:29.440]  Always think the opposite
[56:30.720 --> 56:33.360]  Well, no, that's what the character
[56:33.360 --> 56:35.120]  Winston Smith in 1984 did
[56:35.760 --> 56:37.600]  In fact, the British used to actually say that
[56:37.600 --> 56:39.760]  Don't believe anything that's been officially denied
[56:39.760 --> 56:42.880]  This morning, I saw about 75 motorcycle cops
[56:42.880 --> 56:44.160]  On the way into home
[56:44.160 --> 56:46.800]  Standing there, bugging their eyes out at people
[56:46.800 --> 56:48.080]  Making the road slow down
[56:48.080 --> 56:50.160]  But then acting like traffic cops
[56:50.160 --> 56:52.800]  So I rolled by one at one mile an hour
[56:52.800 --> 56:54.480]  And I said, what's going on?
[56:54.480 --> 56:56.480]  And he said, don't worry about it
[56:56.480 --> 56:58.080]  I thought I was in New York City
[56:58.640 --> 57:00.000]  Don't worry about it
[57:00.000 --> 57:01.200]  Hey, you know what?
[57:01.200 --> 57:03.200]  Nobody's going to worry about that guy's pension either
[57:03.200 --> 57:04.880]  You know, we have this attitude of where
[57:04.880 --> 57:06.800]  I mean, how do you get an Austin cop
[57:06.800 --> 57:08.160]  Because they're not bad compared to
[57:08.160 --> 57:10.160]  A lot of cities I've been in
[57:10.160 --> 57:12.160]  Mixed in with Travis County Sheriff's deputies
[57:12.160 --> 57:14.160]  Whatever they were doing out on 290
[57:14.160 --> 57:16.160]  How do you get them to the point of
[57:16.160 --> 57:19.120]  Bugging their eyes out and getting mad at someone
[57:20.160 --> 57:23.120]  If you politely say, hey, what's going on?
[57:24.160 --> 57:27.120]  And the cops was two of them just their mouths hung up
[57:27.120 --> 57:28.160]  And they went
[57:29.120 --> 57:31.120]  It's like we went to the NSA
[57:31.120 --> 57:33.120]  To talk to their PR person
[57:33.120 --> 57:34.160]  Their mouths were hanging up
[57:34.160 --> 57:36.160]  And it's like, you just talk to me
[57:36.160 --> 57:40.160]  That's going to be a death sentence soon, bud
[57:40.160 --> 57:42.160]  Because we're so free
[57:42.160 --> 57:44.160]  But I guess you've got a fluoride headed population
[57:44.160 --> 57:46.160]  So they're used to that
[57:46.160 --> 57:48.160]  The average public I see when they see a cop
[57:48.160 --> 57:50.160]  They look like a dog that's scared
[57:50.160 --> 57:52.160]  They almost roll over on their back and start peeing on themselves
[57:52.160 --> 57:54.160]  So I would expect then
[57:54.160 --> 57:56.160]  That I guess cops just get used to that
[57:56.160 --> 57:58.160]  And think of us as like lowly, worm-like creatures
[57:58.160 --> 58:00.160]  Though I did run into a lot of cool cops
[58:00.160 --> 58:02.160]  Down in San Antonio this weekend
[58:02.160 --> 58:04.160]  Anything else, sir? Anything else, racist you'd like to say?
[58:04.160 --> 58:08.160]  I think calling foreign bank run rape care
[58:08.160 --> 58:10.160]  Meant to rob everyone
[58:10.160 --> 58:12.160]  And a lower standard of care in record health care system
[58:12.160 --> 58:14.160]  Is racist to call it booger care
[58:14.160 --> 58:16.160]  Do you want to apologize to boogers?
[58:18.160 --> 58:20.160]  Yeah, I'm so sorry, boogers
[58:20.160 --> 58:22.160]  I didn't mean to actually have an opinion
[58:22.160 --> 58:24.160]  That wasn't given to me by the media
[58:24.160 --> 58:26.160]  AKA the meat
[58:26.160 --> 58:28.160]  But here's something else I want to say real quick, Mr. Jones
[58:28.160 --> 58:30.160]  Go ahead, racist, go ahead, racist
[58:30.160 --> 58:32.160]  Yes, uh, we
[58:32.160 --> 58:34.160]  The United States of America is lowly
[58:34.160 --> 58:36.160]  The United States of America is lowly
[58:36.160 --> 58:38.160]  The United States of America is lowly

[59:53.440 --> 01:00:00.440]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:14.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:28.920]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas. Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:33.640]  Our republic is in the midst of a foreign corporate takeover. Federal government's
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.480]  been almost completely captured. Our military trained to recognize things like that is waking
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.960]  up because they see it. They're being forced to train to take on gun owners, libertarians,
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.520]  returning veterans. So that's the good news. The bad news is that the globalists are just
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:53.920]  moving forward. They're now destroying the already damaged healthcare system as we predicted
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:59.440]  as was planned. They've done this other places. And just preparing everyone to learn that
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.560]  they don't get free healthcare because the computer didn't work. I mean, it's just all
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.560]  about a giant scam. And we predicted this would happen. I mean, it's not like we're
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:11.880]  rocket scientists. We know the enemy. We fight. And as soon as the public realizes they've
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:18.320]  been conned and just how much trouble we're in, we can begin to dig ourselves out of this.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.000]  The problem is the average Homeland Security personnel have been handpicked, psychologically
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.960]  tested to be imperious. In fact, in the Homeland Security ads that we've covered, they say,
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:34.320]  are you imperious, meaning domineering, hateful towards the public? Well, then we want you.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:40.880]  And they tell them that's how you project confidences, swagger around, and judge dread
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:49.960]  outfits, bugging your eyes out at people. So Obozo care is falling apart. Right now, let's
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.800]  just go back to your calls. Chris in Nevada, you're on the air. Welcome. Thank you for
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:59.560]  holding. Hey, Alex, how are you doing? I'm doing pretty good, brother. Hey, I'm the one
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.640]  that you told me that the military soft killed me. I was the fellow that told you that the
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:09.600]  military moved a lot of my bow like 15 feet. And you told me they soft killed me. I got
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:16.960]  that. Now I have six months of tangy tangerine that I use to keep myself going. But the reason
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:24.560]  for my call was, as I read an article a couple weeks back, and it was an op ed where a fellow
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.280]  had reported that all these people with these computer glitches thinking that they're getting
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:34.560]  into the Obamacare. Well, one of the things they give you or you give is your social security
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.880]  number. And lo and behold, all these people who think they got their Obamacare with the
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:44.600]  glitch are going to get the penalty slapped on me. Me. Oh, no, no, no. I mean, that's
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.320]  why it's there. No, no, no. That's what Mike Adams said two and a half weeks ago, and it's
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.560]  now confirmed. And that's why Consumer Reports has come out and said, don't be part of it.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:58.480]  Exactly. They get a list of people that aren't compliant to fine. No, that's it. So that's
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.280]  what you get. The free health care you get is a fine and then no health care because
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:09.040]  it won't even work, even if you want to pay for it. I shouldn't laugh. It's so sick. But
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.520]  I mean, think of the genius of that. It's like in good fellows where he's like to the
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.800]  lady, go in there. Yeah, go in that garage. That's where the free furs are. And then she
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.880]  starts looking in there and sees the guy's ready to kill her. And she goes, no, I'm not
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:26.960]  going in there. And he gets mad at her. By the way, that's a true story. That movie's
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.920]  based on a true story. And one of the only real Italian mafia defectors ever blow the
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:36.000]  whistle. What was happening deep inside the East Coast mob. But the average Obama person,
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.120]  they could see a child being sawed in half with a hacksaw. And they told them there was
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:44.000]  something free in there. They'd say, go, come on in now, strip your clothes off. We're
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.880]  going to chain you down. You're going to get, you're going to get something free. And then
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.440]  now that you're chained down, they go, yeah, I'm going to take a blowtorch to you and pull
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.880]  your teeth out with pliers. That's the free thing you're going to get. And even as they're
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.440]  having their teeth ripped out, if they tell them, I'm a Nigerian prince, you're now winning
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:05.240]  the $5 million in the Nigerian email, they will actually thank them for it. I'm telling
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:08.720]  you, these people would thank Obama if he was splitting their throat. Do you understand
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.800]  that? Yeah, I got a question for you real quick and I'll let you get back to the other
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:21.760]  callers. Why is it that Obama being a Marxist slash socialist or communist thinks that he
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:27.840]  can implement socialism or communism better than any of the other countries in the past
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:34.240]  when all we've seen is utter and complete collapse of those systems in the past? Well,
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:41.680]  because the collapse is the authoritarian takeover by criminals that call slavery communism.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:45.360]  And it's always the same. So the low level minions are just being con because they want
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:50.960]  a free ride. But the folks running the communist system, they know what it is, but it's communism
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:56.760]  for the political system with mega rich people offshore exempt from it. More calls coming

[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:32.040]  the fraud investigator former top federal fraud investigator best-selling author investigative
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:39.560]  journalist for ABC nightly news BBC well he still works with them sometimes but he brings
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:44.840]  the stuff that's too hot for them to handle because of the control JP Morgan Chase and
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:51.360]  others have to the show he's gonna talk about the $13 billion debt that chase has now a record
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:09:02.880]  settlement which is even a big deal for Lloyd Blank fine. So this is a huge huge issue.

[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:12.520]  in a moment and then we've got Mr. McAfee John McAfee is here he's here now really interesting
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:18.160]  meeting him in person he's got some bombshell inside info on Obamacare whether he was just
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:22.920]  interviewed by NBC right before he came here that'll be on tonight we've got breaking news
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:30.040]  with John McAfee legendary computer programmer coming up we'll get his take on that and so
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:38.560]  much more here today but again we're also gonna be breaking down Obamacare and so much
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:44.000]  more in the latest on the NSA before I go any further because my offices are getting
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:51.800]  flooded with phone calls XM channel 244 took us off reportedly last Friday I had been told
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:59.480]  earlier in the year that XM serious was basically having a lot of problems internal shake ups
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:05.840]  and more and that it was not personal but that most of their libertarian conservative
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:11.040]  talk shows would be taken off it's not just us it's other networks other affiliates other
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:19.320]  groups and there's internal battles going on politically within serious XM to have no
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:25.280]  conservative or libertarian shows on the air other than Fox News and Fox channels and we
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:32.080]  were replaced with Fox sub channels even though XM executives that contacted us said that they
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:37.880]  get a lot of subscriptions were extremely popular obviously it was not just us it was
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:44.760]  hundreds of other libertarian and conservative shows were taken off of serious XM so if you
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:49.880]  are a subscriber like I am and you want to hear these type shows you need to contact
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:58.640]  them not us we are being inundated with hundreds of calls an hour to our few customer service
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:04.360]  people we can do nothing I told you about this a long time ago they were going to take
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.920]  us off six months ago but because there was an executive discussion and thing that went
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:16.720]  on they made the decision to put off those corporate board decisions because of fear
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:24.080]  of backlash and so we were kept on we're gone now and it I've been on there about three
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.000]  years I was surprised we're ever on there that long we're on over 160 MN FM stations
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.680]  that's a lot for a show that's this hardcore but we're dominating on all the different
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:43.200]  internet audio feed platforms we're dominating from Stitcher to all the other major systems
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:51.320]  boxy Roku the old systems like Shoutcast I mean we're just in the top 20 to the top five
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:56.080]  on most systems the number one on many so we're dominating in the free market of ideas
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.640]  the problem is they're coming out with systems where they can censor libertarian or patriotic
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:06.600]  talk system wide across platforms and that's the real thing that we're facing in the future
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:12.880]  so it is important that people record and save on their own hard drives this show this
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:17.960]  broadcast this information because we can wake up with a big false flag one morning and we're
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:22.400]  blocked on the satellites the AM the FM even the shortwave you won't be hearing this show
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.960]  anymore under continuity of government COG so you don't know what you've got until it's
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:33.920]  gone and we are off XM channel 244 first they moved us from one channel to a higher channel
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:40.560]  they said to try to kill backlash they moved all their hot talk channels to higher channels
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.640]  to kind of kill the audience and confuse people and now they've just killed it entirely so
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:51.200]  call XM call serious yourself please and send them emails or call their corporate offices
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.600]  if you want to hear us back on in fact maybe we should dig up their corporate numbers not
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:59.720]  our internal corporate numbers because those are friends inside serious XM vice presidents
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:05.040]  and people we need to just give the general main corporate number out probably for folks
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.840]  to direct their calls there instead of here so again please I understand you're upset
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:14.600]  please stop calling us here we can't do anything about it okay we are not the ones that did
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.840]  it okay I didn't flip a switch and take us off there I thought it was coming six months
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:23.840]  ago fact we broke that they were going to take almost all conservative libertarian programming
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:31.520]  off serious XM so that's been done let's go to Jeffrey in Alabama your take on Obamacare
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:37.240]  now that premiums on average have doubled and we've seen on average a tripling of deductibles
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:41.560]  isn't that what affordable care act means when I hear affordable care act I think tripling
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:47.680]  deductibles doubling premiums don't you yes it's also a mafia takeover of the Zionist
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:52.240]  Rothschild Nazis as you told us I don't want to wind up like Captain Sarpa Donner of interest
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:55.520]  and be a victim of the savage mortician is a bar death from a war hammer how are you doing
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:00.120]  separate I am doing good I'm trying to follow what you said there but it sounded interesting
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:05.680]  go ahead sir I just said savage morticians is a war hammer a sci-fi quote uh Sarpa
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.400]  not had it bad he came back but he was tapping on the table when he talked to his boss uh
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:15.920]  simple free I love you in the show I've learned so many things from watching you and I'm not
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:21.640]  a racist I'm an Alabama I'm not a racist I'm a human racist over aliens I hear you and
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.600]  that's racist as well I believe if aliens arrived in their starships and said give us
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.920]  your children we're going to suck their brains out through huge straws as long as the straws
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.320]  were pink and as long as the aliens said let us eat your children's brains or your racist
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:43.760]  the average trendy would present their child to the alien 14 foot uh insect creatures to
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:48.280]  suck their brains out I appreciate your call and I think we should give our children's
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:53.920]  brains to the aliens to prove we're not racist all right let's go ahead now take another
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:15:02.960]  call George in New Zealand go ahead sir hello I had uh wanted to mention one other uh halogen
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.000]  that you hadn't covered uh between fluorine chlorine and uh bromine and the periodic table
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.480]  is chlorine uh I had uh I'm a physician and uh went to school in San Antonio and flipping
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:19.600]  through looking for an article there was an article in like a 1950 that uh showed a study
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:27.560]  done on rabbits and um chickens that typical uh city fluoridation uh city chlorination
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:33.280]  of water causes uh hardening of the arteries and had them all dissected so just last year
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.400]  the government increased the amount of chlorine that the cities are required to put in uh
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.520]  the system so just you need to filter your water that's right we should filter our water
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:47.360]  and I'm going to give you Richard's email in a minute Richard is kind of handling some
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:52.720]  of the iodine stuff for me uh if you could send all those studies you find because there
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:57.160]  are thousands of them on what this does and for those that don't know it's on record that
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.600]  chlorine gives you kidney cancer liver cancer and a bunch of the stuff and I understand
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:08.960]  the cost benefit analysis of put it in the water so that you can uh you know purify it
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.080]  so that you don't die dysentery but the answer is we need to have the lowest levels of chlorine
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:21.200]  possible and other systems or mass filtration instead of upping the level of the chlorine
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:26.960]  as they've done under international standards go ahead uh number two you can get out of uh
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:32.800]  obamacare if you join one one of the christian uh healthcare uh systems there there's a number
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:38.480]  of them and they're exempt from obamacare and they're very affordable uh number three i went
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:44.800]  to school in columbus uh uh to Ohio state and they had a lot of uh test marketing there uh
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.960]  most big companies before they really put a market put something out in the market will
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.040]  test market and i think uh they should test market at obamacare in some place that wants
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:58.080]  it like hawaii or massachusetts or something before they started it living here in new
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:06.640]  zealand uh we had uh by insurance it cost us uh uh we had uh make sure we had our own
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:12.320]  insurance provided for me and my wife it cost a thousand four hundred dollars a year for their
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:19.360]  uh insurance here so there are ways to get around this um the reason we're in uh new zealand is
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.520]  because yeah there is socialized health care here but there aren't enough doctors because
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:28.560]  they don't pay enough that they go to other countries and so the they import united states
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:32.400]  doctors you know i hear new zealand is incredibly beautiful maybe i should come join you
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:40.480]  you're welcome to come to visit i know i hear you i tell you man america is so poisoned and
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:45.040]  dumbed down that it's scary to be here but i think i need to stay here and try to save the republic
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:51.200]  with the help of our great listeners but it is really scary i went to walmart yesterday just to
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:57.360]  just to check it out and see what it was like and it was like a third world nightmare uh
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:04.160]  uh with just just people scabbering around looking like they had their souls sucked out of them very
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:08.880]  frightening god bless you i appreciate your call let's go ahead and talk to mike in illinois

[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:23.760]  going to spell i don't know if you can do this but obama care is one eight hundred f u no no no
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:29.920]  they did actually make that the number just on purpose you see the fund for them i've studied
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:36.160]  the criminology of this type of criminal group is to do that publicly exactly yes and you know
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:42.240]  and you're right they do want it they want to know your income uh so they can put you

[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.640]  what we said two and a half weeks ago with mike adams the top programmer breaking it down here
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:00.880]  it is an nsa front to get your social security your income your info to then put you in a database
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:06.880]  for the irs to garnish your wages or take your refund or grab your bank account for five thousand

[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:32.720]  raised democrat until i began to listen to you and uh ron paul and and now ran paul and uh
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:40.800]  it's just amazing how people are zombified when it comes to mentioning anything about obama
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:49.280]  uh that's negative that's why i keep making the joke that you do whatever they say or you're racist
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.720]  i mean i you could come up to a trendy and say strangle your child or your racist they would
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:57.200]  begin strangling them with a tourniquet i mean i'm not kidding if you say we're gonna set up

[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:32.960]  he is giving us the inside scoop on what has happened now with chase and their 13 billion
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:38.000]  dollar fine and what's really behind that and what's really behind our story that went viral
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.560]  last week on what looks like capital controls financial experts we've talked to agree their
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:47.840]  response saying it's no big deal that we let you wire money in but not out and that most accounts
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:52.720]  can't have more than $50,000 of activity a month if it's cash like your restaurant what's really
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:57.920]  going on at jp morgan chase the top of the globalist pyramid among other venture capitalists who
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:04.880]  are anti-free market monopoly men and so greg palace joins us via video skype couldn't think of a
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:11.280]  better time for him to come on and give us the inside scoop and i mean the inside scoop i'm not
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.120]  bragging about our guests like mike adams two and a half weeks ago shing health care dot gov is
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:19.520]  an nsa front none of it works it's all fake the only part that works is getting your social
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:24.400]  security number and info to create a database on you to then send you the fines for not getting
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:30.960]  health care it's impossible to buy on the system and and now it's in consumer reports don't go
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.960]  there that's what it is two and a half weeks later well i'm telling you just like mike adams
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:40.400]  was right about that holy mackin v saying the same thing we have the top expert on the scams going
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:45.200]  on to tell you what's really happening so we're not just hyping that our guests are the best out there
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:49.440]  mainstream media could have guests like this they don't want you to really know what's going on
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:54.320]  they want you in the dark so they can slit your political throat reg palace have built you up but
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:27:00.160]  it's it's it people you listen to what you have to say give us the inside sir well here's the story
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:06.080]  alex i mean it might sound like uh the government has really whacked jp morgan chase for a lot of
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:13.360]  money they've agreed to settle charges uh of fraud and they've pled guilty to fraud under california
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:19.920]  state charges and they're paying 13 billion dollars now that might sound like a lot of money to chase
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:27.760]  they had a um uh it's headed by jayme diamond the man that is known as obama's favorite banker
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:33.680]  well obama's favorite banker has now pled guilty to fraud is paying 13 billion dollars and so he's
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:39.920]  now got to hunt up all that cash between the sofa cushions uh jp morgan chase is now the biggest
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:46.720]  bank in the united states and it is uh it's it's handling over a trillion dollars some of that's
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:52.640]  real money and some of that is stuff they kind of made up 13 billion dollars may sound like a big
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:28:00.400]  fine that the justice department has levied on this company to avoid a trial uh it's not um not when
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:08.000]  uh considering the crime that they've actually now pled guilty to what is the crime it's fraud upon
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:15.520]  the international mortgage market uh it's brought down this is what brought down the system in 2008
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:23.840]  in beginning in 2007 to 2008 what the jp morgan did was it lent out and with their co-conspirators
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:31.200]  bank of america golden sacks and uh and bank of america's countrywide unit they lent out tens of
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:38.240]  billions of dollars in subprime mortgages where people were hooked in at three and four percent
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:45.680]  and then found that their mortgage payments were tripling at at 11 percent now you know one of their
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:51.520]  claims oh people ran out of money they couldn't afford these mortgages no most people can't afford
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:55.760]  a tripling of their mortgage but what they said was they they gave out mortgages that they knew
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:01.920]  would go kablooey they deliberately sold these mortgages they packaged them up jp morgan lent
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:06.640]  out the money or bank of america countrywide unit lent out the money but rather than take the risk on
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:13.200]  the mortgages they packaged them up into what they call and to securities they securitized them as
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:19.120]  they called it and they sold these securities to pension funds in america the florida and then they
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:24.880]  and others like timber wolf made jokes about how they were selling their customers quote sh you know
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:31.680]  what yeah i mean they were bags of feces and they sold them to the swiss railway uh pension fund i
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:38.640]  know that because my partner's dad was uh once had a pension from the swiss railway uh towns in
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:45.280]  finland melted uh that bought this stuff and of course the california state pension fund uh teachers
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:49.840]  pension and and government pensions so they're getting a slap on the wrist for stealing trillions

[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:09.440]  you've done more than i have jp morgan chase is at the very top of the pyramid but there are these
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:16.000]  big hedge funds that actual power level are just as powerful and it's all interlocking and people
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:21.360]  like john corezine can make 40 to 1 batch of the people's money and no criminal charges stealing
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:27.200]  people's money i mean is there anything to hold them back what is the general climate right now
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:34.320]  with the the the chinese government lecturing us about our debt with the hedge fund hyenas
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:40.080]  manipulating things with the new head of the federal reserve saying she's going to accelerate
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:47.520]  the uh money printing what's the inside word on what the next big shoe is to drop well the big
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:53.360]  problem is that with the 13 billion dollar settlement and remember the damages are about
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:35:00.240]  a trillion dollars a trillion dollars okay and they're settling for 13 billion the the big problem
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:05.680]  for me is not that they're getting away with murder on the cheap it's that the game will continue in
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:13.040]  other words um there is no move uh jp morgan jay me diamond i mean obama here's a guy who's who's it
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:20.240]  um signing off that uh bleeding guilty to criminal fraud paying 13 billions in fines and
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:26.640]  obama recently said that he wished that every bank had a jay me diamond running it can you imagine
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:32.960]  wow say what i would like is a is a guy who's now pled guilty to major fine one of the biggest
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:38.080]  financial crimes in history according to his own justice department having a pyro maniac in charge of
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:44.800]  the fireworks factory yeah exactly so uh you got exactly so what you got is you got the the arsonist
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:49.520]  in charge of the fire department and obama thinks it's just what we just need more guys like that
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:56.560]  now the biggest problem besides the bad joke of it the the sick joke of that is that um they are not
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:00.640]  doing anything to implement like you said there was these there are these hedge funds in the shadows
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:07.040]  but not only in the shadows but under the aegis of jp morgan chase and in other words they are they
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:14.480]  the deregulation the decriminalizing of mixing your bank account with casino operations of
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:20.400]  investment banks is not being changed it was the destruction of the glass steiglack uh back in the
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:26.560]  clinton administration under the guidance of larry summers and of course uh city bank chiefed in
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:30.800]  robert rubin who was went from the treasury you know went from golden sacks and the treasury to
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:36.960]  back to city bank um jb morgan did not commit this crime alone and i'm saying crime because now it's
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:41.280]  official they pled guilty to criminal charges uh they did not commit this crime alone like you say
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:47.920]  they're big hedge funds and they are not saying okay the the hedge funds gamblers have to stay away
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:53.760]  from the public's money that that your savings account which is guaranteed by public funds
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:59.440]  they're still letting these guys gamble with that money so basically it's like they just had the public
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:07.440]  for dinner and now the concierge or the mater d is just tagging on a small two or three percent tip
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:12.800]  on the bill yeah as they pick their teeth leaving right they're saying listen if you pay you know
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:16.160]  you give the waiter a tip you know kind of like wave the bill we'll give it to those guys at the
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:20.160]  other table you know the working guys over there at the lunch counter uh they'll pick up your tab
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:23.680]  well the analogy is the guys at the other lunch counter you just ate their children in front of them
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:27.920]  and now they get to pick up the bill we're laughing but the truth is is that we did have a financial
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:34.080]  collapse because this crime was not mine when they when those um securities turned out were
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:40.640]  opened up and they turned out to be bags of as you say bags of feces um the entire market for
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:44.640]  housing collapsed in the united states people lost trillions of dollars in value in their homes they
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.840]  couldn't buy new homes they couldn't sell their homes they we had two million foreclosures
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:55.200]  this is not just a financial scam that oh well yeah that's a lot of money you know those big guys and
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:58.800]  they still got bonuses and let's complain about i'm talking about something more serious we had
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:05.040]  two million people lost their homes uh to this in this scam and countless uh infected pension funds
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:11.200]  public and private cities going under and yeah we're talking you know when we talk about detroit
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:16.240]  going under look don't forget this is a big big part of it uh you had like a fourth of the homes
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:22.480]  in detroit uh were worthless so the city had no you know tax base uh for to pay anything so they
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:29.680]  went bankrupt you have to the the knock on effects of a jp morgan crime in combination with their
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:36.720]  hedge funds and for example i i brought up one case where um goldman sacks um and jp morgan
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:41.200]  was in part of this game where goldman sacks was actually betting against the mortgage market while
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:46.240]  they're selling this junk and one hand secretly they're they know that the market's going to collapse
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.960]  they made four billion dollars for themselves and their clients betting on the collapse of
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:54.480]  the market that they that they crossed and then we're arrogant enough i mean we're not just saying
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:59.120]  bags of feces here for fun this is not an hour's turn show folks we don't do that not knocking
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:04.800]  howard for the point is this is not a joke show that's what they called it making fun of their
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:11.760]  clients saying we sold them packages of bleep i mean it'd be one thing if they robbed their clients
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:17.200]  that's bad enough but the celebrating of it what do you call that it's it's unbelievable well that
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:22.400]  they it's crime it's called fraud and see that's the thing is that the excuse before is oh my god
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:27.600]  we didn't know that the housing market would collapse it's not our fault oh my god we're victims too
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:32.560]  come on now we know not only from the internal tapes on the and the memos that that they knew that
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:39.680]  they were selling bags of crap that on the other hand that they actually made money on this because
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:44.800]  they were betting on the collapse while they're selling the suckers these mortgages and and by the
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:50.160]  way some of these mortgages which they con the rating agencies into giving them well not economy
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:55.120]  but they paid them off it was simple they paid these rating agencies like standard bores to rate
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:00.400]  these things double a and triple a and they literally were worth one cent on the dollar they
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:05.360]  lost 99 percent of their value they were complete junk and they had double a ratings because they
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:11.760]  paid these investment rating agencies a fortune to put the you know the good housekeeping seal
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:15.760]  so we know about a lot of this the big question is and the reason i wanted to get you on is back
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:21.840]  in 2002 you released the leaked documents right around the time that joseph stiklitz left the
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:25.520]  world bank of chief economist and he says he didn't do it you say he didn't know what the point is
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.640]  and they got released around that time there was i guess a d notice the bbc couldn't release them
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:35.840]  all but you still released a few of them you came on my show became a big worldwide story
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:41.040]  that's right remind people about that well what happened is is that we know from internal documents
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:45.680]  of the world bank wto and now the treasury department a few weeks ago i released something
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:52.080]  called the end game memo by lauren summer or received by lauren summer larry summers from
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:56.880]  tim geithner both had been secretaries of the treasury working under robert rubin and clinton
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:02.960]  and obama and this crowd basically said look we're going to rip apart we're having secret
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.360]  meetings with jp morgan chase we're having secret meetings at goldman we're having secret meetings
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:12.400]  with city bank and by the way such secret meetings are completely illegal in fact what i think the
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:20.240]  reason why i think obama decided to let jp morgan off the hook with a 13 billion dollar slap on the
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:24.640]  wrist again 13 billion is is a slap on the wrist when the damage is a trillion by the government's
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:30.160]  own calculation so um why they let them go because can you imagine jp morgan say well you know we
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:35.280]  had secret approval from your own secretary of the treasury we like to call lauren summers to our
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:40.640]  defense we'd like to call secretary the obama secretary of the treasury larry um timmy geithner
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:45.360]  and since they approved it all how could you say we of course the white house the last white house
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:51.200]  and especially the clinton white house as you exposed our co conspirators in it so so so here's
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:57.040]  why i brought up the stuff from from 2002 because those documents broke down they were now going to
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:01.520]  take over the west just as they had done third world countries and now they hold greece the us you
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:09.120]  name it hostage with these debt limits yeah when months ago they uh just froze the debt limit even
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:13.520]  though the debt was going up but when they wanted to they then threatened our credit and everything
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.560]  holding us hostage well that's in the documents you released their plan to do that so i'm asking you
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:23.840]  what's the current climate what are these criminals up to now well i think that the thing is now
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:29.680]  they're celebrating because i'm you know uh that jayme diamond has basically gotten off the hook
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:34.960]  it's not despite the fraud charges uh he's not going to be uh you know he's not going to be
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:40.640]  read his rights and and shipped off to leavenworth it's a joke and he already had the a little
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:48.720]  gathering of his uh people at uh the um at the top of a museum he had a big champagne uh luncheon
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:52.880]  you know basically proclaiming victory so they literally literally are breaking out the champagne
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.920]  bottles and the and like you say the big problem is that the game continues it's not even what they
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:02.720]  did and that they got away with it though that's serious business as a fraud investigator i used
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:06.160]  you know like i say they used to do racketeering cases for the government you know we used to think
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:11.520]  that well gee do a racketeering case they plead guilty they should go the can that ain't happening
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:17.760]  they might take a few small fry and and and throw them into the volcano but that's about it you know
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:23.760]  and and you know as we saw at goldman sacks when they ripped off the the on the same scam it was
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:27.760]  the same scam by the way and they made four billion and then they threw some assistant
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.680]  vice president they didn't even know what the hell was going on they threw him they all they
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:37.600]  removed his ability his license to sell stock that was the the biggest uh criminal punishment
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:43.680]  of these companies which made billions and took us down for trillion so i'm just concerned that
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:49.840]  the same game is going on there is no attempt there is no attempt to say look um we have to
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:56.400]  go back to the rule of law here you cannot take money which is guaranteed savings money which is
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:02.800]  guaranteed by the people of america through the us treasury and the federal deposit insurance
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:09.520]  corporation cannot take our money and go to vegas with us fix the tables so you win we lose
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:15.520]  i i'm stunned that there's been absolutely no real change in the law i mean it's like high
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:20.560]  frequency trading i've seen the actuaries the numbers the graphs where they've increased derivatives
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:25.760]  investments since 2008 they kind of slowed down for two years now they've ramped it back up
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:31.040]  there's another huge bubble with kiwi unlimited what's the word with kiwi unlimited what's the
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:35.920]  inside scoop on the real state of the economy well they have to keep pumping in money i mean
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:41.920]  understand when you talk about derivatives and we just had again today we're talking about the
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:48.400]  fine the deal cut between the justice department and jp morgan chase that they only pay 13 billion
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:55.360]  on a trillion dollar crime they've admitted to criminal fraud um jp morgan chase just so you know
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:03.280]  i was stunned myself you go to my uh website you'll find a page of their old sec files they had 88
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:09.680]  trillion dollars of derivatives on their books as assets 88 trillion dollars in derivatives as assets
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.320]  now i'm sorry uh there isn't 88 trillion dollars of anything on this planet i guess what do they
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:18.880]  do have a bank account on another planet we don't know i mean where's the 88 it's literally on their
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.440]  records i had to count the zero so many times i kept looking at my assistant miss bad petty i kept
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:30.000]  saying you got i said i now you understand i have a uh an mba from uh the university chicago
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:35.440]  i look at these numbers and say it can't be it can't be but it is 88 trillion dollars in in
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:41.040]  basically baloney security and it gets better they expect us to back them up and pay for them
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:45.120]  and and when they go and when they turn out to be of course what they are which is you know
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:51.040]  crap bags of poop we uh we pay for it and that's what and that's why you have to keep pumping money
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:57.200]  into the system because if not the the you know the the game the musical chairs but all the economists
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:02.080]  i talked to tell me if you concur is you're a smart financial guy out there uh they say that
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:08.000]  mathematically down the road it may be six months maybe two years that the chairs will stop and sure
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:13.680]  if they would have slowed down qe3 the whole economy would have imploded in one swoop but instead
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:19.040]  as ron poll wrote a paper a few days ago it's going to go more long term but be worse in the end
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:25.120]  what do you say about that well i i you know look it's so scary now that um yeah they're just
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:29.840]  throwing money out the window and keeping the banks pumped up uh and they almost like you say
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:35.120]  we'd have a collapse if they didn't we can't we've created a spinning merry-go-round of a
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:40.400]  financial system and we can't just like hit the brakes because everyone falls off the horses right
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:45.840]  and so um i don't know i actually don't know where it will end up i would hope that it depends
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:53.520]  what we do if we start beginning to police these operations beginning to wind down this massive
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:47:00.240]  amount of of basically baloney uh airfield securities that are flying around the planet on
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:07.840]  which we have pensions based all over the world and you know in which economies and banks are
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:11.200]  have this stuff and of course as you pointed out in one of your books a few years ago i forget
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:16.800]  which one but i read it they corrupted pension funds and stuff on purpose so they could hold
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:22.720]  everyone hostage yeah i mean what they did was um and that was in vulture's picnic and i also had
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:28.560]  one of billionaires in ballot bandits and uh you know one of the problems is is that if you suddenly
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:35.760]  say hey all greek debt is now baloney you have uh every bank in the planet now doesn't can't use that
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:41.760]  as reserve currency and technically you can have uh every major bank on the planet outside of brazil
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:46.240]  and china which which won't wouldn't join in outside of brazil and china you'd have every bank
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:51.280]  in the planet technically bankrupt so they got they can't just say okay games over um you know the
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:57.040]  carousel stops we have to wind down because we've gotten ourselves into this business but the problem
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:03.760]  is with the jp morgan settlement today i'm just worried that that's simply a okay you pay a few
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:10.480]  you know bucks into the cup 10 cup and the game continues there's no there is absolutely no indication
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:16.240]  that jp morgan is going to stop selling securitized mortgages and take responsibility for them
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:21.120]  just that they that they issue it's real simple you can't allow this stuff how about we say
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:28.240]  they commit it's been a nothing but fraudulent and damaging and almost blew up the planet um why
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:34.720]  don't we say it's illegal we used to we went we went several you know generations several millennia
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:41.840]  without securitized mortgage derivatives why don't we say that was a real bad idea guys let's cut it
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:47.600]  out it was criminal before let's say it's criminal again and then we don't have to you know and
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:53.600]  but to say okay you pay 13 billion you can pick up where you left off go back to vegas um no i don't
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:59.520]  think so sure but to put it in layman's terms we're talking about hundreds of trillions of dollars
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:06.160]  conservatively of counterfeit garbage that they've now bought stuff with and then we're saying hey stop
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:11.680]  that they go uh we've infected everything so instead of them getting in trouble it's worse
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:17.520]  they get bailed out and get more power because well they're the guys that did it so let them manage it
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:22.800]  and then they're using it to take advantage of us while jp morgan and all these groups financed the
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:27.440]  police state they're the ones every time i turn around that are lobbying to get rid of our freedoms
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:32.240]  well of course because if we have our system where we run the government they could end up at
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:39.120]  nurenberg so they also have an appetite to set up an authoritarian in game so they feel safe i mean
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:46.480]  they've got to be dealt with yeah i mean look you can't you can't ignore the idea of the nsa spying
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:52.720]  with the need to maintain to make sure that no one is protesting against the jp morgan's takedown
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:58.240]  of our treasury don't forget we came very close to having larry summers the guy that that basically
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:04.480]  bodyblocked any regulation of jp morgan's derivatives activity and by the way he was on their payroll
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:09.680]  obama wanted to make him head of the federal reserve and that shows the arrogance of these
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:13.520]  people that was like trying to have kissinger as they had whitewasher on the 911 commission
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:19.600]  well you know one thing i should say that's positive you know i issued the uh these memos
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:23.600]  that the summers had been going had been having secret meetings illegally with the banks uh
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:28.960]  senator sherrod brown of ohio had that in his hand he was he was loading up for any confirmation
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:33.840]  hearing if obama went ahead with summers we beat the summers nomination for head of the federal
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:37.040]  reserve well stay there come back and do five more minutes six minutes segment and then john

[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:25.760]  guys i showed you that earlier will you print me that cnbc article about the government trying
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:29.840]  to hire him to try to fix health care health care dot gov i want to show that when he comes in
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:34.800]  he's got some amazing points he wants to go over about other agency spying on people you name it
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:41.040]  the next hour greg palest uh the good news sir recapping you got caught off by the break what is
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:45.280]  the good news because we love to hear good news well the good news is that you know they can't
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:51.120]  steal all the money all the time and they can't ignore the public all the time because it threatens
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:59.280]  the system now larry summers who was the guy who was us secretary treasury uh under clinton and then
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:05.040]  became the economics czar um which you know as long as i like the name economics are proves that
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:11.440]  we're you know we're officially an autocracy right um the economics are he worked for the big banks
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:18.320]  and he was the guy in government and then out who body blocked every attempt to regulate control
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:25.040]  or even eliminate this new derivatives market junk he was paid he was on the payroll of uh
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:30.800]  city bank and jp morgan chase and obama was it was really insisting on appointing him
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:36.080]  to head the federal reserve board which would basically be you know it's putting the mob in
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:41.120]  in charge of of the of the banks you know i mean it's that simple except the bottom the mob
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:45.600]  whenever dream is stealing this much money at once and so summers was going to be head of the
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:50.640]  federal reserve board uh i released documents a lot of other journalists i released documents
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:55.200]  that he was having secret meetings which were illegal with the banks while he was uh secretary
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:57:00.880]  of the treasury and uh we had a lot of senators like senator sherrod brown he used that information
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:05.120]  told obama that if this guy goes into confirmation hearing they're going to use my material and
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:11.840]  others material to to expose this guy and so we ended up with janet yellen instead now you may
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:17.760]  think that yellen is just another one of them but believe me summers that even the signal given to
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:23.280]  the banks that their boy would be in charge is by itself terrible when you tell the mob that you're
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:29.760]  going to pick their consigliary as police chief that's a serious bad signal that says there's no
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:35.920]  regulation no one has control so public pressure uh you know got summers uh jumped as head of the
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:41.520]  federal reserve board and you do have people whether you like elizabeth warren's politics or not a
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:45.200]  lot of the reaction or one of the reasons she was elected because she said you know the banks are
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:51.200]  getting away with murder and um you know so there has been a reaction there was you know the the
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:56.160]  activity of occupy wall street panicked them into and the patriot movement panicked them into
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:02.960]  the nsa spine scam so another one you see you might complain about the nsa but just think about this
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:10.000]  you got them you're driving them crazy alexie they need so they have to do this type of spine
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.120]  because they're worried that there's movements that are challenging uh um this uh this banking
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:19.920]  regime so the good news is you're seeing uh folks wake up not just here but around the world yeah
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:25.600]  and of course needless to say you got i you know i'm um in brazil they said the hell with this
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:31.840]  business and they threw out the uh they said we're not you can't sell derivatives to brazil so there's

[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:15.040]  to fix health care so i guess they are all hands on deck trying to hire all the tech gurus to fix
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:19.440]  stuff we're gonna talk about that coming up in the next segment but john it is great to meet you
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:23.440]  in person buddy well it's great to meet you alex i've talked to you on the phone so many times i
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:28.240]  i felt like i knew you anyway well it's good to have you here what do you think of austin so far
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:33.920]  i like austin very nice town it's uh it's small a small enough to uh uh to be enjoyable and not
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:38.160]  too crowded and yet the lords enough to have coffee shops well it used to be a lot smaller
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:42.320]  like a hundred thousand people now it's over a million but it is it is spread out but right
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:47.280]  i hear you have a water problem we do we're running out of water well until it flooded last week
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:51.680]  i mean every decade or so there's a drought but it's it's it next we're gonna have the dams about
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:56.960]  to break so all right well that's that's preferable i think i think the prettiest places in austin
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:02.480]  would be down on uh say the colorado river have you seen that yet i have beautiful beautiful
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:07.040]  like i'm staying i think that's the river i'm staying on uh at the four seasons i've got a
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:11.920]  beautiful view of some river there there were punters out this morning so what do you want to
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:15.760]  get into i mean obviously we'll talk about obama care that's the big breaking news we'll get an
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:21.120]  update on brazil nsa now you say there's more than just the nsa spying on us well obviously i mean
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:26.000]  if if the nsa is spying on us and there's just one covert branch of the government then everybody
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:32.800]  has to be it'd be ridiculous to have this the nsa spying on on the u.s. population but the cia and
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:37.360]  the fbi and other covert arms not doing or the military so you know for fact that we're being
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:42.720]  spied on by everyone you know edwards notan just blew the whistle on one aspect and so we're focused
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:48.880]  on net and the other the other branches are probably going oh please don't let them focus on us well
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:53.600]  that's right i mean there's 15 big intelligence agencies but it gets worse than that because it
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:59.280]  came out the dea is hooked into the nsa tracking everybody i mean so they're listening to you
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:04.160]  talk about a pot plant you've got growing in your backyard well i don't smoke pot but no no but i'm
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:09.280]  at the public out there sure of course right so the uh all the agencies cooperate to a certain
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.280]  extent i mean they're jealous of each other and they keep guarded secrets but you can be guaranteed
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:18.720]  that something of interest to one agency may be of interest to another and and so there's nothing
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:24.400]  that we do that isn't known now i mean that has to be the case i also want to talk about your
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:28.400]  product when it comes out because you mean you're already one of the most famous and computer type
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:33.120]  inventors out there uh i tell you this will be revolutionary if it's not just an off-site proxy
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:37.040]  you go through because we know they they tap the backbone before it even gets there they've bragged
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:41.120]  about that if it's a device in front of your computer i don't know why i didn't think of that i
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:45.600]  guess i'm not john mackavy well you know it's it's a very simple concept people think that it's going
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:50.560]  to be difficult to implement but it's not it's a very simple idea it's just you step outside the box
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:56.320]  and say okay everyone's trying to fix the internet it's too big it's been here too long there are too
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:01.840]  many pieces uh i said well it can't be fixed why don't we just create another internet sort of a
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:07.040]  sub part of the real internet and as it grows perhaps that will be the new internet but it's
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:12.720]  very simple the the the the concept rests on the principle that if they do not know if no one knows
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:17.680]  even yourself the id of the person you're sending it to or receiving information from
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:22.240]  then how can anybody watch that information and if the information itself is encrypted
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:27.520]  then even if it is intercepted it means nothing and my encryption technique has not been vetted
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:32.800]  by the nsa or they were not involved in the development of it so uh like every other technique
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:39.120]  is so they can't look at it nor can any other agency well john mackavy's our guest in studio
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:43.840]  i'm your host alex jones and when we come back we're going to dive into an in-depth interview

[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:37.360]  jones well john mackenzie is our guest he's come to austin to visit with us and this morning he did
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:46.000]  a interview with cnbc and it's gop as for tech founder x fugitive mackenzie to diagnose obama
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:51.760]  care and that fits in with the political article tech surge to repair obama care websites they're
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:57.600]  saying it's like the manhattan project as they panic to try to fix it now of course john mackenzie
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:05.120]  is a extremely famous um computer programmer engineer worked for all sorts of big corporations
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:11.280]  nasa you name it he developed mackenzie which is still the dominant anti-virus system out there
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:19.520]  he's also been better known lately for escaping out of the kleptocratic area of police and exposing
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:26.400]  connections to the communist chinese muslim terrorist you name it rias and plots and when
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:31.920]  he broke this on our show i said man that is hard to believe and but i i still had him on and said
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:38.640]  it may be true but then it all later came out in the news months and months later so he is
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:45.040]  uh definitely a blessed charmed man to have been able to make it out of there into guatemala
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:49.360]  and then back to the good old us of a and we're going to talk about his view on the world and
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:58.080]  so many issues the nsa you name it but first sir let's get into obama care uh wow so you've been
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:02.240]  contacted by the government to try to come in and fix it what did you tell them and why did you
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:07.360]  refuse well i was i was contacted by the house committee on energy and commerce uh they're the
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:14.080]  ones that oversee the obama care package uh and if i would come out and and basically oversee
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:21.120]  some of the changes and give them input on on what needed to be done um i said sure then they
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:25.360]  added but we can't pay your expenses or anything the government is shut down and i'm thinking well
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:32.160]  you pay six hundred million dollars to to uh completely uh inoperable agency to build this
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:39.200]  system and said okay well i'll pay i'll pay my own way and uh they said okay and then they came back
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:44.320]  and said well we can't even get the the committee members all together because again the the the
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:49.920]  chaos of the shutdown can we do it on the phone and at that point i go okay i'm out of here um
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:55.040]  they expect me to to give them advice on a system that requires showing them charts and graphs and
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:58.640]  how this thing is put together and what's wrong with it and they want to do it over the phone
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:03.680]  they're not serious they just want to say we contacted McAfee he gave us some advice and
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:07.440]  we're going to implement it which is utter nonsense they're not my advice would be
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:13.520]  throw it away and start over you cannot you cannot fix the system that's there it is impossible
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:17.760]  the way it is architected any good program will tell you it says not going to work
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:22.240]  and they can pour money into it another 50 million other hundred million dollars it will
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.840]  never work the way that it is it needs to be redone a friend of mine mike adams who's
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:31.520]  a successful computer programmer he said the same thing two and a half weeks ago he said
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:37.600]  several things he said it looks like basically chimpanzees were in there tied up to keyboards
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:43.200]  writing this it's gibberish it's not even bad code that came out today yes and he said that
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:48.000]  government always throws more money at something that doesn't work when you need to scrap it but
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:52.400]  he said that's what all the top programmers are saying that is what you john McAfee as a well
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:57.760]  known top programmer are saying but clearly the commerce committee knows that too so what do you
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:02.800]  think the real reason is mike and others are saying well now it's actually coming out that
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:07.600]  it's really an nsa front and they're just getting data for who doesn't have insurance to find them
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:12.480]  and it's totally cold-blooded might be might be because it doesn't seem like they were serious
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:18.960]  and actually implementing a medicare system um and you're right the code uh after after the rollout
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:24.160]  there were programmers that went on bulletin boards asking for help on programs that they'd
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:30.080]  been working on for the system all of them indian a cgi has over 10 000 programmers in the country
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:35.920]  of india and they're doing very basic programming in a language that only runs on the front end
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:40.400]  that is your your computer so when you log on to obama care the programs are downloaded to your
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:45.760]  computer and run and then ship the data back it's a very cheap and easy way of doing it and that's
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:50.320]  fine if you have 10 or 20 users but if you have millions it just isn't going to work and that's
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:56.400]  why their architecture can't support it but but they have a company that that whose employees are
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:01.360]  asking for help from the general public on fixing their problems is absurd if you go through the
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:06.400]  code there there are fundamental misspellings in there you know that this shouldn't be happening
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:11.520]  this should be a professional company and that company cgi that that worked for the the the
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:17.120]  government of canada about seven years ago was fired because of incompetence and not delivering
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:21.840]  what they had wanted so why did we choose a canadian company when they're planning of american
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:27.200]  companies that are that are very technically competent in this area i have no idea well that's
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:32.000]  another issue consumer reports is now saying don't go to the website because you can basically have
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.880]  your identity stolen on it absolutely absolutely and it's not just the website you don't even know
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:42.000]  that if it's a legitimate website because there are there are so many examiners that can have their
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.520]  own websites and uh sorry that's my telephone here it kind of sounds cool it's like star trek
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:53.680]  let me turn this sucker off so there's there are so many um uh examiner sites that anybody can put
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:14:00.800]  together and the um uh the sites can be made by hackers they can steal your identity they can
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:05.440]  ask for your social security number and the following day your bank account is going to be empty
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:11.520]  and and this is going to cost consumers in terms of lost income and identity theft more than the
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:18.720]  entire obama care package cost to implement unbelievable and obama came out today i forget
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:25.040]  the exact quote let me look at drudgereport.com and find it he came out and called it a good deal
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:30.160]  and that it's exceeding expectations well i mean i don't know whose expectations those would be
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:34.880]  does that win the bs award of all time well i think so or unless your expectations are dramatically
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:40.240]  lower than than any sane person to want to have so really that makes no sense what would the
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:46.080]  expectations be if in fact when it rolled out you couldn't log on you couldn't get support
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:51.040]  there was no security um and it was it was crashing every three minutes so what what
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:56.560]  expectations could you possibly have that it meant i have no clue this is definitely bullshit
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:05.040]  and again john mackavies our guest in studio going back here then to understand this the
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:10.160]  republican committee a chair calls you up and says help us fix it and they want you to just
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:15.600]  tell them over the phone how to fix something that's like many times more complex than landing
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:20.080]  probably the mars rover on the moon something this complex with all these different hundreds of
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:23.840]  millions of people that are supposed to use it with all these interfaces and all these exchanges
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:27.440]  and nobody's ever made something like this work before from what i've been told right and and
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:32.400]  then they want you over the phone to tell him how to do it right what did you say to him well the
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:36.320]  first thought it wasn't the committee chairman it was the uh the lawyer for the committee got him
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:40.640]  shone haze who who contacted me and he was very flattering he said now i'm sure this won't be a
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:45.760]  heavy lift for you with a manager or expertise and all of this uh i said well okay and then he
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:50.320]  said well but i can't pay you expenses i go well okay i mean i'm a good american you need help i'll
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:56.000]  help then when it got down to um you know we can't get the committee members all together can you do
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:00.320]  this over the phone i realized they're not even serious i never even responded this was an email
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:05.120]  this last one i just they wanted you as a pr name as a pr name say we contacted john mack ify and he's
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:09.680]  given us great advice and don't worry everything's going to be fine but it's not and so i don't want
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:14.000]  to be involved did you give him the advice you gave our listeners scrap it uh well they know that
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.240]  i've been saying that on in the press for a week now um so yeah they have to scrap it and they're
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:22.720]  not going to listen to that or at least scrap the front end i mean without well how do you have a
[02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:28.000]  website based on a law it's got to follow this cockamamie law all right well that's uh that's
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:33.280]  the other problem here technology within the government there are six thousand pages of
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:38.240]  regulations for how you develop technological programs we're in it and it takes years to
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:43.360]  write those regulations technology is an area where every year you throw yourself on a way because
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:49.040]  it's out of date and you get a new one with new features technology is advancing rapidly the
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:54.960]  regulations are years old how on earth can you develop a high tech program using regulations
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:59.440]  that take three years to write that's the fundamental problem it has to be simplified throw the
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:04.160]  regulations out trust the people that you're contracting with get american customer get american
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:10.720]  companies to produce the thing and and and let's get real here well there are laws that
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:15.040]  most of our tech that's government funded should come from the us but they were religiously ignore
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:19.920]  it because of globalism they wanted to industrialize this country so they can pick the winners and
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:25.840]  losers absolutely absolutely but given that then you can't complain when systems don't work you
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:30.960]  can't complain when and i'm not putting down indians by the way or india they are very intelligent
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:36.160]  people in great programmers but cgi takes them and puts them through a three-month training class
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:40.720]  three months and expects them to now produce miracle code it doesn't work and then connect it
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:44.080]  with all the other codes and connect it with all the other code it's like sure that's a very
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:48.240]  cheap way of doing it and you're going to get a lot of code but then how on earth do you fix it
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:52.400]  this is the problem but i've talked to programmers that say and now it's in the news that it's just
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:57.040]  gibberish a lot of it like people just gave up and delivered crap they did because they were under
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:00.720]  the gun for time it has to be done it has to be done i know how that works you're a programmer and
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:05.200]  you don't even understand what the problem is and you're trying to fix it and your boss says get it
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:09.840]  done by friday well you get it done by friday and you turn it in and you hope no one ever runs their
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:14.640]  program to find out that it doesn't work that's like homework you do on the school bus that's it
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:18.800]  on the way on the way you're describing as fast as you can go i hope i hope the teacher doesn't
[02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:23.920]  read this but unfortunately and if we do on these programs and we are the only it found out well yeah
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:28.800]  i mean it's not like common core where they teach the kids two plus two equals four a computer's
[02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:34.000]  got to have it right or it won't work absolutely i guess the banksters percent right exactly i guess
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:39.360]  the banksters and the globalists have finally tried to feed their con artist bull into a computer
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:43.920]  that's it and it's not working it's certainly not working way this was implemented oh man
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.000]  so what do you think is going to happen he's now trying to blame republicans and people
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.240]  that don't like socialist health care for the website failing he did that in a speech today
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:56.160]  well you know i you can blame the manager of the the technologically program and nothing
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:19:02.480]  else cgi is cgi is responsible period for delivering a working program they did not
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:07.840]  because really it was unrealistic given them the the the way that they did it and and they did it
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:11.440]  in order to make money i understand that you've got a certain income you have a hundred million
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:16.160]  dollars so the government's paying you if you can get get it done for 500 000 you have a 99
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:22.320]  0.5 for profit margin but now cgi is going to get more money to fix it to and which they can't
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:26.080]  and they're going to use those same programs because you can't use new ones to to fix an
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:31.840]  existing program whereas if they threw it out grab some really decent programs i mean very top
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:36.240]  notch programmers because program well don't tell them how to fix it we want we want it to fail
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:41.280]  anyway that doesn't matter okay john mac of you were going to break incredible to have this guy
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:46.080]  in studio with us we're going to come back and let him continue on that point in the nsa

[02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:17.760]  everyone was down in police but we need to do a part two maybe for the nightly news with you
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:22.320]  where we go back and show how all the stuff you talked about with us earlier this year I
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:26.160]  grew up I guess last year all of it later turned out to come out it was it was like a
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:30.720]  James Bond movie or something so we'll have an update in the next segment with Mr. McAfee
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:36.960]  with us again I'm Alex Jones if you just tuned in but continuing with healthcare.gov I mean I
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:41.360]  understand as a top programmer you know reportedly genius level by the media and all the stuff you've
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:46.560]  invented over the years that you look at this and you say it could be fixed my issue is I've
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:51.520]  talked to other programmers that are very smart as well they say there's no way government didn't
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:55.200]  know this was a piece of crap it wasn't going to work what do you think's really going on here
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:01.760]  well I mean obviously I mean any sane person is going to test what they have developed at least
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:06.880]  one time and usually you test it for many many months and if the government it has any interest
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:10.960]  in this program then they had to have people monitoring the development so of course they
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:15.600]  knew it wasn't going to work or they didn't bother to test it at all this is this is the bizarre
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:21.600]  truth of the issue so I don't know what's going on I do know that what happened is unthinkable
[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:27.920]  if it were if it were being managed by a true technological manager they would not let this
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:32.960]  happen you build a program you you design it you go through an alpha test period for a few months
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:37.600]  which is you know you you have a few people logging in then a beta test where you simulate
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:42.880]  massive amounts of input and then you fix the problems and you roll it out clearly they didn't
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:48.800]  go through any of that this is this is not the normal way of developing software I don't know
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:55.360]  what it is but but I've never seen it before I keep going back over this because it's just the
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:26:01.520]  whole thing is so not Orwellian more twilight zone because Obama's up there saying it's a great deal
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:07.280]  and exceeding expectations and just bizarreness to be like if my wife came home and I was in bed
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:12.480]  with seven women and I got up and said honey I've never cheated on you baby I mean it's just the
[02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:19.840]  level of BS well you know by the way that is a standard approach I mean if your wife does
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:24.640]  catch you in bed with a woman you deny it I mean it's a fact never ever admit so I guess it is like
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:30.800]  like Bill Clinton said deny deny deny so I guess it is literally uh what's the term they use for
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:37.120]  that in the Pentagon gas lighting that's it that's it so you know I really don't have a clue I am
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:43.200]  not politically connected I can tell you everything you need to know about computers software networking
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:47.680]  a security but I don't have a clue what do you think about something's wrong and it's not going
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:52.240]  the way it should what do you what do you think about the whole NSA thing being exposed we know
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:56.560]  that's been going on for a long time but why now is it getting exposed and where do you think it's
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:01.680]  going well it's getting exposed because because someone Edward Snowden said something and showed
[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:08.160]  us now he's hiding out in Russia now unfortunately Russia however why are we worrying about the NSA
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:13.040]  it's every single covert agency of the government and there are 15 or 20 of those agencies and you
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:19.280]  know for a fact that if one agency is spying on us that they're all spying on us this is a fact
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:26.320]  and they all share information so the CIA the FBI army intelligence they're all watching us I know
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:30.880]  this I've known this for years if I say something people go oh your paranoid you're crazy and it
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:35.680]  takes someone like Snowden to pop up and show us and you go oh my god the NSA is spying on us
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:42.480]  well duh of course they are they have been for years well talking about CGI they do the Pentagon's
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:47.520]  most complex systems so they obviously knew this wasn't going to work so therefore it was done by
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:53.600]  design to put off Obamacare and only bring in the fine part I think clearly it's just there to find
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:58.080]  people it's entirely possible you know I don't know for a fact but but something is going on that
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:03.440]  is that is is not sensible not to the mind of someone who has been developing systems like
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:09.920]  this their whole life so you could be absolutely right let's shift gears into your device I can't
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:13.680]  wait till this comes out and we were talking during the break about the government won't be your
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:18.080]  biggest problem who will be your biggest problem with your device that blocks the NSA I think the
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:26.160]  music industry and the TV industry they are so paranoid about intellectual property that is
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:32.560]  please don't let anybody make one copy of my music or my my video and yet statistically I mean if
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:37.600]  you look at the figures the music industry and the television industry and the movie industry
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:43.680]  has never made more money than they are today with all of the the piracy that's going on and
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:50.560]  also statistics say that people who pirate videos are the most purchasers they pay them more money
[02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:56.080]  for the ones that they do want so they have no reason to be doing what they're doing but I guarantee
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:29:01.040]  there's already been comments made that this is a dangerous product and a dangerous idea that that
[02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:04.480]  they're going to try and block it I want to talk about this when we come back in the long segment
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:10.000]  because it tortures me I have an old TV not that old like five six years that has a DVD player on
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:15.840]  the side that I've run in the garage in the treadmill it broke that DVD player so I went
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:19.440]  got another one plugged it in and it gave me a message and said you're not allowed to run another
[02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:24.240]  device in this anti piracy and these are bought DVDs right I understand and and then I have all
[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:28.960]  this other equipment in here for TV where we're trying to put on a show and I'll buy the equipment
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:34.240]  it's my show it won't let it run over a television right and I can buy I can buy a DVD from Australia
[02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:39.040]  and pay for it legitimately and it will not run on my American DVD player because it's a different
[02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:44.400]  region so it's so it's stopping technological development so that they can kleptocratically
[02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:48.560]  make more money and instead they're screwing up all the devices like Dr. Stallman talks about
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:55.920]  we'll be right back stay with us we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn

[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:24.000]  you were getting into your device i mean tell the audience as much as you can tell them you were
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:28.560]  telling me quite a bit but i don't know if that was in confidence about how revolutionary but
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:35.600]  also simple this is going to be and and what it's going to do uh the device is basically a hardware
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:40.080]  device that interfaces with your smartphone uh you carry it in your pocket it has no screen it
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:44.960]  has an on off switch and a little light to show that the battery is running and that's it um and
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:50.960]  um and we have an application that runs on your your iphone or your android phone uh that when you
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:55.040]  want to switch from the internet to the secure network you press a button and then you're now
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:37:01.200]  in our our network which is anybody else who has one of these devices within a quarter of a mile
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:05.920]  you're communicating and if you're in a city or a college campus there may be thousands of those
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:10.960]  that are that are close by um it's an information sharing network it's a file sharing that looks
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:14.400]  like a new internet or private new internet and it'll start out small of course because
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:19.120]  everyone won't have these things have these things but eventually i mean it's you switch from the
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:24.720]  the current internet to the to the secure internet over and over and over and to begin with you might
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:28.960]  not be able to communicate with someone in india but after a year when we get enough of these and
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:33.760]  and the information is relayed then it'll be just like the internet but it'll be able to get on the
[02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:37.920]  net as the first reason to then protect your identity that's absolutely it protects your
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:42.320]  identity and when you're on the secure part of the network no one knows who you are all of the data
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:47.360]  is encrypted and it's encrypted by a technique that the NSA has not been involved in so they
[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:51.760]  can't break it they can't get into it uh and neither the sender nor the receiver let me guess
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:57.600]  does it have to deal with holograms it does not no sir okay i was trying to if it did i wouldn't
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:03.280]  tell you would i no no i was talking to my dad about this and he said i bet it's a hologram
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:08.640]  in her face i might have smarter than i am in some ways but go ahead no so i i'm not gonna not
[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:13.760]  not gonna say for the simple reason no obviously don't say i don't want people to know so um so
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:18.880]  it's going to be very secure so neither the NSA nor the cia nor the fbi nor army intelligence nor
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:24.720]  anyone can find out who you're talking to what you're saying uh and what you're exchanging which
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:29.120]  is really what we should have that right anyway now now you're a trailblazer in your own right
[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:32.880]  obviously but other great minds are going to hear this but they probably already thought of it
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:36.480]  even if they try to stop you selling this here domestically it's going to be a huge international
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:41.440]  market and then other people are going to make clones or knockoffs and then other technologies
[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:45.840]  they're not going to be able to stop this well they may stop me temporarily of course you know they
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:51.200]  may say you can't sell this and i'll say fine you know you only your your your control stops at
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:56.080]  your boundaries you have canada and mexico and the ocean i'll sell it everywhere else uh it will
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:39:00.640]  have to get here eventually any any technology which is beneficial will eventually get here we
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:06.240]  know that it just may take time the music industry is going to raise hell and and complain uh the
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:11.840]  movie industry is going to complain but you know the intellectual property is is has been way over
[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:16.080]  played by them for the past 10 years well think about it they're trying to get world treaties
[02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:21.600]  that in free speech globally for them they are encroaching on our rights of course in the name
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:28.240]  of their rights i'm sick of it absolutely and so they are they are shutting down operations that
[02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:35.600]  are valid useful things for it's like shutting down telephones because criminals are using it to
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:41.520]  to covertly rob banks or whatever it's insane we we can't we can't protect ourselves to the point
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:46.320]  that we can't even use technology well folks used to hack with a telephone i mean do you ban using
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:50.560]  telephones that's right in fact if the first one to do so is a gentleman captain crunch who got the
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:55.520]  these little whistles captain and he learned how to make tones on it for the old telephone so that
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:59.680]  he could he could make free long-distance calls that was the first telephone hacking well we
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:03.920]  didn't shut down the phones because of that we didn't we just we just arrested him and that's
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:09.600]  a sensible thing to do but now they're wanting us to shut down technologies like file sharing which
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:13.920]  is very useful for everything you have files you've got photographs that you take on vacation
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:17.680]  that you want you want to share with your friends you put it out in the cloud and they can share it
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:22.720]  well do you want to stop that because people can put uh music that they haven't paid for on the
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:29.120]  net that's right you can't have prior restraint you know i ran into anti-gun people uh at uh our
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:35.760]  alamo open carry this saturday and they said you know my daughter got shot at aurora and i said i'm
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:41.280]  sorry through your daughter but statistically crimes using guns are down 49 percent because
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:44.880]  the good guys having guns just department numbers right they didn't even deny that but they still
[02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:49.840]  said well it's still gun owners fault this happened i said if somebody stabbed somebody is it
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:55.440]  the knife makers fault yes or if i sell somebody a car and they drive down the road and kill somebody
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:41:01.520]  this putting the guilt on us when we didn't do it it's just crazy well you know it's an authoritarian
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:05.760]  ism absolutely i've you know i've owned and carried guns ever since i was 12 when my father took me
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:10.880]  hunting for the first time uh and he taught me how to handle guns properly and not to point them
[02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:16.480]  at people and how to load them and unload them and seriously for the past 10 years i have never
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:21.840]  been without a gun except when i shower and when i get paranoid sometimes i don't shower so my wife
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:26.800]  complains you know so um and i've never pointed a gun at anyone certainly never shot at anybody
[02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:33.680]  but it is to me it's a turned if we all carry guns i lived in a town called rodeo new mexico
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:38.880]  small town of a couple hundred people everybody was armed there everybody i love it grand well
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:42.960]  they never had a problem they never had a robbery in the grocery store they never had anything but
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:48.720]  i'm a criminal coming through town that you know pulls a gun out uh in a at a cafe the all the all
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:52.640]  the customers are going to pull a gun well that is criminals are on records that they don't go to
[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:57.440]  small towns and rural areas because they know they know and so what's wrong with that and there's
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:02.560]  no violent crime there we all carried guns but i never saw a gun pulled and well you ask permission
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:06.320]  if you could you know like hey i'm bringing a gun we're like well you better right that's what they
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:10.320]  said so don't try anything here they said we're we're all armed well no but i mean for us it's
[02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:15.120]  like having a pencil or a coffee cup percent it's a tool i sleep with mine now i stopped sleeping
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:20.880]  with it in my hand for obvious reasons okay uh but but i see oh then it gets all lonely yeah you know
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:25.520]  what but nightmares and things like that it's pretty scary that might my car no more just not
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:32.640]  going to be in your hand anymore i said if i lay it next to me here on the bed that's okay um but
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:38.640]  i'm always with a gun and and why not i mean we the criminals have guns and off record you you've
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:44.320]  had a lot of issues i mean there's obviously of course and and i you know i mean for for a month
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:48.720]  and a half the blesion government is actively trying to shoot me and um you know why shouldn't
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:51.840]  i carry guns and why shouldn't i be able to protect myself why are they allowed to have
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:56.080]  guns but we aren't well that's that's the problem isn't it and here's the thing if you if you pass
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:43:00.160]  the law saying we can't have guns i promise you the criminals don't care they're already breaking
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:04.560]  the law do you think they care if they're they're carrying an illegal weapon that's so absurd so
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:08.320]  we're not going to take it out of the hands of the people who are going to do damage with guns
[02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:12.400]  we're taking out of the hands of people who protect themselves from those people who are
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:16.880]  trying to do damage so i don't know and i you know i'm going to have my gun in my hand except
[02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:24.160]  when i'm sleeping or in my pocket or i've got one here now obviously uh and um you know as long as
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:29.440]  i can because it's my it goes back to rural areas we had grizzly bears or or the or the
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:33.760]  immigrants were fighting with the natives i mean it came down to you better have a gun on you or
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:38.880]  you could get killed or you would get killed it's a fact of life i mean you know the the world is
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:43.200]  a dangerous place especially outside of our our comfort well here's my issue we're not worried
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:46.480]  about dead threats around here and stuff because somebody ever tries to come around here with
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:51.840]  something i mean anybody wants to carry a gun in their briefcase for chl you name it folks are
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:55.840]  packing around here right and that's just the way it is and it's peaceful it's happy and everybody's
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:44:00.400]  friendly right if someone does come in here i'll stand with you when i go on all right so ready
[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:06.880]  right now i mean here you go you know i like revolvers myself just because they're you know
[02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:10.160]  you know you know i i do too and i prefer the hammerless oh really i didn't know that's what
[02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:14.560]  you had but well i've got all kinds of guns and i carry different guns for different occasions
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:19.920]  it's loaded here i'll let you i notice yours is not there you go all right there you go i like a
[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:25.600]  357 just because in stressful situation loaded i didn't oh yeah oh yeah a 357 you know in a
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:29.920]  stressful situation is is good it's got the best penetration for something like this question but
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:33.840]  that's that's a little lighted carrying spell it's beautiful it's beautiful so and the hammerless
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:37.440]  variety you know so many times you pull your gun out of your pocket not to not to pointed someone
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:40.560]  just at the end of the day and the hammer gets caught on your pocket look at our guns they're
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:44.960]  they're friendly they're hanging out together right there we get a document cam shot on that
[02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:50.080]  and in fact in fact they here we'll put them over here by you and they could just have some time
[02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:54.960]  together all right all right then look at that it's like powerful they're like changing some
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:45:01.280]  357s too i tell you what the finest little carry gun is is the new ruger that little micro 380
[02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:06.400]  i know he doesn't carry a bunch of a punch but you know it's one of my friend's wives carries that
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:10.560]  in her purse yeah why carry one in each pocket sometimes because they're so light you can't
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:15.120]  see them that you don't even know you're carrying them um you know seven rounds 380 it's way he's
[02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:20.320]  not a bad gun james bond use the the burrata 380 remember that in the first james bond movie
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:25.200]  they try to give a different you're you're like an adventure aren't you what made you go down to
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:32.560]  police i guess adventure why not you know i think we might live once just once and if that's the
[02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:39.120]  case i don't miss anything i don't miss anything alex without getting into your security and things
[02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:45.280]  you're traveling around the us right now i am i'm traveling with security and because of an
[02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:49.120]  incident that happened recently i've beefed up and i'm i'm traveling with some very serious
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:54.560]  security now i did notice that well that's a good thing uh but i mean going back obviously you
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:59.840]  were a computer programmer i think worked at nasa in places going over your bio i mean do you have
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:05.520]  any shadowy background that you think that might be after you for you know not shadowy bad but
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:10.560]  secretive stuff well i mean i had a top secret security clearance for a while when i worked at
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:15.520]  nasa and i did work on some black programs but nothing that that anyone wanted to offer me for
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:21.040]  i think my biggest concern is police you know i have i ran afoul of the blesian government and i
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:25.840]  came back and i stated some some things that maybe should not have been stated that the prime minister
[02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:32.880]  ordered the death of arthur young that john salivar uh was selling passports illegally that may and
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:36.880]  this is the minister of national security he's in charge of the army and the police and of course
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:41.200]  the prime minister is in charge of everything well they're not happy about that and they're afraid
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:46.480]  that if i provide more evidence the the entire government will unravel so obviously i have to
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:53.440]  think that maybe in the back of their minds they would they would feel better if i wasn't here well
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:57.360]  i know you talk is that paranoia may i ask no i don't think that's paranoia i mean knowing what
[02:46:57.360 --> 02:47:02.240]  goes on in the government of police what it's used for how famously piratical it is i don't
[02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:07.200]  know about those individuals but i know that certainly i would be concerned if i had the
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:13.440]  entire blesian mafia style government angry at me right and the other thing is is that they
[02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:18.000]  they have a longer reach than you might imagine for example there are american businesses
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:22.240]  they would love to do business in police for a lot of you know reasons you can do illegal
[02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:28.000]  things there if you if you pay the right people and and your profits can soar and in fact the
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:32.960]  the blesian soccer team came to portland where i live in july that's kind of weird isn't it's
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:37.680]  play soccer and with them there was an american businessman who had a private jet who was flying
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:43.680]  around john salvidar and two other people the the head of the press office in police and a city
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:50.160]  councilman named dean samuels samuels and um you know you look at that and think well you know i
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:54.160]  don't know why did they come to my city why did they had a national security come to my town way
[02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:58.640]  up there you know it's i'm thinking well i don't know maybe i should be cautious and i am cautious
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:03.360]  i don't call that paranoia well i'd be stupid if you aren't i would be sorry but as a result when i
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:08.560]  go somewhere i people people arrive in advance they check things out they look to see if anything
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:13.440]  unusual is happening uh i change venues constantly i tell them when we're staying at one hotel and
[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:20.240]  check into another and when i arrive i arrive with some serious security uh so um well i mean going
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:26.080]  back to balees you were talking about muslims and certain countries and riason it was nowhere in the
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:32.160]  press and then it had to be four months later exactly what you said about that came out uh and
[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:36.800]  you said that's one of the reason they were after you i mean do you now know if you figured out of
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:41.760]  out of all the reasons why you think folks were after you they're actually because of what i knew
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:49.120]  because you know when they raided my my compound in orange walk in in may uh shot my dog in front
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:53.520]  of my eyes did a half million dollars worth of damage kept me handcuffed in the sun for 14 hours
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:57.760]  by the way that's i don't recommend that is something to do for fun alex no that hurts that
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:04.320]  does hurt believe me i tried not to win for the whole day and i didn't um and then left uh and
[02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:09.280]  then came back and said you know you're going to um you know are you going to reconsider giving us a
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:14.720]  donation to the party and i go no i'm not i went to the press uh at that point i started handing
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:20.240]  out presents computers that i had my own software on just to monitor things okay i gave them to the
[02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:25.600]  all the government ministers and their secretaries and their aides and and that's how i found out what
[02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:30.000]  was happening so you gave them a trojan horse i did you made them think they won you started giving
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:34.000]  them goodies absolutely absolutely and just like the general public they just take devices they take
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:37.360]  devices they don't they don't think they don't think what who is this man well i'm john mac if
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:43.440]  you ever say i invented computer security i can't turn on your microphone on your laptop in your
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:50.400]  office and watch what you're doing that's so trivial anybody can do it so it may be in retrospect
[02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:54.320]  it may have been a mistake because then you learned all the secrets you were like your own private
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:58.960]  NSA all the stuff that's going on and it was scary and then i came back and i made the mistake of
[02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:04.560]  actually telling it on the blog and so yeah you know you you would be paranoid too if if you know

[02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:22.320]  because there's a war on for your mind technology is rapidly increasing to say
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:26.960]  the least some people like ray Kurzweil believe that there's going to be a singularity i believe
[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:32.080]  you'll have a singularity in information in news first or something approximating that something
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:37.760]  getting close to it where no matter what the system does they're not going to hide stuff anymore
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:41.200]  and when they try to put out this info that's going to be exposed that's already happening the
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:45.440]  pentagon psyops head came out a few months ago and said they're in deep trouble they're ordered a
[02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:50.400]  lot of the public and the public's catching them and the pentagon said we want to stop lying and
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:53.840]  there are people freaking out during the pentagon briefing that was streamed on the internet right
[02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:57.280]  getting up saying we don't want to lie anymore i mean it was real sure but i think at the higher
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:00.960]  level they told them to do it to try to give people's confidence to go we promise we won't lie
[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:07.920]  anymore but here is ray Kurzweil one of the google execs saying meet the google executive who plans
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:13.360]  to cheat death ray Kurzweil takes 150 vitamins a day so he can hold out long enough for invention
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:18.560]  of robots that will keep humans alive now whether this is real or not in my film in game that i made
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:23.600]  seven years ago i show all the quotes they say humans are bad they're gonna establish world
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:28.400]  government forcibly reduce world population they're gonna merge the machines and live forever
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:33.120]  i didn't say that as the new york times said i was quoting Kurzweil and others here he is back
[02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:40.640]  in the news today this is the daily mail what do you think of of these things because whether it's
[02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:46.640]  feasible down the road or not these people are maniacs who are anti-human what is your take on it
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:53.360]  well you know in one in one respect i i um admire Kurzweil because he i do too he developed some
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:58.720]  some great music okay or musical devices um and a copy of machine or a bunch of others and let's
[02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:03.120]  throw by the copy machine modern he's a scanner scanner right he's a brilliant man there's no
[02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:08.240]  question about it um yeah i don't want to merge with the machine quite frankly i would rather
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:13.600]  become a little more human than i even am i think we become machines by by spending our days watching
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:18.640]  the the television instead of watching the world around i agree and i i think that there's so much
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:23.200]  of modern life which turns us into machines that why bother making a mechanical device to connect
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:27.600]  with us we're already halfway machines i'd like to go the other way and let's get a little more
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:32.880]  human you know let's have more personal face-to-face communication and let's get out and shoot or
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:37.360]  or do what we like to do or just get some fresh air jog around the block how much of that is
[02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:41.600]  is happening these days it's less and less and less and when it does happen it's structured
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:47.360]  and is formalized um so you know yeah it's called quality time to take your kids out in nature
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:51.760]  well quality time should be every every moment of life is as i understand it every single moment
[02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:58.240]  and if you're not having quality time 24 hours a day do something else alex i agree with the
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:03.840]  revolution against tyrants is having fun having friends and not being in the cookie cutter system
[02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:08.800]  that's it exactly you know getting into real life and take some risks because they have
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:14.000]  any quality time is risky it means you've got to get out of get off if you're comfortable sofa
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:20.160]  out of your safe secure house and into a world which is unpredictable and unknown it's a mystery
[02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:24.160]  well isn't that how things were when you were a kid one it's great to get out and and explore
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:28.640]  the mystery of life the mystery of the world all right absolutely going to a friend's house and
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:34.560]  going out in the woods you bet taking on some farmers ranch and picking strawberries in your
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:38.480]  neighbor's backyard at night whether we you know without them knowing whatever it's it's it's an
[02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:42.880]  adventure it's it's it's it's life as it should be we should all be children again they're trying
[02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:48.720]  to insert us into these bubbles where they bombard us with nothing but their propaganda to keep us
[02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:52.720]  from seeing the wider universe all right well that's how they control the city if you see the
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:56.160]  wider universe you're going to ask questions aren't you like what the hell are you saying
[02:57:56.160 --> 02:58:01.760]  you're giving us garbage about obama care but if all we get is the news we some of us are going to
[02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:07.040]  believe it you can fool all the people some of the time but you're talking about singularities
[02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:12.000]  you can't fool all the people all the time what do you think of a singularity i mean you think
[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:18.400]  that really will come i think it's happened in in in many cases i think i think this is evidence
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:24.160]  of it here we have something which is so obviously broken and improper that the president is saying
[02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:28.720]  well that's what i expected that means it meets expectations so it's a con artist singularity
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:32.400]  absolutely like a magician you know doing doing a trick you know don't watch what the left hand
[02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:36.880]  is doing and if we don't watch what the left hand is doing we go wow hold on we got a one minute

[03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:35.200]  reached where now they say this obama care is wonderful the site works better than we thought
[03:01:35.200 --> 03:01:42.640]  but are they trying to overthrow reality by by almost polluting things with so much dis info
[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:47.120]  people kind of go into learn helplessness well you know at first they do but i think you're
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:52.400]  going to find something else you know the common man ultimately is smarter than we give them credit
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:57.840]  for at some point everyone is going to look at each other and think wait a minute the emperor
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:01.840]  has no clothes you know it doesn't matter everybody says okay he's dressed and you someone's
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:06.480]  going to the child's going to say look the emperor's naked the old the old story and and someone's
[03:02:06.480 --> 03:02:11.680]  going to say wait a minute he just said that that this thing is perfect it just says expected
[03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:17.680]  and the world is saying it's broken so at some point we're all going to look at each other and go
[03:02:17.680 --> 03:02:22.960]  all right it is bullshit isn't it and trust me that's what will happen and that's when some the
[03:02:22.960 --> 03:02:28.560]  overthrow i don't mean the armed overthrow i mean we we we go to the polls and we we call everybody
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:33.520]  and we a mental overthrow a mental overthrow a mental overthrow and then and then we look at
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:38.240]  ourselves and we take responsibility and realize what we've done we have allowed this to happen
[03:02:38.240 --> 03:02:42.960]  through fear we're afraid of of the the terrorists we're afraid of the muslims we're afraid of
[03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:48.400]  everything and we we've created we were we've allowed to be created um you know the homeland
[03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:52.480]  security and the transportation security administration all the things that you know i have
[03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:57.040]  to get halfway undressed every time i come like to get here halfway undressed to go through security
[03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:02.480]  well that's really bizarre um and at some point we go to wait a minute i'm not going to be afraid

[03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:26.640]  john mackavy here visiting us in austin texas i think this has been a legendary interview
[03:03:26.640 --> 03:03:31.760]  who is mackavy.com is your website any other points that after this interview is over you wish you
[03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:37.920]  would have made um you know i i think none other than you know when the music industry does rise
[03:03:37.920 --> 03:03:42.400]  up against me when this product comes out and says this is a dangerous product uh you know make your
[03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:47.600]  voices heard uh you know i think they're dangerous trying to bully our freedom of course and preemptively
[03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:51.840]  tie us up because we might do something wrong absolutely they they pull out so many technologies
[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:57.600]  to die because they were a threat to that industry well i want those technologies i would like to
[03:03:57.600 --> 03:04:02.960]  have the right to freely share information let me do that the risk if there's a risk well that's
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:08.160]  too bad well if i commit something then i get in trouble you don't like john mccain said they'll
[03:04:08.160 --> 03:04:12.720]  remote control kill your computer if they think you've downloaded a song illegal with no judge or
[03:04:12.720 --> 03:04:18.080]  jury they'll destroy your computer with no proof because they feel like it of course why not i mean
[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:21.600]  they have the power that's the that's the issue they have the idea well why not i'm doing it for the
[03:04:21.600 --> 03:04:26.560]  better good of everybody like i know what you need alex and i'm going to do what's right for you
[03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:31.120]  don't you worry about thinking and and choosing things for yourself i will decide because we know
