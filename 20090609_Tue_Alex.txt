[08:52.920 --> 09:00.760]  insolvency on state aid rejection arc and door ag owner of the century old
[09:00.760 --> 09:05.080]  department store chain filed for insolvency after attempts to when
[09:05.080 --> 09:10.440]  government help founder jeopardizing 43,000 german jobs and have other

[09:19.080 --> 09:24.040]  proceedings with the direct court in its hometown of eson citing threatening
[09:24.040 --> 09:29.000]  illiquidity german chancellor angela merkel so the collapse was unavoidable
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.680]  after investors in banks offered too little to save the company and i have
[09:33.680 --> 09:41.280]  similar news pouring in now remember the ap article i read yesterday about how
[09:41.280 --> 09:47.040]  the 14.8 trillion in the united states alone given of taxpayer money too far
[09:47.040 --> 09:55.720]  in banks that we not only have given them the money but that we have to pay
[09:55.720 --> 10:00.520]  interest to them on money we gave them that that's how the new order works this
[10:00.520 --> 10:05.200]  is a full gutting a full butchering of our society irrevocably unless we
[10:05.200 --> 10:08.200]  remove these criminals that have done this illegitimately but they're setting
[10:08.200 --> 10:12.400]  up an irrevocable sharecropper bankruptcy there isn't physically enough money in
[10:12.400 --> 10:16.240]  the world to pay back all the debt and any new money created to pay off the
[10:16.240 --> 10:23.720]  debt they just hoard and the ap admitted that they are hoarding all the money and
[10:23.720 --> 10:27.200]  using it to buy up other banks and insurance companies and credit unions
[10:27.200 --> 10:32.520]  that are solvent that would loan and i told you and all of our expert guest
[10:32.520 --> 10:36.400]  told you seven months ago when they passed the banker takeover bill that
[10:36.400 --> 10:41.160]  that money was going to be used to buy up local banks that could keep the
[10:41.160 --> 10:47.160]  economy going solvent banks and if the banks don't want to sell federal
[10:47.160 --> 10:53.680]  regulators come in and say you are forced to sell this is on record just
[10:53.680 --> 11:00.280]  like gm said no we're not going to take our healthy hummer division we're not
[11:00.280 --> 11:04.160]  going to make enough money we're not going to take our other to our opal
[11:04.160 --> 11:08.040]  division that's making money in europe and give it to the big banks
[11:08.040 --> 11:13.600]  predominantly russian and no we're not going to give
[11:13.600 --> 11:16.920]  shatter into the brazilians and the mexicans
[11:16.920 --> 11:21.080]  and obama said you're fired yes you are
[11:21.080 --> 11:27.720]  and on top of hacking up gm and and and no one is even writing about this
[11:27.720 --> 11:33.880]  there is just earth shattering level events going on our economy every day
[11:33.880 --> 11:37.240]  and no one points out how insane it is i mean it's in the ap and bloomberg and
[11:37.240 --> 11:40.600]  the financial page is about all the federal government's giving billions of
[11:40.600 --> 11:44.680]  dollars to this new private equity firm you track back the names they're all
[11:44.680 --> 11:48.080]  bilterberg they're all royalty they're all new world order that you know they're
[11:48.080 --> 11:52.560]  paying brazil billions they're paying russia billions they're paying china
[11:52.560 --> 11:57.720]  billions they're paying europe billions private banking firms to take the already
[11:57.720 --> 12:02.400]  built new factories gm already built most its new factories in mexico and
[12:02.400 --> 12:08.720]  brazil and europe and russia and china in the last ten years
[12:08.720 --> 12:13.920]  this is all this whole implosion of the economy is is just a smoke screen for
[12:13.920 --> 12:18.960]  the transfer that was already underway
[12:18.960 --> 12:25.600]  where walmart's factories china where's targets factories china
[12:25.600 --> 12:29.600]  they brag about it it was meant to displace main street and kill the little
[12:29.600 --> 12:33.600]  towns it was meant to make everybody dependent on the prisons
[12:33.600 --> 12:38.400]  and walmart in little towns or on the power plant in little towns
[12:38.400 --> 12:42.880]  we're all sharecroppers to the new world order and now there's families and farms
[12:42.880 --> 12:46.640]  holding on everywhere as we go into the depression and the feds are coming in
[12:46.640 --> 12:57.040]  with the animal id premises id to shut everything down
[12:57.040 --> 13:00.480]  openly shutting the family farms and ranching and gardening
[13:00.480 --> 13:04.800]  bills to ban gardening without licenses swat teams rating on us selling milk
[13:04.800 --> 13:08.640]  and cheese swat teams rate rating people selling watermelons and eggs
[13:08.640 --> 13:12.240]  don't believe me just search engine it it's every day
[13:12.240 --> 13:16.400]  we are going into technocratic bondage you think prisoners
[13:16.400 --> 13:21.680]  you think black slaves 150 200 years ago we're allowed to grow their own crops
[13:21.680 --> 13:24.960]  have their own food have their own weapons have their own land
[13:24.960 --> 13:28.240]  no because having weapons and having your own land
[13:28.240 --> 13:32.480]  and being self-sufficient means you are sovereign
[13:32.480 --> 13:41.680]  we are going into scientific domestication right now
[13:41.680 --> 13:47.600]  and the ap reported the facts
[13:47.600 --> 13:50.240]  yesterday
[13:50.240 --> 13:55.840]  here's the ap from yesterday all businesses bond market route lifts
[13:55.840 --> 13:58.320]  mortgage costs this is important i'm gonna cover this again
[13:58.320 --> 14:04.320]  then the latest news because i i saw the youtube video of this posted
[14:04.320 --> 14:07.520]  when i was simulcasting at prison planet tv yesterday and people didn't
[14:07.520 --> 14:13.600]  understand what i was saying let me make it very clear for you now
[14:13.600 --> 14:17.120]  because i do have a tendency to go into too many details and not
[14:17.120 --> 14:20.640]  simplify make my statement and then prove it i just go ahead and prove it
[14:20.640 --> 14:24.720]  and it goes over people's heads this is very simple
[14:24.720 --> 14:29.040]  headline ap all businesses bond market route
[14:29.040 --> 14:32.880]  lifts mortgage cost the federal reserve announced at
[14:32.880 --> 14:38.480]  1.2 trillion plan three months ago designed to push down mortgage rates
[14:38.480 --> 14:42.960]  and breathe life into the housing market
[14:42.960 --> 14:49.360]  that is a complete lie we're going to go over the evidence of that
[14:49.360 --> 14:53.360]  but this and other big government spending programs are turning out
[14:53.360 --> 14:58.640]  to have the opposite effect rates and mortgages and us treasury debt are now
[14:58.640 --> 15:02.960]  marching higher as nervous bond investors fret
[15:02.960 --> 15:07.040]  about a reassurgence of inflation
[15:07.040 --> 15:12.000]  and then it goes into how they can cut
[15:12.000 --> 15:19.360]  interest rates the prime rate to zero that's only for big banks
[15:19.360 --> 15:22.640]  for citizens it goes up what happens when greedy
[15:22.640 --> 15:27.040]  criminal banks get 14.8 trillion of our tax money
[15:27.040 --> 15:31.200]  they don't turn around and low and loan it at low interest to the american
[15:31.200 --> 15:33.600]  people or the people of canada or the people of
[15:33.600 --> 15:38.000]  mexico or the people of europe or england or australia
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.480]  they hoard the money that's money so they cannot loan
[15:44.480 --> 15:47.920]  they've done this in hundreds of other countries we knew what they would do
[15:47.920 --> 15:52.640]  i told you exactly what they do they do the same thing
[15:53.520 --> 15:56.480]  it's like the parable
[15:56.480 --> 16:04.160]  of the frog and the scorpion and there's a river a creek
[16:04.160 --> 16:07.440]  it's a creek in the old i think it's a african parable
[16:07.440 --> 16:12.720]  it's a creek of little fjord a little
[16:12.800 --> 16:16.720]  stream and there's a frog sitting there and a scorpion comes over and he says
[16:16.720 --> 16:21.440]  oh mr frog you're so nice knowing the frog has a
[16:21.440 --> 16:29.280]  nice demeanor good natured he says will you carry me across i can't swim
[16:29.280 --> 16:33.280]  the frog says mr scorpion you are a scorpion you will sting me
[16:33.280 --> 16:37.920]  you will kill me he said no no i want to be your friend i just want to go across
[16:37.920 --> 16:40.800]  will will you take me across and the frog being trusting
[16:40.800 --> 16:43.840]  says yes i will take you across if you promise that he says i promise
[16:43.840 --> 16:46.800]  so the scorpion climbs on his back and the frog swims across and when he gets
[16:46.800 --> 16:50.480]  the other side the scorpion jumps off says thank you stings him
[16:50.480 --> 16:53.440]  and as the frog lays their dying and excruciating pain
[16:53.440 --> 17:00.320]  he says why did you sting me why did you lie why did he said i'm a scorpion
[17:00.320 --> 17:04.160]  i'm an international crime syndicate banker we openly run giant child
[17:04.160 --> 17:08.000]  kidnapping rings we finance the fascist and the
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.280]  communist we funded hitler we funded eugenics
[17:13.280 --> 17:16.960]  we're going to enslave you we're predators we think it's fun to do it
[17:16.960 --> 17:22.800]  and you are gullible slaves like the frog and you sit there and you take it
[17:22.800 --> 17:28.800]  well i am neither frog nor scorpion i am neither wolf nor sheep i'm a sheep dog
[17:28.800 --> 17:34.800]  as the founding fathers described it and i hate wolves
[17:34.800 --> 17:39.040]  and the sheep won't listen to me they like to when the wolf comes over and
[17:39.040 --> 17:41.760]  goes psst hey come over here in the woods with me i
[17:41.760 --> 17:44.560]  i want to show you something really neat i'm your friend don't listen to that
[17:44.560 --> 17:48.160]  stupid sheep dog he's trying to keep you from having a great time and
[17:48.160 --> 17:51.680]  he's trying to be uppity and show off to you trying to boss you around all day
[17:51.680 --> 17:56.000]  and tell you not to trust me come on in the woods you'll show him
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.080]  and the sheep being sheep they like to march off in the woods
[18:00.080 --> 18:04.160]  and even as the sheep on the hill with the sheep dog watch the wolves tear
[18:04.160 --> 18:09.040]  you've ever seen a wolf tear a sheep up they got videos of it go to youtube
[18:09.040 --> 18:14.560]  fact later when we go live at prismplanet.tv let's show wolves killing sheep let's show
[18:14.560 --> 18:17.520]  that to everybody
[18:18.400 --> 18:23.920]  i used the analogy yesterday of lions in the african savannah yes i know lions
[18:23.920 --> 18:29.520]  are on the savannah they're in they're in india
[18:30.000 --> 18:35.920]  asia used to be the middle east and in north africa but got hunted out but

[24:35.600 --> 24:40.080]  but only of the federal government and the issuance of currency
[24:40.080 --> 24:45.040]  and in the 150 years of history this nation had
[24:45.040 --> 24:50.720]  there had been such incredible wealth generated in such free market and so
[24:50.720 --> 24:53.600]  much private land and industry developed
[24:53.600 --> 24:57.040]  that it has taken them now 90 plus years
[24:57.040 --> 25:01.840]  to turn us into domesticated slaves and now they're putting the final pieces

[25:06.720 --> 25:10.480]  the surfs that live under feudalism it's exactly the system they're setting up

[25:32.960 --> 25:37.360]  the aztecs did the same thing it's the same thing the mayan cultures
[25:37.360 --> 25:41.280]  elites always develop the same caste systems the same control systems and
[25:41.280 --> 25:45.840]  we know what tyranny is we know what bondage is we know what stagnation is
[25:45.840 --> 25:49.840]  and it's happening it's not enough for them to bankrupt the economy though
[25:49.840 --> 25:53.280]  by design which they bragged they've done and i'm having world bank documents
[25:53.280 --> 25:56.880]  we've been covering since 2002 when i wrote the book to send to tyranny
[25:56.880 --> 25:59.680]  this is on record they've done it in third world countries again over and
[25:59.680 --> 26:02.240]  over again and first world nations as well look at
[26:02.240 --> 26:05.440]  iceland look at argentina was the first world
[26:05.440 --> 26:09.600]  nation look at iraq look at syria they'll use military if they have to
[26:09.600 --> 26:12.480]  as a last resort if they can't come in and buy you off and put a central bank
[26:12.480 --> 26:16.800]  in it's not enough for them to just bankrupt you
[26:16.800 --> 26:21.680]  they want to further bankrupt you and then through the panic
[26:21.680 --> 26:25.760]  had the entire gdp more than the gdp in seven months
[26:25.760 --> 26:30.800]  of money pumped into them to buy up what's left of the infrastructure and
[26:30.800 --> 26:35.360]  banks and insurance companies and to buy off the cattleman's association
[26:35.360 --> 26:38.720]  which is now helping to shut down the small
[26:38.720 --> 26:44.320]  ranches they work for the meat packers now it's the same for every
[26:44.320 --> 26:49.200]  industry the farmer associations the big ones openly paid by these groups
[26:49.200 --> 26:54.640]  that's why we're in deep trouble they've bought off all the major leadership
[26:56.400 --> 26:58.880]  and i know a lot of you are finally listening because things are getting
[26:58.880 --> 27:01.920]  worse and worse you're seeing everything we talked about a year ago two years
[27:01.920 --> 27:05.760]  ago three years ago 10 years ago 12 years ago 13 years ago
[27:05.760 --> 27:10.080]  happening now because everything that we've seen for this point was
[27:10.080 --> 27:13.040]  preparation
[27:13.840 --> 27:17.440]  everything up to this point was kind of like an aggy bonfire
[27:17.440 --> 27:22.480]  spending weeks and weeks building the monstrosity now they set it on fire
[27:22.480 --> 27:25.520]  and i've been sitting here the last 13 years going they're building a bonfire
[27:25.520 --> 27:29.120]  to burn our liberties they're building a bonfire you're like oh that's a bunch of
[27:29.120 --> 27:32.320]  wood they're piling up i don't know why they're piling it up but don't say it's
[27:32.320 --> 27:35.840]  a bonfire you've been in denial and now they've
[27:35.840 --> 27:40.560]  let the thing on fire there's no more denial what it is it's burning our
[27:40.560 --> 27:44.560]  liberties of the ground it's an attempt to irrevocably
[27:44.560 --> 27:49.280]  make us domesticated and controlled and then what comes after that is even
[27:49.280 --> 27:51.440]  worse and i know it's horrifying i know it's hard to
[27:51.440 --> 27:54.720]  believe but it's in black and white it's in the mainstream news now every day
[27:54.720 --> 27:59.920]  but with their spin on it world government with one child
[27:59.920 --> 28:03.440]  policies in the u.s they're going to pass laws
[28:03.440 --> 28:06.640]  that if you have more than one child you're going to pay a tax
[28:06.640 --> 28:11.200]  and cps is going to harass you they're already harassing homeschoolers
[28:11.200 --> 28:14.240]  and they've got all these tv shows that they make the kids watching school to
[28:14.240 --> 28:18.560]  tattle on their parents that that second amendment's bad that
[28:18.560 --> 28:21.840]  that carbon footprints are bad that breathing is bad there
[28:21.840 --> 28:25.120]  remember four months ago the new york times and la times i tried to search
[28:25.120 --> 28:27.360]  that article this morning couldn't find it again i couldn't remember the exact
[28:27.360 --> 28:32.480]  headline somebody find it and posted or send it to rob d and info wars dot com
[28:32.480 --> 28:35.680]  i know in the article it said we're we're going to get rid of the terms we've
[28:35.680 --> 28:38.320]  been using on global warming because that's clearly a fraud white house
[28:38.320 --> 28:42.240]  minutes got released with this think tank pr firm
[28:42.240 --> 28:45.760]  and they said we've got to say we're losing our atmosphere
[28:45.760 --> 28:49.280]  we've got to say the earth is in violent climate change we've got to stabilize
[28:49.280 --> 28:52.720]  the climate it was all the new terms they're supposed to use and suddenly
[28:52.720 --> 28:56.320]  you see all these documentaries and films and tv shows it's we're losing our
[28:56.320 --> 29:02.960]  atmosphere into space total complete absolute lie
[29:02.960 --> 29:06.560]  first it was we got too much carbon dioxide when it's been 14 times higher in
[29:06.560 --> 29:12.560]  our history and is good causes the plants to create more oxygen
[29:12.560 --> 29:16.320]  but no way that's kind of true because the earth is in a low carbon dioxide
[29:16.320 --> 29:19.120]  low oxygen level right now according to the ice core samples
[29:19.120 --> 29:22.320]  but that's not because a man
[29:22.320 --> 29:30.640]  so why are they now shifting gears into these new
[29:30.640 --> 29:32.720]  terms they've been caught in their old lies
[29:32.720 --> 29:35.600]  kind of like in the 70s they said it was going to be a new ice age
[29:35.600 --> 29:38.640]  then it got hot and they said it was a new warming period now it's getting
[29:38.640 --> 29:41.200]  cold again they're saying ice age again climate change
[29:41.200 --> 29:44.880]  now the truth is that earth gets hot and gets cold gets hot and gets cold
[29:44.880 --> 29:48.960]  and the main driver is the sun that just cooled off two years ago
[29:48.960 --> 29:55.040]  stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:55.040 --> 30:00.480]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:51.040 --> 33:56.960]  and then he brings out the old plan he had repackaged headline obama repackaged
[33:56.960 --> 34:00.880]  a stimulus plan with old promises associated press and see that's what
[34:00.880 --> 34:03.600]  he'll do it's false hope he just keeps people
[34:03.600 --> 34:07.600]  strung along that's what a ponzi scheme scammer does
[34:07.600 --> 34:10.640]  they keep you strung along and you don't want to believe you're getting hurt
[34:10.640 --> 34:14.160]  you don't believe you're being scammed same thing george bush did same thing
[34:14.160 --> 34:16.640]  obama does because they work for the same
[34:16.640 --> 34:19.920]  interest and until we grow up and figure that out it's only going to get
[34:19.920 --> 34:22.240]  worse
[34:23.040 --> 34:26.160]  hey malt gendritch at republican fundraisers says obama has already
[34:26.160 --> 34:29.920]  failed so gendritch is now preparing for a comeback with the republican party
[34:29.920 --> 34:33.040]  and to run for president acting like he hasn't been part of
[34:33.040 --> 34:38.480]  betraying conservatism part of derailing the revolution in 94
[34:38.480 --> 34:44.960]  cfr new world order bill derbergh group not a conservative another phony
[34:44.960 --> 34:50.080]  we'll get into that europe swings right as depression deepens
[34:50.080 --> 34:53.600]  london telegraph headline europe swings right
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.360]  as depression deepens
[34:58.000 --> 35:03.840]  see we're on the opposite track here in the united states
[35:03.840 --> 35:07.840]  whenever there's a republican in office over here
[35:07.840 --> 35:12.880]  there's a liberal in office over there in europe and england on average
[35:12.880 --> 35:16.400]  whenever there is a liberal over here there's a conservative government over
[35:16.400 --> 35:21.680]  there they're just on a different staged
[35:21.680 --> 35:25.280]  relay and exchange of power by the two different wings
[35:25.280 --> 35:28.080]  of the new world order the phony controlled left the phony controlled
[35:28.080 --> 35:32.480]  right and so they're getting ready in europe
[35:32.480 --> 35:36.400]  and england to throw out labor throw out the left
[35:36.400 --> 35:40.720]  and then put in the phony right wing and the borders will stay wide open and the
[35:40.720 --> 35:44.720]  gunbands will stay in place and the high taxes will stay in place
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.240]  and the cameras will keep going up and the checkpoints will continue
[35:48.240 --> 35:54.320]  to intensify they'll just be different rhetoric
[35:54.320 --> 35:58.880]  just like over here george bush goes out of office they put barack obama in
[35:58.880 --> 36:02.160]  over there they're getting ready to throw out labor and they're going to put
[36:02.160 --> 36:05.920]  the tories in in england same thing in europe
[36:05.920 --> 36:09.920]  the established left has been crushed across most of europe
[36:09.920 --> 36:15.040]  just as it was in the early 1930s see the idea here is oh hitler's coming to
[36:15.040 --> 36:18.160]  power we have seen the ultimate crisis of capitalism
[36:18.160 --> 36:21.680]  but marxist historian eric
[36:21.680 --> 36:25.600]  hobs one calls the dramatic equivalent of the collapse of the soviet union
[36:25.600 --> 36:29.360]  yet socialists have completely failed to reap any gain
[36:29.360 --> 36:32.560]  from the seeming vindication of their views
[36:32.560 --> 36:39.120]  what disinformation from the london telegraph this is not
[36:39.120 --> 36:43.280]  this is not capitalism failing
[36:43.680 --> 36:48.080]  see all the terms are false this is private offshore banks
[36:48.080 --> 36:52.320]  blowing out economies to consolidate power and then they'll remove one group
[36:52.320 --> 36:56.080]  of their puppets the puppet politicians will get the blame
[36:56.080 --> 36:58.960]  instead of their controllers and then they'll put in a new group of puppets
[36:58.960 --> 37:02.320]  and in four or five years people will figure out they're bad and put the
[37:02.320 --> 37:09.040]  liberals back in and so it goes on and on and on the simple scam working on the
[37:09.040 --> 37:12.880]  simple minds and all these headlines in time
[37:12.880 --> 37:17.600]  in newsweek we're all socialists now capitalism failed
[37:17.600 --> 37:24.240]  no the free market was hijacked and crony capitalism fascism
[37:24.240 --> 37:27.440]  what musolini called corporatism has taken over
[37:27.440 --> 37:34.480]  offshore banks rule our governments congress is on record it isn't liberal
[37:34.480 --> 37:38.080]  it isn't conservative it isn't fascist it isn't communist
[37:38.080 --> 37:41.360]  it's command and control until 150 years ago
[37:41.360 --> 37:45.920]  it was liberty versus tyranny it was command and control
[37:45.920 --> 37:49.600]  versus freedom and free market but then they created left
[37:49.600 --> 37:53.680]  right to confuse people and then made the debate about that
[37:53.680 --> 37:58.800]  it's a total distraction i know i harp on this and harp on this and harp on
[37:58.800 --> 38:02.400]  this and i know you as an audience great intelligent people understand it but
[38:02.400 --> 38:07.760]  the general public is starting to get it but not completely
[38:07.760 --> 38:11.760]  it is not socialism to have europe give 10 trillion dollars and growing
[38:11.760 --> 38:16.080]  to offshore private banks and it tax their people to pay the bankers
[38:16.080 --> 38:21.600]  that is robbery that is bondage to a private imperial money power
[38:21.600 --> 38:27.040]  this is europe being colonized by the international bankers being looted and
[38:27.040 --> 38:32.160]  squeezed and socially engineered into tyranny
[38:32.160 --> 38:35.520]  and the public sees that so they're trying to throw out the social engineer
[38:35.520 --> 38:38.080]  quote liberals who they know are raping them
[38:38.080 --> 38:42.160]  hoping conservatives who were speaking out against the bankers right now
[38:42.160 --> 38:47.200]  will stop the looting but see now it's time for the fake
[38:47.200 --> 38:50.160]  conservatives to come in because the looting is already irrevocable
[38:50.160 --> 38:53.120]  so now they can act like they were against it but you watch they'll do
[38:53.120 --> 38:56.640]  nothing now that they're going into power
[38:56.640 --> 39:02.480]  it's always the same until we look past the puppets to the elites
[39:02.480 --> 39:05.680]  the bankers engineer financial crisis panic the public
[39:05.680 --> 39:08.800]  get tens of trillions of dollars for themselves in quote money to
[39:08.800 --> 39:13.440]  restart the economy and then they hold all the money hoarding it on record
[39:13.440 --> 39:17.440]  to further bankrupt things so they can come in at the absolute rock bottom
[39:17.440 --> 39:21.600]  probably two years out and buy up everything and then
[39:21.600 --> 39:24.400]  even tell the suckers that oh the market's back up now
[39:24.400 --> 39:27.760]  everything's fine so that the soccer moms and people will keep their money in
[39:27.760 --> 39:32.320]  the stock market so they can further steal the rest of it
[39:32.320 --> 39:38.160]  there's no end to the suckering and the scamming and the stealing
[39:38.640 --> 39:42.240]  and i'm going to cover all of this and get into how the feds have now announced
[39:42.240 --> 39:45.280]  what i told you six years ago they do because i watched homeland security
[39:45.280 --> 39:48.880]  hearings on c-span they are now going to have permanent
[39:48.880 --> 39:52.720]  checkpoints in all subways nationwide and search everyone
[39:52.720 --> 39:56.320]  and then it will be on the streets and in malls and in walmart
[39:56.320 --> 39:59.920]  there will be metal detectors and frisking and searching
[39:59.920 --> 40:03.760]  everywhere you go hardened checkpoints on the highways
[40:03.760 --> 40:08.080]  it's now been announced and we'll go over it i mean you are going to live in
[40:08.080 --> 40:10.560]  something far worse than the soviet union or
[40:10.560 --> 40:15.360]  nazi germany or soviet china this is because the new economy is going to be
[40:15.360 --> 40:19.440]  thugs and checkpoints and being searched
[40:20.240 --> 40:23.440]  now i'm going to play the audio this video that's up on info wars dot com and
[40:23.440 --> 40:27.200]  i'm asking info warriors to go get it
[40:27.200 --> 40:31.520]  alex jones calls for patriots to aid him nobody is fighting the new world order
[40:31.520 --> 40:34.640]  more effectively than we are does that mean we're perfect no
[40:34.640 --> 40:39.520]  in fact it scares me that we're the biggest and best there is
[40:39.520 --> 40:42.800]  but we need funds to expand what we're doing and george soros
[40:42.800 --> 40:46.400]  is funding all these anti-liberty films and trying to put them out virally like
[40:46.400 --> 40:49.760]  we are showing what we're doing is effective
[40:49.760 --> 40:53.280]  and we are reaching more and more people everywhere i go
[40:53.280 --> 40:57.920]  i was just talking to my uncle in east texas and he said that he was in town
[40:57.920 --> 41:00.400]  and people were listening to me on a local
[41:00.400 --> 41:04.000]  the local station only had me on a few months and that everyone
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.680]  was talking about the show and that everyone was talking
[41:07.680 --> 41:11.840]  about fighting the new world order and that everybody they knew was waking up
[41:11.840 --> 41:14.720]  i'm telling you it's exponential we've hit the zeitgeist
[41:14.720 --> 41:20.000]  but we need the funds to expand and hire extra video editors extra webmasters
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.440]  moderators on the chat rooms all of it i need your support to expand now
[41:25.440 --> 41:30.080]  i'm asking you for aid this is history and we're not the globalist the irs comes
[41:30.080 --> 41:33.360]  and forces you to give money
[41:33.360 --> 41:36.880]  we don't do that they take your money and use it against you
[41:36.880 --> 41:39.840]  if the people would come together and start supporting people fighting the new
[41:39.840 --> 41:42.400]  world order we still have time that's why they want to
[41:42.400 --> 41:46.160]  bankrupt us so we can't financially fight them i need your support to expand
[41:46.160 --> 41:57.120]  the info war here it is
[41:57.120 --> 42:01.600]  twelve months ago listeners of mine had the idea to have an info wars dot com
[42:01.600 --> 42:06.160]  money bomb eric nordstrom a great guy started an info wars money bomb
[42:06.160 --> 42:09.520]  and i kind of ignored it at first as i said i don't want to ask for money
[42:09.520 --> 42:12.880]  something never did i tried to fund things through video sales and radio
[42:12.880 --> 42:16.000]  advertising but the money bomb was successful
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.200]  we embraced it and it raised over two hundred thousand dollars and that allowed
[42:19.200 --> 42:23.040]  us to build this radio slash tv studio
[42:23.040 --> 42:25.920]  now it's a year later i want to give you a quick report of what we've been able
[42:25.920 --> 42:29.120]  to do after the money bomb last year it took us about three
[42:29.120 --> 42:33.920]  months to find a suitable facility then for the
[42:33.920 --> 42:37.760]  renovations it was basically a gutted warehouse
[42:37.760 --> 42:41.280]  that took another three months with us busting our butt to get it done
[42:41.280 --> 42:45.360]  then it took a couple months to move in so we've been in here about four or five
[42:45.360 --> 42:49.760]  months jason bermas is in here on saturday working on his film
[42:49.760 --> 42:53.600]  invisible empire and that's what we intend to do we intend to start producing
[42:53.600 --> 42:58.080]  two or three simultaneous films at one time but that takes more equipment
[42:58.080 --> 43:01.840]  more personnel more people we had the last info wars money bomb
[43:01.840 --> 43:06.640]  a year ago the start of the summer 2008 is now the start of the summer 2009
[43:06.640 --> 43:10.480]  we're having a june 11th 2009 money bomb
[43:10.480 --> 43:13.440]  and i announced i was going to do this a few weeks ago and it kind of crept up on
[43:13.440 --> 43:15.920]  me that we're just a couple days away from it
[43:15.920 --> 43:19.760]  coming up this thursday on june 11th and without this
[43:19.760 --> 43:24.720]  new money bomb i won't be able to hire an extra video editor an extra webmaster
[43:24.720 --> 43:28.480]  and more of the equipment i need to actually produce
[43:28.480 --> 43:31.600]  a once a week television show we've looked at the time
[43:31.600 --> 43:34.800]  how much it's going to cost how we get it on dishnet worker direct tv
[43:34.800 --> 43:38.160]  we're very close to doing that this is the studio
[43:38.160 --> 43:42.640]  where the obama deception was made so in the last 12 months that we
[43:42.640 --> 43:46.000]  found this place renovated it moved out of our own office
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.480]  built these studios we also made the obama deception
[43:50.480 --> 43:54.080]  released the erin russo interview and released three other
[43:54.080 --> 43:59.360]  many films as well right out of this studio think of what we can do in the
[43:59.360 --> 44:02.240]  next year if we set up one or two more studios
[44:02.240 --> 44:06.400]  churn out more groundbreaking films ladies and gentlemen the obama deception
[44:06.400 --> 44:10.480]  in two months online conservatively has reached 15 million people
[44:10.480 --> 44:14.160]  if you go count up all the youtube and google and live leak and blip tv
[44:14.160 --> 44:19.040]  versions of it 15 million made right here in this little room
[44:19.040 --> 44:22.720]  if you financially support us we will make more viral films
[44:22.720 --> 44:26.720]  and put them out for free that will devastate the new world order
[44:26.720 --> 44:30.160]  this jumbo cubicle right here is where i plan to put
[44:30.160 --> 44:35.440]  a second video editing studio so we can work on two films at least two films
[44:35.440 --> 44:40.240]  simultaneously with the viewing screen a couple of computers here
[44:40.240 --> 44:44.400]  so we can get the work done also we're gonna have another audio studio in here
[44:44.400 --> 44:47.360]  right now we have one so we're trying to raise money
[44:47.360 --> 44:51.760]  to build this little video studio as well and we're doing it as
[44:51.760 --> 44:56.400]  inexpensively as is possible people send me emails and say
[44:56.400 --> 45:01.360]  put your films out for free we do put them out for free and then we say if you
[45:01.360 --> 45:05.840]  like to support us buy the high quality dvd but the films
[45:05.840 --> 45:08.800]  aren't paying for this the films aren't paying for what we're doing i have to
[45:08.800 --> 45:11.440]  take advertising and then that's not enough
[45:11.440 --> 45:15.360]  it's this yearly money bomb that's going to allow us to go to the next
[45:15.360 --> 45:18.960]  level all these big news websites we have been visited by millions of people
[45:18.960 --> 45:23.120]  we need to have more webmasters more news being posted more videos being posted
[45:23.120 --> 45:27.440]  more tips being read erin dykes you know does a lot of video editing
[45:27.440 --> 45:32.000]  and writing of stories himself and so we have everybody who's multitasking here
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.240]  we desperately need more people there's nowhere where there's a bigger bang
[45:36.240 --> 45:38.960]  for the buck and when it comes to reaching people
[45:38.960 --> 45:42.560]  than what we see right here out of this office if we can hire just another
[45:42.560 --> 45:46.480]  webmaster to pick up some of the slack to fill in on weekends to come in when
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.000]  there's a big story breaking that'll take a lot of pressure
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.480]  off the other guys and so we need to fill this empty cubicle
[45:54.480 --> 45:58.320]  and that's up to you if you will donate on the june 11 2009
[45:58.320 --> 46:02.640]  money bomb we'll build that new studio we'll put another webmaster in here
[46:02.640 --> 46:06.400]  we're going to hire another video editor but that is all up to you this is
[46:06.400 --> 46:10.080]  where the podcast goes out the live radio show the video feeds
[46:10.080 --> 46:13.680]  that's all done in here by a team of three guys
[46:13.680 --> 46:17.600]  okay and that's what you're funding and support and buying the books and videos
[46:17.600 --> 46:20.880]  not just the money bomb is done it's allowed us to do this we're reaching
[46:20.880 --> 46:25.040]  millions and millions of new people every month we want to reach millions of new
[46:25.040 --> 46:29.360]  minds every week and that's what we plan to do in the next 12 months if we get
[46:29.360 --> 46:32.960]  the support we need please go to infowarsmoneybomb.com
[46:32.960 --> 46:37.120]  sign up at the pledge area and pledge to give on June 11 2009
[46:37.120 --> 46:40.560]  you can go ahead and donate now if you'd like but we're asking folks if they can
[46:40.560 --> 46:45.040]  to wait till June 11 to be part of this event and to give on that day
[46:45.040 --> 46:49.040]  and to hopefully at least reach the same goal we hit last year
[46:49.040 --> 46:53.840]  of $250,000 let's continue this is the only big space we have left
[46:53.840 --> 46:57.680]  and i had intended when we moved into the 7,800 square foot building
[46:57.680 --> 47:05.200]  to build a little tv studio out here but i've talked to people
[47:05.200 --> 47:08.640]  and and bought on the construction crews and we've decided there's really
[47:08.640 --> 47:12.480]  not enough room plus it's going to be hard to produce tv shows in here
[47:12.480 --> 47:16.400]  while the it guys cubicle is right over there
[47:16.400 --> 47:22.400]  and while the radio control cubicle is right there and then the administrative
[47:22.400 --> 47:26.800]  office is right there so we need to get even more space and it
[47:26.800 --> 47:30.480]  just so happens the space next to us in the warehouse
[47:30.480 --> 47:36.560]  is open and very very inexpensive also wanted to show you the shipping part of
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.320]  the building because if we're able to get more funds in
[47:40.320 --> 47:44.720]  we can get the space right through that wall right next door to us
[47:44.720 --> 47:49.520]  and have room to actually have the british burkey water filters and things
[47:49.520 --> 47:52.640]  so we can have them in-house and ship them out to you instead of drop shipping
[47:52.640 --> 47:57.200]  them we can have more t-shirts right now we carry about 20 t-shirts we've
[47:57.200 --> 48:00.240]  designed that takes up massive amounts of room we need
[48:00.240 --> 48:04.560]  more warehouse space so we can carry more gear more information
[48:04.560 --> 48:08.160]  more videos more books not just the books and films i've made
[48:08.160 --> 48:11.280]  because all of this is about creating a culture of liberty
[48:11.280 --> 48:14.960]  identifying ourselves having communities growing
[48:14.960 --> 48:18.960]  and we're starting to do that we're becoming the mainstream these are the

[48:46.560 --> 48:50.800]  massive successes my little office my little organization what we've done in
[48:50.800 --> 48:54.400]  the info war thanks to the great listeners of my radio show
[48:54.400 --> 48:58.080]  and the activism they've engaged in that rivals
[48:58.080 --> 49:02.640]  the build-up to what we witnessed in 1775 and 1776
[49:02.640 --> 49:07.920]  i salute all of you we are reaching millions of new people every month and
[49:07.920 --> 49:12.000]  we reached tens of millions total i want to start reaching
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.280]  millions of new people with the truth every single week
[49:15.280 --> 49:18.960]  take george soros he has now funded along with others
[49:18.960 --> 49:22.880]  a new film called home that's getting posted on all the big news sites all the
[49:22.880 --> 49:25.040]  big websites corporate media is pushing it
[49:25.040 --> 49:28.480]  and had like a million views the first day it's trying to rival loose change
[49:28.480 --> 49:32.800]  final cut and terror storm and in game and films like the obama
[49:32.800 --> 49:35.600]  deception well soros and others are now funding films
[49:35.600 --> 49:39.120]  like home that teach you neo feudalism neo serfdom is
[49:39.120 --> 49:42.160]  good that carbon footprints are bad that humans
[49:42.160 --> 49:45.600]  are bad that basically neo eugenics is good
[49:45.600 --> 49:48.960]  that's what all this is about and they're now
[49:48.960 --> 49:51.840]  mimicking what we do give out free dvds have
[49:51.840 --> 49:55.920]  video viewing parties at your house you know spread this video link
[49:55.920 --> 50:00.560]  they're doing what we've done with the patriot films we've released in the
[50:00.560 --> 50:05.440]  films we promoted and that shows that they realize that the model we
[50:05.440 --> 50:09.520]  pioneered is a real threat to them so they're trying to counter us with that
[50:09.520 --> 50:13.120]  right now but i don't have george soros's billions
[50:13.120 --> 50:16.960]  he gives millions of dollars to produce one of these little propaganda films
[50:16.960 --> 50:19.680]  i can make an obama deception for a hundred thousand dollars
[50:19.680 --> 50:22.560]  and i do that and then give it out free on the web
[50:22.560 --> 50:26.480]  with advertising money and my paycheck from the radio network
[50:26.480 --> 50:30.080]  but that didn't cut it with employees and webmasters and bandwidth
[50:30.080 --> 50:33.760]  i try with advertising and and and all of this to fund things
[50:33.760 --> 50:37.760]  and it just doesn't do it a money bomb will let us go to the next level
[50:37.760 --> 50:41.440]  the last one really helped us and so please i want to make it bigger than

[54:38.160 --> 54:42.560]  we're able to rival what they're doing while the internet is still free and
[54:42.560 --> 54:45.280]  open which they openly meant they're moving in the next few years
[54:45.280 --> 54:49.360]  to try to curtail and shut down and restrict we got to move now
[54:49.360 --> 54:52.480]  we are in the prime position to fight the new world order we have to take on
[54:52.480 --> 54:55.600]  more responsibility we have to take action we have to work
[54:55.600 --> 54:58.800]  more we have to make not two or three films a year but five or six
[54:58.800 --> 55:02.480]  powerful films a year we have to expand what we're doing

[55:19.040 --> 55:22.960]  and that's the most important point that has to be made here
[55:22.960 --> 55:29.360]  the government takes your tax money gives it to offshore banks then they
[55:29.360 --> 55:33.440]  openly have given hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[55:33.440 --> 55:37.520]  billions of dollars just the last 10 years alone
[55:37.520 --> 55:42.800]  to tax free foundations bellarmine negates foundation ford foundation
[55:42.800 --> 55:48.080]  Carnegie foundation and hundreds of others on record
[55:48.080 --> 55:52.080]  who then run around making films and paying for tv shows and funding mpr and
[55:52.080 --> 55:55.440]  funding pbs and they then fence the money out
[55:55.440 --> 55:59.280]  and start tv radio networks i mean it's just amazing
[55:59.280 --> 56:01.920]  and then the federal government admits themselves they're spending tens of
[56:01.920 --> 56:05.840]  billions a year on fake newscast and buying off reporters
[56:05.840 --> 56:08.640]  remember the one scandal whenever they get caught doing something when it came
[56:08.640 --> 56:10.720]  out thousands of reporters were on their payroll
[56:10.720 --> 56:14.560]  they limited it by making it all about one person oh
[56:14.560 --> 56:17.920]  george bush paid two hundred and forty four thousand dollars to armstrong
[56:17.920 --> 56:22.960]  williams illegally as a black radio host to go around i'd
[56:22.960 --> 56:28.080]  been on armstrong williams show by the way to go around saying he supported no
[56:28.080 --> 56:30.480]  child left behind the federalization of
[56:30.480 --> 56:35.200]  education where the cps come in and visit the kids and
[56:35.200 --> 56:41.840]  literally run the schools it's the uh preschools it's amazing
[56:41.840 --> 56:45.440]  that way they get your kids before they're five and go to kindergarten
[56:45.440 --> 56:48.400]  so they had him come out and say oh it's conservative i'm a black commentator
[56:48.400 --> 56:51.440]  and i because the conservatives were criticizing bush on no child left
[56:51.440 --> 56:53.920]  behind so went and hired all these fake conservatives
[56:53.920 --> 56:59.200]  that was one reporter now they've had to release in congress some of the other
[56:59.200 --> 57:03.280]  people like general tommy frank's months after
[57:03.280 --> 57:08.240]  retiring he's paid 500 plus thousand dollars
[57:08.240 --> 57:12.720]  was the exact number five hundred and fifty four thousand dollars
[57:12.720 --> 57:16.160]  to go around giving scores of speeches on tv calling
[57:16.160 --> 57:20.960]  for martial law in america going all shucks i don't like it but it's the only
[57:20.960 --> 57:25.040]  thing he was safe to get rid of the constitution and set up
[57:25.040 --> 57:28.080]  martial law
[57:32.320 --> 57:35.760]  this is how they roll this is how they operate this is
[57:35.760 --> 57:40.320]  this is how they get their jobs done
[57:41.280 --> 57:48.000]  and this is the new world order and i spend most of my time trying to fund
[57:48.000 --> 57:53.440]  the operation that you see here
[57:54.640 --> 57:58.960]  instead of spending the time making films
[57:59.120 --> 58:01.520]  and getting the word out on the radio show and that's fine we've been
[58:01.520 --> 58:05.280]  effective we've done the best job we can i just want to do more i want to take on

[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:45.840]  sam laber is our guest for the next hour hero story for info wars.com
[1:00:45.840 --> 1:00:49.680]  in prison planet.com that will go over coming up in the next
[1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:53.120]  segment i'm also going to play a clip of him
[1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:57.440]  before one of the governments there in canada
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:01.040]  confronting the establishment bringing up the fact that most
[1:01:01.040 --> 1:01:04.480]  terrorism is government sponsored and pointing out that a very suspicious
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:08.480]  company in and around the 7-7 bombings in
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:13.600]  london was there taking over some of the subway
[1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:17.280]  systems in canada so that's coming up but the reason he's on
[1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:23.120]  today with us is elitist confab or meeting in montreal
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:27.120]  adapting to a new world order now that's the name of the conference they have
[1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:32.800]  subconferences called global governance governance means government
[1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:37.120]  and they always play these childlike semantic games of the public they go
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:40.240]  we don't want global government we want global governance
[1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:44.000]  which means the exact same thing the system of government is governance
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:47.520]  so global system of government
[1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:52.240]  and they have these private meetings that next
[1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:55.760]  assume with the governmental security prosperity partnership meeting
[1:01:55.760 --> 1:01:59.760]  when people last year tried to protest the north american union
[1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:03.680]  meeting in secret the police came out dressed up like an arcus attacked other
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:07.200]  police on camera so the police could then attack peaceful demonstrators
[1:02:07.200 --> 1:02:11.680]  but smart camera people followed the cops when they staged the arrest of them
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:15.280]  posing as an arcus and showed them taking the stuff off and
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:18.080]  the police had to admit later the royal amount of police that they had staged
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:21.520]  attacks on their own officers as a pretext to attack the citizenry
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:25.280]  that's because the royal mounted police are now an alien group to canada
[1:02:25.280 --> 1:02:28.240]  they work for offshore banks they're banning free speech in canada
[1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:32.160]  destroying liberty they've arrested me when i go to canada
[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:39.280]  canada is an outrageous police state with a velvet glove on the steel fist
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:42.320]  and so we are joined by sam laber
[1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:46.560]  and we appreciate you coming on sam tell us specifically where you hail from

[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:13.040]  which was uh you know quite the kind of eye-opener when you saw that so of
[1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:16.640]  course we have to cover it to find out as much as we could about it
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:20.800]  and it turns out it's the top line of a builder bar group meeting
[1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:26.800]  yeah i am at world bank uh i mean you name it
[1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:32.640]  and right now um i actually i don't know what picture you have up on that
[1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:36.720]  present plan tv if it's the one that i sent you of me in front of the uh the
[1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:39.680]  line of police yes that's what i said yesterday
[1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:44.160]  um but actually today is uh it's really raining hard here in montreal
[1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:48.640]  and um there is there is no one here including the police so i was actually
[1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:52.640]  able to walk right in i'm actually inside um the hotel
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:57.440]  that's the way for more than meeting is taking place
[1:03:57.440 --> 1:04:00.880]  amazing we're going to break down what's happening at this meeting and
[1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:04.320]  how it affects mexicans canadians and people in the united states
[1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:08.320]  because this group is mentioned in the spp documents that judicial watch and
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:12.960]  others sued and got two years ago we have in my film in game
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:15.840]  and they're openly admitting it's north american union that they're taking
[1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:19.520]  city county state rights away so we're not just losing
[1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:24.160]  states rights in canada or the u.s it's now being totally transferred
[1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:29.200]  outside the nation to the supernational boards just like our trade is ruled
[1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:32.560]  not by our own governments but by the world trade organization
[1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:36.800]  right now the world trade organization all kinds of extra governmental agency

[1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:55.280]  as they openly push world government stay with us and and i see so many
[1:04:55.280 --> 1:04:57.920]  comments online saying they don't know what bill de berger's talking about they
[1:04:57.920 --> 1:05:00.720]  don't know they want world government what do you mean it's all admitted

[1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:14.480]  for someone and your boss tells you how much he
[1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:17.280]  appreciates you every day there is no job security
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:20.320]  you are always in danger of losing your job unless

[1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:09.440]  myself dot com my question is for mr dofin yes
[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:15.520]  i'm here tonight to address mr dofan's involvement in the signing of the
[1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:23.200]  contract in 2004 with the variant who is providing the security cameras and the
[1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:27.360]  installation in our metro a few months ago there was a
[1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:31.120]  group of my colleagues who came to this chamber to ask mr dofan about
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:34.880]  this subject which he feigned ignorance about
[1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:38.400]  so he had no idea what we were talking about what contract we're talking about
[1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:42.480]  what company we're talking about even though we have him in press releases
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:47.520]  this uh describing the wonders uh that variant security systems will bring
[1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:53.040]  too much y'all so i'm not here tonight to ask mr dofan
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:59.600]  why he has given this company which has extensive ties to cia mosaad and mi6
[1:08:59.600 --> 1:09:02.960]  this contract to our city because it is quite apparently does not want to
[1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:06.320]  answer that question i'm only here tonight to express my
[1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:09.920]  concern as a citizen and as someone who takes the metro every day
[1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:13.520]  to inform all of you that there are many of us in the city
[1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:19.840]  who know the truth about what happened on september 11th what happened in london
[1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:23.760]  on 7 7 and that you had better make sure that nothing
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:28.640]  happens to our city because if an attack happens in the metro
[1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:32.560]  and you try and blame it on al-qaeda or iran or whatever you
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:36.800]  is going to they're going to try and blame it on we will not believe you
[1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:40.000]  and that is that is the only reason i came here tonight
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:43.280]  thank you very much for your time
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:49.440]  we have the occasion i think it was
[1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:52.880]  last year or two years ago to answer
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:55.840]  some questions like the one we're having tonight
[1:09:55.840 --> 1:10:00.160]  my colleague talked to the president of the mtc montreal alternative
[1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:05.520]  cooperation had the opportunity to answer these questions
[1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:08.960]  what i remember about this question is that we
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:13.840]  had been in public tender in 2004 and it's a company
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:18.800]  that won the public tender so i'm not aware personally mr speaker
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:22.880]  exactly which company got it which other company didn't get it
[1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:26.720]  but i know that all the rules were uh follows
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:32.000]  and uh we had been in public tender and uh there was a selection committee
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.880]  with a jury and it's the best company in my knowledge
[1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:40.240]  that got the contract but otherwise i have no
[1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:44.800]  memory about exactly what happened if it wasn't a good company or the best
[1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:47.680]  company i know that we had been in public tender
[1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:49.680]  in the company
[1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:53.680]  you have another short question no i would just like to clarify that i am
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:56.800]  not accusing anyone here of complicity in any sort of
[1:10:56.800 --> 1:11:01.600]  conspiracy or or what have you i simply want to make known that there are
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:05.280]  thousands of citizens in montreal that if there's an attack
[1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:08.560]  that we will we will not believe the stories that you give us that's all i
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:13.280]  wanted to say thank you very much
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:18.320]  all right that's sam labrera joining us from 9 11 montreal truth
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:20.800]  and they've confronted members of the parliament they've confronted the
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:24.640]  former prime ministers they've confronted the city councils
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:29.280]  bringing this up and you have to understand with 7 7
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:32.400]  we know the government carried out the attacks and i've made the film terror
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:38.480]  storm detailing that that's even more clear cut
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:42.080]  than 9 11 which is also very easily proven
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:46.400]  but with 7 7 we have a lot of specifics that's why they've quietly had to turn
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:49.840]  loose all the people they claim were involved in supporting the plot they
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:53.200]  were really just government agents people that were being recruited into
[1:11:53.200 --> 1:11:57.520]  intelligence asked to take part in the drill and then they blew them up
[1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:01.360]  on board the trains and buses that's why visor consultancy
[1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:04.880]  for the government in the metro was running a drill
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:08.880]  of the exact same bus and exact same trains subways
[1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:12.080]  being bombed at the exact same time and date in london
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:17.920]  impossible same thing on 9 11 they had the exact same drills exact same time
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:22.320]  usa today associated press same buildings being attacked
[1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:25.520]  that way of good people in government that are compartmentalized and aren't
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:28.240]  part of the small group carrying out the attack
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:31.520]  that way if the bad guys get caught by the good guys they can say oh we that
[1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:34.480]  was just part of a drill
[1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:38.560]  they'll even come out and admit they were doing these drills
[1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:41.520]  a lot of times just to throw at everybody's face and say well we admit we
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:46.480]  were doing the drill how unusual but the fact that
[1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:50.320]  the gentleman we have on the line with us went down there
[1:12:50.320 --> 1:12:53.520]  and confronted them
[1:12:53.920 --> 1:13:01.040]  sam labir the fact that he did that preempts what they're doing because i
[1:13:01.040 --> 1:13:04.720]  remember at the time being on air they were already saying in montreal news we
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:07.920]  think al qaeda is going to hit the subway
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:11.840]  we're pretty sure we're gonna have a 7 7 here and then they had that
[1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:14.800]  stage capture of people that were planning it and all the rest of it turned
[1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:17.280]  out that was fake just like a thing two weeks ago
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:21.200]  with the black guys in new york and new jersey who had no intention of bombing
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:25.040]  anything the fbi created the group tried to get them to carry out terror they
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:31.200]  weren't even muslims just like miami in 96 same story
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:35.040]  sam i well we can ask him now saw this threat
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:38.000]  went down and preemptively said don't try that here
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:41.040]  uh... i mean is that what you did is that why you want to head went down
[1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:45.600]  and talk to him sir well um before we get into that i didn't i see a few days
[1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:49.760]  ago on the website that there was an explosion in uh... north carolina
[1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:55.680]  that they blamed on a drill but you know it could be the same thing right
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:59.360]  absolutely there was a in fact that's up on info wars dot com today i haven't
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:03.120]  even covered that uh... where they staged a terror attack
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:07.360]  and then just said it was a drill was that an operation where the police got
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:10.640]  caught and then a huge explosion areas but destroyed
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:13.600]  is just turned into no big deal in fact i'm going to print that right now go
[1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:16.160]  ahead tell folks about that
[1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:19.680]  well i know is uh... what i found your website but i mean it was extremely
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:22.480]  suspicious it reminded me of course of uh...
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:26.080]  i don't know seven seven of the fact that you run these drills that covered
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:28.160]  her in case something goes wrong they can fail
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:32.640]  it was a drill nevermind don't worry about it
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:34.800]  it's amazing
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:38.240]  let's speak about government sponsored terrorism first in montreal nine eleven
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:39.880]  truth and and more of
[1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:43.440]  how are you guys are going out and and and bringing up these key issues and how
[1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:45.400]  preemptively talking about
[1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:48.160]  how they may be planning a stage terror can preempt
[1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:51.760]  their activities in a devastating fashion you also see how serious
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:54.360]  the government was uh... taking what you were
[1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:56.320]  what you were just now saying
[1:14:56.320 --> 1:14:59.600]  uh... let's go ahead and to go through that and then into the
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:02.800]  public bill derberg group event happening as they take over your
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:05.280]  government openly announcing world government
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:06.680]  uh... in canada
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:08.080]  yeah well uh...
[1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:12.600]  i have to say that actually uh... i wouldn't even have been aware of uh...
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:13.680]  the company
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:17.880]  being given the contract for the uh... for the security cameras in our subway if
[1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:22.480]  it weren't for the work of uh... other members of montreal nine eleven
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:24.680]  came along first and did the research
[1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:26.160]  and found out about it
[1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:30.800]  and uh... when i when i found out i mean it just didn't have to think that
[1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:32.000]  this company
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.480]  had been given the the right to work
[1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:38.000]  to the uh... security cameras in the london underground right before seven
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:38.720]  seven
[1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:41.960]  which i mean we all remember of course with the same camera that you know
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:43.160]  didn't work
[1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:44.520]  that day on that
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:45.840]  seven seven
[1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:46.720]  uh...
[1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:50.720]  it has uh... it's a company that don't buy a former mothod
[1:15:50.720 --> 1:15:52.520]  uh... official
[1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:53.520]  uh...
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:57.000]  he's now uh... fighting extradition from i think it's
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:01.280]  like liberia or or from uh... african country that doesn't have extradition
[1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:02.280]  treaties
[1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:03.360]  uh... because he's
[1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:06.320]  he's been brought up on on product that is a good guy
[1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:07.640]  to the people work
[1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:11.600]  and uh... and he gave his company the uh... the contract
[1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:14.320]  for uh... for our subway system here in montreal
[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:18.000]  after it didn't function in uh... in the uh...
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:20.600]  the land involvement of seven seven i mean come on
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:22.600]  so uh... when i heard that
[1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:26.040]  i had to go down and
[1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:30.520]  videotape my confrontation with the city hall and put it up on youtube so that
[1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:32.200]  if there was ever
[1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:35.120]  uh... something that would happen in montreal we could at least point to that
[1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:38.440]  in the path of paper you know some people were warning about this
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:42.520]  uh... before it happened
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:45.940]  well absolutely and
[1:16:45.940 --> 1:16:49.600]  it's important to add here
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:52.640]  it came out in the news on the day of seven seven
[1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:55.160]  that benjamin yet in yahoo
[1:16:55.160 --> 1:16:56.880]  was warned
[1:16:56.880 --> 1:17:00.320]  by the head of the massage and he is a press conference
[1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:03.040]  and he was in seven seven that day just a few hundred yards away from the first
[1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:04.600]  train bombing
[1:17:04.600 --> 1:17:06.480]  to quote not
[1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:08.280]  take the subway
[1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:11.240]  uh... because of dangers in the subway that day
[1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:15.160]  and then even though that was in her ret since you're using post and a p and
[1:17:15.160 --> 1:17:18.480]  uh... was all over the news then they came out the news and denied it and said
[1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:20.520]  it was all a conspiracy theory
[1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:23.920]  and then a week later they had a massage came out again and said no
[1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:26.400]  we did warn him we knew this was going to happen
[1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:30.600]  all yeah i mean it's like uh... what's made peter power and that's visor
[1:17:30.600 --> 1:17:34.800]  consultants just happened to be running drill at the same locations at the same
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:38.320]  time on the same day and i think well that's just
[1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:40.360]  anybody who's got a little common sense
[1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:41.400]  though that
[1:17:41.400 --> 1:17:45.520]  because you're just trying to put it back
[1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:48.320]  with anybody with with the model of common sense
[1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:51.840]  it's going to be these are very important questions like how could be
[1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:55.840]  how it is scheduled at the same subway stations on seven seven at the same time
[1:17:55.840 --> 1:17:58.200]  on the same day
[1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:01.640]  that's not a good idea that's a common sense
[1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:05.160]  well it certainly is uh... you've been out on the ground the last few days this

[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:38.240]  we're going to have a tyrannical authoritarian
[1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:40.400]  is the term authoritarian
[1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:45.200]  world government and we built it in secret because you wouldn't want we know
[1:25:45.200 --> 1:25:46.900]  what's best for you
[1:25:46.900 --> 1:25:50.080]  and it's gonna save you from the economic collapse which they engineered
[1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:53.800]  doesn't mention that and a new carbon tax to regulating control every fast in
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:55.240]  your life
[1:25:55.240 --> 1:25:57.000]  so it doesn't matter when they're in
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.480]  hundreds of mainstream news articles i've seen we probably put fifteen
[1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:03.800]  time magazine newsweek financial times of london
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:07.200]  articles with them saying it blowing up the tax
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:09.240]  with at the end of a young
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:13.000]  the head of the builder bird group saying it
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:13.720]  and
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:16.080]  what do i get i get to be called a cook
[1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:20.280]  because i know they're taking over our society
[1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:25.000]  now is this guy an operative or is he just a wannabe uh... probably a wannabe
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:26.720]  thinks he's part of the system
[1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:28.400]  thinks he has personal power
[1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:33.840]  thinks by accepting the power elite and making excuses that he's part of it
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:37.120]  conscious unconsciously climbing the ladder
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:40.000]  a lot of people are like that they'll do anything to climb the ladder even the
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:41.360]  ladder leads them
[1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:46.680]  downward into hell
[1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:49.680]  like this guy says it seems like some of you posting have no idea about alex
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:50.920]  jones and what he said
[1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:52.760]  predicted some of you are awake
[1:26:52.760 --> 1:26:55.160]  but the guy with the picture of him that's the writer
[1:26:55.160 --> 1:26:59.320]  is some douchebag corporate uniform you need to wake up and realize that that
[1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:00.880]  material
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:02.780]  stuff you love means nothing
[1:27:02.780 --> 1:27:04.560]  to bettering you as a person
[1:27:04.560 --> 1:27:06.040]  it goes on
[1:27:06.040 --> 1:27:09.520]  and then the uh... writer goes on from the fact should have highlighted i just
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:10.760]  printed it
[1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:15.800]  he goes on to say uh...
[1:27:15.800 --> 1:27:18.880]  he goes on to say that uh...
[1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:22.120]  all i know it looks suspicious all find it during the break i don't want to make
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:23.800]  our guests at their own home on
[1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:26.560]  babbling on this he goes on to show the double thing
[1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:28.120]  that that that we're making up
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:29.920]  you know they're having this builder bird group
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:33.520]  subconference steering group meeting in canada they had they said they're
[1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:35.120]  setting up a north american union
[1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:37.120]  and and a global governance
[1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:43.840]  publicly with their own press releases and this guy says nope that exist
[1:27:43.840 --> 1:27:46.560]  sir continue sam continue
[1:27:46.560 --> 1:27:51.720]  alec don't get uh... secured by the other may say that the people call you mean
[1:27:51.720 --> 1:27:54.440]  they're only doing that because you're actually having an effect
[1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:56.240]  and they're actually
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:27:58.360]  though i don't ever know that samson
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:00.560]  sam lembrer you know i know that
[1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:03.600]  but the issue is i don't think this guy i think this guy really thinks we're
[1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:06.200]  making up the builder bird once north american union
[1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:09.360]  i don't think he's read the spp declassified documents
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:12.640]  i think he's so delusional he wouldn't look at him if you try to show him
[1:28:12.640 --> 1:28:16.440]  because he thinks he controls reality if he just denies this is happening
[1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:19.440]  that supposedly doesn't go ahead
[1:28:19.440 --> 1:28:23.440]  well they'll always be there with but that would be great
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:28.280]  you know what they run things they're the minions that the establishment uses
[1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:31.280]  to keep this fraud going to go ahead
[1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:35.440]  well that's why they're so afraid of the internet media now right
[1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:37.680]  because we're taking over
[1:28:37.680 --> 1:28:38.320]  quite a bit
[1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:41.360]  their credibility is really damaged
[1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:44.880]  uh... anyways i think before the break uh...
[1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:48.200]  yes tomorrow there's a big uh... luncheon
[1:28:48.200 --> 1:28:52.600]  headed by madeline albright with the title the america that the world order

[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:14.000]  I fell into a burning fire
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:16.400]  is our guess when it's from over all canada
[1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:17.840]  up there at a
[1:33:17.840 --> 1:33:18.760]  establishment
[1:33:18.760 --> 1:33:20.040]  global government meeting
[1:33:20.040 --> 1:33:23.120]  kind of a builder bird group steering meeting for this really are
[1:33:23.120 --> 1:33:26.280]  when you read the s p p documents hundreds and hundreds of pages i've
[1:33:26.280 --> 1:33:27.680]  read them all
[1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:30.440]  and then we got screenshots of the key parts and put it
[1:33:30.440 --> 1:33:33.880]  in uh... in game blueprint for global enslavement now released almost two years
[1:33:33.880 --> 1:33:35.880]  ago
[1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:39.120]  that films more important now than then because so much of what we talked about
[1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:40.400]  is now happened
[1:33:40.400 --> 1:33:43.240]  about the banks are going to blow things by design a lot more
[1:33:43.240 --> 1:33:45.920]  because i'm reading their documents and they say in there
[1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:48.320]  we're going to use economic crises
[1:33:48.320 --> 1:33:50.600]  biological crises
[1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:54.560]  biological attack crises environmental crises global warming and climate
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:55.960]  change
[1:33:55.960 --> 1:33:58.080]  and we're going to use the threat of terror
[1:33:58.080 --> 1:33:59.920]  through these crises
[1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:02.600]  we will have our new world order emerge
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:04.440]  and they also talk about
[1:34:04.440 --> 1:34:07.440]  we can't let the public know
[1:34:07.440 --> 1:34:10.040]  that we're setting this up this is got to be secret
[1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:12.760]  secrecy is key that's in the first pages
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:15.800]  it's unbelievable you can read a bit judicial watch
[1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:19.560]  dot org uh... we've got the documents saved the info wars dot com prison
[1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:20.640]  planet dot com
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:24.520]  or as i say what is the endgame dot com so important people get
[1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:26.320]  that dvd
[1:34:26.320 --> 1:34:29.200]  and uh... get it out to everybody i mean that is the most important film i've
[1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:31.440]  made the obama deceptions the most viral
[1:34:31.440 --> 1:34:34.840]  the one spreading the fastest for people that don't know what's going on
[1:34:34.840 --> 1:34:38.120]  this shows on the left and right control how it's a control paradigm
[1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:41.640]  how the offshore banks operate how we never go past our own governments to
[1:34:41.640 --> 1:34:45.320]  see the outside criminal alien force that's doing this
[1:34:45.320 --> 1:34:50.440]  you know alien art system our constitutional rights
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:53.880]  that's good but then the second film you give somebody is in game blueprint
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:56.880]  for global enslavement you say now you understand what they
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:01.080]  now you understand the globalist are from their own admissions
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:04.360]  understand what their total goals are and how they operate
[1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:07.680]  uh... going back to a sam laborer
[1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:10.800]  uh... continue you were going over the conference and and what they're talking
[1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:11.280]  about it
[1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:14.200]  the role of central banks how far can they go
[1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:17.320]  and how far they've hijacked our governments completely they're sucking
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:19.960]  the entire gdp in seven months out of canada
[1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:22.920]  and out of the europe and out of the u s they're all the same line same people
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:23.960]  running it
[1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:24.920]  uh...
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:28.120]  zolik the head of the world bank big neocons openly announcing that they may
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:29.440]  have martial law
[1:35:29.440 --> 1:35:30.640]  there's gonna be rioting
[1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:34.120]  that they're taking over that the banks will need total power over everything
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:38.320]  this is world government by a private financial lead it's very simple
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:40.200]  corporations so big
[1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:42.880]  they have hostile corporate takeovers
[1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:44.120]  nation states
[1:35:44.120 --> 1:35:49.160]  and then they levy taxes through that government conduiting it to themselves
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:51.840]  and they use government regulators to shut down their competition

[1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:13.640]  we should uh... try
[1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:17.440]  at the top of the order for a final what's the stuff
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:18.400]  i think it
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:22.080]  most of the time but yes he is all american union
[1:37:22.080 --> 1:37:27.240]  uh... today in uh... in the media a lot of the uh... the big uh...
[1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:32.040]  soundbites i've been hearing from uh... dominix truck on the head of the i m f
[1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:37.560]  uh... his big soundbites from yesterday
[1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:40.240]  that doesn't exist anything in the world
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:41.800]  except uh...
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:47.840]  all financial system and therefore any sort of national uh... regulation
[1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:49.880]  uh... doesn't make any sense
[1:37:49.880 --> 1:37:53.240]  in other words what he's saying is we need a global system of financial
[1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:55.520]  regulation that the only thing that makes sense
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:57.480]  that's right you can have it
[1:37:57.480 --> 1:37:59.720]  you can have the nations running themselves
[1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:02.800]  international bodies have to do it that's already happening
[1:38:02.800 --> 1:38:06.400]  this is just the coming out of it and all there's a financial crisis we
[1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:07.640]  engineered
[1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:09.560]  on paper they admitted they did but
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:10.800]  that's never discussed
[1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:13.440]  we're not going to take full control over your life
[1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:15.200]  here's that article
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:18.520]  uh... here the obama deception movie moon battery at its finest
[1:38:18.520 --> 1:38:20.680]  and here's the author's comments
[1:38:20.680 --> 1:38:23.920]  he goes by our caddy
[1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:26.640]  you don't believe a handful of politically connected wealthy individuals
[1:38:26.640 --> 1:38:28.360]  meeting together a few times a year
[1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:33.060]  this girl to discover world domination do you discuss it
[1:38:33.060 --> 1:38:36.680]  all right you do so so he's saying to a guy's arguing with the comments that
[1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:38.000]  were like crazy
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:39.560]  then it goes on
[1:38:39.560 --> 1:38:40.800]  well they do
[1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:42.840]  they're called the builder group look it up
[1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:46.520]  they had a meeting in my hometown here in auto canada a while back it was
[1:38:46.520 --> 1:38:48.040]  reported on local news
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:50.240]  ctv i think
[1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:53.640]  i doubt you'll find any coverage of the meeting in america media
[1:38:53.640 --> 1:38:56.640]  but you can probably find on youtube the most notable attendees
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:38:59.100]  were david rockefeller queen bitters in the netherlands
[1:38:59.100 --> 1:39:01.720]  i wonder what they're talking about
[1:39:01.720 --> 1:39:02.880]  he goes on
[1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:07.080]  no one is denying her existence and it may look strange shady weird whatever
[1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:09.320]  but not knowing what they are talking about
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:12.460]  does not give us any right to insert our own projections
[1:39:12.460 --> 1:39:15.220]  problem with conspiracy theorist is
[1:39:15.220 --> 1:39:16.360]  that not knowing
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:17.480]  drives them
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:18.960]  to their own conclusions
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:22.320]  based on whether ideas notions they have brewing in their heads
[1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:27.880]  it is a dangerous and twisted approach to life problems
[1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:30.840]  you just read from their own press releases
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:34.340]  what they are behind closed doors
[1:39:34.340 --> 1:39:38.000]  discussing but their own press release global government
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.600]  central banks taking over and running things
[1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:43.800]  uh... nation states not being able to say no
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:46.880]  calling it global government calling a new world order we go
[1:39:46.880 --> 1:39:51.480]  they're announcing new world order look we suit and got the spp documents
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:54.320]  says they're taking over our freedoms in carbon tax

[1:40:00.060 --> 1:40:03.080]  i mean i'll never forget i keep going back to this two years ago ron paul's
[1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:04.720]  running for
[1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:07.280]  president he just started a year and a half ago whatever
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:10.160]  cnn and other channels saying ron paul's crazy

[1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:13.680]  door
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:16.440]  and i remember laughing at ron paul on cnn
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:18.560]  and somebody put a compilation video together of
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:21.440]  cnn fox cnbc saying he was crazy

[1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:37.880]  this is some type of psych warfare game they play
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:41.200]  like i had psychology today call me and it was like so you believe there's a
[1:40:41.200 --> 1:40:42.660]  builder group

[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:48.000]  and then the
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  psychiatrists which is kind of go
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.480]  psychologist right informer just go
[1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:54.400]  and could please continue i'd say
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:40:57.480]  no wait a minute let's not play these little high and mighty god games where
[1:40:57.480 --> 1:41:00.280]  where you just say now you think that exist in
[1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:03.960]  he could let me ask you another are they coming to get you
[1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:06.720]  see it's all about how on this paranoid meanwhile
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:09.880]  foreign banks openly of hijacked is sucking us dry
[1:41:09.880 --> 1:41:12.640]  they're openly announcing world government and and and it's like the
[1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:15.800]  general public that's committed to the lie
[1:41:15.800 --> 1:41:18.760]  for decades they said none of this existed so even as this is being
[1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:22.480]  announced it exists in his happening they can't go back and say they were
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:24.080]  conned and lied to
[1:41:24.080 --> 1:41:25.360]  they have to say
[1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:28.040]  if i have a lot of fake conservatives call me an email me and i hear on talk
[1:41:28.040 --> 1:41:31.720]  radio that wmd's were found in iraq
[1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:33.960]  that he did have nukes
[1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:36.460]  i mean it or that they didn't torture
[1:41:36.460 --> 1:41:40.080]  you know it's it's just they are more and more realizing
[1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:46.080]  sam they are the crazy people we are the normal people go ahead
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:50.280]  well i i i i could be viewed you alex and uh... think about
[1:41:50.280 --> 1:41:53.560]  i mean it's that the writer who was who admitted
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:57.040]  that that bill debergate this uh... most likely
[1:41:57.040 --> 1:41:58.960]  five six years ago
[1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:01.760]  would have even denied that bill deberg even existed
[1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:04.320]  i would have called it crazy just thinking that it exists
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:08.480]  so i mean in a way it is it is you can look at it positively we are making
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:09.440]  progress that we
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:12.920]  it has come out now nobody can deny that the bill you're right you're right
[1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:14.840]  they're losing their mind game
[1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:16.960]  and the more they say
[1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:20.560]  no judicial watch doesn't have those documents the more they say that the
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:22.560]  best-selling book for a year
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:25.560]  was the late great u.s.a. that we sell an info wars dot com by dr jurum

[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:22.800]  all
[1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:26.380]  what should the role be canned central banks go too far

[1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:35.200]  that we can have nation states dictating the global policy
[1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:39.080]  and then they have a conference called global governance continue
[1:43:39.080 --> 1:43:43.760]  right and the title is the required joint action between north america

[1:43:58.640 --> 1:44:01.680]  tell me about the security for this event
[1:44:01.680 --> 1:44:05.560]  well yesterday like i said yes it was a beautiful day and there's uh... at least
[1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:10.080]  a hundred protests outside and there's quite a long line of uh... police officers

[1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:57.720]  now i've read that at some of these meetings they allow a little bit of kept
[1:45:57.720 --> 1:45:59.080]  press or
[1:45:59.080 --> 1:46:00.520]  domesticated press
[1:46:00.520 --> 1:46:05.680]  is there any press inside the main conference or is this quasi-secret
[1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:09.800]  uh... i haven't seen any here today but like i said we had a good interview
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:11.200]  with the reporter

[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:16.320]  i actually think that the robbie out hoping he could have had it in the
[1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:18.480]  article that you posted on that
[1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:21.480]  and if you could go back to my email and

[1:46:38.520 --> 1:46:41.800]  uh... and i wonder why they didn't put the video in the article
[1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:44.760]  he might have missed it it was right at the beginning of the email i sent him
[1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:46.280]  but uh...
[1:46:46.280 --> 1:46:50.680]  uh... yeah so we actually did meet with a reporter who had been inside who was
[1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:54.200]  working for a financial and investment magazine

[1:46:57.240 --> 1:46:58.280]  discussion

[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:29.040]  a bill through a legislative corrupt process that the house and senate rules
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:30.840]  have been changed to do
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:32.560]  bills are supposed to come out of committee
[1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:34.960]  then get voted on by the full house or senate
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:36.560]  and then go into conference between them
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:37.800]  not in this case
[1:55:37.800 --> 1:55:38.880]  it went
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:42.800]  back into kirk watson's committee and on a bill passed by the house
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:44.840]  he added
[1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:48.000]  a writer where there's no more fourth or fifth amendment
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:49.080]  you can read the bill
[1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:52.400]  it states clearly cps can take any children
[1:55:52.400 --> 1:55:55.400]  not just with a warrant or with the fake judges order
[1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:58.560]  they get these fake things for every day by these child kidnapper judges
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:01.600]  if special cop you know scumbag judges all over the country it's been in the
[1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:02.120]  news
[1:56:02.120 --> 1:56:05.480]  they get kicked back some money or like to pedophile the kids
[1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:08.520]  yesterday you gave me the article i didn't cover it the day before that rob
[1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:09.560]  do gave me one
[1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:11.280]  of head of cps
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:12.880]  head of children services
[1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:14.400]  a pedophile ring
[1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:17.800]  google that i want to show folks that i mean you can't make this up
[1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:21.920]  every day these disgusting and it's always the head guys
[1:56:21.920 --> 1:56:24.320]  because that's who runs this
[1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:26.800]  most your big family court judges are pedophiles
[1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:29.200]  or they're getting cash and that's come out on cnn
[1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:31.680]  that they get millions for the kidnap kids
[1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:34.280]  to see the adoption ages are getting two hundred three hundred four hundred five
[1:56:34.280 --> 1:56:34.760]  hundred
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:38.280]  why do they put over two-thirds the kids on drugs
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:39.800]  that they grab
[1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:43.840]  because then it's a special needs child in the cash level starts going up
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:46.400]  but it's a blonde-haired blue-eyed you're talking four hundred five hundred
[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:47.520]  thousand
[1:56:47.520 --> 1:56:50.440]  that's why we've had senators on here to tell you they got bounties
[1:56:50.440 --> 1:56:51.720]  on the kids
[1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:55.560]  now senator kirk watson state senator
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:58.720]  i've been battling him since i first got on the air in nineteen ninety five
[1:56:58.720 --> 1:56:59.880]  ninety six
[1:56:59.880 --> 1:57:01.200]  former mayor of austin
[1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:03.640]  owns his own private lamb grab bank
[1:57:03.640 --> 1:57:07.320]  outside austin he rules all the farms and ranches the city stole
[1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:08.480]  he literally is like a
[1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:10.400]  just a demonic goblin
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:11.280]  he has
[1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:13.400]  introduced uh...
[1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:16.440]  sb one four four zero that
[1:57:16.440 --> 1:57:18.480]  was a good anti-cps bill
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:22.200]  then he got it and tag something on it goes the reverse now in texas
[1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:24.360]  and it's gone to rick perry's desk
[1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:26.160]  and uh...
[1:57:26.160 --> 1:57:30.040]  the period and past this they'll come out on the news and demonizing with all
[1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:31.240]  the dirt they got on him
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:34.320]  that's why they love perry was always been a builder but
[1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:35.760]  but uh...
[1:57:35.760 --> 1:57:37.880]  we put enough pressure on
[1:57:37.880 --> 1:57:40.000]  rick perry he may uh... not
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:41.720]  totally and i like the fourth amendment
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:44.880]  and the two or three years it takes for this to get the supreme court texas
[1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:47.120]  before it gets struck down they may not even do that
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:48.880]  they'll kidnap tens of thousands more
[1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:53.400]  and i mean no judge no jury they just take your kids period they're gone
[1:57:53.400 --> 1:57:55.600]  pedophile ring once and they get
[1:57:55.600 --> 1:57:57.320]  open season
[1:57:57.320 --> 1:58:00.000]  to see they got in trouble for kidnapping four hundred kids last year
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:01.760]  that's what it reports on here
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:03.880]  and so they got in trouble with the supreme court
[1:58:03.880 --> 1:58:08.880]  doing a no-do process no orders no judges order so now kirk watson

[2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:58.080]  but I should about 80% of the time I hear about a kid being boiled to death
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:04.440]  or being tortured to death or being found in a cage starved to death they
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:10.160]  admit deep in the articles that it was a cps worker or some lazy potbellied
[2:01:10.160 --> 2:01:19.800]  phd for social work who they'll warehouse five six kids put them in cages I'm not
[2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:23.400]  kidding or lock them up in rooms barely feed enough to live you'll think they're
[2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:28.280]  concentration camp victims I did service work in college some and would go in
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:33.400]  the houses and say what are these houses and you know the older or the people that
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:37.320]  knew more about the job would say oh this is a this is a foster house these
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:41.760]  are death pedophile pits basically and then they admit they're seven times I
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:45.840]  keep saying five times more likely to abuse that was the cover of news week in
[2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:50.240]  2000 about five times more likely to use children it's now seven times more
[2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:55.280]  likely I mean there's no group worse than these people and it says a former cps
[2:01:55.280 --> 2:02:01.000]  director sentenced to 10 years for child molestation judge rejects recommendation
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:05.960]  for year in jail and treatment Gary E. Anderson leaned into the podium his head
[2:02:05.960 --> 2:02:11.520]  lowered and his blue jail jumpsuit draped off his thin frame the 67 year old
[2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:16.240]  child protective services director told the court he had not he did not understand
[2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:20.480]  how he could have spent 36 years of his life defending children you didn't you
[2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:25.680]  went in there to rape them because you know you piece of trash including his
[2:02:25.680 --> 2:02:29.400]  own and now stands guilty of raping a nine-year-old girl and molesting another
[2:02:29.400 --> 2:02:35.720]  girl of the same age because you're a bucket of crap because you're a worm
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:40.480]  and because you don't just enjoy raping those children for the same reason you
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:45.360]  enjoy if you read the criminology when the psychology of why you like raping
[2:02:45.360 --> 2:02:50.280]  children it's the same thing you like when those parents are crying when you
[2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:53.960]  show up with brainwash cops serving you and they dragged that little kid out of
[2:02:53.960 --> 2:02:57.920]  you out of their hands and you realize you're gonna be raping them in just a
[2:02:57.920 --> 2:03:06.080]  few hours it's the enjoyment it's the domination it's the power so you enjoy
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:09.840]  those parents terrorizing in pain just like local family court judges and I've
[2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:12.760]  been in their courts watching them those families are crying the judge is
[2:03:12.760 --> 2:03:17.120]  literally just going I mean they're just soaking the pain in them and me I'm
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:20.520]  like that's why I can't go to these anymore because it's literally like I'm
[2:03:20.520 --> 2:03:25.320]  in hell and I'm going it's just tearing my guts out my soul out and it just the
[2:03:25.320 --> 2:03:29.000]  rage just lifts and the judge will even see it in your eyes and just look at you
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:32.920]  and it's almost like Emperor Palpatine when Darth Vader finds out he's killed
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:37.760]  his wife and and Darth Vader's having a painful moment you see Palpatine going
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:42.280]  oh well I've seen that in Judge Jean mirror ladies and gentlemen I've seen
[2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:51.720]  her oh they're taking kids and I mean literally it's just like I just want to
[2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:58.760]  her that lady I mean she is a bucket of maggot evil she is a pit demon of hell
[2:03:58.760 --> 2:04:02.760]  itself and all over the country the family court judges could get caught
[2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:07.880]  getting massive payoffs for stealing kids from the adoption agencies not to
[2:04:07.880 --> 2:04:13.200]  mention the federal bounties to do it and I've seen them just as they take a
[2:04:13.200 --> 2:04:15.600]  little kid the parents are crying we didn't do anything you have no proof
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:20.320]  and she's like she'll even I've seen her on the news before I've played the clip
[2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:24.600]  somewhere it's a CBS clip where she's sitting there season people's kids for
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:28.680]  no reason in the schools in the elementary schools when the kids late to
[2:04:28.680 --> 2:04:32.440]  class they then make them sign a form and agree that they were truant then when
[2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:35.320]  they're late again they grab them when the parents are crying you see mirror
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:41.800]  going I mean it's just like just feeding vampirically on pain and that's what he
[2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:47.560]  did right here another disgusting piece of absolute trash Gary E. Anderson and
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:51.440]  you look at me always look the same look at that weak pedophile piece of filth
[2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:55.120]  loves hurting innocent weak people loves using the police to have his way I
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:04:58.080]  bet that bailiff right there was probably helping him a month earlier grab
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:02.760]  people's kids clear that sack of demon this is Alex Jones with five good

[2:08:15.240 --> 2:08:19.400]  that just joined us I was covering the fact that every day without even
[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:26.560]  searching for the articles it must mean every hour every day I run into mainstream
[2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:31.640]  news articles where CPS directors homeland security directors are caught
[2:08:31.640 --> 2:08:37.240]  raping kids running child porn and here is this is out of the daily world
[2:08:37.240 --> 2:08:44.000]  former CPS director sent us to 10 years for child molestation and he had bleeds
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:48.040]  guilty to raping all these kids I've broken a sacred trust not only with
[2:08:48.040 --> 2:08:54.720]  these children but those who love them oh yeah he said Friday I broke their
[2:08:54.720 --> 2:09:00.040]  hearts I am sorry for what I've done Anderson pled guilty to first-degree
[2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:05.880]  child rape and first-degree molestation last year for numerous times and it goes
[2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:13.120]  on to how you rape the little girls and folks literally they will use these
[2:09:13.120 --> 2:09:17.880]  rapist against parents every time they catch a CPS worker raping kids or
[2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:23.240]  torturing them or killing them the news will say woman arrested for killing
[2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:27.080]  children or woman arrested for scalding child and then you'll say the last
[2:09:27.080 --> 2:09:31.400]  paragraph that she was a CPS worker or foster parent now am I saying there aren't
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:35.440]  some good foster parents I know there are the issue is the systems evil and it's
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:41.840]  run by pedophiles I've probably seen no exaggeration probably 300 400 mainstream
[2:09:41.840 --> 2:09:47.960]  news articles over the years of CPS directors of whole states and whole
[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:51.320]  counties and cities it was a scandal five years ago in Florida because of
[2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:54.800]  thousands of missing kids we pulled seeing up seeing in up last week showing
[2:09:54.800 --> 2:10:02.160]  it to you we're going to our next guest in a moment where they would fire one
[2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:05.240]  director for being a convicted pedophile and the next director to be a
[2:10:05.240 --> 2:10:08.960]  pedophile then the next director was a pedophile because it's a pedophile
[2:10:08.960 --> 2:10:16.400]  guild I mean when I get up here and I say it's run by pedophiles it is that's
[2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:20.680]  one side the other side is just greedy bastards that don't care use the
[2:10:20.680 --> 2:10:23.800]  pedophiles to grab the kids they get to have their way with them and they just
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:30.000]  get cold hard cash there's another small group that is mentally ill people who
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:33.360]  were abused as children who are out quote punishing the family and believe
[2:10:33.360 --> 2:10:41.120]  it's a disease that's a subgroup I'd say they're 20% the pedophiles I'd have to
[2:10:41.120 --> 2:10:45.720]  guesstimate but I'd say 40% of CPS workers and voucher parents are pedophiles
[2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:57.080]  I mean it's just unbelievable and he's getting 10 years in prison for raping
[2:10:57.080 --> 2:11:04.040]  all these kids but but what about the issue of there have been cases where
[2:11:04.040 --> 2:11:06.920]  school teachers are pedophiles they like a particular kid they call their
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:11.880]  pedophile buddies and CPS and grab the kid and then rape them for themselves I
[2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:15.760]  mean it's like grocery shopping at the schools for them the pedophile guilds
[2:11:15.760 --> 2:11:21.800]  are everywhere and they did this in Rome they did this many other kingdoms they
[2:11:21.800 --> 2:11:26.480]  recruit more of their people in I mean I know somebody in the office next to me
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:30.520]  that worked for the city of San Marcos if I told you about what two senior
[2:11:30.520 --> 2:11:34.120]  police commanders this guy I know doesn't lie two senior police commanders
[2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:39.720]  have a sex slave at their house and nobody's gonna stop them it's gonna
[2:11:39.720 --> 2:11:44.320]  continue and they're gonna do what they want when they want and if they want
[2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:48.240]  your kids they're gonna come get them because they got armored vehicles and
[2:11:48.240 --> 2:11:53.880]  automatic weapons now if we rise up and and rebuke them for what they are and
[2:11:53.880 --> 2:11:57.560]  point out what they are they will fall
[2:11:59.320 --> 2:12:04.080]  now I have the video from in game we ought to pull this up I should have
[2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:08.560]  thought to do that where the head psychiatrist for the state of Texas tells
[2:12:08.560 --> 2:12:17.160]  the state board in the legislature that why are 68% of kids on psychotropic in
[2:12:17.160 --> 2:12:22.880]  Texas and the guy said because they're they got bad genes eugenics that's
[2:12:22.880 --> 2:12:28.320]  their excuse now due process isn't being followed with these family courts and
[2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:30.520]  tomorrow there's a press conference coming up we're gonna have somebody on
[2:12:30.520 --> 2:12:37.960]  dealing with it call Governor Rick Perry to veto SB 1440 it ends completely the
[2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:41.480]  fourth and fifth amendment allows the police to take your children like their
[2:12:41.480 --> 2:12:45.880]  al-Qaeda you know we're just grabbing al-Qaeda in America and secretly grabbing
[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:49.720]  them oh no now it's your kids in Texas and other states have introduced similar
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:54.760]  bills this bill was even improperly changed after the house passed it by
[2:12:54.760 --> 2:12:59.160]  Kirk Watson the demonic senator literally demonic pure evil flows from this
[2:12:59.160 --> 2:13:04.680]  guy and battling him for 14 years now a state senator was the mayor and it goes
[2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:10.200]  directly to him call Governor Perry's office and tell him not to vote on child
[2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:13.720]  kidnapping and not to vote for the end of the fourth amendment where they can
[2:13:13.720 --> 2:13:17.720]  take your children no judge no jury not even a fake order they just take your
[2:13:17.720 --> 2:13:25.320]  kids and then folks they take them and they rape them they rape babies they
[2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:27.880]  don't care and a lot of one of their favorite things is to do is to grab your
[2:13:27.880 --> 2:13:35.320]  kid and rape them and then say you did it but you imprisoned for it I'm not
[2:13:35.320 --> 2:13:41.920]  joking pedophiles are running most your major governments okay in fact I ought to
[2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:45.200]  do a whole program on the hundreds and hundreds of cases of Homeland Security
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:49.600]  officials caught doing that Google Homeland Security official caught with
[2:13:49.600 --> 2:13:54.360]  child porn or head of State Children's Bureau New Jersey caught raping children
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:13:58.880]  I mean I see that's what I saw in the last week all right I'm gonna shut up I'm
[2:13:58.880 --> 2:14:04.640]  gonna shut up right there because I got a guest on and I apologize you've got to
[2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:08.440]  hear this type of stuff but it all integrates into the same situation evil
[2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:12.560]  is taken over and set up a system where evil is good and good as evil and where
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:16.440]  they can carry out all their evil and then make us the good people bad and
[2:14:16.440 --> 2:14:22.040]  legitimize all their crap now are they you are you gonna let them Abu Ghraib
[2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:25.400]  your children and your kids just disappear and then I'll even tell you
[2:14:25.400 --> 2:14:30.440]  where they went no judge no jury no order so so that rapist can have their
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:34.560]  way with your children there is no group more dangerous than a truancy officer or
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:43.640]  a CPS worker or a foster parent period do you understand that most of the time
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:49.040]  when I hear about somebody arrested for pedophilia it's a CPS director see the
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:53.480]  cops aren't bad folks they're not pedophiles on average they're just like
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:56.400]  the general public you have the same sample right with them in the studies
[2:14:56.400 --> 2:15:00.640]  they know the CPS is pedophiles that's why they're constantly busting them
[2:15:00.640 --> 2:15:08.040]  doing it I'm not saying something here the police don't know it is a fact and I
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:10.920]  am sick of it
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:16.080]  you know I'll be at the mall ever once more in a grocery store and I'll see
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:22.680]  some like fat demonic creature going looking at me and I'll go that's a CPS
[2:15:22.680 --> 2:15:25.240]  worker that hates my guts and that's a pedophile right there and they'll just
[2:15:25.240 --> 2:15:29.320]  like see me go and then one time I was in the target parking lot and saw the
[2:15:29.320 --> 2:15:32.560]  little gremlin getting in his car he didn't see me we I guess had left her at
[2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:36.360]  the same time and it said safe children in the names of these different grips on
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:39.720]  the back as he was driving off and I was like it just hit me like a dremel
[2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:43.880]  whoa whoa it is one oh my god god I've got discernment please well you know it's
[2:15:43.880 --> 2:15:47.840]  just so crazy just like oh there's one of the demons right there you know my
[2:15:47.840 --> 2:15:54.040]  instinct is just to yeah you know clean house folks but I mean literally then I
[2:15:54.040 --> 2:15:58.080]  got behind him in the car because I saw him inside 30 minutes before leaving
[2:15:58.080 --> 2:16:03.440]  see him see him there he doesn't see me read his read his license his bumper
[2:16:03.440 --> 2:16:07.040]  stickers and then literally just you know hey you don't want to hit you and I
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:11.520]  was oh it's a demon it actually is one I mean there he is he's gonna go on he's
[2:16:11.520 --> 2:16:15.480]  probably going to grab a kid right then he's probably just can't wait to rape
[2:16:15.480 --> 2:16:20.440]  a six month old baby he's gonna blame the parents for it they'll grab your kid
[2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:23.920]  they go rape it that night in the examination and then they come and
[2:16:23.920 --> 2:16:28.360]  blame you for it I have had it with you and I swear one thing on the eternal
[2:16:28.360 --> 2:16:33.400]  altar of God we're gonna bring you to justice no matter what it takes filth I

[2:16:38.880 --> 2:16:42.800]  stuff I've seen I can't handle these people no one nobody's stopping them
[2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:53.760]  they just go on and on and on and on and on committing their evil and if I see
[2:16:53.760 --> 2:16:59.640]  one more potbellied stick armed ball-headed pedophile CPS worker I don't
[2:16:59.640 --> 2:17:06.720]  think I can handle it they're bullies they like hurting children and I hate
[2:17:06.720 --> 2:17:14.520]  your guts that's the problem is I get older I can't stand seeing things be

[2:18:01.240 --> 2:18:04.560]  usually get that heated I just they're trying to pass a bill where they can
[2:18:04.560 --> 2:18:10.600]  kidnap anybody's kids without any due process. Well yes that's not good and
[2:18:10.600 --> 2:18:15.040]  and that's bad enough with supposed Al-Qaeda but now our little kids right

[2:18:44.480 --> 2:18:47.960]  right there in the media article see these aren't personal stories these
[2:18:47.960 --> 2:18:53.120]  stories that appeared in newspapers and some journal articles around the country
[2:18:53.120 --> 2:19:01.600]  and we believe that in fact Japan just recently passed a warning their FDA
[2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:05.040]  their privilege of our FDA which is called the Health Ministry over there
[2:19:05.040 --> 2:19:09.800]  that they do believe that there's a causal relationship between these
[2:19:09.800 --> 2:19:15.840]  anti-depressants and violence. Kind of like causal like water is wet and rice is
[2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:20.520]  white and the sky is blue. We're about to go to break and come back and I'm

[2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:19.360]  host of issues okay man this is a short segment long segment coming up get
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:24.600]  rolling with these stories 3000 plus you've got categorized there I mean I
[2:25:24.600 --> 2:25:29.080]  mean everybody knows it's common sense that you know that most the mass shooters
[2:25:29.080 --> 2:25:33.760]  almost all of them women killing their kids they're always on prozac trite
[2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:37.640]  drugs let's go through some of those stories and why the science shows and
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:42.200]  why they don't have to admit that it causes these types of behaviors well
[2:25:42.200 --> 2:25:45.920]  first of all I want to say that it is taking these drugs do not under any
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:50.360]  circumstances withdraw from them abruptly in fact on our website cover
[2:25:50.360 --> 2:25:54.280]  page it says withdrawal can offer be more dangerous than continuing on the
[2:25:54.280 --> 2:25:59.760]  medication it's important to withdraw extremely slowly from these drugs usually
[2:25:59.760 --> 2:26:04.120]  over a period of a year or more under supervision of somebody who's qualified
[2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:11.680]  and understand what what is happening when you withdraw okay hello oh yes go
[2:26:11.680 --> 2:26:17.480]  ahead oh I wanted to explain about that withdrawal and how dangerous you can go
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:24.120]  into withdrawal mania and commit suicide or violence if you're in fact the last
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:27.560]  school shooting we had the University of Northern Illinois he was in a three-week
[2:26:27.560 --> 2:26:32.920]  withdrawal from prozac for those that don't know it creates a chemical
[2:26:32.920 --> 2:26:36.440]  imbalance you have to go off very very slowly and a lot of the mass shootings
[2:26:36.440 --> 2:26:41.640]  are when psychiatrists or psychologists change the medication or when the person
[2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:45.200]  gets locked up in jail they don't give it to them then they release them three
[2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:48.960]  days later completely out of their minds go ahead yes that's going into jail
[2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:53.200]  being on antidepressants and then going off them in jail and then being released
[2:26:53.200 --> 2:26:57.440]  so that's so dangerous so dangerous the convicts are more dangerous than they
[2:26:57.440 --> 2:27:01.960]  you know who used to be I mean you know it's just really tragic but what I was
[2:27:01.960 --> 2:27:06.520]  going to say was that the times that it's most dangerous for this violence and
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:11.400]  criminal activity and suicides to take place is when you are beginning the
[2:27:11.400 --> 2:27:17.280]  drugs or when you're stopping the drugs when you're increasing the dose or
[2:27:17.280 --> 2:27:21.760]  decreasing the dose or when you're switching from one antidepressant to
[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:27.720]  another antidepressant those are the really dangerous times and we went ahead
[2:27:27.720 --> 2:27:33.760]  and decided that we were going to let as many people as possible know about the
[2:27:33.760 --> 2:27:41.160]  dangers of these drugs and so we put up SSRIStories.com and since the
[2:27:41.160 --> 2:27:46.480]  Japanese have warned about the warnings on how dangerous these
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:50.360]  drugs are and that there's a cause of relationship I think that people should
[2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:56.200]  know that between 30 to 50 million people in the United States because actually
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:28:01.760]  six percent I mean one out of six people has tried these drugs at one time or
[2:28:01.760 --> 2:28:06.680]  another and currently one out of ten people is taking one of these antidepressants
[2:28:06.680 --> 2:28:11.640]  and these drugs right there the physician's desk reference that says that
[2:28:11.640 --> 2:28:17.440]  they can cause mania and psychosis so we have 30 to 40 million people taking a
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:21.880]  drug that could potentially cause mania and psychosis and in the physician's
[2:28:21.880 --> 2:28:30.120]  desk reference this is not even listed as a rare reaction. Are you familiar with
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:35.640]  the studies that have been done in Europe? Yes. Clearly showing that it causes
[2:28:35.640 --> 2:28:38.360]  people to have these psychotic breaks and can even cause people to have
[2:28:38.360 --> 2:28:43.400]  hallucinations because these drugs are in the serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:50.080]  psychotrobics are in the hallucinogen class? Yes they are. In fact 200,000
[2:28:50.080 --> 2:28:54.360]  people a year or more will go into a hospital with an antidepressant induced
[2:28:54.360 --> 2:29:02.040]  psychosis. That's right up there in SSRIStories it's a journal article. You
[2:29:02.040 --> 2:29:08.760]  know and so these these drugs can cause hallucinations and that's one of the
[2:29:08.760 --> 2:29:12.120]  things that's listed. Let me go through the adverse reactions that's listed here.
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:17.560]  Manic reaction that's different kinds of mania including kleptomania, pyromania
[2:29:17.560 --> 2:29:22.920]  that's arson, dyspomania it has there's alcohol cravings there that it causes
[2:29:22.920 --> 2:29:30.480]  abnormal thinking and hallucinations, personality disorders, amnesia, emotional
[2:29:30.480 --> 2:29:37.080]  instability. It can cause alcohol abuse and a craving for alcohol. It can cause
[2:29:37.080 --> 2:29:42.960]  possibility antidepressants especially the SSRIs can cause paranoid reactions. Stay
[2:29:42.960 --> 2:29:46.960]  there Betty Henderson the government admits this the FDA admits this but they
[2:29:46.960 --> 2:29:53.160]  want to put basically all the school kids on it. We're on the march the
[2:29:53.160 --> 2:30:02.520]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Many human illnesses can
[2:30:02.520 --> 2:30:06.280]  be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides
[2:30:06.280 --> 2:30:09.840]  plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[2:30:09.840 --> 2:30:14.080]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in
[2:30:14.080 --> 2:30:18.760]  basic minerals. Deficiency in any one or more important minerals actually
[2:30:18.760 --> 2:30:23.840]  results in disease. Go to americansuperfoods.com today and see the

[2:32:05.120 --> 2:32:09.040]  generator this summer. Number one new climate legislation could easily double
[2:32:09.040 --> 2:32:13.280]  or triple your electric bill. Number two our new energy czar wants to control how
[2:32:13.280 --> 2:32:17.480]  much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true total government
[2:32:17.480 --> 2:32:21.440]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number
[2:32:21.440 --> 2:32:25.360]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:32:25.360 --> 2:32:29.000]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four the hurricane
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:32.360]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year thousands of
[2:32:32.360 --> 2:32:36.560]  families lose their power from weather related outages. Number five a solar power
[2:32:36.560 --> 2:32:40.080]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks I
[2:32:40.080 --> 2:32:43.200]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from

[2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:46.960]  Okay Betty Hemerson SSR on stories.com. So you put together the
[2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:52.320]  the side of the 3,000 cases of people on psychotrophics killing themselves, killing others, and doing
[2:33:52.320 --> 2:33:58.960]  insane things, they admit in the desk reference for these drugs that it causes all the things
[2:33:58.960 --> 2:33:59.960]  you were mentioning.
[2:33:59.960 --> 2:34:03.960]  You had gotten up to paranoid delusional.
[2:34:03.960 --> 2:34:04.960]  Please continue.
[2:34:04.960 --> 2:34:10.960]  Oh, well, these are just some of the physicians desk reference, you know, lists the adverse
[2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:17.160]  reactions. And if you look at it, and you'll see, like, for instance, in Prozac, confusion
[2:34:17.160 --> 2:34:25.720]  is a frequent side effect. And so is amnesia. And so is agitation. And so are sleep disorders.
[2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:30.480]  Sleep disorders include terrible nightmares. Some people have terrible nightmares. And then
[2:34:30.480 --> 2:34:36.040]  since the drugs suppress the REM sleep and release your muscles so that you can act,
[2:34:36.040 --> 2:34:39.960]  some people act out their nightmares. They get up in the middle of the night and then
[2:34:39.960 --> 2:34:43.400]  do something violent or, you know, unprovoked.
[2:34:43.400 --> 2:34:45.680]  No, sleepwalking, violent sleepwalking.
[2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:53.680]  Yes. Yes. And that's under sleep disorder. Then also in the insert to the drugs, these
[2:34:53.680 --> 2:35:00.720]  Prozac packs all the off drugs. It says it can cause delusions. It can cause abnormal
[2:35:00.720 --> 2:35:07.320]  dreams and it can cause inner restlessness. And then, of course, it can cause the discontinuation
[2:35:07.320 --> 2:35:12.720]  of syndrome, which is actually, of course, withdrawal. That's their quite word for it.
[2:35:12.720 --> 2:35:19.040]  And agitation and all kinds of terrible things can happen to people when they get caught
[2:35:19.040 --> 2:35:24.840]  up in this cycle of these drugs. And sometimes they can't get off of them. And it's dangerous
[2:35:24.840 --> 2:35:32.320]  to get off of them. And so it's just really a national tragedy. And we have 3,109 cases
[2:35:32.320 --> 2:35:37.360]  that have appeared in the newspaper articles where it mentions these drugs. And they've
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:42.680]  done terrible things. I mean, when you go into the cover page of SSRI stories, if you
[2:35:42.680 --> 2:35:48.200]  click further and go into the media articles, you'll notice at the very top, there's the
[2:35:48.200 --> 2:35:53.120]  48 school shootings or incident school incidences, including, of course, Columbine and Red Lake
[2:35:53.120 --> 2:35:56.040]  and University of Northern Illinois and so forth.
[2:35:56.040 --> 2:36:03.480]  And underneath that scroll down, there's 17 cases where a person committed a criminal
[2:36:03.480 --> 2:36:10.120]  act while they were on an SSRI antidepressant. And these cases were won because the jury
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:19.920]  actually believed that the SSRI caught or, you know, was responsible, totally or partially.
[2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:23.880]  Yeah, there have been women kill their children, women kill their husbands, husbands kill their
[2:36:23.880 --> 2:36:29.080]  children. There was a case, for example, of a Paula Pinkard in Louisiana. She, she shot
[2:36:29.080 --> 2:36:33.880]  to death her 11 year old daughter. She was a housewife and she loved her daughter dearly
[2:36:33.880 --> 2:36:39.200]  and she shot her to death. And she was given probation because the doctors testified that
[2:36:39.200 --> 2:36:44.320]  the pro fact that she was taking caused her to kill her daughter in the sense that it
[2:36:44.320 --> 2:36:50.800]  is a tricky part that she was really a latent bipolar person. They don't want to say that
[2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:56.200]  the drug did it, but they said, Oh, well, she had bipolar disorder, but nobody knew
[2:36:56.200 --> 2:36:57.200]  about it.
[2:36:57.200 --> 2:36:58.200]  Yeah, let me break this down.
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:37:02.400]  Even testify, let me tell you, this was important, that she probably never would have killed
[2:37:02.400 --> 2:37:06.640]  her daughter if she hadn't taken post that because her latent bipolar disorder would
[2:37:06.640 --> 2:37:11.960]  never have come forward. So we have a, what do they say that we have thousands of names
[2:37:11.960 --> 2:37:17.280]  of people in the country who are running around with some kind of latent mental illness, but
[2:37:17.280 --> 2:37:19.680]  if they take one of these drugs, they're going to act it out.
[2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:24.040]  Yeah, that's like saying, if somebody takes LSD sometimes, they may jump out of a 10 story
[2:37:24.040 --> 2:37:30.320]  window, but they, you know, that they latently had suicidal tendencies. No, it was the drug
[2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:33.200]  whacked them out of their brain. Now, I'm going to throw out some key points here.
[2:37:33.200 --> 2:37:34.200]  Yeah.
[2:37:34.200 --> 2:37:39.840]  They can say that yes, the illegal drug caused them to jump out the window, but these legal
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:43.720]  drugs, no, they don't want to say that they want to say instead, Oh, well, that person
[2:37:43.720 --> 2:37:48.120]  was suicidal and we just didn't know it. It was the disease or else they say, Oh, well,
[2:37:48.120 --> 2:37:52.880]  that person really had a mental illness like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or obsessive
[2:37:52.880 --> 2:37:56.400]  compulsive disorder or something. And the drug that brought that out.
[2:37:56.400 --> 2:38:00.920]  Well, let me, let me break this down. This is all quackery. Have you ever seen the video
[2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:06.320]  clip from two years ago on the Texas legislature where the head psychiatrist for the state
[2:38:06.320 --> 2:38:16.360]  advisor before the, uh, legislative board, he is, he is saying that we put 68% of Texas
[2:38:16.360 --> 2:38:21.800]  foster children on psychotropic because they have bad gene pools. Now that now, even if
[2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:27.320]  you believe eugenics, there was no genetic test to say we put 68% of the kids on these
[2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:32.600]  drugs because they have bad gene pools or that even those drugs are meant to treat bad
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:39.880]  gene pools. It was a total quack statement as an excuse, you know, demonizing and, and
[2:38:39.880 --> 2:38:44.000]  making subhuman the foster children, but expanding on that, as I'm sure you know about the new
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:49.400]  freedom initiative that in 2006, one of the board members in Ohio released the secret
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:54.160]  federal documents that it was a drug company plan. We already knew this, but then it was
[2:38:54.160 --> 2:38:59.120]  well, we got their internal documents to put half, they said to go from 20% of kids on
[2:38:59.120 --> 2:39:06.440]  these drugs to 50% by 2013. And they've already gone up a few percentage points. So this is
[2:39:06.440 --> 2:39:11.800]  a marketing thing, but it's even better. It makes them mentally ill, makes them crazy
[2:39:11.800 --> 2:39:18.400]  as a, you know, what house rat, right? And then they get to expand as society goes more
[2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:21.880]  and more insane. And as people stab their children to death and murder their neighbors
[2:39:21.880 --> 2:39:26.220]  with guns, dress up like Santa Claus, go to a house and burn people down, you know, dress
[2:39:26.220 --> 2:39:30.320]  up and Hitler outfits and go to Columbine and shoot everybody. As this happens, they
[2:39:30.320 --> 2:39:35.520]  then get to take over our lives, then the psycho, just in psychiatry, start forcing
[2:39:35.520 --> 2:39:40.120]  everyone to go through psychological testing. They then force you to get treatment, force
[2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:44.680]  you to say you're mentally ill, then you lose rights, then more people go on drugs, then
[2:39:44.680 --> 2:39:50.160]  there's more killing, problem reaction solution. They are cold, bloodedly at the top. The
[2:39:50.160 --> 2:39:55.880]  low levels don't know this. Engineering this, they know exactly what they're doing. Can
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:39:56.880]  you comment on that?
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:40:00.280]  Well, what I want to say is with the foster children, I believe that they're putting
[2:40:00.280 --> 2:40:06.120]  them on anti-depressants and anti-psychotics and mentalize the teens to control behavior,
[2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:10.280]  you know, because the foster parents don't want to deal with anything.
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:13.120]  Now they want zombies that will sit in the cages and not ask for food.
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:14.120]  Right.
[2:40:14.120 --> 2:40:18.600]  Because the foster parents only want to take that money and drive the sports car and go
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:23.680]  to Las Vegas, literally. The kids literally live in little prison facilities and eat maybe
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:28.960]  one hot dog or two a day and a bologna sandwich and a glass of water, and you're right. They
[2:40:28.960 --> 2:40:32.880]  give them anti-psychotics, so they literally drool in the corner.
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:38.880]  Right. A sad thing, too, about the anti-depressants is that after you go on an anti-depressant
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:43.400]  and go insane, instead of taking you off of the anti-depressant during a cold and explaining
[2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:48.520]  to you that you need to exercise and have omega-3 oils and take care of yourself and
[2:40:48.520 --> 2:40:53.600]  get social support and get out in the sunshine and do some activities instead of, you know,
[2:40:53.600 --> 2:40:54.600]  sitting at home worrying.
[2:40:54.600 --> 2:40:55.600]  Yes.
[2:40:55.600 --> 2:40:59.840]  Instead of doing that, no, they tell you that, oh, you need an anti-psychotic or you need
[2:40:59.840 --> 2:41:05.360]  a mood stabilizer. So then they make you into a real mental patient.
[2:41:05.360 --> 2:41:12.600]  And one of the journal articles we have on SSRI stories in the index is that between 1995
[2:41:12.600 --> 2:41:20.240]  and 2004, there were 4.8 million additional bipolar people diagnosed. And that was since
[2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:26.120]  2005, so there's probably at least, I would guess, 10 million people now who've been diagnosed
[2:41:26.120 --> 2:41:31.880]  as bipolar, probably, and the majority of them started on anti-depressants.
[2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:35.840]  And bipolar means you're up and down, which is exactly what the drugs do. But I have a
[2:41:35.840 --> 2:41:40.920]  dog who's up and down. You know, they say children that are excited and running around
[2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:46.440]  the classroom are mentally ill. All mammal species, baby whales, baby dolphins, baby
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:56.240]  monkeys, baby apes, baby deer, fawns, cults, baby horses, they all jump and kick and they're
[2:41:56.240 --> 2:42:02.120]  supposed to build their muscles. They're diagnosing normal behavior as mentally ill because they
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:03.640]  just want to sell drugs.
[2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:09.320]  Right. Yes, I agree with that. And another thing is with the children, they do need
[2:42:09.320 --> 2:42:12.640]  their recess time. They need plenty of play activity.
[2:42:12.640 --> 2:42:17.160]  Have you heard their banning recess? Running and jumping and dodgeball and skipping is
[2:42:17.160 --> 2:42:23.200]  now banned? Why? They say it's aggressive and can lead to fights. And so hugging, shaking
[2:42:23.200 --> 2:42:29.000]  hands, high-fiving, or touching is now outlawed. In fact, people don't believe me. Google dodgeball
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:36.680]  banned, tag banned, shaking hands banned in schools. I want people to see that. CNN, AP
[2:42:36.680 --> 2:42:44.080]  senators, on screen, literally training us to be prisoners. This is a psychological dictatorship.
[2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:47.840]  Have you read the white papers put out by the eugenicist 80 years ago about how they
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:48.840]  were going to set this up?
[2:42:48.840 --> 2:42:53.560]  Well, no, I haven't really, but I do know that something terrible is happening because
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:59.640]  they did a study out of Duke University that showed that exercise for a year, in fact,
[2:42:59.640 --> 2:43:07.120]  this war was better for you than Zoloft. It was more effective. And so they replicated
[2:43:07.120 --> 2:43:12.880]  that study at Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. And it was true that people
[2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:18.840]  who exercised three or walked 30, 35 minutes a day, three to four times a week did better
[2:43:18.840 --> 2:43:20.360]  than those people in Zoloft.
[2:43:20.360 --> 2:43:24.160]  Ma'am, I got to stop you. That's exactly what I was about to bring up next. It's great
[2:43:24.160 --> 2:43:28.520]  to talk to somebody who's informed. There are older studies in Russia, China, the United
[2:43:28.520 --> 2:43:32.200]  States, England, but you're right. They had one just a few years ago here in Texas, done
[2:43:32.200 --> 2:43:38.920]  by a major medical center, that if somebody will just walk or play golf or start gardening,
[2:43:38.920 --> 2:43:44.480]  just getting outside, there's all these studies you're meant to do manual labor. You're meant
[2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:49.680]  to walk a few miles. I mean, I mean, for years, I got so busy, I just quit exercise.
[2:43:49.680 --> 2:43:54.200]  You know that soil is actually an antidepressant?
[2:43:54.200 --> 2:43:55.200]  Say that again.
[2:43:55.200 --> 2:43:59.840]  Soil, dirt, soil is actually an antidepressant. When you go out to garden, don't wear gloves,
[2:43:59.840 --> 2:44:02.880]  get your hands in the soil, because that's the natural antidepressant.
[2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:04.200]  No, I didn't know that.
[2:44:04.200 --> 2:44:06.200]  And so it's sunshine. Yes, sunshine is also an antidepressant.
[2:44:06.200 --> 2:44:10.200]  No, I knew sunshine was. I knew sunshine through the eyes and the skin, but for those that
[2:44:10.200 --> 2:44:14.240]  don't know, there's thousands of studies, scientific fact. That's why in Scandinavian
[2:44:14.240 --> 2:44:18.080]  places where it's dark, they have the real bright walls and artificial sunlight indoors
[2:44:18.080 --> 2:44:23.080]  because they have the highest suicide rates. That's now been reversed. So yes, it's, well,
[2:44:23.080 --> 2:44:27.000]  the eye stalks, as you know, grow when you're an embryo out of the brain. So the eyes really
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:30.920]  are the brain. It's the gateway to the soul, as they say. And so they need to have that
[2:44:30.920 --> 2:44:36.840]  sunlight. They're designed to do that for hormone levels inside to trigger the different
[2:44:36.840 --> 2:44:43.040]  endocrine levels to trigger the different endorphins for your sex drive, for weight loss, everything.
[2:44:43.040 --> 2:44:47.480]  The key is sunlight, but also the skin does it, not just the vitamin A it produces. Go
[2:44:47.480 --> 2:44:48.480]  ahead.
[2:44:48.480 --> 2:44:53.840]  Also, to socially interact with people more, really, really stress and depression, as long
[2:44:53.840 --> 2:44:58.200]  as you know you're interacting, especially if you're outside engaging in activities,
[2:44:58.200 --> 2:45:00.600]  like you mentioned golf, regarding with somebody or just.
[2:45:00.600 --> 2:45:04.640]  You're supposed to sit on your front porch and barbecue and laugh and joke about the
[2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:08.720]  neighbor and, you know, laugh and joke about yourself. You're meant to go out and work
[2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:13.480]  in the fields all day. That's when you're happy. You're not happy watching TV. Right.
[2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:16.720]  And you're not happy sitting on your butt and you're certainly not going to be happy
[2:45:16.720 --> 2:45:19.440]  popping prozac in the fluorine family.
[2:45:19.440 --> 2:45:24.640]  That's true. And also, make it free fatty acids that are good for people who are depressed
[2:45:24.640 --> 2:45:25.640]  or stressed.
[2:45:25.640 --> 2:45:30.920]  And notice how they say, don't get sun. Don't eat fatty acids. All these things they know
[2:45:30.920 --> 2:45:35.680]  are essential for us. They tell us not to have them.
[2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:42.200]  Well, I would have people Google omega three and find out how they can help these people
[2:45:42.200 --> 2:45:46.040]  who claim that they're feeling depressed or down. Of course, everybody has times when
[2:45:46.040 --> 2:45:51.960]  they're stressed and depressed and some people's lives have more sadness than others. But to
[2:45:51.960 --> 2:45:58.120]  do all these things, to engage in exercise and to engage in social contact, to get outside
[2:45:58.120 --> 2:46:05.240]  in the sun, to dig in the soil, to combat all this sitting around thinking about how
[2:46:05.240 --> 2:46:10.840]  terrible things are, you know, because depression involves a lot of people thinking in negative
[2:46:10.840 --> 2:46:16.400]  so they have to get out and think positive. I agree with you, but there's also a kind
[2:46:16.400 --> 2:46:21.000]  of a wild card in that. If it's not, if you're not just being negative, but fighting corruption.
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  Oh, that's different. That engages you. You need to be engaged in something worthwhile
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:31.360]  and meaningful. Like you're engaged in this fighting corruption and SSRI stories and engaged
[2:46:31.360 --> 2:46:36.000]  in fighting for people who might possibly kill somebody or kill themselves on these
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:37.880]  drugs. That helps, too.
[2:46:37.880 --> 2:46:39.400]  That gives you a lot of energy, doesn't it?
[2:46:39.400 --> 2:46:40.840]  Yes, it certainly does.
[2:46:40.840 --> 2:46:43.120]  It's a very deep fount of energy. Go ahead.
[2:46:43.120 --> 2:46:49.360]  Uh-huh. So anyway, we were going back again to the index of SSRI stories, and then there
[2:46:49.360 --> 2:46:54.480]  were 17-1 cases as you're scrolling down past all the school shootings. Then you come to
[2:46:54.480 --> 2:47:01.360]  about 58 journal articles that will tell you some of the odd things about Prozac, Paxil,
[2:47:01.360 --> 2:47:08.280]  Zolox, Alexa, Luvox, and so on, these SSRIs that you don't really know about. And so there's
[2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:13.680]  about 58 journal articles. And then as you scroll further, there's 55 highly publicized
[2:47:13.680 --> 2:47:19.480]  cases of people who were on these amnesia presence and did something very strange. For instance,
[2:47:19.480 --> 2:47:25.480]  O.J. Simpson, you know, was on a double dose of Prozac during the time of the murder. Did
[2:47:25.480 --> 2:47:26.480]  you know that?
[2:47:26.480 --> 2:47:27.480]  Yes.
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:29.280]  Oh, you did know that, okay?
[2:47:29.280 --> 2:47:30.280]  Uh-huh.
[2:47:30.280 --> 2:47:34.000]  That comedian, Phil Hartman's wife, you know, shot by his wife. She was on Zolox.
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:39.040]  No, they always are. Oh, yeah. There's so many of them that it's just, you know, video
[2:47:39.040 --> 2:47:40.040]  on.
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:42.880]  I don't think I've ever seen a high-profile mass shooting or one of these where they're
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:43.880]  not on it.
[2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:44.880]  Well, yes.
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:48.360]  I mean, very rare. I don't, I can't remember one where it wasn't.
[2:47:48.360 --> 2:47:52.000]  Well, that's why I put the school shootings up at the top of the page, because they are
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:56.120]  something new. We really didn't have these school shootings until Prozac was introduced
[2:47:56.120 --> 2:48:03.800]  in 1988. The very first school shooting involves an anti-depressant, Lori Dan, in Chicago,
[2:48:03.800 --> 2:48:08.800]  Chicago. She went into a third-grade classroom and shot seven students. One died, and six
[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:15.760]  were seriously injured. She was on the anti-depressant in Napa Nail, which is similar to an SSRI,
[2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:21.040]  even though it's a tricyclic anti-depressant. It has, it's much more powerful, and it was
[2:48:21.040 --> 2:48:28.600]  the first anti-depressant to be granted approval for obsessive-compulsive disorders, OCD, which
[2:48:28.600 --> 2:48:35.120]  a lot of these anti-depressants are now the SSRIs. She committed that first school shooting
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:40.640]  in 1989. Of course, she did have some problems, too, but here's the thing. If you're having
[2:48:40.640 --> 2:48:46.240]  some problems, why exacerbate it by giving you a drug that causes many encyclopathy?
[2:48:46.240 --> 2:48:54.040]  No, you're right. This just adds fuel. For anybody out there who, here's the next big
[2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:58.400]  issue I want to bring up to you, as I'm sure you know, they're now in all the women's magazines
[2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:03.360]  because I read them in my wife's magazines, going, you're not supposed to have a period.
[2:49:03.360 --> 2:49:10.480]  That's abnormal. A woman's cycle's not right. You need to go on this SSRI for that. Every
[2:49:10.480 --> 2:49:14.680]  time anybody I know in my family or neighbors who has a car wreck and breaks a leg, they
[2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:21.160]  come in and push a flu shot and putting them on some Prozac drugs for their, quote, depression.
[2:49:21.160 --> 2:49:24.320]  Right. I mean, they're pushing it on stubbed toes
[2:49:24.320 --> 2:49:30.560]  now, and they also mail Prozac free out in samples in the mail. I'm sure you've seen
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:35.760]  that. Yeah. I mean, these are nothing but LSD pushers. Right. Just pushing it. There
[2:49:35.760 --> 2:49:42.560]  was a terrible case in Dallas of a award-winning school teacher, Lisa Wiesneth, who was on
[2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:48.640]  Phylloxa for PMS. And she set her house in fire and murdered her two sons. She's in prison.
[2:49:48.640 --> 2:49:53.640]  Now she tried to kill herself, too. I mean, this is an example. There she was, an award-winning
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:50:00.160]  school teacher, loved children, loved teaching, loved working with them. There's so many
[2:50:00.160 --> 2:50:04.720]  of these cases. There's so many in Texas that it is unbelievable.
[2:50:04.720 --> 2:50:08.320]  But they're, well, every time I hear about a woman chopping toddler's arms off or driving
[2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:12.200]  them into the water, they're on it. I mean, in every, you know, that woman that drowned
[2:50:12.200 --> 2:50:16.440]  her kids in Houston, she was on it. Yeah. Andrea Yates. She was on a sex bird. Yeah.
[2:50:16.440 --> 2:50:21.320]  She was on two-handed presence, a sex bird and Ramaran. And she became psychotic on them.
[2:50:21.320 --> 2:50:28.480]  Yes. It was terrible. Really. See, the thing about a sex bird, too, is in the physician's
[2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:34.360]  desk reference now, it says that one of the adverse reactions to a sex bird is homicidal
[2:50:34.360 --> 2:50:42.400]  ideation. So where do you think Andrea Yates received these ideas? No, it makes you homicidal.
[2:50:42.400 --> 2:50:48.400]  Because it makes you homicidal. Yes. Ideation means homicidal ideas. But, I mean, you can't
[2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:53.120]  have ideas sometimes you asked on them, you know? Listen, look, look, I've read the police
[2:50:53.120 --> 2:50:56.880]  reports. They'll pull up at a house and the guy's cutting his fingers off and he's on
[2:50:56.880 --> 2:51:01.640]  the stuff. I mean, it's just... Yeah, it is bad. Stay there. Stay there. Got a break.

[2:52:01.440 --> 2:52:05.600]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here. I'm sitting out a special alert to all those out there listening

[3:00:26.520 --> 3:00:31.840]  Wayne Madsen comes up, that I have had countless neurologists, brain surgeons, psychologists,
[3:00:31.840 --> 3:00:38.200]  psychiatrists, medical doctors on, going back over a decade, breaking all this down.
[3:00:38.200 --> 3:00:40.760]  And we forced it now onto the drug labels.
[3:00:40.760 --> 3:00:42.840]  We forced it into the media.
[3:00:42.840 --> 3:00:44.080]  And now it's common knowledge.
[3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:49.240]  But 10 years ago, I get laughed at, oh, yeah, Prozac made the people do the shooting.
[3:00:49.240 --> 3:00:51.320]  Sure they did.
[3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:53.460]  So let's continue.
[3:00:53.460 --> 3:00:57.160]  Because under the new Freedom Initiative, you never really commented on that.
[3:00:57.160 --> 3:01:00.200]  You are aware of the new Freedom Initiative where they want to put half the kids on drugs?
[3:01:00.200 --> 3:01:01.760]  Well, yes, I am aware too.
[3:01:01.760 --> 3:01:06.480]  And of the Mother's Act where they want to put mothers who are pregnant and having children
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:07.480]  and so forth.
[3:01:07.480 --> 3:01:12.800]  They want to diagnose them and see if they have, you know, have depression and so forth.
[3:01:12.800 --> 3:01:14.360]  Are you aware of the Mother's Act?
[3:01:14.360 --> 3:01:15.360]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:01:15.360 --> 3:01:20.160]  When a woman goes into habit, have the child, they're already doing it here in Austin.
[3:01:20.160 --> 3:01:23.080]  They have a computer on the wall and it's hooked into the health department.
[3:01:23.080 --> 3:01:26.120]  And they ask, do you have money?
[3:01:26.120 --> 3:01:27.600]  Is your husband nice to you?
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:29.480]  Do you have triple pan your bills?
[3:01:29.480 --> 3:01:31.520]  And then they can say your kid's at risk.
[3:01:31.520 --> 3:01:34.640]  The mother wonders why the CPS is there trying to take the kid.
[3:01:34.640 --> 3:01:39.080]  But also, they then, yes, try to say having a baby is mental illness.
[3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:40.080]  It's not natural.
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:41.800]  Of course not.
[3:01:41.800 --> 3:01:44.320]  And that we're going to put you on these drugs.
[3:01:44.320 --> 3:01:46.040]  Yeah, tell folks about that.
[3:01:46.040 --> 3:01:52.600]  Well, on SSRI stories index, there's 46 cases of postpartum depression where the mother
[3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:58.080]  killed herself and usually the baby because she was taken an SSRI.
[3:01:58.080 --> 3:02:03.720]  I mean, they, uh, and, and so they're trying to, so they're trying to say that this was
[3:02:03.720 --> 3:02:06.720]  the postpartum depression that is instead of the drug.
[3:02:06.720 --> 3:02:08.840]  No, no, no, no, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
[3:02:08.840 --> 3:02:10.240]  This is all done on purpose.
[3:02:10.240 --> 3:02:11.240]  Exactly.
[3:02:11.240 --> 3:02:12.240]  Yeah.
[3:02:12.240 --> 3:02:13.240]  No, no, no.
[3:02:13.240 --> 3:02:17.160]  The locals implementing our compartmentalized, they don't know, but it's the same problem
[3:02:17.160 --> 3:02:19.080]  reaction solution.
[3:02:19.080 --> 3:02:23.320]  It's like when the vaccines kill babies, they turn, it came out in court, they knew they
[3:02:23.320 --> 3:02:27.600]  would just say the mother had shaken the baby when really it was an autoimmune response.
[3:02:27.600 --> 3:02:29.280]  That's why they had blood on the brain.
[3:02:29.280 --> 3:02:32.200]  And then they would go ahead and address the mom because the hospital killed them with
[3:02:32.200 --> 3:02:34.320]  a at birth vaccine.
[3:02:34.320 --> 3:02:36.200]  It expands from there.
[3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:40.040]  They know the SSRIs are making the mothers kill their kids.
[3:02:40.040 --> 3:02:42.320]  So then they say, oh, everybody's got to be on it.
[3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:43.320]  That's the problem.
[3:02:43.320 --> 3:02:44.320]  Go ahead.
[3:02:44.320 --> 3:02:45.320]  Yeah.
[3:02:45.320 --> 3:02:46.320]  That's what they say.
[3:02:46.320 --> 3:02:47.320]  You're right there.
[3:02:47.320 --> 3:02:48.320]  It's pure evil, ma'am.
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:50.120]  It's all by design.
[3:02:50.120 --> 3:02:51.120]  But I bet you're a nice person.
[3:02:51.120 --> 3:02:53.320]  I bet you don't think they're doing it by design, do you?
[3:02:53.320 --> 3:02:55.920]  I don't think what?
[3:02:55.920 --> 3:02:56.920]  You're a nice person.
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:02:59.680]  I bet you think the system isn't doing it by design.
[3:02:59.680 --> 3:03:01.800]  I don't know if they're doing it by design.
[3:03:01.800 --> 3:03:03.960]  I think they're doing it for a number of reasons.
[3:03:03.960 --> 3:03:07.880]  Well, there's greed, of course, from the pharmaceutical companies nationally.
[3:03:07.880 --> 3:03:12.240]  And then they have all their lobbyists up there in Washington, DC, paying people off.
[3:03:12.240 --> 3:03:16.480]  And then, of course, the sales representatives, they influence the doctors and there's advertising
[3:03:16.480 --> 3:03:17.480]  on TV.
[3:03:17.480 --> 3:03:23.760]  And how do you watch TV without seeing these ads for Paxil and Simbalton, Lexapro, and
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:26.400]  Alexa and all the SSRIs?
[3:03:26.400 --> 3:03:28.920]  And so I think that it's, well, I don't know.
[3:03:28.920 --> 3:03:29.920]  Do you think it's 1984?
[3:03:29.920 --> 3:03:30.920]  Yes, ma'am.
[3:03:30.920 --> 3:03:33.200]  Let me give you the document points.
[3:03:33.200 --> 3:03:36.720]  Go to WhatIsTheEndgame.com because you're a great researcher.
[3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:38.800]  That's a bibliography for my film, Endgame.
[3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:39.800]  Okay.
[3:03:39.800 --> 3:03:40.800]  Read those documents.
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:49.120]  The United Nations first solicitor general, his full title was Aldous Huxley, Director
[3:03:49.120 --> 3:03:50.640]  General UNESCO.
[3:03:50.640 --> 3:03:52.960]  They say this is the plan.
[3:03:52.960 --> 3:03:56.840]  And you can also read Bertrand Russell saying it's the plan, Nobel Prize winners.
[3:03:56.840 --> 3:03:57.960]  So yes, ma'am.
[3:03:57.960 --> 3:04:01.360]  And I know that's shocking, but it's all engineered.
[3:04:01.360 --> 3:04:02.360]  It's all by design.
[3:04:02.360 --> 3:04:03.800]  It's so cold-blooded.
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:08.200]  It dwarfs just any evil ever committed in history.
[3:04:08.200 --> 3:04:09.560]  And of course, they're guild members.
[3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:12.960]  They're low-level priests don't know, you know, they're filling the priest's role.
[3:04:12.960 --> 3:04:16.720]  Like Hitler said, his Gestapo was a priesthood, and you have the Vatican with the Jesuits
[3:04:16.720 --> 3:04:17.720]  a priesthood.
[3:04:17.720 --> 3:04:21.400]  So a priesthood is a model of kind of an inner party enforcer.
[3:04:21.400 --> 3:04:26.400]  But that's what they actually call the psychologist and psychologist is their new priesthood.
[3:04:26.400 --> 3:04:30.600]  And they give people the poisons and the death and control.
[3:04:30.600 --> 3:04:33.040]  But that is to carry out the overall eugenics.
[3:04:33.040 --> 3:04:34.040]  All right.
[3:04:34.040 --> 3:04:35.040]  I agree.
[3:04:35.040 --> 3:04:39.880]  And of course, the psychiatrist started the eugenics movement, eugenics went into Hitler
[3:04:39.880 --> 3:04:40.880]  loved eugenics.
[3:04:40.880 --> 3:04:41.880]  So.
[3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:42.880]  Yes, ma'am.
[3:04:42.880 --> 3:04:43.880]  You will find that.
[3:04:43.880 --> 3:04:44.880]  Listen, I've learned a lot from you.
[3:04:44.880 --> 3:04:47.160]  And hopefully this has been symbiotic and spreading the word.

[3:06:01.400 --> 3:06:05.960]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer
[3:06:05.960 --> 3:06:10.680]  provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[3:06:10.680 --> 3:06:16.120]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.

[3:07:40.720 --> 3:07:41.720]  worry about.
[3:07:41.720 --> 3:07:49.200]  The three-day responder $27.95, sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[3:07:49.200 --> 3:08:01.480]  Call 800-409-5633 on thewebefoodsdirect.com, that's 800-409-5633 on thewebefoodsdirect.com.
[3:08:01.480 --> 3:08:07.400]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[3:08:07.400 --> 3:08:30.360]  a war on for your mind.
[3:08:30.360 --> 3:08:34.640]  Wayne Madsen is an investigative journalist, nationally distributed columnist and author
[3:08:34.640 --> 3:08:39.000]  who has covered Washington, D.C. politics, national security and intelligence issues
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:40.000]  since 1994.
[3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:44.680]  He has written for The Village Voice, the progressive CAQ counterpunch, the intelligence
[3:08:44.680 --> 3:08:46.840]  newsletter based in Paris.
[3:08:46.840 --> 3:08:52.080]  Madsen is the author of Genocide and Covert Operations in Africa, 93-99, and co-author
[3:08:52.080 --> 3:08:58.160]  of America's Nightmare, the presidency of George Bush II, and the forthcoming Jaded
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:02.560]  Task, Big Oil, Black Ops, and Brass Plates, that's actually out now.
[3:09:02.560 --> 3:09:08.040]  Madsen is also the author of the Handbook of Personal Data Protection, McMillan, and
[3:09:08.040 --> 3:09:10.480]  acclaimed reference book on international data protection law.
[3:09:10.480 --> 3:09:15.400]  Madsen is a former U.S. Naval officer who has assigned to the national security agency
[3:09:15.400 --> 3:09:16.560]  during the Reagan administration.
[3:09:16.560 --> 3:09:22.400]  He also had 20 years experience in computer security and data privacy, has also worked
[3:09:22.400 --> 3:09:28.320]  for the Naval Data Automation Command, Department of State, RCA Corporation, and Computer Science
[3:09:28.320 --> 3:09:32.080]  Corporation, which now owns Dinecore, I would add.
[3:09:32.080 --> 3:09:37.120]  But going to Wayne Madsen for the 50 minutes we have with you, sir, I want to get into
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:40.320]  a host of issues because Wayne doesn't make stuff up.
[3:09:40.320 --> 3:09:44.520]  There's a lot of reporters and a lot of people that are alternative media that mix into
[3:09:44.520 --> 3:09:45.520]  SINFO.
[3:09:45.520 --> 3:09:49.320]  I've heard him say a lot of wild things and things that sound wild and it always turns
[3:09:49.320 --> 3:09:53.840]  out later to be true, and he helped us expose the fact clearly that E.C.
[3:09:53.840 --> 3:09:57.680]  Madsen was murdered and he did work with her interviewing her and went to dinner, whether
[3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:00.400]  or shortly before she died.
[3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:04.480]  He's broken just hundreds of major news stories, it's always great having him.
[3:10:04.480 --> 3:10:07.720]  I was talking to him, I said, I want to get into Obama's visit to the Middle East.
[3:10:07.720 --> 3:10:09.160]  Is that the capitulation?
[3:10:09.160 --> 3:10:13.880]  The West admitting their setup of the Muslim world, their takeover hasn't worked.
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:17.360]  I want to talk about the economy, the banks taking over admitting their raising interest
[3:10:17.360 --> 3:10:21.240]  rates in reality, using the hoarded money to buy up the system.
[3:10:21.240 --> 3:10:29.440]  I wanted to get into Africa, North Khan, you know, Com here in the U.S., Afrikan over there,
[3:10:29.440 --> 3:10:31.320]  now dominating, trying to take over.
[3:10:31.320 --> 3:10:36.800]  He wrote a book about that eight, nine years ago, so I want to discuss that today.
[3:10:36.800 --> 3:10:41.600]  A host of issues with him, but the first thing that I want to get into is something he mentioned,
[3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:45.960]  kind of the tail end of our little off air discussion, David Karadine.
[3:10:45.960 --> 3:10:50.680]  Now, David Karadine's father was in some weird Hollywood secret societies, and there
[3:10:50.680 --> 3:10:55.360]  aren't quite a bit of those, but Alistair Crowley, Karadine, I know some people that
[3:10:55.360 --> 3:11:00.640]  knew him, was into the New World Order, supposedly getting anti-New World Order, was working,
[3:11:00.640 --> 3:11:04.480]  and even some of his lawyers and friends said on Larry King on coming out against secret
[3:11:04.480 --> 3:11:12.200]  societies, that was on CNN, not just infowars.com, and clearly there were different stories out
[3:11:12.200 --> 3:11:16.080]  of the police and looked like he might have been murdered.
[3:11:16.080 --> 3:11:19.880]  Some family and friends that he was murdered, didn't they, the classic MO being threatened
[3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:21.920]  said, okay, he wasn't murdered.
[3:11:21.920 --> 3:11:26.560]  So Wayne Madsen out of the gates has a lot of international connections and always breaks
[3:11:26.560 --> 3:11:27.560]  news here.
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:31.200]  So Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com, tell us about Karadine first.
[3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:38.000]  Well, Alex, I spent two years ago, I went over to Bangkok to investigate the use of
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:45.080]  child prostitutes by U.S. diplomats primarily, but also visiting U.S. VIPs, including members
[3:11:45.080 --> 3:11:46.240]  of Congress.
[3:11:46.240 --> 3:11:53.080]  I got to know a lot of the people who investigate this type of assorted behavior in Bangkok,
[3:11:53.080 --> 3:12:02.040]  and what I'm getting is that there is a burgeoning, sadomasochism S&M scene in Bangkok.
[3:12:02.040 --> 3:12:09.160]  There's a number of S&M clubs that are attracting a lot of Hollywood types, American, British
[3:12:09.160 --> 3:12:17.120]  and French diplomats, as well as visiting VIPs from other countries, politicians included.
[3:12:17.120 --> 3:12:23.320]  And it's a possibility because of people I know have spoken to the Thai police that what
[3:12:23.320 --> 3:12:29.680]  sometimes happens is that one of these VIPs will be visiting one of these S&M clubs, either
[3:12:29.680 --> 3:12:36.000]  have a heart attack or OD on drugs or even drink too much booze and die from alcohol
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:37.000]  poisoning.
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:41.400]  And what they do is the clubs don't want the publicity, they're quietly removed back
[3:12:41.400 --> 3:12:42.560]  to the hotel.
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:49.320]  So one of the last things we heard from the Thai police was whether anyone else was involved
[3:12:49.320 --> 3:12:57.360]  in the Karadine situation, which could have been that he died of a heart attack from engaging
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:02.400]  in some, and what they know in England, of course, is the rough trade.
[3:13:02.400 --> 3:13:08.040]  And so there's a possibility that they're looking to see if his body was removed from
[3:13:08.040 --> 3:13:10.440]  one of these S&M clubs.
[3:13:10.440 --> 3:13:19.840]  There's three well-known Bar Bar, AZ and Demonia, and that he was placed back into his hotel
[3:13:19.840 --> 3:13:24.200]  room to make it look like he died there alone.
[3:13:24.200 --> 3:13:33.480]  Yeah, amazing, expanding on that, one of his ex-wives, but people do make things up.
[3:13:33.480 --> 3:13:38.680]  Until I got older, I didn't realize the penchant that a lot of women have for just making up
[3:13:38.680 --> 3:13:42.560]  wild stories, but it seems like more and more the culture does, but Karadine, it's from
[3:13:42.560 --> 3:13:46.680]  multiple sources, but she said in the divorce, she divorced him because he was doing dangerous
[3:13:46.680 --> 3:13:47.680]  sex acts.
[3:13:47.680 --> 3:13:55.920]  I'm always dubious about taking ex-wives, they do tend to be somewhat vindictive, but
[3:13:55.920 --> 3:14:00.800]  we had two of his ex-wives actually now saying he was into the kind of kinky stuff.
[3:14:00.800 --> 3:14:04.440]  Yeah, and what do they call it, where people choke themselves?
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:12.240]  Oh, yes, this is one of the theories was autoerotic asphyxiation, that's one of the things.
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:17.920]  I know it had a big fancy name, I mean, do you think there's anything to that?
[3:14:17.920 --> 3:14:20.560]  Because that's what they're pretty much saying, he was in there choked in the closet.
[3:14:20.560 --> 3:14:27.600]  Well, I have to say one thing, after investigating a couple of strange quote unquote, that's
[3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:35.120]  like Britain, one of the things that happens, that has happened in Britain is people have
[3:14:35.120 --> 3:14:41.400]  been found in, you know, what appears to be autoerotic asphyxiation, but it's a perfect
[3:14:41.400 --> 3:14:46.240]  type of situation, if you don't want the family asking a lot of questions, if these people
[3:14:46.240 --> 3:14:52.640]  are murdered, and it's made to look like this is the situation, the families do not want
[3:14:52.640 --> 3:14:55.320]  to go there, they do not want to, you know, get to that point.
[3:14:55.320 --> 3:14:58.480]  Exactly, over and over again, it's done to make it look embarrassing.
[3:14:58.480 --> 3:15:04.240]  And very embarrassing, and no questions asked, and the families don't want any further investigation
[3:15:04.240 --> 3:15:08.960]  case closed, as far as the police are concerned, but.
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:15.280]  I mean, in my life experience, all of a sudden I was dating this girl and she suddenly clawed
[3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:18.520]  bloody rakes in my back and said, don't you like that?
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:22.760]  And as blood running down my back, I said, no, I'm not into pain.
[3:15:22.760 --> 3:15:26.800]  And so I guess I'm kind of a weirdo, because I'm not into pain, but studying the New World
[3:15:26.800 --> 3:15:30.280]  Order and studying it throughout history, what is it about elites and people that get
[3:15:30.280 --> 3:15:37.760]  into power, that they like inflicting pain and receiving pain, what's going on here?
[3:15:37.760 --> 3:15:41.040]  I mean, because I know you've studied the elite psychology.
[3:15:41.040 --> 3:15:44.640]  Why do I keep reading, even in mainstream news, that, well, the head of Formula One
[3:15:44.640 --> 3:15:50.000]  got in trouble for it, that England is this capital of hardcore S&M.
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:51.000]  What is this?
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:58.160]  Well, I think it's a power trip for some people, you know, it's aberrant, it's deviant, but
[3:15:58.160 --> 3:16:02.840]  they know they can get away with it, because they travel in the circle that allow them
[3:16:02.840 --> 3:16:09.160]  to basically do what they want to do without any sort of pressure coming on them.
[3:16:09.160 --> 3:16:14.600]  And I would note that there are members of the British royal family that are well known
[3:16:14.600 --> 3:16:17.640]  to be into this type of thing.
[3:16:17.640 --> 3:16:26.520]  And so I think it's the power trip some of it may have to do with these various societies
[3:16:26.520 --> 3:16:30.280]  that have these weird initiation rituals.
[3:16:30.280 --> 3:16:36.080]  We certainly know there's a quite a few of those, and you look at the skull and bones
[3:16:36.080 --> 3:16:42.360]  and it's rather a deviant type of initiation ritual that goes on there, but it's not the
[3:16:42.360 --> 3:16:43.360]  only one.
[3:16:43.360 --> 3:16:45.960]  And for those that don't know, tell folks what our Christian conservative leaders predominantly,
[3:16:45.960 --> 3:16:49.080]  there's also liberals families there.
[3:16:49.080 --> 3:16:53.760]  They're being urinated on, they're masturbating in coffins, I mean, that's the MO from Pretty
[3:16:53.760 --> 3:16:58.720]  Credible Sources, Wayne Madsen, from your journalistic reports, what do you know about
[3:16:58.720 --> 3:17:00.360]  the skull and bones behavior?
[3:17:00.360 --> 3:17:06.480]  Well, basically it's what you say, the initiation, you know, there's an event called Tapping where
[3:17:06.480 --> 3:17:16.960]  they'll tap somebody to join, they go through this initiation ritual, which entails someone
[3:17:16.960 --> 3:17:26.960]  being in a coffin and all this sort of weird exchange of bodily fluids goes on.
[3:17:26.960 --> 3:17:35.960]  And yeah, I mean, I think it goes back to, you know, even more ancient secret societies
[3:17:35.960 --> 3:17:39.960]  going back hundreds and hundreds of years that has been more successful than it did.
[3:17:39.960 --> 3:17:42.640]  And that's what I'm going to say is, you know, hear about these fraternities where they
[3:17:42.640 --> 3:17:46.880]  beat people up or they have sex with animals, and it's like, oh, this is an ritual.
[3:17:46.880 --> 3:17:51.040]  The head guy just wears a hood and candles and does this because that's what we do.
[3:17:51.040 --> 3:17:53.360]  Well, why do they do that?
[3:17:53.360 --> 3:17:57.600]  And it's really hidden in plain view that these fraternities, a lot of them, are really
[3:17:57.600 --> 3:18:05.280]  the kind of the courtyard entryway into real secret societies that, like you said on record,
[3:18:05.280 --> 3:18:10.280]  go back thousands of years because intelligence agencies of old were just called secret societies.
[3:18:10.280 --> 3:18:11.280]  Right.
[3:18:11.280 --> 3:18:15.800]  And I mean, I think, you know, a lot of people have been through various initiations.
[3:18:15.800 --> 3:18:20.360]  I was initiated into the Elk Lodge and, you know, the American Legion.
[3:18:20.360 --> 3:18:25.960]  I mean, that's a ceremony, but I think what separates them from some of these other groups
[3:18:25.960 --> 3:18:28.800]  is some of that stuff is just bizarre.
[3:18:28.800 --> 3:18:34.800]  And I don't know why anyone would want to be involved in that type of thing, but again,
[3:18:34.800 --> 3:18:37.480]  I think it's the fact that they have the goods on one another.
[3:18:37.480 --> 3:18:41.840]  They, you know, it's just sort of like wink, wink, nod, nod the situation.
[3:18:41.840 --> 3:18:48.560]  I recall in the 2004 campaign that Tim Russert, for all of his fault, he had the guts to ask
[3:18:48.560 --> 3:18:53.680]  both Kerry and Bush in interviews about the skull and bones.
[3:18:53.680 --> 3:18:58.560]  Of course, he got nothing from either one of them, but I have to hand it to him for
[3:18:58.560 --> 3:18:59.920]  at least asking you.
[3:18:59.920 --> 3:19:02.360]  Not many people tread on that ground.
[3:19:02.360 --> 3:19:05.000]  Yeah, when we come back, I'll play that clip.
[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:09.320]  Kerry said, not much because it's a secret, and he says, there's a lot of secrets, but
[3:19:09.320 --> 3:19:10.880]  I'm not going to talk about it.
[3:19:10.880 --> 3:19:15.160]  I mean, imagine two guys related on every side of their family, not just cousins, you
[3:19:15.160 --> 3:19:18.280]  know, one way, but it's like a breed of dog.
[3:19:18.280 --> 3:19:23.880]  They're both totally related to each other, and you got 10 people every year initiated
[3:19:23.880 --> 3:19:25.040]  into it.
[3:19:25.040 --> 3:19:29.900]  They were at the school during the same four or five years together, you know, different
[3:19:29.900 --> 3:19:31.400]  year classes.
[3:19:31.400 --> 3:19:36.400]  What is the chances of having those two men running against each other for President Wayne
[3:19:36.400 --> 3:19:37.400]  Madsen?
[3:19:37.400 --> 3:19:41.400]  Well, I think it's more than just coincidental.
[3:19:41.400 --> 3:19:47.520]  Yeah, in skull and bones, for those that don't know, it is a classic satanic ritual.
[3:19:47.520 --> 3:19:53.720]  The devil has you be reborn in a coffin, reborn to the host of hell.
[3:19:53.720 --> 3:19:58.880]  It is a worship of piratical enslavement of the general public.
[3:19:58.880 --> 3:20:01.760]  We'll be right back with Wayne Madsen.

[3:20:59.320 --> 3:21:02.320]  That's the idea.
[3:21:02.320 --> 3:21:09.400]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources, 800-686-2237, extension 128, and let's take in a brief
[3:21:09.400 --> 3:21:10.640]  mind movie.
[3:21:10.640 --> 3:21:15.520]  We're surrounded by gestures, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington
[3:21:15.520 --> 3:21:20.880]  D.C., fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances
[3:21:20.880 --> 3:21:22.120]  that all will be well.
[3:21:22.120 --> 3:21:24.000]  The stimulus package is working.
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:26.040]  A bailout is coming your way.
[3:21:26.040 --> 3:21:30.200]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[3:21:30.200 --> 3:21:31.440]  Pardon me?
[3:21:31.440 --> 3:21:32.600]  Back to the real world.
[3:21:32.600 --> 3:21:36.920]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[3:21:36.920 --> 3:21:39.400]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[3:21:39.400 --> 3:21:41.240]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[3:21:41.240 --> 3:21:47.240]  Please call me John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128 to discuss investing in precious
[3:21:47.240 --> 3:21:52.480]  metals, gold, and silver with a 6,000-year track record of success and security.
[3:21:52.480 --> 3:21:58.720]  I'm John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, and together we'll create a package that
[3:21:58.720 --> 3:22:02.120]  really works for you.
[3:22:02.120 --> 3:22:08.240]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:22:08.240 --> 3:22:12.720]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:22:12.720 --> 3:22:14.040]  us would like to see.
[3:22:14.040 --> 3:22:19.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:22:19.200 --> 3:22:20.600]  of the American people.
[3:22:20.600 --> 3:22:24.960]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:22:24.960 --> 3:22:30.040]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:22:30.040 --> 3:22:38.120]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:22:38.120 --> 3:22:41.720]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:22:41.720 --> 3:22:48.640]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:22:48.640 --> 3:22:54.240]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super high
[3:22:54.240 --> 3:22:56.800]  quality at PrismPlanet.tv.
[3:22:56.800 --> 3:23:03.320]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:23:03.320 --> 3:23:07.080]  If we could all see the germs that we encounter each day, we might have a different outlook
[3:23:07.080 --> 3:23:08.960]  on how we view our surroundings.
[3:23:08.960 --> 3:23:12.520]  In the past, you may not have put too much thought into it, but with the current health
[3:23:12.520 --> 3:23:15.760]  risks in the world today, it's impossible to ignore it.
[3:23:15.760 --> 3:23:18.640]  There is a solution, and it's called hazard.
[3:23:18.640 --> 3:23:24.160]  Hazard utilizes a fogging device that disinfects, sanitizes, and protects against influenza,
[3:23:24.160 --> 3:23:28.280]  viruses, bacteria, allergen, mold, and more.
[3:23:28.280 --> 3:23:31.320]  It's tough on germs, but not on children and pets.
[3:23:31.320 --> 3:23:36.280]  You'll receive the fogger, liquid concentrate, enough to make up to 32 gallons of germ-killing
[3:23:36.280 --> 3:23:41.200]  power, three respirators, goggles, protective suit, and heavy duty gloves.
[3:23:41.200 --> 3:23:45.680]  Order right now at hazard.com, and you'll receive double the order of liquid concentrate,
[3:23:45.680 --> 3:23:49.520]  or call 800-675-0323.
[3:23:49.520 --> 3:23:55.120]  That's 800-675-0323, or visit hazard.com.
[3:23:55.120 --> 3:23:58.160]  That's H-A-Z-A-R-I-D.
[3:23:58.160 --> 3:23:59.160]  Protect Prepare.
[3:23:59.160 --> 3:24:14.960]  That's your Hazard Today.
[3:24:14.960 --> 3:24:18.600]  We're going to take your calls the next segment for Wayne Madsen and WayneMadsenReport.com,
[3:24:18.600 --> 3:24:21.680]  specifically for Wayne Madsen, I would ask, but he can talk about any subject.
[3:24:21.680 --> 3:24:26.200]  He's as knowledgeable as I am, and perhaps more so on many subjects on a broad range
[3:24:26.200 --> 3:24:27.200]  of issues.
[3:24:27.200 --> 3:24:29.320]  We always love having him on with us.
[3:24:29.320 --> 3:24:34.280]  WayneMadsenReport.com is a great place to get a lot of key information.
[3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:44.200]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[3:24:44.200 --> 3:24:47.160]  Going back to Wayne Madsen and Wayne, there's so much to talk about here.
[3:24:47.160 --> 3:24:48.160]  Let's get into the economy.
[3:24:48.160 --> 3:24:52.680]  AP reported that, oh, banks are hoarding the money, and that interest rates have really
[3:24:52.680 --> 3:24:59.880]  gone up in reality, though they're at zero, supposedly, and that big banks are using the
[3:24:59.880 --> 3:25:03.920]  collapse as a way to take over internationally.
[3:25:03.920 --> 3:25:05.840]  This is really right out in the open.
[3:25:05.840 --> 3:25:09.680]  Give us your take on that and what the rumblings are on in Washington.
[3:25:09.680 --> 3:25:15.080]  They've already gotten $14.8 trillion in seven months, greater than the GDP.
[3:25:15.080 --> 3:25:20.120]  Is there any amount they won't be given, or are we going to start calling Fed Chairman
[3:25:20.120 --> 3:25:24.720]  Ed Bernacke the first, and then his son will be the prince, and then his son after him,
[3:25:24.720 --> 3:25:26.200]  like North Korea or something?
[3:25:26.200 --> 3:25:32.000]  Well, you know, for the first time, Alex, I talked to people who cover the Treasury Department
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:36.640]  and the Fed, and you know, these were not always the most interesting folks to talk
[3:25:36.640 --> 3:25:39.040]  to, because you know, they don't face it.
[3:25:39.040 --> 3:25:44.760]  The subjects they cover are rather mundane, but what I've been getting for, I guess, now
[3:25:44.760 --> 3:25:48.720]  six to eight months is they don't know what's going on.
[3:25:48.720 --> 3:25:50.720]  They talk to people who work in Treasury.
[3:25:50.720 --> 3:25:55.360]  They talk to people who work at the Fed, and they say, where's this all heading?
[3:25:55.360 --> 3:26:00.280]  And they get these, you know, people shaking their head, you know, we don't know, throwing
[3:26:00.280 --> 3:26:02.320]  up their arms.
[3:26:02.320 --> 3:26:08.160]  And I think that this whole idea that we're in this uncharted territory and nobody knows
[3:26:08.160 --> 3:26:12.200]  what's going on is, I think, the most worrisome thing.
[3:26:12.200 --> 3:26:18.840]  I always thought that, you know, this kind of high-level economics was something only,
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:20.320]  you know, a few people can understand.
[3:26:20.320 --> 3:26:24.160]  Now, now the fact is, it doesn't seem like anyone understands it.
[3:26:24.160 --> 3:26:25.160]  Well, here's the M.O.
[3:26:25.160 --> 3:26:30.200]  I get from Joseph Stiglitz, as you know, Nobel Prize winner, former World Bank chief economist,
[3:26:30.200 --> 3:26:37.440]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Wall Street Journal editor and assistant head of Treasury.
[3:26:37.440 --> 3:26:42.000]  They know what they're doing, and whether they engineered it or whether it's out of their
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:46.840]  control, they've decided to capitalize from the collapse of society, and I believe they
[3:26:46.840 --> 3:26:49.160]  engineered it, and the evidence shows that.
[3:26:49.160 --> 3:26:52.080]  And so they don't want to tell people where it's going and what's going to happen.
[3:26:52.080 --> 3:26:57.200]  It's just false hope, because they know it means total collapse, so they can consolidate,
[3:26:57.200 --> 3:26:59.120]  and that's why the banks are hoarding all their money.
[3:26:59.120 --> 3:27:03.960]  Well, I'll tell you, you know, a few weeks back, I was at the, for the first time, I
[3:27:03.960 --> 3:27:07.560]  was at this White House Correspondents' Center, and Geithner was there.
[3:27:07.560 --> 3:27:13.520]  And a friend of mine asked Geithner, he said, listen, if you keep printing up money, aren't
[3:27:13.520 --> 3:27:15.680]  you worried about hyperinflation?
[3:27:15.680 --> 3:27:21.520]  And Geithner just let loose within that, you know, this expert has deleted, he said it's
[3:27:21.520 --> 3:27:24.160]  not blank on a happen, it's not blank on a happen.
[3:27:24.160 --> 3:27:31.480]  I mean, it just, you get the impression that the people that are running the show are incompetent.
[3:27:31.480 --> 3:27:35.280]  It may be that they're, you know, cleverly incompetent because the massive ripoff is
[3:27:35.280 --> 3:27:36.280]  taking place.
[3:27:36.280 --> 3:27:41.240]  But we know what happens to countries where they just print money without any, you know,
[3:27:41.240 --> 3:27:45.200]  any other federation, certainly that's what happened in Germany.
[3:27:45.200 --> 3:27:46.200]  Exactly.
[3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:50.600]  It's, it's, it's like a Mexican standoff where everybody's aiming at everybody.
[3:27:50.600 --> 3:27:52.520]  China is totally invested with us.
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:58.280]  They know they're buying total crud, but we're also where they export all their goods.
[3:27:58.280 --> 3:28:01.760]  And so it looks like the United States can just print, print, print, but that's still
[3:28:01.760 --> 3:28:06.480]  going to hyperinflate things here and then they're hyperinflating money that we're supposed
[3:28:06.480 --> 3:28:08.320]  to pay back as taxpayers.
[3:28:08.320 --> 3:28:09.920]  Anyway, you cut it.
[3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:11.440]  This is going on a very dark road.
[3:28:11.440 --> 3:28:13.440]  How do you see it unfolding, Wayne Madsen?
[3:28:13.440 --> 3:28:16.480]  Well, I'll tell you where I see it unfolding.
[3:28:16.480 --> 3:28:20.840]  I think we have to look at what just recently happened in Europe with these European Union
[3:28:20.840 --> 3:28:23.160]  elections for the European parliament.
[3:28:23.160 --> 3:28:28.480]  You know, a lot of, a lot of the well-established parties just took, you know, really took
[3:28:28.480 --> 3:28:29.480]  it in the short.
[3:28:29.480 --> 3:28:35.160]  British, the British Labor Party and some constituencies finished behind, of course,
[3:28:35.160 --> 3:28:39.000]  the British National Fund, which is the far-right, you know, fascist party.
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:45.280]  They even, in some parts of the, uh, England, they fell behind the, the Cornwall Nationalist
[3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:50.040]  Party in Sweden, a group called the Pirate Party, won their first seat.
[3:28:50.040 --> 3:28:53.040]  They, they're, you know, they're basically, they won all software free.
[3:28:53.040 --> 3:28:58.720]  They want to download movies and, and, and, and, you know, music to the heart's content.
[3:28:58.720 --> 3:29:06.200]  And what you saw was this, like rebellious, uh, uh, inclination in Europe, uh, anti-establishment.
[3:29:06.200 --> 3:29:10.800]  And I, I really think that, uh, the Republicans and Democrats better start looking at the
[3:29:10.800 --> 3:29:14.840]  tea leaves, because what happened in Europe may happen here now.
[3:29:14.840 --> 3:29:19.160]  Will that be such a bad thing if people start to put their parties, fourth parties, maybe
[3:29:19.160 --> 3:29:22.520]  even fifth parties, into, uh, into office?
[3:29:22.520 --> 3:29:25.800]  Maybe not, but it may take something like that to shake them up.
[3:29:25.800 --> 3:29:29.880]  One answer is exactly what I'm saying, and we have these headlines about right wing
[3:29:29.880 --> 3:29:31.280]  takes over Europe.
[3:29:31.280 --> 3:29:32.280]  It's not right wing.
[3:29:32.280 --> 3:29:36.640]  People voted for anything, but the establishment parties, but the media's making it a left
[3:29:36.640 --> 3:29:37.640]  right issue.
[3:29:37.640 --> 3:29:40.160]  Obama is the establishment's last and raw.
[3:29:40.160 --> 3:29:44.280]  If he can't bring the American people and the people of the world back to the table
[3:29:44.280 --> 3:29:48.360]  to be raped by the bankers some more, they know they're going to have a real political
[3:29:48.360 --> 3:29:49.360]  revolution.
[3:29:49.360 --> 3:29:51.960]  We'll be back with Wayne Madsen to talk about that.
[3:29:51.960 --> 3:29:53.240]  We're on the march.
[3:29:53.240 --> 3:30:01.480]  The empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:01.480 --> 3:30:02.480]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:30:02.480 --> 3:30:06.320]  And I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement
[3:30:06.320 --> 3:30:07.320]  for years.
[3:30:07.320 --> 3:30:08.600]  Inner health botanicals.
[3:30:08.600 --> 3:30:12.800]  This company produces the highest quality super food around called inner food.
[3:30:12.800 --> 3:30:14.720]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[3:30:14.720 --> 3:30:19.840]  And now the health ranger, Mike Adams has awarded inner food is editor's choice award
[3:30:19.840 --> 3:30:22.200]  on best super food of 2009.
[3:30:22.200 --> 3:30:25.000]  Inner food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[3:30:25.000 --> 3:30:26.000]  No fillers.
[3:30:26.000 --> 3:30:27.000]  No sweeteners.
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:31.520]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price and their formula really works.
[3:30:31.520 --> 3:30:34.320]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[3:30:34.320 --> 3:30:39.400]  Try the Nutra Cafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the
[3:30:39.400 --> 3:30:40.400]  immune system.
[3:30:40.400 --> 3:30:42.960]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[3:30:42.960 --> 3:30:44.160]  And take it from me, folks.
[3:30:44.160 --> 3:30:45.520]  It really does taste great.
[3:30:45.520 --> 3:30:47.480]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[3:30:47.480 --> 3:31:01.520]  Go to www.enerfod.com or just click on their banner on infowars.com for special pricing.
[3:31:01.520 --> 3:31:05.960]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:31:05.960 --> 3:31:06.960]  this summer.
[3:31:06.960 --> 3:31:10.800]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:31:10.800 --> 3:31:15.400]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:31:15.400 --> 3:31:16.640]  allows you to have.
[3:31:16.640 --> 3:31:17.640]  It's true.
[3:31:17.640 --> 3:31:21.800]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:31:21.800 --> 3:31:26.400]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially
[3:31:26.400 --> 3:31:28.320]  with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:31:28.320 --> 3:31:31.880]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[3:31:31.880 --> 3:31:35.560]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[3:31:35.560 --> 3:31:40.360]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:31:40.360 --> 3:31:44.240]  Folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:31:44.240 --> 3:31:45.920]  a long time sponsor of ours.
[3:31:45.920 --> 3:31:52.360]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.

[3:32:01.640 --> 3:32:06.240]  The drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high
[3:32:06.240 --> 3:32:08.240]  energy and vibrant health.
[3:32:08.240 --> 3:32:13.120]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of eight or higher.
[3:32:13.120 --> 3:32:18.400]  Even plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[3:32:18.400 --> 3:32:22.880]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get
[3:32:22.880 --> 3:32:26.000]  rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[3:32:26.000 --> 3:32:31.600]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[3:32:31.600 --> 3:32:36.000]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[3:32:36.000 --> 3:32:37.320]  of your body.

[3:34:07.560 --> 3:34:12.640]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[3:34:12.640 --> 3:34:17.720]  First though, one of them is New Silver Solution and I really believe in this, we use this
[3:34:17.720 --> 3:34:23.000]  in my household, we've used colloidal silver for a long time but they've really, as it's
[3:34:23.000 --> 3:34:28.320]  got more popular, developed even better types of it and this is nano particulate and that's
[3:34:28.320 --> 3:34:31.760]  what makes silver so powerful, it's so small it destroys viruses and bacteria, it goes
[3:34:31.760 --> 3:34:36.760]  right through their cell walls, it was the old fashioned antibiotic and now all the modern
[3:34:36.760 --> 3:34:40.880]  ones aren't working too well or aren't working at all, it's making a big comeback and great
[3:34:40.880 --> 3:34:49.960]  brand is SupernaturalSilver.com, SupernaturalSilver.com, you've been down in the third world, take
[3:34:49.960 --> 3:34:54.840]  a few swigs of this to knock those parasites out, you've got a cold and it's bacterial,
[3:34:54.840 --> 3:34:59.400]  this stuff's great or you can use a netty pot if you've got a bacterial or viral infection
[3:34:59.400 --> 3:35:00.560]  up in your sinus.
[3:35:00.560 --> 3:35:10.720]  I've had medical doctors on who have recommended this on air, SupernaturalSilver.com, SupernaturalSilver.com

[3:36:45.760 --> 3:36:46.760]  side out.
[3:36:46.760 --> 3:36:50.560]  Okay, Wayne, I want to throw out a few quick questions to you and then get to calls.
[3:36:50.560 --> 3:36:54.040]  I've been throwing questions out, my question is, what do you think is most important right
[3:36:54.040 --> 3:36:55.040]  now?
[3:36:55.040 --> 3:37:01.240]  I want to get some into Obama, but where do you see coming up on the horizon?
[3:37:01.240 --> 3:37:03.600]  What do you see happening in Pakistan, Afghanistan?
[3:37:03.600 --> 3:37:05.200]  What do you see happening domestically?
[3:37:05.200 --> 3:37:09.560]  What do you see happening with stage terror or any other points you think are important?
[3:37:09.560 --> 3:37:17.800]  Well, I'll tell you, on the Pakistan-Afghanistan situation, it just isn't helping our cause
[3:37:17.800 --> 3:37:26.080]  much that we are using these remotely piloted drones to fire these missiles at wedding parties
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:29.120]  into people's homes.
[3:37:29.120 --> 3:37:34.480]  There are constantly demonstrations in Afghanistan and also in Pakistan, every time civilians
[3:37:34.480 --> 3:37:36.480]  are killed.
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:44.480]  So Obama could give 50 Cairo speeches and in those particular areas of the Muslim world,
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:49.080]  it's going to have very little effect because they say, oh, yeah, well, I heard the speech,
[3:37:49.080 --> 3:37:56.480]  this outreach, but the missiles are still rolling, they're still killing innocent civilians.
[3:37:56.480 --> 3:38:01.840]  I think the problem Obama has is he's got a lot of retrets from the Clinton administration.
[3:38:01.840 --> 3:38:07.800]  Richard Holbrook, he was the architect of this devastating war in the Balkans.
[3:38:07.800 --> 3:38:13.600]  Yeah, now we've got how many countries that compose the former Yugoslavia, about eight?
[3:38:13.600 --> 3:38:19.560]  I mean, so, and some of them are fighting each other and there's even indications there
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:20.560]  could be more fracturing.
[3:38:20.560 --> 3:38:26.480]  But isn't that the plan, Balkanize Pakistan, Balkanize Iraq, Balkanize Syria, Balkanize
[3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:33.560]  Saudi Arabia, Balkanize Serbia, any sovereign nation can't be allowed to build up outside
[3:38:33.560 --> 3:38:35.080]  this global corporate state?
[3:38:35.080 --> 3:38:38.920]  Well, I think there's a, you've got a good point there because look at, you know, what
[3:38:38.920 --> 3:38:45.120]  we saw after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc was that was this Balkanization
[3:38:45.120 --> 3:38:51.480]  that if Pakistan should be Balkanized, we're talking about about five or six different
[3:38:51.480 --> 3:38:56.760]  countries arising out of the former Pakistan, but only one, the Punjabi region having the
[3:38:56.760 --> 3:38:57.760]  bomb.
[3:38:57.760 --> 3:39:02.440]  So it would be not the Pakistani nuclear weapon, it would be the Punjabi nuclear weapon.
[3:39:02.440 --> 3:39:07.360]  And that's just a recipe for a disaster when you're dealing with a neighboring country,
[3:39:07.360 --> 3:39:11.000]  India, which also has a lot of restive regions.
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:16.240]  And there's going to be constant wars between those five parts until some warlord unifies
[3:39:16.240 --> 3:39:21.080]  it, perfect for the globalists to have some new region to always pump their weapons systems
[3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:22.080]  into.
[3:39:22.080 --> 3:39:23.080]  Absolutely.
[3:39:23.080 --> 3:39:27.760]  And, you know, and Holbrook, of course, is the super envoy of Hillary Clinton now over
[3:39:27.760 --> 3:39:30.280]  to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[3:39:30.280 --> 3:39:36.760]  He's also taking charge, maybe a good thing, he has taken charge of Iran, the Iran situation
[3:39:36.760 --> 3:39:42.200]  from Dennis Ross, who was very much in bed with Likud and they won a bomb, of course,
[3:39:42.200 --> 3:39:43.720]  they're back to the stone age.
[3:39:43.720 --> 3:39:48.800]  So in the case of Iran, Holbrook is actually the moderate, believe it or not.
[3:39:48.800 --> 3:39:54.880]  But it still is, these people, all these council and foreign relations, this APEC crowd, America's
[3:39:54.880 --> 3:39:59.800]  Republican Affairs Committee, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, all these
[3:39:59.800 --> 3:40:11.560]  various think tanks that basically are conducting, US foreign policy is being conducted basically
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:14.080]  as a franchise to special interest groups.
[3:40:14.080 --> 3:40:21.000]  And I think that's one of the things that Obama is going to have to face here with him
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:29.040]  getting tough recently on Israeli settlements and Israel's policy against Iran.
[3:40:29.040 --> 3:40:33.320]  He told him he doesn't want them to attack Iran and he wants them to halt the settlements.
[3:40:33.320 --> 3:40:39.640]  But Netanyahu is saying flat out no and it's resulting in probably the worst US-Israeli
[3:40:39.640 --> 3:40:46.040]  relations since the Suez invasion of 1956 when basically Eisenhower broke completely
[3:40:46.040 --> 3:40:49.280]  with the Israelis over their invasion of Egypt.
[3:40:49.280 --> 3:40:54.280]  You think that's a real break because Obama was financed in large part by the Israeli
[3:40:54.280 --> 3:40:55.280]  lobby?
[3:40:55.280 --> 3:41:02.600]  You know, and I look at Rahm Emanuel as chief of staff and others, and I have to wonder
[3:41:02.600 --> 3:41:08.120]  how far can he go with having these, I mean, Emanuel during Desert Storm was serving in
[3:41:08.120 --> 3:41:09.720]  the Israeli army.
[3:41:09.720 --> 3:41:15.400]  I mean, when all of our guys, men and women were fighting over in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
[3:41:15.400 --> 3:41:21.640]  and in Iraq, here we have Emanuel serving in another country's armed forces.
[3:41:21.640 --> 3:41:24.720]  So how much leeway does Obama have?
[3:41:24.720 --> 3:41:31.560]  You know, I wish I had my ear inside the West Wing, but I do know that Emanuel is probably
[3:41:31.560 --> 3:41:34.920]  one of the strongest chiefs of staff in recent memory.
[3:41:34.920 --> 3:41:42.560]  And in one case, he was cracking his knuckles at his cabinet meeting and Obama said, Rahm,
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:43.560]  I find that annoying.
[3:41:43.560 --> 3:41:44.560]  I wish it stopped.
[3:41:44.560 --> 3:41:48.280]  He gets up and cracks his knuckles right in Obama's ear, and everybody laughs and I think
[3:41:48.280 --> 3:41:52.680]  that was Emanuel's way to tell the visiting members of Congress and members of the cabinet,
[3:41:52.680 --> 3:41:53.800]  hey, I'm in charge here.
[3:41:53.800 --> 3:41:58.840]  Well, Wayne, I have to say that everything with Obama is betrayal.
[3:41:58.840 --> 3:42:02.400]  He'll say he's going to do the right thing and he always goes back on it later or puts
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:08.280]  it into some debate process, you know, while continuing with the older bad policy.
[3:42:08.280 --> 3:42:13.160]  So I think there's going to be a stage terror attack or something's going to happen.
[3:42:13.160 --> 3:42:18.440]  So Obama can say, well, see, I tried to fix things, but now I've got to go in there.
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:24.360]  There's no way that the IDF Mossad agent Emanuel and all that money he got from Israel, there's
[3:42:24.360 --> 3:42:27.760]  no way they're not going to continue.
[3:42:27.760 --> 3:42:31.200]  But but side issue, what are you hearing in Washington because I know you're right inside
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:36.120]  those intelligence meetings, you know, covering them and for the press.
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:39.640]  The word is, is that Israel may go in alone and attack Iran.
[3:42:39.640 --> 3:42:43.400]  Would they do that without U.S. backing or where do you see it?
[3:42:43.400 --> 3:42:48.800]  Well, I don't think they could logistically could they they'd have to fly over first
[3:42:48.800 --> 3:42:54.160]  Jordanian airspace, but then they'd have to go over a rocky airspace and we control a
[3:42:54.160 --> 3:42:55.160]  rocky airspace.
[3:42:55.160 --> 3:43:01.080]  So it would have to be done with our connivance, otherwise it'd have to fly over Saudi airspace.
[3:43:01.080 --> 3:43:06.240]  Now they could potentially get that permission because one of the little things about the
[3:43:06.240 --> 3:43:11.760]  Middle East is the Saudi Arabia, the Iranians, yeah, they're really on the same page when
[3:43:11.760 --> 3:43:17.120]  it comes to the Iranians and there has been a lot of low level intelligence cooperation
[3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:20.720]  between Saudi Arabia and Israel on Iran.
[3:43:20.720 --> 3:43:28.680]  And also with the situation with Hamas and Hezbollah and Lebanon, it's very little known,
[3:43:28.680 --> 3:43:35.160]  but it has been going on for a number of years, but certainly they may like to.
[3:43:35.160 --> 3:43:39.080]  The only way they could actually avoid the airspace and hit Iran would be to use their
[3:43:39.080 --> 3:43:44.920]  submarines, Israeli submarines, and they have at least one, if not two, in the Persian Gulf
[3:43:44.920 --> 3:43:53.000]  at any given time with nuclear-tipped cruise missiles that could get the Iranian weapons.
[3:43:53.000 --> 3:43:54.000]  That's right.
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:43:59.360]  But they can only pack a certain amount of punch with those because they're constrained
[3:43:59.360 --> 3:44:07.600]  to submarine platforms, so would they basically reap more than they would sow in a situation
[3:44:07.600 --> 3:44:08.600]  like that?
[3:44:08.600 --> 3:44:14.240]  Well, Iran could be expected to really retaliate in force, but we have Iranian presidential
[3:44:14.240 --> 3:44:18.960]  elections coming up this week, and if they're moderate wins, that's going to take a lot
[3:44:18.960 --> 3:44:24.160]  of the wind out of the sales of Netanyahu to be talking about a strike on Iran because
[3:44:24.160 --> 3:44:29.480]  everybody will be looking at sort of the rapprochement, and if Masavi wins that election, I think
[3:44:29.480 --> 3:44:33.640]  we'll have an Iranian embassy reopening in Washington in probably six months.
[3:44:33.640 --> 3:44:37.160]  Okay, I want to go to some calls here, as promised, but Wayne, I want to throw out two
[3:44:37.160 --> 3:44:38.520]  other points to you.
[3:44:38.520 --> 3:44:41.400]  I know you've got some intel on Air France.
[3:44:41.400 --> 3:44:42.640]  Was there any chicanery there?
[3:44:42.640 --> 3:44:44.200]  A lot of people have been saying that.
[3:44:44.200 --> 3:44:45.800]  There have been bomb threats in the days before.
[3:44:45.800 --> 3:44:52.560]  I want to get your take on that from your sources, but first, we remember that the CIA
[3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:57.800]  section chief over Afghanistan and Pakistan, and we interviewed him, wrote Jawbreaker
[3:44:57.800 --> 3:45:02.920]  and admitted what we already knew, that the Taliban would grab for $20,000, $25,000 bounties,
[3:45:02.920 --> 3:45:09.160]  14-year-old kids that couldn't find the U.S. on a map, sell them as al-Qaeda fighters,
[3:45:09.160 --> 3:45:12.160]  and then they would take them to Guantanamo Bay, and the government didn't care.
[3:45:12.160 --> 3:45:16.520]  They wanted just bodies to say, look, there's the terror threat to add validity to the war
[3:45:16.520 --> 3:45:18.320]  on terror.
[3:45:18.320 --> 3:45:29.560]  Now it's admitted that in Pakistan and Iraq, they pay people $150 per RFID chip, or it's
[3:45:29.560 --> 3:45:34.360]  more than RFID, little radio beacons, and that the people admit, this was in the Times
[3:45:34.360 --> 3:45:40.640]  of London and London Telegraph and in Wired magazine, that they then just go throw them
[3:45:40.640 --> 3:45:43.200]  in innocent people's houses.
[3:45:43.200 --> 3:45:46.520]  And that's some of why we see weddings and people being wiped out, because people will
[3:45:46.520 --> 3:45:51.720]  just leave these in public places and get their $150, and the Defense Department doesn't
[3:45:51.720 --> 3:45:55.840]  care, because they just want to say, oh, look, we identified all these terror targets to
[3:45:55.840 --> 3:45:57.000]  keep the mission going.
[3:45:57.000 --> 3:46:00.840]  It's kind of like fake body counts, instead of having fake body counts, we'll just go
[3:46:00.840 --> 3:46:05.720]  ahead and blow up real weddings, and they're now using dead people at weddings as a body
[3:46:05.720 --> 3:46:07.760]  count and have reintroduced the body count.
[3:46:07.760 --> 3:46:08.760]  Your comments on that.
[3:46:08.760 --> 3:46:16.880]  Well, Harkins back to what happened in Vietnam with Operation Phoenix, inflated a number
[3:46:16.880 --> 3:46:22.640]  of the Viet Cong and V8 dead, they're playing with numbers.
[3:46:22.640 --> 3:46:28.480]  I really think we need to get out of Iraq, we need to get out of Afghanistan, and stop
[3:46:28.480 --> 3:46:30.960]  this bloodletting on both sides.
[3:46:30.960 --> 3:46:37.320]  You know, General Petraeus, who I think is the biggest fraud ever served recently in
[3:46:37.320 --> 3:46:42.960]  the Pentagon, wearing a uniform, is basically still pushing a surge, and now he wants a
[3:46:42.960 --> 3:46:47.440]  surge in Afghanistan, and the surge has had dramatic consequences.
[3:46:47.440 --> 3:46:52.320]  We've had all these, you know, the media doesn't even cover back that anymore, or Iraq more
[3:46:52.320 --> 3:46:53.320]  quickly.
[3:46:53.320 --> 3:46:55.240]  That's why the deaths have gone back up now.
[3:46:55.240 --> 3:47:01.440]  Exactly, and there are, you know, three servicemen here killed in a roadside bomb, four here,
[3:47:01.440 --> 3:47:02.800]  and nobody's even covered it.
[3:47:02.800 --> 3:47:03.800]  You don't even get covered on anything.
[3:47:03.800 --> 3:47:09.720]  Because Obama's in now, now it's a new chapter, move on, and then it's almost like Iraq doesn't
[3:47:09.720 --> 3:47:10.720]  exist.
[3:47:10.720 --> 3:47:11.720]  I know that Iraq supports the war.
[3:47:11.720 --> 3:47:12.720]  That's the other thing.
[3:47:12.720 --> 3:47:18.360]  The progressive organization now is supporting Afghanistan and Iraq, the surge, and they've
[3:47:18.360 --> 3:47:21.000]  just shown themselves to be total ponies.
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:24.720]  They're not progressive, they were just in it, you know, in it for themselves.
[3:47:24.720 --> 3:47:32.560]  Another George Soros fact organization, Soros is the chief and most wealthy troublemaker
[3:47:32.560 --> 3:47:33.560]  in the world today.
[3:47:33.560 --> 3:47:34.560]  What about Soros?
[3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:36.760]  He's had all his organs attacking me lately.
[3:47:36.760 --> 3:47:37.760]  It's kind of scary.
[3:47:37.760 --> 3:47:38.760]  All those publications.
[3:47:38.760 --> 3:47:39.760]  Join the club.
[3:47:39.760 --> 3:47:40.760]  Me too.
[3:47:40.760 --> 3:47:43.760]  He's after me every day, and it comes from different, you know, he has all these fun
[3:47:43.760 --> 3:47:44.760]  organizations.
[3:47:44.760 --> 3:47:46.760]  So I'm getting it from, you know, multiple sides.
[3:47:46.760 --> 3:47:49.480]  What does that mean to have Soros attacking us?
[3:47:49.480 --> 3:47:50.960]  Well, I think it's good.
[3:47:50.960 --> 3:47:55.680]  I mean, it shows that we're not buying into his Hegelian view of the world, where he,
[3:47:55.680 --> 3:48:00.560]  he tries to create these opposition forces, and then he's going to capitalize on the chaos
[3:48:00.560 --> 3:48:01.560]  he creates.
[3:48:01.560 --> 3:48:08.440]  He's puppets in, he has these themed revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine, he calls them orange
[3:48:08.440 --> 3:48:12.480]  revolutions, tulip reservoir revolutions, and what I mean, that's my point is, why
[3:48:12.480 --> 3:48:17.160]  is he bragging at press conferences that he's behind the crisis, which he really isn't,
[3:48:17.160 --> 3:48:21.640]  but he's capitalizing and saying, I'm having a great crisis time of my life, culmination
[3:48:21.640 --> 3:48:22.640]  of my life.
[3:48:22.640 --> 3:48:27.360]  And then he's funding these eugenics movies saying carbon footprints are big.
[3:48:27.360 --> 3:48:29.480]  We got to have global taxes paid to him.
[3:48:29.480 --> 3:48:31.840]  I mean, he's all I see.
[3:48:31.840 --> 3:48:32.840]  Yeah.
[3:48:32.840 --> 3:48:39.360]  He's just a masterful, I look at him as a foreign, same as Rupert Murdoch, only, you
[3:48:39.360 --> 3:48:43.280]  know, he's more in city as how he infiltrates the media, where Murdoch doesn't care.
[3:48:43.280 --> 3:48:49.280]  He just goes and buys newspapers, where Soros basically infiltrates, or sets up his own
[3:48:49.280 --> 3:48:50.280]  front organization.
[3:48:50.280 --> 3:48:54.360]  You know, Soros runs the old radio free Europe and Radio Liberty now, it puts out all his
[3:48:54.360 --> 3:48:59.280]  propaganda that they, primarily at Russia, but at other countries as well, where he's
[3:48:59.280 --> 3:49:00.600]  up to no good.
[3:49:00.600 --> 3:49:01.600]  Are you kidding?
[3:49:01.600 --> 3:49:06.320]  He's, he's producing, his front groups are producing many films about me now.
[3:49:06.320 --> 3:49:09.440]  And I mean, I know this, this guy sends hit teams into countries too.
[3:49:09.440 --> 3:49:12.720]  It's kind of, kind of creepy, Wayne, but you don't think he'll come after us physically?
[3:49:12.720 --> 3:49:14.520]  Well, I hope not.
[3:49:14.520 --> 3:49:20.120]  Um, you know, but look, he's a guy, the multi-billionaire, so you know, he can do whatever he, you know,
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:24.080]  whatever his money can buy, but the, but the good thing is there's a pushback against
[3:49:24.080 --> 3:49:28.600]  Soros and the Republic of Georgia is now an anti-Soros political party.
[3:49:28.600 --> 3:49:32.560]  They called, they called him out in Moldova, he tried to stage a revolution, they're called
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:35.800]  the Twitter revolution, it failed, and Ukraine are after him.
[3:49:35.800 --> 3:49:41.440]  So I, I see that, that they're basically there's this reaction against Soros and the
[3:49:41.440 --> 3:49:46.040]  more we expose them, the more the reaction will become, you know, stronger against Morales.
[3:49:46.040 --> 3:49:50.440]  I want to come back and cram in a few final calls for you, but real quick, tell us about
[3:49:50.440 --> 3:49:52.960]  Air France that disappeared.
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:53.960]  Go ahead.
[3:49:53.960 --> 3:49:58.000]  I was told by people from, with links to three intelligence services, British, French and
[3:49:58.000 --> 3:50:03.240]  American, uh, uh, that, uh, look at the passenger list, there were two individuals who were
[3:50:03.240 --> 3:50:07.800]  getting ready to unveil their, this year's, uh, survey on small arms in Geneva, they've
[3:50:07.800 --> 3:50:13.320]  been battling drug and weapons, uh, smugglers, the global smugglers, and, uh, they were
[3:50:13.320 --> 3:50:18.080]  on that, uh, flight, very key people in the war against the proliferation against, uh,
[3:50:18.080 --> 3:50:21.920]  uh, drugs and, and small arms, uh, these cartels.
[3:50:21.920 --> 3:50:26.520]  Well, I mean, they're talking about weird electronic interference already and how would
[3:50:26.520 --> 3:50:28.760]  this super modern plane just disappear?
[3:50:28.760 --> 3:50:29.760]  Uh, who was it?
[3:50:29.760 --> 3:50:30.760]  They were trying to kill.
[3:50:30.760 --> 3:50:36.240]  Well, the, the, the, the two individuals were, uh, Ronald Dreyer, a Swiss diplomat
[3:50:36.240 --> 3:50:40.840]  and Pablo Dreyfuss, who had worked with the Brazilian government to combat drug gangs
[3:50:40.840 --> 3:50:42.920]  and, uh, weapons and drug smuggling.
[3:50:42.920 --> 3:50:46.440]  There was also a former Brazilian royal on board.
[3:50:46.440 --> 3:50:47.440]  That's true too.
[3:50:47.440 --> 3:50:50.840]  Well, he may have been collateral damage along with a couple others, senior, uh, corporate
[3:50:50.840 --> 3:50:51.840]  executive.
[3:50:51.840 --> 3:50:52.840]  Yeah.
[3:50:52.840 --> 3:50:53.840]  Interesting.
[3:50:53.840 --> 3:50:56.120]  Wayne Madsen stayed there jamming a few final calls.
[3:50:56.120 --> 3:51:02.200]  The wildcards on the other side, stay with us, transmission, nearing completion.
[3:51:02.200 --> 3:51:05.680]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[3:51:05.680 --> 3:51:09.560]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[3:51:09.560 --> 3:51:11.160]  than when drinking the water?
[3:51:11.160 --> 3:51:15.000]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:16.000]  into the skin.
[3:51:16.000 --> 3:51:20.640]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to
[3:51:20.640 --> 3:51:25.960]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[3:51:25.960 --> 3:51:27.220]  algae and fungus.
[3:51:27.220 --> 3:51:32.080]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever
[3:51:32.080 --> 3:51:33.080]  comes first.
[3:51:33.080 --> 3:51:37.240]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:51:37.240 --> 3:51:39.280]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[3:51:39.280 --> 3:51:40.280]  What about you?
[3:51:40.280 --> 3:51:45.640]  Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free
[3:51:45.640 --> 3:51:46.640]  shipping.
[3:51:46.640 --> 3:51:51.640]  Call the Berkey guy in order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[3:51:51.640 --> 3:51:58.760]  That's 1-877-886-3653 or order online by visiting us at Directive21.com.
[3:51:58.760 --> 3:52:02.280]  That's Directive, the number 21.com now.
[3:52:02.280 --> 3:52:07.720]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:07.720 --> 3:52:14.320]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:52:14.320 --> 3:52:15.680]  just as well funded.
[3:52:15.680 --> 3:52:20.840]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:20.840 --> 3:52:22.320]  of the American people.
[3:52:22.320 --> 3:52:26.720]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:26.720 --> 3:52:31.840]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:31.840 --> 3:52:38.360]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.360 --> 3:52:41.920]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.920 --> 3:52:48.840]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.
[3:52:48.840 --> 3:52:54.400]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high
[3:52:54.400 --> 3:52:57.000]  quality at prismplanet.tv.
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:53:00.600]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:53:00.600 --> 3:53:05.800]  Ah, springtime, now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs
[3:53:05.800 --> 3:53:08.640]  away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[3:53:08.640 --> 3:53:13.280]  The answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[3:53:13.280 --> 3:53:17.840]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP
[3:53:17.840 --> 3:53:19.120]  to kill parasites.
[3:53:19.120 --> 3:53:23.880]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant
[3:53:23.880 --> 3:53:27.720]  to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[3:53:27.720 --> 3:53:30.720]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[3:53:30.720 --> 3:53:35.120]  Our natural insecticides work in the home on plants and in your garden, killing pests
[3:53:35.120 --> 3:53:39.880]  mechanically not with poisons, so pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your
[3:53:39.880 --> 3:53:41.600]  children or pets.
[3:53:41.600 --> 3:53:46.880]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas, roaches, crickets and more
[3:53:46.880 --> 3:53:51.320]  and save enough to use on your pets, ridding them of fleas and other pests.

[3:53:57.400 --> 3:54:17.040]  All right, final segment, I should have gone to your calls earlier, Lewis, Patty, Trina,
[3:54:17.040 --> 3:54:18.040]  Catherine, Steve, many others holding.
[3:54:18.040 --> 3:54:19.040]  We'll try to get to all of your quick questions from them.
[3:54:19.040 --> 3:54:21.040]  Lewis in Texas, you're on the air with our gift.
[3:54:21.040 --> 3:54:23.040]  How you doing, Alex?
[3:54:23.040 --> 3:54:24.040]  Good.
[3:54:24.040 --> 3:54:27.960]  I know you're short on time, I'll call back some other day, but I just wanted to tell
[3:54:27.960 --> 3:54:29.960]  them about this book.
[3:54:29.960 --> 3:54:33.240]  I had it said it before by Mary Kay Baxter, Divine Revelation of Hell.
[3:54:33.240 --> 3:54:34.240]  I don't know if you've read it.
[3:54:34.240 --> 3:54:40.640]  Chapter 18 talks about the total enslavement, it's a prophecy given to her in a vision,
[3:54:40.640 --> 3:54:45.760]  but anyway, I'm not familiar with it, but send it to me, thank you, I appreciate the
[3:54:45.760 --> 3:54:46.760]  call.
[3:54:46.760 --> 3:54:50.800]  So we're taking calls for our guests, but I guess the callers aren't going to honor
[3:54:50.800 --> 3:54:51.800]  that.
[3:54:51.800 --> 3:54:55.560]  Patty in New York, you're on the air, Patty, Patty just dropped, let's go to Trina in
[3:54:55.560 --> 3:54:56.560]  Colorado.
[3:54:56.560 --> 3:54:58.040]  Trina, you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:54:58.040 --> 3:55:02.840]  Hi, Alex, I just wanted to give you a call, I have two subjects for you.
[3:55:02.840 --> 3:55:09.000]  I've been a follower of yours for about five years, I have all your CDs, all your DVDs
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:14.960]  and everything, and I was just watching a thing about, it was on Bill O'Reilly and
[3:55:14.960 --> 3:55:20.680]  it was Ron Paul, he was on the show doing Freemason handshakes and this YouTube thing
[3:55:20.680 --> 3:55:24.560]  was just showing a lot about, all right, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, I appreciate your call
[3:55:24.560 --> 3:55:29.280]  and we're out of time, you can call me back tomorrow about that.
[3:55:29.280 --> 3:55:34.320]  You know, if you watch enough videos of me shaking hands, sometimes you'll see me grab
[3:55:34.320 --> 3:55:36.160]  somebody over the hand.
[3:55:36.160 --> 3:55:40.800]  Ron Paul is not a Mason, but in South Texas in politics, I think there's a photo of him
[3:55:40.800 --> 3:55:45.880]  speaking at a lodge, a lot of people rent those out.
[3:55:45.880 --> 3:55:49.800]  It's about his principles and the fruit he is born and auditing the Fed.
[3:55:49.800 --> 3:55:54.000]  And most people who are Masons are not higher level and not involved in anything evil.
[3:55:54.000 --> 3:55:59.240]  But you notice why I don't take a lot of calls because I got Wayne Madsen on about all these
[3:55:59.240 --> 3:56:04.400]  subjects and I said calls for Wayne Madsen and it's always all over the map.
[3:56:04.400 --> 3:56:08.400]  So I guess we'll have days where we just open the phones up to anything, but I guess I can't
[3:56:08.400 --> 3:56:12.720]  take calls with guests because my audience has gotten so conditioned to do whatever they
[3:56:12.720 --> 3:56:16.920]  want that they won't even ever talk to my guest.
[3:56:16.920 --> 3:56:22.000]  And I guess I'll ask Wayne Madsen about Ron Paul being a secret agent of the Masons.
[3:56:22.000 --> 3:56:23.000]  Any comments, Wayne?
[3:56:23.000 --> 3:56:28.000]  Well, I mean, I, you know, up in this town in DC, you have to go to all kinds of groups
[3:56:28.000 --> 3:56:31.520]  that, first of all, fundraising, so you don't know where you're going to wind up and who
[3:56:31.520 --> 3:56:32.520]  you're talking to.
[3:56:32.520 --> 3:56:38.480]  So I, you know, if anybody winds up in a, you know, a Masonic hall or a Jehovah Witness
[3:56:38.480 --> 3:56:42.040]  place or whatever, I mean, I, I, I just, it doesn't really matter.
[3:56:42.040 --> 3:56:46.360]  It's really what, how they vote in Congress and not where they're, where they're conducting
[3:56:46.360 --> 3:56:47.360]  these fundraisers.
[3:56:47.360 --> 3:56:52.080]  So that's, that's actually all done by their campaign staffs anyway, so they have very
[3:56:52.080 --> 3:56:57.760]  little input into that, but it's, it's, it's, it's where they're, where they're coming
[3:56:57.760 --> 3:57:01.360]  from in committee, in subcommittee and how they vote.
[3:57:01.360 --> 3:57:03.240]  You gotta judge a tree.
[3:57:03.240 --> 3:57:07.440]  You gotta judge a tree by its fruits and Ron Paul's solid gold, Wayne, I look forward
[3:57:07.440 --> 3:57:08.440]  to talking to you soon.
[3:57:08.440 --> 3:57:12.000]  I'm going to call you if it's okay in about 10 minutes after show to talk about some other
[3:57:12.000 --> 3:57:13.000]  stuff with you.
[3:57:13.000 --> 3:57:14.000]  Okay, bro.
[3:57:14.000 --> 3:57:15.000]  Super.
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:16.000]  Okay.
[3:57:16.000 --> 3:57:17.000]  Thank you.
[3:57:17.000 --> 3:57:18.000]  There he goes.
[3:57:18.000 --> 3:57:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, uh, I don't have time to go all these calls, but you can call me
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:24.000]  tomorrow.
[3:57:24.000 --> 3:57:32.280]  Kathleen and Catherine, Steve, Mark and others look, I've seen some of the videos saying bad
[3:57:32.280 --> 3:57:36.560]  things about Ron Paul and I know he has really bad arthritis has had a lot of stuff.
[3:57:36.560 --> 3:57:40.280]  People have slowed down enough videos of me waving my hands in the air and they've gotten
[3:57:40.280 --> 3:57:46.960]  me, you know, doing, you know, this, uh, it's insane.
[3:57:46.960 --> 3:57:49.360]  It's, it's, it's totally insane.
[3:57:49.360 --> 3:57:54.640]  Uh, people say my myspace because it has like a ring of stars, like a dollar bill with
[3:57:54.640 --> 3:57:58.320]  me and it's some satanic interdimensional reptoid portal.
[3:57:58.320 --> 3:57:59.600]  Look, I'll tell you this.
[3:57:59.600 --> 3:58:00.600]  I'm a Christian.
[3:58:00.600 --> 3:58:01.600]  I'm fighting the new world order.
[3:58:01.600 --> 3:58:04.200]  I know Ron Paul is a hardworking, good Christian man.
[3:58:04.200 --> 3:58:07.720]  I know some of his family and I know his fruits are what matter.
[3:58:07.720 --> 3:58:13.800]  We got bigger problems to deal with instead of just imagining things where they're not
[3:58:13.800 --> 3:58:14.800]  there.
[3:58:14.800 --> 3:58:20.080]  I mean, we've had banks that have stolen $14 plus trillion dollars from us in eight months,
[3:58:20.080 --> 3:58:21.080]  seven months.
[3:58:21.080 --> 3:58:24.680]  Let's do something about that, but take Ron Paul having to run around and fundraise all
[3:58:24.680 --> 3:58:26.680]  day instead of fighting the new world order.
[3:58:26.680 --> 3:58:30.320]  I'm the same way having to try to make money to get the word out all day.
[3:58:30.320 --> 3:58:31.320]  Support us.
[3:58:31.320 --> 3:58:35.920]  Donate to the money buy, buy the box, the, uh, the books and videos and info wars.com.
[3:58:35.920 --> 3:58:37.320]  We need your support.
[3:58:37.320 --> 3:58:38.320]  And I bless you all.
[3:58:38.320 --> 3:58:39.320]  Good job.
[3:58:39.320 --> 3:58:40.320]  Crew.
[3:58:40.320 --> 3:58:46.160]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[3:58:46.160 --> 3:58:51.920]  Be sure to visit GCN live.com today.
[3:58:51.920 --> 3:58:52.920]  Hello friends.
[3:58:52.920 --> 3:58:53.920]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:58:53.920 --> 3:58:57.320]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self sufficient and today that's more
[3:58:57.320 --> 3:58:58.320]  important than ever.
[3:58:58.320 --> 3:59:01.320]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[3:59:01.320 --> 3:59:02.920]  You'll never have to scan in a bread line.
[3:59:02.920 --> 3:59:03.920]  You have your own bread.
[3:59:03.920 --> 3:59:08.000]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[3:59:08.000 --> 3:59:09.000]  in any emergency.
[3:59:09.000 --> 3:59:12.840]  If you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation
[3:59:12.840 --> 3:59:13.840]  between you.
[3:59:13.840 --> 3:59:18.000]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:59:18.000 --> 3:59:20.320]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[3:59:20.320 --> 3:59:23.920]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[3:59:23.920 --> 3:59:29.240]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
