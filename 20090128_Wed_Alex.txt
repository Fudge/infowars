[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:19.000]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.000 --> 00:23.080]  Texas alex jones
[00:23.080 --> 00:28.920]  more is happening in a day than previously happened in a month more is
[00:28.920 --> 00:31.840]  happening in a month on the agenda of the new world or than what happened
[00:31.840 --> 00:37.800]  previously in a year or even a decade this is going to be one of the most
[00:37.800 --> 00:44.560]  important broadcast I have ever done today it is the 28th day of January 2009
[00:44.560 --> 00:49.160]  I rescheduled a guest last week because I was covering the aftermath of the
[00:49.160 --> 00:54.200]  Obama coordination Kevin Annette Reverend Kevin Annette who documents that
[00:54.200 --> 01:03.400]  they're still killing Native Americans in Canada on the reservations the
[01:03.400 --> 01:07.920]  children that their Canadian CPS takes from the Native families this is on
[01:07.920 --> 01:13.680]  record he caused this news a few years ago to be broken nationally in Canada and
[01:13.680 --> 01:19.960]  it's an example of the level of tyranny going on in the West that the general
[01:19.960 --> 01:25.200]  public isn't aware of and it shows the capacity of governments to put people in
[01:25.200 --> 01:31.360]  camps and to quietly through institutions kill them so the Canadian
[01:31.360 --> 01:36.520]  native Holocaust and I'm not going to reschedule him today the news that
[01:36.520 --> 01:42.960]  developed last night I frankly should clear the decks have no guest on today
[01:42.960 --> 01:49.360]  but I'm gonna get to it the big news in a moment but because this dovetails into
[01:49.360 --> 01:54.080]  camps and institutionalized systems through the health departments that are
[01:54.080 --> 01:58.960]  going to be used to put Americans in camps it dovetails so we're going to
[01:58.960 --> 02:07.040]  spend 45 minutes with him next hour then I've got Charles Sleppian who's in the
[02:07.040 --> 02:10.840]  LA Times article last week about hundreds and hundreds of people being
[02:10.840 --> 02:15.240]  charged as terrorists on planes for even arguing with stewardess isn't being
[02:15.240 --> 02:18.640]  charged under the Patriot Act and having their due process stripped from them
[02:18.640 --> 02:22.280]  that's the whole issue not just that they're being charged for talking back
[02:22.280 --> 02:28.800]  it's that they're being charged as terrorist under the USA Patriot Act so
[02:28.800 --> 02:37.680]  that dovetails as well with the main story I'm about to cover and then in the
[02:37.680 --> 02:42.520]  fourth hour today I'm going to go back into this top story for the entire
[02:42.520 --> 02:51.680]  fourth hour while we're live at prisonplanet.tv now I'm not gonna get
[02:51.680 --> 02:54.760]  up here on air I'm not gonna hyperventilate I'm not gonna yell I'm not
[02:54.760 --> 03:02.440]  gonna scream at least till later I'm gonna try to be calm and go over this
[03:02.440 --> 03:05.080]  because when I learned of this yesterday afternoon I forgot off the
[03:05.080 --> 03:10.280]  year all day my mind was racing all night until about 2 a.m. I couldn't even
[03:10.280 --> 03:20.160]  go to sleep researching it and the reason it's so bad is that it is exactly
[03:20.160 --> 03:25.440]  what I said they would do it is exactly the way I said they would lay it out and
[03:25.440 --> 03:32.240]  the way they would introduce it and the way they would try to sell it and it
[03:32.240 --> 03:37.360]  almost lessens the magnitude of it because we've been building up to this
[03:37.360 --> 03:43.400]  for years we've been covering it at nauseam and warning people so long that
[03:43.400 --> 03:48.640]  now as it's actually happening even myself in a way is conditioned
[03:48.640 --> 03:54.840]  subconsciously to accept it now I'm gonna build the suspense deliberately so
[03:54.840 --> 03:58.320]  that people will pay attention if I just come in here and cover this news like I
[03:58.320 --> 04:05.840]  do every day in a way it lessens the information it's still effective it's
[04:05.840 --> 04:11.200]  still positive to expose it it's just not as effective if I just mix it in with
[04:11.200 --> 04:17.960]  all the other news I am asking every listener right now right now whether
[04:17.960 --> 04:21.760]  you're listening on an AM or FM station whether you're listening on global

[08:22.440 --> 08:31.000]  in t-minus five minutes I'm gonna launch with our top story and to say it's a
[08:31.000 --> 08:40.760]  news report really does it injustice it's it's it's it's a final piece of a
[08:40.760 --> 08:46.880]  puzzle it's exactly what I said they were doing we are exactly precisely
[08:46.880 --> 08:52.880]  right about the entire infrastructure of what they're setting up we have been
[08:52.880 --> 08:56.880]  completely dead on from our historical research and the government documents
[08:56.880 --> 09:01.920]  but the fact that they are now announcing it and pushing it exactly
[09:01.920 --> 09:09.280]  100% as we said they would when they entered the final phase this is it this
[09:09.280 --> 09:18.880]  is it this is it do you understand and I'm not going to theatrically play
[09:18.880 --> 09:22.520]  air raid sirens in the background but that frankly is what people should be
[09:22.520 --> 09:30.440]  hearing right now but it's so serious I'm not going to add any theatrics in a
[09:30.440 --> 09:36.920]  pathetic attempt to try to get you to stir towards action but I'm telling you

[10:04.400 --> 10:14.120]  going to calmly go over it then coming up US Supreme Court says passengers can
[10:14.120 --> 10:19.880]  be frisk the US Supreme Court ruled Monday that police officers have leeway
[10:19.880 --> 10:25.360]  to frisk a passenger in a car stop for a traffic violation even if nothing
[10:25.360 --> 10:31.680]  indicates the passengers committed a crime or is about to do so total police
[10:31.680 --> 10:36.200]  state total third world nation absolute annihilation of the fourth and fifth
[10:36.200 --> 10:40.680]  amendment the court on Monday unanimously overruled in Arizona appeals
[10:40.680 --> 10:46.560]  court that threw out evidence found during such an encounter here's another
[10:46.560 --> 10:51.600]  one PBS confirms that NSA could have prevented 9-11 as we told you seven
[10:51.600 --> 10:58.080]  years ago the people listening at the NSA like civil Edmonds heard the
[10:58.080 --> 11:04.400]  government planning the attacks by the way Turley Obama's a cestry to war
[11:04.400 --> 11:09.040]  crimes of no prosecution so I've got to hand it to Keith Ubram we said he's
[11:09.040 --> 11:14.400]  worshiping Obama when Obama flip-flops and lies and commits to the globalist
[11:14.400 --> 11:22.400]  agenda that he was bred for that he was raised up to fill will Keith
[11:22.400 --> 11:30.080]  Oberman go after Obama and he is doing that to some extent wonder how long
[11:30.080 --> 11:43.200]  he'll be on the air I've got a another report here that is amazing out of
[11:43.200 --> 11:50.880]  market watch the Wall Street Journal see everything is go date now they're now
[11:50.880 --> 11:56.040]  unveiling it all because they're going with it when they unveiled it it's go
[11:56.040 --> 11:59.240]  day this isn't the big story but it ties in normally this would be the big story
[11:59.240 --> 12:03.200]  of the day how realistic is a North American currency question mark Wall
[12:03.200 --> 12:09.040]  Street Journal commentary uniting US Canada Mexico money could result from
[12:09.040 --> 12:16.960]  crisis now that's the Wall Street Journal and I told you that they would
[12:16.960 --> 12:22.640]  announce the North American Union as the answer to the banking crisis I told
[12:22.640 --> 12:33.920]  you that 13 years ago not because Alex Jones is smart but because I know how to
[12:33.920 --> 12:41.120]  read CFR and trilateral Commission and Club of Rome and Rand Corporation
[12:41.120 --> 12:48.520]  declassified and public white papers from the think tanks that's what's so
[12:48.520 --> 12:53.160]  disgusting about all of this it's all laid out in a detailed blueprint in a
[12:53.160 --> 13:00.000]  roadmap it's all going to happen the FEMA camps everything and these idiots
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.920]  go on info wars.com and they comment oh Alex has been saying North American
[13:04.920 --> 13:09.360]  Union for a long time he's been saying FEMA camps for a long time as it's
[13:09.360 --> 13:14.000]  materializing and we've backed it off we've held it back we've slowed it down
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.960]  and we've got a chance to beat it because we did analyze the enemy attack
[13:17.960 --> 13:24.040]  profile and because we did put out their attack profile. Imagine a watchman on a
[13:24.040 --> 13:28.720]  wall of a citadel of a keep of a fortress of a castle and for a week he's
[13:28.720 --> 13:34.080]  saying over that hill I just saw a huge army and the people won't even come up
[13:34.080 --> 13:38.680]  to the parapet to look out 10 miles on the horizon and see the dust of the
[13:38.680 --> 13:43.360]  marching army well now the army is battering the gate they've got traders
[13:43.360 --> 13:48.440]  inside the citadel they're catapulting firebombs in the country is burning down
[13:48.440 --> 13:52.320]  around us and there are people more than ever attacking me of course most of
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.960]  our government operatives are fellow travelers but the point is my god you're
[13:56.960 --> 14:02.080]  burning up your own house you are just you are so committed to your delusions
[14:02.080 --> 14:07.320]  that you won't listen to people that have figured it all out and who've been
[14:07.320 --> 14:16.640]  right every step of the way the fall the republic has been carefully crafted we
[14:16.640 --> 14:22.680]  are now here we are now at the precipice leaning out the enemy is holding us by
[14:22.680 --> 14:27.680]  the scruff of our neck about to drop us will we grab their hand that's holding
[14:27.680 --> 14:32.800]  us will we hold on to them at least so if they let go of us they go over either
[14:32.800 --> 14:36.960]  or will we just sit there saying no we're not being held out over the edge of a
[14:36.960 --> 14:42.200]  cliff will you continue to live in denial so how realistic is a north american
[14:42.200 --> 14:47.680]  currency uniting us canada mexico money could result from crisis and they go on
[14:47.680 --> 14:57.960]  to say from the wall street journal their market watch page they go on to say
[14:57.960 --> 15:02.440]  that the only answer to fix the banking crisis that was engineered by the banks
[15:02.440 --> 15:08.600]  is a north american union and the amaro
[15:11.320 --> 15:16.360]  ladies and gentlemen we read about the amaro in 89 and 90 in money magazine
[15:16.360 --> 15:19.880]  other publications they've been proposing it and setting it up this long
[15:19.880 --> 15:26.080]  and these bastards have engineered the destruction of our financial and our
[15:26.080 --> 15:31.840]  economic and our liberty future and if you don't face the enemy and realize
[15:31.840 --> 15:37.960]  who the enemies are it's over so I'm going to get into that report as well
[15:37.960 --> 15:51.320]  today now I have put out the call for every listener of this radio show in
[15:51.320 --> 15:55.880]  the last 15 minutes I've been begging you and asking you to call your friends
[15:55.880 --> 16:00.160]  your family your neighbors we need to have a huge response to this this needs
[16:00.160 --> 16:08.320]  to go ultra mega viral on the web and what needs to go viral is the proper
[16:08.320 --> 16:16.160]  analysis of what has just occurred because the establishment is putting it
[16:16.160 --> 16:22.240]  out viral with their spin on it exactly as we said they would put their spin on
[16:22.240 --> 16:30.840]  it we have to counter that so the unsophisticated public has a chance to
[16:30.840 --> 16:41.600]  understand and see how diabolical this is to get everybody's attention we're
[16:41.600 --> 16:51.360]  gonna have 20 seconds of silence right now before I go in to this unbelievable
[16:51.360 --> 16:58.080]  report because it is the final piece it's like tumblers on a safe locking in
[16:58.080 --> 17:07.880]  position in the door opening this is absolute confirmation of the entire
[17:07.880 --> 17:11.320]  enemy attack profile
[17:11.320 --> 17:20.480]  you understand to have a moment of silence for the Republic
[17:20.480 --> 17:42.320]  you all right here it is ladies and gentlemen an article by Paul Joseph
[17:42.320 --> 17:52.640]  Watson at prisonplanet.com last night's top story new legislation authorizes
[17:52.640 --> 17:58.720]  FEMA camps in the United States now let's stop right there before I get into
[17:58.720 --> 18:06.600]  the article you notice that years after decades after the National Security
[18:06.600 --> 18:11.840]  Agency illegally put in snooping hubs in all telecommunication centers were all
[18:11.840 --> 18:22.000]  phone calls all emails all faxes all go through their system they passed laws
[18:22.000 --> 18:31.800]  legalizing their criminality giving themselves immunity after the bankers
[18:31.800 --> 18:38.280]  engineer the collapse of the society so they can consolidate it they pass a law
[18:38.280 --> 18:48.480]  to give themselves immunity that was the banker bailout they always pass the law
[18:48.480 --> 18:52.600]  after they've already constructed the system and beta tested and it's ready to
[18:52.600 --> 18:59.280]  go or has already been operating and it's the same thing here remember the
[18:59.280 --> 19:06.120]  Houston Chronicle in January of 2006 saying giant one million person FEMA
[19:06.120 --> 19:13.280]  camps paid for by the White House and Homeland Security for a subsidiary of
[19:13.280 --> 19:20.440]  Halliburton Kellogg Brown and Root and then of course there were previous camps
[19:20.440 --> 19:25.120]  built in the 80s under Rex 84 that was declassified in Congress we have the
[19:25.120 --> 19:32.160]  congressional testimony and people still deny it we have the secret civilian
[19:32.160 --> 19:37.840]  inmate labor camp program secretly started in 86 American citizens federal
[19:37.840 --> 19:41.920]  prisoners were held in forced labor camps at US military installations in
[19:41.920 --> 19:48.440]  secret to beta tests how to keep it secret from 86 to 97 when they declassified
[19:48.440 --> 19:53.240]  it I'm gonna go through the background of this and then give you the new
[19:53.240 --> 20:00.080]  development what we learned from this bill the architecture of the death camps
[20:00.080 --> 20:04.760]  this year many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back
[20:04.760 --> 20:09.680]  on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future in these trouble
[20:09.680 --> 20:13.680]  times one of the most important things your family can have is good health some
[20:13.680 --> 20:17.600]  of the contributors to poor health are parasites viruses toxins and heavy
[20:17.600 --> 20:23.360]  metals it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the

[24:19.880 --> 24:26.120]  Amendment overturning one of the key areas of the Bill of Rights it stands
[24:26.120 --> 24:32.040]  against the tyrannical police state Homeland Security announcements of
[24:32.040 --> 24:35.840]  20,000 combat troops to deal with the American people the Army War College
[24:35.840 --> 24:39.680]  admitting a new mission is to fight the American people the entire Homeland
[24:39.680 --> 24:44.040]  Security apparatus announcing through Northcom that it is here to control a
[24:44.040 --> 24:52.600]  military district and an occupied nation their words not mine it's here now the
[24:52.600 --> 24:58.480]  reason this bill is so key is that it lays out how they're going to sell
[24:58.480 --> 25:04.120]  Americans going into the camps and the infrastructure and architecture it's
[25:04.120 --> 25:10.880]  going to be set up under the NAFTA super highways which will be armored grids how
[25:10.880 --> 25:14.760]  they're going to lock down the city's everything the clergy response teams
[25:14.760 --> 25:18.400]  remember three years ago two different pastors broke right here on the
[25:18.400 --> 25:24.160]  Genesis Network secret FEMA documents not for disclosure 13,000 secretly
[25:24.160 --> 25:28.240]  recruited preachers to give sermons telling their flock to turn in their
[25:28.240 --> 25:34.400]  guns take force inoculations go to camps a year and a half after we broke that
[25:34.400 --> 25:42.080]  story pastor butch paw myself with some of the pastors by the way Homeland
[25:42.080 --> 25:49.720]  Security visited them and then threatened them even though we'd hidden their identity
[25:50.720 --> 25:55.920]  it came out on the news that indeed they done this and they were doubling it to
[25:55.920 --> 26:00.880]  26,000 preachers now it doesn't get any more hardcore tyranny than that you know
[26:00.880 --> 26:06.320]  the movie red dawn fictitious Russian takeover police state who are they using
[26:06.320 --> 26:10.560]  in the little town to suppress the population the old mayor and the major
[26:10.560 --> 26:15.880]  pastor that's because they've done this all over Eastern Europe the Germans did
[26:15.880 --> 26:23.000]  this all over Europe the communists Chinese did this this is how it's done
[26:23.000 --> 26:33.640]  this is how this unfolds and it's in the bill it's in the bill we have them and
[26:33.640 --> 26:36.760]  it's how they're going to introduce you to the camps I mean you don't think
[26:36.760 --> 26:39.960]  you're just gonna come out and say hey we've built death camps we're you know
[26:39.960 --> 26:45.640]  this is wonderful no the Germans when they put millions of people in forced
[26:45.640 --> 26:49.680]  labor camps on record would say oh because the economy imploding or
[26:49.680 --> 26:53.360]  because local racial strife or whatever we're going to take you to your own
[26:53.360 --> 27:01.040]  little fence community for your safety well that's what this says this is how
[27:01.040 --> 27:04.320]  they're going to roll it out this is how they're going to do it we told you
[27:04.320 --> 27:09.360]  that they would roll out putting troops on the streets to quote stop DWI and to
[27:09.360 --> 27:13.400]  help with car wrecks and what did they come out and say they're going to help
[27:13.400 --> 27:17.080]  with DWI and car wrecks how are they going to introduce things where it
[27:17.080 --> 27:23.120]  sounds good how are they going to introduce compulsory service when it's
[27:23.120 --> 27:31.360]  on change.gov for basically all Americans up to about age 65 how are they
[27:31.360 --> 27:34.520]  gonna do that they say oh soup kitchen soup kitchens and then they announced
[27:34.520 --> 27:38.600]  what the program really is so again they put in an envelope of sicky sweetness
[27:38.600 --> 27:47.160]  but in the middle is the tyranny inside the container and that's why this
[27:47.160 --> 27:53.440]  legislation is so unbelievable and it's also a very prominent key member of the
[27:53.440 --> 28:00.880]  New World Order in Congress is introduced it so understand
[28:00.880 --> 28:09.000]  we have been right about everything so I want to go over how they will get us
[28:09.000 --> 28:17.200]  into the camps what the camps are going to consist of how they're going to
[28:17.200 --> 28:25.880]  operate and how they're going to sell it to the public I'm going to cover this
[28:25.880 --> 28:34.600]  when we come back from break and it is of the highest import that even if you're
[28:34.600 --> 28:37.720]  not listening live on the Amor FM shortwave internet satellite that you
[28:37.720 --> 28:41.880]  take the free podcast you subscribe to it at info wars.com we also post an

[28:45.720 --> 28:49.720]  know because I'm going to go over the background I'm going to go over the
[28:49.720 --> 28:54.840]  infrastructure I'm going to go over how they're going to sell it we're going to
[28:54.840 --> 29:04.600]  cover it all here today and the most important point here is I have predicted
[29:04.600 --> 29:08.680]  in film after film after film and in radio show after radio show with guest
[29:08.680 --> 29:13.440]  after guest exactly how this would be sold because we had all these other
[29:13.440 --> 29:17.000]  declassified and classified and leaked parts of the program that were
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.440]  compartmentalized and so I could put them together and see exactly how they
[29:21.440 --> 29:24.920]  would push it and how they would sell it and that is exactly how they're now
[29:24.920 --> 29:32.160]  doing it this just further confirms as we go through time that we're on target
[29:32.160 --> 29:37.760]  we know the enemy attack profile we know the enemy targets we know the enemy
[29:37.760 --> 29:42.160]  attack profile we understand how they're going to do it we understand how
[29:42.160 --> 29:46.720]  they're going to push it will we be able to get the word out to the public so
[29:46.720 --> 29:51.640]  they understand the propaganda so they can not be controlled by it we're on

[33:32.840 --> 33:39.400]  millions of Americans being taken to forced labor camps it is in the bill
[33:39.400 --> 33:45.680]  new legislation authorizes FEMA camps in us all right let me go through a
[33:45.680 --> 33:52.760]  summation of the basic facts then go through details a this is not new
[33:52.760 --> 33:58.200]  quietly since the 1970s they have accelerated reopening the old world
[33:58.200 --> 34:01.600]  war two prisoner of war camps putting in new water and power keeping them
[34:01.600 --> 34:06.120]  updated and ready then under Rex 84 apartment was he classified a
[34:06.120 --> 34:11.120]  congressional hearings covered in my film police state to the takeover but
[34:11.120 --> 34:16.040]  you can just Google Rex 84 FEMA camp hearings Congress and will come up from
[34:16.040 --> 34:24.360]  1986 in 1990 our insiders the military told us at the base closures we're
[34:24.360 --> 34:27.880]  going to be used for infrastructure protection to build federal control
[34:27.880 --> 34:32.720]  grids that will be local regional capitals over the states and the
[34:32.720 --> 34:38.200]  cities and counties that reside in them threat integration centers FEMA command
[34:38.200 --> 34:43.040]  centers years later exactly what our inside sources told us turned out to be
[34:43.040 --> 34:48.880]  a hundred percent accurate secretly in 86 under Rex 84 they said we have to
[34:48.880 --> 34:54.640]  train cadres of army personnel that it's normal the the first conditioning is a
[34:54.640 --> 34:58.680]  police and military cross training them militarizing them teaching them the
[34:58.680 --> 35:08.440]  public's the enemy they set up 12 secret federal prison camps in 1986 you can
[35:08.440 --> 35:12.880]  just Google civilian and make labor camp program he will be on the army's own
[35:12.880 --> 35:17.920]  website this is now declassified and they report it like it's no big deal where
[35:17.920 --> 35:21.160]  they take federal prisoners and now state prisoners they've expanded to 24
[35:21.160 --> 35:27.520]  camps and growing remember with my research it's only up to the point that
[35:27.520 --> 35:32.200]  I last researched it it's such a large area to research that most my news is
[35:32.200 --> 35:37.680]  about a year old because it only comes out later our intelligence is massive
[35:37.680 --> 35:43.080]  but it's all gonna be integrated through my brain and so I'm not perfect so it's
[35:43.080 --> 35:53.080]  far worse than I'm saying that's the bottom line so secretly people said
[35:53.080 --> 35:56.720]  they couldn't have these secretly on record the army admits secretly from
[35:56.720 --> 36:03.360]  86 to 97 for 11 years the civilian and make labor camp program these are labor
[36:03.360 --> 36:12.200]  camps was kept secret then in 97 they declassified it the army runs them under
[36:12.200 --> 36:16.680]  the Department of Federal Presence and debate attested what they would do is
[36:16.680 --> 36:20.560]  they would tell the prisoners we'll let you out a few years early if you sign
[36:20.560 --> 36:24.960]  this form its contract to agree to go to the camp and to be quiet and not tell
[36:24.960 --> 36:29.280]  family about it that's how they beta tested and train the troops that all
[36:29.280 --> 36:32.360]  it's normal the prisoners like it that we don't talk about it it's classified
[36:32.360 --> 36:36.400]  but they live here at camps American citizens federal prisoners then they
[36:36.400 --> 36:40.760]  began in 97 when they declassified it to bring in state prisoners the number of
[36:40.760 --> 36:44.680]  camps stands at over 24
[36:46.840 --> 36:52.800]  now the reports are confirmed pouring in multiple camps in Texas camps all over
[36:52.800 --> 36:57.720]  the nation being built again the Houston Chronicle reported and other
[36:57.720 --> 37:02.440]  publications in 2006 that they're building FEMA camps for natural disasters
[37:02.440 --> 37:06.840]  emergencies terror attacks to house illegal aliens and steering civil
[37:06.840 --> 37:12.040]  unrest that was in the Houston Chronicle all these decades we've seen the troops
[37:12.040 --> 37:16.720]  secretly training with the military we go to the events we get detained we get
[37:16.720 --> 37:20.800]  in trouble we get chased in some cases they let us tape it with role players
[37:20.800 --> 37:23.560]  they've hired screaming I'm an American please I'm not the camp where'd you get
[37:23.560 --> 37:26.640]  the helmet where'd you get the gun and you're going to a FEMA camp where you
[37:26.640 --> 37:29.960]  from them from San Francisco the role players with the Marines with the Army
[37:29.960 --> 37:33.720]  doing this other cities the Marines walk up the army walks up with guns with the
[37:33.720 --> 37:36.920]  police says turn your cameras off to myself and others it's all in road to
[37:36.920 --> 37:40.520]  tyranny it's all in police state 2000 police state to the takeover police
[37:40.520 --> 37:45.920]  state 3 total enslavement so I'm screaming bloody murder about this I'm
[37:45.920 --> 37:49.760]  finding out there's this giant covert operation under continuity of government
[37:49.760 --> 37:54.520]  under infrastructure protection I find out from police chiefs emergency
[37:54.520 --> 37:59.000]  managers the SWAT team commander in Austin Lieutenant Beck the police chief
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.040]  of San Antonio I'm giving you sources here these are sit down interviews on
[38:02.040 --> 38:08.120]  video alley Philippus chief police San Antonio emergency manager in Kingsville
[38:08.120 --> 38:11.880]  Vietnam vet himself who was in intelligence they came to him so we're
[38:11.880 --> 38:16.000]  getting ready for martial law they tried to buy him off of cash when they
[38:16.000 --> 38:22.600]  said no suitcases of cash we went to other cities interviewed police chiefs
[38:22.600 --> 38:26.040]  where they'd clearly taken the money and they said we're not going to talk to you
[38:26.040 --> 38:32.920]  but yes US military is here in secret operations so I begin intense research
[38:32.920 --> 38:38.960]  in the 1996-97 on all of this and I start warning people they're gearing up
[38:38.960 --> 38:42.160]  they're gearing up people say well why doesn't it happen this year why doesn't
[38:42.160 --> 38:45.520]  happen next year you know Alex you're saying all this is happening you show
[38:45.520 --> 38:50.240]  us video you show us documents but but where is it they were building the
[38:50.240 --> 38:56.040]  infrastructure that's on record they were finding out which counties which
[38:56.040 --> 38:59.840]  cities which officials would go along with them which wouldn't which preachers
[38:59.840 --> 39:04.720]  which pastors which mayors which city managers could be promoted to regional
[39:04.720 --> 39:09.400]  government because they would play ball and go along and take the payoffs or the
[39:09.400 --> 39:13.000]  payoffs of advancement or
[39:13.000 --> 39:22.720]  suitcases and briefcases full of $100 bills this is a North comm operation
[39:22.720 --> 39:31.000]  North comm is in the military literature in 1993 it was not founded in 2002 it is
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.440]  the true government the military jurisdiction over North America they've
[39:35.440 --> 39:38.760]  signed deals with Canada and Mexico to use Canadian Mexican troops are in the
[39:38.760 --> 39:43.200]  U.S. Toronto Star other publications Congress bitch last year saying we weren't
[39:43.200 --> 39:46.880]  even informed of this you're supposed to inform us of this again there's hundreds
[39:46.880 --> 39:51.080]  of points I'm moving quick here all of this is going on all of this is
[39:51.080 --> 39:58.120]  happening we warn the public are training the Marines in the army the
[39:58.120 --> 40:02.600]  Navy's even creating their own private army that's in the Navy times private
[40:02.600 --> 40:05.880]  mercenary armies we tell you those are being prepared foreign troops are being
[40:05.880 --> 40:11.840]  prepared they announced in the SPP BAMP Canada 2007 meeting that it's a secret
[40:11.840 --> 40:16.400]  operation and that it will be funded by the carbon taxes and off the NAFTA
[40:16.400 --> 40:20.600]  highways and they will use military in each other's countries in the North
[40:20.600 --> 40:27.040]  American system under North comm Canadian and Mexican generals then serve and
[40:27.040 --> 40:32.160]  liaison with North comm we're in the North American Union this is seizure by
[40:32.160 --> 40:36.080]  foreign offshore banks this is a corporate takeover but they know it's
[40:36.080 --> 40:41.000]  illegitimate so the people may say no to it so they've got the military and the
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.920]  police state grid and the federalized local police and local state police to
[40:44.920 --> 40:48.400]  oppress the people when the public finally finds out they've been made
[40:48.400 --> 40:53.000]  destitute in the continent their forefathers
[40:53.680 --> 40:56.480]  conquered
[40:56.480 --> 41:05.400]  now once they build the infrastructure once they've beta tested the
[41:05.400 --> 41:10.360]  infrastructure once they've trained the local police the states once they know
[41:10.360 --> 41:13.200]  what counties and cities of their friends because a lot of the training is
[41:13.200 --> 41:17.400]  taking over US cities and counties and courthouses and mock cities for the US
[41:17.400 --> 41:24.480]  with role players as early as 1995 96 97 cooperative nugget with foreign troops
[41:24.480 --> 41:34.720]  training with role players screaming don't put me in a camp you understand and
[41:34.720 --> 41:37.320]  these won't be foreign troops and foreign uniforms these will be foreign
[41:37.320 --> 41:42.800]  troops in US uniform but you notice US uniforms have now been standardized to
[41:42.800 --> 41:52.000]  match the European uniforms this is real this is really happening now the big
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.680]  issue is how will they sell the public I'm going along with it phase one build
[41:56.680 --> 42:01.800]  the camps build the FEMA infrastructure set up the training centers create the
[42:01.800 --> 42:06.600]  core cadres find out who'll work with them expand it phase two set up
[42:06.600 --> 42:18.160]  infraguard 25,000 executives bureaucrats governors city managers county
[42:18.160 --> 42:24.800]  commissioners corporate heads with sidearms and this has come out in
[42:24.800 --> 42:32.680]  mainstream news just Google infraguard with shoot to kill orders on anyone
[42:32.680 --> 42:38.160]  they're told to kill during martial law so you have an auxiliary of executives
[42:38.160 --> 42:42.160]  in the next phase and it's now begun they're training their designates and
[42:42.160 --> 42:49.960]  quadrupling the number from 25,000 to over 100,000 that's what we know of
[42:49.960 --> 42:57.600]  armed auxiliary federal civilian forces sworn to national security in every
[42:57.600 --> 43:02.080]  corner of the United States and the feds even stage little terror attacks and
[43:02.080 --> 43:05.600]  cover them up in the news and say the public would panic you know you've got
[43:05.600 --> 43:09.080]  to be part of the secret stuff and the in the idiots most of them aren't evil
[43:09.080 --> 43:14.760]  they go oh yes I the terrorists hit our power plant we can't say anything but it
[43:14.760 --> 43:20.920]  was the feds with a pipe bomb so this is psychological warfare how do you bring
[43:20.920 --> 43:30.760]  down the US slowly in 2006 it was 13,000 in 2007 it was 26,000
[43:30.760 --> 43:36.800]  preachers we haven't gotten any new data or declassified or secret documents the
[43:36.800 --> 43:43.480]  number is unknown but the plan said doubling exponentially every year so
[43:43.480 --> 43:48.200]  we're conservatively looking over 60,000 preachers and everybody suddenly
[43:48.200 --> 43:50.920]  sees their local TV preachers and radio preachers saying you know you don't
[43:50.920 --> 43:53.720]  really need guns and there's an emergency you do what the government says
[43:53.720 --> 43:57.160]  and go to these centers for your safety and it's of the lore Romans 13 do it
[43:57.160 --> 44:06.680]  you're now seeing the at least 26,000 preachers do this they're setting the
[44:06.680 --> 44:10.880]  police into public schools telling the kids get ready for emergencies teaching
[44:10.880 --> 44:14.760]  him how to load on buses at gunpoint with their hands behind their heads all of
[44:14.760 --> 44:19.000]  this preparing everyone all of this teaching them learned helplessness to
[44:19.000 --> 44:27.000]  go to the camps now how are they going to sell this to the public now in the
[44:27.000 --> 44:33.040]  final phase remember they're gonna say oh we just built all these just now to
[44:33.040 --> 44:37.640]  keep you safe because the economy's imploding oh my gosh the banks have cut
[44:37.640 --> 44:43.920]  off of liquidity there's this big crisis people are starving there's high
[44:43.920 --> 44:50.520]  crime people are rioting as all the experts are now saying they'll do
[44:50.520 --> 44:54.760]  decades of this being set up decades of the troops training for this and so
[44:54.760 --> 44:58.080]  people are actually on info wars.com and prisonpond.com in the comment section
[44:58.080 --> 45:02.440]  under this article going well stuff's breaking down they got to do it and I
[45:02.440 --> 45:06.040]  always told you that right when the banking crisis began right when they
[45:06.040 --> 45:10.040]  engineered it they would then claim a new World Bank with power over the US with
[45:10.040 --> 45:13.600]  the Congress signing over its authority to take over private industry to take
[45:13.600 --> 45:17.560]  over the roads the infrastructure and it's now in the mainstream news and the
[45:17.560 --> 45:21.640]  Wall Street Journal saying well we need this and we need a new currency in a
[45:21.640 --> 45:26.160]  North American Union only that will fix the banking crisis how are they gonna
[45:26.160 --> 45:32.760]  sell it you're now seeing so how are they gonna sell the public how did the
[45:32.760 --> 45:36.840]  Soviets how did the Germans how did Mao sell it when they rounded up tens of
[45:36.840 --> 45:40.960]  millions and took them to forced labor camps and killed millions they would say
[45:40.960 --> 45:43.800]  the economy's falling apart or the public doesn't like you or there's been
[45:43.800 --> 45:48.600]  violent attacks on you or there's been high crime we're taking you to an
[45:48.600 --> 45:53.160]  emergency center see first they wouldn't let Jews and other people work or have
[45:53.160 --> 45:55.920]  businesses and a few years later they're bankrupt now their houses are being
[45:55.920 --> 46:00.440]  foreclosed oh zoning rules in Germany you can't have too many people living in
[46:00.440 --> 46:03.760]  one house because you've lost your homes we're gonna send you to a place for your
[46:03.760 --> 46:09.040]  own safety and a lot of people in Germany there's a bunch of groups they
[46:09.040 --> 46:14.200]  went after said okay I want to go to this community with a fence so you're
[46:14.200 --> 46:20.280]  safe it's all in the new bill it's all in the new bill and it says community
[46:20.280 --> 46:24.640]  pastors will office and community mayors and this is what they've already
[46:24.640 --> 46:29.160]  done in scores of counties and cities they take the old National Guard armories
[46:29.160 --> 46:33.160]  that back up on a few hundred acres or more they put new fences with bar bar
[46:33.160 --> 46:37.400]  facing in and they say this is the new threat integration center we're giving
[46:37.400 --> 46:42.600]  the local three cities in this area and the four counties or whatever the case
[46:42.600 --> 46:46.560]  may be it's different every area you'll come in here you'll have live cameras to
[46:46.560 --> 46:49.280]  all the federal cameras put up for traffic then later they tell us to
[46:49.280 --> 46:53.280]  surveil the public see everything is done in a stepped by step thing to
[46:53.280 --> 46:57.440]  condition those to acclimate the locals to find out who'll go with them to
[46:57.440 --> 47:00.920]  incrementally find out who the resistors are or who can reverse engineer
[47:00.920 --> 47:08.040]  what they're doing and understand it and they tell them this is an emergency
[47:08.040 --> 47:11.080]  anti-terrorist center and anti-crime center and then they announced as they
[47:11.080 --> 47:14.840]  first did five years ago in Green Bay oh guess what in the new emergency center
[47:14.840 --> 47:18.600]  you can type up wherever somebody's cell phone is and punch this button and
[47:18.600 --> 47:22.120]  track where they're at and hit this button and listen to the person's what
[47:22.120 --> 47:26.440]  they're saying see now it is at the NSA that has the authority illegally to
[47:26.440 --> 47:30.040]  listen to you without a warrant now local counties and cities in the threat
[47:30.040 --> 47:34.040]  integration centers where you got the National Guard building or a federal
[47:34.040 --> 47:37.520]  building they give them or an old mall that shuts down the feds by it and then
[47:37.520 --> 47:41.920]  invite everybody in so they can be part of the petty power trip and you've got
[47:41.920 --> 47:46.480]  the head preachers that lead the other preachers as Judas goats to tell the
[47:46.480 --> 47:50.120]  people to go to the camps you've got the local police the SWAT teams all
[47:50.120 --> 47:55.000]  integrated all trained now they federalize the National Guard say the

[53:53.960 --> 54:01.040]  pepper spray dot com wishes you and yours a safe and happy 2009
[54:03.200 --> 54:07.680]  all right let's get right back into the mill now itself I gave you some of the
[54:07.680 --> 54:12.680]  background and the key to all of this is when they're finally getting ready to
[54:12.680 --> 54:16.920]  really use it is when they announce it to the public the regular army to be on
[54:16.920 --> 54:19.720]  the streets that will be used against the American people the army where
[54:19.720 --> 54:23.200]  college has to start training the troops that yes it really was always for
[54:23.200 --> 54:27.280]  America and the American people but it's for your own good because the
[54:27.280 --> 54:31.000]  financial collapse is happening but remember they built all of this by
[54:31.000 --> 54:35.440]  design staged the terror attacks to build the public police state grid the
[54:35.440 --> 54:39.280]  surveillance grid now they're wheeling it around and aiming it at the American
[54:39.280 --> 54:45.160]  people and misdemeanors will get you in one of these camps for life new
[54:45.160 --> 54:50.080]  legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the US a new bill introduced in Congress
[54:50.080 --> 54:53.280]  authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to set up a network of FEMA
[54:53.280 --> 54:56.760]  camp facilities to be used to house US citizens in the event of a national
[54:56.760 --> 55:01.960]  emergency that's under PDD 51 including economic I'm gonna have Paul Watson do a
[55:01.960 --> 55:05.360]  Rosetta Stone article or he goes through all the points I'm making it's a great
[55:05.360 --> 55:10.280]  article wrote but I want to add them all under PDD 51 it's economic or any other
[55:10.280 --> 55:14.120]  emergency and the Congress has abolished has no authority the executive is in
[55:14.120 --> 55:19.000]  total control that's called tyranny the National Emergency Centers Act or HR 645
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.240]  mandates the establishment of national emergency centers to be located on
[55:22.240 --> 55:26.120]  military installations for the purpose of providing temporary housing medical
[55:26.120 --> 55:29.600]  and humanitarian assistance to individuals and families dislocated due to
[55:29.600 --> 55:34.200]  emergency or major disaster so see it's being pitched is that oh you're gonna go
[55:34.200 --> 55:38.520]  there for your safety but who's there the military the police the preachers
[55:38.520 --> 55:42.640]  that was from the bill the legislation also states the camps will be used to
[55:42.640 --> 55:46.080]  provide centralized locations to improve the coordination preparedness
[55:46.080 --> 55:49.080]  responsive recovery efforts of government private and non-profit entities
[55:49.080 --> 55:53.320]  and faith-based organizations so see they'll have public they already set them
[55:53.320 --> 55:57.120]  up FEMA offices they'll cut set up for hurricane but then ever leave and then
[55:57.120 --> 56:00.120]  it's oh we're gonna do and suddenly they just turned on all the billboards on
[56:00.120 --> 56:04.080]  290 all over the country big flashing billboards that say we're looking for a
[56:04.080 --> 56:07.600]  lost child we're looking for a lost old lady but then suddenly they're putting
[56:07.600 --> 56:13.280]  up signs like report terrorism 1-800 number or report illegal guns that they're
[56:13.280 --> 56:16.800]  now saying that they're now flashing that we have photos across the country
[56:16.800 --> 56:21.760]  in video see it always starts with oh it's soup kitchens for force compulsory
[56:21.760 --> 56:24.760]  service you're not against soup kitchens oh the army's gonna help you get out of
[56:24.760 --> 56:27.080]  a wrecked car you're not against getting out of a wrecked car
[56:27.080 --> 56:30.720]  oh we're finding Alzheimer's patients and kidnapped children and then
[56:30.720 --> 56:37.320]  suddenly and illegal guns and terrorist and call on your neighbors you see how
[56:37.320 --> 56:40.520]  they're converting it in the final phase is these youth brigades these
[56:40.520 --> 56:46.160]  tattletale squads this domestic security force just as big just as strong as the
[56:46.160 --> 56:49.360]  U.S. military and then Obama goes on the speech to say with force compulsory
[56:49.360 --> 56:55.800]  service and again it isn't Obama doing it he's just the front man but he can
[56:55.800 --> 57:00.160]  sell black Americans and others I'm going along he can sell Africa on accepting
[57:00.160 --> 57:03.840]  the new Africa Corps U.S. military there
[57:06.160 --> 57:09.560]  the legislation also states the camps will you provide centralized locations
[57:09.560 --> 57:12.680]  to improve the coordination preparedness response and recovery efforts of
[57:12.680 --> 57:16.480]  government private non not for private entities and faith-based organizations
[57:16.480 --> 57:22.040]  that's the 26,000 preachers that's the 25,000 at least they've been doubling in
[57:22.040 --> 57:27.880]  each year but that's secret executives and key infrastructure individuals I mean
[57:27.880 --> 57:35.120]  Mike who works here in this office worked for LCRA in their security and he
[57:35.120 --> 57:38.720]  already had a infrastructure protection badge two years before he even worked
[57:38.720 --> 57:41.760]  here see it's it's it's everything
[57:41.760 --> 57:46.160]  honestly the bill also states the camps can be used to meet other appropriate
[57:46.160 --> 57:49.720]  needs and if you nexus that with the John Warren Defense Authorization Act if
[57:49.720 --> 57:55.320]  you nexus that with the PDD 51 the Military Commissions Act the
[57:55.320 --> 57:58.360]  announcements of North comm it's for the American people they've said
[57:58.360 --> 58:02.400]  previously built into camps it's for American citizens as determined by the
[58:02.400 --> 58:05.840]  Secretary of Homeland Security need other appropriate needs is determined by
[58:05.840 --> 58:09.440]  the Secretary of Homeland Security an open-ended mandate which may many fear
[58:09.440 --> 58:12.000]  could mean the forced detention of American citizens in the event of
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.440]  widespread rioting a national emergency or total economic chaos which has been
[58:15.440 --> 58:19.160]  engineered by the bankers many credible forecasters predicted riots and
[58:19.160 --> 58:22.000]  rebellions in America that will dwarf those already witnessed in countries
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.640]  like Iceland and Greece with active duty military personnel already being stationed
[58:25.640 --> 58:29.080]  inside the U.S. and North com partly for the purpose of crowd control in their
[58:29.080 --> 58:32.400]  own words fears that Americans could be incarcerated detention camps are all
[58:32.400 --> 58:36.760]  too real but when we come back I will give you the coup de grace how they're

[1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:58.920]  breaking down if you're homeless you go live on the camps they'll have lots of
[1:00:58.920 --> 1:01:06.240]  newscasts of people living in the camps just like the hundreds of thousands of
[1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:11.160]  FEMA trailers in Louisiana Mississippi Oklahoma and other places and Greg
[1:01:11.160 --> 1:01:15.880]  Pallas with ABC News doing a story for them he also was working for BBC went
[1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:19.120]  and videotaped one and they said you have violated national infrastructure
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:23.760]  protection we're charging you under the USA Patriot Act as a terrorist they put
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:27.400]  out a warrant for his arrest it was in the news and the news got out and they
[1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:32.600]  dropped the charges for going and showing one oh it it's just trailers
[1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:39.440]  where people live he just showed one was by a big chemical plant and that the
[1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:43.440]  smoke was wafting over on them well they said that was showing infrastructure and
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:49.160]  so you see that's how they're gonna roll it out well people are starving people
[1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:52.040]  are rioting you know the bankers are trying to save us I mean we've built
[1:01:52.040 --> 1:01:54.880]  all these camps aren't you glad we built these camps for all these displaced
[1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:58.240]  people you know there's all these tense cities and all these people we can't
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:02.120]  have them in tense cities they don't have proper sanitation they you know if
[1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:05.240]  you're homeless or you're living out of your car you've and they're saying this
[1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:10.760]  you've got to go to one of these centers and we can't have crime on the camp you
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:14.080]  watch my film police at 2000 they condition the Marines that the public
[1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:18.400]  loves the camp so they hired hundreds of these Hollywood actors role players
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:26.000]  during the drill to scream I want in the camp I want in the camp but then some
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.200]  others would be I don't want in the camp and then they would say you've got to
[1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:32.960]  behave yourself when you're on the camp or you'll be put in the prison area of
[1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:37.240]  the camp and then the men have got to be in one area the women and the other
[1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:40.240]  because you can't have like the super dumb rapes and things going on so you're
[1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:44.640]  a prisoner on the camp but it's for your own safety and you're not allowed to
[1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:52.640]  leave the camp Google it was a bunch of stories a few years ago and still about
[1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:56.880]  people living on the FEMA camps around the country they're all over the nation
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:03.440]  not being allowed to leave the camp they're prisoners and then embassy
[1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:06.840]  international the ACLU got involved they said okay you can leave you just gotta
[1:03:06.840 --> 1:03:10.080]  be back at five but you're not allowed to have your own car at the camp so see
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:13.640]  we got to have order on the camp these Marines have all been running Abu
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:17.800]  Ghaib you know camps and camps and coasts of on everywhere else there you
[1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:22.480]  know they're used to it they're all acclimated they're all conditioned and
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:26.720]  then once they open the camps once they see people on remember since 86
[1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:29.680]  secretly federal presidents have been on these camps in the civilian and made
[1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:33.440]  labor camp program then it's like well what's the big deal Alex where do you
[1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:36.480]  think these people are gonna go society's breaking down so see they
[1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:41.120]  create a climate where it all seems reasonable see they have to sell this
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:45.080]  they were come out and say we're evil we're bad we're the bankers we've
[1:03:45.080 --> 1:03:47.800]  hijacked your nation and we're stealing everything and we've seized your
[1:03:47.800 --> 1:03:51.200]  government we're grabbing your roads and infrastructure and park lands and
[1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:56.200]  companies and and then for those that aren't homeless and living in the camps
[1:03:56.200 --> 1:03:59.440]  the work camps that they had the Great Depression but these will be prison
[1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:03.400]  camps it'll be well and for those of you that do have jobs you've got also work
[1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:07.480]  15 hours a week in community service to keep America going and if you don't
[1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:11.120]  serve you're a part of the problem and now as I predicted with Obama we're
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:17.360]  hearing that hey if you get against Obama's policies you are holding back
[1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:20.360]  the community you're holding back the society you're causing all this to
[1:04:20.360 --> 1:04:26.320]  happen so they need that mass movement that mass fascistic or slash communist
[1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:31.680]  Maoist movement with the youth a little blue Obama books mouths were red
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:36.360]  shaking them at people so they've got this mass movement now right as the
[1:04:36.360 --> 1:04:40.680]  crisis starts they'll get you out of it as long as you do everything they say

[1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:23.720]  camps will operate how they're going to induct the people into them how they're
[1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:29.000]  gonna publicly try to sell the population on going along with it this is a
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:33.880]  maximum alert here against tyranny ladies and gentlemen but today is our
[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:40.440]  first guest dovetails with this sadly Reverend Kevin Annette Kevin Daniel
[1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:46.880]  Annette he's written the hidden history hidden from history the Canadian
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:52.720]  Holocaust and you know about Native Americans in the US being taken to
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:56.000]  reservations being given smallpox blankets being hunted down being killed
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:59.880]  breaking up their families kidnapping their children if they didn't kill them
[1:08:59.880 --> 1:09:03.880]  if they were lucky I guess sending them to boarding schools were mysteriously
[1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:10.000]  most of them would end up dying it's eugenics and that's continued right
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:14.840]  through to today George Bush ran the eugenics program when he was working
[1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:20.640]  for Nixon and 40 plus percent of the Native American women on reservations
[1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:26.760]  were sterilized they would just go in for medical checkups but it's also going
[1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:30.160]  on in Canada so you don't think this can go on institutions and abuses don't go
[1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:33.200]  on by design these government institutions you got another thing
[1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:39.880]  coming an infrastructure protection under the family planning which is all
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:44.680]  eugenics under all of this they're carrying out these operations so he've
[1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:52.080]  got him on to break down what's happening up there and how he discovered
[1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:58.800]  just one area one little microcosm he was in and what he saw Kevin good to
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:04.360]  have you here with us hi Alex it's good to have me here tell us about yourself
[1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:09.680]  and then just boil it down for people what you witnessed well when I was
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:12.840]  ordained as the United Church minister that now the United Church is the
[1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:16.480]  largest Protestant church in Canada it was actually set up by the government
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:21.720]  of Canada in 1925 and with the government they jointly ran these I don't
[1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:25.960]  even like to call them residential schools they were internment camps we
[1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:29.080]  know that half the children died in them so it's it's a misnomer to call them
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:32.440]  schools but when I got ordained into the United
[1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:35.880]  Church one of my first postings was out on the west coast of Vancouver Island
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:38.920]  a place called Porto Bernie which had really been the center of the whole
[1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:44.720]  missionary invasion that happened there in the late 1800s and my first week on
[1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:48.720]  the job I encountered native people who began talking to me about children
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:53.240]  friends of theirs who had been killed in the local Albany residential school that
[1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:58.040]  was run by my church at the time the United Church so I you know in a nutshell
[1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:01.200]  what I did as I began to look into that I invited people to come into the church
[1:11:01.200 --> 1:11:06.000]  I had an open pulpit policy so people could get up and talk and we began to
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:10.160]  hear more of these stories and when I took it to the church authorities at the
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:15.280]  time this would have been in 1992 to 94 before any of the lawsuits had begun the
[1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:18.080]  church's position was basically they're all lying they're making it up don't
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:21.640]  listen to them and I was warned in no uncertain terms that you know I had
[1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:26.040]  better stop looking into this stuff well what brought things to a head was after
[1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:31.320]  being on the job for a couple of years that I'd swelled my congregation to about
[1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:35.760]  100 people from the 20 it was when I got there one of the things I began to
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:39.160]  find out is that there was a whole history of land theft the churches had
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:43.960]  been in Canada they were given vast acreages by the by the government the
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:49.440]  crown in Canada they claim to own all the land and so they parceled out native
[1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:53.440]  land to various churches and these churches would then sell it off to
[1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:57.120]  various corporate benefactors in this case the big logging company including
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:02.240]  wire houses in the American multinational logging company they got all of this
[1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:04.960]  native land through the United Church so I found out about that and I wrote a
[1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:09.000]  letter about it and I was fired within four weeks of doing that without charge
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:14.200]  without cause or notice or anything when it's always the same they yeah they
[1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:20.600]  say oh we're we're giving in trust all this native land to this church which was
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:24.200]  chartered by the government it is the government yeah so it all looks good in
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:27.280]  the press and as soon as people aren't looking they hand it over to private
[1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:30.040]  entries just like the phony environmental groups here in Austin
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:33.800]  stealing everybody's land and then two three years later building malls on it
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:39.080]  has so again this is our favorite scam and just today I'm covering how they've
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:46.160]  got 26,000 preachers as part of a secret clergy response team now public who are
[1:12:46.160 --> 1:12:50.480]  preparing to tell the American people to go to similar camps so they've done this
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:54.000]  over and over again please continue well that's the thing Alex that's a very
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.880]  important point because the in Canada especially that there is no separation of
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:01.440]  church and state there's a church and government have been working hand in
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:04.760]  glove with private interest right from the beginning under the guise of bringing
[1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:08.880]  education and you know quote civilization to the native people it was a huge
[1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:13.880]  land theft operation and they have their their puppet chiefs and they're helping
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:19.120]  them sees the land that and you know signed bogus treaties the reality is that
[1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:23.080]  it's a history of genocide that's continuing and I began to experience
[1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:26.640]  that in a real way in Porto Bernie I didn't close the door I open it up more
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:30.880]  and more to these survivors of this of this genocide and when I wrote the
[1:13:30.880 --> 1:13:34.160]  letter about the land deal that had gone on between the United Church and a
[1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:39.080]  company called Macmillan Blodell which was bought up by wirehouser when I
[1:13:39.080 --> 1:13:42.080]  exposed that corporate church connection you know I was shown the door
[1:13:42.080 --> 1:13:46.320]  very quickly but what happened in the years following that really the church
[1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:50.360]  went out of their way to try to destroy my life they went to my wife and offered
[1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:55.040]  to help pay for her divorce if she would leave me which she did and she got
[1:13:55.040 --> 1:13:58.680]  custody of her two daughters they systematically preventing me from
[1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:01.640]  getting work they blocked my doctoral degree I was studying for at the
[1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:06.600]  University of British Columbia because I was continuing to give a forum and a
[1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:10.320]  voice to survivors of survivors of the residential schools in the year
[1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:14.560]  two after I was fired I began to get invited to gatherings in downtown
[1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:18.720]  Vancouver where I'd been working for a number of years as the street minister
[1:14:18.720 --> 1:14:22.600]  and people began to tell stories survivors of things that went way beyond
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:27.200]  the sexual and physical assault that have been reported in the media you know
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:30.800]  people were describing sterilization programs having witnessed murders
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:34.600]  pedophile networks that are still operating in the native world involving
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:38.440]  very high-powered politicians all of these things coming out so we began to
[1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:43.560]  document this we held a tribunal in 1998 I published two books about it and
[1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:48.000]  finally the art film Unrepentant which came out a couple years ago and it was
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:52.920]  all you know I'm pretty obviously in response to this the government last
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:56.760]  year was forced to start acknowledging that children had died on mass you know
[1:14:56.760 --> 1:15:00.080]  in their tens of thousands in these in these schools in these death camps
[1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:04.080]  really so it's really been a process of persistence and just allowing the
[1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:07.800]  survivors to continue to speak and finding the documentation which supports
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:11.480]  them I was able to and we'll get into that documentation for those that don't
[1:15:11.480 --> 1:15:16.720]  know yeah I have a stack of mainstream Canadian papers admitting that large
[1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:22.320]  portions of the children just died so it's on record now another testament to
[1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:28.360]  you over more than a decade fighting and losing almost everything you had but in
[1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:33.120]  the end exposing this evil so hopefully they can't continue carrying it out at
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:37.480]  least the level they were and by the way something else I didn't mention to
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:44.040]  listeners today it's coming up later we have been threatened by Larry Silverstein
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:49.360]  directly by his people to shut up and I'm gonna just say something we're not
[1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:53.480]  shutting up about anything we're committed to humanity and I put it all in
[1:15:53.480 --> 1:15:58.200]  God's hands and and no matter what happens to me no matter if people
[1:15:58.200 --> 1:16:03.600]  destroy me set me up or if or God forbid a bolt of lightning strikes me you know I
[1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:07.800]  put my life in God's hands I know you've done that Reverend and I just want to say
[1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:12.880]  folks we are going in against classic tyranny that is radically expanding right
[1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:17.440]  now so later I'll get more into some new developments there so they are
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:22.000]  persecuting all of us that's why we all need your support but to continue let's
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:26.320]  specifically get in to what they now admit was going on and the same thing
[1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:30.600]  again is going on with the Aborigines in Australia the same thing happening
[1:16:30.600 --> 1:16:34.680]  with the natives here in the United States but now the systems they used on
[1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:38.080]  the natives are to be used against everyone that's what the social services
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:43.440]  is that's what this whole grid is go ahead well one of the things that I
[1:16:43.440 --> 1:16:46.560]  found out over the last three or four years was that it was clear that there
[1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:51.880]  was a whole systematic campaign to target this genocide of the children the
[1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:55.680]  government acknowledged last year that the death rate was between 40 and 60
[1:16:55.680 --> 1:16:59.880]  percent every year for up to half a century in the first half of the 20th
[1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:03.480]  century this death rate didn't decrease at all and one of the reasons that didn't
[1:17:03.480 --> 1:17:06.440]  is there was a plan of germ warfare really where they would take children
[1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:10.320]  who are healthy and house them in dorms where children were dying of tuberculosis
[1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:15.000]  and they're never treating them and people the kids would be dying on mass
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:19.880]  now just like this game just like to ski a huh yeah very similar and it was
[1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:23.200]  clearly a means of depopulating areas of the country that they wanted to open up
[1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:27.400]  to settlement to you know grabbing the resources and that kind of thing because
[1:17:27.400 --> 1:17:31.840]  these native groups still occupy very lucrative resources the timber the
[1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:36.240]  fisheries the minerals and the water of course and in British Columbia provides
[1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:40.880]  a quarter of all freshwater in North America and you know this is clearly
[1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:44.160]  they were they're aiming for that for that reason but what the government is
[1:17:44.160 --> 1:17:47.720]  saying now they're saying well yeah a lot of these children died but it wasn't
[1:17:47.720 --> 1:17:51.080]  intentional they're saying they died because of underfunding there wasn't a
[1:17:51.080 --> 1:17:54.960]  malicious intent that is totally absurd to think that a death rate can continue
[1:17:54.960 --> 1:17:58.400]  that long without there being a an intent behind and they have manuals on how
[1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:04.320]  to do this with CPS is five times more dangerous than any other group even
[1:18:04.320 --> 1:18:08.600]  other government custody when they're killing children here in the US or
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:12.960]  England they say oh we are doing a bad job we need more funding then they get
[1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:16.800]  more funding and the death expands mm-hmm well that's the thing you know
[1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:21.600]  when you have a system of genocide really it's never turned off the only
[1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:24.480]  reason that stopped in Nazi Germany is they were defeated in a war but the
[1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:28.040]  winner that you know the perpetrators of this genocide are still in power and
[1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:32.480]  that's why Hitler in my comp thanked the eugenicist in the US and England he
[1:18:32.480 --> 1:18:37.120]  learned everything from the United States and was funded by the Rockefeller
[1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:41.680]  Foundation that is on record mainline history that's right and in fact we
[1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:47.080]  found you know in over the years interviewing native kids it's clear
[1:18:47.080 --> 1:18:51.720]  that in the period after the war under project paperclip they were bringing
[1:18:51.720 --> 1:18:55.520]  over nazi doctors and a number of them were working on children in in the
[1:18:55.520 --> 1:19:00.600]  Indian hospitals perform in various experiments and operating the
[1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:04.000]  sterilization program than that so we know that there's definitely a that's
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:07.920]  on record the United States Canada and England fought it's in my film in game
[1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:12.480]  fought over the eugenicist scientists because they had a large pool of German
[1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:16.840]  scientists and doctors who would do this and then those Nazis trained cadres of
[1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:21.760]  Canadian British and US doctors to carry it out on a mass scale that's right I mean
[1:19:21.760 --> 1:19:26.800]  there it was really the same program on both sides of the Atlantic and what one
[1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:30.080]  of the differences you see in the way it happened in Canada compared to the US is
[1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:33.080]  the churches were really at the helm of this whole thing from the beginning
[1:19:33.080 --> 1:19:36.960]  there's evidence that the government tried to shut down the residential schools
[1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:40.240]  but time and again the Catholic and Anglican and United Churches pressured
[1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:45.520]  them to keep them open right up to the 1990s stay there let's talk about what
[1:19:45.520 --> 1:19:50.560]  some attesticides into the new crypto eugenics how they're running that off
[1:19:50.560 --> 1:19:56.040]  against free humanity we have committed to fight the darkness if God be with us

[1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:18.520]  there continue to spread the word
[1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:31.200]  Reverend Kevin Annette you know reading what Hitler wrote reading what
[1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:36.520]  Herbals wrote they marveled and bought all these history books about the tactics
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:41.240]  they bought the army war college tactics used against the Native Americans
[1:24:41.240 --> 1:24:44.560]  that was their plan to go into the rest of Europe in the world and
[1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:49.080]  systematically put people on reservations then exterminate them the
[1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:54.160]  model for the US camps for the Indians was taken from the British who invented
[1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:57.760]  the concentration camp and used it of course at a great effect in the
[1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:01.280]  Revolutionary War where Andrew Jackson who then used it against Indians
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:06.320]  himself about being abused and abusing others his mother and brother died in
[1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:11.040]  British concentration camp he then used it against the natives but the point
[1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:15.760]  here is Hitler used that exact program for living space that was their
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:20.160]  operation so eugenics grew out of that as well it's all the same thing over and
[1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:23.320]  over again we're going into the camp economy but now the international
[1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:27.800]  bankers are fully colonizing the United States and bankrupting the old system to
[1:25:27.800 --> 1:25:30.640]  fully bring in a tyranny against everyone so everything that's been done to
[1:25:30.640 --> 1:25:35.200]  the natives is now going to be done against you sir continuum let's get
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:38.000]  into some of the particular stories you cover in your two books give folks your
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:42.400]  website about how they would kill these children how they would sterilize them
[1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:46.240]  what children they would decide not to kill was that the ones that they were
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:49.600]  using for sex slavery it's always the same the UN's been caught all over
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:52.920]  Africa Asia Latin America doing the same thing thousands of mainstream
[1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:57.760]  articles it's it's a class of sickos and they hire new people and then as they
[1:25:57.760 --> 1:26:02.080]  die they hire new people and it's a sick culture and they've grown this hoard
[1:26:02.080 --> 1:26:08.080]  this army of darkness they've got worldwide well yeah I agree the first of
[1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:13.120]  all my website is triple w dot hidden from history dot org and on that it's
[1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:17.720]  really a lot of the documentation of the past 12 years or so stories you know
[1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:22.560]  that I began to hear as a minister like one of the first things I began to hear
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:26.280]  was how children were being systematically bought and sold in these
[1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:29.680]  schools and how it carries on today because that you know as you know in any
[1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:34.120]  system of of abuse those who abuse become abusers and has passed down
[1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:38.200]  intergenerationally we know today that Vancouver is actually one of the main
[1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:41.840]  centers of child prostitution of pornography in the world along with
[1:26:41.840 --> 1:26:45.760]  Rotterdam Bangkok and places like that there's international sex rings that
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:48.760]  operate and a lot of the kids that are still being used are from northern
[1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:53.200]  native reserves and it's always been like that with orphanages not just death
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:58.680]  camp orphanages and that's what the CPS is today grabbing children go ahead
[1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:03.560]  well yeah and these are very well-protected rings we know that
[1:27:03.560 --> 1:27:07.080]  there are even Supreme Court judges and in British Columbia there's politicians
[1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:12.040]  fairly wealthy bankers that are directly involved with church lawyers and
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:16.800]  others in these networks to continue we've come very close to exposing this
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:20.160]  on occasion people who were eyewitnesses to this have actually disappeared
[1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:25.480]  there's over 500 missing Aboriginal women in Vancouver alone a lot of the
[1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:30.120]  work I do is on the streets and that in the poor parts of Vancouver and these
[1:27:30.120 --> 1:27:33.280]  people who are living on the street about 80% of the homeless are Aboriginal
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:36.440]  they're all refugees from their own lands because they've been forced off their
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:39.640]  own lands by their own chiefs who sign these deals with big multinationals
[1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:44.000]  and terrorize their own people off their land so when you look at the history of
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.920]  these chiefs that are doing that in the residential schools they were the young
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:50.960]  kids who would rap on their fellow students they would inform on the on the
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:54.240]  kids when they're speaking their language and they were rewarded called out if
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:58.480]  you like and and given an education trained to serve the system and they're
[1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:01.120]  still doing that today
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:04.240]  and that's what barack obama is you know these poor black folks think he's gonna
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:07.000]  save them i mean it's the oldest trick in the book for the establishment to go
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.040]  higher
[1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:11.440]  a uh... jude scott just like they would hire chiefs and people
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:15.640]  that's it it's the same system it is the system of of uh... evil
[1:28:15.640 --> 1:28:18.720]  and we find out all over the world like the british empire did this to my people
[1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:19.560]  in ireland
[1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:23.440]  um... it's the the crown in the church working together to create a slave
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:24.560]  population
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:27.080]  uh... and you know what's that what
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:29.960]  some of the chiefs here are now learning like people all over the world of
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:30.960]  learned is that
[1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:34.120]  you the only way to fight that is to declare sovereignty from it i mean you
[1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:36.160]  folks in america had to do it against britain
[1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:38.360]  we're gonna have to do the same thing here in canada
[1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:41.480]  uh... and that's what some of the chiefs and others are beginning to do
[1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:44.800]  uh... there was a little less when your parliament and continue notice when
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:46.120]  your parliament
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:49.680]  uh... which was elected said we're gonna kick out your current
[1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:53.080]  prime minister the queen just came in and did veto and show everybody she really
[1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:54.280]  still runs it
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:57.200]  well it's exactly it in australia the same thing happened in nineteen seventy
[1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:00.360]  fifty governor general remove the government and uh... put in another
[1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:00.960]  one
[1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:03.760]  uh... it's a colonial system and we still live under that's one of them is the
[1:29:03.760 --> 1:29:06.720]  same thing and continue but we're gonna come back but
[1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:08.840]  i've got a nexus this in
[1:29:08.840 --> 1:29:11.440]  through three and a half months ago congress wouldn't pass the banker
[1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:14.320]  immunity takeover bill so they were threatened with martial law and war
[1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:16.920]  powers act was declared bloomberg reported
[1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:19.960]  so let's go under that now to circle ahead
[1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:23.400]  blatant canada because it's run by the crown in the church the churches are
[1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:25.080]  immune for prosecution
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:27.920]  it's been proven that the they murdered tens of thousands of children
[1:29:27.920 --> 1:29:29.600]  deliberately in these schools
[1:29:29.600 --> 1:29:33.240]  uh... and yet not one official has ever been brought to trial
[1:29:33.240 --> 1:29:36.240]  uh... for the death of a child in a residential school so they're immune for
[1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:37.240]  prosecution
[1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:39.960]  and you can do that because the crown in the church work together
[1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:43.520]  what we need to do in canada is to replace that system we need to stop
[1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:47.360]  the republican they call that one a stop all or immunity
[1:29:47.360 --> 1:29:51.360]  true criminals are in power and they have immunity
[1:29:51.360 --> 1:29:52.800]  we're on the march
[1:29:52.800 --> 1:29:55.240]  the empires on the run

[1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:25.320]  this town alone in cps he goes they will die that's just how it is they will die
[1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:28.440]  it's just kind of an attitude of kill them all at god's sort of out
[1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:31.960]  uh... please continue sir well that's exactly it i mean if you go to my
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:35.880]  website you'll see an interview with a woman called iran fable she's 75 now
[1:34:35.880 --> 1:34:39.480]  but she was a little girl in the 1940s and uh... in a catholic residential
[1:34:39.480 --> 1:34:44.200]  school and she describes and this was a cbc television broadcast last
[1:34:44.200 --> 1:34:48.600]  july she said that she stood in front of a furnace and watched a newborn baby
[1:34:48.600 --> 1:34:50.760]  being thrown into the furnace by a priest
[1:34:50.760 --> 1:34:54.120]  because it was a product of rape the priest of rape one of the young girls
[1:34:54.120 --> 1:34:56.840]  they took the baby and just threw it in the furnace
[1:34:56.840 --> 1:35:00.120]  we've had consulate uh... you know dozens of people describing
[1:35:00.120 --> 1:35:03.320]  that kind of thing happening so it isn't just children dying they're being
[1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:06.520]  deliberately murdered and uh... you know none of these people have ever
[1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:09.240]  been brought to trial and frankly we think the only way they're going to be
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:12.680]  brought to trial is if uh... original people set up their own courts people
[1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:15.160]  in in canada set up their own courts
[1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:18.680]  and and put the government church on trial because they're not okay with themselves
[1:35:18.680 --> 1:35:24.520]  you're saying the main three branches of state of pre-religion up there
[1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:28.440]  are involved in it i'm not trying to you know single out one group but but i
[1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:30.600]  want to know who the ringleaders are who is
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:34.120]  which group is most powerful uh... the uh...
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:37.960]  the the division you were in or was it the catholics who was it
[1:35:37.960 --> 1:35:41.240]  well ultimately this whole model of the residential schools was set up by the
[1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:45.400]  vatican in the 1880s uh... it's called the durier plan to to basically
[1:35:45.400 --> 1:35:48.120]  establish these these residential schools and the government and the
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:51.400]  protestant church is copied it and that was a modern version of what
[1:35:51.400 --> 1:35:52.840]  cortez did
[1:35:52.840 --> 1:35:55.800]  yeah exactly i mean the the buck stops with the vatican and the queen of
[1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:58.200]  england uh... she's the head of the church of england
[1:35:58.200 --> 1:36:01.000]  and those were the two churches that were the favored ones in canada
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:03.880]  the united church was a more recent creation by the government but it was
[1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:04.680]  set up
[1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:08.200]  clearly with the same plan so i mean all three of them are equally couple but
[1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:11.800]  ultimately you know this is a uh... this issue has to be taken to roman to
[1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:12.760]  london england
[1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:15.880]  because that's where all of this plan originated and it can
[1:36:15.880 --> 1:36:19.560]  continues to be well i mean look at what the catholic church is today
[1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:22.760]  i mean there's some estimates that half of them are pedophiles
[1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:27.480]  well the the uh... the the the the priest
[1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:30.360]  i mean this is just unbelievable uh... you know
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:33.800]  again i have the cbc news articles have a big stack of articles where they
[1:36:33.800 --> 1:36:34.760]  admit yeah
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:36.680]  forty to sixty percent of the children
[1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:39.320]  die in our custody but but we're good
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:43.400]  i mean imagine any other industry any other government any other
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:44.920]  i'm imagining of
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:45.920]  citizens
[1:36:45.920 --> 1:36:49.480]  half their children died it'd be like this band parenthood you know
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:52.520]  but instead the state and i have the textbooks they teach in england u.s. and
[1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:55.800]  canada they teach social workers the families of disease
[1:36:55.800 --> 1:36:58.440]  that has to be eradicated
[1:36:58.440 --> 1:37:00.280]  well you know it's amazing that that
[1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:03.480]  uh... it would have been amazing that they got over this crime because in
[1:37:03.480 --> 1:37:06.600]  canada you know the population is thought to think of themselves as subjects
[1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:10.040]  of the crown not as citizens but as subjects who kind of operate according
[1:37:10.040 --> 1:37:13.080]  to the whim of of of you know a few people in power
[1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:16.440]  and when you're raised in that way as slaves basically it's it's hard for
[1:37:16.440 --> 1:37:19.080]  people psychologically to challenge these churches in government
[1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:21.960]  oh i know i have canadians i have canadians
[1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:26.520]  email me when i'm reading the cbc or or uh... you know mainstream news saying
[1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:29.320]  the queen is in control she's exercised her governorship
[1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:31.880]  she is now basically overthrowing the government because they didn't do what
[1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:35.320]  she wanted and then like you said that they did it in australia
[1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:38.760]  a few decades ago i mean uh... and then they have all these
[1:37:38.760 --> 1:37:42.760]  tv shows acting like they have no power and then the canadian send me email
[1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:45.960]  saying you're making this up it isn't true we're in control of our own
[1:37:45.960 --> 1:37:49.480]  government go ahead well no it's clearly that
[1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:52.360]  people here aren't in control at all i mean to give you an example of that
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:55.560]  in british columbia the police don't have any independent power to lay charges
[1:37:55.560 --> 1:37:58.680]  it's the attorney general through the crown councils they're like district
[1:37:58.680 --> 1:38:02.520]  attorneys up here and the attorney general gets to decide who is charged and
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:06.280]  who isn't charged which means the party in power and in essence the crown
[1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:09.000]  can not decide to prosecute people can uh...
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.880]  urge the police to lay off people who are their friends
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:15.480]  i mean it's a completely top-down system of hierarchy and there's no real
[1:38:15.480 --> 1:38:18.520]  experience of democracy in canada well that's right
[1:38:18.520 --> 1:38:22.200]  you know that's why these crimes of genocide can be gotten away with
[1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:26.040]  so easily well yeah that's why you can uh... you could have a government
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:29.320]  official pushing the plunger down to blow up the world trade centers and
[1:38:29.320 --> 1:38:32.440]  the attorney general is not going to end item
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:35.480]  yeah and that kind of thing i mean you know the more i uncover it's like
[1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:38.360]  peeling back the onion skins it's like uh...
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:41.800]  each crime is even more unbelievable in the first and
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:44.520]  to give another example like in these indian hospitals
[1:38:44.520 --> 1:38:48.120]  um... they were having uh... some of these nazi doctors we found
[1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:52.520]  documentation showing that under the mk ultra program they were using
[1:38:52.520 --> 1:38:56.280]  uh... you know in the in the mind-controlled experiments funded by the CIA
[1:38:56.280 --> 1:38:59.160]  they were doing that for over fifty years here in canada with children from
[1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:00.120]  orphanages
[1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:01.640]  residential schools
[1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:05.000]  tens of thousands of these kids died alone in there that was a doctor
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:10.200]  ewing cameron ran a facility that held four thousand people at one time
[1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:13.880]  and they would uh... cps white kids black kids uh...
[1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:17.560]  uh... you know native american matter and ship them to canada and canada
[1:39:17.560 --> 1:39:21.880]  uh... in three different major bases was the main and this is all declassified
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:23.560]  it's on mainstream tv folks
[1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:27.160]  well do you understand this is who we're dealing with please continue
[1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:30.040]  and you're not just saying paper clipper mk ultra
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:32.920]  uh... i mean this is all real tell them
[1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:36.520]  well yeah and and it there is that history that's been documented but what
[1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:38.840]  people don't see it like there's kind of an attitude of
[1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:41.560]  well that all ended in the eighties you know and we're much better now we're
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:42.760]  looking at all this stuff
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:46.040]  but it isn't true at all it just goes underground it goes it starts operating
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:47.160]  in different ways
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:50.760]  uh... one of the things that we found out is that a number of these hospitals
[1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:54.920]  are still operating and uh... they're still doing the same kinds of programs
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:39:55.640]  there's
[1:39:55.640 --> 1:39:59.080]  the in the mancouver what the police regularly do is they go and scoop a lot
[1:39:59.080 --> 1:40:01.640]  of homeless people off the street and they simply disappear
[1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:04.440]  you never see them again that happened to a number of people i know
[1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:07.800]  and uh... we know it happens to Aboriginal women they're targeted
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:08.680]  uh...
[1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:11.640]  you know one of the things we've established is that there's
[1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:14.920]  uh... you know the whole organ trafficking and snuff film industry
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:18.600]  utilizes a lot of native people on the west coast of canada
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:21.080]  and that's where a lot of these disappeared women and children are going
[1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:22.120]  you know into that
[1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:25.480]  and there's a lot of collusion especially with bodywork the rcmp
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:29.000]  and the police in that
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:30.520]  you're absolutely right
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:32.360]  man i tell you
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:33.600]  it is just
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:36.800]  it is just off the charts bad
[1:40:36.800 --> 1:40:39.960]  uh...
[1:40:39.960 --> 1:40:40.880]  you know
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:44.000]  it's not a feeling of powerlessness because i'm here on the air
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.920]  speaking to millions of people you you've got a radio show in canada you
[1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:48.320]  know you've written books
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:52.000]  and you've done some good you know but but imagine the good would be done if
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:53.120]  more people
[1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:54.800]  would have been as aggressive
[1:40:54.800 --> 1:40:56.200]  as you've been reverend
[1:40:56.200 --> 1:40:58.120]  we wouldn't have this and that's a
[1:40:58.120 --> 1:41:01.880]  it philosophers and historians a set of million times in different ways
[1:41:01.880 --> 1:41:06.280]  that all the evil needs to triumph and win is the good people do nothing
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:08.720]  and i'm going to tell you listeners
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:10.520]  i'm sorry i'm
[1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:14.240]  well you know i do when i did this it was step by step i just uh...
[1:41:14.240 --> 1:41:17.040]  you know it started for me by the the church officials saying look you've
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:20.080]  got to close this food bank stop letting native people speak from your
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:21.120]  pulpit well
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:23.720]  there's no way i would close the food bank on three hundred hungry native
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:26.320]  families in the middle of winter i mean i just couldn't do that in my
[1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:27.320]  conscience
[1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:30.560]  and uh... once you follow your conscience and and not what people are
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:33.400]  telling you to do it leads you eventually to this but
[1:41:33.400 --> 1:41:36.560]  i had to look at myself in the mirror every day and there's no way uh...
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:37.720]  they didn't
[1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:40.960]  there was the expectation that i would simply cooperate and then close the
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:44.920]  door and turn a blind eye to all of it all these crimes that were still
[1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:45.720]  happening
[1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:46.760]  and um...
[1:41:46.760 --> 1:41:49.360]  you know all my colleagues were were funny in the way to do that and i
[1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:50.800]  simply couldn't do it so
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:53.280]  i i i don't think that anyone of conscience would have acted any
[1:41:53.280 --> 1:41:54.280]  differently but
[1:41:54.280 --> 1:41:58.120]  for some reason in canada specially there's a fear of confronting these
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:01.120]  churches as if they have something to do with god which i don't believe they
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:03.240]  do
[1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:04.760]  absolutely
[1:42:04.760 --> 1:42:07.800]  i am
[1:42:07.800 --> 1:42:09.960]  i don't even know what to say
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:11.400]  i do my research
[1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:16.240]  reverend all i do is research all i i can't even go to sleep at night now
[1:42:16.240 --> 1:42:19.120]  and i have nightmares when i am asleep
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:22.840]  because i know it's all real i know what's happening
[1:42:22.840 --> 1:42:26.160]  uh... you know one example
[1:42:26.160 --> 1:42:28.960]  back in nineteen ninety nine
[1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:32.480]  we were doing a lot of local tv programs on them grabbing poor people's
[1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:34.440]  children and it would be a
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:36.880]  man and a woman
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:38.800]  and they would be poor
[1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:41.760]  and they don't know when they go to quote get the free welfare birth at the
[1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:44.480]  city hospital that they take their children
[1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:47.800]  especially over white because they can get like
[1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:50.120]  close to half a million bucks for an adoption
[1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:52.400]  yes those children are blessed in a way they don't get taken for medical
[1:42:52.400 --> 1:42:53.480]  experiments or
[1:42:53.480 --> 1:42:56.680]  like the other minority kids they hop up on drugs because they get more federal
[1:42:56.680 --> 1:42:58.360]  funds for that
[1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:00.480]  is the evils built into the system
[1:43:00.480 --> 1:43:02.880]  but but i couldn't do it anymore i
[1:43:02.880 --> 1:43:05.920]  i couldn't go down to the hospitals and people called me
[1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:08.360]  because it was always the same
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:12.040]  special units of pedophile police you know that look that nailiness that the
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:15.800]  the you know the the six mile it's like a certain demon i don't know how to
[1:43:15.800 --> 1:43:19.000]  describe it you know the empty the the m o you see a cop
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:21.840]  change in attire he's a tough guy great guy family
[1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:24.480]  he's out there just doing a job you know most of cops aren't bad
[1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:26.600]  you see him that's a normal guy you can tell
[1:43:26.600 --> 1:43:28.600]  you know with these guys if you've been around them enough it's always the
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:30.400]  pedophile cps
[1:43:30.400 --> 1:43:35.040]  sickos it's always the pedophile cops it always be the same cops
[1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:39.560]  uh... or they look the same it's like a it's it's it's it's they could be black
[1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:43.240]  or white they have the same look the same eyes the same smile they enjoy the
[1:43:43.240 --> 1:43:45.040]  woman screaming and begging
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:48.120]  as they take the baby they always go in and say sign this form you keep your
[1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:48.760]  baby
[1:43:48.760 --> 1:43:51.680]  they signed the form of the form agrees to give their baby up
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:54.200]  uh... they would say well because you're poor and because your husband's an
[1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:55.360]  auto mechanic
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:58.480]  and uh... you're living in a uh... week-to-week hotel and they're like but
[1:43:58.480 --> 1:44:00.400]  my sister's coming with money

[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:05.240]  taking it
[1:44:05.240 --> 1:44:08.840]  and then you go to the court case and the cps is so lazy
[1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:12.360]  date uh... it's a newborn baby this is one case
[1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:15.040]  they took a case of a three-year-old child
[1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:17.760]  who had been abused by someone under another name
[1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:19.760]  and just copied the text
[1:44:19.760 --> 1:44:23.240]  and change their name at the top with different circumstances
[1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:26.480]  and the judge just didn't care and took the child the family wasn't you know
[1:44:26.480 --> 1:44:28.720]  didn't know how to fight it they they'd waived
[1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:32.000]  uh... but but you know i mean they don't even fill out the forms right there
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:32.960]  isn't even
[1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:34.800]  uh... any due process
[1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:37.520]  and they they enjoy as the mother
[1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:40.000]  has her soul being torn out they enjoy
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:44.360]  uh... the the uh... howling and and and there i am like a literal
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:47.520]  fiery laser beam burning out my soul
[1:44:47.520 --> 1:44:51.560]  uh... in just anguish in torment watching her torment
[1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:54.720]  and i'm literally about to hit my knees but i'm not crying
[1:44:54.720 --> 1:44:57.520]  and i'm knowing that if i assault these people i'm gonna go to prison they're
[1:44:57.520 --> 1:44:58.960]  gonna have their way with me
[1:44:58.960 --> 1:45:03.640]  and i'm sitting there watching them feed like demonic entities as the babies
[1:45:03.640 --> 1:45:04.880]  being taken
[1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:08.520]  and how they're smiling i mean damn them to hell
[1:45:08.520 --> 1:45:10.320]  uh...
[1:45:10.320 --> 1:45:13.400]  well i know i see this all the time too and it's like uh...
[1:45:13.400 --> 1:45:15.320]  if it's a sickness that's spreading
[1:45:15.320 --> 1:45:16.920]  you know uh... and
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:18.880]  we have to somehow find a way
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:22.400]  to encourage people of goodwill to confront that and
[1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:26.120]  that's a big job just getting people to find the courage and to do that
[1:45:26.120 --> 1:45:27.080]  uh...
[1:45:27.080 --> 1:45:30.720]  but i mean i don't do it i can't do it anymore i can cover on the air dot i
[1:45:30.720 --> 1:45:34.120]  can barely have these women and men on just hearing it is the flashbacks
[1:45:34.120 --> 1:45:37.560]  how the people like you constantly live in this and watch them ripping the
[1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:38.600]  innocent apart
[1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:42.600]  how do you watch the murders how do you watch him hurting children
[1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:44.120]  well how do you do it
[1:45:44.120 --> 1:45:46.440]  you find other people who are willing to
[1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:49.200]  peek out and fight back and you know a lot of people i work with
[1:45:49.200 --> 1:45:51.400]  their homeless native men and women
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:54.920]  you know they may have nothing but they have the integrity to get up and we
[1:45:54.920 --> 1:45:57.720]  stand outside these churches and we confront these people going in and
[1:45:57.720 --> 1:45:58.640]  they look
[1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:01.080]  you gotta you go
[1:46:01.080 --> 1:46:04.720]  take a stand here and they their courage helps me and my courage helps them
[1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:07.400]  you know if we do this together we don't do it on our own so it is the
[1:46:07.400 --> 1:46:08.480]  brotherhood
[1:46:08.480 --> 1:46:11.000]  sisterly and i find that all the time i
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.880]  you know i'm encouraged by them all the time i find the strength of the roots
[1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:15.160]  i don't find it you know
[1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:18.920]  uh... it's not going to come from uh... the government or anybody that is weak
[1:46:18.920 --> 1:46:20.520]  evil powers week
[1:46:20.520 --> 1:46:23.720]  he's very good other sick
[1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:26.120]  you know i've seen how people feel from this to like
[1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:29.400]  one of the guys i work with he's a severe alcohol because he was tortured on
[1:46:29.400 --> 1:46:32.120]  a rack they had in this Catholic residential school they had actually a
[1:46:32.120 --> 1:46:33.280]  rack set up
[1:46:33.280 --> 1:46:36.360]  where they were tortured kids and uh... he's never been able to talk about it
[1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:40.240]  but one day uh... last Easter actually we went into a Catholic mass just stood
[1:46:40.240 --> 1:46:42.240]  there very quietly and nonviolently
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:45.400]  with a banner and it said all the children need a proper burial
[1:46:45.400 --> 1:46:48.680]  and we walked out of there and the whole congregation stood up in respect as
[1:46:48.680 --> 1:46:49.720]  we walked out
[1:46:49.720 --> 1:46:52.200]  because they were acknowledging i mean the priests were very angry at us but
[1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:54.120]  they were all welcoming us
[1:46:54.120 --> 1:46:57.120]  when we got out of the church uh... william this man who had gone through the
[1:46:57.120 --> 1:46:59.080]  school
[1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:01.800]  there was a light in his eye had never seen before in the next day he stopped
[1:47:01.800 --> 1:47:04.000]  drinking for the first time in eighteen years
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:07.440]  you know because he felt the power he was able to find his voice and act and
[1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:10.040]  in confront these guys and that was his healing
[1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:13.520]  and you know that's the way we do it we do a public and we do it together
[1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:16.680]  uh... otherwise you know they they thrive off the fact that we feel isolated
[1:47:16.680 --> 1:47:18.320]  demoralized and alone
[1:47:18.320 --> 1:47:21.000]  but we have to break through that all the time
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:23.480]  knowledge is power you know you are people with knowledge
[1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:27.920]  and you just be out there where they're suffering and you carry it on i mean
[1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:31.480]  we do that together
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:37.400]  absolutely i mean for people who haven't seen this uh...
[1:47:37.400 --> 1:47:42.080]  it's it's just unspeakable
[1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:45.960]  and societies imploding because all this evil's in control and so there is bad
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:48.800]  stuff happening in families there are bad people individually doing things as
[1:47:48.800 --> 1:47:49.560]  well
[1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:51.920]  in the establishment publicize is all of that
[1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:55.080]  to make the people look bad but make the system look good
[1:47:55.080 --> 1:47:58.260]  uh... but from what you're saying it it it looks like we
[1:47:58.260 --> 1:48:01.800]  you've had some progress it's been in the news that you admit this is going on
[1:48:01.800 --> 1:48:04.680]  what is it turned into what are they currently doing how they try to
[1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:05.880]  camouflage it
[1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:08.200]  well they're spinning at that they're finally they're taking a lot of the
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:11.560]  information i haven't been in it to make it look like they knew all this along
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:14.360]  and they're they're disclosing that now and they're admitting and they need more
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:15.480]  funding
[1:48:15.480 --> 1:48:18.840]  yeah and and they're they're saying basically we've given apologies and
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:22.700]  some financial compensation now the issue is resolved with the apology
[1:48:22.700 --> 1:48:26.360]  issue is resolved at which is ridiculous because on the street
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:29.360]  people are suffering more they're dying at a higher rate from that
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:31.960]  you know they get a bit of money in compensation and people go in an
[1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:34.800]  overdose on drugs with that money and that's intentional
[1:48:34.800 --> 1:48:37.600]  you know uh...
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:39.920]  the government of churches are making it look like
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:41.300]  you know it's amazing what they've done
[1:48:41.300 --> 1:48:43.440]  they've committed the crime they've gotten away with it and now they're
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:44.240]  coming from
[1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:46.800]  trying to make themselves look good in the process
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:48.880]  uh... and they're not uh...
[1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:51.560]  you see they're not disclosing anything so it's almost like they're saying there
[1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:53.640]  was a big crime but there are no criminals
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:57.760]  uh... so we've been pushing for years to get them to admit where these
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:00.480]  children are buried we've been trying to bring the children to remain so for
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:01.840]  proper burial
[1:49:01.840 --> 1:49:05.320]  having memorial site and bringing people to trial for these crimes
[1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:08.120]  so that's really what we're pushing and the perfect that the prime minister
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:10.360]  would be forced to acknowledge this in parliament
[1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:13.600]  and party leaders were actually getting up and talking about these gravesite
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:17.400]  i mean that's an amazing accomplishment by the way every few weeks i see a new
[1:49:17.400 --> 1:49:20.200]  article out of florida or texas or new york
[1:49:20.200 --> 1:49:23.680]  yet where they go into orphanages and they got a bunch of dead bodies i mean
[1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:25.800]  this is a key this is a guild
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:27.400]  this is a this is a
[1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:30.240]  this is a satan worshipping whatever you want to call it even if they don't
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:33.720]  physically worship satan that's what the the vibe is
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:34.840]  the spirit is
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:38.880]  who want to feed on innocence and it's a hundred degrees from who i am i don't
[1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:39.920]  even claim to be
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:41.240]  the best person in the world
[1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:44.800]  but the point is it i i've got this i love children i love their innocence i
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:47.840]  want to protect them how could you want to hurt a child
[1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:49.920]  i just want to kill these people
[1:49:49.920 --> 1:49:53.360]  yeah well i mean it's kind of like both extremes are happening at the same time
[1:49:53.360 --> 1:49:56.160]  alex the exposures happening people more where now
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:49:58.840]  and that evil is trying to trench itself all the more
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:02.640]  and with the reality of the institutions of their backs against the wall now
[1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:04.800]  they've admitted that they're trying to spin it
[1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:07.400]  but it's not going to work because more and more people are coming forward now
[1:50:07.400 --> 1:50:08.360]  with the truth
[1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:11.800]  and i'm actually very encouraged by what's happening you know that the power
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:13.280]  of just telling the truth
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:16.640]  uh... i i just want to remind people again to go to our site and look at our

[1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:34.160]  carry this on because i know that there's going to be better changes happening
[1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:36.960]  absolutely well it's hard for me and i'm sorry i've been
[1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:40.480]  been whining just to even focus in on this because uh... but but but your
[1:50:40.480 --> 1:50:41.600]  strength
[1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:44.560]  i can feel your strength and i agree with you it is the fact that you know you're

[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:14.760]  prison planet dot com new legislation authorizes FEMA camps
[1:54:14.760 --> 1:54:18.920]  in the u.s. why is the story so important? you see we already know that
[1:54:18.920 --> 1:54:22.000]  they lay out the architecture of them how it's gonna work
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.440]  now they're gonna sell the public on it
[1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:26.840]  exactly as i said
[1:54:26.840 --> 1:54:28.720]  they would do and that's what the problem
[1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:31.720]  it just confirms my analysis is absolutely
[1:54:31.720 --> 1:54:36.360]  on this issue one hundred percent on all the way
[1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:38.160]  Reverend
[1:54:38.160 --> 1:54:41.080]  Kevin Annette is our guest
[1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:44.480]  check out his website check out the film they made he's got links to newscast
[1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:45.640]  admitting that he was right
[1:54:45.640 --> 1:54:48.320]  remember this guy a decade before they admitted it was true
[1:54:48.320 --> 1:54:50.400]  was out there fighting with the evil
[1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:54.360]  goes on but now they're there confronting him and letting these wicked devils know
[1:54:54.360 --> 1:54:56.960]  that the people are on to their crimes so they're trying to bring in a world
[1:54:56.960 --> 1:54:58.000]  government
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:01.040]  so they can carry out all their mass murder and torture of children
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:04.760]  and no one can stop them well we are going to stop them
[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:07.480]  okay sir you got about three four minutes left other key points you think we
[1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:09.200]  need to add here
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:12.760]  well i just think it's uh... important
[1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:16.440]  especially people in the states to know that uh... this is escalating this whole
[1:55:16.440 --> 1:55:18.520]  campaign because uh...
[1:55:18.520 --> 1:55:21.960]  recently a number of the chiefs including chief kaplan who's a west coast
[1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:23.400]  squamish native chief
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:24.400]  uh... has
[1:55:24.400 --> 1:55:27.560]  told his churches to get off his land he told the Catholic Anglican united
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:28.640]  churches that
[1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:31.640]  uh... they occupied his land illegally they've never paid him any rent for a
[1:55:31.640 --> 1:55:33.720]  hundred and fifty years so it's time they left
[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:36.120]  we issued eviction notices to these churches
[1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:40.400]  uh... and in response a lot of persecution began to come down
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:43.480]  i kind of joke with people sometimes i'm gonna have to take political asylum in
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:44.760]  the u s because it
[1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:46.480]  increasingly harder to operate
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:50.840]  here um... but one of the what what we've done we've thrown down the gauntlet
[1:55:50.840 --> 1:55:53.920]  we've said it's time to declare sovereignty from the crown in the churches
[1:55:53.920 --> 1:55:57.880]  take back our land native and non-native people can have to form an alliance in
[1:55:57.880 --> 1:56:00.920]  doing that to stop everything that you're talking about about the new world
[1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:03.520]  order and the growing global dictatorship
[1:56:03.520 --> 1:56:05.400]  the way we do that is by taking back
[1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:07.600]  what is dear to us and that's our own land
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:11.440]  uh... it's striking a chord in me because my own ancestors suffered this
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:13.440]  in the old country that's why we came over here
[1:56:13.440 --> 1:56:18.480]  uh... in order to kind of turn back the whole history of genocide we have to
[1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:20.200]  say now what can we do
[1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:24.160]  on this comment to create a new arrangement you know and uh... so this is
[1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:27.160]  what we're trying to do now we've we've issued eviction notices
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:29.560]  we declared sovereignty
[1:56:29.560 --> 1:56:32.880]  and we're trying to build a movement for a republic
[1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:36.240]  of ganata or canada which is the original name of candidate the mohawk
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:37.840]  word meaning our village
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:41.800]  and as part of that i'm uh... going on a speaking tour to try to raise awareness
[1:56:41.800 --> 1:56:43.440]  not only the genocide
[1:56:43.440 --> 1:56:47.200]  of the past but how it's continuing today and how we're trying to win back
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:50.800]  sovereignty and and challenges criminals you don't get an upper on courts to do
[1:56:50.800 --> 1:56:51.440]  it with
[1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:54.800]  uh... as the natives say get off our land we don't want your eugenics
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:57.280]  operation here masquerading as a church
[1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:00.080]  uh... let me guess the churches are still sitting there
[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:03.760]  that's right but uh... we did the chief actually went into the supreme court in
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:06.720]  issue uh... we've got a formal eviction notice
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:10.160]  we've issued this and we've actually tried to deputize the police to get them
[1:57:10.160 --> 1:57:11.760]  to enforce the eviction
[1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:15.200]  and uh... with this is growing moral pressure every time we go outside the
[1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:18.840]  church of the whole phalanx of police there to protect the church
[1:57:18.840 --> 1:57:21.880]  but the other day we're speaking to the police and they wouldn't look on our eyes
[1:57:21.880 --> 1:57:24.480]  they were looking down on the way they knew we were on the right
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:27.960]  and uh... you can see that we're winning the moral victory here
[1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:31.640]  and and that the church is hiding behind a lot of power money they always do
[1:57:31.640 --> 1:57:32.320]  but
[1:57:32.320 --> 1:57:35.720]  if it's breaking down you can see a spiritual battle going on if you like
[1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:37.080]  over the truth
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:40.200]  and so we're really encouraged by this and uh... i just wanted to give people
[1:57:40.200 --> 1:57:43.800]  my personal email for them to contact me if they want to help us with it
[1:57:43.800 --> 1:57:46.560]  it's hidden from history at yahoo dot c a
[1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:50.040]  and i'm planning to be down in the states in march
[1:57:50.040 --> 1:57:53.680]  and look what you've done by yourself joining with the native peoples will
[1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:57.000]  it's just another example of what we can all do and so many of you are those
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:00.480]  leaders we need men women black white old young
[1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:02.560]  uh... it doesn't matter who
[1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:05.600]  need to just start the fight for liberty and freedom and and
[1:58:05.600 --> 1:58:07.680]  against all these crimes and then
[1:58:07.680 --> 1:58:10.040]  dividends will be paid in freedom
[1:58:10.040 --> 1:58:13.440]  uh... in humanity and indecency in honor
[1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:17.280]  and so i i just leave what you're doing and and it's up to good christians who
[1:58:17.280 --> 1:58:18.200]  aren't
[1:58:18.200 --> 1:58:21.160]  you know this wicked counterfeit new world order christianity
[1:58:21.160 --> 1:58:24.240]  uh... to realize that most of the powerful churches are not all are bought
[1:58:24.240 --> 1:58:25.800]  and paid for by the new world order
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:27.520]  that's why they're in those positions
[1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:30.040]  i commend your courage i commend your work rather than
[1:58:30.040 --> 1:58:31.040]  kevin and that

[2:00:23.960 --> 2:00:28.800]  covering the canadian genocide through the government church schools the
[2:00:28.800 --> 2:00:33.760]  natives on average depending on what reservation 40 to 60 percent of the
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:38.960]  children big murdered and after 12 years of fighting it's now become mainstream
[2:00:38.960 --> 2:00:45.840]  news in canada thanks to this reverend god blessing and the next guest is
[2:00:45.840 --> 2:00:51.960]  dealing with that story we covered last week dealing with the los angeles times
[2:00:51.960 --> 2:00:55.520]  with if you raise your voice to a flight attendant you get charged as a
[2:00:55.520 --> 2:00:58.960]  terrorist now you can argue go ahead and charge people with a big crime for
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:03.360]  arguing with a godlike stewardess flight attendant in a restaurant for
[2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:08.920]  political incorrectness right there but what you can't argue with is the fact
[2:01:08.920 --> 2:01:12.000]  they're charging them under a terror charge they don't get due process so
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:15.720]  we'll be talking to a guest about that for about 25 minutes we'll get back the
[2:01:15.720 --> 2:01:19.800]  next segment and then for the balance of the show I'm going to cover the wall
[2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:25.280]  street journal coming out and proposing a north american union in a marrow
[2:01:25.280 --> 2:01:30.360]  currency is the way to save us from the economic collapse and what did the SPP
[2:01:30.360 --> 2:01:40.880]  group say from that BAMF Canada September 23rd 24th 2007 meeting what did
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:53.400]  they say they said that they were going to use a financial crises and that out
[2:01:53.400 --> 2:01:57.720]  of a financial crisis they would get their north american union and what
[2:01:57.720 --> 2:02:06.320]  are they doing now it's disgusting and the big news of the day that I spent the
[2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:11.400]  first hour on I am going to detail and then take your phone calls because I
[2:02:11.400 --> 2:02:15.080]  haven't even gone over the tip of the iceberg on this as they say new
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:19.360]  legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the US the issue isn't that they're just
[2:02:19.360 --> 2:02:23.920]  now they've already built the camps that's admitted as well it's that the
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:30.000]  legislation unveils the camp structure and how you're going to be living if
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:35.760]  you're living at all and now they're going to take over your local communities
[2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:43.520]  and federalize everything this is one of the most important stories we've ever
[2:02:43.520 --> 2:02:58.160]  put out and it's up on prisonplanet.com right now so I'm asking listeners to go
[2:02:58.160 --> 2:03:02.880]  there and get the story new legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the United
[2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:09.120]  States it's another story they've got up there school children complain of
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:12.960]  Obama worship during lessons the federal curricula now they're giving them the
[2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:27.480]  messianic leader God help us unbelievable that this is going on but if
[2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:33.200]  you go to prisonplanet.com or info wars.com in fact they're posting so
[2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:37.320]  much news it's already rolled off the main page of prisonplanet.com I guess
[2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:40.680]  you go to info wars.com let's see if it's still on the main page we need to
[2:03:40.680 --> 2:03:45.960]  have this up there at the top and like I told Paul Watson earlier his article is
[2:03:45.960 --> 2:03:49.800]  great but it needs we need to do another kind of Rosetta stone one that goes
[2:03:49.800 --> 2:03:59.240]  through all of the facets and how the big issue here is this gives us the
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:04.200]  architecture of the maintenance and control and operation of these
[2:04:04.200 --> 2:04:09.240]  facilities and you got the Supreme Court ruling again two weeks ago they
[2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:11.680]  ruled against the fourth woman they just ruled again just saying you're all

[2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:05.920]  threats to aircraft but we use that as an excuse why would the predatory system

[2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:15.480]  and uh... we appreciate him coming on sir you've got a long bio how would you
[2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:16.960]  best describe yourself
[2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:21.600]  well i'm a security practitioner practicing attorney focus on questions
[2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:23.160]  of the foreseeable risk
[2:10:23.160 --> 2:10:24.720]  of crime
[2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:28.880]  would be the the short way to get to the point
[2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:31.880]  give us your breakdown
[2:10:31.880 --> 2:10:34.280]  you know more than just the one line the only times put in here
[2:10:34.280 --> 2:10:36.720]  on uh... what's happening to people
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:38.280]  uh... who uh...
[2:10:38.280 --> 2:10:40.440]  cuss or even talk back or
[2:10:40.440 --> 2:10:42.160]  yell at flight attendants
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:46.200]  i think what's happening is that flight crews are escalating situations to the
[2:10:46.200 --> 2:10:48.920]  point where they have to justify it by
[2:10:48.920 --> 2:10:50.680]  asking for an arrest
[2:10:50.680 --> 2:10:54.520]  uh... and they rely back on interference with flight crew members of
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:10:57.120]  flight attendants which is in the u.s. code
[2:10:57.120 --> 2:10:59.200]  incorporated into
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:00.200]  the uh...
[2:11:00.200 --> 2:11:02.520]  the all the terrorism statutes
[2:11:02.520 --> 2:11:03.560]  in general
[2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:06.880]  and what it says really is it appears with the performance
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:09.760]  of that flight crew member or duties
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:13.200]  and lessons the ability of the crew member to perform is a hard duty is
[2:11:13.200 --> 2:11:14.680]  punishable under the sub
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:16.960]  uh... on the subsection section
[2:11:16.960 --> 2:11:20.160]  if the flight attendant gets to the point of frustration and says look i'm not
[2:11:20.160 --> 2:11:21.960]  able to carry out my duties
[2:11:21.960 --> 2:11:26.480]  whether they be to advise people to put on a seat belt or serve the next drink
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:30.520]  uh... that frustration rises to the level where claim is made that there is a
[2:11:30.520 --> 2:11:33.240]  violation of the u.s. code
[2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:36.720]  and when the plane lands the individual so charged
[2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:41.440]  is generally arrested generally not by federal agents but by local agents
[2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:45.400]  it's passed over to local agents and in more cases than not
[2:11:45.400 --> 2:11:50.040]  uh... it's adjudicated down to a warning
[2:11:50.040 --> 2:11:54.880]  we have some instances however we're both sides dick they dig their heels in
[2:11:54.880 --> 2:11:57.960]  and then you get you get the kind of prosecutions that uh...
[2:11:57.960 --> 2:12:01.400]  uh... appeared in the l.a. times for instance
[2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:06.320]  where type of sentences are are people uh... getting uh... for uh... talking
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:07.840]  back
[2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:11.640]  sometimes they get time in jail i mean the woman involved in uh...
[2:12:11.640 --> 2:12:15.040]  uh... the situation where she was
[2:12:15.040 --> 2:12:18.360]  reprimanding the children will maybe more than reprimanding the children
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:21.680]  uh... she ended up with three months sense
[2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:25.080]  other individuals uh... have less time some people have no time in a
[2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:26.520]  subjected to fines
[2:12:26.520 --> 2:12:30.520]  some people are barred for from flying for a period of time
[2:12:30.520 --> 2:12:34.720]  it varies on the jurisdiction in which that that is being imposed on how long
[2:12:34.720 --> 2:12:37.640]  are the sentences i mean i mean how long could the sentences be what's the
[2:12:37.640 --> 2:12:39.080]  twenty years
[2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:42.680]  twenty years yet went to prepare for the crack a flight crew
[2:12:42.680 --> 2:12:45.400]  uh... the maximum sentence twenty years in prison
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:46.480]  and so
[2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:50.960]  what we have here is a situation which has not been clearly defined
[2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:52.400]  and uh...
[2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:53.960]  depend depending on
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:55.960]  uh... who comes before
[2:12:55.960 --> 2:12:58.640]  uh... the outcome can be draconian
[2:12:58.640 --> 2:13:02.320]  which is the case when somebody is sentenced to jail time
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:04.600]  because they try to discipline their children
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:07.680]  where most of the other passengers on the airplane would probably applaud the
[2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:10.480]  person who's trying to discipline the children of the children are acting in
[2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:13.000]  an outrageous uh... fashion
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:15.600]  so it's an exchange of words
[2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:21.280]  uh... it's alleged here that she dropped a can of tomato juice on on the ground
[2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:22.400]  deliberately
[2:13:22.400 --> 2:13:26.640]  and that escalated to the point where when the plane landed she was arrested
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:29.240]  uh... what we ought to be looking at
[2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:32.080]  is the aviation transportation security act
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:36.560]  which initially established not only
[2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:40.640]  the series of offenses that were created by the t s a
[2:13:40.640 --> 2:13:44.720]  but also required that certain things be done to prevent them from occurring in
[2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:47.320]  the front first place and one of those things is that
[2:13:47.320 --> 2:13:48.960]  all flight crews
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:50.160]  what to receive
[2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:51.880]  security training
[2:13:51.880 --> 2:13:55.440]  one kind or another including the escalation training
[2:13:55.440 --> 2:13:58.520]  including the kind of training which stops these things from getting out of
[2:13:58.520 --> 2:13:59.240]  hand you know
[2:13:59.240 --> 2:14:00.560]  there's nothing new
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:01.360]  about
[2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:05.600]  disruptive passengers on airplanes they existed long before
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:06.640]  nine eleven
[2:14:06.640 --> 2:14:11.040]  without the same kind of draconian punishment that we have today
[2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:14.040]  it's just taken out of context you know sometimes
[2:14:14.040 --> 2:14:17.880]  that bad behavior is a result of serving them too much alcohol
[2:14:17.880 --> 2:14:19.880]  and that ought to be cut back on
[2:14:19.880 --> 2:14:25.040]  sometimes it's a result of allowing conduct on board the plane
[2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:29.120]  to reach a level where it starts to become offensive to everybody else and
[2:14:29.120 --> 2:14:30.560]  there is another example
[2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:32.320]  the article that you refer to
[2:14:32.320 --> 2:14:35.120]  uh... of just that happening
[2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:38.840]  well let's get into that other example in a moment mr slappy but i wanted to
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:42.080]  uh... you know you mentioned the the flight attendants escalating and i'm a
[2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:44.040]  real friendly nice person
[2:14:44.040 --> 2:14:47.240]  and i fly you know quite a bit probably more than most
[2:14:47.240 --> 2:14:49.560]  and uh...
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:52.720]  i have learned to hardly even talk to me you'll see the flight attendants have
[2:14:52.720 --> 2:14:55.800]  got a good attitude they're happy or they're just mechanical that's fine
[2:14:55.800 --> 2:14:58.360]  but i've seen people ask for a pillow they yell at him
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:01.280]  i've seen uh... you know when the plane is been off the ground for thirty
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:04.240]  minutes when it gets up to go to the bathroom they scream at him
[2:15:04.240 --> 2:15:08.160]  uh... it's it's it's like they're on a power trip with this new
[2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:10.600]  found power and it's like you're a prisoner
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:11.840]  or something and i think
[2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:14.720]  in a lot of cases i've read about that's actually escalating it
[2:15:14.720 --> 2:15:18.440]  they've been put a fictitious example of that in the film my anger management
[2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:21.360]  where the guy does nothing and they you know the air marshal tasers in
[2:15:21.360 --> 2:15:23.980]  uh... so so it seems like
[2:15:23.980 --> 2:15:26.080]  they're also part of the problem
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:29.080]  well they are indeed part of the problem and what the other part of the
[2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:30.160]  problem is
[2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:33.560]  the pressures of flying today are greater than they ever have been in the
[2:15:33.560 --> 2:15:34.800]  past
[2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:35.720]  you have
[2:15:35.720 --> 2:15:37.240]  very crowded aircraft
[2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:40.280]  despite the economic times that we're in
[2:15:40.280 --> 2:15:45.680]  uh... we are having bigger and faster airplanes so trips are shorter
[2:15:45.680 --> 2:15:49.080]  uh... but people are still spending two and three hours on the ground before
[2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:50.120]  they take off
[2:15:50.120 --> 2:15:53.080]  we have regulations which allow passengers to sit
[2:15:53.080 --> 2:15:54.440]  on the tarmac
[2:15:54.440 --> 2:15:58.280]  for up to four hours before they can get a drink of water
[2:15:58.280 --> 2:15:59.920]  can't get out of their seats
[2:15:59.920 --> 2:16:03.880]  so all these things come together and the pressures are then brought to bear
[2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:08.160]  on the flight attendants for after a while retaliate you know you and i
[2:16:08.160 --> 2:16:10.360]  will get on a plane will complete our trip
[2:16:10.360 --> 2:16:13.120]  we may have a bad experience for more often than not
[2:16:13.120 --> 2:16:14.840]  we will forget about it
[2:16:14.840 --> 2:16:17.840]  the flight attendant may have a series of bad trips
[2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:19.320]  in the same day
[2:16:19.320 --> 2:16:22.960]  involving delays on the ground and unhappy passengers and air conditioning
[2:16:22.960 --> 2:16:24.160]  that goes out
[2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:27.120]  and this is science seats and overbooked aircraft
[2:16:27.120 --> 2:16:29.200]  so that pension everywhere
[2:16:29.200 --> 2:16:32.920]  and unless we begin to train and de-escalation and take these things
[2:16:32.920 --> 2:16:34.400]  into consideration
[2:16:34.400 --> 2:16:35.720]  before we
[2:16:35.720 --> 2:16:36.880]  invoke
[2:16:36.880 --> 2:16:41.000]  things like the patriot act as they are a remedy for this
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:43.200]  we're going to have total chaos on airplanes
[2:16:43.200 --> 2:16:46.360]  but how are they doing this they claim the patriot act was for terrorists and
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:48.760]  separately from airplanes or transportation
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:51.240]  i'm sure you're a lawyer you've seen the articles where
[2:16:51.240 --> 2:16:53.960]  you know this state or that state the headlines always the same
[2:16:53.960 --> 2:16:58.480]  you know patriot act used in thousands of non-terror related drug cases or
[2:16:58.480 --> 2:17:01.960]  or family violence i mean they're using it all over the place now
[2:17:01.960 --> 2:17:06.520]  because the act does not require that you prove an intent to commit
[2:17:06.520 --> 2:17:07.520]  what we would
[2:17:07.520 --> 2:17:10.160]  understand is an act of terrorism
[2:17:10.160 --> 2:17:14.520]  it's been allowed to be interpreted by a variety of prosecutors on various
[2:17:14.520 --> 2:17:17.600]  levels from local levels to federal levels
[2:17:17.600 --> 2:17:23.120]  uh... it's been allowed to be taken out of context the intent was to stop
[2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:24.560]  particularly with regard to
[2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:25.640]  air travel
[2:17:25.640 --> 2:17:27.160]  to stop hijacking
[2:17:27.160 --> 2:17:28.200]  well we pretty much
[2:17:28.200 --> 2:17:29.720]  spot hijacking
[2:17:29.720 --> 2:17:32.360]  when we reinforce cockpit doors
[2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:36.080]  and imposed certain regulations with regard to keeping them closed
[2:17:36.080 --> 2:17:38.520]  so we're dealing with a different problem
[2:17:38.520 --> 2:17:42.040]  then the one that was in play at the time of the law was passed well why not
[2:17:42.040 --> 2:17:43.720]  just aren't pilots
[2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:48.080]  well we've done that too we have all pilots through a million hoops well
[2:17:48.080 --> 2:17:52.640]  that's true but but the flip side of that is that
[2:17:52.640 --> 2:17:54.840]  the fear that the pilot
[2:17:54.840 --> 2:17:57.120]  will become so frustrated
[2:17:57.120 --> 2:18:00.120]  in the same manner that the flight attendant is frustrated
[2:18:00.120 --> 2:18:03.760]  the new begun in a situation with his which is unauthorized and then they
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:07.680]  worry about the civil life yeah but we're trusting him with a giant airplane
[2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:10.800]  i mean and and and thousands of switches these are the most you know on
[2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:13.320]  average control most of them for military pilots
[2:18:13.320 --> 2:18:16.840]  we're not trust a airline pilot with a gun they shouldn't be trusted with a
[2:18:16.840 --> 2:18:17.720]  plane
[2:18:17.720 --> 2:18:21.360]  well i agree with you but the fact of the matter is that
[2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:23.560]  from the legal side of this issue
[2:18:23.560 --> 2:18:27.200]  the pilot is prepared to deal with all manner
[2:18:27.200 --> 2:18:30.560]  of threat when it comes to maneuvering the airplane
[2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:34.440]  but does not have the experience to handle a gun on board an airplane
[2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:36.360]  but it's just as simple as that
[2:18:36.360 --> 2:18:40.240]  and because of the fear of civil liability
[2:18:40.240 --> 2:18:44.480]  the airlines are strongly opposed to their pilots carrying guns now if they
[2:18:44.480 --> 2:18:46.520]  keep the cockpit door closed
[2:18:46.520 --> 2:18:48.640]  so that nobody can hijack the plane
[2:18:48.640 --> 2:18:51.880]  there is the fear of the pilot has the gun he will use that gun
[2:18:51.880 --> 2:18:55.040]  to interfere in a situation in the back of the plane
[2:18:55.040 --> 2:18:58.160]  which was established merely to have the door opened
[2:18:58.160 --> 2:18:59.800]  so that we face
[2:18:59.800 --> 2:19:02.360]  the same kind of problem again
[2:19:02.360 --> 2:19:03.720]  when it comes to
[2:19:03.720 --> 2:19:09.440]  uh... air height air piracy
[2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:12.280]  okay uh... we're gonna break certain connect with one more little quick
[2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:16.320]  segment uh... you were trying to tell the story of another case in the article
[2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:23.320]  uh... of uh... what's happening uh... with the the patriot act
[2:19:23.520 --> 2:19:26.360]  earlier i was i interrupted you were getting into another
[2:19:26.360 --> 2:19:29.160]  another point you want to make about the l a times article sir
[2:19:29.160 --> 2:19:32.840]  well absolutely and and i was a situation we had a couple on the plane and
[2:19:32.840 --> 2:19:33.640]  they were
[2:19:33.640 --> 2:19:36.400]  uh... accused of becoming too amorous
[2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:39.320]  the gentleman put his head in the lap
[2:19:39.320 --> 2:19:41.520]  of the lady he was flying with
[2:19:41.520 --> 2:19:44.200]  he alleges he would just was not feeling well
[2:19:44.200 --> 2:19:45.920]  and put his head down
[2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:48.880]  flight attendant came by and objected
[2:19:48.880 --> 2:19:51.480]  to what it looked like to her
[2:19:51.480 --> 2:19:53.480]  uh... they then
[2:19:53.480 --> 2:19:56.040]  entered into an argument with the flight attendant
[2:19:56.040 --> 2:19:58.040]  which resulted in an arrest
[2:19:58.040 --> 2:19:59.160]  of both parties
[2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:02.400]  stay there let's hear about the rest of the comeback the united states seems to
[2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:05.960]  be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt but the truth
[2:20:05.960 --> 2:20:09.720]  be told public and private debt increase to a record high in nineteen ninety
[2:20:09.720 --> 2:20:13.880]  nine reaching a peak of fourteen point eight trillion dollars marking ten point
[2:20:13.880 --> 2:20:18.080]  five seven percent annual increase outpacing its previous ten years
[2:20:18.080 --> 2:20:22.040]  the u.s. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking
[2:20:22.040 --> 2:20:25.600]  institution called the federal reserve system in the year two thousand debt
[2:20:25.600 --> 2:20:28.520]  growth collapsed to only four point five percent
[2:20:28.520 --> 2:20:32.000]  it's bad enough that the u.s. citizens is bounded by debt in order to have
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:35.720]  commerce however shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude
[2:20:35.720 --> 2:20:39.080]  wipeout years of growth in a stock portfolio

[2:24:31.240 --> 2:24:34.040]  and we've got that up on screen right now a shot of your website
[2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:37.160]  okay finish the story so he's got his head in the woman's lap
[2:24:37.160 --> 2:24:41.240]  uh... and uh... what happens next uh... and and the woman is smiling
[2:24:41.240 --> 2:24:45.200]  and the flight attendant made an assumption as to what was going on
[2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:47.800]  between the two passengers
[2:24:47.800 --> 2:24:50.240]  instructed the gentleman to sit up
[2:24:50.240 --> 2:24:54.520]  and then they engaged in an argument as to what was going on and uh...
[2:24:54.520 --> 2:24:57.880]  uh... the flight attendant became more incensed and more offended when the plane
[2:24:57.880 --> 2:24:58.880]  landed
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:02.440]  they were arrested for loot in the previous conduct on board an airplane
[2:25:02.440 --> 2:25:05.280]  now how does that get into the patriot act well
[2:25:05.280 --> 2:25:09.160]  on the law it says anything that interferes with the performance of the
[2:25:09.160 --> 2:25:11.120]  crew members duties
[2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:15.080]  can be charged as interference with flight crew members of flight attendants
[2:25:15.080 --> 2:25:17.040]  on the forty nine u.s. boat
[2:25:17.040 --> 2:25:19.120]  so it's taken out of context
[2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:22.120]  uh... and the argument is made and somebody wanted to go along and
[2:25:22.120 --> 2:25:23.920]  prosecute that case
[2:25:23.920 --> 2:25:27.840]  in fact one of them will have the charges dropped the other one who had
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:29.720]  never been arrested before
[2:25:29.720 --> 2:25:33.920]  uh... received a thirty-day suspended sentence but now has a sense
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:37.760]  the whole thing just taken out of context
[2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:41.440]  i've you know i've seen so many cases of the patriot act being used by states
[2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:43.360]  and non-terror related cases
[2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:46.240]  uh... and i believe from memory but correct me i'm uh... if i'm wrong i
[2:25:46.240 --> 2:25:50.640]  know you scan a lot of the cases as a lawyer that works on this
[2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:54.680]  our police now not trying to not just on aircraft but claim you interfere with
[2:25:54.680 --> 2:25:56.040]  police duties
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:25:59.000]  and uh... are they trying to use terrorism charges there as well
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:02.160]  uh... absolutely it is covered by the patriot act
[2:26:02.160 --> 2:26:04.140]  interference with the police officer in
[2:26:04.140 --> 2:26:08.280]  interference with a bus driver because it covers all transportation
[2:26:08.280 --> 2:26:09.560]  for instance
[2:26:09.560 --> 2:26:14.360]  so when you are interfering nowadays with an individual who is performing a
[2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:15.800]  public function
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:20.200]  you run the risk of being brought up by charges related to the patriot act
[2:26:20.200 --> 2:26:24.000]  uh... again that's not why the law was passed that was not the intent of the
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:25.960]  law but the way it is written
[2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:30.480]  it allows anybody who wants to piggyback on to do so and they're doing so
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:35.920]  the way to stop it is for prosecutors to stop prosecuting cases of this kind
[2:26:35.920 --> 2:26:38.240]  for the public to become so incensed
[2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:40.240]  that nobody dare go near them
[2:26:40.240 --> 2:26:43.920]  in situations like this unless they can articulate a real
[2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:46.340]  terrorist threat well
[2:26:46.340 --> 2:26:50.360]  well sir i would say you know let's go repeal these sections of the patriot act
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:53.320]  but i'm scared to do that because they probably add more on
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:55.560]  and i know that the clinton administration wrote up most of the
[2:26:55.560 --> 2:26:57.720]  patriot act and couldn't get it passed so this is
[2:26:57.720 --> 2:27:01.600]  you're saying they they're misusing it but i believe clearly a lot of legal
[2:27:01.600 --> 2:27:05.960]  scholars believe that we've had on that they meant they intended this all along
[2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:08.800]  to basically abolish the constitution will write to me i have the boston
[2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:09.840]  globe today
[2:27:09.840 --> 2:27:12.520]  saying u.s. supreme court says passenger can be frisk
[2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:15.840]  with no probable cause i mean they're saying no probable cause now they're
[2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:17.160]  saying now that
[2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:20.120]  uh... with the exclusionary rule that uh... in the case two weeks ago the
[2:27:20.120 --> 2:27:24.400]  supreme court ruled that uh... they can basically go in with wrong search warrants
[2:27:24.400 --> 2:27:28.120]  or make things up and still admissible i mean what is this going to end
[2:27:28.120 --> 2:27:31.840]  well it's going to end when the public is had enough of it but until there is a
[2:27:31.840 --> 2:27:32.800]  wide
[2:27:32.800 --> 2:27:36.760]  based outcry we're going to continue with it i remember an airport
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:37.960]  is a border
[2:27:37.960 --> 2:27:43.120]  and so your normal constitutional protections are way at the border
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:47.760]  and they can indeed search you without probable cause they can randomly search
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:48.240]  you
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:49.360]  in an airport
[2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:51.360]  and it's happening all of the time
[2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:55.240]  and you agree to that by virtue of the fact that you buy a ticket to fly which
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:27:56.320]  once again
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:27:57.600]  is not a right
[2:27:57.600 --> 2:28:00.640]  it's privileged and you know what i mean to the condition but but but this
[2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:03.520]  court case was in a better border
[2:28:03.520 --> 2:28:06.560]  i mean this is just a police pull you over and said there's no fourth amendment
[2:28:06.560 --> 2:28:08.120]  anymore
[2:28:08.120 --> 2:28:12.960]  well i'm as far as far as i know that's not upheld once it gets into a court
[2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:15.760]  rule and we still have a fourth amendment no no no here here here's the
[2:28:15.760 --> 2:28:16.880]  boston globe today
[2:28:16.880 --> 2:28:20.040]  u.s. supreme court says passenger can be frisk supreme court will mind that
[2:28:20.040 --> 2:28:23.520]  police officers have leeway to frisk a passenger car stop the traffic violation
[2:28:23.520 --> 2:28:25.840]  even though they indicates a passenger to commit a crime
[2:28:25.840 --> 2:28:28.800]  or is about to do so the court on monday unanimously overruled
[2:28:28.800 --> 2:28:31.360]  there is no appeals court the throughout evidence found during such an
[2:28:31.360 --> 2:28:34.280]  encounter the case involved two thousand two pat down search of an elroy
[2:28:34.280 --> 2:28:35.280]  arizona man
[2:28:35.280 --> 2:28:38.760]  by oral valley police officer found a gun in marijuana the justice except that
[2:28:38.760 --> 2:28:42.600]  there is on his argument the traffic stops are inherently dangerous for police
[2:28:42.600 --> 2:28:46.320]  okay but stop itself was lawful
[2:28:46.320 --> 2:28:50.240]  in other words that what they did here was that the passenger in the vehicle
[2:28:50.240 --> 2:28:53.720]  but they did have the right to stop the vehicle so i miss understood what you
[2:28:53.720 --> 2:28:54.280]  will
[2:28:54.280 --> 2:28:57.920]  setting forth if they do have the right to stop the vehicle
[2:28:57.920 --> 2:29:01.440]  they don't necessarily have the right or did not have the right
[2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:03.880]  the first the passenger inside the car
[2:29:03.880 --> 2:29:04.840]  although
[2:29:04.840 --> 2:29:08.760]  anybody inside of the vehicle for instance is responsible for everything
[2:29:08.760 --> 2:29:12.440]  in that vehicle but sir was it a privilege to ride a horse down the road
[2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:16.600]  i mean when they brought in cars you know they started taxes on on on trucks
[2:29:16.600 --> 2:29:19.800]  saying we're messing up the roads made them get licenses than the people that
[2:29:19.800 --> 2:29:22.840]  why have the court rulings and i'm sure you've seen them that prior to those
[2:29:22.840 --> 2:29:24.360]  rulings in the twenties
[2:29:24.360 --> 2:29:26.800]  uh... it was not a privilege to travel
[2:29:26.800 --> 2:29:29.000]  because we're giving up our rights
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:32.280]  it in uh... in return for what we consider to be
[2:29:32.280 --> 2:29:33.800]  some kind of benefit
[2:29:33.800 --> 2:29:36.560]  some kind of a convenience and it's a mistake
[2:29:36.560 --> 2:29:38.320]  i'm not opposed to what you're saying
[2:29:38.320 --> 2:29:39.480]  no no i hear you

[2:35:48.120 --> 2:35:58.600]  on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com right now by Paul Watson
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:02.360]  and you're like Alex you've shown us video FEMA camps you've been to FEMA camps you've
[2:36:02.360 --> 2:36:08.400]  covered FEMA camps the majory papers admit they've built FEMA camps why is this article
[2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:17.640]  so important why is this new piece of legislation so important HR 645 well I went through a lot
[2:36:17.640 --> 2:36:21.600]  of that in the first hour today but I want to go back over the main points and some
[2:36:21.600 --> 2:36:29.240]  other points I didn't flush out entirely and again I'm gonna have Paul Watson go over
[2:36:29.240 --> 2:36:33.120]  every point I made every point he's made and then put a link to all the stories build
[2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:40.000]  legislation the backup on all of that and on screen we've got some of the FEMA camps
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:45.960]  that they've built the bar bar facing in for you and old military bases predominantly
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:50.120]  now they're moving city county governments into those as the true seats of governments
[2:36:50.120 --> 2:36:58.160]  and this is total federalization absolute and total and complete tyranny so we will
[2:36:58.160 --> 2:37:06.320]  go over that report the importance of it is just completely off the charts but I wanted
[2:37:06.320 --> 2:37:21.360]  to before I did that get into a story out of the Wall Street Journal market watch today
[2:37:21.360 --> 2:37:25.840]  because normally this would be our top story it's just dwarfed by the other one for all
[2:37:25.840 --> 2:37:34.000]  the reasons stated here it is not just that the Wall Street Journal and every other major
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:39.120]  publication is saying world governments here they're saying exactly what we told you they'd
[2:37:39.120 --> 2:37:48.720]  say that it's here to save you that it's going to fix the financial crises that it's the
[2:37:48.720 --> 2:37:54.320]  only answer that will get our economy going again that's the entire mindset and the modus
[2:37:54.320 --> 2:37:59.680]  operandi of the global controllers they stage terror attacks to get you to give up your liberties
[2:37:59.680 --> 2:38:05.240]  or to get you to stand down while they take over your liberties while you're dumbfounded
[2:38:05.240 --> 2:38:13.000]  they stage environmental crises to offer more control they stage economic collapses to bring
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:20.120]  in the next phase of their agenda and they said in the SPP documents the judicial watch
[2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:30.080]  soon and got in late 19 late 2007 in September and they said we will sell the North American
[2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:38.280]  Union the the Amero the SPP through crises and Robert Pasteur one of the front men one
[2:38:38.280 --> 2:38:41.960]  of the professors that you know it's got their front man of quote thinking of the idea that
[2:38:41.960 --> 2:38:45.400]  was in the New York Times in the 30s and the global has been pushing for for decades before
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:50.480]  Robert Pasteur got out of diapers and he said out of the threat of terrorism out of
[2:38:50.480 --> 2:38:54.560]  the economic collapse out of security threats we will build a North American Union and they
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:39:02.520]  will propose a common border with the three nations the United States Canada and Mexico
[2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:08.840]  so here is market watch publication of the Wall Street Journal today it's a link up on
[2:39:08.840 --> 2:39:16.160]  info wars dot com I'm showing people the article the printed copy at prison planet dot TV how
[2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:25.840]  realistic is a North American currency using US Canada Mexico money could result from crisis
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:32.640]  they have to destroy the dollar to bring in the new world order the banks engineer the
[2:39:32.640 --> 2:39:38.400]  crisis steal tens of trillions won't say where it went and now we're here Obama diverting
[2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:41.720]  people with this trillion dollar stimulus package it's just pork barrel and government
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:47.320]  CPS funding and police funding and further federalization funding and that debates going
[2:39:47.320 --> 2:39:52.920]  on today but that's a trillion compared to the 8.5 trillion stolen that we know of by
[2:39:52.920 --> 2:39:59.920]  the banks who won't say where it all went and how they phrase all of this is well now
[2:39:59.920 --> 2:40:03.720]  we've got to have an international body that sets currencies worldwide so still have a
[2:40:03.720 --> 2:40:09.280]  dollar still have a loony still have a pound still have a euro but they'll all be set and
[2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:13.000]  pegged and controlled they say maybe at the same level maybe sometimes they'll say this
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:16.160]  is worth more this is worth less this is the same private banks that are going to run
[2:40:16.160 --> 2:40:19.920]  this world government that they've already set up they're now taking the curtain off
[2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:24.960]  how I can show room in a car show where they pull the you know the velvet sheet off the
[2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:29.480]  new car and who everybody looks at it they're now unveiling it just like they're unveiling
[2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:35.920]  the camps that means they've gotten up to the point of being ready to use them and so
[2:40:35.920 --> 2:40:41.400]  the very banks that manipulate currencies that make some cases billions and billions
[2:40:41.400 --> 2:40:46.840]  of dollars per nation today with insider trading now they're going to be setting the currencies
[2:40:46.840 --> 2:40:51.640]  knowing where they're going to go and then controlling the currency manipulation market
[2:40:51.640 --> 2:40:55.800]  openly and you'll pay your carbon taxes to them and I know most of you as an audience
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:41:06.280]  know that but the general public has no idea and so there wouldn't be any political resistance
[2:41:06.280 --> 2:41:13.000]  to this they said there's no North American Union there's no Napa super highways there's
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:17.640]  no North American Union corridors didn't matter how many government maps or documents
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:22.320]  or c-span hearings they had on admitting it they would say doesn't exist doesn't exist
[2:41:22.320 --> 2:41:26.760]  so when they finally unveil it everybody people don't feel like it's kosher to talk
[2:41:26.760 --> 2:41:31.880]  about it mean you'll be talking to them they go yeah I know they're setting it up people
[2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:35.120]  think you're a cuckoo if you talk about it so see they say it doesn't exist first then
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:39.440]  they unveil it that's a psych warfare tactic just like in the mid 90s people talk about
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:43.880]  black helicopters and black helicopters crashing and urban warfare drills and I'd laugh at
[2:41:43.880 --> 2:41:50.160]  them on air and then in 2006 somebody mailed me a soldier to fortune and it talked about
[2:41:50.160 --> 2:41:54.240]  Delta Force doing drills of taking over Houston crashing a helicopter people dying and then
[2:41:54.240 --> 2:41:58.240]  I started talking to police chiefs and sheriffs and others about the payoffs and the covert
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:03.720]  military takeover the United States and found it was true but I remember in 93 94 95 they
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:08.960]  would have ads on TV for products they would just go oh you crazy black helicopter people
[2:42:08.960 --> 2:42:13.200]  they would just throw that into movies and sitcoms before they started the urban warfare
[2:42:13.200 --> 2:42:19.040]  drills they would condition people that it didn't exist you know you hear a radio ad
[2:42:19.040 --> 2:42:25.560]  I remember one dish network a direct TV first came out like a 95 hey look there's space aliens
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:30.960]  washing their cars on Mars and black helicopters mixing something that didn't exist space aliens
[2:42:30.960 --> 2:42:38.360]  washing cars on Mars with black helicopters you hear all this nonsensical conditioning
[2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:41.600]  and you know in movies I bet you're one of them crazy black helicopter people and nobody
[2:42:41.600 --> 2:42:48.280]  was talking about it more like what is this and then the drill started and it was like
[2:42:48.280 --> 2:42:52.320]  oh I live here in this town Alex you got to come down here they they blew up a building
[2:42:52.320 --> 2:42:56.320]  and we're telling people to stay in their houses and sure enough so they'd mail me the
[2:42:56.320 --> 2:43:00.280]  local newspaper and I'd go on air and read it and people call him going you nut you crazy
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:11.520]  person that doesn't exist that was a basic psychological warfare operation this doesn't
[2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:18.720]  exist your cooks if you talk about it then they unleash it and they did that with FEMA
[2:43:18.720 --> 2:43:21.440]  camps and now they're unveiling it but see you're not supposed to talk about it because
[2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:28.640]  your cooks but now they're saying they've built it for your own good and people go well I
[2:43:28.640 --> 2:43:32.040]  mean I've seen police in Austin a warrantless checkpoint searching people and you walk up
[2:43:32.040 --> 2:43:38.240]  and they go oh Jones his big brother gonna get me it's a police state and I'm like yeah
[2:43:38.240 --> 2:43:42.960]  this is a police state right here so even as they're doing it it doesn't exist you understand
[2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:47.040]  that mind control guys you get what I'm saying in there you're digging me as they say you
[2:43:47.040 --> 2:43:56.000]  dig it how realistic is North American currency uniting US Canada Mexico would result could
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:44:04.080]  result from crisis Todd Harrison world hold on instead of messing with our future open
[2:44:04.080 --> 2:44:09.000]  up inside Bob Sinclair Thomas Jefferson once said when you reach the end of your rope tie
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:18.600]  an audit and hang on as the global financial system pushes on a string investors are desperately
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:24.480]  trying to hold on tight the new world order is upon us full of hope promise and a fair
[2:44:24.480 --> 2:44:32.080]  amount of fear oh the new world order I mean folks I've got every day I see 10 15 20 articles
[2:44:32.080 --> 2:44:35.800]  for the new world order and I'm not looking for him here's the international Harold Tribune
[2:44:35.800 --> 2:44:40.960]  the chance for a new world order Henry Kissinger is not just on TV saying it every day and
[2:44:40.960 --> 2:44:45.640]  saying Obama will bring in the new world order here is Kissinger writing an op-ed piece that
[2:44:45.640 --> 2:44:57.520]  was in hundreds of newspapers the chance for a new world order by Henry Kissinger and remember
[2:44:57.520 --> 2:45:01.560]  him about two years ago on Charlie Rose I have a clip of it in in game blueprint for
[2:45:01.560 --> 2:45:07.800]  global enslavement the true Rosetta's own film that it shows you the big picture in
[2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:13.480]  detail covers it all he said we've got a first real chance in the world order there will
[2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:18.240]  soon be a crisis and then we'll have our first real chance and Rockefeller all we need the
[2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:25.200]  right global crisis the citizens of the world will accept their world government so understand
[2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:30.560]  I mean I'm not not so much anymore but I walk around the halls of a local media conglomerate
[2:45:30.560 --> 2:45:35.160]  in us and now everybody's high health you're right about everything but boy my gosh what's
[2:45:35.160 --> 2:45:38.000]  going to happen next but just a few years ago be like you know walk through the halls
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:45.920]  oh it's mr. black helicopter and I'm like you know I'm sorry I've been to all these
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:49.880]  urban warfare drill takeovers and that they terrorize nursing homes and things I mean
[2:45:49.880 --> 2:45:55.760]  I'm just you know facts now though they've lost their 401k are losing it now you know
[2:45:55.760 --> 2:46:00.640]  now people on the street that we're laughing I mean it's not funny anymore Thomas Jefferson
[2:46:00.640 --> 2:46:05.320]  once said when you reach the end of your rope tie a knot and hang on so see he's saying this
[2:46:05.320 --> 2:46:10.400]  is going to fix it you know we got to do something we just got this idea it's called a new world
[2:46:10.400 --> 2:46:13.720]  order and these foreign banks will run our currencies and we'll have north com on the
[2:46:13.720 --> 2:46:20.480]  streets and he goes on the new world order is upon us full of hope see everything's real
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:26.680]  bad but Obama's hope and the new world orders hope and we always said a new world order's
[2:46:26.680 --> 2:46:30.920]  losing our currency troops on the streets FEMA camps cameras it's all being announced
[2:46:30.920 --> 2:46:34.720]  now and people are still writing op-ed pieces going Alex Jones the crazy lunatic believes
[2:46:34.720 --> 2:46:38.360]  in a new world order what kind of create or they see yeah there's a new world order there
[2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:48.680]  speeds a new international system new order is upon us full of hope full of hope promise
[2:46:48.680 --> 2:46:53.600]  and a fair amount of fear in our recent discussions regarding the direction of our country we
[2:46:53.600 --> 2:46:59.440]  noted the risk of catering to conventional wisdom and the implications of the US dollar
[2:46:59.440 --> 2:47:05.240]  so see then they say we got something daring new and unconventional we got hope and it's
[2:47:05.240 --> 2:47:12.120]  the new world order and guess what it is the North American Union this is now about news
[2:47:12.120 --> 2:47:20.960]  score this is Fox News here they now on the Wall Street Journal
[2:47:20.960 --> 2:47:27.800]  the many of ill mantra is to provide financial news you know to know before you need to know
[2:47:27.800 --> 2:47:36.600]  it there is a fine line between walk as foreseen and reading this wrong there is a fine line
[2:47:36.600 --> 2:47:43.680]  to walk as foresight often flies in the face of mainstream acceptance in 2006 it seemed
[2:47:43.680 --> 2:47:52.480]  counterintuitive to forecast a prolonged socioeconomic may lays entirely more depressing than a recession
[2:47:52.480 --> 2:47:57.560]  so this insider pushing globalism is going oh I was so smart telling you three years ago
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:48:01.920]  this was going to happen well of course it's like somebody calling the police is saying
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:05.360]  this bank will be robbed next week on Tuesday because they know they're the one that's going
[2:48:05.360 --> 2:48:11.960]  to be robbing it I mean the CFR loves to brag their heart rubbing commission with Gary Hart
[2:48:11.960 --> 2:48:16.080]  going I predicted we'd be attacked I predicted it would happen I predicted we would pass
[2:48:16.080 --> 2:48:21.520]  homeland security because they wrote the plan for it we are globalist you're on the inside
[2:48:21.520 --> 2:48:25.480]  for years the notion of an invisible hand was conspiracy theory until we learned that
[2:48:25.480 --> 2:48:31.760]  a working group of financial markets was a central policy tool so see now they're unveiling
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:37.360]  it to everybody oh there is a secret world banking group but they care about you and
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:41.360]  now as we gaze across the historically significant horizon we must open our minds to thoughts
[2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:47.680]  and ideas that may seem far into folks conditioned by the past and stunned by the present and
[2:48:47.680 --> 2:48:53.480]  I'm now hearing kind of other mainline conservative host now that Fox News is talking about this
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:59.000]  and now that uh remember Limbaugh said the CFR didn't exist ten years ago now they're
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:04.560]  on TV every day so I'm hearing kind of mainline talk show host start going folks I know this
[2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:08.360]  is kooky but it's a world government oh and people are like oh my god did you hear what
[2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:18.240]  glenn beck said Alex you're stealing everything he says he just announced all this well I don't
[2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:21.480]  territorialize this info the problem is glenn beck will give you half the truth currency
[2:49:21.480 --> 2:49:25.960]  crossroads as governments take on more risk as they price assets on behalf of the market
[2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:36.600]  oh I skipped one of the paragraphs and now as we gaze across our historically significant
[2:49:36.600 --> 2:49:40.960]  horizon we must open our minds to thoughts and ideas that may seem far into folks conditioned
[2:49:40.960 --> 2:49:46.160]  by the past and stunned by the present so see they didn't want to tell the public they
[2:49:46.160 --> 2:49:49.840]  were setting up world government bankrupting the currency and setting up FEMA camps and
[2:49:49.840 --> 2:49:54.160]  doing all of this but now the establishment thinks it's too late they're coming on going
[2:49:54.160 --> 2:50:00.200]  yeah we built camps for you we're federalizing everything yeah it's a world government and
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:03.080]  now glenn beck can come out and others and go yeah it's a world government the bankers
[2:50:03.080 --> 2:50:07.960]  are running everything because they think it's too late they have now engineered their operation
[2:50:07.960 --> 2:50:11.840]  so now because it's now time to have open world government they're like going yeah it's
[2:50:11.840 --> 2:50:19.080]  here world government yeah I know you're stunned by your past thoughts you know they're being
[2:50:19.080 --> 2:50:25.360]  patronizing here our minds to thoughts and ideas that may seem far into folks conditioned
[2:50:25.360 --> 2:50:30.040]  by the past and stunned by the present oh you were conditioned by us they're saying but
[2:50:30.040 --> 2:50:38.840]  now like Carl Rove said we change your reality for the snap of a finger we just okay it never
[2:50:38.840 --> 2:50:42.920]  existed we were never at war with East Asia now we've always been at war with East Asia
[2:50:42.920 --> 2:50:52.400]  you understand 2 plus 2 equals 10 and then they go into the currency crossroads the only

[3:00:34.920 --> 3:00:38.200]  while they were building it doesn't exist doesn't exist doesn't exist
[3:00:38.200 --> 3:00:41.320]  building the femur caps getting the trips ready to engage us doesn't exist
[3:00:42.920 --> 3:00:46.280]  but we knew what was happening we knew what was going on we were warning you
[3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:51.000]  will you now listen and then there's this article oh
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:59.400]  oh now i'm going to come back and we're going to talk to anti-illuminati lin mike barry carmen
[3:01:00.520 --> 3:01:06.680]  anthony and others that are patiently holding until the bottom of the hour i'm going to take
[3:01:06.680 --> 3:01:09.480]  some phone calls and we hear what you have to say about the first hour of you heard it where i
[3:01:09.480 --> 3:01:12.840]  broke this down then i'm going to go back over to the more detail and continue with calls
[3:01:12.840 --> 3:01:20.760]  but and i want to go back and remind you of may 24 2006 we have the secret femur documents
[3:01:21.320 --> 3:01:26.600]  and then over a year later it came out mainstream news that yes it was exactly as we said well
[3:01:26.600 --> 3:01:30.920]  yeah we had it from preachers secret femur documents training them to tell their flocks go
[3:01:30.920 --> 3:01:35.320]  to the camps turn your guns in it's of the lord that's because they're not doing all this for nothing
[3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:39.080]  you know they're saying well we're doing this now with the femur camps because the economic
[3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:43.800]  collapse you're going to have to go to them and we're going to run your local cities but oh
[3:01:43.800 --> 3:01:48.600]  it's just because the economic collapse they've just been quietly setting us up for a long long
[3:01:48.600 --> 3:01:55.880]  time secret femur planning is pastors is pacifiers in preparation for martial law forced inoculation
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:02:02.760]  and so much more and by the way the pastor sent me these and i said okay do i need to black your
[3:02:02.760 --> 3:02:08.040]  name out he said yes i said do i need to black the fax number off he goes no it's a little local
[3:02:08.040 --> 3:02:13.880]  store they don't even know me i went to the little town femur and homeland security went
[3:02:14.920 --> 3:02:18.680]  days after the story broke on our website but paul first covered it but that didn't get the
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:23.960]  big attention it did on the show here we had the preacher on they went because we left the
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:28.920]  fax number on there put a bunch of pages up so i should have taken it off but he said you know
[3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:35.320]  didn't have to do it they went got the security camera tapes found out found out what his car
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:40.120]  was found out which preacher it was and they walked in to the hospital where he volunteers he has a
[3:02:40.120 --> 3:02:44.680]  large flock as well but hospitalary volunteers said you're fired get out of here you know why
[3:02:44.680 --> 3:02:49.400]  don't you ever talk about this stuff again and we talked to another pastor as well who was scared
[3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:53.480]  to come on air but gave us the same documents people said oh it's not real it's fake documents
[3:02:53.480 --> 3:03:01.640]  you know you're just making it all up and then it's been on the news in fact um i don't have it
[3:03:01.640 --> 3:03:07.240]  loaded in the computer here but we've never played it on tv we've always aired the audio pull up uh
[3:03:08.840 --> 3:03:14.200]  fema pastors for marshal law and there'll be a several newscast uh cue that up there in the
[3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:20.440]  break i want to find one of those for later in the show it'll be on youtube in fact paul
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:24.200]  watson wrote articles here and a half later when we were proven right um
[3:03:24.200 --> 3:03:26.200]  um
[3:03:29.800 --> 3:03:34.680]  yes so you're hitting date at it yep yep here it is pastors for marshal law continuity of government
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:41.800]  so uh we'll show people that newscast actually that's a remix where somebody put congressman
[3:03:41.800 --> 3:03:49.880]  talking about marshal law mixed in with it but uh i'll find it during the break the point is
[3:03:49.880 --> 3:03:55.080]  is that uh we're going to go over that but first we're going to go to your phone calls when we come
[3:03:55.080 --> 3:04:02.200]  back also uh how realistic is a north american currency i want to point you at info wars dot

[3:04:12.760 --> 3:04:19.000]  from private to public from private to elite bankers the common denominator or release valve
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:25.080]  becomes the currency if our economic condition is allowed to take medicine in the form of debt
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:30.440]  destruction the greenback will appreciate an asset classes as a whole will deflate if we
[3:04:30.440 --> 3:04:36.680]  continue to inject drugs that mass symptoms rather than address the disease the likelihood of a seismic
[3:04:36.680 --> 3:04:43.320]  readjustment increase in kind and they go on to say the answer is the north american currency
[3:04:43.320 --> 3:04:48.520]  you know that's what's going to come from this and it says the north american currency called the
[3:04:48.520 --> 3:04:55.240]  amaro in select circles would effectively co-mingle the canadian dollar u.s at mexico peso
[3:04:56.520 --> 3:05:03.640]  and then they go on to say that you know it's what's coming get ready for it attention this is an

[3:07:22.040 --> 3:07:27.320]  mental clarity and loss of weight it was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water but due
[3:07:27.320 --> 3:07:32.760]  to modern way of life most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in
[3:07:32.760 --> 3:07:37.560]  an alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis

[3:08:15.080 --> 3:08:22.520]  i cannot find words to describe how serious it is that femur came out and announced that they
[3:08:22.520 --> 3:08:26.520]  built all these femur camps for the american people and now they're trying to pass legislation
[3:08:26.520 --> 3:08:32.920]  under north com to forcibly merge your local police the national guard and everything underneath
[3:08:32.920 --> 3:08:37.720]  these systems and they're going to have tens of thousands of preachers building around telling
[3:08:37.720 --> 3:08:42.600]  your flocks to go to the femur camps right now on screen right here we have the newscast a year and
[3:08:42.600 --> 3:08:48.120]  a half after we broke it admitting exactly what we said but spinning it like martial law is a good
[3:08:48.120 --> 3:08:53.560]  thing and all this stuff's great this is real and just like in nazi germany they'd say we're
[3:08:53.560 --> 3:08:58.520]  relocating you because the economic downturn or the war to a place where you'll be safe
[3:08:59.880 --> 3:09:04.280]  and then they're saying also troublemakers will have to be held in the camps so this is how they're
[3:09:04.280 --> 3:09:08.600]  going to introduce it if the local police and military to follow orders and go along with it
[3:09:09.560 --> 3:09:15.000]  and then they can turn the heat up so this is happening this is going on we're going to go to
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:21.080]  your phone calls now yesterday i had a bunch of callers who were on hold when the show ended
[3:09:21.080 --> 3:09:23.720]  i promised that if they called back today they would go to the head of the line when we did
[3:09:23.720 --> 3:09:27.720]  open the phones up and an anthony in georgia we're going to go to in a moment has called back
[3:09:28.920 --> 3:09:34.280]  started getting into an analogy of barack obama and then we had to cut him off because the show ended
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:39.800]  so i wanted to go back to anthony and and and also i'm doing men on the street interviews
[3:09:39.800 --> 3:09:44.680]  one of the last things i'm shooting for this obama deception film and we're also going to take
[3:09:44.680 --> 3:09:51.640]  some clips from the show of listeners calling in about barack obama with their take on him but
[3:09:51.640 --> 3:09:58.920]  particularly african americans because i've been pleasantly pleased and surprised uh because i
[3:09:59.640 --> 3:10:03.800]  you know really thought that the obama folks black or white were completely sold on his fraud
[3:10:06.760 --> 3:10:11.880]  but particularly black folks that i'm talking to really know what's going on and see right through
[3:10:11.880 --> 3:10:16.760]  it now it turns out uh one of the top guys in public enemy came out and i didn't even know this
[3:10:16.760 --> 3:10:21.800]  i saw some other videos he's a fan of the show you know not just uh krs one the krs one was
[3:10:21.800 --> 3:10:26.120]  telling me the night he said man so much a hip hop just loves you and i'd heard that but i didn't
[3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:33.400]  really know that uh so the good news is not everybody is drinking the koolaid here and that's
[3:10:33.400 --> 3:10:40.360]  going to become more and more evident as things get worse and worse now i had a obama supporter
[3:10:40.360 --> 3:10:47.400]  in the trailer for the obama deception film comment and say that by me criticizing obama
[3:10:47.400 --> 3:10:51.400]  and saying he's selling out on his promises and it's just a puppet of the elite that i somehow
[3:10:51.400 --> 3:10:56.280]  am a trader and i've gotten hundreds of these emails there's on this one trailer just a few
[3:10:56.280 --> 3:11:01.640]  days after we released it thousands of comments and the majority of them are awake and know what's
[3:11:01.640 --> 3:11:05.160]  going on a lot of them are you know pointing out that they're black folks and that they see right
[3:11:05.160 --> 3:11:09.720]  through obama and that i exposed bush for eight years and that this is nonpartisan that we're
[3:11:09.720 --> 3:11:15.000]  trying to get folks to look past like krs one has said past the burger king manager george
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:21.560]  bush and barack obama to the franchise owners the elite these presidents are diversions to keep us
[3:11:21.560 --> 3:11:27.240]  looking down here instead of up there at the real power structure and you look at these comments
[3:11:28.120 --> 3:11:33.640]  this is from jx ford one from youtube on our official obama trailer the obama deception
[3:11:33.640 --> 3:11:44.280]  why didn't this piece of uh bleeping a producer creator take on bush this looks like far right
[3:11:44.280 --> 3:11:48.520]  wing propaganda machine that will break down soon enough people are tired of bull crap and need
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:54.280]  solutions if you're not part of the solution you're let me start over if you're not part of it then
[3:11:54.280 --> 3:11:59.800]  you are a disruptor so he says if you are not part of it then you are a disruptor get ready for the
[3:11:59.800 --> 3:12:06.920]  new o generation one of responsibility and servitude for the greater good united states of america
[3:12:06.920 --> 3:12:14.040]  is the greatest country ever well servitude is not service service is what you choose to do for
[3:12:14.040 --> 3:12:21.480]  humanity and you choose how you do that servitude in the dictionary is slavery but that's what this
[3:12:21.480 --> 3:12:27.720]  fake service is this compulsory service it is slavery so this person's own ignorance shines
[3:12:27.720 --> 3:12:33.080]  through here and they inadvertently tell the truth and talk about servitude so we're taking
[3:12:33.080 --> 3:12:38.760]  your phone calls seeing what you think of iraq h obama is he a judo scout is he a frontman is
[3:12:38.760 --> 3:12:45.240]  he a betrayer let's go to anthony and georgia anthony what's your take on barack obama okay alex
[3:12:45.240 --> 3:12:51.240]  if i'm not talking to you um basically i compare brock obama to a vampire and he's like the black
[3:12:51.240 --> 3:13:00.120]  vampire like on the 1995 movie with eddie murphy a vampire in brooklyn because of his african policy
[3:13:00.120 --> 3:13:08.760]  and african is basically u.s afghan defense ministry and on february 6 of 2007 the defense
[3:13:08.760 --> 3:13:14.520]  secretary robert gates during the bush administration with the same defense secretary obama carried
[3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:22.840]  over declared his operations in africa under the title of african and then on february 10 four days
[3:13:22.840 --> 3:13:29.160]  later obama announces his candidacy for president and so you know a lot of people are thinking well
[3:13:29.160 --> 3:13:33.000]  it's just a poor continent with a whole bunch of third world countries out there so it doesn't
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:38.680]  matter but they don't realize a big picture afghan has the most abundant natural resources the most
[3:13:38.680 --> 3:13:46.120]  abundant amount of gold the most abundant amount of natural gas most abundant amount of diamonds
[3:13:46.120 --> 3:13:54.280]  the most abundant amount of pure metals such as iron and such as steel than any other landmass
[3:13:54.280 --> 3:14:01.560]  on the planet earth and throughout history every empire has dreamed of controlling africa
[3:14:01.560 --> 3:14:05.960]  because the emperor knows as soon as they have control over africa they have all the natural
[3:14:05.960 --> 3:14:11.080]  resources and have all the manpower they need to conquer the world well let me let me interrupt
[3:14:11.080 --> 3:14:16.840]  and elaborate on that they have north com the military jurisdiction over the united states
[3:14:16.840 --> 3:14:21.480]  openly being set up for marshal law and 20 000 combat troops to be used against the american people
[3:14:21.480 --> 3:14:24.920]  that's being announced so they set up homeland security and then turn it against the people
[3:14:24.920 --> 3:14:30.280]  what it was meant to do along bush continues he passes the baton to obama he continues the same
[3:14:30.280 --> 3:14:37.480]  policy and yes they want instead of south com or north com or sent com over different regions of
[3:14:37.480 --> 3:14:43.080]  the world they're setting up african and they're admitting that the u.s forces need to go into
[3:14:43.080 --> 3:14:47.720]  africa now you made another point though that i want you to elaborate on and repeat today
[3:14:48.440 --> 3:14:54.680]  because uh we weren't recording then and you got cut off i want to put it in the film uh continue
[3:14:54.680 --> 3:15:00.360]  sir with your analogy of uh they're looking through the people uh but i mean in your own words repeat that
[3:15:01.080 --> 3:15:08.440]  right uh they put the face of brock obama as uh part of their their public relations because
[3:15:08.440 --> 3:15:13.960]  it's like the old folk tales about vampires uh vampire cannot force his way into somebody's
[3:15:13.960 --> 3:15:19.960]  house again it's against some kind of metaphysical law so the vampire has to persuade the resident
[3:15:19.960 --> 3:15:25.240]  of the household to open the door and invite him in so they're going to look at the people
[3:15:25.240 --> 3:15:30.520]  at brock obama which looks like them and appears to be on their side they're going to say okay here's
[3:15:30.520 --> 3:15:36.440]  my ally let me open the door and let me let uh this person in and then brock obama is just a
[3:15:36.440 --> 3:15:41.640]  course of frontman for the american empire where he's going to have the entire u.s navy the entire
[3:15:41.640 --> 3:15:47.720]  u.s army and the entire u.s marines under african command and of course he's going to turn it into
[3:15:47.720 --> 3:15:52.280]  a new iraq and he's going to turn it into a new afghanistan everything every operation that you
[3:15:52.280 --> 3:15:58.680]  see going on iraq in afghanistan is going to propagate to the poor countries of africa and
[3:15:58.680 --> 3:16:03.960]  well sir sir i agree with sir i agree with you they're looking to the people they see a handsome
[3:16:03.960 --> 3:16:09.400]  smiling african face you know he's all hey i'm from kenya and then it's a total bait and switch
[3:16:09.400 --> 3:16:14.200]  but it's the same thing here in the united states where they would get sell out uh native american
[3:16:14.200 --> 3:16:22.040]  chiefs to sell out their people this is the oldest trick in the book and he can also pacify uh the
[3:16:22.040 --> 3:16:26.200]  most downtrodden minority groups in the united states and he's saying hey get ready for sacrifice
[3:16:26.200 --> 3:16:30.920]  get ready to lose your standard living they're like yay i love obama they could never get away
[3:16:30.920 --> 3:16:37.240]  with this with the john mccain and so absolutely right talking to uh folks in your community are
[3:16:37.240 --> 3:16:43.160]  they waking up i'm trying to talk to some people i actually know a lot of afghan immigrants here
[3:16:43.160 --> 3:16:48.440]  and you know and they're just ecstatic uh brock obama's elected president even in kenya i talked
[3:16:48.440 --> 3:16:52.840]  to a king and they actually have a brock obama day now they marked on the calendar they're
[3:16:52.840 --> 3:16:57.080]  celebrating his birthday and i'm trying to tell him in four years you're going to raise that
[3:16:57.080 --> 3:17:03.080]  calendar you're not going to say did you see god did you see the first thing did you see the first
[3:17:03.080 --> 3:17:08.680]  thing brock obama did when he got elected is he doubled the quote family planning uh which is really
[3:17:08.680 --> 3:17:15.000]  eugenics the inoculations uh the birth control the abortions in africa and then he's funding forced
[3:17:15.000 --> 3:17:22.280]  abortions in china and even the liberal huffington post decried that so uh he's bringing death to
[3:17:22.280 --> 3:17:27.560]  africa and i agree they need him to continue their operation because africa's been saying
[3:17:27.560 --> 3:17:33.320]  no to gmo food no to the inoculations no to the planned parenthood they have figured it out they've
[3:17:33.320 --> 3:17:38.760]  got african nobel laureates saying hiv was invented the documents have been declassified so africa's
[3:17:38.760 --> 3:17:45.960]  waking up and the establishment needs brock obama i totally agree with you exactly and in my uh
[3:17:45.960 --> 3:17:50.840]  analysis it seems like america's still in the page from history because the romans did the exact
[3:17:50.840 --> 3:17:58.920]  same thing there was a man named septima severus and from 145 ad to 111 ad he was the first roman
[3:17:58.920 --> 3:18:05.800]  emperor born of the afghan province of rome and guess what he was a mulatto his father was of
[3:18:05.800 --> 3:18:12.600]  like the libyan descent from the birbir tribe and his mother was the italian descent of the roman
[3:18:13.240 --> 3:18:21.160]  lineage and of course he pushed the roman empire further into syria went on into the um the um
[3:18:22.200 --> 3:18:27.080]  further east in the syria and also conquered further west in the britainian area and he increased
[3:18:27.080 --> 3:18:37.480]  roman legions from 25 to 33 sovereign legions of the empire rome so it looks like they're doing
[3:18:37.480 --> 3:18:44.440]  the same thing all over again they're getting somebody and and from his own uh uh literature
[3:18:44.440 --> 3:18:50.200]  and from people who were critiquing him he seemed to be harsher on the afghan people than the uh
[3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:57.480]  and then the natural born european presence of the roman empire in africa so they're getting their own
[3:18:57.480 --> 3:19:02.680]  kind to turn on their own kind pretty much they always get a native born person of the tribe they
[3:19:02.680 --> 3:19:07.960]  want to betray to be the betrayers because they'll be trusted more and they'll have more open doors
[3:19:07.960 --> 3:19:12.600]  toward them and that's exactly what's going to happen uh towards afghan and you know my heart
[3:19:12.600 --> 3:19:17.480]  goes out to them because you know it even though i don't know them by name because of course i don't
[3:19:17.480 --> 3:19:23.240]  even know my last name still you know all tribalism aside i feel a connection to every person on this
[3:19:23.240 --> 3:19:29.880]  world and uh black white red yellow you know we all need to come together and stop this exactly and
[3:19:29.880 --> 3:19:35.160]  that's why i can't buy into the hype in the name of false brotherhood and say i'm endorsing obama
[3:19:35.160 --> 3:19:39.640]  just for feel good i have a responsibility to reach out to everybody and tell them the truth

[3:24:38.280 --> 3:24:43.880]  have gone to universities and stuff and because of guests like alan watt that you have on and i
[3:24:43.880 --> 3:24:49.640]  really i owe you so much and even the faith that you've given that you've just you speak about and

[3:24:54.920 --> 3:24:59.880]  owe you my life thank you very much alex um the only thing i have to disagree with is the comment
[3:24:59.880 --> 3:25:04.520]  section at the end of your articles i find all of your articles so empowering i read through them
[3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:09.320]  and then like everybody i scroll through every comment and by the end of that i'm just so tired
[3:25:09.320 --> 3:25:14.280]  from the disinformation that's on there and even i've noticed in your show you spend so much time
[3:25:14.280 --> 3:25:19.880]  just speaking about all that disinformation it's just taking so much energy away from us stop stop
[3:25:19.880 --> 3:25:25.480]  stop stop for just a minute look if i go to a youtube video with our trailer posted with almost
[3:25:25.480 --> 3:25:30.760]  70 000 views in two days and i point out that this person says that we're right wing and how dare
[3:25:30.760 --> 3:25:35.880]  us not expose bush out of ignorance we're showing that they're ignorant and we're showing that he
[3:25:35.880 --> 3:25:40.680]  says it's one of responsibility and servitude they're saying we're going to be slaves and i'm
[3:25:40.680 --> 3:25:45.960]  pointing out that they think slavery is freedom so i don't think that's spending time on disinformation
[3:25:45.960 --> 3:25:51.160]  that's spending time looking at what people are doing you know we don't censor info wars.com and
[3:25:51.160 --> 3:25:56.520]  prisonpunna.com in the comment sections but the disinformation all day accuses us of it as they're
[3:25:56.520 --> 3:26:01.720]  there posting now there is some problems with our servers and caching and wordpress and i can't
[3:26:01.720 --> 3:26:07.960]  still post at my house to my websites for some reason uh we do have things like uh you know
[3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:12.520]  kill the president uh erased uh you know you know though there's a few words that are blocked but
[3:26:12.520 --> 3:26:17.640]  there's not people actively in there uh uh you know censoring it so we let them go on and lie
[3:26:17.640 --> 3:26:23.560]  about us and say horrible things about us and uh you know do terrible things and you know we leave
[3:26:23.560 --> 3:26:29.560]  it up when somebody puts a link to uh where i live uh except it's not where i live so i kind of feel
[3:26:29.560 --> 3:26:35.000]  sorry for whoever lives there there's a lot of alex jones is in this world uh but including four of
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:40.760]  them in austin uh but alex jones called me like two weeks ago and said i had somebody come knock on
[3:26:40.760 --> 3:26:45.080]  my door what the hell can't you make on me hey man i'm sorry that's that this this bad person doing
[3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:52.440]  this is not me uh and you know we had to take things like uh k il l obama we had to take that
[3:26:52.440 --> 3:26:56.920]  we had to ban that term because i had a secret service out here twice uh but other than that you
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:01.560]  you know we did the comment sections for the first amendment even though it's our site we
[3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:06.440]  can do whatever we want to open it up and have debate and so it does let the dis info in and
[3:27:06.440 --> 3:27:10.680]  does let them do that but it makes the sites bigger more dynamic more popular that they've only
[3:27:10.680 --> 3:27:16.680]  grown since we've done it and it's the big boy world big boy pants time and uh people uh are
[3:27:17.240 --> 3:27:22.360]  learning about the dis info and the answer to all the dis info in there is go in there with a good
[3:27:22.360 --> 3:27:28.120]  as a good person and post documents post news articles post stories post information and don't
[3:27:28.120 --> 3:27:32.680]  feed the trolls as they say uh when i get up on air and occasionally mention it it's not to feed
[3:27:32.680 --> 3:27:37.560]  trolls it's to point out that this person isn't a troll i mean a troll is not going to say it's
[3:27:37.560 --> 3:27:43.080]  time for us to be in servitude this isn't even sarcasm this is an ignorant person so i'm just
[3:27:43.080 --> 3:27:48.440]  illustrating their mental bondage when i do that but you know maybe you're right uh you know maybe i
[3:27:48.440 --> 3:27:55.640]  should get rid of the message board and then the message board does have uh some censorship in it
[3:27:55.640 --> 3:28:01.480]  because i shut that up and we had a few moderators on there because people were saying the same thing
[3:28:01.480 --> 3:28:05.880]  go kill this person go kill that person i had the police calling me four or five years ago so i
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:10.760]  picked a few moderators i think some of them may go overboard sometimes and i've even called a few
[3:28:10.760 --> 3:28:13.720]  of the moderators you know they don't really work for us just people that we've seen have a good
[3:28:13.720 --> 3:28:19.240]  track record and say hey you know let folks attack me in there do that but uh there are no moderators
[3:28:19.240 --> 3:28:25.160]  on the info wars in prison planet and people are in there going crazy uh but uh that's what freedom
[3:28:25.160 --> 3:28:30.200]  looks like and uh i mean what am i supposed to do you know there's sent com guys on there saying
[3:28:30.200 --> 3:28:34.840]  they're going to write my wife i mean i you know i mean that's who they are it really shows us who
[3:28:34.840 --> 3:28:39.800]  they are they kind of discredit themselves don't you think yes sir thank you very much for answering
[3:28:39.800 --> 3:28:45.240]  my question and just real quick i just wanted to mention that i i really think atheism is a
[3:28:45.240 --> 3:28:49.960]  a new form of a soft kill weapon and uh there's just so much research has been done that yeah it is
[3:28:49.960 --> 3:28:55.000]  it makes you it makes you not be tied into your higher consciousness it makes you just think that
[3:28:55.000 --> 3:29:00.280]  you're just a machine off pheromones and ideas and you only love your baby because of oxytocin
[3:29:01.160 --> 3:29:05.880]  and you know none of this stuff is real and it's all hormones so if they kill masses of us it's no
[3:29:05.880 --> 3:29:11.400]  big deal they're great scientists yes it's a way to kill your natural instinct to survive
[3:29:11.400 --> 3:29:15.720]  they're trying to turn that instinct off turn the family off so they can have superiority
[3:29:17.320 --> 3:29:20.120]  thank you very much Alex i owe you my life thank you my friend
[3:29:20.120 --> 3:29:25.480]  well i mean how did you awaken when when when we explain that being on drugs being in the system
[3:29:25.480 --> 3:29:30.120]  lets the enemy win and it's not radical and cool it's radical and cool to be upright and strong
[3:29:30.120 --> 3:29:36.520]  and focused and informed well i just never had any positive role male models and i remember hitting
[3:29:36.520 --> 3:29:41.960]  rock bottom i really remember what that's like and and just feeling completely powerless uneducated

[3:35:24.920 --> 3:35:31.080]  protect it okay sir give us your testimony of waking up getting in power getting out of the
[3:35:31.080 --> 3:35:36.760]  system getting out of all the modes of control they try to put over you go ahead thank you that
[3:35:36.760 --> 3:35:41.720]  song was awesome but i do remember hitting rock bottom and that's there's nothing worse than
[3:35:42.600 --> 3:35:48.040]  waking up not having any education barely knowing how to read or write and uh being in the system
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:52.200]  and and trying to get out and having everybody in your life all of your friends stealing that
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:57.400]  lifestyle and trying to overcome that but the only thing that allowed me to do that is having the
[3:35:57.400 --> 3:36:01.880]  desire and the want to do that you know i wanted to become educated i wanted to know how to read
[3:36:01.880 --> 3:36:07.960]  and write i wanted to find the truth and honestly you are one of the reasons i followed through
[3:36:07.960 --> 3:36:13.400]  on that and i got access to more information but i i have to admit i did follow a lot of like
[3:36:14.520 --> 3:36:19.560]  disinfo books and on how to become more awakened and stuff and you know all the disinformation
[3:36:19.560 --> 3:36:24.120]  stuff but but that's what happens that's all part of the process then you develop a palette
[3:36:24.120 --> 3:36:29.080]  to tell us absolutely absolutely and i just have to say one of your guests alan what he's the
[3:36:29.080 --> 3:36:34.360]  absolute source for amazing information and uh if you just listen to all of his lectures you'd be
[3:36:34.360 --> 3:36:39.640]  more educated than anyone with a phd you know that's just my take on that just absolutely genius guy
[3:36:39.640 --> 3:36:44.760]  that's why we have a thing yet you just have to want it alex and i'm proof of that you have to
[3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:48.200]  want to get better you have to want to educate yourself and when you do it there's nothing
[3:36:48.200 --> 3:36:53.160]  more empowering than knowing who your enemies are um how you're getting suckered and i love it
[3:36:53.160 --> 3:36:58.120]  i love being awake alex and the new world order is never going to break me i'm telling you that
[3:36:58.120 --> 3:37:03.960]  right now never absolutely good to hear from you okay let's go to anti-illuminati in nevada
[3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:09.320]  you're on the air go ahead oh alex thanks for taking my call this is uh anti-illuminati from
[3:37:09.320 --> 3:37:16.120]  your prison planet forum message board um main topic i want to touch on is p-tech and uh
[3:37:16.120 --> 3:37:24.040]  uh the mind control um technology that exists but before i do that i want to uh have a little
[3:37:24.040 --> 3:37:28.920]  message for a certain group of people that serve the new world order and that's the people that
[3:37:28.920 --> 3:37:34.440]  work at a department of public safety in every state that are uh that thing that they're providing
[3:37:34.440 --> 3:37:40.840]  for the security of people by entering all these people into sex offender registry databases
[3:37:40.840 --> 3:37:47.880]  is you people have been exposed your your departments are all under north com okay anyone
[3:37:47.880 --> 3:37:52.440]  can just type in northern command and department of public safety you'll get thousands of hits
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:58.040]  all there you've got all these different databases called justice exchange alert express sonar
[3:37:59.240 --> 3:38:05.240]  and here's the thing about all this stuff this all all the system all the computer systems in
[3:38:05.240 --> 3:38:11.080]  the world of of all the basically all the big corporations and military they're they're all
[3:38:11.800 --> 3:38:19.960]  compromised from the p-tech software that was used to facilitate the 9-11 attacks that was
[3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:26.280]  installed on the f-a computers in norad by felix roush yes globalist top computer programmers
[3:38:27.080 --> 3:38:33.320]  okay so the underlying thing about the new world order's scientific dictatorship to be more specific
[3:38:33.320 --> 3:38:40.520]  a lot of it is a computer dictatorship no i know that it's it's a unified grid they built the system
[3:38:40.520 --> 3:38:44.840]  they have all the back doors and then all the major keys to the back doors are held by israel
[3:38:45.560 --> 3:38:52.920]  yep and um they can you know if they wanted to adjust they can basically uh they could
[3:38:52.920 --> 3:39:00.200]  they could cause any airliner to crash in the world after 9-11 rafion got all these contracts
[3:39:00.200 --> 3:39:07.560]  on a global basis for example they they were contracted out to uh um to revamp the air traffic
[3:39:07.560 --> 3:39:13.960]  control systems of the bowser airport and beg dad so it's like hey we'll keep you safe but guess
[3:39:13.960 --> 3:39:20.840]  but yeah we we're we're gonna we you know we're basically living in a in a in a real life version
[3:39:20.840 --> 3:39:25.720]  of live free or die hard i mean these you know if the if the american people are going to retake
[3:39:25.720 --> 3:39:32.600]  their government back or any or any nation part of the part of doing that is you're gonna you know
[3:39:32.600 --> 3:39:40.200]  this this system has to be has to be exposed and shut down that's right they use films like that
[3:39:40.200 --> 3:39:43.800]  where the one government guy you know steals all the money out of the bank accounts and now look
[3:39:43.800 --> 3:39:47.720]  what the bankers are actually doing they're stealing all the money out of the bank accounts and then
[3:39:47.720 --> 3:39:52.600]  posing as the savers saying make us world government powers make us the new world order will fix it
[3:39:52.600 --> 3:39:56.520]  and it's even in the wall street journal saying oh we're gonna have a new america a new north american
[3:39:56.520 --> 3:40:01.000]  union it's a new idea we just got to save the economy how many years did i say they didn't blow
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:06.440]  the economy offer the north american union that that's how they'd sell it and now after denying it
[3:40:06.440 --> 3:40:10.520]  they're now announcing it because it means they're about to try to publicly bring it in
[3:40:10.520 --> 3:40:15.960]  it's already there it's already operating in its high treason and it's really the people need to
[3:40:15.960 --> 3:40:21.960]  look at i mean i urge anybody to go on your forum and just search for p-tech you don't i mean there's
[3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:26.920]  i post a lot of stuff on there i've got almost a thousand post total i did a lot of research on it
[3:40:27.480 --> 3:40:32.280]  it's extremely important because it explains you know a lot of people they have a they can't
[3:40:32.280 --> 3:40:36.920]  really understand well how are these how is a new world order so powerful the state police the local
[3:40:36.920 --> 3:40:41.800]  police are all under north com in the threat integration fusion centers and now they're
[3:40:41.800 --> 3:40:48.200]  announcing on to the fusion centers they built or are building giant fema camps where pastors
[3:40:48.200 --> 3:40:53.240]  will oversee us and we're again the economy will bankrupt first they'll put people in them
[3:40:53.240 --> 3:40:56.680]  who want to be there and then they'll advertise that and condition everybody
[3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:01.000]  to accept it that's what's so incredible about this new legislation because they
[3:41:01.000 --> 3:41:05.320]  admitted all exactly as i broke it down because i was looking at all the pieces
[3:41:06.120 --> 3:41:09.480]  and then i said when they get ready to really prepare to use this
[3:41:10.280 --> 3:41:13.640]  or when they get ready to attempt to use this they will roll it out not we're putting you
[3:41:13.640 --> 3:41:20.280]  in a death camp but oh it's an emergency center for your safety protected by the police and they're
[3:41:20.280 --> 3:41:24.920]  doing it i appreciate your call sir good to hear from you talk to that guy for hours but
[3:41:24.920 --> 3:41:30.840]  we've got to get to other callers lin in connecticut you're on the air worldwide hello hey lin
[3:41:30.840 --> 3:41:36.120]  yes hi alex thank you i just want to say you're a great honor to our nation and we love you
[3:41:36.120 --> 3:41:40.840]  um before i get to the feeba camps i'll be quick with you um you talk about the preachers i i i
[3:41:40.840 --> 3:41:46.600]  happen to have joined the society it's true i'm a traditionalist catholic and you probably never
[3:41:46.600 --> 3:41:51.400]  heard of bishops williamson and but he speaks out against the new world order all the time so i'm
[3:41:51.400 --> 3:41:56.920]  happy i finally belong to a church that speaks out against you know what's going on and um he's
[3:41:56.920 --> 3:42:01.240]  telling us like what to do do you think we need to like have backpacks and like go into hiding
[3:42:01.240 --> 3:42:08.840]  and everything or no we don't fight like the dickens now to expose the agenda to speak because
[3:42:08.840 --> 3:42:13.640]  this is a very unpopular criminal agenda we have to know how they're going to roll their agenda out
[3:42:14.440 --> 3:42:18.680]  we have to know how they're always going to put a nice face on it we have to say no no no no no
[3:42:18.680 --> 3:42:22.360]  and scream bloody murder then they won't be able to get this agenda through this i mean they may
[3:42:22.360 --> 3:42:26.840]  have them you know the the high ground with the power and the money but we have the high ground
[3:42:26.840 --> 3:42:31.240]  spiritually and in the right and we have the people and the folks are now waking up and this
[3:42:31.240 --> 3:42:38.840]  obama of delusions already starting to fade somewhat and it's going to only fade faster uh so but yes
[3:42:38.840 --> 3:42:44.600]  be prepared that that if they start saying well do the rioting and the breakdown of no food
[3:42:44.600 --> 3:42:48.600]  they're going to make you if they decide to pull the trigger on this we expose them enough they
[3:42:48.600 --> 3:42:52.760]  put up trial balloons as they're doing now they may back off and then keep building and waiting
[3:42:52.760 --> 3:42:57.320]  for a future date see we're backing them off but now it looks like we've backed them off backed
[3:42:57.320 --> 3:43:02.280]  them off backed them off but now they're just you know it appears that they're going to go ahead
[3:43:02.280 --> 3:43:07.720]  and launch in the next six months to two years it appears i mean this is one of the final pieces
[3:43:07.720 --> 3:43:14.040]  of the puzzle when they come out and announce yes camps for your safety camps happy fun places but
[3:43:14.040 --> 3:43:20.040]  you'll have to work in the camps because the economy's bad service so you have to be ready
[3:43:20.040 --> 3:43:23.640]  that if things are breaking down and falling apart you won't have to go to the super dome to be
[3:43:23.640 --> 3:43:27.560]  loaded on trucks and helicopters to be taken to a fema camp or you have to be ready to be
[3:43:27.560 --> 3:43:31.960]  self-sufficient and then they'll come through in phase two and try to confiscate your guns
[3:43:31.960 --> 3:43:35.800]  and take you to a camp because you're not allowed to stay at that point you have to say
[3:43:36.680 --> 3:43:40.440]  and and it'll still be on radio and tv there'll still be some power in areas and you know if
[3:43:40.440 --> 3:43:45.160]  they go with this operation and it'll you'll see the camps the people eating food watching obama
[3:43:45.160 --> 3:43:50.280]  on big screen tv's you know on the outside areas and living in tents and and portable buildings and
[3:43:50.280 --> 3:43:54.440]  you know it'll show kids on jump ropes hey the emergency fema center it's great
[3:43:54.440 --> 3:43:57.880]  and it will be great except for those being taken off to the back 40 and
[3:43:57.880 --> 3:44:03.800]  you know putting an acid bath or killed or flown to a black site but no they're gonna
[3:44:03.800 --> 3:44:10.280]  pr the camps you gotta ask when that truck pulls up uh are you gonna go to the camp no
[3:44:11.080 --> 3:44:16.760]  and uh at that point you know god helps those that helps themselves and uh and uh
[3:44:16.760 --> 3:44:22.600]  uh that's the point where it's lock and load time oh okay good it's good to know
[3:44:24.200 --> 3:44:28.040]  and that's when it's lock and load and i mean we're not looking for this it's not a fun
[3:44:28.040 --> 3:44:32.840]  thing i have anything i'm not going to a camp where some piece of filth guard it's gonna
[3:44:32.840 --> 3:44:36.840]  break my family up and take me off for interrogations they can torture me for two years and put me
[3:44:36.840 --> 3:44:42.680]  on tv saying you know that i was a bank robber it ain't happened and uh that's it i'm committed
[3:44:42.680 --> 3:44:46.200]  you know i mean that's the way it is you know i'm not out there offensively doing anything
[3:44:46.200 --> 3:44:51.960]  i'm not getting on an army truck i'm not going anywhere and we have to commit and say that's it
[3:44:52.760 --> 3:44:57.320]  you know we're not going to your stinking camps you said didn't exist and now oh we just built
[3:44:57.320 --> 3:45:03.000]  them to save you they just popped up like mushrooms after a rain uh it's just brand new because of
[3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:11.800]  the economic problem i know yeah you're right absolutely i feel bad because so many people
[3:45:11.800 --> 3:45:16.680]  i talk to they they don't believe you know well they're going to say but obama says it's for our
[3:45:16.680 --> 3:45:21.880]  safety oh and then again if they can't get their agenda through that will be a victory for us it
[3:45:21.880 --> 3:45:25.720]  won't happen under obama it'll happen under swartz and agar whoever comes next and then
