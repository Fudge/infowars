[00:00.000 --> 00:17.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars is live.
[00:17.360 --> 00:21.560]  On this Tuesday, June 22nd, 2021, this is the Alex Jones show.
[00:21.560 --> 00:23.360]  Owen Schreuer sitting in for Alex today.
[00:23.360 --> 00:25.360]  He's going to be on his way back to the studio.
[00:25.360 --> 00:31.520]  They even pop in before the end of the transmission.
[00:31.520 --> 00:43.360]  And if you can understand what is in the stars here with this constellation of news
[00:43.360 --> 00:53.280]  that I have, and if you can identify the picture, then you see the current path that humanity
[00:53.280 --> 00:59.560]  is on and how it's been documented throughout history.
[00:59.560 --> 01:06.060]  It's been written and played out in science fiction.
[01:06.060 --> 01:18.840]  And we are now in the opening stages of 21st century tyranny, slavery, oppression, the
[01:18.840 --> 01:26.040]  likes of which human history perhaps has never seen before because it can be on a global
[01:26.040 --> 01:34.040]  scale with the new technology that has shrunk the world.
[01:34.040 --> 01:39.640]  And if you took a look at each star or each news story that I'm going to put together
[01:39.640 --> 01:44.200]  in this constellation, it may not seem like much.
[01:44.200 --> 01:56.960]  But when you see how each of the stars connect and then you see the picture, you understand
[01:56.960 --> 02:05.880]  why it's so imperative that this has to be stopped.
[02:05.880 --> 02:15.360]  But the intellectual hurdle that we have is that we realize there's something on top
[02:15.360 --> 02:20.240]  of all of us, whether you're left, right, center, conservative, liberal, black, white,
[02:20.240 --> 02:26.240]  brown, you know, all these other boxes that people end up in or get put in, there's something
[02:26.240 --> 02:31.560]  bigger sitting on top of all of us, an elite, secret society, been in control of the world
[02:31.560 --> 02:33.600]  for centuries.
[02:33.600 --> 02:36.840]  These have been propagandized for thousands of years.
[02:36.840 --> 02:40.520]  Who knows what kind of scientific tests have been running us at a mass scale like what
[02:40.520 --> 02:44.480]  we're seeing right now with COVID.
[02:44.480 --> 02:51.640]  But see, that's the big esoteric existential stuff that's sitting out there, the secret
[02:51.640 --> 03:01.400]  histories, the race for life extension, the race to be multidimensional, the race to capture
[03:01.400 --> 03:08.360]  unlimited and harness unlimited energy, and then the elites that have been in that battle
[03:08.360 --> 03:19.880]  for decades and centuries, perhaps millennia, waging war on humanity, keeping us divided
[03:19.880 --> 03:27.320]  so that we can be easily conquered at any stage of our development or evolution.
[03:27.320 --> 03:38.520]  And so our intellectual hurdle is that even though the challenge is to identify and discover
[03:38.520 --> 03:45.360]  all of that secret information and understanding and history, and then the real elite that
[03:45.360 --> 03:54.240]  sit on top of all of us exposed, we can't even get through this hurdle of fighting ourselves
[03:54.240 --> 04:01.360]  to even have the collective consciousness to achieve a higher consciousness and be able
[04:01.360 --> 04:07.840]  to wage war against the secret societies, the social engineers, the engineers of the
[04:07.840 --> 04:18.600]  planet, the people that would make a decision to intentionally poison the food and the water
[04:18.600 --> 04:23.920]  and the medicine.
[04:23.920 --> 04:36.360]  And so I get frustrated because I'll spend six hours on air talking about the left because
[04:36.360 --> 04:43.580]  that's an actual hurdle in our way right now politically of achieving a higher consciousness
[04:43.580 --> 04:48.760]  because they're playing games and they're lost in a world that doesn't exist.
[04:48.760 --> 04:51.160]  And we just want to get real about things.
[04:51.160 --> 04:54.160]  And they're sitting here playing games like children.
[04:54.160 --> 04:59.120]  So how do we get over that hurdle?
[04:59.120 --> 05:05.480]  Scientists agree magnesium is the most important co-factor in the body regulating and controlling
[05:05.480 --> 05:07.840]  hundreds of pathways.
[05:07.840 --> 05:11.000]  Magnesium is required for your body to do the following.
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.920]  Helps convert food into energy, helps with muscle contraction function, helps regulate
[05:16.920 --> 05:22.160]  the nervous system, helps with protein building in the muscles and so much more.
[05:22.160 --> 05:27.920]  And now it's available in this concentrated form of ionized, fizzy magnesium.
[05:27.920 --> 05:29.120]  It tastes great.
[05:29.120 --> 05:31.840]  I take it in the morning, I take it in the evening.
[05:31.840 --> 05:36.920]  It is so essential in my life and I hope all of you will check it out and try it.
[05:36.920 --> 05:40.080]  It's available at infowarstore.com right now.
[05:40.080 --> 05:43.760]  This is the best formula from our research you're going to find out there.
[05:43.760 --> 05:47.880]  So if you've already enjoyed other magnesium formulas, give this one a try.
[05:47.880 --> 05:52.000]  I think you're going to love it at the same time it funds the M4, which is a true 360
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  win.
[05:53.000 --> 06:04.520]  Now exclusively available at infowarstore.com for only $19.95.
[06:04.520 --> 06:11.080]  And now the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[06:11.080 --> 06:28.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars is live.
[06:28.680 --> 06:34.800]  Yes.
[06:34.800 --> 06:40.840]  Us just being on air right now frustrates the enemies of humanity.
[06:40.840 --> 06:46.120]  And so info wars lives in America lives on the great legend, the great test of free speech
[06:46.120 --> 06:52.800]  and human freedom on this Tuesday, June 22nd, 2021, Owen Schreuer sitting in on the Alex
[06:52.800 --> 06:55.080]  Jones show.
[06:55.080 --> 07:00.480]  We may be hearing from Alex before the end of the transmission.
[07:00.480 --> 07:11.200]  And I have a constellation of news stories today that really show you the picture of where
[07:11.200 --> 07:24.560]  we're going, humanity's current path and how the political left is being used in a very
[07:24.560 --> 07:32.000]  complex game of chess on planet Earth, how the current political left phenomenon and
[07:32.000 --> 07:44.400]  movement is being used as a Trojan horse to bring in worldwide tyranny and to corrupt
[07:44.400 --> 07:50.320]  the hearts and the souls and the minds of man so that it will be easier to conquer and
[07:50.320 --> 08:00.880]  enslave for this next revolution or evolution of human development where a breakaway elite
[08:00.880 --> 08:10.760]  technotronic kleptocratic society will be formed sitting on top of the ashes of society
[08:10.760 --> 08:19.240]  or the remains or the rubble of society that we live in today.
[08:19.240 --> 08:31.920]  And so there's a reason I build this up because it truly is like a great work of art.
[08:31.920 --> 08:39.760]  And so I'm going to really explain it in the next segment and then a report from Alex Jones
[08:39.760 --> 08:49.280]  Utopia 2020, which I haven't seen yet, but I have a feeling just in the five years and
[08:49.280 --> 08:58.840]  change that I've worked here with Alex that were probably synced up on a multi-dimensional
[08:58.840 --> 09:06.640]  level today and that the message is going to be resonating like a perfectly molded and
[09:06.640 --> 09:16.280]  crafted bell on top of the largest steeple in the largest church in your neighborhood
[09:16.280 --> 09:20.960]  and it will be ringing.
[09:20.960 --> 09:31.040]  But see, we have reached the point where the mask is being removed, the veil is being removed
[09:31.040 --> 09:44.200]  and where we're going can no longer be denied except by those who are now fully into a Stockholm
[09:44.200 --> 09:52.600]  syndrome psychological paralysis where they're paralyzed by their own pride, they can't admit
[09:52.600 --> 09:57.320]  they've been fooled, they can't admit they've been lied to, and if they admit it on one
[09:57.320 --> 10:08.280]  of the subjects then they have to admit it on all of the subjects so they can't go there.
[10:08.280 --> 10:17.760]  And you know, this is really why abortion is such a key issue because the very people
[10:17.760 --> 10:23.520]  who want to oppress you and bring in medical tyranny and bring in communism and end the
[10:23.520 --> 10:36.440]  idea of self-government and individualism, the only real legitimacy or the only momentum
[10:36.440 --> 10:41.040]  that they believe they have is they have a moral high ground, they're morally superior
[10:41.040 --> 10:42.040]  to you.
[10:42.040 --> 10:48.720]  But wait a second, you like chopping up babies, you're into human sacrifice, you're not coming
[10:48.720 --> 10:53.880]  at me from any moral high ground on any of these issues, I don't care how much you love
[10:53.880 --> 11:02.600]  gay people or minorities or whatever else your latest phenomenon trend is, if you don't
[11:02.600 --> 11:07.320]  even stand up for the unborn and the innocent then you have no moral high ground whatsoever
[11:07.320 --> 11:13.640]  and so all of their other moral high ground arguments disappear and then you realize they
[11:13.640 --> 11:19.440]  have no soapbox, no pedestal, nothing to stand on anymore.
[11:19.440 --> 11:23.840]  And that truly is why the abortion issue is so key because it removes their moral high
[11:23.840 --> 11:30.440]  ground, that's why they're so defensive of it.
[11:30.440 --> 11:38.640]  And so then they come at you and oh, you know, racism and homophobic and Islamophobic and
[11:38.640 --> 11:45.080]  all these, all these things that they make up in their mind which are really just their
[11:45.080 --> 11:50.400]  own problems, xenophobia, all these things.
[11:50.400 --> 11:54.920]  When they tell you hey, you need to talk about race relations or you need to talk about xenophobia
[11:54.920 --> 12:00.360]  or you need to talk about homophobia or LGBTQ plus rights and all this stuff, that's them
[12:00.360 --> 12:03.200]  projecting onto you what bothers them.
[12:03.200 --> 12:06.960]  They're the ones that have a problem with race relations, they're the ones that have
[12:06.960 --> 12:11.680]  a problem with their sexuality.
[12:11.680 --> 12:18.160]  They're the ones confused about why we have borders.
[12:18.160 --> 12:22.480]  These are all issues that they have to figure out and they're in this arrested development
[12:22.480 --> 12:27.120]  phase that they can't figure it out because of the poison in the food and the water and
[12:27.120 --> 12:30.560]  being mind controlled and brainwashed by television.
[12:30.560 --> 12:35.400]  So they're stuck in this arrested development loop while the rest of us have actually matured
[12:35.400 --> 12:40.360]  and grown up and want to actually live in reality, deal with common sense, have logic
[12:40.360 --> 12:41.600]  and reasoning.
[12:41.600 --> 12:46.720]  There will be discourse, there will be disagreements, there will be debates but we're all at least
[12:46.720 --> 12:51.600]  in the same level of consciousness and we have the same goals about where humanity wants
[12:51.600 --> 12:52.600]  to go.
[12:52.600 --> 12:57.520]  But see, when you fall for all the lies on television and when you fall for all the lies
[12:57.520 --> 13:04.520]  of Hollywood, you've been crippled and you can no longer walk for yourself.
[13:04.520 --> 13:09.400]  You can no longer think for yourself, talk for yourself.
[13:09.400 --> 13:17.520]  And so we have to sit here and watch them play these little games, mostly peaceful protests
[13:17.520 --> 13:21.200]  as cities burn all around the country.
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.000]  Oh, America's the most racist nation.
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.240]  America ended slavery.
[13:26.240 --> 13:27.400]  America's a melting pot.
[13:27.400 --> 13:29.200]  America's the least racist nation.
[13:29.200 --> 13:32.080]  Oh, there's voter suppression.
[13:32.080 --> 13:39.920]  You just had 20 million, a record number of voters in the United States in 2020's presidential
[13:39.920 --> 13:47.280]  election by 20 million, astronomical high voter suppression.
[13:47.280 --> 13:51.520]  White supremacists are the biggest problem in the United States of America, not according
[13:51.520 --> 13:55.960]  to the crime statistics.
[13:55.960 --> 14:01.520]  And so it's frustrating because we sit here and we just want to live in reality and we're
[14:01.520 --> 14:07.440]  dealing with these children that play these games and they don't even realize that they're
[14:07.440 --> 14:09.800]  affecting real people.
[14:09.800 --> 14:16.640]  Hey, your problem with race relations and wanting to teach critical race theory to children,
[14:16.640 --> 14:20.360]  those are actual lives.
[14:20.360 --> 14:24.280]  Those are actual kids that are going to have to grow up in a world that you created for
[14:24.280 --> 14:29.200]  them to be racist.
[14:29.200 --> 14:34.360]  We don't want to play these games anymore.
[14:34.360 --> 14:40.200]  We want to live in reality, but see, we're stuck here playing these games and big tech
[14:40.200 --> 14:46.000]  is censoring, mainstream media is censoring and lying and misleading.
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.080]  And now they're moving into the next phase of the global tyranny, which is just total
[14:51.080 --> 14:53.920]  control of the energy now.
[14:53.920 --> 15:00.360]  And that's why energy companies are announcing, you know, all those smart thermostats that
[15:00.360 --> 15:01.720]  you got with the app on your phone.
[15:01.720 --> 15:02.720]  Hey, it's cool.
[15:02.720 --> 15:06.720]  Look, you can move your AC around or heat around when you're not at home, it's plugged
[15:06.720 --> 15:07.720]  into the internet.
[15:07.720 --> 15:08.720]  Awesome.
[15:08.720 --> 15:09.720]  Oh, yep.
[15:09.720 --> 15:13.640]  Now the energy companies are going to be taking that over and deciding how much energy you
[15:13.640 --> 15:15.960]  get to use on a daily basis.
[15:15.960 --> 15:19.280]  See, that's the new world order.
[15:19.280 --> 15:20.720]  That's global tyranny.
[15:20.720 --> 15:24.880]  That's 21st century technotronic slavery.
[15:24.880 --> 15:33.120]  And we can't even come together to deal with that inevitable future because I'm sitting
[15:33.120 --> 15:37.200]  here having to deal with a group of people that want to teach your kid how to masturbate,
[15:37.200 --> 15:45.000]  put fake penises in their daughter's diaper, wave gay flags at military bases, have the
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.600]  front of the book section all about how to be gay for your kid.
[15:48.600 --> 15:53.040]  So they're playing these little games, meanwhile, they're pawns in a bigger game of chess and
[15:53.040 --> 15:54.040]  they don't even realize it.
[15:54.040 --> 16:00.320]  So I'm going to lay off this constellation of news when we come back.
[16:00.320 --> 16:02.320]  Your voice counts.
[16:02.320 --> 16:07.320]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[16:07.320 --> 16:09.920]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[16:09.920 --> 16:11.440]  They know you're angry.
[16:11.440 --> 16:15.720]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[16:15.720 --> 16:16.720]  we've got.
[16:16.720 --> 16:20.960]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can

[17:03.800 --> 17:11.320]  Here's a man who can show you.
[17:11.320 --> 17:18.320]  Here's a man who can show you.
[17:18.320 --> 17:27.320]  Here's a man who can show you.
[17:27.320 --> 17:48.320]  Here's a man who can show you.
[17:48.320 --> 17:58.320]  Here's a man who can show you.
[17:58.320 --> 18:02.920]  Three of our best selling products are now back in stock after months and months of not
[18:02.920 --> 18:07.320]  being available because of the COVID lockdowns that destroy the supply chain.
[18:07.320 --> 18:11.120]  Biotruce Selenium is the highest quality selenium from the mustard seed.
[18:11.120 --> 18:14.600]  It is essential for all cellular activity in the body.
[18:14.600 --> 18:17.720]  It's critical and it funds the info or it's back in stock.
[18:17.720 --> 18:21.560]  Then we have ultimate krill oil, highest grade of krill oil, all the things it does for your
[18:21.560 --> 18:25.560]  brain, your cardiovascular system, your memory, your sleep, everything.
[18:25.560 --> 18:26.560]  It's back in stock.
[18:26.560 --> 18:30.200]  And by the way, all these are discounted 40% to 50% off.
[18:30.200 --> 18:33.000]  But then one more other great item is now back in stock.
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.560]  We got a good shipment of it in, so we want to offer it the lowest price ever to experience
[18:36.560 --> 18:37.560]  the benefits.
[18:37.560 --> 18:43.120]  And that is Survival Shield X3 Tri-Iodine 60% off with free shipping double patria points.
[18:43.120 --> 18:45.760]  The other products are 50% off and 40% off.

[18:50.080 --> 18:55.480]  Selenium, X3 and ultimate krill oil back in stock at InfowarsStore.com and you can't
[18:55.480 --> 19:01.520]  lose because you also fund the Infowar.
[19:01.520 --> 19:22.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[19:22.320 --> 19:32.600]  21st century tyranny is on the rise and only and free men and women around the world stand
[19:32.600 --> 19:39.100]  against it and stop it.
[19:39.100 --> 19:42.120]  It works in a cycle.
[19:42.120 --> 19:51.800]  It's a cyclical procedure and in order to get it moving, you must insert the big lie.
[19:51.800 --> 20:01.040]  So, let me lay out now the constellation of where we're going with each of these little
[20:01.040 --> 20:06.880]  stars, each of these news stories here, and paint the picture of the future that is being
[20:06.880 --> 20:14.160]  built for us and how the left is being used as a Trojan horse to bring it in.
[20:14.160 --> 20:19.080]  And so, insert the big lie because where do you really begin here, like what is the start
[20:19.080 --> 20:20.080]  of a circle?
[20:20.080 --> 20:22.320]  I don't know, I guess it's just wherever you choose.
[20:22.320 --> 20:30.640]  So insert the big lie, January 6th insurrection.
[20:30.640 --> 20:35.640]  Now just for a quick recap, the documentaries are out, some footage has been leaked from
[20:35.640 --> 20:39.440]  inside, the government is still keeping that secret, the government is still keeping the
[20:39.440 --> 20:47.520]  names of the murderers who killed multiple people there in the police force or the people
[20:47.520 --> 20:50.120]  inside the police force that killed multiple Trump supporters that day.
[20:50.120 --> 20:54.040]  We have that video, Ashley Babbitt got shot, other people got pushed from a ledge, they
[20:54.040 --> 21:00.160]  were firing explosives into the crowd, one guy had nearly his face blown off.
[21:00.160 --> 21:03.320]  And so, you're not allowed to hear about any of that, that's not allowed to be in the media.
[21:03.320 --> 21:09.160]  Now again, if this happened in Minneapolis to a black guy, it'd be the biggest story
[21:09.160 --> 21:13.480]  for a year and cities would burn and there'd be riots and looting nationwide, which also
[21:13.480 --> 21:15.560]  comes into play here.
[21:15.560 --> 21:19.320]  So again, I'm just showing you the big lie, there was no insurrection, there's never
[21:19.320 --> 21:22.960]  been an insurrection that when people get a message from the government on their phones
[21:22.960 --> 21:27.440]  saying go home, they actually go home, no guns were found, that was a lie, no cops were
[21:27.440 --> 21:30.120]  killed that day by Trump supporters, that was a lie.
[21:30.120 --> 21:37.600]  The congressional vote that was going down was able to start up again within five hours,
[21:37.600 --> 21:38.600]  there was no insurrection.
[21:38.600 --> 21:42.800]  So boom, insert the big lie, okay.
[21:42.800 --> 21:51.400]  So now you have hundreds of people who have been arrested for being in DC on January 6th
[21:51.400 --> 21:53.720]  because of the big lie.
[21:53.720 --> 22:02.200]  And so the big lie is now what the tyrants and the authoritarians use to come scoop you
[22:02.200 --> 22:05.120]  up, literally, arrest you, bring you in, censor you.
[22:05.120 --> 22:06.120]  So you get arrested.
[22:06.120 --> 22:07.120]  Well, what comes next?
[22:07.120 --> 22:09.280]  And you see this in communist countries throughout history.
[22:09.280 --> 22:13.880]  Well, now that they've got their hands on you, well, they'll be merciful right now.
[22:13.880 --> 22:17.840]  They're just going to take you to a reeducation camp.
[22:17.840 --> 22:23.200]  And so here we go, a lawyer for January 6th defendants is giving her clients remedial
[22:23.200 --> 22:29.360]  lessons in American history, making them read books, do book reports, watch movies, reflect
[22:29.360 --> 22:35.840]  on the capital attacks and their role in it and what they represent, it's called reeducation
[22:35.840 --> 22:39.480]  camps.
[22:39.480 --> 22:41.240]  They do it in China.
[22:41.240 --> 22:43.240]  They did it in Nazi Germany.
[22:43.240 --> 22:45.040]  Now they're doing it here.
[22:45.040 --> 22:46.160]  And who's doing it?
[22:46.160 --> 22:47.160]  The left.
[22:47.160 --> 22:48.160]  Why?
[22:48.160 --> 22:50.160]  Because they fell for the big lie.
[22:50.160 --> 22:51.680]  Or they like the big lie.
[22:51.680 --> 22:56.160]  They like playing along with the big lie because they're filled with hatred of January 6th.
[22:56.160 --> 23:00.520]  And so now, again, I'm just showing you the constellation of stars so you can see the
[23:00.520 --> 23:01.640]  bigger picture.
[23:01.640 --> 23:03.640]  So here's the reeducation.
[23:03.640 --> 23:07.120]  Oh, you think Trump won the election?
[23:07.120 --> 23:08.520]  Come sit down.
[23:08.520 --> 23:11.560]  We need to reeducate you.
[23:11.560 --> 23:14.720]  Oh, you don't think Trump was a racist?
[23:14.720 --> 23:16.880]  Oh, you don't think Biden's legitimate?
[23:16.880 --> 23:18.720]  Oh, you think Hunter Biden's laptop is real?
[23:18.720 --> 23:20.400]  Oh, we need to sit you down.
[23:20.400 --> 23:22.000]  Oh, you don't want to sit down?
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.440]  Well, we have straps.
[23:24.440 --> 23:25.800]  We have sedatives too.
[23:25.800 --> 23:29.200]  So why don't you just come with us and be re-edimacated?
[23:29.200 --> 23:32.000]  So there you go.
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.360]  But now, you're considered the criminal because you don't go with the big lie that Biden
[23:37.360 --> 23:39.240]  won the election.
[23:39.240 --> 23:40.240]  So they put out their big lie.
[23:40.240 --> 23:44.600]  If you don't believe it, they come mop you up, take you to a reeducation camp.
[23:44.600 --> 23:49.920]  But what about the other criminals out there?
[23:49.920 --> 23:54.680]  Charges against hundreds of New York City rioters and looters have been dropped.
[23:54.680 --> 23:58.320]  So you know those videos that you've seen from New York where buildings are burning
[23:58.320 --> 24:01.680]  and all the windows are smashed in and people getting their heads beaten in the streets
[24:01.680 --> 24:07.640]  and billions of dollars of damage and who knows how much worth of goods stolen.
[24:07.640 --> 24:12.240]  Yeah, if you took place in that, all the charges have been dropped and you were already released
[24:12.240 --> 24:14.920]  from jail too.
[24:14.920 --> 24:20.560]  And they're even so bold to admit they don't have time to deal with all these rioters
[24:20.560 --> 24:29.720]  and looters because they're focusing on Donald Trump's taxes.
[24:29.720 --> 24:35.160]  So Donald Trump, an innocent man being investigated in New York, but all the violent criminals
[24:35.160 --> 24:38.240]  being released.
[24:38.240 --> 24:44.240]  People who were in D.C. executing their First Amendment right on January 6th that survived
[24:44.240 --> 24:49.560]  the onslaught and murder done by police that day.
[24:49.560 --> 24:54.240]  They're being arrested, they're being reeducated, Trump's being investigated, he's being lied
[24:54.240 --> 24:55.240]  about.
[24:55.240 --> 25:01.280]  If you were burning and looting in the name of George Floyd, another big lie, then you're
[25:01.280 --> 25:03.760]  good to go.
[25:03.760 --> 25:06.480]  Good to go.
[25:06.480 --> 25:11.960]  Then you have this.
[25:11.960 --> 25:18.520]  Now there's symbols of conquering you are being flown.
[25:18.520 --> 25:28.680]  Nellis Air Force Base hosts first ever drag queen show, essential to morale and readiness.
[25:28.680 --> 25:34.640]  Why are we doing drag queen story shows, drag queen shows at an air force base?
[25:34.640 --> 25:42.440]  Well, this is the conquering group waving their flag over what they've just conquered.
[25:42.440 --> 25:50.440]  This is the radical left wing as a Trojan horse of globalists and global tyranny with
[25:50.440 --> 25:56.360]  population control built into the system with medical tyranny forcing you to take a vaccine
[25:56.360 --> 26:01.360]  that could kill you and will eventually kill you.
[26:01.360 --> 26:03.040]  This is the Trojan horse of doing it.
[26:03.040 --> 26:08.880]  Oh, we're gay, we're victims, oh, we're men that dress as women, we're victims.
[26:08.880 --> 26:13.080]  So put us at your air force base and that's just them waving the flag.
[26:13.080 --> 26:15.320]  We've conquered you.
[26:15.320 --> 26:20.040]  State Department to fly progress flag in honor of Pride Month.
[26:20.040 --> 26:22.480]  Again, waving the flag.
[26:22.480 --> 26:30.560]  You've been conquered in bookstores all across the United States of America.
[26:30.560 --> 26:33.400]  You walk into the children's section and what is it?
[26:33.400 --> 26:35.880]  All gay pride.
[26:35.880 --> 26:42.920]  It's teaching your kids how to be transsexual, teaching your kids how to be gay and it's
[26:42.920 --> 26:49.400]  all promoted right there telling your kids to be fat and gay.
[26:49.400 --> 26:59.640]  Again, waving the flag, waving the flag, we've conquered you, we've conquered you.
[26:59.640 --> 27:05.040]  And then there's this part of it, Amazon commits 300 million to develop affordable housing
[27:05.040 --> 27:09.880]  in three cities, BlackRock buying up all the housing, Bill Gates buying up all the farmland,
[27:09.880 --> 27:11.920]  Warren Buffett buying up all the farmland.
[27:11.920 --> 27:17.520]  Now the monopoly men are going to own everything and you won't be able to opt out of any of
[27:17.520 --> 27:24.240]  it and they'll be able to bring in voter blocks with the open borders and they'll be able
[27:24.240 --> 27:27.880]  to bring in voter blocks in the impoverished inner cities where Amazon and BlackRock are
[27:27.880 --> 27:33.880]  going to own all the houses and they'll just get them to vote you into total tyranny and
[27:33.880 --> 27:38.400]  you better go along with it or you won't get energy to your house.
[27:38.400 --> 27:44.360]  Thermostats in Texas homes are being accessed remotely and turned up due to an energy shortage.
[27:44.360 --> 27:49.040]  So I can't even cover the full constellation, but do you get the picture, do you see where
[27:49.040 --> 27:55.200]  this is going, total tyranny, global government, forced vaccines that could kill you, do you
[27:55.200 --> 28:02.240]  see where this goes, do you see why it needs to be stopped?
[28:02.240 --> 28:05.680]  Granny do right, Granny do right, thanks for holding her on the ear, go ahead.
[28:05.680 --> 28:11.560]  Yeah, first of all let me say I love your products, I am a granny and for all the senior
[28:11.560 --> 28:17.000]  citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.040]  or age spots as they're lovingly called, but since taking your X2 for the last couple of
[28:22.040 --> 28:25.640]  years my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[28:25.640 --> 28:31.720]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements but I thought,
[28:31.720 --> 28:35.480]  you know, well maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless
[28:35.480 --> 28:39.880]  situation but when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately, but you
[28:39.880 --> 28:45.480]  know over a period of time I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is
[28:45.480 --> 28:51.600]  working, this is wonderful, you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know,
[28:51.600 --> 28:58.160]  so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[28:58.160 --> 29:02.040]  People pat me on the back all the time and I really, really appreciate it, but I want
[29:02.040 --> 29:06.600]  you to understand something, don't put the horse in front of the cart here, don't put
[29:06.600 --> 29:12.280]  the wagon in front of the mules here, if you weren't supporting us, if you weren't praying
[29:12.280 --> 29:16.840]  for us, if you weren't spreading the word, we wouldn't be on air anymore and we wouldn't
[29:16.840 --> 29:22.040]  have a shot at defeating the new ruler like we have right now, so now more than ever please

[29:34.600 --> 29:35.600]  to keep us on the air.
[29:35.600 --> 29:38.360]  We're going to defeat the globalists, but it's not going to happen easy, when you've
[29:38.360 --> 29:41.920]  got on our side, we've got to take action, three of our best selling products are back

[29:59.280 --> 30:05.000]  The entire new ruler system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making
[30:05.000 --> 30:09.520]  you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image
[30:09.520 --> 30:14.760]  of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[30:14.760 --> 30:20.840]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[30:20.840 --> 30:25.520]  an entire system and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're
[30:25.520 --> 30:30.040]  able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty
[30:30.040 --> 30:34.360]  of your wife or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[30:34.360 --> 30:35.360]  of music.
[30:35.360 --> 30:40.200]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself
[30:40.200 --> 30:43.560]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[30:43.560 --> 30:47.640]  So don't worship the globalists, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of
[30:47.640 --> 30:53.520]  the system but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness
[30:53.520 --> 31:00.440]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[31:00.440 --> 31:21.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:21.600 --> 31:26.920]  Did you know they discovered a new species of frog and named it after Led Zeppelin?
[31:26.920 --> 31:39.600]  They haven't turned all the frogs gay yet.
[31:39.600 --> 31:46.720]  We're still finding new straight frogs, heterosexual frogs and we're naming them after Led Zeppelin.
[31:46.720 --> 31:54.220]  By the way, the Save the Frogs t-shirt at infowarstore.com is already a top seller.
[31:54.220 --> 31:55.720]  I knew that one would be popular.
[31:55.720 --> 31:58.280]  It's so popular I can't even get one.
[31:58.280 --> 31:59.280]  They're on back order, folks.
[31:59.280 --> 32:04.160]  I'm still waiting for mine but we're going to, as you order it, we will get it to you.
[32:04.160 --> 32:06.200]  It just may take some time.
[32:06.200 --> 32:10.880]  One of many popular t-shirts at infowarstore.com but ladies and gentlemen, there are only two
[32:10.880 --> 32:19.040]  days left right now, only two days left, the last two days to save up to 40% off plus free
[32:19.040 --> 32:23.200]  shipping and double patriot points at infowarstore.com.
[32:23.200 --> 32:31.040]  We're still on sale are the brand new supplements from the infowar's life supplement line.
[32:31.040 --> 32:35.040]  The whole food multivitamin, the vitamin C plus zinc and the vitamin D plus calcium
[32:35.040 --> 32:43.560]  gummies, 25% off individually or 40% off when you get the mega immune support pack.
[32:43.560 --> 32:51.440]  I've tried the gummies, really great, great flavor, in fact, probably too good.
[32:51.440 --> 33:00.440]  Your kids will love it though and you can add that to your supplement regimen but this
[33:00.440 --> 33:05.120]  one is one that the kiddos will definitely love, the vitamin D3 with calcium healthy
[33:05.120 --> 33:06.120]  for them.
[33:06.120 --> 33:07.320]  They'll love the taste.
[33:07.320 --> 33:13.640]  You may have to hide it on the top shelf though because they may want to go in for seconds.
[33:13.640 --> 33:18.360]  Very tasty but only two days left of all of these specials, including survival shield
[33:18.360 --> 33:24.720]  X3 on sale, ultimate krill oil on sale, bio true selenium on sale.
[33:24.720 --> 33:28.640]  That's all at infowarstore.com and of course it's your support at infowarstore.com that
[33:28.640 --> 33:37.720]  keeps us on the air and everyday info wars is on the air is a victory for free speech
[33:37.720 --> 33:41.800]  and so we celebrate that victory together today.
[33:41.800 --> 33:47.720]  So I laid out the constellation and I couldn't even get to all of it in an eight minute segment
[33:47.720 --> 33:52.160]  but I think that you get the picture and so there's some other dots that we can connect
[33:52.160 --> 34:01.480]  here as well but it's all about understanding and with the historical context and the future
[34:01.480 --> 34:14.120]  site to see where all of this goes, the forcing of vaccines, the indoctrination of children,
[34:14.120 --> 34:22.840]  the lying mainstream media, the politicization of the justice department and the courtroom.
[34:22.840 --> 34:27.920]  Again, you need the historical context and the future site to see where this goes but
[34:27.920 --> 34:36.000]  it's a 21st century global tyranny, the likes of which human history has never documented
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.000]  to our knowledge.
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.920]  Who knows, maybe a million years ago we've been here before in this development of humankind
[34:42.920 --> 34:52.440]  but as far as known human history is concerned, the 21st century tyranny that we are or that
[34:52.440 --> 35:03.080]  is encroaching on us is nothing like this world has ever seen before and so if you look
[35:03.080 --> 35:15.120]  at the biggest authoritarian, all communists by the way, dictators of the 20th century,
[35:15.120 --> 35:24.840]  you see by design the history books written by those that have already conquered the planet,
[35:24.840 --> 35:29.920]  what you believe that Hitler was the biggest mass murderer or the worst person in the 20th
[35:29.920 --> 35:36.640]  century when indeed Mao Zedong was about 10 times worse by the death count, maybe more
[35:36.640 --> 35:39.320]  like 30 times worse.
[35:39.320 --> 35:44.600]  Most people don't learn about Mao Zedong like they learn about Hitler but that's not even
[35:44.600 --> 35:50.320]  the point, it's not a debate about who was the worst man in human history or what regime
[35:50.320 --> 35:52.760]  killed the most people.
[35:52.760 --> 36:00.080]  It's about understanding that in the 20th century between say five of the top communist
[36:00.080 --> 36:06.040]  dictators whether it's Pol Pot or Lenin or Stalin or Mao Zedong or throw Hitler in there,
[36:06.040 --> 36:16.960]  you're talking about around 100 million on record, maybe about 150 million on record
[36:16.960 --> 36:25.480]  people murdered by just those five regimes, so that was the 20th century.
[36:25.480 --> 36:36.760]  You're in the 21st century now and so if you have a global government with global tyranny,
[36:36.760 --> 36:45.920]  it's not going to be Mao Zedong killing 78 million, it's going to be the global government
[36:45.920 --> 36:54.480]  killing a quarter of a billion people overnight.
[36:54.480 --> 37:00.720]  So you're not going to see oh look at the worst mass murderers of the 20th century with
[37:00.720 --> 37:08.560]  Mao Zedong and Stalin and Lenin and no, it's going to be wow, look at what happened when
[37:08.560 --> 37:13.280]  the global government came in, call it the UN, call it whatever you want and overnight
[37:13.280 --> 37:20.760]  a quarter of a billion people died.
[37:20.760 --> 37:26.880]  And you see if they can mandate you to take a vaccine that might kill you, they can mandate
[37:26.880 --> 37:32.400]  you to take a vaccine that will kill you.
[37:32.400 --> 37:38.000]  And if they can lie about the COVID vaccine that's not actually a vaccine and is still
[37:38.000 --> 37:49.160]  in trial phase, emergency use for a pandemic that never happened, if they can force you
[37:49.160 --> 37:56.600]  to take that and they can lie about that, they can give you a lethal injection of cyanide
[37:56.600 --> 38:02.680]  and tell you it's for your health.
[38:02.680 --> 38:07.040]  And that's just where this goes.
[38:07.040 --> 38:11.680]  So these are the willing Stooges, these are the willing guinea pigs, these are the willing
[38:11.680 --> 38:23.040]  sacraments and sacrifices to the new world order, to the Satanist secret societies that
[38:23.040 --> 38:27.280]  just don't realize what's going on.
[38:27.280 --> 38:36.600]  But because of them and their acceptance of this medical tyranny, it creates the precedent
[38:36.600 --> 38:41.480]  that, oh, and the social pressure like, oh, you haven't gotten the vaccine, what's wrong
[38:41.480 --> 38:44.720]  with you?
[38:44.720 --> 38:49.320]  What's wrong with you is that you're educated, you think for yourself, you do your own research,
[38:49.320 --> 38:55.560]  you're not under mind control.
[38:55.560 --> 39:01.000]  But then they want to force you into their mind control and that's why you see the re-education
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.680]  camps emerging.
[39:02.680 --> 39:11.000]  And so this is just another star in the constellation that I laid out in the last segment where the
[39:11.000 --> 39:21.920]  young Turks are now having mass debates on should all Trump supporters and right wingers
[39:21.920 --> 39:26.000]  be turned into the federal government.
[39:26.000 --> 39:34.680]  And they have a poll doxing extremists.
[39:34.680 --> 39:41.640]  Now the funny thing is, it shows you not many people are visiting the young Turks' website.
[39:41.640 --> 39:44.480]  The voting numbers very low.
[39:44.480 --> 39:48.400]  But it's not about their numbers, it's about their mindset.
[39:48.400 --> 39:53.160]  And so you just saw a poll that came out last week where people that identified as liberals
[39:53.160 --> 39:58.920]  said that they would turn, they would turn friends or family or colleagues in for saying
[39:58.920 --> 39:59.920]  wrongthink.
[39:59.920 --> 40:08.800]  90% of liberals said they would turn in colleagues for doing wrongthink or saying something offensive.
[40:08.800 --> 40:12.600]  And so now they're just having the discussion, okay, well, we like doing this, should we
[40:12.600 --> 40:13.600]  start doing it?
[40:13.600 --> 40:15.040]  Well, they're already doing it.
[40:15.040 --> 40:20.120]  You've already had friends and family call in the FBI and say, hey, I know someone that
[40:20.120 --> 40:23.720]  was in January 6, but in DC, I know, I know someone.
[40:23.720 --> 40:24.720]  It's my neighbor.
[40:24.720 --> 40:25.720]  It's my cousin.
[40:25.720 --> 40:26.720]  It's my brother.
[40:26.720 --> 40:30.760]  It's my son.
[40:30.760 --> 40:34.680]  And then the lawyers and the feds come and scoop you up and they say, do you think Trump
[40:34.680 --> 40:35.680]  won the election?
[40:35.680 --> 40:38.560]  And if you say yes, you're going to jail.
[40:38.560 --> 40:41.240]  Or they'll give you two options to say, well, we can take you to jail or we can take you
[40:41.240 --> 40:42.640]  to a reeducation camp.
[40:42.640 --> 40:44.680]  Say, do you think Trump won the election?
[40:44.680 --> 40:45.680]  And you say, oh, I'm not sure.
[40:45.680 --> 40:51.120]  Well, we're going to take you to a reeducation camp and we're going to indoctrinate you and
[40:51.120 --> 40:55.680]  get you under our mind control, or at least make you pretend to do it so that we don't
[40:55.680 --> 40:56.840]  fully enslave you and lock you up.
[40:56.840 --> 41:01.400]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the
[41:01.400 --> 41:03.400]  scientific literature is overwhelming.
[41:03.400 --> 41:07.000]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well-being.
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.200]  A lot of folks take it before they take tests.
[41:09.200 --> 41:11.720]  People that have arthritis pain, they take it.
[41:11.720 --> 41:14.360]  It's well known for the things it does for a body.
[41:14.360 --> 41:16.240]  It makes our lives so much better.
[41:16.240 --> 41:20.360]  But then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil.
[41:20.360 --> 41:22.360]  And we've got both at infowarstore.com.
[41:22.360 --> 41:26.160]  But with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down, so it's been months and
[41:26.160 --> 41:29.040]  months and months since we've had krill oil back at Ston.
[41:29.040 --> 41:32.760]  Well, let's back, ladies and gentlemen, and despite the fact that it's already very fairly
[41:32.760 --> 41:38.120]  priced for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited
[41:38.120 --> 41:43.560]  time at infowarstore.com with free shipping and double-paid free of points because I want
[41:43.560 --> 41:46.280]  those of you that have already been customers have a chance to get more of it, and I want
[41:46.280 --> 41:50.520]  new viewers and listeners who have tried it to get it from us, and then try regular krill
[41:50.520 --> 41:53.560]  oil that is not one-tenth as powerful as ours.
[41:53.560 --> 42:23.520]  This is the highest grade back at stock infowarstore.com.
[42:23.520 --> 42:48.160]  So, well, that's it.
[42:48.160 --> 43:02.880]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[43:02.880 --> 43:05.600]  for beta testing to operational.
[43:05.600 --> 43:10.360]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[43:10.360 --> 43:11.360]  takeover.
[43:11.360 --> 43:14.760]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working
[43:14.760 --> 43:19.400]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[43:19.400 --> 43:23.400]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening
[43:23.400 --> 43:25.200]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[43:25.200 --> 43:27.680]  If we ask God for guidance we will defeat it.
[43:27.680 --> 43:31.920]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning
[43:31.920 --> 43:33.600]  others is absolutely essential.
[43:33.600 --> 43:38.160]  And at the same time supporting info wars by buying high quality products to keep us
[43:38.160 --> 43:41.840]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're
[43:41.840 --> 43:43.840]  also funding our operation.
[43:43.840 --> 43:49.760]  Infowarsstore.com Infowarsstore.com is incredible, a lot of our products that have been sold

[45:20.880 --> 45:25.360]  In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus in order
[45:25.360 --> 45:28.440]  to contribute something to solve overpopulation.
[45:28.440 --> 45:57.240]  Prince Philip, reported by Deutsche Press Argentur DPA, August 1988.
[45:57.240 --> 46:03.400]  What I do is a cure for our current situation, and how is it a cure if you're killing people?
[46:03.400 --> 46:05.640]  I told you it does not kill.
[46:05.640 --> 46:08.680]  That was the amazing epiphany we had.
[46:08.680 --> 46:12.800]  We didn't have to kill to accomplish our goal.
[46:12.800 --> 46:22.560]  We intend to stop human reproduction for three generations, the busy endless global assembly
[46:22.560 --> 46:30.720]  line of babies crying to all.
[46:30.720 --> 46:35.560]  Why do the globalists over and over and over again show us what they're going to do to
[46:35.560 --> 46:39.400]  us in comic books, in science fiction, in movies?
[46:39.400 --> 46:41.840]  Well, there's a lot of reasons that they do that.
[46:41.840 --> 46:48.520]  I'm going to explain the field right here, but this particular case of Utopia 2020, a
[46:48.520 --> 46:58.120]  remake of a British sci-fi show from 2013 that aired last year via the production system
[46:58.120 --> 47:04.960]  of Amazon, literally mirrors what's actually happening in reality.
[47:04.960 --> 47:07.320]  Now, why are they doing that?
[47:07.320 --> 47:09.320]  I'm going to explain in a moment.
[47:09.320 --> 47:12.480]  Because if you understand this, you understand everything.
[47:12.480 --> 47:22.960]  One show plot features fake virus global vaccine program to sterilize world population.
[47:22.960 --> 47:28.040]  He explains, I'm about to play about four minutes from the TV show here, why they're
[47:28.040 --> 47:29.360]  doing it.
[47:29.360 --> 47:34.960]  You learn that we're going to trick people to opt into a vaccine and that it's not going
[47:34.960 --> 47:37.840]  to kill them right away.
[47:37.840 --> 47:43.920]  It's going to sterilize them and they're going to pass this virus on that causes sterilization
[47:43.920 --> 47:50.080]  for at least three generations until the world population is held at 500 million.
[47:50.080 --> 47:53.000]  Well, what's on the Georgia guide stones?
[47:53.000 --> 48:00.600]  500 million, that's what the globalist groups set up by Bill Gates, David Rockefeller, Prince
[48:00.600 --> 48:05.760]  Charles, and of course the man that paid for the Georgia guide stones, Ted Turner, have
[48:05.760 --> 48:07.520]  openly said they're going to do.
[48:07.520 --> 48:10.560]  They're the good guy club, the billionaire club that wants to set up world government
[48:10.560 --> 48:13.120]  to depopulate the planet.
[48:13.120 --> 48:17.200]  And so they want to tell you in these films, so that some of the public when they get warned
[48:17.200 --> 48:21.520]  about what's happening, live time will say, oh, you just got that from Black Mirror, the
[48:21.520 --> 48:25.520]  social credit score that we told you was coming 15 years ago, long before Black Mirror.
[48:25.520 --> 48:34.080]  Oh, you just got that from the Amazon show, Utopia 2020.
[48:34.080 --> 48:39.560]  So people then think it's theater, they think it's fiction when we're warning them about
[48:39.560 --> 48:40.560]  the real plot.
[48:40.560 --> 48:44.800]  And all these top scientists and white papers are, as you know, that the vaccine is a vaccine
[48:44.800 --> 48:48.600]  that makes you create spike proteins, the attack fertility, and it will pass this on
[48:48.600 --> 48:50.000]  for generations.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.040]  That's what the scientists have said clearly.
[48:52.040 --> 49:00.160]  So here they are in a film that's produced at the beginning of the pandemic and put out
[49:00.160 --> 49:04.720]  during the middle of it, mirroring what's really happening, and then you have all the
[49:04.720 --> 49:09.240]  real global publications saying, oh, the lockdowns are good for the earth, it cuts carbon, no,
[49:09.240 --> 49:13.280]  people don't have as many kids during lockdown, that's good, we need regular climate lockdowns
[49:13.280 --> 49:17.600]  because humans are bad, they're hitting you at every level.
[49:17.600 --> 49:21.240]  And it's an excuse for these levels to take full control of all human development, not
[49:21.240 --> 49:25.320]  just, quote, save the planet from overpopulation.
[49:25.320 --> 49:30.240]  And they also like to tell the world in a very thinly veiled way what they're doing
[49:30.240 --> 49:31.640]  and why they're doing it.
[49:31.640 --> 49:37.000]  So we're in the process of this depopulation, we're in the process of this mass culling,
[49:37.000 --> 49:42.480]  we're in the process of the social contract being broken, where no one's going to trust
[49:42.480 --> 49:47.760]  medicine or governments again, and that also adds to the horrible dystopia that's unfolding.
[49:47.760 --> 49:51.560]  So here is five minutes or so from the show.
[49:51.560 --> 49:55.640]  If you're a radio listener, it's posted to Band-Aw Video and infowars.com, I suggest
[49:55.640 --> 50:00.160]  you share it, and I suggest you share it with my little intro here so people can understand
[50:00.160 --> 50:03.480]  the perspective of why these people continue to carry this out.
[50:03.480 --> 50:07.360]  And then I hope you'll actually see my film, Endgame, a little bit for global enslavement
[50:07.360 --> 50:12.760]  that's free in the infowars documentary section of Band-Aw Video that I made 14 years ago
[50:12.760 --> 50:16.480]  that shows all the actual documents and video and proof of this plan, because this is the
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.760]  future of the world, they've hijacked the future, and I think we should at least know
[50:20.760 --> 50:26.560]  what's going on and try to put in our two sets on this operation that's taking place,
[50:26.560 --> 50:31.440]  but this is all out in the open right now, and so here is an excerpt where the star of
[50:31.440 --> 50:35.160]  the show, the mad scientist, is explaining what they're doing to the world and how they're
[50:35.160 --> 50:38.760]  really giving us a great gift, and I guess if we don't care and don't stand up, we kind
[50:38.760 --> 50:41.040]  of do deserve what happens to us.
[50:41.040 --> 50:45.280]  How much evil do you have to do to do good?
[50:45.280 --> 50:52.640]  You desecrated all of my work, you disrespected science, and what the hell did you put in
[50:52.640 --> 50:54.920]  that vaccine?
[50:54.920 --> 50:59.920]  We created a fluid spark that demand for a vaccine that doesn't work, after everyone
[50:59.920 --> 51:00.920]  in the country is vaccinated.
[51:00.920 --> 51:01.920]  And the world?
[51:01.920 --> 51:03.920]  Till it's murdered millions.
[51:03.920 --> 51:05.400]  Nope, nope, you don't have it.
[51:05.400 --> 51:09.760]  Give a certain percentage of the population a fatal illness, and you make sure it's genetic.
[51:09.760 --> 51:15.520]  See, that was the exciting part, you pass it down, so if you have children before you
[51:15.520 --> 51:20.720]  die, and when this vaccine fails, I'll be the scapegoat.
[51:20.720 --> 51:23.520]  People are driven by the need to know what happens next.
[51:23.520 --> 51:29.040]  Do you want to know what happens next?
[51:29.040 --> 51:38.240]  Your father created a world-changing, not world-ending, a world-changing, world-improving
[51:38.240 --> 51:43.840]  omni-virus, and we have taken that virus and embedded it in the vaccine of the Sterns
[51:43.840 --> 51:44.840]  Flu.
[51:44.840 --> 51:45.840]  I knew it.
[51:45.840 --> 51:46.840]  I knew it.
[51:46.840 --> 51:50.440]  He created a panic, and now everybody's begging for the vaccine.
[51:50.440 --> 51:51.440]  No, no, no.
[51:51.440 --> 51:52.440]  Demanding it.
[51:52.440 --> 51:53.440]  Yes.
[51:53.440 --> 51:59.120]  And now we have exactly what we want, hundreds of millions of Americans lining up, offering
[51:59.120 --> 52:02.640]  us their arms, and letting us give them our creation.
[52:02.640 --> 52:06.760]  I'm pretty sure when every vaccinated person starts dying, they'll trace back to you, undetectable
[52:06.760 --> 52:07.760]  virus or not.
[52:07.760 --> 52:08.760]  You've all been very busy.
[52:08.760 --> 52:09.760]  You're all very sharp.
[52:09.760 --> 52:12.760]  Are you sure even if you'd like to come and work for me?
[52:12.760 --> 52:13.760]  No?
[52:13.760 --> 52:18.760]  Better than dying a terrible, violent death?
[52:18.760 --> 52:22.320]  Then understand this.
[52:22.320 --> 52:25.760]  What we are doing is far bigger than death.
[52:25.760 --> 52:27.160]  Wait.
[52:27.160 --> 52:29.080]  This virus is not deadly.
[52:29.080 --> 52:33.080]  It looks pretty damn deadly.
[52:33.080 --> 52:34.080]  Tell me this.
[52:34.080 --> 52:41.760]  What have you done today to earn your place in this crowded world?
[52:41.760 --> 52:42.760]  Exactly.
[52:42.760 --> 52:46.840]  Everything I do is a cure for our current situation.
[52:46.840 --> 52:49.560]  And how's it a cure if you're killing people?
[52:49.560 --> 52:51.800]  I told you it does not kill.
[52:51.800 --> 52:54.840]  That was the amazing epiphany we had.
[52:54.840 --> 52:58.960]  We didn't have to kill to accomplish our goal.
[52:58.960 --> 53:04.960]  We intend to stop human reproduction for three generations.
[53:04.960 --> 53:12.960]  The busy, endless global assembly line of babies will grind to old.
[53:12.960 --> 53:15.960]  You're sterilizing people?
[53:15.960 --> 53:16.960]  Uh-huh.
[53:16.960 --> 53:23.160]  In the first five years, we'll start to see major birth rate declines as teenagers vaccinated
[53:23.160 --> 53:25.200]  stay at their child-bearing years.
[53:25.200 --> 53:27.600]  You're controlling the future of human civilization.
[53:27.600 --> 53:29.120]  Is that what they're calling it?
[53:29.120 --> 53:33.480]  It's a very nice euphemism for a species that is replicated like a contagion across the
[53:33.480 --> 53:39.200]  planet, killing all other species in its wake, except things that are cute, like puppies
[53:39.200 --> 53:40.200]  or koalas.
[53:40.200 --> 53:41.680]  You hate people that much?
[53:41.680 --> 53:43.800]  On the contrary, I love people.
[53:43.800 --> 53:48.440]  Why would you want our government or citizenry is to spoil their self-indulgent to-do?
[53:48.440 --> 53:51.280]  We are saving ourselves from ourselves.
[53:51.280 --> 53:52.880]  Holding over a population?
[53:52.880 --> 53:57.120]  A hundred years ago, the global population was 1.7 billion.
[53:57.120 --> 54:00.560]  In 2011, it reached 7 billion.
[54:00.560 --> 54:02.560]  People live too long, die less often.
[54:02.560 --> 54:05.000]  In 2050, they say it's going to plateau.
[54:05.000 --> 54:10.280]  We'll blow past 11 billion and then slowly begin to decline.
[54:10.280 --> 54:15.560]  Global warming, mass extinctions, food, water shortages, all these problems can be boiled
[54:15.560 --> 54:18.400]  down to one thing, over a population.
[54:18.400 --> 54:23.400]  At 1.7 billion, we can be as decadent self-indulgent 10 billion.
[54:23.400 --> 54:25.400]  We have to live strategically.
[54:25.400 --> 54:27.400]  We have to live modestly.
[54:27.400 --> 54:30.360]  What about what this does to people's society?
[54:30.360 --> 54:31.360]  Salvation.
[54:31.360 --> 54:33.200]  We can form a new society.
[54:33.200 --> 54:36.760]  And you're beta testing it on Americans since we're the worst.
[54:36.760 --> 54:40.800]  The grand social experiment.
[54:40.800 --> 54:51.720]  So is the television show Utopia 2020 predictive programming, or is it just a coincidence that
[54:51.720 --> 55:01.640]  that plot line from that cable news special series Utopia 2020, is it just a coincidence
[55:01.640 --> 55:09.160]  that the exact plot of 2020 is in the show called Utopia 2020?
[55:09.160 --> 55:15.160]  And I've got more vaccine news now.
[55:15.160 --> 55:22.520]  And have you noticed something that the left and the media is rooting for the virus?
[55:22.520 --> 55:24.960]  Have you noticed this?
[55:24.960 --> 55:28.080]  You know why that is?
[55:28.080 --> 55:33.160]  Because they see it as a source and a means of power over you.
[55:33.160 --> 55:37.880]  So they want this new Delta variant to break out so they can get at you to wear a mask,
[55:37.880 --> 55:41.320]  get at you to take a vaccine and blame you for it.
[55:41.320 --> 55:45.320]  Not the lab where it was made or Fauci who helped make it, no, but you, the free thinker,
[55:45.320 --> 55:46.320]  the free citizen.
[55:46.320 --> 55:50.440]  All the evil men in Towers need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[55:50.440 --> 55:52.440]  Well, I'm trying to be a good man.
[55:52.440 --> 55:53.840]  I'm trying to stand up to the right thing.
[55:53.840 --> 55:58.960]  And I've seen huge effects with what we've done here in Empowers.
[55:58.960 --> 56:03.920]  Other good men and women getting together and telling the truth and standing up to corruption.
[56:03.920 --> 56:05.440]  But now the globals are coming after us.
[56:05.440 --> 56:09.640]  And so I need your prayers, I need your financial support, I need your word of mouth to stay
[56:09.640 --> 56:10.640]  in the fight.
[56:10.640 --> 56:14.120]  We've got a big sale going right now, free shipping, double-patriot points on three

[56:31.520 --> 56:35.520]  It is you that has spread the word, it is you that have built this operation and we're

[56:45.480 --> 56:48.120]  it at the same time.
[56:48.120 --> 56:51.520]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[56:51.520 --> 56:55.760]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[56:55.760 --> 56:58.960]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck.
[56:58.960 --> 57:02.080]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[57:02.080 --> 57:03.360]  can to shut us down.
[57:03.360 --> 57:07.680]  So please pray to keep Empowers on the air and please support the local station you're
[57:07.680 --> 57:08.680]  listening to as well.
[57:08.680 --> 57:14.800]  At the same time, go to Empowers.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[57:14.800 --> 57:19.680]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[57:19.680 --> 57:21.160]  in the face of this thing.
[57:21.160 --> 57:23.280]  I need your help more than ever now.
[57:23.280 --> 57:27.600]  I want to keep fighting the globalists but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[57:27.600 --> 57:32.600]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can and buy
[57:32.600 --> 57:38.240]  great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at EmpowerStore.com.
[57:38.240 --> 57:42.760]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[57:42.760 --> 57:47.680]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[57:47.680 --> 57:51.200]  Thank you so much.
[57:51.200 --> 58:07.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:07.880 --> 58:13.800]  What have you noticed most likely in the last couple of years about the Democrat Party
[58:13.800 --> 58:15.200]  in the mainstream media?
[58:15.200 --> 58:17.560]  Well, it's the same entity.
[58:17.560 --> 58:20.120]  They carry the same water.
[58:20.120 --> 58:26.520]  They tell the same lies, the same myths and they enforce the same tyranny.
[58:26.520 --> 58:32.640]  And so I really don't even know how to cover this irony that I'm about to show you from
[58:32.640 --> 58:39.080]  the Democrat Party with Chuck Schumer and Ilhan Omar, other tend to just feed it to
[58:39.080 --> 58:45.400]  you raw and just witness it for yourself.
[58:45.400 --> 58:48.440]  I mean, again, I have no real words.
[58:48.440 --> 58:53.360]  This is the epitome of irony.
[58:53.360 --> 58:57.040]  This is the epitome of hypocrisy.
[58:57.040 --> 59:02.360]  Everything Chuck Schumer says in this clip is true of himself and the mainstream media,
[59:02.360 --> 59:05.640]  but listen to what he says to Congress yesterday.
[59:05.640 --> 59:09.400]  By the way, they're still not over Donald Trump.
[59:09.400 --> 59:11.000]  They still can't get over this guy.
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.740]  So here's Chuck Schumer in front of Congress yesterday.
[59:13.740 --> 59:18.720]  This is the epitome of irony.
[59:18.720 --> 59:19.720]  Just a note.
[59:19.720 --> 59:21.920]  How despicable a man is Donald Trump?
[59:21.920 --> 59:22.920]  That's him.
[59:22.920 --> 59:23.920]  He's despicable.
[59:23.920 --> 59:24.920]  Chuck Schumer.
[59:24.920 --> 59:25.920]  He lost an election legitimately.
[59:25.920 --> 59:33.200]  He can't face that, that it was his failure and he creates a lie, a big lie and wins so
[59:33.200 --> 59:39.480]  many people over to that lie with the help of news media and other news commentators who
[59:39.480 --> 59:45.920]  are lying as well and they know it again.
[59:45.920 --> 59:52.800]  Donald Trump with his despicable lies has lit a fire beneath Republican state legislatures
[59:52.800 --> 59:57.840]  and they have launched the most sweeping voter suppression efforts in at least in at least
[59:57.840 --> 59:58.840]  80 years.
[59:58.840 --> 59:59.840]  Pause it right there.
[59:59.840 --> 1:00:00.840]  More than 200.
[1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:09.640]  So, Chuck Schumer says Trump is a liar and that the media does the work to carry out
[1:00:09.640 --> 1:00:10.640]  his lies.
[1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:17.160]  I mean, again, do I even have to explain the ridiculousness of that statement and the irony?
[1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:24.200]  And then, as if it wasn't enough, he goes on to tell you a massive lie that Republicans
[1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:26.040]  want voter suppression.
[1:00:26.040 --> 1:00:29.040]  What?
[1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:32.840]  A voter ID is somehow voter suppression?
[1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:35.600]  It's common sense to show an ID when you vote.
[1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:37.480]  How am I going to know it's you voting?
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:39.280]  How am I going to know you didn't vote already?
[1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:41.080]  Well, you have an ID.
[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:44.920]  Okay, it makes sense.
[1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:52.160]  How are you going to argue that you had voter suppression in 2020, which is what their basis
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:56.480]  of all of this is, is, oh, there's all this voter suppression in 2020, you had a record
[1:00:56.480 --> 1:01:03.240]  number of voter turnout, an astronomical record.
[1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:11.840]  Donald Trump got a record number of votes in a U.S. presidential election and he lost,
[1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:13.840]  at least they want us to believe that.
[1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:18.440]  So, how are you going to tell me you had voter suppression and that Republicans want voter
[1:01:18.440 --> 1:01:25.120]  suppression when you had an astronomical record of voter turnout in 2020 and the only thing
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:29.840]  you can point to that Republicans want is voter ID, which is just common sense.
[1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:37.600]  So Schumer tells the whopper of a lie or I should say a whopper of an ironic statement
[1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:41.960]  saying that Trump lies and the media carries out his lies to the exact opposite.
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:47.320]  The Democrats lie and the media lie all day long about everything and they always get
[1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:48.320]  caught.
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:49.320]  Russian collusion, hands up, don't shoot.
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:54.400]  I mean, I could go on all day, but then Schumer tells you a lie after saying Trump and the
[1:01:54.400 --> 1:01:58.520]  media are lying.
[1:01:58.520 --> 1:02:03.480]  He must think that the American people are really that stupid and I hope he realizes
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:05.080]  how dumb he looks.
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:08.640]  What an embarrassment, but he has no shame.
[1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:10.680]  And then here's Ilhan Omar.
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:14.720]  Again, tell me, do I even have to tell you how ironic this is?
[1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:19.560]  Does this not just slap you in the face, the irony of this statement from Ilhan Omar?
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:24.640]  Republicans love to create outrage over things that aren't actually happening.
[1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:27.960]  People should be asking them what elementary, middle school, and high school is teaching
[1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:31.600]  critical race theory and why they are spinning false narratives.
[1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:37.840]  So she's saying that critical race theory doesn't even exist when it's their own creation.
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:41.600]  And then she says that Republicans create outrage over things that aren't actually happening.
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:46.920]  Again, that's the Democrats and all their minority arguments that minorities don't
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:47.920]  really care about.
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:53.160]  I mean, again, the irony, the epitome of irony is in these Democrat politicians lying in
[1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:55.600]  the media line.
[1:02:55.600 --> 1:03:01.920]  Scientists agree magnesium is the most important co-factor in the body, regulating and controlling
[1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:04.280]  hundreds of pathways.
[1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:07.440]  Magnesium is required for your body to do the following.
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:10.360]  Helps convert food into energy.
[1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:12.840]  Helps with muscle contraction function.
[1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:14.800]  Helps regulate the nervous system.
[1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:18.600]  Helps with protein building in the muscles and so much more.
[1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:24.360]  And now it's available in this concentrated form of ionized, fizzy magnesium.
[1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:25.560]  It tastes great.
[1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:26.760]  I take it in the morning.
[1:03:26.760 --> 1:03:28.280]  I take it in the evening.
[1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:30.680]  It is so essential in my life.
[1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:33.360]  And I hope all of you will check it out and try it.
[1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:36.520]  It's available at InfoMoreStore.com right now.
[1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:40.200]  This is the best formula from our research you're going to find out there.
[1:03:40.200 --> 1:03:44.320]  So if you've already enjoyed other magnesium formulas, give this one a try.
[1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:45.320]  I think you're going to love it.
[1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:48.680]  At the same time, it funds the InfoWar, which is a true 360 win.
[1:03:48.680 --> 1:04:02.560]  Now exclusively available at InfoMoreStore.com for only $19.95.
[1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:07.600]  InfoWars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:10.960]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:13.080]  I'm just floored.
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:18.680]  I'm just floored at the bold face phoniness of Chuck Schumer and Ilhan Omar.
[1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:21.640]  Schumer says that Trump lies and the media carries his lies.
[1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:23.760]  It's the exact opposite.
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:26.800]  Trump is lied about all day long and the media carries out those lies.
[1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:29.800]  But that's just one example of the media's lies.
[1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:33.520]  And then Ilhan Omar saying that Republicans love to fake outrage over things that don't
[1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:34.520]  happen.
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:35.520]  No, that's you.
[1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:36.520]  That's you guys with everything.
[1:04:36.520 --> 1:04:37.520]  Voter suppression.
[1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:38.520]  Not true.
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:39.520]  America's racist.
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:40.520]  Not true.
[1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:45.040]  If it's more of a demand for racism from the left, then there is a supply.
[1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:46.840]  So they fake it.
[1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:53.720]  Like Jussie Smollett and dozens of others caught at Ivy League schools and universities
[1:04:53.720 --> 1:05:01.040]  and pretending that a rope on a garage is a noose and was sent as a statement.
[1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:05.160]  So again, Chuck Schumer says Trump's a liar and the media carries his lies.
[1:05:05.160 --> 1:05:08.280]  The exact opposite is true.
[1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:13.240]  Ilhan Omar says Republicans like to fake outrage over things that aren't happening.
[1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:15.840]  Again, that's the Democrats.
[1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:25.080]  So desperate for America to be racist that they fake hate crimes.
[1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:26.080]  You know what?
[1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:27.400]  This is hilarious here.
[1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:31.280]  I don't know if this is true or not, but I swear to you, I was just thinking in my
[1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:36.880]  head when they put this up, is the media going to start whitening people's faces when they
[1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:39.360]  put out their photos?
[1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:44.680]  If it's a criminal, are they going to whiten the criminal's face so that they can carry
[1:05:44.680 --> 1:05:47.800]  out their false narrative that it's white supremacists doing all this and then the crew
[1:05:47.800 --> 1:05:48.800]  pulled this up.
[1:05:48.800 --> 1:05:57.280]  So this is apparently CNN, a story covering a violent criminal, a non-white supremacist,
[1:05:57.280 --> 1:06:00.920]  and they have the real picture of the individual there carrying the gun and then the CNN story
[1:06:00.920 --> 1:06:08.120]  of it and they make him look white.
[1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:11.760]  And I got this story right here that correlates with it.
[1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:17.160]  Austin American statesman shares fact check claiming it's false.
[1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:27.520]  They omitted suspect's description because he's black, except their fact check, which
[1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:38.280]  was done by Politifact, shares that the Austin American statesman did indeed not share the
[1:06:38.280 --> 1:06:46.320]  fact that the suspect was black because, quote, it could be harmful and perpetuating stereotypes.
[1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:47.760]  So it's true.
[1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:53.040]  They didn't put his picture out because he was black and then Politifact admits it but
[1:06:53.040 --> 1:07:03.000]  says no, it's not true, wow, wow, by the way, the one in Austin was a mass shooting and
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:08.520]  the suspect was still at large and so they still didn't put out the photo because the
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:13.000]  guy was black and they didn't want to perpetuate stereotypes even though it was a mass shooter
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:18.440]  at large in downtown Austin tests.
[1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:25.240]  These people are psycho, insane.
[1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:29.440]  So like now you see them now they're pushing to put Trump supporters in reeducation camps.
[1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:31.360]  Again, it's all projection, man.
[1:07:31.360 --> 1:07:33.600]  They belong in the reeducation camps.
[1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:39.480]  They're the mental defectives and I don't want to put them in mental care facilities.
[1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:44.320]  I don't want to put them in rubber rooms but they're coming for us.
[1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:46.720]  So it's like, what are we supposed to do?
[1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:47.720]  They're the psychos.
[1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:48.720]  They're the psychotics.
[1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:54.040]  I mean, for God's sakes, have you seen Keith Overman lately?
[1:07:54.040 --> 1:08:04.200]  The guy has rubber room written all over him and they put that psychotic on television.
[1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:15.400]  Keith Overman but oh, Ilhan Omar says Republicans fake outrage about things that don't exist
[1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:20.120]  and then we point out again, I mean, I don't know who else was reporting on it.
[1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:23.240]  We reported on it the day of and the next day because it happened here in Austin.
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:30.440]  I said, I mean, I don't live far from the downtown area and so they get the notification
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:35.960]  sent out mass shooter at large downtown Austin and I go to the story and there's no picture
[1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:42.840]  of the guy and I know why they don't share a picture of the guy and then people tweet
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:46.520]  at the Austin American station and they're like, why aren't you showing a picture?
[1:08:46.520 --> 1:08:48.760]  It's because he's black, isn't it?
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:53.840]  And then Politifact runs a fact check and they asked the Austin American statement why
[1:08:53.840 --> 1:08:57.480]  they didn't put the picture of the black suspect out and the Austin American statement said
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:01.640]  because it could be harmful and perpetuating stereotypes and then Politifact says it's
[1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:07.280]  false that they didn't put out the picture of the suspect because he was black even though
[1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:11.600]  they got the answer from the Austin American statement that said they didn't do it because
[1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:12.600]  he's black.
[1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:19.880]  And he's like, I am living in the clown world, paint my face, give me a honky nose, give
[1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:25.320]  me a flower that squirts water on you, you know, I mean, like, give me a hula hoop, should
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:33.400]  we just all just be total clowns like these people want us to be now?
[1:09:33.400 --> 1:09:41.360]  So again, I don't want these mentally defective, mentally ill liberals to be put in a reeducation
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:42.360]  camp?
[1:09:42.360 --> 1:09:43.360]  I'm all about freedom.
[1:09:43.360 --> 1:09:48.280]  I know that what I wish on the my worst enemy could ultimately be done to me.
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:51.400]  So I don't want this to be done to them, but they're calling for us to be put in reeducation
[1:09:51.400 --> 1:09:52.400]  camps.
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:54.040]  They're doing it to Trump supporters right now.
[1:09:54.040 --> 1:09:55.720]  And they say, oh, did Trump win the election?
[1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:02.680]  If you say yes, time to take you to the reeducation camp, you're going to have to do a book report.
[1:10:02.680 --> 1:10:04.440]  Wow.
[1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:16.920]  And these are the same people that want to force you to take a vaccine.
[1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:20.360]  And you know why they hate infowars so much?
[1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:26.400]  I mean, the globalist, like the real secret societies, they almost really don't even hate
[1:10:26.400 --> 1:10:27.400]  us.
[1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:36.960]  But truly, they respect us because in a way, they look at us as like metaphysical redemption
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:42.680]  for them because they're like, hey, you were warned, you know, infowars told you and like
[1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:51.000]  an inside of the mouth, they're like, you know, but see, the left really hates us and
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:56.640]  lies about us on a daily basis like, again, I'm not litigious.
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:10:58.840]  I don't want to sit in courtrooms all day long and deal with lawyers.
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:02.800]  But it's like, after how many lies about me in the mainstream media, do I just decide
[1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:04.720]  I'm going to start suing people?
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:08.560]  New York Times, Washington Post saying lies about me and then friends send me a story
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:09.560]  saying, why did you do this?
[1:11:09.560 --> 1:11:10.560]  I say, I didn't do it.
[1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:11.560]  Here's the video.
[1:11:11.560 --> 1:11:12.560]  They didn't show you.
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:13.560]  And they say, wow, that's true.
[1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:14.560]  You didn't do it.
[1:11:14.560 --> 1:11:16.200]  What a lie.
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:23.600]  So they want to put you in reeducation camp.
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:24.840]  That's tyranny.
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:27.120]  They want to force you to take a vaccine.
[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:29.120]  That's tyranny.
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:30.760]  And they're cheering.
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:33.480]  They're cheering for a virus right now.
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:35.200]  They are on the side of the virus.
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:37.800]  They're rooting for the virus, this new Delta variant.
[1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:40.000]  This is their new big thing.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.360]  They want it to outbreak.
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:49.400]  They want people to die because then that gives them this false sense of superiority
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:54.960]  and authority to make you wear a mask and make you take a vaccine and then blame you
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:57.160]  for a virus.
[1:11:57.160 --> 1:11:59.880]  So the media will probably build up this Delta variant.
[1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:02.200]  We'll see.
[1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:07.840]  And they're already pushing it in stories like this at NPR.
[1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:14.320]  Delta variant of the coronavirus could dominate, dominate.
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:18.520]  In US within weeks, they're rooting for the virus.
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:22.840]  They want it to dominate because that's who these people are.
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:32.520]  It's like Ed Buck or it's like the Democrat Manhattan City Council candidate who does
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:37.520]  pornography in sex dungeons where he's being tortured by dominatrix.
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:38.520]  Yeah.
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:43.640]  It's not really one of the things I wanted to cover here on air so I didn't show you
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:44.640]  that.
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:46.840]  But yeah, you know, that's what they're into.
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:49.760]  The nicks of them, sex cults, all of it.
[1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:53.600]  Bill Clinton with the women he raped, you know, saying that they bit him so hard it
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:55.840]  went a hole in their lip.
[1:12:55.840 --> 1:12:57.400]  But hey, this is them.
[1:12:57.400 --> 1:13:01.520]  They want the virus to dominate.
[1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:06.560]  NPR says the Delta variant of the coronavirus could dominate.
[1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:13.560]  It's going to dominate and they want it to dominate because they want to dominate you.
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:18.200]  And so it doesn't matter that we have all of these pilots that are being forced to take
[1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:19.880]  the vaccine that are dying.
[1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:23.840]  It doesn't matter that you had a cruise ship where everybody on the cruise ship was forced
[1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:26.040]  to take the vaccine and you had multiple COVID cases.
[1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:30.760]  It doesn't matter that, you know, 4,000 fully vaccinated people in Massachusetts tested positive
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:32.600]  for COVID.
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:37.360]  It doesn't matter that the World Health Organization has even admitted that the COVID vaccine isn't
[1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:39.080]  going to work for the Delta variant.
[1:13:39.080 --> 1:13:43.200]  And that's an argument they make in this NPR piece saying this is all the more reason
[1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:47.540]  to get vaccinated and all the more reason to be mad at your friends that don't get vaccinated.
[1:13:47.540 --> 1:13:51.160]  Even though they admit this vaccine will do nothing for the Delta variant.
[1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:54.360]  And these people want to run your lives.
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:14:01.040]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[1:14:01.040 --> 1:14:07.280]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:12.440]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:15.280]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:20.760]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine and the sicker people got the more their industry grew.
[1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:25.120]  It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape.
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:31.560]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:35.080]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:40.120]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to
[1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:44.400]  be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.

[1:15:57.120 --> 1:16:22.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:34.160]  It's been an incredible time to be alive, but are you truly living?
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:45.480]  Are you expanding your consciousness or are you shrinking it into the vortex of global
[1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:49.720]  tyranny being brought in with the Trojan horse of modern day liberalism?
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:56.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ivory Hecker is a true American hero, one of the latest project Veritas
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:17:03.120]  whistleblowers, not like the coward over there at ABC News Amy Rohrbach that spiked the story
[1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:07.360]  of Epstein sex trafficking to protect Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:08.360]  That's a coward.
[1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:13.000]  Ivory Hecker is a courageous woman and a hero.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:18.320]  Here's just part of her latest breaking story in the revelations that she is being censored
[1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:20.320]  by Fox News Corporation.
[1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:28.840]  So my YouTube video showing my Fox bosses in their own words with their tyrannical control
[1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:35.400]  of the narrative was deleted from YouTube because it didn't meet community guidelines.
[1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:38.960]  It's nice to know that YouTube and Fox are good buddies.
[1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:43.640]  I'm going to post the video again here and on Telegram, definitely Telegram is where
[1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:44.640]  you can see it.
[1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:45.640]  It's not going to get deleted.
[1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:52.240]  I'm dumbfounded, I'm dumbfounded that video of Fox bosses talking about controlling the
[1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:56.560]  narrative is censored out of YouTube.
[1:17:56.560 --> 1:17:57.560]  So think about this.
[1:17:57.560 --> 1:18:02.520]  We now know for a fact, it's on record, that Fox has a direct line of communication with
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:09.320]  big tech, CNN and all these other liberal outposts on the internet have a direct line
[1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:14.040]  of communication with big tech and that the Democrat Party, which was revealed by Mike
[1:18:14.040 --> 1:18:16.600]  Cernovich the other day, has a direct line of communication with big tech.
[1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:20.920]  And so anytime they see something they don't like, they send a message to Google or Facebook
[1:18:20.920 --> 1:18:28.600]  or YouTube or Twitter and it gets read and what they ask to be censored gets censored.
[1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:39.320]  The best place now for all news, current events, politics, whatever on the internet is band.video
[1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:43.680]  and infowars.com.
[1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:51.920]  The most uncensored, raw, real, expansive and full encompassing news coverage you're
[1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:59.920]  going to get is infowars.com and for videos and live streams, it's band.video.
[1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:10.760]  And I have to say, what we, that's the crew here, that's you in the audience, what we've
[1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:16.840]  done to build band.video is truly incredible.
[1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:20.840]  And so you really don't need any other sources anymore.
[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:27.040]  Even if you don't like necessarily myself or Alex or Harrison Smith, the three hosts
[1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:35.080]  here of the live shows on infowars every day, there are so many contributors now to band.video.
[1:19:35.080 --> 1:19:38.640]  It is incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:42.880]  Again, so you may not like the infowars hosts, hey, that's fine.
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:46.960]  I get it, I'm kind of loud and obnoxious sometimes, may not be your cup of tea.
[1:19:46.960 --> 1:19:52.880]  But we have all these other great reporters, Gregory's, David Ike, the list just goes on
[1:19:52.880 --> 1:20:00.440]  and on and on, Paul Joseph Watson, Nick Fuentes, John Bowne, the Liberty Broadcast, all of
[1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:03.880]  it at band.video.
[1:20:03.880 --> 1:20:06.840]  So we built this, you, us, all of us together.
[1:20:06.840 --> 1:20:09.920]  We've done this in the age of censorship.

[1:20:19.600 --> 1:20:26.880]  We know that part of the globalist attack on humanity is the attack on us, on our bodies
[1:20:26.880 --> 1:20:28.840]  with the poisons in the food and the water.
[1:20:28.840 --> 1:20:35.080]  And so it's hard to get all the vitamins and minerals you need in the average daily
[1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:37.100]  diet now.
[1:20:37.100 --> 1:20:41.160]  And the air is polluted, the water is polluted.

[1:20:49.680 --> 1:20:53.840]  breathing and drinking toxic air and water.

[1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:59.480]  And it's worked and look at everything we've done, look at everything we've built.
[1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:02.080]  We've truly changed the world.
[1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:08.960]  And like the phoenix rising from the ashes, our influence and our reach expands every
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:11.120]  day.

[1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:58.760]  the emergency supplies, the emergency food, the hats, the t-shirts, all of it is at infowarsstore.com.
[1:21:58.760 --> 1:22:05.800]  And you'll notice, and some people are starting to notice this too, and it's just kind of
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:14.760]  funny because we're just like, grab the hard hat and the pail and, you know, the lunchbox
[1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:18.640]  and just get to work.
[1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:32.520]  And so we don't really sit down and take time to reflect on what we do, but, you know, I
[1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:37.880]  have people sending me stuff, other people that work in media or just friends and family,
[1:22:37.880 --> 1:22:41.080]  and they'll send me these news stories that they see that come across their news feed
[1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:44.840]  or they see on TV and they'll say, hey, you know, didn't you say that last year?
[1:22:44.840 --> 1:22:47.800]  Like, hey, you know, I saw you guys reported this first.
[1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:51.840]  They won't give you credit or, hey, did you see this person lying about you in the paper?
[1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:55.160]  I know that's not true.
[1:22:55.160 --> 1:22:56.520]  And I'm one of the most banned people in the world.
[1:22:56.520 --> 1:23:01.560]  So again, it's like, InfoWars is really the only gauge right now to see where the liberty
[1:23:01.560 --> 1:23:03.120]  movement is really at.
[1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:05.600]  Trump is kind of dormant.
[1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:12.160]  You know, he's about to start having these rallies, and I'll be honest, I'm like, I just
[1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:13.920]  can't really get that excited for a Trump rally.
[1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:14.920]  I don't know.
[1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:19.320]  So maybe InfoWars will go to some of them.
[1:23:19.320 --> 1:23:21.680]  I'm just not really excited.
[1:23:21.680 --> 1:23:26.080]  You know, maybe if he made some announcement, then maybe there would be some excitement
[1:23:26.080 --> 1:23:27.080]  there.
[1:23:27.080 --> 1:23:30.720]  But to me, it's just exercise and futility at this point.
[1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:34.840]  But hey, I mean, it's fun, you know, the thing about it is that is, the reason I bring it
[1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:39.280]  up is that is one of the only other gauges out there for where the liberty movement is
[1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:40.280]  at.
[1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:43.960]  So I mean, Trump will have a rally and get 30,000, 40,000, 50,000.
[1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:47.160]  I don't know where the, I forget the venue he announced in Ohio.
[1:23:47.160 --> 1:23:50.280]  I mean, Trump could go to, he went down to Houston a few years ago.
[1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:51.880]  He went to the Toyota Center.
[1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:55.040]  It's the big NBA arena there.
[1:23:55.040 --> 1:23:58.520]  And I mean, it totally sold out, you know, 25,000 people, the stands plus the seats on
[1:23:58.520 --> 1:23:59.520]  the ground.
[1:23:59.520 --> 1:24:05.560]  So, I mean, Trump could go to a football stadium and probably fill it if they did the right
[1:24:05.560 --> 1:24:07.360]  marketing campaign.
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:08.960]  So that's the only other gauge really.
[1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:14.440]  But the fact that I can't go out without being recognized, the fact that I have friends and
[1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:18.000]  family sending me stuff almost every day like, hey, you reported that first or, hey, look,
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:23.200]  this person is lying about you and people are seeing our reports and seeing old reports
[1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:26.160]  that have come true and saying, wow, when did you report this?
[1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:32.440]  So that's just me telling you the gauge, the gauge of freedom and Americans wanting to
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:36.360]  be free is going in the right direction.
[1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:40.040]  But the gauge of tyranny is also encroaching.
[1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:41.400]  So I mean, that's the ying and yang.
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:43.080]  That's the balance.
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:49.040]  And as long as info was on the air, you know that the resistance is on.
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:55.360]  And we will be right back with more.
[1:24:55.360 --> 1:25:11.400]  All right, our champions made of here's a man who can show you

[1:27:52.520 --> 1:28:21.400]  So the crew, and I guess it was a caller into the American journal with Harrison Smith this
[1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:31.480]  morning that brought this up. And the crew is all in an uproar about this document here.
[1:28:32.920 --> 1:28:39.320]  The 2030 spike, countdown to global catastrophe. And so I don't really know much about this. I
[1:28:39.320 --> 1:28:42.760]  haven't really seen it, but I mean, literally the crews printed it three times and brought it to me,
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:49.080]  so they're panicked by what they see in this or whatever was covered on the American journal this
[1:28:49.080 --> 1:28:53.320]  morning with Harrison Smith. I was tuning in, but I must have missed this when I was getting ready
[1:28:53.320 --> 1:29:01.320]  for the Alex Jones show today. But you know, here's what I'm going to say in general, because
[1:29:03.560 --> 1:29:08.600]  the whole operating procedure of the new world order is deception.
[1:29:10.760 --> 1:29:15.320]  And so just like they faked a pandemic and are telling you manmade climate change is the biggest
[1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:21.080]  threat or white supremacy, I guess it depends on the day. That's really relevant. But the point is
[1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:28.120]  it's all a manufactured crisis. It's all manufactured. None of it's organic. None of it is
[1:29:28.120 --> 1:29:34.520]  because of divine creation or God's will for us or human activity. It's all the globalists.
[1:29:35.160 --> 1:29:40.760]  It's all the elite secret technotronic separate societies that have broken away from civilization
[1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:46.360]  in general and are now trying to plan a whole new separate society for themselves with an
[1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:52.120]  underclass of humans that they can force vaccinate, force microchip, force to be locked in a cage,
[1:29:52.120 --> 1:29:59.160]  whatever, as they sit on top of the planet. And so you'll see fake pandemics. You'll see real
[1:29:59.160 --> 1:30:04.200]  pandemics. You'll see weather manipulation. You'll see weather phenomenon. You'll see all of this
[1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:09.080]  stuff. And it'll all be blamed on humans. It'll all be blamed on you, but it'll all be the same
[1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:16.280]  group of world elites running all of it. And that's why exposing the COVID hoax is so important,
[1:30:16.280 --> 1:30:24.360]  because if you see how they ran the COVID hoax and the fake pandemic, it opens up your mind
[1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:31.080]  to understand and see the signs of all the other fraud and all the other things that they're going
[1:30:31.080 --> 1:30:36.520]  to fake in the near future, like an alien invasion or an alien attack or something with all this UFO
[1:30:36.520 --> 1:30:42.040]  scythe bull crap that's going on. And you know, and I was mentioning banned out video in the last
[1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:49.960]  segment, because here's another key to this. I have been a media, I don't even know what you
[1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:58.120]  call, I mean, addicts quite frankly, I consume 10 hours of talk radio a day. If I have extra time,
[1:30:58.120 --> 1:31:03.720]  I'm just browsing through internet video channels like YouTube, just searching for any kind of
[1:31:03.720 --> 1:31:09.320]  esoteric stuff as entertainment now, secrets of the Egyptian pyramid, secrets of the megaliths,
[1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:14.840]  is the earth flat? I mean, all of it aliens, I love all of it. It's all fun to me. And so
[1:31:17.080 --> 1:31:22.360]  what I've noticed though, is that, and I've finally been able to hone it to find the stuff that I
[1:31:22.360 --> 1:31:29.720]  like again, but the stuff that was very esoteric and kind of out there, you can't find on YouTube
[1:31:29.720 --> 1:31:35.800]  anymore. It's all shadow banned or completely banned. And you have to really dig it out to try to find it.
[1:31:38.360 --> 1:31:42.520]  And so that's why banned out video is so great, because it's just, it's all just right there.
[1:31:42.520 --> 1:31:49.800]  But why do I bring this up? Because the UFO and the alien channels that I've been following for years
[1:31:51.800 --> 1:31:56.280]  who are actually into this stuff and studying this stuff and trying to discern what's real
[1:31:56.280 --> 1:32:00.360]  and what's fake. I'm not saying I agree with all of it or not. I'm just saying I trust them with
[1:32:00.360 --> 1:32:05.320]  sources, like Secure Team 10, I think is one of the best. I forget some of the other ones out there.
[1:32:05.960 --> 1:32:13.880]  And none of them are really buying this government revelation of the UFOs. And there's one thing I
[1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:17.560]  notice, and it's the same thing that happens in any other aspect of society, whether it's politics
[1:32:17.560 --> 1:32:23.560]  or whatever, is that for any one movement, like take the Flat Earth movement. I'm not saying I'm
[1:32:23.560 --> 1:32:30.040]  Flat Earth, but what they do is they take a real debate that people are having on the internet
[1:32:31.640 --> 1:32:36.600]  and they cherry pick one person, once something becomes such a big phenomenon,
[1:32:36.600 --> 1:32:42.600]  they cherry pick one person to then synthetically make the leader of that movement. And so they
[1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:47.960]  took this one guy when the Flat Earth thing was really peaking on YouTube and then they censored
[1:32:47.960 --> 1:32:52.760]  all the Flat Earth videos on YouTube. And then Netflix picked one guy that they were going to
[1:32:52.760 --> 1:32:56.440]  do a documentary on and do their Flat Earth documentary, who then became the voice of all
[1:32:56.440 --> 1:33:02.200]  the Flat Earthers, that all the Flat Earthers reject his theories and this individual. But
[1:33:02.200 --> 1:33:07.320]  see, that's what they do is, so again, I'm not saying I'm Flat Earth, their censorship of the
[1:33:07.320 --> 1:33:13.320]  Flat Earth makes me curious, but that's what they do is they censor the real stuff out there
[1:33:14.280 --> 1:33:20.040]  that are just people questioning things, and then they take the one individual they can control
[1:33:20.040 --> 1:33:26.680]  and then they make that the entire movement, stealing the movement and saying, oh, no,
[1:33:26.680 --> 1:33:34.280]  this is the movement, now he's in control. And so they do the same thing now with the UFO phenomenon
[1:33:34.840 --> 1:33:41.480]  and so they censor all the legitimate UFO alien investigators out there and then they take one
[1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:46.040]  and they put him on national TV and they put him as the one voice of all of it. And of course,
[1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:49.320]  he's buying into everything the government says, everything the Pentagon says, oh,
[1:33:49.320 --> 1:33:54.600]  it's legit, this is the big revelation, we finally got it. And then stealing all the energy and
[1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:59.720]  attention from the real UFO investigators, alien historians, all of that stuff, and then getting
[1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:05.960]  all the focus to this one guy who's clearly controlled opposition. But see, just like
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:11.400]  everything else that's going to come that's going to be used to bring in global tyranny,
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:16.440]  it's all synthetic. And so that's why you can't live in fear, that's why fear is the greatest
[1:34:16.440 --> 1:34:23.240]  enemy. They want to use our fear against us, fear of a virus, fear of an alien, fear of whatever,
[1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:27.240]  fear of getting sick, and they use all of these things that they created
[1:34:28.920 --> 1:34:34.120]  against us as the excuse that they need to be in control because, oh, they love you so much
[1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:36.520]  when they're the ones that caused all of it. It's the classic
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:42.360]  Pied Piper scenario, except in a 21st century science fiction rollout.
[1:34:42.360 --> 1:34:49.480]  You're afraid of a virus, we'll get this vaccine, and then you've completely remade your human
[1:34:49.480 --> 1:34:56.760]  biology. I mean, seriously, like, how many people in this audience, in fact, you know what, here's
[1:34:56.760 --> 1:35:04.360]  what I think I might do. Because I'm hosting the war room again today as well. And I've got a lot
[1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:08.360]  of news I'm holding over for that anyway. But I was thinking about doing this, and now I just
[1:35:08.360 --> 1:35:14.760]  kind of want to do it right now. I should open up the phone lines and we should take calls
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:24.120]  and I'll ask you outright, and maybe you haven't even tried this yet. Are you magnetized? Is the
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:33.720]  raw meat in your fridge magnetized? Because I'm overwhelmed here with people sending me pictures
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:39.800]  and videos of how they're now human magnets. And you have people in India, and they think it's like
[1:35:39.800 --> 1:35:43.720]  a comic book like Hero or something, like they've been given superpowers. I'm not even kidding you,
[1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:49.320]  now it's a phenomenon in India. Multiple people are like, I'm a new comic book hero, I'm the
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:54.360]  magnet man. And they have like massive plates and everything, they just whole body is magnetized.
[1:35:55.480 --> 1:36:01.160]  It's from the vaccine. So what is this crazy phenomenon? I've never had a magnet stick to me.
[1:36:01.160 --> 1:36:04.760]  I know people that have never been vaccinated, but work in the healthcare industry around
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:10.840]  vaccinated people all the time, they're magnetized. People sending me videos all day long. People
[1:36:10.840 --> 1:36:17.880]  sending me entire files of videos and photos of meats and humans magnetized. They send this
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:22.600]  to me on my subscribe star. I can't even get to all of it. And again, I mean the crew consider
[1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:28.920]  and pull up videos all day long. So you know, maybe that's what I'll do in the third hour today.
[1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:33.240]  And then Paul Joseph Watson has the fourth hour. And then I can just carry it over onto the
[1:36:33.240 --> 1:36:37.560]  war room. And we can just do a mass, because how else are we really going to test this?
[1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:45.880]  Have you been vaccinated? And are you magnetized? Is the raw meat in your fridge magnetized?
[1:36:45.880 --> 1:36:53.480]  I mean, this is psycho stuff, man. I mean, forget about your politics, dude. Why the hell are humans
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:37:01.240]  and meat magnetized all of a sudden? I mean, that's not whether you like Biden or whether you like
[1:37:01.240 --> 1:37:10.680]  Trump or whatever. Like, are you a magnet, bro? So I think I'm going to do that. But I'm going to do
[1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:15.480]  it in the third hour. So I'm not going to get out the phone number right now because I'm going to
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:18.360]  come back and then I'll get out the phone number and I'm going to cover the rest of this news.
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:25.480]  But just know this, all the coming catastrophes, fake pandemics, alien invasions, terrorist
[1:37:25.480 --> 1:37:30.120]  attacks, all of it, it's all going to be false flags. It's all going to be synthetic. And they're
[1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:35.000]  going to say, look, the world is burning. Look, the world is out of control. You need global
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:44.360]  government. You need government tyranny. A 21st century science fiction, hide, Piper roll out
[1:37:44.360 --> 1:37:50.440]  where they cause all the problems and then they rush in as the heroes and seize power.
[1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:58.120]  Info wars is here because there's a war on for your mind. That's why I spent our motto for more
[1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:04.360]  than 25 years. And if you research even the UN's own admissions, over 2 billion people on planet
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:10.760]  earth out of 7.5 billion have cognitive disabilities lower IQ because of lack of iodine. That's why
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:15.720]  they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food isn't in the salt anymore. Now, regular iodine
[1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:21.880]  that you find in food is bound to different minerals. And so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:25.800]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body,
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:31.080]  it does amazing things. It's essential in the body. But we have our amazing tri iodine,
[1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:36.360]  a big shipment came in and we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever 60% off. That is
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:43.640]  survival shield x3 60% off with three types of powerful iodine tri iodine is from a patented
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:47.800]  process that stabilizes the iodine and makes it even more powerful to sell your level.
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:51.800]  You and your family will love it. It's incredible for your body. Get it info or short.com today.
[1:38:56.280 --> 1:39:00.040]  Granny do right. Granny do right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:05.560]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the
[1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:10.600]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:16.520]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[1:39:16.520 --> 1:39:24.120]  years, my skin is just really gorgeous. Actually, people think I'm 55 years old. And I was already
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:28.440]  taking your other supplements that I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[1:39:28.440 --> 1:39:32.520]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean,
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:38.200]  it doesn't happen immediately. But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay,
[1:39:38.200 --> 1:39:43.240]  you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't I don't
[1:39:43.240 --> 1:39:49.160]  have to put on derma blend anymore. You know, so anyway, it works wonderfully and it really has
[1:39:49.160 --> 1:39:57.320]  totally cleared up my skin. Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water,
[1:39:57.320 --> 1:40:01.720]  soil and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions

[1:40:56.520 --> 1:41:01.400]  2021 and I just want to say something. I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible
[1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:06.280]  crew that has come together over the years. It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:10.680]  and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show. I want you to know that I love you and I
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:15.080]  appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are spanned and quite black, it doesn't matter
[1:41:15.080 --> 1:41:20.040]  you've got red blood. And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children,
[1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:25.560]  we are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with
[1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:29.800]  you over the years. And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:36.840]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God. So please, I hope God works through you and puts
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:41.000]  a message in your heart to support us. But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:45.320]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:49.480]  and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you
[1:41:49.480 --> 1:42:11.480]  and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless.
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:30.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, Kamala Harris. I can't even deal with this man.
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:41.880]  Give me shelter. Give me shelter from this insanity. Give me shelter from this new
[1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:50.520]  world order insanity. Give me shelter from this medical tyranny. Oh, Lord, give me shelter.
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:56.280]  That's not when you turn the stones down. You turn them up when you're asking God for shelter
[1:42:56.280 --> 1:43:12.280]  from these damn tyrants.
[1:43:17.160 --> 1:43:18.280]  It's just a shot away.
[1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:28.280]  Oh, man, I'll tell you what. So now what did we what have we been telling you? What have
[1:43:28.280 --> 1:43:37.080]  we been warning you about? So you see that the left is now wanting to send Trump supporters
[1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:45.000]  to reeducation camps. The left is now chopping at the bit to become like secret FBI agents
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:52.600]  turning in their neighbors. If they don't believe Trump lost the election. And now Kamala Harris
[1:43:52.600 --> 1:43:58.040]  has just made a public statement saying that if your neighbors have not been vaccinated to go
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:06.760]  knock on their doors and harass them to take a vaccine. Remember when Whoopi Goldberg did that
[1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:13.560]  whole thing on the view? Stay out of my vagina. Stay out of my behind. Stay out of my body.
[1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:19.560]  But then they want to forcefully inject you with an experimental vaccine, even if you have immunity
[1:44:19.560 --> 1:44:25.320]  naturally to COVID. This is the most evil diabolical thing, but they show up with a rainbow
[1:44:25.320 --> 1:44:34.280]  sweater and a black lives matter flag to come rape you medically. And so now there's this video
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:41.400]  out of India. I'm reaching the point of gallows humor now folks that you're watching now where
[1:44:41.400 --> 1:44:46.120]  they're trying to force this lady to be vaccinated. She doesn't want to be vaccinated. She fights tooth
[1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:55.240]  and nail for like two minutes and then they chase her into a field. Literally chase her into a field
[1:44:55.240 --> 1:45:01.640]  to force inoculate you. And so this is exactly what the new world order is. You can't outrun it.
[1:45:01.640 --> 1:45:10.280]  You can't escape it. It will enslave you. You want to escape. There is no escape. It's totalitarian.
[1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:18.440]  It's totalitarian in its very nature, in its conception. So you will not be free if this new
[1:45:18.440 --> 1:45:25.400]  world order arrives and becomes entrenched with the AI that they're building and then putting you
[1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:33.880]  into the internet of things. Unbelievable. I thought the left was all about freedom. I thought the
[1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:38.200]  left was all about my body, my choice. No, the left is all about being brainwashed slaves.
[1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:49.080]  Unbelievable to witness this. This is the new world order materialized in a short video clip.
[1:45:49.080 --> 1:45:54.440]  Chasing an old woman through the field because she didn't want to be vaccinated.
[1:45:55.800 --> 1:46:01.080]  You can't escape it. You can't outrun it. It will force you. It will enslave you.
[1:46:01.080 --> 1:46:09.720]  Unbelievable. Stunning. Absolutely stunning. I mean, seriously, like, have you seen the
[1:46:09.720 --> 1:46:21.720]  Ver's graph of the vaccine deaths? Oh, my. Folks, I mean, we should pull the graph up, guys. Let's
[1:46:21.720 --> 1:46:27.640]  pull that graph up that we covered yesterday on the war room because I can sit here and I can cover
[1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:33.960]  for hours all the vaccine deaths. I can cover for hours all the admitted side effects. I mean,
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:41.800]  why though? I'll just show you this. This is the official vaccine adverse reaction website,
[1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:49.080]  the government website that tracks vaccine adverse reactions. This is the graph for death.
[1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:55.480]  Do you notice anything? Does anything stand out to you about this graph?
[1:46:55.480 --> 1:47:04.040]  I mean, a three year old that barely has the concept of mathematics could point out the anomaly
[1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:11.480]  in this graph. You find a five year old. You know, hi, little girl. Hi, little boy.
[1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:17.240]  I'm going to present to you a graph. Now, you tell me if you notice anything about this graph
[1:47:17.240 --> 1:47:27.000]  and every single one of them. It pretty much goes from zero for all time to all the way up. Good job,
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:34.920]  little Johnny. Wow, probably smarter than the average liberal. So again, why should I even sit
[1:47:34.920 --> 1:47:41.720]  here and cover all of the news about the deadly vaccines when I just can show you the graph that
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:48.040]  does it all for you. So it's like, guys, let's just do this, queue up some elevator music and
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:52.840]  let's just put the graph on TV. I mean, I don't know what else can I do? Again, I've been covering
[1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:58.520]  this for months. We sit here at nauseam and report all the news with the adverse adverse reactions
[1:47:58.520 --> 1:48:03.560]  from the vaccines, all the deaths. But why? Why should I? Why should I stress so much? So let me
[1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:10.200]  just guys queue up some elevator music and let's just sit back. Let's just sit back and show the
[1:48:10.200 --> 1:48:14.600]  graph of all the people dying from the vaccine. And this is the official government numbers.
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:22.200]  And they assume that less than 25% of people who have vaccine adverse reactions even report it.
[1:48:22.200 --> 1:48:26.440]  So this number, you could probably multiply by four, which is what the experts have done. There's
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:35.400]  been about 25,000 vaccine deaths. So yeah, let's, oh, yeah. Hello, Info Wars audience. You're on
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:41.960]  the Infovator. And today, instead of doing news coverage, we're just going to play some relaxing
[1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:49.960]  music and let you stare at this vaccine adverse reaction graph that shows how many people have
[1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:58.760]  died from vaccines. And if you'll notice for almost 30 years, the number was below 500. But now
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:14.920]  in the year 2021, it's up over 6,000. That's right. Ladies and gentlemen, that number is off the graph.
[1:49:15.640 --> 1:49:18.200]  This is how you respond to the vaccines killing people now.
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:33.960]  Just play some hit music and dance. Grandma just died from the vaccine. My neighbor just collapsed.
[1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:46.360]  Yeah. Take that force inoculation. Take that government mandated death. It's cool. It's
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:58.120]  trendy. Do your part.
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:11.880]  You can't be free till you take the vaccine. You can't be free till you take the vaccine.
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:22.520]  The hospitals, remember, they were so overwhelmed, so overwhelmed with TikTok
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:30.120]  dance routines. Now the hospitals can't figure out how to dispose of all the dead
[1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:35.080]  from the vaccine. But don't worry, they're making videos on TikTok. Yeah.
[1:50:41.160 --> 1:50:45.720]  Ah, celebrate that death. Celebrate that murder you're a part of.
[1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:51.800]  Celebrate being a brainwashed, mind-controlled, stooge, a dummy.
[1:50:53.880 --> 1:51:00.040]  Get your facts. Kamala Harris says it's time to harass your neighbors to get the vaccine.
[1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:05.240]  The government says I shouldn't have any rights until I get the vaccine.
[1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:13.160]  And big tech tells me just to ignore the vaccine adverse reaction graph that shows
[1:51:13.160 --> 1:51:19.960]  that deaths from the vaccine have increased 10,000-fold since the COVID vaccines roll out.
[1:51:19.960 --> 1:51:24.600]  The COVID vaccine's only been out for six months and it's already the deadliest vaccine in world
[1:51:24.600 --> 1:51:29.080]  history. Get your facts. We're going to chase you through a field in India.
[1:51:32.680 --> 1:51:39.160]  I mean, seriously, like, what? I mean, you seriously, we should just be doing comedy at this point.
[1:51:39.160 --> 1:51:45.960]  We should do a video where someone comes to my house to force inoculate me and I kind of put
[1:51:45.960 --> 1:51:50.920]  up a fight and then I run out to the parking lot and then they chase me through the parking lot
[1:51:50.920 --> 1:51:55.560]  and then I like dive into a river and I'm like swimming across the river and then they hop
[1:51:55.560 --> 1:52:00.120]  into the river, like 10 of them swimming through the river and then I'm like scaling a mountain
[1:52:00.120 --> 1:52:03.880]  and I'm like climbing up this mountain, like looking behind me desperately and I turn around
[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:07.480]  and there they are with the vaccine and the needle, like, ah, we're coming!
[1:52:07.480 --> 1:52:14.680]  I'm like skydiving off a plane, like, ah, can I, and then there's 30 people skydive off the plane
[1:52:14.680 --> 1:52:27.800]  all with needles. Oh my God, dude. Hey, put that, put that graph back on screen as we go to break.
[1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:30.680]  I'm going to give the phone number out when we come back to break.
[1:52:32.040 --> 1:52:35.640]  Have you been, have you been magnetized by the vaccine? In fact,
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:39.640]  let's take calls from all those that have died from the vaccine. Oh wait, that's right, the vaccine
[1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:47.160]  killed them, they can't call them. The equation is very simple. The mega banks control the media,
[1:52:47.160 --> 1:52:53.960]  they control big pharma, they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex,
[1:52:53.960 --> 1:52:59.560]  they control big tech, and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world,
[1:52:59.560 --> 1:53:06.760]  they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization. It is the western Christian
[1:53:06.760 --> 1:53:12.120]  idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:18.120]  that actually threatens them. So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead
[1:53:18.120 --> 1:53:25.800]  co-opt it, turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom
[1:53:25.800 --> 1:53:30.920]  and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control. That's why they target info wars,
[1:53:30.920 --> 1:53:36.040]  because we understand the keys to defeating them. But the only way our transmission gets out is if
[1:53:36.040 --> 1:53:41.400]  you promote info wars and ban that video. So redouble your efforts, we're all in this together.
[1:53:41.400 --> 1:53:52.840]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.

[1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:08.760]  More informative than the mainstream news and funnier funnier than the funniest bit on Saturday night live
[1:55:08.760 --> 1:55:13.800]  It's Infowars and that's why they hate us and by the way, we do all of it live

[1:55:31.200 --> 1:55:41.000]  All right, I'm gonna open up the phone lines. I
[1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:45.480]  Specifically want questions on this
[1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:49.200]  Or I
[1:55:49.160 --> 1:55:51.160]  Want people calling in on this issue?
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:55.000]  Have you received a vaccine and
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:55:59.320]  Or are you magnetized and
[1:55:59.320 --> 1:56:07.720]  Is the raw meat in your refrigerator magnetized so many of you may may not even know have you tried many of you
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:09.480]  may be listening to this and
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:13.800]  might try sticking a magnet on you for the first time and realize you're magnetized so
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:23.680]  The number to call in eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:30.760]  Have you been vaccinated? Are you magnetized? Is the raw meat in your fridge magnetized and what do you think all of this means?
[1:56:31.600 --> 1:56:38.880]  It can't be a coincidence that all of a sudden people and raw meat is becoming magnetized overnight as this vaccine rollout is going on
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:44.160]  It can't be coincidence that people are just now noticing this phenomenon for the first time
[1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:47.480]  So
[1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:54.400]  Are you magnetized? Are you vaccinated? Is the raw meat in your refrigerator magnetized because they just say oh, it's a conspiracy theory
[1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:56.080]  And then reporters go out
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:56:59.360]  Into downtown Austin and just ask people have you been vaccinated and they say yes
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:03.880]  They stick a magnet to their arm. They say oh, it's debunked. No, it's been fully bumped. It's double-bunked
[1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:10.920]  So we'll take your phone calls on that eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine here's last night Tucker Carlson
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:16.860]  Also funnier than Sunday excuse me a Saturday night live making fun of dawn
[1:57:17.360 --> 1:57:19.360]  LeMond
[1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:24.680]  On LeMond is a cable news host on our competitor over at CNN
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:29.240]  And most the time he talks about cable news host type things what the royals are up to
[1:57:29.520 --> 1:57:33.260]  How a commercial airliner might have flown into a black hole, you know the news
[1:57:33.960 --> 1:57:37.680]  But Don LeMond is most importantly more than that
[1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:41.240]  Don LeMond's a civil rights leader and just the other day
[1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:44.160]  He spoke to the Washington Post about his feelings on civil rights
[1:57:44.160 --> 1:57:48.000]  And he declared you may not be surprised by this that America is a racist country quote
[1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:53.960]  We're living in two different realities as black and white people said father LeMond
[1:57:54.800 --> 1:57:56.960]  It was interesting. We read that we thought well
[1:57:56.960 --> 1:58:01.520]  Here's a guy who makes millions of dollars a year for presiding over a show that is failing
[1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:04.920]  That seems like a pretty good deal, but like so many
[1:58:04.920 --> 1:58:08.800]  Don LeMond is also a victim a successful victim
[1:58:08.800 --> 1:58:14.480]  And so we asked on the victim scale on the scale of say Meghan Markle to Michelle Obama
[1:58:14.520 --> 1:58:18.880]  Just how oppressed is Don LeMond? What is the different reality?
[1:58:18.880 --> 1:58:24.860]  He is forced to live in and as a black man in America. Well, we did a little digging and hear the details
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:31.400]  Don LeMond lives in a four point three million dollar home in Sag Harbor, New York
[1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:37.640]  No, he does not live in Section 8 housing. He lives in one of the whitest towns in America. In fact, 80%
[1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:46.040]  Sag Harbor is just 3% African American. Now in the interview, Mr. LeMond said America needs to see more people like him
[1:58:46.600 --> 1:58:49.120]  He regularly lectures America about diversity
[1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:55.600]  What he didn't tell the Washington Post is that in his free time he runs away from diversity
[1:58:55.600 --> 1:58:59.560]  His reality is that he doesn't like diversity at all. None of them do
[1:58:59.560 --> 1:59:03.120]  But here's the most troubling discovery about Mr. LeMond
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:07.840]  Now you have heard from the White House from the president himself that white supremacy is a lurking threat
[1:59:07.840 --> 1:59:15.160]  You might not always see it, but it's always there like Russian spies white supremacists come in the dark of night in the most surprising
[1:59:15.400 --> 1:59:21.800]  Form their shape-shifters now. We're not calling anybody a white supremacist here, but you have to ask yourself
[1:59:21.800 --> 1:59:23.800]  We're gonna put this on the screen now
[1:59:23.840 --> 1:59:27.240]  What is this this symbol of hate?
[1:59:27.240 --> 1:59:33.160]  Symbol of hate posing as a cookie jar doing in Don LeMond's kitchen. Do you see that?
[1:59:34.120 --> 1:59:39.240]  That right there ladies and gentlemen is a white supremacist QAnon cookie jar
[1:59:39.960 --> 1:59:46.080]  Now we're not calling for the Department of Justice to look more deeply into this because that's not our place. We're a cable news show
[1:59:46.080 --> 1:59:48.320]  Not a horse. It's a Ralph Northerm statue
[1:59:49.360 --> 1:59:52.840]  All the evil men in Tarras seem to flourish as the good men do nothing
[1:59:52.840 --> 1:59:56.720]  Well, I'm trying to be a good man. I'm trying to stand up to do the right thing and I've seen
[1:59:57.280 --> 2:00:02.960]  huge effects with what we've done here in Info Wars other good men and women getting together and
[2:00:03.480 --> 2:00:05.480]  Telling the truth that's standing up to corruption
[2:00:05.880 --> 2:00:10.080]  But now the globals are coming after us and so I need your prayers. I need your financial support
[2:00:10.080 --> 2:00:14.240]  I need your word of mouth to stay in the fight. We've got a big sale going right now

[2:00:50.680 --> 2:01:09.840]  You found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with a win Troyer
[2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:18.200]  And we are into the third hour now we're about to start taking your phone calls
[2:01:18.200 --> 2:01:27.040]  Have you been vaccinated and or are you magnetized now and again if you're just joining us
[2:01:27.040 --> 2:01:34.120]  It's a worldwide phenomenon people are becoming magnetized with magnets and keys and
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:37.120]  Silverware and all this stuff sticking to them
[2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:44.360]  Unbelievable stuff sticking to raw meat as well and it's vaccinated people and now it's unvaccinated people too
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:51.600]  But so we we we asked the audience today. Have you been vaccinated and or are you magnetized is the raw meat in your fridge?
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:53.520]  magnetized
[2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:59.320]  So as we load up the lines there, let me just cover some of the rest of this news again
[2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:07.520]  The media and the Democrats are cheering for the virus and this new Delta variant, you know, because COVID is pretty much a non-issue now
[2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:16.040]  Hasn't been for a while they faked a pandemic, but even the fake pandemic is over. So now they want the new pandemic and it's this Delta variant and they're
[2:02:16.800 --> 2:02:25.800]  Rooting for it with this story in the NPR Delta variant of the coronavirus could dominate the US dominate
[2:02:27.240 --> 2:02:31.600]  It's going to dominate you just like they dominate you
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:36.600]  So, they're rooting for the virus and
[2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:40.600]  They're going to use this Delta variant
[2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:51.600]  To say oh, you're bad. You didn't get the vaccine. Oh, you're bad. You didn't wear your mask. It's all your fault. They're cheering for the virus because they want that fake moral superiority over you
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:56.600]  And then they're even saying this is I mean, here's the sub headline right here
[2:02:56.600 --> 2:03:04.600]  Another reason to get vaccinated. This is NPR publicly funded telling you to get vaccinated because of a Delta variant
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:14.600]  Even though the World Health, which is totally bought and controlled by China World Health Organization and Bill Gates tells you that the COVID vaccine won't work for the Delta variant
[2:03:15.600 --> 2:03:18.600]  But that doesn't stop NPR from lying to you
[2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:25.600]  And promoting the deadliest vaccine in world history. By the way, you can say that with confidence as a fact
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:33.600]  The COVID-19 vaccine is the deadliest vaccine in world history at least that we know of on the VAERS report that they're admitting
[2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:42.600]  It may be it may not be but from the actual statistics that they'll admit to the COVID-19 vaccine is the deadliest in human history
[2:03:42.600 --> 2:03:55.600]  And they are telling you to take it forcing you to take it saying that if you don't take it you're bad and because of the new Delta variant
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:04:01.600]  That's another reason to take it even though it doesn't work for COVID-19
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:08.600]  In fact, the COVID-19 vaccines don't work at all unless they're meant to maim and kill you then they're working fine
[2:04:08.600 --> 2:04:11.600]  But if they're supposed to stop COVID they're not working at all
[2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:20.600]  You had the cruise liner ship nothing but vaccinated people on board multiple COVID cases broke out
[2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:28.600]  In Massachusetts you now have 4,000 fully vaccinated people testing positive for COVID-19
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:38.600]  And you know Duterte looked like he may be a force against the New World Order and he still may be but he's turned into a real authoritarian and it's not good
[2:04:39.600 --> 2:04:43.600]  And now Duterte is saying you're going to get the vaccine or you're going to go to jail that's not good
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:52.600]  So imagine Duterte whose big thing was stopping the drug cartels and he shut down and killed a lot of drug dealers and drug cartels
[2:04:52.600 --> 2:04:57.600]  But now he's working for Big Pharmaceutical the most deadly drug cartel in the world
[2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:03.600]  Saying vaccine or jail boy he went wrong quick didn't he
[2:05:04.600 --> 2:05:14.600]  And then sad to see this in Russia Kremlin says people without vaccine or immunity in Russia will have limited work options
[2:05:14.600 --> 2:05:22.600]  Boy that is I can't tell if Russia is just playing along with this just pretending to play along with this or they're really doing this but
[2:05:23.600 --> 2:05:32.600]  It's a it's a worldwide agenda ladies and gentlemen it's a worldwide agenda
[2:05:33.600 --> 2:05:37.600]  And they've lied to you about this vaccine they've lied to you about this virus
[2:05:38.600 --> 2:05:40.600]  Why would you trust these people at all?
[2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:47.600]  Why would you let these people control your life when they lie to you 24-7
[2:05:48.600 --> 2:05:56.600]  And why would such an evil group of people force you to take the deadliest vaccine in known history
[2:05:57.600 --> 2:06:05.600]  That cannot be debated and you know I know all the people at left wing or right wing watch and media matters
[2:06:05.600 --> 2:06:13.600]  And all the other people that transcribe every info or show and then lie about us and then use us for clickbait every day
[2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:18.600]  What would you do without us you'd have nothing to do you would have nothing to watch you'd have nothing to report on what would you do without us
[2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:26.600]  Have you realized that yet and so you're listening right now like you understand you're not immune to this
[2:06:27.600 --> 2:06:32.600]  You may think you're in control of this whole thing right now and feel empowered by it for the first time in your life
[2:06:32.600 --> 2:06:34.600]  You're not in control of this
[2:06:35.600 --> 2:06:46.600]  So you need to start really reflecting on your lives and understand that this isn't a game this isn't a joke
[2:06:47.600 --> 2:06:51.600]  The COVID-19 vaccine is the deadliest vaccine in U.S. history
[2:06:52.600 --> 2:06:59.600]  And there's no amount of mental gymnastics you can do to hide that
[2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:07.600]  So you may be concocting some story in your head about this news coverage today and all these callers
[2:07:08.600 --> 2:07:10.600]  I'm about to take who are now magnetized by the vaccine
[2:07:11.600 --> 2:07:15.600]  But just understand this is being done to you
[2:07:16.600 --> 2:07:19.600]  And you're promoting it you're now part of it
[2:07:19.600 --> 2:07:28.600]  So you're now part of the most authoritarian global takeover in world history
[2:07:29.600 --> 2:07:35.600]  And you're being used like a stooge like a dummy like a pawn in this operation
[2:07:36.600 --> 2:07:40.600]  And you like it because it makes you feel empowered you know how powerful this group is
[2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:46.600]  But don't you realize that our fate will be your fate or you're just still in denial of that aren't you
[2:07:46.600 --> 2:07:48.600]  I guess so
[2:07:49.600 --> 2:07:52.600]  So here we go ladies and gentlemen we ask the callers
[2:07:53.600 --> 2:07:57.600]  Have you been vaccinated and are you magnetic is the raw meat in your fridge magnetic
[2:07:58.600 --> 2:08:01.600]  And again I know the audience knows this but just so people understand
[2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:04.600]  Nothing we do here is ever scripted
[2:08:05.600 --> 2:08:10.600]  I didn't even plan on taking calls so this may blow your mind what you're about to hear in the next hour
[2:08:11.600 --> 2:08:14.600]  But this is all real this is as real as it gets
[2:08:14.600 --> 2:08:20.600]  So we start with Adam in Delaware Adam. Have you been vaccinated? Are you magnetized?
[2:08:23.600 --> 2:08:25.600]  Hello, it's me. Yes. Hi
[2:08:26.600 --> 2:08:33.600]  Hi, I was I was vaccinated earlier this year and I am I work in an industrial field and you wouldn't believe it's hard to get to work
[2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:39.600]  Because of my keys my keys to my vehicle stick to my hand. It's not are you serious
[2:08:39.600 --> 2:08:44.600]  Yeah, it's not a strong. I don't people thinking that you know you can't you know walk down the street or a telephone pole
[2:08:45.600 --> 2:08:50.600]  It's gonna get you but if things stick to your hands, which is it's a strange phenomenon to say the least
[2:08:51.600 --> 2:08:55.600]  See I haven't seen that I've seen it like on the chest on the head and on the back and the arm
[2:08:56.600 --> 2:08:58.600]  But you're saying even your hand
[2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:01.600]  Well, that's the thing that's how I noticed it because it sticks to your hand
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:04.600]  You couldn't drop it and I was only vaccinated a few weeks ago
[2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:09.600]  So maybe because it happened so recently it's stronger, but it's it's concerning
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:14.600]  And so but you know because this is this is an interesting part of this experiment that we're doing right here
[2:09:15.600 --> 2:09:19.600]  You've never had a key appear to be magnetized or stick to your hand ever before
[2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:23.600]  No, because you turn your hand upside down it should fall
[2:09:25.600 --> 2:09:29.600]  So when this first happened to you and when you first noticed this what was that like
[2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:34.600]  Well, I didn't know what to do as I was at work and I was trying to pick up some tools and I was like well
[2:09:34.600 --> 2:09:36.600]  Absolutely, you know occasionally things get on your hand
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:42.600]  I was like that couldn't be anything and that it happened a few more times and I was listening to Alex talk about it
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:44.600]  And that's what you know, I put two and two together there
[2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:49.600]  And I was like wow my work forced me into getting this vaccine or else I couldn't come back
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:53.600]  And you know, it's just one thing after another it boggles the mind
[2:09:53.600 --> 2:09:59.600]  Have any of your work colleagues had the same phenomenon of being magnetized that had to take the vaccine?
[2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:04.600]  This guy work with Rocco. Rocco is he's very magnetized
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:06.600]  More so than you even
[2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:12.600]  Yes, he hasn't been Rocco hasn't been into work for several weeks now because of this because he freaked out
[2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:14.600]  Did he get the vaccine before you did?
[2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:20.600]  He was one of the main factors in getting everyone else to get the vaccine. He was you know the big we got to do this
[2:10:20.600 --> 2:10:24.600]  So he was one of the first and now he's the sickest and most magnetized
[2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:27.600]  Yes Rocco is easily the most sick out of all
[2:10:29.600 --> 2:10:34.600]  Wow all right ladies and gentlemen that's just the lead-off caller for what is going to be a very
[2:10:36.600 --> 2:10:40.600]  Scary hour quite frankly but very revealing so there you go
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:45.600]  This is just crazy man. What is this science fiction reality I'm living in
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:48.600]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast

[2:12:50.600 --> 2:13:12.600]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:30.600]  What would you say if there was a storyline in which a global government forced the population of earth to take an experimental injection
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:45.600]  That in the first six months of its release to the public has already been the deadliest vaccine in world history
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:53.600]  What would you think well that's where we are ladies and gentlemen and we're taking phone calls right now we're asking
[2:13:53.600 --> 2:14:00.600]  Have you been vaccinated and are you magnetized is the raw meat in your fridge magnetized we just had the last caller
[2:14:01.600 --> 2:14:04.600]  Explaining that phenomenon that happened to him and some of his colleagues at work
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:12.600]  So this is a very real thing and political act and wash and post and all the other liberal liars out there can say it's a conspiracy theory
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:19.600]  It's not happening you have hours and hours and hours of video I have people sending me pictures of how they're magnetized every day
[2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:28.600]  And we're going to take about 10 or so calls with people saying the same thing so let's go to Liam who has dialed in from Lee from Illinois
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:32.600]  Liam you're on the air have you been vaccinated and are you magnetized
[2:14:33.600 --> 2:14:40.600]  I'm not vaccinated nor will I ever be vaccinated but a buddy of mine at work one of my actually best friends at work
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:49.600]  Let's call him Jack he uh he always laughs at me for listening to info wars all day at work or wearing your guys hats or shirts and stuff and he always thought
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:15:03.600]  Alex was a crack pod and I mean no offense but he uh I was telling him like yeah people are getting magnetized doing kind of like laugh it off and I said you know go get go get the trail magnet off your car let's figure this out now
[2:15:03.600 --> 2:15:10.600]  So like grab and I stuck it to his arm and he like stared at it for a good 5-7 minutes and he started laughing
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:12.600]  And it stuck to his arm
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:19.600]  Yeah it stuck to his arm exactly where he got the shot and he's like no there's no way like this can't be real
[2:15:19.600 --> 2:15:36.600]  So then we found another coworker you know same thing it was a Moderna shot put it on her arm and he started freaking out and he wanted answers of what in the Sam hell did they put in my body and I mean from
[2:15:36.600 --> 2:15:49.600]  Now see imagine this though this is like the first level of subjugation or this is the first level of bowing down is that he asked to ask that question after he's gotten the vaccine
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:16:03.600]  So it's like you're already such a slave and I'm just speaking general here is that it's like the woman said from the NAACP I'm not looking at the ingredients I'm not looking at the side effects I'm not thinking about anything I'm rolling up my sleeve and I'm taking that shot
[2:16:03.600 --> 2:16:17.600]  So your friend just already fully bought in trusting of the government takes a vaccine then realizes in shock he's a magnet now and is thinking what did I put in my arm so it's like why wouldn't you ask that before you take the injection
[2:16:18.600 --> 2:16:23.600]  You've already been completely subjugated so what was the response now I mean what is he thinking now
[2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:36.600]  Well now now he he wants answers he wants to figure out what's going on I said listen man you need to sit down you need to stop caring what people think and you need to listen to infwars.com and you actually need to get answered what's going on because
[2:16:37.600 --> 2:16:46.600]  It might be too late because you can't take you know a multivitamin or detox pill or whatever and get this out of your system once it's in there it's in there you're done
[2:16:46.600 --> 2:16:57.600]  So I figured I'd call in and hopefully I can get his attention to start listening to you guys and just thank you for everything you're doing Owen you have no idea what you mean to the little people out here man
[2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:08.600]  Well thank you Liam you have our word to never give up in this fight and you know that we're not sure what that means yet but you know and I'll just say this too
[2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:19.600]  Maybe your friend wants to start listening to infwars maybe not the point is that folks you're seeing now even the level of censorship that happens at Fox News
[2:17:20.600 --> 2:17:27.600]  And so I had friends and family members that I would explain that Fox News censors yeah it's not as bad as the CNN and the MSNBC
[2:17:28.600 --> 2:17:33.600]  But Fox News controls the narrative too and they say no no no they're all good people but I mean now look at what Ivory Hecker has revealed
[2:17:33.600 --> 2:17:38.600]  Now look at what these other local Fox reporters are revealed how Fox News even censors them so
[2:17:39.600 --> 2:17:47.600]  I mean I'm just saying there's no agenda here folks nobody controls the narrative here it's just as real as it gets
[2:17:48.600 --> 2:17:56.600]  And that's why people come to infwars because they just know this is true free speech this is true free media this is people who really care trying to tell you what's going on
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:06.600]  No corporate censorship except the fact that we're censored off big tech platforms because we tell you the things that otherwise networks would censor
[2:18:07.600 --> 2:18:20.600]  Now let's move on though we're asking the callers have you been vaccinated and are you magnetized let's go now to Angus in Pennsylvania have you been vaccinated and are you magnetized
[2:18:20.600 --> 2:18:29.600]  No no I wasn't vaccinated you know I listened to a lot of the callers the last one said that he had a friend and then another friend he said she or her
[2:18:30.600 --> 2:18:39.600]  And then he turned on and said he said that I think a lot of this is disinformation one of the easiest ways to dismiss the real side effects like heart inflammation
[2:18:39.600 --> 2:18:51.600]  And these different things is to throw in some hokey bullshit okay story and try to make somebody believe that okay since that's not true then I guess the other side effects aren't true either
[2:18:52.600 --> 2:18:58.600]  But you can't deny that people are being magnetized and I listened to the last caller he said his friend was a guy and the other
[2:18:58.600 --> 2:19:08.600]  I tried my own brother man I got a tactical flashlight with a magnet on it I put it right where he got vaccinated he did Madonna they did not stick magnets will stick to other magnets
[2:19:09.600 --> 2:19:20.600]  But they will not stick to pennies they will not stick to ten it's either something slimy on their skin like sweat or you know just stickiness of skin or something it's a hoax they're trying to discredit the other
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:29.600]  So you're saying that the thousands of videos of people being magnetized and reporters going to random people on the street sticking it to their arm wiping it down
[2:19:30.600 --> 2:19:36.600]  Nurses sending me photos about how they're not vaccinated but a ten magnet stick to them you're saying that's all a hoax
[2:19:37.600 --> 2:19:42.600]  I'm saying that they can discredit the real side effects they'll make up something silly so that somebody will look at it and go
[2:19:42.600 --> 2:19:53.600]  But here's what I'm saying that's a real side effect I get what you're saying in that hey let's not distract from the facts these vaccines are killing people and the heart attacks and everything else
[2:19:54.600 --> 2:20:04.600]  I get what you're saying but see most people can't really accept that or come to terms with that but when they see a magnet stick to them that's kind of an awakening process
[2:20:04.600 --> 2:20:12.600]  I've tried people with my neighbor I tried my brother I went to the grocery store with my tactical flashlight got a manual in the back I tried every piece of poultry and hamburger meat nothing
[2:20:13.600 --> 2:20:19.600]  Well good that's it I'm glad none of these people are magnetized but you can't deny that this is a real thing
[2:20:20.600 --> 2:20:21.600]  The meat get a vaccination
[2:20:22.600 --> 2:20:23.600]  I'm sorry
[2:20:23.600 --> 2:20:27.600]  How would the meat have did the meat get a vaccination how could meat become
[2:20:27.600 --> 2:20:36.600]  I'm not providing the answers we're just learning this is all happening right now we're not going to get anybody else to do this research so I have to do it in real time on air
[2:20:37.600 --> 2:20:49.600]  But again I mean I could sit here and for hours play you videos of meat magnetized and people magnetized so I understand you're saying hey let's not distract from this the deadly nature of this vaccine with people being magnetized
[2:20:49.600 --> 2:20:58.600]  But that's a very real thing you cannot deny that that is really happening I'm glad that it's not happening to you or your family but it's definitely happening to people
[2:20:59.600 --> 2:21:07.600]  Angus thank you for the call let's go to Jose in Dallas you're on the air Jose are you vaccinated and are you magnetized
[2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:20.600]  Hey Owen I'm not vaccinated but my parents are not vaccinated either and they're getting magnetized which is weird I mean I mean they're not vaccinated and the magnet sticks on them which is so weird
[2:21:21.600 --> 2:21:32.600]  And that last caller I think he's lying to you because like you said there's a lot of evidence and I went around and tried to magnetize some of the people that were vaccinated and it does stick to them
[2:21:32.600 --> 2:21:39.600]  Well Jose hold it right there let me come back to you because I want to ask a question about your parents who have not been vaccinated but are magnetized
[2:21:40.600 --> 2:21:47.600]  And so is this an example of vaccine shedding and that's why unvaxxed nurses are magnetized and elderly who are unvaxxed are magnetized
[2:21:47.600 --> 2:22:01.600]  Your voice counts when you share information be it over the internet or in person it changes the world the globalists know their agenda is unpopular they know you're angry

[2:26:25.600 --> 2:26:33.600]  We will be victorious
[2:26:34.600 --> 2:26:50.600]  We're back here on the Alex Jones show we're taking your phone calls are you magnetized are you vaccinated Jose we held over from the break I wanted to ask Jose who says his parents are not vaccinated but magnetic so Jose I'm just curious
[2:26:50.600 --> 2:27:03.600]  do your do your parents hang out with other elderly people who have been vaccinated because maybe this is an example of the shedding that happens with these prions or whatever
[2:27:04.600 --> 2:27:15.600]  again I'm not saying I have all the answers nobody else is covering this so we're just doing it grassroots organic style here so do you why do you think your parents are magnetic even though they haven't been vaccinated
[2:27:15.600 --> 2:27:31.600]  Oh and like I said I'm not sure why are they magnetic like they're working fast within your streets so that they're probably hanging around with vaccinated people I'm not sure but I work at a cubicle you know I work at an office and all the people around me are vaccinated
[2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:45.600]  I mean I'm not magnetized I'm not vaccinated so I'm not sure I'm not sure what's going on but I have one more point to make I have a my neighbor has a 14 year old sister that went to go get vaccinated what about anybody's consent
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:28:03.600]  okay so she went with a group of friends she got vaccinated under their group of friends last night so that just comes to show you the corruption and I just want to say to all the info orders out there just take care of the kids please because this is real and the corruption is ruined it runs so deep and it just brings tears to me just hear it in my voice and it hurts me deep down inside
[2:28:03.600 --> 2:28:15.600]  our future humanity is under attack man and all of the real deal and I respect on just keep pushing up this information guys because we're under attack and it's fast
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:37.600]  yeah and I mean you people can write stories all the stuff saying it's a hoax all day long or hey why are you coming this folks this is a real international phenomenon of people having magnets stick to their arms and their heads and their chests and their backs and no one else is covering it so it's like of course I'm going to cover it
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:45.600]  let's go to Margaret called in from Massachusetts have you been vaccinated are you magnetized
[2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:55.600]  hi Owen hell no may my family are not injected I'm sorry I'm just going to correct you they're not vaccines so let's stick with we haven't been injected
[2:28:55.600 --> 2:29:09.600]  we're not magnetized but I actually checked because I was curious thank God we're not in so far the meat in our fridges and either we tend to eat high quality foods which you know we're blessed enough to be able to afford that
[2:29:09.600 --> 2:29:27.600]  but who knows how long that will last I just want to tell you quickly you're right this is the deadliest injection in experiment in human history and the there's data there's your data there's your facts people there's facts
[2:29:27.600 --> 2:29:41.600]  look it up so just so you and your listeners know some of the major Boston hospitals big Harvard affiliated hospitals are starting to realize maybe there is some type of connection
[2:29:41.600 --> 2:30:01.600]  one of the biggest ones in Boston has been in code help for over four weeks and code help is when a lot of the patients have to board in the emergency rooms because the hospital is full and unfortunately these patients have a lot of cardiac issues
[2:30:01.600 --> 2:30:17.600]  and their post vaccine so much so that the physicians are finally starting to note note excuse me and I'm sorry to cut you off but if you notice because I just want the crew to pull this up if you notice now the CDC is getting called out
[2:30:17.600 --> 2:30:32.600]  for pushing this vaccine on people and not having the emergency meetings fast enough because of all these people having heart attacks and blood clots so yeah I mean it's all come out this is truly the deadliest injection in human history
[2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:40.600]  and now the CDC who's having emergency meetings about how deadly it is are under fire for not doing it soon enough but they're still promoting it
[2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:56.600]  I know that's the outrageous part but you know your last column and I'm not picking on him Angus or a few calls before just because he's not magnetized doesn't mean that other people want he needs to educate himself and his friends and his family
[2:30:56.600 --> 2:31:14.600]  he can go to Dr. Tenpenny or Dr. Madej's website there's plenty of information out there but these people better wake up and I mean I find it kind of sickening and I'm sorry but people who look at him are magnetic and like it's cute and funny and it's a tick talk subject
[2:31:15.600 --> 2:31:21.600]  these people need to wake up this isn't funny and they need to be lying eyes
[2:31:21.600 --> 2:31:34.600]  well and that's it exactly it's like fine okay say whatever you want or think whatever you want about Owen Troyer and Info Wars I'll put on elevator music and dance and just show you the bears graph
[2:31:35.600 --> 2:31:47.600]  I mean it's just like boop just straight up here's vaccine deaths and it's like basically zero and boop just straight up and they even admit most people that have vaccine side effects or deadly reactions don't even report it
[2:31:47.600 --> 2:32:00.600]  and so the numbers are who knows how many people have died from the vaccine I mean seriously folks Hank Aaron one of the greatest baseball legends of all time dies after getting the vaccine
[2:32:01.600 --> 2:32:11.600]  and then they barely even do anything for Hank Aaron's life and times because they know he died of the vaccine and so they just bury Hank Aaron's history and his great life and his great MLB career
[2:32:11.600 --> 2:32:20.600]  so that's just one example thank you for the call Margaret let's go to Robert in Washington have you been vaccinated and are you magnetized
[2:32:20.600 --> 2:32:46.600]  okay no I did not take the vaccine but yes I am magnetized okay the medication I was taking for is called humera it's an auto injection they see take it twice a month okay I was taking it for my medical condition but anyways though but since you guys had mentioned this I just had to test it out myself so the parts of my arm where I was injecting myself okay yes those areas are magnetized okay even after several months when I stopped taking the medication they switched me over to the
[2:32:46.600 --> 2:33:04.600]  but even still it is still magnetized okay the medication I take is called humera okay now they've had problems before this product though and even the trial stage people have had neurological issues when they took humera and the company even got sued also
[2:33:04.600 --> 2:33:16.600]  okay it's like a multi-billion dollar product and a product called humera it's also for auto injection basically it goes through and it suppresses the immune system okay that's part of what it does okay but yes I am magnetized
[2:33:17.600 --> 2:33:22.600]  so did you bring this up to the doctors that prescribed you that did they say anything about that
[2:33:22.600 --> 2:33:35.600]  yes I did I matter of fact I talked to them because the new medication I told I wouldn't take that because of what was going on with me right now and as a matter of fact I asked if I could see the matter of fact because I'm going to the shock clinic
[2:33:36.600 --> 2:33:48.600]  so I asked if I could see information on it they actually allowed me to take pictures of the outside the box of the new medication I saw some of the paperwork on that but now as far as for the humera itself though now that did someone else in the shock clinic they also called me up
[2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:58.600]  I talked to them and explained to them yes I'm magnetized so they looked at the other materials that are in it and they're like well we can't see what there's any type of like metal particles in it though so they couldn't understand
[2:33:59.600 --> 2:34:05.600]  why it is that was happening you know so I explained to them hey look okay so I'm just going to kind of want to do some more research into this
[2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:12.600]  but I've researched this product before though and in the trial stage for humera people have had neurological issues though and they've actually sued the company
[2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:20.600]  people have I've actually found a law from online where they're supporting people they were suing the company because they did not report that people are having neurological issues with humera
[2:34:21.600 --> 2:34:26.600]  okay so but yes both of my arms where I was getting injections and all that though they are magnetized
[2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:33.600]  and you know the other thing about this too is that no two vaccines are necessarily the same this is an experimental vaccine
[2:34:33.600 --> 2:34:41.600]  and so and no two bodies are the same so some people may get magnetized some people might not some people some vaccines may do something to you others may not
[2:34:42.600 --> 2:34:47.600]  so this is all an experiment nobody else is reporting on it in live time so this is just human intelligence from the ground
[2:34:48.600 --> 2:34:56.600]  Robert thank you so much for calling in but to deny that this phenomenon is happening is just ridiculous it's just ridiculous
[2:34:56.600 --> 2:35:04.600]  and it's a slap in the face for the people that are having magnets stick to them and there's just like freaking out you say oh it's not exist
[2:35:05.600 --> 2:35:13.600]  so no it definitely exists so we're going to continue to take your calls the callers still still calling in I may continue this on to the war room
[2:35:14.600 --> 2:35:20.600]  I still got a bunch of news to cover but this is just too much and nobody else is covering this angle so we may just continue to do this for three hours on the war room

[2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:17.600]  And for the second day in a row, I have six hours worth of news to cover.
[2:40:17.600 --> 2:40:25.600]  We are reaching out to America's nurses, what I call our Aaron Olszewski, with just...
[2:40:25.600 --> 2:40:31.600]  I don't have time to really look into this, I was just kind of browsing through this in the break, the crew brought this to me.
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:33.600]  Here, I'll just read one of the headlines in a series of them.
[2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:41.600]  Florida Republican recorded threatening opponent with Russian hit squad, close battle combat, Mack Ten's silencers.
[2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:51.600]  And you may have heard of Anna Polina Luna, and this guy is saying he's going to kill her as a sacrifice with Hitman.
[2:40:51.600 --> 2:41:01.600]  On a recording by Aaron Olszewski, who's now being attacked by the mainstream media, simply for recording a guy threatening to kill a political opponent.
[2:41:01.600 --> 2:41:03.600]  What?
[2:41:03.600 --> 2:41:16.600]  So we're going to try to get her on the war room, and then I've got tons of news still to cover on the war room today, and I've got people on the line calling in about how they're magnetized, either from the vaccine or from the vaccine shedding.
[2:41:16.600 --> 2:41:20.600]  So we're doing it all today on the war room, we're doing it all today on the Alex Jones show.
[2:41:20.600 --> 2:41:28.600]  And let's go back out to the line now to Alex, called in from Dallas. You're on the air, Alex, go ahead.
[2:41:28.600 --> 2:41:37.600]  Hi, Owen, how are you? I just called in basically to talk about the Moderna patent that I actually found online.
[2:41:37.600 --> 2:41:50.600]  And I wanted to point out that in their patents, they admit that they have a protein called ferritin, which basically has a function of iron storage in the cell.
[2:41:50.600 --> 2:42:00.600]  So this is obviously magnetized. It's iron. And not only that, I'm looking at a fact checkers right here that says it doesn't contain a luciferase.
[2:42:00.600 --> 2:42:06.600]  It's also a lye. It has another protein in it. It's called limousine synthase.
[2:42:06.600 --> 2:42:13.600]  The way they do this is it's like luciferase is a sub ingredient of an ingredient.
[2:42:13.600 --> 2:42:20.600]  And so they just say, oh, there's no luciferase, but luciferase is just a sub ingredient of the ingredients they list.
[2:42:20.600 --> 2:42:24.600]  Exactly. So this is a bacterial form of luciferase. It absolutely has it in it.
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:34.600]  But it also has, what is it here? Oh, collodial silicone oxide, which is basically a quantum nanoparticle, the quantum dot.
[2:42:34.600 --> 2:42:43.600]  So that is all in this vaccine. I sent you guys the patent on the whistleblower. Email has all this research on it.
[2:42:43.600 --> 2:42:52.600]  It is magnetic. And the scary thing about this is that this could actually be used as a strategy for nervous system control.
[2:42:52.600 --> 2:42:59.600]  And I've also included all of those studies. So basically the mechanism for this is they use an adenovirus vector, right?
[2:42:59.600 --> 2:43:05.600]  It has the crystallographic geometric parameters that are suitable for quantum computing.
[2:43:05.600 --> 2:43:16.600]  And I've also included that in the study. The silicone quantum dot is used for photopolymerization and as a catalyst for neuronal prosthesis.
[2:43:16.600 --> 2:43:25.600]  So basically creating false neurons and for enhancing the quantum yield.
[2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:31.600]  So this is actually really scary. And by the way, the crew is pulling this stuff up.
[2:43:31.600 --> 2:43:38.600]  We had stories back in May saying how they were bragging about turning people into magnets to control their brains.
[2:43:38.600 --> 2:43:44.600]  There's another video that just went up in infowars.com. I was going to cover later on the war room where this guy says,
[2:43:44.600 --> 2:43:50.600]  no, we have to genetically modify humans. So I mean, they're not even hiding it anymore.
[2:43:50.600 --> 2:44:01.600]  So again, I don't want to go back about all this existential stuff about how many times have humans gone through periods of synthetic or forced evolution like this.
[2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:09.600]  But I mean, that's what we're going into right now. This is forced evolution. This is synthetic evolution of humanity.
[2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:17.600]  And we are being built and programmed to be enslaved in a 21st century technotronic era.
[2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:23.600]  I mean, it's just it's incredible that we're actually witnessing this and experiencing this right now, and it'll be the same thing.
[2:44:23.600 --> 2:44:28.600]  And they'll just discount all this and call it crazy. Just like they said, the Wuhan lab leak theory was crazy.
[2:44:28.600 --> 2:44:33.600]  Now it's all true. Everybody knows it. So that's just the trend. Alex, thank you so much for sharing that with us.
[2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:40.600]  Let's go to Jane in Florida. Jane, you're on the Alex Jones show. Are you vaccinated and are you magnetic?
[2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:48.600]  I'm not vaccinated, but my family was over this past weekend and my stepmother, her arm was magnetic. She had had the Pfizer shot.
[2:44:48.600 --> 2:44:52.600]  And it only stuck to the area where the vaccine was administered.
[2:44:52.600 --> 2:44:55.600]  And what did you stick on her arm, a magnet or what?
[2:44:55.600 --> 2:45:01.600]  Yeah, I took two magnets off my fridge. I got a small one and a big like clamp one and I put both of them on her.
[2:45:01.600 --> 2:45:09.600]  They both stuck to that area. She said that it kind of stung whenever it got into that that vaccine area that kind of bothered her skin.
[2:45:09.600 --> 2:45:11.600]  Like a tingling sensation?
[2:45:11.600 --> 2:45:15.600]  Yeah, I kind of like just like a tingling feeling kind of stinging.
[2:45:15.600 --> 2:45:23.600]  And she was she was freaked out. She had never heard about this whole vaccine magnet magnetized phenomenon that was going on.
[2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:27.600]  My dad also had taken the vaccine and he's not magnetic.
[2:45:27.600 --> 2:45:33.600]  So clearly there's just it's certain people are magnetized and certain people are not magnetized.
[2:45:33.600 --> 2:45:44.600]  And the insane part is you can go Google right now vaccine mag magnetic and articles just today saying, you know, USA today saying that no fact check these vaccines are magnetic.
[2:45:44.600 --> 2:45:55.600]  And again, this is why it's so key that we expose all of their cover ups, whether it's the Wuhan lab leak or all their other stuff, because they just continually lie and they're doing it again.
[2:45:55.600 --> 2:45:59.600]  Oh, people aren't being magnetized. Oh, magnets are speaking. It's a conspiracy theory.
[2:45:59.600 --> 2:46:03.600]  They did the same thing with the Wuhan lab leak a year and a half ago. Now they're admitting it's real.
[2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:13.600]  So I mean, when are people going to catch on that when this news really breaks, they cover it up and then they tell you the truth like a year and a half, two years after.
[2:46:13.600 --> 2:46:22.600]  You could just go through articles upon articles from USA today wired health magazine all saying that what I saw is impossible and it's not happening.
[2:46:22.600 --> 2:46:25.600]  Yeah, don't believe your own lion eyes.
[2:46:25.600 --> 2:46:26.600]  Exactly.
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:32.600]  Unbelievable, but that's part of the overwrite of humanity is as you have no consciousness anymore.
[2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:36.600]  You have no you have no unique individual experience anymore.
[2:46:36.600 --> 2:46:40.600]  Nothing organic is just whatever the Internet told me I didn't see this happen.
[2:46:40.600 --> 2:46:45.600]  It's just really thick and when does it end, you know, when does it stop?
[2:46:45.600 --> 2:46:54.600]  Yeah, well, there's the ultimate question. Thank you for the call, Jane. Let's go to Jeff in Canada. Have you been vaccinated? Are you magnetic?
[2:46:54.600 --> 2:46:57.600]  A little background. Oh, and I took the Trump shots.
[2:46:57.600 --> 2:47:04.600]  I took the one Moderna and the Pfizer shot one for the free hamburger and one shot for the free beer.
[2:47:04.600 --> 2:47:08.600]  And that's all you didn't milk the system for more.
[2:47:08.600 --> 2:47:14.600]  Well, I'm just going to let you know I've since then I've taken 10 shots in the past two months.
[2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:20.600]  I won two state vaccine lotteries and a new Ford from Kiams Ford.
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:26.600]  Basically, everything is magnetized now, like libtards, Karen's literally can't shake them off.
[2:47:26.600 --> 2:47:32.600]  Oh, and I've tried bear spray, pepper spray, buckshot. They just keep coming.
[2:47:32.600 --> 2:47:42.600]  Yeah, you like walk through you walk through a like a souvenir shop in the magnet section and then did they just all fly to you?
[2:47:42.600 --> 2:47:52.600]  Basically, I went through a drive through. I'm not going to say the name of the place on air, but I took I went through the drive through and they're like literally coming through the drive through window.
[2:47:52.600 --> 2:47:58.600]  It's like a fricking tractor beam on, you know, it's like I'm magnetized.
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:08.600]  But seriously, Owen, there is no virus, but a lab leak fable lens to the lie and the collective belief of virus exists.
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:12.600]  If there was a pandemic, we would have been dropping like flies.
[2:48:12.600 --> 2:48:18.600]  But instead, they switched out the flu with COVID-19 and I'll finish with this.
[2:48:18.600 --> 2:48:31.600]  Once you realize they lied to you about the virus, you'll realize this was all to roll out an unproven toxic vaccine shot on a panic induced population.
[2:48:31.600 --> 2:48:36.600]  World over question everything. Where is Dr. Fauci?
[2:48:36.600 --> 2:48:46.600]  Have a good day, Owen. Absolutely. And where is Don Weijong or the Chinese defector that said this was a Chinese bio weapon? Where's he as well?
[2:48:46.600 --> 2:48:51.600]  And by the way, we can debate is there viruses are not. That's perfectly fine. That's healthy.
[2:48:51.600 --> 2:48:57.600]  What's undeniable is that this is an experimental injection that's killing people the deadliest ever.
[2:48:57.600 --> 2:49:05.600]  Let's go now to Chuck in Indiana. Chuck, are you vaccinated and are you magnetized?
[2:49:05.600 --> 2:49:14.600]  No, Owen, I have not taken the vaccine. Actually, I called in because a coworker of mine, she had COVID.
[2:49:14.600 --> 2:49:24.600]  I'd say about a month or two ago. She's in her mid sixties and after she recovered, her doctors recommended her getting the vaccine.
[2:49:24.600 --> 2:49:31.600]  She took the vaccine had troubles breathing fever, you know, sort of having COVID symptoms again.
[2:49:31.600 --> 2:49:41.600]  They took her to the hospital. They put her on a respirator, put her on life support and then another week went by and she passed away.
[2:49:41.600 --> 2:49:46.600]  That doctor is guilty of malpractice.
[2:49:46.600 --> 2:49:58.600]  Yeah, and the thing that's actually funny, sorry to cut you off, the thing that's actually funny is when you read the obituary, they say that she died from COVID, not that she recovered from COVID and took the shot and then died.
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:07.600]  And so I don't want to sit here and think that that doctor is evil, but winningly or unwittingly, that doctor just murdered that woman.
[2:50:07.600 --> 2:50:15.600]  And he should have known that if you've had COVID and you have natural immunity to it, that the vaccine is actually more deadly.
[2:50:15.600 --> 2:50:23.600]  So either through malpractice or ignorance, he just killed that lady with the COVID vaccine.
[2:50:23.600 --> 2:50:31.600]  You know, and you know, here in the, I'm up in Northern Indiana, you know, this is kind of Trump country up here, not a lot of people.
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:38.600]  We got to go to break. I'll do five more minutes of phone calls and then pull Joseph Watson.
[2:50:38.600 --> 2:50:56.600]  Info Wars is here because there's a war on for your mind. That's why it's been our motto for more than 25 years. And if you research even the UN's own admissions, over 2 billion people on planet Earth out of 7.5 billion have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[2:50:56.600 --> 2:51:00.600]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore.
[2:51:00.600 --> 2:51:08.600]  Now, regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals, and so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[2:51:08.600 --> 2:51:14.600]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body, it does amazing things. It's essential in the body.
[2:51:14.600 --> 2:51:22.600]  But we have our amazing tri-iodine, a big shipment came in, and so we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.
[2:51:22.600 --> 2:51:27.600]  That is survival shield X3, 60% off with three types of powerful iodine.
[2:51:27.600 --> 2:51:34.600]  Tri-iodine is from a patented process that stabilizes the iodine, and makes it even more powerful to sell at your level.
[2:51:34.600 --> 2:51:38.600]  You and your family will love it. It's incredible for your body. Get it at InfoWars.com today.
[2:51:43.600 --> 2:51:47.600]  Ranny Dewright. Ranny Dewright. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[2:51:47.600 --> 2:51:57.600]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[2:51:57.600 --> 2:52:01.600]  I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[2:52:01.600 --> 2:52:07.600]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[2:52:07.600 --> 2:52:16.600]  People think I'm 55 years old, and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do,
[2:52:16.600 --> 2:52:21.600]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately,
[2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:29.600]  but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know?
[2:52:29.600 --> 2:52:47.600]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:52:47.600 --> 2:52:59.600]  All right, final five minutes with your fill-in host for Alex today, Owen Schreuer, and then Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[2:52:59.600 --> 2:53:09.600]  This has been so powerful with these callers. I'm going to repeat this process on the War Room today, and I'll also cover all the news I didn't get to for the three hours of the War Room.
[2:53:09.600 --> 2:53:14.600]  But Paul Joseph Watson about to take over will take a couple more calls, but I'm going to repeat this process on the War Room,
[2:53:14.600 --> 2:53:19.600]  opening up the phone lines and asking, have you been vaccinated? Are you magnetized?
[2:53:19.600 --> 2:53:23.600]  And we'll just continue to get this report from Boots on the Ground, because no one else will even cover it.
[2:53:23.600 --> 2:53:29.600]  So we'll just knock it out of the park and just put it all out there, and, you know, we'll see if anybody else wants to talk about it.
[2:53:29.600 --> 2:53:35.600]  Let's go to Jay in Virginia. Jay, are you vaccinated and are you magnetized?
[2:53:35.600 --> 2:53:47.600]  Hey, Owen. No, I'm not vaccinated or there's terminal shot, but I did have a graduation party for my daughter here three weeks ago,
[2:53:47.600 --> 2:53:57.600]  and I showed up late and got to talk about the shot. So I tried it on three different people, didn't know what they took at the time.
[2:53:57.600 --> 2:54:05.600]  So there was Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, and the fireman shot, and every person I tested with the magnet test.
[2:54:05.600 --> 2:54:08.600]  And these were high school graduates, just graduated?
[2:54:08.600 --> 2:54:13.600]  Yeah, no, these are college graduates, but I tested their parents.
[2:54:13.600 --> 2:54:20.600]  Okay, so you just tested a wide variety, all ages, different shots, and they all had magnets stick to them?
[2:54:20.600 --> 2:54:27.600]  Yeah, about 30 people on that deck were not first to the first person, and the first person, she freaked out, the deck got quiet.
[2:54:27.600 --> 2:54:32.600]  My ex-wife came out, said, oh, you planned tricks, try me, and it stuck to her arm.
[2:54:32.600 --> 2:54:38.600]  That other lady walked up to me, and she said, can you try me? I said, sure, try her.
[2:54:38.600 --> 2:54:43.600]  And I tell you what, there were three or four other people sitting there, they said, please do not try me, I don't want to know.
[2:54:43.600 --> 2:54:50.600]  See, and here's the thing, this is like, folks, this just shows you how the actual practice of journalism is dead.
[2:54:50.600 --> 2:54:58.600]  This is Pulitzer Prize winning stuff here, and that's not me patting myself on the back, tearing on, I should get an award.
[2:54:58.600 --> 2:55:00.600]  I couldn't care less about an award.
[2:55:00.600 --> 2:55:06.600]  I'm saying, this is an incredible phenomenon of people becoming magnetized.
[2:55:06.600 --> 2:55:09.600]  It's directly connected to an experimental injection.
[2:55:09.600 --> 2:55:16.600]  It's like, and I just have to open up phone lines to get people's reports organically here, because no one else would report on it.
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:20.600]  It's like, this is crazy, this is like Pulitzer Prize winning stuff.
[2:55:20.600 --> 2:55:24.600]  You get to the bottom of this, I mean, you should be a hero, but all the media is compromised.
[2:55:24.600 --> 2:55:28.600]  All the media is in the pocket on the take from Big Pharma.
[2:55:28.600 --> 2:55:36.600]  So it's just like, okay, fine, we'll just do it live on InfoWars, and it'll act like it's not going on, and they'll continue to censor us.
[2:55:36.600 --> 2:55:44.600]  And it's just unbelievable, and like Jay just said, folks, people will be stunned when you try this experiment on them at home.
[2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:46.600]  They will be stunned.
[2:55:46.600 --> 2:55:55.600]  It's a consciousness expanding, mind opening, eye opening thing, because it's, I mean, because, you see, we're still all connected in a way,
[2:55:55.600 --> 2:56:01.600]  and so there's still that consciousness, and people are in denial that they're under attack from the poison in the food and the water and the air and all of it.
[2:56:01.600 --> 2:56:06.600]  But it's like, now you have the direct evidence undeniable why the hell am I a magnet?
[2:56:06.600 --> 2:56:08.600]  You're under attack.
[2:56:08.600 --> 2:56:16.600]  There is a global government that at the foundation is eugenics and population control.
[2:56:16.600 --> 2:56:21.600]  You're now experiencing it in real time.
[2:56:21.600 --> 2:56:25.600]  Let's take another call before I sign off from Ray in Canada.
[2:56:25.600 --> 2:56:26.600]  You're on the Alex Jones show.
[2:56:26.600 --> 2:56:27.600]  Are you vaccinated?
[2:56:27.600 --> 2:56:29.600]  Are you magnetized, Ray?
[2:56:29.600 --> 2:56:33.600]  No, sir, no vaccine, no magnetization from this guy.
[2:56:33.600 --> 2:56:37.600]  I bet I'll never, ever take that stuff.
[2:56:37.600 --> 2:56:47.600]  I had a book on that I read a few years ago, and I didn't even remember it until yesterday when I heard Mike Adams talking about the possible 5G connection.
[2:56:47.600 --> 2:56:52.600]  The book is called Cell, and it's by Stephen King, and it's from 2006.
[2:56:52.600 --> 2:56:58.600]  And basically what happens in this book is a call goes out.
[2:56:58.600 --> 2:57:04.600]  And anybody who's on their phones at the time that this call goes out gets turned into a zombie.
[2:57:04.600 --> 2:57:06.600]  It's absolutely terrifying.
[2:57:06.600 --> 2:57:20.600]  And that's also part of the plot line of the film Kingsman, where this tech billionaire elite gives out free phones with internet.
[2:57:20.600 --> 2:57:30.600]  But in the microchip is this receiver, and once he flicks the switch, the humans interact with the receiver and start going crazy and killing themselves and everybody.
[2:57:30.600 --> 2:57:32.600]  So yeah, is it predictive programming?
[2:57:32.600 --> 2:57:38.600]  Is it just future sight seeing where society is going, knowing how corrupt it all is?
[2:57:38.600 --> 2:57:40.600]  But we're seeing all of it rolled out right now.
[2:57:40.600 --> 2:57:41.600]  All right, I sign off.
[2:57:41.600 --> 2:57:42.600]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[2:57:42.600 --> 2:57:47.600]  I'll be back on the war room in 50 minutes.
[2:57:47.600 --> 2:57:50.600]  Gerald of South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air trying to move quicker.
[2:57:50.600 --> 2:57:51.600]  Hey, Alex.
[2:57:51.600 --> 2:57:52.600]  Welcome.
[2:57:52.600 --> 2:57:56.600]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[2:57:56.600 --> 2:57:59.600]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year.
[2:57:59.600 --> 2:58:06.600]  Okay, I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[2:58:06.600 --> 2:58:08.600]  Living defense saved my life.
[2:58:08.600 --> 2:58:12.600]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[2:58:12.600 --> 2:58:14.600]  Living defense brought me back.
[2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:17.600]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible.
[2:58:17.600 --> 2:58:20.600]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[2:58:20.600 --> 2:58:22.600]  This is Matthew 24 verse nine.
[2:58:22.600 --> 2:58:27.600]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you.
[2:58:27.600 --> 2:58:31.600]  And you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[2:58:31.600 --> 2:58:37.600]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[2:58:37.600 --> 2:58:39.600]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[2:58:39.600 --> 2:58:43.600]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[2:58:43.600 --> 2:58:47.600]  That's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[2:58:47.600 --> 2:58:49.600]  Thank you.
[2:59:18.600 --> 2:59:24.600]  I'm not going to spend the first 30 minutes banging on about coronavirus lockdown rules here in the United Kingdom.
[2:59:24.600 --> 2:59:30.600]  Probably we'll get onto that later, but I'm going to start the show with something a little more relevant and fresh,
[2:59:30.600 --> 2:59:37.600]  which is the Juneteenth violence in America, in Chicago and other cities over the weekend.
[2:59:37.600 --> 2:59:47.600]  And more specifically, the new attempts by media outlets and fact checkers, which as we know now solely exist to bury true information,
[2:59:47.600 --> 2:59:52.600]  literally the opposite purpose of what they're purported to exist for,
[2:59:52.600 --> 3:00:03.600]  choosing to now urge news organizations not to report on crime stories with a specific attention on local crime stories for local TV stations,
[3:00:03.600 --> 3:00:07.600]  because it could be seen as racist. I wonder why.
[3:00:07.600 --> 3:00:18.600]  Headline out of Summit News, fact checker pointer demands local news reduce coverage crime stories because it fuels systemic racism.
[3:00:18.600 --> 3:00:27.600]  This is fact checking Institute pointer, which again controls a lot of the Facebook fact checking was instrumental in burying a lot of the true information
[3:00:27.600 --> 3:00:33.600]  on the source, the origin of the coronavirus out the Wilhelm Institute of virology.
[3:00:33.600 --> 3:00:38.600]  Well, now that they've been proven sufficient, efficient in suppressing that kind of information,
[3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:46.600]  they've turned their attention to crime in the United States and are now demanding that local news stations reduce coverage of stories that connect,
[3:00:46.600 --> 3:00:52.600]  quote, black and brown communities to violent crime because it's fueling systemic racism.
[3:00:52.600 --> 3:01:02.600]  Black lives matter. If every black lives like black life matters, then maybe we should look at the actual primary cause of how black people lose their lives,
[3:01:02.600 --> 3:01:10.600]  which as we know from all the statistics is literally in terms of murder homicide, 90% of the black people perpetrating the crime.
[3:01:10.600 --> 3:01:15.600]  You think that if people really cared about black lives, that would be front and center of the narrative.
[3:01:15.600 --> 3:01:22.600]  Not only is it not, but now pointer is demanding that news organizations don't even talk about it.
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:29.600]  The Institute, which oversees the international fact checking network, which operates politic fact, which again,
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:35.600]  when they put this tag on news stories on Facebook, it not only serves to debunk the news story,
[3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:41.600]  despite the fact that as we'll see in a moment, literally the opposite of what they're saying is true.
[3:01:41.600 --> 3:01:47.600]  It serves to relegate in the algorithm that news story on the likes of Facebook, Instagram or Twitter,
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:54.600]  therefore decreasing its spread. We've seen for years in the past news websites,
[3:01:54.600 --> 3:02:02.600]  removing their comment sections entirely because they saw the studies which showed that people who read the news article go off the comments
[3:02:02.600 --> 3:02:07.600]  to judge how accurate or trustworthy it is. Now they've got this new manipulation technique,
[3:02:07.600 --> 3:02:13.600]  which is fact checking on social media websites, and they put out a statement today, or yesterday,
[3:02:13.600 --> 3:02:20.600]  this is pointer, the fact checking network, which basically any news organization has to abide by,
[3:02:20.600 --> 3:02:28.600]  they have to get their seal of approval or their content gets relegated in the algorithm, even before the fact check.
[3:02:28.600 --> 3:02:32.600]  They said that they're urging journalists to break the cycle of crime reporting,
[3:02:32.600 --> 3:02:37.600]  and they added arrest for misdemeanors disproportionately affect people of colour.
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:44.600]  Gee, I wonder why that is. Is it because those people are more likely to get involved in confrontations with police and commit crimes?
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:50.600]  The FBI statistics say exactly that, but no, apparently it's just because we're all racist.
[3:02:50.600 --> 3:02:58.600]  Systemic racism compounds the injustice as reviews have shown prosecutors are more likely to exclude black jurors from trials.
[3:02:58.600 --> 3:03:02.600]  The crime and courts be exist because it's constantly churning out stories.
[3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:10.600]  Well, if you've literally got mass shootings taking place in major cities, then yeah, they should probably be covering those stories.
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:19.600]  As much of that content is directly related to public safety, journalists can be smarter, literally calling for them to be dumb,
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:27.600]  to close their eyes, put their fingers in their ears and be dumb about it, but yeah, let's use the word smarter.
[3:03:27.600 --> 3:03:31.600]  About who we cover and the follow up stories we provide.
[3:03:31.600 --> 3:03:40.600]  This is Kelly McBride, who chairs the Craig Newmark Centre for Ethics and Leadership, literally the complete opposite of ethics once again,
[3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:45.600]  said local news reporters have amplified narratives that connect black and brown communities to crime.
[3:03:45.600 --> 3:03:52.600]  Really wonder why that is as a result we have fostered systemic racism through our crime coverage.
[3:03:52.600 --> 3:04:01.600]  So they're literally telling news stations, if you know, through the back door, not explicitly, but it's overwhelmingly being suggested,
[3:04:01.600 --> 3:04:12.600]  that if violent crimes are committed by black or brown people, don't cover them or at least drastically reduce your coverage of them because that's racist.
[3:04:12.600 --> 3:04:18.600]  Doesn't matter if they're actually perpetrating the crimes which they are, and I'm going to come on to that with the Juneteenth weekend,
[3:04:18.600 --> 3:04:23.600]  just cover it up, just don't say anything about it and then maybe it'll go away, maybe it won't exist.
[3:04:23.600 --> 3:04:29.600]  No, not to the victims of those crimes, who by the way are overwhelmingly other black people.
[3:04:29.600 --> 3:04:35.600]  So sod them, let's just not even talk about 90% black on black homicide, shall we?
[3:04:35.600 --> 3:04:37.600]  Because it's racist to talk about it.
[3:04:37.600 --> 3:04:44.600]  Those black people are still dying, but maybe if you just pretend it doesn't exist, then at least we can't be called racist.
[3:04:44.600 --> 3:04:50.600]  And that's more important than people actually dying according to these people.
[3:04:50.600 --> 3:04:55.600]  Statement continues, says it's within our power as journalists to break that cycle.
[3:04:55.600 --> 3:05:03.600]  So you're literally telling news stations to not give coverage to black lives that have been lost as a result of homicide,
[3:05:03.600 --> 3:05:07.600]  simply because the perpetrators of those crimes are other black people.
[3:05:07.600 --> 3:05:16.600]  So you're literally devaluing black lives in order to stop racism. Okay, that makes sense.
[3:05:16.600 --> 3:05:19.600]  Continues, it says it's within our power as journalists to break that cycle.
[3:05:19.600 --> 3:05:24.600]  We don't need to publicize the crime blotter simply because it fills airtime or generates clicks.
[3:05:24.600 --> 3:05:30.600]  Oh yeah, so now they're concerned about clickbait all of a sudden.
[3:05:30.600 --> 3:05:41.600]  The announcement was made at the same time that Politifact asserted that claim the Austin American statesman deliberately omitted a mass shooting suspect's description because he was black is false.
[3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:50.600]  However, the original report stated the reason for not including a description of the suspect was because it could quote be harmfully perpetuating stereotypes,
[3:05:50.600 --> 3:05:53.600]  meaning that Politifact is outright lying.
[3:05:53.600 --> 3:06:06.600]  The Austin American statesman responded to this mass shooting I think it was about a week ago now or 10 days ago by refusing to report the identity of the suspect who within hours turned out to be black
[3:06:06.600 --> 3:06:18.600]  because they didn't want to perpetuate harmful stereotypes so explicitly censoring the suspect's identity despite the fact that it was being widely reported at the time because they don't want to be called racist.
[3:06:18.600 --> 3:06:32.600]  And then Politifact fact checks this and says that that claim that the Austin American statesman censored the suspect's identity because they didn't want to know that he was black is false.
[3:06:32.600 --> 3:06:33.600]  It's not false.
[3:06:33.600 --> 3:06:38.600]  It's 100% true based on their own frigging statement.
[3:06:38.600 --> 3:06:47.600]  Once again, these fact checking organizations literally exist to deny reality and censor the truth.
[3:06:47.600 --> 3:06:49.600]  They did it with the Wuhan lab.
[3:06:49.600 --> 3:07:02.600]  This same organization is over Facebook with their fact checkers, one of whom Dr. Dajek by the way, literally was involved with the gain of function of research in the Wuhan lab.
[3:07:02.600 --> 3:07:10.600]  He was given the power to be a censorship moderator on Facebook through this network, censored the fact that it came from the lab.
[3:07:10.600 --> 3:07:12.600]  Now he's been totally exposed.
[3:07:12.600 --> 3:07:23.600]  A massive example of how these fact checking organizations are literally used to cover up massive real conspiracies that later turn out to be true.
[3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:35.600]  Point of President Neil Brown hates the fact that people can still see what's really happening in our streets despite their massive censorship regime and their blacklist writes Chris Menon of information liberation.com.
[3:07:35.600 --> 3:07:39.600]  And in fact, they have the article up on their website.
[3:07:39.600 --> 3:07:42.600]  Austin American Statesman shares fact check claiming it's false.
[3:07:42.600 --> 3:07:51.600]  They omitted suspect's description because he's black, even though they literally said it, they said, we don't want to perpetuate harmful stereotypes.
[3:07:51.600 --> 3:07:53.600]  Okay, so what's the stereotype?
[3:07:53.600 --> 3:08:00.600]  The stereotype is that these shootings predominantly are being committed by black males.
[3:08:00.600 --> 3:08:10.600]  That's why they didn't report the identity of the suspect, then they share the fact check saying, oh, there's no evidence they didn't share the identity of the suspect because he was black.
[3:08:10.600 --> 3:08:14.600]  They literally admitted to it in their article.
[3:08:14.600 --> 3:08:29.600]  It reminds me of the time when Buzzfeed fact checked one of my claims, which was that Muslims weren't celebrating the fire of Notre Dame because they claimed in the Facebook video, you couldn't see what they were reacting to with smiley face and moussicons on Facebook.
[3:08:29.600 --> 3:08:35.600]  And when in the video, at the top of the page, it was Notre Dame Cathedral burning.
[3:08:35.600 --> 3:08:42.600]  These fact checkers are liars, manipulators, absolute scum, and they're up to their old tricks once again.
[3:08:42.600 --> 3:09:08.600]  So anyway, some of it don't use the right language.

[3:09:49.600 --> 3:09:59.600]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[3:09:59.600 --> 3:10:02.600]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[3:10:02.600 --> 3:10:14.600]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[3:10:14.600 --> 3:10:17.600]  They don't want to go along with the globalist, but they're scared.
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:19.600]  They're looking for leadership.
[3:10:19.600 --> 3:10:21.600]  Well, that's where infooreshore comes in.

[3:10:59.600 --> 3:11:06.600]  Transmitting Worldwide from the summit.newstudios in the United Kingdom.
[3:11:06.600 --> 3:11:12.600]  You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:11:12.600 --> 3:11:27.600]  We have fact checking institute pointer, which is over Facebook and all these other social media networks, literally telling local news reporters across America to not report on violent crime because it doesn't fit their narrative because they don't want the perpetrators being identified.
[3:11:27.600 --> 3:11:30.600]  Despite the fact that they're killing black people.
[3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:44.600]  Apparently, the Austin American statesman's already gone along with this by sharing a fact check which said that claims they omitted a suspect's description because he's black was false despite literally admitting it in their own article.
[3:11:44.600 --> 3:11:45.600]  And why are they doing all this?
[3:11:45.600 --> 3:11:52.600]  Well, we had the Juneteenth National Independence Day over this past weekend.
[3:11:52.600 --> 3:12:01.600]  It was marred as information liberation reports with mob violence, mass shootings, public executions and attacks on police.
[3:12:01.600 --> 3:12:05.600]  You probably wouldn't know that because the media barely reported on it.
[3:12:05.600 --> 3:12:08.600]  Imagine it white supremacists who carried out this level of violence.
[3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:12.600]  It'd be a national news story for the next six months.
[3:12:12.600 --> 3:12:17.600]  Like the capital siege where a bunch of boomers rearranged some furniture for a couple of hours.
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:25.600]  America's first national independence day was marked by widespread violence and chaos breaking out at Juneteenth celebrations.
[3:12:25.600 --> 3:12:28.600]  So this wasn't even shootings that were happening anyway.
[3:12:28.600 --> 3:12:38.600]  It was specifically triggered by the celebrations that got out of hand in California, Illinois, South Carolina, New Jersey, Indiana and Colorado.
[3:12:38.600 --> 3:12:48.600]  The couple celebrating Puerto Rican Day in Chicago, Illinois with a large Puerto Rican flag on Saturday night, which now falls on the same day as the new Juneteenth federal holiday,
[3:12:48.600 --> 3:12:53.600]  was filmed being pulled out of their car and shot in the street by a mob of black men.
[3:12:53.600 --> 3:13:00.600]  Now we can't say they're black men because Pointer Institute and Austin American statesmen and the rest of them say,
[3:13:00.600 --> 3:13:05.600]  even though they're literally on video doing it and it's a gang of black men, you can't say that because it might be racist.
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:08.600]  So the poor Puerto Rican family died.
[3:13:08.600 --> 3:13:19.600]  It's very important to protect the identity of the literal murderers apparently according to the mainstream media and Pointer Institute fact checking network.
[3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:26.600]  So we have that we had the photographs of the victims shared on social media Pointer Institute doesn't want you to share those photos.
[3:13:26.600 --> 3:13:36.600]  Because these brown lives, these minority lives that were lost in this mob violence apparently don't matter to them, what matters more is to not be called racist.
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:42.600]  So the graphic racial execution apparently isn't newsworthy as it wasn't carried out by white extremists.
[3:13:42.600 --> 3:13:49.600]  Seven people were also shot in a mass shooting at a Juneteenth celebration in Oakland, California.
[3:13:49.600 --> 3:13:53.600]  Video shows the crowd fleeing for their lives as shots rang out.
[3:13:53.600 --> 3:14:00.600]  Now, police said they located six victims, five males aged 16 to 27, one female 22 suffering from gunshot wounds.
[3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:02.600]  So that was just two of them.
[3:14:02.600 --> 3:14:05.600]  There was another one in New Jersey Long Branch.
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:13.600]  It showed another violent mob celebrating Juneteenth national independence day by attacking a white woman who had apparently come in to join the revelry.
[3:14:13.600 --> 3:14:15.600]  So she was there to show her solidarity.
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:17.600]  No, she was attacked by a mob.
[3:14:17.600 --> 3:14:24.600]  I can't say what ethnicity that mob was because again, you might be called racist and that's more important than justice for the victims.
[3:14:24.600 --> 3:14:30.600]  Apparently, the Juneteenth party goers could be heard loudly cheering the mob beating.
[3:14:30.600 --> 3:14:32.600]  And then there's a bunch of others.
[3:14:32.600 --> 3:14:36.600]  Mass shootings, violent mob attacks over the weekend.
[3:14:36.600 --> 3:14:38.600]  There's two days alone in the United States.
[3:14:38.600 --> 3:14:40.600]  Barely a blip.
[3:14:40.600 --> 3:14:42.600]  It was forgotten about by Monday.
[3:14:42.600 --> 3:14:47.600]  Can you imagine if white supremacists had carried out similar violence?
[3:14:47.600 --> 3:14:52.600]  There would be national revulsion and moral hysteria across the board.
[3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:59.600]  And that's what Tucker Carlson spoke to on his show last night or a couple of nights ago now.
[3:14:59.600 --> 3:15:01.600]  Headline again out of information liberation.
[3:15:01.600 --> 3:15:05.600]  Tucker, white supremacists are not carrying out the violence in our streets.
[3:15:05.600 --> 3:15:12.600]  Tucker Carlson called out the Biden regime's lie that white supremacy is our nation's most lethal threat.
[3:15:12.600 --> 3:15:17.600]  Just as it was a threat as we saw with the old stop Asian hate narrative,
[3:15:17.600 --> 3:15:26.600]  when they tried to suggest that white supremacy was responsible for hate crime attacks and violent crime attacks on Asians in major American cities.
[3:15:26.600 --> 3:15:31.600]  Then all the videos started coming out and it was the usual suspects.
[3:15:31.600 --> 3:15:36.600]  And suddenly that hashtag and that whole campaign just kind of disappeared.
[3:15:36.600 --> 3:15:38.600]  Gee, I wonder why.
[3:15:38.600 --> 3:15:45.600]  So Tucker talked about it during his monologue on Monday night and highlighted the widespread violence that took place over the weekend during
[3:15:45.600 --> 3:15:47.600]  Juneteenth celebrations all over the country.
[3:15:47.600 --> 3:15:54.600]  He said, quote, just in 2020, last year, more than 750 people were murdered in the city of Chicago.
[3:15:54.600 --> 3:16:03.600]  And we can say with some confidence that the overwhelming majority of those suspects in the city of Chicago were not members of QA, non-white supremacists.
[3:16:03.600 --> 3:16:13.600]  Now, I think a single one of them has been identified as one of those boomers who rearranged furniture at the Capitol building back on January 6.
[3:16:13.600 --> 3:16:17.600]  He said, how do we know informed guests, but sometimes this video.
[3:16:17.600 --> 3:16:26.600]  He said before playing clips of a public execution that took place in Chicago and a mob twerking on an EMS ambulance responding to a mass shooting in Oakland.
[3:16:26.600 --> 3:16:29.600]  You've probably seen that clip by now.
[3:16:29.600 --> 3:16:38.600]  While Tucker noted that some 25% of violent crime is linked to gangs, he failed to explain the nature of the majority of violent crime, which is not committed by gangs.
[3:16:38.600 --> 3:16:43.600]  The police have come out and said in numerous cases, Philly, Milwaukee, Chicago and so on.
[3:16:43.600 --> 3:16:50.600]  That this violent crime is being committed over minus likes and beef on social media.
[3:16:50.600 --> 3:16:56.600]  So you've had basically an orgy of violence over the weekend with this Juneteenth celebration.
[3:16:56.600 --> 3:16:59.600]  Not much of it committed by white supremacists.
[3:16:59.600 --> 3:17:01.600]  In fact, literally none of it.
[3:17:01.600 --> 3:17:04.600]  But we need to censor local crime stories.
[3:17:04.600 --> 3:17:11.600]  We need to censor the identity of suspects if they're black, according to Pointer and Austin American Statement.
[3:17:11.600 --> 3:17:18.600]  Because being called racist is worse than helping minority victims of violent crime, apparently.
[3:17:18.600 --> 3:17:25.600]  Meanwhile, RT reports Karen horror movie about evil white woman accused of exploiting black trauma for profit.
[3:17:25.600 --> 3:17:32.600]  So there's no there's no actual orgy of white supremacist violence against black people happening in real life.
[3:17:32.600 --> 3:17:37.600]  So now they have to make movies where it happens and convince people that way.
[3:17:37.600 --> 3:17:43.600]  Of course, you saw the what was it the Jordan Peele movie at the year or two ago.
[3:17:43.600 --> 3:17:45.600]  It was called get out. Yeah.
[3:17:45.600 --> 3:17:50.600]  2017 a few years ago now about a killer white family targeting black people.
[3:17:50.600 --> 3:17:51.600]  Well, now they've got another one.
[3:17:51.600 --> 3:17:58.600]  Again, this is in the context of LeBron James saying last year that every time black people leave their house,
[3:17:58.600 --> 3:18:01.600]  they're literally hunted down on the street.
[3:18:01.600 --> 3:18:04.600]  Yeah, again, quite the opposite.
[3:18:04.600 --> 3:18:12.600]  You look at the FBI crime stats, but they've got a new movie based on the Karen slur against white women.
[3:18:12.600 --> 3:18:13.600]  And they've dropped a trailer.
[3:18:13.600 --> 3:18:18.600]  It's directed by Coke Daniels stars a bunch of people I've never heard of.
[3:18:18.600 --> 3:18:23.600]  I don't think it's a massive movie, but it's generating heat on social media.
[3:18:23.600 --> 3:18:31.600]  So they've got this Karen who terrorized as an American African American family that moved into a white neighborhood.
[3:18:31.600 --> 3:18:38.600]  The trailer, which was released last week game fraction on Tuesday shows Karen installing extra security in her home after the black family who's in across the street,
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:42.600]  as well as complaining to them about leaving their trash can on the curb.
[3:18:42.600 --> 3:18:47.600]  During another scene in the trailer, Karen more clearly remarks that the black woman is slaving away in the kitchen.
[3:18:47.600 --> 3:18:53.600]  And in another scene, she appears to call nine or more on a group of black teenagers who are then harassed by police.
[3:18:53.600 --> 3:19:02.600]  So again, they've put out this whole narrative that there's this moral panic over violent white supremacy targeting black people in America.
[3:19:02.600 --> 3:19:08.600]  The actual main violent threats black people as it has ever been is other black people, but you can't talk about that because it's racist.
[3:19:08.600 --> 3:19:16.600]  And they've literally got fact checking institutions, censoring media outlets or urging them to censor themselves to not report the truth.
[3:19:16.600 --> 3:19:27.600]  So they literally have to create movies and TV series where you have white racist Karen's being bigoted, being discriminatory towards black people,
[3:19:27.600 --> 3:19:34.600]  and then turning to violence and hunting them down on the streets because it doesn't exist on any scale in reality.
[3:19:34.600 --> 3:19:39.600]  So they have to pretend it does via the medium of TV and movies.
[3:19:39.600 --> 3:19:41.600]  Summit.News will be back.
[3:19:41.600 --> 3:19:42.600]  I'm going.
[3:19:42.600 --> 3:19:54.600]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly
[3:19:54.600 --> 3:19:57.600]  for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[3:19:57.600 --> 3:19:59.600]  And then we're all this together.
[3:19:59.600 --> 3:20:04.600]  And you know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air.
[3:20:04.600 --> 3:20:05.600]  But it's true.
[3:20:05.600 --> 3:20:12.600]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:20:12.600 --> 3:20:14.600]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:20:14.600 --> 3:20:16.600]  They crippled all the other groups.
[3:20:16.600 --> 3:20:17.600]  And we're still here.
[3:20:17.600 --> 3:20:21.600]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[3:20:21.600 --> 3:20:23.600]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:20:23.600 --> 3:20:25.600]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:20:25.600 --> 3:20:27.600]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[3:20:27.600 --> 3:20:29.600]  And America is still quasi free.
[3:20:29.600 --> 3:20:34.600]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:20:34.600 --> 3:20:36.600]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:20:36.600 --> 3:20:37.600]  So thank you all.

[3:20:44.600 --> 3:20:45.600]  Thank you.
[3:20:47.600 --> 3:20:49.600]  What are champions made of?
[3:20:51.600 --> 3:20:52.600]  Here's a man who can show you.
[3:20:52.600 --> 3:20:57.600]  Can I show you?
[3:21:22.600 --> 3:21:46.600]  That's infowarstore.com.
[3:21:46.600 --> 3:21:53.600]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[3:21:53.600 --> 3:21:59.600]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[3:21:59.600 --> 3:22:04.600]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[3:22:04.600 --> 3:22:07.600]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[3:22:07.600 --> 3:22:10.600]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine.
[3:22:10.600 --> 3:22:13.600]  And the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[3:22:13.600 --> 3:22:17.600]  It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape.
[3:22:17.600 --> 3:22:23.600]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[3:22:23.600 --> 3:22:27.600]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[3:22:27.600 --> 3:22:36.600]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[3:22:36.600 --> 3:22:43.600]  Go to infowarstore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the mega immune support pack.

[3:24:11.600 --> 3:24:21.600]  So the fallout from last year's Black Lives Matter riots continues to be felt now in the production of movies which portray racist white women
[3:24:21.600 --> 3:24:27.600]  killing black people apparently despite the fact that there's literally zero examples of that happening in real life,
[3:24:27.600 --> 3:24:30.600]  which is why they have to make movies about it.
[3:24:30.600 --> 3:24:38.600]  Now we have another situation in the United Kingdom where of course we've had this whole take a knee imported from America.
[3:24:38.600 --> 3:24:43.600]  There's a big controversy about that with the England football team continuing to take the knee.
[3:24:43.600 --> 3:24:47.600]  Despite the fact that many fans have started booing it much to their credit.
[3:24:47.600 --> 3:24:52.600]  England are playing right now and they took a knee before the match against the Czech Republic,
[3:24:52.600 --> 3:24:57.600]  which started about half an hour ago and it literally lasted for about two seconds.
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:24:59.600]  And they all immediately got up.
[3:24:59.600 --> 3:25:01.600]  It seems to have lost its steam.
[3:25:01.600 --> 3:25:03.600]  Thank God.
[3:25:03.600 --> 3:25:12.600]  What hasn't lost its steam is the zeal on behalf of corporations to exploit this woke bandwagon to claim they pretend about any real world issues
[3:25:12.600 --> 3:25:19.600]  while actually cynically exploiting division racial tension to sell more products.
[3:25:19.600 --> 3:25:23.600]  We have another example of that with Marks and Spencer here in the UK,
[3:25:23.600 --> 3:25:30.600]  which has announced today that it's going to be selling lingerie inspired by George Floyd.
[3:25:30.600 --> 3:25:34.600]  Yes, really, we have the clip. Let's roll it.
[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:43.600]  UK department store M&S has launched a new line of inclusive underwear inspired by George Floyd
[3:25:43.600 --> 3:25:49.600]  because there's nothing that says female empowerment more than celebrating a criminal who robbed a pregnant woman at gunpoint.
[3:25:49.600 --> 3:25:50.600]  Oh, come on, man.
[3:25:50.600 --> 3:25:58.600]  There's nothing that speaks to racial justice better than idolizing someone who pistol whipped a Hispanic woman in front of her kids during a home invasion.
[3:25:58.600 --> 3:26:02.600]  Coming next to M&S a range of children's clothing inspired by Myra Hindley and Ian Brady,
[3:26:02.600 --> 3:26:06.600]  Jeffrey Dahmer range of ready meals, George Floyd's Guide to sobriety.
[3:26:06.600 --> 3:26:07.600]  Love it.
[3:26:07.600 --> 3:26:08.600]  Love what? Men who attack women.
[3:26:08.600 --> 3:26:16.600]  The chain has expanded its collection of neutral or nude colored underwear so it comes in five shades designed for different skin tones instead of focusing on lighter hues
[3:26:16.600 --> 3:26:22.600]  because apparently before June 2021, white was the only color of underwear that existed.
[3:26:22.600 --> 3:26:32.600]  M&S, the UK's largest bra and knickers retailer, said the range was partly inspired by the global conversation on racial inequality following the horrific death of Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis, U.S. last year.
[3:26:32.600 --> 3:26:40.600]  So just to be clear, this totally isn't another cynical marketing ploy to attract free media advertising by pandering to woke imbeciles.
[3:26:40.600 --> 3:26:42.600]  It's totally not that.
[3:26:42.600 --> 3:26:43.600]  Right.
[3:26:43.600 --> 3:26:49.600]  The new collection is part of what M&S hails as a bold and relevant campaign called nothing neutral about it.
[3:26:49.600 --> 3:26:56.600]  Because really not enough of fashion, sports, culture, entertainment, and even inanimate objects have been politicized, have they?
[3:26:56.600 --> 3:26:57.600]  No.
[3:26:57.600 --> 3:26:58.600]  Let's politicize knickers.
[3:26:58.600 --> 3:26:59.600]  That'll stop races.
[3:26:59.600 --> 3:27:06.600]  And meanwhile, there's no truth to the rumor that Walmart's in Chicago are going to start giving away free handguns to celebrate Juneteenth.
[3:27:11.600 --> 3:27:12.600]  Well, there you have it.
[3:27:12.600 --> 3:27:19.600]  You can now get your George Floyd lingerie from Marks and Spencer.
[3:27:19.600 --> 3:27:22.600]  And again, this ties back in with something I was talking about before.
[3:27:22.600 --> 3:27:26.600]  We're talking about woke virtue signaling these global corporations.
[3:27:26.600 --> 3:27:39.600]  Again, jumping on the bandwagon of this racial tension that's being created by Antifa by the BLM movement, again, making out that there's nothing worse in the world than being called racist.
[3:27:39.600 --> 3:27:42.600]  And we saw that with the fact checking organizations.
[3:27:42.600 --> 3:27:49.600]  We saw it with the Austin American statesman now resolving to not report the identity of violent criminal suspects.
[3:27:49.600 --> 3:27:56.600]  If they're non-white, I'm sure if they're white, they'll be all over the identity reporting within literal nanoseconds.
[3:27:56.600 --> 3:28:05.600]  But this idea that there's a greater concern to not be called racist than to actually prosecute laws in many cases.
[3:28:05.600 --> 3:28:10.600]  And we saw that with the Manchester bombing where political correctness actually kills.
[3:28:10.600 --> 3:28:23.600]  It actually leads to people being blown up by terrorists because those attacks could have been stopped, specifically in the case of the Manchester arena bombing, which, by the way, was carried out by a guy,
[3:28:23.600 --> 3:28:38.600]  Salah Abdeslam, who was literally rescued by the British government at Salman Abadi, I correct myself. Abdeslam was the Paris massacre terrorist, but Salman Abadi, Manchester arena bomber,
[3:28:38.600 --> 3:28:55.600]  rescued by the UK government by the British Royal Navy back in, I think it was 2013, off the back of the invasion of Libya, which of course saw the overthrow of Gaddafi, the secular leader and the empowerment of literal jihadists and ISIS.
[3:28:55.600 --> 3:29:01.600]  Of course, we have the whole refugees welcome campaign. We have people campaigning for these people to be let into the country.
[3:29:01.600 --> 3:29:10.600]  They let into the country on a daily basis, still in the United Kingdom with no papers, no documents whatsoever. They disappear into the general population.
[3:29:10.600 --> 3:29:21.600]  They go on in numerous instances to carry out mass casualty terror attacks. We saw that with the Paris massacre and we saw it with the Manchester arena bombing.
[3:29:21.600 --> 3:29:35.600]  And they let them in based off of these leftist campaigns that we have to absorb the world's persecuted populations in numerous cases. They've literally gone on to blow up westerners in European cities.
[3:29:35.600 --> 3:29:49.600]  And before the actual attack itself, we had concerns of racism being fell as to why security guards and police did not stop the Manchester arena suicide bomber from carrying out his attack.
[3:29:49.600 --> 3:30:00.600]  The suspicious behavior was noted right before the attack on numerous occasions by security guards and police, but they did nothing because they didn't want to be called racist.
[3:30:00.600 --> 3:30:12.600]  This sounds like a Babylon B article. It happened. Manchester arena bombing inquiry finds fears of security guards being called racist prevented jihadists from being stopped.
[3:30:12.600 --> 3:30:23.600]  This is the official inquiry into the Manchester arena bombing, which found that one of the reasons for authorities failing to stop jihadist Salman Abadi from blowing himself up was the fear that they would be called racist.
[3:30:23.600 --> 3:30:30.600]  Political correctness kills literally solid example of it right here.
[3:30:30.600 --> 3:30:42.600]  So John Sanders who is chairing the probe into the 2017 terrorist attack said more should have been done by police and security before Abadi detonated his device outside an Ariana Grande concert killing 22 innocent people and injuring hundreds more.
[3:30:42.600 --> 3:30:44.600]  Most of them kids, by the way.
[3:30:44.600 --> 3:31:00.600]  Despite security guard Kyle Lawl saying he had a bad feeling about the terrorist and felt he did not belong there. He was basically had a huge rock sack was sweating profusely was fidgeting was acting nervous.
[3:31:00.600 --> 3:31:04.600]  He was on his own set amongst a bunch of white people.
[3:31:04.600 --> 3:31:19.600]  He knew that was suspicious. He knew he said, quote, I did not belong there, but he took no action to report the issue or intercept the terrorist because he was, quote, scared of being wrong and being branded a racist.
[3:31:19.600 --> 3:31:38.600]  So here's fear that he may be called a racist. Maybe he'll be canceled by a social media mob. Maybe he'll lose his job. That was paramount in his head when he literally had a chance to stop this jihadist terrorist scumbag blowing himself up and killing 22 people.
[3:31:38.600 --> 3:31:40.600]  Most of them children.
[3:31:40.600 --> 3:31:47.600]  Oh, political correctness is just being nice to people. No, it frigging isn't. It literally kills people.
[3:31:47.600 --> 3:31:59.600]  This is not the only example. The Paris massacre terrorists were let into Europe on the refugee wave. They pretended to be refugees refugees welcome.
[3:31:59.600 --> 3:32:16.600]  The clone mass rape of women on New Year's Eve 2015. Again, how did the feminist react to over 1000 women being sexually molested and raped in Cologne. The next day they went to the migrants and gave them flowers.
[3:32:16.600 --> 3:32:26.600]  Previously highlighted another eyewitness to Abadi suspicious behavior report the activity to security guard Mohammed Agha 17 minutes before the bomb was detonated but said he was popped off. Oh, imagine my shot.
[3:32:26.600 --> 3:32:34.600]  Mohammed did nothing. Wonder why both Lawler and Agha failed to properly inform security control.
[3:32:34.600 --> 3:32:52.600]  Another woman interviewed by Sky News in the days after the attack also revealed that she reported a woman who was acting suspiciously and fidgeting with a bag to security. But again, they did nothing because the woman was brown. And again, it's worse to be called racist than to prevent 22 kids from being blown up.
[3:32:52.600 --> 3:32:58.600]  She said she was looking in the direction of where the explosion actually happened and smirking to herself all night.
[3:32:58.600 --> 3:33:04.600]  Said the woman adding that the suspect spoke with a foreign accent. Oh my God, really.
[3:33:04.600 --> 3:33:18.600]  The eyewitness said she was lectured by security lectured by security for reporting the suspicious behavior. Remember a time. This is a time when we had the London Bridge attack. We had the Westminster attack. All these Islamist plots against major UK cities.
[3:33:18.600 --> 3:33:34.600]  These people are desperately trying to report this terrorist and potential accomplices to the police, to the security completely ignored because of political correctness, which kills 22 people dead, hundreds of people's lives traumatized forever.
[3:33:34.600 --> 3:33:38.600]  But yeah, hashtag refugees welcome. Don't go away.
[3:33:38.600 --> 3:33:48.600]  Submit.News will be right back.

[3:37:59.600 --> 3:38:10.600]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:38:10.600 --> 3:38:22.600]  So before the break, I was talking about our fears over being politically correct and not to be seen as racist, literally facilitate the mass murder of children at Manchester Arena in 2017.
[3:38:22.600 --> 3:38:35.600]  Fears over racism also facilitate what is potentially turning out to be one of the biggest cover-ups in modern history, which is the fact that COVID-19 was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[3:38:35.600 --> 3:38:37.600]  We had this headline a few days ago.
[3:38:37.600 --> 3:38:53.600]  Report, scientists admit lab leak theory was dismissed due to fear of racism accusations, so literally finding out where this virus leaked from, which has killed God knows how many million people now in the world according to them.
[3:38:53.600 --> 3:39:01.600]  That was curtailed, that was stymied, again, because they thought they'd be called racist against Chinese people.
[3:39:01.600 --> 3:39:17.600]  Can you believe it? Leading scientists that this is the same thing with the WHO, they told countries back in March not to close their borders because it would cause stigmatization of Chinese people.
[3:39:17.600 --> 3:39:33.600]  Now that was a real measure. If you believe in the actual, you know, real semblance of this virus that it's killed a bunch of people, then closing the borders is a measure that everyone can agree on, whether you're anti-vax, pro-vax or whatever.
[3:39:33.600 --> 3:39:40.600]  Most people can agree that if you've got a pandemic circulating the world, the first thing you do is close the frigging borders.
[3:39:40.600 --> 3:39:46.600]  What was the first thing the WHO said to countries, don't close the borders because that's racist.
[3:39:46.600 --> 3:39:58.600]  And they never had to answer for that. Now, leading scientists in the US have admitted that they originally dismissed the theory that the coronavirus could have leaked from a lab in Wuhan because they didn't want to be associated with President Trump and his supporters,
[3:39:58.600 --> 3:40:09.600]  or accused of being racist against Chinese people, just like the Italians in Florence and other major cities who were told by authorities in that city to go out into the street.
[3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:18.600]  And this was in late February 2020 and find Chinese people and hug them just so they could communicate to Chinese people that they weren't racist.
[3:40:18.600 --> 3:40:28.600]  They lit the authorities in Italy, literally told the population to find Chinese people and hug them and kiss them and breathe on their face.
[3:40:28.600 --> 3:40:31.600]  They never had to answer for that.
[3:40:31.600 --> 3:40:40.600]  Oh, no, but it's Trump's fault that he calls it the China virus. Yeah, you were literally telling people to hug Chinese people. Nancy Pelosi, Governor Cuomo,
[3:40:40.600 --> 3:40:50.600]  literally telling people to congregate in huge numbers, the China Lunar New Year celebration in major cities in America.
[3:40:50.600 --> 3:40:59.600]  Absolutely incredible. NBC News notes in a report that at least five virologists noted that the context and circumstances of the origin debate have changed.
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:11.600]  The shift reflects how sometimes scientists who previously avoided the topic or were quick to dismiss it or grappling with enduring absurdities about the virus's origin free from the politicization that clouded such discussions during the Trump administration.
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:21.600]  So just because Trump said it may have come from the lab, they deliberately avoided that and we know it was all covered up, which I probably won't have time to get into, by the way.
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:40.600]  Today, it turns out that Google was literally funding the main scientist who was funding the Chinese Wuhan lab for virus research for the past decade, while simultaneously censoring information about the lab leak theory for the past year.
[3:41:40.600 --> 3:41:50.600]  But again, they thought they'd be called racist, they thought they'd be called Trump supporters, so they zipped up and remained completely silent.
[3:41:50.600 --> 3:41:59.600]  Let's go to this second video now, though, because we've had a lot of stories about the UK education system in recent days, which I'm going to get onto in a minute.
[3:41:59.600 --> 3:42:12.600]  This is the Goldsmiths University Fasts headline, was London Uni allows non-whites exam extensions if they say they've experienced racial trauma. Here's the clip.
[3:42:12.600 --> 3:42:20.600]  The Goldsmiths University in London is allowing people of colour to extend assignment deadlines if they claim to have experienced racial trauma.
[3:42:20.600 --> 3:42:33.600]  Yeah, really. Sky News reports the university has changed its deferral policy after a proposal from the Students' Union updating the extenuating circumstances they can cite when applying for extensions for exams or essays.
[3:42:33.600 --> 3:42:42.600]  The new policy will incorporate racial trauma, which means black students and those from ethnically diverse communities can apply for an extension or deferral on an assignment on that basis.
[3:42:42.600 --> 3:42:46.600]  Goldsmiths Student Union President Sarah Baff outweated this.
[3:42:46.600 --> 3:43:00.600]  The university has agreed to our proposal to incorporate racial trauma as a reason to defer essays and exams for black and POC students. It will be done through self-certification, moving away from providing so-called evidence.
[3:43:00.600 --> 3:43:08.600]  In other words, they don't have to give any proof whatsoever and can just exploit the policy to gain an advantage over non-POC students.
[3:43:08.600 --> 3:43:22.600]  This is even more egregious given that there are more students from co-ethnically diverse backgrounds than there are white students studying Goldsmiths, meaning that the white students represent a minority who are being discriminated against.
[3:43:22.600 --> 3:43:35.600]  The nebulous category of racial trauma has been added to the list of extenuating circumstances, which includes things that are actually genuine, like medical conditions, trauma bereavement, co-attendance and caring responsibilities.
[3:43:35.600 --> 3:43:38.600]  There are four main takeaways from this utter farce.
[3:43:38.600 --> 3:43:46.600]  One, it's obviously just going to be exploited by lazy people who will claim fake victimhood status because they haven't completed their work on time.
[3:43:46.600 --> 3:43:51.600]  Two, the policy is clearly discriminatory against white people and is therefore racist.
[3:43:51.600 --> 3:44:00.600]  Three, on that basis, this is yet another example of how the only allowed form of systemic discrimination that still exists is against whites.
[3:44:00.600 --> 3:44:07.600]  And four, by treating non-white students differently, the university is engaging in the bigotry of low expectations.
[3:44:07.600 --> 3:44:15.600]  And the policy will actually harm those non-white people when they enter the jobs market or further education because it will lower their standards.
[3:44:15.600 --> 3:44:22.600]  Of course, none of the media coverage of this story even mentions those four crucial points.
[3:44:22.600 --> 3:44:33.600]  Now, there's been a spate of news stories about the UK education system CRT over the past few days, one of which is headlined.
[3:44:33.600 --> 3:44:38.600]  Schools warn that promoting concept of white privilege is harming disadvantage of white students.
[3:44:38.600 --> 3:44:50.600]  They're absolutely furious, furious that anyone could think of poor working class white students who are the most disadvantage compared to any other race in the United Kingdom.
[3:44:50.600 --> 3:44:57.600]  The mere fact that they're being considered has caused a massive uproar in this country over the past few days.
[3:44:57.600 --> 3:45:06.600]  Schools in the UK have been told by a cross-party committee of MPs that promoting the notion of white privilege, which completely doesn't exist for them in any way whatsoever,
[3:45:06.600 --> 3:45:10.600]  reach equality laws while also harming disadvantaged white students.
[3:45:10.600 --> 3:45:22.600]  The committee report found that despite the relentless narrative that white privilege is holding back non-white students, white students are actually underperforming compared to everybody else.
[3:45:22.600 --> 3:45:27.600]  Teachers investigated after using n-words to help students properly pronounce the name of African country.
[3:45:27.600 --> 3:45:30.600]  He's looking like he's going to be handed out of a job.
[3:45:30.600 --> 3:45:37.600]  Meanwhile, the Telegraph reports, stop using terms boy and girls, Stonewall tells teachers.
[3:45:37.600 --> 3:45:46.600]  Stonewall is the taxpayer-funded LGBT lobby that literally campaigns to lower the age of consent, do you know what that is?
[3:45:46.600 --> 3:45:54.600]  They're now saying teachers should drop the terms boys and girls in favour of learners and mix up the sexes in PE classes.
[3:45:54.600 --> 3:46:02.600]  Again, this is about controlling the language. You control the language, you control the boundaries of discussion, people's behaviour.
[3:46:02.600 --> 3:46:10.600]  It's gone way beyond gay marriage, equal rights, all of which homosexuals LGBT have got over the past 10 years.
[3:46:10.600 --> 3:46:21.600]  Now it's literally about telling teachers they can't say boy and girl because they want to get kids into this mindset of developing mental illnesses where they think they want to change gender,
[3:46:21.600 --> 3:46:33.600]  which leads to dreadfully unhealthy lifestyles, which leads to massively high suicide attempt rates for transgenders and the like at increasingly younger ages.
[3:46:33.600 --> 3:46:45.600]  Not a good lifestyle to be drawn towards and of course kids shouldn't be hit with any kind of sexualisation at any point, even with their parents' permission until much later years.
[3:46:45.600 --> 3:46:51.600]  Meanwhile, UEFA refuses to light up football stadium in LGBT colours to chide Hungary.
[3:46:51.600 --> 3:47:00.600]  So basically Hungary passed a law last week which bans showing children under the age of 18 material related to homosexuality or transgenderism.
[3:47:00.600 --> 3:47:07.600]  How dare they? How dare they not expose kids to trannies below the age of 18?
[3:47:07.600 --> 3:47:16.600]  Not just in education but on television, movies or in advertisements, they don't want to expose people to a lifestyle which literally leads to half of them trying to kill themselves.
[3:47:16.600 --> 3:47:19.600]  Oh my God, what a horrible thing, right?
[3:47:19.600 --> 3:47:28.600]  But now UEFA has refused a request by the City of Munich to light up the Allianz Arena in LGBT rainbow colours.
[3:47:28.600 --> 3:47:35.600]  After authorities insisted it would be a way to oppose Hungary's new law which forbids promotion of homosexuality and transgenderism to children.
[3:47:35.600 --> 3:47:51.600]  So basically UEFA came out and said that they don't allow political or neutral symbols to be displayed, although they allow take a knee and don't say anything about it because again being called racist is worse than anything else on the planet right now.
[3:47:51.600 --> 3:47:58.600]  But they've refused this request by German authorities to light up the stadium in LGBT colours.
[3:47:58.600 --> 3:48:05.600]  So the mayor of Munich has basically responded and said he's going to light up the rest of the entire city.
[3:48:05.600 --> 3:48:17.600]  What was good about Budapest and aced Hungary is the fact that a rainbow coloured statue erected in Budapest by leftist activists in honour of Black Lives Matter was demolished within 24 hours.
[3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:20.600]  What a crying shame.
[3:48:20.600 --> 3:48:30.600]  That's going to wrap it up. War Room is coming up next with Owen Shroyer. Be sure to stay tuned and check out the latest news at summon.news. We'll be back.
