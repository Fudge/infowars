[01:02.400 --> 01:10.840]  country and about his ideas and if he supports or not a constitutional convention to try to reboot
[01:10.840 --> 01:14.280]  the republic you know I've been critical of that I don't know fine's been critical of that in the
[01:14.280 --> 01:19.600]  past but I'm gonna get a stake on that now gee Edward Griffin will be joining us of course
[01:19.600 --> 01:25.600]  author of preacher from Jekyll Island to talk about a hundred years under the Federal Reserve

[01:48.680 --> 01:55.440]  the phones up today as well this is not just the hundredth anniversary of the Federal Reserve but it
[01:55.440 --> 02:02.080]  is the date which you must sign up or be fined between what is it three to five thousand dollars
[02:02.080 --> 02:08.040]  individually even more for a family if you do not sign up for the Affordable Care Act that like the
[02:08.040 --> 02:14.600]  Patriot Act and the New Freedom Initiative and so many other government programs is the opposite of
[02:14.600 --> 02:22.080]  what its name would imply in a Orwellian fashion so I'd like to hear from you out there are you
[02:22.080 --> 02:29.160]  ready to start getting your fines and of course even if they postpone the mandate for a year again
[02:29.160 --> 02:35.800]  to just kind of let this train wreck set there and claim it's all the crisis not of their doing they
[02:35.800 --> 02:40.680]  will use the crisis to gain even more power and it allows the insurance companies to now get rid
[02:40.680 --> 02:47.480]  of markets and basically charge you whatever they want and that's why the insurance companies wrote
[02:47.480 --> 02:55.560]  this and so we're going to be discussing that today as well I want to get everyone's take on the
[02:55.560 --> 03:00.360]  government being your doctor along with some HMOs and foreign banks that own these insurance
[03:00.360 --> 03:06.360]  companies foreign and offshore banks it is the worst type situation you that I personally could
[03:06.360 --> 03:13.680]  imagine the president here's the headline on info wars.com on day president signs up for
[03:13.680 --> 03:23.560]  Obamacare record numbers reject healthcare law. Crass PR stunts simply not working on Americans
[03:23.560 --> 03:30.640]  yes some numbers show 90% against the healthcare law but if they if they spin the questions you
[03:30.640 --> 03:37.560]  know you can get only 65 70 80% that that that are against it but even people like Robert Gibbs
[03:37.560 --> 03:43.720]  are on the news saying you know repeal it get rid of it postpone it fire whoever did it fire
[03:43.720 --> 03:49.120]  whoever built the website they're all making it about the website because this is the greatest
[03:49.120 --> 03:54.720]  transfer of wealth to private interest through government the world's ever seen the Supreme
[03:54.720 --> 04:00.480]  Court ruled it is a tax as we told you but it's not even the tax of the government sure they
[04:00.480 --> 04:06.200]  increase some payroll taxes and some fines and some fees and some property taxes federally so
[04:06.200 --> 04:15.040]  there is some federal transfer but the big inch a lot up in the midst of all this is the fact
[04:15.040 --> 04:21.720]  that it makes you go out and buy it from these big insurance companies gee if you've got to buy
[04:21.720 --> 04:28.840]  something and they can sell it for whatever price they want what's going to happen it's going to
[04:28.840 --> 04:33.960]  make the price go up and they got their nose under the tent flat the last five decades with car
[04:33.960 --> 04:38.680]  insurance and house insurance and renters insurance and then they just jack it up and up and up and
[04:38.680 --> 04:42.600]  up and up and up and up and up and up and up and come in and regulate shut down the competition
[04:42.600 --> 04:49.400]  we've got big NSA news big First Amendment Duck Dynasty news and so much more and I'll give the

[08:49.560 --> 08:54.920]  they passed the income tax and then falsely ratified it through the states that has been
[08:54.920 --> 08:59.960]  confirmed that most of the states indeed did not ratify it and as a giant hoax it was passed through
[09:00.520 --> 09:05.240]  and 100 percent of the money of your income tax goes to pay debt to the federal reserve
[09:05.240 --> 09:10.840]  for the privilege of the nation having its own currency lincoln issued our own currency even
[09:10.840 --> 09:16.120]  before the federal reserve interest free and was assassinated over that kennedy moved in that
[09:16.120 --> 09:21.400]  direction and was assassinated amongst other reasons for that with his executive order to begin
[09:21.400 --> 09:28.360]  abolishing the federal reserve and to issue 40 plus billion just to begin with in lincoln greenbacks
[09:28.360 --> 09:33.640]  that had been out of circulation but that he could reissue without even passing a new law
[09:35.960 --> 09:42.120]  and so here we are the 100th anniversary g edward griffin uh one of the foremost experts on the
[09:42.120 --> 09:47.800]  private run for profit federal reserve will be joining us in the third hour and we also have
[09:47.800 --> 09:54.040]  bruce fine constitutional lawyer top advisor to ron paul and also the many members of congress
[09:54.040 --> 09:59.160]  joining us to talk about uh we contacted him wanted to talk about a constitutional convention
[09:59.160 --> 10:04.680]  that some people have been saying is the answer i have serious reservations but we'll get his um
[10:04.680 --> 10:10.280]  learned view and opinion on that but then he wanted strangely enough and i'm saying that
[10:10.280 --> 10:15.800]  forecastically to talk about how we have a unified single tyrannical government now
[10:16.440 --> 10:20.120]  one party system and how we have a dictatorship of the bureaucracy
[10:21.320 --> 10:26.600]  concurring with my analysis uh but there's really no analysis there this is just plain
[10:26.600 --> 10:32.520]  as the nose on our face so we're going to be discussing that with uh mr fine as well uh
[10:32.520 --> 10:37.480]  here today i want to wish everyone a wonderful christmas i want to wish everyone out there
[10:37.480 --> 10:42.280]  uh a better year in 2014 now this is going to be the maker to break it year coming up
[10:43.240 --> 10:47.720]  and we've seen a lot of trials and tribulations and craziness not just here in the united states
[10:47.720 --> 10:54.120]  but worldwide the last year a huge awakening because of an avalanche of oppression an avalanche
[10:54.120 --> 11:02.280]  of bureaucracy a avalanche of classical autocratic oppression and the real battle is about to begin
[11:02.280 --> 11:09.560]  in 2014 out into 2015 but 2014 not just here but in europe not just in europe but in asia
[11:09.560 --> 11:16.040]  the middle east africa latin america there are revolutions and resistance movements against
[11:16.040 --> 11:22.920]  collectivism happening everywhere and the globalists are trying to cinch up the planet right now
[11:22.920 --> 11:32.920]  they are trying to consolidate their their their power grab because if they don't consolidate
[11:32.920 --> 11:40.760]  their power grab they could lose it all they've gone so far they're not going to turn back now
[11:42.120 --> 11:49.560]  but the issue is we can't turn back either now there's a lot of examples they're reinstating
[11:49.560 --> 11:55.880]  that the the head of duck dynasty phil robertson and it's now come out the families lashed out
[11:55.880 --> 12:00.680]  they weren't part of staging this uh the daily mail got a big exclusive in-depth interview
[12:00.680 --> 12:07.720]  there's several others now where they were told do this is part of your promotion and then he
[12:07.720 --> 12:13.160]  said it off the record off the cuff and then the family even learned about it and said hey
[12:13.160 --> 12:17.320]  stop telling us let's talk about christ and pray and stuff if you're going to let stuff like this
[12:17.320 --> 12:26.200]  get published and they want to head into a and e signed off on that getting published through gq
[12:28.920 --> 12:33.880]  and i've been interviewed by a lot of big magazines like esquire time magazine rolling stone
[12:34.840 --> 12:39.720]  gq was going to interview me till uh they found out esquire was already doing a profile this year
[12:39.720 --> 12:45.960]  but the point was is that because of liability those articles are so big they basically make
[12:45.960 --> 12:51.800]  you sign off on did you say this did you mean this and the family hasn't released everything but it's
[12:51.800 --> 13:01.320]  coming out that this was an artificial controversy and the family has said this to shut down their
[13:01.320 --> 13:08.120]  religious views and to bully them in a public backlash into basically signing agreements
[13:08.120 --> 13:14.840]  that they won't talk about god and they won't pray and see that's how psych warfare works they get to
[13:14.840 --> 13:20.040]  dominate the news get obama care out of the news get all the other been gauzy gate and pass
[13:20.040 --> 13:25.960]  inferious out of the news and get to dominate during the holiday season during christmas
[13:26.520 --> 13:34.520]  with all this other news all this other garbage and make it about a civil rights movement for
[13:34.520 --> 13:45.640]  quote gay people and have uh cracker barrel pull their apparel their camouflage hats off of the
[13:45.640 --> 13:51.800]  store shelves acting like this was something dirty and bad what he said which was his own
[13:51.800 --> 13:56.680]  personal opinion sending the message that if you give out your opinion against anything that's in
[13:56.680 --> 14:05.160]  the agenda of the establishment obama care open borders gun control the gay mafia agenda in the
[14:05.160 --> 14:12.760]  schools if you come out and you speak against that you are going to be stifled you are going to be
[14:12.760 --> 14:18.920]  fired you are going to be boycotted you're going to be shut down and you know this has not been
[14:18.920 --> 14:23.240]  an issue i've really covered in my 18 years on air because we have a lot of big things going on
[14:23.240 --> 14:30.120]  and i am a person that's into equality and i have absolutely no dislike or hatred for anybody i mean
[14:30.120 --> 14:36.920]  i just don't sorry no that kind of ruins the fun to think somebody hates you uh but when people
[14:36.920 --> 14:44.840]  start using a civil right movement to beat everybody else over the head and to push a whole other
[14:44.840 --> 14:51.320]  agenda that's that's connected like train cars to the engine that is the gay agenda uh i mean i'm
[14:51.320 --> 14:55.720]  sick of it i don't like a salesman coming to my door over and over again i don't like anybody
[14:55.720 --> 15:01.640]  being pushy i don't like government being pushy and this is really pushy and really out of control
[15:01.640 --> 15:09.000]  and it's causing a giant backlash it is it's causing a huge backlash and camille paglia said it best
[15:09.000 --> 15:21.240]  she said that this is fascistic and ultra stylistic
[15:25.240 --> 15:31.480]  so this is the type of issue that we're dealing with where they can set the precedent
[15:32.120 --> 15:37.000]  with everybody going oh come on be nice you know be open minded oh come on they can then open the
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.800]  door up and bring everything else in like they've already done i mean look at how they say it's racist
[15:41.800 --> 15:47.960]  if you don't support obama care look at how they say if you don't support gun control you're racist
[15:47.960 --> 15:53.800]  you're like explain to me how that's racist well the n r a is the klan you're like actually the n r a
[15:53.800 --> 15:59.960]  was founded to fight the klan shut up racist i've been in debates with people on the radio
[15:59.960 --> 16:07.720]  i've done a lot of interviews on xm on the different quote urban black channels
[16:07.720 --> 16:11.640]  some of them friendly some of them not where people say point blank listen is it really
[16:11.640 --> 16:15.880]  just that you're racist that you don't you don't want to want to restrict guns and have obama
[16:15.880 --> 16:20.520]  care and then you have to sit there it's like saying is it true you rape your wife or beat your
[16:20.520 --> 16:27.800]  wife is it is it true you uh put cigarettes out on your children is it true you're a child molester
[16:27.800 --> 16:33.560]  and it's a way to have the moral authority and i've gotten to the point where when i'm on these shows
[16:33.560 --> 16:36.440]  and they also do it on like just liberal democrat type shows
[16:39.080 --> 16:43.080]  and people say that i go i'm not going to answer that question i'm here to talk about this issue
[16:43.080 --> 16:47.720]  you had me on about i'm not going to sit here and defend myself i'm not going to sit here and say no
[16:47.720 --> 16:55.080]  i'm not a racist listen i don't want to turn my guns in i don't want to be enslaved i don't want to
[16:55.080 --> 16:59.640]  only have the government with the force i don't want to live in new york chicago or dc where
[16:59.640 --> 17:03.320]  they've taken the guns and they have the highest crime rates in the country and in the case of
[17:03.320 --> 17:08.120]  chicago the world i don't want to live in mexico where they've taken the guns and have the highest
[17:08.120 --> 17:13.720]  crime rate as a nation in the world only beat by a city chicago worldwide look up the numbers
[17:14.920 --> 17:19.880]  seventy something thousand dead the last seven eight years or more than that now actually
[17:19.880 --> 17:25.960]  seventy thousand about a year ago when i checked over ten thousand a year that they know of a lot
[17:25.960 --> 17:36.680]  more dead and and and missing mia so that's what it comes down to and they even came out and said
[17:36.680 --> 17:43.000]  oh my gosh fast and furious american guns killed mexicans it's racist we've got to ban our guns
[17:43.000 --> 17:49.000]  again that same race issue when it's the big drug cartels with the big banks flying in fully
[17:49.000 --> 17:55.160]  auto grenade launchers armored vehicles almost all the weapons the cartels have who did not come
[17:55.160 --> 18:00.360]  from the united states that's in major investigative journal pieces you can look them up they're
[18:00.360 --> 18:09.320]  getting their weapons from major defense contractor companies and wells fargo and wacovia owning and
[18:09.320 --> 18:19.160]  leasing the aircraft that fly the weapons in and the drugs out and and that came out in the news
[18:19.160 --> 18:26.200]  they're constantly having us army us navy especially us navy it keeps popping up caught
[18:26.200 --> 18:31.080]  and they'll burn some low-level guys that are caught we just put one of those articles on screen
[18:31.080 --> 18:43.800]  shipping grenade launchers full auto heavy guns to mexico and this is huge shipments of hang
[18:43.800 --> 18:51.000]  grenades it's just constant that's what the cartels have armored vehicles grenade launchers full
[18:51.000 --> 18:57.320]  auto they're not from gun shops doesn't matter though we knew about the gun walking case before
[18:57.320 --> 19:01.800]  we knew the name of it fast and furious we knew that they were going to blame it because the
[19:01.800 --> 19:06.760]  attorney general was saying when he was in office a year they were in the news giving press conferences
[19:06.760 --> 19:13.800]  with janet napolitano janet reno part two saying we're going to use the fact that these guns are
[19:13.800 --> 19:17.880]  down they're killing people we have a tracing program to go after the second amendment here
[19:17.880 --> 19:21.720]  and that's why she got caught perjuring herself because then she said i never heard of that
[19:21.720 --> 19:25.800]  and the attorney general said i never heard of that and we played the clips here and congress
[19:25.800 --> 19:31.800]  pointed it out that they ran the whole thing and then i'm like hey i don't want to be disarmed
[19:31.800 --> 19:38.200]  shut up racist again this is the literal brainwashing of two plus two equals five eight hundred
[19:38.200 --> 19:42.280]  two five nine ninety two thirty one hundredth anniversary the federal reserve i want your

[24:50.760 --> 24:57.960]  they did so without any public announcement of the change over the weekend government officials not
[24:57.960 --> 25:03.800]  servants an outside it conference working on the online marketplace computer system made a

[25:35.400 --> 25:42.600]  humans and myself that were under this yoke and then it said admitted horribly evil fraud to abuse
[25:42.600 --> 25:47.560]  everyone and then we have to sit here and watch the very people that have gotten us caught up in
[25:47.560 --> 25:55.000]  this spaghetti wire barbed wire mesh this snarl they've got us tied in knots and then they will
[25:55.000 --> 26:03.000]  play the part of the saviors untying us but will only bound us down tighter and it just goes on and
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.920]  on and on and on because the complexity of the world has gotten the average person to feel overwhelmed
[26:08.920 --> 26:14.760]  and just to go into a catatonic political state and do nothing to where we're dead in the water
[26:14.760 --> 26:22.680]  and these vampires these political sharks can do whatever they want we're gonna get that article
[26:22.680 --> 26:27.080]  up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com that is that is very very important i'm gonna

[26:40.360 --> 26:46.520]  obama care reaches record low and polls pitched at gay clubs yeah they're pitching it to young
[26:46.520 --> 26:51.640]  people and folks that they think are big supporters of obama who will just buy into it because it's
[26:51.640 --> 26:59.160]  a religious right to be ripped off democratic senators warning of a meltdown if this doesn't
[26:59.160 --> 27:04.920]  get fixed it's working perfectly or on drugs double triple quadruple the drugs on the street
[27:04.920 --> 27:11.320]  depending on the drug type prison populations tripled since they launched it in the 1970s late
[27:11.320 --> 27:18.520]  1970s the banks launder hundreds of billions a year of the drug money and even take control
[27:18.520 --> 27:24.680]  of arming their soldiers that is a huge success to make drugs illegal to give them a high price
[27:24.680 --> 27:29.720]  to create a marketplace to then have hollywood and the culture promote them from rock and roll
[27:29.720 --> 27:34.440]  to the hip hop people to everything in between and then have the young people use it and as the
[27:34.440 --> 27:38.760]  economy falls apart that's all that's left in the economy show women go into the sex trade
[27:38.760 --> 27:47.880]  and our entire economy converts to gulag casino model that max keiser talks about
[27:49.400 --> 27:58.680]  ap says the health care overhaul is the top 2013 story the glitch plagued rollout of obama
[28:00.200 --> 28:05.800]  and his oracle obama health care overhaul was the top news story of 2013 followed by the
[28:05.800 --> 28:10.760]  boston marathon bombing and the dramatic papal change over at the vatican according to the
[28:10.760 --> 28:17.080]  associated press annual poll of us editors and news directors the saga of obama care
[28:18.200 --> 28:24.040]  i mean look do you think that when they conquer you they don't know you're going to hate them and
[28:24.040 --> 28:29.880]  know we're being conquered taken over by foreign banks where they can charge unlimited double
[28:29.880 --> 28:34.440]  triple quadruple or more for health insurance and lower the quality and control our lives with
[28:34.440 --> 28:39.400]  social engineering monitoring what we eat where we go and what we do to put it into a database
[28:39.400 --> 28:44.040]  of social engineering of course it's going to come out and be horrible so they act like it's
[28:44.040 --> 28:50.680]  all a screw up and a mistake and then say let us fully socialize it which is what the architect
[28:50.680 --> 28:57.000]  says is the plan at zcule manual and others and then hit their idiot supporters go oh genius plan
[28:57.000 --> 29:02.440]  we support obama care now wink wink you're going to make it totally free and be a money transfer
[29:02.440 --> 29:07.800]  from the rich to us but meanwhile the ultra rich have engineered it it'll never be socialist it'll
[29:07.800 --> 29:14.040]  be totally hyper fascist worse than socialism by a long measure i mean we're talking i don't know
[29:14.040 --> 29:18.120]  10 times worse 20 times worse i don't know i can't put a number on that i can't quantify that
[29:19.480 --> 29:25.960]  you can't quantify something this evil socialism is bad enough and always degenerates and falls
[29:25.960 --> 29:30.680]  apart and brings undue control to government and inside grips but this this is a deal where now
[29:30.680 --> 29:35.720]  they'll make it even worse and jack up even more and have more taxes to fund it to pay for it that
[29:35.720 --> 29:41.320]  goes to these insurance companies that should be arrested these executives that wrote this law not
[29:41.320 --> 29:46.440]  just obama gets in trouble not just obama's approval rating goes down but the people that wrote this
[29:46.440 --> 29:54.520]  need to be hauled up and indicted for fraud we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and

[33:42.600 --> 33:48.680]  going to get into record radiation handling of fukushima cleanup is a comedy of errors that's
[33:48.680 --> 33:53.400]  out of the japanese news the japanese news that i reported on yesterday says that the wave of
[33:53.400 --> 33:58.440]  radiation about to hit the united states over the next three to four months it begins hitting in about
[33:58.440 --> 34:05.240]  a month it'll take about three months for it all to come in the wreckage the water all of it that's
[34:05.240 --> 34:09.560]  going to hit after two years it took that long to get over here will be 10 times the radiation we've
[34:09.560 --> 34:15.400]  been hit with so far we're going to get into the hundredth anniversary of the private run for
[34:15.400 --> 34:21.000]  profit federal reserve chase limits card used for customers at risk and target breach see how great
[34:21.000 --> 34:27.320]  the cashless society is and the answer to that is more of the cashless society the inventor of the
[34:27.320 --> 34:32.760]  ak-47 dies in russia he invented it during world war two the inventor of the kalishnikov assault
[34:32.760 --> 34:45.000]  rifle michael kalishnikov dies at age 94 so that certainly uh is momentous i guess he died on the
[34:45.000 --> 34:53.720]  date uh of the federal reserve's hundredth anniversary that's too bad that's it that is an
[34:53.720 --> 34:57.960]  amazing rifle you can drag it through the mud anything compared to other rifles that i own
[34:57.960 --> 35:04.680]  quite a bit of really nifty great little firearm they say there's hundreds and hundreds of millions
[35:04.680 --> 35:14.040]  of them worldwide so there's that little piece of news uh briefly speaking of radiation the reason
[35:14.040 --> 35:21.080]  i discovered pure atomic nascent iodine is i was researching about four or five months ago what to
[35:21.080 --> 35:27.480]  do for myself and my family and our thyroids uh and it just kept coming up iodine iodine but not
[35:27.480 --> 35:32.520]  the bound iodine which is better than nothing that you can get from some supplements out there
[35:32.520 --> 35:37.560]  seaweed like the modifier when we sell it in four store dot com or enforce life dot com that's from
[35:37.560 --> 35:44.040]  the southern hemisphere so it's a lot cleaner but this is literally the pure atomic and that doesn't
[35:44.040 --> 35:49.160]  mean radioactive which is in its atomic form it's in its raw form that's why this stuff turns purple
[35:49.160 --> 35:55.640]  blue electric color on paper and other iodine's turn black and then turn dark rust red because
[35:55.640 --> 36:01.320]  they're bound and personally uh i can't take it gives me stomach aches things like that and there's
[36:01.320 --> 36:05.640]  a lot of other research in that you can look into which it's better than nothing the point is this
[36:05.640 --> 36:09.720]  particular iodine when i started taking it was so amazing i found there's one place that had it so
[36:09.720 --> 36:16.280]  i basically got the exclusive on it and that is our info wars life survival shield nascent iodine

[39:02.840 --> 39:07.960]  rod in france hope you're having a great christmas or holiday over there uh i want to talk about
[39:07.960 --> 39:13.880]  obama care and henry kissinger uh you're on the air thanks for calling yeah hi it's merry christmas
[39:13.880 --> 39:21.880]  to you youtube brother thank you um yeah um i'm an expat obviously uh been in france for 13 years
[39:21.880 --> 39:30.440]  now i was wondering um you know do you think uh that uh me being expatriated i still haven't
[39:30.440 --> 39:35.000]  addressed in the united states with this mandate do you think they're you know that they would
[39:35.560 --> 39:42.040]  actually try to get me to uh you know to charge me some type of fine for not finding up if uh
[39:42.040 --> 39:47.880]  if i'm not fiscally in the united states well that's really what globalism is all about
[39:48.440 --> 39:54.280]  is that when snowden they thought was trying to fly into austria they ordered the plane to land
[39:54.280 --> 39:58.280]  even though that wasn't under their control they did it and so that's what globalism is
[39:58.280 --> 40:03.720]  is this global corporations using american energy and power with england and the e u and others
[40:04.280 --> 40:09.320]  and japan and china all working together to to basically oppress the individual that have nowhere
[40:09.320 --> 40:16.520]  to run and i have seen discussion of what they call clawing back money from expats even if you take
[40:16.520 --> 40:24.120]  off uh after taxes money offshore they're now trying to claim that they're going to somehow
[40:24.120 --> 40:27.720]  try to grab international bank accounts go after that's what they're going to for swiss bank
[40:27.720 --> 40:34.360]  accounts not the billionaires bank accounts but the little guys bank accounts now and so um i think
[40:34.360 --> 40:37.880]  certainly they're going to go after the low-hanging fruit of people that went to sign up for the quote
[40:37.880 --> 40:42.840]  free health care putting in their data admitting they don't have it swearing under perjury so they
[40:42.840 --> 40:47.320]  have them in a court of law at least on paper because that's what it says you waive your rights
[40:47.320 --> 40:51.960]  and you're basically in a court just like when you remember the free car deal or the car rebate deal
[40:52.760 --> 40:56.920]  in the in the auto bailout a few years ago where when you'd go to the site it would say
[40:56.920 --> 41:01.800]  the federal government's taking control of your computer all your data is now ours you waive all
[41:01.800 --> 41:07.160]  your rights this is what they do it's like when you go to the hospital now under obama care it
[41:07.160 --> 41:11.880]  on the form it says under under the affordable care act all your data is now public to all these
[41:11.880 --> 41:16.360]  agencies and groups and whoever we want to give it to it's basically a bunch of liability protection
[41:16.360 --> 41:22.360]  for the corporations to shut down their competition shut down the little guy and do whatever they want
[41:22.360 --> 41:28.040]  and so i can't give you a definitive answer because they're holding their their cards close to their
[41:28.040 --> 41:32.600]  vest they already are debiting accounts they're already saying they're going to go after uh uh
[41:32.600 --> 41:37.400]  tax refunds they're already saying they're going to start garnishing wages that's always been in the
[41:37.400 --> 41:46.520]  legislation and so now they're going to go after their idiot supporters first who love being just
[41:46.520 --> 41:53.640]  absolutely beat by the system and that they're they're they want the punishment they enjoy it
[41:54.680 --> 42:01.240]  but as for you i don't know but i would imagine down the road listen i have california sending
[42:01.240 --> 42:08.840]  me letters uh saying you do business in california you owe us uh sell taxes when we clearly have
[42:08.840 --> 42:14.200]  talked to the lawyers we don't uh but most people will get scared under threats of of
[42:14.200 --> 42:19.240]  penalty and interest and we'll start paying these mafia so i've got tentacles shooting down here from
[42:19.240 --> 42:25.480]  minnesota tentacles shooting at me from california tentacles coming in and most people get a letter
[42:25.480 --> 42:34.120]  from government or from god and they literally roll over uh so what do you think yeah i've you
[42:34.120 --> 42:38.840]  know i i kind of feel the same way i mean i've already been harassed by the internal revenue
[42:38.840 --> 42:46.600]  service um you know for uh you know not uh uh for claiming zero on my taxes because i have
[42:46.600 --> 42:53.240]  zero income in the united states and and you know and i mean just literally just uh facetiously
[42:54.120 --> 43:00.040]  uh you know dropping threats over the phone uh you know and i you're trying to explain yourself
[43:00.040 --> 43:04.760]  and and they just keep saying well you're still taxable you're still taxable it's like no i'm
[43:04.760 --> 43:10.120]  not you know i don't know that's why i was asking that question and i do i do have a follow
[43:10.120 --> 43:14.360]  and i do agree with your with your point of view on that i mean i really wouldn't be surprised at
[43:14.360 --> 43:20.760]  all if you know if they just you know came after me and and started you know i don't know how they
[43:20.760 --> 43:26.760]  would garnish my wages in france but considering it's uh if you look at it from a globalist
[43:26.760 --> 43:32.760]  point of view there's absolutely uh a possibility well listen these criminal enterprises all fight
[43:32.760 --> 43:37.400]  with each other as well that's part of why it's so vicious and because there is a survival of
[43:37.400 --> 43:44.200]  the fittest social Darwinism built in to their own kleptocratic you know criminal uh great games
[43:44.200 --> 43:51.080]  as they call them the feeding on the unwashed gullible masses but i'm not a tax lawyer but
[43:51.080 --> 43:57.320]  i've looked at it and obviously i've looked at at leaving the united states before and if you've
[43:57.320 --> 44:03.720]  if you've paid taxes on everything that you then take out of the nation they should have no further
[44:03.720 --> 44:10.120]  claim on any of that as long as you don't have any of that apportioned in investments inside the
[44:10.120 --> 44:14.840]  united states now that's debating it from their perspective of fraud of course they're criminal
[44:14.840 --> 44:21.400]  and we'll take anything they can separately we got the fellow reserve 100 years ago today along
[44:21.400 --> 44:28.520]  with the income tax to fund it so it's all a fraud to begin with we had 10 growth rates 10.5
[44:28.520 --> 44:37.400]  growth rates from 1789 until 1913 on average we've never had anything near a 10 growth rate in one
[44:37.400 --> 44:44.120]  year since then because the it's the the artificial economy is always waging war on the real economy
[44:44.120 --> 44:49.000]  because it's not enough to just skim money and power off of it they want to devalue the real
[44:49.000 --> 44:55.080]  economy devalue their host tie their host down where their host is unconscious and can't ever
[44:55.080 --> 45:01.080]  struggle back against them so it's the debasing of the currency and the impoverishment of the host
[45:01.080 --> 45:08.600]  is the goal in fact that's the goal of the takeover is to hurt people and dominate and and create
[45:08.600 --> 45:16.440]  pestilence and create darkness that's that's what these people do i appreciate your call i mean it
[45:16.440 --> 45:23.400]  i mean it the evil and the corruption is not a byproduct it is the journey it is the ring it is
[45:23.400 --> 45:31.080]  the goal it is the the land it is the promised land it is the destination the ruination of the
[45:31.080 --> 45:38.280]  individual but turning yourself over to pure hatred just scorn upon scorn for humanity
[45:38.280 --> 45:47.800]  abject hate huge endless furnaces of hatred in their heart for us that warm them so and and our
[45:47.800 --> 45:55.160]  gullibility is the fuel of this whole thing let's go ahead and talk to scott in vermont you're on
[45:55.160 --> 46:00.760]  the air go ahead alex yeah we should be leaving messages with our congress critters telling him
[46:00.760 --> 46:06.680]  that 100 years of that ponzi scheme known as the fed is more than enough and uh they need to end
[46:06.680 --> 46:13.320]  the fed or we can well end their tenure in congress but um in the last few few weeks or so i've noticed
[46:13.320 --> 46:20.680]  the uh again the hypocrisy and double standard of the left the authoritarian left um with all the
[46:20.680 --> 46:26.040]  news was mandela is great mandela nothing nothing about the the bombings and the terrorism and the
[46:26.040 --> 46:34.120]  violence but uh you know it's it's like the end justifies the means for them whereas uh you know
[46:34.120 --> 46:38.200]  he he was sort of just they won't say they will admit it outright might be to bring it up to them
[46:38.200 --> 46:44.440]  they might that admit that uh you know it was necessary to do that violence to end apartheid
[46:44.440 --> 46:49.400]  but uh but if you want to you know you think you own uh have a right to own a gun second amendment
[46:49.400 --> 46:55.480]  well forget that and uh even your kid i noticed a guy called joys riley show and uh complained
[46:55.480 --> 47:01.720]  about how his son was told uh after his son was attacked by a bully that uh the son was told you
[47:01.720 --> 47:05.400]  don't have a right to defend yourself oh yeah no no no the bullies don't really get in trouble
[47:05.400 --> 47:11.960]  the ultimate act in a globalist domesticated system is to fight back in england they will throw you
[47:11.960 --> 47:16.840]  under the prison if you even raise a hand to defend yourself even if you're a woman being raped
[47:16.840 --> 47:21.320]  no one the ultimate sin is the individual defending themselves against criminal energy
[47:22.040 --> 47:26.440]  they don't even have a right to own a gun anymore in england if somebody breaks in your house there
[47:26.440 --> 47:29.880]  you have to hit them over the head with a pipe but even that though they'll hold against you won't
[47:29.880 --> 47:34.120]  they oh no you can look it up they will put you in prison and then let the person that did it go
[47:34.760 --> 47:39.160]  but we got we got to point out the hypocrisy and the double standard that is wrong that that that
[47:39.160 --> 47:44.680]  that uh you know it it was good that you know apartheid was stopped but uh you know it's not
[47:44.680 --> 47:50.600]  good that they totally ignored in the media the uh the truth about mandela and uh all the violence
[47:50.600 --> 47:56.840]  and the necklace thing and and and the torture and murders that was done by his order and uh
[47:56.840 --> 48:03.240]  they don't they don't want to talk about that of course very well said sir i appreciate your call
[48:03.240 --> 48:08.280]  have a great christmas coming up we're going to be discussing with uh the author of creation from
[48:08.280 --> 48:13.640]  jackall island geobrid griffin one of the foremost experts in the fellow reserve the 100th anniversary
[48:13.640 --> 48:18.120]  up on info wars dot com we have the article by michael schneider on the 100th anniversary the
[48:18.120 --> 48:23.400]  fellow reserve here are 100 reasons to shut it down forever and i'm going to go over some of those
[48:23.400 --> 48:27.560]  100 with him and talk about where we're going but here's the really good news we stopped the
[48:27.560 --> 48:32.600]  expansion of the syria war we exposed that our criminal government's running al-qaeda and is illegitimate
[48:33.480 --> 48:39.720]  we have exposed obama carers a total fraud we defeated their attempted gun grab in 2013 and
[48:39.720 --> 48:44.360]  actually the polls show it reversed because people had common sense understanding of why blame
[48:44.360 --> 48:48.920]  the general public for what prozac head democrat devil worshipers do and that's just who the
[48:48.920 --> 48:53.480]  and the shooters are crime rates down 50 some percent with guns other crimes not involving
[48:53.480 --> 48:58.360]  guns are actually up now because of the economy falling apart thank god for guns actually keeping
[48:58.360 --> 49:03.960]  law in order the police would be completely overrun and overwhelmed like they are in chicago and
[49:03.960 --> 49:10.120]  new york and dc if it wasn't for guns other parts of the country i mean you don't see home invasions
[49:10.120 --> 49:14.600]  you don't see thugs walking around texas up to your gas stations at night when i was pumping gas
[49:14.600 --> 49:19.880]  last night with my son because you know they know most people are packing by the way i was packing
[49:20.920 --> 49:25.720]  i had a m4 right there in the backseat of the truck where i was pumping gas
[49:26.600 --> 49:31.240]  m4 boom locked and loaded in one second if i needed to be
[49:33.800 --> 49:40.440]  and that's a good feeling that's a real good feeling and that's a feeling of being a man
[49:40.440 --> 49:47.720]  in charge of my own security and my family's security and that's what it comes down to
[49:48.760 --> 49:54.680]  quite frankly also had a judge circuit rider with me right there with 45 longcults as well
[49:55.560 --> 49:58.760]  only reason i had that in the car though is we were doing some target practice
[49:59.560 --> 50:04.360]  uh a few days ago i don't know friends place so that's why both those are still in the car
[50:04.360 --> 50:11.240]  usually uh there is another firearm in the vehicle for the protection of the family but
[50:11.240 --> 50:16.120]  i had that in the house cleaning it but that's what it comes down to in this country we're going
[50:16.120 --> 50:21.880]  to go to break and come back with chris and then we're going to go to ryan and then nathan
[50:21.880 --> 50:27.160]  and then brandon and then at the second segment eight after next hour we're going to have a
[50:27.160 --> 50:33.400]  constitutional lawyer bruce fine on the broadcast with us but what i want to get out here is we are
[50:33.400 --> 50:39.240]  on the march the empire is on the run and their counter-offensives against us are these attempts
[50:39.240 --> 50:43.560]  to shut down free speech are these attempts to scare us into submission the good news is the
[50:43.560 --> 50:49.240]  average person in the system is in the same boat as us and stands again for being in a free country
[50:49.880 --> 50:57.000]  and the tide is turning people are waking up every number shows that congress has a six percent
[50:57.000 --> 51:02.200]  approval rating no government's ever been that unpopular so it's off to grandma's house for the
[51:02.200 --> 51:08.680]  holidays eh that's great but while you're going over the river and through the woods professional

[54:39.240 --> 54:44.040]  anniversary of the private federal reserve that's done a great job at destroying our country
[54:44.040 --> 54:49.480]  overturning every institution and waging war on the individual badmouthing the founding fathers
[54:49.480 --> 54:55.000]  and all of our bill of rights by every yardstick we are living in the midst of a high-tech amalgamation
[54:55.000 --> 55:01.480]  of socialism communism and fascism with a technological technocracy setting up an autocratic
[55:01.480 --> 55:07.560]  system above it where the globalist are above the law in the ultimate form of total discrimination
[55:07.560 --> 55:11.960]  against humanity and the public doesn't know that because we're too busy fighting over gay
[55:11.960 --> 55:17.560]  straight black white old young christian atheist i mean they've really divided and conquered us
[55:17.560 --> 55:21.960]  and the average person out there loves fighting with each other though they're starting to wake up
[55:21.960 --> 55:29.080]  and it's just so frustrating to see us all being cheated and robbed and to see the bureaucrats and
[55:29.080 --> 55:34.360]  government people that have been trained to see us as prey when we're all prey and i want to change
[55:34.360 --> 55:37.800]  this the world's never going to be a perfect place till our lord and savior returns but
[55:38.520 --> 55:43.560]  we can make it a better place if we try if not we give it over to evil when good people do nothing
[55:43.560 --> 55:51.640]  evil takes over christ in florida you're on the air go ahead hey alex uh first time caller um it's
[55:51.640 --> 55:57.240]  one of the merry christmas and um i wanted to ask you a quick question that here's a real simple one
[55:57.240 --> 56:04.120]  what is the best way for an ordinary citizen for an ordinary person who works limited hours a week
[56:04.120 --> 56:09.160]  to boycott the federal reserve boycott the irs you know show them that we're not going to take this
[56:09.160 --> 56:13.960]  we're not going to sit here and be taxed over the perform banks for all these derivatives
[56:13.960 --> 56:19.720]  we're not going to take this anymore what can what can an individual do personally do in his own life
[56:21.160 --> 56:24.760]  well here's the issue no matter how many taxes we pay they're always going to spend more than
[56:25.320 --> 56:30.040]  than comes in to bankrupt us under cloward and piven that's the amended plan of course they did
[56:30.040 --> 56:34.920]  that previously to that sociological development and idea developed by the democrats in the 60s
[56:34.920 --> 56:40.920]  that's a good example of them being honest about how they operate make us poor so they can control us
[56:41.560 --> 56:47.880]  but as a point of fact you can't survive in many cases playing ball and going ball their rules
[56:47.880 --> 56:53.080]  it's designed by criminals to make it impossible but to ensnare you for not following the rules
[56:53.080 --> 56:57.000]  because they're exempt it's like they're running a race but you're wearing bowling balls around
[56:57.000 --> 57:04.200]  your legs running in flypaper and they're running on a totally clean athletic track so they rig the
[57:04.200 --> 57:09.960]  game uh they fix the deck they you know they stack the deck if i was you
[57:12.680 --> 57:16.200]  i would make your own personal decisions if you're fighting them on a large scale
[57:16.200 --> 57:20.680]  out in the open with a bunch of crew members like myself i pay the ransom to the private
[57:20.680 --> 57:25.320]  federal reserve through the irs uh because they would shut me down they would arrest me and they
[57:25.320 --> 57:31.720]  have kangaroo juries that would send me to a gulag okay uh so i can then educate people that it is
[57:31.720 --> 57:37.080]  a ransom it is the mafia they'll break your legs but there are 60 million people estimated not counting
[57:37.080 --> 57:43.480]  illegals who don't pay the income tax and don't aren't the system and and it is hurting them that's
[57:43.480 --> 57:47.880]  why they want to get rid and and make the underground economy illegal so you can't survive so you
[57:47.880 --> 57:52.920]  barter as much as you can you support local as much as you can you go to farmers markets you go to
[57:52.920 --> 57:58.360]  swap meets you can go to uh notice all the big corporations don't want to take cash now you keep

[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:53.560]  and fukushima but experts divided on the cause and us sailors that helped are in lawsuits over
[1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:58.280]  increased cancers and we're seeing record radiation levels and a big wave about to hit the us i'm
[1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:02.200]  going to cover that then we're going to have some other guests popping in on the 100th anniversary
[1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:07.080]  of the private federal reserve right now let's go back to your calls nathan in texas thank you
[1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:15.080]  for calling in the day hey alex hey brother i have a question about um the kind of the population
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:23.080]  agenda um as far as like bill gates and uh vote for women for all of them like in in that in that
[1:01:23.080 --> 1:01:31.080]  conference i read online that um bill gates wanted to cap the global population at 8.3 billion
[1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:35.880]  i don't know what significance that has but what do you think about that well look they have a
[1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:40.040]  public face for population reduction and global one-child policies and they have their internal
[1:01:40.040 --> 1:01:45.000]  documents that we've sourced and covered in films like in game and then many since that film came
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:55.720]  out seven almost eight years ago but bill gates uh has said that he wants in in conferences to
[1:01:55.720 --> 1:02:01.080]  actually bring the number of humans putting on carbon dioxide down to zero and everybody laughs
[1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:04.760]  because they can see the equation and he's promoted death panels and all the rest of it but
[1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:10.120]  in their internal documents and then when they also made public statements they debate 80 to 90
[1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:15.720]  percent reduction and they rest on average at about an 80 percent reduction that's kind of like
[1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:20.440]  we are changed about a year ago i was able to talk to ted turner on the street and ted turner
[1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:26.840]  you know said that he wanted the world at about a billion i'm going for remember maybe said 500
[1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:31.720]  million he said 500 million in a newspaper interview but i think he said a billion and then
[1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:37.320]  another speech he said three billion uh so the point is is that is that they're using the excuse
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:42.760]  of claiming there's overpopulation but you can debate either way as the excuse for them to have
[1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:49.000]  an organized system and for them to rule the world and have autocratic control but then they're the
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.960]  people with five six seven kids living in this large ass and they're really just anti-human do
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:03:02.040]  you see what i'm saying yeah exactly what you're saying yeah but i see the public all lackadaisical
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:06.280]  and so relaxed and not caring and the globalists say well see they they deserve to die they don't
[1:03:06.280 --> 1:03:11.320]  even care you know they write public papers and they say they do that because the slaves need to
[1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:15.000]  you know have a chance to know it was there it's kind of like legally publishing and
[1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:19.000]  saying in the newspaper that you're going to repossess something or that you're going to
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:23.880]  uh publicly do something and the folks don't respond that's their fault for not reading the
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:28.600]  public notices it's like a vampire has to ask permission to get in your house so does that
[1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:36.680]  answer your question yes exactly and another point to that um i um i'm at college and everywhere i go
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:43.000]  i'm looking at around everybody's on their phones and i just i just noticed that it's hard it's hard
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:48.840]  to find people who don't like take their eyes off technology i i go around talking to people i'm
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:54.280]  pretty talkative person and i know the general public has lower brain waves they're in a trance
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:03:59.880]  this is the insertion into the matrix then it's goggles then it's a port uh then it's in your
[1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:07.880]  brain and and that is the evolution if you could see it in a time lapse over the next 20 years
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:21.080]  it's basically televisions flat screens ipads ipods google glasses um tv contact lenses brain
[1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:26.120]  ports and then basically you would see the television turn into a monster in our hand
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:31.480]  that then goes on our face like an alien attached to us and then down our throat and then we die
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:39.240]  uh do you see what i'm saying yeah yeah i mean it's crazy man it's going to get a lot crazier
[1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:45.240]  this is the beginning of the meltdown of society this is it but you're also going to see the
[1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:48.920]  beginning of the awakening for every action is an equal opposite reaction god bless you

[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:11.480]  to print stuff instead of just looking at it on screen that we have a hard copy if they change
[1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:18.440]  the news story which they do sometimes and because it's easier to find but the headlines the next
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:24.040]  detroit atlantic city and los vegas facing catastrophic collapse with the closure of the
[1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:32.040]  recent atlantic club casino hotel rumors of the bankrupt being sold to hard rock more than half

[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:51.800]  los vegas all those places are going to end up being tombs a tomb in the desert and a tomb
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:59.720]  on the side of the atlantic ocean and it's globalism it's not just these cities like detroit
[1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:05.080]  and other areas we were going to be a service economy that was never the plan we are being
[1:12:05.080 --> 1:12:15.480]  deindustrialized right now as a civilization that is the plan to make us completely and totally
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:20.520]  manageable by the establishment and now they don't want to speaking out so
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:27.960]  political correctness is now the model to come in and chill free speech but to make
[1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:34.040]  not having free speech like a civil right oh muslims don't like selling alcohol at grocery stores
[1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:40.520]  that sell wine and beer so we're not going to sell wine and beer or or they don't have to serve you
[1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:45.560]  and you think of that as a civil right about their rights but then it just becomes a thing to
[1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:53.960]  walk on everybody else's rights and that's what's going on here that's the program and it's very

[1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:57.240]  presidential campaign and beyond and i i i want to cover the waterfront with him and get into the
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:14:02.680]  centralization of power and the and the testimony they had three weeks ago in congress where liberals
[1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:10.040]  uh professors said we're going into tyranny uh and conservative uh experts said the same thing
[1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:14.600]  i mean there's no doubt so so what type is a historian and a top constitutional lawyer
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:21.000]  and advisor to congress would he call this but before we get to that because he did head up the
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:25.240]  FCC i know when they opened up the first amendment and got rid of the so-called fairness doctor and
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:29.560]  they're trying to bring that back now under new names and restrict free speech everywhere
[1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:36.600]  i'd like to get his take on what camille paglia called uh fascist and ultra stylistic the duck
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:43.320]  dinosaur situation as a first amendment expert uh mr fine just briefly on the subject what do you
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:48.440]  make of the moves with sopa and syspa and fairness doctrines being promoted again and everything
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:53.160]  when you're one of the guys who never gets really the credit i know in being instrumental in
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:57.720]  getting first amendment back into the media well you know we forget for a while we didn't
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:03.080]  have it in this country where it is right now and what the goals are well the restrictions
[1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:10.120]  largely remain for only over the air broadcasting it doesn't apply all these FCC rules uh that threaten
[1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:17.400]  licenses for incorrect speech don't apply to cablecasters or people using the internet or otherwise
[1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:25.080]  it's sort of a vested of old time thinking and the idea that government was paternalistic and
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:30.360]  knew the most enlightened way in which issues should be debated so they would evaluate the fairness
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:35.400]  with which a particular radio or television broadcast or covered a controversial issue
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:41.560]  i was just your head of uh forcing the abandonment of that process you can't believe how subjective
[1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:45.960]  how the standard was for determined whether fairness you counted up a second for the half
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:51.480]  second of devotion to one viewpoint or another was it said with churchillian eloquent so it
[1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:56.680]  now the clumsiness of a school child who weighed more than the other it was so arbitrary it's
[1:15:56.680 --> 1:16:03.640]  ridiculous and of course um since the abandonment of the fairness doctrine i think the conversation
[1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:10.360]  has been much more robust uh and fear of the intimidating effects of complaints that the FCC
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:15.800]  about fairness have left now they're trying to bring it back in and anytime someone goes on the
[1:16:15.800 --> 1:16:19.880]  airwaves there's something that other people disagree with i mean we ought to applaud that
[1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:24.120]  that's what this country is about if you're not big enough to be able to accept an idea that you're
[1:16:24.120 --> 1:16:28.120]  just that you disagree with you really don't belong here but that's really what liberty and
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:34.040]  freedom is about do you agree as a constitutional lawyer that it's Stalinistic uh to demand that
[1:16:35.160 --> 1:16:43.240]  phil robertson be quote reeducated as glad did that it sounds like the chinese reeducation camp
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:51.160]  if you didn't echo my own ideas properly uh the fact is people have a right to dispute what uh
[1:16:51.160 --> 1:16:56.760]  he said uh and urge him to change his view he's got a right to insist that he'll listen to them
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:17:01.720]  but he ultimately gets to believe what he wants to believe that's what freedom is about and it was
[1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:06.360]  on louis brand i said that the remedy for what somebody thinks is ill-conceived speech is more
[1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:13.000]  speak of not coercion not intimidation i mean i actually uh had written a letter not long ago uh in
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:19.640]  response to a former fcc chairman's insistence that the federal communications should prohibit
[1:17:19.640 --> 1:17:24.360]  broadcasters from mentioning the word redskins and talks about the watch the redskins football
[1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:29.080]  team wow i said oh really you know that he said well that would show what a great country were
[1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:34.680]  said no that's not what show a great country word so that we're hostile to the idea of free minds
[1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:39.320]  and people being able to charge their own destiny and moreover no one really believes something if
[1:17:39.320 --> 1:17:45.400]  you have to cram it down their throat it's just a press you know a uh a recitation of what somebody
[1:17:45.400 --> 1:17:52.760]  insists that you said so it really is futile in any event but the fact is um if people disagree
[1:17:52.760 --> 1:17:58.040]  then they should use the communications channels the internet and all the other countless outlets
[1:17:58.040 --> 1:18:02.600]  express their disagreement sure absolutely well i think this is back for them we're gonna go to
[1:18:02.600 --> 1:18:07.080]  break in a moment come back with the big central issue why you agreed to come on during the holidays
[1:18:07.080 --> 1:18:11.560]  and christmas coming up we really appreciate it mr fine but when i just start realizing all the
[1:18:11.560 --> 1:18:16.040]  monumental things you've been involved in for liberty all the times probably had you on 15
[1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:21.720]  times over the years in the last decade i never made the point that uh that you're the guy that
[1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:27.240]  helps spearhead the end of the fairness doctrine that didn't allow talk radio as it exists today
[1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:34.600]  that is such a monumental example of what really one person can do then working with others
[1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:40.360]  so i just want to thank you i mean i guess i owe much of my first amendment and my profession
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:45.800]  to you helping uh fight that and i should have you on sometime just to tell that whole story
[1:18:45.800 --> 1:18:51.480]  because i mean a whole book should be written just on that subject i appreciate the sentiment
[1:18:51.480 --> 1:18:56.120]  we're going to break but in one minute how did that all come about just just briefly
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:03.080]  the fairness doctrine was repealed through a rulemaking that we initiated it was imposed
[1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:08.440]  not by statute by a rule in which had been improperly uh in my judgment interpreted by
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:13.400]  prior general counsel that the commission is required by congress i looked at an exam the
[1:19:13.400 --> 1:19:18.600]  background said no the fairness doctrine was a result of a rule we can initiate a revocation
[1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:24.760]  of the rule which we did uh it sustained the act in the court uh and the large reason why we repealed
[1:19:24.760 --> 1:19:29.400]  it is because we thought it was an unconstitutional encroachment on the right of broadcaster free
[1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:35.640]  speech and in fact had the chilling effect of reducing the broadcasting terrain of Kaplan
[1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:39.640]  and Vanilla because no one wanted to say anything controversial because then they get slapped with
[1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:44.280]  some kind of fairness and that proves that you were right because look at how it's saved a radio
[1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:49.000]  for 20 plus years you're doing that incredible when we come back speaking of rulemaking ruled
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:55.800]  by decree obama and this power grab how do you as a top constitutional lawyer define it what is
[1:19:55.800 --> 1:20:01.160]  the system we're now under the constitutional lawyer bruce fine stay with us alex jones here

[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:25.640]  100 years later before he leaves us okay so bruce you know we called you up to get you on about a
[1:24:25.640 --> 1:24:30.280]  concon as a solution or is it a bad idea to get your take on it you said i'll talk about that
[1:24:30.280 --> 1:24:34.520]  we'll do that in the next segment briefly but i want to talk about the centralization of power
[1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:39.080]  and and the best way to describe it to the public and we talked about the hearings they
[1:24:39.080 --> 1:24:44.760]  had a few weeks ago in congress where this is being admitted and so basically when do we
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:50.200]  become a dictatorship and what type of dictatorship it is uh is it when it's institutional and
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:58.120]  bureaucratic uh what do you call that an oligarchy well i call it one branch government uh that uh
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:04.360]  is indistinguishable from the tyranny that provoked the american revolution and let me try to enumerate
[1:25:04.360 --> 1:25:10.120]  the most egregious use their patience of power and let me just add in the side the problem is not
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:15.320]  that we need a constitution convention to change the constitution we need politicians and the people
[1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:21.640]  who insist on following the constitution instead of flouting it regularly but in any event perhaps
[1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:28.840]  the most awesome power that the president exercises that's probably in the history of the world is the
[1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:36.840]  ability to kill anybody on the planet who he in secret determines is an imminent whatever imminent
[1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:41.080]  could be the next 10 years an imminent danger to the national security of the united states
[1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:46.360]  and the president has done this with regard to four u.s. citizen so far that we know of them
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:52.840]  eight more hundreds of foreigners and he is not accountable for any error that is neither congress
[1:25:52.840 --> 1:25:59.240]  nor the courts nor anyone gets to know whether or not who was killed was innocent uh indistinguishable
[1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:04.600]  from what we would ordinarily call first three murder for example about a year ago a 68 year
[1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:10.520]  old grandmother in pakistan picking vegetables with a nine year old granddaughter now it is
[1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:18.120]  impossible out to conceive of a more awesome power than the authority to vanquish to exterminate any
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:23.960]  person on the planet that you wish with no accountability to anyone that would have made
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:28.920]  king george the third blush but that's just one example the constitution entrusted the congress
[1:26:28.920 --> 1:26:35.000]  the exclusive power to decide on war or peace because it's fraud with so many terrible consequences
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:40.600]  a president's routinely and this president libya he was going to go into syria until the american
[1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:46.600]  people spoke up against it uh he runs warfare in yemen and pakistan unilaterally without any
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:51.640]  congressional authorization i say the founding fathers believed that constant warfare was
[1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:57.080]  irreconcilable with liberty which obviously it is one of the reasons why we have the snowden
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:02.520]  revelations of the uh what a federal judge called an orwellian surveillance state is
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:08.680]  because we report to be a perpetual warfare with international terrorism whatever that means
[1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:15.400]  in the president's head so we have both the usurpation of war the usurpation over the
[1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:20.360]  right to decide life or death the president has authority to detain any american citizen
[1:27:20.360 --> 1:27:25.960]  that's long time obey or elsewhere no accusation or charge just if he says you're associated with
[1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:33.560]  some group connected with al-qaeda uh to repeat what i learned too earlier about the surveillance
[1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:39.560]  state we have the national security agency one headed by someone who without review by the
[1:27:39.560 --> 1:27:45.800]  president uh knowingly and purposely lied to senator ron why it would be preposterously lie
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:53.240]  that uh saying denying the nsa was collecting data on millions of america open and notorious lie
[1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:58.360]  uh i was on the iran counter committee and there were people in the executive branch who went to
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:04.520]  prison for misdating uh making false representations about funding the nicaraguan resistance or
[1:28:05.080 --> 1:28:10.840]  arms shipment to iran they went to prison we have somebody mr clapper who's actually promoted uh
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:15.880]  for lying to congress that's right in fact poindexter did a lot less than clapper clapper ball face
[1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:20.760]  lied in the committee and got caught and has not gotten in trouble and that's such the precedent
[1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:26.520]  doesn't it to now get away with even more they turned that the president say these are principles
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:31.880]  all that i think they they lie around like loaded weapons ready to be used by any occupant any
[1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:38.440]  executive branch that claims any preposterous excuse so we also have uh now the idea uh alex
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:44.760]  of treaties to sort of become uh antiquated and reformally we need to treat ease for nato
[1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:50.600]  trees for the japanese defense treaty or south korea we needed trees even to regulate migratory
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:57.160]  birds now the president by executive order which means unilaterally uh pledges 10 20 30 more years
[1:28:57.160 --> 1:29:02.680]  of military commitment in afghanistan or iraq or elsewhere so we no longer have the treaty
[1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:09.240]  checked on these uh adventures abroad by the president which end up having men and women
[1:29:09.240 --> 1:29:15.160]  courageous uh killed die for nothing at extravagant expense and typically end up with some kind of
[1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:21.480]  blowback uh right now for example we already see that in syria this army the unilateral effort
[1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:26.600]  the so-called armed the dissident uh looks like we're end up with a jihadi state that's indistinguishable
[1:29:26.600 --> 1:29:31.080]  from alaban and afghanistan roose stay there we've got a final segment with you when you come back

[1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:19.240]  oh the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  lay down his sweet head all right that's going to make the atheist and socialist over at the
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:32.760]  lighthouse angry but we are playing christmas music here i never really done this in the
[1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:37.800]  past at christmas but it upsets them so much and they want to restrict it and pull down christmas
[1:33:37.800 --> 1:33:43.240]  trees and stuff then we better do it russ fein constitutional lawyer advisor to ron paul a
[1:33:43.240 --> 1:33:47.480]  former federal official who helped get rid of the fairness doctrine and restore the first
[1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:53.960]  amendment to a great extent just amazing things he's done he's breaking down all the usurpations
[1:33:53.960 --> 1:33:58.840]  of what obama's done and sure other presidents have done some of this but now there's no way
[1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:02.840]  to chronicle at all but it's got to be double what other presidents have done it seems like the
[1:34:02.840 --> 1:34:08.360]  bottom is falling out so if he doesn't get in trouble or if this isn't reversed what comes out of
[1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:13.400]  that the bureaucracy is hungry for more power the republican leadership is hungry for more power
[1:34:13.400 --> 1:34:20.680]  they're going after ran paul and ted cruise who dare you know have sanity and so bruce continuing
[1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:27.400]  with what obama's doing and where it's all going and how we counter it well the the fastest that's
[1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:32.200]  been a one-way trajectory through both the republicans and democratic white house is it
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:38.920]  true that under obama sort of reached its peak uh with regard to the level of one branch government
[1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:45.080]  i mean president goes on for example with their absurd obama care malfunctions and any by press
[1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:50.280]  conference the amendment you know the statute says well you don't need to have insurance this day
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:54.680]  and unilaterally decides that you don't have to enforce the immigration laws if you're within
[1:34:54.680 --> 1:35:00.760]  x y and z and the criminal laws get uh changed unilaterally by the president going on a press
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:05.400]  conference i mean oh didn't he read when he was at harvard law school like me that you actually
[1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:10.280]  have to have a congressional statute to amend the laws the house and the senate the president get
[1:35:10.280 --> 1:35:16.520]  involved uh these are flagrant violations of his duty to faithfully execute the laws and indeed
[1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:21.240]  that clause was written into the constitution because british monarchs suspended refused to
[1:35:21.240 --> 1:35:26.920]  enforce laws enacted by parliament initially those directed at catholic and here we have a president
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:32.520]  whose earmark is deciding he doesn't like a law he'll just decide not to enforce it however he
[1:35:32.520 --> 1:35:39.080]  wishes that's a combination of what we've disclosed in my service on the presidential pass force on
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:43.240]  presidential signing statements the president signs a bill and says all right i'll enforce the parts
[1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:48.120]  i like and the parts that i think are a little extravagant or i think are unconstitutional i
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:56.920]  simply won't enforce uh and the only way that this trajectory is going to be halted is american
[1:35:56.920 --> 1:36:02.440]  people pressuring congress to do their duty they've got to insist that the remedy if the president
[1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:06.920]  doesn't halt it and i understand people get worried about the eyeword that's impeachable
[1:36:06.920 --> 1:36:12.040]  offense if you do not take care of the laws be faithfully executed you are usurping the powers
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:17.560]  of congress the eye is involved in the articles and impeachment uh drafted by the house judiciary
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:23.000]  committee against president richard nixon this is 1974 and they use words like you know
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:27.880]  taylor to faithfully execute the laws uh was a foundation for an impeachable offense bruce let
[1:36:27.880 --> 1:36:32.200]  me ask you this question and and then continue with your line of uh logical breakdown here
[1:36:32.760 --> 1:36:38.840]  and where it's going and we don't reverse it and we've only covered a few of these dictatorial
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:43.480]  rule by press conference where he doesn't even put out an executive order as you just pointed out now
[1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:48.040]  which is obviously out of control and can't amend law now that he just speaks like
[1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:54.840]  i guess the pope x catheter i think they call it from the royal seat uh you know they're at
[1:36:54.840 --> 1:37:00.840]  st peters basilica but we don't have an emperor we don't have a religious leader obama is not our
[1:37:00.840 --> 1:37:05.800]  religious leader my biggest issue and i'm no lawyer but explain to me what this is in law
[1:37:05.800 --> 1:37:11.160]  i know that if a law is not equally applied it's a fraud how can he give waivers for obama care
[1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:15.800]  to just his friends how can he give waivers to general electric to not shut down their cold
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:21.880]  power plants but shut down others to me that's the ultimate form of illegal takings uh of
[1:37:21.880 --> 1:37:28.600]  discrimination of economic warfare and no one's even discussing that angle isn't that really the
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:34.760]  biggest abhorrence here to everybody uh is one i don't know whether i'd rank it they're very
[1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:40.920]  top they're a lot of candidates for that notoriety but certainly that's what i explained was the duty
[1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:46.200]  to faithfully execute the laws and faithfully execute them means to apply them even handsomely
[1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:51.960]  in fact one of the greatest checks the founding fathers undisturbed against abuses were the
[1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:56.440]  requirement that the law be applied equally to everyone so if it applies to your enemies you've
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:38:02.040]  got to apply to your friends that's a huge check on government abuse and when you're permits you
[1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:07.800]  know collective application you're just inviting some kind of tyranny it was warned about 70 years
[1:38:07.800 --> 1:38:13.000]  ago by then attorney general robert jackson that we've now got so many laws on the books
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:18.520]  that the real danger we confront is having prosecutors or executive officials find an
[1:38:18.520 --> 1:38:23.640]  offender and then pin an offense on them rather than find an offense and then we'll go looking for
[1:38:23.640 --> 1:38:29.000]  the culprit and that's what we end up with personalized justice that we associate with
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:34.680]  russia or china rather than blind justice that we associate with the supreme court and the
[1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:40.760]  statute of justice then indeed the united states constitution itself but what you pointed out is
[1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:47.160]  simply another reason why we need to shrink this lilies and state get back into a situation where
[1:38:47.160 --> 1:38:52.200]  liberty is the rule rather than the exception uh and then we don't permit the government then to
[1:38:52.200 --> 1:39:00.760]  use as a bludgeon to help sure sure but i'm asking you as a student to the teacher what is it where
[1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:06.040]  you shut down your competition and then only you're allowed to operate from me that's open rack
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:14.760]  of tearing open mafia tactics beyond communist or even fascist it's purely criminal what i see
[1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:20.600]  obama doing across the board well let's say the theory of laws is called selective prosecution
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:25.000]  or selective application of the law based upon an invidious element it could be racial
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:30.040]  it could be religious or it could be no political as you know as as you're pointing out but that's
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:35.240]  what it's a selective rather than an even handed enforcement of the law that violates our basic
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:41.400]  concepts of due process and equal protection and what do you do in the face of that where is this
[1:39:41.400 --> 1:39:46.200]  all going if we don't turn it around if you look at the way civilizations rise and fall yes i have
[1:39:46.200 --> 1:39:53.560]  and i i feel i alex we have a 20 to 30 years before we have complete one branch government rule
[1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:59.640]  by decree you know we have presidential encyclicals i guess instead of papal encyclicals we have we
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:05.160]  have 20 to 30 years if we don't turn this around and it's clear that it's going to turn around only
[1:40:05.160 --> 1:40:11.560]  if you and me we the people stand up in protest we should refuse to support anybody running for
[1:40:11.560 --> 1:40:17.320]  congress who doesn't make an open pledge to teach the president a president who violates the duty
[1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:21.800]  to faithfully execute the laws who served the war power who kills american citizens without due
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:27.800]  process that ought to be a pledge every candidate for congress ought to be forced to take in order
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:32.280]  to win your support because otherwise they end up being wallpaper you know they're just spectators
[1:40:32.280 --> 1:40:37.640]  as the president does all the significant things which is where we are today and the constitution
[1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:43.480]  is in dire danger precisely because of that complication and you wrote your latest book
[1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:48.920]  just a couple years ago we'll put it on uh screen for folks out there american empire before the fall
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:56.280]  and i've read it and now exactly what you said in the book is now degenerating quickly i know
[1:40:56.280 --> 1:41:01.480]  you're being conservative saying 20 years and empires do take sometimes hundreds of years to
[1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:06.040]  die but the way things are accelerated with technology and how small the world is now
[1:41:06.040 --> 1:41:11.160]  uh my gut tells me we're going to get into a pickle in four or five years or 10 years i mean
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:15.720]  this is well we could well we could because there are all sorts of events that we definitely can't
[1:41:15.720 --> 1:41:22.280]  foresee with positions that could accelerate it so i'd say you know 20 or 30 years that obviously
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:28.040]  assumes that there isn't any some kind of particular cataclysmic event because i believe
[1:41:28.040 --> 1:41:34.280]  alec that if we had somebody in the white who wanted to today go on television this evening
[1:41:34.280 --> 1:41:39.160]  and say ladies and gentlemen i've suspended the constitution and definitely to make you safe and
[1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:45.000]  make you wealthy the congress is frozen it doesn't work anymore the dangers abroad are too acute to
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:50.840]  tolerate the slowness of the constitution i believe the president today who did that including obama
[1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:55.080]  would get away with it the congress would not impeach and right now the american people are
[1:41:55.080 --> 1:42:00.280]  too sheep like to stand up and protest that no you have returned ourselves to the days of
[1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:05.240]  things george the third you can't this is not tolerable that is how far i believe our political
[1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:10.840]  culture has decayed unfortunately ron paul agrees with you i agree with you every learned person
[1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:19.160]  that studies this it's as obvious as the nose on my face or your face and you see obama saying
[1:42:19.160 --> 1:42:24.200]  five years ago i can't do that congress has got to be there hundreds of times and then well i'd
[1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:30.920]  like to bypass him but i can't and now oh i'm going to bypass him to keep you safe and fix things
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:36.200]  and then and then his own law that he helped write he then says i'm going to become a dictator
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:41.800]  basically and selectively enforce what i want to make it work they have created the crisis
[1:42:41.800 --> 1:42:48.680]  they're not letting it go to waste and so we are here seeing them set the table for a near future
[1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:55.400]  crisis be it collapse financial problems war to claim congress is broken and doesn't work so what do
[1:42:55.400 --> 1:43:03.720]  we bruce fine do about that right now i think it's become politically active and insist that
[1:43:03.720 --> 1:43:10.280]  congress is really institutionally the branch that's entrusted to rectify the problem because the
[1:43:10.280 --> 1:43:15.560]  only ultimate check on the president is impeachment and removal from office because they're not a safe
[1:43:15.560 --> 1:43:21.000]  steward of our liberty and that means you've got to be concerned about your member of congress and
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:25.400]  you need to watch and write letters and say you're not going to vote you will not support a member
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:31.240]  who doesn't protect our liberties and freedom from a oppression by the effective branch otherwise
[1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:38.040]  you know the the system is broken and we will go the way of all prior 73 empires and destroy ourselves
[1:43:38.040 --> 1:43:45.000]  we won't we won't be destroyed from external forces it'll be a ruination in tyranny self-imposed
[1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:54.440]  now if you look at that historically normally as you know or if you disagree tell me mr fine
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  that when tyranny's come in people don't usually see it until it's already there
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:04.520]  and until it's collapsing and then the rats all abandon the ship we have a chance with our republic
[1:44:04.520 --> 1:44:09.960]  our history with all the people that have warned us like yourself and dr paul to try to overt repeating
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:16.280]  history but i mean i think we can say the executive has become dictatorial a dictatorship
[1:44:16.280 --> 1:44:21.400]  obama may leave but the power structure wants that dictatorial control and they're playing with
[1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:30.040]  with fire to say the least and i i do see some good signs though where people said no to the
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:35.800]  syria expansion we're saying no to more gun control we see the states rallying what do you
[1:44:35.800 --> 1:44:42.040]  think about uh getting the states to rally and send public petitions or to use their bully pulpits
[1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:47.720]  to expose this there's no doubt those in city council state governor governor tutorial proclamation
[1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:52.840]  state legislatures passing resolutions hard from back to the precedent of the kondakian
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:58.680]  virginia resolution authored by james madison and thomas devison protesting the user patience
[1:44:58.680 --> 1:45:04.280]  and suppression of speech by the alien tradition acts of 1798 so that's a that's a time-honored
[1:45:04.280 --> 1:45:09.400]  way in which we can protest officially and that should be every single state of the union should
[1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:14.360]  be doing this we don't want this and the other way to protest against the surveillance state no
[1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:20.600]  we'd rather be free and have liberty rather than have you gather every no concranny of information
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:25.320]  about me that could be abused for political purposes all these public statements are critical
[1:45:25.320 --> 1:45:30.520]  we have to be engaged and you're absolutely right typically here needs to come by interest not in
[1:45:30.520 --> 1:45:37.560]  one fell swoop and where we see every day of more and more encroachment and what is equally appalling
[1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:42.680]  is that when we end up with presidential candidates you know the last race between romney and and
[1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:49.160]  obama neither neither of them were saying anything about well i presently too big to both parties
[1:45:49.160 --> 1:45:54.600]  were equally complicit and i say that's one of the things that we have got to accept is if neither
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:46:00.440]  party stands up and rolls back the executive tyranny that we need a new party neither of them
[1:46:00.440 --> 1:46:05.320]  can be trusted but keeping the republic alive well i think everyone out there should buy your book
[1:46:05.880 --> 1:46:12.280]  and they should send your book on the collapse and death of empires to their state legislatures
[1:46:12.280 --> 1:46:19.160]  to congress but when i look at congress on c span they know what they're doing we see the
[1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:25.640]  states responding saying this is tyranny we need to block this federal power grab but i don't see
[1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:31.880]  that happening in congress and i see them circling the wagons against the sane people you know the
[1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:36.840]  few people that are there like walter jones and ran paul and ted cruise and others i do see a big
[1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:43.240]  crop of libertarians getting in there on the shoulders of ron paul and others but it really
[1:46:43.240 --> 1:46:48.120]  freaks me out to see the power structure not even wanting checks and balances because even a wise
[1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:54.120]  party would want to have a velvet glove i don't know why the establishment wants to lose its
[1:46:54.120 --> 1:46:59.960]  soft power and i'm not even endorsing evil here i'm just saying i'd rather have a boss hog
[1:46:59.960 --> 1:47:08.280]  who doesn't wreck the whole show than than than just the wild eyed imperial imperious nature what
[1:47:08.280 --> 1:47:13.800]  can you say being up in dc and working around this for so many years about the the spirit
[1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:20.200]  and the behavior of the leadership of both parties because because they really seem to think
[1:47:20.200 --> 1:47:24.760]  their armored vehicles and their billions of bullets and their black uniformed federalized
[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:31.320]  police are a power that is unstoppable and i i don't think they're in control of themselves
[1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:36.680]  is what i'm saying i think they're the great danger to themselves well they are now leadership
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:43.080]  is the euphemism because i call them the invertebrate um uh species as they are persons who lack
[1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:49.160]  conviction who go along to get along and are infatuated with themselves their megalomaniacs
[1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:54.440]  egomaniacs are exceedingly vain and they don't want accountability for anything and that's why
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:48:00.360]  they just push it all the executive branch and then run in the bunker and hide and the fact is
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:06.520]  that they don't like the challenges posed by people like me and you and ron paul and walter
[1:48:06.520 --> 1:48:12.360]  jones and others i mean john vayner denounced people who are suggesting that a bloated 3.7
[1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:18.600]  or 3.8 trillion budget was a cave-in that didn't do anything to rectify the extravagance of the
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:24.680]  federal system that's led us to 17 18 trillion dollars and in the national debt it's really an
[1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:29.720]  obscenity that we will trust upon posterity who will not have gotten any of the luxuries that we
[1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:37.080]  did with all of that spending and what we need is to say is the american people and they showed it
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:43.480]  in theory alex they stood up in theory of 50 000 the ones that know and finally congress then got
[1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:48.920]  the message so historical so so that is the glimmer of hope and on so many fronts the awakening
[1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:56.440]  is happening congress with a six percent approval rating so uh what's your prognosis then i mean
[1:48:56.440 --> 1:49:00.840]  we've got a good chance to turn in the corner if everybody who loves liberty really gets aggressive
[1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:08.040]  yes we can turn the corner and what we have alex that no other prior empire has we have our founding
[1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:13.160]  documents our birth certificate is birth certificate is steeped in liberty it's steeped in checks and
[1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:18.280]  balance it's steeped in small government and the individual at the center of our constitutional
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:24.600]  universe so we have genuine roots that are venerated that we can return to no other empire had that
[1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:32.120]  uh but it's up to us uh to restore the virtues and the values of republic that led to our independence
[1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:38.120]  1776 and these people who argue well that was before the internet that was for globalization
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:42.840]  they don't really understand anything about life because human nature the dna of the species has
[1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:47.880]  been the same for 4 000 years and it always will be the founding fathers understood all of that and
[1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:52.600]  they understood the narrative the motives that cause power to be appeared well and as you know the
[1:49:52.600 --> 1:49:57.240]  declaration of independence bill of rights constitution is the flower of the renaissance
[1:49:57.240 --> 1:50:03.720]  and the flower of thousands of years of common law in europe and a mosaic law and the best systems
[1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:11.080]  and that it's the modern idea it's the best of thousands of years of revolution against tyranny
[1:50:11.080 --> 1:50:16.680]  it's the greatest ideals of freedom it's the modern document what we're going back to is classical
[1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:23.080]  tyranny exactly right one branch government most primitive political societies are all
[1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:28.040]  led by one particular leader it's only the sophisticated mature society that has the idea
[1:50:28.040 --> 1:50:33.480]  of text and balance it we are retrogressing if you will you know so we are going backward
[1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:40.440]  prior 1776 in our political status uh and that is what we have the ability and absolutely

[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:10.040]  to say that um well in order to really break down what these globalists are doing and to
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:16.200]  wake up the average person um we need to really let them know how the subconscious mind actually
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:23.080]  works and how it functions and how the psychological warfare games are being played um one thing you'll
[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:27.880]  hear about that they still do and i think i was saying something about this one time it's called
[2:01:28.440 --> 2:01:32.120]  defining the enemy in order to have a war you have to have an enemy and
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:38.200]  and you have to first demonize the enemy and dehumanize them and nowadays they call it forming
[2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:44.040]  your target market for the group of people you're going to sell to and that's basically the group
[2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:51.080]  of people you're trying to attack but i'll go ahead and sum it up for you today um the war on
[2:01:51.080 --> 2:01:56.360]  terror i feel like it's a modern day equivalent of the salem witch trials if you ask me yeah and they
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:02:01.400]  make everyone the terrorists because you can't find out where they are the war on terror is the war
[2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:06.680]  on the individual by the kleptocratic state exactly and the word conspiracy if you really
[2:02:06.680 --> 2:02:12.200]  want to break it down on greek and latin root word levels um okay the word con and spanish when
[2:02:12.200 --> 2:02:18.440]  you con someone you trick like a conhardy spiracy a derivative of the word spirit conspiracy you
[2:02:18.440 --> 2:02:22.520]  con someone's spirit with a psychological warfare which is what they're really saying is they're
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:28.520]  saying you're in a conspiracy if you don't believe in us you're a heretic well yeah that's because
[2:02:28.520 --> 2:02:33.480]  what they you're exactly right in the way they do that is to convert your belief system and do
[2:02:33.480 --> 2:02:38.040]  a state of perpetual bondage of what the establishment wants you to function as based upon their
[2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:43.560]  social and psychological and engineering games that they play and one of the ways they do it is
[2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:51.880]  well the brain has wavelengths and the way it works is the algorithm of our voices and
[2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:57.880]  sounds that we hear um words thoughts and actions it's all a big equation how it all goes together
[2:02:57.880 --> 2:03:02.520]  that's right and if you're not conscious of the manipulation with the light waves the the the
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:08.920]  cadence is all over they put you into subconscious mode for literal programming as if you're hypnotized
[2:03:08.920 --> 2:03:13.080]  and that's why so much of the public seems like they're hypnotized now and will do anything
[2:03:13.720 --> 2:03:18.280]  and go i like obama care even but triples my prices because they've been programmed that
[2:03:18.280 --> 2:03:22.680]  they're part of the winning team and that they're winning by doing that but if they ever became
[2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:28.120]  conscious they would then be aware of it but see they don't want to become conscious because deep
[2:03:28.120 --> 2:03:32.920]  down even below what's on the surface of their subconscious deeper subconscious knows that
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:37.960]  they're actually losers that are failing and being kind so they project from the subconscious
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:42.280]  through the conscious that you're the one causing the problem because you're telling them
[2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:47.160]  that they're doing something bad or being kind they are projecting on to you and are angry at
[2:03:47.160 --> 2:03:51.960]  the messenger telling them hey your liver is going to fail if you keep drinking a bottle of vodka
[2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:57.160]  every night and they're like shut up and don't tell me what i got to do in my life i'll drink all i
[2:03:57.160 --> 2:04:02.760]  want or you know it's the same thing and and that's exactly what they're doing well yeah
[2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:07.880]  technology is the willing partner in this whole mess because as one of the gentlemen was saying
[2:04:07.880 --> 2:04:12.840]  earlier and as you're saying everybody's zombied out and into a state of subconscious they're all
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:17.960]  too busy looking at their smartphones i mean we live in the third dimension alex um these screen
[2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:23.640]  majors as you know um they're busy staring their whole lives at a screen which is basically a
[2:04:23.640 --> 2:04:27.480]  one-eyed monster that depicts something from a higher image to a lower image and when a mirror
[2:04:27.480 --> 2:04:32.200]  speaks the reflection lies just like in the cult of personality songs and speaking of which they're
[2:04:32.200 --> 2:04:37.000]  trying to redefine every form of human behavior as unsafe and that's what they bring in the police
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:42.440]  state because they have to justify the fact to spy on people and treat us like prisoners and they
[2:04:42.440 --> 2:04:47.480]  know exactly tyranny's always meant the general public criminals show that we can all be enslaved
[2:04:47.480 --> 2:04:51.880]  it's a new form of slavery now that's that's what political correctness is and you've hit the
[2:04:51.880 --> 2:04:57.000]  nail directly on the head great call ryan all right uh brandon and others your calls are coming

[2:05:12.040 --> 2:05:18.120]  else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal
[2:05:18.120 --> 2:05:24.760]  government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on

[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:36.760]  that's right thought criminal music at the bottom of the hour to gebert griffin leaves us and then
[2:08:36.760 --> 2:08:43.800]  we will go to brandon jim christ iona alan and many others who are patiently holding
[2:08:43.800 --> 2:08:49.480]  in a bunch of news on fukushima the economy and a bunch of other issues we have not covered yet
[2:08:49.480 --> 2:08:54.280]  but gebert griffin joins us he is the author of the best-selling book the creature from jackal island
[2:08:54.280 --> 2:09:03.720]  and an expert on the private run for profit federal reserve and on this day in 1913 we got the quote
[2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:10.520]  federal reserve that's neither federal or reserve and we also got an income tax to pay them and some
[2:09:10.520 --> 2:09:15.000]  other things got rid of the senators being elected by the legislature so they'd be federal creatures
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:19.880]  and not state creatures so the real takeover we have to mark one moment of a globalist coup was
[2:09:19.880 --> 2:09:24.680]  1913 but ever since then they've been usurping more and more power so i wanted to get gebert
[2:09:24.680 --> 2:09:28.600]  griffin's take on some other news that ties into this the attacks on free speech what's
[2:09:28.600 --> 2:09:33.960]  happening with the economy but first i wanted to get him to break down what this means to him
[2:09:33.960 --> 2:09:39.880]  a hundred years under this and how far we've come 20 years ago uh almost no one knew it was private
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:44.600]  they laugh at you if you said it was at federal now almost everyone knows it's a sham and that
[2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:48.440]  it's actually they're running thanks to a great extent outside of congress and former head of
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:53.720]  the fellow reserve famously told lair news and i'm or lair news hour that oh no one can
[2:09:53.720 --> 2:09:58.200]  regulate the fed it's above government which of course is a total fraud and now the president says
[2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:03.400]  he's above congress and that the un is above congress so uh the trampling of our rights is
[2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:08.920]  accelerating and uh gee edward thank you for coming on with us and merry christmas well thank you
[2:10:08.920 --> 2:10:15.320]  alex and the same to you uh i like your introductions because you always take all of the burden off
[2:10:15.320 --> 2:10:20.840]  of me you've just about said everything that i wanted to say not about repeating your learned way
[2:10:22.440 --> 2:10:25.800]  well i don't know about that learned part but you know when you think back
[2:10:26.440 --> 2:10:31.400]  on the fact that this uh creature from jackall island the federal reserve system is actually
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:39.560]  a hundred years old it's um it's appalling to me that the nation has survived it uh because as you
[2:10:39.560 --> 2:10:45.560]  pointed out it's a private uh corporation run for profit and that's not so bad i like private
[2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:50.520]  corporations run for profit but i don't like them when they have the power of government behind them
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:55.720]  and they have the power to coerce me to do what they want to do or they send me to prison and
[2:10:55.720 --> 2:11:01.640]  that's basically what we have here we've got a private institution a cartel banking cartel that
[2:11:01.640 --> 2:11:05.880]  went into partnership with the government they took their cartel agreement which was how they
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:09.880]  were going to regulate their own industry to their advantage they took it to congress and
[2:11:09.880 --> 2:11:15.560]  they got those guys in washington dc to pass it into law now can you think of a more of a coup
[2:11:15.560 --> 2:11:21.160]  than that uh they took a cartel agreement now it's law so we have to obey it and i think that that
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:27.000]  has been an effect now for a hundred years and it's just amazing to me that the nation has survived
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:31.640]  well of course now we look back on that we said well it has survived i get we're still here but
[2:11:32.360 --> 2:11:37.800]  as uh scottie would say on star trek he would say captain i don't think we can hold her together
[2:11:37.800 --> 2:11:46.680]  much longer she's coming apart exactly the nation is coming apart and we can see that and so it's
[2:11:46.680 --> 2:11:51.480]  not a very pleasant picture it's not a pretty picture at all but the and the enlightening thing
[2:11:51.480 --> 2:11:56.280]  or the encouraging thing i should say is that people are becoming aware of it now they're
[2:11:56.280 --> 2:12:01.400]  waking up when i wrote my book was back in 1994 i nobody knew anything about the federal reserve
[2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:07.000]  couldn't care less now it's almost a household word it's in everybody's vocabulary maybe not
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:12.440]  quite so sure what it is but they know it's big and they know it's bad they know it's doing bad
[2:12:12.440 --> 2:12:19.320]  things and that's that's a huge first step toward bringing about reform well said in your book the
[2:12:19.320 --> 2:12:25.320]  cruise from jackall island is available at info or store.com to support both of our media organizations
[2:12:25.320 --> 2:12:30.760]  and what we're doing it is so essential for listeners to continue to support the liberty
[2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:39.400]  movement because we couldn't be doing any of this any of this without the general public support
[2:12:39.400 --> 2:12:46.360]  and help and we've come so far we've shot down the expansion of the syria war we have successfully
[2:12:47.320 --> 2:12:54.200]  together exposed the private federal reserve we've we've beaten their latest gun grabs obama care is
[2:12:54.200 --> 2:13:00.680]  incredibly unpopular which is another private tax these very same banksters but more and more
[2:13:00.680 --> 2:13:06.600]  they're just relying on oppressive control but if if the world not just america tyranny versus
[2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:11.720]  liberty humanity and the individual versus the collective establishment if it was a football
[2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:16.280]  game what's the score right now because i feel like we've been down in the game but we've been
[2:13:16.280 --> 2:13:22.280]  rallying scoring touchdowns and we're coming up to a tie very soon if we just keep our spirit
[2:13:22.280 --> 2:13:28.520]  up and go 110 percent well i i like that analogy i i don't know that we're coming that close to a
[2:13:28.520 --> 2:13:33.400]  tie that close to it but we are moving in that direction that's the important thing you know
[2:13:33.400 --> 2:13:38.360]  up until a few years ago i was very depressed about all of this because i thought that the
[2:13:38.360 --> 2:13:43.560]  you know america just didn't care well you know the truth of the matter is most americans uh do
[2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:49.560]  care but they don't understand it enough and they they don't have enough background to to know what
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:55.720]  to do about it and it's always been that way it's probably going to always be that kind of a situation
[2:13:55.720 --> 2:14:02.120]  where a very small group of people really will always run the show and we can complain about
[2:14:02.120 --> 2:14:07.240]  that and you could say well the elites we don't like these elites but the question is who are the
[2:14:07.240 --> 2:14:15.720]  elites going to be when our nation was founded thank god it was a very special elite that stepped up
[2:14:15.720 --> 2:14:20.440]  to the plate and created this magnificent constitution that we had let's face it it was
[2:14:20.440 --> 2:14:25.880]  created by an elite the average american at that time didn't have the education didn't have the
[2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:30.760]  knowledge didn't have the foresight the philosophical background to create a constitution
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:37.720]  like that so the question is not whether or not you know the masses are really capable of taking
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:43.800]  control of their own political destiny the question is which small group is going to become the
[2:14:43.800 --> 2:14:50.120]  leadership group in our society and this is where i'm encouraged because i see that little thin margin
[2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:54.440]  of the population which in my view is always less than three percent that runs the show
[2:14:54.440 --> 2:15:00.040]  it's changing it's changing from the collectivist the cfr cluster you know that center of gravity
[2:15:00.040 --> 2:15:05.640]  and now people like you and myself and and others who are in the forefront of calling for freedom
[2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:10.600]  and understand what that means understand what it means to create freedom and what you have to avoid
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:16.120]  and all that they have a philosophical base for in other words that group is gradually inching its
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:21.560]  ways like the camel getting its nose under the tent it's happening it's happening and that's
[2:15:21.560 --> 2:15:29.080]  very encouraging to me well you're right and again it's always a tiny minority for good or bad that
[2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:34.680]  governs and trailblazes and the establishment knows that that's why they run collectivist
[2:15:34.680 --> 2:15:39.800]  and fascist and control freaks and criminals for office and get them into the police and get them
[2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:45.240]  in as mayor because they crave it those of us that crave liberty and crave the animating contest
[2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:50.920]  of freedom and who crave truly being free and not dominated it's our fault that we've ever
[2:15:50.920 --> 2:15:55.400]  let these lesser scum run things because if you really look at the government types and even the
[2:15:55.400 --> 2:16:01.320]  corporate centralized types they're not that smart they just have an instinct and a will to power
[2:16:01.320 --> 2:16:07.880]  we have to have a will to take control of the power structure to empower humanity and to turn
[2:16:07.880 --> 2:16:13.720]  humanity loose like Bruce Fine who I had on earlier who at the FCC pointed out hey this rule
[2:16:13.720 --> 2:16:17.960]  is dictatorial saying no free speech let's just remove it we didn't we never had the authority
[2:16:17.960 --> 2:16:23.000]  to begin with and then then we had talk radio out of one guy because I've studied it who who made
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:29.880]  a noise at the right time in the mid 80s and again this is an example of how the elite are scared
[2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:35.080]  of protest and an action and free speech and libertarians because they know they're a tiny
[2:16:35.080 --> 2:16:40.760]  group that took over they're scared of us they call us counter revolutionaries because we want to
[2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:47.080]  restore the republic they're trying to restore kleptocratic gang government yeah well you're
[2:16:47.080 --> 2:16:54.360]  quite right and so I think that the collectivist mentality is that you're certainly right no smarter
[2:16:54.360 --> 2:16:59.160]  than anybody else and in some cases I think they they come up short on that side but they're certainly
[2:16:59.160 --> 2:17:04.360]  not stupid and they understand human psychology and I think they understand a bit of history
[2:17:04.360 --> 2:17:09.800]  that most of us in the past missed and that is and you mentioned it is that there are power
[2:17:09.800 --> 2:17:16.120]  centers in society and whoever controls those power centers controls the whole mass of society
[2:17:16.120 --> 2:17:23.000]  it's not done through one person or one committee that dominates the whole nation people belong to
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:27.400]  groups and organizations they belong to political parties labor unions they belong to church
[2:17:27.400 --> 2:17:34.040]  organizations pta's and all this sort of thing they they they follow leaders in other words and
[2:17:34.040 --> 2:17:39.960]  if it's possible and our opponents understood this it is possible to capture control of the
[2:17:39.960 --> 2:17:46.600]  tops of these power centers these organizations with a relatively small number of people if they
[2:17:46.600 --> 2:17:51.160]  know what they're doing and are willing to go out and reach for that power well they've been more
[2:17:51.160 --> 2:17:56.120]  than willing to reach for that power because it fits their mentality they their control freaks
[2:17:56.120 --> 2:18:00.760]  they know that power is necessary to control those of us who don't want to be controlled have always
[2:18:00.760 --> 2:18:06.280]  said oh I don't want to get I get involved in politics politics is dirty I don't like politicians
[2:18:06.280 --> 2:18:11.000]  and we back away from the battlefield we've never been out there to to confront these people they've
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:16.760]  had an easy time of it because of our instincts to stay away from power well all of that has got
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:22.520]  to change and it is changing and thanks a lot to you Alex no my friend it's thanks to all our
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:26.520]  listeners and you and so many others we're in this together I do have a really a lust for liberty
[2:18:26.520 --> 2:18:32.840]  that's not the right word but a real drive to be free and we like free association we want to hang
[2:18:32.840 --> 2:18:37.240]  out with our friends we like people that are successful and artists and and and who've built
[2:18:37.240 --> 2:18:43.560]  their own thing we know how to build our own system we are self-sufficient and so we don't
[2:18:43.560 --> 2:18:48.200]  want to be part of the gang we don't want to go be part of the street gang or the motorcycle
[2:18:48.200 --> 2:18:54.120]  gang or the government gang and so I really think it is gang mentality people versus individuals
[2:18:54.120 --> 2:19:01.560]  so how to loan wolves how do we then collectively come together to counter a collective well we
[2:19:01.560 --> 2:19:07.000]  have to recognize exactly this issue we have to know the difference between collective action
[2:19:07.640 --> 2:19:13.960]  and collectivism people get that confused they think that because you don't want to be part of
[2:19:13.960 --> 2:19:18.680]  collectivism you know that's bad that's the basis of most of the evils and governments around the
[2:19:18.680 --> 2:19:23.800]  world today they think that therefore you you can't cooperate with anybody voluntarily and I've
[2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:28.520]  always answered that by saying just because I'm an individualist doesn't mean I have to move my
[2:19:28.520 --> 2:19:34.600]  piano all alone that there's a difference between collectivism and collect collective action is this
[2:19:35.320 --> 2:19:44.440]  collective action is done voluntarily collectivism is collective action done under the whip you do it
[2:19:44.440 --> 2:19:49.320]  or you go to prison or you die and there's a difference it's the difference between freedom
[2:19:49.320 --> 2:19:56.520]  of choice the difference between freedom and slavery collectivists take they take advantage
[2:19:56.520 --> 2:20:01.240]  of that confusion they think what you exactly done see they they love that confusion well and
[2:20:01.240 --> 2:20:04.760]  that's why I brought it up as you can say it so much more eloquently than I can that's it
[2:20:05.640 --> 2:20:09.480]  individuals think we've got to be totally alone no it's the opposite we have to get past that
[2:20:09.480 --> 2:20:14.280]  instinct to not want to mess with other people and tell other folks that we're right and they're
[2:20:14.280 --> 2:20:20.200]  wrong we've got to do it or the pea brains that lust after power are going to dominate us and so
[2:20:20.200 --> 2:20:26.920]  we've got to go out and find other individuals and through free association resist them at every
[2:20:26.920 --> 2:20:32.840]  front a lot of that is just shopping with made America or local or groups that promote liberty
[2:20:33.480 --> 2:20:38.040]  or using the boycott power which we're doing more and more that's why the collectivists
[2:20:38.040 --> 2:20:44.280]  are always trying to organize their people into the same thing when the truth is they're a minority
[2:20:44.280 --> 2:20:49.320]  when it comes to actual thinkers most of their minions the camp followers do it because of a
[2:20:49.320 --> 2:20:53.560]  perception of power being part of the group or because of some of the largest they get
[2:20:54.920 --> 2:20:59.880]  yes and then there's a herd instinct you know and again our opponents are very wise they've
[2:20:59.880 --> 2:21:07.880]  studied this psychological element of mankind and they know how to use herd instinct and we have
[2:21:07.880 --> 2:21:12.440]  to learn how to use that too it doesn't mean we have to use it against people or deceive them
[2:21:12.440 --> 2:21:17.880]  but we have to recognize that it's real people do like to follow leaders and so we're not going to
[2:21:17.880 --> 2:21:23.880]  change that even even leaders like to follow leaders I've observed this you get a you you go to a
[2:21:23.880 --> 2:21:28.440]  cocktail party and it doesn't take long before you realize that there's one person generally
[2:21:28.440 --> 2:21:33.960]  dominating the room in a cocktail party and if another one shows up and he's a dominant person
[2:21:33.960 --> 2:21:39.480]  or she all of a sudden you got a little contest there between these two dominant ones and then
[2:21:39.480 --> 2:21:45.640]  usually one will back down and yield to the other one you see it in all segments of the animal kingdom
[2:21:45.640 --> 2:21:50.920]  I remember when I was a kid I was a city kid and I fortunately had a couple of summers on
[2:21:50.920 --> 2:21:55.960]  my uncle's farm and one of my chores so-called was to go to bring the cattle in you know and I
[2:21:55.960 --> 2:22:01.560]  noticed at this young age that this cattle always followed the same lead cow it was always the same
[2:22:01.560 --> 2:22:08.520]  lead cow and one day that the lead cow was kept in the barn for a couple of days because it had
[2:22:08.520 --> 2:22:12.760]  an ulcer on the ear and the veterinarian came out and he wanted to isolate the cow and all that
[2:22:12.760 --> 2:22:17.240]  sort of thing so that particular the first day that that particular day that the lead cow wasn't
[2:22:17.240 --> 2:22:22.040]  in the field and the other cows are very very bewildered per minute but it didn't take long
[2:22:22.040 --> 2:22:26.520]  another bestie moved to the front and she became the lead cow for the next two or three days she
[2:22:26.520 --> 2:22:31.400]  was the same lead cow and then when the other one came back where that took over again and I never
[2:22:31.400 --> 2:22:37.000]  really fully understood that lesson until I was much older and I realized well humans are a lot
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:42.760]  like that too and so you can fight it you can be moaned but that's the way it is so it's our
[2:22:42.760 --> 2:22:50.120]  responsibility to provide responsible intelligent leadership for those who want to follow it's
[2:22:50.120 --> 2:22:55.160]  our obligation really to provide that kind of leadership because if we don't our enemies will
[2:22:55.160 --> 2:22:59.560]  and they're going to lead us right into the prison camp I agree and again I don't like going to
[2:22:59.560 --> 2:23:04.200]  cocktail parties for that reason big ones because it's all a big show off fest I like to hang around
[2:23:04.200 --> 2:23:09.720]  with my buddies and then I shut up and hear them all tell jokes and then it comes around to me and
[2:23:09.720 --> 2:23:15.560]  I make a joke and that's what I like I can't you know that's the problem is I want to be alone
[2:23:15.560 --> 2:23:20.120]  or hanging all my wife and kids or with a few buddies fishing or a few buddies you know over
[2:23:20.120 --> 2:23:25.960]  dinner and I just I just don't understand it but but you're absolutely right and that's why the
[2:23:25.960 --> 2:23:30.120]  system when we stand up as individuals is we don't want to be slaves and say hey I'm not your slave
[2:23:30.120 --> 2:23:34.920]  leave me alone they're like how dare you you're bad to try to beat you over the head so all the
[2:23:34.920 --> 2:23:39.480]  other followers see that and think I better not be like that I better not have free speech like
[2:23:39.480 --> 2:23:47.080]  Phil Robinson I better shut up because they are trying to take out any lead cow that tries to get
[2:23:47.080 --> 2:23:53.560]  off the reservation what do you make of the state of the open tyranny of Obama I mean worse than I
[2:23:53.560 --> 2:23:57.480]  thought it would even be and the open attacks on free speech I mean what do you think's really
[2:23:57.480 --> 2:24:04.840]  behind that right now gee ever griffin boy that's a that's a question I'm almost afraid to even think
[2:24:04.840 --> 2:24:12.440]  about and I have avoided it as much as possible because every time I I turn my mind to the question
[2:24:12.440 --> 2:24:18.920]  of motives which is always a dangerous and a hard thing to guess what another person's motives are
[2:24:18.920 --> 2:24:24.280]  I always come up with with the with the bad answer I keep coming up with a very strong
[2:24:24.280 --> 2:24:34.680]  suspicion at least that maybe Obama's mission was to lead the country down I don't and I can't imagine
[2:24:34.680 --> 2:24:41.320]  that just an ideologue somebody who really believed in collectivism somebody who'd been
[2:24:41.320 --> 2:24:46.600]  indoctrinated into communism and surrounded by a bunch of comrades and so forth who really believed
[2:24:46.600 --> 2:24:51.240]  that from each according to his ability to each according to his need in other words an idealist
[2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:58.440]  it's hard for me to accept that an idealist once they're put into the seat of power like Obama is
[2:24:58.440 --> 2:25:05.560]  and they could really see up close and personal that these policies are not working at all in
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:09.640]  fact they're accomplishing just the opposite it's hard for me to imagine that they don't just say
[2:25:09.640 --> 2:25:15.560]  hey I give up I was wrong but no it just keeps going forward and forward and forward and I have
[2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:22.040]  a suspicion that some of the quotations we've heard from Obama in his early days before he even
[2:25:22.040 --> 2:25:28.920]  went into politics that about his animosity toward America his desire to to punish and discipline
[2:25:28.920 --> 2:25:36.200]  America I think I keep thinking is that really his motive his purpose and his mission and I
[2:25:36.200 --> 2:25:41.480]  suspect that it is I agree with you and it's and the folks that run him or like that it was like
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:46.920]  the famous actor Ron Silver reportedly in front of newspaper reporters when Clinton was being sworn
[2:25:46.920 --> 2:25:55.480]  in back in 1993 and they had jets flying over and the average rich Hollywood person didn't get
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:26:00.680]  they were part of the elite didn't get that military work for them didn't and looked at Hillary and
[2:26:00.680 --> 2:26:05.160]  said how dare them fly jets over to threaten us because they knew the average military person
[2:26:05.160 --> 2:26:11.000]  wasn't an elitist you know decadent scumbag and Hillary looked at him and said Ron those are
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:17.400]  our jets now and the thing is is that they're instinct to run us into the ground and really
[2:26:17.400 --> 2:26:22.680]  just do evil things and dominate us they're threatened by the idea that we could bring them
[2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:27.480]  to justice we could take the Federal Reserve out but but if they could just break the country
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:32.280]  like Cloward and Piven if they could just bankrupt us then the whole country could become a giant
[2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:37.720]  re-education camp and then they could build their their utopia and I think that's I think
[2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:44.760]  you put the nail on the head yeah I think that's probably it and we have to go back to the philosophy
[2:26:44.760 --> 2:26:50.440]  of the Fabian socialists you know their their idea and they're still very real by the way
[2:26:50.440 --> 2:26:55.880]  and very dominant and not just in the UK but the Fabian socialist concept was that you had to smash
[2:26:55.880 --> 2:27:01.800]  the earth to bits so that you could remould it rebuild it to your desire they took that famous
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:07.960]  line out of Omar Kayam you know that if if we could smash the earth to bit and then remould it
[2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:14.360]  closest to the heart's desire that was that famous line and and they even had a mural to that effect
[2:27:14.360 --> 2:27:22.360]  a little stained glass mural in their Fabian socialist house there in in England showing
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:28.040]  the early members of the Fabian society with hammers and they're they're striking the earth
[2:27:28.040 --> 2:27:33.160]  which is on an anvil and they're smashing the earth to bits that to illustrate this idea that
[2:27:33.160 --> 2:27:39.640]  if you want to build something new you have to break the old first Lenin said it this way Lenin
[2:27:39.640 --> 2:27:46.440]  said if you want to create an omelette you have to crack a few eggs you know this sort of thing
[2:27:46.440 --> 2:27:51.640]  that's the mentality of all collectivists absolutely and it's really about them playing
[2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:56.200]  God but we see wherever they get control they don't build something back beautiful afterwards
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:28:01.640]  they just wreck everything and then they rule from you know some smoldering north korean command
[2:28:01.640 --> 2:28:06.040]  center in closing what do you want to say about the hundred years the fellow reserve and the
[2:28:06.040 --> 2:28:13.880]  income tax that came with it and where do you think it's going well the first thing that comes
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:18.120]  to mind is we're not going to let it happen for another hundred years but then it couldn't possibly
[2:28:18.120 --> 2:28:24.360]  because it these forces cannot continue that much longer we're coming to a head it's not a hundred
[2:28:24.360 --> 2:28:30.360]  years from now it's either going to be a lot better or a lot worse and i think because of what
[2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:36.760]  we are doing it's going to be a lot better when people become finally aware not only that things
[2:28:36.760 --> 2:28:42.360]  are bad but why they're bad and it's not just the people it's not just people with names although
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:46.680]  that's a part of it you can't ignore it it's what they believe it's what they hold in their minds
[2:28:46.680 --> 2:28:51.000]  it's their philosophy their ideology because if we just think it's people if we just think it's
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:58.680]  republicans or democrats but we just think it's obama or clinton or or uh some republic name anybody
[2:28:58.680 --> 2:29:03.240]  if we think it's that person then we replace them with somebody just like it and we haven't gone
[2:29:03.240 --> 2:29:08.440]  anywhere and so we have to realize it's what they believe and the enemy really of freedom around the
[2:29:08.440 --> 2:29:15.880]  world is called collectivism and that's uh that's our enemy and uh you and i are part of the same
[2:29:15.880 --> 2:29:22.600]  crusade to to destroy collectivism and replace it with individualism and freedom reality zone

[2:33:25.240 --> 2:33:28.920]  have been holding long enough i'm going to go to five or six of you that are on the board
[2:33:29.560 --> 2:33:33.240]  then i'm going to go into the news that i haven't hit on fukushima the economy and more
[2:33:33.240 --> 2:33:37.160]  and that's beautiful music i don't care if you like christmas or not i mean
[2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:41.640]  like star wars music if it was christmas music i'd like it
[2:33:46.840 --> 2:33:50.600]  you know i get more sentimental about christmas as i get older with all the memories of it
[2:33:51.560 --> 2:33:55.800]  and i just pray that my uncle lives and doesn't die he's in east texas i'm gonna get in the car
[2:33:55.800 --> 2:34:01.400]  and go see him after this the doctors have said it's hit and miss and that they didn't think he
[2:34:01.400 --> 2:34:06.680]  would make it yesterday basically then they said he may now he's made a turn back for the better at
[2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:13.320]  least by the time i talked to my dad this morning who's there it's my mother's brother and the only
[2:34:13.320 --> 2:34:18.360]  reason i talk about it is you realize what's really important at christmas especially when you've had
[2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:23.400]  family die as his son did and he took care of him and got whatever this mystery illness is
[2:34:23.400 --> 2:34:31.080]  uh from him so please pray uh for my uncle who goes by biff hammon his name's uh william
[2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:36.440]  forest hammon not the william hammon that was a fake pilot or something i was googling that the
[2:34:36.440 --> 2:34:42.600]  other night and saw some other william hammon uh so it's not that william hammon uh but um

[2:42:53.800 --> 2:42:58.360]  that they said look don't trust anyone in walmart with the state terrorist or everywhere i mean
[2:42:58.360 --> 2:43:03.160]  that's directly out of running man this is directly out of north korea if they had money they do that
[2:43:03.160 --> 2:43:08.120]  i mean this is insane uh now they're coming out with license plates in california that have like
[2:43:08.120 --> 2:43:12.600]  government announcements on them that are digital where it's not always your plate number it's a
[2:43:12.600 --> 2:43:17.560]  digital signal with a transponder and it's just like government ads and messages taken over our
[2:43:17.560 --> 2:43:24.760]  phones taken over radio with obama messages are uh you know digital uh license plates and making
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:30.200]  you pay for them i mean there's no end to what these dirtbags do the sky's the limit they have
[2:43:30.200 --> 2:43:35.160]  unlimited resources off the industrial revolution to literally build a hell pit
[2:43:37.080 --> 2:43:43.640]  and people are like oh yeah all right digital license plates by the way the government employees
[2:43:43.640 --> 2:43:46.840]  aren't going to have those though they're going to have the regular ones and they're exempt from all
[2:43:46.840 --> 2:43:55.800]  the scanners i mean it's just total discrimination uh let's go to uh iona and south carolina thank
[2:43:55.800 --> 2:44:03.000]  you for holding go ahead hi thanks for taking my call um i want you to know that you're the only
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:09.720]  one i listen to now i used to listen to the others but you're a straight shooter you just don't
[2:44:10.440 --> 2:44:14.680]  you don't fool around so thanks for being well thank you listen i'm too tired to think about
[2:44:14.680 --> 2:44:20.920]  what i'm going to say i just say what i believe what i know i know and that's great i gotta tell
[2:44:20.920 --> 2:44:29.800]  you before i talk about ferrican and the duck dynasty guy um in 1975 i was in school in Kansas
[2:44:29.800 --> 2:44:37.080]  and somebody handed me this uh they called it a facsimile back then uh i think it was a moody
[2:44:37.080 --> 2:44:44.840]  newsletter and it talked about the beast and the beast was a three-story computer in belgium
[2:44:44.840 --> 2:44:55.960]  and it they said that it was built or being built to uh hold um an identification for every person
[2:44:55.960 --> 2:45:03.640]  in the world and that was back then and i thought well that can't be because yeah third world countries
[2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:09.400]  they're not going to have you know that can't be true and um then they said they were going to
[2:45:09.400 --> 2:45:16.360]  start with the barcodes like they use now and they were going to see if it works starting in i think
[2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:25.880]  montana and then later on they were going to give people tattoos and the standard tattoo when they
[2:45:25.880 --> 2:45:32.440]  went through the grocery line so i thought well this i don't doubt it's going to happen someday
[2:45:32.440 --> 2:45:42.520]  but back then i you know i thought i not in my lifetime and then obama was elected and when he
[2:45:42.520 --> 2:45:50.920]  was elected there's like this really thick old pressure i felt and i thought oh my god it's
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:58.200]  going to happen in my lifetime so i understand what you were saying earlier today i just wanted
[2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:05.400]  to say that first thank you so much ma'am i really appreciate uh you know you breaking all that down
[2:46:05.400 --> 2:46:10.680]  and going over to here on air and it's just sad to be in the clutches of evil but it's what happens
[2:46:10.680 --> 2:46:17.960]  you know god believes in universal law and the universe you don't believe in god you re put
[2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:23.400]  you so it comes around goes around and for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
[2:46:23.400 --> 2:46:29.960]  you know we're not going to abort 53 million babies here and say they're not humans that
[2:46:29.960 --> 2:46:34.520]  didn't have rights and not have it we're old people that don't have rights or young kids
[2:46:34.520 --> 2:46:39.480]  don't have rights or property owners don't have rights i mean you let weak people get
[2:46:39.480 --> 2:46:44.760]  walked on unborn minorities you name it throughout history what is done to the week
[2:46:45.800 --> 2:46:50.920]  is going to be done to the strong later and if you don't have empathy if we don't have empathy
[2:46:50.920 --> 2:46:55.400]  for a unborn child or for a chicken in a factory farm
[2:46:57.320 --> 2:47:01.240]  we're going to end up having deadly plagues produced in those unnatural factory farms
[2:47:01.240 --> 2:47:05.800]  and it's going to kill us probably by the hundreds of millions and it's the same deal
[2:47:05.800 --> 2:47:10.760]  with abortion i mean it's just like whatever you allow it to happen to other creatures is
[2:47:10.760 --> 2:47:17.240]  going to happen to you or your kids and that's what you call god fearing even if you don't believe
[2:47:17.240 --> 2:47:23.800]  in god say the universal causality the universal laws of nature that when i even think about
[2:47:23.800 --> 2:47:30.280]  doing bad things to people not just my own instincts and my own empathy but i just feel
[2:47:30.280 --> 2:47:37.240]  oh that's scary ooh i don't want to i don't want to do bad things to people because that i wouldn't
[2:47:37.240 --> 2:47:43.880]  want that done to me and that's my connection to everybody else feeling their pain and these
[2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:49.720]  psychopaths they don't feel people's pain oh they'll tell you they feel your pain but they don't
[2:47:49.720 --> 2:47:54.760]  really feel your pain god bless you i appreciate your call great points and jacari jackson's
[2:47:54.760 --> 2:48:01.080]  going to be coming in at the next segment uh to introduce his piece here on air okay let's go ahead
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:09.560]  and talk to jim in texas jim you're on the air go ahead how are you i'm good yeah i just wanted
[2:48:09.560 --> 2:48:14.920]  to call in today because um on december 19th uh they ended up our good old congress ended up
[2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:21.160]  passing in the ndaa which i don't hear any of the mainstream media talking about um indefinite
[2:48:21.160 --> 2:48:26.680]  you know detention of american citizens without trial um might as well be in north korea at this
[2:48:26.680 --> 2:48:32.280]  point so i'm a member of law enforcement i really don't want to get into what type of law enforcement
[2:48:32.280 --> 2:48:36.280]  i'm in at this point but i just want you to know that there are a lot of people out here that do
[2:48:36.280 --> 2:48:42.360]  understand what's going on and um we have a constitutionally took an oath for reason um
[2:48:43.640 --> 2:48:47.880]  and no matter what happens um i think people are going to take as much as they're going to take until
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:52.760]  as things finally break down to the point where people have to act but there are a lot of people
[2:48:52.760 --> 2:48:58.200]  out here that are understanding what's going on and we are in positions where when the right time
[2:48:58.200 --> 2:49:03.080]  comes along the actions have to be taken and um i just hope that there are others out there in
[2:49:03.080 --> 2:49:08.120]  law enforcement and the military that uh think about the oath that they took the promise that we made
[2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:14.680]  uh because it does mean something it certainly does and god bless you and you know that's the
[2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:19.240]  sad thing i know most of the military i talk to are awake more than the public police on average
[2:49:19.240 --> 2:49:23.560]  are more awake to the general public but then we also see a lot of the really bad examples out of
[2:49:23.560 --> 2:49:29.480]  the police because it's the federalization and the globalization but there is a backlash by police
[2:49:29.480 --> 2:49:33.880]  all over the country saying they're not going to enforce unconstitutional gun laws people can
[2:49:33.880 --> 2:49:38.360]  say well you can't pick and choose laws well if a law is unconstitutional and obviously abhorrent
[2:49:38.360 --> 2:49:43.400]  it's not a right it's a duty to say no to it so what percentage of the people you talk to on
[2:49:43.400 --> 2:49:50.760]  average just a you know kind of quick idea what percentage of the folks you're talking to are
[2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:57.800]  starting to wake up that things are not going well oh he hung up he wanted to make a statement and go
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:50:03.400]  all right well i hear you good points that you made there uh alan and others we're going to go to
[2:50:03.400 --> 2:50:07.000]  you after the break after we talked to chicari a little bit of overdrive because you've been holding
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:12.040]  so long i'll go to you and then chris and ed and gerry i'll try to get to all those but chicari
[2:50:12.040 --> 2:50:19.560]  jackson's going to pop in with a walmart connection uh to walmart and and obama care and and i did a
[2:50:19.560 --> 2:50:26.040]  search on this it can find nothing on it except for a article uh that's a walmart installs obama
[2:50:26.040 --> 2:50:33.720]  care rfid chip scanning health machines that's pretty crazy but that's not the angle that chicari's
[2:50:33.720 --> 2:50:41.400]  going with so we've done a search it can find nothing about uh walmart obama care kiosk so but
[2:50:41.400 --> 2:50:49.080]  we have a reporter i believe is breaking uh news then uh on the other side of this quick break

[2:54:16.760 --> 2:54:22.920]  itself is promoting these new obama care kiosk and the headline in the video just went up on
[2:54:22.920 --> 2:54:29.080]  info wars dot com if you want to be able to go look at it and see the video for yourself creepy
[2:54:29.080 --> 2:54:37.000]  obama care pod found in walmart and that is from kiosk marketplace uh with a walmart press release
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:43.640]  when this first broke yesterday and now we've got a video for you uh briefly introducing it jacari
[2:54:43.640 --> 2:54:50.120]  jackson all this report about the kiosk at walmart i went to go check it out myself because i heard
[2:54:50.120 --> 2:54:55.560]  they had rfid's uh in the original report so i went to check it out i didn't find any rfid's but i
[2:54:55.560 --> 2:55:00.040]  did find some other very interesting aspects about these obama care pods i think they're saying it
[2:55:00.040 --> 2:55:05.480]  can read rfid and a lot of the new credit cards have those yes you know i couldn't confirm that
[2:55:05.480 --> 2:55:09.960]  because i didn't have anything to scan with uh under the scanner but it did have some type of scanner
[2:55:10.920 --> 2:55:17.640]  amazing here's jacari jackson's report for the walmart but what i do is to get a story
[2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:26.680]  so i got a tip that at walmart they have rfid scanning obama care kiosk so i'm going to go
[2:55:26.680 --> 2:55:32.040]  inside this walmart imbueded texas to find out if that is the case and also see what the process is
[2:55:32.040 --> 2:55:37.880]  to actually sign up for obama care the affordable care act also known as obama care was passed in
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:43.240]  2010 and the law makes health insurance available to more people with the hope that they were able
[2:55:43.240 --> 2:55:49.560]  to get the care they need please place your left arm into the blood pressure puff the blood pressure
[2:55:49.560 --> 2:55:57.560]  puff is starting the blood pressure puff will tighten around your arms please answer the question
[2:56:03.240 --> 2:56:09.400]  we will now begin the weight and body mass evaluation please place your feet on the foot rest
[2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:15.240]  as shown in the video so i just finished my health care assessment at the obama care kiosk
[2:56:15.240 --> 2:56:21.000]  to be very clear i did not sign up for obama care i went to test out the kiosk i did use my height
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:25.560]  and weight and so forth to get the health assessment but i did not sign up for obama care
[2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:30.440]  and i'm not suggesting that you do either first of all that thing does have some type of scanner
[2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:36.920]  but i cannot confirm that it's for rfid as far as my health care assessment itself the kiosk and all
[2:56:36.920 --> 2:56:42.280]  of its infinite wisdom told me that even though i'm age 27 and i jog three miles a day before
[2:56:42.280 --> 2:56:48.840]  i go into work that i am overweight possibly even obese also that i'm at high risk for hypertension
[2:56:48.840 --> 2:56:53.640]  now i'll talk about the overweight aspect for a moment and it also had other options you could
[2:56:53.640 --> 2:56:58.600]  check your eyes and other things as well i didn't want to give the ns my breakfast so i opted out
[2:56:58.600 --> 2:57:04.120]  of that one no you know when you go to these machines or i guess any doctor now they do these
[2:57:04.120 --> 2:57:11.000]  type of body mask index of bmi and i knew this was bull since i was in high school because back in
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  high school they were trying to tell me that i was obese pretty much as on paper because i weighed
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:21.080]  more than i supposed to even though me and a lot of the other guys who played sports and so on we
[2:57:21.080 --> 2:57:24.920]  worked out twice a day you know we you know we're 20 pounds overweight because we walk around with
[2:57:24.920 --> 2:57:30.120]  so much muscle we looked like the guys from gears of war and so keep that in mind when you go to
[2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:34.360]  these machines it's going to tell you you're fat or you're whatever and you may have some weight
[2:57:34.360 --> 2:57:38.600]  issues or whatnot but take that with a grain of salt and think about you know this stuff is
[2:57:38.600 --> 2:57:42.360]  sure that i don't even want this big body that's all policy that if you're a certain age a certain
[2:57:42.360 --> 2:57:47.880]  height you need to be x weight you know it doesn't take an account you know muscle mask or muscle
[2:57:47.880 --> 2:57:52.600]  master things such as that so if you're interested in finding one of these obama care machines maybe
[2:57:52.600 --> 2:57:57.720]  even shooting your own video you can go to solohealth.com or dot gov or whatever it is shoot

[2:58:02.920 --> 2:58:07.560]  telling you to sign up for obama care i'm just saying if you guys are interested in a joke and a
[2:58:07.560 --> 2:58:13.160]  laugh you can go check out these machines you can find more reports at info wars dot com all right

[3:00:57.880 --> 3:01:04.840]  california uh you're on the air go ahead hi alex i'm gonna cut to the chase i'm kind of concerned
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:10.120]  about this chinese situation let me tell you we've built china has built up their modern military with
[3:01:10.120 --> 3:01:15.320]  the help of the assistance of the u.s and in a short time that defies all logic you know we've
[3:01:15.320 --> 3:01:19.960]  given them all the technology to move missiles into the playgrounds of our children we've given them
[3:01:19.960 --> 3:01:25.320]  a fighter technology uh targeting technology they've laundered it through different giving it to
[3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:30.680]  different countries and then they send it to china in the same time span we whittled down our military
[3:01:30.680 --> 3:01:37.240]  to a shell of itself uh they do what they talk about uh replacing like the f-15 the f-16 fighters
[3:01:37.240 --> 3:01:42.120]  with expensive fighters like the f-22 and f-35 that never even they haven't even filled the ranks
[3:01:42.120 --> 3:01:47.640]  with them so we basically have what people don't understand this is our military is nothing what
[3:01:47.640 --> 3:01:53.000]  they think it is you know we're we look big beating up on people that are carrying an ak-47 and
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:56.760]  we're going at them with drones but the weapons that we've been developing are for urban control
[3:01:56.760 --> 3:02:02.040]  they aren't for fighting a strategic war no no we've been developing on record a un global
[3:02:02.040 --> 3:02:08.920]  domestic suppression army for the global government to suppress domestic uprisings and mount type
[3:02:08.920 --> 3:02:14.600]  environments it's not to fight a superpower we have been sold out that's what all the top
[3:02:14.600 --> 3:02:20.760]  retired generals say i'm telling you that's the reason folks this is not a game and so what i'm
[3:02:20.760 --> 3:02:27.000]  saying is that's what i mean what i mean by what ultimately i think their contingency plan is
[3:02:27.640 --> 3:02:32.600]  is they're going to foment a phony war with china it's all planned and then it's going to get to
[3:02:32.600 --> 3:02:36.200]  the point where we're going to say we just can't take them on because we aren't going to have any
[3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:41.560]  of our allies backing us up the world hates us and then we're going to capitulate and then china's
[3:02:41.560 --> 3:02:46.200]  going to come in and occupy us and that's going to solve all these problems and all that is no no
[3:02:46.200 --> 3:02:51.080]  that is admittedly with henry kissinger one of the plans on the drawing board and the communist
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:56.680]  have been offered that and you're absolutely right they're building the super highways down to baha
[3:02:56.680 --> 3:03:03.240]  and out to southern california southern mexico on record to bring in the foreign army and split
[3:03:03.240 --> 3:03:10.680]  the country in tube oh man i tell you that's in the n l e o nine uh fema documents that are public
[3:03:10.680 --> 3:03:16.120]  i just can't believe how screwed this country is if the the average cop strutting around in camo
[3:03:16.120 --> 3:03:20.520]  bugging their eyes out at the public who's bought into all this has no idea how they've been sold
[3:03:20.520 --> 3:03:24.600]  out too but it's a science fiction movie i don't blame people not believing it i mean it's it's a
[3:03:24.600 --> 3:03:34.600]  god bless you uh let's go ahead and talk to jack listing on 1340 go ahead i i just wanted to say
[3:03:34.600 --> 3:03:43.160]  that you have a worldwide platform for reaching people as a out-of-the-box christian uh you know
[3:03:43.160 --> 3:03:52.200]  you're you're going to have eternal uh fruit and reward and blessings on uh many souls will be
[3:03:52.200 --> 3:04:00.200]  reached through your bold stance as a christian that's when i encourage you uh that uh keep it up
[3:04:00.200 --> 3:04:07.160]  i love your passion and uh i love the it's a kind of a spirit of john the baptist um fighting tyranny
[3:04:07.160 --> 3:04:13.720]  and speaking out against the evil and you got the right understanding of roman 13 well god bless
[3:04:13.720 --> 3:04:17.320]  you sir i'm trying to be the best i can but it's not about me and i appreciate your call and god
[3:04:17.320 --> 3:04:22.680]  bless you have a great christmas but i do not like evil and i do not like enslavement and i do not
[3:04:22.680 --> 3:04:28.120]  like the spirit of this world i'll tell you that right now and i am eternally set against it and
[3:04:28.120 --> 3:04:34.120]  i just feel like dirty rags in the presence of uh my creator and my savior that could feel god's
[3:04:34.120 --> 3:04:40.920]  presence and i just that's why anybody who who has spiritual discernment feels like a dirty rag
[3:04:40.920 --> 3:04:45.560]  because you can you're in the presence of such goodness but then you look at the evil and it's
[3:04:45.560 --> 3:04:52.280]  another it's just like oh my gosh how can they be doing this because all those sins they tell us
[3:04:52.280 --> 3:04:56.520]  about the little ones i'm not saying they're they're they're good but that's to make us feel guilty
[3:04:56.520 --> 3:04:59.960]  and bad so the evil can just take over
