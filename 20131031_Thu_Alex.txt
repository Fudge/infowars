[00:00.000 --> 00:14.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.280 --> 00:40.800]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones have you been wondering
[00:40.800 --> 00:45.640]  how frightening the future is going to be post-singularity while a new protranshumanism
[00:45.640 --> 00:51.520]  TV show hopes to sell you on the idea of a world filled with robots almost human takes
[00:51.520 --> 00:57.880]  place in 2048 LA where detectives are forced to partner with synthetic combat ready androids
[00:57.880 --> 01:02.080]  the droids have a strictly rule based sense of reason which is of course a trait that's
[01:02.080 --> 01:07.480]  perfect for combat and controlling the useless herd but after their strict robo logic botches
[01:07.480 --> 01:13.360]  a raid detective John Kennecks destroys his partner and is reassigned to Dorian Dorian
[01:13.360 --> 01:17.480]  is a different kind of robot an older model that was decommissioned when their human
[01:17.480 --> 01:23.080]  like qualities began to interfere with their purpose and since Dorian is such a likable
[01:23.080 --> 01:28.280]  robot it's forces the audience to consider what does it really mean to be human I can't
[01:28.280 --> 01:34.280]  say that I was born I was made to feel and I do as much as you don't think a robot with
[01:34.280 --> 01:39.600]  human like qualities is possible while Google futurist Ray Kurzweil says this is probably
[01:39.600 --> 01:44.120]  going to happen before the end of the century we're going to become increasingly non biological
[01:44.120 --> 01:49.680]  to the point where the non biological part predominates in the biological part is not
[01:49.680 --> 01:54.760]  that important anymore in fact the non biological part the machine part will be so powerful
[01:54.760 --> 02:00.080]  it can completely model and understand the biological part so even if that biological
[02:00.080 --> 02:05.160]  part went away it wouldn't make any difference because it the non biological part already
[02:05.160 --> 02:09.800]  understood it completely Kurzweil also predicts that humans will be uploading their brains
[02:09.800 --> 02:16.360]  to computers by 2045 however when Kurzweil talks about we he's not talking about you
[02:16.360 --> 02:22.240]  or I he's talking about the 1% he admits in his book such technology will not be available
[02:22.240 --> 02:26.360]  to the general public and instead will be controlled by a technocratic elite who will
[02:26.360 --> 02:31.160]  attempt to become super beings by merging with machines this dystopic future will see
[02:31.160 --> 02:36.120]  the mass of humanity trapped in their limited organic bodies while the elite will become
[02:36.120 --> 02:42.040]  vastly more intelligent due to cybernetic brain interface upgrades people involved in unskilled
[02:42.040 --> 02:46.880]  labor will become unnecessary when their jobs are replaced by machines inevitably leading
[02:46.880 --> 02:51.520]  to the mass of humanity being seen as worthless parasites by the elite who will either prevent
[02:51.520 --> 02:57.240]  them from reproducing via mass sterilization programs or simply slaughter them outright
[02:57.240 --> 03:02.440]  you think your job is safe well they're even replacing your everyday signs spinner with
[03:02.440 --> 03:10.440]  robotic mannequins but you still don't think the elite are planning to cull the useless
[03:10.440 --> 03:16.640]  herd well in addition to forced vaccinations and GMOs destroying second and third generations
[03:16.640 --> 03:22.480]  schools are now teaching population reduction as a way to save the planet we reported in

[08:31.760 --> 08:38.120]  gay from famous christmas carols because it's faithful even though the word was expropriated
[08:38.120 --> 08:44.960]  from the term meaning happy and there's moves to arrest anyone in england who uses a word
[08:44.960 --> 08:50.920]  faggot because well that's what they call a burning ember or what they call barbecue
[08:50.920 --> 08:56.000]  on my shelf is in a barbecue place in england that was the name of roasted meat a very homophobic
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.840]  and hateful i'm just thankful parents can't pack their children their own lunches and
[08:59.840 --> 09:04.480]  then under federal control we have abortions going on nationwide where babies spend more
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.520]  than 24 hours crying on shelves because legally they're not allowed to kill them once they're
[09:09.520 --> 09:15.360]  outside the womb unless they kill them by exposure but none of that's upsetting life is very
[09:15.360 --> 09:20.160]  cheap unless the globalist decided has value they're very concerned about terrorists killing
[09:20.160 --> 09:24.240]  a couple of us every year that's why they're taking all our liberties away it's not about
[09:24.240 --> 09:32.960]  enslaving us it's not about controlling us well happy all saints eve ladies and gentlemen
[09:32.960 --> 09:40.960]  or of course the holiday overriding the sam hainsaw and rituals going on all over europe
[09:40.960 --> 09:46.880]  right now and again there's a lot of pagans out there who understand are not dark practitioners
[09:46.880 --> 09:51.600]  and worshipers of death and destruction and child sacrifice but you have to understand
[09:51.600 --> 10:01.840]  that this holiday historically is a fact in europe a time when noblemen the wealthy shopkeepers
[10:01.840 --> 10:09.520]  uh folks that owned large herds had to pay homage to the priesthood to show that they had domination
[10:09.520 --> 10:13.840]  over everyone including local kings and sometimes they would demand that the king
[10:14.640 --> 10:20.720]  have his brains be beaten out and then his throat slit and poured over altars or his
[10:20.720 --> 10:26.160]  brains beat out and thrown into a peat bog or his throat slit and thrown into a large
[10:26.160 --> 10:32.240]  bone fire the term we get bonfire from that on record many different ways of doing things or
[10:32.240 --> 10:37.920]  of course putting you in a large wicker burning man and setting you alight uh it was a time for
[10:37.920 --> 10:43.840]  the priesthood to show they were in control of everything and so by the 1950s they overwrote
[10:44.640 --> 10:50.000]  all saints day a time of hiding your house fearing the satanic rituals still being conducted to
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.400]  this day on devil's night as it's known in detroit when they burned down the buildings
[10:54.400 --> 10:58.160]  they overwrote it as fun with pumpkins and everything and your children go out
[10:58.160 --> 11:04.080]  in a druidic simulation and they come as druids would come to the door and demand offerings
[11:05.200 --> 11:10.400]  demand offerings and you show that you're submitting to it and going along with it by
[11:10.400 --> 11:16.000]  lighting a gourd and putting it in front of your door they might demand your horse to be roasted
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.280]  one of the delicacies at that time or they might demand some of your cattle or sometimes
[11:21.280 --> 11:31.360]  they will demand your child but again i'm being closed minded about all this i think it's good
[11:31.360 --> 11:37.360]  that we've reintroduced human sacrifice and 53 million babies have been given to the fires of
[11:37.360 --> 11:42.640]  mollock as leviticus warned always same stuff was going on in the middle east of course in the
[11:42.640 --> 11:46.800]  Mediterranean same stuff was going on in asia same stuff was going on in latin america what is
[11:46.800 --> 11:53.040]  latin america today mezzo america it's just the same thing and now we have all these different
[11:53.600 --> 12:00.000]  top bbc presenters caught with dead bodies of children and necrophilia and satanism jimmy
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.520]  savel and uh then when they start to have trials the people that work for them all start all start
[12:05.520 --> 12:16.640]  dying it all continues on it all goes on all continues but during the middle ages
[12:16.640 --> 12:21.120]  if you wanted to have satanic rituals you would just say you were going after witches
[12:21.120 --> 12:27.040]  while you yourself this is actually in the deep history would actually burn women and men and
[12:27.040 --> 12:33.200]  even children having your satanic ritual while claiming you were a christian which made it even
[12:33.200 --> 12:40.080]  more delicious just like our government says they're fighting al-qaeda while they created it
[12:40.080 --> 12:50.400]  fund it protect it run it full spectrum dominance so that's how this stuff works
[12:56.160 --> 13:05.520]  now ladies and gentlemen we are going to break down how the globalist operate you notice
[13:05.520 --> 13:12.240]  this in latin i forget the term but but there was the denial that witchcraft existed when
[13:12.240 --> 13:18.000]  obviously witchcraft existed all that meant was secret old knowledge some of it dark some of
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.440]  it not dark the point is it all had roots and pre-christian so it's occultic or hidden by its
[13:23.440 --> 13:29.200]  very nature but just as they deny there's a un takeover or deny that there's mercury in the
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.680]  shots we prove there's mercury they say okay it's good for you the devil's greatest trick is
[13:33.680 --> 13:42.800]  convincing you that it doesn't exist but we all know it exists and just as the the desire to kill
[13:42.800 --> 13:47.360]  innocence can manifest through christianity or anything else we have the famous Salem witch
[13:47.360 --> 13:54.400]  trials where you just had a bunch of control freaks wanting to carry out torture so they went out and
[13:54.400 --> 14:00.560]  went after innocent people who were doing nothing wrong so they could carry out their deep human
[14:00.560 --> 14:07.840]  need to engage in human sacrifice in this case crushing women and men with giant boulders lowered
[14:07.840 --> 14:17.840]  on to them by oxen but i now digress i just thought i would give you a little bit of a halloween halloween
[14:19.360 --> 14:25.440]  knowledge and i'm not saying you're satanic and i'm not judging you if your children go around
[14:25.440 --> 14:30.480]  to strangers doors knock on them or a given candy but they are following in the footsteps of thousands
[14:30.480 --> 14:36.960]  of years of druidic priest that is exactly what they're doing and see if you didn't offer them up
[14:36.960 --> 14:41.760]  whatever they wanted people rebelled against it because they weren't trendy pagans no they were
[14:41.760 --> 14:46.960]  sick of giving their cows to the priesthood running around taking hemlock and nightshade
[14:46.960 --> 14:55.760]  and and mistletoe flipping out running around in the countryside drinking blood murdering people
[14:55.760 --> 15:00.720]  and if you rebelled well then your whole family would be burned and i think that's good it's not
[15:00.720 --> 15:08.640]  good to rebel against any tyranny any gang i think it's good to submit to it i'm trendy and just as
[15:08.640 --> 15:11.840]  they came out yesterday and announced they're going to bring back the fairness doctrine and
[15:11.840 --> 15:17.840]  persecute and prosecute all the different media including the internet with these new secret
[15:17.840 --> 15:23.840]  police that go out with these mandatory that aren't really mandatory it's all fraud um questionnaires
[15:23.840 --> 15:27.840]  about what's your politics what are you doing ahead of the open announcements they want to bring back
[15:27.840 --> 15:32.720]  restrictions on free speech that is why now more and more i'm going to implement fairness doctrine
[15:32.720 --> 15:37.600]  here ahead of time i will tell you what i really think about tyranny and then i will add the view
[15:37.600 --> 15:46.480]  of the establishment i think obama care is working great i think 539 percent humana increases in texas
[15:46.480 --> 15:53.680]  on record uh is a affordable care and is the lower price and i think increasing the national debt
[15:53.680 --> 15:58.800]  limit does not increase the debt i agree with obamas quote on that and i agree with him last
[15:58.800 --> 16:04.000]  week saying that it's been an incredible success and is outperforming what they thought and i don't
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.600]  agree with uh you know the facts that it was designed to never work and make it a distraction
[16:09.600 --> 16:15.040]  about the health care site you know the nsa flawlessly has snowed and uh broke down conspiling
[16:15.040 --> 16:19.200]  everything everybody's doing in real time because they've been developing the system for 50 years
[16:19.200 --> 16:24.480]  and integrating all software and all devices to seamlessly integrate through world standardization
[16:24.480 --> 16:30.560]  to be spied on and to track everything in their own words but they can't make a website for you
[16:30.560 --> 16:37.040]  to be able to go and look at a bunch of different health plans which a lot of tech people say is a
[16:37.040 --> 16:42.400]  hard job but nothing compared to the giant spigot of course i and i told you it wasn't going to work
[16:43.360 --> 16:47.840]  i told you it was just going to be a process where oh sorry it's not free the website didn't work
[16:47.840 --> 16:51.360]  but your rates are going to go up and we're going to lower your standard of care that's what the
[16:51.360 --> 16:57.200]  insurance companies wrote that's why their profits doubled the big 10 in the last three years since
[16:57.200 --> 17:02.320]  it passed and are now set to double or more this year alone that's mainstream news but don't worry
[17:02.320 --> 17:09.680]  obama came out today and i've got the quote here and said it's a few bad apples the entire top 10
[17:09.680 --> 17:17.040]  insurance companies have all hammered up their rates and even though obama care tries to take
[17:17.040 --> 17:21.600]  over the states still the states are fighting that's why some states you know you're getting higher
[17:21.600 --> 17:28.480]  increases and others but this is the greatest profit and banker bailout and direct tax to foreign
[17:28.480 --> 17:36.000]  institutions the world has ever seen it is a biblical level fraud just like when the bankers
[17:36.000 --> 17:41.840]  take over argentina or brazil or 100 plus of the third world countries on record they will come in
[17:41.840 --> 17:48.240]  and say we've signed you on to our debt we owe you a billion dollars you now own us 15 20 30 40
[17:48.240 --> 17:53.440]  billion depending on which loan it is you're going to hand over all the water districts all the public
[17:53.440 --> 17:58.880]  power plants all the infrastructure and then they double them and then they double them again over
[17:58.880 --> 18:05.040]  a few years until everything breaks down and then they have a plan i think it's part 111 in the world
[18:05.040 --> 18:13.040]  bank plan that got leaked a few years ago 2002 yeah time went by like dustle dawn i'll tell you life
[18:13.040 --> 18:21.200]  is short folks i guess that was 11 years ago and they said and the best part is when things finally
[18:21.200 --> 18:25.840]  collapse there's rioting the longer it goes the better several years is wonderful total
[18:25.840 --> 18:30.400]  destruction of society and then they come in and everyone begs them for anything they accept police
[18:30.400 --> 18:35.040]  state anything to have a society set back up and you're totally broken and now we're going to go
[18:35.040 --> 18:40.880]  through this and homeland security is standing by as the handcuffs on us as we're strapped down to
[18:40.880 --> 18:47.280]  the gurney and the jeffrey dommer like government is now finally got us chained down and has opened

[24:11.760 --> 24:17.120]  partisan now for the democratic party they have an image of hillary clinton up on their front page
[24:17.120 --> 24:23.840]  today just up there reading a book and i mean what does that mean to have hillary clinton
[24:23.840 --> 24:28.400]  up on the front page of google reading a book all right i'm being sarcastic it's a little too
[24:28.400 --> 24:37.520]  beautiful to be hillary it's actually a green witch uh reading a book oh boy i'll get your guns and
[24:37.520 --> 24:47.280]  your children too my pretties the good news is we are having victories against the scum and they
[24:47.280 --> 24:52.480]  admit there's a stale mate and that the tea party that's constitutional libertarians is blocking
[24:53.120 --> 24:59.760]  totally open borders total restrictions on guns total bankruptcy of the country uh obama said we
[24:59.760 --> 25:04.800]  can never challenge a debt increase again that's just the worst thing to do because that makes our
[25:04.800 --> 25:12.960]  debt go up so just having any common sense any basic americana ideas that's anti-authoritarian
[25:12.960 --> 25:20.080]  tyranny is just the ultimate anathema they failed to take over the tea party the last six years the
[25:20.080 --> 25:24.160]  republicans and the democrats and now they're all coming after it and i know i died robbed on that
[25:24.160 --> 25:36.640]  yesterday it's just that's so central that we get behind every true libertarian constitutional
[25:37.600 --> 25:42.080]  tea party type candidate we can and i think we should have something called the democratic party
[25:42.080 --> 25:47.280]  tea party and have libertarian type folks run because if you look at libertarian ideas when
[25:47.280 --> 25:51.200]  you even pull democrats a lot of them you know those that aren't total socialist they actually
[25:51.200 --> 25:56.240]  click with it we should take over the independent groups the republicans the democrats even if you
[25:56.240 --> 26:00.960]  run for office you're there injecting real ideas and yeah there's a lot of election fraud and but
[26:00.960 --> 26:04.560]  it's not total they don't have total control it's all mixed masks because they're having to hide it
[26:05.120 --> 26:08.080]  and you can get into office and and and then you can have an effect
[26:11.040 --> 26:15.200]  the media the controlled state-run media tries to act like ted cruise and ran paul or
[26:15.200 --> 26:19.920]  yeah they're trying to i see the headlines every day yeah they're trying to explain to the american
[26:19.920 --> 26:25.200]  people why they opposed obama care it's like yeah they're trying to explain to the american people
[26:25.840 --> 26:32.560]  why they were opposed to brain cancer like oh boy they're having some explaining to do
[26:32.560 --> 26:37.760]  instead of like oh they were completely right wow they're heroes now no they have to go against the
[26:37.760 --> 26:44.960]  obvious and hide it in plain view and go oh ted cruise in trouble ted cruise is in big trouble he
[26:44.960 --> 26:50.480]  said obama care wasn't going to work and was a big scam and was really doing rich insurance companies
[26:50.480 --> 26:58.640]  other special interest man was he right i mean wrong i mean he's he's a bad man and and so now
[26:58.640 --> 27:05.760]  they're raising hundreds of millions to go after him and rand paul coming up and i guess this is
[27:05.760 --> 27:10.400]  three or four years from rand's up but the point is they're they're totally worried panicking every
[27:10.400 --> 27:15.120]  time they release a joe biden audio from some millionaire meeting he's having with millionaire
[27:15.120 --> 27:20.560]  contributors or billionaire contributors every time they have a high-level r&c leak you see them
[27:20.560 --> 27:27.200]  every few weeks they are literally freaking out over ted cruise and ran paul because even if
[27:27.200 --> 27:33.760]  they're not perfect they are light years better than nancy polosi and uh harry reid and diane
[27:33.760 --> 27:40.640]  feinstein and the idea of we shouldn't have a seven trillion dollar debt we should probably
[27:40.640 --> 27:45.600]  actually cut some spending including defense and we're going to go bankrupt the bankers want to
[27:45.600 --> 27:50.320]  maneuver us into that they've done that to hundreds of countries that's the plan that's the program
[27:50.320 --> 27:57.840]  and they get up there and say oh that's a terrible idea to not want to raise the debt that the
[27:58.400 --> 28:02.320]  brazing the debt doesn't raise the debt did you forget obama said that can we find that and play
[28:02.320 --> 28:10.480]  that the next segment this is the type of craziness see they need to blame us when they wreck everything
[28:10.480 --> 28:17.200]  and then they'll pose the saviors again but if we're here pointing out they're the authors of this
[28:17.200 --> 28:22.880]  and pointing out how they did this and pointing out that obama care was written by the most
[28:22.880 --> 28:28.720]  corrupt insurance companies to shut down the other smaller regional good folks and health clinics
[28:28.720 --> 28:32.640]  that are outside of the health insurance system that you buy a program with it do a great job
[28:32.640 --> 28:36.800]  they're shutting those down right now they're getting rid of all the real affordable care
[28:36.800 --> 28:40.640]  see anything they say it's the opposite the patriot act is the end of the bill of rights
[28:40.640 --> 28:48.240]  is that patriotic no it's the opposite it's a guillotine for liberty but it's called patriot
[28:48.240 --> 28:53.120]  patriot act new freedom forcibly wants to put half the kids in america on drugs in the next
[28:53.120 --> 28:57.120]  phase for big pharma to control people in their own documents is that a new freedom no it's new
[28:57.120 --> 29:03.840]  slavery they say mercury in improves the behavior of children well yeah they want you brain damaged
[29:03.840 --> 29:09.360]  so of course they use that lawyer trick that's the same thing with this it's affordable care act
[29:10.800 --> 29:16.400]  it's the opposite it's the unaffordable care act it's the death panel act it's the shutdown the
[29:16.400 --> 29:21.920]  regional clinics act it's the shutdown the good insurance companies and regional hmo's it's all
[29:21.920 --> 29:27.360]  being shut down the prices are exploding everywhere my family is in medical management and they're not
[29:27.360 --> 29:33.360]  getting out of it because the profits gone if they go join the democratic party mafia they will
[29:33.360 --> 29:41.520]  be given incredible power to be commas ours over inoculation pill-pushing death panels and of course

[34:32.960 --> 34:39.840]  and others who told you the state is god and will deliver you to valhalla
[34:39.840 --> 34:48.000]  all right folks that is part of our continuing introduction of the fairness doctrine that
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.480]  they're set to phase in under new names being announced by the fcc over the internet you name
[34:52.480 --> 34:57.600]  it no laws needed they're just going to do it by bullying and and and criminal activity op fairness
[34:57.600 --> 35:02.960]  doctrine loving government help so so we're just always not going to say what i believe but then
[35:02.960 --> 35:08.800]  add their propaganda i mean their truth see just double-sided right there so we just had a little
[35:08.800 --> 35:13.680]  announcement by homeland security about how much they love you please go out and get all the shots
[35:13.680 --> 35:17.520]  i think i recommend if you want to see pretty colors go to your local walgreens or walmart
[35:17.520 --> 35:21.840]  get everything they've got you might have a convulsions and die on the way home how fun is
[35:21.840 --> 35:26.960]  that on halloween i mean the insert says may kill you or hey they put you on serotonin reuptake
[35:26.960 --> 35:32.000]  inhibitors and then you want to go shoot up a bunch of people happy halloween i mean you know
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.560]  we've got this culture of death with the fascination with zombies and vampires and everything
[35:36.560 --> 35:42.000]  and the sociologists say it's because people feel desperate and panicked and unhappy and they just
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.680]  hate everyone around them and the pentagon trains the army and the marines to kill masses of u.s
[35:47.680 --> 35:53.120]  citizens but when myself and others videotaped it and documented it they started five years ago
[35:53.120 --> 35:58.880]  calling it zombie drills where they practice mowing down people in farmer outfits that look
[35:58.880 --> 36:05.200]  like your grandpa and uncle jesse from dukes of hazard that's their main enemy folks they've already
[36:05.200 --> 36:09.200]  got control of the cities and but it's okay because they put zombie paint on them so the troops are
[36:09.200 --> 36:14.160]  training to mow america's down in mass and and saying but it's okay because it's zombies that
[36:14.160 --> 36:19.440]  isn't mind control or anything everything's fine on this halloween it's our special halloween broadcast
[36:19.440 --> 36:25.600]  brought to you by well i guess the FCC in the new world order so like i said folks uh trust the
[36:25.600 --> 36:32.720]  government don't read the inserts they tell you in the news that there is absolutely no complications
[36:32.720 --> 36:37.600]  from flu shots now of course that's a total live you read the insert you'll find out it can cause
[36:37.600 --> 36:42.080]  hundreds of neurological disorders and death and autoimmune diseases but don't listen to that
[36:42.080 --> 36:46.800]  they say you will live longer if you take flu shots actually studies show the opposite and
[36:46.800 --> 36:51.840]  doubles your chances of Alzheimer's you had just three flu shots but it's okay ignore all the overall
[36:51.840 --> 36:59.280]  data that were that were that were being killed and just eat jmo drink fluoride take shots worship
[36:59.280 --> 37:06.480]  government come on do it everything's fine sure the nazis had a eugenics plan they were going to
[37:06.480 --> 37:11.280]  take over the entire world and threw poison food and water dump everybody down and reduce their
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.160]  fertility until they got so poisoned incrementally over a three decade plan they would then develop
[37:16.160 --> 37:20.400]  bio weapons to kill the people in the weakened state with the elites having the antidotes it
[37:20.400 --> 37:24.960]  doesn't matter if that came out in the nuremberg trial and was actually adopted as us and british
[37:24.960 --> 37:30.000]  policy it doesn't matter if it's in state department random 200 no one's going to look it up if it's
[37:30.000 --> 37:37.520]  not true they love me they love you they love everyone haha i apologize everything's fine

[38:00.960 --> 38:07.360]  and and and like leaving a huge steaming piles of wreckage behind it it doesn't matter if they're
[38:07.360 --> 38:14.000]  just openly criminal following every authoritarian playbook in a giant crescendo of just just an
[38:14.000 --> 38:22.640]  orgy of of government growth like a metastasization of a super mutagen cancer doesn't matter it's

[38:40.880 --> 38:46.960]  they're like absolutely this guy gets it we're gonna kill everybody and they love it all right
[38:48.880 --> 38:52.240]  may settle down a little bit here and get into the news ladies and gentlemen
[38:54.960 --> 38:59.120]  before i get to the news this just arrived on the truck minutes ago in fact during the last
[38:59.120 --> 39:06.000]  break it arrived and we ran out there and tore into the pallets of the hundred plus thousand
[39:06.000 --> 39:14.880]  magazines that just rolled into the info war center and this is the drum roll please november
[39:14.880 --> 39:23.040]  2013 edition another double cover it says is this the next big crash or is the next big crash coming
[39:23.680 --> 39:32.880]  and then on the front cover it has a tower of cards that are federal reserve notes on one
[39:32.880 --> 39:37.200]  side and regular cards on the other a great way to wake up prince and family and this special issue
[39:38.000 --> 39:46.400]  covers a plethora of key information you can buy the magazines at cost in bulk or get subscription
[39:46.400 --> 39:51.040]  we have a special going on subscriptions right now it's like 30 off or more i forget the exact
[39:51.040 --> 39:56.480]  math and we can go to the website and show the specials on the magazines but you can get a
[39:56.480 --> 40:05.760]  you can get a 50 pack at cost 10 packs 100 packs 25 packs but the subscription is 39 95 that
[40:05.760 --> 40:11.120]  includes the 12 magazine shipped out so almost all the cost is the shipping because we can't send
[40:11.120 --> 40:16.640]  it out media mail because it's seen as news information so we pay an arm and a leg to ship
[40:16.640 --> 40:21.200]  it out to you but there you go that is at cost nothing wrong with making money the magazine
[40:21.200 --> 40:27.120]  that was purely to wake folks up so it is at cost at cost at cost in fact i'm told at 39 95
[40:27.120 --> 40:32.960]  we might even be losing money but i just get a big thrill out of you having a big glossy beautiful
[40:32.960 --> 40:37.840]  color magazine as print goes the way of the goonie bird or as it goes the way of the dinosaurs

[40:53.040 --> 40:57.440]  and people just grab them up compared to everything else because almost everyone's
[40:57.440 --> 41:03.120]  heard of info wars and then they see a great cover like a stack of cards that says is the next
[41:03.120 --> 41:10.560]  crash coming and then it explains who's doing it absolutely essential to know who is behind
[41:10.560 --> 41:15.280]  all of this and it gets into a big boil down to the founding fathers and christians being demonized
[41:15.280 --> 41:23.760]  on military bases new big composite article on that and we get into the attack on the media
[41:23.760 --> 41:28.640]  and the press then we get into the banksters trying to implode society and we have a big
[41:28.640 --> 41:35.600]  spread on the open carry that happened a week and a half ago in san antonio that is so so

[42:05.120 --> 42:12.400]  destroy the bill of rights that is just some of the information in the 64 page magazine that is
[42:12.400 --> 42:20.640]  available at info war store dot com that's info wars store dot com and then of course we've got

[43:51.120 --> 43:54.880]  that nobody even knew about i mean the other nascent iodine i'm sorry isn't the same thing i
[43:54.880 --> 43:59.280]  mean it just you can't even taste like rocket fuel this is completely different because of the
[43:59.280 --> 44:04.880]  patented system they use that i'm not supposed to get into the point is is that it's why the
[44:04.880 --> 44:11.440]  national academy of sciences has it listed uh as as just one-of-a-kind deal and uh it was because
[44:11.440 --> 44:14.400]  i've asked dr group and others like what is the number 110 they're like well it's iodine and then
[44:14.400 --> 44:19.360]  it's this iodine and again they weren't even really selling it or promoting it because people are
[44:19.360 --> 44:23.280]  like oh iodine well folks have listened to us they've gotten in and now there is a run on it
[44:23.280 --> 44:28.720]  basically we're the only ones that have it and you can get it infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com

[44:38.400 --> 44:44.400]  store.com or call toll three eight eight eight two five three three one three nine eight eight eight
[44:44.400 --> 44:49.040]  two five three three one three nine in your purchase funds everything we're doing the magazines the
[44:49.040 --> 44:54.800]  films the news division everything we're doing so you just don't have yours truly up here uh
[44:54.800 --> 44:59.200]  going wild on the radio and then doing serious reports as well now you've got the great reporters
[44:59.200 --> 45:03.600]  where we've developed and the other folks and the writers and the researchers thank you all for
[45:03.600 --> 45:08.880]  your support and i want to thank our AM and FM affiliates for their support as well we couldn't
[45:08.880 --> 45:12.640]  have done this without you and if you're a listener listening to local AM and FM affiliates you need
[45:12.640 --> 45:16.640]  to support their sponsors tell them you're supporting them and spread the word about the
[45:16.640 --> 45:23.120]  stations and if you're a local business even if you're a small sponsor go do advertising on our
[45:23.120 --> 45:28.400]  local stations that's how we go from the weekend to so many daytime slots as people listen they get
[45:28.400 --> 45:34.240]  ratings but that isn't enough we've been number one in many cities number one even on small stations
[45:34.960 --> 45:41.440]  and after a few years and then ESPN almost always comes in and buys it out because well
[45:41.440 --> 45:47.200]  it's too much money and it doesn't matter the show had number one ratings they just buy it
[45:47.840 --> 45:53.280]  because the folks can't make money with talk radio and it's very very sad so if you hear this
[45:53.280 --> 45:58.160]  and you want more people to hear it you need to not be tithing at the local church that says hand
[45:58.160 --> 46:03.760]  in your guns roman's 13 worship world government you're tied folks if you really study history is
[46:03.760 --> 46:09.200]  to change things and to help folks and it is supporting our local AM and FM affiliates so
[46:09.200 --> 46:14.160]  spread the word about them and support their sponsors go in buy from their sponsors eat in
[46:14.160 --> 46:18.320]  their restaurants go to their stores go to their businesses go to their auto repair shops go to
[46:18.320 --> 46:26.480]  their bookstores go to their companies go to their print shops go to their nightclubs go to
[46:26.480 --> 46:32.640]  the places that support this show and listen if a station carries my show and has a bunch of
[46:32.640 --> 46:37.520]  crud on it support the station let me tell you it's a big deal they're coming after the media
[46:37.520 --> 46:41.680]  they're coming after free speech they've been trying to shut down a bankrupt radio forever
[46:41.680 --> 46:45.360]  and folks have hung in there and we have expanded and we're reaching millions of people
[46:45.360 --> 46:49.840]  thank god for our AM and FM affiliates and the and the FCC attack we've got to defeat their
[46:50.400 --> 46:54.720]  move for the fairness doctrine over the internet as well we've got to hang together or hang separate
[46:55.920 --> 46:59.600]  we've got to stand against diane feinstein you know saying that the government will decide
[46:59.600 --> 47:02.800]  what's the media now and that's what the FCC is moving forward to do now
[47:02.800 --> 47:10.800]  now more than ever is the time all right i've i've just got really angry today seeing obama
[47:10.800 --> 47:15.120]  saying it's bad apples that are you know increasing the price of the insurance and kicking people off
[47:15.120 --> 47:21.360]  their plans it was written to do this the bill was there and they are going to just keep dangling
[47:21.360 --> 47:28.160]  the hope that oh the site doesn't work that's why you can't get the free stuff it's it's like having
[47:28.160 --> 47:33.680]  a contest and then you tell folks to show up to hear who the winner is you know it's some lottery
[47:33.680 --> 47:40.640]  or some um you know type deal where you buy a ticket and then you show up nobody's there
[47:41.280 --> 47:47.280]  and they say oh sorry there was a fire the business is burned down and the guys really
[47:47.280 --> 47:53.520]  moved to costa rica i mean i've seen how they work so many times folks we knew the bill did this
[47:53.520 --> 47:58.720]  but i was like how are they going to get away with it more than doubling in the first year
[47:58.720 --> 48:02.560]  everybody's premiums and that was a conservative estimate by the way now it's much worse than
[48:02.560 --> 48:07.760]  that and i said i don't i don't think it's going to work i think they're going to claim
[48:07.760 --> 48:12.000]  there's glitches problems and then we saw obama start saying get ready for some glitches it may
[48:12.000 --> 48:19.840]  go on for months until people just get used to getting a big bill in the mail and then folks
[48:19.840 --> 48:25.600]  that can already get medicare medicaid other free health care or get or taxpayer subsidized
[48:25.600 --> 48:30.080]  means tested health care now you're going to get lower quality and you're going to find out
[48:30.080 --> 48:35.360]  but you're going to be all by yourself see when you're complaining and you go to your democratic
[48:35.360 --> 48:39.920]  party and complain to them they're going to say that's right wing propaganda and when the tea
[48:39.920 --> 48:46.000]  party tries to take over the republican party who wrote the legislation the blue blood rhinos
[48:46.000 --> 48:52.640]  with the democratic leadership but the republicans han showed it they are going after the libertarians
[48:53.440 --> 48:58.240]  and you've got carl rove lecturing everyone on fox news every week about how bad ram paul and
[48:58.240 --> 49:04.320]  ted cruz is and how how bad any other libertarian media is because their establishment and they
[49:04.320 --> 49:10.240]  want to control things and they want to destroy any opposition to them so if you're a democrat out
[49:10.240 --> 49:14.400]  there and you care about having a balance of power you care about not just having the corporate
[49:14.400 --> 49:20.000]  government that runs the two-headed monster of the republican democratic party you should
[49:20.000 --> 49:23.840]  admit you've been conned you should admit historically collectivism ends up always
[49:23.840 --> 49:28.400]  exploding and being taken over by corrupt individuals and you should admit we're bankrupt
[49:28.400 --> 49:37.760]  beyond belief and that you should run as a what is the lady that wrote beyond the green mass that
[49:37.760 --> 49:43.040]  we saw in gen 21 roza quarry what does she call herself he calls herself i think democratic tea
[49:43.040 --> 49:48.480]  party person i think that's the term and that's what we need we need to not be fighting with each
[49:48.480 --> 49:54.960]  other we need to admit we've been conned republicans have been conned by the establishment republicans
[49:57.520 --> 50:02.240]  democrats have been conned by the establishment democrats and they're all in there
[50:02.240 --> 50:07.360]  promising free goodies to people they did that to get us under their control now the goodies are
[50:07.360 --> 50:12.720]  going away now they're cutting the welfare they're cutting the food stamps for citizens not free
[50:12.720 --> 50:20.160]  legals that's the new crop they already got you they need the new crop to come in for more slaves
[50:20.160 --> 50:24.560]  you understand to drive things down even worse that's on record why do you think the fortune
[50:24.560 --> 50:30.400]  500 are all lobbying for totally open borders right now republican leadership democratic
[50:30.400 --> 50:35.280]  leadership all the big christian groups from the catholics of the evangelicals on government payroll
[50:35.280 --> 50:41.520]  now with the faith-based initiative pushing it the whole establishment that screws everybody

[55:28.800 --> 55:32.800]  out of school now they're arrested four toy guns even in their own backyard of their orange
[55:32.800 --> 55:37.520]  those are silver and of course our little mini guns that aren't real but they kind of look real
[55:37.520 --> 55:41.920]  maybe you should be arrested i'm definitely going to go out and see if i can get shot
[55:41.920 --> 55:46.640]  i took the officer the goat the caps just just just to scare people that's what i do but listen
[55:46.640 --> 55:51.600]  but listen you not only have toy guns and you're obviously in a halloween costume you're also
[55:51.600 --> 55:56.160]  wearing a cowboy outfit which is racist that's actually racist that you would suggest that this
[55:56.160 --> 56:03.120]  is a costume and that this isn't my everyday attire i am a cowboy well i guess we've got to
[56:03.120 --> 56:07.600]  only then go to the people that run the universities and the government and do what they say to make
[56:07.600 --> 56:12.960]  sure we're in compliance they just run our lives exactly you don't know what is going to offend
[56:12.960 --> 56:18.720]  people everyone is so sensitive now and no one wants to get sued and run around and well the
[56:18.720 --> 56:23.280]  answer to this tyranny it's not political correctness is to be politically incorrect
[56:23.280 --> 56:27.600]  because you notice now brown bags are you know you kicked out of government if you have those in
[56:27.600 --> 56:32.640]  seattle uh and then now they're expanding and on to cowboy hats so we need to just understand
[56:32.640 --> 56:37.680]  this is a cult of control freaks yeah that's probably the most offensive thing about my outfit
[56:37.680 --> 56:41.920]  is that i'm not actually wearing a cowboy hat so well listen if you stand up i want to show
[56:41.920 --> 56:47.280]  people some more insin sensitivity the first cowboys are actually from mexico and so that's
[56:47.280 --> 56:52.480]  why the classical western dress people think is from texas uh they actually uh there's that
[56:52.480 --> 56:57.520]  light right there it's also racist it's black i mean we chose not not so it would blend in because
[56:57.520 --> 57:02.160]  we're racist and of course the light back there is was white so that's racist as well very much
[57:02.160 --> 57:09.760]  but the whole issue is that's spanish style those um holsters and the engraving on the gun so you're
[57:09.760 --> 57:14.720]  actually putting down people from mexico i mean it's not that you think that's a cool style and
[57:14.720 --> 57:21.200]  adopted it like westerners did it's that you hate mexicans right in fact your hat your cowboy hat
[57:21.200 --> 57:26.240]  has some mexican spanish which is really spanish styling that's also anti spain well i'm going more
[57:26.240 --> 57:35.040]  for like a bandita so i just want to appropriate all culture do you want to apologize do you want
[57:35.040 --> 57:40.880]  to apologize to everybody uh out there but what about prisoners your shirt is striped that's been
[57:40.880 --> 57:46.640]  used for prisoners occasionally i'm a burglar yes so now you're making fun of of inmates i am
[57:47.200 --> 57:50.800]  i just want to offend everyone that's what it's about because because you know the global has
[57:50.800 --> 57:54.480]  worked for foreign banks that are destroying the country they want to change the subject and teach
[57:54.480 --> 57:59.360]  us we're bad so they can actually take all of our liberties collectively they don't want us to get
[57:59.360 --> 58:05.680]  together macadam speaking of that let's talk about how difficult it was to find these toy guns i had
[58:05.680 --> 58:10.400]  to go to like seven different stores and they were all like oh no after sandy hook we don't we don't
[58:10.400 --> 58:16.000]  have toy guns in the stores anymore and i was like what all of the toys have guns you know they're
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.200]  little toys they they carry guns but kids cannot have these little fake i was like so you don't
[58:21.200 --> 58:25.760]  have and you can get video games for kids where you kill people all day designed by the pentagon
[58:25.760 --> 58:31.920]  to condition to be killers but you you as an adult you're bad toy guns well they are arresting people
[58:31.920 --> 58:35.920]  for water guns right did you know if you shoot your boyfriend with a water gun to be arrested oh
[58:35.920 --> 58:46.400]  yeah like the girl in florida stay there criminal stay there this is gcn the genesis communications

[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.720]  folks it's pretty amazing google has come out and claimed that they don't work with the nsa when
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.520]  it's on record they do but strangely enough they put hillary clinton on the front page of google
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:41.440]  at least here in the us i know it's different around the world and they actually have hillary
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:48.080]  clinton at the nsa reading her political enemies emails and handing it over to the irs to politically
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:55.440]  persecute folks so i don't get why they've put hillary clinton reading nsa files this is really
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:01.040]  weird and if you go there you'll see what i'm talking about right now uh leon macadoo i got
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.280]  serious news coming up in the next segment a sheriff nick finch down in florida where they
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.320]  have state laws that are obviously unconstitutional to arrest people that legally have firearms under
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:15.200]  some parts of the law but not under others where it's the cop's discretion he said release this
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.760]  guy with no criminal record that was carrying a gun in his car and they indicted him the judge
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:25.200]  said we're going to try to convict him the jury did not convict him that's jury nullification you
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:30.080]  don't just have the ballot box you have the grand jury box and the jury box folks then you got the
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:37.200]  cartridge box we're trying to avoid 1776 box and you've got the soap box there's a bunch of boxes
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:43.520]  here you know the most important is the soul box in your heart and the brain box which is called
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.880]  the terrorist box because they don't want you thinking they want to tell you everything deck
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:53.440]  falls la la la gay apparel blah blah blah just to make a thought crime hallmarks banning all that
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.920]  don't be a cowboy university's all over saying this don't be a geisha girl you know because when
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:02.240]  you do dress up like a geisha girl you do it to be racist well now we say it's insensitive
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.920]  for you to go out and do that and have fun or to be an astronaut that you do that to be mean to
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:16.720]  the astronauts it's total psychological tyranny like beyond the the dystopic novels that have been
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:24.160]  written but but macadam tell folks about your experience trying to get this uh this uh gunfighter
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.600]  outfit obviously a children's toy uh in fact i think at christmas there's photos of me getting
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.000]  actually that set stand up and show the terrorists out there that are watching uh again right there
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.040]  ladies and gentlemen you could not find this and and they told you that it's dangerous tell folks
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:43.760]  what they said well the guy at the store i was like looking all over i'm like don't you have uh
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:50.400]  cowboy stuff here and oh racist very he was like we don't have a racist section but he said you
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.520]  know after sandy hook we had to take all the guns out of the store this was that can i say the name
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:00.080]  is of course toys are us and like you know we take we we don't sell that here anymore
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.400]  and because parents were complaining that we don't want to push that gun culture on children
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.680]  yeah probably two or three calls from bloomberg's office yeah i mean i'm like this is texas you
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.000]  don't have we need to tell we need to tell toys are us we're not ever coming to you who wants to
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.360]  go there anyways go to the little toy shops but you said you went all over and couldn't find the
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:23.200]  terrorist weapons exactly i did i went to several different toy stores i went to the halloween store
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:28.800]  the only thing they had at the halloween store was like this big ugly clearly fake looking and
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:35.520]  that's that's what they have to be right or see through the transparent in order to be safe and
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.000]  then the cops shoot a kid and now say we have to basically get rid of all toy guns when we've
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.480]  always had toy guns it didn't have this happening as often we had cops shoot a guy in austin who
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:49.360]  got out of his car at a routine traffic stop with his wallet exactly i mean now we've got to ban
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:54.800]  wallets because the because the cops are playing all these executioner games and think we're target
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:00.000]  practice right why isn't it the the police and then the cop that shot the 13-year-old boy he was
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:06.640]  a firearms instructor he trained all of his colleagues in how to not use excessive force
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.040]  so here he shoots a 13-year-old kid after 10 seconds seven times and the and the the gun
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:18.880]  that the kid had had a transparent center so it was following the protocol for a toy gun on the
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:24.080]  street so why isn't he in any trouble it's just it's insane like why can't we hold these people
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:28.560]  account no no no but exactly but see government and controlled media it's all about how we're bad
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:33.280]  we're causing problems right we need to give our rights up but then to the problems but then ignore
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:38.640]  what they're up to what they're doing and then point out that guns have made crime go down massively
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.360]  the FBI's own statistics so i guess you're gonna be out in austin tonight in that racist outfit
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:50.240]  definitely i have several racist outfits to choose from i'm going for the most racially insensitive

[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:52.720]  sheriff nick finch who was arrested for refusing to arrest people under unconstitutional state
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:57.200]  gun laws that were conflicting with other laws saying that people could be driving around their
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:03.200]  car or having a gun in their house for their own protection he was arrested uh kicked out of office
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:08.000]  by the kleptocrats uh down in florida the judge said he wanted him convicted wanted to make an
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.400]  example of him um we broke the news but it's now come out on the local affiliate um confirming
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.960]  what our reporter he's been on the reporting for us sheriff richard mac uh told us and we're
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:26.400]  working on getting sheriff finch to pop in sometime in the next hour i've found not guilty uh of
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:32.480]  letting someone out of jail who was falsely arrested by one of his deputies and you ask how
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:36.480]  they do this they arrest people all the time for legal and lawful guns and interpret it
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:42.160]  the way they want to that's how you see people arrested in downtown austin all the time open
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:50.080]  carrying rifles the police say we think that's threatening we think uh that uh you're rudely
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.600]  displaying that's how the laws written the jury finds uh suspected liberty county
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:04.720]  sheriff nick finch not guilty on both counts or it says the jury finds suspended liberty county
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.720]  sheriff nick finch not guilty on both counts thank god for that for justice finch was accused of
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.280]  releasing a man who was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon without a permit and then
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.600]  destroying the arrest records no he didn't he just said you shouldn't have arrested him this
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:25.040]  isn't illegal the way i read the code get rid of this finch was accused of releasing a man who
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:29.040]  was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon without a permit and then destroying the arrest
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.480]  record see that's why they want to get rid of juries folks because we're going to inform them
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:37.680]  that their vote is more important than the ballot box it's the jury box the grand jury box that's why
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:41.840]  they've turned them into these kept things run by the system continuing with the article
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.720]  it took the jury less than 90 minutes to reach the verdict closing arguments were held friday
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:54.720]  morning following two days of testimony now the question becomes when will finch get his badge and

[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.320]  and that's a good headline but really this is jury nullification is what it is uh
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:51.920]  you know uh patriot sheriff or pro gun sheriff found not guilty and then sub headline jury nullifies
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:58.480]  false arrest false charges and folks they're so scared if we actually get good police elected
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:03.760]  and actually take our cities over and actually get good lawmen back in and get good peace officers
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:10.800]  back in then the police won't be feared anymore they'll be appreciated and honored that's what
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:17.680]  we need and we need people that defend law abiding citizens and don't see them as the enemy we need
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:24.800]  police that aggressively like bloodhounds go after criminals but i've talked to so many police we've
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.040]  done it in minnesota when they're state police were caught handing out drugs to occupy wall street
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.400]  and then right across street was the federal reserve and we pointed out and and so was it
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:39.120]  wells fargo we had our reporters go up there and we pointed out to the police hey they've been caught
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.720]  laundering hundreds of billions of dollars don't even get in trouble they go we're not allowed to
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.600]  even look at them that's how it works you don't look at the big banks openly running the aircraft
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:53.600]  the drugs all of it on record the police all the time will swat team some insurance salesman
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.160]  and shoot him because he gets out of bed with a tv remote in his hand and then oh wrong house
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:05.360]  it's always like an i've seen multiple times it's always 72 year old retired insurance salesman
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:09.600]  the upscale neighborhood it's always an insurance salesman i've probably seen him kill insurance
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:15.440]  salesman five times i don't know why it's always insurance salesman or the the the the 52 year old
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:22.240]  doctor was shot in bed in front of his wife when the no doc warrant came in uh and the police aren't
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.920]  even corrupt they're just crazy they won't even lie they'll go well they actually thought it was a
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:32.160]  firearm it was uh he was reaching for his glasses and then it's like and it's always a wrong house
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:37.840]  too because whatever meth head crack head you know informant i mean they can get confidential
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:42.800]  informants folks to say puff the magic dragon that they saw it in your house they've never been in
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:47.200]  your house nothing and that's why i can't stand it when you get repair people in your house a lot
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:51.920]  of them that being listeners nowadays but sometimes they're looking around or they know who i am and
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.840]  they're asking so what do you do around here why aren't your kids in school and you can see them
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:02.160]  looking around for something because most repair men nowadays especially in major cities they make
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:08.000]  more money off the 25 kickback they get on average of any thing that comes out of the arrest prosecution
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.120]  conviction and so they're in your house computer repair people are digging through your computer
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:17.520]  and why shouldn't they just plant something on your computer that's happened a lot where you take
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.800]  your computer and be repaired and some meth head it's always meth head just the scum of the planet
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:28.880]  will will plant something on your computer so that they can then announce it and get some money off
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.280]  your arrest and a lot of times the police aren't total criminals so they'll actually
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.680]  forensically check it and you've seen these cases and go you planted that to get the reward money
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:46.480]  didn't you it's all right i'm getting drove for that do i i mean this is the type of ridiculous
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:56.880]  society that we have created and i personally am totally and completely sick of it at every level
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:02.960]  but sheriff arrested charge after defending second amendment found not guilty and we're
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:09.120]  going to get again some breakdown on that from sheriff richard mac and sheriff finch probably

[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.840]  let's move right into this article here out of the wall street journal update
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:31.280]  google denies nsa cooperation while expanding encryption
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:38.800]  ladies and gentlemen their own record founded by the nsa with nsa technology and funding from
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:45.680]  the cia in cutel so but they're counting on your ignorance here so they're now uh denying all that
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:53.520]  here's another one nsa bombshell shocks former spooks why in the world would we burn google
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:16:00.080]  the actual quote is burn our relationship with google so there in the foreign affairs section
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:08.480]  the wash and post admitting this and and and and so there's this whole fight going on now where they
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:14.800]  all try to deny their criminal activities google has the nsa backdoor codes on record they get from
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:18.720]  all the software makers three years ago remember it was in the news they drive around with those
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:22.720]  google cars you know they're pink and green and non-threatening colors
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.200]  folks have a mac truck is pink it'll still run over you and kill you but it's all non-threatening
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:34.480]  driving around as imperial prob droids not just taking video everything that's just the cover
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:43.200]  story for street view but breaking into everything as it drives along continuing very nice people
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.880]  though but of course they didn't get in trouble for that worldwide you noticed because it's all
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:52.960]  sanctioned google is the corporate front because then they can have payoffs to all the government
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:17:00.160]  people and give them revolving door jobs while they absolutely well the word is rape again us of
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:06.720]  our privacy and use the data to game the markets and rig everything against us
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:15.120]  let's continue here coast guard comments on mysterious google barge and says they have nothing
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:22.480]  to say about it basically cbs news is reporting now there's three loving google barges big black
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:30.000]  cubes being built out there under the pentagons loving loving gaze and there are some connections
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:37.520]  to google but it's definitely multifaceted spy hub platforms i was in corpus christy
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:45.760]  about five years ago fishing i even took photos of it in some old iphone i've got somewhere
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:52.400]  and i saw a giant the biggest oil rig platform i've ever seen with four big oil rigs stabilizing
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:58.800]  it going out it was giant nsa bubble pods and i think i even actually did show that on the website
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:03.120]  somewhere the point is about a year later they had it national geographic after it had been
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:08.960]  authorized and stuff saying the nsa launches a global spy system for asia guys we use search
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:16.880]  national geographic corpus christy texas surveillance uh it's just just national geographic
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.040]  corpus christy even though it was really port aransas corpus christy texas
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:32.000]  uh nsa that should bring it up and it was just this gigantic floating city of spy grids
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:39.760]  let's go ahead and go to the next piece of news here dealing with the whole nsa situation

[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:13.600]  you know the head engineer in san francisco a few years ago was it five six years ago when
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.720]  publican said we have whole floors where everything you do is run through it well that's in the
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:23.520]  telecommunications act of 96 that's what's so frustrating about this they've released new

[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:48.320]  info i am going to open the phones up and get into an article that's really a study in media
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:55.360]  manipulation and and and ignorance and folks having a normalcy bias really cognitive dissidents
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.400]  because there's a headline up on info wars dot com united nations to destroy property rights of
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:06.400]  thousands around alamo that's how kit daniels took the high road encountered about five tv
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:12.720]  stations more than a dozen major newspapers in the state and the texas land commissioner coming
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:19.520]  out and saying basically our report without naming it was horse pucky that the un is to get
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:25.840]  unesco world heritage site biosphere designation over the alamo now they admit they're trying to
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:32.160]  get that designation so it's designated by tourists and people so they can go there i i i get that but
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:37.040]  i'm an expert on this i made a film about it 16 years ago they've had congressional testimonies
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:41.520]  they've had legislative testimonies we have it all linked in his article we hadn't linked to the other
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:48.720]  article we have the un plat demanding san antonio not let anybody build in the corridor it takes
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:54.800]  control of the other areas and it does let them dictate that's a fact that's a fact
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:02.240]  and i understand san tonio wants this un designation it puts it on maps all over the world it will
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:10.480]  bring money to san antonio no doubt about it no doubt about it the point is we're right and again it
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:15.120]  we've got all the documents and and i mean i am a leading expert on this we ought to get william
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:21.760]  f mcmanus on or even better the editor of the um new american william f jasper
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:28.560]  it's john f mcmanus i've conflated their names because he's the real expert that's where i found
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:32.240]  out about all this in the mid 90s from him and couldn't believe it and went and checked it myself
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:39.200]  and the issue is like i'm just covering it now i'll just cover it now the issue here if you go to
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:45.360]  the article we'll punch it up on info wars dot com united nations to destroy property rights of
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:50.720]  thousands around alamo and you look at the un documents that we have linked in it showing the
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:58.800]  buffer zone showing how you can't build they're on record not letting a gold mine 48 miles away
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:04.720]  from yellowstone that had been open for decades expand they're on record shutting down businesses
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:11.600]  around wherever they set up this is u n munialization agenda 21 i like jerry paterson i'm
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:16.240]  supporting him for lieutenant governor he's been a pro second amendment guy remember going and
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:21.280]  fighting anti-gun bills down there and he'd be there when he was first a state senator
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.760]  and nobody even knows that jerry paterson is outside of texas but he could go on to be the
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:31.120]  the state um lieutenant governor in texas that's really the governor that's more powerful than the
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:38.720]  governor and he could go on to be a national figure but it's just that these guys think it's
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:45.760]  politically incorrect to admit that there's global government going on to admit there's un takeover
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:50.880]  going on to admit that we're going under internationalism i mean obama says we don't
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.760]  operate we operate into the un in fact i have an article today that's up on info wars dot com by
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:03.040]  curt nemo where the state department and obama are saying that all of the un treaties trump the
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:08.400]  constitution that's a quote they told congress last year in this year we're under nato command
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:14.640]  congress doesn't have any power over our military now we've known that's coming for a long time we're
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:21.200]  going into global governance here they're signing the asia pacific union with the north american
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.880]  union and the eu right now that's always been the trilateral commission plan i remember 10 years

[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:39.600]  you'll you'll buy property this is a look kind of a local scam is done in cities you'll buy a piece
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:44.320]  of property for a half million and then whoever you sold the city out to whoever you've given deals
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:50.880]  well suddenly buy it for a million and you make 500 000 that's how all these little scams work
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:55.200]  kind of like the hillary cattle futures but she bought a couple thousand dollars of them
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:00.560]  and then they magically all hit the equivalent i think they said at the time of seven royal
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:06.560]  flushes in a row was the uh newsmax headline i remember back in the 90s when that came out
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:13.600]  they did the math it was like totally impossible it'd be like going to los vegas and going down
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:18.640]  the row of 50 slot machines and pulling the lever and getting the highest payout on every one in a
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:25.920]  row oh yeah she went and invested two thousand dollars or whatever it was it made a million
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:33.360]  yeah there it is hillary clinton futures trades to tailed the washington whitewash i mean sorry the
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:39.200]  washington pooper well i'm sorry the washington witch the washington post the washington post
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:46.000]  there you go you know uh after deep thought i think they should change the name of the washington
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.960]  redskins and i thought about the tyrants to the sanduskies the molesters why not just the washington
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:36:00.080]  criminals i mean that really would be just the describes it all the whole rainbow of criminal
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:09.520]  control freak activity or the washington satans and i'm really having a problem here all right let
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:14.160]  me get into all the news by the way you know the whole jerry paterson thing the texas land
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:19.760]  commissioner who is a great patriot who you know defied the state trying to block anybody being
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.880]  able to have a rally politically ever at the alamo the first one since the alamo happened
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.360]  because after that it was just a ruin and then it was a warehouse until the 50s and then you know
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:33.680]  they were the 40s and then they turned into a shrine that became popular when john wane did a
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:39.760]  movie about it nobody cared horse stables at one time and he went down there the first speech
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:44.960]  ever i didn't know that we were the first ever speaks since 1836 in the alamo a few weeks ago
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:49.200]  we're gonna have to go there and paterson did it took a lot of heat for having an open carry there
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.160]  they claimed we were all gonna kill each other now no one got hurt nothing happened it was great
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:37:01.280]  total success it just makes me mad then when i have all the un documents and the un plat saying
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.640]  you can't build hotels or have businesses around the alamo if the un gives you this un designation
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:11.760]  and the un heritage site is not as bad as the biosphere when they give you that it's really under
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:17.600]  un control i mean that is a big deal the heritage site not as bad and i and i get
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:24.240]  it you know that they've got independence hall they've got all of our sacred shrines of liberty
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:29.680]  under un control and i don't like that if you want to have it on a un map and send tourists there
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:34.480]  that's fine and i get that people want that designation because then it goes on all the maps
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:42.560]  all the major maps and the online maps and it sends a lot of money there but at the expense of letting
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:49.360]  the un come in and get control and it does and what's horse pucky is the fact that people don't
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:53.200]  want to admit stuff like this is happening and i'm not ranting and raving about it it's not that
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:38:01.200]  important in the final equation individually but the point is is that the denial of it
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:07.280]  so go read tit daniel's article united nations that destroy property rights of thousands around
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:12.000]  the alamo you let's go won't grant alamo world heritage status without property restrictions
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.120]  in buffer zone and we have a direct link to the city plat and the agreements with the un
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:22.000]  a map of the over seven square mile buffer zone surrounding the alamo for no more construction
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.480]  basically and then it goes into the international treaty what it agrees to when you agree to it
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:32.720]  all of it okay i mean i made a film about this 16 years ago okay believe me i went through major
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:38.080]  battles on this when i started talking about this in 1996 because they were designating all the
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:45.280]  national parks all the major sites and shutting down cattle ranches that bordered park saying that
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:51.440]  well the un says you can't have this and then was it 48 miles away a memory serves a gold mine
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:57.360]  that had been up there for decades i mean it's very annoying to be informed and constantly be
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.160]  lectured by all these mainline republicans who i agree with a lot of stuff on but they go there's no
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:08.320]  un doing anything come on that's that crazy alex hey man i'm right i know what i'm talking about
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:13.680]  and it's the denial of what's going on if you want to do a cost benefit analysis and say well
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:20.480]  with this heritage site it will put up a un flag it will put up a un plaque inside now side and
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:24.800]  it's going to be put up there and we're going to go back and and and paterson says there's not going
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:34.080]  to be any un stuff there bull bull bull bull bull and again i'm not in a you know what contest
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:43.440]  epitome contest here my issue is that it is that it's the wider issue like you tell people hey uh
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:50.560]  there's a 24 harvard studies alone conducted over the last decade showing one part per million hydro
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:55.520]  fluorescent acid or sodium fluoride in the water reduces iq by more than 10 points after just three
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:02.000]  years of use in a child and it increases bone cancer sevenfold in males threefold in females
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.320]  and index studies and blah blah blah and then here's over a thousand other studies one of the
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:10.640]  most studied things they knew 100 years ago it did this and dumb people down and made them with
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:16.400]  arctic and they just laugh at you and go sure they wouldn't hurt us they love us and and and then i
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:24.240]  say but what about all the secret testing oh that was a long time ago so then i'm the bad guy because
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:30.160]  i've got a team of reporters with documents and history and congressional testimony and legislative
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:39.280]  testimony in kentucky and california i mean i am a expert on this and i'm sick
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:44.880]  this morning i ran into a famous race car driver i'm not going to say whose name
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:51.600]  i had a low water crossing and we were talking about our trucks that were the same truck
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:56.960]  before we decided to go ahead and go across the water crossing nobody else would go across and
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:04.480]  it would be and and and this person before i run into was just told me about what you know
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:10.480]  stuff about cars and what i want to do to my car i want to soup it up which i haven't done it'd be
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:15.600]  like me at the end of it laughing i'm going oh really you know i think you know about cars i mean
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.720]  instead of having knowledge these people just laugh at everyone it's like i don't need knowledge
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:26.080]  i don't need to be informed here i can just laugh at you oh the nsa has whole floors of buildings
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:31.200]  of all telecommunications nationwide now you're a kook for saying that the first person to say
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:36.800]  it 1996 because of a whistleblower that came to you from a big telecom in austin and you were a
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:41.680]  bigger kook when you said in 1998 that all the digital cable boxes were tracking everything you
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:46.000]  watched and had hidden microphones doesn't matter all came out yours later you're absolutely right
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.880]  you know you don't get admired you don't get supported you don't get listened to no no we laugh
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:58.880]  at you more because you were right you see you see that's how this works and and i'm so sick of it
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:05.600]  it's like a year and a half ago kurt nemmer wrote an article about drones nationwide and he linked
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:11.600]  to congressional and fbi reports where they were having hundreds of drone missions with the predator
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:18.320]  drones run by the pentagon for local police all over the country and he cited local news articles
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:24.640]  and then they had a major disinfo campaign come out in over a thousand newspapers attacking
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:30.640]  info wars dot com drudge report dot com and saying we were complete loon liars there were no drones
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:35.040]  now you know since then they've announced oh actually the drones are everywhere and blimps and
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:40.240]  we're watching you but see they were getting the contracts then and buying more and rolling them out
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:45.360]  they didn't want to stop so they just came out and said there are no drones don't listen to
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:55.280]  no drones don't listen to Kurt Nemo the filthy liar remember that and i had people talk show host
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.280]  calling people going man you're really getting it hard discredited are you sure there's drones and i
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:06.720]  went did you read our articles it was linked to scores of local news and even wired magazine but
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:13.680]  see the u n's not taking over stuff when they get these designations doesn't matter they are it you
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:17.440]  come out again and said it's only a few bad apples first no one's going to raise your premiums no one's
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:22.240]  going to get kicked off turns out they knew had the meetings he's ordered the insurance companies
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:27.200]  in secret meetings it's come out to shut up that's even the washington post and they're all circle
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:31.760]  the wagons and and he's getting more donations than ever the democrats are and so are the republicans
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:39.600]  to keep obama care in place as a total complete absolute robbery was i right did it raise the
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:44.800]  premiums across the board did it cut people off who had existing conditions instead of
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:49.440]  guaranteeing them did it lower the standard of care and it's just getting started everything i
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:55.760]  said worse than i said but exactly as i said to a point it was exactly as i said and then it went
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:03.760]  past that absolutely as i said they are absolutely putting flour in the water to give you cancer and
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:08.160]  dumb you down they are murdering criminals i mean can people get their mind around that i understand
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:12.400]  why you want to be in denial because he didn't have to admit we're really in a lot of trouble well
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:19.360]  i got to get wound up every day and come in here and try to warn people okay i've got to sit here
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:24.640]  knowing i'm right every day it doesn't hurt my feelings when i get laughed at it freaks me out
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:31.040]  because i know i'm right and i'm desperate to try to get out of this and i've used this analogy a
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:35.280]  thousand times i'll use it again it's like in all those old movies it's actually been real cases
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:39.760]  and stuff like this where this where the ocean liner or the boat a fishing boat whatever flips
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:45.280]  over people are trapped in an air pocket you're gonna have to swim out 50 yards 100 yards and so
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:50.000]  many times one person has the will to swim out and get out everybody else just breaks down panic
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.680]  cries can't do it the boat's sinking you can see it's bubbling you can tell any minute now it's
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:00.320]  going to fully sink the air pockets going to disappear the boat's going to go down too deep
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:04.960]  you're not going to get alive there have been hundreds of cases of this recorded in the last
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:09.360]  few hundred years and most of the time the majority of people say i can't do it you're not listen
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:16.320]  in some cases it's just fishing boats it's only 20 30 feet you got to go they die they cannot get
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:21.280]  out they cannot get out of the little bit of oxygen they think safe and the globalists know that
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:26.000]  i was talking to the top banking executive off record one of the top heads of one of the big
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.560]  six banks he's the number two guy at one of the big six banks he laughed at me and he said they
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:35.680]  will put up with by increment with anything it's human's power to adapt that we're using
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:44.320]  and you're like why would somebody like this tell you that because i said okay this is off record
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:48.320]  unless it was like you know killing kids or something i have to now not say who it was
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.560]  on a first class flight to new york he was coming down here to visit his dad
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:46:00.080]  they retired general and i mean he was he was perfect shape look good for like 65 or whatever
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:04.160]  he was perfect suit got this perfect black jacket how do these guys fly in a suit and
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:07.360]  looks perfect when they get off and he had the whole thing together and he turned and he just
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:13.120]  said look the people are done they want to be slaves basically and he said you don't understand
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:20.080]  he really taught me something he said it's their adaptability we use and his eyes were sparkling
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:27.120]  with evil intelligence he said it's their adaptability we use and i go what do you mean he goes
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:33.360]  you people adapt to whatever pressures are put on them and so they adapt in and accept the new
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:40.000]  reality and he just said you're not going to help them i've been told this over and over again by
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.800]  elite and and and i look at and i they're actually right though the public doesn't want to be helped
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:49.040]  they act like a bunch of rats just like the elite but at least the elite get together and don't do
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:47:00.160]  this to everybody but i morally cannot sign on and do this to people well ladies and gentlemen
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:06.240]  the headline is up on info wars dot com right now and it's also now being picked up by national

[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:53.280]  sir this is a real honor for me i don't get excited having hollywood folks on i get excited
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:58.880]  having you on i got some butterflies we salute you and we salute that jury tell folks what happened
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.520]  to you tell us what it was like in there with that jury sir well first alex let me say thanks
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:06.960]  for having me on i know that we've been trying to get up with each other for a long time and we've
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:12.560]  kind of slipped through the cracks and and that's fine um but it's fine it's it's good to finally
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:18.320]  meet you and get to talk to you um you know what i thought yesterday afternoon uh when we put on our
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:24.240]  defense um my attorney and i talked in there and we kind of said here's what i said to my attorney i
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:29.360]  said you think we shocked the whole world if we didn't put on any defense at all i said i think
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:33.920]  the prosecution's very proved our case for us and he smiled at me he said it's up to you sheriff
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:38.400]  what are you going to do and i said well i i definitely need to go out of stand i said these
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:44.400]  jurors want me to look them anytime and tell them that i did not commit any crimes and and that's
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:51.920]  what i did and um when i when i took the stand i was i had direct eye contact with each juror
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:59.200]  and each juror was looking at me and they were paying attention to what i said and they knew
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:06.160]  when i got done testifying that i was telling the truth and they but that they verified that
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:11.520]  yesterday after i got off stand i was i was convinced that i was going to be found out
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:17.760]  now sir tell us about the false charges testified to the worldwide audience of three million people
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:22.720]  right now in a nutshell you've got the floor sheriff what happened to you what they did for
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:28.160]  those that didn't really follow the case or only saw state-run media demonizing you and the entire
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:34.480]  political system coming after you because they're so afraid of lawmen being americans and then what
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:38.080]  it was like when you were found not guilty and then i want to warn you they're going to probably
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:42.400]  come after you again you're a smart guy you know that but but i mean you're a national figure of
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:46.240]  honor and i never talked like this to folks but we just i know you're just going to say you did
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:50.960]  the right thing and but and upheld your oath that we salute you sir for your courage because i
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:56.080]  appreciate that alex and when i got elected sheriff you know my deep dark desire was not to
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:01.280]  become a national figure but i know that i i have in some aspect became a national figure
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:06.720]  and that's okay i'm big enough to i'm big enough to handle that um but in a nutshell what happened
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:13.520]  was one of my deputies made a traffic stop um about 30 miles south of the capital of liberty
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:19.520]  county or the county she delivered county um found a firearm in a fellow's right front pocket
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:24.320]  guys out there not bothering anybody you know he's on his way home and hell he's five miles from the
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:32.320]  house and so my deputy arrested him for carrying a concealed firearm and um so i had got a call
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:37.600]  and and you know my wife was with me at the time actually and i told my wife i said man i said
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:42.080]  i wish he wouldn't have done that i said you know i've got second amendment issues here that that
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:46.640]  really bothered me about that now everybody knows in the state of florida the state law
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:50.160]  says that you if you're going to carry a concealed firearm you got to have it permit but
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:56.480]  uh you know i joined the military in 1981 alex and i swore the very same oath to support protect
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:02.080]  and defend the constitution and but obviously i i agreed with that it was so much that i went to
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:08.720]  war for this country so it you know to me the constitution still means something so i made
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:13.200]  the decision not to you know not to go through with the arrest i went to the jail me personally i
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:16.880]  personally went to jail now you gotta understand liberty county is the smallest county in state
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:23.680]  of florida eight thousand eighty three hundred residents these people want their sheriff to be
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:30.080]  personally involved and and that's what i am is personally involved and so i go and i release the
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:36.880]  guy i tell the jailer we're not charging him and i walk out and and build home but hell that was on
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:44.400]  june no that was on march the eighth didn't hear another word about it until may 24th when the
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:49.680]  florida apartment law enforcement served a search warrant on my jail at 11 o'clock at night with
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:54.720]  now listen i told you i'm the smallest county in the state we've got 8300 residents and they
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:52:01.280]  sent four fd le agents to serve a search warrant on my jail like you were a criminal like i was a
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:06.560]  criminal and so the very next morning actually that was friday saturday morning i woke up i had the
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:12.160]  the commissioner of the florida apartment law enforcement i had his cell phone number as the
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.360]  sheriff of liberty county you know i've got a lot of cell phone numbers and i called him and i said
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:21.760]  you know what i said all you really had to do is ask me what happened and i told you but now that
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:27.120]  you you know that now that you've started a criminal investigation my lips are sealed my friend i have
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:34.000]  nothing to say and so you know i have known all along alex ever you know everybody who has paid
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:40.160]  attention has known all along that i violated no law and and what i did i did based on my
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:44.240]  belief in the second amendment of course the state tried to make it like i did a favor for a good
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:49.120]  old boy kind of thing and and they got up there yesterday and put on their dog and phony show and
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:55.520]  and uh they really had no case to begin with but what sheriff sure of them and i mean i'm not in
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:02.160]  mark sure about paying and and and having a felony hanging over my head and it you know it
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:08.080]  did have an effect on on them i mean i'm more concerned for my wife and my two daughters they
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:12.560]  you know what they didn't find up for this they didn't deserve this i'm a big boy i can handle
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:18.320]  anything they want to throw at me but it was really it was hard on them and it's being hard on them
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:23.600]  they're hard on me so well sheriff nick fence joining us be a cell phone right now i'm not
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:28.160]  obviously an expert on the florida constitution but i've read over the laws had some lawyers on
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:33.920]  about your case the way i read it correct me if i'm wrong that's out in the open you you're not
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:38.400]  supposed to have a gun concealed without the permit but isn't it different in your house
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:43.440]  or your car uh under a lot of the rulings and especially if you're traveling to or from your
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:48.800]  home well there are some there are some different conditions and quite honestly florida statute
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:56.320]  seven ninety two fifty one the title of that statute is um possession of a firearm in a motor
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:03.280]  vehicle for self defense and other purposes and it goes on and on but the state law is so
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:07.920]  contradicting because in one part of the statute it says yeah you have the absolute right and the
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:13.040]  legislator agrees you have the right to keep it and then another part says if you gotta have this
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:17.040]  and then another part says well how much you're going fishing you're okay and so there's just so
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:23.120]  many different interpretations exactly so you're elected and and you're following it so you make
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:30.000]  your determination and then they try to put you in prison for that uh for a law abiding citizen out
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:36.400]  there he's trying to protect himself and and your deputy took him to jail do we know who who uh
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:42.480]  inside your department uh did this and uh went to the establishment to bear false witness
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.160]  all right yeah the deputy that actually made the arrest um on march the eight
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:55.840]  i guess when uh after he decided that he didn't like that i was going to start looking into his
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:01.840]  financial situation he uh decided to get a new job and when he left and he went forward two months
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:05.120]  two and a half months later to the florida department law enforcement complained about it
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:09.920]  didn't that how it always is so he didn't do this right away he waited till
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:16.480]  you started trying to run a good shop yes yeah yeah well in fact i here's what happened i hired
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:21.680]  two guys made him captains and i really was relying on those boys to um to help me out because
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:27.040]  you know i always thought they were good boys and um i'm not saying they're not a good boy but i'm
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.480]  what i'm saying is is i was letting them do the hiring and firing i'm sure if i've got bigger fish
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:39.520]  to cry and uh we were really putting a bind to begin with when i took office i the the top seven
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:46.800]  leadership positions and i i don't want that to sound bad but i mean we only have like 14 so the
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:51.520]  top seven walk out the door so immediately i'm tasked with trying to find seven people to come
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:58.320]  in and pick up pieces and move on so you know a pretty hasty i was i was told this guy was a good
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:04.320]  guy he'd be a great deputy and um it just didn't turn out the way that i had i had hoped that it
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:10.240]  would um but yes the answer your question they charged me with a third degree felony and um
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:17.280]  had to have they prevailed in this witch hunt then i would have lost my law enforcement certificate
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:23.440]  i would have lost the 15 years i have in the florida retirement system and i would probably go on
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:31.600]  gel for a little while uh sheriff let's talk about this briefly uh i saw a lot of the republican
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:36.480]  establishment line up against you which i thought was particularly disgusting but i think it's a
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:42.720]  litmus test now uh clearly you weren't breaking any laws then they tried to say you destroyed the
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:48.240]  report uh when obviously from your perspective was a false arrest so you were simply just getting
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:52.880]  rid of something that was a false arrest uh but i mean specifically what do you make of some of
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:57.520]  the people in the state who claim that they're conservatives or patriots uh coming after you
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:05.680]  with such vengeance well in my opinion you know they took the same oath that i took alex to support
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:11.200]  protecting the constitution and i don't believe that uh you know that was really what they were
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:18.640]  doing in this case and and you know i'm am i mad yet i'm mad that i'm going to try to get over
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:25.200]  being mad and uh you know i i'm not going to say i'm giving them the benefit of the doubt but
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:30.720]  what i'm saying is at your point you know right now i'm going to let bygones be bygones i got to
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.000]  get back to work for the people who know i hear you but here's the bottom line just like they've
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.640]  gone after our pio and others who stand up to them they're going to come after you now i'm
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:43.600]  you seem like a smart guy i mean you know to really watch your back now oh yes sir yes sir
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:51.920]  and i we've got that we i've got a plan to to protect myself now and uh i will not make myself
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:56.720]  vulnerable again and and they're gonna have a hard time ever coming after that you're right i believe
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:03.200]  they will try um what was it like what was it like when the jury successful sure and uh hopefully
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:06.960]  won't be successful people you stand behind you here we're all hanging together what was it like
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:12.400]  sir when when the jury said not guilty what did the prosecution and the judge that i've seen say
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:18.320]  some pretty prejudice things against the case how did they behave you know what i'm going to tell
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:22.640]  you something i think the judge and the prosecution knew what the verdict was going to be before it
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:28.320]  ever came out just like everybody else did uh they weren't shocked they weren't shocked because
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:35.120]  they knew that they had no case the state presented no evidence against me at all amazing stay there

[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:40.480]  having lawyers on about it i remember reading the statue it's written both ways but they can do
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:44.480]  whatever they want but clearly you're in your car you're in your house you can have a gun you know
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:48.800]  concealed unconcealed whatever and he said look you're not supposed to do this and then they tried
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:52.800]  to persecute him it was the last thing they want the sheriffs being americans everything is about
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:56.640]  getting rid of the sheriffs federalizing them sheriff we're going to get you on after this you
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:01.920]  know whirlwind of you being found not guilty by the jury today next week for 30 minutes or so thank
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:07.600]  you for the time in the three or four minutes we've got left a what are your political aspirations
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:11.200]  now i know you probably never had any the folks are going to want you to run for our office
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:16.800]  where do you go from here uh and what do you want to say to the jury and the american people
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:21.200]  before and i said i never ever had any political aspirations but you know i wanted to be the sheriff
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:30.160]  of liberty county not a politician but um you know if i have to run for governor if i have to run
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:37.520]  for state senator if i have to run for a federal office to try to spin the tide of what i believe
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:42.960]  is going on in this country that i'm i'm i'm game as long as the people will support me um
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:48.240]  he'll go to the white house if they'll put me in there well exactly that's the attitude we have
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:52.400]  to have in the old days back with thomas jefferson and people they didn't want to go george washington
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:58.080]  they were going to make him king and he said no i don't want to go back to my farm we want to have
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:02.640]  a free country we don't want to go be around all these politicians but we've got to serve just
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:06.880]  like you did in the army just like you're doing a sheriff and we need leaders like you but but
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:11.680]  getting back to the jury you got cut off what was it like after they said not guilty what was the
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:16.960]  look on the judge and the prosecutor's face and did you get a chance to talk to the jurors uh no i
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:21.920]  did not get a chance to talk to jurors i did hold a press conference right after and i and i thank
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:26.480]  each and every one of the jurors for for coming to the only logical conclusion that they could
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:31.440]  come to i think listen i think this jury was fair and impartial they were very attentive to the
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:38.000]  whole trial process and i couldn't have had a better jury if if somebody else were you know if
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:43.520]  if i'd have been able to pan pick on myself i couldn't have a better jury um the to answer the
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:49.520]  question about the prosecutor and and the judge um you know what i really believe they knew in their
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:53.600]  heart that it was going to be not guilty and there was really very little reaction from any of
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:58.240]  i just saw a report yesterday where they were saying the judge wanted to make an example of
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:03.840]  you i guess he didn't get what he wanted i guess not well the prosecutor the prosecutor really makes
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:08.560]  um when this all started he told me but they offered me a deal and the deal was chair if you
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:13.840]  resign and and we'll drop the charges and we'll hold a special election in two years and you can
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:19.520]  run for office again and you know what i said to that and then they called back about a week later
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:24.160]  and said uh if you don't decide by friday the offer's off the table and we'll go to war and i
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:28.160]  and i looked at my attorney and i said you tell that prosecutor i know that at least one of us
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:32.800]  has been the war so that's what he wants that's what he's gonna get well that's what these bullies
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:37.440]  don't get is that they've been pushing too long and good people are standing up the sleeping giant
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:43.360]  is awakening and closing after you leave uh any other points you think are important to make uh
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:49.520]  sheriff uh about the fight we're in in this country and what you've gone through well i just
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:54.560]  think that it's more it's important more now than ever that these politicians start remembering
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:59.440]  the oath that they took to the constitution and start standing up and fighting for the people
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:04.720]  that they swore that it was for uh i find it absolutely disturbing the direction that this
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:11.040]  country is going in and i'm concerned alec i really am so where do you go from here just
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:16.640]  trying to get back to protecting and serving in your community uh yeah for now the first step
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:21.440]  is i i have had contact with the governor today they're working on a reinstatement order that
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:25.120]  should come this afternoon so i'm ready to get back to work for the people of liberty county
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:31.520]  get things settled down get our agency running back the way it needs to be running and then uh
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:36.320]  you know maybe maybe a couple years from now we can we can look into uh maybe move into a different
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:39.840]  position sheriff nick fans we're going to break i'll say bye to you and let you get back to the

[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:27.440]  radio network
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:39.120]  well I tell you if you just joined us folks on the December October 31st
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:48.480]  2013 world-wide broadcast we just had Sheriff Nick Finch on and that was a simply groundbreaking
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:55.200]  interview the fact that he followed the law because it's written both ways in Florida didn't arrest a
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:59.520]  law abiding citizen that doesn't have a criminal record driving to and from his business in his
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:04.560]  home with a pistol in his front pocket they want to take you to jail they wanted to charge that guy
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:11.360]  with a felony and Finch said no we're not going to do this this is unconstitutional plus the
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:16.400]  laws written both ways we've had lawyers on about the Florida law a lot of states Texas had a law
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:20.560]  like this till a few years ago we got it changed where we can carry guns in our car
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:28.480]  I can't tell you how many people I know in fact the Supreme Court case that
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:36.960]  Sheriff Mack and others were involved in about challenging Brady and the waiting period and all
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:44.160]  that they would do stuff like famous case in Texas and pull a doctor over and he had a handgun in
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:50.960]  his vehicle and took him to jail for it and that's what they want to do it happens all the time
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:55.440]  and that's why if you have a carpet cleaner in your house like I had happened to me
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:59.840]  15 years ago or something else and they see a gun case they call the cops
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:05.600]  a lot of people I know in Texas folks moving from New York and California from big cities
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:11.600]  they come in your house to do plumbing to do uh air conditioner repair to clean the carpets
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:20.080]  to or people come over for a party my parents multiple times have had friends over that they
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:27.440]  knew from college that are liberals who would see a gun case through the living room into the
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:34.240]  bedroom you could see my dad's walk-in closet and see rifles there you can see them there right now
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:39.840]  that's I mean big deal buys bedroom is in the closet there it is glass doors doesn't have
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:45.040]  kids at home anymore no need to lock them up he's got a few guns in there shotgun dear rifles hand
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:51.280]  guns stuff like that my dad's a concealed carry holder as well but that's a side issue and repeatedly
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:57.440]  they've gone one time when I was there because I went over there in college to get some of my guns
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:01.600]  that I was keeping there and I came walking through when he had some friends over the editor of a
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:07.840]  major newspaper I'll just leave it at that and through the kitchen into the living room saw me
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:15.120]  walk into the living room to go out the front door into the fourier with a deer rifle and I
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:25.760]  literally heard a and then I went and walked in with a gun gun gun gun gun and I was like
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:30.320]  and I met this guy probably eight nine times in my life even on a vacation once with him to the
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:35.120]  beach a couple times the guy was like totally normal and nice any other time actually a pretty
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:40.000]  smart guy but a big liberal a lot of liberals are funny neat people at the same time you know
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.840]  he's not like a cult member he's not like an actual evil liberal he's like a real you know
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:49.040]  liberal at certain areas and he literally began hyperventilating and I went it's okay touch it
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:56.240]  and and my dad said it's okay and he said no just please get it out and was almost in tears
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:02.720]  had watery eyes I went and put her up came back out and he was mad at me he was mad at me
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:06.080]  but I mean I'm walking through with a rifle he sees it
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:12.480]  I mean it'd be like if you saw a zombie walk through and it wasn't Halloween it was like
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:18.160]  ah but then he sees military police all this stuff and feels totally safe one of those guys
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:23.920]  would see a black armored vehicle roll by with guys in black uniforms and would feel totally
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:27.680]  safe I mean if you don't want to live in a third world country you should be concerned by that
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:34.400]  see that's what gets me concerned but instead
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:44.080]  they're only scared of other slaves having guns and this is the essence of conditioning
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:52.080]  and this is why they went after that sheriff because so many of the laws are written by
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:58.480]  legislatures where they can go after guys they think are criminals but can't prove it to then
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:02.160]  selectively say okay we're going to put you in jail for this gun that's what the law is written
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:06.160]  where you could either say it's criminal or not say it's criminal it's ambiguous you need to change
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:12.560]  that and quite frankly those are racist laws as well after the civil war the some of the south
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:16.720]  areas could not ban the second amendment for black folks so they wrote selective laws
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:23.760]  and so the NRA was formed to train black folks how to use guns so they now get called the
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:30.640]  Ku Klux Klan by Fox Sports and by CNN because they were formed to fight the Klan so they're now
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:36.560]  the Klan see and and if you say that Obamacare will raise the premiums and does not cover
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:40.720]  pre-existing conditions and gets rid of real charity care and waters down medicare and Medicaid
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:51.440]  you are a racist everything is racist brown bags white lines on asphalt is racist uh
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:59.120]  i've actually literally the term uh is well there's a bunch of terms in video but one of them
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:05.600]  is crush the blacks and that's the term digitally for and there's another term for doing stuff with
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:10.320]  different you know colors and contrast and all that and and so now there's talk in the industry
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:15.280]  we better not say that because we don't want to crush black people i mean this is like mental illness
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:20.320]  they're trying to instill in us don't wear a cowboy outfit because uh it it's stereotypical
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:27.840]  against cowboys don't be a geisha girl but but if you want to forcibly sterilize people in africa
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:32.720]  under a un program oh that's fine because see they're the ultimate racist the globalist are
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:39.200]  against basically everybody who isn't them they're the elitist and elitism is against everybody
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:44.000]  who isn't in the club it's tribalism it's gangsterism it's beyond racism and that's why they want to
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:49.600]  divert you from all the real stuff they're doing collectively every american who isn't a globalist
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:53.680]  offshore is going to have to pay the thousands of trillions of fake derivatives we've been signed
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:15:01.600]  on to just like Greece just like spain it's the same deal and notice when when they have a few
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:06.800]  parties that are right-wing criticizing the austerity so is the left in Greece our media
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:13.360]  makes it the racist don't want to pay the bailout in Greece see it's racist if you don't want to have
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:19.040]  seven work seven day work weeks and pay off foreign banks debts that aren't yours it's racist
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:24.480]  so that's just a mindless tool to use against people and the answer is to laugh at these people
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:33.600]  the answer is to say shut up control freak shut up race obsessor shut up shut up
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:41.520]  you want to keep your whole game going i want a culture where we are gangs because humans
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:46.400]  are designed to be in gangs and tribes and groups who are obsessed with liberty and freedom and
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:51.840]  private property and family and prosperity and being honorable you do that you go to the stars
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:57.440]  we buy into this new world order culture of death it's over because it's designed to be a culture
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:03.040]  of death to screw us up to stand down and to think corruption's cool i can't tell you how many losers
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:11.360]  i run into that think that it's fun to cheat somebody my dad used to always tell me this
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:15.040]  there's people that would rather steal a dollar from you than make a million dollars with you
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:23.120]  that it's like winning to them if they can manipulate and cheat you they think that that
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:27.920]  makes them like a winner and that they're advanced or if they can make stuff up or if they can
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:33.920]  say that you're not pure or you're not virtuous that that makes them virtuous it's it's amazing
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:39.360]  the more i learn about mob psychology and clearly the public is degenerating right now
[02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:45.760]  people are either getting more pure more informed more uplifted or they're getting worse
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:51.040]  there is no lukewarm folks there is no middle of the road you're either going to degenerate and go
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:56.080]  straight to hell in a hand basket or you're going to become more enlightened more informed more pure
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:17:01.680]  better and it doesn't mean i'm on some you know high horse about how moral and great i am i choose
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:06.960]  to be moral i choose to be good i choose to be loving because it's so much more empowering
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:12.640]  and fulfilling i'm not up here judging people that do things that are destructive or bad if it's
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:18.400]  to themselves we're all weak we all do stuff we all have desires that probably aren't healthy
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:24.960]  i'm not here judging you i judge those that are consciously evil though and like to hurt people
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:30.160]  that's where i become your enemy that's where i don't i don't like you that's where i think
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:35.600]  about how to beat you all day long because that's the animating contest of liberty and life i'm
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:38.800]  going to take some phone calls ahead of our guests joining us on any subject you wish first time
[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:45.200]  callers 800-25-99-231 what'd you think a sheriff finch they were going to put him in jail for four
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:51.120]  five years for reading the penal code and going well he's done he's not concealed carry out on the
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:56.000]  street i'd have to arrest him he did that i don't agree with the florida law but man he's in his car
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:02.400]  and it says for self-defense or you know in your car i just uh you shouldn't have arrested him what
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:07.440]  are you doing when i hired you here you said you'd follow the constitution we're going to release him
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:15.520]  and this is this is bogus we're going to expunge this any other time a sheriff wanted to do that
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:21.680]  they could no not this time they wanted to throw him under the bus 800-25-99-231 what do you want
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:26.800]  to bet that deputy he ran out of there that's why he went and tattled on him and i love what
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:31.920]  tattletales think just the act of tattling means you're guilty it's like when your neighbor gets
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:36.320]  calls the police do they see you putting a gun in your car to go shooting this is a plague even
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:40.800]  in austin where i live you can be out in the rural area the californian uh you know liberal moves in
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:45.520]  next to you and they see you put your gun in they're going to call the cops and a lot the cops show up
[02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:50.240]  and say we just they felt threatened i'm going to go ahead put your handcuffs right now my chief
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:56.080]  has told me you're like is this america listen we'll let the grand jury sort this out they felt
[02:18:56.080 --> 02:19:01.600]  threatened they said you kind of pointed the rifle at them leon macadoo was out on the street
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:09.120]  this morning wearing fake guns toy toy guns obviously little kid guns on her side to do that
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:12.800]  piece where she's dressed up like the racist cowboy calif you know the colorado school says
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:16.720]  racist dressed like cowboy and she had the guns that she couldn't find any stores because
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:21.120]  because they're hateful after and she had a taxi driver pulled by a steering and then was like
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:25.760]  he was freaked out he pulled over he said are those real guns that she had to say no no no these
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:29.840]  aren't real guns to him she didn't get that part out on air because i was talking over half the time
[02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:35.680]  i mean in austin texas folks if you've got green guns they call the police on you've got nerf guns
[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:41.920]  if it's halloween and a woman's got toy guns that they call the police on i mean they and then
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:47.360]  you have a sane sheriff say we're not gonna arrest people and interpret the penal code improperly
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:51.920]  and throw some guy with no criminal record in jail releasing and they try to put the sheriff in
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:57.280]  jail and the jury said we nullify this fraudulent garbage that's how we take america back that's

[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:16.000]  ahead so uh i'm a long time listener and i've always heard you talking about um hidden messages
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:21.120]  in the video games and social media and stuff like that and um the grand theft auto stuff where they
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:27.840]  talk about the illuminati all the time and a new game just came out sassan's creed for black flag
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:38.400]  and in the game you're sent to look for a a building that allows the templars knights to
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:45.920]  surveil on everybody in the whole world to read their minds and to influence them into doing things
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:53.360]  and it just seems that it's kind of like through these devices they're the they're telling us kind
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:58.880]  of their plan as to what they're as to what they're doing is an assassin's creed or at least some of
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:06.000]  its versions based on the 1770s yeah and there was the last one happened during the uh the
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:12.640]  revolutionary war and a lot of it happened well i mean it's just everywhere but i see two different
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:17.680]  things happening in video games maybe 20 30 percent you're fighting the illuminati in the new world
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:23.760]  order 60 70 percent uh the militias of the enemy you have to torture them you have to rip their
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:29.200]  eyeballs out they're the terrorists uh so i mean yeah it's just all got messaging in it
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:33.840]  but also the illuminati and and covering it is also very popular you know there's stories out
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:38.080]  there that came out a few weeks ago where one of the biggest pickup lines for young girls high
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:43.840]  school and college is you know i'm a member of the illuminati uh and most golden dawn groups
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:49.680]  most so-called illuminati groups they're just con artist groups promising some secret knowledge
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:57.120]  if you become part of their organization uh i mean that's just classic uh you know stuff that's
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:01.360]  going on and really they just want a bunch of minions to work for them as slaves that's what
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:05.920]  cults are all about the only type of cults will really give any power is stuff like skull and bones
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:10.480]  uh or you know groups like that that are really doorways into the real illuminati
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:14.160]  and of course it's a fact skull and bones are internal documents that have been leaked as they
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:20.480]  are a chapter of the uh the barbarian order of the illuminati itself a order that went back to
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:26.480]  egypt and so again this is all public it's in george washington's letters national archives
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:31.360]  it's all a fact people just hear it they go oh that's a rumor you know that's one of these movies
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:38.400]  with uh oh who's the guy coming out with the films that you know jfk was killed by a lone gunman
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:43.040]  the comedian tom hanks whatever that stupid movie is where he's battling the illuminati
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:47.360]  or whatever and then of course the illuminati isn't really real in the movie uh this is what
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:53.280]  they do so they come out with all their disinfo but all the illuminati is is a system of they're
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:59.680]  enlightened you're not it's not actually to bring light to the world it's to bring light they can
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:05.520]  see in the dark just like night vision the owl is their symbol it sees you can't you're dead
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:12.000]  that's the illuminati comes to bring hell and death appreciate your call uh lori in california

[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:31.520]  the insurance commissioner of california passed a whole bunch of new laws or whatever you want to
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:38.000]  call them it has doubled our homeowner's insurance we live in a rural area in northern california
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:44.400]  and it says right on the paperwork that it's to pay for the payouts the insurance companies had
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:51.760]  to do last year for the fires in southern california and nobody's covering it no no that's right and
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:55.680]  of course they tell you that it's 10 times worse they're giving the insurance companies that are
[02:28:55.680 --> 02:29:02.640]  the big six banks fronts on record the the power to shut down all competition in the market restrict
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:07.840]  the quality of payouts you get whether it's medical or a damage to your home or business

[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:26.800]  info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:40.480]  and again on google's main page they have an image of hillary clinton reading
[02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:45.120]  at a computer screen all the live feeds through the nsa as she surveils you
[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:50.160]  you know i'm actually joking it's something else if you go see it to know what i'm talking about
[02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:57.760]  well hey the good news is is the nsa told us that they're not spying on us without warrants and
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:04.800]  that google is not part of the nsa in any way even though government documents leaked by stoden
[02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:09.440]  clearly show that and we've had AT&T executives go public and say all the big telecoms have nsa
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:15.760]  buildings in them or whole floors wired through i mean we know this they just keep acting like uh
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:21.040]  it's not going on so there can never be a debate about it so we just debate whether it exists or
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:25.440]  not and kind of stay on that limbo it's almost like a slow laurus attack the way you attack a
[02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:30.160]  computer server is you just keep asking the same question over and over again and then never
[02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:35.440]  receiving the info so instead they just use this little process game where they just keep denying
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:40.240]  oh there's no problem with the health care website oh there's no nsa spying on you stoden says they
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:46.160]  can spy with 100 certainty with almost no glitches on everything you do but they can't have a website
[02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:53.440]  that works this is amazing now uh derrick conna uh he has written for the washington post uh the
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:59.840]  atlantic uh national review a diverse guy human events and politics he is also a advisor and board
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:07.200]  member of several technology startups and you can follow him at derrick conna uh on twitter and he
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:13.840]  joins us to discuss a organization that he's speaking for one of the groups that has been out
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:20.800]  there uh protesting and also drawing attention to with oliver stone and many others and had that
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:26.480]  rally over the weekend also in dc and other areas to draw attention to this so derrick thank you so
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:30.640]  much for uh your reporting and what you're doing and you're wearing both hats here somebody that
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:35.200]  doesn't want to be spied on illegally that's pretty extreme you may want to apologize on air for that
[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:41.760]  but also as a journalist what do you make of what's happening with uh this end of childhood
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:47.360]  end of naivete as we learn that we are a bigger big brother system than the stasi ever imagined
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:52.720]  so much to talk about where do you want to start with what's been happening
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:36:01.200]  uh wherever you'd like to jump right in well let's get into the uh demonstrations against uh the uh
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:09.680]  the uh nsa and then now the latest revelations by snowden as a reporter yes well you know just
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:15.840]  this weekend we had a a mass protest in washington dc with a real diverse array our coalition had
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:20.640]  you know hundreds of different organizations it was uh you know conservative groups it was
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:25.520]  tea party groups it was libertarian groups and they were progressive groups it was really a wide
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:31.600]  swath of americans who came out to protest and you know right in front of the capital we presented
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:40.160]  570 000 signatures from the american people uh so that was a great success uh and you know just uh
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:44.960]  you know yesterday with the new snowden exposures we learned that apparently our own government is
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:51.920]  hacking into american technology companies uh which is uh quite incredible um that you can say with a
[02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:57.040]  straight face that uh you know this is somehow acceptable behavior to be uh hacking into you
[02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:01.520]  know google and yahoo and uh who knows what other companies they've hacked into as well
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:07.440]  and that's just to make sure they're already complying with all the spying and and and feeds
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:13.360]  and all these companies being paid billions it turns out a year one way or another uh when they go
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:20.560]  uh spy on their customers and basically give the data without warrants to the feds yeah it it seems
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:27.280]  a little bit uh duplicate uh um uh you know um a whole bunch of this data uh you know why do they
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:32.800]  need to gain access to it again but the the real impact here is if you're a foreign foreign entity
[02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:36.800]  why would you do business with these companies uh you know they already know that there's these
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:41.120]  back doors built in the system at the stands of encryption and watered down there's a real
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:47.360]  impact upon american business abroad that shouldn't be discounted here in addition to the the real
[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:52.480]  concerns for civil liberties well that's right i mean companies always spy on each other uh people
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:57.120]  always try to steal ideas that's one of the biggest problems in companies is you hire people and they
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:01.440]  always try to go take your customers in your operation and go do it themselves and then act
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:07.040]  like it's no big deal uh when it's uh theft and and now people need to know that when they come to
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:12.240]  business here or even abroad with these us-based companies they are being spied on and it's being
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:18.480]  given to insiders uh this is this is bank robbery this is fraud uh and they're trying to hide it in
[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:22.720]  plain view what do you make of feinstein coming out and saying that when they surveil somebody
[02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:27.920]  without a warrant it's not surveillance well first of all i don't know if we have any any evidence
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:32.240]  to say the nsa has turned over data to private companies and in the way that you're saying so
[02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:37.840]  i'd be interested in the report that you're you're you're mentioning uh but feinstein it's it's pretty
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:42.080]  incredible actually because people in congress are starting to get the memo that the american people
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:45.680]  actually care about the fourth amendment they actually cared about civil liberties they actually
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:50.560]  don't think the nsa should be spying on everybody except for diane feinstein and uh you know sharon
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:54.560]  rogers you know the intelligence committee but feinstein somehow doesn't have a problem with the
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:59.520]  nsa spying on american citizens but she does have a really big problem with the nsa spying
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:04.880]  on other citizens it's like it's very confusing um and that's what's come out this week is she's
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:08.960]  saying you know obama is spying on foreign leaders what's going on with that we need to deal with
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:13.360]  that i wasn't aware of that um you know but why does she have no issue with spying on american
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:19.120]  citizens um she seems to have not read the the constitution has no real concern for civil liberties
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:22.880]  and you know unrestricted searches of american citizens which you know the intelligence committee
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:28.080]  has known has been ongoing for a long time and part of the irony was that there is a world before
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:33.840]  the intelligence committees and then you know in the 60s and 70s we find out about mass surveillance
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:39.440]  on american citizens at the time what we thought was mass being used to really stifle political
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:45.200]  dissent being used against mom with their king and other uh people of the time and uh you know
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:49.120]  congress was fed up with it the american people were fed up with it the church and pike committee
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:53.520]  said we're going to create a whole new entity within congress specifically with the purpose of
[02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:58.160]  protecting civil liberties from american citizens to ensure that the nsa in particular
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:04.880]  does not wiretap americans and then the intelligence committees 30 years later um 40 years later
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:08.400]  those same entities that were created for this very purpose of overseeing the intelligence
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:12.720]  branch is running around telling members of congress there's nothing to see here move along
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:19.040]  it's it's pretty ironic well that's a great point darryl let me ask you this because you're
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:24.080]  obviously also worked for the house republican study committee where you manage technology
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:29.760]  defense and government oversight policy issues you've got a wide ranging understanding at this
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:37.200]  also as a fellow with Yale laws information a society project with the political establishment
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:42.320]  are they getting the fact that the jig is up and that and that we're not just going to be lectured
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:47.200]  that it's no big deal to be spied on and it's no big deal to have privacy and it's
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:52.960]  no big deal to have more surveillance in the soviet union uh or are they digging in i mean what's
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:57.280]  what's the sense of this was a football game pro liberty you know folks are coming together
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:00.880]  that's got to scare the establishment across the political spectrum what's happening in the
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:07.040]  establishment itself though it's interesting as the in the in the amash amendment there is
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:12.480]  real chaos uh when they started to realize that the amash amendment was actually going to pass
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:16.560]  and they scrounge together enough votes to secure it from passing the amash amendment would have
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:22.240]  essentially defunded some of this flying american citizens that failed by seven members of congress
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:27.600]  because of an 11th hour push by leadership and by the establishment to really stop it but without
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:32.560]  that it probably would have passed and the amash amendment there was only seven minutes on the
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:39.840]  floor to argue in favor of it um and it really showed that real backlash that real scare in this
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:45.120]  situation you know the momentum has continued to grow since the amash amendment and now we're
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:50.080]  seeing members of the establishment actually endorse the legislation that came out by sentin
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:56.400]  renner is on board that legislation he was one of the members who voted against the amash amendment
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:42:00.960]  and i was now supporting this bill which shows that the establishment is starting to be on board
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:05.920]  um not saying that their license per se the establishment but he is part of the uh the
[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:11.280]  structure of the house uh so this is a very different dynamic now i think this legislation
[02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:17.120]  is going to pass but the real question is once this legislation passes and the air is kind of out
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:21.440]  of the balloon is congress going to sit back and say we took care of that problem or are they going
[02:42:21.440 --> 02:42:26.720]  to realize wait a second this doesn't actually solve all the issues at hand even if let's say for
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:32.400]  example that the nsa legislation actually solves the problem of the nsa spying on american citizens
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:37.840]  directly and that they actually follow that legislation two big ifs even if so there's no
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:44.400]  restriction on them obtaining data from british intelligence or israeli intelligence or canadian
[02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:48.080]  intelligence or new zealand intelligence and we know there's a whole kind of consortium between
[02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:52.960]  these these entities but you know 14 different intelligence blocks and so if the nsa is not
[02:42:52.960 --> 02:42:57.520]  legally allowed to do it but they are and you just trade the data this isn't rocket science in fact
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:43:02.000]  that's what they've done for the past 30 years so if you're not actually addressing that issue
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:06.240]  you're not actually getting to you know the kind of the back doors that we've already seen them use
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:11.520]  i mean essentially so far if you close the front door they go into the back door the side door you
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:16.480]  need a real comprehensive solution here and part of the end problem is not just going after terrorism
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:21.680]  we know that it's being turned over to the dea turned over to the doj how is this information
[02:43:21.680 --> 02:43:25.360]  going to be used in prosecutions in the future that can actually be dealt with through affirmative
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:30.480]  law now derrick conna again writes for forbs you name it he joins us there's a bit of delay
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:35.840]  on his uh on his skype there's a few awkward moments there that's what's happening uh but
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:40.400]  he is joining us making a lot of great points here i want to ask you i want to ask you this question
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:46.800]  because you brought up the fact uh that well you don't know there's evidence that
[02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:51.840]  that the nsa itself is giving data to private corporations and i know you're been up there
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:58.400]  on capitol hill so you're informed what they do is they fence it through the 100 plus 800 plus
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:04.480]  thousand but 100 plus companies private companies they admit and some of the nsa public briefings
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:11.680]  to congress and the 800 plus thousand top security clearance um data miners and people
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:16.720]  that work in these companies government and private companies they then fence it as data
[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:21.680]  kind of through groups like stratford that's based here in austin texas and then a and then
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:27.200]  attend groups like bill bergen things they are getting that data from what we've seen in leaks
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:34.080]  and info and it is being pilfered out and it's the opposite of security having having thousands of
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:40.000]  companies with partial access to nsa data over 100 with heavy access and then all these stratford
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:48.320]  type groups that are then used as the as the diaphragm uh almost like reverse osmosis to
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:54.720]  then transmit this data out but also tame it and mix their political view into it you see what i'm
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:45:00.720]  saying if you have data to that effect i would like to see it i think that would be uh even more
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:04.720]  of a scandal because what they're being told in capitol hill is that this is all for terrorism
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:10.080]  purposes uh so if the data is actually being sold or being given to commercial entities for commercial
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:15.440]  reasons um i think that's another level of a scandal well that's the i mean for me that's
[02:45:15.440 --> 02:45:21.520]  the real scandal do you know wane madson is a former nsa uh individual i don't know i will
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:27.120]  get you in contact with wane madson he can he can give you a lot of the info on it uh i can i
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:31.760]  guess we need to write more articles about this and just show how this works what these private
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:35.600]  companies are doing i mean you know about the total information awareness network of admiral
[02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:41.120]  point extra that then went private in 2002 and then you've got all these private groups for
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:47.680]  their own intelligence agencies they've been kitty in to the overall intelligence troll and
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:53.200]  really it's just a bunch of uh propaganda really it's not even really info it just turns into a
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:59.760]  bunch of bull basically you see what i'm talking about sure i i just need to see more data on the
[02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:03.760]  commercial aspect i was unaware you bet well i will i will dig through some of that and send
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:07.440]  it to you and i'm not even specifically saying that you know strat for itself is involved in
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:12.960]  all this i'm saying that's an example of a group that we know gets quote humed and other sources
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:17.760]  and then sends it back and forth between all the groups i mean you know the i mean you're certainly
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:22.640]  aware on capitol hill about all the different agencies and then private groups that have access
[02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:28.720]  to intelligence in some cases um yes i mean there are a number of companies where they
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:34.080]  have members of intelligence clearances to allegedly to deal with cyber threats in particular
[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:39.360]  sure well listen other points you think are important to make that are on your radar screen
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:44.240]  as a journalist that's researching this we had Wayne madson on a few days ago and he said the
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:47.760]  it will break that they're spying on the pope and then two days later it happened so we always
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:53.680]  love to have journalists on who have their ear to the ground what should we be looking for
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:58.320]  as far as the ground game in congress sure i mean i'm just a reporter all the stuff you're
[02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:04.000]  working on what else is hot well i'm really focusing on kind of the dynamic in congress
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:08.000]  who you know i'm more of an activist than i am a journalist i'm trying to get members of congress
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:13.360]  up to speed on some of these issues but i think we're we're gonna see some really heated congressional
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:18.720]  hearings i think a perfectly legitimate question for any member of congress to ask is has the nsa
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:23.840]  ever spied on me and what data do you have um i would love to see someone like keep alexander
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:28.720]  address that question in an open hearing and be forced to provide every member of congress with
[02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:34.320]  their file um if the nsa has data on that on that person i think that would really change the minds
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:39.760]  of a number of these members um i think there's gonna be more uh presentation of what the term
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:45.840]  metadata actually means uh because that's kind of been a you know uh uh something that the intelligence
[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:50.080]  committee keeps on telling people this is just in metadata uh their definition of metadata is quite
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:55.280]  broad and metadata can really be almost almost anything i mean the subject of an email it's
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:59.760]  metadata the websites you visited are metadata and within metadata you can determine quite a lot
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:06.000]  um so it's really an information campaign um now i i i don't think the intelligence committee
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:11.600]  bills the the roger's bill or the fine sign bill is really going to gather steam i think the real
[02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:16.240]  game in town is going to be the sensenbrenner bill which just from a political coalition aspect
[02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:23.600]  you know sensenbrenner patrick lehue introduced this bill amazingly enough wrote the patriot act wow
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:28.400]  it's just an incredible thing because both of them wrote the patriot act said the patriot act
[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:32.800]  couldn't be used for mass surveillance the nsa used it for mass surveillance and now they're trying
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:37.280]  to write a bill to essentially say almost for exactly what they had already intended the patriot
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:42.800]  act to be but yet somehow people are wondering if that thing's going to actually pass um you know
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:48.720]  only in the crazy world of washington dc is that the case well undoubtedly people are waking up
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:54.480]  and there's major resistance building and i think team liberty team privacy is starting to win do
[02:48:54.480 --> 02:49:00.720]  you agree with that absolutely all right for civil liberties all right well darrett conna thank you
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:05.760]  so much for joining us and keep up the good work thanks for having me on god bless all right folks
[02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:12.160]  very exciting uh to see uh that there's real movement in congress to start defunding it
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:17.440]  and the surest way to deal with people that are violating your rights is to defund them
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:20.960]  the problem is homeland security is basically said there'll be more terror attacks if you
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:24.960]  don't let us do this and then meanwhile they're running al-qaeda and libya and syria and everywhere
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:29.680]  else you know i'm always amazed with journalists and activists though the fact that still there's
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:36.800]  such a wide swath of this stuff that even even activists and experts don't really know how bad
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:41.840]  it really is i'm gonna ask wane madson to write us an article about examples of data uh that's
[02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:47.120]  being called uh being used i mean i mean here's an example if google's getting masked data off
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:50.960]  index corporations and what they're surfing and what they're doing and what they're selling
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:55.920]  and their reports and reading gmail imagine all that intelligence that's then put in the aggregate
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:50:02.160]  and dumped i mean there's so many examples and they do it via contracts people sign to use those
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:07.600]  systems so it's not even really illegal see they've just kind of mainline this so while we're busy
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:12.160]  worrying about the nsa they're doing this through the corporate systems to everybody that's the

[02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:49.200]  there are citizens being snatched off the streets of austin texas in broad daylight the culprits
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:55.920]  offer them a cigarette within 10 feet of the city ordinance business zone once that cigarette is
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:56:00.640]  lit or they at least put it in their mouth they're zip tied and thrown into the back of a van
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:06.480]  who are these culprits these kidnappers they're the austin police department and it's called
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:10.320]  entrapment as i was sitting there waiting i noticed two plainclothes gentlemen that
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:14.480]  struck me as odd not from their demeanor but simply from their footwear which was military
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:20.160]  combat boots um i initially knew something was wrong whenever they paced back and forth countless
[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:24.000]  numbers of times fumbling with their cigarette packs in which they never pulled one out to smoke
[02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:29.120]  as if they wanted me to ask them or if it's either offering without even saying the words
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:36.320]  a young lady came out of the starbucks location behind us and she simply stood next to me these
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:42.240]  men did the same exact thing that they did to me but to her in which she you know fell victim and
[02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:48.000]  asked for one may i have a cigarette he obliged gave it to her and as soon as he walked away two
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:52.880]  or three seconds later the patty wagon is pulling up there's three uh bicycle policemen they're
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:58.960]  arresting her when she asked them what am i being arrested for they tell her you know what you did
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:04.400]  you know what you did and in both instances when i saw this happen twice there was never a single
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:10.240]  miranda right red period and when asked both times why they were being detained they were giving no
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:15.440]  clear answers of why they were being arrested whatsoever as far as the uh the packs of cigarettes
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:18.880]  live undercover officers here downtown and the person will go and and hold open the back
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:22.880]  cigarettes or hold the top open then hold them out and when the person comes over to get one
[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:28.000]  if they uh if they ask her anything like is this okay or give any indication like that a question
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:34.320]  or or a query um they're they're taking it for aggressive uh solicitation been quite a few
[02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:39.520]  incidents as far as witnessing personally there's been twice all repeated efforts to speak with
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:44.560]  a public information officer regarding these eyewitness reports of blatant entrapment were delayed
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:50.880]  i was finally given this cryptic explanation of the violations via email so as we get poorer and
[02:57:50.880 --> 02:57:55.920]  the rich get richer and they manhattanize our urban dwellings into their own little playpen

[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:14.640]  down as a crime and funneling billions of dollars of drug money for mexican cartels only gets you

[03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:04.320]  to get him to go to the rally and he says texas is not open carry so people everywhere they just
[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:10.400]  don't know what's going on and they just believe all of the the lies well that's how every day
[03:02:10.400 --> 03:02:16.400]  without looking i see news articles local news articles because gun sites post them where it's
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:23.040]  always the same it's always like some 75 year old man is going to take their gun to the gunsmith it
[03:02:23.040 --> 03:02:27.440]  happens a lot during deer season and the neighbors call the cops and they arrest them and take their
[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:34.080]  gun and the gun's totally legal and juries convict them and say well you meant as someone they saw
[03:02:34.080 --> 03:02:38.800]  the gun they felt frightened they'll put the californian woman on the on the stand who's moved
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:45.440]  to texas they'll slam the gavel down the old man will go to prison they rule this country now
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:49.360]  and if they call the cops the cops do it and they put in their california police chiefs
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:53.920]  like our deserveta and all every freedom imaginable burns to the ground go ahead
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:59.760]  what seems like though we're gonna have to make our stand and maybe texas in arizona it's just
[03:02:59.760 --> 03:03:06.240]  getting so crazy i feel like i have a a bullseye i got a a neighbor next door that's got a don't
[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:11.760]  tread on me a flag and an american flag and across the street and i got one and i got an
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:19.040]  import sticker on my my mailbox and uh you just feel like you you know that just every other person
[03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:26.400]  out here is uh asleep and they have no idea about anything that uh that we talk about i was about
[03:03:26.400 --> 03:03:32.000]  to say that you know after california fully collapses then it'll probably be a pretty good
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:35.680]  state because then we will they'll all come to texas that's how it works historically
[03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:40.080]  then we're gonna have to run to california and then when we go there that work all the
[03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:44.640]  parasites government and others are gonna move there and then it's basically history is about
[03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:49.680]  running from vampires so a bunch of people ran from europe away from vampires they came over the
[03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:55.360]  vampires ran over enslaved them the blacks and the indians but also regular citizens were enslaved
[03:03:55.360 --> 03:04:02.480]  uh you know british citizens white folks you name it indentured servitude press gangs you name it and
[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:07.120]  then you just have to run run run because anywhere you go build anything the parasites show up say
[03:04:07.120 --> 03:04:12.560]  that's theirs and they first show up say be nice to me i want to be friends and the minute you turn
[03:04:12.560 --> 03:04:17.440]  your they go turn the weapon and i'll feel safer the minute they get the weapon you know it's it's
[03:04:17.440 --> 03:04:22.480]  you know what happens it's it's forced labor camps and they're in potbellied black uniforms
[03:04:22.480 --> 03:04:28.000]  raping your wife i mean that's that's how this works historically it's but it's ruled by pbp
[03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:34.320]  and you know what a pbp is all right sir god bless you we'll welcome you here in san antonio

[03:09:14.560 --> 03:09:23.200]  says that nsa script uh advised officials to inject 9-11 as a talking point to justify
[03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:28.080]  mass surveillance yeah we know why you guys did 9-11 was to kill the republic and you run al-qaeda
[03:09:28.080 --> 03:09:34.240]  filth you're a foreign globalist operation pro-gun sheriff found not guilty good news on that front
[03:09:34.240 --> 03:09:38.640]  of defending the second amendment united nations to destroy property rights of thousands around
[03:09:38.640 --> 03:09:45.360]  the alamo and i want to get to that first before your calls because there's no exaggeration i haven't
[03:09:45.360 --> 03:09:50.320]  had time to watch them all but it looks like there's 10 tv reports or more it's like six or seven
[03:09:50.320 --> 03:09:55.040]  this morning and now there's a bunch of others saying i'm a complete liar and kit daniels is
[03:09:55.040 --> 03:10:03.200]  full of baloney uh or full of obama full of lies and uh just on and on and on just like they say
[03:10:03.200 --> 03:10:07.760]  they're not buying bullets or that you know that they don't get rid of pre-existing conditions of
[03:10:07.760 --> 03:10:12.720]  course they they they kick you off if you have those under obama care or that wouldn't increase
[03:10:12.720 --> 03:10:18.400]  your premiums or you wouldn't be kicked off well now they're saying i'm a liar again and we actually
[03:10:18.400 --> 03:10:23.200]  have the headline in fact where is that news article i just had it here in front of me uh but
[03:10:23.200 --> 03:10:32.320]  it's basically alex jones uh is uh wrong and alex jones is bad and alex jones is incorrect it was a
[03:10:32.320 --> 03:10:37.360]  shocking headline and we can have one of the guys pull it up as i just had it here in my stack like
[03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:44.480]  20 minutes ago uh and never got to it uh from the local uh tv station down in san antonio but
[03:10:44.480 --> 03:10:50.480]  let's just go ahead and go to the news reporter it is alex jones alamo rumor is not true and they
[03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:57.440]  go on to say it's it's true that the un's going to give it the world heritage site designation
[03:10:57.440 --> 03:11:01.680]  and we have the documents on our site showing that it's not going to let you build around the area
[03:11:01.680 --> 03:11:07.280]  and control things just like if you go sign an agreement to have your land turned into a wildlife
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:14.160]  preserve they have nature conservancy and others will pay you in zones next to rockefeller and
[03:11:14.160 --> 03:11:18.240]  other property to increase the value of their property they tell you it's for the earth and all
[03:11:18.240 --> 03:11:23.200]  the rest of it to turn your land into say a nature preserve but then you don't have the
[03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:31.200]  rights to your property anymore and that's what this is in a giant seven square mile area officially
[03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:37.280]  from the un agreement with the city of san antonio and they don't want this screwed up so their answer
[03:11:37.280 --> 03:11:42.720]  is to say i'm full of horse pucky we'll go to info wars dot com and read the article united
[03:11:42.720 --> 03:11:48.240]  nations to destroy property rights of thousands around the alamo part two of the story they say
[03:11:48.240 --> 03:11:54.560]  went viral due to my evil it oh it's so horrible congress looked into the two billion bullets
[03:11:54.560 --> 03:12:00.320]  and the paper targets of children homeland security and saw that it was true so so so so see
[03:12:00.320 --> 03:12:05.040]  it's all true but i'm discredited so let's go ahead and go to this piece and analyze it here it is
[03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:10.800]  tonight i want to follow up briefly on that rumor we reported earlier about the alamo being taken
[03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:16.960]  over by the united nations again it is not true but it also happened to blow up on the web after
[03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:22.640]  a couple of things that involve a certain internet talk radio host these globalists they are the
[03:12:22.640 --> 03:12:28.400]  usurpers that have come into our country and taken over they are the occupiers they have captured our
[03:12:28.400 --> 03:12:34.720]  nation now that is that is alex jones at that pro-gun rally at the alamo recently now he is a
[03:12:34.720 --> 03:12:38.720]  conspiracy theorist who has said he believes the u.s. government is responsible for both the
[03:12:38.720 --> 03:12:44.560]  oklahoma city bombing and the 9-11 attacks he posted video of his speech here on his info wars
[03:12:44.560 --> 03:12:50.640]  dot com site and today he talked about a story on that site kit daniels uh i was told about this
[03:12:50.640 --> 03:12:54.240]  by the texas land commissioner jerry paterson heard him talking about at the alamo he was
[03:12:54.240 --> 03:12:59.680]  got an open carry rally we looked into it and it's worse than what we were first told the city of
[03:12:59.680 --> 03:13:06.080]  san antonio was looking to turn most of the city over to united nations it's into 21 world heritage
[03:13:06.080 --> 03:13:11.440]  heritage site management all right he apparently believes there that the city would have to turn
[03:13:11.440 --> 03:13:16.160]  over control because it's close to the alamo which would be under the control whatever
[03:13:16.160 --> 03:13:20.560]  paterson again today the land commissioner said it's all horse hockey and my point here
[03:13:20.560 --> 03:13:25.360]  isn't about jones or the rumor but it's one i made here last week after that first ever rally
[03:13:25.360 --> 03:13:31.600]  that was allowed on the alamo grounds the land commission has no specific policy on who can
[03:13:31.600 --> 03:13:38.080]  and can't hold rallies there and right now the man in charge of deciding is a politician paterson
[03:13:38.080 --> 03:13:42.960]  that is the issue whether you think that should be the case or not let me know what you think on
[03:13:42.960 --> 03:13:47.440]  facebook we'll error some of your thoughts tomorrow and by the way alex jones if you are
[03:13:47.440 --> 03:13:56.000]  looking for more publicity for your website you're welcome talk about delusional i mean these guys
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:14:01.040]  san antonio and that channel i'm sure does have hundreds of thousands that watch it but i mean
[03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:08.320]  if i'm looking for publicity i'm welcome like i'm pathetic the whole thing is meant to impeach
[03:14:08.320 --> 03:14:14.640]  our credibility you can go to info wars dot com and see the treaty the congressional hearings
[03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:19.680]  the kentucky legislative hearings where they banned it saying no it does wave our sovereignty
[03:14:19.680 --> 03:14:24.400]  and does control land because it's not just the land that it's on it's buffer zones now this one's
[03:14:24.400 --> 03:14:28.880]  only seven square miles in one agreement it's the whole city and oh here's the thing there's
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:33.120]  buffer zones around each one of the zones that that's the point it's not just the alamo which was a
[03:14:33.120 --> 03:14:38.720]  mission it's the other four missions that are beautiful by the way their active catholic churches
[03:14:38.720 --> 03:14:42.480]  i'm not even catholic but i go down there and check them out and go see them they're so beautiful
[03:14:42.480 --> 03:14:49.680]  i recommend that people do it this is all going under un control so so notice he doesn't deny
[03:14:49.680 --> 03:14:56.800]  that it's a world heritage site agreement with the city and on screen we have the unesco
[03:14:56.800 --> 03:15:03.520]  treaty ratified by congress back in the 70s and by the way you know the first director general
[03:15:03.520 --> 03:15:08.320]  of unesco was i'm not even going to tell you it's so hard it's all the suxley's brother folks he was
[03:15:08.320 --> 03:15:15.040]  a transhumanist eugenicist we have literally how many links one two punch this article up for
[03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:23.920]  tv viewers guys one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
[03:15:24.960 --> 03:15:31.280]  fourteen links documenting what this does when you shine it over that the un has control
[03:15:33.600 --> 03:15:37.680]  and i heard people asking cherry patterns he says well it will be a un designation will bring
[03:15:37.680 --> 03:15:41.600]  tourism but they won't have control the state will still have the property that's true but he said
[03:15:41.600 --> 03:15:46.240]  there is some concerns that we think it's good for tourism i said that they took it out of context
[03:15:46.240 --> 03:15:51.520]  then they run to jerry patterson and go look he says you said this he's like horse pocky he's not a
[03:15:51.520 --> 03:15:58.560]  bad guy but this is what this does okay and they have to agree let me show people on info wars.com
[03:15:58.560 --> 03:16:01.840]  if you're a tv viewer ready illiterate just go to the article you know out of nations to destroy
[03:16:01.840 --> 03:16:12.000]  property rights of thousands around alamo there and we have a link to it there is the map of the seven
[03:16:13.280 --> 03:16:18.560]  square miles in their words around the alamo where they can't do new building and can restrict
[03:16:18.560 --> 03:16:27.680]  everything and then it goes through and shows all the other areas and this is so front we have links
[03:16:27.680 --> 03:16:34.800]  to the official deal with the city and the 1972 treaty and by the way it says no arms no arms
[03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:41.600]  citizens are allowed in the area we just dug that up and look at finally launch here's a san
[03:16:41.600 --> 03:16:47.120]  antonio missions page i actually found that where they admit they're going under unesco here it is
[03:16:47.120 --> 03:16:57.120]  right here yeah i've been in that little church right there my grandfather my mother's father who
[03:16:57.120 --> 03:17:01.760]  was the guy that hardly you know talked about personal stuff told my dad he had one of the only
[03:17:01.760 --> 03:17:06.480]  mystical experiences ever at that particular mission i forget the name of it he was just down
[03:17:06.480 --> 03:17:13.920]  there working one day and decided to go there and have his lunch anyway side issue uh the whole point
[03:17:13.920 --> 03:17:20.480]  is is that is that i live here i have family that fought the text revolution i know all about unesco
[03:17:20.480 --> 03:17:24.800]  all about the un i've been to these missions over and over again i know what the treaty does
[03:17:24.800 --> 03:17:30.720]  i have the agreement with the state of texas and the daughters of public texas and it does
[03:17:30.720 --> 03:17:36.160]  make it under uh un auspices just like a land deal with any other group or organization we're
[03:17:36.160 --> 03:17:41.760]  going to skip this network break coming up and then they have to have both the host of the show
[03:17:41.760 --> 03:17:49.760]  laugh at me and imply that i want publicity so i'm making stuff up listen you guys are the people
[03:17:49.760 --> 03:17:54.560]  that work for the mainstream media and you pick up those national news feeds that are state run
[03:17:54.560 --> 03:18:00.240]  media and regurgitate them off your teleprompter with those news packages and last time i checked
[03:18:00.960 --> 03:18:06.880]  you can go to alexa.com and check info wars.com versus your local news station i'm guessing my
[03:18:06.880 --> 03:18:13.440]  website let me just wild guess here is probably five thousand times bigger than yours so it's you
[03:18:14.400 --> 03:18:19.840]  hoping that i talk about you and you're just one media outlet i've chosen to do that all the others
[03:18:19.840 --> 03:18:25.280]  together the ten plus tv stations in dallas and austin and santonio attacking me the newspapers
[03:18:25.280 --> 03:18:30.160]  together you guys do send me some new listeners it's true very small compared to what we do in
[03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:35.440]  other ways but it's true and so i will give you a treat out of the whole group and give you what
[03:18:35.440 --> 03:18:40.880]  you actually did and then they'll beg and take this piece and play it begging for more but
[03:18:41.520 --> 03:18:47.120]  i'm not sure if you'll get any more so the truth is that you're doing what you're accusing me of
[03:18:47.120 --> 03:18:55.200]  doing dumbo i have been offered repeatedly more money than you'll make in your whole life in one
[03:18:55.200 --> 03:19:02.720]  year to join the establishment dumb but and so for you to sit there and imply that i come up
[03:19:02.720 --> 03:19:09.440]  without rages headlines and information because i want to make money is absolute total bull

[03:22:27.680 --> 03:22:34.640]  bunch of glitter bugs up there on television a bunch of narcissistic cowards you know if you
[03:22:34.640 --> 03:22:38.160]  told the truth about the alamo fat ass you know you wouldn't have that job anymore
[03:22:41.600 --> 03:22:45.200]  this is why i shouldn't be on into a fourth hour it's why i quit doing a fourth hour years ago i
[03:22:45.200 --> 03:22:51.520]  start really acting like i really act and i am like a goblin like pirate or something sometimes

[03:22:56.640 --> 03:22:59.760]  know when they're trying to manipulate something we don't do that or we try to take the truth
[03:22:59.760 --> 03:23:04.800]  of what it is the essence and show it and be nuanced and show you both sides when there are two sides
[03:23:04.800 --> 03:23:12.240]  or three sides you it's so frustrating to see a piece written to deceive their audience it just
[03:23:12.240 --> 03:23:16.960]  makes me want to absolutely you know what it makes me want to do i mean i've had enough man i've had
[03:23:16.960 --> 03:23:22.960]  enough of fake men strutting around trying to act like they've bettered better men when they're
[03:23:22.960 --> 03:23:26.640]  cowardly pieces of trash benedict Arnold's okay excuse me i'm gonna stop right there
[03:23:29.680 --> 03:23:34.160]  by the way i'm gonna deliver jerry paterson all the documents and then if he doesn't come out
[03:23:34.160 --> 03:23:40.560]  and admit that this does put it under partial u n control in lanyush i'm not gonna support
[03:23:40.560 --> 03:23:46.640]  jerry paterson anymore texas land commissioner because i've had enough of this baloney for all
[03:23:46.640 --> 03:23:50.720]  i know though there's no video of paterson saying that there's a press release by a staff maybe he
[03:23:50.720 --> 03:23:55.600]  didn't even put it out it patterns that came out and said this is very low restriction to get the
[03:23:55.600 --> 03:24:00.400]  u n designation and i think it will bring texas culture to more people about the great fight
[03:24:00.400 --> 03:24:05.840]  for liberty and the right self-defense so i think it's a good cost benefit trade-off uh if they
[03:24:05.840 --> 03:24:12.240]  don't try to expand the u n control in the future i'd say hmm put it to a referendum of the people
[03:24:12.240 --> 03:24:18.640]  of san antonio i respect jerry paterson that's the real statesman response not well we want this
[03:24:18.640 --> 03:24:22.000]  designation this could probably bring 20 million dollars the 30 million dollars you know as the
[03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:26.880]  report says in a san antonio a year we need the tourism this guy's telling people this is going
[03:24:26.880 --> 03:24:30.720]  on because his losers are concerned so he had a report on it let's just say the guy's a liar
[03:24:31.760 --> 03:24:35.120]  let's just let's just you know in the old days you come tell somebody they're a liar and they're
[03:24:35.120 --> 03:24:40.880]  not a liar you're gonna have to back it up you call me a throwback all day long but i don't lie
[03:24:40.880 --> 03:24:46.240]  folks i do my best only tell my lies that my wife asks if something looks good and it doesn't look
[03:24:46.240 --> 03:24:50.720]  good i've learned she doesn't really you know all women are like this she doesn't really want to
[03:24:50.720 --> 03:24:55.840]  know if it looks good she just wants me to say it looks good so i guess i do go honey that looks
[03:24:55.840 --> 03:24:59.520]  great my wife looks great anything she's in but you know what i mean some things look better than
[03:24:59.520 --> 03:25:11.200]  others now let us go to john bounds report that he filed where it is now illegal to take a cigarette
[03:25:11.200 --> 03:25:18.320]  from someone in austin texas and the police say that uh they will not give us any details on exactly
[03:25:18.320 --> 03:25:23.040]  what is going on here talk about a police state here it is according to eyewitness reports there
[03:25:23.040 --> 03:25:28.080]  are citizens being snatched off the streets of austin texas in broad daylight the culprits
[03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:34.800]  offer them a cigarette within 10 feet of the city ordinance business zone once that cigarette is
[03:25:34.800 --> 03:25:39.440]  lit or they at least put it in their mouth they're zip tied and thrown in the back of a van
[03:25:39.440 --> 03:25:45.280]  who are these culprits these kidnappers they are the austin police department and it's called
[03:25:45.280 --> 03:25:49.120]  entrapment as i was sitting there waiting i noticed two plain clothes gentlemen that
[03:25:49.120 --> 03:25:53.280]  struck me as odd not from their demeanor but simply from their footwear which was military
[03:25:53.280 --> 03:25:58.960]  combat boots um i initially knew something was wrong whenever they paced back and forth countless
[03:25:58.960 --> 03:26:03.360]  numbers of times fumbling with their cigarette packs in which they never pulled one out to smoke
[03:26:03.360 --> 03:26:07.920]  as if they wanted me to ask them or if it's they're offering without even saying the words
[03:26:07.920 --> 03:26:15.120]  a young lady came out of the starbucks location behind us and she simply stood next to me these
[03:26:15.120 --> 03:26:20.880]  men did the same exact thing that they did to me but to her in which she you know fell victim
[03:26:20.880 --> 03:26:26.640]  and asked for one may i have a cigarette he obliged gave it to her and as soon as he walked away
[03:26:26.640 --> 03:26:31.440]  two or three seconds later the patty wagon is pulling up there's three uh bicycle policemen
[03:26:31.440 --> 03:26:37.120]  they're arresting her when she asked them what am i being arrested for they tell her you know what
[03:26:37.120 --> 03:26:42.960]  you did you know what you did and in both instances when i saw this happen twice there was never a
[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:48.400]  single Miranda right red period and when asked both times why they were being detained they were
[03:26:48.400 --> 03:26:54.000]  giving no clear answers of why they were being arrested whatsoever as far as the uh the packs
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:57.680]  cigarettes law of undercover officers here downtown and the person will go and hold open the back
[03:26:57.680 --> 03:27:01.680]  cigarettes or hold the top open then hold them out and when the person comes over to get one
[03:27:01.680 --> 03:27:06.720]  if they uh if they ask her anything like is this okay or give any indication like that a question
[03:27:06.720 --> 03:27:13.120]  or or a query um they're they're taking it for aggressive uh solicitation been cried a few
[03:27:13.120 --> 03:27:18.400]  incidents as far as when is it personally there's been twice all repeated efforts to speak with a
[03:27:18.400 --> 03:27:23.360]  public information officer regarding these eyewitness reports of blatant entrapment were delayed
[03:27:23.360 --> 03:27:29.600]  i was finally given this cryptic explanation of the violations via email so as we get poorer
[03:27:29.600 --> 03:27:34.720]  and the rich get richer and they manhattan eyes are urban dwellings into their own little playpen
[03:27:34.720 --> 03:27:40.560]  the banks go unnoticed every major outlet is reporting that they are funneling drug money
[03:27:40.560 --> 03:27:47.120]  through their pesky little hands so why is it that humanity is on trial why is it that sitting down
[03:27:47.120 --> 03:27:53.440]  is a crime and funneling billions of dollars of drug money for mexican cartels only gets you
[03:27:53.440 --> 03:28:00.400]  a slap on the wrist people get tired so they sit down i mean yeah we panhandle out here but
