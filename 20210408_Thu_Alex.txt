[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  It's Thursday, April 8th, the year of 2021.
[00:07.000 --> 00:13.000]  The public, President Joe Biden is out for a call for all those as we speak.
[00:13.000 --> 00:15.000]  He is lying.
[00:15.000 --> 00:16.000]  He comes to you for words.
[00:16.000 --> 00:17.000]  He comes to you for words.
[00:17.000 --> 00:18.000]  He comes to you for words.
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  He is lying.
[00:19.000 --> 00:37.000]  Well, our republic was founded in 1776 when the Red Codes came to take the guns.
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.000]  And history is repeating itself again right now.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  Biden just started speaking about 60 seconds ago.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  Let's go to the illegitimate puppet president who's destroying our borders and highlighting
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  our dollar, letting China take over Taiwan, Hong Kong as Russian's mass trips on the
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  border with Eastern Ukraine.
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  All hell is breaking loose.
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  Even J.P. Morgan comes out and says something's horribly wrong in America to collapse us further.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  This is the grand assault with idiot collaborators who are having their own futures destroyed
[01:06.000 --> 01:07.000]  going along with it.
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.000]  He is declaring war on the Second Amendment as we speak.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  Here it is.
[01:11.000 --> 01:20.000]  You know, we're joined today by the Attorney General, Eric Garland, who I've asked to prioritize
[01:20.000 --> 01:21.000]  gun violence.
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  It's also good to see the second gentleman who is here.
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  And it's good to see the first lady, Dr. Jill Biden, who cares deeply about this issue as
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.000]  well.
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.280]  And I look out there and I see so many members of Congress who have led in this fight, so
[01:38.280 --> 01:45.000]  many of you who have never given up, so many of you are absolutely determined as Murphun
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.000]  and Rother's are.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.200]  To disarm the American people.
[01:48.200 --> 01:49.200]  We got a long way to go.
[01:49.200 --> 01:51.720]  It seems like we always have a long way to go.
[01:51.720 --> 01:58.480]  But also today we're taking steps to confront not just the gun crisis, but what is actually
[01:58.480 --> 02:01.400]  a public health crisis.
[02:01.400 --> 02:07.680]  Nothing, nothing I'm about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment.
[02:07.680 --> 02:11.720]  There are phony arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment rights at stake
[02:11.720 --> 02:14.560]  from what we're talking about.
[02:14.560 --> 02:19.120]  But no amendment, no amendment to the Constitution is absolute.
[02:19.120 --> 02:23.120]  You can't yell crowd, you can't yell fire in a crowded movie theater, we call it freedom
[02:23.120 --> 02:24.120]  of speech.
[02:24.120 --> 02:27.560]  From the very beginning, you couldn't own any weapon you wanted to own.
[02:27.560 --> 02:31.360]  From the very beginning of the Second Amendment existed, certain people weren't allowed to
[02:31.360 --> 02:32.360]  have weapons.
[02:32.360 --> 02:37.680]  So the idea is just bizarre to suggest that some of the things you're recommending are
[02:37.680 --> 02:40.440]  contrary to the Constitution.
[02:40.440 --> 02:43.120]  Gun violence in this country is an epidemic.
[02:43.120 --> 02:44.120]  No, it's not.
[02:44.120 --> 02:45.120]  Let's say it again.
[02:45.120 --> 02:46.120]  Way down from 50 years ago.
[02:46.120 --> 02:50.120]  Gun violence in this country is an epidemic, and it's an international embarrassment.
[02:50.120 --> 02:53.120]  Over 50 times more died from falling in the air than you had in that shooting.
[02:53.120 --> 02:57.840]  You know, we saw it again last night as I was coming to the Oval Office.
[02:57.840 --> 03:08.000]  I got the word that in South Carolina, a physician with his wife, two grandchildren, and a person
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.480]  working at his house was gunned down, all five.
[03:13.480 --> 03:18.480]  So many people, so many people sitting here today, 350 million people, statistically it's
[03:18.480 --> 03:21.920]  rare, but not in Chicago or Democrat America.
[03:21.920 --> 03:31.240]  It's like, when the seconds change your life forever, I've had the pleasure of getting
[03:31.240 --> 03:34.400]  to meet in awful circumstances.
[03:34.400 --> 03:40.280]  Many of you, many of you, pull on the hard strings, Obama shipped millions of guns into
[03:40.280 --> 03:46.240]  Mexico and into the Middle East, stayed there for a few millions, destroyed Libya, destroyed
[03:46.240 --> 03:47.240]  Syria.
[03:47.240 --> 03:48.480]  We understand that.
[03:48.480 --> 03:50.760]  These guys don't care about human life, they hate human life.
[03:50.760 --> 03:56.000]  Mark and Jackie, for the party of abortion, is always willing to see you, but not under
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  these circumstances.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.840]  I want to say, before I introduce the rest of the folks, is you know, what a lot of people
[04:02.840 --> 04:07.800]  have not been through, what they've been through, don't understand, it takes a lot of courage
[04:07.800 --> 04:10.360]  to come to an event like this.
[04:10.360 --> 04:18.200]  They're absolutely, absolutely determined to make change, but Mark and Jackie, his son
[04:18.200 --> 04:24.400]  Daniel was the first grader in San Duke Elementary School, Daniel loves sports, loves outdoor
[04:24.400 --> 04:27.000]  sports, getting muddy.
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.680]  I see my friend, Fred Gutenberg, his daughter, Jamie, was a freshman at Marjorie Stoneman
[04:33.680 --> 04:35.520]  Douglas High School.
[04:35.520 --> 04:37.560]  She was an accomplished dancer.
[04:37.560 --> 04:44.960]  I see Brandon Wolfe over the shooting at the impulse, at the pulse club, night club.
[04:44.960 --> 04:49.560]  He survived, but his two best friends died.
[04:49.560 --> 04:52.960]  Greg Jackson, who was just walking down the street.
[04:52.960 --> 04:56.640]  All right, we'll be right back with more of this babbling puppet that stole the election,
[04:56.640 --> 05:00.200]  this mindless Chinese communist spy.
[05:00.200 --> 05:05.520]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air, about looking at
[05:05.520 --> 05:09.480]  the world from the perspective of the globalist, that the public's so dumbed down that they
[05:09.480 --> 05:12.680]  don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that
[05:12.680 --> 05:15.960]  we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[05:15.960 --> 05:20.200]  Yes, that's the position of the globalist, they play God, and they think because we
[05:20.200 --> 05:23.360]  don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[05:23.360 --> 05:27.320]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to harm me, they've tried to get
[05:27.320 --> 05:33.200]  me to join them, but metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit, I'm the connection
[05:33.200 --> 05:37.840]  with God, and I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[05:37.840 --> 05:42.880]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with
[05:42.880 --> 05:46.680]  the system, believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power on it.
[05:46.680 --> 05:52.520]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[05:52.520 --> 05:57.080]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real
[05:57.080 --> 06:01.920]  God of the universe doesn't like, and that's a fact.
[06:01.920 --> 06:08.240]  We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and
[06:08.240 --> 06:16.160]  oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall
[06:16.160 --> 06:22.400]  defend our island, whatever the crust may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall
[06:22.400 --> 06:28.800]  fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall
[06:28.800 --> 06:33.800]  fight in the hills, we shall never surrender.
[06:33.800 --> 06:44.400]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[06:44.400 --> 06:48.240]  Want to welcome all the new viewers to tune in every day of this broadcast, but particularly
[06:48.240 --> 06:55.040]  now we are seeing millions of new people on our servers coming in to visit the live show,
[06:55.040 --> 06:58.720]  The Cinegated Radio Show today, for a lot of reason we'll tell you about that later.
[06:58.720 --> 07:05.240]  Very exciting to see the awakening accelerate the stooge, and that's what a stooge is,
[07:05.240 --> 07:07.040]  is a puppet leader.
[07:07.040 --> 07:15.120]  The Chinese viceroy, the Chinese puppet, Joe Biden is speaking live as we speak, but
[07:15.120 --> 07:17.280]  we've paused it, we're going to be playing it here for you, it was just a few minutes
[07:17.280 --> 07:23.000]  behind, live time, pledging to just ban all semi-autos, ban anybody that bought parts
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.440]  and made a firearm, he is trying to appoint an individual who is the worst gun grabber
[07:29.440 --> 07:35.600]  in the world, David Chipman, is a manifest lunatic fraud, he says no one should be able
[07:35.600 --> 07:41.960]  to own any guns period, you should only have dead bolts or maybe a baseball bat, he says
[07:41.960 --> 07:46.800]  gun owners falsely believe in zombies, and he says that two helicopters were shot down
[07:46.800 --> 07:53.680]  by the branch of Indians before the ATF ever assaulted the cattle trailers, that's like
[07:53.680 --> 08:01.240]  saying the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl this year, no they didn't, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
[08:01.240 --> 08:08.040]  did, I mean it is an outrageous lie that a five year old can prove, we're going to
[08:08.040 --> 08:12.120]  get into this guy, I haven't even scratched the surface of it, but here's the Chai Kong
[08:12.120 --> 08:18.760]  Puppet and listen, the alarm bells are hitting, China has now with aircraft carriers and
[08:18.760 --> 08:26.080]  over a hundred ships, large ships, thousands total, encircled Taiwan and has heavy bombers
[08:26.080 --> 08:31.840]  flying over it, the Taiwanese say they may start firing missiles any minute, that was
[08:31.840 --> 08:38.640]  this morning, last night there, all hell is breaking loose, the Russians are massing
[08:38.640 --> 08:43.240]  troops on the edge of Ukraine because Biden is sending in heavy weapons and there are
[08:43.240 --> 08:49.280]  major artillery battles going on between proxy US and Russian forces and we are not the
[08:49.280 --> 08:56.480]  good guys in this, this is unbelievably horrible, the Chinese commons are taking over, we're
[08:56.480 --> 09:01.600]  busy starting a war with Russia, this is just unprecedented falling and destruction and
[09:01.600 --> 09:06.680]  of course the borders being dissolved, Pelosi says that the borders being fixed and it's
[09:06.680 --> 09:11.080]  doing great, I've got that clip coming up that we paused Biden during the break, right
[09:11.080 --> 09:15.800]  where he was talking about the border and then he gets into the plan for your self-defense
[09:15.800 --> 09:20.080]  while he has all these bodyguards here it is.
[09:20.080 --> 09:25.800]  Through it, every time you show up at an event like this, it brings back when you got that
[09:25.800 --> 09:32.960]  phone call, it brings back the immediacy of what happened at that moment, so I genuinely
[09:32.960 --> 09:38.240]  mean it, thank you, thank you for having the courage, you care so much about violence,
[09:38.240 --> 09:42.480]  that's why Obama funded the air of spring, fast and furious, killed millions, Senator
[09:42.480 --> 09:47.840]  Blumenthal understands it, a lot of folks out here understand it, he transferred weapons
[09:47.840 --> 09:53.960]  to terrorists in Mexico to turn pain into purpose and demand that we take the action
[09:53.960 --> 09:59.280]  and give meaning, he's a gun running communist Chinese criminal, enough, enough of you funded
[09:59.280 --> 10:04.600]  terrorists, you drug dealing, pedophile, because what they want you to know, what they want
[10:04.600 --> 10:13.360]  you to do is not just listen, every day in this country, 316 people are shot, every single
[10:13.360 --> 10:19.880]  day, most of them criminals, 106 of them die, and 10,000 people a day die of something else,
[10:19.880 --> 10:26.640]  our flag was still flying at half staff for the victims of the horrific murder of 8 primarily
[10:26.640 --> 10:30.520]  asian-american people, have you noticed the flags are always at half staff now, 10 more
[10:30.520 --> 10:36.600]  lives, that's supposed to be the president dies, the challenger blows up, you probably
[10:36.600 --> 10:42.040]  didn't hear it, but between those two incidents, less than one week apart, there were more
[10:42.040 --> 10:49.800]  than 850 additional shootings, 850, and most of it black on black, the lives of more than
[10:49.800 --> 11:00.440]  250 people, total lying pig, 500, 500 injured, this is an epidemic for God's sake, and it
[11:00.440 --> 11:07.040]  has to stop, pause again, it's an epidemic, just like COVID pandemic, but not really
[11:07.040 --> 11:10.280]  an epidemic is, didn't really kill that many people, so they count all the other deaths
[11:10.280 --> 11:14.080]  as that, but now there's so many deaths from the vaccine, suddenly death numbers are going
[11:14.080 --> 11:18.720]  up, and they're calling those COVID deaths, in fact, that was in my COVID stack, from
[11:18.720 --> 11:22.520]  yesterday, and you guys brought it in, I didn't get to the COVID stack yesterday, only scratch
[11:22.520 --> 11:29.200]  the surface, I'm going to hit that end today, it's all over the top insane, but that's their
[11:29.200 --> 11:33.280]  slogan, never again, never again one person gets shot, what about stab, what about run
[11:33.280 --> 11:37.320]  over, what about poison, what about sprinkle, what about beating it up the club, it's evil
[11:37.320 --> 11:42.440]  people, it's not the guns, and we have our guns to protect ourselves, what is it, 14
[11:42.440 --> 11:48.400]  times, the FBI admits for every time a gun's using a crime, 14 times it's used to stop
[11:48.400 --> 11:53.960]  crime, or frustrate a crime, they know that, and they want us to live like their slaves
[11:53.960 --> 12:02.640]  do in Chicago, and New York, and L.A., and places, he's a monster, he had the left burned
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.920]  down cities last summer, and when business owners protected themselves, they were called
[12:07.920 --> 12:13.240]  terrorists, and they're starting a race war in America, you will never get our guns, it
[12:13.240 --> 12:17.680]  will cause a civil war, but that's what he wants, that's what the chai comms want, it's
[12:17.680 --> 12:22.560]  why they're making this move, it's insane, and it's a death sentence for those that try
[12:22.560 --> 12:26.680]  to carry it out, which is even more what he wants, to get rid of our federal state law
[12:26.680 --> 12:33.760]  enforcement, this is the destruction of the country, the dollar, the borders, our families,
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.720]  this is war, this is globalism, this is by design rejected, and what as they've already
[12:38.720 --> 12:43.040]  announced what the executive orders are, he's about to announce, all the part guns, tens
[12:43.040 --> 12:46.760]  of millions sold, that weren't guns, they're gonna call them that, a piece of this, a piece
[12:46.760 --> 12:52.120]  of that, any part of a gun, they're gonna call it a firearm, his new ATF that he's trying
[12:52.120 --> 12:57.080]  to get put through, David Chipman has said that, he wants all semi-autos banned, and
[12:57.080 --> 13:02.760]  he's also supported cities that have total gun bans, like DC and said, get a deadbolt,
[13:02.760 --> 13:09.000]  the man is a monster, oh but he's got a detail about a guards, that's okay for him, and Chipman
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.720]  goes all the way back to the Clintons, and the things the ATF did then, and we all know
[13:12.720 --> 13:16.360]  what that is, and we all know about fast and furious, shipping millions of guns into Mexico
[13:16.360 --> 13:20.280]  to transchimp them to the Middle East for the air of spring, that's why Al Qaeda and
[13:20.280 --> 13:24.640]  ISIS and El Nuzra had U.S. weapons, let's go to break with this lying sack of Chinese
[13:24.640 --> 13:26.520]  communist garbage.
[13:26.520 --> 13:33.400]  Two things, first, the steps we're gonna take immediately, and second, the action that needs
[13:33.400 --> 13:40.520]  to be taken going forward to curb the epidemic gun violence, I asked the attorney general
[13:40.520 --> 13:47.160]  and his team to identify for me immediate concrete actions I could take now, without
[13:47.160 --> 13:52.560]  having to go through the Congress, and today I'm announcing several initial steps my administration
[13:52.560 --> 13:59.120]  is taking to curb this epidemic of gun violence, much more need be done, but the first, first,
[13:59.120 --> 14:06.040]  want to rein in the proliferation of so-called ghost guns, these are guns that are homemade,
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.720]  built from a kit, and include directions on how to finish the firearm, you can go buy
[14:10.720 --> 14:17.640]  the kit, they have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can't
[14:17.640 --> 14:23.480]  be traced, and the buyers aren't required to pass the background check to buy the kit,
[14:23.480 --> 14:31.800]  to make the gun, consequently, anyone, anyone from a criminal to a terrorist can buy this
[14:31.800 --> 14:36.840]  kit, as little as 30 minutes put together a weapon, they're not trying to ban the kits
[14:36.840 --> 14:39.760]  now, you know, I want to see these kits, they're gonna try to hunt you down if you want to
[14:39.760 --> 14:46.360]  start a war, under the gun control act, which is gonna require that the seller and manufacturers
[14:46.360 --> 14:52.480]  make the key parts with serial numbers, and run background checks on the buyers when they
[14:52.480 --> 14:57.120]  walk in to buy that, and that gets rid of the gun shells right there, the second action
[14:57.120 --> 15:02.400]  we're gonna take, that's registration, back in 2000, the year 2000, the Bureau of Alcohol
[15:02.400 --> 15:06.680]  Tobacco and Fire, let's stop there, let's come back, again, we know what's about to
[15:06.680 --> 15:09.680]  be announced, but this is just the beginning, and then every time there's another shooting,
[15:09.680 --> 15:14.720]  which is gonna happen, almost every person's on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, an antidepressant,
[15:14.720 --> 15:18.840]  which on the insert, they knew in the 80s, when they got Prozac approved, that it was
[15:18.840 --> 15:24.240]  causing massive, triple the number of suicides, and massive increases in what they called
[15:24.240 --> 15:30.640]  psychotic breaks, megalomania, read the inserts, man, they're all varied, but boy, they're
[15:30.640 --> 15:35.880]  scary as hell, and I've known people that are on these, I had girlfriends that went
[15:35.880 --> 15:40.600]  on it, they were completely different women in two months, and sometimes we didn't know
[15:40.600 --> 15:48.560]  who they were, and just made them extremely promiscuous as well, because it disconnects
[15:48.560 --> 15:53.080]  your conscious brain from your subconscious, and turns you into a zombie like animal, but
[15:53.080 --> 15:58.400]  while you're in La La Land, which is fun, they're also very poisonous.
[15:58.400 --> 16:02.560]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast, hell, I've been
[16:02.560 --> 16:06.680]  on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that, but let me tell you,
[16:06.680 --> 16:10.720]  the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big, globalist publications are
[16:10.720 --> 16:14.560]  coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down, so please pray to
[16:14.560 --> 16:19.040]  keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well,
[16:19.040 --> 16:25.080]  at the same time, go to infowarsstore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film,
[16:25.080 --> 16:29.960]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[16:29.960 --> 16:31.440]  in the face of this thing.
[16:31.440 --> 16:36.320]  I need your help more than ever now, I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't
[16:36.320 --> 16:41.560]  do it if you don't support us, so pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast
[16:41.560 --> 16:46.480]  however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every

[18:18.760 --> 18:24.240]  One day through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., it's the Alex Jones Show, and I know
[18:24.240 --> 18:27.000]  you don't want to listen to Joe Biden, I don't want to look at him, I don't want to hear
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.440]  from him, he's the guy that stole the election, that's all come out, the scientists, the experts,
[18:31.440 --> 18:36.920]  they've all documented it, and they're now trying to break the country for the big banks
[18:36.920 --> 18:40.760]  to come in and fully consolidate it, they've decided China is the future.
[18:40.760 --> 18:46.280]  Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., Europe, Canada, we're closed, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:46.280 --> 18:50.800]  The third world will then be exploited, collapse into us, we'll be all-made poor slaves, the
[18:50.800 --> 18:56.160]  loveless will fly around above us in their private jets, and we will be on the carbon
[18:56.160 --> 18:57.400]  plantation.
[18:57.400 --> 19:00.360]  This is the admitted post-industrial world.
[19:00.360 --> 19:05.640]  And remember, Joe Biden has bodyguards, remember, now these Democrats, even down to mayors that
[19:05.640 --> 19:10.400]  defund the police, in the case of Minneapolis, defunded half the police, crime rate more
[19:10.400 --> 19:15.640]  than triple there, national average has doubled in just the last years since the Democrats
[19:15.640 --> 19:22.120]  launched this attack on the police, and they said, oh, they did a huge, was like an eight
[19:22.120 --> 19:26.600]  million dollar contract for a year to protect the city council, and then they did another
[19:26.600 --> 19:32.480]  contract for 24 hours a day at their offices and at their homes, they have two bodyguards
[19:32.480 --> 19:38.880]  apiece, but you don't get police, and you don't get to have guns on top of it, get a
[19:38.880 --> 19:47.560]  deadbolt, as Obama's new nominee for the ATF head says.
[19:47.560 --> 19:51.080]  So going into this insanity, going into the breakdown of the border, I mean, they've just
[19:51.080 --> 19:56.880]  said, if you're in the third world, rush the border, and they're rushing, and it's just
[19:56.880 --> 20:01.840]  massive, and then Pelosi says, oh, MS-13's all God's children, there's no crisis, the
[20:01.840 --> 20:07.280]  border's getting better, she said, even though it's 10 times the numbers, it was under Obama,
[20:07.280 --> 20:11.880]  more than 20 times what it was under Trump, because Trump shut it down, it is a nightmare
[20:11.880 --> 20:16.000]  scenario, and then what happened yesterday, two days ago?
[20:16.000 --> 20:21.880]  We put out the video that has probably 50 million views, I mean, it's just everywhere,
[20:21.880 --> 20:28.320]  and the smuggling going on, it's all illegal, he didn't sign an executive order, he didn't
[20:28.320 --> 20:32.600]  pass a law, he didn't repeal a law, he just said, surge us, before he was even, stole
[20:32.600 --> 20:37.320]  the election, and then now he congratulates them on the great job they've done, and then
[20:37.320 --> 20:40.760]  there's the quote, Catholic charity that's run by the Democratic Party, just one of the
[20:40.760 --> 20:47.720]  facilities there in McAllen, Texas, and there they are loading little kids in to a trunk,
[20:47.720 --> 20:51.160]  like luggage, and we stop them, the police say, yeah, but you're doing illegal, take
[20:51.160 --> 20:55.320]  them out, they go inside, we catch more cars doing it, we haven't even put that footage
[20:55.320 --> 21:01.560]  out, because I went and got on a helicopter and flew back to Austin, and the crew came
[21:01.560 --> 21:06.720]  back the next day, we have hours of footage, and all I've got is two guys in there, overworked,
[21:06.720 --> 21:13.080]  exhausted, trying to get down and put it out, we've got stopped even worse than that.
[21:13.080 --> 21:19.160]  And then how does literally dozens of national newspapers said, Jones probably staged this,
[21:19.160 --> 21:25.080]  there are no crisis, yeah, I staged the McAllen police, I staged the kids being put in a trunk,
[21:25.080 --> 21:28.440]  I mean, if I could stage something like that with a hundred million dollar budget, I would
[21:28.440 --> 21:36.960]  be better than the top directors out there.
[21:36.960 --> 21:44.760]  I mean, it's totally real, you can go to McAllen and you can sit there and every 30 minutes
[21:44.760 --> 21:50.920]  this is going on, hell, every 10 minutes it's going on, with big buses, you name it.
[21:50.920 --> 21:56.400]  But the left says there is no anti-fa, there is no Satanism, there is no abortion, but
[21:56.400 --> 22:01.840]  they're doing it all, ladies and gentlemen, and it's so incredibly exploitive.
[22:01.840 --> 22:05.840]  Drew Hernandez was on yesterday, I didn't even know they were denying it was real yesterday
[22:05.840 --> 22:11.520]  because it went out the night before on Tuesday night, and he's like, I want to tell everybody
[22:11.520 --> 22:15.080]  this was real, I'm an investigative journalist and I was there, it's real, and I'm like,
[22:15.080 --> 22:16.400]  I'll come on, I'm going to ignore those people.
[22:16.400 --> 22:22.960]  I didn't know by then it was already in newspapers saying we just made this up, kind of like
[22:22.960 --> 22:30.040]  back when I would cover Bilderberg and the New York Times, I guess it was like 2008,
[22:30.040 --> 22:38.560]  yeah, Chantilly, Virginia said, Jones was at this hotel conference center imagining
[22:38.560 --> 22:45.600]  men with dark glasses and imagining secret service, they had Marines, they had helicopters,
[22:45.600 --> 22:52.760]  they had state department people everywhere, all on video with the king of Spain on video
[22:52.760 --> 22:56.800]  entering, we stayed in the hotel until they actually got there, we're thrown out.
[22:56.800 --> 23:03.080]  The queen of the Netherlands, David Rockefeller, all on video and the New York Times said
[23:03.080 --> 23:12.040]  it did not exist and that I was having a full schizophrenic breakdown in the parking lot.
[23:12.040 --> 23:16.560]  That's because back then folks, Bilderberg didn't exist, within two years it was all
[23:16.560 --> 23:20.840]  over the news because back then the Drudge Report was not, I guess, run by CNN, I was
[23:20.840 --> 23:27.080]  told that CNN bought it two years ago, I didn't believe it, it looks like it's true, but Drudge,
[23:27.080 --> 23:32.160]  the real Drudge, back when Drudge actually owned it, exposed all that and so that's
[23:32.160 --> 23:36.320]  why I'm probably mad at Drudge because it did so good for so long and then, you know,
[23:36.320 --> 23:41.680]  like a goose that lays golden eggs for freedom for 25 years and then turns into a demon in
[23:41.680 --> 23:44.520]  the middle of the night and starts biting you but I think you still kind of love it,
[23:44.520 --> 23:45.520]  you know what I mean?
[23:45.520 --> 23:50.160]  Even as you see it walking out the door, it's like, anyways, I'm digressing, I'm going
[23:50.160 --> 23:55.160]  to come back and play the Biden thing, I've got so much news here but anyone can do this
[23:55.160 --> 23:58.120]  and I'm not going to say what we're going to do but I'm obviously going to be going
[23:58.120 --> 24:00.960]  back to the border very soon, I'm not going to say it's going to be tomorrow or even this
[24:00.960 --> 24:04.440]  weekend, it might be today, I'm just going to tell you that, I've already decided when
[24:04.440 --> 24:11.080]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm not going to tell this system how or when and quite frankly,
[24:11.080 --> 24:17.000]  if I had the money because we're maxed out right now, I would have a full-time team just
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.600]  in McAllen and in Brownsville roving the Texas border, it is, Wild Wild West, insane,
[24:22.600 --> 24:30.080]  illegals everywhere you go, buses everywhere you go, children sleeping in dirt under bridges,
[24:30.080 --> 24:33.600]  we sent a drone in there, they had a geo fence up so we couldn't show them in the dirt but
[24:33.600 --> 24:37.200]  Project Guritas got folks in there, we have all these whistleblowers, all this whistleblower
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.400]  video, people that saw children being raped inside the facilities, we broke that on Monday,
[24:41.400 --> 24:46.760]  I see Governor Abbott talking about it, I mean, I flew over with a helicopter, we have
[24:46.760 --> 24:51.960]  hours and hours and hours of this footage and that's why you need to go to infowarstore.com
[24:51.960 --> 24:54.240]  so we can stay on air.
[24:54.240 --> 24:57.520]  Now that you see what's happening is everything we talked about went on, despite the fact
[24:57.520 --> 25:03.320]  you're trying to censor us and block us, info wars, I want to report to you our success
[25:03.320 --> 25:06.320]  so that you understand why you've supported us as the core audience of the core radio
[25:06.320 --> 25:11.320]  stations that are like, you know, funding us to go out be the missionaries to tell the
[25:11.320 --> 25:15.040]  truth against the globalists, that's what you're doing here.
[25:15.040 --> 25:20.200]  We are reaching right now basically 10 million extra people a day conservatively just in
[25:20.200 --> 25:24.880]  the U.S. alone, I mean, we have hit super zeitgeist for the last month, I'm not even
[25:24.880 --> 25:28.160]  bragged about it because the enemy is already watching but they already understand now there's
[25:28.160 --> 25:32.480]  no point, you can't hide this from them, we are just dominating, I've got world leaders
[25:32.480 --> 25:37.280]  calling me, every major talk show host that's there, that's a patriot calls me every day,
[25:37.280 --> 25:41.160]  I've got the call by three of them in the last two hours, there's a total conversion
[25:41.160 --> 25:45.120]  awakening happening, we've blown the enemy sky high with the truth and so they may be
[25:45.120 --> 25:48.360]  able to destroy the country and start a war with Russia but in the end everybody's going
[25:48.360 --> 25:51.600]  to know that these puppet chicoms did it.
[25:51.600 --> 25:56.280]  And so I need your support though, we are winning in the realm of ideas, winning in
[25:56.280 --> 26:00.440]  the realm of fighting Satan with God's truth but we need money to run this operation, I
[26:00.440 --> 26:03.600]  need to hire a bunch of people, I need to do a lot more, and I've got a lot of folks
[26:03.600 --> 26:08.880]  I want to hire, a lot of folks I want to sponsor but I don't have the money, so infowarstore.com,

[26:57.920 --> 27:05.800]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden, and now that all the
[27:05.800 --> 27:14.560]  lies are being revealed, what will you do, we know that millions will do absolutely nothing,
[27:14.560 --> 27:21.000]  they will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue, it is the patriots
[27:21.000 --> 27:29.080]  of the world versus everybody else, I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the
[27:29.080 --> 27:35.600]  constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I
[27:35.600 --> 27:42.120]  will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, that I take this obligation freely without
[27:42.120 --> 27:48.440]  any mental reservation for purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge
[27:48.440 --> 27:58.600]  my duties as best as I can, so help me God.
[27:58.600 --> 28:07.600]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World, even
[28:07.600 --> 28:12.280]  before I had an access to the show in the mid-90s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man
[28:12.280 --> 28:17.440]  that was fun, to speak out and have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd, you're still
[28:17.440 --> 28:21.120]  entertaining because you're real, well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[28:21.120 --> 28:25.040]  We're not worthy, we're not worthy.
[28:25.040 --> 28:28.960]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you, because
[28:28.960 --> 28:32.200]  these topics are so huge, they're so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth, I'm
[28:32.200 --> 28:34.240]  trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[28:34.240 --> 28:39.880]  The globalists love lying to you, they love manipulating you, they enjoy destroying humanity,
[28:39.880 --> 28:45.400]  they enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them, that for me is really
[28:45.400 --> 28:48.040]  sad to say that and disgusting.
[28:48.040 --> 28:53.240]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we will never join
[28:53.240 --> 28:57.960]  the globalists, we will never knowingly manipulate you, because we know we're all in this together.
[28:57.960 --> 29:02.760]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world, they are creating insecurity, crime,
[29:02.760 --> 29:04.260]  war and famine.
[29:04.260 --> 29:08.880]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and

[30:06.480 --> 30:10.960]  and they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[30:10.960 --> 30:15.560]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering, that's why they've been massively
[30:15.560 --> 30:20.160]  expanding their services, so whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want
[30:20.160 --> 30:24.760]  help building a website or want servers or any other major service, they've got it all
[30:24.760 --> 30:30.640]  and they're expanding, and if you go to InfowarsDomains.com and follow that link, you get all their
[30:30.640 --> 30:37.280]  services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move
[30:37.280 --> 30:42.080]  goes to fund the Infowar, and then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type
[30:42.080 --> 30:47.120]  of services that you get from them, so it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet
[30:47.120 --> 30:50.840]  again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[30:50.840 --> 31:01.520]  So InfowarsDomains.com, the revolution starts there, InfowarsDomains.com, take action now.
[31:01.520 --> 31:21.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:21.480 --> 31:27.600]  I'm glad you asked that question a larger sense instead of quoting the ridiculousness
[31:27.600 --> 31:34.600]  of the Republicans in the Congress, the fact is that we're on a good path at the border
[31:34.600 --> 31:40.440]  under the leadership of Joe Biden, President Biden, it's about three things, it's about
[31:40.440 --> 31:46.240]  restructuring how we do what is happening there because we're in a very bad situation
[31:46.240 --> 31:48.520]  under the Trump administration.
[31:48.520 --> 32:12.840]  It's about a refugee plan.
[32:12.840 --> 32:21.280]  Today with online sales and ghost guns, times and trafficking methods have changed and we
[32:21.280 --> 32:23.640]  have to adjust.
[32:23.640 --> 32:27.840]  We also have to ask the Justice Department to release a new annual report.
[32:27.840 --> 32:34.480]  This report will better help policymakers address firearms trafficking as it is today,
[32:34.480 --> 32:36.680]  not what it was yesterday.
[32:36.680 --> 32:43.160]  The third change, we want to treat pistols modified with stabilizing braces with the
[32:43.160 --> 32:45.360]  seriousness they deserve.
[32:45.360 --> 32:50.840]  A stabilizing brace hook and a pencil essentially makes that pistol a hell of a lot more accurate
[32:50.840 --> 32:52.640]  and a mini rifle.
[32:52.640 --> 32:59.240]  As a result, it's more lethal, effectively turning into a short-barreled rifle.
[32:59.240 --> 33:02.280]  That's what the alleged shooter in Boulder appears to have done.
[33:02.280 --> 33:08.440]  I want to be clear that these modifications to firearms that make them more lethal should
[33:08.440 --> 33:11.800]  be subject to the National Firearms Act.
[33:11.800 --> 33:17.360]  The National Firearms Act requires that a potential owner pay $200 fee and submit their
[33:17.360 --> 33:22.080]  name and other identifying information to the Justice Department, just saying they would
[33:22.080 --> 33:26.320]  if they went out and purchased a silencer for a gun.
[33:26.320 --> 33:32.920]  Fourthly, during my campaign for president, I wanted to make it easier for states to adopt
[33:32.920 --> 33:35.600]  extreme risk protection order laws.
[33:35.600 --> 33:41.760]  They're also called red flag laws, which everybody in this law knows, but many people listening
[33:41.760 --> 33:42.920]  do not know.
[33:42.920 --> 33:47.000]  Wow, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to back that up.
[33:47.000 --> 33:53.960]  He is now announcing that basically firearms are going to be like silencers or fully automatic
[33:53.960 --> 33:58.400]  where you've got to go get an ATF stamp and get fingerprinted and get registered.
[33:58.400 --> 33:59.400]  Wow.
[33:59.400 --> 34:02.320]  So this is even more draconian than they had been saying they were.
[34:02.320 --> 34:04.800]  And he's acting like it's all completely normal.
[34:04.800 --> 34:06.320]  He's acting like it's no big deal.
[34:06.320 --> 34:07.880]  He's acting like it's no problem.
[34:07.880 --> 34:10.520]  Again, welcome back here to the Alex Jones Show.
[34:10.520 --> 34:12.520]  These people are just criminals.
[34:12.520 --> 34:14.400]  Remember, they have bodyguards.
[34:14.400 --> 34:15.520]  They're collapsing the country.
[34:15.520 --> 34:16.920]  They ship the fentanyl in.
[34:16.920 --> 34:19.520]  They told China they can invade Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[34:19.520 --> 34:24.200]  He said that a month ago on CNN, and China has now encircled Taiwan and says they may
[34:24.200 --> 34:25.200]  invade.
[34:25.200 --> 34:28.120]  They announced they may physically begin bombardment yesterday.
[34:28.120 --> 34:34.080]  I mean, just world shattering insane news that could lead into World War Three, just
[34:34.080 --> 34:36.320]  unspeakably insane.
[34:36.320 --> 34:38.880]  Nothing like this has gone on since World War Two.
[34:38.880 --> 34:45.120]  And we have a bumbling idiot who's a Chai Khan agent whose son's laptop has audio of
[34:45.120 --> 34:49.160]  him saying, I work for the Communist Chinese and I'm being investigated by the Southern
[34:49.160 --> 34:52.200]  District and my daddy's gotten a call from the FBI.
[34:52.200 --> 34:54.280]  That's who our president is.
[34:54.280 --> 34:55.600]  And he wants our guns.
[34:55.600 --> 34:56.600]  That's his main mission.
[34:56.600 --> 34:57.600]  And don't worry.
[34:57.600 --> 35:03.440]  The United Airlines says they're going to have 50% of their pilots be black women.
[35:03.440 --> 35:08.400]  Well, if a black woman wants to go, learn to be a pilot and do it, that's one thing.
[35:08.400 --> 35:12.200]  But they're saying, no, no, we're going to only take applications from black women.
[35:12.200 --> 35:16.000]  What does this even mean?
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.640]  This is the destruction of the country.
[35:18.640 --> 35:20.640]  It's insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:20.640 --> 35:22.120]  But it's the same thing.
[35:22.120 --> 35:23.120]  Oh, it's a target.
[35:23.120 --> 35:29.120]  Make sure the boys and girls stuff's all together because girls don't want to be policemen and
[35:29.120 --> 35:30.120]  firemen.
[35:30.120 --> 35:31.880]  So we're going to make them be policemen and firemen.
[35:31.880 --> 35:34.640]  Again, we're going to make black women go be pilots.
[35:34.640 --> 35:35.640]  That's all we're going to hire.
[35:35.640 --> 35:36.640]  50% is black women.
[35:36.640 --> 35:40.520]  Well, a black woman wants to be a pilot, they can and a lot of them are.
[35:40.520 --> 35:44.880]  But this is about lowering standards like the military just said, we're going to lower
[35:44.880 --> 35:48.080]  standards so we can have more women in.
[35:48.080 --> 35:51.840]  Because the type of women that are going and wanting to be in the military are not up at
[35:51.840 --> 35:52.840]  those standards.
[35:52.840 --> 35:54.240]  Does it mean that black women are bad pilots?
[35:54.240 --> 35:57.640]  It means, ladies and gentlemen, that they weren't out trying to do it.
[35:57.640 --> 36:01.480]  And so now you're going to lower standards to basically push a group to go do it.
[36:01.480 --> 36:02.600]  It's mental illness.
[36:02.600 --> 36:06.560]  It's total destruction of society.
[36:06.560 --> 36:10.280]  Continue.
[36:10.280 --> 36:13.840]  To curb this epidemic of gun violence, much more need be done.
[36:13.840 --> 36:20.160]  The first, first, want to rein in the proliferation of so-called ghost guns.
[36:20.160 --> 36:26.000]  These are guns that are homemade, built from a kit and include directions on how to finish
[36:26.000 --> 36:27.000]  the firearm.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.480]  You can go buy the kit.
[36:29.480 --> 36:31.880]  They have no serial numbers.
[36:31.880 --> 36:36.160]  So when they show up at a crime scene, they can't be traced.
[36:36.160 --> 36:40.520]  And the buyers aren't required to pass the background check to buy the kit to make the
[36:40.520 --> 36:41.520]  gun.
[36:41.520 --> 36:49.920]  Consequently, anyone, anyone from a criminal to a terrorist can buy this kit as little
[36:49.920 --> 36:54.080]  as 30 minutes put together a weapon.
[36:54.080 --> 37:00.000]  You know, I want to see these kits treated as firearms under the Gun Control Act, which
[37:00.000 --> 37:06.960]  is going to require that the seller and manufacturers make the key parts with serial numbers and
[37:06.960 --> 37:13.120]  run background checks on the buyers when they walk in to buy that package.
[37:13.120 --> 37:19.160]  The second action we're going to take, back in 2000, the year 2000, the Bureau of Alcohol,
[37:19.160 --> 37:24.320]  Tobacco and Firearms released a report on its investigations of firearms trafficking
[37:24.320 --> 37:25.320]  in America.
[37:25.320 --> 37:31.760]  The report was a pivotal value, was an important tool for policymakers when I was in the Senate
[37:31.760 --> 37:38.280]  and beyond, at all levels, to stop firearms from being illegally diverted into dangerous
[37:38.280 --> 37:39.280]  hands.
[37:39.280 --> 37:47.680]  Today, with online sales and ghost guns, times and trafficking methods have changed.
[37:47.680 --> 37:50.160]  And we have to adjust.
[37:50.160 --> 37:54.360]  We also have to ask the Justice Department to release a new annual report.
[37:54.360 --> 38:01.000]  This report will better help policymakers address firearms trafficking as it is today,
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.200]  not what it was yesterday.
[38:03.200 --> 38:09.680]  The third change, we want to treat pistols modified with stabilizing braces with the
[38:09.680 --> 38:11.880]  seriousness they deserve.
[38:11.880 --> 38:17.360]  A stabilizing brace hook and a pencil essentially makes that pistol a hell of a lot more accurate
[38:17.360 --> 38:19.160]  and a mini rifle.
[38:19.160 --> 38:25.760]  As a result, it's more lethal, effectively turning it into a short-barreled rifle.
[38:25.760 --> 38:28.880]  That's what the alleged shooter in Boulder appears to have done.
[38:28.880 --> 38:35.000]  I want to be clear that these modifications to firearms that make them more lethal should
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.360]  be subject to the National Firearms Act.
[38:38.360 --> 38:43.920]  The National Firearms Act requires that a potential owner pay $200 fee and submit their
[38:43.920 --> 38:48.080]  name and other identifying information to the Justice Department.
[38:48.080 --> 38:52.680]  Just say they would if they went out and purchased a silencer for a gun.
[38:52.680 --> 38:59.440]  Fourthly, during my campaign for president, I wanted to make it easier for states to adopt
[38:59.440 --> 39:02.600]  extreme risk protection order laws.
[39:02.600 --> 39:08.280]  They're also called red flag laws, which everybody in this law knows, but many people listening
[39:08.280 --> 39:10.040]  do not know.
[39:10.040 --> 39:16.760]  These laws allow a police or family member to petition a court in their jurisdiction
[39:16.760 --> 39:22.560]  and say, I want you to temporarily remove from the following people any firearm that
[39:22.560 --> 39:27.840]  they may possess because they're a danger and a crisis for presenting a danger to themselves.
[39:27.840 --> 39:29.720]  This is an absolute nightmare.
[39:29.720 --> 39:33.160]  It's even worse than they had telegraphed they were going to do in the last week, of
[39:33.160 --> 39:34.160]  course.
[39:34.160 --> 39:35.160]  This is just incredible.
[39:35.160 --> 39:38.960]  It's why they're suing and trying to criminalize the NRA.
[39:38.960 --> 39:43.520]  It's why they've sued, running it out of existence, the same group suing me, coming after your
[39:43.520 --> 39:44.520]  first amendment as well.
[39:44.520 --> 39:46.000]  We just want to silence everybody.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.240]  Did you just hear that?
[39:48.240 --> 39:53.000]  People come back with the red flag laws, and what he's getting into, if a family member
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.880]  or someone else just says, I think this person shouldn't have guns, they come and take your
[39:57.880 --> 40:00.200]  guns, then good luck getting them back.
[40:00.200 --> 40:02.800]  Most people I know that have had this done to them, like Laura Loomer, have done nothing
[40:02.800 --> 40:06.160]  wrong, can't get their gun back, because it's extra judiciary.
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.240]  It's just done, like rendition or something with the CIA.
[40:10.240 --> 40:12.320]  They just do it outside of law.
[40:12.320 --> 40:13.320]  This is Napoleonic.
[40:13.320 --> 40:18.160]  This is authoritarian, and in that big bombshell, we're going to claim you're under the
[40:18.160 --> 40:26.800]  Firearms Act like a suppressor, be called a silencer, or a full auto, if your pistol
[40:26.800 --> 40:28.680]  has anything attached to it.
[40:28.680 --> 40:34.360]  Of course, there's so many guns that they're calling short barrel rifles under that.
[40:34.360 --> 40:38.880]  This is a declaration of war against the Second Amendment, it's a declaration of war against
[40:38.880 --> 40:42.800]  our country, and it's what you'd expect from a CHICOM agent, busy breaking the very existence
[40:42.800 --> 40:43.800]  of this country.
[40:43.800 --> 40:46.960]  Then, of course, you've got him talking about smuggling guns when he and Obama are the biggest
[40:46.960 --> 40:51.480]  guns smugglers in U.S. history, to Mexico, to Al-Qaeda, and ISIS, on record.
[40:51.480 --> 40:52.480]  My God!
[40:52.480 --> 40:53.480]  This is insane.
[40:53.480 --> 40:54.480]  Well, they're right back.

[41:57.360 --> 42:00.400]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[42:00.400 --> 42:01.400]  Hey Alex.
[42:01.400 --> 42:02.400]  Welcome.
[42:02.400 --> 42:06.000]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  stupidity.
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.040]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[42:10.040 --> 42:16.800]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[42:16.800 --> 42:18.280]  Living defense saved my life.
[42:18.280 --> 42:22.600]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[42:22.600 --> 42:24.040]  Living defense brought me back.
[42:24.040 --> 42:29.760]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[42:29.760 --> 42:36.760]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill
[42:36.760 --> 42:42.680]  you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake, and then shall many be
[42:42.680 --> 42:46.760]  offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[42:46.760 --> 42:48.600]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[42:48.600 --> 42:53.000]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[42:53.000 --> 43:02.960]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[43:02.960 --> 43:03.960]  Ranny Dewright.
[43:03.960 --> 43:04.960]  Ranny Dewright.
[43:04.960 --> 43:05.960]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[43:05.960 --> 43:06.960]  The challenge?
[43:06.960 --> 43:09.320]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[43:09.320 --> 43:15.200]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[43:15.200 --> 43:20.380]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots for age spots, as they're lovingly called,
[43:20.380 --> 43:26.240]  but since taking your X-2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[43:26.240 --> 43:32.760]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements that I thought,
[43:32.760 --> 43:35.300]  you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a whole
[43:35.300 --> 43:37.220]  I just thought it was a hopeless situation,
[43:37.220 --> 43:38.740]  but when I started taking it,
[43:38.740 --> 43:40.340]  I mean, it doesn't happen immediately,
[43:40.340 --> 43:42.660]  but, you know, over a period of time,
[43:42.660 --> 43:45.980]  I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket,
[43:45.980 --> 43:48.180]  this is working, this is wonderful, you know?
[43:48.180 --> 43:52.300]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know?
[43:52.300 --> 43:54.580]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully
[43:54.580 --> 43:57.300]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[43:58.740 --> 44:01.100]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[44:01.100 --> 44:02.820]  It's very bittersweet.
[44:02.820 --> 44:04.220]  Everything we've talked about has happened
[44:04.220 --> 44:05.780]  just like we said it would.
[44:05.780 --> 44:07.060]  And now we have a lot of credibility,
[44:07.060 --> 44:07.980]  but I don't care about that.
[44:07.980 --> 44:10.020]  I care about beating the new world order.
[44:10.020 --> 44:11.860]  And it's because we have so much credibility,
[44:11.860 --> 44:14.700]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[44:14.700 --> 44:15.900]  And I don't have time to tell you
[44:15.900 --> 44:17.380]  all the stuff they're doing to us.
[44:17.380 --> 44:19.580]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on,
[44:19.580 --> 44:20.780]  but let's just say this,
[44:20.780 --> 44:22.500]  we're gonna see this through to the end,
[44:22.500 --> 44:25.140]  we're gonna stay on air as long as we can.
[44:25.140 --> 44:27.700]  So please pray for us and please buy the products
[44:27.700 --> 44:28.860]  and then forwardscore.com.
[44:28.860 --> 44:31.340]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[44:31.340 --> 44:33.140]  So you know, unlike other products
[44:33.140 --> 44:34.620]  you can buy, they're still great.
[44:34.620 --> 44:35.460]  Do they fund freedom?
[44:35.460 --> 44:36.580]  No, a lot of them don't.
[44:36.580 --> 44:38.740]  These are great products that fund freedom
[44:38.740 --> 44:41.660]  and fund justice when the whole world's waking up
[44:41.660 --> 44:43.020]  and looking for truth.
[44:43.020 --> 44:44.740]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[44:44.740 --> 44:46.380]  They can't bring in all this tyranny
[44:46.380 --> 44:48.140]  and leave people like us on the air.
[44:48.140 --> 44:49.020]  So while you're at it,
[44:49.020 --> 44:51.300]  don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[44:51.300 --> 44:52.780]  Download everything we've done.
[44:52.780 --> 44:54.100]  You can find and save it,
[44:54.100 --> 44:56.260]  because who knows how long we're gonna be on the air
[44:56.260 --> 44:57.700]  and the enemy is trying to destroy
[44:57.700 --> 44:58.940]  everything we ever said.
[44:58.940 --> 45:02.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:20.540 --> 45:23.580]  You are tuned in to the most demonetized
[45:23.580 --> 45:24.860]  and most lied about.
[45:24.860 --> 45:27.740]  The broadcasts are more old and as much as I'm persecuted,
[45:27.740 --> 45:29.260]  I am not a victim.
[45:29.260 --> 45:32.140]  I am extremely honored and extremely blessed
[45:32.140 --> 45:34.460]  to be in this position and to have this amazing crew.
[45:34.460 --> 45:35.780]  But I'll tell you, it's a stressful job.
[45:35.780 --> 45:38.300]  So when you say a prayer, for me or info wars,
[45:38.300 --> 45:40.140]  say it for the crew particularly,
[45:40.140 --> 45:42.460]  because they have to look at all this and know all this
[45:42.460 --> 45:45.940]  and understand this and know that we're not making any of this up.
[45:45.940 --> 45:47.980]  Because believe me, I used to even go,
[45:47.980 --> 45:49.380]  well, I know I'm telling the truth,
[45:49.380 --> 45:51.940]  but maybe the globalists are just acting powerful
[45:51.940 --> 45:53.020]  to scare their own people
[45:53.020 --> 45:55.220]  and they're not really gonna carry out this world government
[45:55.220 --> 45:56.620]  depopulation plan.
[45:56.620 --> 45:58.820]  Well, now we know the little secret hopes
[45:58.820 --> 46:01.500]  that it wasn't as bad as we thought were wrong.
[46:03.100 --> 46:05.300]  And we can all pick up on the danger
[46:05.300 --> 46:08.340]  and pick up on the corruption and we're all upset.
[46:09.340 --> 46:12.220]  We have to be loving and we have to be nice to each other
[46:12.220 --> 46:14.020]  so that we don't destroy each other
[46:14.020 --> 46:16.620]  because that's why the globalists want to destabilize us.
[46:17.620 --> 46:21.260]  I mean, it's so evil, the race fading and the race division
[46:21.260 --> 46:23.260]  and the open demonization of white people
[46:23.260 --> 46:25.260]  is an inherently bad group.
[46:25.260 --> 46:27.860]  By the globalists and by these big corporations,
[46:27.860 --> 46:29.500]  I'll talk about that more next hour
[46:29.500 --> 46:31.260]  and so much on the COVID takeover
[46:31.260 --> 46:33.820]  and so much on the world ID.
[46:33.820 --> 46:36.820]  And we have Ted Nugent joining us.
[46:36.820 --> 46:39.980]  He wants to talk about the smuggling at the border
[46:39.980 --> 46:41.500]  and that viral footage.
[46:41.500 --> 46:43.620]  I mean, I have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen,
[46:43.620 --> 46:46.820]  that anybody, because I don't care about getting the scoop,
[46:46.820 --> 46:50.260]  if Ben Shapiro wanted to go down to McCallan
[46:50.260 --> 46:54.780]  or if Tucker Carlson wanted to go down to McCallan,
[46:54.780 --> 46:57.580]  he probably will, or anywhere.
[46:59.380 --> 47:01.180]  Ted Nugent says he wants to go with me down there.
[47:01.180 --> 47:03.180]  I'm going to take him down there. He's a fellow Texan.
[47:07.020 --> 47:08.460]  You'll sit there for 30 minutes
[47:08.460 --> 47:10.860]  and you'll see kids getting crammed in trunks, okay?
[47:10.860 --> 47:13.980]  I mean, you can't swing a stick in the dark
[47:13.980 --> 47:16.260]  and not hit smugglers down there.
[47:16.260 --> 47:19.460]  And so that's what's so insulting about the left going,
[47:19.460 --> 47:23.060]  oh, Jones made this up.
[47:23.060 --> 47:25.380]  Why would he have cameras and just catch this?
[47:25.380 --> 47:26.980]  Gee, because that's what I do.
[47:28.980 --> 47:32.580]  They all leave with Manila envelopes in hand.
[47:32.580 --> 47:35.060]  Those that do test positive for COVID
[47:35.060 --> 47:37.660]  are driven to one of the several hotels
[47:37.660 --> 47:40.020]  who have contracted with the federal government
[47:40.020 --> 47:42.820]  to act as COVID quarantine shelters,
[47:42.820 --> 47:45.500]  where they will quarantine for seven days
[47:45.500 --> 47:48.380]  before being released into the U.S.
[47:48.380 --> 47:51.460]  And the rest are either bust or walk down the street
[47:51.460 --> 47:53.780]  to the Humanitarian Respite Center
[47:53.780 --> 47:57.780]  operated by Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley,
[47:57.780 --> 47:59.980]  where they are brought in through the front door
[47:59.980 --> 48:02.740]  with their Manila envelopes inspected.
[48:02.740 --> 48:06.140]  They are housed, given bags of clothing,
[48:06.140 --> 48:08.780]  and are then sent off through the back door
[48:08.780 --> 48:12.420]  to various U.S. cities via bus and airplane.
[48:12.420 --> 48:15.460]  It's a nonstop flowing pipeline.
[48:15.460 --> 48:18.180]  Those that take the bus are led across the street
[48:18.180 --> 48:19.580]  to the bus station,
[48:19.580 --> 48:22.300]  and the rest are given rides to the airport,
[48:22.300 --> 48:25.020]  where they present border patrol and TSA
[48:25.020 --> 48:27.900]  with the paperwork inside their Manila envelopes
[48:27.900 --> 48:30.540]  and set off to various U.S. cities
[48:30.540 --> 48:31.860]  where they are either meeting up
[48:31.860 --> 48:35.500]  with some other government agency, NGO,
[48:35.500 --> 48:40.260]  or perhaps even Mexican cartels operating within the U.S.
[48:40.260 --> 48:43.500]  It is the biggest illegal immigration smuggling operation
[48:43.500 --> 48:45.380]  in U.S. history,
[48:45.380 --> 48:47.980]  and it is being run by the federal government
[48:47.980 --> 48:50.300]  on behalf of the United Nations
[48:50.300 --> 48:52.700]  to destroy all American liberties
[48:52.700 --> 48:55.540]  and put us under the boot for 1,000 years.
[48:56.860 --> 48:59.460]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Ries.
[49:04.580 --> 49:06.780]  Well, as we said, you know what?
[49:06.780 --> 49:07.820]  Since we just played that,
[49:07.820 --> 49:09.580]  let's play that full Greg Ries report
[49:09.580 --> 49:10.620]  with audio all the way up.
[49:10.620 --> 49:12.460]  Let's do that for folks right now.
[49:12.460 --> 49:14.860]  Let's just do that for people.
[49:14.860 --> 49:16.980]  Here's that report for people denying
[49:16.980 --> 49:18.820]  that this is even going on,
[49:18.820 --> 49:20.660]  denying that this is even happening.
[49:20.660 --> 49:22.660]  Here's the report from last week
[49:22.660 --> 49:25.700]  when the other crew was down at the border.
[49:25.700 --> 49:26.540]  Here it is.
[49:31.020 --> 49:33.180]  The mainstream media has been talking
[49:33.180 --> 49:35.420]  about a surge at the border,
[49:35.420 --> 49:39.860]  but the real story is a massive illegal immigration pipeline
[49:39.860 --> 49:42.700]  run by the Biden administration.
[49:42.700 --> 49:47.380]  We witnessed it running nonstop in McAllen, Texas.
[49:47.380 --> 49:50.220]  First, Border Patrol delivers bus loads
[49:50.220 --> 49:52.740]  of illegal immigrants to a secured
[49:52.740 --> 49:55.220]  temp processing center on the corner
[49:55.220 --> 49:58.860]  of U.S. Business 83 and West 15th Street.
[50:00.020 --> 50:03.660]  We are told by sources well over 1,000 each night
[50:03.660 --> 50:05.500]  in this area alone,
[50:05.500 --> 50:07.540]  and what we witnessed during the day
[50:07.540 --> 50:09.780]  certainly substantiates this number.
[50:09.780 --> 50:12.380]  We were told by a driver of their operation
[50:12.380 --> 50:15.220]  that they are being tested for COVID-19
[50:15.220 --> 50:16.780]  at this processing center.
[50:18.180 --> 50:21.820]  They all leave with Manila envelopes in hand.
[50:21.820 --> 50:24.420]  Those that do test positive for COVID
[50:24.420 --> 50:27.020]  are driven to one of the several hotels
[50:27.020 --> 50:29.260]  who have contracted with the federal government
[50:29.260 --> 50:32.060]  to act as COVID quarantine shelters
[50:32.060 --> 50:34.740]  where they will quarantine for seven days
[50:34.740 --> 50:37.540]  before being released into the U.S.
[50:37.540 --> 50:40.940]  And the rest are either bused or walked down the street
[50:40.940 --> 50:43.140]  to the Humanitarian Respite Center
[50:43.140 --> 50:47.180]  operated by Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley
[50:47.180 --> 50:49.420]  where they are brought in through the front door
[50:49.420 --> 50:52.180]  with their Manila envelopes inspected.
[50:52.180 --> 50:55.580]  They are housed, given bags of clothing,
[50:55.580 --> 50:58.180]  and are then sent off through the back door
[50:58.180 --> 51:01.820]  to various U.S. cities via bus and airplane.
[51:01.820 --> 51:04.860]  It's a nonstop flowing pipeline.
[51:04.860 --> 51:07.700]  Those that take the bus are led across the street
[51:07.700 --> 51:09.060]  to the bus station.
[51:09.060 --> 51:11.660]  And the rest are given rides to the airport
[51:11.660 --> 51:14.460]  where they present border patrol and TSA
[51:14.460 --> 51:17.340]  with the paperwork inside their Manila envelopes
[51:17.340 --> 51:19.900]  and set off to various U.S. cities
[51:19.900 --> 51:21.300]  where they are either meeting up
[51:21.300 --> 51:24.740]  with some other government agency, NGO,
[51:24.740 --> 51:29.580]  or perhaps even Mexican cartels operating within the U.S.
[51:29.580 --> 51:31.740]  It is the biggest illegal immigration
[51:31.740 --> 51:34.380]  smuggling operation in U.S. history.
[51:34.380 --> 51:37.060]  And it is being run by the federal government
[51:37.060 --> 51:39.060]  on behalf of the United Nations
[51:39.060 --> 51:41.460]  to destroy all American liberties
[51:41.460 --> 51:45.060]  and put us under the boot for 1,000 years.
[51:45.060 --> 51:48.700]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[51:48.700 --> 51:54.540]  So, I'm almost scared to go back to Biden.
[51:54.540 --> 51:55.940]  He's since completed his speech,
[51:55.940 --> 51:57.340]  and they've got the Attorney General,
[51:57.340 --> 52:00.780]  the Anti-American Communist Globalist up there, Garland.
[52:00.780 --> 52:05.020]  And he's got this rabid, crazy ATF guy
[52:05.020 --> 52:07.820]  that said the Davidians shot down two helicopters in Waco,
[52:07.820 --> 52:09.420]  and that's why they assaulted the Davidians
[52:09.420 --> 52:10.580]  and burned it up.
[52:10.580 --> 52:12.420]  No helicopters were shot.
[52:12.420 --> 52:13.660]  It's just totally made up.
[52:13.660 --> 52:15.460]  No helicopters were there the first day.
[52:15.460 --> 52:17.100]  Just, it's total lies.
[52:17.100 --> 52:19.260]  He says that gun owners should not be allowed
[52:19.260 --> 52:20.660]  to have guns, period.
[52:20.660 --> 52:22.420]  You should have a deadbolt.
[52:22.420 --> 52:24.460]  He said gun owners believe that zombies are real.
[52:24.460 --> 52:25.780]  It's why we want guns.
[52:25.780 --> 52:26.980]  Well, that's all a joke.
[52:26.980 --> 52:30.700]  It's a metaphor for the breakdown of society.
[52:30.700 --> 52:36.540]  I mean, you cannot make this up with Pelosi saying
[52:36.540 --> 52:43.220]  that there is no border crisis and things have gotten better.
[52:43.220 --> 52:45.740]  Not only is it on a crisis, things have gotten better.
[52:45.740 --> 52:47.660]  And people go, oh, Pelosi's an idiot.
[52:47.660 --> 52:48.420]  No, she's not.
[52:48.420 --> 52:51.540]  Republicans will now debate that it's not better.
[52:51.540 --> 52:54.100]  She changed the subject instead of totally illegal.
[52:54.100 --> 52:55.500]  He told them to search the border.
[52:55.500 --> 52:57.860]  Giant human trafficking out of control.
[52:57.860 --> 52:59.060]  Governors must act.
[52:59.060 --> 53:00.380]  Congress must act.
[53:00.380 --> 53:02.100]  Local law enforcement must act.
[53:02.100 --> 53:04.180]  You know, in FBI age, it doesn't have federal immunity
[53:04.180 --> 53:06.020]  if he wants to rape a kid in the park.
[53:06.020 --> 53:08.620]  Well, how can Biden sit there and commit all these crimes
[53:08.620 --> 53:08.940]  and do this?
[53:08.940 --> 53:10.700]  He doesn't have the immunity.
[53:10.700 --> 53:15.340]  He doesn't have an executive order or even a law.
[53:15.340 --> 53:17.420]  Or a law or even an executive order.
[53:17.420 --> 53:18.980]  Because those will be overturned by court.
[53:18.980 --> 53:22.700]  And instead, we're now debating, because Pelosi pulled
[53:22.700 --> 53:27.900]  our chain, whether it's better or worse, it's so stupid.
[53:27.900 --> 53:29.500]  Look, your neighbor's house is on fire.
[53:29.500 --> 53:33.340]  Well, that looks like a new paint job's getting done.
[53:33.340 --> 53:36.020]  If your house was on fire, your neighbor's house is on fire,
[53:36.020 --> 53:37.780]  you said, call the fire department, we're on fire.
[53:37.780 --> 53:39.980]  And your wife or husband said, actually, that's just
[53:39.980 --> 53:40.700]  a painting crew.
[53:40.700 --> 53:41.980]  You'd go, you're schizophrenic.
[53:41.980 --> 53:44.100]  You'd call the police or you'd call the fire department.
[53:44.100 --> 53:46.780]  You wouldn't have a debate about whether it was on fire
[53:46.780 --> 53:49.020]  with 20-foot flames shooting out.
[53:49.020 --> 53:51.020]  But Pelosi goes, oh, there's no fire.
[53:51.020 --> 53:52.540]  It's actually getting a new paint job.
[53:52.540 --> 53:53.380]  Everything's better.
[53:53.380 --> 53:54.460]  It's getting better.
[53:54.460 --> 53:56.220]  And so you go, it's not getting better.
[53:56.220 --> 53:57.380]  You liar.
[53:57.380 --> 53:58.500]  It's in a crisis.
[53:58.500 --> 54:04.060]  But she changes the subject to make you debate her with a lie.
[54:04.060 --> 54:06.060]  Instead of saying, you're a lying scumbag and brushing her
[54:06.060 --> 54:07.580]  aside and putting her in prison.
[54:11.180 --> 54:13.260]  Guys, give me a printout of what Biden called for.
[54:13.260 --> 54:14.620]  Because I can't watch the rest of it.
[54:14.620 --> 54:16.060]  And I know this speech is already over.
[54:16.060 --> 54:17.940]  And that was so horrible what he said.
[54:17.940 --> 54:19.380]  And it was so horrible what he did.
[54:19.380 --> 54:20.980]  I just need to get it.
[54:20.980 --> 54:23.020]  I mean, it was a red flag laws.
[54:23.020 --> 54:24.340]  Anybody says something about you?
[54:24.340 --> 54:25.620]  They come and take your guns.
[54:25.620 --> 54:28.780]  That's the extreme version of red flag laws.
[54:28.780 --> 54:30.740]  Any modification on your gun?
[54:30.740 --> 54:33.100]  Now you've got an ATF stamp.
[54:33.100 --> 54:35.860]  Assault and attack all the gun shops and gun stores.
[54:35.860 --> 54:38.460]  Go after anybody that ever bought a ghost parts.
[54:38.460 --> 54:40.660]  Or even having the plans to be able to build a firearms
[54:40.660 --> 54:41.380]  illegal.
[54:41.380 --> 54:42.700]  Attacks on free speech.
[54:42.700 --> 54:44.580]  I mean, just a frickin' nightmare.
[54:44.580 --> 54:45.860]  And we only watch part of it.
[54:45.860 --> 54:47.500]  I haven't been able to watch the rest of it.
[54:47.500 --> 54:49.980]  It's made me so angry about to have a heart attack.
[54:49.980 --> 54:52.860]  To be run by this chai-com that stole the damn country.
[54:52.860 --> 54:55.380]  And the Republicans are still debating whether they stole it.
[54:55.380 --> 54:57.140]  Or debating whether we're under attack.
[54:57.140 --> 54:58.900]  Or debating whether the border is open.
[54:58.900 --> 55:01.900]  Or debating whether they're letting China take over Hong Kong
[55:01.900 --> 55:02.740]  and Taiwan.
[55:02.740 --> 55:04.540]  And now they're at the same time,
[55:04.540 --> 55:06.620]  we're starting a war with the Russians.
[55:09.100 --> 55:10.380]  I need to be funded, by the way.
[55:10.380 --> 55:11.740]  And we got products you need.

[55:25.620 --> 55:27.020]  mineral fusion that's about to sell out.

[55:30.380 --> 55:35.380]  450% off infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com.
[55:37.180 --> 55:39.900]  And all you see is action and delivery from us.
[55:39.900 --> 55:43.700]  All you see is taking action and kicking globalist ass.
[55:43.700 --> 55:45.900]  And it's pathetic we have this gigantic audience
[55:45.900 --> 55:47.900]  but can't find ourselves.
[55:47.900 --> 55:50.660]  The equation is very simple.
[55:50.660 --> 55:52.460]  The mega banks control the media.
[55:52.460 --> 55:54.260]  They control big pharma.
[55:54.260 --> 55:56.820]  They control academia.
[55:56.820 --> 55:59.220]  They control the military, industrial complex.
[55:59.220 --> 56:01.340]  They control big tech.
[56:01.340 --> 56:04.020]  And everywhere that they have been in control
[56:04.020 --> 56:06.020]  in the third world, they have established
[56:06.020 --> 56:10.420]  absolute total despotism and de-immunization.
[56:10.420 --> 56:13.860]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom
[56:13.860 --> 56:16.740]  that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights
[56:16.740 --> 56:18.900]  and so much more that actually threatens them.
[56:18.900 --> 56:22.820]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic,
[56:22.820 --> 56:24.980]  they instead co-opted, turned it upside down
[56:24.980 --> 56:29.460]  and use the idea of equality to actually destroy
[56:29.460 --> 56:32.740]  human freedom and the free market that threatens them
[56:32.740 --> 56:34.620]  and obviously some control.
[56:34.620 --> 56:36.180]  That's why they target info wars
[56:36.180 --> 56:39.180]  because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[56:39.180 --> 56:40.940]  But the only way our transmission gets out
[56:40.940 --> 56:44.500]  is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[56:44.500 --> 56:47.060]  So we double your efforts, we're all on this together.
[56:48.340 --> 56:52.140]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[56:52.140 --> 56:54.860]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts
[56:54.860 --> 56:56.460]  you refuse to accept.
[56:56.460 --> 56:58.500]  If you have a family member suffering
[56:58.500 --> 57:00.900]  from this degenerative mental condition,
[57:00.900 --> 57:03.220]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil
[57:03.220 --> 57:05.340]  from infowarsstore.com.
[57:05.340 --> 57:07.660]  Studies have suggested that fish oils
[57:07.660 --> 57:11.580]  and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure,
[57:11.580 --> 57:13.660]  decrease triglyceride levels,
[57:13.660 --> 57:15.780]  decrease the growth rate of plaque
[57:15.780 --> 57:19.620]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses
[57:19.620 --> 57:21.940]  in joints and the digestive system.
[57:21.940 --> 57:26.940]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[57:26.940 --> 57:31.140]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[57:31.140 --> 57:33.460]  and activity of immune cells.
[57:33.460 --> 57:37.140]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical
[57:37.140 --> 57:40.060]  and calm discussion about actual facts
[57:40.060 --> 57:42.020]  that pertain to reality.
[57:42.020 --> 57:45.020]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member
[57:45.020 --> 57:48.020]  or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[57:51.780 --> 57:54.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:54.780 --> 58:11.780]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[58:11.780 --> 58:13.780]  You want to stop tyranny?
[58:13.780 --> 58:15.780]  Well, so does he.
[58:15.780 --> 58:20.780]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[58:20.780 --> 58:24.780]  It's not actually self-evident that China will absolutely
[58:24.780 --> 58:28.780]  certainly rule this century, dominate this century.
[58:28.780 --> 58:30.780]  I think there's a good possibility that it will.
[58:30.780 --> 58:32.780]  China created more billionaires than all the billionaires
[58:32.780 --> 58:34.780]  could buy in the last year.
[58:34.780 --> 58:36.780]  China took over the planet.
[58:36.780 --> 58:38.780]  China quadrupled its Belt and Road.
[58:38.780 --> 58:40.780]  First it had doubled it, but now it's highways
[58:40.780 --> 58:43.780]  and it's trains into Europe.
[58:43.780 --> 58:46.780]  We are in cardiac arrest and all these idiots
[58:46.780 --> 58:49.780]  are virtue signaling wearing their little mask
[58:49.780 --> 58:51.780]  and Biden's now petitioning the governors
[58:51.780 --> 58:53.780]  to never take the damn mask off
[58:53.780 --> 58:55.780]  because it's a symbol of the death shroud
[58:55.780 --> 58:58.780]  over our face forever.
[58:58.780 --> 59:01.780]  I'm reiterating my call for every governor, mayor
[59:01.780 --> 59:05.780]  and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mass mandate.
[59:05.780 --> 59:09.780]  Please, this is not politics.
[59:09.780 --> 59:12.780]  Reinstate the mandate if you let it down.
[59:12.780 --> 59:14.780]  They want to wage war on independent businesses,
[59:14.780 --> 59:16.780]  on small businesses, on independent media.
[59:16.780 --> 59:18.780]  It's a war on the people.
[59:18.780 --> 59:20.780]  It's a war on freedom because you can't have
[59:20.780 --> 59:22.780]  an America left when the rest of the world is under tyranny.
[59:22.780 --> 59:24.780]  And you can't have info wars on the air
[59:24.780 --> 59:26.780]  if you're going to sell this tyranny.
[59:26.780 --> 59:27.780]  You're going to gaslight people.
[59:27.780 --> 59:29.780]  That's why we got to keep info wars on the air.
[59:29.780 --> 59:31.780]  This is all a concerted
[59:31.780 --> 59:33.780]  UN Global Government Bill and Melinda Gates
[59:33.780 --> 59:34.780]  CHICOM plan.
[59:34.780 --> 59:37.780]  It's all exactly choreographed, laid out, planned.
[59:37.780 --> 59:39.780]  On behalf of our center and our partners,
[59:39.780 --> 59:41.780]  the World Economic Forum
[59:41.780 --> 59:43.780]  and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[59:43.780 --> 59:45.780]  I'd like to extend a very warm welcome
[59:45.780 --> 59:47.780]  to our audience here in New York,
[59:47.780 --> 59:50.780]  as well as our larger virtual audience
[59:50.780 --> 59:52.780]  participating online today.
[59:52.780 --> 59:55.780]  The goal of the event 201 exercise
[59:55.780 --> 59:58.780]  is to illustrate the potential consequences
[59:58.780 --> 1:00:01.780]  of a pandemic and the kinds of societal
[1:00:01.780 --> 1:00:04.780]  and economic challenges they would pose.
[1:00:04.780 --> 1:00:07.780]  I told you back last year,
[1:00:07.780 --> 1:00:10.780]  before Xi Jinping even announced it,
[1:00:10.780 --> 1:00:13.780]  that Communist China
[1:00:13.780 --> 1:00:17.780]  was going to be at the heart of the global
[1:00:17.780 --> 1:00:20.780]  social credit score through QR codes
[1:00:20.780 --> 1:00:22.780]  for you to leave your house, buy or sell,
[1:00:22.780 --> 1:00:24.780]  get on a train, a plane, have a job,
[1:00:24.780 --> 1:00:26.780]  get on an airplane, you name it.
[1:00:26.780 --> 1:00:28.780]  And then Xi Jinping a few months later
[1:00:28.780 --> 1:00:30.780]  came out and said, yes, he's running it with the UN.
[1:00:30.780 --> 1:00:33.780]  It is now official that the UN is preparing
[1:00:33.780 --> 1:00:36.780]  China to run the global QR system.
[1:00:36.780 --> 1:00:39.780]  Oh, and don't worry, that way they're all standardized
[1:00:39.780 --> 1:00:40.780]  and we're all safe.
[1:00:40.780 --> 1:00:43.780]  So you're going to have internal passports worldwide
[1:00:43.780 --> 1:00:46.780]  dictated by the UN and the Communist Chinese.
[1:00:46.780 --> 1:00:48.780]  Data firm head.
[1:00:48.780 --> 1:00:50.780]  China has asked Wahoo to let it run
[1:00:50.780 --> 1:00:52.780]  the global vaccine passport system.
[1:00:52.780 --> 1:00:54.780]  Kind of like the US created the internet,
[1:00:54.780 --> 1:00:55.780]  so we ran ICANN.
[1:00:55.780 --> 1:00:56.780]  Now that's been given to the UN.
[1:00:56.780 --> 1:00:58.780]  Well, the UN is in control of this.
[1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:00.780]  Bill Gates is in control of the UN.
[1:01:00.780 --> 1:01:02.780]  And now they're going to have China administered.
[1:01:02.780 --> 1:01:04.780]  You think, oh, that'll never happen.
[1:01:04.780 --> 1:01:05.780]  Oh, really?
[1:01:05.780 --> 1:01:07.780]  Remember three years ago I made a big deal about it?
[1:01:07.780 --> 1:01:08.780]  And that's when Tim Cook said
[1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:10.780]  Jones must be the platform now.
[1:01:10.780 --> 1:01:13.780]  Reuters had an article saying
[1:01:13.780 --> 1:01:15.780]  Chinese intelligence runs Apple.
[1:01:15.780 --> 1:01:16.780]  And the executive said,
[1:01:16.780 --> 1:01:17.780]  that's what happens when you're in China.
[1:01:17.780 --> 1:01:18.780]  They now officially have moved there
[1:01:18.780 --> 1:01:20.780]  to have tax exemption completely
[1:01:20.780 --> 1:01:21.780]  on corporate income tax.
[1:01:21.780 --> 1:01:25.780]  So Apple's new base is not Seattle, Washington
[1:01:25.780 --> 1:01:27.780]  or Silicon Valley in California.
[1:01:27.780 --> 1:01:28.780]  It is Beijing.
[1:01:28.780 --> 1:01:29.780]  It is Peking.
[1:01:29.780 --> 1:01:31.780]  It is Communist China.
[1:01:31.780 --> 1:01:33.780]  Apple's data shows deep dependence on China
[1:01:33.780 --> 1:01:34.780]  as Trump tariffs loom.
[1:01:34.780 --> 1:01:36.780]  And they say in there that the code keys
[1:01:36.780 --> 1:01:38.780]  to every laptop, every desktop,
[1:01:38.780 --> 1:01:41.780]  every phone are held by the CCP.
[1:01:41.780 --> 1:01:43.780]  And the article says it's no big deal.
[1:01:43.780 --> 1:01:46.780]  And I was told, I was banned a week after that.
[1:01:46.780 --> 1:01:48.780]  And Tim Cook said, this is incredible.
[1:01:48.780 --> 1:01:49.780]  Because I actually got that to Trump,
[1:01:49.780 --> 1:01:50.780]  the Reuters article.
[1:01:50.780 --> 1:01:53.780]  I got it to him through a Fox TV host.
[1:01:53.780 --> 1:01:54.780]  Boy, did they get pissed.
[1:01:54.780 --> 1:01:56.780]  That was the last straw.
[1:01:56.780 --> 1:01:58.780]  When Trump said, excuse me,
[1:01:58.780 --> 1:02:01.780]  Apple has codes in China to everybody's phones,
[1:02:01.780 --> 1:02:02.780]  including mine.
[1:02:02.780 --> 1:02:05.780]  He called Tim Cook on the phone, I was told.
[1:02:05.780 --> 1:02:10.780]  And Tim Cook went into a rage later.
[1:02:10.780 --> 1:02:13.780]  So I've gotten pieces of it from every angle.
[1:02:13.780 --> 1:02:15.780]  So it's just unbelievable.
[1:02:15.780 --> 1:02:17.780]  It is the battle over Obama's internet surrender.
[1:02:17.780 --> 1:02:20.780]  That was the Wall Street Journal five years ago.
[1:02:20.780 --> 1:02:22.780]  There's the BBC reporting what I'm telling you.
[1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:24.780]  So I'm going to explain this again.
[1:02:24.780 --> 1:02:27.780]  Worldwide, last March, in every restaurant on the planet
[1:02:27.780 --> 1:02:29.780]  that was computerized, he went in,
[1:02:29.780 --> 1:02:31.780]  they said no more menus, scan a QR code.
[1:02:31.780 --> 1:02:34.780]  That is to habituate you for the new global system
[1:02:34.780 --> 1:02:35.780]  with QR code.
[1:02:35.780 --> 1:02:37.780]  Then they're going to claim problems with that
[1:02:37.780 --> 1:02:39.780]  and demand a face scan, which they're now already announcing.
[1:02:39.780 --> 1:02:42.780]  So China will run a global database with the UN,
[1:02:42.780 --> 1:02:44.780]  controlling everywhere you go, what you do,
[1:02:44.780 --> 1:02:45.780]  checkmate we're taking over.
[1:02:45.780 --> 1:02:47.780]  And our Trojan Horse government,
[1:02:47.780 --> 1:02:49.780]  run by the FBI, the Justice Department,
[1:02:49.780 --> 1:02:51.780]  and all these lawyers that have sold us out,
[1:02:51.780 --> 1:02:54.780]  and Biden are doing it now with enjoyment.
[1:02:56.780 --> 1:02:58.780]  I knew Trump was in battle.
[1:02:58.780 --> 1:03:00.780]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards
[1:03:00.780 --> 1:03:03.780]  and by double talking agents
[1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:05.780]  of the enemy.
[1:03:05.780 --> 1:03:07.780]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[1:03:07.780 --> 1:03:11.780]  They're like, oh, no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[1:03:11.780 --> 1:03:13.780]  And I understand why people aren't to believe that,
[1:03:13.780 --> 1:03:15.780]  because this is scary what's going on
[1:03:15.780 --> 1:03:17.780]  with the global government and the New World Order.
[1:03:17.780 --> 1:03:19.780]  Now that people woke up to the fact that that's real,
[1:03:19.780 --> 1:03:21.780]  they won't somebody to come save them from.
[1:03:21.780 --> 1:03:23.780]  Well, Trump sure has held pride.
[1:03:23.780 --> 1:03:25.780]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices
[1:03:25.780 --> 1:03:27.780]  just tripled for quadruple, depending on the drug,
[1:03:27.780 --> 1:03:29.780]  once Biden signed that executive order.
[1:03:29.780 --> 1:03:31.780]  We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[1:03:31.780 --> 1:03:33.780]  There's just one case of hundreds of things
[1:03:33.780 --> 1:03:35.780]  that Trump had reversed,
[1:03:35.780 --> 1:03:37.780]  and now people are going to feel the sting and the pain.
[1:03:37.780 --> 1:03:39.780]  The energy cost and everything else.
[1:03:39.780 --> 1:03:41.780]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial
[1:03:41.780 --> 1:03:43.780]  to the Senate, where Trump's own lawyers
[1:03:43.780 --> 1:03:45.780]  are attacking him and putting him down
[1:03:45.780 --> 1:03:47.780]  and saying he lost the election
[1:03:47.780 --> 1:03:49.780]  and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity.
[1:03:49.780 --> 1:03:51.780]  Because the fix is in, folks.
[1:03:51.780 --> 1:03:53.780]  The swamp is deep.
[1:03:53.780 --> 1:04:03.780]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[1:04:24.780 --> 1:04:27.780]  It's now hour number two on this Thursday,
[1:04:27.780 --> 1:04:29.780]  April 8, 2021, transmission.
[1:04:29.780 --> 1:04:31.780]  Blessed and honored to be here.
[1:04:31.780 --> 1:04:33.780]  Hi, I'm your host. Thank you.
[1:04:33.780 --> 1:04:35.780]  All right, Ted Nugent was really fired up,
[1:04:35.780 --> 1:04:37.780]  and we look forward to having him on via Skype
[1:04:37.780 --> 1:04:39.780]  in about 25 minutes from now
[1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:41.780]  at the bottom of the hour
[1:04:41.780 --> 1:04:43.780]  to get into the open borders, the gun grabbing.
[1:04:43.780 --> 1:04:45.780]  This could not be a better day
[1:04:45.780 --> 1:04:47.780]  to have him on as Biden just finished up
[1:04:47.780 --> 1:04:49.780]  what he's going to do.
[1:04:49.780 --> 1:04:51.780]  He was talking about stopping gun smuggling
[1:04:51.780 --> 1:04:53.780]  when he and Obama were the biggest
[1:04:53.780 --> 1:04:55.780]  gun smugglers ever with Fast and Furious.
[1:04:55.780 --> 1:04:57.780]  He talked about anybody with Johnny Legally
[1:04:57.780 --> 1:04:59.780]  going to federal prison.
[1:04:59.780 --> 1:05:01.780]  Let's be a son, Hunter.
[1:05:01.780 --> 1:05:03.780]  The hypocrisy,
[1:05:03.780 --> 1:05:05.780]  the richness of this was just
[1:05:05.780 --> 1:05:07.780]  too over the top.
[1:05:07.780 --> 1:05:09.780]  Not to mention all the bodyguards he's got
[1:05:09.780 --> 1:05:11.780]  and the bureaucrats have, the local government has.
[1:05:13.780 --> 1:05:15.780]  But his new nominee for ATF says,
[1:05:15.780 --> 1:05:17.780]  no one should have guns.
[1:05:17.780 --> 1:05:19.780]  You should have dead bolts.
[1:05:19.780 --> 1:05:21.780]  Popped up the clothes and he said
[1:05:21.780 --> 1:05:23.780]  the Davidians shot down two helicopters
[1:05:23.780 --> 1:05:25.780]  in Waco, and that's why
[1:05:25.780 --> 1:05:27.780]  they burned it down.
[1:05:27.780 --> 1:05:29.780]  That never happened.
[1:05:29.780 --> 1:05:31.780]  So that's the type of lying criminal
[1:05:31.780 --> 1:05:33.780]  that this other lying Chi-Com
[1:05:33.780 --> 1:05:35.780]  criminal is pushing.
[1:05:35.780 --> 1:05:37.780]  Dishonor of the American people complete their mission.
[1:05:37.780 --> 1:05:39.780]  So it is a big
[1:05:39.780 --> 1:05:41.780]  open door here where they're going to
[1:05:41.780 --> 1:05:43.780]  have the ATF decide
[1:05:43.780 --> 1:05:45.780]  and interpret laws
[1:05:45.780 --> 1:05:47.780]  and take your guns.
[1:05:47.780 --> 1:05:49.780]  Semi-autos, any modification,
[1:05:49.780 --> 1:05:51.780]  any parts you bought
[1:05:51.780 --> 1:05:53.780]  over the years put together,
[1:05:53.780 --> 1:05:55.780]  they say that they are
[1:05:55.780 --> 1:05:57.780]  taking it all.
[1:05:57.780 --> 1:05:59.780]  So really the big news is the Chi-Coms
[1:05:59.780 --> 1:06:01.780]  are trying to cause a civil war,
[1:06:01.780 --> 1:06:03.780]  knowing that this will trigger a civil war.
[1:06:03.780 --> 1:06:05.780]  And a bloodbath for everybody,
[1:06:05.780 --> 1:06:07.780]  which I'm not looking forward to, which I do not want,
[1:06:07.780 --> 1:06:09.780]  but nevertheless is a fact.
[1:06:09.780 --> 1:06:11.780]  So there you go, that's what's going on there.
[1:06:11.780 --> 1:06:13.780]  Everybody else in the debate, oh, he wants the same children.
[1:06:13.780 --> 1:06:15.780]  No,
[1:06:15.780 --> 1:06:17.780]  he shipped 2 million guns to Al-Qaeda
[1:06:17.780 --> 1:06:19.780]  and ISIS under he and Obama.
[1:06:19.780 --> 1:06:21.780]  It would be like
[1:06:21.780 --> 1:06:23.780]  if a guy had been convicted for raping 100 kids
[1:06:23.780 --> 1:06:25.780]  and then he was given speeches
[1:06:25.780 --> 1:06:27.780]  about how we need to arrest people with child porn.
[1:06:27.780 --> 1:06:29.780]  You're like, okay, we do need to do that,
[1:06:29.780 --> 1:06:31.780]  but you're not the one to be the spokesperson.
[1:06:31.780 --> 1:06:33.780]  My God, this is ridiculous.
[1:06:33.780 --> 1:06:35.780]  But no one ever heads them off with what they've done.
[1:06:35.780 --> 1:06:37.780]  There's not a word
[1:06:37.780 --> 1:06:39.780]  from Republicans about him in Fast and Furious or Obama.
[1:06:39.780 --> 1:06:41.780]  That's kryptonite to these turkeys.
[1:06:41.780 --> 1:06:43.780]  Or
[1:06:43.780 --> 1:06:45.780]  Biden's sowing racial division
[1:06:45.780 --> 1:06:47.780]  when he helped
[1:06:47.780 --> 1:06:49.780]  pass the laws to give black people
[1:06:49.780 --> 1:06:51.780]  three times longer sentences
[1:06:51.780 --> 1:06:53.780]  than white people.
[1:06:53.780 --> 1:06:55.780]  Trump repeals it and he's the racist.
[1:06:55.780 --> 1:06:57.780]  I mean,
[1:06:57.780 --> 1:06:59.780]  it's just too much.
[1:06:59.780 --> 1:07:01.780]  It almost
[1:07:01.780 --> 1:07:03.780]  made me go crazy.
[1:07:03.780 --> 1:07:05.780]  And of course,
[1:07:05.780 --> 1:07:07.780]  the red flag laws.
[1:07:07.780 --> 1:07:09.780]  You know, Trump was like, oh, red flag means
[1:07:09.780 --> 1:07:11.780]  if you've been adjudicated mentally
[1:07:11.780 --> 1:07:13.780]  and you're a schizophrenic
[1:07:13.780 --> 1:07:15.780]  and you were kicked out of the Air Force
[1:07:15.780 --> 1:07:17.780]  was the case they brought to him,
[1:07:17.780 --> 1:07:19.780]  but they never put the Air Force records in
[1:07:19.780 --> 1:07:21.780]  that he was dishonorably discharged
[1:07:21.780 --> 1:07:23.780]  in an Air Force mental institution for two years.
[1:07:23.780 --> 1:07:25.780]  Trump's like, yeah, that guy shouldn't have a gun.
[1:07:25.780 --> 1:07:27.780]  Oh, the conservatives.
[1:07:27.780 --> 1:07:29.780]  Trump wants to, no, no, no.
[1:07:29.780 --> 1:07:31.780]  Okay, well, Trump's gone.
[1:07:31.780 --> 1:07:33.780]  Let's not, bad guy's gone.
[1:07:33.780 --> 1:07:35.780]  Don't have him to kick anymore.
[1:07:35.780 --> 1:07:37.780]  We got Biden saying, if anybody has a concern about you,
[1:07:37.780 --> 1:07:39.780]  it's a SWAT team raid that ensues.
[1:07:39.780 --> 1:07:41.780]  So Civil War, Civil War, Civil War.
[1:07:41.780 --> 1:07:43.780]  Oh, and
[1:07:45.780 --> 1:07:47.780]  it just gets worse from there.
[1:07:47.780 --> 1:07:49.780]  But let me hit the really big news.
[1:07:49.780 --> 1:07:51.780]  I had a Ted Nugent joining us because we'll get back
[1:07:51.780 --> 1:07:53.780]  into all this when Ted Nugent joins us
[1:07:53.780 --> 1:07:55.780]  coming up here in about
[1:07:55.780 --> 1:07:57.780]  22 minutes from now.
[1:07:57.780 --> 1:07:59.780]  Let's look at this
[1:07:59.780 --> 1:08:01.780]  overhead shot, please.
[1:08:01.780 --> 1:08:03.780]  Again, we are a radio
[1:08:03.780 --> 1:08:05.780]  show summercast on TV.
[1:08:05.780 --> 1:08:07.780]  Well, it helps radio listeners, people call the stations
[1:08:07.780 --> 1:08:09.780]  they say, he's talking about, look at this, look at that.
[1:08:09.780 --> 1:08:11.780]  I should around people, every segment that we are
[1:08:11.780 --> 1:08:13.780]  summercast radio on TV.
[1:08:15.780 --> 1:08:17.780]  All right, let's get into it.
[1:08:17.780 --> 1:08:19.780]  AP, U.S. military sites,
[1:08:19.780 --> 1:08:21.780]  rising risk of Chinese
[1:08:21.780 --> 1:08:23.780]  move against
[1:08:23.780 --> 1:08:25.780]  Taiwan. Oh, really?
[1:08:25.780 --> 1:08:27.780]  Rising risk?
[1:08:27.780 --> 1:08:29.780]  Over 100 large ships, including an aircraft carrier,
[1:08:29.780 --> 1:08:31.780]  over a thousand small
[1:08:31.780 --> 1:08:33.780]  ships in a, that's called a flotilla,
[1:08:33.780 --> 1:08:35.780]  having
[1:08:35.780 --> 1:08:37.780]  circled Taiwan,
[1:08:37.780 --> 1:08:39.780]  that's called a blockade.
[1:08:39.780 --> 1:08:41.780]  They're now starting
[1:08:41.780 --> 1:08:43.780]  blockade drills of Philippine islands, too.
[1:08:43.780 --> 1:08:45.780]  Philippines calls it an active war.
[1:08:45.780 --> 1:08:47.780]  That's how wars
[1:08:47.780 --> 1:08:49.780]  start, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:08:51.780 --> 1:08:53.780]  Biden's weakness allows
[1:08:53.780 --> 1:08:55.780]  China to surround Taiwan
[1:08:55.780 --> 1:08:57.780]  with air and sea exercises.
[1:08:57.780 --> 1:08:59.780]  Town hall.
[1:08:59.780 --> 1:09:01.780]  Crazy Nancy, though, says
[1:09:01.780 --> 1:09:03.780]  our border situation has improved
[1:09:03.780 --> 1:09:05.780]  and everything's fine. Just remember,
[1:09:05.780 --> 1:09:07.780]  while we're collapsing, they're expanding.
[1:09:07.780 --> 1:09:09.780]  JP Morgan's CEO admits
[1:09:09.780 --> 1:09:11.780]  something has gone terribly wrong in America
[1:09:11.780 --> 1:09:13.780]  and China
[1:09:13.780 --> 1:09:15.780]  knows it. Big article
[1:09:15.780 --> 1:09:17.780]  where JP Morgan
[1:09:17.780 --> 1:09:19.780]  is signaling basically the end of America.
[1:09:21.780 --> 1:09:23.780]  Because they're heavily invested in China.
[1:09:23.780 --> 1:09:25.780]  Russia says it will keep
[1:09:25.780 --> 1:09:27.780]  forces near Ukraine touts possible
[1:09:27.780 --> 1:09:29.780]  measures
[1:09:29.780 --> 1:09:31.780]  as Biden sends in heavy tanks,
[1:09:31.780 --> 1:09:33.780]  heavy artillery,
[1:09:33.780 --> 1:09:35.780]  medium artillery, light artillery
[1:09:35.780 --> 1:09:37.780]  and anti-tank
[1:09:37.780 --> 1:09:39.780]  missiles.
[1:09:39.780 --> 1:09:41.780]  As well as supplying
[1:09:41.780 --> 1:09:43.780]  attack helicopters.
[1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:45.780]  I've talked to people on the ground.
[1:09:45.780 --> 1:09:47.780]  Yes, you heard me right.
[1:09:47.780 --> 1:09:49.780]  Biden has been supplying European
[1:09:49.780 --> 1:09:51.780]  attack helicopters that he just paid for
[1:09:51.780 --> 1:09:53.780]  to the Ukrainians.
[1:09:53.780 --> 1:09:55.780]  What could go wrong?
[1:09:55.780 --> 1:09:57.780]  So,
[1:09:57.780 --> 1:09:59.780]  there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:09:59.780 --> 1:10:01.780]  This is escalating very, very fast.
[1:10:01.780 --> 1:10:03.780]  That's Reuters.
[1:10:03.780 --> 1:10:05.780]  Merkel joins diplomacy rush
[1:10:05.780 --> 1:10:07.780]  to avert Ukrainian military misstep.
[1:10:07.780 --> 1:10:09.780]  Think so? That's it, Bloomberg.
[1:10:09.780 --> 1:10:11.780]  She's telling
[1:10:11.780 --> 1:10:13.780]  Biden, stop it. I mean, this is how
[1:10:13.780 --> 1:10:15.780]  World Wars start.
[1:10:15.780 --> 1:10:17.780]  By the way, Russia started 500 years ago
[1:10:17.780 --> 1:10:19.780]  in eastern Ukraine.
[1:10:19.780 --> 1:10:21.780]  That's where the Russians come from.
[1:10:21.780 --> 1:10:23.780]  That's where they started.
[1:10:23.780 --> 1:10:25.780]  And they were basically Europeans
[1:10:25.780 --> 1:10:27.780]  that were
[1:10:27.780 --> 1:10:29.780]  going west. The Vikings actually started
[1:10:29.780 --> 1:10:31.780]  a thousand years ago, the first settlements
[1:10:31.780 --> 1:10:33.780]  that are in Russia today.
[1:10:33.780 --> 1:10:35.780]  But 500 years ago, it got official
[1:10:35.780 --> 1:10:37.780]  and started getting czars. It all started
[1:10:37.780 --> 1:10:39.780]  in Ukraine. So, it'd be like
[1:10:39.780 --> 1:10:41.780]  if the Russians were
[1:10:41.780 --> 1:10:43.780]  invading Boston
[1:10:43.780 --> 1:10:45.780]  or New York
[1:10:45.780 --> 1:10:47.780]  or Virginia, it'd be like,
[1:10:47.780 --> 1:10:49.780]  hey, that's not yours,
[1:10:49.780 --> 1:10:51.780]  Russians. Oh, yeah, this is ours.
[1:10:51.780 --> 1:10:53.780]  Now, is the west
[1:10:53.780 --> 1:10:55.780]  of Ukraine Catholic? Absafrican-lutely
[1:10:55.780 --> 1:10:57.780]  and is more alive with the Germans and the Poles? Always has been.
[1:10:57.780 --> 1:10:59.780]  They've had a bunch of wars there.
[1:10:59.780 --> 1:11:01.780]  In fact, more than 10 wars have started
[1:11:01.780 --> 1:11:03.780]  there in the last 500 years.
[1:11:03.780 --> 1:11:05.780]  In fact, most of the European
[1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:07.780]  continental wars start there.
[1:11:09.780 --> 1:11:11.780]  So, history is repeating itself
[1:11:11.780 --> 1:11:13.780]  again in a nightmare pitch.
[1:11:13.780 --> 1:11:15.780]  Napoleon went to Russia
[1:11:15.780 --> 1:11:17.780]  to be defeated. Hitler went to Russia
[1:11:17.780 --> 1:11:19.780]  to be defeated. And it's happening
[1:11:19.780 --> 1:11:21.780]  yet again. History does repeat
[1:11:21.780 --> 1:11:23.780]  by friends.
[1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:25.780]  Here's what's sparking tension
[1:11:25.780 --> 1:11:27.780]  between Russia and the Ukraine,
[1:11:27.780 --> 1:11:29.780]  Bloomberg, and
[1:11:29.780 --> 1:11:31.780]  the U.S.
[1:11:31.780 --> 1:11:33.780]  back systems have been busy
[1:11:33.780 --> 1:11:35.780]  grabbing up the pipelines and infrastructure
[1:11:35.780 --> 1:11:37.780]  and sending troops
[1:11:37.780 --> 1:11:39.780]  into eastern Ukraine that is 90%
[1:11:39.780 --> 1:11:41.780]  Russian and starting a fight. I mean, what could go wrong?
[1:11:41.780 --> 1:11:43.780]  Again, if Russians
[1:11:43.780 --> 1:11:45.780]  were landing in Boston, what do we
[1:11:45.780 --> 1:11:47.780]  kick their ass? Because they're not supposed to be here
[1:11:47.780 --> 1:11:49.780]  doing that.
[1:11:49.780 --> 1:11:51.780]  This is outrageous. And the same folks
[1:11:51.780 --> 1:11:53.780]  that blew up Serbia and turned it over to the Muslims,
[1:11:53.780 --> 1:11:55.780]  a third of it, the same people
[1:11:55.780 --> 1:11:57.780]  that did all of that
[1:11:57.780 --> 1:11:59.780]  are doing it again
[1:11:59.780 --> 1:12:01.780]  while they implode our borders
[1:12:01.780 --> 1:12:03.780]  and while they take our guns.
[1:12:05.780 --> 1:12:07.780]  And as anybody, the good
[1:12:07.780 --> 1:12:09.780]  guy in Ukraine, they've been killing each other
[1:12:09.780 --> 1:12:11.780]  for so long, eastern and western Ukraine,
[1:12:11.780 --> 1:12:13.780]  it's like the bath cocks
[1:12:13.780 --> 1:12:17.780]  of McCoy's.
[1:12:17.780 --> 1:12:19.780]  It's just what's been going on. It's like the bloods
[1:12:19.780 --> 1:12:21.780]  of the Crips, folks, and we shouldn't be
[1:12:21.780 --> 1:12:23.780]  in the middle of it. But instead,
[1:12:23.780 --> 1:12:25.780]  if you won't think of the bloods and Crips for killing each other
[1:12:25.780 --> 1:12:27.780]  on the line of their neighborhoods
[1:12:27.780 --> 1:12:29.780]  in South Central, you'd say, stop
[1:12:29.780 --> 1:12:31.780]  the gang war. No, no, this is
[1:12:31.780 --> 1:12:33.780]  the bloods going over to the Crips territory
[1:12:33.780 --> 1:12:35.780]  to use that analogy and pushing them,
[1:12:35.780 --> 1:12:37.780]  well, I guess the globalists are the blues.
[1:12:37.780 --> 1:12:39.780]  That'd be like, that'd be the blues
[1:12:39.780 --> 1:12:41.780]  going into the bloods territory
[1:12:41.780 --> 1:12:43.780]  and pushing them all the way
[1:12:43.780 --> 1:12:45.780]  out of their territory.
[1:12:45.780 --> 1:12:47.780]  What you're going to get is a war.
[1:12:49.780 --> 1:12:51.780]  And I guess it fits, too, because I guess the Russians are the reds,
[1:12:51.780 --> 1:12:53.780]  even though they're not comies anymore.
[1:12:53.780 --> 1:12:55.780]  So just always
[1:12:55.780 --> 1:12:57.780]  backdrop that.
[1:12:59.780 --> 1:13:01.780]  The China's open for business. We're not open for business.
[1:13:01.780 --> 1:13:03.780]  We're falling apart. Our country's being destroyed.
[1:13:03.780 --> 1:13:05.780]  Our dollar's being destroyed. And
[1:13:05.780 --> 1:13:07.780]  Obyton
[1:13:07.780 --> 1:13:11.780]  is starting a fight with the Russians.
[1:13:11.780 --> 1:13:13.780]  Putin accuses Ukraine
[1:13:13.780 --> 1:13:15.780]  of provocations in phone call with
[1:13:15.780 --> 1:13:17.780]  Merkel.
[1:13:17.780 --> 1:13:19.780]  It just goes on and on.
[1:13:19.780 --> 1:13:21.780]  But don't worry, 400 people
[1:13:21.780 --> 1:13:23.780]  have been charged the capital.
[1:13:23.780 --> 1:13:25.780]  Over 200 for, quote, meandering
[1:13:25.780 --> 1:13:27.780]  in the capital. Just being there, they're being charged.
[1:13:27.780 --> 1:13:29.780]  And facing
[1:13:29.780 --> 1:13:31.780]  seven years in prison, they're trying to charge them with terrorism
[1:13:31.780 --> 1:13:33.780]  and sedition with
[1:13:33.780 --> 1:13:35.780]  60 minutes, like, salivate. Oh, God, Americans,
[1:13:35.780 --> 1:13:37.780]  we can imprison them
[1:13:37.780 --> 1:13:39.780]  and have power over them.
[1:13:39.780 --> 1:13:41.780]  The globalists are so busy trying to dominate America
[1:13:41.780 --> 1:13:43.780]  when they're already running that they're running it in the ground
[1:13:43.780 --> 1:13:45.780]  and the globalists are laughing at us.
[1:13:45.780 --> 1:13:47.780]  All right, we got the
[1:13:47.780 --> 1:13:49.780]  huge, huge, huge COVID news.
[1:13:49.780 --> 1:13:51.780]  We're now censoring
[1:13:51.780 --> 1:13:53.780]  Governor DeSantis on the other side.
[1:13:53.780 --> 1:13:55.780]  Epic is one of only a handful
[1:13:55.780 --> 1:13:57.780]  of domain registers
[1:13:57.780 --> 1:13:59.780]  that promote free
[1:13:59.780 --> 1:14:01.780]  speech and freedom of association.
[1:14:01.780 --> 1:14:03.780]  And they know that big tech
[1:14:03.780 --> 1:14:05.780]  is buying up almost all the other major companies
[1:14:05.780 --> 1:14:07.780]  and engaging in massive
[1:14:07.780 --> 1:14:09.780]  censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[1:14:09.780 --> 1:14:11.780]  That's why they've been massively
[1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:13.780]  expanding their services.
[1:14:13.780 --> 1:14:15.780]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain
[1:14:15.780 --> 1:14:17.780]  or want help building a website or want servers
[1:14:17.780 --> 1:14:19.780]  or any other major service,
[1:14:19.780 --> 1:14:21.780]  they've got it all and they're expanding.
[1:14:21.780 --> 1:14:23.780]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com
[1:14:23.780 --> 1:14:25.780]  and follow that link,
[1:14:25.780 --> 1:14:27.780]  you get all their services at the lowest price
[1:14:27.780 --> 1:14:29.780]  and 25%
[1:14:29.780 --> 1:14:31.780]  of your sign up for a new domain
[1:14:31.780 --> 1:14:33.780]  or a domain you move
[1:14:33.780 --> 1:14:35.780]  goes to fund the InfoWars
[1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:37.780]  and then we get 5% as well for any servers
[1:14:37.780 --> 1:14:39.780]  or any other type of services
[1:14:39.780 --> 1:14:41.780]  that you get from them. So it's a win-win
[1:14:41.780 --> 1:14:43.780]  as we build a true open free internet again
[1:14:43.780 --> 1:14:45.780]  because the globalists are destroying
[1:14:45.780 --> 1:14:47.780]  what was open and what was free.
[1:14:47.780 --> 1:14:49.780]  So infowarsdomains.com
[1:14:49.780 --> 1:14:51.780]  the revolution starts there.
[1:14:51.780 --> 1:14:53.780]  infowarsdomains.com

[1:15:07.780 --> 1:15:09.780]  of all time because people are doing their research

[1:15:19.780 --> 1:15:21.780]  to help carry this
[1:15:21.780 --> 1:15:23.780]  nutrition into the cells.

[1:15:33.780 --> 1:15:35.780]  The supply chains are breaking down.
[1:15:35.780 --> 1:15:37.780]  We try to put it in a bigger order. We couldn't even get it
[1:15:37.780 --> 1:15:39.780]  because getting high quality ingredients is very, very hard
[1:15:39.780 --> 1:15:41.780]  and we're not going to cut corners.

[1:15:57.780 --> 1:16:05.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:05.780 --> 1:16:21.780]  The beast in me is caged by frail and fragile bars
[1:16:21.780 --> 1:16:25.780]  Restless by day and by night
[1:16:25.780 --> 1:16:33.780]  rants and rages at the stars
[1:16:33.780 --> 1:16:49.780]  God help the beast in me.
[1:16:49.780 --> 1:16:53.780]  You have to understand that the illegal aliens being brought to this country
[1:16:53.780 --> 1:16:56.780]  are trying to escape collapsing nations
[1:16:56.780 --> 1:16:59.780]  and that the globalists did orchestrate the lockdown
[1:16:59.780 --> 1:17:01.780]  and their country is even stronger for the IMF World Bank
[1:17:01.780 --> 1:17:03.780]  to control those countries with an iron grip
[1:17:03.780 --> 1:17:05.780]  that we're going under the same iron grip now
[1:17:05.780 --> 1:17:09.780]  will be where they are in five years or less
[1:17:09.780 --> 1:17:11.780]  if this continues.
[1:17:11.780 --> 1:17:13.780]  And so they're being weaponized, they're being used
[1:17:13.780 --> 1:17:15.780]  but it doesn't matter, they're still dangerous
[1:17:15.780 --> 1:17:17.780]  and they'll still lower your wages
[1:17:17.780 --> 1:17:19.780]  and they'll still bring crime waves with them
[1:17:19.780 --> 1:17:21.780]  and they'll still ruin our future
[1:17:21.780 --> 1:17:23.780]  because there'll be a controlled client state.
[1:17:23.780 --> 1:17:25.780]  Look at this headline, just went live on infowars.com
[1:17:25.780 --> 1:17:29.780]  New York to give illegals who lost work during pandemic
[1:17:29.780 --> 1:17:35.780]  one-time payments of $15,600
[1:17:35.780 --> 1:17:43.780]  That is a $217 billion budget
[1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:45.780]  $2.1 billion for illegal aliens
[1:17:45.780 --> 1:17:47.780]  Now, citizens don't even get a third of that
[1:17:47.780 --> 1:17:49.780]  Now you're asking, why would they do that?
[1:17:49.780 --> 1:17:53.780]  Well, my God, what do you think they're going to do
[1:17:53.780 --> 1:17:55.780]  all over the world in Africa and Latin America
[1:17:55.780 --> 1:17:57.780]  and Asia and everywhere else in the Middle East
[1:17:57.780 --> 1:18:01.780]  when they hear, you don't just get a couple thousand dollar debit card
[1:18:01.780 --> 1:18:03.780]  you don't just get free airplane tickets here
[1:18:03.780 --> 1:18:05.780]  you don't just get to walk across and get put in a bus
[1:18:05.780 --> 1:18:07.780]  wherever you want, you don't just get welfare on the other side
[1:18:07.780 --> 1:18:13.780]  you get $15,600
[1:18:13.780 --> 1:18:17.780]  But you know, when you read about Austin
[1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:19.780]  $4 billion of taxpayer money
[1:18:19.780 --> 1:18:21.780]  was just passed last week
[1:18:21.780 --> 1:18:23.780]  it was actually passed on Monday
[1:18:23.780 --> 1:18:29.780]  to pay illegal aliens legal bills when they're here
[1:18:29.780 --> 1:18:31.780]  So that's just the big banks
[1:18:31.780 --> 1:18:33.780]  everybody exploiting this labor
[1:18:33.780 --> 1:18:36.780]  and then you'll see our standard living go down
[1:18:36.780 --> 1:18:41.780]  What did Ross Perot say in 1992 in those debates
[1:18:41.780 --> 1:18:43.780]  when he was on 16 minutes
[1:18:43.780 --> 1:18:46.780]  he was also on CNN, Larry King Live with Al Gore
[1:18:46.780 --> 1:18:48.780]  he said, now listen here
[1:18:48.780 --> 1:18:50.780]  ten years ago
[1:18:50.780 --> 1:18:53.780]  Canada got rid of its tariffs on us
[1:18:53.780 --> 1:18:54.780]  they were paid about $45 an hour
[1:18:54.780 --> 1:18:56.780]  we were paid about $25 an hour in our factories
[1:18:56.780 --> 1:18:57.780]  Now within a couple of years
[1:18:57.780 --> 1:18:59.780]  that came down to $25 an hour there in Canada
[1:18:59.780 --> 1:19:01.780]  and we were still $25 an hour
[1:19:01.780 --> 1:19:03.780]  before the fact that this competition was raising our wages
[1:19:03.780 --> 1:19:05.780]  and theirs as well
[1:19:05.780 --> 1:19:07.780]  Well in Mexico they're paid about maybe a half dollar an hour
[1:19:07.780 --> 1:19:09.780]  What's going to happen is once you
[1:19:09.780 --> 1:19:11.780]  send all the jobs down to Mexico
[1:19:11.780 --> 1:19:13.780]  there's going to be a giant second sound
[1:19:13.780 --> 1:19:15.780]  and there won't even be factories or jobs here anymore
[1:19:15.780 --> 1:19:17.780]  So this is a transference of power
[1:19:17.780 --> 1:19:19.780]  getting rid of our wealth, getting rid of our middle class
[1:19:19.780 --> 1:19:21.780]  trying to be done to take control of people
[1:19:21.780 --> 1:19:23.780]  because the politicians want independent populations
[1:19:23.780 --> 1:19:25.780]  and I guarantee you in 20 years
[1:19:25.780 --> 1:19:27.780]  we'll remember this and we will not be a service economy
[1:19:27.780 --> 1:19:29.780]  they claim it's going to be so great
[1:19:29.780 --> 1:19:31.780]  because if you don't have jobs and factories
[1:19:31.780 --> 1:19:33.780]  and workers and farms and a diverse economy
[1:19:33.780 --> 1:19:36.780]  there will not be money to be able to buy any of that in there
[1:19:38.780 --> 1:19:40.780]  and of course it was all 100% true
[1:19:40.780 --> 1:19:42.780]  but Al Gore made fun of him
[1:19:42.780 --> 1:19:45.780]  No, listen Ross, you don't know anything
[1:19:45.780 --> 1:19:48.780]  First world lifts everyone
[1:19:48.780 --> 1:19:50.780]  lowering us to third world
[1:19:50.780 --> 1:19:52.780]  lowers them even further and kills everybody
[1:19:52.780 --> 1:19:55.780]  which is exactly what Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates want
[1:19:57.780 --> 1:19:59.780]  and what did I say 14 months ago
[1:19:59.780 --> 1:20:01.780]  I said is they launched this lockdown
[1:20:01.780 --> 1:20:03.780]  the third world will implode, they will all flood us
[1:20:03.780 --> 1:20:05.780]  and now you got 10 times the flooding
[1:20:05.780 --> 1:20:07.780]  it's all easy
[1:20:07.780 --> 1:20:09.780]  because the globalists even tell you
[1:20:09.780 --> 1:20:11.780]  they're going to use migrant flows to take over
[1:20:11.780 --> 1:20:13.780]  it's not like I even figured out 2 plus 2 equals 4
[1:20:13.780 --> 1:20:15.780]  they show you
[1:20:15.780 --> 1:20:17.780]  2 plus 2 equals 1984
[1:20:17.780 --> 1:20:19.780]  they tell you
[1:20:19.780 --> 1:20:21.780]  what they're going to do
[1:20:25.780 --> 1:20:27.780]  now why do you think
[1:20:27.780 --> 1:20:29.780]  the lowest COVID numbers for any big state in the country
[1:20:29.780 --> 1:20:31.780]  were in
[1:20:31.780 --> 1:20:33.780]  Florida
[1:20:35.780 --> 1:20:37.780]  because
[1:20:37.780 --> 1:20:39.780]  8 months ago DeSantis
[1:20:39.780 --> 1:20:41.780]  was getting state funding
[1:20:41.780 --> 1:20:43.780]  to pay for all this testing and he said
[1:20:43.780 --> 1:20:45.780]  why do we have hundreds of labs
[1:20:45.780 --> 1:20:47.780]  thousands of tests a piece
[1:20:47.780 --> 1:20:49.780]  hundreds of days
[1:20:49.780 --> 1:20:51.780]  and they're having some 100% positive rates
[1:20:51.780 --> 1:20:53.780]  that's fake, they're doing that for more money
[1:20:53.780 --> 1:20:55.780]  and they arrested a few people doing it
[1:20:55.780 --> 1:20:57.780]  and everybody else quit doing the fake PCR
[1:20:57.780 --> 1:20:59.780]  crap
[1:20:59.780 --> 1:21:01.780]  they'd set it the right way
[1:21:01.780 --> 1:21:03.780]  also you're in the sun in Florida
[1:21:03.780 --> 1:21:05.780]  you're getting D3
[1:21:05.780 --> 1:21:07.780]  you go to Florida everybody still can
[1:21:07.780 --> 1:21:09.780]  so
[1:21:09.780 --> 1:21:11.780]  long before the vaccines rolled out
[1:21:11.780 --> 1:21:15.780]  they had almost no disaster problems
[1:21:15.780 --> 1:21:17.780]  well guess how they handled that
[1:21:17.780 --> 1:21:19.780]  turns out back in March
[1:21:19.780 --> 1:21:21.780]  she had a round table event that CBS News shot
[1:21:21.780 --> 1:21:23.780]  CBS News
[1:21:23.780 --> 1:21:25.780]  that had over 6 million views on it
[1:21:25.780 --> 1:21:27.780]  well turns out that video got picked up
[1:21:27.780 --> 1:21:29.780]  and was getting more popular so YouTube deleted it
[1:21:29.780 --> 1:21:31.780]  and said you don't agree with the UN
[1:21:31.780 --> 1:21:33.780]  you're an elected governor
[1:21:33.780 --> 1:21:35.780]  that had a round table event at the Capitol
[1:21:35.780 --> 1:21:37.780]  with over 15 top
[1:21:37.780 --> 1:21:39.780]  scientists some the best in the world
[1:21:39.780 --> 1:21:41.780]  saying
[1:21:41.780 --> 1:21:43.780]  herd immunity, unlock everything
[1:21:43.780 --> 1:21:45.780]  you can't create a vaccine that protects you
[1:21:45.780 --> 1:21:47.780]  from the common cold, this is made up crap
[1:21:51.780 --> 1:21:53.780]  think about that
[1:21:53.780 --> 1:21:55.780]  and what did YouTube do
[1:21:55.780 --> 1:21:57.780]  by the way we're posting
[1:21:57.780 --> 1:21:59.780]  in the band video
[1:21:59.780 --> 1:22:01.780]  section of Band-Aid video
[1:22:01.780 --> 1:22:03.780]  we're posting the
[1:22:03.780 --> 1:22:05.780]  piece because it was also on state TV
[1:22:05.780 --> 1:22:07.780]  we're not going to copy the CBS piece
[1:22:07.780 --> 1:22:09.780]  we're going to find the state piece
[1:22:09.780 --> 1:22:11.780]  let's copy it right free and put it up
[1:22:11.780 --> 1:22:13.780]  I guess they already got it up

[1:22:15.780 --> 1:22:17.780]  Governor DeSantis holds public health care round table

[1:25:17.940 --> 1:25:23.620]  Foundation all the rest of them at 10 to 21 to 20 30 it's here and only gets worse like being fed
[1:25:23.620 --> 1:25:30.660]  into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all and the rejection starts with
[1:25:30.660 --> 1:25:36.500]  realizing it's spiritual battle diverse evil and stopping abortion we must start value human
[1:25:36.500 --> 1:25:43.380]  life again we must start saying that we are not expendable that we are not disposable that we are
[1:25:43.380 --> 1:25:50.100]  essential until we do that we are all slaves we must stand up and declare our basic god-given human

[1:26:00.100 --> 1:26:09.300]  understand that this is all a test this experience this life on this planet is a reckoning it's god
[1:26:10.180 --> 1:26:14.820]  giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend
[1:26:14.820 --> 1:26:21.140]  eternity at what level we want to go to and it really does come down to that so as saddest things
[1:26:21.140 --> 1:26:25.380]  are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the world as well and realize that god
[1:26:25.380 --> 1:26:31.780]  is the author of our consciousness god is the author of us having our own will god is the
[1:26:31.780 --> 1:26:38.420]  author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing when you look at mainstream
[1:26:38.420 --> 1:26:44.660]  media in hollywood this whole evil culture in washington dc and fauci and the and the mass cult
[1:26:44.660 --> 1:26:48.660]  it's all about dominating your free will it's all about telling you you're dirty you're ugly

[1:29:28.500 --> 1:29:34.260]  election uh the ball was thrown down by biden declaring that a bank robbed the gun manufacturers
[1:29:34.260 --> 1:29:41.220]  and confiscated guns as a declare red flag laws at a level never before seen and the borders
[1:29:41.220 --> 1:29:46.820]  are wide open while polosi says the borders doing better than ever and joe biden is doing a great
[1:29:46.820 --> 1:29:51.700]  job of the board patrol says it's tenfold the previous record under obama this is an incredible
[1:29:51.700 --> 1:29:56.980]  time to be alive but i'm glad ted newgent is there a motor city madman and a great another
[1:29:56.980 --> 1:30:02.340]  fellow texan thank you for joining us sir my pleasure alex i'm celebrating life liberty in
[1:30:02.340 --> 1:30:07.220]  the pursuit of happiness i've got my priorities uh i think we should quote the greatest philosopher
[1:30:07.220 --> 1:30:12.820]  of all times i think we agree that was dirty harry when he said a good man knows his limitations
[1:30:12.820 --> 1:30:18.980]  so as i fight against the curse of self-inflicted apathy and marxism running amok and whatever
[1:30:18.980 --> 1:30:25.380]  creature that is that pretends to be the commander-in-chief and all his crazy supporters the newgent
[1:30:25.380 --> 1:30:32.020]  family is living the american dream because we prioritize we fight like hell as we the people
[1:30:32.020 --> 1:30:37.540]  daring to experiment in our self-government and then we make great music we plant gardens we
[1:30:37.540 --> 1:30:42.580]  go hunting and fishing we train our dogs we have great campfires and a great open communication
[1:30:42.580 --> 1:30:49.060]  heart and soul so everybody makes sure you don't get too depressed because it's never been uglier
[1:30:49.060 --> 1:30:54.100]  but a big salute to you because i gotta tell you alex the founding fathers wanted everybody
[1:30:54.100 --> 1:31:00.660]  to be like alex jones and ted newgent everybody i know and that is to spotlight cockroaches and
[1:31:00.660 --> 1:31:07.620]  hold our elected employees to constitutional accountability boy i'm radical huh now you're
[1:31:07.620 --> 1:31:11.700]  simply being an american you're 70 plus years old look like you're about 60 you're certainly
[1:31:11.700 --> 1:31:16.180]  living the good clean life and i agree with you they want to moralize us they want to break us
[1:31:16.180 --> 1:31:20.980]  because the world is turning against the left and against globalism this is all their desperate
[1:31:20.980 --> 1:31:25.140]  battle of the bulls like what hitler was losing against us in europe he threw everything he had
[1:31:25.140 --> 1:31:28.900]  it it looked like we were losing for a couple weeks but that was really the end of hitler
[1:31:28.900 --> 1:31:34.260]  i i agree with you we've got to keep our spirits up well i gotta tell you i got my son rocko here
[1:31:34.260 --> 1:31:39.060]  next to me of the newgent family we're really cling to god family and country and we have a
[1:31:39.060 --> 1:31:44.340]  nightly campfire here at the newgent ranch in texas and when we get back to michigan and rocko
[1:31:44.340 --> 1:31:49.780]  and i were talking about you know there's elements in uh incidents and occurrences in our history
[1:31:49.780 --> 1:31:56.660]  where the germans pretended that they didn't see the jews being put on trains and then they
[1:31:56.660 --> 1:32:03.380]  pretended they didn't see the smoke coming from auschwitz and we are literally living uh the
[1:32:03.380 --> 1:32:10.100]  precursor the the threat of that kind of condition where people are being put in prison
[1:32:10.580 --> 1:32:18.340]  because they open their diner in michigan and people are being tackled at banks in texas
[1:32:18.340 --> 1:32:23.460]  elderly ladies and i know what elderly looks like i live it every day elderly ladies are
[1:32:23.460 --> 1:32:30.980]  tackled and handcuffed for not wearing a mask when i your humble guitar player in bow hunting
[1:32:30.980 --> 1:32:35.940]  back scrapper can tell you that every year throughout my life when i wear a mask in michigan
[1:32:35.940 --> 1:32:41.380]  to hide my glaring caucasian glow from the deer that i want to get close to with my bone arrow
[1:32:41.380 --> 1:32:49.780]  guess what happens under my mask my cold breath escapes the mask but a woman in texas this is
[1:32:49.780 --> 1:32:57.700]  the most dire of indicators alex that a texan is tackled in a bank for not wearing a mask we
[1:32:57.700 --> 1:33:02.100]  got to be very careful but it's once again a manifestation of cultural deprivation where
[1:33:02.100 --> 1:33:08.420]  we the people who know truth logic and common sense and identify cockroaches we need to spotlight them
[1:33:08.420 --> 1:33:15.780]  and then call our elected employees report on them and hopefully hopefully arrest try convict and
[1:33:15.780 --> 1:33:20.660]  punish them but we're not doing that in a in a meaningful fashion i totally let me ask you
[1:33:20.660 --> 1:33:25.540]  none of this out i'm sure you saw i just finished an hour the most draconian declaration of war
[1:33:25.540 --> 1:33:30.900]  war this is as bad as uh beto's saying hell yes we're going to take your air 15 this is insane
[1:33:30.900 --> 1:33:34.660]  well what do we do how do we counter this they're trying to destroy the n r a they're trying to
[1:33:34.660 --> 1:33:39.060]  bankrupt it n r a's doing a smart thing leaving new york just like trump did same groups suing
[1:33:39.060 --> 1:33:45.460]  n r a are suing me i mean this is a war and listeners do you know it's a war well you know
[1:33:45.460 --> 1:33:50.580]  not just spotlighting the cockroaches i think i think the most important lesson has been hidden
[1:33:50.580 --> 1:33:56.820]  from generations and that's the lesson of old yeller we love dogs when old yeller protects us
[1:33:56.820 --> 1:34:01.620]  from the snake in the cougar when old yeller brings us the newspaper and our slippers we give
[1:34:01.620 --> 1:34:08.500]  old yeller a kiss and a hug and a biscuit when old yeller the same dog we love dearly begins foaming
[1:34:08.500 --> 1:34:15.140]  at the mouth we know what we have to do old yeller but we don't embrace difficult and
[1:34:15.140 --> 1:34:20.580]  discomforting decisions in life i i use the reference of the germans who pretended they
[1:34:20.580 --> 1:34:26.900]  weren't complicit by their cult of denial of what happened during the genocide there are americans
[1:34:26.900 --> 1:34:32.260]  today that are hiding from the indicators hiding from the evidence so here's the answer number one
[1:34:32.260 --> 1:34:37.220]  alex everybody who believes in freedom right now more than ever you have to be a member of the
[1:34:37.220 --> 1:34:42.980]  national rifle association gun owners of america the texas state rifle association all your state
[1:34:42.980 --> 1:34:47.860]  second amendment organizations you have to communicate with your mayor your senator your
[1:34:47.860 --> 1:34:53.540]  congressman your governor on a weekly basis i'm just a guitar player but i know what experimenting
[1:34:53.540 --> 1:35:00.740]  in self-government looks like the answer is to reverse the apathy turn it into activism let
[1:35:00.740 --> 1:35:08.580]  your let your mayor know you believe in demand in law and order and only a mentally deranged
[1:35:08.580 --> 1:35:15.380]  dangerous criminal would want to defund the fire department and release the arsonists
[1:35:15.380 --> 1:35:19.940]  and that's what the defund the police insanity means and let's talk about that because you've
[1:35:19.940 --> 1:35:23.780]  been on the show in the last 20 years a lot but i can tell you were in the middle of a jam session
[1:35:23.780 --> 1:35:27.460]  took a break you are feeling some endorphin right now my friend so you're in a super positive
[1:35:27.460 --> 1:35:33.220]  mode and i agree what do you make though of of of of engaging like you do all over the country
[1:35:33.220 --> 1:35:37.300]  i know we talked the other day you're saying you may go down to the texas border the next few weeks
[1:35:37.300 --> 1:35:41.380]  i definitely want to be there and cover that i mean peacefully i think we all need to go expose
[1:35:41.380 --> 1:35:46.420]  us not just ted newton not as alex jones i think president trump needs to go down to donna texas
[1:35:46.420 --> 1:35:50.980]  and mcowan and go to these centers you can wait 30 minutes and the trucks just pull up with the
[1:35:50.980 --> 1:35:58.020]  little kids never checked just brought in illegally we need to spotlight this as you say well one of
[1:35:58.020 --> 1:36:03.780]  the worst curses that mankind is capable of inflicting on each other uh can literally be
[1:36:03.780 --> 1:36:10.340]  identified by the epsteins and the wine steins of the world that the clintons are in bed with
[1:36:10.980 --> 1:36:20.180]  figuratively and literally speaking when child sex trafficking is ignored but women without masks
[1:36:20.180 --> 1:36:27.620]  are put in jail that women who open their diner are put in jail when a farmer in oragon is arrested
[1:36:27.620 --> 1:36:35.300]  for catching rainwater off the roof of his house into a bucket to use it as you're not allowed to
[1:36:35.300 --> 1:36:42.260]  catch rainwater in some jurisdictions where the liberals have gone totally berserk and conservation
[1:36:42.820 --> 1:36:50.180]  conscientious people didn't fight back we have to fight back on the activist level peacefully
[1:36:50.180 --> 1:36:55.220]  but communicate on a regular basis and yes alex shaman and i with our ted newton spirit of the
[1:36:55.220 --> 1:36:59.620]  wild showing our spirit campfire and all the different incredible communication that my wife
[1:36:59.620 --> 1:37:04.740]  shamanic accomplishes we're coming down to the border because everybody has to know that these
[1:37:04.740 --> 1:37:12.100]  children are being trafficked and the and when you catch a guy doing it he plays dumb well that's
[1:37:12.100 --> 1:37:19.300]  not dumb that's demonic we have to spotlight these devil cockroaches well that's right and the crazy
[1:37:19.300 --> 1:37:23.140]  part is biden didn't sign executive order that would be overturned there's no law the whole
[1:37:23.140 --> 1:37:27.460]  thing's illegal the whole thing's smuggling and and they're just doing it in plain view
[1:37:27.460 --> 1:37:31.140]  disappearing these children all over the country that and the senate report as you know
[1:37:31.860 --> 1:37:38.820]  six years ago found that obama knowingly gave tens of thousands of children to sex traffickers
[1:37:40.820 --> 1:37:44.660]  you know we've been to africa many times and shaman has done a lot of interviews with some
[1:37:44.660 --> 1:37:49.700]  real heroes of law enforcement and the military who have dedicated their lives to saving these
[1:37:49.700 --> 1:37:57.140]  women and children that are enslaved and trafficked trafficked and it's happening on a daily basis
[1:37:57.140 --> 1:38:01.620]  and thank god a big salute to you not just from the newton family alex but a lot of people are
[1:38:01.620 --> 1:38:07.380]  watching you spotlight these devils and we thank you for that but more and more people have to do
[1:38:07.380 --> 1:38:13.540]  it and then they have to act upon it you can't identify a foaming at the mouth dog and then go
[1:38:13.540 --> 1:38:20.020]  back to your gardening you have to deal with the rabid dog you have to eliminate the rabid dog
[1:38:20.020 --> 1:38:26.580]  and if you're not able to do it call your wildlife control off but call somebody complain to someone
[1:38:26.580 --> 1:38:33.860]  when you see something wrong and stupid and anti-logic and untruthful and and against common sense
[1:38:33.860 --> 1:38:39.780]  if you don't act upon it you are complicit absolutely uh ted newt it's our guest i've
[1:38:39.780 --> 1:38:43.620]  interviewed your amazing wife she and but i've never talked to rocco want to come back and
[1:38:43.620 --> 1:38:48.020]  talk to your son some as well ted newt it's with us uh who knows how long it will put his
[1:38:48.020 --> 1:38:51.460]  armor a little bit the next hour we have another guest coming up but they're shutting down churches
[1:38:51.460 --> 1:38:59.460]  in canada the equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control big pharma
[1:39:00.020 --> 1:39:06.100]  they control academia they control the military industrial complex they control big tech
[1:39:06.100 --> 1:39:12.740]  and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute
[1:39:12.740 --> 1:39:20.260]  total despotism and dehumanization it is the western christian idea of human freedom that ended
[1:39:20.260 --> 1:39:25.140]  slavery and then promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them so because
[1:39:25.140 --> 1:39:31.540]  they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and use
[1:39:31.540 --> 1:39:38.580]  the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their
[1:39:38.580 --> 1:39:44.420]  monopoly some control that's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating
[1:39:44.420 --> 1:39:50.260]  them of the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video
[1:39:50.260 --> 1:39:54.980]  so we double your efforts we're all in this together gerald and south carolina go ahead
[1:39:54.980 --> 1:39:59.380]  you're on the air trying to move quicker hey alex welcome would like to say first off thanks for
[1:39:59.380 --> 1:40:04.100]  being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people i've been trying
[1:40:04.100 --> 1:40:10.980]  to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee and i have bacteria infection on my lung
[1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:17.060]  that'll never go away uh living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years
[1:40:17.060 --> 1:40:22.580]  that almost killed me living defense brought me back i wanted to just quote from the bible
[1:40:22.580 --> 1:40:29.700]  jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you
[1:40:29.700 --> 1:40:37.220]  up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake
[1:40:37.220 --> 1:40:43.460]  and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another right where
[1:40:43.460 --> 1:40:48.020]  we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the founding of this country no matter what
[1:40:48.020 --> 1:40:56.340]  they say and that's why the enemy hates it because god created this country you cannot hide a grand
[1:40:56.340 --> 1:41:03.860]  assault america is about to have its energy cut off its borders destroyed its dollar brought down
[1:41:03.860 --> 1:41:10.340]  to nothing all of you that have served satan believe that you are on the right team you're
[1:41:10.340 --> 1:41:18.900]  about to find out how pathetic you are so i ask all of you who are awake and who love god stop living
[1:41:18.900 --> 1:41:26.900]  in fear the enemy is about to expose itself the enemy can't help itself the enemy comes to kill
[1:41:27.460 --> 1:41:34.340]  steal and destroy we sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it we should but
[1:41:34.340 --> 1:41:41.220]  once it comes through once it hits us once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us
[1:41:42.020 --> 1:41:47.940]  we just have to point out we try to stop it so prepare yourselves america you're going under
[1:41:47.940 --> 1:41:53.940]  judgment just like all the children that were aborted this is the truth this is the info war

[1:44:34.420 --> 1:44:39.060]  negative as things are we need to be positive spiritually to gut level but also we need to
[1:44:39.060 --> 1:44:44.020]  take action so some more examples of that in and then rocko i know you're a articulate person
[1:44:44.020 --> 1:44:50.420]  in your own right the great son of ted newton what is your view on all this man i'm a little bit
[1:44:50.420 --> 1:44:55.220]  more oriented to the metaphysical aspects of it i feel like i got this guy on the front lines of
[1:44:55.220 --> 1:45:00.420]  the uh the terrestrial aspect and me and some of my friends have been tuned into what you've been
[1:45:00.420 --> 1:45:06.900]  doing and others like david ike and i got more interested in like you know who's really behind
[1:45:06.900 --> 1:45:13.940]  the cabal extra terrestrial uh beings that are hijacking energy fields of the planet that are
[1:45:13.940 --> 1:45:19.460]  installing uh slaughterhouses that are you know the motives i totally agree when you hit the bottom
[1:45:19.460 --> 1:45:25.300]  of the rabbit hole whatever it is it's anti-human it's anti-success mm-hmm yes well i think i think
[1:45:25.300 --> 1:45:30.900]  what we witnessed the manifestation on a daily basis who alex i have a lot of really really
[1:45:30.900 --> 1:45:36.100]  smart friends my band my crew we're doing a jam session tonight wake o texas every thursday night
[1:45:36.100 --> 1:45:41.620]  at tucker hall we just unleash the old greasy speakeasy original rhythm and blue is rock and roll
[1:45:41.620 --> 1:45:45.220]  celebration you know should i get the car and drive up there's not maybe i'm gonna do that
[1:45:46.100 --> 1:45:51.700]  i'm telling you the people that joined me for this jam session it brings you such hope and such
[1:45:51.700 --> 1:45:59.220]  positive uh prognosis but you don't fix the bad and the ugly by complaining about it you maximize
[1:45:59.220 --> 1:46:04.020]  your strength taking good care of yourself clean and sober eating good food making sure you get
[1:46:04.020 --> 1:46:10.580]  activity i'm 72 but i could kick the 25 year old ted nujans ass right now i believe you i'm not just
[1:46:10.580 --> 1:46:16.020]  you're pretty intimidating a person how have you gotten stronger over the years well again uh
[1:46:16.020 --> 1:46:20.580]  prioritization i've always been clean and sober when you're clean and sober you're able to make
[1:46:20.580 --> 1:46:25.940]  smart decisions in life and rocko has followed that path of taking good care of your spirit your
[1:46:25.940 --> 1:46:30.900]  mind your body and your soul and if you met all my sons and daughters and grandkids my band my
[1:46:30.900 --> 1:46:36.020]  crew the guys i'm jamming with every thursday night here in waco at tucker hall well i mean you could
[1:46:36.020 --> 1:46:41.300]  be fooled and spoiled into believing that the world is literally perfect but after we recharge our
[1:46:41.300 --> 1:46:46.500]  batteries we go back into well that's the thing when i'm around christians conservatives nationless
[1:46:46.500 --> 1:46:51.540]  patriots black white doesn't matter they're so alive and you see leftist you go to downtown austin
[1:46:51.540 --> 1:46:57.380]  or downtown la they look like somebody sucked their damn soul well again try to find a human
[1:46:57.380 --> 1:47:01.620]  being who can really sound like they make sense or believe in what they're saying that would watch
[1:47:01.620 --> 1:47:08.980]  joe biden attempt to form a sentence try to make a statement try to make some meaningful delivery
[1:47:08.980 --> 1:47:14.500]  and and have them explain how this man is the commander in chief of the greatest nation the
[1:47:14.500 --> 1:47:19.460]  strongest nation the most quality of life nation in the history of the world you have to literally be
[1:47:19.460 --> 1:47:25.220]  a zombie to believe what is happening politically in this country and it's a direct result of the
[1:47:25.220 --> 1:47:31.380]  apathy where good people let it happen i say we stop letting it happen i agree but the globalists
[1:47:31.380 --> 1:47:36.420]  are smart they put him into demoralize america because trump made his look strong build back
[1:47:36.420 --> 1:47:41.780]  made us stronger but realizing our own strength and god strength this is meant to be the poison to
[1:47:41.780 --> 1:47:48.260]  the antidote and i i sense that it's meant to be the call to action for everyone to get into
[1:47:48.260 --> 1:47:53.140]  metaphysical spiritual alignment with themselves self realization then self actualization your
[1:47:53.140 --> 1:47:59.220]  body mind spirit conflicts first because there are parasitic and uh entities that you know whether
[1:47:59.220 --> 1:48:04.020]  they're in a body or not they want to feed off of someone else's energy the other democrats are
[1:48:04.020 --> 1:48:09.860]  definitely parasites i mean they literally want to punish the hardest-working people and reward
[1:48:09.860 --> 1:48:16.180]  those who refuse to be productive and it's a choice they made the choice to not be in the asset column
[1:48:16.180 --> 1:48:22.180]  my family teboroco saying whether we look at us an art type or real the globalists i've talked to
[1:48:22.180 --> 1:48:26.100]  some of their top psychiatrists that have defected over to our side they teach them in their brain
[1:48:26.100 --> 1:48:30.900]  washing and gaslighting of us to have their own centered will and who they are and remember that
[1:48:30.900 --> 1:48:35.380]  they're just manipulating us but we need to become centered again and realize who we are we stand for
[1:48:35.380 --> 1:48:40.260]  and not let what they do to us affect does that make sense yeah i would say you have to be in the
[1:48:40.260 --> 1:48:47.460]  asset column i would say that the the the more subtle aspect of that is about being unity consciousness
[1:48:47.460 --> 1:48:52.340]  and crystalline in your own perception seeing very clearly but first you have to see yourself
[1:48:52.340 --> 1:48:56.900]  clearly not project all of these problems out into the world yes first take accountability and then
[1:48:56.900 --> 1:49:03.220]  recognize where the the the the gaps or the leaks in the hall or so to speak of the collective are
[1:49:03.220 --> 1:49:08.340]  happening yeah i totally agree with that so so ted what do we do with this gun grab this open
[1:49:08.340 --> 1:49:13.060]  border the globals are trying to break america i think we first realize they're not breaking america
[1:49:13.060 --> 1:49:18.180]  they're trying to convince us they broke us but then what do we do to stop it well once again i think
[1:49:18.180 --> 1:49:23.700]  that the democrats have so turned into the party of the devil everything they do is historically
[1:49:23.700 --> 1:49:28.660]  proven to ruin every culture it has touched they want to turn us into venezuela they want to turn
[1:49:28.660 --> 1:49:34.500]  the whole country into a gun-free murder zone uh everything they stand for you can't go to school
[1:49:34.500 --> 1:49:40.020]  and you can't open your diner but millions of invaders are allowed through your open borders i mean
[1:49:40.020 --> 1:49:45.940]  none of it makes sense so you have to identify that this might be a gift a wake-up call against the
[1:49:45.940 --> 1:49:52.020]  self-inflicted apathy of this country the engineered recidivism of our crime statistics the recidivism
[1:49:52.020 --> 1:49:57.300]  is engineered the courts are doing it they're releasing dangerous people again i use the analogy
[1:49:57.300 --> 1:50:03.140]  you don't defund the fire department and then release the arsonists and that's what the democrat
[1:50:03.140 --> 1:50:09.220]  party stands for it's just bizarre a world but i think even your middle ground people i.e apathetic
[1:50:09.220 --> 1:50:13.780]  non-involved non-participants in the sacred experiment self-government those that don't pay
[1:50:13.780 --> 1:50:20.980]  attention and become apathetic and spoiled they're finally going you literally really so self-defense
[1:50:20.980 --> 1:50:26.740]  is against the law so i can't open my restaurant but people can invade my country and i have to pay
[1:50:26.740 --> 1:50:30.900]  for their invasion i have to pay for their food their lodging i get to buy them new clothes and
[1:50:30.900 --> 1:50:36.180]  we don't even know where the children are going i think this is the most demonic wake-up call
[1:50:36.180 --> 1:50:41.380]  that a society could ever respond to and thank you for sounding the alarm that's what i do every
[1:50:41.380 --> 1:50:46.500]  day that's why we're considered radicals because we're radically involved in a radical experiment
[1:50:46.500 --> 1:50:51.700]  and self-government that provides the greatest quality of life in the history of mankind well
[1:50:51.700 --> 1:50:56.020]  you've always got good instincts and you didn't want to go to dc you just said it's not good you
[1:50:56.020 --> 1:51:00.980]  know it's it's going to be out of control and the anti-fielder you passed on that little inside
[1:51:00.980 --> 1:51:04.900]  baseball and that turned into a big fiasco the left provocaturing the bunch of things but you
[1:51:04.900 --> 1:51:09.140]  told me you do want to go to the border you're obviously just north of me here in texas and
[1:51:09.140 --> 1:51:12.900]  i've already been down there our crew has i'd love to give you a blueprint to go or send my
[1:51:12.900 --> 1:51:16.980]  security guys with you to help you out but we know where to go where you go there and there'll
[1:51:16.980 --> 1:51:22.580]  be buses and cars every 15 20 minutes kids illegally people coming across in yards being

[1:57:30.660 --> 1:57:36.420]  has amazing energy as well what makes you have that energy well again i have 72 years clean
[1:57:36.420 --> 1:57:41.220]  and sobered i've been surrounded by the greatest people in the world i i'm a bow hunter so i have
[1:57:41.220 --> 1:57:45.860]  to have a higher level of awareness to get my dinner with a sharp stick you got to be sneaky
[1:57:45.860 --> 1:57:51.620]  and have tactics and you have to be you know tactically uh tuned in i pursue omniscience i'm
[1:57:51.620 --> 1:57:56.340]  never going to achieve omniscience but when i'm up when i'm bow hunting and jamming with my
[1:57:56.340 --> 1:58:02.180]  incredible musicians my my level of awareness is like a sponge remember alex i got to play bass
[1:58:02.180 --> 1:58:07.300]  guitar for chuck berry and bow diddly i jammed with bb king i jammed with you're saying you
[1:58:07.300 --> 1:58:11.460]  literally psychically mess with these people you you mess with the nature you're tuned in
[1:58:12.420 --> 1:58:19.300]  yes yes and that that literally provides you an energy that all the juicine and all the vitamins
[1:58:19.300 --> 1:58:24.420]  and all the minerals and all the venison can't provide so it's like my son rocko said and here's
[1:58:24.420 --> 1:58:29.620]  a great quote from a native american chief and everybody should write this down and imprint it
[1:58:30.660 --> 1:58:39.380]  god gave you everything you need you already have everything you need you have to know yourself
[1:58:39.380 --> 1:58:47.060]  intimately constantly pursue that inner knowledge so you can put to use these incredible miraculous
[1:58:47.060 --> 1:58:52.020]  gifts you watch some of these great athletes and these great bow hunters and the native americans
[1:58:52.020 --> 1:58:58.260]  crazy horse and coches and sitting bull and you watch how they conduct themselves their spiritual
[1:58:58.260 --> 1:59:04.500]  life with the buffalo and the and the nature that provides them food lodging clothes weapons tools
[1:59:04.500 --> 1:59:11.700]  medicine but most importantly spirit that's why my song is spirit of the wild my tv show is spirit
[1:59:11.700 --> 1:59:17.220]  of the wild my campfire is spirit campfire and people have dug into this and listened to the
[1:59:17.220 --> 1:59:23.540]  lyrics of my song great white buffalo and realized that modern man can be so spoiled that when it
[1:59:23.540 --> 1:59:29.380]  gets really cold outside or there's a flood they can run out of toilet paper i mean talking about
[1:59:29.380 --> 1:59:34.740]  the anti-being prepared voice you're explaining it's not about the material the spirit is everything
[1:59:34.740 --> 1:59:39.460]  with that comes the material and and i can feel that spirit i'm around you that's why they demonize
[1:59:39.460 --> 1:59:43.700]  you people go don't look at ted newton he's bad they don't want you to experience the ted newton
[1:59:43.700 --> 1:59:49.940]  and then there's the spirit's infectious you know and i'm very deep into the spirit world but i also
[1:59:49.940 --> 1:59:55.620]  shoveled my dog kennel so i'm deep into the you're shoveling a poop world so i'm i'm telling you
[1:59:55.620 --> 2:00:00.500]  gotta be in the ground you gotta be a farmer you gotta be real to be connected to god i think so
[2:00:00.500 --> 2:00:04.900]  i think when you do what we do every spring is farmers and ranchers remember i'm just a guitar
[2:00:04.900 --> 2:00:10.500]  player but i've always been fascinated by the earth i've always been that fascinated by that man in
[2:00:10.500 --> 2:00:17.060]  the arena like the gladiator before he went into battle he grabbed a handful of soil and made sure
[2:00:17.060 --> 2:00:25.380]  that the most the most powerful attribute is being down to earth grounded that's what they're
[2:00:25.380 --> 2:00:29.780]  that's what the rednecks are that's what the farmers and ranchers and hunters and fishermen
[2:00:29.780 --> 2:00:34.180]  and trappers and that's what all these people across america exactly on the left is up in
[2:00:34.180 --> 2:00:38.660]  high-rise buildings their whole lives like mold they've never been grounded we need to save them

[2:02:09.540 --> 2:02:14.420]  listeners i know the metaphysical is real i know god's real i know the spirit's like a fire
[2:02:15.140 --> 2:02:18.660]  you can't just keep that fire under yourself you got to share it with other people like this candle
[2:02:19.460 --> 2:02:25.140]  i'm lighting here in studio with ted newton right now on tv and radio with assemble casting
[2:02:25.140 --> 2:02:29.620]  they want to put america's flame out they want to put a republic's flame out
[2:02:29.620 --> 2:02:35.780]  but they can't do it if we continue to share but if they're able to demoralize us and make us be
[2:02:35.780 --> 2:02:40.260]  cowards and make us be fearful they can put that flame out but you're aware of them trying it
[2:02:40.820 --> 2:02:46.020]  they don't have the power to do that anymore and so ted you just knocked it out of the park some
[2:02:46.020 --> 2:02:49.780]  stations just joined us i've talked about knowing you because i've known a lot of people you know
[2:02:49.780 --> 2:02:53.620]  more famous people than i have but a lot of famous people have something about them a spark
[2:02:53.620 --> 2:03:01.860]  uh a a a gravitas with you it's a very focused good clean uh you know energy one of the strongest
[2:03:01.860 --> 2:03:05.700]  souls i've ever met your wife's one of the other ones amazing lady you were speaking about that
[2:03:05.700 --> 2:03:10.500]  spirit because the more i get older the more i research i can talk about documents and globalism
[2:03:10.500 --> 2:03:14.500]  and the new old order and facts and bills and history but it really comes down to spirit and
[2:03:14.500 --> 2:03:19.140]  the whole system is trying to suppress our spirit and make us these domesticated idiots it's what
[2:03:19.140 --> 2:03:24.980]  you said we i've i've taken with mike judge out many times hollywood folks that hate my guts we
[2:03:24.980 --> 2:03:29.540]  shoot for an hour at barbecues settle this is so easy i love it they're converted in an hour
[2:03:29.540 --> 2:03:33.140]  really i think converting these people's the answer some of them are evil like polo see you
[2:03:33.140 --> 2:03:38.660]  know obama and biden they're too far gone but a lot of their minions are are are actually
[2:03:38.660 --> 2:03:43.220]  imprisoned i think and so is it worth it to outreach to them or what do you recommend
[2:03:44.020 --> 2:03:48.180]  oh it's absolutely worth it alex i would welcome everybody to come on my facebook
[2:03:48.180 --> 2:03:53.300]  and witness the tens of thousands actually millions almost four million people on my facebook
[2:03:53.300 --> 2:03:58.420]  and i've always preached quite militantly that clean and sober is the only way you're going to be in
[2:03:58.420 --> 2:04:03.060]  the asset column for your mother the only way you're going to be an asset to your family your
[2:04:03.060 --> 2:04:09.300]  neighborhood your country the earth your fellow man is by being tuned in with reality not a
[2:04:09.300 --> 2:04:14.980]  fog not a chemically induced uh awareness because that is actually comfortably numb is
[2:04:14.980 --> 2:04:19.220]  is uncomfortably dumb but when you're clean and sobering you take good care of your body it's a
[2:04:19.220 --> 2:04:28.180]  sacred temple you will discover pulsations and an electricity and and sounds and sights that
[2:04:28.180 --> 2:04:34.020]  otherwise you're unaware of let let me put it in a most graphic way there is a movement in this
[2:04:34.020 --> 2:04:40.180]  country to ban hunting well i was with the grovan and the acidaboyne up in montana hunting buffalo
[2:04:40.180 --> 2:04:44.500]  because the land i don't care how much land it is will only support so much wildlife so
[2:04:44.500 --> 2:04:51.220]  they harvest buffalo every year for food clothing shelter medicine tools and spirit and when i have
[2:04:51.220 --> 2:04:58.660]  a cycle yes when i finally put my sharp arrow when i use god's gifts to be stealthy and tuned in
[2:04:58.660 --> 2:05:04.580]  as a predator i killed that buffalo and the the snow started coming alec bear with me a second
[2:05:04.580 --> 2:05:10.740]  i'll make it as short as i can take your time we we approached the dead buffalo and the hair on my
[2:05:10.740 --> 2:05:15.460]  arms was standing up like it is right now and it's such a magnificent beast but you know you
[2:05:15.460 --> 2:05:22.260]  killed it you know you you accepted it as a gift from the great spirit and we lit some sweet grass
[2:05:22.260 --> 2:05:27.060]  and the wind was howling and blowing the scent of this sweet grass which is a ritual of the
[2:05:27.060 --> 2:05:34.820]  native americans alex as he as the chief handed me the sweet grass to pray at the body of the
[2:05:34.820 --> 2:05:44.820]  buffalo for for providing us life i swear to god the wind stopped the snow stopped i'm holding this
[2:05:44.820 --> 2:05:49.940]  sweet grass burning over the body of this buffalo that i was given as a gift of life
[2:05:50.500 --> 2:05:57.780]  and i looked to the sky and there's an eagle soaring where just seconds ago it was overcasted
[2:05:57.780 --> 2:06:05.220]  howling and snowing and i i cried like a baby and the the chief put his arm around me and we didn't
[2:06:05.220 --> 2:06:12.660]  say a word but there's a spirituality to the physics of life and if we seek that higher level
[2:06:12.660 --> 2:06:18.100]  of awareness and you attain it when you harvest your own food and clothing like i have done my
[2:06:18.100 --> 2:06:24.260]  whole life not exclusively i still go to the store for hardware but i i the whole system is about
[2:06:24.260 --> 2:06:28.660]  taking us out of that keep going explain this the minutes we have left exactly our our communion
[2:06:28.660 --> 2:06:33.300]  with god's creation is like a form of worship of god and the native americans know that that's why
[2:06:33.300 --> 2:06:37.300]  they lied about you instead you hate native americans when your whole career has been promoting them
[2:06:37.300 --> 2:06:43.220]  because they're scared of them coming together yes well i know that the spirit is on my side the
[2:06:43.220 --> 2:06:49.700]  native american tribes and i are blood brothers we share sweat lodges we share spirit we share
[2:06:49.700 --> 2:06:55.620]  political activism to get our rights back to get our freedom back so when you condemn ted
[2:06:55.620 --> 2:07:00.580]  newton for murdering innocent animals you're literally spitting on the grave of crazy horse
[2:07:00.580 --> 2:07:07.460]  and sitting bull which is a which is a perfect example of the spiritual deadness this explain
[2:07:07.460 --> 2:07:11.460]  to people that if there aren't wolves and coyotes there isn't stuff you know population of deer
[2:07:11.460 --> 2:07:17.140]  like austin but this is harvesting that we make the land better when we use it i mean it's a fraud
[2:07:17.140 --> 2:07:21.380]  the idea that we should just go to mcdonald's and eat some bill gates gmo hamburger instead of going
[2:07:21.380 --> 2:07:26.980]  out and bushing in ourselves it's a good thing to do that it's normal it's natural it's a process
[2:07:26.980 --> 2:07:32.180]  that's ingrained in our genetics and when we do that it unlocks all this potential in us that is in
[2:07:32.180 --> 2:07:41.060]  our epigenetics i attribute my aliveness my happiness my my buoyancy my old age athleticism and my
[2:07:41.060 --> 2:07:47.060]  spirit of musical adventure with these great virtuosos i collaborate with i i attribute
[2:07:47.060 --> 2:07:52.580]  that to clean living the discipline of my parents the discipline i learned and continue with my
[2:07:53.220 --> 2:07:59.060]  circle of life my family my band my friends that discipline to be the best that you can be it's
[2:07:59.060 --> 2:08:04.340]  alive and well across this america that's that's why your toilet flushes and that's why your light
[2:08:04.340 --> 2:08:09.220]  goes on that's why you can still buy gas even though biden's trying to make it illegal you really
[2:08:09.220 --> 2:08:17.220]  examine the agenda of the left and it's anti-human it's anti-life bill gates is literally the the
[2:08:17.220 --> 2:08:23.940]  crown of the devil with his agenda of global population reduction and who would trust faulty
[2:08:23.940 --> 2:08:28.580]  with a needle i mean you gotta be kidding me i'm just a guitar player i'm smart enough to know that
[2:08:29.860 --> 2:08:33.620]  oh you're more than just a guitar player you're amazing technology and i can feel
[2:08:33.620 --> 2:08:38.500]  my energy getting stronger i know you're feeling it that so i think the message here today is as
[2:08:38.500 --> 2:08:43.620]  bad as it is this is the enemy desperate striking out so as long as we do the right thing and our
[2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:50.020]  good people we're gonna succeed in the end together i believe that and to that point alex one thing
[2:08:50.020 --> 2:08:56.500]  i've noticed from him is no one can alter someone's energy field that is connected to the creator
[2:08:56.500 --> 2:09:03.620]  within and all of these parasitic parasitic kind of beings they thrive on individuals who are
[2:09:03.620 --> 2:09:09.380]  disconnected from their own source disconnected from their food source disconnected for why they're
[2:09:09.380 --> 2:09:14.020]  alive their purpose their mission what they're here for how they serve others continuously in
[2:09:14.020 --> 2:09:19.300]  reception of benefit and not really connected to the creator this is an example of someone who
[2:09:19.300 --> 2:09:24.100]  has reminded me of you don't access the creator only by closing eyes and going inward although
[2:09:24.100 --> 2:09:28.740]  that's a way but you also embody the creator by continuously giving and connecting to that source
[2:09:28.740 --> 2:09:33.940]  oh and i get so close to god just gardening i mean or just like you said roofing a house it's just
[2:09:33.940 --> 2:09:38.740]  work it's normal human activity uh and that's what they want to take us out of the amazing
[2:09:38.740 --> 2:09:42.420]  all right we got about a minute and a half left teduja closing comment and rocko closing comment
[2:09:43.380 --> 2:09:47.380]  well god bless america god bless the heroes of the military and their families the law
[2:09:47.380 --> 2:09:52.260]  enforcement heroes the sheep dogs who protect the sheep god bless our border patrol who have a
[2:09:52.260 --> 2:09:56.740]  great relationship and god bless people who put their heart and soul into being an asset
[2:09:56.740 --> 2:10:02.500]  set by hard work and sacrifice and risk in the asset column for their family and america
[2:10:03.700 --> 2:10:11.220]  no one can dislodge you from the bond we have with the creator if you are connected to the
[2:10:11.220 --> 2:10:15.540]  creator within if you take the time to honor your body mind spirit temple learning about
[2:10:15.540 --> 2:10:20.580]  trauma learning about our collective trauma learning about our ancestors and becoming
[2:10:20.580 --> 2:10:27.060]  more renewed and ready to be crystalline when when something is anti-life it's anti-crystalline
[2:10:27.060 --> 2:10:31.140]  and that's the metaphor of the antichrist when you get lost in all the conspiracies and i've
[2:10:31.140 --> 2:10:37.300]  definitely like you go alexander gone down deep deep rabbit holes but uh you mentioned epigenetics
[2:10:37.300 --> 2:10:43.780]  bruce lipstick bruce lipton uh joe dispensa the more we learn about our own well-being physiologically
[2:10:43.780 --> 2:10:49.140]  the less that we can be tampered with the less that we can be separated from our own well-being
[2:10:49.140 --> 2:10:52.340]  and then psychologically hijacked that's why they want to isolate us from each other it's been

[2:14:02.180 --> 2:14:17.700]  so
[2:14:17.700 --> 2:14:21.220]  gone over the mountain
[2:14:28.820 --> 2:14:32.740]  the globalists know you're gonna go to the mountains they want to take you under the mountain
[2:14:33.940 --> 2:14:37.940]  they're gonna tell you when over the mountain i don't even tell you come with me i should come
[2:14:37.940 --> 2:14:42.100]  with god and we'll go over the mountain together i think about ten years you know i've known him
[2:14:42.100 --> 2:14:45.460]  for a long time many many years ago but it was like it's not even actually like a big tough
[2:14:45.460 --> 2:14:49.140]  care thing it's like something like what's going with this guy and it's because he's like psychic
[2:14:49.140 --> 2:14:54.500]  and he's dialed in and he'd dial into it and it's just what it is is what it is and then i'm the
[2:14:54.500 --> 2:14:59.060]  same way so it's like i think it's it's that me right there am i trying to say i'm ted newton
[2:14:59.060 --> 2:15:05.620]  it's like i feel like this is my brother and i run into black people hispanic folks women you name
[2:15:05.620 --> 2:15:11.300]  it but particularly men men are able to sink into men women are able to sink into other women's
[2:15:11.300 --> 2:15:17.140]  psychic connections and this is all real and the enemy knows that and they're trying to blanket
[2:15:17.140 --> 2:15:21.940]  that with the racism and all this crap and it's so ridiculous folks here's my frustration so i get
[2:15:21.940 --> 2:15:26.980]  so pissed off i spent hours last night after my children went to bed researching i spent hours
[2:15:26.980 --> 2:15:33.620]  this morning and it's just so ridiculous it should be so easy to beat same thing i said yesterday
[2:15:33.620 --> 2:15:38.420]  they're all that is just santa's won't give black people shots trying to trick black people to go
[2:15:38.420 --> 2:15:48.340]  get shots and then i saw other reports all over the news where when they catch the media lying
[2:15:48.340 --> 2:15:54.980]  or they catch the media doing something they go oh it's racism it has nothing to even do with it
[2:15:54.980 --> 2:16:00.100]  except the globalist actually want to kill everybody and so i've gotten the stacks here
[2:16:00.100 --> 2:16:05.700]  probably 10 articles of them creating race baiting garbage and and flipping it it's like whatever
[2:16:05.700 --> 2:16:10.660]  they're doing they flip it and and and then there's different schools of thought i could spend
[2:16:12.260 --> 2:16:18.340]  an hour on each one of these articles and discover every little piece of it and talk
[2:16:18.340 --> 2:16:26.260]  about how it works and talk about how it's a deployment but at the end of the day you get
[2:16:26.260 --> 2:16:31.940]  caught up in making it your god by giving it all your attention just know this whatever comes out
[2:16:31.940 --> 2:16:37.460]  of these people's mouths is meant to kill your ass i mean you know i got to remind myself all
[2:16:37.460 --> 2:16:42.340]  the time i get caught up just constantly studying these people and they'll drive you crazy because
[2:16:42.340 --> 2:16:51.620]  they're nuts these people are scum man they've got it out for everybody but that's a perfect
[2:16:51.620 --> 2:16:55.780]  example i was thinking of the article and i couldn't remember it and you guys just magically the most
[2:16:55.780 --> 2:17:01.220]  badass career ever pulled it up here's an example we have video of this will help pull it up we'll
[2:17:01.220 --> 2:17:07.700]  play it start next hour 48 hours next summer msnb chicken nibs white evangelicals resisting
[2:17:07.700 --> 2:17:12.340]  vaccinations because they know blacks are the main group not taking it because they figured it out
[2:17:12.340 --> 2:17:18.820]  god bless them so they cut there's white racists don't want you to have a shot what bill gates
[2:17:18.820 --> 2:17:27.060]  literally wants to kill your ass i mean i can't take any more man and they've got all these black
[2:17:27.060 --> 2:17:35.700]  women all over tv here's an example i sent this to the crew i sent it to them sunday and and here
[2:17:35.700 --> 2:17:41.700]  we are four five days later we never air i don't know they can find it but it's it's it's the saturday
[2:17:41.700 --> 2:17:52.260]  night live and they're like coming up on saturday night live black people won't take the vaccine
[2:17:52.260 --> 2:17:56.420]  so they have a black guy with a british accent like he's smart but other black people aren't
[2:17:56.420 --> 2:18:04.340]  they love british accents and it's a it's the black a british guy literally going i'll give you black
[2:18:04.340 --> 2:18:10.900]  people barbecue and all and and watermelon or whatever if you take the shot and the black
[2:18:10.900 --> 2:18:16.340]  guy has like a classic black southern voice like that's dumb i i ain't gonna take that from you
[2:18:16.900 --> 2:18:22.340]  and it's literally them caricatures making fun of black people with a black guy with a british
[2:18:22.340 --> 2:18:28.260]  accent being racist to them because of their accent from where they are saying they're fighting
[2:18:28.260 --> 2:18:36.180]  racism and then it's wrong see it in i mean i can't these people piss me off man and it's constant
[2:18:39.620 --> 2:18:45.780]  i i give you the barbecue you take it you imagine if i had a show
[2:18:45.780 --> 2:18:53.060]  and and i got up there and i went i give you black people some barbecue it would be the
[2:18:53.060 --> 2:18:58.020]  effect you that up you can't this is what i'm talking about it is the bit everything they
[2:18:58.020 --> 2:19:07.460]  say we are is them and at a certain point what is the point of even debating these people
[2:19:08.660 --> 2:19:14.020]  and then they've been caught in so yeah here it is let's cue it up let's cue it up in fact
[2:19:14.020 --> 2:19:17.060]  we have the audio ready right you got the audio ready you guys get pulled up really quick and
[2:19:17.060 --> 2:19:19.620]  great but you they have it okay here it is watch this for yourself
[2:19:27.460 --> 2:19:31.300]  it's okay our computers hey i only have like a hundred thousand dollar computer in there it's
[2:19:31.300 --> 2:19:35.780]  not the cruise fault the hundred thousand dollar computer messes up about one percent of the time
[2:19:35.780 --> 2:19:39.860]  the million dollar computer hardly ever messes up so i can't afford the million dollar switcher
[2:19:39.860 --> 2:19:43.940]  so it just locked up on a bit but but whenever it boots back up we'll play it for you the point is
[2:19:43.940 --> 2:19:53.700]  is that you to the serenade live and they literally have black people trying to sound like they can't
[2:19:53.700 --> 2:19:58.260]  talk to make fun of black people to say you're an ignorant black person because you don't want to
[2:19:58.260 --> 2:20:03.940]  trust a vaccine that's experimental a vaccine that's already killed a bunch of people a vaccine
[2:20:03.940 --> 2:20:07.940]  is connected to people like bill gates that says he wants to kill poor people especially blacks
[2:20:07.940 --> 2:20:14.900]  imagine there was a car dealer that said well sometimes i like to blow people up sometimes
[2:20:14.900 --> 2:20:22.100]  i put plastic explosives in people's cars you wouldn't go buy a car from them but bill gates
[2:20:22.100 --> 2:20:29.460]  is saying all this well we'll go to break we'll redownload that piece because my fault i should
[2:20:29.460 --> 2:20:34.020]  have played it on monday i should have played it on sunday actually i had it for sunday show
[2:20:34.020 --> 2:20:38.180]  time just all messes together and the fact that i didn't play it fly i guess in the computer it
[2:20:38.180 --> 2:20:42.500]  kind of got rotten or something it's not gonna work we'll do a little redownloading
[2:20:42.500 --> 2:20:50.580]  we'll redownload it but you don't need to see the clip you see this crap every day constantly
[2:20:50.580 --> 2:20:57.780]  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[2:20:57.780 --> 2:21:03.540]  and so black folks on average say we're not gonna take vaccines we don't trust your secret
[2:21:03.540 --> 2:21:08.660]  history of experimenting on us and they go have that i give you some barbecue then
[2:21:09.780 --> 2:21:13.540]  where oh but it's a black person talking out of black folks so it's okay here it is
[2:21:14.660 --> 2:21:20.740]  i'm black and i'm british basically and what the royal family was worried the baby would look like
[2:21:23.220 --> 2:21:28.580]  oh isn't it funny he's got a british accent and i'll talk down american what's worse
[2:21:28.580 --> 2:21:35.540]  british racism or american racism let me put it this way british racism is so bad white people left
[2:21:38.020 --> 2:21:45.300]  they wanted to be free free to create their own kind of racism so that's why they invented australia
[2:21:46.500 --> 2:21:48.420]  south africa and boston
[2:21:48.420 --> 2:22:00.980]  for $5,000 my next question is will you take the vaccine right now
[2:22:03.620 --> 2:22:08.820]  it's a lot of bread i could give me a little girlfriend and you could have a barbecue you
[2:22:08.820 --> 2:22:14.100]  could have a barbecue completely vaccinated no it ain't worth it what about you ishauna
[2:22:14.100 --> 2:22:18.580]  you know i can't take that vaccine i am a christian who told you christians can't take the vaccine
[2:22:19.140 --> 2:22:25.460]  facebook and then they have these black women speaking in an effective voice like their idiots
[2:22:25.460 --> 2:22:30.180]  just turn it off sitting congressman but see a bunch of white people hire a black person to do that
[2:22:30.180 --> 2:22:34.660]  to black people and that's the racism that's talking to blacks like they're dumb well i say blacks
[2:22:34.660 --> 2:22:38.740]  must be pretty damn smart because they're thinking like i'm thinking right now because they don't want
[2:22:38.740 --> 2:22:46.180]  to die cancer be sterilized burn in hell all you writers at s&l burn in hell you little noxies
[2:22:46.180 --> 2:22:52.820]  you're the real nazi burn i'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off
[2:22:54.020 --> 2:22:59.540]  the successes and full versus that if you're paying attention you know we've done together
[2:23:00.420 --> 2:23:07.860]  but i'll tell you this the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy
[2:23:07.860 --> 2:23:13.060]  all independent forms of media they're trying to shutter and silence a human resistance so
[2:23:13.620 --> 2:23:18.420]  now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[2:23:18.420 --> 2:23:22.580]  everything you warned your friends and family about it's around to be true so it's now that your
[2:23:22.580 --> 2:23:29.140]  credibility is way up the power structure should have silenced those of us that they can't but it's
[2:23:29.140 --> 2:23:36.900]  up to all of us to not let them silence any of us we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity
[2:23:36.900 --> 2:23:42.740]  and setting on free speech we have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that
[2:23:42.740 --> 2:23:52.580]  long dark night doesn't come so be the polar bears you are the new world order is a planetary
[2:23:52.580 --> 2:24:00.660]  corporate plan for world government but world government is only the control grid now inner
[2:24:00.660 --> 2:24:06.900]  members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality
[2:24:06.900 --> 2:24:13.380]  but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms
[2:24:13.940 --> 2:24:19.940]  that's why they say carbon is bad they are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet
[2:24:19.940 --> 2:24:26.180]  they are playing god they believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities
[2:24:26.180 --> 2:24:33.220]  that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation i know this sounds insane
[2:24:33.220 --> 2:24:40.740]  but if you read the writings of the globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have been
[2:24:40.740 --> 2:24:47.860]  given the information to say no to this plan this is the end of all life on earth as we know it this
[2:24:47.860 --> 2:24:54.260]  is the alien takeover of earth it's so hard for me when i'm cutting ads not get overly excited

[2:29:48.580 --> 2:29:56.500]  going to do it but sheila gunne read joins us sheila gunne read on twitter rebel news dot com
[2:29:56.500 --> 2:30:02.180]  and ezreal van uh for folks just tuned in to recap what's happening the church what's unfolding
[2:30:02.180 --> 2:30:06.900]  what's going on then putting a big sense up around it the the pastor being arrested recently
[2:30:06.900 --> 2:30:12.260]  released and the latest information thanks for joining us well thanks for having me alex and
[2:30:12.260 --> 2:30:16.260]  thanks so much for your ongoing interest in this story it's truly an international story
[2:30:16.260 --> 2:30:21.780]  despite what the mainstream media in my home province would have you believe this church
[2:30:21.780 --> 2:30:28.580]  has been the flashpoint for the fight for religious freedom in canada during the pandemic the pastor
[2:30:28.580 --> 2:30:35.300]  there pastor james coats was arrested and incarcerated for 35 days in a maximum security
[2:30:35.300 --> 2:30:43.620]  provincial facility for refusing to limit his congregation to 15 of fire code capacity as per
[2:30:43.620 --> 2:30:49.220]  the public health orders here in alberta he refused to comply he said it violated his religious freedom
[2:30:49.220 --> 2:30:56.660]  so he was taken into custody he's been released now but the crackdown on his church has not stopped
[2:30:56.660 --> 2:31:03.220]  so let's be clear 50 percent is stand on your head jump on one leg it's all just arbitrary
[2:31:03.220 --> 2:31:07.540]  submission to the state that you're not essential walmart's essential but you're not
[2:31:08.740 --> 2:31:12.420]  yes that's an interesting point that you're pointing out there alex because it's 15
[2:31:12.420 --> 2:31:17.860]  one five percent of fire code capacity but the walmart up the road but the cost go up the road
[2:31:17.860 --> 2:31:23.860]  they can operate at 30 percent of fire code capacity so this virus is truly amazing it knows
[2:31:23.860 --> 2:31:31.060]  if you're going to walmart or if you're going to praise god now yesterday morning the local
[2:31:31.700 --> 2:31:37.860]  rcmp so that's our federal police force plus the provincial health authority alberta health
[2:31:37.860 --> 2:31:46.020]  services and a private security contractor paladin plus a private fencing contractor showed up
[2:31:46.900 --> 2:31:52.820]  i got alerted by members of the congregation who caught it all happening on the security cameras
[2:31:52.820 --> 2:31:59.380]  that are affixed to the church they saw the police execute this raid they started erecting
[2:31:59.940 --> 2:32:04.340]  fences there's actually two that are blocking off the church building as you see there and then
[2:32:04.340 --> 2:32:10.420]  there's black tarping that obscures the fact that this was ever even a church in the first place
[2:32:10.420 --> 2:32:16.500]  basically what they've done is they put this church in a mask because the government could not force
[2:32:16.500 --> 2:32:21.540]  the congregation to wear one and they put up police checkpoints at that's a great point they
[2:32:21.540 --> 2:32:27.140]  literally muzzle the church with a black tarp yes and now as you can see there in that footage
[2:32:27.140 --> 2:32:32.740]  they've put up a police checkpoint at the end of the driveway to prevent people from even accessing
[2:32:32.740 --> 2:32:39.380]  the church property and this i want to point out this is private property this is the state
[2:32:40.100 --> 2:32:47.300]  seizing the private property of canadian citizens because they won't comply with these public health
[2:32:47.300 --> 2:32:51.540]  orders by the way everybody over uses the nazi analogies or the commerce analogies but this
[2:32:51.540 --> 2:32:56.260]  goes on in commerce china i mean this is as bad as it gets this is on a scale of one to ten
[2:32:56.980 --> 2:33:01.540]  it's okay to eight a ten would be mowing the people down with guns i mean this is
[2:33:01.540 --> 2:33:07.780]  unbelievably outrageous yeah this this is something that i would imagine that we would see
[2:33:08.820 --> 2:33:14.100]  it happening to christian churches in hong kong as the ccp continues to crack down on christians
[2:33:14.100 --> 2:33:18.420]  there it's not something that i thought that i would ever see in my home province this is the
[2:33:18.420 --> 2:33:23.540]  kind of thing that i witnessed when i was in northern iraq documenting the plight of the
[2:33:23.540 --> 2:33:29.220]  christians there the persecutions of the christians there but i never thought that i would see this
[2:33:29.220 --> 2:33:34.500]  happening in my home province well she let her gun read i never thought i'd see your prime minister
[2:33:34.500 --> 2:33:40.660]  endorse quote dictatorship he says i want chinese dictatorship i mean this is just people are always
[2:33:40.660 --> 2:33:44.820]  historically they get hit by tyranny that lived in freedom can't believe it until it's run over them
[2:33:44.820 --> 2:33:50.020]  i mean but we're in the process of being run over right now this is happening it well and
[2:33:50.020 --> 2:33:56.900]  where do they go from here so as someone who pays close attention to this i thought when the pastor
[2:33:56.900 --> 2:34:02.740]  was released from jail when they were able to reach an agreement to get the pastor out of jail
[2:34:02.740 --> 2:34:09.140]  because the pastor was going to stay in jail for months because a condition of his bail was that
[2:34:09.140 --> 2:34:13.220]  he had to abide by the public health orders that put him there in the first place and he said
[2:34:13.220 --> 2:34:18.820]  i'll be a prison i'll be a prisoner of conscience then i can't abide by those so a deal was struck
[2:34:18.820 --> 2:34:24.740]  that pastor was released from jail and i thought that was the end of this now they've escalated it
[2:34:24.740 --> 2:34:31.140]  to seizing the church property where do they go let me clear i'm about to say this bold move is run
[2:34:31.140 --> 2:34:37.220]  by the globalist this has been decided at the soros ggping level uh so that what's happening here
[2:34:37.220 --> 2:34:41.220]  is coming to us tomorrow next week next year that's why you're so important right now you're like
[2:34:41.220 --> 2:34:45.940]  thanks for having you on are you kidding my god the only thing is they're not burning it down like
[2:34:45.940 --> 2:34:50.900]  weco right now this is incredible well and that's the thing i don't really know where they go from
[2:34:50.900 --> 2:34:56.900]  here this it for the government to do this it's clear that they grossly misunderstand
[2:34:56.900 --> 2:35:03.220]  christian theology and the christian tradition because when they took the pastor to jail uh
[2:35:03.220 --> 2:35:08.820]  the associate pastor got on the pulpit the following week and preached to a full capacity
[2:35:08.820 --> 2:35:14.020]  because he knew that that was what he was supposed to do and he was willing to go to jail and serve
[2:35:14.020 --> 2:35:19.940]  in a cell right beside the other pastor so the government thinks that seizing the church property
[2:35:19.940 --> 2:35:24.980]  is going to stop the church from gathering boy they're in the steering contest they're going to lose
[2:35:24.980 --> 2:35:30.820]  alex but they are followed they're a bunch of followers and they're run by evil that's why
[2:35:30.820 --> 2:35:36.180]  they can't help themselves here is the incredible footage of the prime minister of the great country
[2:35:36.180 --> 2:35:43.860]  of canada saying he endorses the ccp and total dictatorship here this the level of of uh admiration
[2:35:43.860 --> 2:35:53.540]  i actually have for china um because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn
[2:35:53.540 --> 2:35:58.020]  their economy around on a dime and say we need to go green as fast as we need to start you know
[2:35:58.020 --> 2:36:02.980]  investing in solar i'll be there is the flexibility that i know steven harper must dream about of
[2:36:02.980 --> 2:36:09.220]  having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted uh that i find quite interesting so we're
[2:36:09.220 --> 2:36:12.260]  going to break it back with our guests for another segment ahead of jay dyer with a huge
[2:36:12.260 --> 2:36:19.620]  sparse 2025 2028 report but it's even a lie they don't do any of the carbon taxes or any of the
[2:36:19.620 --> 2:36:24.260]  carbon cuts so everything he just endorsed dictatorship then he said oh china did all
[2:36:24.260 --> 2:36:28.660]  this to save us from greenhouse gases and they're the ones building a new coal power plant with no
[2:36:28.660 --> 2:36:33.140]  scrubbers every week well our clean ones have been shut down she can't do business here because
[2:36:33.140 --> 2:36:39.460]  energy is too expensive uh it's it's we're in check makes folks it's so sad but it's all spiritual so
[2:36:39.460 --> 2:36:44.500]  we'll make a throat in the end we'll be right back with our special guest healer gun read i'm alex
[2:36:50.100 --> 2:36:55.860]  the equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control big pharma
[2:36:56.500 --> 2:37:02.580]  they control academia they control the military industrial complex they control big tech
[2:37:03.620 --> 2:37:09.140]  and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute
[2:37:09.140 --> 2:37:16.340]  total despotism and dehumanization it is the western christian idea of human freedom that
[2:37:16.340 --> 2:37:21.140]  ended slavery and then promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them
[2:37:21.140 --> 2:37:27.940]  so because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and use
[2:37:28.740 --> 2:37:34.980]  the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their
[2:37:34.980 --> 2:37:41.460]  monopoly so control that's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating
[2:37:41.460 --> 2:37:47.300]  the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video so we double
[2:37:47.300 --> 2:37:52.740]  your efforts we're all in this together throughout history there have been two basic forms of
[2:37:52.740 --> 2:37:58.660]  civilizations and different mixes of the two one is born of renaissance the other is born of conquest
[2:37:58.660 --> 2:38:03.860]  one bases its power on having a strong enlightened focused people with an ethos and a culture
[2:38:03.860 --> 2:38:10.740]  and ingenuity art and skill and strength the other is based on the massive number of slaves it
[2:38:10.740 --> 2:38:17.780]  controls with a tiny elite above it america is transferring out of a system based on the ethos
[2:38:17.780 --> 2:38:23.620]  of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high tech slavery that's why the globalists tell us
[2:38:23.620 --> 2:38:28.100]  america was founded on slavery when it wasn't they point out one of our evils so they can
[2:38:28.100 --> 2:38:33.060]  invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters a global permanent lockdown is here
[2:38:33.060 --> 2:38:36.980]  it's already causing millions and millions to starve to death when they're done billions will
[2:38:36.980 --> 2:38:41.460]  starve to death even the former head of the ministry of defense in england and a top general
[2:38:41.460 --> 2:38:46.260]  have come out and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war that's the
[2:38:46.260 --> 2:38:56.980]  facts this is the bill gates new world order weapon granny do right granny do right thanks

[2:44:21.940 --> 2:44:29.140]  go ahead please well alex it's funny that you mentioned you know wake up and really that's
[2:44:29.140 --> 2:44:33.780]  how this church is being treated right now it's being treated like an active shooter event i'll
[2:44:33.780 --> 2:44:38.580]  break some news to you right now that came in to me on my cell phone while i was on break
[2:44:38.580 --> 2:44:43.940]  besides the fact that there's a police checkpoint at the end of the driveway there and 24 hour a day
[2:44:44.580 --> 2:44:50.420]  surveillance on the church they basically set up a command center outside of this church to make
[2:44:50.420 --> 2:44:57.460]  sure that nobody can access it but i'm receiving text messages from people who are there right now
[2:44:57.460 --> 2:45:02.100]  and when i'm off air with you i'm going to zip out back up to the church to cover it but there
[2:45:02.100 --> 2:45:08.820]  are people there who count out overnight there and it's not very nice weather here it's northern
[2:45:08.820 --> 2:45:13.940]  albert it's pretty cold but they spent the night intense because as long as the police are going
[2:45:13.940 --> 2:45:19.460]  to be there they're there and they said now the police are blocking off the public road
[2:45:19.460 --> 2:45:23.460]  exactly because they're scared because they're attempted intimidations backfired this should
[2:45:23.460 --> 2:45:27.780]  be the christian wood stop everyone in canada that can get there i'd say the us but your borders
[2:45:27.780 --> 2:45:32.580]  are so controlled unless you're a legal alien everyone should go there bring pizzas bring
[2:45:32.580 --> 2:45:37.780]  barbecues bring i think of 20 000 people show up it will turn the tide against this tearing
[2:45:37.780 --> 2:45:44.420]  don't you agree everyone should come there tell us where it is so that church is just west of the
[2:45:44.420 --> 2:45:49.700]  capital city of edmonton albert it's really you know just a couple of miles outside of the city
[2:45:49.700 --> 2:45:55.940]  limits it's very easy to get to um and you know it's there's a public road right there you can
[2:45:55.940 --> 2:46:00.820]  get there and for those who listen they must go now what is the name what is the address
[2:46:00.820 --> 2:46:09.140]  everyone must go now it's grace life church west of edmonton and there's a property owner right
[2:46:09.140 --> 2:46:14.180]  next door who is allowing supporters and congregants and anybody involved with the church and there's
[2:46:14.180 --> 2:46:18.900]  no excuses folks i feel a disturbance in the force here i think every i already felt this
[2:46:18.900 --> 2:46:22.500]  just i said i need to come to canada but they won't let me in i covered billard bird they arrested me
[2:46:22.500 --> 2:46:26.900]  put me in jail for a day all of it but it was okay maybe i should get arrested coming but
[2:46:26.900 --> 2:46:32.100]  everyone should come there and stand this is a new tenement square this is literally a communist
[2:46:32.100 --> 2:46:37.860]  china style weager takeover in america so guys punch up the church's address i want to give
[2:46:37.860 --> 2:46:43.060]  the actual address no excuses grace wife everybody needs to go there now peacefully
[2:46:46.100 --> 2:46:49.140]  blow that up for me don't mean physically blow it will say jones said blow a church up
[2:46:49.140 --> 2:46:54.020]  we blow it up i can't read that just show me the address on screen uh that's my eyes are not that
[2:46:54.020 --> 2:47:06.420]  good anymore it's like it's 51520 or 51529 a range road 262 spruce grove ab is that right
[2:47:07.460 --> 2:47:12.020]  yes all right so here's the deal instead of being like and i'm not putting you down because
[2:47:12.020 --> 2:47:16.740]  you're just like me you're like oh thanks for caring that they've put a fence up and arrested
[2:47:16.740 --> 2:47:22.500]  the preacher thanks for caring we we're be we're under attack okay you're under attack so are we
[2:47:22.500 --> 2:47:27.780]  all of us need to go there if you're in canada or if you're near the border you get in legally
[2:47:27.780 --> 2:47:34.580]  go there peacefully give aid and comfort to christians under chai com governor attack the chai
[2:47:34.580 --> 2:47:39.540]  com agent i just showed you him pledging allegiance is easy paying for a dough everyone should go
[2:47:39.540 --> 2:47:43.540]  there's you so they're scared aren't they they're now trying to block the road tells what's happening
[2:47:43.540 --> 2:47:48.100]  yes so they're trying to block off that main road so on the little map there you can see
[2:47:48.100 --> 2:47:53.140]  that there's a highway that runs right by and then there's a public road that comes down in front
[2:47:53.140 --> 2:47:58.180]  of the church they're blocking that off at the highway it sounds like and what that does is
[2:47:58.180 --> 2:48:03.220]  it actually cuts off all the residents and landowners from accessing their land in the subdivision
[2:48:03.220 --> 2:48:07.700]  adjacent there but that's so they're in full panic they're blocking off major roads now
[2:48:08.660 --> 2:48:12.900]  yeah that's what it sounds like that's the reports that i'm getting from people who are there right
[2:48:12.900 --> 2:48:17.460]  now on the scene that they're there in full panic moment so let me guess if a hundred were out there
[2:48:17.460 --> 2:48:23.540]  yesterday is it bigger today yes uh the weather is worse today but it sounds like there are more
[2:48:23.540 --> 2:48:29.620]  people there today and there were people there alex all night long it got dark it got cold and people
[2:48:29.620 --> 2:48:33.780]  just kept coming and coming and the leftists want their great evil they can't believe you're not
[2:48:33.780 --> 2:48:42.820]  submitting alex i've never ever seen overt satanism in real life before you told me one of them
[2:48:42.820 --> 2:48:49.140]  said satan is good tell people about that i've never seen overt satanism like that as you and i
[2:48:49.140 --> 2:48:56.260]  both know that the enemy works through all kinds of people but this person drove by in a pickup truck
[2:48:56.900 --> 2:49:02.180]  screamed at women and children whose church they're looking at being locked up so they're
[2:49:02.180 --> 2:49:08.420]  distraught and this guy screams at them that he's happy that their church is being closed and then he
[2:49:08.420 --> 2:49:17.940]  yells at other people and he says to them even the church of satan follows masking laws and that's
[2:49:17.940 --> 2:49:23.140]  why you should do as a christian if you're telling me that satan likes it i'm more i'm more inclined
[2:49:23.140 --> 2:49:28.020]  to not do it but that's the level of public discourse here that the satanists are telling
[2:49:28.020 --> 2:49:32.820]  the i'm telling my listeners i'm telling them if you live in canada whether you're 500 miles away
[2:49:32.820 --> 2:49:38.980]  or 20 you must go there bring some muffins bring some food support these great people because the
[2:49:38.980 --> 2:49:45.300]  system has grown the line here the enemy has run a line at your church the enemy's run a line and said
[2:49:45.300 --> 2:49:50.340]  and so they've they've chosen this as their as their stalingrad and i think we should make this
[2:49:50.340 --> 2:49:57.780]  their stalingrad well and it's very disappointing to see some of the other pastors in the area say
[2:49:57.780 --> 2:50:03.780]  well what why isn't this church making the same sacrifices that i am they're going to sacrifice
[2:50:03.780 --> 2:50:07.860]  to not to be shut down then they're going to sacrifice the traffic kids then they're going
[2:50:07.860 --> 2:50:16.020]  to sacrifice to submit those aren't real churches and god knows it these other pastors i mean if
[2:50:16.020 --> 2:50:24.260]  they can these are pastors these are world council of churches rockefeller pimps well they can
[2:50:24.260 --> 2:50:29.220]  reconcile with themselves and their congregations that they can be both obedient to the state and
[2:50:29.220 --> 2:50:33.780]  to god that's fine but this is a free country and we still have freedom of religion and they
[2:50:33.780 --> 2:50:37.860]  don't get to make those decisions well i predict they've shut that road down because thousands are
[2:50:37.860 --> 2:50:42.900]  missing i i feel it i see it i think it'll be five thousand people tomorrow ten thousand this weekend
[2:50:42.900 --> 2:50:48.660]  i think they've jumped the shark call you need to do it beautiful beautiful soul tell people sheila
[2:50:48.660 --> 2:50:54.580]  gun read come peacefully now call them tell them if people are going to come to support grace life
[2:50:54.580 --> 2:51:02.100]  they welcome the support but if you're coming come peacefully um and and come respectfully but they
[2:51:02.100 --> 2:51:07.940]  would appreciate your support they need it now more than ever they their church has been seized
[2:51:07.940 --> 2:51:13.700]  by the state they need all obviously we want to be peaceful but we need you to then call them say
[2:51:13.700 --> 2:51:18.740]  help us call them well i don't want to speak for the church alex they really don't want to just

[2:52:44.820 --> 2:52:50.020]  would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity
[2:52:50.020 --> 2:52:54.900]  wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee
[2:52:54.900 --> 2:53:01.700]  and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away living defense saved my life they
[2:53:01.700 --> 2:53:07.940]  had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back i wanted
[2:53:07.940 --> 2:53:14.980]  to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew 24 verse
[2:53:14.980 --> 2:53:22.660]  nine then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all
[2:53:22.660 --> 2:53:29.060]  nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall
[2:53:29.060 --> 2:53:34.340]  be one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the founding
[2:53:34.340 --> 2:53:39.380]  of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because god created this country
[2:53:39.380 --> 2:53:55.300]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:53:56.980 --> 2:54:04.260]  she looked dumb read is our guest i'm alex jones your host jay dyer is about to break down
[2:54:04.260 --> 2:54:10.180]  the big enchilada that bill gates just responded to us you know bill gates just responded to us
[2:54:12.100 --> 2:54:16.740]  so that's that's that's coming up next segment uh but she'll again gonna read i've been ranting
[2:54:16.740 --> 2:54:21.700]  and raving you're there in canada you're covering this thousands are obviously on their way thousands
[2:54:21.700 --> 2:54:28.340]  have already shown up they're trying to shut down roads this is huge uh other closing comments in
[2:54:28.340 --> 2:54:34.500]  the four minutes we have left uh for me uh i have an interview coming up an exclusive
[2:54:34.500 --> 2:54:39.700]  interview with pastor coats that was that's the pastor of this church who was imprisoned for 35
[2:54:39.700 --> 2:54:48.500]  days i got his first reactions upon pulling up on the scene and seeing what has become of his church
[2:54:48.500 --> 2:54:55.780]  they basically turned his church into the prison where they held him for 35 days so we got his
[2:54:55.780 --> 2:55:02.100]  initial reaction to just how shocking that is um and the church is currently making plans for what
[2:55:02.100 --> 2:55:08.260]  happens on sunday so when i head back out there today alex um i'm going to find out what comes
[2:55:08.260 --> 2:55:12.580]  on sunday how they're going to hold service because they are definitely going to hold service you
[2:55:12.580 --> 2:55:17.700]  cannot keep this church down oh i mean i i'm predicting just with a neighbor that's a patriot
[2:55:17.700 --> 2:55:23.940]  you'll have five times the congregation in the field so what if it's snowing yeah well and that's
[2:55:23.940 --> 2:55:29.780]  the thing this church says um you know they're they're one of those congregations who sees good
[2:55:29.780 --> 2:55:36.500]  things and even the worst of things they say that uh the fact that they have been basically purged
[2:55:36.500 --> 2:55:41.140]  from their own church means that they don't even have to abide by fire code capacity so if they're
[2:55:41.140 --> 2:55:48.980]  forced outside as many uh that want to come can come and they can evangelize to many more people
[2:55:48.980 --> 2:55:53.540]  well that's right the globalists are trying to break the church's will so whether you're Protestant
[2:55:53.540 --> 2:55:58.100]  whether you're Catholic i don't care if you're a buddhist or a muslim everybody should support
[2:55:58.100 --> 2:56:03.540]  religious freedom and if people don't support this then it's on them this is unbelievable and it's
[2:56:03.540 --> 2:56:10.420]  happening all over canada but this church is stood up they have and this church has exhibited such
[2:56:10.420 --> 2:56:18.260]  a dignity when they're dealing with the police i saw yesterday that this church went over and invited
[2:56:18.260 --> 2:56:24.820]  the cops who were locking down their church to attend their services on sunday they don't have
[2:56:24.820 --> 2:56:31.380]  an ounce of anger or resentment for the cops in their heart they have nothing but forgiveness
[2:56:31.380 --> 2:56:37.540]  and kindness i'm not there yet alex um maybe if i spend more time with them maybe they'll change
[2:56:37.540 --> 2:56:42.580]  my heart a little bit too um but that that's the kind of people they are that they won't they won't
[2:56:42.580 --> 2:56:49.380]  be deterred they're not angry but they are called by christ to gather and they will gather well that's
[2:56:49.380 --> 2:56:55.060]  right there's a time to reap a tire type of so time to live a time to die and and i i just know
[2:56:55.060 --> 2:56:59.700]  that evil is throwing its full weight against us because we didn't stand up against it so now it's
[2:56:59.700 --> 2:57:04.660]  making its move but people shouldn't get demoralized seeing all this evil and feel weak this is god's
[2:57:04.660 --> 2:57:11.780]  plan being fulfilled we are world government world id to buy and sell a mark i mean this is time to
[2:57:11.780 --> 2:57:16.500]  rejoice that actually everything we were told is coming true and that we know god is at the other end
[2:57:16.500 --> 2:57:22.500]  of this yeah it's the time to separate the wheat from the chaff especially with our spiritual leaders
[2:57:23.140 --> 2:57:28.820]  we can see men of integrity and conscience like pastor james coats at grace life and we can see
[2:57:30.100 --> 2:57:35.540]  the other men of the cloth who are condemning them for a lot of christians this is a real eye
[2:57:35.540 --> 2:57:40.340]  opener because they're finding out that their leaders of their church are not the men that
[2:57:40.340 --> 2:57:46.180]  they thought they were that's right we have test god has test the test is happening now she

[2:58:49.860 --> 2:58:55.860]  collapsing our world they are creating insecurity crime war and famine all of us should do everything
[2:58:55.860 --> 2:59:01.700]  we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our family's sakes but also our community

[3:00:01.460 --> 3:00:11.460]  live from austin texas broadcasting world-wide is alex jones
[3:00:31.620 --> 3:00:41.460]  me
[3:00:41.460 --> 3:00:53.460]  i can feel the quickening
[3:00:53.460 --> 3:01:03.460]  i can see it happening
[3:01:06.340 --> 3:01:11.460]  the major move against humanity is now our greatest challenge in our entire development
[3:01:12.740 --> 3:01:19.620]  seated on this planet is now before us this is the great contest and i am so blessed to still be
[3:01:19.620 --> 3:01:27.300]  on air in the year 2021 on april 8 2021 on this thursday we were meant to be gone by now because
[3:01:27.300 --> 3:01:32.740]  the enemy said you can't have someone on air that knows our plans but so many now know the plans and
[3:01:32.740 --> 3:01:38.260]  so many can look into the plans and give us their perspective so you have lockstep and you have
[3:01:38.260 --> 3:01:43.300]  claus schwaab and you have the great reset and you have event 201 and you have crimson contagion
[3:01:43.300 --> 3:01:50.420]  and you have disease x and you have all the drills then there's spars 2025 2028 and so
[3:01:50.420 --> 3:01:55.780]  we came in on the weekend and we shot a report two hours long and i was going to introduce j
[3:01:55.780 --> 3:02:02.660]  dire just briefly but then i wanted to cover this because here's the headline put out by all the
[3:02:02.660 --> 3:02:11.780]  different leftist fact-checking media the the the the news guard run by bill gates himself the news
[3:02:11.780 --> 3:02:18.980]  today top search your doctor is bill gates he's the most powerful doctor on earth and it says fact
[3:02:18.980 --> 3:02:25.220]  check 2017 fictional spars pandemic scenario document is not proof of planned pandemic
[3:02:28.260 --> 3:02:36.740]  you just reverse that because with them it's a pentagram them it's upside down you just put
[3:02:36.740 --> 3:02:46.180]  it back the right way there it is for you in its face because everything they do is an inversion
[3:02:47.140 --> 3:02:54.340]  so they're telling you this is not a planned pandemic turn it back around it's the other way
[3:02:55.860 --> 3:03:01.860]  so another devastating victory um they will pay they've been ordered to do this they're carrying
[3:03:01.860 --> 3:03:07.860]  this out for their god it's going to be nasty but this is going to be separating the wheat from the
[3:03:07.860 --> 3:03:15.220]  chaff and so this is uh quite the moment and so we're going to talk about why bill gates is
[3:03:15.220 --> 3:03:20.740]  attacking this just like a month ago they said jones is lying india didn't ban the fizer shot
[3:03:20.740 --> 3:03:26.820]  jones is lying no one's banning astro zenica as it was banned everywhere this is their desperation
[3:03:26.820 --> 3:03:32.980]  as they lie and say oh the un didn't lie about wuhan the wheels are coming off so i can't wait
[3:03:33.540 --> 3:03:38.340]  in the next 55 minutes of live broadcast that's left in the shower ahead of the war with our
[3:03:38.340 --> 3:03:44.260]  destroyer for j dire or author research a great guy smarter than i have many ways to give his
[3:03:44.260 --> 3:03:50.020]  perspective on this document that everyone should report on and everyone should investigate and see
[3:03:50.020 --> 3:03:55.780]  for themselves so j take it over and tell us why they're so upset that we're looking at spars
[3:03:55.780 --> 3:04:00.420]  and why general flinn endorses our research of this and and and really why they would make a
[3:04:00.420 --> 3:04:06.580]  document admitting their plans j dire take it over thank you alex appreciate that yeah i want
[3:04:06.580 --> 3:04:10.980]  to thank you guys for putting out that excellent documentary i went through it three times i had
[3:04:10.980 --> 3:04:15.140]  to listen to it intently because i wanted to make sure i got all the information then
[3:04:15.780 --> 3:04:21.700]  kind of zoom out as i usually do to tie it into the other documents the other books that the
[3:04:21.700 --> 3:04:26.740]  global lead have been writing for decades now most famously of course we want to look at jonah
[3:04:26.740 --> 3:04:33.540]  salk's book because a lot of what's what's in uh the preparation for the danger the harm that's
[3:04:33.540 --> 3:04:39.220]  going to come that they anticipate the the inflammation the preon and all that it really
[3:04:39.220 --> 3:04:44.740]  meshes perfectly with what salk himself wrote decades ago in his book specifically survival
[3:04:44.740 --> 3:04:52.020]  of the wisest where he says things like uh why don't we just put a cancer virus in the vaccines and
[3:04:52.020 --> 3:04:58.260]  by doing that we'll actually promote evolutionary fitness the more that we kill off the more that
[3:04:58.260 --> 3:05:03.700]  we uh he says fall in love with death he actually says humans need to stop being pro-life and become
[3:05:03.700 --> 3:05:09.700]  pro-death so that the priests of science the high priests of science can step over the the boundaries
[3:05:09.700 --> 3:05:16.100]  of the creator right and take on that role of being the the common dots in the the the they
[3:05:16.100 --> 3:05:22.020]  want to steer evolution right so that's what salk talks about in his book openly he says very clearly
[3:05:22.020 --> 3:05:28.580]  that man is just a mutation he's a animal right and and the crazy part is that he says they want
[3:05:28.580 --> 3:05:34.020]  to mutate us into other types of things right so the mutation is a goal that they want to take us
[3:05:34.020 --> 3:05:39.380]  towards moving away from what it is to be man because in their philosophy there's no such thing
[3:05:39.380 --> 3:05:44.660]  as natures right man doesn't have a nature that makes him what he is it's just whatever you
[3:05:44.660 --> 3:05:48.980]  want to make it into right it's magical thinking you can just like in post-modernism just say
[3:05:48.980 --> 3:05:54.020]  something is what it is and it just magically becomes that oh i identify as bill cosby so
[3:05:54.020 --> 3:05:58.100]  therefore i am bill cosby you have to you have to treat me now like a bill cosby because i identify
[3:05:58.100 --> 3:06:03.700]  as them right that's how this mindset thinks but by the top elites the social controllers
[3:06:03.700 --> 3:06:07.460]  the social engineers they know that it's not really that way that's the that's the public
[3:06:07.460 --> 3:06:12.580]  perceptions uh you know sort of dumbed down idea that you know they just rely on these fact checkers
[3:06:12.580 --> 3:06:17.140]  they just they just default to this fallacy of authority right oh well he must uh he must
[3:06:17.140 --> 3:06:21.300]  know what he's talking about because he's uh he runs microsoft right he has he has these computers
[3:06:21.300 --> 3:06:25.860]  he must know what he's talking about right this this defaulting to authority when when we go and
[3:06:25.860 --> 3:06:30.740]  read the authorities we learn that they're malthusian okay so this whole book i mean the very title of
[3:06:30.740 --> 3:06:36.980]  the book itself tells you that the attitude is malthusian and so when we have the real context
[3:06:36.980 --> 3:06:41.300]  the real big picture from these guys i'm going to show you some other books that i haven't covered
[3:06:42.180 --> 3:06:48.020]  here on the oxygen show especially turning point by free tough copra some of these forgotten
[3:06:48.020 --> 3:06:53.460]  global elite texts they'll talk about how the medic the medical tyranny medicine is the real
[3:06:53.460 --> 3:07:00.180]  angle by which this global order needs to come into play but going back to salk salk says that
[3:07:00.180 --> 3:07:08.660]  um mankind is a cancer the species of mankind even though there is no species of mankind there is
[3:07:08.660 --> 3:07:13.140]  a species of mankind that needs to be stamped out just like birch and russell says there's no free
[3:07:13.140 --> 3:07:17.460]  will there's no spirit in man but we also have to stamp out free will and the spirit in man what
[3:07:17.460 --> 3:07:23.700]  i thought that didn't exist but uh so in chapter seven there's a there's a really amazing chapter
[3:07:23.700 --> 3:07:31.300]  where you have again this this man is lauded as the nobel laureate right for uh for inoculations
[3:07:31.300 --> 3:07:38.100]  right for oh he cured polio we're told at least but of course we know that when you give the
[3:07:38.100 --> 3:07:44.420]  nobel to people like obama right war criminals right this is a joke right that it's not it's a
[3:07:44.420 --> 3:07:48.980]  propaganda operation the nobel prize it's not actually a thing that's awarded to people that
[3:07:48.980 --> 3:07:54.980]  are really doing scientific breakthroughs unless you count the death cult scientific breakthroughs
[3:07:54.980 --> 3:08:01.300]  as a scientific breakthrough and in that regard i guess yes he is a powerful luminary of satan
[3:08:01.300 --> 3:08:06.500]  raised one of the great demons i guess you could say because he says in chapter seven that if we
[3:08:06.500 --> 3:08:15.860]  inject viruses into pregnant women we can experiment on the eggs of pregnant women and he says this
[3:08:15.860 --> 3:08:24.020]  is because man is again a a manimal right that can be mutated now this is going to sound crazy
[3:08:24.020 --> 3:08:30.100]  but i'm going to show you where claus says this in his book this is because they have the view that
[3:08:30.100 --> 3:08:35.940]  in in time what they're going to try to do is mutate man to no longer be man to get rid of man
[3:08:36.660 --> 3:08:41.860]  so they're going to reclassify through legal fiction i'm not kidding right man is no one
[3:08:41.860 --> 3:08:46.820]  are going to be classified as a quote human he's going to be he's actually called if you look up
[3:08:46.820 --> 3:08:50.980]  i looked many years ago i didn't believe this when i heard that look up the cornell law code about
[3:08:50.980 --> 3:08:57.300]  how man is defined man and other animals okay then this fits in with un legal redefinitions
[3:08:57.300 --> 3:09:02.580]  of what man is human resources were actually a resource just like anything else like cattle
[3:09:02.580 --> 3:09:08.340]  right so when you redefine what a human is in legal categories this gives the precedent for
[3:09:08.340 --> 3:09:16.340]  or ways to experiment and to to change what that animal is just like testing on lab rats just like
[3:09:16.340 --> 3:09:20.420]  testing on anything else right there's a famous book written by i think she's from harvard rebecca
[3:09:20.420 --> 3:09:26.900]  lemo she has a book called world as laboratory and she talks about this scientism attitude that
[3:09:26.900 --> 3:09:33.060]  sees the world like a test tube that sees it as a science experiment and that's what we're dealing
[3:09:33.060 --> 3:09:38.820]  with here people that are trying to do this very thing the listening to the alice jones show and
[3:09:42.820 --> 3:09:48.180]  come back we're going to get into more of jones salt as far as document epic is one of only a
[3:09:48.180 --> 3:09:55.540]  handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association and they know
[3:09:55.540 --> 3:10:00.980]  that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship
[3:10:00.980 --> 3:10:05.780]  and organized crime racketeering that's why they've been massively expanding their services
[3:10:05.780 --> 3:10:09.940]  so whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want
[3:10:09.940 --> 3:10:15.380]  servers or any other major service they've got it all and they're expanding and if you go to info
[3:10:15.380 --> 3:10:21.380]  wars domains dot com and follow that link you get all their services at the lowest price
[3:10:21.380 --> 3:10:27.220]  and 25 percent of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war
[3:10:27.220 --> 3:10:32.100]  and we get five percent as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from
[3:10:32.100 --> 3:10:37.060]  them so it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists are
[3:10:37.060 --> 3:10:43.620]  destroying what was open and what was free so info wars domains dot com the revolution starts there
[3:10:43.620 --> 3:10:51.220]  info wars domains dot com take action now the equation is very simple the mega banks control
[3:10:51.220 --> 3:10:58.260]  the media they control big pharma they control academia they control the military industrial
[3:10:58.260 --> 3:11:04.340]  complex they control big tech and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world
[3:11:04.340 --> 3:11:12.180]  they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it is the western christian idea
[3:11:12.180 --> 3:11:17.060]  of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that
[3:11:17.060 --> 3:11:23.540]  actually threatens them so because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted
[3:11:23.540 --> 3:11:31.140]  turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free
[3:11:31.140 --> 3:11:36.180]  market that threatens their monopoly so control that's why they target info wars because we
[3:11:36.180 --> 3:11:41.940]  understand the keys to the feeding of the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote
[3:11:41.940 --> 3:11:50.100]  info wars and bad that video so we double your efforts we're all on this together you're listening
[3:11:50.100 --> 3:12:06.020]  to the alex jones show
[3:12:12.020 --> 3:12:16.900]  and welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your guest host jdyer jason aulsons dot com
[3:12:16.900 --> 3:12:22.980]  be sure to follow me on my website there as well as my social media is just under my name jdyer now
[3:12:23.540 --> 3:12:29.140]  the point that salk goes on to make in the book that i wanted you to be aware of is that
[3:12:29.140 --> 3:12:35.620]  salk is very adamant that there's nothing bad about disease or death or decay since they're
[3:12:35.620 --> 3:12:41.860]  part of the natural process the scientific elite must commandeer it and then use that to the advantage
[3:12:41.860 --> 3:12:47.460]  so-called of the species right so in other words imagine using death disease decay i don't know
[3:12:47.460 --> 3:12:53.540]  if you saw the last mission impossible installment but if you notice that was the attitude that was
[3:12:53.540 --> 3:12:59.220]  the mindset of the villain right remember the villain was like an ecocide maniac who thought that
[3:12:59.220 --> 3:13:04.500]  the population was going to destroy the planet because of his malthusian ideas and so of course
[3:13:04.500 --> 3:13:09.780]  you know tom cruise had to save everybody from him setting off nukes and depopulating but that's
[3:13:09.780 --> 3:13:15.940]  not too far from reality because salk says that the real scientific elite are going to
[3:13:15.940 --> 3:13:20.900]  have to make these tough decisions about who lives and who dies and the easiest way to get this done
[3:13:20.900 --> 3:13:26.580]  is through a mass vaccination program that's exactly what this book is about and in fact
[3:13:26.580 --> 3:13:30.900]  that's not the only book that the doctor salk wrote he wrote a whole other book outlining the
[3:13:30.900 --> 3:13:36.980]  exact same thing called man unfolding where again man is just a just a random mutation process and
[3:13:36.980 --> 3:13:42.260]  if a man is just a man in the mutation process there's nothing wrong with getting rid of most of
[3:13:42.260 --> 3:13:48.900]  man and he says well then who will survive who will live on me he says literally he says the
[3:13:48.900 --> 3:13:54.340]  scientific elite which by that he means himself and his cronies and everybody else will be
[3:13:54.340 --> 3:13:59.380]  extinguished and besides he says the number one enemy by the way he says on page 73 is the
[3:13:59.380 --> 3:14:06.420]  traditionalist right so pages 71 72 73 and by that he means anybody who doesn't have a complete
[3:14:06.420 --> 3:14:12.980]  scientism type of worldview right if you don't accept total atheistic luciferian scientism
[3:14:13.860 --> 3:14:21.460]  if you don't join their club you have to die because you are the problem right for evolution
[3:14:21.460 --> 3:14:28.260]  you're in the way of the species evolving to godhood and he has that attitude he has the
[3:14:28.260 --> 3:14:32.900]  belief that they're going to evolve to godhood now if that sounds crazy bear with me because
[3:14:32.900 --> 3:14:38.660]  i'm going to show you where claus himself says this in his book he says that the the new definitions
[3:14:38.660 --> 3:14:45.380]  of what species are right when we inject the mutations into the species when we develop new
[3:14:45.380 --> 3:14:52.180]  species right then we're going to have the ability to reclassify everyone and everything
[3:14:52.180 --> 3:14:56.500]  right in these legal fictions to where everything that they want to do in terms of the establishment
[3:14:56.500 --> 3:15:02.260]  perspective overriding the renaissance overriding the biblical common law overriding natural law
[3:15:02.260 --> 3:15:08.100]  right overriding the constitution any of these classical documents of the last thousand two
[3:15:08.100 --> 3:15:12.180]  thousand years that kind of enshrine the ten commandments right then enshrine what it is
[3:15:12.180 --> 3:15:16.980]  to have human rights moral law natural law etc all of those things have to go away
[3:15:18.260 --> 3:15:23.220]  so that it can be rewritten now by a new covenant that claus wobb talks about a new
[3:15:23.220 --> 3:15:31.620]  technocratic covenant decided and determined by the un davos will economic forum bill berg etc
[3:15:31.620 --> 3:15:35.940]  so now that we have that in mind about the attitude of one of the top scientific elite of
[3:15:35.940 --> 3:15:40.900]  the last several decades just one okay remember the us government has a giant institute called the
[3:15:40.900 --> 3:15:46.900]  salk initiative right where they do mind brain interface why does the salk brain initiative
[3:15:46.900 --> 3:15:52.740]  do mind excuse me mind computer brain computer interface well when you reach wobb you're going
[3:15:52.740 --> 3:15:58.740]  to understand why that is but i want to remind you also of another guy his name is fritof capra
[3:15:58.740 --> 3:16:03.380]  right and he talks like a higher-pitched arnold schwarzenegger he sounds like he's arnold schwarzenegger
[3:16:03.380 --> 3:16:13.540]  uh sucking helium now fritof has a a take that was overlooked that a few researchers did catch a
[3:16:13.540 --> 3:16:19.220]  pickup on one of one of those is known as the doctor day tapes i'll talk about those in a minute but
[3:16:19.940 --> 3:16:23.780]  one of the things that copper talked about was that he says we're going to have to follow
[3:16:23.780 --> 3:16:30.180]  the ideas of arthur kessler all right and a previous global elitist of the same mindset as
[3:16:30.180 --> 3:16:35.060]  all these characters he says copper says we're going to have to adopt the idea that medicine
[3:16:35.060 --> 3:16:42.580]  is the key backdoor to bring in this new order in fact that's a huge portion of this big fat
[3:16:42.580 --> 3:16:48.180]  boring book is that medicine will be the key it's medicine medicine medicine don't everybody
[3:16:48.180 --> 3:16:53.060]  thinks oh it's going to be the government smashing my face a boot on my there will be an element of
[3:16:53.060 --> 3:16:59.540]  that but the real backdoor the real way that this new system is going to come in according to um
[3:17:01.060 --> 3:17:08.580]  to fritof for i was always want to come fritos according to cheeto capra uh is according to
[3:17:08.580 --> 3:17:13.700]  jonas talk according to the day tapes right is going to be through medicine and when you get into
[3:17:14.980 --> 3:17:21.060]  what fritof for example thinks is going to be key to this i'm not kidding he actually references
[3:17:21.060 --> 3:17:26.740]  mceltra now why do you think why would mceltra be relevant to this whole thing well a lot of people
[3:17:26.740 --> 3:17:30.580]  don't know that when you look at figures like gregory baits and people who were involved in the
[3:17:30.580 --> 3:17:35.860]  mceltra program cia connected guys gordon was and a lot of these characters were studying
[3:17:35.860 --> 3:17:42.660]  entheogens studying hallucinogens studying pharmaceuticals and thus lsd is developed out
[3:17:42.660 --> 3:17:51.540]  of the pharmaceutical right uh milieu and so what what frito says is that we're going to have to
[3:17:52.260 --> 3:17:59.940]  take the research that mceltra has done which by the way became mk search and it was uh uh
[3:17:59.940 --> 3:18:06.580]  moved to port detrick it became a bio warfare program and it moved into electronic research
[3:18:06.580 --> 3:18:15.620]  including elf vlf microchips brain implants etc as well as nanotech so darpa right is really the
[3:18:15.620 --> 3:18:20.900]  long term end result in terms of the super soldiers and all this kind of stuff that is all
[3:18:20.900 --> 3:18:27.940]  about this it's about mutating man and it's about a biological rewrite okay they want to do a synthetic
[3:18:27.940 --> 3:18:34.580]  rewrite of all reality and now i know that sounds kind of far-fetched like what i mean come on but
[3:18:34.580 --> 3:18:39.700]  when i read when i read claus and i went i listened to uh some of the other videos that are on
[3:18:39.700 --> 3:18:46.580]  info wars that discuss this i went back and i looked at salt i looked at what fritoff uh and
[3:18:46.580 --> 3:18:52.100]  arthur kessler say that is what they say and it's just kind of in hiding in plain sight they're saying
[3:18:52.100 --> 3:18:58.660]  that through the nanotech through the modifications that were done over the decades of experiments
[3:18:58.660 --> 3:19:03.620]  right so all these all that mceltra research all that mk search research bluebird monarch
[3:19:03.620 --> 3:19:08.820]  it wasn't just about sex slaves and mind control assassins that was an element but this is dozens
[3:19:08.820 --> 3:19:16.500]  of projects that eventually leads to uh cybernetics right norbert weiner cybernetics that's all part of
[3:19:16.500 --> 3:19:22.580]  mceltra that's the end result of it and what they wanted to do was figure out ways to not
[3:19:22.580 --> 3:19:30.100]  just mutate man and redefine what man is but to end man it's to end man they all say this
[3:19:30.100 --> 3:19:35.700]  this is not a conspiracy theory right i've covered 50 plus writings of the global elite they all say
[3:19:35.700 --> 3:19:43.140]  we have to end man and we're going to do that as russell said 100 years ago their diet injections
[3:19:43.140 --> 3:19:51.380]  injunctions and all of these scientific projects so fritoff says that uh when the pharmaceutical
[3:19:51.380 --> 3:19:56.900]  big pharma industry right gets sufficiently advanced to the point that they can basically
[3:19:56.900 --> 3:20:03.300]  change humanity we will be able to evolve to this next stage right the next type of civilization
[3:20:03.300 --> 3:20:07.620]  i think they call it like a type three four civilization right then this is what salk has
[3:20:07.620 --> 3:20:12.980]  talked i mean um swab is talking about with the fourth industrial revolution is the next phase
[3:20:12.980 --> 3:20:19.700]  out of the old way of living right hunter gatherer societies industrial revolution now it's the tech
[3:20:19.700 --> 3:20:26.740]  revolution and it's only going to be for a select small number of elite who will then move to being
[3:20:26.740 --> 3:20:35.140]  post human everyone else will die that's the plan that's what they say in all the books all their
[3:20:35.140 --> 3:20:39.780]  books all of them the ones that talk about this right not every book that they write talks about
[3:20:39.780 --> 3:20:46.500]  this stuff but all the books that talk about this relate to transcending and ending man you know
[3:20:46.500 --> 3:20:52.660]  listeners calling to the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because i sit there
[3:20:52.660 --> 3:20:58.740]  and i beg you for support constantly for prayer for financial support and for word of mouth and
[3:20:58.740 --> 3:21:03.060]  then we're all this together and i you know it gets old having to come to you and say hey i've got
[3:21:03.060 --> 3:21:06.980]  great products please buy them or we won't be here on air but it's true for the only media
[3:21:06.980 --> 3:21:11.300]  organization in the united states that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to
[3:21:11.300 --> 3:21:15.380]  the big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else they crippled
[3:21:15.380 --> 3:21:20.100]  all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out in the open
[3:21:20.100 --> 3:21:24.660]  and our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken off air that's why america
[3:21:24.660 --> 3:21:28.820]  has got to be taken down you can't have all these other nations enslaved and america still
[3:21:28.820 --> 3:21:33.940]  quasi-free you can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness
[3:21:33.940 --> 3:21:38.820]  that's about to unfold because if you think stuff's bad now just get ready so thank you all and get

[3:22:40.100 --> 3:22:52.500]  warstore.com humanity has been domesticated by and large the population has been trained to submit
[3:22:52.500 --> 3:22:57.780]  do what you're told that's all going to pass but if you study authoritarians if you study the globalist
[3:22:57.780 --> 3:23:02.180]  you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point
[3:23:02.180 --> 3:23:07.060]  of being cold being totally enslaved and because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid
[3:23:07.060 --> 3:23:11.220]  they are now making that move and they are collapsing the third world with their economic
[3:23:11.220 --> 3:23:17.300]  weapons to then flood us with the third world that the un will use as a weapon to then have us
[3:23:17.300 --> 3:23:22.980]  under such a crises under such a load capitulate to the un whatever agreements they want us to sign
[3:23:22.980 --> 3:23:29.220]  hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing covid or climate
[3:23:29.220 --> 3:23:34.740]  change as the un and claus Schwab were saying and bill gates are saying but fleeing the year-long
[3:23:34.740 --> 3:23:40.660]  lockdowns that the un and bill gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more
[3:23:40.660 --> 3:23:46.500]  imf and world bank money and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist
[3:23:46.500 --> 3:23:51.540]  you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very bittersweet everything we've talked about
[3:23:51.540 --> 3:23:55.540]  has happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of credibility but i don't care about
[3:23:55.540 --> 3:23:59.700]  that i care about beating the new world order and it's because we have so much credibility
[3:23:59.700 --> 3:24:04.100]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer and i don't have time to tell you all the stuff
[3:24:04.100 --> 3:24:08.580]  they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't tell you what's going on but let's just say this
[3:24:08.580 --> 3:24:13.460]  we're going to see this through the end we're going to stay on air as long as we can so please
[3:24:13.460 --> 3:24:17.620]  pray for us and please buy the products and then forward store dot com they're great products

[3:24:26.500 --> 3:24:31.700]  and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth that's why the globalist
[3:24:31.700 --> 3:24:35.860]  are censoring they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air
[3:24:35.860 --> 3:24:40.020]  so while you're at it don't just financially support us and spread the word download everything
[3:24:40.020 --> 3:24:43.940]  we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[3:24:43.940 --> 3:24:46.260]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[3:24:46.260 --> 3:24:52.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:24:52.900 --> 3:25:03.540]  so
[3:25:10.100 --> 3:25:13.540]  welcome back to the alcoons
[3:25:14.980 --> 3:25:20.180]  i want to remind you if you're interested in this material uh but maybe you think it's a little too
[3:25:20.180 --> 3:25:28.260]  technical a little too jargon heavy well i wrote two books that use movies to make this accessible
[3:25:28.260 --> 3:25:32.260]  to your friends and family members so if you do have friends and family that read get my books
[3:25:32.260 --> 3:25:37.380]  desolate hollywood one and two at website jason also dot com in the shop everybody gets signed
[3:25:37.380 --> 3:25:42.180]  copies when you get it from my website don't get it from old bezos over there because he
[3:25:42.180 --> 3:25:49.060]  takes all the money now i did mention that we're gonna do a kind of an overview of the spars
[3:25:49.060 --> 3:25:55.300]  video that alex put together with his crew that's excellent it's a must-see and i'm going to do a
[3:25:55.300 --> 3:26:00.740]  quick run through but one last document one last piece of information that's a great attestation
[3:26:00.740 --> 3:26:05.220]  to the veracity of what i'm saying is the document or it's actually a series of tapes and lectures
[3:26:05.220 --> 3:26:13.220]  called the day tapes and dr richard day was an attendee of a conference back in 1968 69 under
[3:26:13.220 --> 3:26:18.820]  the auspices of the national population council on the rockefeller foundation and there was another
[3:26:18.820 --> 3:26:23.380]  that so there was a doctor who was presenting here and this was about the top doctors in the
[3:26:23.380 --> 3:26:28.980]  country back at that time coming together to figure out under planned parenthood how to
[3:26:28.980 --> 3:26:34.580]  implement this overall plan now it's just one of the many instances of the types of things the
[3:26:34.580 --> 3:26:40.100]  types of documents the types of white papers the types of high-level policy ngo think tank plans
[3:26:40.100 --> 3:26:44.180]  that are out there and a lot of people thought well maybe this guy is not really telling us the
[3:26:44.180 --> 3:26:50.260]  truth but it's a it's the doctor who was president actually went to the at that time the pro life
[3:26:50.260 --> 3:26:56.340]  league which is a catholic organization back i think in the late early late 80s early 90s and he
[3:26:56.340 --> 3:27:02.020]  leaked this whole conference okay that was again from this these late the late 60s and he said
[3:27:02.020 --> 3:27:07.620]  there's a long-term plan over many decades to institute not just the world government all the
[3:27:07.620 --> 3:27:12.260]  kind of you know normal things that we've heard about but he said that it's gonna it's gonna be
[3:27:12.260 --> 3:27:17.540]  to the point where they're going to have mandatory vaccinations they're gonna have mandatory micro
[3:27:17.540 --> 3:27:22.900]  chipping they're gonna do it through new ways that like he said you know aren't even sufficiently
[3:27:22.900 --> 3:27:27.620]  advanced in terms of technology at that time he said there will be total societal societal breakdown
[3:27:27.620 --> 3:27:32.500]  there'll be all these different things that we've seen such as the gender issues that the chemicals
[3:27:32.500 --> 3:27:38.980]  in the food and the water that actually changed uh yeah exactly RNA mRNA and all that and so the
[3:27:38.980 --> 3:27:44.500]  idea that this is not feasible or not plausible or not there's no evidence for this this was going on
[3:27:44.500 --> 3:27:49.380]  at the same time as another conference called the mind control conference it was sponsored by the
[3:27:49.380 --> 3:27:55.780]  cia one of the famous doctors present at that conference was called dr holger heiden now you
[3:27:55.780 --> 3:28:00.740]  probably haven't heard of these guys because they're just they're just high level social engineered
[3:28:00.740 --> 3:28:05.300]  doctors that are not famous they're not out there in the public view but if you do some research
[3:28:05.300 --> 3:28:10.980]  you will find these people right for example uh i didn't expect it but dr holger heiden comes up in
[3:28:10.980 --> 3:28:16.420]  arthur kesler's book ghost in the machine and he comes up because the idea that dr holger heiden
[3:28:16.420 --> 3:28:23.940]  had was we can use we can change mRNA to literally reverse the types of human beings that we get we
[3:28:23.940 --> 3:28:30.020]  can make men more feminine we can make women more masculine and if we do this convergence and move
[3:28:30.020 --> 3:28:35.060]  both the the male and the female into this kind of convergence towards each other he says we'll
[3:28:35.060 --> 3:28:40.820]  present we'll get the new male right like if you've seen the meme right this the soyboy means
[3:28:40.820 --> 3:28:46.260]  we'll get the new male we'll get the new human and i know that sounds silly that sounds like
[3:28:46.260 --> 3:28:51.700]  but it's not a joke it's actually real okay the the mutation of the species is actually real
[3:28:52.580 --> 3:28:56.900]  and that kind of stuff comes up in these talks i highly recommend if anybody hasn't heard the
[3:28:56.900 --> 3:29:03.220]  dr day tapes to go listen to them exactly and it matches perfectly with what you find and
[3:29:03.220 --> 3:29:07.540]  saw with what we find in these other guys so let's do a quick rundown this was so important
[3:29:07.540 --> 3:29:12.580]  because this is in a long line of documents of drills and exercises if you don't know drills
[3:29:12.580 --> 3:29:16.580]  and exercises are always the cover think back to 9 11 what do we have we have vigilant guardian
[3:29:16.580 --> 3:29:21.540]  right we had all these drills going on at the same time as the events that were the the events of 9
[3:29:21.540 --> 3:29:29.140]  11 what a coincidence right 7 7 the exact same thing happens at the london 7 7 bombing right
[3:29:29.140 --> 3:29:33.380]  the fizer consultant says well one of the chances that we have drills going on are the very events
[3:29:33.380 --> 3:29:38.260]  that happen the drills with the cover right this is a basic black ops military strategy to
[3:29:38.820 --> 3:29:43.300]  have plausible deniability in case the drill gets busted the operation so we're just running a drill
[3:29:43.300 --> 3:29:48.980]  right so in this document what we have this is sponsored by world economic forum bill gates and
[3:29:48.980 --> 3:29:54.580]  johns hawkins okay so if you go and read the document 70 75 pages right i got i got through
[3:29:54.580 --> 3:30:02.580]  this the other night we have really the playing out right from what the document says is 2025 to
[3:30:02.580 --> 3:30:08.820]  2028 what's happening now right it matches perfectly almost perfectly with 2020 to 2023
[3:30:09.460 --> 3:30:14.740]  and it's in a long line of those documents like event 201 or exercises like lockstep like crimson
[3:30:14.740 --> 3:30:23.940]  contagion like glade clade x or disease x un connected drills and it even has to the point
[3:30:23.940 --> 3:30:29.460]  where there's a male female partnership vice presidency going on it has six months to one
[3:30:29.460 --> 3:30:34.500]  year after the mass inoculations there starts to be these problems right you get the brain
[3:30:34.500 --> 3:30:41.940]  inflammation the prion disease and this leads to a lot of public reaction outcry anger okay and
[3:30:41.940 --> 3:30:46.100]  we're remember we just hit the point supposedly according to Reuters where there's been a hundred
[3:30:46.100 --> 3:30:51.060]  million people back saying okay so that's where we are right now and in this so from now to six
[3:30:51.060 --> 3:30:56.660]  months to a year is when this document if it tracks projects when there will be this sort of mass
[3:30:56.660 --> 3:31:03.300]  outcry and it's not going to be the NGO think tank funding level people okay the top the social
[3:31:03.300 --> 3:31:07.940]  engineer level that takes the fall that takes the blame it's going to be the lower level government
[3:31:07.940 --> 3:31:14.180]  and cdc level people that get the blame right and it's always said though government is kind of the
[3:31:14.180 --> 3:31:20.420]  shield of like goober's right that take the blame for what the real shadow government is up to and
[3:31:20.420 --> 3:31:24.660]  what they're doing and people who really they're gonna you couldn't have these kinds of things
[3:31:24.660 --> 3:31:28.980]  going on because like the government is incompetent yeah the government doesn't run things the people
[3:31:28.980 --> 3:31:33.140]  above the government at the think tanks the NGOs that's who really runs things and they're not
[3:31:33.140 --> 3:31:38.900]  incompetent right they're people with 200 IQs they build the nano tech right they build the the
[3:31:38.900 --> 3:31:45.220]  bombs that you know the smart tech okay they're not dumb the government level people are just
[3:31:45.220 --> 3:31:50.260]  a bunch of stooches and are groovers and are dumb in many cases they don't know anything so uh the
[3:31:50.260 --> 3:31:54.740]  health officials are set to take the fall in the document remember this came out in 2017 and it's
[3:31:54.740 --> 3:32:02.020]  predicting what will be the case it even lists the names of this stupid thing this this cold virus
[3:32:02.020 --> 3:32:08.580]  basically right it calls it what spars instead of SARS right SARS COVID never we've had a bunch of
[3:32:08.580 --> 3:32:16.100]  different pr names for this uh engineered thing this uh GMO cold virus that we have
[3:32:16.100 --> 3:32:23.060]  SARS COVID-2 in the document and this also lines up with IMF 2018 2019 documents are called the
[3:32:23.060 --> 3:32:29.380]  spars COVID SARS COVID right the percentage of the numbers right the public percentage of the
[3:32:29.380 --> 3:32:35.380]  number six percent right is even in the document including the hashtags including the stupid
[3:32:35.380 --> 3:32:41.140]  rap songs by the rock washed up rappers right run DMC remember I mean my buddy Tristan shout out to
[3:32:41.140 --> 3:32:46.740]  perembleh health he covered this whole thing with this total ridiculous social engineering selling
[3:32:46.740 --> 3:32:53.620]  point using the hashtags that are in this document of take the vaccine run DMC take the vaccine it's
[3:32:53.620 --> 3:33:02.100]  not Tuskegee take the vaccine right just nonsense they even expected anti-vaccine groups to refer
[3:33:02.100 --> 3:33:08.340]  to things like Tuskegee all right that's how far forward thinking these kinds of war game documents
[3:33:08.340 --> 3:33:13.780]  are right and when they reply when they say that this is a conspiracy it's just they just gaslight
[3:33:13.780 --> 3:33:19.620]  right basic gaslighting basic psychological warfare techniques of deny always deny always
[3:33:19.620 --> 3:33:25.620]  deny just lie in the people's face that's a better tactic than trying to do a reasoned logical so
[3:33:25.620 --> 3:33:31.220]  called refutation or response right that's a basic psychological warfare manipulation tactic
[3:33:31.220 --> 3:33:36.180]  narcissists do this right there's a million videos on youtube of narcissists narcissists
[3:33:36.180 --> 3:33:41.780]  everybody's talking about narcissistic psychopaths right yeah there's run DMC with their their their
[3:33:41.780 --> 3:33:49.620]  vaccine promo now amazingly again the document predicts mass anger outrage over all of the
[3:33:49.620 --> 3:33:57.060]  bad effects from this experimental mRNA mutation machine it's like a machine that they're putting
[3:33:57.060 --> 3:34:02.660]  in it's like a it's like a little time bomb machine according to what it's according to the
[3:34:02.660 --> 3:34:08.820]  mRNA and again you say that's crazy that's great doesn't exist plows talks about this he talks about
[3:34:09.620 --> 3:34:16.340]  nanotech types of vaccines i made a joke video like 10 years ago where i was impersonating alex
[3:34:17.060 --> 3:34:21.220]  and oh folks are gonna put nanotech in the food it's gonna be in the vaccines they're gonna put
[3:34:21.220 --> 3:34:27.140]  little robots in so i was joking they really did it i didn't even think that was real i did i did a
[3:34:27.140 --> 3:34:33.860]  joke video 10 years ago making fun i mean in good faith just out of fun impersonation is the right
[3:34:34.660 --> 3:34:39.940]  best form of flattery and it's real i mean that blows my mind right and claus will tell you this
[3:34:39.940 --> 3:34:52.980]  because yes we're gonna use mRNA in as men age they often experience a slowdown in vitality energy

[3:36:46.820 --> 3:36:52.260]  i've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there about looking at the
[3:36:52.260 --> 3:36:56.580]  world from the perspective of the globalist that the public's so dumbed down that they don't care
[3:36:56.580 --> 3:37:00.660]  that we're stealing their future from them that we're poisoning them that we're sterilizing them
[3:37:00.660 --> 3:37:05.860]  that they deserve to be killed yes that's the position of the globalists they play god and
[3:37:05.860 --> 3:37:11.300]  they think because we don't stand up they have a right to do this to us you know i've told you
[3:37:11.940 --> 3:37:16.100]  that the globals have tried to hire me they try to get you to join them but metaphysically at a
[3:37:16.100 --> 3:37:21.940]  spiritual level i have the holy spirit i'm connection with gods and i know that god is not
[3:37:21.940 --> 3:37:27.940]  like that so i cannot join the enemy but i'll tell you at a selfish level i get very very mad
[3:37:27.940 --> 3:37:31.780]  at people that go along with the system believing you're part of it or believing you're getting
[3:37:31.780 --> 3:37:37.300]  power on them whether you're just a steelworker or a school teacher or a kenry christensher
[3:37:37.300 --> 3:37:43.380]  you're not god and treating other people like they're animals and you're god is something that
[3:37:43.380 --> 3:37:50.180]  the real god of the universe doesn't like and that's a fact epic is one of only a handful of domain
[3:37:50.180 --> 3:37:56.820]  registers that promote free speech and freedom of association and they know that big tech is
[3:37:56.820 --> 3:38:01.780]  buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized
[3:38:01.780 --> 3:38:06.820]  crime racketeering that's why they've been massively expanding their services so whether you have
[3:38:06.820 --> 3:38:11.300]  domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other
[3:38:11.300 --> 3:38:16.660]  major service they've got it all and they're expanding and if you go to info wars domains
[3:38:16.660 --> 3:38:23.060]  dot com and follow that link you get all their services at the lowest price and 25 percent of
[3:38:23.060 --> 3:38:28.500]  your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war and then we get five percent
[3:38:28.500 --> 3:38:33.940]  as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them so it's a win-win as we
[3:38:33.940 --> 3:38:38.740]  build a true open free internet again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what
[3:38:38.740 --> 3:38:46.580]  was free so info wars domains dot com the revolution starts there info wars domains dot com take action now
[3:38:46.580 --> 3:38:52.340]  now you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:39:08.500 --> 3:39:13.380]  welcome back to the outside on your guest post j dire disney also dot com be sure to follow me
[3:39:13.380 --> 3:39:19.300]  on all my outlets and we give a shout out also to rockfin which is an excellent free speech based
[3:39:19.300 --> 3:39:25.300]  platform that has myself sam trippley jason bermas whitney web richard grove many other
[3:39:26.100 --> 3:39:32.100]  analysts and researchers out there a shout out to rockfin for being a platform that wants to go
[3:39:32.100 --> 3:39:37.300]  forth promoting free speech as well as of course band up video as well as info wars be sure and
[3:39:37.300 --> 3:39:42.820]  support us support all the people that are doing the real research and real work here in alternative
[3:39:42.820 --> 3:39:49.940]  media um i wanted to go back to this document a few more points on the spars document if you want
[3:39:49.940 --> 3:39:56.580]  a better uh a modern example right of this mouth using idea remember that this comes in the context
[3:39:56.580 --> 3:40:03.460]  of the elite meeting a few years ago at the good club right this was oprah right it was bill gates
[3:40:03.460 --> 3:40:08.340]  it was at that time did rockabeller ted turner the elites getting together to talk about and discuss
[3:40:08.340 --> 3:40:14.100]  us the ways to implement the global mass and population operations so we know that that's
[3:40:14.100 --> 3:40:20.180]  their agenda we know that that's what they want to do we know that they work endlessly right
[3:40:20.180 --> 3:40:27.300]  to do this to achieve this excuse me now in the case of uh old gill baits one thing that he's
[3:40:27.300 --> 3:40:32.980]  talked about is the geoengineering programs right we know that he's heavily involved in that a lot
[3:40:32.980 --> 3:40:38.180]  of that we don't exactly know what the whole plan is why exactly that they say things are
[3:40:38.180 --> 3:40:42.180]  oh we got to clear combat climate change we got to block out the sun right and i'm sure that that's
[3:40:42.180 --> 3:40:47.140]  to a degree true and there's other uh documentaries other works that have been put out that kind of
[3:40:47.140 --> 3:40:53.540]  tie it into well they need to spray to help make you know cell phones signals uh clearer right if
[3:40:53.540 --> 3:40:58.420]  there's if there's metals in the atmosphere the cell phones will work better and they which are
[3:40:58.420 --> 3:41:03.060]  again odd kind of justifications for this attitude and there have been a lot of uh
[3:41:03.060 --> 3:41:07.700]  theorizing about whether there could be a nanotech connection to the spraying and all that again
[3:41:07.700 --> 3:41:13.140]  i don't have uh proof that necessarily the geoengineering at this point is directly connected
[3:41:13.140 --> 3:41:19.380]  to nanotech but i do know that claus and the elite write about the possibility of this so if
[3:41:19.380 --> 3:41:22.820]  they're writing about the possibility of it there's there's a good chance that they're
[3:41:22.820 --> 3:41:28.980]  probably already doing it perhaps um in claus's book if you remember right fourth industrial
[3:41:28.980 --> 3:41:34.340]  revolution in this in the in the last half of the book right which is where he gets really heavy
[3:41:34.340 --> 3:41:39.940]  really crazy is where he talks about how ai will eventually kind of take over everything
[3:41:39.940 --> 3:41:45.140]  and one thing that's got to happen is that all of reality has got to be tagged it's got to be tracked
[3:41:45.140 --> 3:41:51.220]  right every object that exists in the world needs to have some kind of way to be relayed and tracked
[3:41:51.860 --> 3:41:56.500]  now this gets into in in my view what they call the simulant world system right where they have
[3:41:56.500 --> 3:42:02.900]  kind of supercomputers that have a kind of live real-time model of what's going on right in the
[3:42:02.900 --> 3:42:07.060]  real world now whether they have actually achieved that or whether that's the plan is up for debate
[3:42:07.060 --> 3:42:11.940]  i think that's definitely the plan whether they actually have that is uh you know is is anyone's
[3:42:11.940 --> 3:42:18.260]  guess but so the plan is to use smart dust right which is a form of nanotech right which can
[3:42:18.260 --> 3:42:25.380]  wirelessly transmit and kind of give a give a relay right back to the supercomputers via the
[3:42:25.380 --> 3:42:33.460]  space-based satellites via wi-fi via 5g 6g right six generation wireless tech that's what
[3:42:33.460 --> 3:42:38.420]  claus talks about he says that we're going to need the 5 and 6g in place to be able to have
[3:42:38.420 --> 3:42:43.780]  the internet of things literally link and track everything and he says the only way to do this
[3:42:43.780 --> 3:42:49.700]  is presumably through smart dust right and it's not just smart dust he says that we're also going
[3:42:49.700 --> 3:42:59.140]  to have to have as much as possible self-organizing and self-repairing ai tech that's out there in
[3:42:59.140 --> 3:43:05.060]  the world and able to do and able to reproduce itself for example through 3d printing right so
[3:43:05.060 --> 3:43:11.140]  perhaps the the robots of the future will be able to self-replicate through in working the robots
[3:43:11.140 --> 3:43:17.620]  working on robots right and engineering uh more robots right to go out and do these kinds of self
[3:43:17.620 --> 3:43:23.700]  repair operations and he says that it'll be robotic from all levels right to the macro scale down to
[3:43:23.700 --> 3:43:31.380]  the micro scale and what the idea is that eventually this can replace right the existing
[3:43:31.380 --> 3:43:36.020]  failed biological world so the real enemy here if you wonder why they're always talking about
[3:43:36.020 --> 3:43:42.500]  carbon and why is carbon credit carbon is the basis of life and the enemy in this scheme in
[3:43:42.500 --> 3:43:49.700]  this malthusian scheme is carbon based life forms that need to give way to synthetic based life
[3:43:49.700 --> 3:43:57.620]  forms and again because the modus operandi of this worldview is evolution right in a in a strict
[3:43:57.620 --> 3:44:01.940]  luciferian sense right i'm not talking about adaptation we all believe that the species
[3:44:01.940 --> 3:44:06.820]  evolve to adapt to their environment but i'm talking about the idea that you can evolve into
[3:44:06.820 --> 3:44:12.420]  some other totally different being okay a totally different type of thing in order to get to that
[3:44:12.420 --> 3:44:19.300]  that requires the cyborg right the mutation phases right to move out of being human into
[3:44:19.860 --> 3:44:27.540]  modify humans to cyborgs androids right then into the post human so silicon based life forms
[3:44:27.540 --> 3:44:33.060]  nanotech based mutations right again i i thought this was crazy when i heard this i was like no
[3:44:33.060 --> 3:44:38.580]  i'm surely that's just it sounds like a science fiction story it is a science fiction story right
[3:44:38.580 --> 3:44:42.900]  but they believe it okay and that's what claus says in the second half of this book is that we're
[3:44:42.900 --> 3:44:48.420]  going to have to have logical reclassifications of what life forms are so that we can have nanotech
[3:44:48.420 --> 3:44:54.740]  synthetic organisms now classed as life forms this will allow us to prepare the way legally for
[3:44:55.540 --> 3:45:02.900]  the new system that comes into play the new system is a rewrite of all of of nature in the world
[3:45:02.900 --> 3:45:10.100]  called and biological systems to be more logical more rational mecha systems you see
[3:45:10.740 --> 3:45:15.220]  that's the plan that's the real the plan is not just to have a global government of
[3:45:15.860 --> 3:45:22.740]  you know baby eating adrenochrome guzzling satanist okay uh that does go on in some places right
[3:45:22.740 --> 3:45:28.180]  but that's not the real long-term goal here the real long-term goal is to be post human to end
[3:45:28.180 --> 3:45:35.860]  man as man is known and so in that sense it is satanic right and claus is just abundantly clear
[3:45:35.860 --> 3:45:41.140]  every chapter in the second half of this book is about the 3d printing the robots will themselves
[3:45:41.140 --> 3:45:48.340]  control to self replicate they will then run giant drone fleets the ai he's saying right they'll have
[3:45:48.340 --> 3:45:56.020]  the killer drones that will then through uh targeted tracking and tracing get rid of anyone
[3:45:56.020 --> 3:46:03.780]  that's a problem and he says by 2030 2040 2050 there won't be humans right you won't be born
[3:46:03.780 --> 3:46:11.700]  in your mom's womb right there'll be crisper technology that will engineer synthetic human
[3:46:11.700 --> 3:46:18.020]  oids synthoids now again i'm not saying that this is going on now or that they have done this
[3:46:18.020 --> 3:46:22.660]  yeah there's that black mirror episode that talks about this right um this is what claus projects
[3:46:22.660 --> 3:46:27.540]  okay head of the economic uh world economic forum head of davos um he says that it's like
[3:46:27.540 --> 3:46:34.420]  prometheus he likens it to prometheus where we will uh change man will genetically modify everything
[3:46:35.620 --> 3:46:42.820]  and he says as and the end result of this will be a new type of reality right where it moves out
[3:46:42.820 --> 3:46:50.100]  of the biological and the carbon into a synthetic wireless almost like a newosphere right something
[3:46:50.100 --> 3:46:54.100]  like i don't know like out of like bringing hell world into this world right like stranger things
[3:46:54.100 --> 3:46:59.220]  like the upside down will be will come into this world through the nanotech now i don't actually
[3:46:59.220 --> 3:47:04.500]  think that they're going to do all of this right um but that is the plan that they have because of
[3:47:04.500 --> 3:47:10.180]  this attitude because of this worldview that they have and he says that um the key to all of this
[3:47:10.180 --> 3:47:15.140]  is to control energy and we have to control energy via the smart dust via the smart tech via the
[3:47:15.140 --> 3:47:21.700]  tracking via a robot drone fleet right that will police everything after everything has
[3:47:21.700 --> 3:47:25.780]  been sprayed with smart dust now that's what he says you can call that crazy if you want to
[3:47:26.420 --> 3:47:31.700]  but that's one of the most influential wealthiest men out there right part of this
[3:47:33.220 --> 3:47:39.620]  global liberal left elite right the the world economic forum and let's bring in our good buddy
[3:47:39.620 --> 3:47:46.340]  oan shroyer to talk about that from the war room oan will be hosting his show immediately after this
[3:47:46.340 --> 3:47:53.620]  episode and uh i think we have a do we have oan with us i'm with you jay how you doing oan
[3:47:54.340 --> 3:47:57.780]  well you know i'm listening to your last segment and i was listening to your whole
[3:47:57.780 --> 3:48:03.700]  hour talking about schwab's book and and the the one trend that continues to kind of ring in my in
[3:48:03.700 --> 3:48:10.020]  my head is is just how cold it is how unhuman is it's like did this guy not get hugged as a child
[3:48:10.020 --> 3:48:14.820]  did this guy not get you know swaddled as a baby i mean seriously like why is he so cold
[3:48:14.820 --> 3:48:19.140]  to humanity to have this outlook yeah we could all look at the innovations and the future and
[3:48:19.140 --> 3:48:23.860]  the trends of technology and just say yeah screw man but that just seems a little too cold for me
[3:48:23.860 --> 3:48:28.660]  jay uh but that seems what these people are into i'll tell you what else is called the treatment
[3:48:28.660 --> 3:48:33.460]  of these miners that are crossing the border and i don't blame border patrol i don't blame ice
[3:48:33.460 --> 3:48:38.820]  they're in a bad situation but the governor of texas has now come out and echoed what we got from
[3:48:38.820 --> 3:48:44.260]  an exclusive source just two weeks ago that children are arriving in these facilities
[3:48:44.260 --> 3:48:50.020]  and re-enacting what's been done to them on the way so they're masturbating they're engaging in
[3:48:50.020 --> 3:48:55.700]  sexual acts with their brothers and sisters and random children this is uh they know that this
[3:48:55.700 --> 3:49:00.340]  is a result of them being raped and molested on the way in here now it's commonplace in these
[3:49:00.340 --> 3:49:05.380]  facilities and now they've also said that undocumented workers that lost their jobs during
[3:49:05.380 --> 3:49:10.660]  the pandemic the biden administration has set aside two billion dollars for non-citizens
[3:49:10.660 --> 3:49:14.180]  most citizens still haven't even gotten a stimulus check so that's all coming up today
