[00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.661]  It's Thursday, April 8th, the year of 2021.
[00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:09.744]  The public, President Joe Biden's Alex Jones Award for all voters, as we speak, is live.
[00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:36.810]  Well, our republic was founded in 1776 when the Redcoats came to take the guns.
[00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.172]  And history is repeating itself again right now.
[00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.733]  Biden just started speaking about 60 seconds ago.
[00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:53.498]  Let's go to the illegitimate puppet president that's destroying our borders, annihilating our dollar, letting China take over Taiwan, Hong Kong, as Russians mass trips on the border with eastern Ukraine.
[00:00:53.498 --> 00:00:55.018]  All hell is breaking loose.
[00:00:55.018 --> 00:00:55.539]  Even J.P.
[00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.440]  Morgan comes out and says, something's horribly wrong in America.
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.822]  You know, we're joined today by the Attorney General Eric Garland, who I've asked to prioritize gun violence.
[00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:07.243]  It's also good to see the second gentleman who is here.
[00:01:26.358 --> 00:01:33.541]  And it's good to see the first lady, Dr. Jill Biden, who cares deeply about this issue as well.
[00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:38.283]  And I look out there and I see so many members of Congress who've led in this fight.
[00:01:38.283 --> 00:01:41.105]  So many of you who've never given up.
[00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:48.148]  So many of you are absolutely determined, as Murfin and others are, to disarm the American people.
[00:01:48.148 --> 00:01:49.288]  We've got a long way to go.
[00:01:49.288 --> 00:01:50.889]  It seems like we always have a long way to go.
[00:01:51.656 --> 00:02:01.142]  But also, today we're taking steps to confront not just the gun crisis, but what is actually a public health crisis.
[00:02:01.142 --> 00:02:07.646]  Nothing, nothing I'm about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment.
[00:02:07.646 --> 00:02:14.451]  They're phony arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment rights at stake from what we're talking about.
[00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:18.213]  But no amendment, no amendment to the Constitution is absolute.
[00:02:20.312 --> 00:02:24.494]  You can't yell fire in a crowded movie theater and call it freedom of speech.
[00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:28.056]  In the very beginning, you couldn't own any weapon you wanted to own.
[00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:32.499]  In the very beginning of the Second Amendment existed, certain people weren't allowed to have weapons.
[00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:40.283]  So the idea is just bizarre to suggest that some of the things we're recommending are contrary to the Constitution.
[00:02:40.283 --> 00:02:43.685]  Gun violence in this country is an epidemic.
[00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:45.587]  Let me say it again.
[00:02:45.587 --> 00:02:47.788]  Gun violence in this country is an epidemic.
[00:02:48.613 --> 00:02:51.815]  And it's an international embarrassment.
[00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:57.938]  You know, we saw it again last night as I was coming to the Oval Office.
[00:02:57.938 --> 00:03:11.865]  I got the word that in South Carolina, a physician with his wife, two grandchildren, and a person working at his house was gunned down.
[00:03:11.865 --> 00:03:12.405]  All five.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.166]  So many people, so many of the people sitting here today know that well, personally.
[00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:27.393]  They know what it's like when the seconds change your life forever.
[00:03:27.393 --> 00:03:34.740]  I've had the pleasure of getting to meet in awful circumstances, many of you,
[00:03:35.826 --> 00:03:37.827]  Let's pull on the heart strings.
[00:03:37.827 --> 00:03:42.430]  Obama shipped millions of guns into Mexico and into the Middle East.
[00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.271]  They know what it's like to bury a piece of their soul.
[00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:47.193]  Destroyed Libya, destroyed Syria.
[00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:48.453]  We understand that.
[00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:49.674]  These guys don't care about human life.
[00:03:49.674 --> 00:03:51.615]  In fact, they hate human life.
[00:03:51.615 --> 00:03:52.696]  For the party of abortion.
[00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:54.697]  For the party of human smuggling.
[00:03:54.697 --> 00:03:57.258]  It's always good to see you, but not under these circumstances.
[00:03:57.258 --> 00:04:03.722]  I want to say, before I introduce the rest of the folks, is, you know, what a lot of people have not been through
[00:04:04.727 --> 00:04:05.027]  Absolutely.
[00:04:05.027 --> 00:04:05.247]  Absolutely.
[00:04:22.156 --> 00:04:27.100]  Daniel loves sports, loves outdoor sports, getting muddy.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.722]  I see my friend, Fred Guttenberg.
[00:04:29.722 --> 00:04:35.466]  His daughter, Jamie, was a freshman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
[00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:37.688]  She was an accomplished dancer.
[00:04:37.688 --> 00:04:44.994]  I see Brandon Wolfe, who was a shooting at the Impulse, at the Pulse club, nightclub.
[00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:49.577]  He survived, but his two best friends died.
[00:04:49.577 --> 00:04:50.338]  Greg Jackson,
[00:04:51.095 --> 00:05:00.263]  Who was just walking down the street... Alright, we'll be right back with more of this babbling puppet that stole the election, this mindless Chinese communist spy.
[00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:04.746]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air.
[00:05:04.746 --> 00:05:07.589]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist.
[00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:15.235]  That the public's so dumbed down, that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.360]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.161]  They play God.
[00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:22.883]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[00:05:22.883 --> 00:05:26.866]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me.
[00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:28.287]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[00:05:28.287 --> 00:05:32.510]  But metaphysically, at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.291]  I have a connection with God.
[00:05:34.291 --> 00:05:37.754]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:45.659]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system, believing you're part of it, or believing you're getting power out of it.
[00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:52.446]  Whether you're just a steel worker or a school teacher or Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[00:05:52.446 --> 00:05:59.008]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like.
[00:05:59.008 --> 00:06:01.848]  And that's a fact.
[00:06:01.848 --> 00:06:03.209]  We shall go on to the end.
[00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:06.769]  We shall fight in France.
[00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:09.930]  We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
[00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.291]  We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
[00:06:15.854 --> 00:06:19.898]  We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[00:06:19.898 --> 00:06:22.100]  We shall fight on the beaches.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.843]  We shall fight on the landing grounds.
[00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:28.506]  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
[00:06:28.506 --> 00:06:30.948]  We shall fight in the hills.
[00:06:30.948 --> 00:06:32.270]  We shall never surrender!
[00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:40.518]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:06:44.264 --> 00:06:56.874]  I want to welcome all the new viewers that tune in every day to this broadcast, but particularly now, we are seeing millions of new people on our servers coming in to visit the live show, the Syndicated Radio Show today.
[00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:58.455]  For a lot of reasons, we'll tell you about that later.
[00:06:58.455 --> 00:07:02.559]  Very exciting to see the awakening accelerate.
[00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:07.002]  The stooge, and that's what a stooge is, is a puppet leader.
[00:07:07.002 --> 00:07:11.546]  The Chinese viceroy, the Chinese puppet, Joe Biden,
[00:07:13.247 --> 00:07:15.728]  is speaking live as we speak, but we've paused it.
[00:07:15.728 --> 00:07:16.728]  We're going to be playing it here for you.
[00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:19.229]  We're just a few minutes behind live time.
[00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:24.931]  Pledging to just ban all semi-autos, ban anybody that bought parts and made a firearm.
[00:07:24.931 --> 00:07:30.393]  He is trying to appoint an individual who is the worst gun grabber in the world.
[00:07:30.393 --> 00:07:34.615]  David Chipman is a manifest lunatic fraud.
[00:07:34.615 --> 00:07:37.216]  He says no one should be able to own any guns, period.
[00:07:37.216 --> 00:07:40.897]  You should only have deadbolts or maybe a baseball bat.
[00:07:40.897 --> 00:07:41.177]  He says
[00:07:42.043 --> 00:07:53.209]  Gun owners falsely believe in zombies, and he says that two helicopters were shot down by the Branch Civilians before the ATF ever assaulted the cattle trailers.
[00:07:53.209 --> 00:07:58.732]  That's like saying the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl this year.
[00:07:58.732 --> 00:08:00.293]  No, they didn't.
[00:08:00.293 --> 00:08:01.574]  The Tampa Bay Buccaneers did.
[00:08:01.574 --> 00:08:07.777]  I mean, it is an outrageous lie that a five-year-old could prove.
[00:08:07.777 --> 00:08:08.758]  We're going to get into this guy.
[00:08:08.758 --> 00:08:10.559]  I haven't even scratched the surface of it, but here's
[00:08:11.423 --> 00:08:16.706]  Here's the Chi-Com puppet, and listen, the alarm bells are hitting.
[00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:27.471]  China has now, with aircraft carriers and over a hundred ships, large ships, thousands totaled, encircled Taiwan and has heavy bombers flying over it.
[00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:31.593]  The Taiwanese say they may start firing missiles any minute.
[00:08:31.593 --> 00:08:33.234]  That was this morning.
[00:08:33.234 --> 00:08:35.135]  Last night there.
[00:08:35.135 --> 00:08:36.336]  All hell is breaking loose.
[00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:47.467]  The Russians are massing troops on the edge of Ukraine because Biden's sending in heavy weapons and there are major artillery battles going on between proxy U.S.
[00:08:47.467 --> 00:08:51.008]  and Russian forces, and we are not the good guys in this.
[00:08:51.008 --> 00:08:54.569]  This is unbelievably horrible.
[00:08:54.569 --> 00:08:56.389]  The Chinese communists are taking over.
[00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:58.630]  We're busy starting a war with Russia.
[00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.491]  This is just unprecedented folly and destruction.
[00:09:01.491 --> 00:09:03.071]  And of course, the border's being dissolved.
[00:09:04.556 --> 00:09:07.318]  Pelosi says that the border is being fixed and is doing great.
[00:09:07.318 --> 00:09:17.226]  I've got that coming up, but we paused Biden during the break, right where he was talking about the border, and then he gets into the plan for your self-defense while he has all these bodyguards.
[00:09:17.226 --> 00:09:21.209]  Here it is.
[00:09:21.209 --> 00:09:31.097]  Every time you show up at an event like this, it brings back, when you got that phone call, it brings back the immediacy of what happened at that moment.
[00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.071]  So I genuinely mean it.
[00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:35.212]  Thank you.
[00:09:35.212 --> 00:09:36.813]  Thank you for having the courage.
[00:09:36.813 --> 00:09:38.134]  He cares so much about violence.
[00:09:38.134 --> 00:09:39.595]  That's why Obama funded the Arab Spring.
[00:09:39.595 --> 00:09:40.916]  Courage to continue this fight.
[00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:42.296]  Fast and furious, killed millions.
[00:09:42.296 --> 00:09:43.857]  Senator Blumenthal understands it.
[00:09:43.857 --> 00:09:46.999]  A lot of the folks out here understand it.
[00:09:46.999 --> 00:09:48.620]  He trans-shipped weapons to terrorists in Mexico.
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.322]  Thank you.
[00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:54.484]  To turn pain into purpose and demand that we take the action that gives meaning.
[00:09:54.484 --> 00:09:56.846]  He's a gun-running, communist Chinese criminal.
[00:09:58.251 --> 00:10:01.853]  Yeah, enough of you funding terrorists, you drug dealing pedophile!
[00:10:01.853 --> 00:10:07.675]  What they want you to know, what they want you to do, is not just listen.
[00:10:07.675 --> 00:10:12.837]  Every day in this country, 316 people are shot.
[00:10:12.837 --> 00:10:13.398]  Every single day.
[00:10:13.398 --> 00:10:15.579]  Yeah, most of them criminals.
[00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:16.939]  106 of them die.
[00:10:16.939 --> 00:10:19.860]  And 10,000 people a day die of something else.
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:25.483]  Our flag was still flying at half-staff for the victims of the horrific murder of eight
[00:10:26.187 --> 00:10:27.788]  Primarily Asian-American people.
[00:10:27.788 --> 00:10:29.770]  Have you noticed the flags are always at half-staff now?
[00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:30.691]  Another demoralization.
[00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:36.235]  That's supposed to be if a president dies and the challenger blows up.
[00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:43.641]  You probably didn't hear, but between those two incidents, less than one week apart, there were more than 850 additional shootings.
[00:10:47.323 --> 00:10:47.343]  850.
[00:10:47.343 --> 00:10:48.986]  And most of it black-on-black.
[00:10:48.986 --> 00:10:52.551]  The lives of more than 250 people.
[00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:54.354]  Total line pig.
[00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:56.097]  500.
[00:10:56.097 --> 00:10:57.439]  500 injured.
[00:10:57.439 --> 00:11:00.283]  This is an epidemic for God's sake.
[00:11:00.283 --> 00:11:01.224]  And it has to stop.
[00:11:01.224 --> 00:11:02.146]  Alright, pause again.
[00:11:03.035 --> 00:11:10.843]  It's an epidemic, just like COVID's a pandemic, but not really an epidemic, because it didn't really kill that many people, so they counted all the other deaths as that.
[00:11:10.843 --> 00:11:15.968]  But now there's so many deaths from the vaccine, suddenly death numbers are going up, and they're calling those COVID deaths.
[00:11:15.968 --> 00:11:20.092]  In fact, that was in my COVID stack from yesterday, and you guys brought it in.
[00:11:20.092 --> 00:11:21.713]  I didn't get to the COVID stack yesterday.
[00:11:21.713 --> 00:11:22.994]  I only scratched the surface.
[00:11:22.994 --> 00:11:27.459]  I'm going to hit that, and today it's all over the top insane.
[00:11:27.459 --> 00:11:27.599]  But
[00:11:28.863 --> 00:11:29.824]  That's their slogan.
[00:11:29.824 --> 00:11:30.544]  Never again.
[00:11:30.544 --> 00:11:32.205]  Never again one person gets shot.
[00:11:32.205 --> 00:11:32.886]  What about stabbed?
[00:11:32.886 --> 00:11:33.506]  What about run over?
[00:11:33.506 --> 00:11:34.387]  What about poison?
[00:11:34.387 --> 00:11:35.107]  What about strangled?
[00:11:35.107 --> 00:11:36.809]  What about beating it up in the club?
[00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:38.330]  It's evil people.
[00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.290]  It's not the guns.
[00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.392]  And we have our guns to protect ourselves.
[00:11:41.392 --> 00:11:43.273]  What is it, 14 times?
[00:11:43.273 --> 00:11:45.535]  The FBI admits for every time a gun's used in a crime?
[00:11:45.535 --> 00:11:50.278]  14 times it's used to stop crime or frustrate a crime?
[00:11:50.278 --> 00:11:52.120]  They know that!
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.724]  And they want us to live like their slaves do in Chicago and New York and L.A.
[00:11:57.724 --> 00:11:58.184]  and places.
[00:11:58.996 --> 00:12:01.638]  He's a monster.
[00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:03.860]  He had the left burn down cities last summer.
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:09.144]  And when business owners protected themselves, they were called terrorists.
[00:12:09.144 --> 00:12:11.746]  And they're starting a race war in America.
[00:12:11.746 --> 00:12:13.207]  He will never get our guns.
[00:12:13.207 --> 00:12:14.568]  It will cause a civil war.
[00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:16.550]  But that's what he wants.
[00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.590]  That's what the Chi-Coms want.
[00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.512]  It's why they're making this move.
[00:12:19.512 --> 00:12:20.613]  It's insane.
[00:12:20.613 --> 00:12:23.335]  And it's a death sentence for those that try to carry it out.
[00:12:23.335 --> 00:12:25.096]  Which is even more what he wants.
[00:12:25.096 --> 00:12:27.198]  To get rid of our federal, state law enforcement.
[00:12:28.419 --> 00:12:33.640]  This is the destruction of the country, the dollar, the borders, our families.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.900]  This is war.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.201]  This is globalism.
[00:12:36.201 --> 00:12:37.861]  This is by design rejected.
[00:12:37.861 --> 00:12:41.762]  And what is they've already announced what the executive orders are he's about to announce?
[00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:44.863]  All the park guns, tens of millions sold that weren't guns.
[00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:45.923]  They're going to call them that.
[00:12:45.923 --> 00:12:49.644]  A piece of this, a piece of that, any part of a gun, they're going to call it a firearm.
[00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:50.124]  His new
[00:12:51.144 --> 00:12:53.306]  ATF that he's trying to get put through.
[00:12:53.306 --> 00:13:02.734]  David Chipman has said that he wants all semi-autos banned and he's also supported cities that have total gun bans like DC and said get a deadbolt.
[00:13:02.734 --> 00:13:04.576]  The man is a monster.
[00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.177]  Oh, but he's got a detail of bodyguards.
[00:13:06.177 --> 00:13:07.058]  That's okay for him.
[00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:13.471]  And Chipman goes all the way back to the Clintons and the things the ATF did then, and we all know what that is.
[00:13:13.471 --> 00:13:19.392]  And we all know about Fast and Furious, shipping millions of guns into Mexico to trans-ship them to the Middle East for the Arab Spring.
[00:13:19.392 --> 00:13:21.573]  That's why Al-Qaeda and ISIS and al-Nusra had U.S.
[00:13:21.573 --> 00:13:22.073]  weapons.
[00:13:22.073 --> 00:13:26.454]  Let's go to break with this lying sack of Chinese Communist garbage.
[00:13:26.454 --> 00:13:28.054]  Two things.
[00:13:28.054 --> 00:13:31.415]  First, the steps we're going to take immediately.
[00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:36.796]  And second, the action that needs to be taken going forward to curb the epidemic of gun violence.
[00:13:38.425 --> 00:13:49.452]  I asked the Attorney General and his team to identify for me immediate, concrete actions I could take now, without having to go through the Congress.
[00:13:49.452 --> 00:13:55.956]  And today, I'm announcing several initial steps my administration is taking to curb this epidemic of gun violence.
[00:13:55.956 --> 00:14:03.341]  Much more need be done, but first, I want to rein in the proliferation of so-called ghost guns.
[00:14:03.341 --> 00:14:06.763]  These are guns that are homemade, built from a kit,
[00:14:07.435 --> 00:14:09.977]  And include directions on how to finish the firearm.
[00:14:09.977 --> 00:14:12.720]  You can go buy the kit.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.102]  They have no serial numbers.
[00:14:15.102 --> 00:14:19.406]  So when they show up at a crime scene, they can't be traced.
[00:14:19.406 --> 00:14:23.470]  And the buyers aren't required to pass a background check to buy the kit.
[00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.372]  To make the gun.
[00:14:25.372 --> 00:14:32.278]  Consequently, anyone, anyone from a criminal to a terrorist can buy this kit.
[00:14:32.927 --> 00:14:35.650]  As little as 30 minutes put together a weapon.
[00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.351]  They're not just trying to ban the kits now.
[00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:43.196]  You know, I want to see these kits treated as firearms under the Gun Control Act.
[00:14:43.196 --> 00:14:49.182]  Which is going to require that the seller and manufacturers make the key parts with serial numbers.
[00:14:50.183 --> 00:14:54.785]  And run background checks on the buyers when they walk in to buy that.
[00:14:54.785 --> 00:14:56.406]  And that gets rid of the gun shows, right there.
[00:14:56.406 --> 00:14:59.567]  The second action we're going to take... That's registration.
[00:14:59.567 --> 00:15:04.029]  Back in 2000, the year 2000, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms... Alright, let's stop there.
[00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:05.350]  Let's come back.
[00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.551]  Again, we know what's about to be announced, but this is just the beginning.
[00:15:08.551 --> 00:15:10.252]  And every time there's another shooting, which is going to happen...
[00:15:11.258 --> 00:15:27.865]  Almost every person's on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, an antidepressant, which on the insert, they knew in the 80s when they got Prozac approved, that it was causing massive, triple the number of suicides, and massive increases in what they called psychotic breaks, megalomania.
[00:15:27.865 --> 00:15:29.305]  Read the inserts, man.
[00:15:29.305 --> 00:15:32.306]  They're all varied, but boy, they're scary as hell.
[00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:34.187]  And I've known people that are on these.
[00:15:34.187 --> 00:15:36.188]  I had girlfriends that went on it.
[00:15:36.188 --> 00:15:37.688]  I had to break up with them.
[00:15:37.688 --> 00:15:39.029]  They were completely different women in two months.
[00:15:39.847 --> 00:15:43.510]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:47.132]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[00:15:47.132 --> 00:15:50.734]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[00:16:09.227 --> 00:16:13.591]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[00:16:13.591 --> 00:16:19.357]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.

[00:17:38.467 --> 00:17:40.148]  The supply chains are breaking down.
[00:17:40.148 --> 00:17:41.328]  We tried to put in a bigger order.
[00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:46.410]  We couldn't even get it because getting high-quality ingredients is very, very hard and we're not going to cut corners.

[00:17:52.353 --> 00:17:54.154]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:18.653 --> 00:18:20.795]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:18:20.795 --> 00:18:21.155]  to 3 p.m.
[00:18:21.155 --> 00:18:24.037]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:24.037 --> 00:18:25.558]  And I know you don't want to listen to Joe Biden.
[00:18:25.558 --> 00:18:26.479]  I don't want to look at him.
[00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:27.400]  I don't want to hear from him.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.181]  He's the guy that stole the election.
[00:18:29.181 --> 00:18:29.862]  That's all come out.
[00:18:29.862 --> 00:18:33.445]  The scientists, the experts, they've all documented it.
[00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:38.188]  And they're now trying to break the country for the big banks to come in and fully consolidate it.
[00:18:38.188 --> 00:18:40.130]  They've decided China is the future.
[00:18:40.868 --> 00:18:44.070]  Australia, New Zealand, the US, Europe, Canada.
[00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.272]  We're closed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:46.272 --> 00:18:48.793]  The third world will then be exploited, collapsed into us.
[00:18:48.793 --> 00:18:50.774]  We'll be all made poor slaves.
[00:18:50.774 --> 00:18:54.877]  The globalists will fly around above us in their private jets.
[00:18:54.877 --> 00:18:57.338]  And we will be on the carbon plantation.
[00:18:57.338 --> 00:19:00.320]  This is the admitted post-industrial world.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.162]  And remember, Joe Biden has bodyguards.
[00:19:02.162 --> 00:19:07.525]  Remember, now these Democrats, even down to mayors that defund the police, in the case of Minneapolis.
[00:19:08.129 --> 00:19:09.572]  Defunded half the police.
[00:19:09.572 --> 00:19:11.756]  Crime rate more than tripled there.
[00:19:11.756 --> 00:19:16.966]  National average has doubled in just the last few years since the Democrats launched this attack on the police.
[00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:25.992]  They said, oh, they did a huge, it was like an $8 million contract for a year to protect the city council.
[00:19:25.992 --> 00:19:27.993]  Then they did another contract.
[00:19:27.993 --> 00:19:38.756]  So 24 hours a day at their offices and at their homes, they have two bodyguards apiece, but you don't get police and you don't get to have guns on top of it.
[00:19:38.756 --> 00:19:40.696]  Get a deadbolt.
[00:19:40.696 --> 00:19:45.918]  As Obama's new nominee for the ATF head.
[00:19:47.117 --> 00:19:50.519]  Says, so going into this insanity, going into the breakdown of the border.
[00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:55.502]  I mean, they've just said, if you're in the third world, rush the border.
[00:19:55.502 --> 00:19:57.763]  And they're rushing, and it's just massive.
[00:19:57.763 --> 00:20:00.885]  And then Pelosi says, oh, MS-13's all God's children.
[00:20:00.885 --> 00:20:01.845]  There's no crisis.
[00:20:01.845 --> 00:20:07.268]  The border's getting better, she said, even though it's 10 times the numbers it was under Obama.
[00:20:07.268 --> 00:20:10.310]  More than 20 times what it was under Trump, because Trump shut it down.
[00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.951]  It is a nightmare scenario.
[00:20:12.951 --> 00:20:14.032]  And then what happened yesterday?
[00:20:15.094 --> 00:20:15.935]  Two days ago.
[00:20:15.935 --> 00:20:19.598]  We put out the video that has probably 50 million views.
[00:20:19.598 --> 00:20:21.679]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:26.063]  And the smuggling going on, it's all illegal.
[00:20:26.063 --> 00:20:27.344]  He didn't sign an executive order.
[00:20:27.344 --> 00:20:29.005]  He didn't pass a law.
[00:20:29.005 --> 00:20:30.046]  He didn't repeal a law.
[00:20:30.046 --> 00:20:34.550]  He just said, surge us before he's even stole the election.
[00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.112]  And then now he congratulates them on the great job they've done.
[00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:40.335]  And then there's the quote Catholic charity that's run by the Democratic Party.
[00:20:40.335 --> 00:20:42.977]  Just one of the facilities there in McAllen, Texas.
[00:20:44.565 --> 00:20:49.646]  And there they are, loading little kids in to a trunk, like luggage, and we stop them.
[00:20:49.646 --> 00:20:51.066]  The police say, yeah, what you're doing is illegal.
[00:20:51.066 --> 00:20:51.766]  Take them out.
[00:20:51.766 --> 00:20:52.446]  They go inside.
[00:20:52.446 --> 00:20:54.067]  We catch more cars doing it.
[00:20:54.067 --> 00:20:56.507]  We haven't even put that footage out!
[00:20:56.507 --> 00:21:02.288]  Because I went and got on a helicopter and flew back to Austin, and the crew came back the next day.
[00:21:02.288 --> 00:21:09.269]  We have hours of footage, and all I've got is two guys in there, overworked, exhausted, trying to download it all and put it out.
[00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:12.990]  We've got stuff even worse than that!
[00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.770]  And then how does
[00:21:14.591 --> 00:21:20.493]  Literally dozens of national newspapers said, Jones probably staged this, there are no crisis.
[00:21:20.493 --> 00:21:22.754]  Yeah, I staged the McAllen police.
[00:21:22.754 --> 00:21:25.115]  I staged the kids being put in a trunk.
[00:21:25.115 --> 00:21:37.300]  I mean, if I could stage something like that with a $100 million budget, I would be better than the top directors out there.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.181]  I mean, it's totally real.
[00:21:40.865 --> 00:21:45.946]  You can go to McAllen and you can sit there and every 30 minutes this is going on.
[00:21:45.946 --> 00:21:50.807]  Hell, every 10 minutes it's going on with big buses, you name it!
[00:21:50.807 --> 00:21:59.729]  But the left says there is no Antifa, there is no Satanism, there is no abortion, but they're doing it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:59.729 --> 00:22:02.830]  And it's so incredibly exploitive.
[00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:09.371]  Drew Hernandez was on yesterday and I didn't even know they were denying it was real yesterday because it went out the night before on Tuesday night.
[00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:12.300]  And he's like, I want to tell everybody this was real.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.282]  I'm an investigative journalist and I was there.
[00:22:14.282 --> 00:22:14.722]  It's real.
[00:22:14.722 --> 00:22:16.524]  And I'm like, oh, come on, Dermot, ignore those people.
[00:22:16.524 --> 00:22:20.908]  I didn't know by then it was already in newspapers saying we just made this up.
[00:22:20.908 --> 00:22:28.295]  Kind of like back when I would cover Bilderberg and the New York Times.
[00:22:28.295 --> 00:22:33.640]  I guess it was like 2008, yeah, Chantilly, Virginia said Jones was at
[00:22:36.218 --> 00:22:42.281]  This hotel conference center imagining men with dark glasses and imagining Secret Service.
[00:22:42.281 --> 00:22:53.347]  They had marines, they had helicopters, they had State Department people everywhere, all on video with the King of Spain on video entering.
[00:22:53.347 --> 00:22:56.769]  We stayed in the hotel until they actually got there, were thrown out.
[00:22:56.769 --> 00:23:01.492]  The Queen of the Netherlands, David Rockefeller, all on video and the New York Times said,
[00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:11.859]  It did not exist, and then I was having a full schizophrenic breakdown in the parking lot.
[00:23:11.859 --> 00:23:14.420]  That's because back then, folks, Bilderberg didn't exist.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:20.702]  Within two years, it was all over the news, because back then the Drudge Report was not, I guess, run by CNN.
[00:23:20.702 --> 00:23:22.823]  I was told that CNN bought it two years ago.
[00:23:22.823 --> 00:23:23.443]  I didn't believe it.
[00:23:23.443 --> 00:23:25.384]  It looks like it's true.
[00:23:25.384 --> 00:23:30.386]  But Drudge, the real Drudge, back when Drudge actually owned it, exposed all that.
[00:23:31.602 --> 00:23:43.298]  And so that's why I'm probably mad at Grudge because he did so good for so long and then, you know, like a goose that lays golden eggs for freedom for 25 years and then turns into a demon in the middle of the night and starts biting you.
[00:23:43.298 --> 00:23:44.479]  But I still kind of love it.
[00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:45.741]  You know what I mean?
[00:23:45.741 --> 00:23:46.942]  Even as you see it walking out the door.
[00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:49.991]  Anyways, I'm digressing.
[00:23:49.991 --> 00:23:51.592]  I'm going to come back and play the Biden thing.
[00:23:51.592 --> 00:23:55.234]  I've got so much news here, but anyone could do this.
[00:23:55.234 --> 00:23:59.096]  And I'm not going to say what we're going to do, but I'm obviously going to be going back to the border very soon.
[00:23:59.096 --> 00:24:01.698]  I'm not going to say it should be tomorrow or even this weekend.
[00:24:01.698 --> 00:24:02.538]  It might be today.
[00:24:02.538 --> 00:24:03.619]  I'm just going to tell you that.
[00:24:03.619 --> 00:24:04.799]  I've already decided when I'm going.
[00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:05.360]  I'm going.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.601]  I'm not going to tell this system how or when.
[00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:13.164]  And quite frankly, if I had the money, because we're maxed out right now,
[00:24:15.041 --> 00:24:19.805]  I would have a full-time team just in McAllen and in Brownsville roving the Texas border.
[00:24:19.805 --> 00:24:21.927]  It is wild, wild west.
[00:24:21.927 --> 00:24:22.587]  Insane.
[00:24:22.587 --> 00:24:24.028]  Illegals everywhere you go.
[00:24:24.028 --> 00:24:25.650]  Buses everywhere you go.
[00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:30.013]  Total children sleeping in dirt under bridges.
[00:24:30.013 --> 00:24:30.994]  We sent a drone in there.
[00:24:30.994 --> 00:24:33.536]  They had a geofence up so we couldn't show them in the dirt.
[00:24:33.536 --> 00:24:35.177]  But Project Veritas got folks in there.
[00:24:35.177 --> 00:24:36.478]  We have all these whistleblowers.
[00:24:36.478 --> 00:24:37.920]  All this whistleblower video.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.061]  People that saw children being raped inside the facilities.
[00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:41.082]  We broke that on Monday.
[00:24:41.082 --> 00:24:42.824]  Now you see Governor Abbott talking about it.
[00:24:44.323 --> 00:24:46.564]  I flew over it with a helicopter.
[00:24:46.564 --> 00:24:49.224]  We have hours and hours and hours of this footage.
[00:24:49.224 --> 00:24:54.186]  And that's why you need to go to InfoWarsStore.com so we can stay on air.
[00:24:54.186 --> 00:24:55.366]  Now do you see what's happening?
[00:24:55.366 --> 00:25:12.251]  As everything we talked about went on, despite the fact you're trying to censor us and block us, InfoWars, I want to report to you our success so that you understand why you've supported us as the core audience of the core radio stations that are like, you know, funding us to go out and be the missionaries to tell the truth against the globalists.
[00:25:12.251 --> 00:25:13.011]  That's what you're doing here.
[00:25:14.992 --> 00:25:20.554]  We are reaching right now basically 10 million extra people a day conservatively just in the U.S.
[00:25:20.554 --> 00:25:21.034]  alone.
[00:25:21.034 --> 00:25:24.335]  I mean we have hit super zeitgeist for the last month.
[00:25:24.335 --> 00:25:29.616]  I'm not even bragged about it because the enemy is already watching but they already understand now there's no point you can't hide this from them.
[00:25:29.616 --> 00:25:31.317]  We are just dominating.
[00:25:31.317 --> 00:25:33.057]  I've got world leaders calling me.
[00:25:33.477 --> 00:25:37.062]  Every major talk show host that's there, that's a Patriot, calls me every day.
[00:25:37.062 --> 00:25:40.185]  I've gotten a call by three of them in the last two hours.
[00:25:40.185 --> 00:25:42.468]  There's a total conversion awakening happening.
[00:25:42.468 --> 00:25:44.671]  We've blown the enemy sky-high with the truth.
[00:25:44.671 --> 00:25:49.977]  And so they may be able to destroy the country and start a war with Russia, but in the end, everybody's going to know that these puppet chi-coms did it.
[00:25:51.577 --> 00:25:53.258]  And so, I need your support, though.
[00:25:53.258 --> 00:26:00.382]  We are winning in the realm of ideas, winning in the realm of fighting Satan with God's truth, but we need money to run this operation.
[00:26:00.382 --> 00:26:01.443]  I need to hire a bunch of people.
[00:26:01.443 --> 00:26:02.963]  I need to do a lot more.
[00:26:02.963 --> 00:26:06.285]  I got a lot of folks I want to hire, a lot of folks I want to sponsor, but I don't have the money.
[00:26:06.285 --> 00:26:10.728]  So, InfoWorksStore.com, Vitamineral Fusion is going to sell out by next week.
[00:26:10.728 --> 00:26:13.089]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, everything you need for your immune system.
[00:26:13.089 --> 00:26:13.950]  Everybody should be taking this.
[00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.191]  Men, women, adults, children, old people, young people.
[00:26:17.422 --> 00:26:20.465]  Black, white, but particularly, I mean, virtue signal, it's not virtue signaling.
[00:26:20.465 --> 00:26:24.008]  If you've got dark skin, you really need this if you're not getting a lot of sun.
[00:26:24.008 --> 00:26:27.191]  And we also have winter sun, ladies and gentlemen, back in stock.
[00:26:27.191 --> 00:26:35.999]  The highest quality vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue with vitamin K. Everybody should be taking this unless you're getting hours of direct sun on your whole body every week, okay?
[00:26:35.999 --> 00:26:37.120]  You need to boost this up.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.181]  Why did Florida not have problems?
[00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:39.842]  Because they're out in the sun, okay?
[00:26:39.842 --> 00:26:42.965]  Well, if you're not out in the sun and you're not, if you're mowing lawns every day, you don't need this.
[00:26:43.559 --> 00:26:44.780]  If you're a lifeguard, you don't need this.
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:50.903]  But if you're black, or you're white, or you're whatever, and you're not in the sun a lot, you need this, or you're totally susceptible to everything.
[00:26:50.903 --> 00:26:51.723]  And that's a fact.
[00:26:51.723 --> 00:26:52.884]  The globals don't want you to know that.
[00:26:52.884 --> 00:26:53.785]  It's all 40% off.
[00:26:53.785 --> 00:26:55.085]  Together, 50% off.
[00:26:55.085 --> 00:26:57.907]  Infowars.com.
[00:26:57.907 --> 00:27:04.830]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:09.413]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[00:27:11.125 --> 00:27:14.549]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:19.634]  They will do whatever they are told, as if obedience is a virtue.
[00:27:19.634 --> 00:27:23.878]  It is the patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[00:27:25.286 --> 00:27:34.910]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:39.052]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[00:27:39.052 --> 00:27:45.515]  That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[00:27:45.515 --> 00:27:50.778]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[00:27:50.778 --> 00:27:52.498]  So help me God.
[00:27:52.498 --> 00:27:53.299]  Infowars.com
[00:27:54.259 --> 00:28:07.445]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[00:28:07.445 --> 00:28:13.929]  Even before I had an access TV show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that looks fun.
[00:28:13.929 --> 00:28:19.031]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[00:28:19.031 --> 00:28:20.832]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[00:28:23.756 --> 00:28:24.777]  We're not worthy!
[00:28:24.777 --> 00:28:28.758]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you.
[00:28:28.758 --> 00:28:30.759]  Because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[00:28:30.759 --> 00:28:32.139]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[00:28:32.139 --> 00:28:34.180]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.861]  The globalists love lying to you.
[00:28:35.861 --> 00:28:37.181]  They love manipulating you.
[00:28:37.181 --> 00:28:39.842]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[00:28:39.842 --> 00:28:44.524]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[00:28:44.524 --> 00:28:47.945]  That, for me, is really satanic and disgusting.
[00:28:47.945 --> 00:28:50.246]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole Infowars crew
[00:28:51.887 --> 00:28:53.750]  We will never join the globalists.
[00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.833]  We will never knowingly manipulate you.
[00:28:55.833 --> 00:28:57.155]  Because we know we're all in this together.
[00:28:57.961 --> 00:29:00.522]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[00:29:00.522 --> 00:29:04.224]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine.
[00:29:04.224 --> 00:29:11.386]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our families' sakes, but also our community.
[00:29:11.386 --> 00:29:18.309]  And citizenstronghold.com is the best place to go to get high-quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[00:29:18.309 --> 00:29:22.091]  Again, this is high-quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[00:29:22.091 --> 00:29:25.752]  We've worked with them for years, but they can never supply enough to our audience.
[00:29:25.752 --> 00:29:27.533]  They have massively expanded their factories.
[00:29:27.873 --> 00:29:31.914]  It's made right here in America, and they're ready to ship it to you right now.
[00:29:31.914 --> 00:29:33.755]  CitizenStronghold.com.
[00:29:33.755 --> 00:29:38.057]  When you go there, put in promo code ALEX and get 10% off on your purchases.
[00:29:38.057 --> 00:29:40.477]  They have it for children, they have it for women, they have it for men.
[00:29:40.477 --> 00:29:44.359]  They have backpacks that didn't unfold and are full top body armor.
[00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:47.840]  They've got it all right now ready to ship to you, 10% off.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.761]  And the globalists are coming to try to stop the sale of it soon.
[00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:54.482]  That's why you need to get it now at CitizenStronghold.com.
[00:29:54.482 --> 00:29:55.763]  Promo code ALEX and get 10% off.
[00:29:58.283 --> 00:30:06.409]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registrars that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:14.275]  And they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[00:30:14.275 --> 00:30:17.357]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:25.503]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[00:30:25.703 --> 00:30:26.083]  Thank you.
[00:30:43.948 --> 00:30:50.772]  So it's a win-win as we build a true, open, free internet again, because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[00:30:50.772 --> 00:30:53.794]  So, InfoWarsDomains.com.
[00:30:53.794 --> 00:30:55.215]  The revolution starts there.
[00:30:55.215 --> 00:30:57.016]  InfoWarsDomains.com.
[00:30:57.016 --> 00:31:01.298]  Take action now!
[00:31:01.298 --> 00:31:03.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:19.403 --> 00:31:30.091]  Well, I believe, I'm glad you asked that question in a larger sense, instead of quoting the ridiculousness of the Republicans in the Congress.
[00:31:30.091 --> 00:31:37.096]  The fact is, is that we're on a good path at the border under the leadership of Joe Biden, President Biden.
[00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:39.593]  There is, it's about three things.
[00:31:39.593 --> 00:31:48.379]  It's about restructuring how we do what is happening there because we were in a very bad situation under the Trump administration.
[00:31:48.379 --> 00:31:50.261]  It's about a refugee plan.
[00:32:12.706 --> 00:32:21.108]  Today, with online sales and ghost guns, times and trafficking methods have changed.
[00:32:21.108 --> 00:32:23.549]  And we have to adjust.
[00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:27.730]  We also have to ask the Justice Department to release a new annual report.
[00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:35.412]  This report will better help policy makers address firearms trafficking as it is today, not what it was yesterday.
[00:32:36.701 --> 00:32:38.302]  A third change.
[00:32:38.302 --> 00:32:45.405]  We want to treat pistols modified with stabilizing braces with the seriousness they deserve.
[00:32:45.405 --> 00:32:52.587]  A stabilizing brace hook and a pencil essentially makes that pistol a hell of a lot more accurate than a mini rifle.
[00:32:52.587 --> 00:32:59.090]  As a result, it's more lethal, effectively turning into a short-barreled rifle.
[00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.831]  That's what the alleged shooter in Boulder appears to have done.
[00:33:01.831 --> 00:33:03.492]  I want to be clear.
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:11.763]  That these modifications to firearms that make them more lethal should be subject to the National Firearms Act.
[00:33:11.763 --> 00:33:21.326]  The National Firearms Act requires that a potential owner pay $200 fee and submit their name and other identifying information to the Justice Department.
[00:33:21.326 --> 00:33:26.288]  Just as they would if they went out and purchased a silencer for a gun.
[00:33:26.288 --> 00:33:29.149]  Fourthly, during my campaign for President,
[00:33:29.978 --> 00:33:35.981]  I wanted to make it easier for states to adopt extreme risk protection order laws.
[00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:43.445]  They're also called red flag laws, which everybody in this lawn knows, but many people listening do not know.
[00:33:43.445 --> 00:33:46.947]  Wow, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to back that up.
[00:33:46.947 --> 00:33:55.571]  He is now announcing that basically firearms are going to be like silencers or fully automatic, where you've got to go get an ATF stamp.
[00:33:56.443 --> 00:33:58.185]  And get fingerprinted and get registered.
[00:33:58.185 --> 00:33:59.005]  Wow!
[00:33:59.005 --> 00:34:02.308]  So this is even more draconian than they had been saying they were.
[00:34:02.308 --> 00:34:04.710]  And he's acting like it's all completely normal.
[00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.232]  He's acting like it's no big deal.
[00:34:06.232 --> 00:34:08.594]  He's acting like it's no problem.
[00:34:08.594 --> 00:34:10.455]  Again, welcome back here to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:10.455 --> 00:34:12.317]  These people are just, just, just criminals.
[00:34:13.044 --> 00:34:14.264]  Remember, they have bodyguards.
[00:34:14.264 --> 00:34:15.425]  They're collapsing the country.
[00:34:15.425 --> 00:34:16.825]  They shipped the fentanyl in.
[00:34:16.825 --> 00:34:19.426]  They told China they can invade Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[00:34:19.426 --> 00:34:21.706]  He said that a month ago on CNN.
[00:34:21.706 --> 00:34:24.987]  And China has now encircled Taiwan and says they may invade.
[00:34:24.987 --> 00:34:28.628]  They announced they may physically begin bombardment yesterday.
[00:34:28.628 --> 00:34:33.810]  I mean, just world-shattering insane news that could lead into World War III.
[00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:36.070]  Just unspeakably insane.
[00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:38.791]  Nothing like this has gone on since World War II.
[00:34:38.791 --> 00:34:42.152]  And we have a bumbling idiot, who's a CHICOM agent,
[00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:51.956]  Whose son's laptop has audio of him saying, I work for the Communist Chinese and I'm being investigated by the Southern District and my daddy's gotten a call from the FBI.
[00:34:51.956 --> 00:34:54.197]  That's who our president is!
[00:34:54.197 --> 00:34:55.418]  And he wants our guns!
[00:34:55.418 --> 00:34:56.339]  That's his main mission.
[00:34:56.339 --> 00:35:01.942]  And don't worry, United Airlines says they're going to have 50% of their pilots be black women.
[00:35:04.648 --> 00:35:08.431]  Well, if a black woman wants to go learn to be a pilot and do it, that's one thing.
[00:35:08.431 --> 00:35:13.114]  They're saying, no, no, we're going to only take applications from black women.
[00:35:13.114 --> 00:35:15.896]  What does this even mean?
[00:35:15.896 --> 00:35:18.518]  This is the destruction of the country.
[00:35:18.518 --> 00:35:21.220]  It's insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.141]  But it's the same thing.
[00:35:22.141 --> 00:35:23.042]  Oh, it's a target.
[00:35:23.042 --> 00:35:24.843]  Make sure the boys and girls stuff's all together.
[00:35:27.512 --> 00:35:31.914]  Because girls don't want to be policemen and firemen, so we're going to make them be policemen and firemen.
[00:35:31.914 --> 00:35:34.476]  Again, we're going to make black women go be pilots.
[00:35:34.476 --> 00:35:35.456]  That's all we're going to hire.
[00:35:35.456 --> 00:35:37.798]  50% is black women.
[00:35:37.798 --> 00:35:40.419]  Although black women want to be a pilot, they can, and a lot of them are.
[00:35:40.419 --> 00:35:42.700]  But this is about lowering standards.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:47.923]  Like the military just said, we're going to lower standards so we can have more women in.
[00:35:47.923 --> 00:35:51.185]  Because the type of women that are going and wanting to be in the military are not up to those standards.
[00:35:52.509 --> 00:35:54.210]  Does it mean that black women are bad pilots?
[00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:57.573]  It means, ladies and gentlemen, that they weren't out trying to do it.
[00:35:57.573 --> 00:36:01.396]  And so now you're going to lower standards to basically push a group to go do it.
[00:36:01.396 --> 00:36:02.537]  It's mental illness.
[00:36:02.537 --> 00:36:06.240]  It's total destruction of society.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.263]  Continue.
[00:36:10.263 --> 00:36:12.665]  To curb this epidemic of gun violence.
[00:36:12.665 --> 00:36:13.726]  Much more need be done.
[00:36:13.726 --> 00:36:20.051]  But the first, first, want to rein in the proliferation of so-called ghost guns.
[00:36:20.051 --> 00:36:21.973]  These are guns that are homemade.
[00:36:22.697 --> 00:36:26.698]  Built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm.
[00:36:26.698 --> 00:36:29.439]  You can go buy the kit.
[00:36:29.439 --> 00:36:36.101]  They have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can't be traced.
[00:36:36.101 --> 00:36:42.062]  And the buyers aren't required to pass a background check to buy the kit to make the gun.
[00:36:42.062 --> 00:36:48.944]  Consequently, anyone, anyone from a criminal to a terrorist can buy this kit
[00:36:49.634 --> 00:36:54.058]  As little as 30 minutes put together a weapon.
[00:36:54.058 --> 00:37:13.133]  You know, I want to see these kits treated as firearms under the Gun Control Act, which is going to require that the seller and manufacturers make the key parts with serial numbers and run background checks on the buyers when they walk in to buy that package.
[00:37:13.133 --> 00:37:14.334]  The second action we're going to take
[00:37:16.269 --> 00:37:25.935]  Back in the year 2000, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms released a report on its investigations of firearms trafficking in America.
[00:37:25.935 --> 00:37:27.836]  The report was of pivotal value.
[00:37:27.836 --> 00:37:39.263]  It was an important tool for policy makers when I was in the Senate and beyond, at all levels, to stop firearms from being illegally diverted into dangerous hands.
[00:37:39.263 --> 00:37:43.286]  Today, with online sales and ghost guns,
[00:37:44.059 --> 00:37:50.103]  Times and trafficking methods have changed and we have to adjust.
[00:37:50.103 --> 00:37:54.266]  We also have to ask the Justice Department to release a new annual report.
[00:37:54.266 --> 00:38:03.192]  This report will better help policy makers address firearms trafficking as it is today, not what it was yesterday.
[00:38:03.192 --> 00:38:11.077]  The third change, we want to treat pistols modified with stabilizing braces with the seriousness they deserve.
[00:38:11.957 --> 00:38:19.120]  A stabilizing brace hook and a pencil essentially makes that pistol a hell of a lot more accurate than a mini-rifle.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:25.642]  As a result, it's more lethal, effectively turning it into a short-barreled rifle.
[00:38:25.642 --> 00:38:28.363]  That's what the alleged shooter in Boulder appears to have done.
[00:38:28.363 --> 00:38:37.346]  I want to be clear that these modifications to firearms that make them more lethal should be subject to the National Firearms Act.
[00:38:38.297 --> 00:38:52.827]  The National Firearms Act requires that a potential owner pay a $200 fee and submit their name and other identifying information to the Justice Department, just as they would if they went out and purchased a silencer for a gun.
[00:38:52.827 --> 00:39:01.694]  Fourthly, during my campaign for President, I wanted to make it easier for states to adopt extreme risk protection order laws.
[00:39:02.526 --> 00:39:09.910]  They're also called Red Flag Laws, which everybody in this lawn knows, but many people listening do not know.
[00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:23.218]  These laws allow a police or family member to petition a court in their jurisdiction and say, I want you to temporarily remove from the following people any firearm they may possess.
[00:39:24.617 --> 00:39:26.418]  Because they're a danger and a crisis.
[00:39:26.418 --> 00:39:28.080]  They're presenting a danger to themselves.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.661]  This is an absolute nightmare.
[00:39:29.661 --> 00:39:33.623]  It's even worse than they had telegraphed they were going to do in the last week, of course.
[00:39:33.623 --> 00:39:34.644]  This is just incredible.
[00:39:34.644 --> 00:39:38.827]  It's why they're suing and trying to criminalize the NRA.
[00:39:38.827 --> 00:39:44.391]  It's why they've sued Remington out of existence, the same group suing me, coming after your First Amendment as well.
[00:39:44.391 --> 00:39:46.613]  We just want to silence everybody.
[00:39:46.613 --> 00:39:48.174]  And did you just hear that?
[00:39:48.174 --> 00:39:49.615]  We'll come back with the red flag laws.
[00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:52.229]  And what he's getting into.
[00:39:52.229 --> 00:40:00.052]  If a family member or someone else just says, I think this person shouldn't have guns, they come and take your guns, then good luck getting them back.
[00:40:00.052 --> 00:40:06.034]  Most people I know that have had this done to them, like Laura Loomer, done nothing wrong, can't get their gun back, because it's extra judiciary.
[00:40:06.034 --> 00:40:08.175]  It's just done.
[00:40:08.175 --> 00:40:10.176]  Like rendition or something with the CIA.
[00:40:10.176 --> 00:40:11.436]  They just do it.
[00:40:11.436 --> 00:40:12.237]  Outside of law.
[00:40:12.237 --> 00:40:14.438]  This is Napoleonic.
[00:40:14.438 --> 00:40:15.438]  This is authoritarian.
[00:40:15.438 --> 00:40:19.820]  And in that big bombshell, we're going to claim you're under the Firearms Act like a suppressor,
[00:40:21.204 --> 00:40:28.066]  Be called a silencer or a full auto if your pistol has anything attached to it.
[00:40:29.648 --> 00:40:33.249]  And of course, there's so many guns that they're calling short-barrel rifles under that.
[00:40:33.249 --> 00:40:36.731]  So, this is a declaration of war against the Second Amendment.
[00:40:36.731 --> 00:40:43.333]  It's a declaration of war against our country, and it's what you'd expect from a CHICOM agent busy breaking the very existence of this country.
[00:40:43.333 --> 00:40:48.015]  And then, of course, you've got him talking about smuggling guns when he and Obama are the biggest gun smugglers in U.S.
[00:40:48.015 --> 00:40:48.615]  history.
[00:40:48.615 --> 00:40:51.836]  Two Mexico, two Al-Qaeda, and ISIS on record!
[00:40:51.836 --> 00:40:53.717]  My God, this is insane!
[00:40:53.717 --> 00:40:54.357]  We'll be right back.
[00:40:54.357 --> 00:40:54.777]  Stay with us.

[00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:38.240]  The supply chains are breaking down.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.420]  We tried to put it in a bigger order.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:44.482]  We couldn't even get it, because getting high quality ingredients is very, very hard, and we're not going to cut corners.
[00:41:44.482 --> 00:41:46.462]  We're going to keep the quality at the highest levels.

[00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:58.831]  Gerald of South Carolina.
[00:41:58.831 --> 00:41:59.571]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:00.332]  Trying to move quicker.
[00:42:00.332 --> 00:42:01.152]  Hey, Alex.
[00:42:01.152 --> 00:42:01.593]  Welcome.
[00:42:01.593 --> 00:42:06.755]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[00:42:06.755 --> 00:42:10.137]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[00:42:10.137 --> 00:42:16.601]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:18.262]  Living Defense saved my life.
[00:42:18.262 --> 00:42:22.404]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[00:42:22.404 --> 00:42:23.845]  Living Defense brought me back.
[00:42:24.125 --> 00:42:29.648]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[00:42:29.648 --> 00:42:30.469]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[00:42:30.469 --> 00:42:32.510]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[00:42:48.519 --> 00:42:56.070]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[00:43:08.084 --> 00:43:09.465]  I love your products.
[00:43:09.465 --> 00:43:20.173]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[00:43:20.173 --> 00:43:26.177]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[00:43:26.177 --> 00:43:27.238]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[00:43:29.459 --> 00:43:37.186]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[00:43:37.186 --> 00:43:45.953]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[00:43:45.953 --> 00:43:46.774]  This is working.
[00:43:46.774 --> 00:43:47.775]  This is wonderful.
[00:43:47.775 --> 00:43:52.299]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[00:43:52.299 --> 00:43:56.943]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[00:43:58.692 --> 00:44:01.073]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[00:44:01.073 --> 00:44:02.814]  It's very bittersweet.
[00:44:02.814 --> 00:44:05.816]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[00:44:05.816 --> 00:44:07.057]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[00:44:07.057 --> 00:44:07.977]  But I don't care about that.
[00:44:07.977 --> 00:44:10.018]  I care about beating the new world order.
[00:44:10.018 --> 00:44:14.741]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[00:44:14.741 --> 00:44:18.082]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[00:44:18.082 --> 00:44:19.603]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[00:44:19.603 --> 00:44:20.804]  But let's just say this.
[00:44:20.804 --> 00:44:22.125]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[00:44:22.125 --> 00:44:24.586]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[00:44:25.206 --> 00:44:28.848]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[00:44:28.848 --> 00:44:31.409]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[00:44:31.409 --> 00:44:34.610]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:35.450]  Do they fund freedom?
[00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:36.571]  No, a lot of them don't.
[00:44:36.571 --> 00:44:43.013]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:44.734]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[00:44:44.734 --> 00:44:47.575]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[00:44:48.155 --> 00:44:51.278]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[00:44:51.278 --> 00:45:00.806]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[00:45:00.806 --> 00:45:03.389]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:27.492]  You are tuned in to the most demonized, the most lied about broadcast in the world.
[00:45:27.492 --> 00:45:30.493]  And as much as I'm persecuted, I am not a victim.
[00:45:30.493 --> 00:45:35.855]  I am extremely honored and extremely blessed to be in this position and to have this amazing crew.
[00:45:35.855 --> 00:45:37.215]  But I'll tell you, it's a stressful job.
[00:45:37.215 --> 00:45:46.558]  So when you say a prayer for me or InfoWars, say it for the crew particularly, because they have to look at all this and know all this and understand this and know that we're not making any of this up.
[00:45:47.341 --> 00:45:57.810]  Because believe me, I used to even go, well, I know I'm telling the truth, but maybe the globalists are just acting powerful to scare their own people and they're not really going to carry out this world government depopulation plan.
[00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:04.256]  Well, now we know the little secret hopes that it wasn't as bad as we thought were wrong.
[00:46:04.256 --> 00:46:10.482]  And we can all pick up on the danger and pick up on the corruption and we're all upset.
[00:46:10.482 --> 00:46:12.684]  We have to be loving and we have to be nice to each other.
[00:46:13.735 --> 00:46:17.238]  So that we don't destroy each other because that's why the globalists want to destabilize us.
[00:46:17.238 --> 00:46:28.466]  I mean it's so evil the race baiting and the race division and the open demonization of white people is an inherently bad group by the globalists and by these big corporations.
[00:46:28.466 --> 00:46:35.691]  I'll talk about that more next hour and so much on the COVID takeover and so much on the world ID and we have Ted Nugent
[00:46:37.114 --> 00:46:42.517]  Joining us, he wants to talk about the smuggling at the border and that viral footage.
[00:46:42.517 --> 00:47:01.749]  I mean, I have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that anybody, because I don't care about getting the scoop, if Ben Shapiro wanted to go down to McAllen or if Tucker Carlson wanted to go down to McAllen, and he probably will, or anywhere, Ted Nugent says he wants to go with me down there.
[00:47:01.749 --> 00:47:02.609]  I'm going to take him down there.
[00:47:02.609 --> 00:47:03.330]  He's a fellow Texan.
[00:47:07.563 --> 00:47:11.485]  You'll sit there for 30 minutes and you'll see kids getting crammed in trunks, okay?
[00:47:11.485 --> 00:47:16.888]  I mean, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit smugglers down there.
[00:47:16.888 --> 00:47:23.671]  And so that's what's so insulting about the left going, Oh, um, Jones made this up.
[00:47:23.671 --> 00:47:23.931]  Wow.
[00:47:23.931 --> 00:47:25.972]  Why would he have cameras and just catch this?
[00:47:25.972 --> 00:47:29.434]  Gee, cause that's what I do.
[00:47:29.434 --> 00:47:32.075]  They all leave with manila envelopes in hand.
[00:47:33.127 --> 00:47:48.912]  Those that do test positive for COVID are driven to one of the several hotels who have contracted with the federal government to act as COVID quarantine shelters, where they will quarantine for seven days before being released into the U.S.
[00:47:48.912 --> 00:48:02.357]  And the rest are either bused or walked down the street to the Humanitarian Respite Center, operated by Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, where they are brought in through the front door with their manila envelopes inspected
[00:48:03.254 --> 00:48:10.299]  They are housed, given bags of clothing, and are then sent off through the back door to various U.S.
[00:48:10.299 --> 00:48:12.961]  cities via bus and airplane.
[00:48:12.961 --> 00:48:14.942]  It's a non-stop flowing pipeline.
[00:48:16.022 --> 00:48:30.114]  Those that take the bus are led across the street to the bus station and the rest are given rides to the airport where they present Border Patrol and TSA with the paperwork inside their Manila envelopes and set off to various U.S.
[00:48:30.114 --> 00:48:39.623]  cities where they are either meeting up with some other government agency, NGO, or perhaps even Mexican cartels operating within the U.S.
[00:48:40.772 --> 00:48:44.636]  It is the biggest illegal immigration smuggling operation in U.S.
[00:48:44.636 --> 00:48:45.857]  history.
[00:48:45.857 --> 00:48:57.206]  And it is being run by the federal government on behalf of the United Nations to destroy all American liberties and put us under the boot for a thousand years.
[00:48:57.206 --> 00:48:59.268]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:49:04.921 --> 00:49:11.082]  Well, as we said, you know what, since we just played that, let's play that full Gregory's Report with audio all the way up.
[00:49:11.082 --> 00:49:12.783]  Let's do that for folks right now.
[00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:15.604]  Let's just do that for people.
[00:49:15.604 --> 00:49:20.665]  Here's that report for people denying that this is even going on, denying that this is even happening.
[00:49:20.665 --> 00:49:25.666]  Here's the report from last week when the other crew was down at the border.
[00:49:25.666 --> 00:49:25.946]  Here it is.
[00:49:30.962 --> 00:49:42.692]  The mainstream media has been talking about a surge at the border, but the real story is a massive illegal immigration pipeline run by the Biden administration.
[00:49:42.692 --> 00:49:47.316]  We witnessed it running nonstop in McAllen, Texas.
[00:49:47.316 --> 00:49:56.924]  First, Border Patrol delivers busloads of illegal immigrants to a secured tent processing center on the corner of US Business 83 and West 15th Street.
[00:49:59.995 --> 00:50:05.479]  We are told by sources well over a thousand each night in this area alone.
[00:50:05.479 --> 00:50:10.683]  And what we witnessed during the day certainly substantiates this number.
[00:50:10.683 --> 00:50:18.970]  We were told by a driver of their operation that they are being tested for COVID-19 at this processing center.
[00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:21.632]  They all leave with manila envelopes in hand.
[00:50:22.666 --> 00:50:38.431]  Those that do test positive for COVID are driven to one of the several hotels who have contracted with the federal government to act as COVID quarantine shelters, where they will quarantine for seven days before being released into the U.S.
[00:50:38.431 --> 00:50:51.896]  And the rest are either bused or walked down the street to the Humanitarian Respite Center, operated by Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, where they are brought in through the front door with their manila envelopes inspected
[00:50:52.794 --> 00:50:59.820]  They are housed, given bags of clothing, and are then sent off through the back door to various U.S.
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:02.502]  cities via bus and airplane.
[00:51:02.502 --> 00:51:04.484]  It's a non-stop flowing pipeline.
[00:51:05.561 --> 00:51:09.605]  Those that take the bus are led across the street to the bus station.
[00:51:09.605 --> 00:51:19.633]  And the rest are given rides to the airport, where they present Border Patrol and TSA with the paperwork inside their Manila envelopes, and set off to various U.S.
[00:51:19.633 --> 00:51:29.162]  cities, where they are either meeting up with some other government agency, NGO, or perhaps even Mexican cartels operating within the U.S.
[00:51:30.311 --> 00:51:34.173]  It is the biggest illegal immigration smuggling operation in U.S.
[00:51:34.173 --> 00:51:35.393]  history.
[00:51:35.393 --> 00:51:46.719]  And it is being run by the federal government on behalf of the United Nations to destroy all American liberties and put us under the boot for a thousand years.
[00:51:46.719 --> 00:51:50.340]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.061]  So, I'm almost scared.
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:52:10.630]  To go back to Biden, he's since completed his speech, and they've got the Attorney General, the anti-American communist globalist up there, Garland, and he's got this rabid, crazy ATF guy that said the Davidians shot down two helicopters in Waco, and that's why they assaulted the Davidians and burned it up.
[00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:12.591]  No helicopters were shot.
[00:52:12.591 --> 00:52:13.712]  It's just totally made up.
[00:52:13.712 --> 00:52:15.093]  No helicopters were there on the first day.
[00:52:15.093 --> 00:52:17.174]  It's just total lies.
[00:52:17.174 --> 00:52:20.376]  He says that gun owners should not be allowed to have guns, period.
[00:52:20.376 --> 00:52:21.617]  You should have a deadbolt.
[00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:23.020]  I don't know.
[00:52:40.706 --> 00:52:43.268]  There is no border crisis and things have gotten better.
[00:52:43.268 --> 00:52:45.770]  Not only is there not a crisis, things have gotten better.
[00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:47.711]  And see, people go, oh, Pelosi's an idiot.
[00:52:47.711 --> 00:52:48.452]  No, she's not.
[00:52:48.452 --> 00:52:51.554]  Republicans will now debate that it's not better.
[00:52:51.554 --> 00:52:52.555]  She changed the subject.
[00:52:52.555 --> 00:53:02.142]  Instead of totally illegal, he told them to surge the border, giant human trafficking, out of control, governors must act, Congress must act, local law enforcement must act.
[00:53:02.142 --> 00:53:05.545]  You know, an FBI agent doesn't have federal immunity if he wants to rape a kid in a park.
[00:53:06.025 --> 00:53:08.948]  Well, how can Biden sit there and commit all these crimes and do this?
[00:53:08.948 --> 00:53:10.709]  He doesn't have the immunity.
[00:53:10.709 --> 00:53:15.413]  He doesn't have an executive order or even a law.
[00:53:15.413 --> 00:53:17.395]  Or a law or even an executive order.
[00:53:17.395 --> 00:53:19.016]  Because those would be overturned by court.
[00:53:19.016 --> 00:53:25.481]  And instead, we're now debating, because Pelosi pulled our chain, whether it's better or worse.
[00:53:25.481 --> 00:53:26.322]  It's so stupid.
[00:53:27.827 --> 00:53:29.448]  It's like your neighbor's house is on fire.
[00:53:29.448 --> 00:53:31.629]  Well, that looks like a new paint job's getting done.
[00:53:31.629 --> 00:53:44.117]  If your house was on fire, or your neighbor's house was on fire, and you said, call the fire department, we're on fire, and your wife or husband said, actually, that's just a painting crew, you'd go, you're schizophrenic, you'd call the police, or you'd call the fire department.
[00:53:44.117 --> 00:53:48.179]  You wouldn't have a debate about whether it was on fire with 20-foot flames shooting out.
[00:53:48.996 --> 00:53:50.998]  But Pelosi goes, oh, there's no fire!
[00:53:50.998 --> 00:53:52.540]  It's actually getting a new paint job!
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:53.421]  Everything's better!
[00:53:53.421 --> 00:53:54.462]  It's getting better!
[00:53:54.462 --> 00:53:57.426]  And so you go, it's not getting better, you liar!
[00:53:57.426 --> 00:53:58.487]  It's in a crisis!
[00:53:58.487 --> 00:54:02.331]  But she changes the subject to make you debate her with a lie.
[00:54:02.331 --> 00:54:07.497]  Instead of saying you're a lying scumbag and brushing her aside and putting her in prison.
[00:54:09.895 --> 00:54:14.659]  Alright, guys give me a printout of what Biden called for because I can't watch the rest of it.
[00:54:14.659 --> 00:54:20.363]  I know his speech is already over and that was so horrible what he said and it was so horrible what he did that I just need to get it.
[00:54:20.985 --> 00:54:23.027]  I mean, it was a red flag clause.
[00:54:23.027 --> 00:54:25.588]  Anybody says something about you, they come and take your guns.
[00:54:25.588 --> 00:54:28.070]  That's the extreme version of red flag clause.
[00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:33.074]  Any modification on your gun, now you've got an ATF stamp.
[00:54:33.074 --> 00:54:35.876]  Assault and attack all the gun shops and gun stores.
[00:54:35.876 --> 00:54:41.419]  Go after anybody that ever bought a ghost parts, or even having the plans to be able to build a firearm is illegal.
[00:54:41.419 --> 00:54:42.740]  Attacks on free speech.
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.903]  I mean, just a frickin' nightmare, and we only watch part of it.
[00:54:45.903 --> 00:54:47.544]  I haven't been able to watch the rest of it.
[00:54:47.544 --> 00:54:49.305]  It's made me so angry, I'm about to have a heart attack.
[00:54:49.989 --> 00:55:06.204]  To be run by this chi-com that stole the damn country, and the Republicans are still debating whether they stole it, or debating whether we're under attack, or debating whether the border is open, or debating whether they're letting China take over Hong Kong and Taiwan, and now they're at the same time, we're starting a war with the Russians!
[00:55:09.125 --> 00:55:11.746]  I need to be funded, by the way, and we got products you need.
[00:55:11.746 --> 00:55:14.548]  Wintersun, that every adult and child needs.

[00:55:34.289 --> 00:55:35.150]  Dot com.
[00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:37.192]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:55:37.192 --> 00:55:39.994]  And all you see is action and delivery from us.
[00:55:39.994 --> 00:55:43.697]  All you see is taking action and kicking globalist ass.
[00:55:43.697 --> 00:55:47.881]  And it's pathetic we have this gigantic audience but can't find ourselves.
[00:55:47.881 --> 00:55:50.703]  The equation is very simple.
[00:55:50.703 --> 00:55:52.365]  The mega banks control the media.
[00:55:52.365 --> 00:55:54.327]  They control big pharma.
[00:55:54.327 --> 00:55:56.889]  They control academia.
[00:55:56.889 --> 00:55:59.291]  They control the military, industrial complex.
[00:55:59.291 --> 00:56:00.092]  They control big tech.
[00:56:01.417 --> 00:56:10.521]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[00:56:10.521 --> 00:56:19.006]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[00:56:19.006 --> 00:56:25.729]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down, and use
[00:56:26.609 --> 00:56:34.691]  The idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:39.192]  That's why they target InfoWars, because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[00:56:39.192 --> 00:56:44.553]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote InfoWars at Band.Video.
[00:56:44.553 --> 00:56:45.534]  So redouble your efforts.
[00:56:45.534 --> 00:56:46.574]  We're all in this together.
[00:56:48.357 --> 00:56:52.198]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[00:56:52.198 --> 00:56:56.519]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[00:56:56.519 --> 00:57:04.702]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:05.382 --> 00:57:21.996]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[00:57:21.996 --> 00:57:33.045]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[00:57:33.525 --> 00:57:42.008]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[00:57:42.008 --> 00:57:51.792]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:51.792 --> 00:57:54.433]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:08.006 --> 00:58:09.126]  Big Brother.
[00:58:09.126 --> 00:58:10.926]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:10.926 --> 00:58:12.787]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:12.787 --> 00:58:14.507]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:58:14.507 --> 00:58:16.168]  Well, so does he.
[00:58:16.168 --> 00:58:20.869]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:58:22.617 --> 00:58:28.981]  It's not actually self-evident that China will absolutely, certainly rule this century, dominate this century.
[00:58:28.981 --> 00:58:31.442]  I think there's a good possibility that it will.
[00:58:31.442 --> 00:58:34.964]  China created more billionaires than all other billionaires combined last year.
[00:58:34.964 --> 00:58:36.545]  China took over the planet.
[00:58:36.545 --> 00:58:36.885]  China!
[00:58:37.538 --> 00:58:39.078]  Quadrupled its Belton Road.
[00:58:39.078 --> 00:58:44.259]  First it had doubled it, but now it's highways and it's trains into Europe.
[00:58:44.259 --> 00:58:46.920]  We are in cardiac arrest.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.581]  And all these idiots are virtue signaling, wearing their little mask.
[00:58:50.581 --> 00:58:59.423]  And Biden's now petitioning the governors to never take the damn mask off because it's a symbol of the death shroud over our face forever.
[00:58:59.423 --> 00:59:05.824]  I'm reiterating my call for every governor, mayor, and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mask mandate.
[00:59:06.801 --> 00:59:10.263]  Please, this is not politics.
[00:59:10.263 --> 00:59:13.205]  Reinstate the mandate if you let it down.
[00:59:13.205 --> 00:59:17.447]  They want to wage war on independent businesses, on small businesses, on independent media.
[00:59:17.447 --> 00:59:18.808]  It's a war on the people.
[00:59:18.808 --> 00:59:23.251]  It's a war on freedom, because you can't have an America left when the rest of the world is under tyranny.
[00:59:23.251 --> 00:59:26.232]  And you can't have Infowars on the air if you're going to sell this tyranny.
[00:59:26.232 --> 00:59:27.433]  You're going to gaslight people.
[00:59:27.433 --> 00:59:29.914]  That's why we've got to keep Infowars on the air!
[00:59:29.914 --> 00:59:34.317]  This is all a concerted UN global government Bill & Melinda Gates Chi-Com plan.
[00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:38.135]  It's all exactly choreographed, laid out, planned.
[00:59:38.135 --> 00:59:52.294]  On behalf of our center and our partners, the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, I'd like to extend a very warm welcome to our audience here in New York, as well as our larger virtual audience participating online today.
[00:59:53.669 --> 01:00:05.215]  The goal of the event 201 exercise is to illustrate the potential consequences of a pandemic and the kinds of societal and economic challenges it would pose.
[01:00:05.215 --> 01:00:15.161]  I told you back last year, before Xi Jinping even announced it, that Communist China was
[01:00:16.093 --> 01:00:26.473]  Going to be at the heart of the global social credit score through QR codes for you to leave your house, buy or sell, get on a train, a plane, have a job, get on an airplane, you name it.
[01:00:27.387 --> 01:00:31.172]  And then Xi Jinping a few months later came out and said yes he's running it with the UN.
[01:00:31.172 --> 01:00:37.759]  It is now official that the UN is preparing China to run the global QR system.
[01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:41.123]  Oh and don't worry that way they're all standardized and we're all safe.
[01:00:41.123 --> 01:00:46.410]  So you're gonna have internal passports worldwide dictated by the UN and the Communist Chinese.
[01:00:47.449 --> 01:00:48.830]  Data firm head.
[01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:52.814]  China has asked who to let it run global vaccine passport system.
[01:00:52.814 --> 01:00:53.895]  Kind of like the U.S.
[01:00:53.895 --> 01:00:55.617]  created the internet so we ran ICANN.
[01:00:55.617 --> 01:00:57.338]  Now that's been given to the U.N.
[01:00:57.338 --> 01:00:57.839]  Well, the U.N.
[01:00:57.839 --> 01:00:59.340]  is in control of this.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.801]  Bill Gates is in control of the U.N.
[01:01:00.801 --> 01:01:03.484]  And now they're going to have China administer it.
[01:01:03.484 --> 01:01:04.845]  You think, oh, that'll never happen.
[01:01:04.845 --> 01:01:05.426]  Oh, really?
[01:01:05.426 --> 01:01:07.828]  Remember three years ago, I made a big deal about it.
[01:01:07.828 --> 01:01:11.992]  And that's when Tim Cook said Jones must be the platform now.
[01:01:11.992 --> 01:01:13.253]  Reuters had an article saying
[01:01:14.108 --> 01:01:18.090]  Chinese intelligence runs Apple and the executive said that's what happens when you're in China.
[01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:22.473]  They now officially have moved there to have tax exemption completely on corporate income tax.
[01:01:22.473 --> 01:01:27.676]  So Apple's new base is not Seattle, Washington or Silicon Valley in California.
[01:01:27.676 --> 01:01:29.177]  It is Beijing.
[01:01:29.177 --> 01:01:30.377]  It is Peking.
[01:01:30.377 --> 01:01:32.359]  It is Communist China.
[01:01:32.359 --> 01:01:35.721]  Apple's data shows deep independence on China as Trump tariffs loom.
[01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:39.823]  And they say in there that the code keys to every laptop, every desktop, every phone
[01:01:40.814 --> 01:01:42.714]  Are held by the CCP.
[01:01:42.714 --> 01:01:44.655]  And the article says it's no big deal.
[01:01:44.655 --> 01:01:47.415]  And I was told, I was banned a week after that.
[01:01:47.415 --> 01:01:49.316]  And Tim Cook said this is incredible.
[01:01:49.316 --> 01:01:51.616]  Because I actually got that to Trump, the Reuters article.
[01:01:51.616 --> 01:01:54.457]  I got it to him through a Fox TV host.
[01:01:54.457 --> 01:01:55.377]  Boy, did they get pissed.
[01:01:55.377 --> 01:01:57.797]  That was the last straw.
[01:01:57.797 --> 01:02:03.959]  When Trump said, excuse me, Apple has codes in China to everybody's phones, including mine.
[01:02:03.959 --> 01:02:06.499]  He called Tim Cook on the phone, I was told.
[01:02:06.499 --> 01:02:10.340]  And Tim Cook went into a rage later.
[01:02:11.323 --> 01:02:14.224]  So, I've gotten pieces of it from every angle.
[01:02:14.224 --> 01:02:15.604]  So, it's just unbelievable.
[01:02:15.604 --> 01:02:18.345]  Yeah, there it is, the battle over Obama's internet surrender.
[01:02:18.345 --> 01:02:20.726]  That was the Wall Street Journal five years ago.
[01:02:20.726 --> 01:02:22.406]  There's the BBC reporting on what I'm telling you.
[01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:24.807]  So, I'm going to explain this again.
[01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:32.109]  Worldwide, last March, in every restaurant on the planet that was computerized, you went in, they said, no more menus, scan a QR code.
[01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:35.250]  That is to habituate you for the new global system, and it's a QR code.
[01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:39.391]  Then they're going to claim problems with that and demand a face scan, which they're now already announcing.
[01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:44.301]  So China will run a global database with the UN, controlling everywhere you go, what you do.
[01:02:44.301 --> 01:02:45.802]  Checkmate, we're taking over.
[01:02:45.802 --> 01:02:56.950]  And our Trojan Horse government, run by the FBI, the Justice Department, and all these lawyers that have sold us out, and Biden, are doing it now, with enjoyment.
[01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:59.011]  I knew Trump was embattled.
[01:02:59.011 --> 01:03:06.536]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy.
[01:03:06.536 --> 01:03:07.997]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:12.473]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[01:03:12.473 --> 01:03:15.956]  And I understand why people wanted to believe that, because this is scary what's going on.
[01:03:15.956 --> 01:03:21.580]  The global government, the new world order, and now that people woke up to the fact that that's real, they want somebody to come save them from it.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.562]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[01:03:23.562 --> 01:03:29.627]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled, depending on the drug, once Biden signed that executive order.
[01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:31.651]  We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[01:03:31.651 --> 01:03:35.254]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed.
[01:03:35.254 --> 01:03:38.397]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain.
[01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:39.598]  The energy cost and everything else.
[01:03:39.598 --> 01:03:50.807]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity.
[01:03:50.807 --> 01:03:52.269]  Because the fix is in, folks.
[01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:54.210]  The swamp is deep.
[01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:55.992]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:19.405]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:04:19.405 --> 01:04:26.031]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:26.031 --> 01:04:30.535]  It's now hour number two on this Thursday, April 8th, 2021 transmission.
[01:04:30.535 --> 01:04:31.596]  Blessed and honored to be here.
[01:04:31.596 --> 01:04:32.817]  I am your host.
[01:04:32.817 --> 01:04:34.418]  Thank you.
[01:04:34.418 --> 01:04:36.160]  All right, Ted Nugent.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.742]  He's really fired up and we look forward to having him on via Skype.
[01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:51.487]  In about 25 minutes from now, at the bottom of the hour, to get into the open borders, the gun grabbing, this could not be a better day to have him on as Biden just finished up what he's going to do.
[01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:57.051]  He was talking about stopping gun smuggling when he and Obama were the biggest gun smugglers ever with Fast and Furious.
[01:04:57.051 --> 01:05:02.955]  He talked about anybody with a little gun illegally going to federal prison, let's be a son of a hunter.
[01:05:02.955 --> 01:05:06.757]  The hypocrisy, the richness of this was just
[01:05:07.429 --> 01:05:08.450]  Two over the top.
[01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:14.616]  Not to mention all the bodyguards he's got, the bureaucrats have, the local government has.
[01:05:14.616 --> 01:05:20.621]  But his new nominee for ATF says no one should have guns, you should have deadbolts.
[01:05:20.621 --> 01:05:21.482]  I've got the quotes.
[01:05:21.482 --> 01:05:27.668]  And he said the Davidians shot down two helicopters in Waco, and that's why they burned it down.
[01:05:27.668 --> 01:05:30.750]  That never happened.
[01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:32.232]  So that's the type of lying criminal.
[01:05:32.836 --> 01:05:33.357]  We're good to go.
[01:05:47.575 --> 01:05:48.996]  And take your guns.
[01:05:48.996 --> 01:05:57.259]  Semi-autos, any modification, any parts you've bought over the years, put together, they say that they are taking it all.
[01:05:57.259 --> 01:06:03.841]  So, really, the big news is the Chi-Coms are trying to cause a civil war, knowing that this will trigger a civil war.
[01:06:03.841 --> 01:06:09.303]  And a bloodbath for everybody, which I'm not looking forward to, which I do not want, but nevertheless is a fact.
[01:06:09.303 --> 01:06:10.164]  So, there you go.
[01:06:10.164 --> 01:06:11.464]  That's what's going on there.
[01:06:11.464 --> 01:06:13.745]  Everybody else in the debate, oh, he wants to save children.
[01:06:14.648 --> 01:06:21.151]  No, they shipped two million guns to Al-Qaeda and ISIS under he and Obama.
[01:06:21.151 --> 01:06:28.495]  It'd be like if a guy had been convicted for raping a hundred kids and then he was given speeches about how we need to arrest people with child porn.
[01:06:28.495 --> 01:06:32.137]  You're like, okay, we do need to do that, but you're not the one to be the spokesperson.
[01:06:32.137 --> 01:06:33.978]  My God, this is ridiculous!
[01:06:33.978 --> 01:06:36.139]  But no one ever heads them off with what they've done.
[01:06:36.139 --> 01:06:40.281]  There's not a word from Republicans about him in Fast and Furious or Obama.
[01:06:40.281 --> 01:06:41.762]  That's kryptonite to these turkeys!
[01:06:45.311 --> 01:06:53.258]  Or Biden sowing racial division when he helped pass the laws to give black people three times longer sentences than white people.
[01:06:53.258 --> 01:06:59.623]  Trump repeals it and he's the racist!
[01:06:59.623 --> 01:07:01.364]  I mean, it's just too much.
[01:07:01.364 --> 01:07:06.068]  It almost made me go crazy.
[01:07:06.068 --> 01:07:08.030]  And of course, the red flag laws.
[01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:12.033]  You know, Trump was like, oh, red flag means if you've been adjudicated mentally ill and you're a schizophrenic,
[01:07:12.668 --> 01:07:21.735]  And you were, you know, kicked out of the Air Force was the case they brought to him, but he, they never put the Air Force records in that he was dishonorably discharged in an Air Force mental institution for two years.
[01:07:21.735 --> 01:07:23.736]  Trump's like, yeah, that guy shouldn't have a gun.
[01:07:23.736 --> 01:07:26.578]  Oh, the conservatives, Trump wants to, no, no, no.
[01:07:26.578 --> 01:07:26.758]  Okay.
[01:07:26.758 --> 01:07:27.439]  Well, Trump's gone.
[01:07:27.439 --> 01:07:29.640]  Let's not, bad guy's gone.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.881]  Don't have him to kick anymore.
[01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:35.044]  We got Biden saying, if anybody has a concern about you, your guns are gone.
[01:07:35.044 --> 01:07:36.285]  You don't get them back most of the time.
[01:07:37.446 --> 01:07:39.607]  And you get the SWAT team raid that ensues.
[01:07:39.607 --> 01:07:41.788]  So, Civil War, Civil War, Civil War.
[01:07:41.788 --> 01:07:48.751]  Oh, and... It just gets worse from there.
[01:07:48.751 --> 01:07:58.695]  But let me hit the really big news ahead of Ted Nugent joining us, because we'll get back into all this when Ted Nugent joins us coming up here in about 22 minutes from now.
[01:07:58.695 --> 01:08:00.516]  Let's look at this.
[01:08:00.516 --> 01:08:01.336]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:08:02.897 --> 01:08:10.159]  Again, we are a radio show simulcast on TV, so that's why a lot of us radio listeners, people call the stages, they say, he's talking about, look at this, look at that.
[01:08:10.159 --> 01:08:16.141]  I shoot around people every segment that we are, simulcast, radio, on TV.
[01:08:16.141 --> 01:08:18.742]  All right, let's get into it.
[01:08:18.742 --> 01:08:19.703]  AP, U.S.
[01:08:19.703 --> 01:08:25.184]  military cites rising risk of Chinese move against Taiwan.
[01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:25.925]  Oh, really?
[01:08:25.925 --> 01:08:26.705]  Rising risk?
[01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:37.973]  Over a hundred large ships, including an aircraft carrier, over a thousand small ships in a, that's called a flotilla, have encircled Taiwan.
[01:08:37.973 --> 01:08:40.734]  That's called a blockade.
[01:08:40.734 --> 01:08:44.755]  They're now starting blockade drills of Philippine islands, too.
[01:08:44.755 --> 01:08:46.975]  Philippines calls it an act of war.
[01:08:46.975 --> 01:08:49.436]  That's how wars start, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:52.262 --> 01:09:00.403]  Biden's weakness allows China to surround Taiwan with air and sea exercises.
[01:09:00.403 --> 01:09:04.944]  Crazy Nancy, though, says our border situation has improved and everything's fine.
[01:09:04.944 --> 01:09:07.905]  Just remember, while we're collapsing, they're expanding.
[01:09:07.905 --> 01:09:14.486]  JPMorgan's CEO admits something has gone terribly wrong in America and China knows it.
[01:09:14.486 --> 01:09:20.067]  Big article where JPMorgan is signaling basically the end of America.
[01:09:22.008 --> 01:09:24.630]  Because they're heavily invested in China.
[01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:42.382]  Russia says it will keep forces near Ukraine, touts possible measures as Biden sends in heavy tanks, heavy artillery, medium artillery, light artillery, and anti-tank missiles, as well as supplying
[01:09:43.659 --> 01:09:45.140]  Attack helicopters.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.621]  I've talked to people on the ground.
[01:09:46.621 --> 01:09:48.362]  Yes, you heard me right.
[01:09:48.362 --> 01:09:54.125]  Biden has been supplying European attack helicopters that he just paid for to the Ukrainians.
[01:09:54.125 --> 01:09:57.767]  What could go wrong?
[01:09:57.767 --> 01:10:00.069]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:00.069 --> 01:10:02.430]  This is escalating very, very fast.
[01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:03.671]  That's Reuters.
[01:10:03.671 --> 01:10:08.454]  Merkel joins diplomacy rush to avert Ukrainian military misstep.
[01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:08.954]  Think so?
[01:10:08.954 --> 01:10:10.135]  That's in Bloomberg.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.161]  Well, she's telling Biden to stop it.
[01:10:13.161 --> 01:10:16.102]  I mean, this is how world wars start.
[01:10:16.102 --> 01:10:20.743]  By the way, Russia started 500 years ago in Eastern Ukraine.
[01:10:20.743 --> 01:10:22.344]  That's where the Russians come from.
[01:10:22.344 --> 01:10:24.864]  That's where they started.
[01:10:24.864 --> 01:10:28.326]  And they were basically Europeans that were going west.
[01:10:28.326 --> 01:10:33.747]  The Vikings actually started a thousand years ago, the first settlements that are in Russia today.
[01:10:33.747 --> 01:10:36.908]  But 500 years ago, it got official and started getting czars.
[01:10:36.908 --> 01:10:38.469]  It all started in Ukraine.
[01:10:38.469 --> 01:10:39.049]  So it'd be like
[01:10:40.234 --> 01:10:47.058]  It'd be like if the Russians were invading Boston, or New York, or Virginia.
[01:10:47.058 --> 01:10:50.760]  It'd be like, hey, that's not yours, Russians.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.621]  Oh yeah, this is ours.
[01:10:52.621 --> 01:10:54.883]  Now, is the West of Ukraine Catholic?
[01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:57.584]  Abso-frickin-lutely, and it's more alive with the Germans and the Poles.
[01:10:57.584 --> 01:10:58.344]  Always has been.
[01:10:58.344 --> 01:10:59.745]  They've had a bunch of wars there.
[01:10:59.745 --> 01:11:04.728]  In fact, more than 10 wars have started there for the last 500 years.
[01:11:04.728 --> 01:11:07.770]  In fact, most of the European Continental Wars start there.
[01:11:10.554 --> 01:11:14.457]  So, history is repeating itself again in a nightmare pitch.
[01:11:14.457 --> 01:11:20.460]  Napoleon went to Russia to be defeated, Hitler went to Russia to be defeated, and it's happening yet again.
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:24.523]  History does repeat, my friends.
[01:11:24.523 --> 01:11:36.750]  Here's what's sparking tension between Russia and the Ukraine, Bloomberg, and the U.S.-backed systems have been busy grabbing up the pipelines and infrastructure and sending troops
[01:11:38.092 --> 01:11:41.234]  Into Eastern Ukraine that is 90% Russian and starting a fight.
[01:11:41.234 --> 01:11:43.255]  I mean, what could go wrong?
[01:11:43.255 --> 01:11:46.737]  Again, if Russians were landing in Boston, what do you- we'd kick their ass.
[01:11:46.737 --> 01:11:49.799]  Because they're not supposed to be here doing that.
[01:11:49.799 --> 01:11:51.280]  This is outrageous.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:12:03.127]  And the same folks that blew up Serbia and turned it over to the Muslims, a third of it, the same people that did all of that are doing it again while they implode our borders and while they take our guns.
[01:12:06.343 --> 01:12:09.004]  And is anybody the good guy in Ukraine?
[01:12:09.004 --> 01:12:12.505]  They've been killing each other for so long, Eastern and Western Ukraine.
[01:12:12.505 --> 01:12:18.106]  It's like the Hathcocks and McCoys.
[01:12:18.106 --> 01:12:19.046]  It's just what's been going on.
[01:12:19.046 --> 01:12:20.907]  It's like the Bloods and the Crips, folks.
[01:12:20.907 --> 01:12:23.148]  And we shouldn't be in the middle of it.
[01:12:23.148 --> 01:12:28.549]  But instead, it'd be one thing if the Bloods and Crips were killing each other on the line of their neighborhoods in South Central.
[01:12:29.289 --> 01:12:30.350]  He'd say, stop the gang war.
[01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:45.500]  No, no, this is the Bloods going over to the Crips territory, to use that analogy, and pushing them, well, I guess the Globalists or the Blues, so that'd be like, that'd be the Blues going into the Bloods territory and pushing them all the way out of their territory.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:49.643]  What you're going to get is a war.
[01:12:49.643 --> 01:12:55.087]  And I guess it fits, too, because I guess the Russians are the Reds, even though they're not commies anymore.
[01:12:55.087 --> 01:12:56.808]  So just always backdrop that.
[01:12:59.358 --> 01:13:12.564]  That China's open for business, we're not open for business, we're falling apart, our country's being destroyed, our dollar's being destroyed, and O'Biden is starting a fight with the Russians.
[01:13:12.564 --> 01:13:18.287]  Putin accuses Ukraine of provocations in phone call with Merkel.
[01:13:18.287 --> 01:13:20.167]  It just goes on and on.
[01:13:20.167 --> 01:13:26.690]  But don't worry, 400 people have been charged at the Capitol, over 200 for quote, meandering in the Capitol.
[01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:27.951]  Just being there, they're being charged.
[01:13:29.668 --> 01:13:35.394]  And facing seven years in prison, they're trying to charge him with terrorism and sedition with sixty minutes, like, salivating.
[01:13:35.394 --> 01:13:39.198]  Oh God, Americans, we could imprison them and have power over them.
[01:13:39.198 --> 01:13:44.464]  The globalists are so busy trying to dominate America when they already run it, that they're running it in the ground and the globalists are laughing at us.
[01:13:45.595 --> 01:13:50.521]  All right, we got the huge, huge, huge COVID news.
[01:13:50.521 --> 01:13:54.286]  We're now censoring Governor DeSantis on the other side.
[01:14:02.356 --> 01:14:10.238]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[01:14:10.238 --> 01:14:13.299]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[01:14:13.299 --> 01:14:21.561]  So whether you have domains, or want to register a domain, or want help building a website, or want servers, or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:39.701]  And if you go to InfoWarsDomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the InfoWars and we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them.
[01:14:39.921 --> 01:14:46.729]  So it's a win-win as we build a true, open, free internet again, because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:51.174]  So, InfoWarsDomains.com, the revolution starts there.

[01:15:36.385 --> 01:15:41.429]  We couldn't even get it because getting high-quality ingredients is very, very hard, and we're not going to cut corners.

[01:15:48.475 --> 01:15:49.897]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:16:08.488 --> 01:16:35.400]  The beast in me Is caged by frail and fragile bars Restless by day and by night Rants and rages at the start God help
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:39.202]  The beast in me.
[01:16:39.202 --> 01:16:40.784]  The beast in me.
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:17:06.223]  You have to understand that the illegal aliens being brought to this country are trying to escape collapsing nations, and that the globalists did orchestrate the lockdown, and their country's even stronger for the IMF and World Bank to control those countries with an iron grip, and that we're going under the same iron grip now.
[01:17:06.223 --> 01:17:11.344]  We'll be where they are in five years or less, if this continues.
[01:17:11.344 --> 01:17:15.465]  And so they're being weaponized, they're being used, but it doesn't matter, they're still dangerous.
[01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:18.546]  And they'll still lower your wages, and they'll still bring crime waves with them,
[01:17:19.142 --> 01:17:22.706]  And they'll still ruin our future because they'll be a controlled client state.
[01:17:22.706 --> 01:17:23.907]  Look at this headline.
[01:17:23.907 --> 01:17:27.050]  Just went live on InfoWars.com.
[01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:33.317]  New York to give illegals who lost work during pandemic one-time payments of $15,600.
[01:17:33.317 --> 01:17:34.338]  That is a $217 billion budget.
[01:17:45.105 --> 01:17:46.545]  2.1 billion for illegal aliens.
[01:17:46.545 --> 01:17:48.706]  Now, citizens don't even get a third of that.
[01:17:48.706 --> 01:17:51.586]  Now, you're asking, why would they do that?
[01:17:51.586 --> 01:18:09.009]  Well, my God, what do you think they're going to do all over the world in Africa and Latin America and Asia and everywhere else in the Middle East when they hear, you don't just get a couple thousand dollar debit card, you don't just get free airplane tickets here, you don't just get to walk across and get put in a bus and go wherever you want, you don't just get welfare on the other side, you get $15,600!
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:22.524]  But you know, when you read about Austin, $4 million of taxpayer money was just passed last week.
[01:18:22.524 --> 01:18:30.908]  It was actually passed on Monday to pay illegal aliens legal bills when they're here.
[01:18:30.908 --> 01:18:35.251]  So that's just the big banks, everybody, exploiting this labor.
[01:18:35.251 --> 01:18:36.852]  And then you'll see our standard of living go down.
[01:18:36.852 --> 01:18:38.853]  What did Ross Perot say?
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:47.301]  In 1992, in those debates, when he was on 16 Minutes, he was also on CNN, Larry King Live, with Al Gore.
[01:18:47.301 --> 01:18:49.222]  He said, now listen here.
[01:18:49.222 --> 01:18:52.342]  Ten years ago, Canada got rid of its tariffs on us.
[01:18:52.342 --> 01:18:54.382]  They were paid an average of about $45 an hour.
[01:18:54.382 --> 01:18:56.623]  We're paid about $25 an hour in our factories.
[01:18:56.623 --> 01:18:59.863]  Now, within a couple of years, that came down to $25 an hour there in Canada.
[01:18:59.863 --> 01:19:01.804]  We were still $25 an hour.
[01:19:01.804 --> 01:19:05.404]  Before, the fact that it was competition was raising our wages and theirs as well.
[01:19:05.404 --> 01:19:08.085]  Well, in Mexico, they're paid about maybe a half dollar an hour.
[01:19:08.085 --> 01:19:09.085]  What's going to happen is, once you
[01:19:10.336 --> 01:19:15.200]  Send all the jobs down to Mexico, there's going to be a giant sucking sound, and then there won't even be factories or jobs here anymore.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:19.063]  So, this is a transference of power, getting rid of our wealth, getting rid of our middle class.
[01:19:19.063 --> 01:19:21.545]  This is designed to be done to take control of people.
[01:19:21.545 --> 01:19:24.187]  This is the politicians wanting dependent populations.
[01:19:24.187 --> 01:19:36.456]  And I guarantee you, in 20 years, we'll remember this, and we will not be a service economy they claim is going to be so great, because if you don't have jobs and factories and workers and farms and a diverse economy, there will not be money to be able to buy any of that in there.
[01:19:39.156 --> 01:19:42.619]  And of course, it was all 100% true, but Al Gore made fun of him.
[01:19:42.619 --> 01:19:46.662]  No, listen, Ross, you don't know anything.
[01:19:46.662 --> 01:19:48.864]  First world lifts everyone.
[01:19:48.864 --> 01:19:58.472]  Lowering us to third world lowers them even further and kills everybody, which is exactly what Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates want.
[01:19:58.472 --> 01:19:59.873]  And what did I say 14 months ago?
[01:19:59.873 --> 01:20:02.956]  I said, as they launch this lockdown, the third world will implode.
[01:20:02.956 --> 01:20:03.957]  They will all flood us.
[01:20:03.957 --> 01:20:05.298]  And now you got 10 times the flooding.
[01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:10.934]  It's all easy, because the globalists even tell you they're going to use migrant flows to take over.
[01:20:10.934 --> 01:20:14.037]  It's not like I even figured out 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:20:14.037 --> 01:20:17.140]  They show you 2 plus 2 equals 1984.
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:26.628]  They tell you what they're going to do.
[01:20:26.628 --> 01:20:32.093]  Now, why do you think the lowest COVID numbers for any big state in the country were in Florida?
[01:20:35.777 --> 01:20:51.826]  Because, eight months ago, DeSantis was getting state funding to pay for all his testing, and he said, why do we have hundreds of labs doing thousands of tests a piece, some hundreds a day, it was hundreds of thousands, and they're having some 100% positive rates?
[01:20:51.826 --> 01:20:52.347]  That's fake.
[01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:53.727]  They're doing that for more money.
[01:20:53.727 --> 01:20:59.671]  And they arrested a few people doing it, and everybody else quit doing the fake PCR crap.
[01:20:59.671 --> 01:21:02.593]  They'd set it the right way.
[01:21:02.593 --> 01:21:04.414]  Also, you're in the sun in Florida, you're getting D3.
[01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:08.591]  You go to Florida, everybody's so tan.
[01:21:08.591 --> 01:21:16.437]  So, long before the vaccines rolled out, they had almost no dastard problems.
[01:21:16.437 --> 01:21:17.758]  Well, guess how they handled that?
[01:21:17.758 --> 01:21:25.383]  Turns out back in March, he had a roundtable event that CBS News shot, CBS News, that had over 6 million views on it.
[01:21:25.942 --> 01:21:32.787]  Well, it turns out that video got picked up and was getting more popular, so YouTube deleted it and said, you don't agree with the UN.
[01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:52.701]  You're an elected governor that had a roundtable event at the Capitol with over 15 top scientists, some the best in the world, saying, herd immunity, unlock everything, you can't create a vaccine that protects you from the common cold, this is made up crap.
[01:21:52.701 --> 01:21:53.262]  Think about that.
[01:21:54.605 --> 01:21:56.006]  And what did YouTube do?
[01:21:56.006 --> 01:22:05.794]  By the way, we're posting, in the banned video section of Banned.Video, the most banned, we're posting the piece, because it was also on state TV.
[01:22:05.794 --> 01:22:08.176]  We're not going to copy the CBS piece that got deleted off YouTube.
[01:22:08.176 --> 01:22:11.038]  We're going to find the state piece so it's copyright free and put it up.
[01:22:11.038 --> 01:22:13.120]  I guess they already got it up.
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.101]  Man, I tell you, this crew is so damn fast.
[01:22:15.101 --> 01:22:17.343]  Governor DeSantis holds public health care roundtable.
[01:22:17.343 --> 01:22:18.184]  Wow, there it is.
[01:22:18.184 --> 01:22:23.148]  Guys, that's great, but just add, see the censored Governor DeSantis health roundtable.
[01:22:23.871 --> 01:22:28.432]  Because that's, that's, that's, people don't even care about it unless, uh, that was just put up a little while ago, unless we explain it.
[01:22:28.432 --> 01:22:30.072]  This is the way you're not supposed to say it.
[01:22:30.072 --> 01:22:34.513]  So, he, you can go read the article at InfoWars.com.
[01:22:34.513 --> 01:22:45.056]  YouTube removes roundtable video featuring Florida Governor DeSantis and Andy Lockdown, health expert, citing Terms of Service, and the Terms of Service says if it's not in agreement with the UN, you ain't doing it, Jack!
[01:22:46.471 --> 01:22:47.894]  Well, who runs the UN?
[01:22:47.894 --> 01:22:53.043]  I tried this this morning and it works.
[01:22:53.043 --> 01:22:53.964]  We'll see if they've changed it.
[01:22:53.964 --> 01:22:56.809]  Guys, please go to Google for TV viewers.
[01:22:56.809 --> 01:22:58.372]  Any radio listener can do this.
[01:22:58.372 --> 01:22:58.793]  Type in
[01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:01.872]  Who is the most powerful doctor in the world?
[01:23:01.872 --> 01:23:04.814]  Before you even say powerful, who is the most powerful?
[01:23:04.814 --> 01:23:06.175]  It says Bill Gates.
[01:23:06.175 --> 01:23:13.140]  And they say he is the most powerful doctor, he is in charge, and he will do what he will to you.
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:22.667]  He's literally a eugenicist globalist that bought off all the health departments, runs the UN, and he is not just a doctor, even though he's not a doctor, he is a rapist.
[01:23:22.667 --> 01:23:24.929]  He is a colonizer of your cells.
[01:23:24.929 --> 01:23:27.531]  He is taking your entire body over.
[01:23:28.743 --> 01:23:29.404]  There it is!
[01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:33.511]  Who's the most powerful doctor in the world, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:23:33.511 --> 01:23:35.434]  Bill!
[01:23:35.434 --> 01:23:39.942]  I'm gonna kill your ass, Bill Gates!
[01:23:39.942 --> 01:23:40.343]  Woo!
[01:23:41.821 --> 01:23:56.631]  Meet the world's most powerful doctor, and for four pages it says the same thing, because he paid in the search results to tell you, I am the Big Swingin' Johnson!
[01:23:56.631 --> 01:24:00.894]  I'm gonna put it in ya!
[01:24:00.894 --> 01:24:03.616]  He's literally raping everyone with GGP.
[01:24:04.821 --> 01:24:05.782]  So it's a double team.
[01:24:05.782 --> 01:24:26.143]  I don't mean to be gross here, but it's like, you got Gates, and you got Fauci, and you got Xi Jinping, and the New World Order, and the Rockefeller Foundation, and John Hopkins, and the UN, and they're literally got us chained up worse than being a slave in the fictitious Pulp Fiction.
[01:24:27.921 --> 01:24:30.082]  They're not just raping us where our rear end hurts, folks.
[01:24:30.082 --> 01:24:43.068]  They are gonna kill us with cancer, and kill us with steroids, and kill us with disorders, and Guillain-Barre, and just all of it, and narcolepsy, and they're just doing it, and just... And, oh, taxpayers will pay for those that get hurt.
[01:24:43.068 --> 01:24:43.989]  Whoo!
[01:24:43.989 --> 01:24:45.069]  There's your doctor.
[01:24:45.069 --> 01:24:47.170]  Dr. Bill Gates, baby!
[01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:48.151]  He's your doctor.
[01:24:48.151 --> 01:24:50.912]  He's gonna stick something in you, whether you like it or not.
[01:24:53.107 --> 01:25:07.112]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin.
[01:25:07.112 --> 01:25:09.113]  It's all now completely official.
[01:25:09.113 --> 01:25:13.935]  Part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and Klaus Schwab
[01:25:14.495 --> 01:25:19.461]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them.
[01:25:19.461 --> 01:25:21.803]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's here.
[01:25:21.803 --> 01:25:27.189]  And only gets worse, like being fed into a wood chipper, or a meat grinder, until you reject it all.
[01:25:29.003 --> 01:25:35.326]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle, good versus evil, and stopping abortion.
[01:25:35.326 --> 01:25:37.507]  We must start valuing human life again.
[01:25:37.507 --> 01:25:44.410]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:47.151]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[01:25:47.151 --> 01:25:50.553]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[01:25:54.694 --> 01:26:02.921]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[01:26:02.921 --> 01:26:08.967]  This experience, this life on this planet, is a reckoning.
[01:26:08.967 --> 01:26:17.854]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension, so we can decide where we want to spend eternity, and what level we want to go to.
[01:26:17.854 --> 01:26:19.096]  And it really does come down to that.
[01:26:20.277 --> 01:26:27.687]  As sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[01:26:27.687 --> 01:26:31.312]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[01:26:31.312 --> 01:26:33.555]  God is the author of us having free will.
[01:26:34.201 --> 01:26:34.641]  We're good to go.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.742]  Globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[01:26:56.742 --> 01:27:00.465]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine.
[01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:07.610]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our families' sakes, but also our community.

[01:28:17.476 --> 01:28:20.218]  Attacked and threatened.
[01:28:20.218 --> 01:28:21.699]  Because we are effective.
[01:28:21.699 --> 01:28:25.361]  The Great Awakening is here.

[01:28:50.377 --> 01:29:06.130]  InfoWars.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:06.130 --> 01:29:10.974]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:29:10.974 --> 01:29:12.676]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:29:12.676 --> 01:29:14.317]  Well, so does he.
[01:29:14.317 --> 01:29:19.021]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:29:22.452 --> 01:29:30.501]  Well, the one, the only Ted Nugent joins us at this critical time of the Republican stolen election.
[01:29:30.501 --> 01:29:36.247]  The ball was thrown down by Biden declaring he's going to bankrupt the gun manufacturers, he's going to confiscate the guns.
[01:29:36.247 --> 01:29:42.675]  He's going to declare red flag laws at a level never before seen and the borders are wide open.
[01:29:43.602 --> 01:29:50.966]  While Pelosi says the border's doing better than ever and Joe Biden's doing a great job, the Border Patrol says it's tenfold the previous record under Obama.
[01:29:50.966 --> 01:29:54.468]  This is an incredible time to be alive and I'm glad Ted Nugent is there.
[01:29:54.468 --> 01:29:58.170]  A Motor City madman and another great fellow Texan.
[01:29:58.170 --> 01:29:59.151]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[01:30:00.245 --> 01:30:01.145]  My pleasure, Alex.
[01:30:01.145 --> 01:30:03.506]  I'm celebrating life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:30:03.506 --> 01:30:05.287]  I've got my priorities.
[01:30:05.287 --> 01:30:08.408]  I think we should quote the greatest philosopher of all times.
[01:30:08.408 --> 01:30:12.990]  I think we agree, that was Dirty Harry, when he said, a good man knows his limitations.
[01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:24.475]  So as I fight against the curse of self-inflicted apathy and Marxism running amok, and whatever creature that is that pretends to be the commander-in-chief and all his crazy supporters,
[01:30:24.875 --> 01:30:47.124]  The Nugent family is living the American dream because we prioritize, we fight like hell, as we the people, daring to experiment in our self-government, and then we make great music, we plant gardens, we go hunting and fishing, we train our dogs, we have great campfires and a great open communication of heart and soul, so everybody make sure you don't get too depressed
[01:30:47.424 --> 01:30:50.808]  Because it's never been uglier, but a big salute to you!
[01:30:50.808 --> 01:30:57.355]  Because I gotta tell you, Alex, the Founding Fathers wanted everybody to be like Alex Jones and Ted Nugent, everybody I know.
[01:30:57.355 --> 01:31:05.104]  And that is to spotlight cockroaches and hold our elected employees to constitutional accountability.
[01:31:05.104 --> 01:31:06.506]  Boy, I'm radical, huh?
[01:31:07.481 --> 01:31:08.742]  No, you're simply being an American.
[01:31:08.742 --> 01:31:10.882]  You're 70-plus years old, look like you're about 60.
[01:31:10.882 --> 01:31:13.484]  You're certainly living the good, clean life.
[01:31:13.484 --> 01:31:14.124]  And I agree with you.
[01:31:14.124 --> 01:31:15.244]  They want to demoralize us.
[01:31:15.244 --> 01:31:16.365]  They want to break us.
[01:31:16.365 --> 01:31:19.466]  Because the world is turning against the left and against globalism.
[01:31:19.466 --> 01:31:24.268]  This is all their desperate battle of the bulls, like what Hitler was losing against us in Europe.
[01:31:24.268 --> 01:31:25.589]  He threw everything he had at us.
[01:31:25.589 --> 01:31:27.489]  It looked like we were losing for a couple weeks.
[01:31:27.489 --> 01:31:28.750]  But that was really the end of Hitler.
[01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:30.070]  I agree with you.
[01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:31.111]  We've got to keep our spirits up.
[01:31:32.478 --> 01:31:35.020]  Well, I gotta tell you, I got my son Rocco here next to me.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:38.643]  The Nugent family really cling to God, family, and country.
[01:31:38.643 --> 01:31:55.878]  And we have a nightly campfire here at the Nugent Ranch in Texas, and when we get back to Michigan, and Rocco and I were talking about, you know, there's elements and incidents and occurrences in our history where the Germans pretended that they didn't see the Jews being put on trains.
[01:31:56.298 --> 01:32:01.240]  And then they pretended they didn't see the smoke coming from Auschwitz.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:14.384]  And we are literally living the precursor, the threat of that kind of condition where people are being put in prison because they opened their diner in Michigan.
[01:32:14.384 --> 01:32:18.566]  And people are being tackled at banks in Texas.
[01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:22.107]  Elderly ladies, and I know what elderly looks like, I live it every day.
[01:32:22.107 --> 01:32:24.228]  Elderly ladies are tackled
[01:32:24.788 --> 01:32:43.952]  And handcuffed for not wearing a mask when I, your humble guitar player and bow hunting backstrapper, can tell you that every year throughout my life, when I wear a mask in Michigan to hide my glaring Caucasian glow from the deer that I want to get close to with my bow and arrow, guess what happens under my mask?
[01:32:44.412 --> 01:32:57.658]  My cold breath escapes the mask, but a woman in Texas, this is the most dire of indicators, Alex, that a Texan is tackled in a bank for not wearing a mask.
[01:32:57.658 --> 01:33:05.661]  We got to be very careful, but it's once again a manifestation of cultural deprivation, where we the people who know truth, logic, and common sense, and identify
[01:33:06.001 --> 01:33:13.429]  Let me ask you, now that it's out, I'm sure you saw, I just finished an hour, the most draconian declaration of war
[01:33:26.471 --> 01:33:30.375]  This is as bad as Beto saying, hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15.
[01:33:30.375 --> 01:33:31.616]  This is insane.
[01:33:31.616 --> 01:33:32.277]  What do we do?
[01:33:32.277 --> 01:33:33.138]  How do we counter this?
[01:33:33.138 --> 01:33:34.379]  They're trying to destroy the NRA.
[01:33:34.379 --> 01:33:35.781]  They're trying to bankrupt it.
[01:33:35.781 --> 01:33:38.303]  NRA's doing a smart thing, leaving New York just like Trump did.
[01:33:38.303 --> 01:33:40.585]  Same group suing NRA or suing me.
[01:33:40.585 --> 01:33:41.847]  I mean, this is a war.
[01:33:41.847 --> 01:33:42.908]  And listeners, you know it's a war.
[01:33:44.545 --> 01:33:54.213]  Well, you know, not just spotlighting the cockroaches, I think the most important lesson has been hidden from generations, and that's the lesson of Old Yeller.
[01:33:54.213 --> 01:33:55.574]  We love dogs.
[01:33:55.574 --> 01:34:04.081]  When Old Yeller protects us from the snake and the cougar, when Old Yeller brings us the newspaper and our slippers, we give Old Yeller a kiss and a hug and a biscuit.
[01:34:04.081 --> 01:34:09.325]  When Old Yeller, the same dog we love dearly, begins foaming at the mouth
[01:34:10.330 --> 01:34:17.333]  We know what we have to do, old yeller, but we don't embrace difficult and discomforting decisions in life.
[01:34:17.333 --> 01:34:25.956]  I use the reference of the Germans who pretended they weren't complicit by their cult of denial of what happened during the genocide.
[01:34:25.956 --> 01:34:31.838]  There are Americans today that are hiding from the indicators, hiding from the evidence, so here's the answer.
[01:34:31.838 --> 01:34:32.638]  Number one, Alex,
[01:34:33.078 --> 01:34:44.763]  Everybody who believes in freedom, right now more than ever, you have to be a member of the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, the Texas State Rifle Association, all your state Second Amendment organizations.
[01:34:44.763 --> 01:34:50.606]  You have to communicate with your mayor, your senator, your congressman, your governor, on a weekly basis.
[01:34:50.606 --> 01:34:55.128]  I'm just a guitar player, but I know what experimenting in self-government looks like.
[01:34:55.128 --> 01:35:00.650]  The answer is to reverse the apathy, turn it into activism.
[01:35:00.650 --> 01:35:02.331]  Let your mayor know
[01:35:02.571 --> 01:35:15.539]  Well, you believe and demand in law and order, and only a mentally deranged, dangerous criminal would want to defund the fire department and release the arsonists.
[01:35:15.539 --> 01:35:18.621]  And that's what the defund the police insanity means.
[01:35:18.621 --> 01:35:24.424]  And let's talk about that because you've been on the show in the last 20 years a lot, but I can tell you we're in the middle of a jam session, took a break.
[01:35:24.424 --> 01:35:26.686]  You are feeling some endorphin right now, my friend.
[01:35:26.686 --> 01:35:28.187]  So you're in a super positive mode, and I agree.
[01:35:28.807 --> 01:35:33.189]  What do you make, though, of engaging, like you do all over the country?
[01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:34.649]  I know we talked the other day.
[01:35:34.649 --> 01:35:37.391]  You're saying you may go down to the Texas border the next few weeks.
[01:35:37.391 --> 01:35:39.031]  I definitely want to be there and cover that.
[01:35:39.031 --> 01:35:43.573]  I mean, peacefully, I think we all need to go expose this, not just Ted Nugent, not just Alex Jones.
[01:35:43.573 --> 01:35:48.575]  I think President Trump needs to go down to Donna, Texas and McAllen and go to these centers.
[01:35:48.575 --> 01:35:54.037]  You can wait 30 minutes and the trucks just pull up with the little kids, never checked, just brought in illegally.
[01:35:54.037 --> 01:35:55.838]  We need to spotlight this, as you say.
[01:35:57.153 --> 01:36:10.434]  Well, one of the worst curses that mankind is capable of inflicting on each other can literally be identified by the Epstein's and the Weinstein's of the world that the Clintons are in bed with.
[01:36:11.167 --> 01:36:30.033]  Figuratively and literally speaking, when child sex trafficking is ignored, but women without masks are put in jail, that women who open their diner are put in jail, when a farmer in Oregon is arrested for catching rainwater,
[01:36:31.011 --> 01:36:40.900]  Off the roof of his house, into a bucket, you're not allowed to catch rainwater in some jurisdictions where the liberals have gone totally berserk.
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:46.425]  And conservation, conscientious people didn't fight back.
[01:36:46.425 --> 01:36:49.488]  We have to fight back on the activist level.
[01:36:49.488 --> 01:36:52.310]  Peacefully, but communicate on a regular basis.
[01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:53.031]  And yes, Alex,
[01:36:53.391 --> 01:37:07.400]  Shemane and I, with our Ted Nugent Spirit of the Wild show and our Spirit Campfire and all the different incredible communication that my wife Shemane accomplishes, we're coming down to the border because everybody has to know that these children are being trafficked!
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:11.783]  And when you catch a guy doing it, he plays dumb!
[01:37:11.783 --> 01:37:14.785]  Well, that's not dumb, that's demonic!
[01:37:14.785 --> 01:37:17.587]  We have to spotlight these devil cockroaches!
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:18.861]  Well, that's right.
[01:37:18.861 --> 01:37:21.423]  And the crazy part is Biden didn't even sign an executive order.
[01:37:21.423 --> 01:37:22.063]  That would be overturned.
[01:37:22.063 --> 01:37:22.944]  There's no law.
[01:37:22.944 --> 01:37:23.925]  The whole thing's illegal.
[01:37:23.925 --> 01:37:25.406]  The whole thing's smuggling.
[01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:30.070]  And they're just doing it in plain view, disappearing these children all over the country.
[01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:38.858]  And the Senate report, as you know, six years ago found that Obama knowingly gave tens of thousands of children to sex traffickers.
[01:37:40.976 --> 01:37:52.730]  You know, we've been to Africa many times and Shemaine has done a lot of interviews with some real heroes of law enforcement and the military who have dedicated their lives to saving these women and children that are enslaved and trafficked.
[01:37:54.509 --> 01:37:57.290]  And it's happening on a daily basis.
[01:37:57.290 --> 01:38:04.692]  And thank God, a big salute to you, not just from the Nugent family, Alex, but a lot of people are watching you spotlight these devils.
[01:38:04.692 --> 01:38:05.852]  And we thank you for that.
[01:38:05.852 --> 01:38:07.832]  But more and more people have to do it.
[01:38:07.832 --> 01:38:09.913]  And then they have to act upon it.
[01:38:09.913 --> 01:38:14.774]  You can't identify a foaming at the mouth dog and then go back to your gardening.
[01:38:15.214 --> 01:38:18.117]  You have to deal with the rabid dog.
[01:38:18.117 --> 01:38:20.219]  You have to eliminate the rabid dog.
[01:38:20.219 --> 01:38:23.902]  And if you're not able to do it, call your wildlife control up.
[01:38:23.902 --> 01:38:25.503]  But call somebody.
[01:38:25.503 --> 01:38:26.764]  Complain to someone.
[01:38:26.764 --> 01:38:37.894]  When you see something wrong and stupid and anti-logic and untruthful and against common sense, if you don't act upon it, you are complicit.
[01:38:37.894 --> 01:38:38.495]  Absolutely.
[01:38:38.795 --> 01:38:39.776]  Ted Nugent's our guest.
[01:38:39.776 --> 01:38:43.018]  I've interviewed your amazing wife, but I've never talked to Rocco.
[01:38:43.018 --> 01:38:45.280]  I want to come back and talk to your son some as well.
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:47.021]  Ted Nugent's with us.
[01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:47.681]  Who knows how long?
[01:38:47.681 --> 01:38:49.022]  We'll twist his arm a little bit the next hour.
[01:38:49.022 --> 01:38:50.243]  We have another guest coming up.
[01:38:50.243 --> 01:38:53.825]  They're shutting down churches in Canada.
[01:38:53.825 --> 01:38:56.627]  The equation is very simple.
[01:38:56.627 --> 01:38:58.449]  The bank of banks control the media.
[01:38:58.449 --> 01:39:00.250]  They control big pharma.
[01:39:00.250 --> 01:39:02.812]  They control academia.
[01:39:02.812 --> 01:39:05.213]  They control the military, industrial complex.
[01:39:05.213 --> 01:39:06.194]  They control big tech.
[01:39:07.339 --> 01:39:16.442]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[01:39:16.442 --> 01:39:24.925]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:31.688]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down, and use
[01:39:32.548 --> 01:39:40.633]  The idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[01:39:40.633 --> 01:39:45.135]  That's why they target InfoWars, because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[01:39:45.135 --> 01:39:50.498]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote InfoWars and add that video.
[01:39:50.498 --> 01:39:51.478]  So we double your efforts.
[01:39:51.478 --> 01:39:52.519]  We're all in this together.
[01:39:53.317 --> 01:39:54.858]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[01:39:54.858 --> 01:39:55.618]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:39:55.618 --> 01:39:56.378]  Trying to move quicker.
[01:39:56.378 --> 01:39:57.179]  Hey, Alex.
[01:39:57.179 --> 01:39:57.619]  Welcome.
[01:39:57.619 --> 01:40:02.781]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[01:40:02.781 --> 01:40:06.163]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[01:40:06.163 --> 01:40:12.626]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[01:40:12.626 --> 01:40:14.286]  Living Defense saved my life.
[01:40:14.286 --> 01:40:18.448]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[01:40:18.448 --> 01:40:19.869]  Living Defense brought me back.
[01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:25.692]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[01:40:25.692 --> 01:40:28.093]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[01:40:28.093 --> 01:40:37.398]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:42.821]  And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
[01:40:42.821 --> 01:40:44.362]  That's right where we're at brother.
[01:40:44.562 --> 01:40:54.810]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:58.332]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[01:40:58.332 --> 01:41:05.378]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought down to nothing.
[01:41:05.378 --> 01:41:09.441]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are the right team.
[01:41:10.359 --> 01:41:13.321]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[01:41:13.321 --> 01:41:20.567]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[01:41:20.567 --> 01:41:23.410]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:25.712]  The enemy can't help itself.
[01:41:25.712 --> 01:41:29.775]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:41:29.775 --> 01:41:33.798]  We sit here as good people and get upset about that and try to stop it.
[01:41:33.798 --> 01:41:34.419]  We should, but
[01:41:35.311 --> 01:41:45.218]  Once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[01:41:45.218 --> 01:41:47.379]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[01:41:47.379 --> 01:41:50.021]  You're going under judgment, just like all the children that were aborted.
[01:41:50.982 --> 01:41:52.643]  This is the truth.
[01:41:52.643 --> 01:41:57.304]  This is the Infowar.
[01:41:57.304 --> 01:42:02.565]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[01:42:02.565 --> 01:42:09.407]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[01:42:09.407 --> 01:42:11.068]  With or without a battery.
[01:42:11.833 --> 01:42:17.941]  Now, with the Infowars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[01:42:17.941 --> 01:42:18.802]  Excellent.
[01:42:18.802 --> 01:42:24.390]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:27.413]  And you can too, at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:42:57.208 --> 01:43:04.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:09.027]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, and here's Ted Nugent from deep in the heart of Texas bringing us in.
[01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:11.420]  We're good.
[01:43:29.807 --> 01:43:32.469]  I feel so good, Alex, it ain't right.
[01:43:32.469 --> 01:43:38.593]  Hey, you did that in your living room, same place you are with your son Rocco, a few years ago when I had great lunch with you and your wife.
[01:43:38.593 --> 01:43:42.976]  Will you please just hit a couple riffs off the Star Spangled Banner for us?
[01:43:42.976 --> 01:43:43.817]  I can, absolutely.
[01:43:43.817 --> 01:43:44.898]  I hate to do it on the part of you.
[01:43:55.071 --> 01:43:55.592]  Yeah!
[01:43:55.592 --> 01:43:55.772]  Woo!
[01:43:55.772 --> 01:43:56.573]  That's good!
[01:44:12.992 --> 01:44:15.074]  I got goosebumps and that's all the intro.
[01:44:15.074 --> 01:44:17.156]  Oh, I was getting goosebumps.
[01:44:17.156 --> 01:44:22.662]  It's powerful over Skype, but in person, it was the best rendition of Star Spangled Banner I've ever heard when you played the whole damn thing.
[01:44:22.662 --> 01:44:28.669]  You got your son there with us here in a little bit in the next hour, but you're super positive despite all this horrible stuff happening.
[01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:29.590]  You're spirit strong.
[01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:30.631]  So is mine.
[01:44:30.631 --> 01:44:31.932]  I see a global awakening.
[01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:32.853]  I feel it.
[01:44:32.853 --> 01:44:34.495]  So I want to go back to your message.
[01:44:34.495 --> 01:44:35.516]  As negative as things are,
[01:44:35.976 --> 01:44:39.878]  We need to be positive spiritually at a gut level, but also we need to take action.
[01:44:39.878 --> 01:44:46.401]  So some more examples of that, and then Rocco, I know you're an articulate person in your own right, the great son of Ted Nugent.
[01:44:46.401 --> 01:44:49.183]  What is your view on all this?
[01:44:49.183 --> 01:44:53.045]  Man, I'm a little bit more oriented to the metaphysical aspects of it.
[01:44:53.045 --> 01:44:57.747]  I feel like I got this guy on the front lines of the terrestrial aspect.
[01:44:57.747 --> 01:45:02.310]  And me and some of my friends have been tuned into what you've been doing, and others like David Icke.
[01:45:03.331 --> 01:45:18.882]  And I got more interested in, like, you know, who's really behind the cabal, extraterrestrial beings that are hijacking energy fields of the planet, that are installing slaughterhouses, that are, you know, the motive... By the way, I totally agree.
[01:45:18.882 --> 01:45:22.465]  When you hit the bottom of the rabbit hole, whatever it is that's anti-human, it's anti-success.
[01:45:24.018 --> 01:45:24.598]  Yes.
[01:45:24.598 --> 01:45:29.223]  Well, I think what we witness, the manifestation on a daily basis.
[01:45:29.223 --> 01:45:32.586]  Alex, I have a lot of really, really smart friends, my band, my crew.
[01:45:32.586 --> 01:45:37.090]  We're doing a jam session tonight in Waco, Texas, every Thursday night at Tucker Hall.
[01:45:37.090 --> 01:45:42.715]  We just unleashed the old greasy, speakeasy, original rhythm and blues rock and roll celebration.
[01:45:42.715 --> 01:45:44.517]  You know, should I get in the car and drive up there tonight?
[01:45:44.517 --> 01:45:45.238]  Maybe I'm going to do that.
[01:45:46.361 --> 01:45:58.511]  I'm telling you, the people that joined me for this jam session, it brings you such hope and such positive prognosis, but you don't fix the bad and the ugly by complaining about it.
[01:45:58.511 --> 01:46:04.736]  You maximize your strength, taking good care of yourself, clean and sober, eating good food, making sure you get activity.
[01:46:04.736 --> 01:46:09.560]  I'm 72, but I could kick the 25-year-old Ted Nugent's ass right now.
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:10.781]  I believe you.
[01:46:10.781 --> 01:46:12.242]  You're pretty intimidating in person.
[01:46:12.242 --> 01:46:13.904]  How have you gotten stronger over the years?
[01:46:15.166 --> 01:46:17.267]  Well, again, prioritization.
[01:46:17.267 --> 01:46:22.490]  I've always been clean and sober, and when you're clean and sober, you're able to make smart decisions in life.
[01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:27.872]  And Rocco has followed that path of taking good care of your spirit, your mind, your body, and your soul.
[01:46:27.872 --> 01:46:39.838]  And if you met all my sons and daughters and grandkids, my band, my crew, the guys I'm jamming with every Thursday night here in Waco at Tucker Hall, I mean, you could be fooled and spoiled into believing that the world is literally perfect.
[01:46:39.838 --> 01:46:43.440]  But after we recharge our batteries, we go back into...
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:55.905]  Well that's the thing, when I'm around Christians, conservatives, nationalists, patriots, black, white, doesn't matter, they're so alive and you see leftists, you go to downtown Austin or downtown LA, they look like somebody sucked their damn soul.
[01:46:55.905 --> 01:47:12.951]  Well again, try to find a human being who can really sound like they make sense or believe in what they're saying that would watch Joe Biden attempt to form a sentence, try to make a statement, try to make some meaningful delivery, and have them explain how this man is the commander-in-chief
[01:47:13.471 --> 01:47:18.035]  Of the greatest nation, the strongest nation, most quality of life nation in the history of the world.
[01:47:18.035 --> 01:47:23.639]  You have to literally be a zombie to believe what is happening politically in this country.
[01:47:23.639 --> 01:47:28.343]  And it's a direct result of the apathy where good people let it happen.
[01:47:28.343 --> 01:47:30.404]  I say we stop letting it happen.
[01:47:30.404 --> 01:47:32.306]  I agree, but the globalists are smart.
[01:47:32.306 --> 01:47:40.292]  They put him in to demoralize America because Trump made us look strong, build back, made us stronger, realizing our own strength and God's strength.
[01:47:40.292 --> 01:47:42.394]  This is meant to be the poison to the antidote.
[01:47:43.763 --> 01:47:50.586]  And I sense that it's meant to be the call to action for everyone to get into metaphysical spiritual alignment with themselves.
[01:47:50.586 --> 01:47:53.107]  Self-realization, then self-actualization.
[01:47:53.107 --> 01:48:02.832]  Your body-mind-spirit complex first, because there are parasitic entities that, whether they're in a body or not, they want to feed off of someone else's energy.
[01:48:03.092 --> 01:48:05.473]  Yeah, the Democrats are definitely parasites.
[01:48:05.473 --> 01:48:12.277]  I mean, they literally want to punish the hardest-working people and reward those who refuse to be productive.
[01:48:12.277 --> 01:48:13.097]  And it's a choice.
[01:48:13.097 --> 01:48:16.479]  They made the choice to not be in the asset column.
[01:48:16.479 --> 01:48:17.279]  I totally agree with Tim.
[01:48:17.279 --> 01:48:20.121]  What Rocco's saying, whether we look at it as an archetype or real,
[01:48:21.335 --> 01:48:25.080]  The globalists, I've talked to some of their top psychiatrists that have defected over to our side.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:32.490]  They teach them in their brainwashing and gaslighting of us to have their own centered will in who they are and remember that they're just manipulating us.
[01:48:32.490 --> 01:48:37.157]  But we need to become centered again and realize who we are and what we stand for and not let what they do to us affect us.
[01:48:37.157 --> 01:48:37.798]  Does that make sense?
[01:48:39.761 --> 01:48:41.302]  You have to be in the asset column.
[01:48:41.302 --> 01:48:49.808]  I would say that the more subtle aspect of that is about being unity consciousness and crystalline in your own perception.
[01:48:49.808 --> 01:48:53.151]  Seeing very clearly, but first you have to see yourself clearly.
[01:48:53.151 --> 01:48:55.412]  Not project all of these problems out into the world.
[01:48:55.412 --> 01:49:03.698]  Yes, first take accountability and then recognize where the gaps or the leaks in the hull, so to speak, of the collective are happening.
[01:49:05.186 --> 01:49:06.028]  I totally agree with that.
[01:49:06.028 --> 01:49:08.752]  So Ted, what do we do with this gun grab, this open border?
[01:49:08.752 --> 01:49:10.214]  The globals are trying to break America.
[01:49:10.214 --> 01:49:13.219]  I think we first realize they're not breaking America.
[01:49:13.219 --> 01:49:15.543]  They're trying to convince us they've broken us, but then what do we do to stop it?
[01:49:16.934 --> 01:49:21.836]  Well, once again, I think that the Democrats have so turned into the party of the devil.
[01:49:21.836 --> 01:49:26.418]  Everything they do is historically proven to ruin every culture it has touched.
[01:49:26.418 --> 01:49:28.158]  They want to turn us into Venezuela.
[01:49:28.158 --> 01:49:32.120]  They want to turn the whole country into a gun-free murder zone.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:33.681]  Everything they stand for.
[01:49:33.681 --> 01:49:36.902]  You can't go to school and you can't open your diner, but millions of
[01:49:37.422 --> 01:49:39.843]  Invaders are allowed through your open borders?
[01:49:39.843 --> 01:49:41.523]  I mean, none of it makes sense.
[01:49:41.523 --> 01:49:48.226]  So you have to identify that this might be a gift, a wake-up call against the self-inflicted apathy of this country.
[01:49:48.226 --> 01:49:51.287]  The engineered recidivism of our crime statistics.
[01:49:51.287 --> 01:49:53.167]  The recidivism is engineered.
[01:49:53.167 --> 01:49:54.448]  The courts are doing it.
[01:49:54.448 --> 01:49:55.888]  They're releasing dangerous people.
[01:49:55.888 --> 01:50:02.010]  Again, I use the analogy, you don't defund the fire department and then release the arsonists.
[01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:04.271]  And that's what the Democrat Party stands for.
[01:50:04.271 --> 01:50:04.791]  It's just
[01:50:05.171 --> 01:50:08.712]  Bizarro world, but I think even your middle ground people, i.e.
[01:50:08.712 --> 01:50:19.676]  apathetic, non-involved, non-participants in the sacred experiment in self-government, those that don't pay attention and become apathetic and spoiled, they're finally going, you literally, really?
[01:50:19.676 --> 01:50:22.636]  So self-defense is against the law?
[01:50:22.636 --> 01:50:24.377]  So I can't open my restaurant?
[01:50:24.617 --> 01:50:33.222]  But people can invade my country and I have to pay for their invasion, I have to pay for their food, their lodging, I get to buy them new clothes, and we don't even know where the children are going?
[01:50:33.222 --> 01:50:38.524]  I think this is the most demonic wake-up call that a society could ever respond to.
[01:50:38.524 --> 01:50:40.605]  And thank you for sounding the alarm.
[01:50:40.605 --> 01:50:41.686]  That's what I do every day.
[01:50:41.686 --> 01:50:43.307]  That's why we're considered radicals.
[01:50:43.307 --> 01:50:51.011]  Because we're radically involved in a radical experiment in self-government that provides the greatest quality of life in the history of mankind.
[01:50:51.616 --> 01:50:54.560]  Well, you've always got good instincts and you didn't want to go to D.C.
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:59.407]  You just said it's going to be out of control and the anti-Phil will be there.
[01:50:59.407 --> 01:51:04.814]  You passed on that, a little inside baseball, and that turned into a big fiasco of the left provocateuring and a bunch of things.
[01:51:04.814 --> 01:51:06.717]  But you told me you do want to go to the border.
[01:51:06.717 --> 01:51:08.540]  You're obviously just north of me here in Texas.
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:10.821]  And I've already been down there, our crew has.
[01:51:10.821 --> 01:51:27.045]  I'd love to give you a blueprint to go, or send my security guys with you to help you out, but we know where to go, where you go there, and there'll be buses and cars every 15-20 minutes, kids illegally, people coming across in yards, being grabbed, put in cars by coyotes, then taken to Catholic charities, and just disappeared.
[01:51:27.045 --> 01:51:34.167]  I mean, we've got the smoking gun stuff, and again, it's so off the charts, it's so off the rails, that it's everywhere.
[01:51:34.167 --> 01:51:37.568]  I mean, it looks like a football game let out or something of illegals.
[01:51:37.568 --> 01:51:38.128]  This is crazy.
[01:51:39.329 --> 01:51:57.283]  It isn't heartbreaking that the media overall is not covering the most dangerous and evil conditions, which can be summarized as child trafficking, an open invasion orchestrated by our own government, especially during a Chinese virus attack.
[01:51:57.803 --> 01:52:20.732]  So, Alex, God bless you for that, but Shemaine and I and my family and people who want discomfort in information so that we can make sure that old yeller doesn't become rabid, we who care, we salute you and we know that the most important job of an American is to always be suspicious, to always ask questions and hold elected employees
[01:52:21.192 --> 01:52:21.933]  We're good to go.
[01:52:45.872 --> 01:52:55.040]  Politely, yet forcefully, with your elected employees that we support law and order, and if you want to defund the police, you are on the side of evil!
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:57.782]  All right, Ted Nugent and Ron Coe, your son, stay there.
[01:52:57.782 --> 01:52:59.423]  We're doing 10 more minutes with you.
[01:52:59.423 --> 01:53:01.225]  I want to talk about O'Biden.
[01:53:01.225 --> 01:53:01.965]  I call him O'Biden.
[01:53:01.965 --> 01:53:04.247]  He's the third term of Obama.
[01:53:04.247 --> 01:53:06.068]  How, though, do you see that unfolding?
[01:53:06.068 --> 01:53:07.009]  I think we should impeach him.
[01:53:07.009 --> 01:53:08.310]  I don't know what we do.
[01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:09.111]  The election fraud.
[01:53:09.111 --> 01:53:10.792]  I want to pick your brain on a few other subjects.
[01:53:10.792 --> 01:53:12.414]  Please don't forget, we're listener-supported.
[01:53:12.414 --> 01:53:14.155]  You know, they took our sponsors years ago with harassment.
[01:53:14.535 --> 01:53:17.976]  We sell a lot of vitamins, minerals, products, t-shirts, water filtration.
[01:53:17.976 --> 01:53:19.317]  It's all at Infowarsstore.com.

[01:54:48.551 --> 01:54:59.153]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.

[01:55:46.753 --> 01:55:49.876]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:49.876 --> 01:56:05.228]  Oh baby, I'm gonna teach you what love's all about tonight.
[01:56:09.551 --> 01:56:15.374]  All right, I know about Ted Nugent being a manly guy.
[01:56:15.374 --> 01:56:24.299]  I mean, in person, I've seen, you know, I've met, like, professional wrestlers, NFL players, big, huge, 7-foot-tall guys, and they have a presence, but Ted Nugent has a alive presence.
[01:56:25.079 --> 01:56:26.861]  Last time I hung out with him, he was like 71.
[01:56:26.861 --> 01:56:28.662]  Haven't seen him in a year.
[01:56:28.662 --> 01:56:31.164]  And you're like, man, this guy has an electric presence.
[01:56:31.164 --> 01:56:32.244]  You feel good around him.
[01:56:32.244 --> 01:56:33.645]  You feel strengthened.
[01:56:33.645 --> 01:56:35.046]  You feel love.
[01:56:35.046 --> 01:56:36.007]  And I get around the left.
[01:56:36.007 --> 01:56:38.109]  I get around Chuckie Schumer or Pelosi.
[01:56:38.109 --> 01:56:39.730]  I've been around in the halls of Congress.
[01:56:39.730 --> 01:56:41.151]  You feel a shiver up your spine.
[01:56:41.151 --> 01:56:43.733]  You turn around, and it's Chuckie Schumer, man.
[01:56:43.733 --> 01:56:45.594]  It's the opposite of Ted Nugent energy.
[01:56:45.594 --> 01:56:47.796]  So let's talk about that in these next few segments.
[01:56:47.796 --> 01:56:52.399]  I mean, I couldn't join these people, even if they threatened to kill me, because their energy sucks, Ted!
[01:56:53.567 --> 01:56:56.510]  Well, stop and think of what they say and how they say it.
[01:56:56.510 --> 01:57:06.418]  All you need to do is play a loop of Nancy Pelosi behind President Trump ripping up with that vicious, evil, witch look on her face.
[01:57:06.418 --> 01:57:15.366]  She's literally committing a felony live on television during the State of the Union address, ripping up We the People's State of the Union copy.
[01:57:16.166 --> 01:57:17.627]  And look at her face!
[01:57:17.627 --> 01:57:27.775]  Saturday Night Live couldn't do a skit that depicts a more demonic, deranged, nasty, hateful, rotten, mean-spirited person!
[01:57:27.775 --> 01:57:28.355]  No, I agree.
[01:57:28.355 --> 01:57:30.577]  Let's talk about your energy, because I've been around a lot of people.
[01:57:30.577 --> 01:57:32.098]  Trump has amazing energy as well.
[01:57:32.098 --> 01:57:33.259]  What makes you have that energy?
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:39.964]  Well, again, I'm 72 years clean and sober, and I've been surrounded by the greatest people in the world.
[01:57:39.964 --> 01:57:45.087]  I'm a bowhunter, so I have to have a higher level of awareness to get my dinner with a sharp stick.
[01:57:45.087 --> 01:57:50.090]  You've got to be sneaky and have tactics, and you have to be tactically tuned in.
[01:57:50.090 --> 01:57:51.611]  I pursue omniscience.
[01:57:51.611 --> 01:57:57.675]  I'm never going to achieve omniscience, but when I'm bowhunting and jamming with my incredible musicians,
[01:57:58.195 --> 01:58:00.616]  My level of awareness is like a sponge.
[01:58:00.616 --> 01:58:04.479]  Remember, Alex, I got to play bass guitar for Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley.
[01:58:04.479 --> 01:58:05.599]  I jammed with B.B.
[01:58:05.599 --> 01:58:06.520]  King.
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:09.802]  You're saying you literally psychically mesh with these people.
[01:58:09.802 --> 01:58:12.543]  You mesh with the nature, you're tuned in.
[01:58:12.543 --> 01:58:22.068]  Yes, yes, and that literally provides you an energy that all the juicing and all the vitamins and all the minerals and all the venison can't provide.
[01:58:22.068 --> 01:58:24.249]  So it's like my son Rocco said.
[01:58:24.249 --> 01:58:26.691]  Here's a great quote from a Native American chief.
[01:58:27.455 --> 01:58:30.722]  And everybody should write this down and imprint it.
[01:58:30.722 --> 01:58:34.830]  God gave you everything you need.
[01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:35.832]  You already have.
[01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:37.880]  Everything you need.
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:47.823]  You have to know yourself intimately, constantly pursue that inner knowledge, so you can put to use these incredible, miraculous gifts.
[01:58:47.823 --> 01:59:05.968]  You watch some of these great athletes and these great bow hunters and the Native Americans, Crazy Horse and Cochise and Sitting Bull, and you watch how they conduct themselves, their spiritual life with the buffalo, and the nature that provides them food, lodging, clothes, weapons, tools, medicine, but most importantly,
[01:59:06.628 --> 01:59:07.449]  Spirit!
[01:59:07.449 --> 01:59:27.507]  That's why my song is Spirit of the Wild, my TV show is Spirit of the Wild, my campfire is Spirit Campfire, and people have dug into this and listened to the lyrics of my song, Great White Buffalo, and realized that modern man can be so spoiled that when it gets really cold outside or there's a flood, they can run out of toilet paper.
[01:59:28.568 --> 01:59:31.351]  I mean, talking about the anti-being-prepared boy stuff.
[01:59:31.351 --> 01:59:34.934]  You're explaining it's not about the material, the spirit is everything.
[01:59:34.934 --> 01:59:38.757]  With that comes the material, and I can feel that spirit when I'm around you.
[01:59:38.757 --> 01:59:40.018]  That's why they demonize you.
[01:59:40.018 --> 01:59:42.000]  People go, oh, don't look at Ted Nugent, he's bad.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.283]  They don't want you to experience the Ted Nugent, and then there's the spirit's infectious.
[01:59:46.778 --> 01:59:54.290]  You know, and I'm very deep into the spirit world, but I also shovel my dog kennels, so I'm deep into the shoveling of poop world.
[01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:55.652]  So I'm... That's how it is.
[01:59:55.652 --> 01:59:58.978]  You gotta be in the ground, you gotta be a farmer, you gotta be real to be connected to God.
[01:59:59.947 --> 02:00:00.648]  I think so.
[02:00:00.648 --> 02:00:08.253]  I think when you do what we do every spring as farmers and ranchers, and I'm just a guitar player, but I've always been fascinated by the earth.
[02:00:08.253 --> 02:00:12.196]  I've always been fascinated by that man in the arena, like the gladiator.
[02:00:12.196 --> 02:00:22.864]  Before he went into battle, he grabbed a handful of soil and made sure that the most powerful attribute is being down to earth.
[02:00:23.684 --> 02:00:24.765]  Grounded.
[02:00:24.765 --> 02:00:26.826]  That's what the rednecks are.
[02:00:26.826 --> 02:00:33.309]  That's what the farmers and ranchers and hunters and fishermen and trappers, and that's what all these people across America... Exactly!
[02:00:33.309 --> 02:00:36.650]  And the left is up in high-rise buildings their whole lives, like mold.
[02:00:36.650 --> 02:00:37.891]  They've never been grounded.
[02:00:37.891 --> 02:00:39.912]  We need to save them, but can they be saved?
[02:00:39.912 --> 02:00:42.153]  Final segment with Ted Nugent in 60 seconds.
[02:00:42.153 --> 02:00:44.854]  We join a lot of stations, and I've been interviewing this guy for 20 years.
[02:00:44.854 --> 02:00:46.415]  That was the most powerful interview ever.
[02:00:46.415 --> 02:00:47.535]  We got a little bit left.
[02:00:47.535 --> 02:00:48.956]  Wow, I am on fire!
[02:00:52.091 --> 02:00:54.632]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[02:00:54.632 --> 02:00:58.334]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine.
[02:00:58.334 --> 02:01:05.498]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our families' sakes, but also our community.
[02:01:05.498 --> 02:01:12.441]  And citizenstronghold.com is the best place to go to get high-quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.

[02:01:54.210 --> 02:01:55.371]  Big Brother.
[02:01:55.371 --> 02:01:57.172]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:57.172 --> 02:01:59.053]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:59.053 --> 02:02:00.753]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:02:00.753 --> 02:02:02.394]  Well, so does he.
[02:02:02.394 --> 02:02:08.057]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:02:08.057 --> 02:02:09.998]  I'm being honest with listeners.
[02:02:09.998 --> 02:02:11.699]  I know the metaphysical's real.
[02:02:11.699 --> 02:02:12.559]  I know God's real.
[02:02:12.559 --> 02:02:15.340]  I know the Spirit's like a fire.
[02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:17.061]  You can't just keep that fire under yourself.
[02:02:17.061 --> 02:02:18.722]  You gotta share it with other people, like this candle.
[02:02:19.688 --> 02:02:25.353]  I'm lighting here in studio with Ted Nugent right now on TV and radio with his sound broadcasting.
[02:02:25.353 --> 02:02:28.015]  They want to put America's flame out.
[02:02:28.015 --> 02:02:31.157]  They want to put our Republic's flame out.
[02:02:31.157 --> 02:02:33.419]  But they can't do it if we continue to share it.
[02:02:33.419 --> 02:02:38.883]  But if they're able to demoralize us and make us be cowards and make us be fearful, they can put that flame out.
[02:02:38.883 --> 02:02:41.005]  But you're aware of them trying it.
[02:02:41.005 --> 02:02:44.208]  They don't have the power to do that anymore.
[02:02:44.208 --> 02:02:45.989]  And so, Ted, you just knocked it out of the park.
[02:02:45.989 --> 02:02:46.990]  Some stations just joined us.
[02:02:47.790 --> 02:02:56.212]  I've talked about knowing you because I've known a lot of people, you know, more famous people than I have, but a lot of famous people have something about them, a spark, a gravitas with you.
[02:02:57.116 --> 02:03:01.320]  It's a very focused, good, clean energy.
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:02.781]  One of the strongest souls I've ever met.
[02:03:02.781 --> 02:03:04.903]  Your wife, one of the other ones, amazing lady.
[02:03:04.903 --> 02:03:19.015]  You were speaking about that spirit because the more I get older, the more I research, I can talk about documents and globalism and the new world order and facts and bills and history, but it really comes down to spirit and the whole system is trying to suppress our spirit and make us these domesticated idiots.
[02:03:19.015 --> 02:03:20.756]  It's what you said.
[02:03:20.756 --> 02:03:22.718]  I've taken with Mike Judge out many times.
[02:03:23.505 --> 02:03:27.809]  Hollywood folks that hate my guts, we shoot for an hour, eat barbecue, settle, this is so easy, I love it.
[02:03:27.809 --> 02:03:29.650]  They're converted in an hour.
[02:03:29.650 --> 02:03:31.772]  Really, I think converting these people is the answer.
[02:03:31.772 --> 02:03:34.454]  Some of them are evil, like Pelosi and Obama and Biden.
[02:03:34.454 --> 02:03:40.059]  They're too far gone, but a lot of their minions are actually imprisoned, I think.
[02:03:40.059 --> 02:03:43.262]  So is it worth it to outreach to them, or what do you recommend?
[02:03:44.207 --> 02:03:45.868]  Oh, it's absolutely worth it, Alex.
[02:03:45.868 --> 02:03:53.513]  I would welcome everybody to come on my Facebook and witness the tens of thousands, actually millions, almost four million people on my Facebook.
[02:03:53.513 --> 02:04:00.158]  And I've always preached quite militantly that clean and sober is the only way you're going to be in the asset column for your mother.
[02:04:00.618 --> 02:04:09.004]  The only way you're going to be an asset to your family, your neighborhood, your country, the earth, your fellow man, is by being tuned in with reality.
[02:04:09.004 --> 02:04:16.509]  Not a fog, not a chemically induced awareness, because that is actually comfortably numb, is uncomfortably dumb.
[02:04:16.509 --> 02:04:21.213]  But when you're clean and sober and you take good care of your body, it's a sacred temple, you will discover
[02:04:22.606 --> 02:04:29.810]  Pulsations and electricity and sounds and sights that otherwise you're unaware of.
[02:04:29.810 --> 02:04:32.652]  Let me put it in the most graphic way.
[02:04:32.652 --> 02:04:36.093]  There is a movement in this country to ban hunting.
[02:04:36.093 --> 02:04:44.498]  Well, I was with the Gros Ventre and the Assitiboine up in Montana hunting buffalo because the land, I don't care how much land it is, will only support so much wildlife.
[02:04:44.498 --> 02:04:50.761]  So they harvest buffalo every year for food, clothing, shelter, medicine, tools, and spirit.
[02:04:50.761 --> 02:04:51.842]  It's a perfect cycle.
[02:04:53.244 --> 02:05:03.357]  Yes, when I finally put my sharp arrow and I used God's gifts to be stealthy and tuned in as a predator, I killed that buffalo and the snow started coming.
[02:05:03.357 --> 02:05:04.739]  Alex, bear with me a second.
[02:05:04.739 --> 02:05:05.900]  I'll make it as short as I can.
[02:05:05.900 --> 02:05:06.441]  No, take your time.
[02:05:07.501 --> 02:05:13.222]  We approached the dead buffalo, and the hair on my arms was standing up like it is right now.
[02:05:13.222 --> 02:05:16.483]  And it's such a magnificent beast, but you know you killed it.
[02:05:16.483 --> 02:05:20.423]  You know you accepted it as a gift from the Great Spirit.
[02:05:20.423 --> 02:05:28.625]  And we lit some sweetgrass, and the wind was howling and blowing the scent of this sweetgrass, which is a ritual of the Native Americans.
[02:05:28.625 --> 02:05:37.046]  Alex, as the chief handed me the sweetgrass to pray at the body of the buffalo for providing us life,
[02:05:37.646 --> 02:05:55.348]  I swear to God, the wind stopped, the snow stopped, I'm holding this sweet grass burning over the body of this buffalo that I was given as a gift of life, and I look to the sky and there's an eagle soaring where just seconds ago
[02:05:56.363 --> 02:06:22.552]  It was overcast and howling and snowing and I cried like a baby and the chief put his arm around me and we didn't say a word but there's a spirituality to the physics of life and if we seek that higher level of awareness and you attain it when you harvest your own food and clothing like I have done my whole life, not exclusively, I still go to the store for hardware, but I
[02:06:22.972 --> 02:06:25.194]  The whole system is about taking us out of that.
[02:06:25.194 --> 02:06:25.654]  Keep going.
[02:06:25.654 --> 02:06:27.076]  Explain this in the minutes we have left.
[02:06:27.076 --> 02:06:28.056]  Exactly.
[02:06:28.056 --> 02:06:33.121]  Our communion with God's creation is like a form of worship of God and the Native Americans know that.
[02:06:33.121 --> 02:06:39.186]  That's why they lied about you and said you hate Native Americans when your whole career has been promoting them because you're scared of them coming together.
[02:06:40.279 --> 02:06:43.260]  Yes, well, I know that the spirit is on my side.
[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:46.080]  The Native American tribes and I are blood brothers.
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:47.861]  We share sweat lodges.
[02:06:47.861 --> 02:06:49.021]  We share spirit.
[02:06:49.021 --> 02:06:54.102]  We share political activism to get our rights back, to get our freedom back.
[02:06:54.102 --> 02:07:06.165]  So when you condemn Ted Nugent for murdering innocent animals, you're literally spitting on the grave of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, which is a perfect example of the spiritual deadness
[02:07:06.725 --> 02:07:15.790]  Well, we explain to people that if there aren't wolves and coyotes and there isn't stuff, even overpopulation of deer like Austin, that this is harvesting, that we make the land better when we use it.
[02:07:15.790 --> 02:07:22.894]  I mean, it's a fraud the idea that we should just go to McDonald's and eat some Bill Gates GMO hamburger instead of going out and butchering it ourselves.
[02:07:22.894 --> 02:07:24.055]  It's a good thing to do that.
[02:07:24.055 --> 02:07:24.955]  It's normal.
[02:07:24.955 --> 02:07:26.316]  It's natural.
[02:07:26.316 --> 02:07:28.798]  It's a process that's ingrained in our genetics.
[02:07:28.798 --> 02:07:32.980]  And when we do that, it unlocks all this potential in us that is in our epigenetics.
[02:07:34.352 --> 02:07:52.686]  I attribute my aliveness, my happiness, my buoyancy, my old age athleticism, and my spirit of musical adventure with these great virtuosos I collaborate with, I attribute that to clean living, the discipline of my parents, the discipline I learned and continue with my
[02:07:53.366 --> 02:07:56.089]  Circle of life, my family, my band, my friends.
[02:07:56.089 --> 02:07:58.931]  That discipline to be the best that you can be.
[02:07:58.931 --> 02:08:01.434]  It's alive and well across this America.
[02:08:01.434 --> 02:08:05.157]  That's why your toilet flushes and that's why your light goes on.
[02:08:05.157 --> 02:08:08.840]  That's why you can still buy gas even though Biden's trying to make it illegal.
[02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:12.704]  You really examine the agenda of the left and it's anti-human.
[02:08:13.004 --> 02:08:14.325]  It's anti-life.
[02:08:14.325 --> 02:08:22.312]  Bill Gates is literally the crown of the devil with his agenda of global population reduction.
[02:08:22.312 --> 02:08:25.094]  And who would trust Fauci with a needle?
[02:08:25.094 --> 02:08:26.355]  I mean, you've got to be kidding me.
[02:08:26.355 --> 02:08:28.577]  I'm just a guitar player and I'm smart enough to know that.
[02:08:30.091 --> 02:08:31.472]  Oh, you're more than just a guitar player.
[02:08:31.472 --> 02:08:34.874]  You're amazing, Ted Nugent, and I can feel my energy getting stronger.
[02:08:34.874 --> 02:08:36.335]  I know you're feeling it.
[02:08:36.335 --> 02:08:41.998]  So I think the message here today is as bad as it is, this is the enemy desperate striking out.
[02:08:41.998 --> 02:08:47.121]  So as long as we do the right thing and are good people, we're going to succeed in the end together.
[02:08:47.121 --> 02:08:47.981]  I believe that.
[02:08:47.981 --> 02:08:51.143]  And to that point, Alex, one thing I've noticed from him is
[02:08:51.955 --> 02:08:57.178]  No one can alter someone's energy field that is connected to the Creator within.
[02:08:57.178 --> 02:09:17.549]  And all of these parasitic kind of beings, they thrive on individuals who are disconnected from their own source, disconnected from their food source, disconnected for why they're alive, their purpose, their mission, what they're here for, how they serve others, continuously in reception of benefit, and not really connected to the Creator.
[02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:20.391]  This is an example of someone who has reminded me of
[02:09:21.151 --> 02:09:29.478]  You don't access the Creator only by closing eyes and going inward, although that's a way, but you also embody the Creator by continuously giving and connecting to that source.
[02:09:29.478 --> 02:09:31.439]  I get so close to God just gardening.
[02:09:31.439 --> 02:09:33.361]  I mean, or just, like you said, roofing a house.
[02:09:33.361 --> 02:09:34.542]  It's just work.
[02:09:34.542 --> 02:09:38.245]  It's normal human activity, and that's what they want to take us out of.
[02:09:38.245 --> 02:09:38.985]  Amazing.
[02:09:38.985 --> 02:09:40.326]  Alright, we got about a minute and a half left.
[02:09:40.326 --> 02:09:42.468]  Ted Nugent, closing comment, and Rocco, closing comment.
[02:09:43.559 --> 02:09:44.860]  Well, God bless America.
[02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:50.582]  God bless the heroes of the military and their families, the law enforcement heroes, the sheepdogs who protect the sheep.
[02:09:50.582 --> 02:09:53.604]  God bless our Border Patrol who have a great relationship.
[02:09:53.604 --> 02:10:02.508]  And God bless people who put their heart and soul into being an asset by hard work and sacrifice and risk in the asset column for their family and America.
[02:10:03.846 --> 02:10:09.909]  No one can dislodge you from the bond we have with the Creator.
[02:10:09.909 --> 02:10:23.576]  If you are connected to the Creator within, if you take the time to honor your body, mind, spirit, temple, learning about trauma, learning about our collective trauma, learning about our ancestors and becoming more renewed and ready to be crystalline.
[02:10:23.576 --> 02:10:25.317]  When something is anti-life,
[02:10:25.917 --> 02:10:29.399]  It's anti-crystalline, and that's the metaphor of the anti-Christ.
[02:10:29.399 --> 02:10:37.464]  We get lost in all the conspiracies, and I've definitely, like you, Alex, I know I've gone down deep, deep rabbit holes, but you mentioned epigenetics.
[02:10:37.464 --> 02:10:50.811]  Bruce Lipton, Joe Dispenza, the more we learn about our own well-being physiologically, the less that we can be tampered with, the less that we can be separated from our own well-being, and then psychologically hijacked.
[02:10:50.871 --> 02:10:52.232]  That's why they want to isolate us from each other.
[02:10:52.232 --> 02:10:53.272]  It's been amazing.
[02:10:53.272 --> 02:10:55.153]  Best interview yet, TedNugent.com.
[02:10:55.153 --> 02:10:56.933]  Rocco, come on as a guest sometime, brother.
[02:10:56.933 --> 02:10:57.854]  You're a great guy.
[02:10:57.854 --> 02:10:58.754]  We love your show.
[02:10:58.754 --> 02:11:01.395]  How do people find you, Rocco?
[02:11:01.395 --> 02:11:04.436]  Roccomoon.co, Roccomoon on Instagram.
[02:11:04.436 --> 02:11:09.698]  I like the moon, reflect the light, and learn from him in all ways, and I'll be with him a lot.
[02:11:09.698 --> 02:11:10.099]  Beautiful.
[02:11:10.099 --> 02:11:11.979]  Well, say hi to your awesome family for me.
[02:11:11.979 --> 02:11:13.020]  We love it.
[02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:14.840]  Ted Nugent, and who knows?
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:17.401]  If I don't come up tonight, are you playing next Thursday?
[02:11:17.401 --> 02:11:18.882]  I'm going to come up there either tonight or next Thursday.
[02:11:19.801 --> 02:11:21.682]  Yeah, it looks like we're going to do it every Thursday.
[02:11:21.682 --> 02:11:28.065]  And if you want to come to hear the greatest rhythm and blues and rock and roll, me and John and Johnny do it every Thursday at Tucker Hall in Waco.
[02:11:28.065 --> 02:11:29.386]  All right, there it goes.
[02:11:29.386 --> 02:11:33.428]  Thank you so much, Ted Nugent.
[02:11:33.428 --> 02:11:36.170]  Wow, that was a powerful interview.
[02:11:36.170 --> 02:11:40.112]  And you know, I mean, they're always good with Ted Nugent, but that one was out of the damn park.
[02:11:40.112 --> 02:11:45.815]  All right, I'm going to track more of the enemy operations, and they're shutting churches down in Canada, putting fences up around them in the COVID lockdown.
[02:11:45.815 --> 02:11:48.096]  We're going to have a live feed from one of those churches fighting back.
[02:11:48.636 --> 02:11:50.678]  Coming up, stay with us.
[02:11:50.678 --> 02:11:58.804]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registrars that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[02:11:58.804 --> 02:12:06.671]  And they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[02:12:06.671 --> 02:12:09.753]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[02:12:09.753 --> 02:12:18.040]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:18.240]  Yeah.
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:43.163]  So it's a win-win as we build a true, open, free internet again, because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[02:12:43.163 --> 02:12:47.606]  So, InfoWarsDomains.com, the revolution starts there.

[02:13:44.868 --> 02:13:46.911]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:14:14.816 --> 02:14:16.598]  Over the mountain, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:16.598 --> 02:14:18.479]  We've definitely done that.
[02:14:18.479 --> 02:14:22.403]  We've gone over the mountain.
[02:14:22.403 --> 02:14:31.191]  The globalists know you're going to go over the mountain.
[02:14:31.191 --> 02:14:34.234]  They want to take you under the mountain.
[02:14:34.234 --> 02:14:36.656]  They're going to tell you you went over the mountain.
[02:14:36.656 --> 02:14:37.677]  I don't even tell you to come with me.
[02:14:37.677 --> 02:14:38.437]  I say come with God.
[02:14:38.437 --> 02:14:40.139]  And we'll go over the mountain together.
[02:14:41.081 --> 02:14:41.901]  I think about Ted Nugent.
[02:14:41.901 --> 02:14:46.123]  I've known him for a long time, many, many years ago, but it was like, he's not even acting like a big tough guy or anything.
[02:14:46.123 --> 02:14:47.363]  I was like, what's going on with this guy?
[02:14:47.363 --> 02:14:54.166]  And it's because he's like psychic and he's dialed in and you dial into it and it's just what it is is what it is.
[02:14:54.166 --> 02:14:55.086]  And then I'm the same way.
[02:14:55.086 --> 02:14:58.028]  So it's like, I think it's, is that me right there?
[02:14:58.028 --> 02:14:59.168]  Am I trying to say I'm Ted Nugent?
[02:14:59.168 --> 02:15:01.449]  It's like, I feel like this is my brother.
[02:15:01.449 --> 02:15:01.549]  And
[02:15:02.907 --> 02:15:06.069]  I've run into black people, Hispanic folks, women, you name it.
[02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:07.110]  But particularly men.
[02:15:07.110 --> 02:15:08.791]  Men are able to sink into men.
[02:15:08.791 --> 02:15:12.733]  Women are able to sink into other women's psychic connections.
[02:15:12.733 --> 02:15:15.335]  And this is all real and the enemy knows that.
[02:15:15.335 --> 02:15:19.438]  And they're trying to blanket that with racism and all this crap.
[02:15:19.438 --> 02:15:20.759]  And it's so ridiculous.
[02:15:20.759 --> 02:15:21.659]  Folks, here's my frustration.
[02:15:21.659 --> 02:15:22.920]  This is why I get so pissed off.
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:26.362]  I spent hours last night after my children went to bed researching.
[02:15:26.362 --> 02:15:28.864]  I spent hours this morning.
[02:15:28.864 --> 02:15:30.605]  And it's just so ridiculous.
[02:15:30.605 --> 02:15:31.706]  It should be so easy to beat.
[02:15:32.879 --> 02:15:40.421]  Same thing I said yesterday, they're all over the news, DeSantis won't give black people shots, trying to trick black people to go get shots.
[02:15:40.421 --> 02:15:52.363]  And then, I saw other reports, all over the news, where when they catch the media lying, or they catch the media doing something, they go, oh, it's racism.
[02:15:52.363 --> 02:15:58.964]  It has nothing to even do with it, except the globalists actually want to kill everybody.
[02:15:58.964 --> 02:16:01.145]  And so I've got the stacks here, probably 10 articles,
[02:16:01.898 --> 02:16:05.119]  Of them creating race-baiting garbage and flipping it.
[02:16:05.119 --> 02:16:07.960]  It's like whatever they're doing, they flip it.
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:10.060]  And then there's different schools of thought.
[02:16:10.060 --> 02:16:23.503]  I could spend an hour on each one of these articles and discover every little piece of it and talk about how it works and talk about how it's a deployment.
[02:16:23.503 --> 02:16:29.425]  But at the end of the day, you get caught up in making it your god by giving it all your attention.
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:34.322]  Just know this, whatever comes out of these people's mouths is meant to kill your ass.
[02:16:34.322 --> 02:16:44.207]  I mean, you know, I gotta remind myself all the time, I get caught up just constantly studying these people, and it'll drive you crazy, because they're nuts!
[02:16:44.207 --> 02:16:46.148]  These people are scum, man!
[02:16:46.148 --> 02:16:51.190]  They've got it out for everybody.
[02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:52.131]  That's a perfect example.
[02:16:52.131 --> 02:16:57.053]  I was thinking of the article and I couldn't remember it, and you guys just magically, the most badass crew ever, pulled it up.
[02:16:58.849 --> 02:16:59.490]  Here's an example.
[02:16:59.490 --> 02:17:00.170]  We have video of this.
[02:17:00.170 --> 02:17:00.831]  We'll help.
[02:17:00.831 --> 02:17:01.231]  Pull it up.
[02:17:01.231 --> 02:17:01.712]  We'll play it.
[02:17:01.712 --> 02:17:02.332]  Start the next hour.
[02:17:02.332 --> 02:17:03.694]  14-hour takes over.
[02:17:03.694 --> 02:17:12.482]  MSNBC kidnaps white evangelicals resisting vaccinations because they know blacks are the main group not taking it because they figured it out.
[02:17:12.482 --> 02:17:14.984]  God bless them.
[02:17:14.984 --> 02:17:18.167]  There's white racists that don't want you to have the shot!
[02:17:18.167 --> 02:17:20.990]  When Bill Gates literally wants to kill your ass!
[02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:24.553]  I mean, God, I can't take it anymore, man!
[02:17:25.862 --> 02:17:30.145]  And they've got all these black women all over TV!
[02:17:30.145 --> 02:17:31.645]  Here's an example.
[02:17:31.645 --> 02:17:34.087]  I sent this to the crew.
[02:17:34.087 --> 02:17:37.469]  I sent it to them Sunday, and here we are four or five days later.
[02:17:37.469 --> 02:17:38.690]  We never aired it.
[02:17:38.690 --> 02:17:44.633]  I don't know if they can find it, but it's the Saturday Night Live.
[02:17:44.633 --> 02:17:47.715]  And they're like,
[02:17:48.385 --> 02:17:52.430]  Coming up on Saturday Night Live, black people won't take the vaccine.
[02:17:52.430 --> 02:17:56.615]  So they have a black guy with a British accent, like he's smart, but other black people aren't.
[02:17:56.615 --> 02:17:58.357]  They love British accents.
[02:17:58.357 --> 02:18:05.144]  And it's the black British guy literally going, I'll give you black people barbecue.
[02:18:07.902 --> 02:18:14.747]  And Watermelon or whatever, if you take the shot and the black guy has a classic black southern voice like that's dumb.
[02:18:14.747 --> 02:18:17.129]  I ain't gonna take that from you.
[02:18:17.129 --> 02:18:29.218]  And it's literally them caricatures making fun of black people with a black guy with a British accent being racist to them because of their accent from where they are saying they're fighting racism.
[02:18:29.218 --> 02:18:31.399]  And then it's on CNN.
[02:18:31.399 --> 02:18:32.500]  I mean, I can't.
[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:35.082]  These people piss me off, man.
[02:18:35.082 --> 02:18:36.263]  And it's constant.
[02:18:40.679 --> 02:18:43.081]  I give you the barbecue, you take it!
[02:18:43.081 --> 02:18:48.184]  Can you imagine if I had a show?
[02:18:48.184 --> 02:18:52.728]  And I got up there and I went, I give you black people some barbecue!
[02:18:52.728 --> 02:18:54.569]  In fact, cue that up if you can.
[02:18:54.569 --> 02:18:57.011]  This is what I'm talking about.
[02:18:57.011 --> 02:19:00.414]  Everything they say we are is them!
[02:19:00.414 --> 02:19:07.479]  And at a certain point, what is the point of even debating these people?
[02:19:08.797 --> 02:19:11.879]  And then, they've been caught in so... Yeah, here it is.
[02:19:11.879 --> 02:19:12.700]  Let's cue it up.
[02:19:12.700 --> 02:19:13.861]  Let's cue it up.
[02:19:13.861 --> 02:19:14.941]  In fact, we have the audio ready.
[02:19:14.941 --> 02:19:16.042]  You got the audio ready?
[02:19:16.042 --> 02:19:17.183]  You guys pulled it up really quick.
[02:19:17.183 --> 02:19:17.783]  Great.
[02:19:17.783 --> 02:19:18.164]  They have it.
[02:19:18.164 --> 02:19:18.924]  Okay, here it is.
[02:19:18.924 --> 02:19:27.630]  Watch this for yourself.
[02:19:27.630 --> 02:19:28.130]  It's okay.
[02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:28.811]  Our computers hate.
[02:19:29.381 --> 02:19:31.262]  I only have like a $100,000 computer in there.
[02:19:31.262 --> 02:19:32.542]  It's not the crew's fault.
[02:19:32.542 --> 02:19:35.964]  The $100,000 computer messes up about 1% of the time.
[02:19:35.964 --> 02:19:41.226]  The $1,000,000 computer hardly ever messes up, so I can't afford the $1,000,000 switcher, so it just locked up on a bit.
[02:19:41.226 --> 02:19:43.446]  But whenever it boots back up, we'll play it for you.
[02:19:43.446 --> 02:19:49.769]  The point is, is that YouTube is firing out live, and they literally have
[02:19:51.289 --> 02:20:10.696]  Black people trying to sound like they can't talk to make fun of black people to say you're an ignorant black person because you don't want to trust a vaccine that's experimental, a vaccine that's already killed a bunch of people, a vaccine that's connected to people like Bill Gates that says he wants to kill poor people, especially blacks.
[02:20:10.696 --> 02:20:14.617]  Imagine if there was a car dealer that said, well, sometimes I like to blow people up.
[02:20:14.617 --> 02:20:17.698]  Sometimes I put plastic explosives in people's cars.
[02:20:19.781 --> 02:20:23.104]  You wouldn't go buy a car from them, but Bill Gates is saying all this.
[02:20:23.104 --> 02:20:24.705]  We'll go to break.
[02:20:24.705 --> 02:20:28.788]  We'll re-download that piece.
[02:20:28.788 --> 02:20:29.388]  It's my fault.
[02:20:29.388 --> 02:20:30.269]  I should have played it on Monday.
[02:20:30.269 --> 02:20:31.970]  I should have played it on Sunday.
[02:20:31.970 --> 02:20:34.132]  Actually, I had it for a Sunday show.
[02:20:34.132 --> 02:20:35.993]  Time just all meshes together.
[02:20:35.993 --> 02:20:39.736]  And the fact that I didn't play it twice, I guess on the computer it kind of got rotten or something.
[02:20:39.736 --> 02:20:40.937]  It's not going to work.
[02:20:40.937 --> 02:20:42.679]  We'll re-download it.
[02:20:42.679 --> 02:20:43.599]  We'll re-download it.
[02:20:45.814 --> 02:20:47.034]  You don't need to see the clip.
[02:20:47.034 --> 02:20:56.936]  You see this crap every day, constantly, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.
[02:20:56.936 --> 02:21:02.478]  And so, black folks on average say, we're not going to take vaccines.
[02:21:02.478 --> 02:21:05.558]  We don't trust your secret history of experimenting on us.
[02:21:05.558 --> 02:21:08.839]  And they go, how about I give you some barbecue then?
[02:21:08.839 --> 02:21:13.220]  Oh, but it's a black person talking to black folks, so it's okay.
[02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:13.520]  Here it is.
[02:21:14.819 --> 02:21:18.261]  I'm black, and I'm British.
[02:21:18.261 --> 02:21:23.484]  Basically, I'm what the royal family was worried the baby would look like.
[02:21:23.484 --> 02:21:25.625]  Oh, isn't it funny?
[02:21:25.625 --> 02:21:27.767]  He's got a British accent, and I'm talking to an American.
[02:21:27.767 --> 02:21:28.687]  What's worse?
[02:21:28.687 --> 02:21:30.528]  British racism or American racism?
[02:21:30.528 --> 02:21:31.869]  American.
[02:21:31.869 --> 02:21:33.530]  Let me put it this way.
[02:21:33.530 --> 02:21:38.193]  British racism is so bad, white people left.
[02:21:38.193 --> 02:21:40.174]  They wanted to be free.
[02:21:40.174 --> 02:21:42.035]  Free to create their own kind of racism.
[02:21:43.220 --> 02:21:48.882]  So that's why they invented Australia, South Africa, and Boston.
[02:21:48.882 --> 02:21:55.784]  They place a doctor trying to convince black people.
[02:21:55.784 --> 02:22:01.385]  For $5,000, my next question is, will you take the vaccine right now?
[02:22:01.385 --> 02:22:03.526]  Hey, five racks.
[02:22:03.526 --> 02:22:05.486]  That's a lot of bread.
[02:22:05.486 --> 02:22:06.867]  I could get me a little girlfriend.
[02:22:06.867 --> 02:22:08.907]  And you could have a barbecue.
[02:22:08.907 --> 02:22:10.748]  You could have a barbecue completely vaccinated.
[02:22:11.770 --> 02:22:12.971]  Nah, it ain't worth it.
[02:22:12.971 --> 02:22:14.232]  What about you, Ashona?
[02:22:14.232 --> 02:22:15.773]  You know I can't take that vaccine.
[02:22:15.773 --> 02:22:16.913]  I am a Christian.
[02:22:16.913 --> 02:22:19.255]  Who told you Christians can't take the vaccine?
[02:22:19.255 --> 02:22:20.395]  Facebook!
[02:22:20.395 --> 02:22:25.599]  And then they have these black women speaking in an affected voice like they're idiots.
[02:22:25.599 --> 02:22:27.440]  Just turn it off.
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:32.503]  But see, a bunch of white people hire a black person to do that to black people, and that's the racism.
[02:22:32.503 --> 02:22:34.084]  That's talking to blacks like they're dumb.
[02:22:34.084 --> 02:22:37.226]  Well, I say blacks must be pretty damn smart, because they're thinking like I'm thinking right now.
[02:22:38.251 --> 02:22:41.132]  Because they don't want to die of cancer or be sterilized.
[02:22:41.132 --> 02:22:44.254]  Burn in hell, all you writers at SNL.
[02:22:44.254 --> 02:22:46.334]  Burn in hell, you little Nazis.
[02:22:46.334 --> 02:22:47.375]  You're the real Nazis.
[02:22:47.375 --> 02:22:49.976]  Burn!
[02:22:49.976 --> 02:22:57.299]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full wars I've had.
[02:22:57.299 --> 02:23:00.581]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[02:23:00.581 --> 02:23:01.361]  But I'll tell you this.
[02:23:02.882 --> 02:23:10.567]  The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[02:23:10.567 --> 02:23:12.948]  They're trying to shudder and silence human resistance.
[02:23:12.948 --> 02:23:18.552]  So, now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[02:23:18.552 --> 02:23:21.714]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[02:23:21.714 --> 02:23:24.496]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[02:23:24.496 --> 02:23:27.818]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't.
[02:23:28.869 --> 02:23:33.453]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[02:23:33.453 --> 02:23:35.174]  We have the power.
[02:23:35.174 --> 02:23:39.518]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[02:23:39.518 --> 02:23:45.122]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that long, dark night doesn't come.
[02:23:45.122 --> 02:23:50.587]  So be the Paul Revere's you are.
[02:23:50.587 --> 02:23:55.651]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[02:23:56.221 --> 02:23:59.504]  But world government is only the control grid.
[02:23:59.504 --> 02:24:07.050]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality.
[02:24:07.050 --> 02:24:14.075]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based life forms.
[02:24:14.075 --> 02:24:16.317]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[02:24:16.317 --> 02:24:20.060]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[02:24:20.060 --> 02:24:21.261]  They are playing God.
[02:24:21.921 --> 02:24:31.809]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[02:24:31.809 --> 02:24:37.093]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the Globalist, it's all on record.
[02:24:37.093 --> 02:24:38.214]  You have been warned.
[02:24:39.535 --> 02:24:43.998]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[02:24:43.998 --> 02:24:47.580]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[02:24:47.580 --> 02:24:50.621]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[02:24:50.621 --> 02:24:55.524]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[02:24:55.524 --> 02:24:57.545]  People ask me all the time, they go, Jones, are you on cocaine?
[02:24:57.545 --> 02:24:58.626]  Are you on meth?
[02:24:58.626 --> 02:25:00.006]  How are you so excited?
[02:25:00.006 --> 02:25:08.131]  How do I not get excited about world government, forced masks, forced inoculations, open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved?
[02:25:08.812 --> 02:25:10.053]  I'm sorry.
[02:25:10.053 --> 02:25:11.173]  I'm a fighter.
[02:25:11.173 --> 02:25:13.894]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[02:25:13.894 --> 02:25:16.035]  And so I'll just say this.
[02:25:16.035 --> 02:25:17.056]  I try to be calm.
[02:25:17.056 --> 02:25:18.997]  I try to be focused.
[02:25:18.997 --> 02:25:22.579]  I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't still on air right now.
[02:25:22.579 --> 02:25:25.260]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air.
[02:25:26.044 --> 02:25:31.125]  Because you have to realize, when I tell you that you're the InfoWar, that's not me patting you on the head.
[02:25:31.125 --> 02:25:34.846]  You are 99% of the equation.
[02:25:34.846 --> 02:25:42.608]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products at InfoWarStore.com, when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[02:25:42.608 --> 02:25:44.809]  So, you are the InfoWar.
[02:25:44.809 --> 02:25:46.429]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:47.709]  Thank you for all you've done.
[02:25:47.709 --> 02:25:50.150]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalists.
[02:25:50.845 --> 02:25:52.366]  The people are awakening.
[02:25:52.366 --> 02:25:55.088]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[02:25:55.088 --> 02:25:57.169]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[02:25:57.169 --> 02:25:59.510]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's hand-held.
[02:25:59.510 --> 02:26:08.896]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data.
[02:26:09.156 --> 02:26:17.759]  To be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[02:26:17.759 --> 02:26:24.441]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[02:26:24.441 --> 02:26:25.881]  In their own words, they admit it.
[02:26:25.881 --> 02:26:30.283]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and blocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[02:26:30.783 --> 02:26:32.744]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[02:26:32.744 --> 02:26:33.804]  They're Faraday cages.
[02:26:33.804 --> 02:26:35.504]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[02:26:35.504 --> 02:26:37.505]  They work absolutely great.
[02:26:37.505 --> 02:26:46.387]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.
[02:26:46.387 --> 02:26:53.668]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[02:26:53.668 --> 02:26:56.269]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:13.949 --> 02:27:25.132]  I'm about to show you footage from Good Friday, and we've got footage from Eastern as well, in the UK, in Germany, in the US, in Australia, saying, these churches are closed!
[02:27:25.132 --> 02:27:28.393]  Right down the street, Walmart and Target are open.
[02:27:28.393 --> 02:27:34.234]  Sheila Gunn-Reed was out on the street yesterday in Canada, where a major church has been shut down.
[02:27:34.234 --> 02:27:35.354]  The pastor's been arrested.
[02:27:35.354 --> 02:27:36.495]  They put a fence up around it.
[02:27:36.495 --> 02:27:37.675]  I want to get an update from her.
[02:27:37.675 --> 02:27:38.435]  We'll talk to her in a moment.
[02:27:38.435 --> 02:27:40.836]  But first, if I don't do this, we won't be here.
[02:27:40.836 --> 02:27:41.836]  Plus, these are great products.
[02:27:42.668 --> 02:27:43.769]  We don't have big sponsors.
[02:27:43.769 --> 02:27:44.830]  They took them all away.
[02:27:44.830 --> 02:27:51.216]  We've got a few small sponsors that maybe pay for 10% of what we need to fund the operation.
[02:27:51.216 --> 02:27:57.321]  90% of our funding is you buying t-shirts, books, films, water filtration, air filtration, and supplements.
[02:27:57.321 --> 02:28:02.646]  And everybody needs high-quality organic vitamin D3 for your immune system, your body, with what's going on.
[02:28:02.646 --> 02:28:03.987]  You always need it anyways.
[02:28:03.987 --> 02:28:06.590]  Everybody needs a multivitamin mineral.
[02:28:06.590 --> 02:28:09.092]  Liquid's the best with amino acids, and we have one of the best
[02:28:10.233 --> 02:28:12.674]  There's some other great ones out there, but we have one of the best out there.
[02:28:12.674 --> 02:28:13.875]  It's super high-grade.
[02:28:13.875 --> 02:28:15.716]  It's in the 95th percentile.
[02:28:15.716 --> 02:28:19.418]  There's some stuff that's like $200 a canister that's probably better, quite frankly.
[02:28:19.418 --> 02:28:30.363]  It's got a bunch of weird stuff added to it, but we've got it, and it's very inexpensive and very affordable, 40% off, Vitamin and Mineral Fusion, info-workstore.com.
[02:28:30.363 --> 02:28:38.927]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, all the amino acids, 40% off, about to sell out, despite that I'm keeping it at that price until it sells out in the next week, and back in stock
[02:28:40.126 --> 02:28:44.831]  Super high-end vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your body's defenses, your immune system.
[02:28:44.831 --> 02:28:52.698]  You can get them together for 50% off, Vitamin Refusion and Winter Sun, or get them separately 40% off together, infowarestore.com.
[02:28:52.698 --> 02:28:58.344]  But whatever you do, keep spreading the word because when it comes to reaching tens of millions of people,
[02:28:58.897 --> 02:29:01.558]  Thanks to you spreading the word and what we're doing, we're doing.
[02:29:01.558 --> 02:29:03.479]  I mean, wow!
[02:29:03.479 --> 02:29:07.021]  The last few weeks, it's been staggering.
[02:29:07.021 --> 02:29:10.763]  Despite all the censorship, despite all the attacks, the force is with us.
[02:29:10.763 --> 02:29:11.823]  The Holy Ghost is with us.
[02:29:11.823 --> 02:29:12.964]  We're doing some huge things.
[02:29:12.964 --> 02:29:17.426]  But financially, we're on E. And I want to expand.
[02:29:17.426 --> 02:29:21.088]  Man, I want to be permanently at the Texas border showing the collapse the next few months.
[02:29:21.088 --> 02:29:21.848]  And that's expensive.
[02:29:21.848 --> 02:29:23.969]  You know, thousands a day or more to have security.
[02:29:24.614 --> 02:29:30.075]  Five, six thousand dollars a day with everything to have a crew down there and people and insurance and, you know, a few security people.
[02:29:30.075 --> 02:29:32.216]  So we want to do this, but we need you to take action.
[02:29:32.216 --> 02:29:38.837]  So signal whether you want us to do this or not by going to Infowarshore.com and getting some of the t-shirts, the books, the films.
[02:29:38.837 --> 02:29:49.159]  And if I see a big boost in that today, I'm going to go ahead and pull the trigger and put a permanent team for the next, you know, five, six, seven months, a year on the border because the globalists do not want this scene and we're going to do it.
[02:29:50.496 --> 02:29:53.398]  Sheila Gunn-Reed joins us.
[02:29:53.398 --> 02:29:58.302]  Sheila Gunn-Reed on Twitter, rebelnews.com, and Ezra LeVant.
[02:29:58.302 --> 02:30:08.909]  For folks who just tuned in, a recap of what's happening, the church, what's unfolding, what's going on, then putting a big fence up around it, the pastor being arrested, recently released, and the latest information.
[02:30:08.909 --> 02:30:10.911]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:30:10.911 --> 02:30:14.893]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex, and thanks so much for your ongoing interest in this story.
[02:30:14.893 --> 02:30:19.777]  It's truly an international story, despite what the mainstream media in my home province would have you believe.
[02:30:20.646 --> 02:30:28.012]  This church has been the flashpoint for the fight for religious freedom in Canada during the pandemic.
[02:30:28.012 --> 02:30:39.862]  The pastor there, Pastor James Coates, was arrested and incarcerated for 35 days in a maximum security provincial facility for refusing to limit his congregation
[02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:46.501]  To 15% of fire code capacity, as per the public health orders here in Alberta.
[02:30:46.501 --> 02:30:47.421]  He refused to comply.
[02:30:47.421 --> 02:30:49.362]  He said it violated his religious freedom.
[02:30:49.362 --> 02:30:50.762]  So he was taken into custody.
[02:30:50.762 --> 02:30:53.462]  He's been released now.
[02:30:53.462 --> 02:30:56.883]  But the crackdown on his church has not stopped.
[02:30:56.883 --> 02:31:04.904]  And let's be clear, this 50% is stand on your head, jump on one leg, it's all just arbitrary submission to the state.
[02:31:04.904 --> 02:31:07.565]  That you're not essential, Walmart's essential, but you're not.
[02:31:08.820 --> 02:31:14.986]  Yes, that's an interesting point that you're pointing out there, Alex, because it's 15, 1.5% of fire code capacity.
[02:31:14.986 --> 02:31:21.912]  But the Walmart up the road, but the Costco up the road, they can operate at 30% of fire code capacity.
[02:31:21.912 --> 02:31:23.594]  So this virus is truly amazing.
[02:31:23.594 --> 02:31:27.257]  It knows if you're going to Walmart or if you're going to praise God.
[02:31:27.257 --> 02:31:28.819]  Now, yesterday morning, the
[02:31:30.738 --> 02:31:46.111]  Local RCMP, so that's our Federal Police Force, plus the Provincial Health Authority, Alberta Health Services, and a private security contractor, Paladin, plus a private fencing contractor showed up.
[02:31:47.118 --> 02:31:54.623]  I got alerted by members of the congregation who caught it all happening on the security cameras that are affixed to the church.
[02:31:54.623 --> 02:31:58.145]  They saw the police execute this raid.
[02:31:58.145 --> 02:32:00.546]  They started erecting fences.
[02:32:00.546 --> 02:32:04.229]  There's actually two that are blocking off the church building as you see there.
[02:32:04.229 --> 02:32:10.572]  And then there's black tarping that obscures the fact that this was ever even a church in the first place.
[02:32:10.572 --> 02:32:14.575]  Basically what they've done is they've put this church in a mask
[02:32:14.995 --> 02:32:21.381]  Because the government could not force the congregation to wear one, and they've put up police checkpoints at the end of the driveway.
[02:32:21.381 --> 02:32:21.861]  That's a great point.
[02:32:21.861 --> 02:32:25.204]  They literally muzzled the church with a black tarp.
[02:32:25.204 --> 02:32:34.092]  Yes, and now as you can see there in that footage, they've put up a police checkpoint at the end of the driveway to prevent people from even accessing the church property.
[02:32:34.092 --> 02:32:38.135]  And this, I want to point out, this is private property.
[02:32:38.135 --> 02:32:39.517]  This is the state.
[02:32:40.177 --> 02:32:47.642]  Seizing the private property of Canadian citizens because they won't comply with these public health orders.
[02:32:47.642 --> 02:32:53.005]  And by the way, everybody overuses the Nazi analogies or the communist analogies, but this goes on in communist China.
[02:32:53.005 --> 02:32:54.546]  I mean, this is as bad as it gets.
[02:32:54.546 --> 02:32:58.148]  This is, on a scale of 1 to 10, it's like an 8.
[02:32:58.148 --> 02:33:00.709]  A 10 would be mowing the people down with guns.
[02:33:00.709 --> 02:33:04.392]  I mean, this is unbelievably outrageous.
[02:33:04.392 --> 02:33:07.834]  Yeah, this is something that I would imagine that we would see
[02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:14.645]  It's happening to Christian churches in Hong Kong as the CCP continues to crack down on Christians there.
[02:33:14.645 --> 02:33:18.147]  It's not something that I thought that I would ever see in my home province.
[02:33:18.147 --> 02:33:26.674]  This is the kind of thing that I witnessed when I was in northern Iraq documenting the plight of the Christians there, the persecutions of the Christians there.
[02:33:26.674 --> 02:33:27.595]  But I never thought
[02:33:28.235 --> 02:33:31.078]  That I would see this happening in my home province.
[02:33:31.078 --> 02:33:36.785]  Well, Sheila Gunread, I never thought I'd see your Prime Minister endorse quote, dictatorship.
[02:33:36.785 --> 02:33:38.507]  He says, I want Chinese dictatorship.
[02:33:38.507 --> 02:33:43.031]  I mean, this is just people are always historically they get hit by tyranny that lived in freedom.
[02:33:43.031 --> 02:33:45.014]  Can't believe it until it's run over them.
[02:33:45.014 --> 02:33:47.276]  I mean, but we're in the process of being run over right now.
[02:33:47.276 --> 02:33:47.977]  This is happening.
[02:33:49.265 --> 02:33:51.487]  Well, and where do they go from here?
[02:33:51.487 --> 02:34:06.257]  So, as someone who pays close attention to this, I thought when the pastor was released from jail, when they were able to reach an agreement to get the pastor out of jail, because the pastor was going to stay in jail for months,
[02:34:06.781 --> 02:34:17.450]  Because a condition of his bail was that he had to abide by the public health orders that put him there in the first place, and he said, I'll be a prisoner of conscience then, I can't abide by those.
[02:34:17.450 --> 02:34:22.475]  So a deal was struck, that pastor was released from jail, and I thought that was the end of this.
[02:34:23.115 --> 02:34:26.876]  Now they've escalated it to seizing the church property.
[02:34:26.876 --> 02:34:28.576]  Where do they go from here?
[02:34:28.576 --> 02:34:29.177]  Let me be clear.
[02:34:29.177 --> 02:34:32.277]  I'm about to say this bold move is run by the globalists.
[02:34:32.277 --> 02:34:39.459]  This has been decided at the Soros, Xi Jinping level, so that what's happening here is coming to us tomorrow, next week, next year.
[02:34:39.459 --> 02:34:40.839]  That's why you're so important right now.
[02:34:40.839 --> 02:34:42.300]  You're like, thanks for having me on.
[02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:43.480]  Are you kidding?
[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:44.440]  My God!
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:46.861]  The only thing is they're not burning it down like Waco right now.
[02:34:46.861 --> 02:34:47.801]  This is incredible.
[02:34:48.925 --> 02:34:52.808]  Well, and that's the thing, I don't really know where they go from here.
[02:34:52.808 --> 02:35:00.132]  For the government to do this, it's clear that they grossly misunderstand Christian theology and the Christian tradition.
[02:35:00.132 --> 02:35:09.018]  Because when they took the pastor to jail, the associate pastor got on the pulpit the following week and preached to a full capacity.
[02:35:09.018 --> 02:35:13.301]  Because he knew that that was what he was supposed to do and he was willing to go to jail
[02:35:13.761 --> 02:35:16.363]  And serving a cell right beside the other pastor.
[02:35:16.363 --> 02:35:22.788]  So the government thinks that seizing the church property is going to stop the church from gathering.
[02:35:22.788 --> 02:35:24.189]  Boy, they're in a staring contest.
[02:35:24.189 --> 02:35:26.351]  They are going to lose, Alex.
[02:35:26.351 --> 02:35:27.452]  But they are followed.
[02:35:27.452 --> 02:35:30.714]  They're a bunch of followers and they're run by evil.
[02:35:30.714 --> 02:35:32.536]  That's why they can't help themselves.
[02:35:32.536 --> 02:35:40.262]  Here is the incredible footage of the Prime Minister of the great country of Canada saying he endorses the CCP and total dictatorship.
[02:35:40.262 --> 02:35:40.542]  Hear this.
[02:35:41.224 --> 02:35:47.568]  The level of admiration I actually have for China.
[02:35:47.568 --> 02:35:59.554]  Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, we need to go green as fast as we need to start, you know, investing in solar.
[02:35:59.554 --> 02:36:05.738]  I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted.
[02:36:05.738 --> 02:36:08.099]  That I find quite interesting.
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:16.624]  So, we're going to go to break and back with our guest for another segment ahead of Jay Dyer with a huge, sparse 2025-2028 report.
[02:36:16.624 --> 02:36:17.865]  But, it's even a lie.
[02:36:17.865 --> 02:36:20.606]  They don't do any of the carbon taxes or any of the carbon cuts.
[02:36:20.606 --> 02:36:31.612]  So, everything he used to endorse dictatorship, then he said, oh, China did all this to save us from greenhouse gases and they're the ones building a new coal power plant with no scrubbers every week, while all our clean ones have been shut down.
[02:36:31.612 --> 02:36:35.414]  So, you can't do business here because energy is too expensive.
[02:36:35.414 --> 02:36:36.435]  We're in checkmate, folks.
[02:36:36.435 --> 02:36:36.955]  It's so sad.
[02:36:38.271 --> 02:36:40.993]  It's all spiritual, so we'll make it through to the end.
[02:36:40.993 --> 02:36:43.595]  We'll be right back with our special guest, Sheila Gunn-Reid.
[02:36:43.595 --> 02:36:50.239]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:36:50.239 --> 02:36:53.061]  The equation is very simple.
[02:36:53.061 --> 02:37:02.627]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech.
[02:37:03.769 --> 02:37:12.896]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[02:37:12.896 --> 02:37:21.362]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[02:37:21.362 --> 02:37:28.127]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down, and use
[02:37:28.967 --> 02:37:37.050]  The idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[02:37:37.050 --> 02:37:41.692]  That's why they target InfoWars, because we understand the key to defeating them.
[02:37:41.692 --> 02:37:46.934]  The only way our transmission gets out is if you promote InfoWars and ban that video.
[02:37:46.934 --> 02:37:47.894]  So redouble your efforts.
[02:37:47.894 --> 02:37:48.955]  We're all in this together.
[02:37:50.695 --> 02:37:55.860]  Throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[02:37:55.860 --> 02:37:58.903]  One is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[02:37:58.903 --> 02:38:07.971]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity and art and skill and strength.
[02:38:07.971 --> 02:38:13.355]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[02:38:14.316 --> 02:38:22.423]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[02:38:22.423 --> 02:38:26.025]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[02:38:26.025 --> 02:38:30.289]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[02:38:30.849 --> 02:38:32.631]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[02:38:32.631 --> 02:38:35.994]  It's already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[02:38:35.994 --> 02:38:38.176]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[02:38:38.176 --> 02:38:46.023]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[02:38:46.023 --> 02:38:46.824]  That's the facts.
[02:38:46.824 --> 02:38:48.845]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[02:38:48.845 --> 02:38:56.112]  Granny do right.
[02:38:56.112 --> 02:38:56.933]  Granny do right.
[02:38:56.933 --> 02:38:57.193]  Thanks for
[02:38:59.667 --> 02:39:01.707]  Let me say, I love your products.
[02:39:01.707 --> 02:39:12.410]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[02:39:12.410 --> 02:39:18.411]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[02:39:18.411 --> 02:39:19.432]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[02:39:21.692 --> 02:39:29.417]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[02:39:29.417 --> 02:39:38.163]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[02:39:38.163 --> 02:39:39.003]  This is working.
[02:39:39.003 --> 02:39:39.984]  This is wonderful.
[02:39:39.984 --> 02:39:44.527]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[02:39:44.527 --> 02:39:49.170]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[02:39:51.267 --> 02:39:54.995]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[02:39:54.995 --> 02:39:58.722]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[02:39:58.722 --> 02:40:01.327]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[02:40:01.974 --> 02:40:06.358]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:40:06.358 --> 02:40:12.123]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[02:40:12.123 --> 02:40:23.713]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[02:40:24.333 --> 02:40:26.474]  I need your help more than ever now.
[02:40:26.474 --> 02:40:30.575]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[02:40:30.575 --> 02:40:41.178]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast, however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarestore.com.
[02:40:41.178 --> 02:40:50.721]  Whether it's high-quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[02:40:50.721 --> 02:40:51.361]  Thank you so much.
[02:40:53.599 --> 02:41:02.303]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:02.303 --> 02:41:13.269]  You got no when to hold up, no when to fold up, no when to walk away, and no when to run.
[02:41:13.269 --> 02:41:15.330]  You never count your money.
[02:41:15.330 --> 02:41:20.312]  When you're sitting at the table, there'll be time enough
[02:41:22.498 --> 02:41:27.991]  When the deal is done, you got no wind to hold them.
[02:41:27.991 --> 02:41:29.474]  No wind to fall them.
[02:41:34.485 --> 02:41:37.466]  A lot's happening.
[02:41:37.466 --> 02:41:39.446]  There's a lot of big stories on InfoWars.com.
[02:41:39.446 --> 02:41:45.047]  We haven't had time to cover, but one of the top British authors ever has come out and said this is a police state.
[02:41:45.047 --> 02:41:45.707]  It's a takeover.
[02:41:45.707 --> 02:41:46.287]  It's criminal.
[02:41:46.287 --> 02:41:46.887]  It's illegal.
[02:41:46.887 --> 02:41:48.128]  It's fear-mongering.
[02:41:48.128 --> 02:41:49.068]  And big tech runs it.
[02:41:49.068 --> 02:41:51.388]  I'll tell you about that after our guest leaves us.
[02:41:51.388 --> 02:41:55.329]  And Jay Dyer is a great researcher.
[02:41:55.329 --> 02:42:00.830]  And he's really good at taking research that's been done and expanding on it and just really laying it out good.
[02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:02.650]  Because we never territorialize research.
[02:42:03.408 --> 02:42:05.769]  So many people say, oh, you know, you covered some research.
[02:42:05.769 --> 02:42:06.610]  Somebody else did great.
[02:42:06.610 --> 02:42:08.390]  I hope somebody else covers it when I did it.
[02:42:08.390 --> 02:42:10.391]  Or, oh, Jay Dyer is about to cover what you covered.
[02:42:10.391 --> 02:42:11.132]  Is that all right?
[02:42:11.132 --> 02:42:14.253]  Abso-fricking-lutely, this is not territorialization.
[02:42:14.253 --> 02:42:17.835]  I'm glad Lister's three weeks ago told us to look into SPARS 2025-2028.
[02:42:17.835 --> 02:42:19.315]  We did.
[02:42:19.315 --> 02:42:19.896]  We put it out.
[02:42:19.896 --> 02:42:21.416]  It's gone mega-viral.
[02:42:21.416 --> 02:42:26.239]  The former head of Defense Intelligence, former National Security Advisor to the President, endorsed it.
[02:42:26.239 --> 02:42:27.099]  Said you should watch it.
[02:42:27.099 --> 02:42:28.079]  You should see it.
[02:42:28.079 --> 02:42:29.200]  And Jay Dyer's coming up.
[02:42:29.873 --> 02:42:34.914]  In the next hour, with his great research, I can't wait to see his view on it.
[02:42:34.914 --> 02:42:36.755]  And I can't wait to see your view on it.
[02:42:36.755 --> 02:42:42.557]  You should all shoot videos on this, because it's so incredibly important.
[02:42:42.557 --> 02:42:48.198]  I brought the territorialization because, you know, I see this when we do this.
[02:42:48.198 --> 02:42:53.540]  It's like, it isn't about who first broke it.
[02:42:53.540 --> 02:42:54.820]  It's about getting it out to everybody.
[02:42:56.207 --> 02:42:59.788]  Emergency Saturday Broadcast World Shocked by Spars 2025-2028 Document.
[02:42:59.788 --> 02:43:00.088]  2,773,000 views.
[02:43:00.088 --> 02:43:01.008]  Well, that sounds great at Bandot Video.
[02:43:01.008 --> 02:43:02.669]  It needs 100 million views and we beat these people.
[02:43:02.669 --> 02:43:03.549]  It's all right there.
[02:43:03.549 --> 02:43:05.229]  But 2 million is a good start.
[02:43:17.270 --> 02:43:27.856]  But I'm not doing this and putting my life on the line and flying a helicopter right on the Mexican border where they shoot at helicopters and doing all this to, like, lose.
[02:43:27.856 --> 02:43:31.238]  I'm not all in skin in the game with half measures.
[02:43:31.238 --> 02:43:33.639]  We're going to win.
[02:43:33.639 --> 02:43:40.323]  But you've got to throw caution to the wind here, folks, and use the power you have to spread the word.
[02:43:41.863 --> 02:43:45.766]  So going back to Sheila Gunnreid, who's a great lady, but notice she has that Christian humble.
[02:43:45.766 --> 02:43:54.192]  She's like, thanks for caring that our big giant church shut down for six months, arrested the pastor, put a fence up with 50 cops and security.
[02:43:54.192 --> 02:43:59.116]  He's like, thanks for covering Waco being blown up, or thanks for covering World War II.
[02:43:59.116 --> 02:44:01.938]  I mean, you are what's happening to all of us.
[02:44:01.938 --> 02:44:03.059]  We're in this together.
[02:44:03.559 --> 02:44:07.882]  This is outrageous, so what other points, and I'm not putting you down for like, just shows you're humble as well.
[02:44:07.882 --> 02:44:09.462]  Thanks for covering what's happening.
[02:44:09.462 --> 02:44:12.404]  We should, every church should be upset.
[02:44:12.404 --> 02:44:14.085]  Every mosque should be upset.
[02:44:14.085 --> 02:44:15.946]  Every synagogue should be upset.
[02:44:15.946 --> 02:44:18.928]  Every Buddhist temple should be upset.
[02:44:18.928 --> 02:44:22.110]  If we don't have religious freedom, we have nothing!
[02:44:22.110 --> 02:44:22.810]  Go ahead, please.
[02:44:24.981 --> 02:44:31.325]  Alex, it's funny that you mentioned, you know, Waco and really that's how this church is being treated right now.
[02:44:31.325 --> 02:44:33.766]  It's being treated like an active shooter event.
[02:44:33.766 --> 02:44:38.749]  I'll break some news to you right now that came in to me on my cell phone while I was on break.
[02:44:38.749 --> 02:44:43.151]  Besides the fact that there's a police checkpoint at the end of the driveway there and 24 hour a day
[02:44:44.685 --> 02:44:46.566]  surveillance on the church.
[02:44:46.566 --> 02:44:52.569]  They basically set up a command center outside of this church to make sure that nobody can access it.
[02:44:52.569 --> 02:45:01.713]  But I'm receiving text messages from people who are there right now and when I'm off air with you I'm going to zip out back up to the church to cover it.
[02:45:01.713 --> 02:45:08.175]  But there are people there who camped out overnight there and it's not very nice weather here.
[02:45:08.175 --> 02:45:10.356]  It's northern Alberta, it's pretty cold.
[02:45:10.356 --> 02:45:11.837]  But they spent the night in tents
[02:45:12.695 --> 02:45:15.256]  Because as long as the police are going to be there, they're there.
[02:45:15.256 --> 02:45:19.638]  And they said now the police are blocking off the public road.
[02:45:19.638 --> 02:45:23.279]  Exactly, because they're scared because their attempted intimidations backfired.
[02:45:23.279 --> 02:45:25.220]  They should be the Christian Woodstock.
[02:45:25.220 --> 02:45:26.781]  Everyone in Canada can get there.
[02:45:26.781 --> 02:45:30.102]  I'd say the U.S., but your borders are so controlled, plus you're a legal alien.
[02:45:30.102 --> 02:45:37.905]  Everyone should go there, bring pizzas, bring barbecues, bring... I think if 20,000 people show up, it will turn the tide against this tyranny.
[02:45:37.905 --> 02:45:38.665]  Don't you agree?
[02:45:38.665 --> 02:45:39.526]  Everyone should come there.
[02:45:39.526 --> 02:45:40.206]  Tell us where it is.
[02:45:41.502 --> 02:45:46.486]  So, that church is just west of the capital city of Edmonton, Alberta.
[02:45:46.486 --> 02:45:50.249]  It's really, you know, just a couple of miles outside of the city limits.
[02:45:50.249 --> 02:45:53.191]  It's very easy to get to.
[02:45:53.191 --> 02:45:55.533]  And, you know, there's a public road right there.
[02:45:55.533 --> 02:45:57.295]  You can get there and there's a landowner.
[02:45:57.295 --> 02:45:58.876]  And for those listening, they must go now.
[02:45:58.876 --> 02:45:59.857]  What is the name?
[02:45:59.857 --> 02:46:00.958]  What is the address?
[02:46:00.958 --> 02:46:02.359]  Everyone must go now.
[02:46:03.493 --> 02:46:14.563]  It's Grace Life Church, west of Edmonton, and there's a property owner right next door who is allowing supporters and congregants and anybody involved with the church to stand on his property.
[02:46:14.563 --> 02:46:15.403]  And there's no excuses, folks.
[02:46:15.403 --> 02:46:17.325]  I feel a disturbance in the force here.
[02:46:17.325 --> 02:46:19.327]  I already felt this yesterday.
[02:46:19.327 --> 02:46:21.088]  I said, I need to come to Canada, but they won't let me in.
[02:46:21.088 --> 02:46:25.272]  I covered Bilderberg, they arrested me, put me in jail for a day, all of it, but it was okay.
[02:46:25.272 --> 02:46:26.453]  Maybe I should get arrested coming.
[02:46:26.733 --> 02:46:29.214]  But everyone should come there and stand.
[02:46:29.214 --> 02:46:31.015]  This is a New Tiananmen Square.
[02:46:31.015 --> 02:46:35.737]  This is literally a Communist China-style Uyghur takeover in America.
[02:46:35.737 --> 02:46:37.658]  So guys, punch up the church's address.
[02:46:37.658 --> 02:46:38.979]  I want to give the actual address.
[02:46:38.979 --> 02:46:40.199]  No excuses!
[02:46:40.199 --> 02:46:41.400]  Grace Wife!
[02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:46.282]  Everybody needs to go there now, peacefully.
[02:46:46.282 --> 02:46:47.082]  Blow that up for me.
[02:46:47.082 --> 02:46:48.083]  I don't mean physically blow it.
[02:46:48.083 --> 02:46:49.243]  I'll say, Jones said blow a church up.
[02:46:49.243 --> 02:46:50.144]  I mean, blow it up.
[02:46:50.144 --> 02:46:50.784]  I can't read that.
[02:46:50.784 --> 02:46:53.005]  Just show me the address on screen.
[02:46:53.005 --> 02:46:54.546]  My eyes are not that good anymore.
[02:46:56.067 --> 02:46:58.611]  It's 51520 or 51529 A Range Road, 262 Spruce Grove, AB.
[02:46:58.611 --> 02:46:59.132]  Is that right?
[02:46:59.132 --> 02:46:59.232]  Yes.
[02:47:08.820 --> 02:47:10.361]  All right, so here's the deal.
[02:47:10.361 --> 02:47:17.743]  Instead of being like, and I'm not putting you down because you're just like me, you're like, oh, thanks for caring that they've put a fence up and arrested the preacher.
[02:47:17.743 --> 02:47:18.664]  Thanks for caring.
[02:47:18.664 --> 02:47:21.145]  We're under attack, okay?
[02:47:21.145 --> 02:47:22.685]  You're under attack, so are we.
[02:47:22.685 --> 02:47:24.326]  All of us need to go there.
[02:47:24.326 --> 02:47:32.709]  If you're in Canada or if you're near the border, you get in legally, go there peacefully, give aid and comfort to Christians under CHICOM, governor,
[02:47:33.409 --> 02:47:35.391]  Attack the CHICOM agent.
[02:47:35.391 --> 02:47:38.954]  I just showed you him pledging allegiance to Xi Jinping, Trudeau.
[02:47:38.954 --> 02:47:40.055]  Everyone should go there.
[02:47:40.055 --> 02:47:41.696]  So they're scared, aren't they?
[02:47:41.696 --> 02:47:42.937]  They're now trying to block the road.
[02:47:42.937 --> 02:47:44.559]  Tell us what's happening.
[02:47:44.559 --> 02:47:46.781]  Yes, so they're trying to block off that main road.
[02:47:46.781 --> 02:47:53.726]  So on the little map there, you can see that there's a highway that runs right by and then there's a public road that comes down in front of the church.
[02:47:53.726 --> 02:47:56.689]  They're blocking that off at the highway, it sounds like.
[02:47:57.387 --> 02:48:04.635]  And what that does is it actually cuts off all the residents and landowners from accessing their land in the subdivision adjacent there.
[02:48:04.635 --> 02:48:05.977]  So they're in full panic mode.
[02:48:05.977 --> 02:48:08.800]  They're blocking off major roads now.
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:09.280]  Yes.
[02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:10.161]  That's what it sounds like.
[02:48:10.161 --> 02:48:15.047]  That's the reports that I'm getting from people who are there right now on the scene that they're blocking off the main road.
[02:48:15.047 --> 02:48:16.008]  So they're in full panic mode.
[02:48:16.008 --> 02:48:16.709]  So let me guess.
[02:48:16.709 --> 02:48:18.751]  If a hundred were out there yesterday, is it bigger today?
[02:48:20.208 --> 02:48:21.149]  Yes.
[02:48:21.149 --> 02:48:24.611]  The weather's worse today, but it sounds like there are more people there today.
[02:48:24.611 --> 02:48:27.993]  And there were people there, Alex, all night long.
[02:48:27.993 --> 02:48:31.015]  It got dark, it got cold, and people just kept coming and coming.
[02:48:31.015 --> 02:48:32.976]  And the leftists want their great evil.
[02:48:32.976 --> 02:48:35.918]  They can't believe you're not submitting.
[02:48:35.918 --> 02:48:42.021]  Alex, I've never ever seen overt Satanism in real life before.
[02:48:42.021 --> 02:48:44.042]  You told me one of them said Satan is good.
[02:48:44.042 --> 02:48:44.783]  Tell people about that.
[02:48:46.115 --> 02:48:48.596]  I've never seen overt Satanism like that.
[02:48:48.596 --> 02:49:01.879]  As you and I both know, the enemy works through all kinds of people, but this person drove by in a pickup truck, screamed at women and children whose church they're looking at being locked up.
[02:49:01.879 --> 02:49:10.061]  So they're distraught, and this guy screams at them that he's happy that their church is being closed, and then he yells at other people
[02:49:11.684 --> 02:49:18.927]  And he says to them, even the church of Satan follows masking laws, and that's why you should too.
[02:49:18.927 --> 02:49:29.091]  As a Christian, if you're telling me that Satan likes it, I'm more inclined to not do it, but that's the level of public discourse here, that the Satanists are telling the Christians the moral things to do.
[02:49:29.091 --> 02:49:29.992]  Well, I'm telling my listeners.
[02:49:29.992 --> 02:49:30.392]  I'm telling them.
[02:49:30.852 --> 02:49:40.754]  If you live in Canada, whether you're 500 miles away or 20, you must go there, bring some muffins, bring some food, support these great people, because the system has drawn the line here.
[02:49:40.754 --> 02:49:43.675]  The enemy has drawn a line at your church.
[02:49:43.675 --> 02:49:51.057]  The enemy's drawn a line and said, and so they've chosen this as their Stalingrad, and I think we should make this their Stalingrad.
[02:49:52.751 --> 02:50:01.917]  Well, and it's very disappointing to see some of the other pastors in the area say, well, why isn't this church making the same sacrifices that I am?
[02:50:01.917 --> 02:50:05.279]  Oh, they're making a sacrifice not to be shut down.
[02:50:05.279 --> 02:50:07.361]  They're making a sacrifice to traffic kids.
[02:50:07.361 --> 02:50:09.362]  They're making a sacrifice to submit.
[02:50:09.362 --> 02:50:14.406]  Those aren't real churches, and God knows it.
[02:50:14.406 --> 02:50:18.748]  These other pastors, I mean, if they can reconcile... These aren't pastors.
[02:50:18.748 --> 02:50:22.291]  These are World Council of Churches Rockefeller pimps.
[02:50:23.874 --> 02:50:29.919]  Well, they can reconcile with themselves and their congregations that they can be both obedient to the state and to God.
[02:50:29.919 --> 02:50:30.780]  That's fine.
[02:50:30.780 --> 02:50:35.084]  But this is a free country, and we still have freedom of religion, and they don't get to make those decisions.
[02:50:35.084 --> 02:50:38.787]  Well, I predict they've shut that road down because thousands are massing.
[02:50:38.787 --> 02:50:39.307]  I feel it.
[02:50:39.307 --> 02:50:40.108]  I see it.
[02:50:40.108 --> 02:50:43.071]  I think there'll be 5,000 people tomorrow, 10,000 this weekend.
[02:50:43.071 --> 02:50:44.992]  I think they've jumped the shark.
[02:50:44.992 --> 02:50:45.453]  Call!
[02:50:45.453 --> 02:50:46.333]  You need to do it!
[02:50:46.333 --> 02:50:48.035]  Beautiful, beautiful soul.
[02:50:48.035 --> 02:50:50.637]  Tell people, Sheila Gunn-Reid, come peacefully now!
[02:50:50.637 --> 02:50:51.258]  Call them!
[02:50:51.258 --> 02:50:51.558]  Tell them!
[02:50:52.609 --> 02:50:56.712]  If people are going to come to support Grace Life, they welcome the support.
[02:50:56.712 --> 02:51:03.778]  But if you're coming, come peacefully and come respectfully, but they would appreciate your support.
[02:51:03.778 --> 02:51:06.120]  They need it now more than ever.
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:09.563]  Their church has been seized by the state.
[02:51:09.563 --> 02:51:11.304]  They need all the support that they can get.
[02:51:11.304 --> 02:51:14.687]  Obviously we want to be peaceful, but we need you to call them, say, help us, call them.
[02:51:16.030 --> 02:51:17.711]  Well, I don't want to speak for the church, Alex.
[02:51:17.711 --> 02:51:19.313]  I really don't want to speak for you as a reporter.
[02:51:19.313 --> 02:51:23.496]  But just as a Canadian, as a human, I'm just saying, everyone needs to hear you call for that.
[02:51:23.496 --> 02:51:24.757]  I'm calling for it.
[02:51:24.757 --> 02:51:27.700]  We call for people to stand up for religious freedom.
[02:51:27.700 --> 02:51:28.781]  Absolutely.
[02:51:28.781 --> 02:51:30.242]  It's something that I've always done.
[02:51:30.242 --> 02:51:35.166]  I'm headed there right after I get off the air with you, Alex, and I'll be there on Sunday also.
[02:51:35.166 --> 02:51:35.846]  We'll be right back.

[02:52:40.629 --> 02:52:42.190]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[02:52:42.190 --> 02:52:42.931]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:52:42.931 --> 02:52:43.691]  Trying to move quicker.
[02:52:43.691 --> 02:52:44.512]  Hey, Alex.
[02:52:44.512 --> 02:52:44.952]  Welcome.
[02:52:44.952 --> 02:52:50.116]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[02:52:50.116 --> 02:52:53.499]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[02:52:53.499 --> 02:52:59.964]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[02:52:59.964 --> 02:53:01.625]  Living Defense saved my life.
[02:53:01.625 --> 02:53:05.768]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[02:53:05.768 --> 02:53:07.209]  Living Defense brought me back.
[02:53:07.489 --> 02:53:13.012]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[02:53:13.012 --> 02:53:13.813]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[02:53:13.813 --> 02:53:14.693]  I'm not trying to.
[02:53:14.693 --> 02:53:16.454]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[02:53:31.883 --> 02:53:43.572]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[02:53:43.572 --> 02:53:46.235]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:57.123 --> 02:53:59.727]  Sheila Dungreed is our guest.
[02:53:59.727 --> 02:54:02.792]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:54:02.792 --> 02:54:08.760]  Jay Dyer's about to break down the big enchilada that Bill Gates just responded to us.
[02:54:08.760 --> 02:54:10.202]  No, Bill Gates just responded to us.
[02:54:12.268 --> 02:54:14.730]  So that's coming up next segment.
[02:54:14.730 --> 02:54:17.752]  But Sheila Gunn-Reid, I've been ranting and raving.
[02:54:17.752 --> 02:54:18.793]  You're there in Canada.
[02:54:18.793 --> 02:54:19.714]  You're covering this.
[02:54:19.714 --> 02:54:21.195]  Thousands are obviously on their way.
[02:54:21.195 --> 02:54:22.997]  Thousands have already shown up.
[02:54:22.997 --> 02:54:24.318]  They're trying to shut down roads.
[02:54:24.318 --> 02:54:27.480]  This is huge.
[02:54:27.480 --> 02:54:31.743]  Other closing comments in the four minutes we have left?
[02:54:31.743 --> 02:54:36.787]  For me, I have an interview coming up, an exclusive interview with Pastor Coates.
[02:54:36.787 --> 02:54:39.289]  That's the pastor of this church who was imprisoned for 35 days.
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:48.583]  I got his first reactions upon pulling up on the scene and seeing what has become of his church.
[02:54:48.583 --> 02:54:54.945]  They basically turned his church into the prison where they held him for 35 days.
[02:54:54.945 --> 02:54:59.527]  So we got his initial reactions to just how shocking that is.
[02:54:59.527 --> 02:55:03.408]  And the church is currently making plans for what happens on Sunday.
[02:55:03.408 --> 02:55:05.049]  So when I head back out there today, Alex,
[02:55:06.849 --> 02:55:12.531]  I'm going to find out what comes on Sunday, how they're going to hold service, because they are definitely going to hold service.
[02:55:12.531 --> 02:55:14.572]  You cannot keep this church down.
[02:55:14.572 --> 02:55:21.595]  Oh, I mean, I'm predicting, just with a neighbor that's a patriot, you'll have five times the congregation in the field, so what if it's snowing?
[02:55:23.092 --> 02:55:24.653]  Yeah, well, and that's the thing.
[02:55:24.653 --> 02:55:32.020]  This church says, you know, they're one of those congregations who sees good things in even the worst of things.
[02:55:32.020 --> 02:55:40.828]  They say that the fact that they have been basically purged from their own church means that they don't even have to abide by fire code capacity.
[02:55:40.828 --> 02:55:48.955]  So if they're forced outside, as many that want to come can come and they can evangelize to many more people.
[02:55:49.175 --> 02:55:49.655]  Well, that's right.
[02:55:49.655 --> 02:55:52.158]  The globalists are trying to break the church's will.
[02:55:52.158 --> 02:55:59.164]  So whether you're Protestant, whether you're Catholic, I don't care if you're a Buddhist or a Muslim, everybody should support religious freedom.
[02:55:59.164 --> 02:56:01.727]  And if people don't support this, then it's on them.
[02:56:01.727 --> 02:56:03.468]  This is unbelievable.
[02:56:03.468 --> 02:56:06.251]  And it's happening all over Canada, but this church has stood up.
[02:56:08.350 --> 02:56:12.734]  They have, and this church has exhibited such dignity when they're dealing with the police.
[02:56:12.734 --> 02:56:24.064]  I saw yesterday that this church went over and invited the cops who were locking down their church to attend their services on Sunday.
[02:56:24.064 --> 02:56:30.030]  They don't have an ounce of anger or resentment for the cops in their heart.
[02:56:30.030 --> 02:56:32.512]  They have nothing but forgiveness and kindness.
[02:56:32.512 --> 02:56:33.673]  I'm not there yet, Alex.
[02:56:34.834 --> 02:56:39.597]  Maybe if I spend more time with them, maybe they'll change my heart a little bit, too.
[02:56:39.597 --> 02:56:42.459]  But that's the kind of people they are.
[02:56:42.459 --> 02:56:43.519]  They won't be deterred.
[02:56:43.519 --> 02:56:47.382]  They're not angry, but they are called by Christ to gather, and they will gather.
[02:56:47.382 --> 02:56:49.803]  Well, that's right.
[02:56:49.803 --> 02:56:51.825]  There's a time to reap a type of show.
[02:56:52.757 --> 02:57:00.803]  Time to live, time to die, and I just know that evil is throwing its full weight against us because we didn't stand up against it, so now it's making its move.
[02:57:00.803 --> 02:57:03.946]  But people shouldn't get demoralized seeing all this evil and feel weak.
[02:57:03.946 --> 02:57:05.987]  This is God's plan being fulfilled.
[02:57:05.987 --> 02:57:10.731]  We are world government, world ID, to buy and sell a mark.
[02:57:10.731 --> 02:57:16.836]  I mean, this is time to rejoice that actually everything we were told is coming true, and we know God is at the other end of this.
[02:57:18.433 --> 02:57:23.318]  Yeah, it's the time to separate the wheat from the chaff, especially with our spiritual leaders.
[02:57:23.318 --> 02:57:32.728]  We can see men of integrity and conscience like Pastor James Coates at Grace Life, and we can see the other men of the cloth who are condemning them.
[02:57:32.728 --> 02:57:41.296]  For a lot of Christians, this is a real eye-opener, because they're finding out that their leaders of their church are not the men that they thought they were.
[02:57:41.296 --> 02:57:41.797]  That's right.
[02:57:42.916 --> 02:57:43.776]  We have tests.
[02:57:43.776 --> 02:57:44.637]  God has tests.
[02:57:44.637 --> 02:57:46.137]  The test is happening now.
[02:57:46.137 --> 02:57:48.498]  Sheila Gunnreid, great leader at RebelNews.com.
[02:57:48.498 --> 02:57:49.919]  Sheila Gunnreid at Twitter.
[02:57:49.919 --> 02:57:50.899]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:50.899 --> 02:57:54.740]  Join me again tomorrow to unfold this and Saturday for a special broadcast.
[02:57:54.740 --> 02:57:55.360]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:58:02.323]  All right, I'm going to introduce Jay Dyer.
[02:58:03.140 --> 02:58:04.220]  There's been a development.
[02:58:04.220 --> 02:58:20.085]  I was going to let him just take over, but there has been a major development put out by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to their different fact-checking organs with our SPARS 2025-2028 operation.
[02:58:20.085 --> 02:58:25.727]  And so we're going to be covering all of that when we come back the full hour with Jay Dyer.
[02:58:25.727 --> 02:58:26.808]  We were born for this.
[02:58:26.808 --> 02:58:27.848]  We're on air for this.
[02:58:29.665 --> 02:58:35.773]  We are here covering this, thanks to God keeping us on air for this moment now.
[02:58:35.773 --> 02:58:37.916]  So I can't wait, because Jay's a really smart guy.
[02:58:37.916 --> 02:58:41.341]  Here is his interpretation of this nightmare scenario.
[02:58:41.341 --> 02:58:43.464]  We'll be back in T-minus 60 seconds.
[02:58:43.464 --> 02:58:45.887]  Tell everybody you know to tune in right now.
[02:58:45.887 --> 02:58:47.209]  Be part of the war against tyranny.
[02:58:48.507 --> 02:58:51.049]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[02:58:51.049 --> 02:58:54.751]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine.
[02:58:54.751 --> 02:59:01.915]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our families' sakes, but also our community.
[02:59:01.915 --> 02:59:08.859]  And citizenstronghold.com is the best place to go to get high-quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[02:59:08.859 --> 02:59:12.642]  Again, this is high-quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[02:59:12.642 --> 02:59:16.304]  We've worked with them for years, but they can never supply enough to our audience.
[02:59:16.304 --> 02:59:18.085]  They have massively expanded their factories.
[02:59:18.405 --> 02:59:22.448]  It's made right here in America and they're ready to ship it to you right now.
[02:59:22.448 --> 02:59:24.269]  CitizenStronghold.com.

[02:59:38.400 --> 02:59:42.303]  And the globalists are coming to try to stop the sale of it soon.

[02:59:51.087 --> 02:59:56.071]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:52.054 --> 03:00:53.776]  I can feel the quickening.
[03:00:53.776 --> 03:00:57.459]  I can see it happening in front of me.
[03:00:57.459 --> 03:01:02.042]  By the second I already know it, I can see it.
[03:01:02.042 --> 03:01:06.466]  His spirit transcends all.
[03:01:06.466 --> 03:01:09.188]  The major move against humanity is now.
[03:01:09.188 --> 03:01:14.913]  Our greatest challenge in our entire development, seated on this planet, is now before us.
[03:01:15.876 --> 03:01:25.145]  This is the great contest and I am so blessed to still be on air in the year 2021 on April 8, 2021 on this Thursday.
[03:01:25.145 --> 03:01:31.070]  We were meant to be gone by now because the enemy said you can't have someone on air that knows our plans.
[03:01:31.070 --> 03:01:35.815]  But so many now know the plans and so many can look into the plans and give us their perspective.
[03:01:35.815 --> 03:01:35.955]  So.
[03:01:37.068 --> 03:01:47.294]  You have Lockstep, and you have Klaus Schwab, and you have The Great Reset, and you have Event 201, and you have Crimson Contagion, and you have Disease X, and you have all the drills.
[03:01:47.294 --> 03:01:48.914]  Then there's SPARS 2025-2028.
[03:01:48.914 --> 03:02:05.583]  And so we came in on the weekend, and we shot a report two hours long, and I was going to introduce Jay Dyer just briefly, but then I wanted to cover this because here's the headline, put out by all the different leftist fact-checking media, the
[03:02:08.078 --> 03:02:11.520]  NewsGuard run by Bill Gates himself.
[03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:13.322]  The news today, top search.
[03:02:13.322 --> 03:02:14.923]  Your doctor is Bill Gates.
[03:02:14.923 --> 03:02:18.485]  He's the most powerful doctor on earth.
[03:02:18.485 --> 03:02:19.646]  And it says, fact check.
[03:02:19.646 --> 03:02:22.708]  2017 fictional Spars pandemic scenario.
[03:02:22.708 --> 03:02:28.472]  Document is not proof of planned pandemic.
[03:02:28.472 --> 03:02:35.416]  You just reverse that because with them it's a pentagram.
[03:02:35.416 --> 03:02:36.437]  Them it's upside down.
[03:02:36.437 --> 03:02:37.638]  You just put it back the right way.
[03:02:38.454 --> 03:02:47.240]  There it is for you in its face because everything they do is an inversion.
[03:02:47.240 --> 03:02:53.004]  So they're telling you this is not a planned pandemic.
[03:02:53.004 --> 03:02:53.765]  Turn it back around.
[03:02:53.765 --> 03:02:55.986]  It's the other way.
[03:02:55.986 --> 03:02:59.208]  So another devastating victory.
[03:02:59.208 --> 03:03:00.229]  They will pay.
[03:03:00.229 --> 03:03:01.510]  They've been ordered to do this.
[03:03:01.510 --> 03:03:02.911]  They're carrying this out for their God.
[03:03:04.458 --> 03:03:08.939]  It's going to be nasty, but this is going to be separating the wheat from the chaff.
[03:03:08.939 --> 03:03:11.799]  And so this is quite the moment.
[03:03:11.799 --> 03:03:16.460]  And so we're going to talk about why Bill Gates is attacking this.
[03:03:16.460 --> 03:03:18.761]  Just like a month ago, they said, Jones is lying.
[03:03:18.761 --> 03:03:20.861]  India didn't ban the Pfizer shot.
[03:03:20.861 --> 03:03:21.721]  Jones is lying.
[03:03:21.721 --> 03:03:24.742]  No one's banning AstraZeneca because it was banned everywhere.
[03:03:24.742 --> 03:03:31.283]  This is their desperation as they lie and say, oh, the UN didn't lie about Wuhan.
[03:03:31.283 --> 03:03:32.203]  The wheels are coming off.
[03:03:32.203 --> 03:03:33.003]  So I can't wait.
[03:03:33.715 --> 03:03:50.827]  In the next 55 minutes of live broadcast that's left in this hour ahead of the war with Owen Sawyer for Jay Dyer, author, researcher, great guy, smarter than I am in many ways, to give his perspective on this document that everyone should report on and everyone should investigate and see for themselves.
[03:03:50.827 --> 03:04:02.355]  So Jay, take it over and tell us why they're so upset that we're looking at SPARS and why General Flynn endorses our research of this and really why they would make a document admitting their plans.
[03:04:02.355 --> 03:04:03.336]  Jay Dyer, take it over.
[03:04:04.821 --> 03:04:05.382]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:04:05.382 --> 03:04:06.103]  I appreciate that.
[03:04:06.103 --> 03:04:09.427]  Yeah, I want to thank you guys for putting out that excellent documentary.
[03:04:09.427 --> 03:04:10.989]  I went through it three times.
[03:04:10.989 --> 03:04:23.765]  I had to listen to it intently because I wanted to make sure I got all the information, then kind of zoom out, as I usually do, to tie it into the other documents, the other books that the Global Lead have been writing for decades now.
[03:04:24.628 --> 03:04:53.799]  Most famously, of course, we want to look at Jonah Salk's book because a lot of what's in the preparation for the danger, the harm that's going to come, that they anticipate, the inflammation, the prion and all that, it really meshes perfectly with what Salk himself wrote decades ago in his book, specifically Survival of the Wisest, where he says things like, why don't we just put a cancer virus in the vaccines and by doing that we'll actually
[03:04:54.648 --> 03:04:55.089]  We're good.
[03:05:15.309 --> 03:05:16.130]  We're good.
[03:05:28.476 --> 03:05:31.097]  They want to mutate us into other types of things, right?
[03:05:31.097 --> 03:05:41.163]  So the mutation is a goal that they want to take us towards, moving away from what it is to be man, because in their philosophy there's no such thing as natures, right?
[03:05:41.163 --> 03:05:43.904]  Man doesn't have a nature that makes him what he is.
[03:05:43.904 --> 03:05:46.005]  It's just whatever you want to make it into, right?
[03:05:46.005 --> 03:05:47.086]  It's magical thinking.
[03:05:47.086 --> 03:05:51.948]  You can just, like in postmodernism, just say something is what it is and it just magically becomes that.
[03:05:51.948 --> 03:05:55.210]  Oh, I identify as Bill Cosby, so therefore I am Bill Cosby.
[03:05:55.550 --> 03:05:58.993]  You have to treat me now like a Bill Cosby because I identify as him, right?
[03:05:58.993 --> 03:06:01.055]  That's how this mindset thinks.
[03:06:01.055 --> 03:06:06.100]  But by the top elites, the social controllers, the social engineers, they know that it's not really that way.
[03:06:06.100 --> 03:06:13.446]  That's the public perception's, you know, sort of dumbed-down idea that, you know, they just rely on these fact-checkers.
[03:06:13.446 --> 03:06:15.868]  They just default to this fallacy of authority, right?
[03:06:15.868 --> 03:06:20.552]  Oh, well, he must know what he's talking about because he runs Microsoft, right?
[03:06:20.552 --> 03:06:21.473]  He has these computers.
[03:06:21.473 --> 03:06:22.534]  He must know what he's talking about.
[03:06:23.334 --> 03:06:29.057]  This defaulting to authority, when we go and read the authorities, we learn that they're Malthusian.
[03:06:29.057 --> 03:06:34.880]  So this whole book, I mean the very title of the book itself, tells you that the attitude is Malthusian.
[03:06:34.880 --> 03:06:43.765]  And so when we have the real context, the real big picture from these guys, I'm going to show you some other books that I haven't covered here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:44.799 --> 03:06:57.593]  Especially Turning Point by Fritof Capra, some of these forgotten global elite texts, they'll talk about how the medical tyranny, medicine, is the real angle by which this global order needs to come into play.
[03:06:57.593 --> 03:07:00.276]  But going back to Salk, Salk says that
[03:07:02.615 --> 03:07:05.098]  Mankind is a cancer.
[03:07:05.098 --> 03:07:11.545]  The species of mankind, even though there is no species of mankind, there is a species of mankind that needs to be stamped out.
[03:07:11.545 --> 03:07:17.251]  Just like Bertrand Russell says, there's no free will, there's no spirit in man, but we also have to stamp out free will and the spirit in man.
[03:07:17.251 --> 03:07:18.513]  I thought that didn't exist.
[03:07:19.894 --> 03:07:33.170]  So, in Chapter 7, there's a really amazing chapter where you have, again, this man is lauded as the Nobel Laureate, right, for inoculations, right, for, oh, he cured polio.
[03:07:34.222 --> 03:07:35.783]  We're told at least.
[03:07:35.783 --> 03:07:44.247]  But of course we know that when you give the Nobel to people like Obama, war criminals, this is a joke.
[03:07:44.247 --> 03:07:46.688]  It's a propaganda operation, the Nobel Prize.
[03:07:46.688 --> 03:07:56.132]  It's not actually a thing that's awarded to people that are really doing scientific breakthroughs, unless you count the death cult's scientific breakthroughs as a scientific breakthrough.
[03:07:56.132 --> 03:08:01.895]  And in that regard, I guess, yes, he is a powerful illuminary of Satan.
[03:08:01.895 --> 03:08:03.736]  He's one of the great demons, I guess you could say, because
[03:08:04.344 --> 03:08:15.353]  He says in Chapter 7 that if we inject viruses into pregnant women, we can experiment on the eggs of pregnant women.
[03:08:15.353 --> 03:08:22.619]  And he says this is because man is again a manimal, right, that can be mutated.
[03:08:22.619 --> 03:08:27.323]  Now this is going to sound crazy but I'm going to show you where Klaus says this in his book.
[03:08:27.978 --> 03:08:36.847]  This is because they have the view that in time what they're going to try to do is mutate man to no longer be man to get rid of man.
[03:08:36.847 --> 03:08:39.449]  So they're going to reclassify through legal fiction.
[03:08:39.449 --> 03:08:41.351]  I'm not kidding, right?
[03:08:41.351 --> 03:08:44.174]  Man is no longer going to be classified as a, quote, human.
[03:08:44.898 --> 03:08:52.225]  He's actually called, if you look up many years ago, and I didn't believe this when I heard it, look up the Cornell Law Code about how man is defined.
[03:08:52.225 --> 03:08:54.226]  Man and other animals, okay?
[03:08:54.226 --> 03:08:58.970]  Then this fits in with UN legal redefinitions of what man is.
[03:08:58.970 --> 03:09:03.154]  Human resources were actually a resource just like anything else, like cattle, right?
[03:09:03.154 --> 03:09:04.916]  So when you redefine what a human is,
[03:09:05.636 --> 03:09:13.583]  In legal categories, this gives the precedent for ways to experiment and to change what that animal is.
[03:09:13.583 --> 03:09:17.986]  Just like testing on lab rats, just like testing on anything else, right?
[03:09:17.986 --> 03:09:24.672]  There's a famous book written by, I think she's from Harvard, Rebecca Limoff, she has a book called World as Laboratory.
[03:09:24.672 --> 03:09:31.117]  And she talks about this scientism attitude that sees the world like a test tube, that sees it as a science experiment.
[03:09:31.838 --> 03:09:33.760]  And that's what we're dealing with here.
[03:09:33.760 --> 03:09:36.322]  People that are trying to do this very thing.
[03:09:36.322 --> 03:09:38.044]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:38.044 --> 03:09:41.667]  I'm your guest, Jay Dyer of jaysanalysis.com.
[03:09:41.667 --> 03:09:45.210]  When we come back, we're going to get into more of Jonas Salk.
[03:09:45.210 --> 03:09:46.131]  As far as document
[03:09:46.884 --> 03:09:54.989]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registrars that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[03:09:54.989 --> 03:10:02.875]  And they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[03:10:02.875 --> 03:10:05.937]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[03:10:05.937 --> 03:10:14.002]  So whether you have domains, or want to register a domain, or want help building a website, or want servers, or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding
[03:10:14.042 --> 03:10:14.422]  Yeah.
[03:10:32.543 --> 03:10:39.368]  So it's a win-win as we build a true, open, free internet again, because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[03:10:39.368 --> 03:10:43.811]  So, InfoWarsDomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[03:10:43.811 --> 03:10:47.494]  InfoWarsDomains.com, take action now!
[03:10:47.494 --> 03:10:50.296]  The equation is very simple.
[03:10:50.296 --> 03:10:59.683]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech.
[03:11:01.008 --> 03:11:10.112]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[03:11:10.112 --> 03:11:18.596]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[03:11:18.596 --> 03:11:25.339]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down and use
[03:11:26.199 --> 03:11:34.285]  The idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[03:11:34.285 --> 03:11:38.788]  That's why they target Infowars because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[03:11:38.788 --> 03:11:44.172]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote Infowars and ban that video.
[03:11:44.172 --> 03:11:45.153]  So redouble your efforts.
[03:11:45.153 --> 03:11:49.336]  We're all in this together.
[03:11:49.336 --> 03:11:51.918]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:12:12.311 --> 03:12:14.953]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:12:14.953 --> 03:12:17.015]  I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of jaysandalsons.com.
[03:12:17.015 --> 03:12:22.860]  Be sure to follow me on my website there as well as my social media is just under my name Jay Dyer.
[03:12:22.860 --> 03:12:23.881]  Now the
[03:12:25.399 --> 03:12:31.056]  Point that Salk goes on to make in the book that I wanted you to be aware of is that Salk is very adamant that
[03:12:32.031 --> 03:12:35.313]  There's nothing bad about disease or death or decay.
[03:12:35.313 --> 03:12:43.637]  Since they're part of the natural process, the scientific elite must commandeer it and then use that to the advantage, so-called, of the species.
[03:12:43.637 --> 03:12:47.199]  So, in other words, imagine using death, disease, decay.
[03:12:47.199 --> 03:12:55.283]  I don't know if you saw the last Mission Impossible installment, but if you noticed, that was the attitude, that was the mindset of the villain.
[03:12:55.283 --> 03:12:57.764]  Remember, the villain was like an ecocide maniac.
[03:12:58.419 --> 03:13:04.062]  Who thought that the population was going to destroy the planet because of his Malthusian ideas.
[03:13:04.062 --> 03:13:09.064]  And so of course, you know, Tom Cruise had to save everybody from him setting off nukes and depopulating.
[03:13:09.064 --> 03:13:18.489]  But that's not too far from reality because Salk says that the real scientific elite are going to have to make these tough decisions about who lives and who dies.
[03:13:19.275 --> 03:13:24.337]  And the easiest way to get this done is through a mass vaccination program.
[03:13:24.337 --> 03:13:26.117]  That's exactly what this book is about.
[03:13:26.117 --> 03:13:29.078]  And in fact, that's not the only book that Dr. Salk wrote.
[03:13:29.078 --> 03:13:37.040]  He wrote a whole other book outlining the exact same thing called Man Unfolding, where again, man is just a random mutation process.
[03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:42.522]  And if man is just a random mutation process, there's nothing wrong with getting rid of most of man.
[03:13:43.710 --> 03:13:45.911]  And he says, well then who will survive?
[03:13:45.911 --> 03:13:47.272]  Who will live on?
[03:13:47.272 --> 03:13:47.933]  Me!
[03:13:47.933 --> 03:13:48.633]  He says, literally.
[03:13:48.633 --> 03:13:54.917]  He says the scientific elite, which by that he means himself and his cronies, and everybody else will be extinguished.
[03:13:54.917 --> 03:14:01.181]  He says the number one enemy, by the way, he says on page 73, is the traditionalists, right?
[03:14:01.181 --> 03:14:08.765]  So pages 71, 72, 73, and by that he means anybody who doesn't have a complete scientism type of worldview, right?
[03:14:08.765 --> 03:14:12.968]  If you don't accept total atheistic, luciferian scientism,
[03:14:14.028 --> 03:14:17.429]  If you don't join their club, you have to die.
[03:14:17.429 --> 03:14:21.630]  Because you are the problem, right, for evolution.
[03:14:21.630 --> 03:14:26.151]  You're in the way of the species evolving to godhood.
[03:14:26.151 --> 03:14:27.852]  And he has that attitude.
[03:14:27.852 --> 03:14:30.432]  He has the belief that they're going to evolve to godhood.
[03:14:30.432 --> 03:14:36.074]  Now, if that sounds crazy, bear with me, because I'm going to show you where Klaus himself says this in his book.
[03:14:36.696 --> 03:15:06.180]  He says that the new definitions of what species are, right, when we inject the mutations into the species, when we develop new species, right, then we're going to have the ability to reclassify everyone and everything, right, in these legal fictions to where everything that they want to do in terms of the establishment perspective, overriding the Renaissance, overriding the biblical common law, overriding natural law, right, overriding the Constitution, any of these classical documents of
[03:15:06.957 --> 03:15:07.798]  We're good to go.
[03:15:25.356 --> 03:15:31.740]  Decided and determined by the UN, Davos, World Economic Forum, Bilderberg, etc.
[03:15:31.740 --> 03:15:38.244]  So, now that we have that in mind about the attitude of one of the top scientific elite of the last several decades, just one, okay?
[03:15:38.244 --> 03:15:39.024]  Remember, the U.S.
[03:15:39.024 --> 03:15:45.368]  government has a giant institute called the Salk Initiative, right, where they do mind-brain interface.
[03:15:45.368 --> 03:15:50.571]  Why does the Salk Brain Initiative do mind, excuse me, mind-computer, brain-computer interface?
[03:15:51.471 --> 03:15:54.172]  Well, when you reach Schwab, you're going to understand why that is.
[03:15:54.172 --> 03:15:57.173]  But I want to remind you also of another guy.
[03:15:57.173 --> 03:15:59.254]  His name is Fritoff Capra, right?
[03:15:59.254 --> 03:16:01.795]  And he talks like a higher-pitched Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[03:16:01.795 --> 03:16:05.697]  He sounds like he's Arnold Schwarzenegger sucking helium.
[03:16:05.697 --> 03:16:14.480]  Now, Fritoff has a take that was overlooked, that a few researchers did pick up on.
[03:16:14.480 --> 03:16:18.001]  One of those is known as the Dr. Day tapes.
[03:16:18.001 --> 03:16:19.102]  I'll talk about those in a minute.
[03:16:20.160 --> 03:16:30.927]  One of the things that Copper has talked about was that, he says, we're going to have to follow the ideas of Arthur Kessler, and a previous global elitist of the same mindset as all these characters.
[03:16:30.927 --> 03:16:40.054]  He says, Copper says, we're going to have to adopt the idea that medicine is the key backdoor to bring in this new order.
[03:16:40.054 --> 03:16:43.296]  In fact, that's a huge portion of this big, fat, boring book.
[03:16:44.159 --> 03:16:45.980]  Is that medicine will be the key?
[03:16:45.980 --> 03:16:47.281]  It's medicine, medicine, medicine.
[03:16:47.281 --> 03:16:53.586]  Don't... Everybody thinks, oh, it's going to be the government smashing my face, a boot on my... There will be an element of that.
[03:16:53.586 --> 03:17:04.114]  But the real backdoor, the real way that this new system is going to come in, according to Fritoff... I always want to call them Fritos.
[03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:12.713]  According to Cheeto Copra, according to Jonas Salk, according to the day tapes, right, it's going to be through medicine.
[03:17:12.713 --> 03:17:22.758]  And when you get into what Fritoff, for example, thinks is going to be key to this, I'm not kidding, he actually references M. Keltre.
[03:17:22.758 --> 03:17:25.719]  Now why would M. Keltre be relevant to this whole thing?
[03:17:26.320 --> 03:17:47.266]  A lot of people don't know that when you look at figures like Gregory Bates and people who were involved in the MKUltra program, CIA connected guys, Gordon Wasson, a lot of these characters were studying entheogens, studying hallucinogens, studying pharmaceuticals, and thus LSD is developed out of the pharmaceutical milieu.
[03:17:47.266 --> 03:17:55.369]  And so what Frito says is that we're going to have to take the research that MKUltra has done
[03:17:56.235 --> 03:18:01.997]  Which, by the way, became MK Search, and it was moved to Fort Detrick.
[03:18:01.997 --> 03:18:12.681]  It became a biowarfare program, and it moved into electronic research, including ELF, VLF, microchips, brain implants, etc., as well as nanotech.
[03:18:13.405 --> 03:18:20.188]  So DARPA, right, is really the long-term end result in terms of the super soldiers and all this kind of stuff.
[03:18:20.188 --> 03:18:21.748]  That is all about this.
[03:18:21.748 --> 03:18:26.430]  It's about mutating man, and it's about a biological rewrite, okay?
[03:18:26.430 --> 03:18:30.332]  They want to do a synthetic rewrite of all reality.
[03:18:30.332 --> 03:18:32.572]  And now I know that sounds kind of far-fetched, like, what?
[03:18:32.572 --> 03:18:34.593]  I mean, come on.
[03:18:34.593 --> 03:18:41.056]  But when I read Klaus, and I listened to some of the other videos that are on InfoWars that discuss this,
[03:18:42.159 --> 03:18:43.600]  I went back and I looked at Salk.
[03:18:43.600 --> 03:18:47.722]  I looked at what Friedhoff and Arthur Kessler say.
[03:18:47.722 --> 03:18:49.342]  That is what they say.
[03:18:49.342 --> 03:18:51.644]  And it's just kind of in hiding in plain sight.
[03:18:51.644 --> 03:18:59.007]  They're saying that through the nanotech, through the modifications that were done over the decades of experiments, right?
[03:18:59.007 --> 03:19:03.809]  So all this, all that in culture research, all that in case search research, Bluebird, Monarch.
[03:19:03.809 --> 03:19:06.791]  It wasn't just about sex slaves and mind control assassins.
[03:19:06.791 --> 03:19:08.051]  That was an element.
[03:19:08.051 --> 03:19:11.313]  But this is dozens of projects that eventually leads to
[03:19:12.465 --> 03:19:14.007]  Cybernetics, right?
[03:19:14.007 --> 03:19:18.151]  Norbert Wiener, cybernetics, that's all part of MKUltra.
[03:19:18.151 --> 03:19:20.032]  That's the end result of it.
[03:19:20.032 --> 03:19:27.039]  And what they wanted to do was figure out ways to not just mutate man and redefine what man is, but to end man.
[03:19:27.039 --> 03:19:29.081]  It's to end man.
[03:19:29.081 --> 03:19:30.302]  They all say this.
[03:19:30.302 --> 03:19:32.384]  This is not a conspiracy theory, right?
[03:19:32.384 --> 03:19:35.067]  I've covered 50 plus writings of the global elite.
[03:19:35.067 --> 03:19:37.229]  They all say we have to end man.
[03:19:38.314 --> 03:19:41.698]  And we're going to do that, as Russell said, a hundred years ago.
[03:19:41.698 --> 03:19:48.225]  Their diet, injections, injunctions, and all of these scientific projects.
[03:19:48.225 --> 03:19:55.454]  So, Fritoff says that when the pharmaceutical big pharma industry gets sufficiently advanced to the point that they can
[03:19:56.374 --> 03:19:58.675]  Basically change humanity.
[03:19:58.675 --> 03:20:01.875]  We will be able to evolve to this next stage, right?
[03:20:01.875 --> 03:20:03.416]  The next type of civilization.
[03:20:03.416 --> 03:20:06.417]  I think they call it like a type 3, 4 civilization, right?
[03:20:06.417 --> 03:20:07.977]  Then this is what Salk is talking.
[03:20:07.977 --> 03:20:15.699]  I mean, Schwab is talking about with the fourth industrial revolution is the next phase out of the old way of living, right?
[03:20:15.699 --> 03:20:18.700]  Hunter-gatherer societies, industrial revolution.
[03:20:18.700 --> 03:20:20.380]  Now it's the tech revolution.
[03:20:21.215 --> 03:20:28.601]  And it's only going to be for a select small number of elite who will then move to being post-human.
[03:20:28.601 --> 03:20:30.523]  Everyone else will die.
[03:20:30.523 --> 03:20:31.864]  That's the plan.
[03:20:31.864 --> 03:20:34.926]  That's what they say in all the books.
[03:20:34.926 --> 03:20:36.447]  All their books.
[03:20:36.447 --> 03:20:37.128]  All of them.
[03:20:37.128 --> 03:20:38.369]  The ones that talk about this, right?
[03:20:38.369 --> 03:20:40.310]  Not every book that they write talks about this stuff.
[03:20:40.310 --> 03:20:46.335]  But all the books that talk about this relate to transcending and ending man.
[03:20:46.335 --> 03:20:48.897]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me.
[03:20:48.897 --> 03:20:50.679]  And it makes me feel pathetic.
[03:20:51.448 --> 03:20:55.391]  Because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly.
[03:20:55.391 --> 03:20:58.713]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[03:20:58.713 --> 03:21:00.174]  And we're all in this together.
[03:21:00.174 --> 03:21:05.537]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:21:05.537 --> 03:21:06.218]  But it's true.
[03:21:06.218 --> 03:21:09.620]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:21:10.280 --> 03:21:10.620]  I think so.
[03:21:25.532 --> 03:21:28.354]  Look, I've proven that InfoWars information is some of the best in the world.
[03:21:55.050 --> 03:21:57.552]  It's just absolutely on target.
[03:21:57.552 --> 03:22:00.594]  The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate.
[03:22:00.594 --> 03:22:01.655]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[03:22:01.655 --> 03:22:04.917]  I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered.
[03:22:04.917 --> 03:22:06.939]  Because I know that John F. Kennedy was right.
[03:22:06.939 --> 03:22:08.560]  A raising tide raises all ships.
[03:22:09.907 --> 03:22:22.274]  Now, the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have at InfoWarsTore.com are the very best sourced, wild-crafted, organic, and natural product you're going to find anywhere.
[03:22:22.274 --> 03:22:28.898]  Whether it's Natural Defense, or whether it's Ultra 12, or whether it's X2, or DNA Force Plus, or Prostagard, or Vazoviz,
[03:22:29.702 --> 03:22:36.826]  These are all cutting-edge, top-of-the-line products that will help you and your family at the same time fund the InfoWar.
[03:22:36.826 --> 03:22:38.286]  So don't procrastinate.
[03:22:38.286 --> 03:22:41.448]  Take action today at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:50.552]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[03:22:50.552 --> 03:22:55.115]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[03:22:55.115 --> 03:23:04.321]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[03:23:04.321 --> 03:23:08.784]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[03:23:08.784 --> 03:23:10.565]  And they are collapsing the third world
[03:23:10.725 --> 03:23:26.918]  With our economic weapons, to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[03:23:26.918 --> 03:23:35.505]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns
[03:23:39.508 --> 03:23:48.995]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[03:23:48.995 --> 03:23:50.736]  It's very bittersweet.
[03:23:50.736 --> 03:23:53.718]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[03:23:53.718 --> 03:23:54.979]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[03:23:54.979 --> 03:23:55.900]  But I don't care about that.
[03:23:55.900 --> 03:23:57.161]  I care about beating the new world order.
[03:23:57.944 --> 03:24:02.630]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:05.995]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[03:24:05.995 --> 03:24:07.517]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[03:24:07.517 --> 03:24:08.698]  But let's just say this.
[03:24:08.698 --> 03:24:10.020]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[03:24:10.020 --> 03:24:12.484]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[03:24:13.104 --> 03:24:16.746]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:24:16.746 --> 03:24:19.327]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[03:24:19.327 --> 03:24:22.508]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[03:24:22.508 --> 03:24:23.349]  Do they fund freedom?
[03:24:23.349 --> 03:24:24.469]  No, a lot of them don't.
[03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:30.912]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[03:24:30.912 --> 03:24:32.653]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[03:24:32.653 --> 03:24:35.474]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[03:24:36.054 --> 03:24:39.177]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[03:24:39.177 --> 03:24:50.346]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[03:24:50.346 --> 03:24:52.988]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:25:05.539 --> 03:25:15.167]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:25:15.167 --> 03:25:20.331]  I want to remind you, if you're interested in this material, but maybe you think it's a little too
[03:25:21.798 --> 03:25:22.198]  Technical?
[03:25:22.198 --> 03:25:24.139]  A little too jargon-heavy?
[03:25:24.139 --> 03:25:29.600]  Well, I wrote two books that use movies to make this accessible to your friends and family members.
[03:25:29.600 --> 03:25:36.622]  So, if you do have friends and family that read, get my books, Esoteric Hollywood 1 and 2, at the website, jasonelsis.com, in the shop.
[03:25:36.622 --> 03:25:39.063]  Everybody gets signed copies when you get it from my website.
[03:25:39.063 --> 03:25:43.204]  Don't get it from Ol' Bezos over there, because he takes all the money.
[03:25:45.009 --> 03:25:52.493]  Now, I did mention that we're going to do a kind of an overview of the SPARS video that Alex put together with his crew.
[03:25:52.493 --> 03:25:53.173]  That's excellent.
[03:25:53.173 --> 03:25:54.754]  It's a must-see.
[03:25:54.754 --> 03:26:06.219]  And I'm going to do a quick run-through, but one last document, one last piece of information that's a great attestation to the veracity of what I'm saying is the document, or it's actually a series of tapes and lectures called the Day Tapes.
[03:26:06.779 --> 03:26:17.947]  And Dr. Richard Day was an attendee of a conference back in 1968-69 under the auspices of the National Population Council and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[03:26:17.947 --> 03:26:20.809]  And there was another, so there was a doctor who was presenting here.
[03:26:21.678 --> 03:26:31.464]  And this was about the top doctors in the country back at that time coming together to figure out under Planned Parenthood how to implement this overall plan.
[03:26:31.464 --> 03:26:40.849]  Now it's just one of the many instances of the types of things, the types of documents, the types of white papers, the types of high-level policy NGO think tank plans that are out there.
[03:26:41.679 --> 03:26:45.142]  And a lot of people thought, well, maybe this guy's not really telling us the truth.
[03:26:45.142 --> 03:26:55.028]  But the doctor who was present actually went to the, at that time, the Pro-Life League, which is a Catholic organization back in the late 80s, early 90s.
[03:26:55.028 --> 03:27:01.593]  And he leaked this whole conference, okay, that was again from the late 60s.
[03:27:01.593 --> 03:27:04.515]  And he said, there's a long-term plan over many decades
[03:27:05.231 --> 03:27:15.780]  To institute, not just the world government, all the kind of normal things that we've heard about, but he said that it's going to be to the point where they're going to have mandatory vaccinations.
[03:27:15.780 --> 03:27:18.001]  They're going to have mandatory microchipping.
[03:27:18.001 --> 03:27:25.608]  They're going to do it through new ways that, like he said, aren't even sufficiently advanced in terms of the technology at that time.
[03:27:25.608 --> 03:27:27.709]  He said there will be total societal breakdown.
[03:27:27.709 --> 03:27:34.535]  There'll be all these different things that we've seen, such as the gender issues, the chemicals in the food and the water that actually changed
[03:27:35.363 --> 03:27:36.104]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:27:36.104 --> 03:27:38.426]  RNA, mRNA and all that.
[03:27:38.426 --> 03:27:48.735]  And so the idea that this is not feasible or not plausible or there's no evidence for this, this was going on at the same time as another conference called the Mind Control Conference.
[03:27:48.735 --> 03:27:50.336]  It was sponsored by the CIA.
[03:27:50.336 --> 03:27:55.180]  One of the famous doctors present at that conference was called Dr. Holger Heiden.
[03:27:55.180 --> 03:27:57.863]  Now, you probably haven't heard of these guys because they're just
[03:27:58.582 --> 03:28:02.306]  They're just high-level social engineer doctors that are not famous.
[03:28:02.306 --> 03:28:03.828]  They're not out there in the public view.
[03:28:03.828 --> 03:28:07.192]  But if you do some research, you will find these people, right?
[03:28:07.192 --> 03:28:13.699]  For example, I didn't expect it, but Dr. Holger Heiden comes up in Arthur Kessler's book, Ghost in the Machine.
[03:28:13.699 --> 03:28:17.843]  And he comes up because the idea that Dr. Holger Heiden had was, we can change mRNA
[03:28:20.333 --> 03:28:23.995]  To literally reverse the types of human beings that we get.
[03:28:23.995 --> 03:28:25.916]  We can make men more feminine.
[03:28:25.916 --> 03:28:28.138]  We can make women more masculine.
[03:28:28.138 --> 03:28:37.644]  And if we do this convergence and move both the male and the female into this kind of convergence towards each other, he says, we'll get the new male, right?
[03:28:37.644 --> 03:28:39.945]  Like you've seen the meme, right?
[03:28:39.945 --> 03:28:40.966]  The soy boy memes.
[03:28:40.966 --> 03:28:42.006]  We'll get the new male.
[03:28:42.006 --> 03:28:43.167]  We'll get the new human.
[03:28:44.170 --> 03:28:47.713]  And I know that sounds silly, but it's not a joke.
[03:28:47.713 --> 03:28:49.795]  It's actually real.
[03:28:49.795 --> 03:28:52.777]  The mutation of the species is actually real.
[03:28:52.777 --> 03:28:54.979]  And that kind of stuff comes up in these talks.
[03:28:54.979 --> 03:28:59.363]  I highly recommend, if anybody hasn't heard the Dr. Day tapes, to go listen to them.
[03:28:59.363 --> 03:29:00.143]  Exactly.
[03:29:00.143 --> 03:29:01.845]  And it matches perfectly with what...
[03:29:02.688 --> 03:29:03.269]  We're good to go.
[03:29:22.981 --> 03:29:24.262]  What a coincidence, right?
[03:29:24.262 --> 03:29:29.306]  7-7, the exact same thing happens at the London 7-7 bombing, right?
[03:29:29.306 --> 03:29:33.949]  The Pfizer consultant says, well, what are the chances that we have drills going on of the very events that happened?
[03:29:33.949 --> 03:29:35.070]  The drills are the cover, right?
[03:29:35.070 --> 03:29:43.517]  This is a basic black ops military strategy to have plausible deniability in case the drill gets busted, the operation goes, oh, we're just running a drill, right?
[03:29:44.217 --> 03:29:49.999]  So, in this document, what we have, this is sponsored by World Economic Forum, Bill Gates, and Johns Hopkins, okay?
[03:29:49.999 --> 03:29:53.961]  So, if you go and read the document, 75 pages, right?
[03:29:53.961 --> 03:29:56.622]  I got through this the other night.
[03:29:56.622 --> 03:30:04.884]  We have really the playing out, right, from what the document says is 2025 to 2028, what's happening now, right?
[03:30:04.884 --> 03:30:06.985]  It matches perfectly, almost perfectly, with 2020 to 2023.
[03:30:09.622 --> 03:30:20.526]  And it's in a long line of those documents, like Event 201 exercises, like Lockstep, like Crimson Contagion, like Clade X or Disease X, UN Connected Drills.
[03:30:21.750 --> 03:30:27.595]  And it even has to the point where there's a male-female partnership vice presidency going on.
[03:30:27.595 --> 03:30:33.919]  It has six months to one year after the mass inoculations, there starts to be these problems, right?
[03:30:33.919 --> 03:30:41.005]  You get the brain inflammation, the prion disease, and this leads to a lot of public reaction, outcry, anger.
[03:30:41.665 --> 03:30:47.230]  Okay, and we remember we just hit the point, supposedly according to Reuters, where there's been 100 million people vaccinated.
[03:30:47.230 --> 03:30:49.032]  Okay, so that's where we are right now.
[03:30:49.032 --> 03:30:57.800]  And so from now to six months to a year is when this document, if it tracks, projects when there will be this sort of mass outcry.
[03:30:57.800 --> 03:31:00.022]  And it's not going to be the NGO think tank
[03:31:00.652 --> 03:31:01.212]  We're good to go.
[03:31:12.162 --> 03:31:13.362]  And it's always set up that way.
[03:31:13.362 --> 03:31:21.605]  Government is kind of the shield of, like, goobers, right, that take the blame for what the real shadow government is up to and what they're doing.
[03:31:21.605 --> 03:31:27.167]  And people say, well, you couldn't have these kinds of things going on because, like, the government is incompetent.
[03:31:27.167 --> 03:31:28.708]  Yeah, the government doesn't run things.
[03:31:28.708 --> 03:31:32.729]  The people above the government, the think tanks, the NGOs, that's who really runs things.
[03:31:32.729 --> 03:31:34.270]  And they're not incompetent, right?
[03:31:34.270 --> 03:31:36.110]  They're people with 200 IQs.
[03:31:36.110 --> 03:31:37.471]  They build the nanotech, right?
[03:31:37.471 --> 03:31:37.911]  They build
[03:31:38.431 --> 03:31:43.893]  The bombs that, you know, the smart tech, okay, they're not dumb.
[03:31:43.893 --> 03:31:47.935]  The government level people are just a bunch of stooges and goobers and are dumb in many cases.
[03:31:47.935 --> 03:31:49.196]  They don't know anything.
[03:31:49.196 --> 03:31:52.797]  So, the health officials are set to take the fall in the document.
[03:31:52.797 --> 03:31:56.519]  Remember, this came out in 2017 and it's predicting what will be the case.
[03:31:56.519 --> 03:32:02.941]  It even lists the names of this stupid thing, this cold virus, basically, right?
[03:32:02.941 --> 03:32:04.202]  It calls it, what, SPARS?
[03:32:05.251 --> 03:32:06.852]  Instead of SARS, right?
[03:32:06.852 --> 03:32:08.013]  SARS-CoV-2.
[03:32:08.013 --> 03:32:17.098]  We've had a bunch of different PR names for this engineered thing, this GMO cold virus that we have.
[03:32:17.098 --> 03:32:19.159]  SARS-CoV-2 in the document.
[03:32:19.159 --> 03:32:20.620]  And this also lines up with IMF 2018-2019 documents.
[03:32:20.620 --> 03:32:21.461]  They call it the SARS-CoV-2, right?
[03:32:26.320 --> 03:32:32.706]  The percentage of the numbers, right, the public percentage of the number, 6%, right, is even in the document.
[03:32:32.706 --> 03:32:38.732]  Including the hashtags, including the stupid rap songs by the washed-up rappers, right, Run DMC.
[03:32:38.732 --> 03:32:47.141]  Remember, I mean, my buddy Tristan, shout-out to Primal Edge Health, he covered this whole thing with this total ridiculous social engineering selling point.
[03:32:47.801 --> 03:32:51.625]  Using the hashtags that are in this document of, Take the vaccine!
[03:32:51.625 --> 03:32:52.586]  Run DMC!
[03:32:52.586 --> 03:32:53.607]  Take the vaccine!
[03:32:53.607 --> 03:32:54.708]  It's not Tuskegee!
[03:32:54.708 --> 03:32:55.669]  Take the vaccine!
[03:32:55.669 --> 03:32:55.909]  Right?
[03:32:55.909 --> 03:32:58.212]  Just nonsense.
[03:32:58.212 --> 03:33:03.437]  They even expected anti-vaccine groups to refer to things like Tuskegee.
[03:33:04.680 --> 03:33:09.666]  That's how far forward thinking these kinds of war game documents are.
[03:33:09.666 --> 03:33:14.271]  And when they reply, when they say that this is a conspiracy, they just gaslight.
[03:33:14.271 --> 03:33:21.740]  Basic gaslighting, basic psychological warfare techniques of deny, always deny, always deny, just lie in the people's face.
[03:33:21.740 --> 03:33:22.841]  That's a better tactic!
[03:33:23.416 --> 03:33:27.879]  Then trying to do a reasoned logical so-called refutation of response, right?
[03:33:27.879 --> 03:33:31.341]  That's a basic psychological warfare manipulation tactic.
[03:33:31.341 --> 03:33:32.862]  Narcissists do this, right?
[03:33:32.862 --> 03:33:39.327]  There's a million videos on YouTube of narcissists, narcissists, everybody's talking about narcissistic psychopaths, right?
[03:33:39.327 --> 03:33:42.469]  Yeah, those run DMC with their vaccine.
[03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:52.536]  Now, amazingly, again, the document predicts mass anger, outrage over all of the bad effects from this experimental
[03:33:53.454 --> 03:33:55.856]  mRNA mutation machine.
[03:33:55.856 --> 03:33:57.497]  It's like a machine that they're putting in.
[03:33:57.497 --> 03:34:03.863]  It's like a, it's like a little time bomb machine according to what it's supposed, according to the mRNA.
[03:34:03.863 --> 03:34:05.164]  And again, you said that's crazy.
[03:34:05.164 --> 03:34:05.464]  That's great.
[03:34:05.464 --> 03:34:06.645]  It doesn't exist.
[03:34:06.645 --> 03:34:08.086]  Klaus talks about this.
[03:34:08.086 --> 03:34:11.869]  He talks about nanotech types of vaccines.
[03:34:11.869 --> 03:34:17.714]  I made a joke video like 10 years ago where I was impersonating Alex.
[03:34:17.714 --> 03:34:19.455]  Folks are going to put nanotech in the food.
[03:34:19.455 --> 03:34:20.676]  It's going to be in the vaccines.
[03:34:20.676 --> 03:34:21.977]  They're going to put little robots in.
[03:34:21.977 --> 03:34:22.798]  So I was joking.
[03:34:23.795 --> 03:34:24.976]  They really did it.
[03:34:24.976 --> 03:34:26.657]  I didn't even think that was real.
[03:34:26.657 --> 03:34:29.340]  I did a joke video 10 years ago.
[03:34:29.340 --> 03:34:32.562]  Making fun, I mean in good faith, just out of fun.
[03:34:32.562 --> 03:34:35.625]  Impersonation is the best form of flattery.
[03:34:36.346 --> 03:34:37.247]  And it's real!
[03:34:37.247 --> 03:34:38.768]  I mean, that blows my mind, right?
[03:34:38.768 --> 03:34:46.715]  And Klaus will tell you this, because yes, we're going to use mRNA in spectrum.
[03:34:46.715 --> 03:34:54.662]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[03:34:56.187 --> 03:35:00.931]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[03:35:00.931 --> 03:35:03.273]  Super Male Vitality!
[03:35:03.273 --> 03:35:12.120]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[03:35:12.120 --> 03:35:23.289]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[03:35:23.289 --> 03:35:23.509]  Yes.
[03:35:23.949 --> 03:35:28.875]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[03:35:28.875 --> 03:35:35.502]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[03:35:35.502 --> 03:35:36.844]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:35:36.844 --> 03:35:38.706]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[03:35:38.706 --> 03:35:41.529]  Never been a better time than right now.

[03:35:45.934 --> 03:35:50.278]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[03:35:50.278 --> 03:36:00.588]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[03:36:00.888 --> 03:36:07.074]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:36:07.074 --> 03:36:15.622]  The new RocketRest formula is loaded with the best natural ingredients to help not only improve your quality of sleep, but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[03:36:15.622 --> 03:36:25.252]  Many competitors sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep, but RocketRest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[03:36:25.712 --> 03:36:33.515]  It uses a unique quick-release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.
[03:36:33.515 --> 03:36:38.217]  Rocket Rest helps you fall asleep fast, stay asleep, and wake up feeling rested.

[03:36:46.980 --> 03:36:50.161]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing Devil's Advocate on air.
[03:36:51.451 --> 03:36:54.292]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists.
[03:36:54.292 --> 03:37:03.315]  That the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[03:37:03.315 --> 03:37:05.075]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[03:37:05.075 --> 03:37:05.876]  They play God.
[03:37:05.876 --> 03:37:09.717]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[03:37:09.717 --> 03:37:13.538]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me.
[03:37:13.538 --> 03:37:14.998]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[03:37:14.998 --> 03:37:16.839]  But metaphysically, at a spiritual level,
[03:37:18.275 --> 03:37:19.236]  I have the Holy Spirit.
[03:37:19.236 --> 03:37:21.017]  I have a connection with God.
[03:37:21.017 --> 03:37:24.460]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[03:37:24.460 --> 03:37:33.267]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system, believing you're part of it, or believing you're getting power from it.
[03:37:33.267 --> 03:37:38.091]  Whether you're just a steel worker, or a school teacher, or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[03:37:39.162 --> 03:37:45.432]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like.
[03:37:45.432 --> 03:37:47.094]  And that's a fact.
[03:37:47.094 --> 03:37:54.926]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registrars that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[03:37:55.206 --> 03:38:03.068]  And they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[03:38:03.068 --> 03:38:06.149]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[03:38:06.149 --> 03:38:14.411]  So whether you have domains, or want to register a domain, or want help building a website, or want servers, or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[03:38:14.591 --> 03:38:32.528]  And if you go to InfoWarsDomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign-up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the InfoWars and we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them.
[03:38:32.748 --> 03:38:39.573]  So it's a win-win as we build a true, open, free internet again, because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[03:38:39.573 --> 03:38:42.595]  So, InfoWarsDomains.com.
[03:38:42.595 --> 03:38:44.016]  The revolution starts there.
[03:38:44.016 --> 03:38:45.838]  InfoWarsDomains.com.
[03:38:45.838 --> 03:38:49.781]  Take action now!
[03:38:49.781 --> 03:38:52.402]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:39:08.641 --> 03:39:09.962]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:39:09.962 --> 03:39:12.703]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of jasonallison.com.
[03:39:12.703 --> 03:39:14.524]  Be sure to follow me on all my outlets.
[03:39:14.524 --> 03:39:25.331]  Let me give a shout-out also to RockFim, which is an excellent free speech-based platform that has myself, Sam Tripoli, Jason Bermas, Whitney Webb, Richard Grove, many other
[03:39:26.231 --> 03:39:54.798]  Analysts and researchers out there a shout out to Rockfin for being a Platform that wants to go for promoting free speech as well as of course band up video as well as in fours We sure and support us or all the people that are doing the real research and real work here in alternative media I wanted to go back to this document a few more points on the spars document if you want a better modern example right of this Malthusian idea remember that this comes from
[03:39:55.530 --> 03:40:00.733]  In the context of the elite meeting a few years ago at the Good Club, right?
[03:40:00.733 --> 03:40:02.653]  This was Oprah, right?
[03:40:02.653 --> 03:40:03.634]  It was Bill Gates.
[03:40:03.634 --> 03:40:06.275]  It was, at that time, David Rockefeller, Ted Turner.
[03:40:06.275 --> 03:40:13.339]  The elites getting together to talk about and discuss the ways to implement the global mass and population operations.
[03:40:13.339 --> 03:40:14.759]  So we know that that's their agenda.
[03:40:14.759 --> 03:40:17.280]  We know that that's what they want to do.
[03:40:17.280 --> 03:40:21.683]  We know that they work endlessly, right, to do this, to achieve this.
[03:40:21.683 --> 03:40:23.363]  Excuse me.
[03:40:23.363 --> 03:40:23.904]  Now, in the case of
[03:40:25.410 --> 03:40:26.692]  Oh, Gil Bates.
[03:40:26.692 --> 03:40:30.957]  One thing that he's talked about is the geoengineering programs, right?
[03:40:30.957 --> 03:40:32.859]  We know that he's heavily involved in that.
[03:40:32.859 --> 03:40:36.624]  A lot of that we don't exactly know what the whole plan is.
[03:40:36.624 --> 03:40:37.545]  Why exactly?
[03:40:37.545 --> 03:40:41.650]  They say things like, oh, we've got to combat climate change, we've got to block out the sun, right?
[03:40:41.650 --> 03:40:43.332]  And I'm sure that that's to a degree true.
[03:40:44.052 --> 03:40:53.775]  And there's other documentaries, other works that have been put out that kind of tie it into, well, they need to spray to help make, you know, cell phone signals clearer, right?
[03:40:53.775 --> 03:41:01.137]  If there's metals in the atmosphere, the cell phones will work better, which are, again, odd kind of justifications for this attitude.
[03:41:01.732 --> 03:41:07.316]  And there have been a lot of theorizing about whether there could be a nanotech connection to the spring and all that.
[03:41:07.316 --> 03:41:19.124]  Again, I don't have proof that necessarily the geoengineering at this point is directly connected to nanotech, but I do know that Klaus and the elite write about the possibility of this.
[03:41:19.124 --> 03:41:26.349]  So, if they're writing about the possibility of it, there's a good chance that they're probably already doing it, perhaps.
[03:41:26.349 --> 03:41:29.672]  In Klaus's book, if you remember, right, Fourth Industrial Revolution,
[03:41:30.402 --> 03:41:40.188]  In the last half of the book, right, which is where it gets really heavy, really crazy, is where he talks about how AI will eventually kind of take over everything.
[03:41:40.188 --> 03:41:43.970]  And one thing that's got to happen is that all of reality has got to be tagged.
[03:41:43.970 --> 03:41:45.611]  It's got to be tracked, right?
[03:41:45.611 --> 03:41:51.274]  Every object that exists in the world needs to have some kind of way to be relayed and tracked.
[03:41:52.068 --> 03:42:03.492]  Now, this gets into, in my view, what they call the Simulant World System, right, where they have kind of supercomputers that have a kind of live, real-time model of what's going on, right, in the real world.
[03:42:03.492 --> 03:42:07.273]  Now, whether they have actually achieved that or whether that's the plan is up for debate.
[03:42:07.273 --> 03:42:08.833]  I think that's definitely the plan.
[03:42:08.833 --> 03:42:12.434]  Whether they actually have that is, you know, is anyone's guess.
[03:42:12.434 --> 03:42:20.357]  But, so the plan is to use smart dust, right, which is a form of nanotech, right, which can wirelessly transmit and kind of give a
[03:42:21.115 --> 03:42:27.445]  Give a relay, right, back to the supercomputers via the space-based satellites.
[03:42:28.536 --> 03:42:31.498]  Via 5G, 6G, right?
[03:42:31.498 --> 03:42:33.039]  Sixth generation wireless tech.
[03:42:33.039 --> 03:42:34.280]  That's what Klaus talks about.
[03:42:34.280 --> 03:42:42.166]  He says that we're going to need the 5G and 6G in place to be able to have the Internet of Things literally link and track everything.
[03:42:42.166 --> 03:42:47.490]  And he says the only way to do this is presumably through SmartDust, right?
[03:42:47.490 --> 03:42:48.731]  And it's not just SmartDust.
[03:42:48.731 --> 03:42:50.612]  He says that we're also going to have to have
[03:42:52.694 --> 03:43:04.521]  As much as possible, self-organizing and self-repairing AI tech that's out there in the world and able to do and able to reproduce itself, for example, through 3D printing.
[03:43:04.521 --> 03:43:13.446]  So perhaps the robots of the future will be able to self-replicate through robots working on robots and engineering
[03:43:14.567 --> 03:43:18.931]  More robots, right, to go out and do these kinds of self-repair operations.
[03:43:18.931 --> 03:43:25.217]  And he says that it'll be robotic from all levels, right, to the macro scale down to the micro scale.
[03:43:25.217 --> 03:43:33.704]  And what the idea is that eventually this can replace, right, the existing failed biological world.
[03:43:33.704 --> 03:43:39.470]  So the real enemy here, if you wonder why they're always talking about carbon and why is carbon credit, carbon is the basis of life.
[03:43:40.430 --> 03:43:50.495]  And the enemy in this scheme, in this Malthusian scheme, is carbon-based lifeforms that need to give way to synthetic-based lifeforms.
[03:43:50.495 --> 03:43:56.338]  And again, because the modus operandi of this worldview is evolution, right?
[03:43:56.338 --> 03:43:59.459]  In a strict Luciferian sense, right?
[03:43:59.459 --> 03:44:00.500]  I'm not talking about adaptation.
[03:44:00.500 --> 03:44:03.961]  We all believe that species evolve to adapt to their environment.
[03:44:03.961 --> 03:44:05.362]  But I'm talking about the idea that
[03:44:05.922 --> 03:44:11.385]  You can evolve into some other totally different being, okay, a totally different type of thing.
[03:44:11.385 --> 03:44:25.392]  In order to get to that, that requires the cyborg, right, the mutation phases, right, to move out of being human into modified humans, to cyborgs, androids, right, then into the post-human.
[03:44:26.221 --> 03:44:30.624]  So, silicon-based lifeforms, nanotech-based mutations, right?
[03:44:30.624 --> 03:44:32.665]  Again, I thought this was crazy when I heard this.
[03:44:32.665 --> 03:44:33.986]  I was like, no, surely.
[03:44:33.986 --> 03:44:37.308]  That's just, it sounds like a science fiction story.
[03:44:37.308 --> 03:44:38.749]  It is a science fiction story, right?
[03:44:38.749 --> 03:44:40.550]  But they believe it, okay?
[03:44:40.550 --> 03:44:51.697]  And that's what Klaus says in the second half of this book, is that we're going to have to have logical reclassifications of what lifeforms are so that we can have nanotech synthetic organisms now classed as lifeforms.
[03:44:51.697 --> 03:44:54.859]  This will allow us to prepare the way, legally, for
[03:44:55.675 --> 03:44:59.257]  The new system that comes into play.
[03:44:59.257 --> 03:45:10.862]  The new system is a rewrite of all of nature and the world, and biological systems to be more logical, more rational, mecha systems, you see.
[03:45:10.862 --> 03:45:11.822]  That's the plan.
[03:45:11.822 --> 03:45:19.706]  That's the real... The plan is not just to have a global government of, you know, baby-eating, adrenochrome, guzzling satanists, okay?
[03:45:20.762 --> 03:45:22.922]  That does go on in some places, right?
[03:45:22.922 --> 03:45:25.243]  But that's not the real long-term goal here.
[03:45:25.243 --> 03:45:30.724]  The real long-term goal is to be post-human, to end man as man is known.
[03:45:30.724 --> 03:45:33.304]  And so in that sense, it is satanic, right?
[03:45:33.304 --> 03:45:36.005]  And Klaus is just abundantly clear.
[03:45:36.005 --> 03:45:43.606]  Every chapter in the second half of this book is about the 3D printing that the robots will themselves control to self-replicate.
[03:45:43.606 --> 03:45:47.907]  They will then run giant drone fleets, the AI, he's saying, right?
[03:45:47.907 --> 03:45:49.567]  They'll have the killer drones,
[03:45:50.646 --> 03:45:58.273]  That will then, through targeted tracking and tracing, get rid of anyone that's a problem.
[03:45:58.273 --> 03:46:02.857]  And he says, by 2030, 2040, 2050, there won't be humans, right?
[03:46:02.857 --> 03:46:06.801]  You won't be born in your mom's womb, right?
[03:46:06.801 --> 03:46:13.187]  There'll be CRISPR technology that will engineer synthetic humanoids, synthoids.
[03:46:13.917 --> 03:46:18.180]  Now, again, I'm not saying that this is going on now or that they have done this.
[03:46:18.180 --> 03:46:21.502]  Yeah, there's that Black Mirror episode that talks about this, right?
[03:46:21.502 --> 03:46:22.883]  This is what Klaus projects.
[03:46:22.883 --> 03:46:26.985]  Okay, head of the World Economic Forum, head of Davos.
[03:46:26.985 --> 03:46:29.026]  He says that it's like Prometheus.
[03:46:29.026 --> 03:46:34.450]  He likens it to Prometheus, where we will change man, we'll genetically modify everything,
[03:46:35.811 --> 03:46:47.591]  And he says, and the end result of this will be a new type of reality, right, where it moves out of the biological and the carbon into a synthetic wireless
[03:46:48.351 --> 03:46:49.911]  Almost like a noosphere, right?
[03:46:49.911 --> 03:46:53.452]  Something like, I don't know, like out of, like bringing Hellworld into this world, right?
[03:46:53.452 --> 03:46:58.233]  Like Stranger Things, like the upside-down will come into this world through the nanotech.
[03:46:58.233 --> 03:47:02.274]  Now, I don't actually think that they're going to do all of this, right?
[03:47:02.274 --> 03:47:07.756]  But that is the plan that they have because of this attitude, because of this worldview that they have.
[03:47:07.756 --> 03:47:16.278]  And he says that the key to all of this is to control energy, and we have to control energy via the smart dust, via the smart tech, via the tracking, via a
[03:47:17.040 --> 03:47:37.528]  Robot drone fleet right that will police everything after everything has been sprayed with smart does now That's what he says you can call that crazy if you want to but that's one of the most influential Wealthiest men out there right part of this Global liberal left elite right the the World Economic Forum is
[03:47:38.188 --> 03:47:43.313]  And let's bring in our good buddy Owen Schroyer to talk about that from the War Room.
[03:47:43.313 --> 03:47:47.997]  Owen will be hosting his show immediately after this episode.
[03:47:47.997 --> 03:47:51.461]  And I think we have, do we have Owen with us?
[03:47:51.461 --> 03:47:52.242]  I'm with you, Jay.
[03:47:52.242 --> 03:47:53.603]  How you doing, Owen?
[03:47:54.542 --> 03:48:07.660]  Well, you know, I'm listening to your last segment, and I was listening to your whole hour talking about Schwab's book, and the one trend that continues to kind of ring in my head is just how cold it is, how un-humid it is.
[03:48:07.660 --> 03:48:09.723]  It's like, did this guy not get hugged as a child?
[03:48:10.243 --> 03:48:13.045]  Did this guy not get, you know, swaddled as a baby?
[03:48:13.045 --> 03:48:16.927]  I mean, seriously, like, why is he so cold to humanity to have this outlook?
[03:48:16.927 --> 03:48:26.653]  Yeah, we could all look at the innovations and the future and the trends of technology and just say, yeah, screw man, but that just seems a little too cold for me, Jay, but that seems what these people are into.
[03:48:26.653 --> 03:48:35.559]  I'll tell you what else is cold, the treatment of these miners that are crossing the border, and I don't blame Border Patrol, I don't blame ICE, they're in a bad situation, but the governor of
[03:48:36.119 --> 03:48:48.089]  Texas has now come out and echoed what we got from an exclusive source just two weeks ago, that children are arriving in these facilities and re-enacting what's been done to them on the way.
[03:48:48.089 --> 03:48:55.215]  So they're masturbating, they're engaging in sexual acts with their brothers and sisters and random children.
[03:48:55.215 --> 03:48:59.138]  They know that this is a result of them being raped and molested on the way in here.
[03:48:59.138 --> 03:49:00.960]  Now it's commonplace in these facilities.
[03:49:01.500 --> 03:49:10.845]  And now they've also said that undocumented workers that lost their jobs during the pandemic to Biden administration has set aside two billion dollars for non-citizens.
[03:49:10.845 --> 03:49:12.746]  Most citizens still haven't even gotten a stimulus check.
[03:49:12.746 --> 03:49:15.107]  So that's all coming up today on The War Room, Jay.
[03:49:17.006 --> 03:49:18.869]  Wow, that's insane.
[03:49:18.869 --> 03:49:19.850]  Thank you so much for that.
