[00:00.000 --> 00:11.660]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.660 --> 00:19.220]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.220 --> 00:39.280]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:39.280 --> 00:44.240]  all right we have a surprise guest on this Friday edition coming up in the
[00:44.240 --> 00:48.720]  next hour working on several other newsworthy guests that can bring us a
[00:48.720 --> 00:53.420]  lot of important information and enlightenment here on the broadcast today
[00:53.420 --> 01:01.780]  it is the 23rd day of January 2009 we will be live for the next three hours
[01:01.780 --> 01:08.340]  and 58 minutes and then I'll be back this Sunday live 4 to 6 p.m. central
[01:08.340 --> 01:17.900]  standard time Obama officially orders Gitmo closed that is the headline
[01:17.900 --> 01:25.300]  secret prisons Obama's order to close black sites but if you go into what to
[01:25.300 --> 01:29.620]  his policy wonks have actually said in the last few weeks of what they're doing
[01:29.620 --> 01:35.580]  that they're going to look at closing Guantanamo Bay in the next year and look
[01:35.580 --> 01:41.060]  at a new system of holding these prisoners and if you read the fine
[01:41.060 --> 01:46.420]  print they are simply not going to call them ghost sites anymore and they are
[01:46.420 --> 01:52.380]  going to hold foreigners and u.s. citizens in bases inside the United
[01:52.380 --> 01:58.060]  States and other parts of the world and I've of course done the research on this
[01:58.060 --> 02:02.380]  on and off since they opened Guantanamo seven years ago but I went back last
[02:02.380 --> 02:07.260]  night in this morning and pulled up some of the history of that I also went and
[02:07.260 --> 02:16.380]  pulled up a few weeks ago with Obama on a national television kind of going
[02:16.380 --> 02:26.980]  sideways on the issue so it's another betrayal form over substance but at least
[02:26.980 --> 02:30.740]  I'll say this the American people have forced the establishment to at least
[02:30.740 --> 02:37.060]  act like it isn't kosher it isn't acceptable to have secret prisons all
[02:37.060 --> 02:41.420]  over the planet where they torture people and there is talk internationally of
[02:41.420 --> 02:45.260]  war crimes charges and crimes against humanity against Bush and others
[02:45.260 --> 02:49.540]  certainly they wrote the memos saying they could bury people alive pull their
[02:49.540 --> 02:53.980]  toenails out torture their children in front of them pressure their families
[02:53.980 --> 03:00.260]  things of that nature is Obama I'm calling for that no he's not he's
[03:00.260 --> 03:04.420]  thanking George Bush during his inaugural speech for the quote great
[03:04.420 --> 03:11.140]  job he's done for the country so they have to make the public think they're
[03:11.140 --> 03:15.700]  reversing course when in reality they are just going along the exact same
[03:15.700 --> 03:19.300]  course while the international bankers loot is for trillions of dollars a week
[03:19.300 --> 03:24.060]  and that brings me to the second subject I'm going to detail wall street
[03:24.060 --> 03:30.380]  journal says what bank nationalization means for you Bloomberg has the headline
[03:30.380 --> 03:38.340]  city group back of America may look nationalized now this is not true they
[03:38.340 --> 03:46.620]  are not being nationalized far worse they are being taken into a secret
[03:46.620 --> 03:54.420]  consortium of the private international central bank holders and private groups
[03:54.420 --> 03:58.940]  are taking over the banks and then the second phase of the bailout will be
[03:58.940 --> 04:04.620]  paid secretly bits and then Timothy get there all of them are on record in to
[04:04.620 --> 04:10.300]  this new institution and so they're telling the public nationalization
[04:10.300 --> 04:15.260]  will save you nationalization will get credit flowing again just like they
[04:15.260 --> 04:19.180]  said with the October 3rd law they pass the Baker bailout that it would get
[04:19.180 --> 04:22.260]  things rolling and then they said we're not telling you where the money went
[04:22.260 --> 04:27.140]  the problem isn't subprime mortgages well here we are October November
[04:27.140 --> 04:35.700]  December January almost four months later and they're saying oh it's back to
[04:35.700 --> 04:41.260]  the future we're going to have to create this new international institution
[04:41.260 --> 04:45.300]  to see there they're they're not nationalizing their handy control of
[04:45.300 --> 04:50.300]  these banks even more control over the private secretive Federal Reserve only
[04:50.300 --> 04:53.420]  the New York Board of Governors and then they are going to hand over authority
[04:53.420 --> 04:58.020]  and are handing over authority openly to an international body and there's big
[04:58.020 --> 05:03.420]  new NSA information as well you worry you see the signs and worry about the
[05:03.420 --> 05:07.460]  future you worry about economic turmoil and food shortages how to be prepared

[08:10.700 --> 08:17.460]  radio network tell you about the surprise guest we've got coming on today a
[08:17.460 --> 08:22.260]  little while we've also got the author and researcher who's exposing one of
[08:22.260 --> 08:30.220]  Obama's new cabinet picks who wants animals to be able to suit humans but
[08:30.220 --> 08:35.380]  of course the state and private groups are going to represent the animals and
[08:35.380 --> 08:39.260]  the animals will have human standing and then they will but the but the
[08:39.260 --> 08:42.140]  government will speak for the animals and they're saying this themselves has
[08:42.140 --> 08:47.620]  nothing to do with stopping animal cruelty it has nothing to do with helping
[08:47.620 --> 08:51.060]  little bunny rabbits it's all about grabbing land and property and waging
[08:51.060 --> 08:57.820]  war on the almost extinct middle-class worldwide and that ties into the entire
[08:57.820 --> 09:06.060]  eugenics overlay so that's coming up in about an hour and a half in front of me
[09:06.060 --> 09:11.020]  today I have the Guantanamo hoax the closure of Guantanamo hoax but it is a
[09:11.020 --> 09:15.860]  victory it is positive to a certain degree in certain level so we're going
[09:15.860 --> 09:22.700]  to go into that also there's been big new NSA spying developments the full
[09:22.700 --> 09:26.740]  extent is now being learned and it's exactly what I said 13 years ago on
[09:26.740 --> 09:31.540]  there the national security agency reads every email listens to every phone
[09:31.540 --> 09:36.660]  call they track every digital cable box what you're watching what you're doing
[09:36.660 --> 09:40.460]  they dial it and use the microphones and planted in them to listen to you they
[09:40.460 --> 09:45.500]  use the built-in cameras and audio sensors in your cell phones in your
[09:45.500 --> 09:52.620]  computers it's all admitted why did I know this because it was in tech
[09:52.620 --> 09:56.740]  industry high-level engineer publications that when I first got on
[09:56.740 --> 10:01.580]  air in 95 96 Austin being a big tech town people mailed it to me and they
[10:01.580 --> 10:05.940]  said you think big brothers bad mr. Jones with some cameras on the street you
[10:05.940 --> 10:12.260]  have no idea and I had people send me videos inside the Texas Department of
[10:12.260 --> 10:16.460]  Transportation where they would shoot video off the screen I gotta find this
[10:16.460 --> 10:20.940]  I put it on access TV like one time in 98 and it's in the big stacks of videos
[10:20.940 --> 10:24.220]  back there when it was just me running everything while we're getting more
[10:24.220 --> 10:27.260]  people in here to go through the literally thousands of videos and DVDs
[10:27.260 --> 10:31.620]  and audios that we have three storage buildings of with that type of incredible
[10:31.620 --> 10:35.940]  research and reports we did that we're gonna put on prison planet TV but I
[10:35.940 --> 10:39.780]  gotta raise the money to hire somebody to go through it and it's got to be
[10:39.780 --> 10:43.700]  somebody that knows what they're looking for it's just a goldmine of
[10:43.700 --> 10:48.180]  information in there but but I'm digressing because all of this stuff is
[10:48.180 --> 10:53.180]  secret once they implement it but when they're R&D researching it when the big
[10:53.180 --> 10:57.140]  companies are lobbying the government to adopt their surveillance package it's
[10:57.140 --> 11:06.460]  public just like in 1992 I saw Alexander Hague with his own TV show on Cable
[11:07.180 --> 11:12.340]  bragging that they were gonna put high altitude hundred thousand foot in the
[11:12.340 --> 11:16.620]  air blimps better than satellites and cheaper to surveil all US cities and
[11:16.620 --> 11:21.460]  face scams and I was in high school watching Alexander Hague at the time
[11:21.460 --> 11:24.980]  he was into high technology he knew that everything was cable TV at that time
[11:24.980 --> 11:29.540]  and so he bought a national infomercial he would run every day where he would
[11:29.540 --> 11:32.500]  just sit there for 30 minutes talking about the New World Order and everything
[11:32.500 --> 11:36.980]  else and just a few weeks ago I remembered that show and remembered
[11:36.980 --> 11:39.700]  seeing that and that that was one of the things that really woke me up as well
[11:39.700 --> 11:45.620]  was that I would watch Alexander Hague many days when I would get home I was in
[11:45.620 --> 11:49.860]  high school I'd leave school I'd go work out for an hour come home turn the
[11:49.860 --> 11:53.900]  TV on and Alexander Hague was on and they would air it on the local county
[11:53.900 --> 11:59.860]  channel through some grant through his defense company but I'm digressing see
[11:59.860 --> 12:04.380]  that's how there's all this information tied together and data and info and so
[12:04.380 --> 12:08.820]  seven years ago they announced the launch of the blimps and then they said
[12:08.820 --> 12:12.380]  they were secret and didn't exist after that so there's different policies and
[12:12.380 --> 12:16.100]  government where they'll admit something and later say it never happened so that's
[12:16.100 --> 12:22.340]  how I knew exactly how everything worked how the cell phones listen to you and
[12:22.340 --> 12:25.060]  tracks you and you have to take the battery out and I would talk about it
[12:25.060 --> 12:29.020]  in 96 because I read it in tech publications and then I saw the bill
[12:29.020 --> 12:34.940]  the telecommunications act that said it was to track and trace you and said the
[12:34.940 --> 12:39.620]  NSA was putting in hubs in all the phone companies and internet to fully track
[12:39.620 --> 12:43.980]  everything to where everything goes through them the phone company is the
[12:43.980 --> 12:48.740]  national security agency the big cable providers are the national security
[12:48.740 --> 12:52.460]  agency and it's compartmentalized in every one of these buildings from small
[12:52.460 --> 12:56.700]  to large you'll have a room or a whole floor that's in essay computer with NSA
[12:56.700 --> 13:01.500]  private contractors and that's just one agency there's defense intelligence and
[13:01.500 --> 13:06.020]  18 others and now the news is admitting that two-thirds of intelligence
[13:06.020 --> 13:12.220]  gathering against the American people are done by outside private groups so I
[13:12.220 --> 13:18.380]  want to get into that first then we'll cover Barack Obama and his hoax about
[13:18.380 --> 13:22.740]  shutting down want on obey then we'll get into what bank nationalization means
[13:22.740 --> 13:26.540]  because it's not bank nationalization there's always lies within lies within
[13:26.540 --> 13:33.860]  lies within lies this is private federal reserve what appears now to be an
[13:33.860 --> 13:37.380]  internal war between the bankers we know they engineered it to where they're
[13:37.380 --> 13:42.500]  even gobbling up federal reserve family shareholders and there's a war where
[13:42.500 --> 13:46.940]  they're using governmental regulation but private offshore stock ownership in
[13:46.940 --> 13:53.060]  the Fed Federal Reserve to come in and forcibly take these over and then they
[13:53.060 --> 13:56.860]  say it's secret how much money taxpayer money's being given but they give us the
[13:56.860 --> 14:02.560]  blank check number of 8.5 trillion and then they've been through executive
[14:02.560 --> 14:06.660]  fiat not even through law because that's what I keep saying they don't need a new
[14:06.660 --> 14:11.140]  banker bailout a new law the thing they passed October 3rd gave omnipotent
[14:11.140 --> 14:15.340]  police state power to the private federal reserve and they kept claiming
[14:15.340 --> 14:18.020]  government oversight government transparency and now they admit there is
[14:18.020 --> 14:22.020]  none it's secret and so I'm gonna try to break that down it's actually very
[14:22.020 --> 14:27.460]  simple but also complex to explain it's just an absolute outrageous stinking
[14:27.460 --> 14:31.260]  fraud and notice there's no talk of prosecutions no talk of arrest no talk of
[14:31.260 --> 14:35.180]  bankers being in trouble in brokerage firms for selling derivatives that were
[14:35.180 --> 14:39.340]  based on nothing and having insurance companies fraudulently certified the debt
[14:39.340 --> 14:44.780]  as good and certify the instruments is triple A rated US government backed gold
[14:44.780 --> 14:51.100]  quality literally as good as gold investment is what it means I mean
[14:51.100 --> 14:54.100]  Enron stole a couple hundred billion and stole the pension funds it was a
[14:54.100 --> 14:58.580]  money laundering cocaine heroin dealing money laundering operation that also
[14:58.580 --> 15:02.700]  stole from states you know they'd still a billion bucks a week sometimes in
[15:02.700 --> 15:05.980]  California and then their internal memos came out where they said if we turn
[15:05.980 --> 15:09.500]  the power off every night for an hour it creates their perception that there's
[15:09.500 --> 15:14.620]  actually not enough power and the public will accept not having the power and
[15:14.620 --> 15:17.660]  of course I went on air at the time and knew that trick and said they're turning
[15:17.660 --> 15:21.900]  the power off on purpose to jack up the prices in Ron is a fraud in Ron is a
[15:21.900 --> 15:26.980]  scam Mr. White the head of their California division later became
[15:26.980 --> 15:32.380]  Secretary of Defense when Bush got in would lead the California legislature
[15:32.380 --> 15:37.340]  and US congressmen and women through a fake computer room with fake charts
[15:37.340 --> 15:41.940]  showing fake energy trading they just made up the numbers every day and said
[15:41.940 --> 15:48.900]  you know we're gonna make your power cost 20 times 25 times what it did
[15:48.900 --> 15:52.860]  previously then it turned out Schwarzenegger was meeting with them
[15:52.860 --> 15:58.500]  privately at the time and that came out the news at the Beverly Hills hotel
[15:58.500 --> 16:06.100]  with the head of in Ron with Malcolm Malcolm excuse me and others and I was
[16:06.100 --> 16:11.100]  no fan of Governor Gray Davis in fact I even got sucked on early on into the
[16:11.100 --> 16:14.660]  recall of him then they bait and switch with Schwarzenegger but then the news
[16:14.660 --> 16:19.980]  said Schwarzenegger was fighting in Ron and Schwarzenegger was fighting the
[16:19.980 --> 16:23.780]  the energy ripoff so when that all came out the news in unison said
[16:23.780 --> 16:30.460]  Schwarzenegger was fighting in Ron in the scam and that Governor Gray Davis had
[16:30.460 --> 16:35.820]  done it when Gray Davis was fighting him and so was saying it was a scam and
[16:35.820 --> 16:41.500]  that's what they removed even then he gets blamed for it I mean it is so sick
[16:41.500 --> 16:46.300]  and all the conservatives oh Gray Davis is a gun grabber he's bad we got to get
[16:46.300 --> 16:48.980]  rid of him then Arnold comes in and starts even more gun grabbing and they
[16:48.980 --> 16:52.460]  say well that's good you know we need to go ahead and have some sensible gun
[16:52.460 --> 16:59.620]  restrictions I mean that's what I mean it's just it's all twisting they're
[16:59.620 --> 17:02.340]  either throwing at your face and telling you something evil is good or
[17:02.340 --> 17:08.900]  they're flat out lying or it's local news that ever gets national attention and
[17:08.900 --> 17:12.060]  you've got to vet that and check it people ask how we arrive at news and how
[17:12.060 --> 17:16.660]  we trust what we have an overlay understanding of knowledge and how the
[17:16.660 --> 17:20.020]  system works and who the players are and what their tricks are and that nude in
[17:20.020 --> 17:23.380]  that old dogs don't learn new tricks and how they operate and so we're
[17:23.380 --> 17:27.420]  constantly reassessing our analysis adding new information we're not perfect
[17:27.420 --> 17:31.100]  we're learning more and more though exponentially like a computer we are an
[17:31.100 --> 17:35.420]  organic computer electrochemical computer here in my operation I am
[17:35.420 --> 17:38.620]  constantly integrating and getting better getting quicker getting faster
[17:38.620 --> 17:42.140]  understanding their nuances understanding their tricks where I can project out
[17:42.140 --> 17:48.860]  years ahead exactly what they're going to do I mean a lot of times my mind just
[17:48.860 --> 17:53.060]  burns with understanding and connections and just it moves like a million miles
[17:53.060 --> 17:56.900]  an hour and I'm nobody special everybody can learn these skills it's just like if
[17:56.900 --> 18:01.700]  you were to watch football and study a football team for 20 years and eat
[18:01.700 --> 18:06.340]  drink and sleep it you would know every play they were gonna call and and you
[18:06.340 --> 18:10.300]  know you would burn with football you would just know all about it but men and
[18:10.300 --> 18:14.660]  women use their skills women use their skills for detail and facts on how to
[18:14.660 --> 18:20.700]  look sexy men do it to how to act cool and know all about football and show off
[18:20.700 --> 18:26.660]  with their sports scores folks all I do is study these people and let me tell
[18:26.660 --> 18:30.220]  you something it's if they're so horrible and wicked and evil and
[18:30.220 --> 18:36.860]  backstabbing and hateful of goodness that people accuse me of making things
[18:36.860 --> 18:40.780]  look worse than they are but notice as time goes on it turns out things are
[18:40.780 --> 18:44.980]  worse than I've said see people say I'm saying things are worse than they really
[18:44.980 --> 18:49.980]  are but as in hindsight it's always worse than I've said you understand I'm
[18:49.980 --> 18:56.220]  conservative about what I present here to you we are under total engineering
[18:56.220 --> 19:02.780]  ladies and gentlemen we are under total attack all of us together and when we
[19:02.780 --> 19:08.900]  come back I'm gonna get into this NSA situation then into the privatization
[19:08.900 --> 19:15.140]  the hijacking of US bank accounts and investments that's what this really is
[19:15.140 --> 19:19.020]  because they say they're grabbing the pension funds and investments and the
[19:19.020 --> 19:23.620]  bank accounts and bringing those under government control and then giving the
[19:23.620 --> 19:27.380]  private bankers governmental cover the internationalist already owned Bank of
[19:27.380 --> 19:35.740]  America they already owned JP Morgan Chase so to to properly name this it's a
[19:35.740 --> 19:42.020]  fake nationalization when it's really an international privatization theft of
[19:42.020 --> 19:46.500]  everything and then they're gonna claim that the move was a privatization
[19:46.500 --> 19:54.900]  excuse me a nationalization to save it okay and then we'll get into Obama and
[19:54.900 --> 19:59.500]  his hoax with the shutting down in Guantanamo nothing's getting shut down

[24:07.700 --> 24:23.660]  network with the national security act of 1947 the private federal reserve that
[24:23.660 --> 24:30.180]  had taken over in 1913 was able to create a parallel shadow government they
[24:30.180 --> 24:34.140]  then began surveilling us in foreign industry that was not controlled by
[24:34.140 --> 24:39.460]  them and used the stolen intercepts spies they put into companies around the
[24:39.460 --> 24:43.860]  world to shut them down federal regulators to shut down entrepreneurs and
[24:43.860 --> 24:52.140]  all of their competition the main tool of the NSA and the CIA and spying on the
[24:52.140 --> 24:56.060]  American people in industry and other federal agencies was to ensure that it
[24:56.060 --> 24:59.540]  was kept quiet that the United States was giving the atomic bomb to the
[24:59.540 --> 25:05.340]  Russians the aluminum plants the weapons systems it was also used again to
[25:05.340 --> 25:10.900]  steal and take over industry unfairly with this inner allied crime syndicate
[25:10.900 --> 25:16.620]  and to begin bringing in LSD cocaine heroin and then having US government
[25:16.620 --> 25:20.740]  officers start the drug dealing operations and set up subsidiary drug
[25:20.740 --> 25:24.780]  dealers that would work for them throughout the United States and then
[25:24.780 --> 25:27.700]  through Hollywood it's now been declassified they hyped up the drug
[25:27.700 --> 25:30.460]  culture to get the kids on it because they didn't just want to sell them
[25:30.460 --> 25:35.100]  drugs they also wanted to put them in the prisons that the big drug cartels
[25:35.100 --> 25:40.660]  own through the banks and we're building and so that's what the NSA does and it
[25:40.660 --> 25:46.100]  tracks trends it finds out what the people are concerned with it engages in
[25:46.100 --> 25:53.180]  real polling real sampling to try to manipulate and lie to the public to see
[25:53.180 --> 25:57.740]  what lies and deception work for the people it's heavily compartmentalized
[25:57.740 --> 26:01.980]  and more than two-thirds of the surveillance of the population is now
[26:01.980 --> 26:06.980]  done by contractors the private contractors are Google their time
[26:06.980 --> 26:13.580]  Warner their yahoo the CIA and we've had CIA officers on and listed the names of
[26:13.580 --> 26:18.580]  those out of MIT that started Google it is a globalist front company just like
[26:18.580 --> 26:22.100]  IBM or Microsoft that's why it's allowed to break all the rules do whatever it
[26:22.100 --> 26:27.700]  wants it's been given rule and copyright over all books ever published by the UN
[26:27.700 --> 26:30.180]  and the US government they're just saying you can do whatever it wants with
[26:30.180 --> 26:38.380]  digital books I mean it's just insane and so they've got all these other
[26:38.380 --> 26:43.980]  private defense contractor companies that have humid people on the ground it's
[26:43.980 --> 26:48.940]  their businesses control and domination and dumbing down and taking over cities
[26:48.940 --> 26:52.540]  and compromising police chiefs and getting into positions of total control
[26:52.540 --> 26:57.340]  and there were all these denials Alex Jones the crazy man he says something
[26:57.340 --> 27:01.780]  called echelon exist he says the NSA exists I mean even the mid 90s the news
[27:01.780 --> 27:08.460]  would say the NSA didn't exist talking to the public like they're a bunch of
[27:08.460 --> 27:12.460]  idiots and I guess they were a bunch of idiots because they bought it and then
[27:12.460 --> 27:14.620]  I've been telling you ever since I got on there that they're listening to
[27:14.620 --> 27:19.060]  everything they're tracking everything okay you shouldn't let that be a
[27:19.060 --> 27:22.300]  chilling effect to what you're doing they're the criminals they're the out
[27:22.300 --> 27:25.300]  of control people they're the globalist destroying the United States in the
[27:25.300 --> 27:29.220]  Republic so people always say well what do you have to hide let them listen

[27:41.740 --> 27:46.260]  involved in white slavery are involved in every wickedness imaginable and we
[27:46.260 --> 27:50.820]  are aware that you're an alien group alien to our way of life to our
[27:50.820 --> 27:56.220]  republic in a free society and with Bush after they staged the 9-11 attacks
[27:56.220 --> 28:02.540]  they thought this is the come out time this is the time to let the slaves know
[28:02.540 --> 28:07.220]  and remember the New York Times November 15 2002 William Sapphire you are a
[28:07.220 --> 28:11.260]  suspect every purchase you make with a credit card every magazine subscription

[28:21.980 --> 28:24.780]  communications will go into what the Defense Department describes as a
[28:24.780 --> 28:28.820]  virtual centralized grand database to this computerized dossier in your
[28:28.820 --> 28:32.100]  private life from commercial sources at every piece of information the

[28:49.020 --> 28:52.740]  u.s. citizen and then it goes into announcing that this was publicly
[28:52.740 --> 28:57.780]  announced in the homeland security package and passed into law and then we
[28:57.780 --> 29:01.820]  still have debates about whether or not this is going on and then after it came
[29:01.820 --> 29:06.900]  out that the felon admiral poindexter was running it they said okay we've
[29:06.900 --> 29:10.980]  suspended this the private programs a private group in virginia that was just
[29:10.980 --> 29:14.820]  nexusing all this in and it itself was the front and then it turned out they

[33:19.420 --> 33:36.540]  I had to briefly finish that story. I told it in more detail during Bilderberg 2008 in
[33:36.540 --> 33:41.940]  June in D.C. and Virginia, Chantilly, to be precise, right on the border of D.C.

[34:02.180 --> 34:09.140]  and folks are pulling out there playing national anthems. And I go, all right, I'm going downstairs
[34:09.140 --> 34:15.100]  to get you guys some Gatorades and some water. They were thirsty. And I say, and then we'll
[34:15.100 --> 34:19.660]  leave in about 30 minutes and get everything packed up. And if you walk around the upstairs
[34:19.660 --> 34:24.020]  floors of all the conference rooms, there are people in black suits and communications
[34:24.020 --> 34:30.820]  equipment and big table conference rooms set up and FBI people and State Department protective
[34:30.820 --> 34:36.940]  detail. We ran into them. Later they brought Marines on our Marines in uniform. That was
[34:36.940 --> 34:45.940]  after we were kicked off. And so I walk into the gift shop and there's an office off the
[34:45.940 --> 34:53.020]  gift shop on the bottom floor. And there was a cooler right by the door and I'm getting
[34:53.020 --> 34:57.540]  some Gatorade out and I hear him going, I'm tracking him. I'm tracking him. I've got him.
[34:57.540 --> 35:00.740]  It's through. No, they're moving over there. All right, do you have that? Well, I'm having
[35:00.740 --> 35:06.620]  a problem with that download from the satellite. Well, what we do over at USA is we integrate
[35:06.620 --> 35:12.180]  that through the air forces such and such, but that's not how it's done in the army.
[35:12.180 --> 35:14.860]  They use it while I'm telling you that this piece of and then they would mention some
[35:14.860 --> 35:19.140]  pieces of equipment. I'm kind of sitting there and then they, they look and see me and close
[35:19.140 --> 35:25.420]  the door, but I keep listening and they were talking about surveilling people and listening
[35:25.420 --> 35:30.020]  to phones, probably our phones or somebody else's. I guess they were also, I mean, I
[35:30.020 --> 35:33.460]  know they surveil other world leaders and listen to their phone lines and track them.
[35:33.460 --> 35:40.340]  I mean, obviously that's going on when they all come in secretly to meet. And it just
[35:40.340 --> 35:46.900]  blew me away. Absolutely blew me away because there they were hours before the Bilderberg
[35:46.900 --> 35:51.380]  group shows up minutes before we leave. And then as soon as we get in the truck in the
[35:51.380 --> 35:56.620]  van in the parking lot, the police pull up and block us and then get on the radio and
[35:56.620 --> 36:03.620]  then pull back out and let us leave. And this sedan follows us and follows us around town.
[36:03.620 --> 36:10.660]  We get out videotaping, he drives off. And then later we saw that guy and the person,
[36:10.660 --> 36:14.820]  two of the people, separate people that came to the other hotel we were staying at afterwards
[36:14.820 --> 36:18.940]  and said, Hey, Alex, how are you doing? They'd sit down while I was eating and say, we ought
[36:18.940 --> 36:25.220]  to go take over and basically attack the State Department. You want to take a bunch of protesters
[36:25.220 --> 36:29.060]  over the State Department? I don't know how to get in there and we can take over. And
[36:29.060 --> 36:37.020]  I said, come on, man, you don't think I don't know you're a fed. And then the guys says
[36:37.020 --> 36:42.100]  something. I'm going back from memory. Like, yeah, well, I don't think you'd have much
[36:42.100 --> 36:46.580]  problem in there with the State Department protective detail. Then it's, you know, like
[36:46.580 --> 36:54.180]  a 45, 50 year old, big six foot four guy and see think this big. Well, they made some great
[36:54.180 --> 36:57.740]  films. They won South by Southwest few years ago with another film. They're making a new
[36:57.740 --> 37:02.140]  one that I'm prominent in called the New World Order. It's going to be at South by Southwest
[37:02.140 --> 37:08.180]  this year and a bunch of Sundance, a bunch of other places. And he's sitting there when
[37:08.180 --> 37:15.500]  the guy leaves and he goes, you know, that guy's a cop. And I go, yeah, obviously I know
[37:15.500 --> 37:23.580]  it's some kind of fed. He goes, yeah, we know my dad's a retired Chicago detective and I
[37:23.580 --> 37:27.860]  know cops and feds and that's a fed. And I go, yeah, I know a yellow thing with a beak
[37:27.860 --> 37:34.420]  walking and quacking and swimming's a duck too. I believe me. I know it's a cop. And
[37:34.420 --> 37:39.380]  then we'd have other people walk up to parking lot. Hey, Alex, I'm a big fan. You want to
[37:39.380 --> 37:44.300]  attack these people? You want to do it? I'm just like, come on, man, you guys have assessed
[37:44.300 --> 37:50.140]  me. You know, I'm here to cover this as the media. Knock it off. And they'll just look
[37:50.140 --> 37:53.660]  at you and go, just, just seeing how you're doing. They can show everything's all right.
[37:53.660 --> 38:02.980]  Have a good one. See you later. So that's what goes on in this country. And boy, they
[38:02.980 --> 38:07.540]  were watching folks. I don't know if it was a staged event to bring in more security or
[38:07.540 --> 38:14.820]  whatever, but some fellow on the prison planet forum, which by the way, is that back up yet?
[38:14.820 --> 38:23.220]  Is the prison planet forum back up yet? It is. Good. Thank you. Went in there and said,
[38:23.220 --> 38:30.460]  I'm scared with all these feds around. Maybe I should bring a gun tomorrow, my 22. Well,
[38:30.460 --> 38:38.020]  that guy gets out, goes up to the protest and they grabbing, dragging him off somewhere
[38:38.020 --> 38:42.420]  and reportedly he didn't have anything on him. So nothing happened. But, you know, then
[38:42.420 --> 38:45.300]  we later asked the police and they said, Oh, yeah, the feds were watching your website
[38:45.300 --> 38:52.740]  and saw the guy say that. I mean, folks, that's why it isn't Alex Jones. You've got to worry
[38:52.740 --> 38:58.260]  about info wars.com and prison planet.com are watched. I mean, you don't want to act
[38:58.260 --> 39:02.860]  like idiots on there. I mean, this isn't a game. This is the real world. The new world
[39:02.860 --> 39:12.820]  order is real. The FEMA camps are real. The NSA spying on us is real. This isn't a game.
[39:12.820 --> 39:21.860]  And I can't say that strong enough to all of you out there. So let me now just get into
[39:21.860 --> 39:28.460]  the NSA. It's now come out that two and a half years ago Bush gets up and gives a speech
[39:28.460 --> 39:34.100]  and says, we do not listen to any U.S. citizens without a warrant. These rumors you've heard
[39:34.100 --> 39:43.980]  of it are complete lies and conspiracy theories. And you could just Google Bush says NSA not
[39:43.980 --> 39:48.380]  spying on American people or something. You can pull up the videos. He said it repeatedly.
[39:48.380 --> 39:53.780]  And then it came out. Okay, we're just listing Al Qaeda when they call America. Is that okay?
[39:53.780 --> 39:58.700]  You know Al Qaeda is about to attack. And then, oh, and they're listening to the troops overseas
[39:58.700 --> 40:02.500]  and in the country. And they're spying on journalists and they're spying on Congress
[40:02.500 --> 40:09.700]  and they're spying. And then now they come out and say, okay, we're spying on everybody.
[40:09.700 --> 40:15.700]  People are saying, well, how do they have a few, you know, 100,000 bureaucrats listening
[40:15.700 --> 40:21.660]  to hundreds of millions? Well, they have computers with keywords and algorithms. Same Google
[40:21.660 --> 40:26.420]  system, same searches in the system that searches the whole wide web in seconds. It's the same
[40:26.420 --> 40:38.220]  system but with computers that transcribe the audio. And that's a 30, 40-year-old technology.
[40:38.220 --> 40:47.020]  My dad was at UT in the late 60s. And they already had computers and internet and keyword
[40:47.020 --> 40:51.020]  recognition in some of the research departments he saw. I mean, this stuff's old. Everything
[40:51.020 --> 40:55.140]  you're seeing is old. It's just packaged and slicker now. God knows what they've really
[40:55.140 --> 41:01.300]  got. And then it came out to kind of humiliate you that the NSA likes to sit around and listen
[41:01.300 --> 41:06.900]  to phone sex. Now, again, that's just the NSA. These are the constrained bureaucrats
[41:06.900 --> 41:12.500]  at NSA that are compartmentalized. The higher-ups that are getting the feeds from the private
[41:12.500 --> 41:17.220]  intel groups, these are hardcore criminals. All of them have dealt cocaine, heroin, run-white
[41:17.220 --> 41:22.620]  slavery, money laundered. They've all got a criminal past with government or private
[41:22.620 --> 41:27.340]  agencies. And then they're the trusted upper crust of the elite that have access to larger
[41:27.340 --> 41:32.860]  areas. The people blowing the whistle are mid-level analysts or they're interpreters
[41:32.860 --> 41:36.500]  brought in like Sybil Edmonds. And then she hears the government going, yeah, we're staging
[41:36.500 --> 41:39.980]  terror attacks. We're dealing with cocaine and heroin. We're selling weapons systems
[41:39.980 --> 41:43.380]  to get the money to fund it through black ops. We're going to use drills to cover up
[41:43.380 --> 41:48.820]  this operation. And she's going, my God, she's listening to the CIA and other agencies,
[41:48.820 --> 41:54.820]  Mossad, MI6, she said, as much as she could say under the federal gag order, handling
[41:54.820 --> 42:02.700]  the supposed terrorist who were really CIA and other agency, Mossad, handled Arabs out
[42:02.700 --> 42:06.740]  of Saudi Arabia that the globalists worked closely with, who were dealing narcotics and
[42:06.740 --> 42:10.940]  money laundering in the U.S. And then we're told on the side, take part in a takeover
[42:10.940 --> 42:15.340]  drill of aircraft. And we know they were going to the fence language school and other schools
[42:15.340 --> 42:19.700]  and that there were those drills, live action that day, to overlay with the NORAD drill.
[42:19.700 --> 42:27.300]  I mean, we know exactly what happened. I mean, we know who they were. They got on planes.
[42:27.300 --> 42:32.900]  We don't know what happened after. But it's on record they were feds and that they'd
[42:32.900 --> 42:37.620]  leave the country to go spy on al-Qaida in a real Muslim groups that they call al-Qaida
[42:37.620 --> 42:41.820]  because they were operatives to do that. And then they'd be flagged as terrorists by the
[42:41.820 --> 42:46.500]  State Department computers and they'd be ordered in Ottawa and in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. So in
[42:46.500 --> 42:49.740]  Canada and Saudi Arabia, the embassy heads, the visa heads would be ordered to let them
[42:49.740 --> 42:53.620]  in. They'd say, no, I'm not letting them in. I'm not going to commit a crime. And so they
[42:53.620 --> 42:57.420]  get a higher up call from the State Department saying, look, that's a CIA cover. These are
[42:57.420 --> 43:06.860]  not al-Qaida. Don't worry, let them in. On record. It's all on record. It's all on record.
[43:06.860 --> 43:11.100]  So to Arabs especially out there, you know, if you're patriotic to the United States
[43:11.100 --> 43:15.540]  and they try to recruit you to black ops and you see all these TV ads trying to recruit
[43:15.540 --> 43:19.180]  Arabs right now, they're recruiting a lot of you to set you up. I mean, I hope you know
[43:19.180 --> 43:22.620]  that. I hope they, I hope you know they're going to use you as a patsy. Well, there's
[43:22.620 --> 43:27.860]  a good chance they are. This is an untrustworthy criminal, totally ruthless group. And I mean,
[43:27.860 --> 43:32.540]  if you want to be on the news as the new terrorist, and I have no doubt Obama's people are going
[43:32.540 --> 43:37.300]  to stage more terror attacks, Clinton's are the ones that wrote the book on it bombing
[43:37.300 --> 43:43.740]  O.K.C. You know, the big opening salvo of modern stage terror inside the United States.
[43:43.740 --> 43:49.860]  So look out. But I thought I'd play just to analyze it. It's much worse than what this
[43:49.860 --> 43:54.300]  newscast is even saying. This is Keith Oberman. I wonder if Oberman's going to cover this
[43:54.300 --> 43:59.220]  as the spying continues. Because it's all continuing. You know, they're acting like
[43:59.220 --> 44:03.420]  Obama's going to stop this because he'll speak out against it publicly. Bush spoke out against
[44:03.420 --> 44:08.380]  it publicly three years ago and said it wasn't happening. But meanwhile, they were in the
[44:08.380 --> 44:12.520]  New York Times and everywhere else announcing months after 9-11 when they knew you were
[44:12.520 --> 44:17.860]  scared and thought you'd buy it. You just didn't buy. Yeah, we're tracking every email,
[44:17.860 --> 44:22.860]  every purchase, everything you do for your safety. Remember, I read it. Every purchase
[44:22.860 --> 44:26.420]  you make, every credit card, every magazine, subscription you buy, medical prescription
[44:26.420 --> 44:30.260]  you fill, every website you visit, an email you send, and what's Obama doing, making all
[44:30.260 --> 44:33.660]  your prescriptions be uploaded to the feds now. Every academic grade you receive, every
[44:33.660 --> 44:37.700]  bank deposit you make, every trip you book, every event you attend, all these transactions
[44:37.700 --> 44:41.300]  communications, we're going to a defense department describes as a virtual centralized
[44:41.300 --> 44:45.780]  grand database. They also release this publicly to chill everybody else that was awake to
[44:45.780 --> 44:49.180]  them. So we'd stop communicating and say, I don't want to go on a list. Folks, you're
[44:49.180 --> 44:53.740]  all already on list. The only hope we have, we're in the hot water right now. The only
[44:53.740 --> 44:57.220]  hope we've got is exposing all the rest of the frogs boiling that don't know they're
[44:57.220 --> 45:01.940]  boiling and let's jump out of this sucker while we still got time. You don't say, oh,
[45:01.940 --> 45:06.340]  I'm in hot water, I better shut up and just sit here and cook. You scream bloody murder,
[45:06.340 --> 45:15.220]  you go wild. And it goes on to say this computerized OSEAN, you're proud of the line from commercial
[45:15.220 --> 45:19.140]  sources and every piece of information the government has about you passport application,
[45:19.140 --> 45:23.260]  driver's license, bridge toll records, judicial and divorce records, complaints from nosy
[45:23.260 --> 45:28.100]  neighbors to the FBI. And I would add to the local police who now upgraded and uploaded
[45:28.100 --> 45:31.380]  the feds, your lifetime paper trail, plus the latest hidden camera surveillance. And
[45:31.380 --> 45:34.940]  you have the super schnoop dream, a total information awareness network. This is not
[45:34.940 --> 45:38.500]  some fart or reliant scenario is what will happen to your personal freedom. The next
[45:38.500 --> 45:43.980]  few weeks of John point extra gets the unprecedented power he seeks and he did. And we're just
[45:43.980 --> 45:51.220]  now. Oh, just now learning. Oh, Oberman, you're telling us. Thank you. Here's Keith Oberman
[45:51.220 --> 45:58.340]  with an NSA whistleblower. Here it is. Before last night, we already knew the Bush administration
[45:58.340 --> 46:03.260]  had spied on some US journalists inside the US. Last night on this newscast, we revealed
[46:03.260 --> 46:08.060]  the new allegation that Mr. Bush's national security agency was systematically 24 hours
[46:08.060 --> 46:13.620]  a day monitoring not just individual reporters, but entire US news organizations as well as
[46:13.620 --> 46:17.500]  other organizations, the identities of which we still don't know. Tonight in our third
[46:17.500 --> 46:21.140]  story, Russell Tice, the NSA whistleblower who revealed that breathtaking claim on this
[46:21.140 --> 46:25.860]  program last night returns and he is breaking more news for some context. In the New Yorker
[46:25.860 --> 46:29.820]  magazine last year, reporter Lawrence Wright revealed that the FBI had asked him about
[46:29.820 --> 46:34.980]  phone calls he made to a British lawyer who was representing former jihadists calls the
[46:34.980 --> 46:39.860]  FBI thought that were made by Wright's college age daughter. More than wiretapping was at
[46:39.860 --> 46:44.220]  work here. The name of Wright's daughter was not in the phone records. So how the hell
[46:44.220 --> 46:49.940]  Wright demanded? Did the FBI know his daughter's name? In 2007, Wright asked Mike McConnell,
[46:49.940 --> 46:53.820]  then director of national intelligence, his reply, I don't know. When Wright found it
[46:53.820 --> 46:57.900]  troubling that his daughter's name was on some NSA list somewhere, McConnell said, quote,
[46:57.900 --> 47:02.540]  it may be troublesome, it may not be. Let's stop right there. As Mr. Tice is about to
[47:02.540 --> 47:07.100]  stop right there. They're implying here that again, they at least were just spying because
[47:07.100 --> 47:10.380]  they thought it was a cold Al Qaeda with a journalist daughter. Now they were spying
[47:10.380 --> 47:14.940]  on the journalist, just like in my five spies on the entire British parliament is constantly
[47:14.940 --> 47:22.740]  arresting them for no reason and harassing people. It's the unelected illegitimate private
[47:22.740 --> 47:26.380]  Merck armies, the private bankers all over the world that are ruling our governments
[47:26.380 --> 47:32.420]  and bullying our elected legislatures and parliaments. And I mean, under no, your customer in the
[47:32.420 --> 47:38.340]  Patriot Act immediately your car purchase is uploaded or your car rental or your bank
[47:38.340 --> 47:45.500]  account statement. The feds, the banks don't, the big banks don't file a suspicious transactions
[47:45.500 --> 47:48.660]  report. I mean, they're supposed to do that and they do do that themselves as indentured
[47:48.660 --> 47:56.580]  servants for the feds. The feds are in your bank accounts. The feds just go directly into
[47:56.580 --> 48:04.100]  your account. It's all public folks. I just wanted to add that part too. That's why when
[48:04.100 --> 48:08.540]  you go buy a house or a car or a VCR now they, they sell it's Patriot compliance. Even if
[48:08.540 --> 48:13.100]  you're paying cash, we have to have your ID getting ready for the casual society. Anyways,
[48:13.100 --> 48:14.100]  here it is.
[48:14.100 --> 48:19.380]  Oh, as Mr. Tice is about to clarify, now we know. But first, yesterday we asked the NSA
[48:19.380 --> 48:25.420]  to comment on his allegations. The agency declined saying only quote, NSA considers the constitutional
[48:25.420 --> 48:29.740]  rights of US citizens to be sacrosanct. The intelligence community faces immense challenges
[48:29.740 --> 48:34.020]  in protecting our nation. No matter the challenges, NSA remains dedicated to performing its
[48:34.020 --> 48:39.820]  mission under the rule of law. That from a bush holdover at NSA. No reply yet from the
[48:39.820 --> 48:44.620]  Obama White House. Returning to our program tonight, Russell Tice, former NSA analyst,
[48:44.620 --> 48:48.140]  now a very public whistleblower. Thank you again for your time tonight, sir.
[48:48.140 --> 48:49.140]  Good evening. Thank you.
[48:49.140 --> 48:50.140]  Thank you.
[48:50.140 --> 48:55.460]  Last night we discussed collection of phone and email data, envelope info, like the length
[48:55.460 --> 48:59.540]  of the call, but also the content. But the information they collected on journalists
[48:59.540 --> 49:03.900]  and other people, this was more than just phone and email info?
[49:03.900 --> 49:10.420]  As far as the information, the wiretap information that made it to NSA, there was also data mining
[49:10.420 --> 49:17.380]  that was involved. And at some point, information from credit card records and financial transactions
[49:17.380 --> 49:24.860]  was married in with that information. So the lucky US citizens, tens of thousands of whom
[49:24.860 --> 49:30.900]  that are now on digital databases at NSA who have no idea of this, also have that sort
[49:30.900 --> 49:37.980]  of information included on those digital files that have been warehouse.
[49:37.980 --> 49:41.620]  Throwing that kind of information in there too, your credit card records, where you have
[49:41.620 --> 49:48.060]  spent your money, does that make it clear to you who used this information or why it
[49:48.060 --> 49:52.380]  was used or what the goal was of gaining it? Do you have any better idea of what all this
[49:52.380 --> 49:55.180]  stuff was used for?
[49:55.180 --> 50:03.340]  Well, the obvious explanation would be that if you did have a potential terrorist, you'd
[50:03.340 --> 50:07.580]  want to know where they're spending money and whether they purchased an airline ticket
[50:07.580 --> 50:13.860]  or something like that and that sort of thing. But once again, we're talking about tens of
[50:13.860 --> 50:20.140]  thousands of innocent US citizens that have been caught up in this trap that they have
[50:20.140 --> 50:25.900]  no clue. This thing could sit there for ten years and then potentially it marries up
[50:25.900 --> 50:28.860]  with something else in ten years from now, they get put on a note.
[50:28.860 --> 50:35.420]  And if you go to infowars.com, prisonplot.com, where you have this article linked, you will
[50:35.420 --> 50:41.300]  see that we have the previous articles where they admit they were spying on Congress and
[50:41.300 --> 50:45.300]  listing the people's phone sex. So that's what it's about. So this sounds like it's
[50:45.300 --> 50:50.140]  an expose. It's really a whitewash because the overall thing is, well, they abuse things
[50:50.140 --> 50:54.580]  but they're listening to all kinds of. No, they're not. Okay, they're tracking everything
[50:54.580 --> 51:02.580]  you do. They've got NSA listening over your cell phone even when it's off. Get that straight.
[51:02.580 --> 51:07.060]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty? What are you going to do once your
[51:07.060 --> 51:12.940]  food is gone? What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[51:12.940 --> 51:19.300]  Knowing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind. Getseeds.net
[51:19.300 --> 51:24.660]  is offering an amazing special on 100 different varieties of heirloom vegetable seeds with

[52:01.420 --> 52:06.660]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[52:06.660 --> 52:13.220]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. Who is the enemy? Bin Laden.
[52:13.220 --> 52:17.620]  This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[52:17.620 --> 52:22.140]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[52:22.140 --> 52:26.940]  networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis
[52:26.940 --> 52:33.700]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[52:33.700 --> 52:37.660]  have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers
[52:37.660 --> 52:42.420]  ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings
[52:42.420 --> 52:47.220]  and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD
[52:47.220 --> 52:53.980]  at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[52:53.980 --> 53:01.340]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[53:01.340 --> 53:05.820]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and
[53:05.820 --> 53:10.980]  what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future. In these troubled times, one of the
[53:10.980 --> 53:15.060]  most important things your family can have is good health. Some of the contributors to
[53:15.060 --> 53:20.260]  poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals. It's a documented fact.
[53:20.260 --> 53:26.300]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and
[53:26.300 --> 53:31.660]  parasitic infection. Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol
[53:31.660 --> 53:37.780]  naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with
[53:37.780 --> 53:44.020]  your favorite beverage once a day. FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[53:44.020 --> 53:51.140]  A two month supply starts at just $17. FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[53:51.140 --> 54:00.660]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll free at 8889493570. That's 8889493570.
[37:34.080 --> 54:26.100]  well also get into the cruel Obama hoax of claiming they're closing Guantanamo
[54:26.100 --> 54:30.220]  when they're just building camps here in the U.S. But at least they're having to claim
[54:30.220 --> 54:35.420]  they're doing it, showing it's unpopular. So it's being rebuked publicly. Coming up
[54:35.420 --> 54:41.540]  later in the hour, KRS-1 is going to be a guest. A couple weeks ago, he contacted us
[54:41.540 --> 54:45.780]  and said that he was a big fan of the work we do and that they wanted to get on the show
[54:45.780 --> 54:51.060]  in studio when he was here part of his Texas tour. And then we kind of assled around as
[54:51.060 --> 54:56.420]  they say. And so now he's just going to be on my end, not working out the right day when
[54:56.420 --> 55:01.660]  he was near Austin to get him in studio. He's in Dallas right now. I'm going to be speaking
[55:01.660 --> 55:10.100]  to school children up there. He's been instrumental in trying to stop the kind of gangster rap
[55:10.100 --> 55:16.660]  brothers killing brothers. And he's one of the pioneering founders of hip hop. And of
[55:16.660 --> 55:25.860]  course, he's also one of the most successful, just tens of millions of albums sold. So he's
[55:25.860 --> 55:32.060]  going to be joining us, KRS-1, calling in in the next 10 minutes or so from Texas. But
[55:32.060 --> 55:36.900]  he says next time he's back in Texas, he definitely wants to get in studio. So that is coming
[55:36.900 --> 55:44.580]  up a very important message there with KRS-1.
[55:44.580 --> 55:51.860]  On the subject of this radio show, we put a banner up on infowars.com on the right hand
[55:51.860 --> 56:00.520]  side about halfway down that says support the info war. It did say help us say the info
[56:00.520 --> 56:04.140]  war, but really the info war, I mean, we're doing okay. We're paying our bills. We've
[56:04.140 --> 56:09.460]  expanded some, but it's not enough. And we do see the economy contracting. And so we
[56:09.460 --> 56:14.540]  don't want to be doing this by the hair of our chinny chin chin. And so that banner is
[56:14.540 --> 56:17.340]  up there because people keep contacting us every day for months saying, hey, I want to
[56:17.340 --> 56:21.920]  donate. How do I donate? Well, you go to infowars.com and you go to that banner, help
[56:21.920 --> 56:26.420]  us save the info war, support the info war. And you click on there, we've got a PayPal.
[56:26.420 --> 56:32.380]  I'm going to put a Google pay on there. I'm also going to put a ship in people like different
[56:32.380 --> 56:39.440]  ways of contributing up there as well. And 100% of the donations will go into the operation
[56:39.440 --> 56:46.980]  funds here. 100% of those. I fund my own household when I do off of advertising, but most of
[56:46.980 --> 56:51.500]  that goes right back into the office as well. And to be able to hire more people, do a better
[56:51.500 --> 56:56.100]  job, make better and more frequent films with things getting so bad and our voice being
[56:56.100 --> 56:59.780]  heard by more and more, it's important that we don't just stay where we're at, but that
[56:59.780 --> 57:04.140]  we expand. And I think that any of you that believe that any of you that want to be part
[57:04.140 --> 57:09.180]  of that purchase the books, purchase the videos, plus they're great films and books at infowars.com
[57:09.180 --> 57:12.460]  and even if you're totally awake, people in your circle probably aren't given to them.
[57:12.460 --> 57:19.020]  That's a donation or just flat out donate or support our sponsors. Spread the word
[57:19.020 --> 57:23.180]  about the show. That's another way to support the broadcast because as we grow, we per capita
[57:23.180 --> 57:31.140]  end up getting more support as well. But it's really in your court. It is up to you whether
[57:31.140 --> 57:37.380]  or not we are able to grow and get more support and reach out to more people. Look at the
[57:37.380 --> 57:42.020]  amazing success we've had. You talk to people in the Patriot or Liberty or awakening movement,
[57:42.020 --> 57:46.820]  the anti-terror movement and Ron Paul said on air, half his support came from this show.
[57:46.820 --> 57:50.500]  I didn't ask him to say that. He said half the support came from the show. We talked
[57:50.500 --> 57:54.540]  to other activists and they say 80, 90% of the time when they ask how somebody woke up,
[57:54.540 --> 58:03.540]  it was this radio show or my films. So I mean, that's just amazing. That's quite a responsibility
[58:03.540 --> 58:10.900]  that we have. And so we're going to be attempting to expand what we're doing here. So I want
[58:10.900 --> 58:18.300]  to be clear. We're not in trouble. It's just that we want to do more. And frankly, we get
[58:18.300 --> 58:22.980]  more financial support. I will, I'll be able to spend my time focusing on issues and fighting
[58:22.980 --> 58:27.980]  the globalist and awakening people rather than worrying about, well, can I get a microphone?
[58:27.980 --> 58:32.940]  Can I get a camera? Can I get this server we need? I mean, we need servers right now.
[58:32.940 --> 58:36.980]  And that's one reason prison planet forum was down. I mean, we need more support. Period.
[58:36.980 --> 58:42.460]  So please help us. Thank you. Be right back.

[58:55.580 --> 58:59.580]  and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food and water
[58:59.580 --> 59:03.220]  is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.

[59:07.140 --> 59:11.180]  in any emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your family in
[59:11.180 --> 59:15.820]  the final equation, but you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's

[59:47.900 --> 1:00:06.900]  horrible food. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big Brother.
[1:00:06.900 --> 1:00:14.300]  Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[1:00:14.300 --> 1:00:26.140]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:26.140 --> 1:00:32.020]  Coming up on about 5-10 minutes, we're going to have KRS-1 on a pioneering Bronx-based hip-hop
[1:00:32.020 --> 1:00:38.260]  group with a socially conscious message. Boogie Down Productions is the hip-hop vehicle of
[1:00:38.260 --> 1:00:45.500]  rapper Chris KRS-1. Parker originally formed the group with DJ Scott LaRock, who was gunned
[1:00:45.500 --> 1:00:51.100]  down in 87 while trying to break up a street fight and helped spark KRS as one's ambitious
[1:00:51.100 --> 1:00:54.460]  anti-violence crusade, which he's traveling around the country right now speaking to the
[1:00:54.460 --> 1:01:03.060]  youth. But it was BDP's productions blend of hip-hop with reggae, dance, and rock influences
[1:01:03.060 --> 1:01:10.620]  that set the group apart from other message-oriented rappers, as well as KRS-1's dexterous verbosity
[1:01:10.620 --> 1:01:15.540]  and blunt beat since. Growing up poor in Brooklyn, in the Bronx, Chris Parker was introduced
[1:01:15.540 --> 1:01:20.260]  to rap music through his mother's collection of discs, including some by the treacherous
[1:01:20.260 --> 1:01:25.820]  Three and Grandmaster Flash. Parker ran away from home at 13, began living on the streets
[1:01:25.820 --> 1:01:30.780]  during that day. He would read about philosophy and religion at the library, and at night
[1:01:30.780 --> 1:01:35.420]  he'd practice rapping at the homeless shelters where he lived. At age 17, he got his GED
[1:01:35.420 --> 1:01:41.180]  while staying in the Franklin Armory Shelter in the Bronx. Parker met social worker Scott
[1:01:41.180 --> 1:01:48.820]  Sterling, known on weekends as DJ Scott LaRock. The two formed BDP and released Criminal Minded
[1:01:48.820 --> 1:01:53.860]  on the independent B-Boy label in 87, the album Smooth Grooves, and Hard Rhythm for
[1:01:53.860 --> 1:01:59.180]  Shadowed Gangster Rap. In August of that year, LaRock was murdered. Parker kept going with
[1:01:59.180 --> 1:02:05.540]  his brother Kenny, releasing, by all means necessary, No. 75 Pop, No. 18, R&B, 1988.
[1:02:05.540 --> 1:02:11.940]  The following year, the album introduced the rapper's style of rapping songs like Mr. My
[1:02:11.940 --> 1:02:17.700]  Philosophy and Stop the Violence, and the latter of which Parker turned into the movement
[1:02:17.700 --> 1:02:23.940]  in 1989 to help curb black-on-black violence. BDP's album sold relatively well, and it
[1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:28.140]  goes on with just scores of albums, millions and millions sold, and just one of the icons
[1:02:28.140 --> 1:02:33.860]  out there of hip-hop and speaking out for 9-11 Truth and a lot of other issues. So that's
[1:02:33.860 --> 1:02:39.460]  why we're going to be having him on the show today.
[1:02:39.460 --> 1:02:49.260]  After he leaves us, we have another guest coming on the show dealing with how the government
[1:02:49.260 --> 1:02:53.380]  and private institutions are going to sue people on behalf of animals. And it sounds
[1:02:53.380 --> 1:02:56.940]  like it's for the touchy-feely little furry bunny rabbits and things. Nothing to do with
[1:02:56.940 --> 1:03:01.420]  that. It's about coming and taking people's property or shutting down people's companies
[1:03:01.420 --> 1:03:05.780]  and saying or taxing them or fining them or feeding them and saying, oh, because you hurt
[1:03:05.780 --> 1:03:12.260]  the animals, and they say the government will speak for those animals. So just something
[1:03:12.260 --> 1:03:16.460]  again that sounds good, but that is a great tyranny, just like they're going to use the
[1:03:16.460 --> 1:03:20.660]  polar bears claiming they're endangered when they're not. They're at record numbers, 40-plus
[1:03:20.660 --> 1:03:26.740]  thousand of them just in the Northern Hemisphere, well, just in the western part of the Northern
[1:03:26.740 --> 1:03:32.340]  Hemisphere. There's even more over in more than Russian places, and they're just totally
[1:03:32.340 --> 1:03:36.580]  hyping this up so they can then regulate, take land, control who gets to build. But
[1:03:36.580 --> 1:03:41.260]  in the big corporations, they always get the waiver. They're always left alone and allowed
[1:03:41.260 --> 1:03:44.220]  to go forward with that.
[1:03:44.220 --> 1:03:49.380]  Also coming up, Obama officially orders Gitmo closure. U.S. President Barack Obama has signed
[1:03:49.380 --> 1:03:55.340]  an official order for the Guantanamo Bay detention facility to be closed within the next year.
[1:03:55.340 --> 1:04:00.100]  The newly inaugurated U.S. President inked three new executive orders earlier on Thursday,
[1:04:00.100 --> 1:04:04.740]  one of which requires the infamous Cuba-based prison to be shut down within the next year.
[1:04:04.740 --> 1:04:09.900]  The move comes on the second full day of Obama serving in the White House and on the heels
[1:04:09.900 --> 1:04:14.540]  of his promise to take a practical, pragmatic approach to foreign policy. The orders will
[1:04:14.540 --> 1:04:21.060]  also shut down CIA detention centers worldwide, as well as establish an interagency task force
[1:04:21.060 --> 1:04:26.220]  and procedure to decide on how to go forward with the detainees. All U.S. interrogators
[1:04:26.220 --> 1:04:30.580]  will be required to adhere to the rules set forth by the Army Field Manual, which is what
[1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:35.340]  we've been hearing for three, four years. That's the same thing. They claim they're
[1:04:35.340 --> 1:04:38.180]  adhering to the Army Field Manual. If you read the fine print, they say they're going
[1:04:38.180 --> 1:04:43.540]  to keep Guantanamo open for a year and then move people to other bases and other camps.
[1:04:43.540 --> 1:04:48.580]  So the good news here is the people have rejected these secret death camps and secret torture
[1:04:48.580 --> 1:04:53.140]  centers, and so the establishment's having to claim that they're reversing it. But the
[1:04:53.140 --> 1:05:02.180]  sad part is, is that it appears they're not going to reverse any of it. Stay with us.
[1:05:02.180 --> 1:05:05.900]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[1:05:05.900 --> 1:05:10.020]  problems facing the U.S. and the world. And for the first time in their lives, they are
[1:05:10.020 --> 1:05:14.860]  feeling the need for preparedness. Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation,
[1:05:14.860 --> 1:05:19.540]  manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years. Ready Reserve is the
[1:05:19.540 --> 1:05:24.220]  manufacturer. Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls

[1:05:38.740 --> 1:05:43.340]  days. Many companies do not even offer a catalog. We will be more than happy to send a catalog

[1:06:01.100 --> 1:06:06.220]  The day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:06:06.220 --> 1:06:12.420]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. Who is the enemy? Bin Laden.
[1:06:12.420 --> 1:06:17.060]  This is his ammo. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:06:17.060 --> 1:06:21.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:06:21.700 --> 1:06:26.500]  networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis
[1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:33.260]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[1:06:33.260 --> 1:06:38.580]  have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[1:06:38.580 --> 1:06:42.820]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[1:06:42.820 --> 1:06:48.700]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.

[1:08:01.540 --> 1:08:08.540]  Please, the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:08.540 --> 1:08:16.460]  All right, to the bottom of the hour, KRS-1 is our guest. He's on a Texas tour. He's
[1:08:16.460 --> 1:08:21.060]  coming up a little while. He's in North Texas, going to be speaking to a group of high schoolers
[1:08:21.060 --> 1:08:27.860]  about how horrible the shoot-em-up culture is that we have. Not just with black youth,
[1:08:27.860 --> 1:08:34.100]  with Hispanic whites. It's happening in rural areas. He really speaks out against all the
[1:08:34.100 --> 1:08:39.980]  gangster rap, go out and kill each other, go out, deal drugs, all of that. He has really
[1:08:39.980 --> 1:08:44.660]  turned millions of people away from that, but he's a pioneering hip hopper, so millions
[1:08:44.660 --> 1:08:51.060]  and millions of records. In August of 1987, his partner, LaRoc, was murdered, and that's
[1:08:51.060 --> 1:08:57.100]  what got him going on a stop the violence movement that went nationwide in 1989. Again,
[1:08:57.100 --> 1:09:00.860]  this is the good hip hop. This is the stuff that's really uplifting, and he just does
[1:09:00.860 --> 1:09:07.140]  an amazing job. He's also involved with 9-Eleven Truth, and he's anti-war. We're just really
[1:09:07.140 --> 1:09:12.100]  excited to have KRS-1 on the show with us. It's great to have you, sir.
[1:09:12.100 --> 1:09:13.700]  Hello, how are you?
[1:09:13.700 --> 1:09:16.860]  Good. Tell us what you're doing in Texas right now.
[1:09:16.860 --> 1:09:23.540]  Well, you know, you could tell by my voice. Last night, we were in Dallas screaming at
[1:09:23.540 --> 1:09:32.100]  the audience to stop the violence, and it's funny because people don't seem to act until
[1:09:32.100 --> 1:09:43.660]  you act, and this is why we're here, to cause peace. We did a community college yesterday
[1:09:43.660 --> 1:09:50.980]  where we discussed violence and discussed the role of violence in society, meaning that
[1:09:50.980 --> 1:09:57.980]  nature, we discussed at the college that nature is violent, and, really, violence is sort
[1:09:57.980 --> 1:10:05.540]  of like morality, that it is very selective when it comes to your society, like you have
[1:10:05.540 --> 1:10:12.060]  natural violence, but then we supposed to have civilization where we rise above the
[1:10:12.060 --> 1:10:18.980]  natural state of humanity, really, and kind of get along with one another if I may use
[1:10:18.980 --> 1:10:25.140]  a better term, you know, just be civilized if you can, try to love one another, try to
[1:10:25.140 --> 1:10:32.260]  respect one another, you know, this kind of thing, but if your leaders are pushing violence,
[1:10:32.260 --> 1:10:37.180]  if all you see on television is this is the way you're going to solve a problem, bash
[1:10:37.180 --> 1:10:43.380]  the guy's head in, and even verbally to say, well, you got to get a little aggressive with
[1:10:43.380 --> 1:10:50.140]  your voice, everything that points to aggression later on in life points to stress, points
[1:10:50.140 --> 1:10:57.100]  to anxiety, and most important, guilt, and so we were trying to tell the kids yesterday
[1:10:57.100 --> 1:11:03.980]  which many of them totally understood what was going on, we said, look, Stanford University
[1:11:03.980 --> 1:11:11.260]  says that violence is caused in society by illiteracy, like if you can't read, you know,
[1:11:11.260 --> 1:11:16.020]  you express yourself physically, now I don't know if I agree with that totally, but I'm
[1:11:16.020 --> 1:11:25.380]  just citing the study, the United Nations points out that poverty is the cause of violence,
[1:11:25.380 --> 1:11:30.340]  if you don't have enough to eat, nothing on your back, nothing over your head, you're
[1:11:30.340 --> 1:11:37.820]  quick enough to lash out at somebody, okay, the Pentagon has done studies in the 40s,
[1:11:37.820 --> 1:11:42.380]  50s, right through to today, that within four days of no food or water, most people start
[1:11:42.380 --> 1:11:48.740]  stealing, within 10 to 15, 90 plus percent of people start murdering for food, so that's
[1:11:48.740 --> 1:11:49.740]  just a fact.
[1:11:49.740 --> 1:11:58.980]  Wow, why you just added to my lexicon of truth here, wow, really, four days?
[1:11:58.980 --> 1:12:05.580]  Absolutely, and then over 90 percent will start killing after 10 to 15, depending on where
[1:12:05.580 --> 1:12:06.580]  they did the study.
[1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:13.220]  You know, this is important for leadership because in a lot of ways our society is kept
[1:12:13.220 --> 1:12:19.780]  deprived so that these violent acts can continue, and people make money on violence, which was
[1:12:19.780 --> 1:12:26.020]  my last point, which I think resonates well with young people, you know, young people
[1:12:26.020 --> 1:12:32.820]  don't want to be slaves, simple and plain, and when you point out that, you know, if
[1:12:32.820 --> 1:12:40.700]  you can't control yourself or at least find another way to resolve conflict, you know,
[1:12:40.700 --> 1:12:44.380]  you're playing into that game, that prison industrial complex.
[1:12:44.380 --> 1:12:48.420]  Man, you've discovered the same thing that I've discovered, but you articulate it simpler
[1:12:48.420 --> 1:12:53.540]  and in a better succinct way than I do, that I found that if you tell young people, you
[1:12:53.540 --> 1:12:56.380]  know, don't go out and fight, don't go out and do drugs, don't go, you know, that's
[1:12:56.380 --> 1:13:01.060]  for older people or you'll get in trouble, they'll still go do it, but if you explain
[1:13:01.060 --> 1:13:05.420]  to them that this is a system, that the system wants them to get in trouble and wants to
[1:13:05.420 --> 1:13:11.460]  get them in the system and that they win by being professional, by doing well in life
[1:13:11.460 --> 1:13:16.620]  as the French say, best revenge is living well, that they win, then, I mean, that's
[1:13:16.620 --> 1:13:20.460]  one of the things I like about the black Muslim movement, I have some criticisms as well,
[1:13:20.460 --> 1:13:25.620]  but I mean, overall, they have that message and it has really been successful for a lot
[1:13:25.620 --> 1:13:26.620]  of folks.
[1:13:26.620 --> 1:13:34.140]  Yeah, yeah, and the point is that our children are not stupid, our young people are not
[1:13:34.140 --> 1:13:35.140]  stupid.
[1:13:35.140 --> 1:13:41.940]  If you explain that this is all part of a plan to keep you subordinate to commercial
[1:13:41.940 --> 1:13:49.060]  interests, your little act of violence is a ticket for you to now become part of the
[1:13:49.060 --> 1:13:52.460]  problem, really, on a social level.
[1:13:52.460 --> 1:13:57.260]  It's what you said, it's what you said, I mean, it's the new slavery, they want to institutionalize
[1:13:57.260 --> 1:14:02.580]  you, get you on welfare, get you in prison, get you in the psychiatric system, get you
[1:14:02.580 --> 1:14:03.580]  in debt.
[1:14:03.580 --> 1:14:09.220]  Yeah, get you in debt, more importantly, by telling you, you know, well, not even by
[1:14:09.220 --> 1:14:16.300]  telling you, but, wow, you just pointed out, I just think, in the courts, when you are,
[1:14:16.300 --> 1:14:27.140]  I guess, given justice, if they call it that, that they say you're paying your debt to society,
[1:14:27.140 --> 1:14:33.500]  and this is very important, paying your debt, what debt, what debt do you incur, you know,
[1:14:33.500 --> 1:14:38.780]  what did you get for free, you know, that you now have to pay for, what did you, you
[1:14:38.780 --> 1:14:46.060]  know, invest in, to cause you now to have debt, and the issue is, is that once you
[1:14:46.060 --> 1:14:53.540]  explain that to our children, you say, you are being suckered, they rise, they rise right
[1:14:53.540 --> 1:15:02.980]  up and say, oh, now I get it, you know, peace, peace is a revolutionary strategy, as opposed
[1:15:02.980 --> 1:15:04.620]  to something to attain.
[1:15:04.620 --> 1:15:10.940]  Man, that's, that's beautiful, and they also sell being warlike, and getting in fights
[1:15:10.940 --> 1:15:15.180]  in the media, but then they put you in jail when you do it, as some, as strength, but
[1:15:15.180 --> 1:15:19.220]  it takes more strength to learn to control yourself and not be fooled.
[1:15:19.220 --> 1:15:26.380]  Right, and, and this is what Dr. King taught, a restraint, self-restraint in the face of
[1:15:26.380 --> 1:15:33.700]  injustice, if you join in on the injustice, you weaken your argument, you weaken yourself,
[1:15:33.700 --> 1:15:41.420]  but if you can stand up to it, and show the hypocrisy by being the victim of injustice,
[1:15:41.420 --> 1:15:46.780]  and if you can withstand it, if you have the strength, the courage to withstand it, it
[1:15:46.780 --> 1:15:52.660]  always shows itself to be hypocritical, and no matter how powerful the opposition would
[1:15:52.660 --> 1:16:04.500]  be, they fall, they fall, as we've just seen Bush fly away, and wow.
[1:16:04.500 --> 1:16:06.980]  Shifting gear is a limited time we have with you, I can't wait until next time you're in
[1:16:06.980 --> 1:16:14.500]  Texas, you can come in studio here, 9-11 Truth, the New World Order, Eugenics, all the things
[1:16:14.500 --> 1:16:17.620]  that are going on, I know you're aware of a lot of that, give us your bottom line take
[1:16:17.620 --> 1:16:18.620]  on that.
[1:16:18.620 --> 1:16:29.100]  You know, you know, not to get into any Obama bashing, not to, you know, these glorious
[1:16:29.100 --> 1:16:31.300]  happy days for African-Americans.
[1:16:31.300 --> 1:16:34.940]  Well, you're welcome, you're welcome to say whatever you say.
[1:16:34.940 --> 1:16:43.260]  Here you go, but you know what, I will be truthful, and one of the things I point out
[1:16:43.260 --> 1:16:54.060]  is that, you know, the New World Order has no color, no race, no face, it's an ideology,
[1:16:54.060 --> 1:17:02.700]  and just because we have an African-American president, does this now make us more palatable
[1:17:02.700 --> 1:17:14.860]  to the agendas of a New World Order, a New World system, the whole world working, still,
[1:17:14.860 --> 1:17:21.020]  just because we have an African-American president, does that erase the agenda that we already
[1:17:21.020 --> 1:17:23.500]  know is underway?
[1:17:23.500 --> 1:17:30.140]  And this is something that I speak about often when you talk about New World Order, you know,
[1:17:30.140 --> 1:17:37.380]  as we cheer Obama on, as we hope for a New World, and underline that, we hope for a New
[1:17:37.380 --> 1:17:43.020]  World, there are those who are saying, yes, we're willing to give you that New World.
[1:17:43.020 --> 1:17:50.380]  You know, we're not going to get our New World Order with this guy who looks like this, or
[1:17:50.380 --> 1:17:56.020]  may come from this background, because it's all cosmetic.
[1:17:56.020 --> 1:18:07.660]  So why don't we take away this color, or more culture, background, ethnicity, a rhetoric,
[1:18:07.660 --> 1:18:14.220]  and let's give you the rhetoric, the color, the guy you like, so, so that-
[1:18:14.220 --> 1:18:17.380]  You know what, KRS, stay there, I told him to play this song, but go ahead and cut it.
[1:18:17.380 --> 1:18:18.380]  We're going to come back with that.
[1:18:18.380 --> 1:18:19.380]  I don't want to interrupt you.
[1:18:19.380 --> 1:18:24.940]  I don't want to interrupt you, start over, this is, in fact, let's skip this break, John,
[1:18:24.940 --> 1:18:29.500]  let's skip this break at PresidentPlanet.tv, because I want to skip this break right now.
[1:18:29.500 --> 1:18:32.500]  Start over, because this is such an important point, again, the way you boil it down, that
[1:18:32.500 --> 1:18:37.060]  would take me an hour to explain this, is that I'm happy we've got an African-American
[1:18:37.060 --> 1:18:38.060]  president.
[1:18:38.060 --> 1:18:41.620]  That's great, because I want everybody to live in peace, and I mean, but I wish that
[1:18:41.620 --> 1:18:46.060]  he wasn't a globalist, I wish I knew, because I've studied it, that it wasn't a deception,
[1:18:46.060 --> 1:18:51.260]  I wish that in the end it's going to turn people against each other, because he's going
[1:18:51.260 --> 1:18:55.620]  to be able to ram through the New World Order agenda, and now when I oppose it, people are
[1:18:55.620 --> 1:18:58.140]  going to think I don't like him because he's black.
[1:18:58.140 --> 1:19:03.460]  Right, and this is what African-Americans, if you're listening right now to this show,
[1:19:03.460 --> 1:19:06.300]  we can't get caught up in this.
[1:19:06.300 --> 1:19:12.540]  Truth has to be the new agenda for why you argue truth, 9-11 truth.
[1:19:12.540 --> 1:19:18.380]  Truth, if you've got information, if you know what's going on, you can't deny the
[1:19:18.380 --> 1:19:19.380]  truth.
[1:19:19.380 --> 1:19:28.980]  And as much as I appreciate just the fact that I know my elders and ancestors wished
[1:19:28.980 --> 1:19:38.140]  for this day, they wished for an African-American president, but then when you ask my people,
[1:19:38.140 --> 1:19:44.980]  but why do you want an African-American president, what do you think an African-American president
[1:19:44.980 --> 1:19:50.420]  is going to do different than any other ethnic group that becomes president?
[1:19:50.420 --> 1:19:55.100]  What do you think we all become stumped at that point?
[1:19:55.100 --> 1:20:02.700]  We all start talking about just this blind loyalty, which is what I'm pretty much concerned
[1:20:02.700 --> 1:20:08.580]  with, which is what my point is, this blind loyalty, or just because he's African-American,
[1:20:08.580 --> 1:20:15.260]  he's not to be scrutinized or to be linked really with that global agenda.
[1:20:15.260 --> 1:20:23.380]  So once we cheer him on, we respect, we're proud, we're this, we're that, we all talking
[1:20:23.380 --> 1:20:28.180]  about getting back to work and rolling our sleeves up, and we got work to do in America,
[1:20:28.180 --> 1:20:30.300]  but what work are you doing?
[1:20:30.300 --> 1:20:31.300]  Exactly.
[1:20:31.300 --> 1:20:35.420]  Notice there's no specifics in what he says, but then when you look at what he's really
[1:20:35.420 --> 1:20:42.780]  saying, a domestic 18-24 military boot camp to serve the government, and he says, I want
[1:20:42.780 --> 1:20:47.140]  a new world order, and all of his advisors are involved in eugenics.
[1:20:47.140 --> 1:20:54.660]  And then one of the first things he does is fund abortions and the whole UN agenda, which
[1:20:54.660 --> 1:20:58.660]  we know is euthanasia, and so much more in Africa, in China.
[1:20:58.660 --> 1:21:01.660]  I mean, that's the thing, a year ago when Obama said, I'm going to end the warrantless
[1:21:01.660 --> 1:21:04.740]  wiretapping, I'm going to get us out of the war.
[1:21:04.740 --> 1:21:09.100]  I went on there and said, okay, if he doesn't bait and switch, I like Barack Obama.
[1:21:09.100 --> 1:21:13.300]  But then automatically he started, he started turning up, and again, he's well-spoken, he's
[1:21:13.300 --> 1:21:17.900]  charismatic, he isn't this little devilish creature, Bush, who's arrogant.
[1:21:17.900 --> 1:21:22.580]  I mean, he comes off really slick, but I mean, that's what's so scary is that I know it's
[1:21:22.580 --> 1:21:28.020]  a giant new world order scion because he says, everybody get behind me, I'll make it better,
[1:21:28.020 --> 1:21:29.460]  you know, I'll fix it all.
[1:21:29.460 --> 1:21:34.940]  Meanwhile, the banker bailout is 8.5 trillion and growing by offshore banks, which we're
[1:21:34.940 --> 1:21:36.580]  going to have to pay back in taxes.
[1:21:36.580 --> 1:21:38.060]  It's the total new world order takeover.
[1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:41.700]  I mean, can you specifically speak to what you were starting to get into earlier when
[1:21:41.700 --> 1:21:45.060]  we almost got cut off there with the break coming in that I ended?
[1:21:45.060 --> 1:21:51.300]  I mean, specifically, if you had one minute to warn Americans, not just black Americans,
[1:21:51.300 --> 1:21:58.100]  to not hate Obama, but to just don't suspend disbelief, don't mindlessly turn yourself
[1:21:58.100 --> 1:22:02.660]  over to him, because we saw that with Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and others, I mean, every time
[1:22:02.660 --> 1:22:09.420]  in history, we see people just mindlessly get behind something, it normally turns bad.
[1:22:09.420 --> 1:22:15.300]  You actually summed it up right there, that mindless loyalty is really, and that's beyond
[1:22:15.300 --> 1:22:16.300]  African Americans.
[1:22:16.300 --> 1:22:22.060]  I mean, I would respectfully start with African Americans because this is how the issue's
[1:22:22.060 --> 1:22:29.380]  being played out, that this is our president, that this is our victory, that somehow we
[1:22:29.380 --> 1:22:37.460]  are to be a static because as an African American president, and in a cosmetic sense, I can
[1:22:37.460 --> 1:22:44.980]  join in on that rhetoric, but in a truthful sense, in a scholarly sense, even in a godly
[1:22:44.980 --> 1:22:53.940]  sense, it's not about the president at all, to give you an example, everyone's putting
[1:22:53.940 --> 1:23:01.380]  the economy on Barack Obama, say, you know, he has a plan for the economy, and he's going
[1:23:01.380 --> 1:23:06.740]  to do this for the economy, and what is your plan, President Obama, for the economy?
[1:23:06.740 --> 1:23:10.700]  Not realizing that the economy has nothing to do with him.
[1:23:10.700 --> 1:23:17.460]  It's run by offshore private banks, and that's the thing, is that he's this big diversion
[1:23:17.460 --> 1:23:21.940]  and big distraction when he is a puppet, just like Bush was a puppet, if he tries to become
[1:23:21.940 --> 1:23:26.100]  a real president, it's what Hugo Chavez said last week, they'll do what they did to Kennedy.
[1:23:26.100 --> 1:23:33.460]  Exactly, and Martin and all the others, now here's the point, if he tries to be a president
[1:23:33.460 --> 1:23:39.740]  for the people for real, he's going to have to go against the corporate structure that
[1:23:39.740 --> 1:23:47.060]  actually holds the country together, that actually put him in office, there was arguments
[1:23:47.060 --> 1:23:53.860]  that Hillary Clinton made in the campaign, which I find ridiculous, I mean, not her
[1:23:53.860 --> 1:24:01.180]  statements, but the fact that in politics, you argue with each other, you pull out everyone's
[1:24:01.180 --> 1:24:07.340]  faults, he ain't this, she ain't that, you did this, you said that, that whoever wins,
[1:24:07.340 --> 1:24:12.060]  you kind of push all that to the side and say, well now we have to support this guy
[1:24:12.060 --> 1:24:19.420]  here and this is what it is, the president is like the manager of Burger King, you know,
[1:24:19.420 --> 1:24:24.980]  when your fries are cold, when your hamburger isn't done right, you go to the manager and
[1:24:24.980 --> 1:24:30.820]  you say, my fries are cold, I want a new hamburger, give me my money back, and the manager is
[1:24:30.820 --> 1:24:37.900]  there specifically to deal with your gripes, but you never get to speak to the franchise
[1:24:37.900 --> 1:24:46.700]  owner of Burger King, you never get to speak to the ones that really run the show and this
[1:24:46.700 --> 1:24:51.460]  is the part right here, and you said that one minute, we kind of went over that, if
[1:24:51.460 --> 1:24:59.620]  there was one warning to give, it is do not mindlessly follow anyone, no one is worthy
[1:24:59.620 --> 1:25:04.460]  of being mindlessly followed, no matter what race they are, what religion, whatever they
[1:25:04.460 --> 1:25:09.780]  could drop out of the sky, you're not to be mindlessly followed because number one, that's
[1:25:09.780 --> 1:25:16.060]  un-American, true American, if we can get back over to that, that real aspect of checking
[1:25:16.060 --> 1:25:24.780]  your government, being your own law unto yourself, being independent, see this idea of supporting
[1:25:24.780 --> 1:25:30.820]  the president the way we are doing it, the way we meaning African Americans in particular
[1:25:30.820 --> 1:25:36.860]  is taking away our independence, our independent thought, are we going to check this guy for
[1:25:36.860 --> 1:25:45.020]  real, are we just going to go along with the, you know, the dollar is sinking and you know
[1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:54.300]  they want to make Mexico, America, and Canada one thing, so to speak, what is going to happen
[1:25:54.300 --> 1:26:01.700]  to the United States because when you have this much debt, the only way out of it is
[1:26:01.700 --> 1:26:08.700]  either to enslave the people or the people go to war against their debtors, and this
[1:26:08.700 --> 1:26:12.100]  too was American, if I got the country started.
[1:26:12.100 --> 1:26:15.580]  And that's why they're moving in the troops in Northcom because they know what they're
[1:26:15.580 --> 1:26:20.860]  about to do to us, our only normal response would be to physically fight back, and listen
[1:26:20.860 --> 1:26:23.820]  sir, I know you've got to go speak to that high school, I'm not limiting you, if you
[1:26:23.820 --> 1:26:27.100]  want to hold to 40 after we can do it, but I know you've got to get in the car and go
[1:26:27.100 --> 1:26:31.380]  over and speak to that group, we'll do whatever you need to, but here's the big point, my
[1:26:31.380 --> 1:26:38.140]  big fear, I would love a, you know, patriotic, anti-new world order, constitutionalist,
[1:26:38.140 --> 1:26:43.540]  black president, I would bow down and kiss his feet, and I see the trap here, in the
[1:26:43.540 --> 1:26:48.860]  end when everything falls apart and it doesn't work because it's designed not to, Obama's
[1:26:48.860 --> 1:26:53.020]  going to get blamed for everything and then that's going to really destroy black and
[1:26:53.020 --> 1:26:57.220]  white relations, which in my life I've seen getting really good, and this whole thing's
[1:26:57.220 --> 1:27:00.940]  going to turn into a nightmare, and I know the new world order is fundamentally racist
[1:27:00.940 --> 1:27:05.780]  and really does hate black people for my study, and I believe this is a trap, I believe
[1:27:05.780 --> 1:27:07.580]  this is the ultimate suckering.
[1:27:07.580 --> 1:27:19.020]  Not only can I take that in as advice, but you are absolutely correct because what we
[1:27:19.020 --> 1:27:28.740]  got to look at is something is being set up, I mean do you really think that the order
[1:27:28.740 --> 1:27:36.060]  of the world, which is really, just take resources, keep people stupid, turn us into batteries
[1:27:36.060 --> 1:27:43.100]  so to speak, if this agenda, how can that agenda just go away with a new president?
[1:27:43.100 --> 1:27:49.980]  Either we're talking real war in the future, like civil war, here in the country, in the
[1:27:49.980 --> 1:27:58.300]  future, or we're talking about again, a few of us having knowledge and having freedom,
[1:27:58.300 --> 1:28:02.460]  because that's really what knowledge, really what freedom is, is knowledge when you're
[1:28:02.460 --> 1:28:11.340]  aware and they know you're aware, they really can't do much to you, even to the point of
[1:28:11.340 --> 1:28:21.980]  murder or trying to incarcerate you illegally, if you walk with the truth, if you have awareness,
[1:28:21.980 --> 1:28:28.380]  if you're one of the people like yourself, Mr. Jones, putting truth out there, making
[1:28:28.380 --> 1:28:34.500]  people think you're the one that they fear, and let me tell you, power only respects
[1:28:34.500 --> 1:28:40.860]  power, it only respects fear, it respects its own fears, it's not like what people think
[1:28:40.860 --> 1:28:47.340]  or many people fear me, so they're gonna kill me, no, it's they, if you don't, if you're
[1:28:47.340 --> 1:28:52.420]  going along with it like sheep, you're going to the slaughter, exactly, I've noticed the
[1:28:52.420 --> 1:28:56.340]  opposite when you actually have a little bit of power, they respect you and smile at you
[1:28:56.340 --> 1:29:01.700]  and fear you, it's when you're, it's when you grovel to them, it's when you grovel,
[1:29:01.700 --> 1:29:06.380]  when you grovel, that's when your head gets chopped off, but if you stand on your feet
[1:29:06.380 --> 1:29:12.500]  and say, no, I'm prepared to go against you, even if you're not, even if you know you're
[1:29:12.500 --> 1:29:20.540]  up against some force that you can't win, if you stand up to it, nine times out of ten,
[1:29:20.540 --> 1:29:28.580]  it collapses, because their power is artificial, fake, and it's all about your compliance to
[1:29:28.580 --> 1:29:29.580]  their authority.
[1:29:29.580 --> 1:29:34.420]  All right, KRS-1, KRS-1, we've got to take this break, I skipped the last one, can you
[1:29:34.420 --> 1:29:38.060]  do ten more minutes, or can you come back, ten more minutes, come on, all right, you're
[1:29:38.060 --> 1:29:41.060]  the best, and you gotta go speak to those young people, and that's so important, I wish
[1:29:41.060 --> 1:29:44.540]  we would have gotten things worked out and gotten you in studio, but God bless you and
[1:29:44.540 --> 1:29:49.540]  your team for reaching out to us, because we're big fans of you as well, KRS-1 is our guest,
[1:29:49.540 --> 1:29:51.940]  stay with us.

[1:30:01.620 --> 1:30:06.980]  are strange new days, foreclosures are at record highs, people are losing their jobs,
[1:30:06.980 --> 1:30:11.940]  the threat of a terrorist attack looms, food supplies are at an all-time low, and now we
[1:30:11.940 --> 1:30:16.580]  have a new untested president, the time of change is upon us, and to those of you who
[1:30:16.580 --> 1:30:22.220]  are in the know, you realize that the most difficult times have yet to be seen, self-preparedness

[1:31:01.420 --> 1:31:06.980]  Day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[1:31:06.980 --> 1:31:07.980]  this country.
[1:31:07.980 --> 1:31:11.980]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, who is the enemy?
[1:31:11.980 --> 1:31:12.980]  Bin Laden.
[1:31:12.980 --> 1:31:13.980]  This is his MO.
[1:31:13.980 --> 1:31:17.380]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:31:17.380 --> 1:31:21.460]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[1:31:21.460 --> 1:31:24.620]  intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:31:24.620 --> 1:31:29.100]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:31:29.100 --> 1:31:31.260]  in and on the U.S.
[1:31:31.260 --> 1:31:34.940]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:34.940 --> 1:31:40.420]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:31:40.420 --> 1:31:44.460]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[1:31:44.460 --> 1:31:46.620]  much more, fabled enemies.

[1:33:07.260 --> 1:33:26.620]  We tried to work out getting K.R.S. here in studio with us, with his folks, but they
[1:33:26.620 --> 1:33:29.340]  ran out of time getting down here, they're up on Dallas right now, but he's coming into
[1:33:29.340 --> 1:33:33.820]  Austin for an event tomorrow, and he just brought up to meet her in the break, he said,
[1:33:33.820 --> 1:33:38.140]  aren't I coming into studio to tape something, so sometime tomorrow we're going to get him
[1:33:38.140 --> 1:33:41.380]  here in the studio, we're going to tape an hour-long interview, and then we'll air it
[1:33:41.380 --> 1:33:46.340]  live at PrisonPlanet.tv during the live radio show sometime next week.
[1:33:46.340 --> 1:33:49.940]  And I was just talking about Obama during the break, and he was saying, Alex, you know,
[1:33:49.940 --> 1:33:54.160]  you're talking about how he's slicker, you know, he's nicer, he doesn't just come off
[1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:56.940]  like a devil, I mean, Bush really comes off like a devil, looks like a devil, the way
[1:33:56.940 --> 1:34:01.220]  he do that demonic smile, like a gremlin or something, and then K.R.S. R1 had something
[1:34:01.220 --> 1:34:02.420]  important to say about that.
[1:34:02.420 --> 1:34:05.500]  So K.R.S. R1, say that in your own words.
[1:34:05.500 --> 1:34:12.540]  You know, the point was that, I was mentioning what you were saying was that Bush was more
[1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:18.700]  arrogant with his presentation, which is what pissed people off, it was the arrogance, it
[1:34:18.700 --> 1:34:23.100]  was, you know, what's going to do it in your face, you know, what was it, bring it on,
[1:34:23.100 --> 1:34:29.340]  that attitude, that pissed people off, but I was alluding to the fact that the devil
[1:34:29.340 --> 1:34:38.540]  is really the guy you like, you know, yeah, Bush does look a little demonic there or sounds
[1:34:38.540 --> 1:34:47.860]  such, but really when you study the devil, Satan, it's the palableness, it's the, it's
[1:34:47.860 --> 1:34:54.380]  alright, it's, I'm here for you, you know, you don't get none of the people telling
[1:34:54.380 --> 1:34:59.540]  them, look, I got these chains for you and you better do what I say or you're going to
[1:34:59.540 --> 1:35:00.540]  get any change.
[1:35:00.540 --> 1:35:04.140]  Oh, people are quick to rise up on that and say, no, this is not, I'm not going in no
[1:35:04.140 --> 1:35:10.300]  change and that's why, you know, Bush kind of embarrassed himself and his family in the
[1:35:10.300 --> 1:35:15.820]  entire world, which I want to get to as well because it's a controversial thing here, but
[1:35:15.820 --> 1:35:26.020]  yeah, the devil is palpable, it's very understanding of your problems, very approachable, it's
[1:35:26.020 --> 1:35:37.340]  God that is in the dark, scary places that requires not hope, but courage, courage, hope
[1:35:37.340 --> 1:35:45.700]  is for powerless people and this was something that Obama ran on and yes, me, I'm a philosopher,
[1:35:45.700 --> 1:35:53.540]  no doubt, hope, I know the, well, this is a false hope, this is a counterfeit of hope
[1:35:53.540 --> 1:36:00.900]  and they say the road to hell is wide, it's paved, the road to the truth, it isn't easy,
[1:36:00.900 --> 1:36:04.900]  it's painful, it's hard, I want to believe Obama is going to fix it, I want to believe
[1:36:04.900 --> 1:36:09.180]  my children's future is okay, I want to believe we're turning the tide and we are in a way
[1:36:09.180 --> 1:36:13.140]  that they're having to give us somebody this slick who says a lot of what we want to hear
[1:36:13.140 --> 1:36:20.740]  but then baits and switches, see to me that's the bigger deception, that's the bigger deception
[1:36:20.740 --> 1:36:29.180]  right there and now let me raise this point about the world and global with one presidency,
[1:36:29.180 --> 1:36:38.060]  okay, this Barack Obama presidency with one presidency, the entire world is now ready
[1:36:38.060 --> 1:36:45.420]  for the new world order, the world is ready, everyone's cheering him on, not just the United
[1:36:45.420 --> 1:36:56.100]  States but everybody is cheering him on and this could be a good thing only if he stands
[1:36:56.100 --> 1:37:02.420]  with the people and I don't know as a presidency, this is where I will yield in my point, I
[1:37:02.420 --> 1:37:12.580]  will stop here and yield in my point and say that time will tell, every time we get a president
[1:37:12.580 --> 1:37:20.020]  we don't like them in four years, no matter who they are, unless they pay us, now if you
[1:37:20.020 --> 1:37:26.260]  are getting paid and you got a bigger car, you put another room in the house, the new
[1:37:26.260 --> 1:37:31.700]  world order is good for you, it's nice, it feels good, in fact you don't care, go back
[1:37:31.700 --> 1:37:38.740]  to Nazi Germany, you can actually see people getting marched off, it's in railway cars
[1:37:38.740 --> 1:37:47.620]  but because it's not affecting you and you're doing pretty well, you can't allow it, so
[1:37:47.620 --> 1:37:56.780]  over the next four years, I'm not into abashing any president, when George Bush was in office,
[1:37:56.780 --> 1:38:02.420]  I warned my people against pointing fingers at him and not being able to govern your
[1:38:02.420 --> 1:38:08.660]  own house, not being able to respect your own leaders, I mean black people are selling
[1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:15.060]  crack cocaine on Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard, I speak against that as well, you want to
[1:38:15.060 --> 1:38:21.820]  praise Dr. King one breath but then you walk down the very street complying with what killed
[1:38:21.820 --> 1:38:30.180]  them and so really, this is about a people change, this is about the world should unite
[1:38:30.180 --> 1:38:36.700]  but it should unite against that mindless globalization, the world is already united,
[1:38:36.700 --> 1:38:46.940]  there's a new world order because there is already a true world order and you can't have
[1:38:46.940 --> 1:38:52.060]  an agenda where people say, we're going to put together a new world order, well then
[1:38:52.060 --> 1:38:59.180]  what is the old world order, what is the original world order, what is this new world order?
[1:38:59.180 --> 1:39:03.060]  That's really the old world order is tyranny and they're trying to sound like they're the
[1:39:03.060 --> 1:39:08.420]  new high tech thing so that they're claiming that all they've already done was it done
[1:39:08.420 --> 1:39:16.820]  by them and in that is the crux of everything, is that we have Barack Obama and he's coming
[1:39:16.820 --> 1:39:20.420]  in, he's a globalist, he's got all these globalist handlers, he's going along with
[1:39:20.420 --> 1:39:25.940]  a total banker takeover as they set up this new world bank that has bankrupted us by design
[1:39:25.940 --> 1:39:29.980]  in their own documents to get control and he's claiming he's going to fight all that
[1:39:29.980 --> 1:39:34.260]  but then with the other hand he's actually bringing that in as the front man, what are
[1:39:34.260 --> 1:39:37.180]  people going to do because I know they're going to carry it out, I know he's going
[1:39:37.180 --> 1:39:41.580]  to betray people but then try to put a spin on it and make them love their servitude,
[1:39:41.580 --> 1:39:45.340]  love their slavery, that's why I keep saying this is going to be painful, this is going
[1:39:45.340 --> 1:39:49.900]  to get hurt, just do what I say so they're trying to make the people love their loss
[1:39:49.900 --> 1:39:55.700]  of standard of living, they're trying to make being slaves be a good thing in the new change
[1:39:55.700 --> 1:39:59.620]  because we all feel good as we go off to be basically euthanized.
[1:39:59.620 --> 1:40:10.340]  You know, this is time to wake up for real, for real, it's time to wake up and wake up
[1:40:10.340 --> 1:40:16.460]  in such a way that it's really about preparation as well, more people need to speak up and
[1:40:16.460 --> 1:40:26.380]  start scrutinizing because even he said something which I'd like to hold our president to which
[1:40:26.380 --> 1:40:34.980]  is he said to other nations your people will judge you not by what you destroy but by what
[1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:43.300]  you can build, now I'd like to see what that really means here at home, what you can destroy
[1:40:43.300 --> 1:40:49.140]  versus what you can build, what are you going to build, what new thing are you going to
[1:40:49.140 --> 1:40:57.420]  build here and I think he's not held to that standard because we're so mesmerized, we're
[1:40:57.420 --> 1:41:04.220]  so hypnotized by the fact that this historical event has gone down, I'll say this last thing
[1:41:04.220 --> 1:41:13.620]  here, you know one thing I notice over history is that just because you have a black manager
[1:41:13.620 --> 1:41:21.740]  and notice the word manager, when the cities were really powerful they didn't allow black
[1:41:21.740 --> 1:41:28.340]  people to run those cities, it's when the city fell then you get a black mayor and when
[1:41:28.340 --> 1:41:36.420]  the states were powerful, you couldn't get a black statesman, a senator, it's when
[1:41:36.420 --> 1:41:44.300]  the state falls or has no more power, you can get a governor, a senator, etc.
[1:41:44.300 --> 1:41:52.420]  Now America has a black president, we have over 200 black mayors, look at our cities,
[1:41:52.420 --> 1:42:02.420]  we have black leadership all over the world, really if you just go by color, people of
[1:42:02.420 --> 1:42:07.140]  color are in offices all over the world, running countries all over, look at the state of the
[1:42:07.140 --> 1:42:08.140]  world.
[1:42:08.140 --> 1:42:13.580]  Well my god, this is very, I mean finish up, but this is veritas, this is a new thought,
[1:42:13.580 --> 1:42:18.260]  I just realized this, America's totally bankrupt in the new world order, we're essentially
[1:42:18.260 --> 1:42:22.340]  destroyed, we're already in the North American Union, those documents have been declassified,
[1:42:22.340 --> 1:42:27.540]  the public doesn't know and so absolutely you go to Bilderberg, except for Vernon Jordan,
[1:42:27.540 --> 1:42:31.580]  it's all white people, they're totally racist in their own writings and so now it's like
[1:42:31.580 --> 1:42:37.340]  a joke on America, they give us a messianic, slick, intelligent black guy to lead us and
[1:42:37.340 --> 1:42:42.140]  it's a joke on him and the American people and black folks because America is basically
[1:42:42.140 --> 1:42:52.380]  fallen, it is fallen already in a black president in a racist global ideology, tells you right
[1:42:52.380 --> 1:42:59.260]  there what the state of the country is in, look at the mayors and you'll see, well let
[1:42:59.260 --> 1:43:08.300]  me not go that far and prophesy, but I will say that we have precedence for this, we have
[1:43:08.300 --> 1:43:15.580]  precedence when our state, city or nation has already been bought and sold, the black
[1:43:15.580 --> 1:43:21.300]  man is put there to now run it and this is the other side of the argument, the other
[1:43:21.300 --> 1:43:28.700]  side of the argument is that maybe Barack Obama is not really part of the new world
[1:43:28.700 --> 1:43:33.100]  order, maybe he's not really part of the globalization and gotta just go along with
[1:43:33.100 --> 1:43:39.260]  it because it's just a job, one of the things I criticize my people about is that, oh I'm
[1:43:39.260 --> 1:43:45.900]  just doing my job attitude, that you're willing to deny truth as long as you can get what
[1:43:45.900 --> 1:43:54.380]  you want, in that sense maybe Barack Obama is ignorant if we can even swallow that.
[1:43:54.380 --> 1:44:06.860]  He's too smart, the guy's totally slick, he never messes up his lines, he's very well
[1:44:06.860 --> 1:44:14.860]  spoken, I mean look, bottom line sir, fire out the website and we're having a studio
[1:44:14.860 --> 1:44:18.900]  tomorrow, that's awesome, I'm very excited we'll call you and set that up, tell us about
[1:44:18.900 --> 1:44:24.060]  your websites, both your music and for your social movement against violence.
[1:44:24.060 --> 1:44:34.780]  You know this is the key to what I call my strategy, what I can do in society, we have
[1:44:34.780 --> 1:44:42.860]  a movement called Stop the Violence and this movement started in 1989 and one thing we talked
[1:44:42.860 --> 1:44:49.180]  about is that power respects power, you know when I put out the Stop the Violence movement
[1:44:49.180 --> 1:44:56.940]  before that my first record was called Criminal Minded and when we put that record out we
[1:44:56.940 --> 1:45:06.780]  were played everywhere, we were played everywhere, my image at the time was that street criminal
[1:45:06.780 --> 1:45:13.340]  image, you can go back and listen to it but in that image and it was only an image, I
[1:45:13.340 --> 1:45:19.580]  said while I was doing Criminal Minded I said but I'm a teacher and I'm coming here to show
[1:45:19.580 --> 1:45:24.940]  you I'm putting these calls on because these are the calls you respect, you respect murder,
[1:45:24.940 --> 1:45:31.420]  deceit, crime, they put that cloak on so that you can hear what I got to say, when I gathered
[1:45:31.420 --> 1:45:36.340]  my audience of 3 million which is what the record saw I quickly put out the Stop the
[1:45:36.340 --> 1:45:44.340]  Violence movement afterwards and it worked, it worked, people in my community, not everyone
[1:45:44.340 --> 1:45:49.580]  but people at least had a choice, they had an alternative, they had some other awareness
[1:45:49.580 --> 1:45:56.780]  that they could link their emotions to and it worked, 20 years later we're still playing
[1:45:56.780 --> 1:46:01.980]  with violence, violence is not going to leave humanity or the human experience.
[1:46:01.980 --> 1:46:06.540]  But it's not as bad as it was statistically especially in inner cities and I think a lot
[1:46:06.540 --> 1:46:10.300]  of it is because of you and that is just such important work, can you fire out the website,
[1:46:10.300 --> 1:46:11.300]  we'll put it on screen for folks?
[1:46:11.300 --> 1:46:19.500]  Wow, first of all let me pause for a minute, you just hit my heart right there, wow I appreciate
[1:46:19.500 --> 1:46:36.340]  that, website STVSITE.ORG but we advise people use the website only for information to get

[1:47:19.220 --> 1:47:23.340]  we should work something out there to support your movement as well, our movement through
[1:47:23.340 --> 1:47:30.580]  your voice I should say, yeah maybe I'll come there and drop some CDs and DVDs and not so
[1:47:30.580 --> 1:47:35.260]  much for sale but for giveaways online, on the air, well we've got your website up on

[1:47:48.140 --> 1:47:53.660]  We actually, the club name escapes me right now while they're knocking on my door right
[1:47:53.660 --> 1:48:00.260]  now, the club name escapes me, we're somewhere, I can't even remember right now.
[1:48:00.260 --> 1:48:06.220]  George can google chaosr1 in Austin, Texas, they will find it, KRS1, thank you so much
[1:48:06.220 --> 1:48:10.260]  for joining us and I can't wait to have you in studio tomorrow sir.
[1:48:10.260 --> 1:48:15.620]  Alex, hip hop stands with you, straight up, let me say that we stand with you and when
[1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:18.980]  it's time to get on the front line, you're going to look to your right and your left
[1:48:18.980 --> 1:48:21.100]  and I hope I'm right there with you.
[1:48:21.100 --> 1:48:25.980]  Well the info warriors, the we are changers, the 9-11 truthers, the lovers of liberty everywhere,
[1:48:25.980 --> 1:48:28.980]  stay with you my friend and I'll call you this afternoon and give you the address and
[1:48:28.980 --> 1:48:30.580]  I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
[1:48:30.580 --> 1:48:32.500]  We're going to get on that right now.
[1:48:32.500 --> 1:48:33.500]  God bless you.
[1:48:33.500 --> 1:48:34.500]  Peace.
[1:48:34.500 --> 1:48:39.100]  There he goes, KRS1 ladies and gentlemen, I apologize to my next guest, back him, we're
[1:48:39.100 --> 1:48:42.580]  going to have about 10 minutes if he's even still there, I don't normally make a guess
[1:48:42.580 --> 1:48:47.060]  whole but that was so wild and interesting and powerful information.
[1:48:47.060 --> 1:48:53.300]  A great article in the register I saw talking pets, Obama's guru wants animals to sue you
[1:48:53.300 --> 1:48:59.780]  and he's Andrew Orlundski, I hope I'm pronouncing that right and Andrew, thanks for coming
[1:48:59.780 --> 1:49:00.780]  on with us.
[1:49:00.780 --> 1:49:01.780]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[1:49:01.780 --> 1:49:02.780]  Thanks for having me on.
[1:49:02.780 --> 1:49:03.780]  Good, good.
[1:49:03.780 --> 1:49:06.500]  I want to have you back for a full hour sometime and I really want to pitch all the great stuff
[1:49:06.500 --> 1:49:10.300]  you're doing and I apologize to you, you're also an author, briefly then we're going
[1:49:10.300 --> 1:49:12.540]  to go to break and come back in the last five minutes.
[1:49:12.540 --> 1:49:16.980]  Tell us about Obama's new appointment, who he's moving forward with.
[1:49:16.980 --> 1:49:23.140]  This is Cass Sunstein and I think he's the regulatory star which I can guess that we're
[1:49:23.140 --> 1:49:26.900]  going to be getting more regulations and not fewer regulations.
[1:49:26.900 --> 1:49:32.220]  He wrote an article about six years ago saying that animals should be able to sue as they
[1:49:32.220 --> 1:49:37.940]  should bring class action suits with lawyers like Cass I guess speaking on the animals
[1:49:37.940 --> 1:49:41.500]  behalf.
[1:49:41.500 --> 1:49:47.340]  It's amazing and again they could care less about the animals, this is a cold blooded
[1:49:47.340 --> 1:49:52.980]  way for groups of people to overturn democracy saying well there's a small group of us but
[1:49:52.980 --> 1:49:55.980]  we represent the cockroaches and now we outnumber you.
[1:49:55.980 --> 1:50:00.980]  Yeah, I mean it's on the surface of it, it's a pretty funny story, I mean Cass here says
[1:50:00.980 --> 1:50:06.660]  we're going to ban all kinds of things including hunting which, you know, that ain't just going
[1:50:06.660 --> 1:50:07.660]  to happen.
[1:50:07.660 --> 1:50:13.460]  But there's also this movie, to me it's really kind of strange because it gives you, in his
[1:50:13.460 --> 1:50:17.380]  head there's a very idealized version of what animals are and we all think you know
[1:50:17.380 --> 1:50:21.700]  we should treat animals well but there's a very idealized version of what animals are
[1:50:21.700 --> 1:50:26.700]  and it kind of diminishes the idea of what humans are and what we can do, I think.
[1:50:26.700 --> 1:50:30.700]  Well if you don't, well if you don't kill rats they take your house over.
[1:50:30.700 --> 1:50:32.700]  Well, that's right.
[1:50:32.700 --> 1:50:40.900]  But yeah, I mean this is, when you kind of fight these things through the course, this
[1:50:40.900 --> 1:50:45.220]  is what struck me is odd and we're getting more of it in Europe I think more and more
[1:50:45.220 --> 1:50:53.220]  is when lawyers kind of speak on behalf of us, you've actually replaced democracy with
[1:50:53.220 --> 1:50:58.620]  something where a bunch of eggheads, you know, gradually speaking a language no one else
[1:50:58.620 --> 1:50:59.620]  could.
[1:50:59.620 --> 1:51:00.620]  They want to stay there, break it down for us, break it down for us, we've got to break
[1:51:00.620 --> 1:51:01.620]  it.
[1:51:01.620 --> 1:51:08.060]  Hey guys, hands are clear, the worldwide economic collapse is here, the military is being positioned
[1:51:08.060 --> 1:51:13.060]  for martial law, the mark of a beast is at hand, governments are calling for a new world
[1:51:13.060 --> 1:51:19.460]  cashless economic system, having a long-term food solution is your only hope to stay free.

[1:52:01.420 --> 1:52:07.020]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground Sierra
[1:52:07.020 --> 1:52:10.580]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:52:10.580 --> 1:52:15.860]  Seeds Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:52:15.860 --> 1:52:17.420]  to tell their story.

[1:52:26.460 --> 1:52:31.220]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[1:52:31.220 --> 1:52:33.500]  take action against their global masters.
[1:52:33.500 --> 1:52:36.620]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:52:36.620 --> 1:52:42.460]  He takes his hand off in year 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[1:52:54.460 --> 1:52:58.140]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[1:52:58.140 --> 1:53:00.860]  and bring in martial law.
[1:53:00.860 --> 1:53:04.860]  Phase 1 of the insetters' plan for a one-world government has been initiated with the recent
[1:53:04.860 --> 1:53:05.860]  bailout.
[1:53:05.860 --> 1:53:09.940]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a
[1:53:09.940 --> 1:53:14.780]  new currency and a new world bank to act as saviour, but we've only seen the beginning.
[1:53:14.780 --> 1:53:18.860]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[1:53:18.860 --> 1:53:22.740]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[1:53:22.740 --> 1:53:27.340]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[1:53:27.340 --> 1:53:31.700]  Phase 1 is a one-world currency which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[1:53:31.700 --> 1:53:35.660]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.

[1:54:01.620 --> 1:54:07.220]  Please, the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:54:07.220 --> 1:54:20.260]  All right, we are back live and ladies and gentlemen, breaking down the financial news,
[1:54:20.260 --> 1:54:25.020]  world news, Obama's cruel host claiming shutting down Guantanamo, yeah, they're just moving
[1:54:25.020 --> 1:54:26.180]  them somewhere else.
[1:54:26.180 --> 1:54:32.940]  We had KRS-1 on with us, just an amazing interview there.
[1:54:32.940 --> 1:54:36.940]  Right now, we've got him for another 10 minutes and I apologize, we got him on late, Andrew
[1:54:36.940 --> 1:54:41.580]  Orlowski and he's a writer for the Register and a lot of other big publications over in
[1:54:41.580 --> 1:54:44.060]  England and around Europe.
[1:54:44.060 --> 1:54:48.140]  You can just Google his name and find out more about his writing.
[1:54:48.140 --> 1:54:53.820]  Okay, I mean, break down what's happening, what's really behind this and then let's expand
[1:54:53.820 --> 1:54:56.340]  into your criticism of the climate change crowd.
[1:54:56.340 --> 1:54:57.340]  Go ahead.
[1:54:57.340 --> 1:55:03.460]  Yeah, I think this is, to be honest, I'd love to hear what your listeners make of this attempt
[1:55:03.460 --> 1:55:08.660]  to kind of be ventriloquists in the law courts on behalf of animals.
[1:55:08.660 --> 1:55:11.500]  I find it a little creepy in a couple of respects.
[1:55:11.500 --> 1:55:17.180]  As I said, it kind of diminishes the idea of what humans are once you start idealizing
[1:55:17.180 --> 1:55:23.740]  animals and I went over to the pesticide this week and they've got a campaign to make
[1:55:23.740 --> 1:55:31.500]  it, we'll get everybody to cool fish, sea kittens, now I just find that's pretty bizarre.
[1:55:31.500 --> 1:55:35.620]  It's re-education, it's mind control, but not because they want to feed animals better
[1:55:35.620 --> 1:55:41.180]  and you break this down, it's so the bureaucracy can outvote the people, explain that.
[1:55:41.180 --> 1:55:47.140]  Well, I think with guys like Cass Sunstein, I don't think they're bad people, but the
[1:55:47.140 --> 1:55:52.460]  only way they think is they naturally think of regulations as a way of prohibiting people
[1:55:52.460 --> 1:55:57.900]  from doing something they don't like and I lived in the States for a few years.
[1:55:57.900 --> 1:56:03.460]  Coming back to Britain, you have a party in power which has kind of given up on politics,
[1:56:03.460 --> 1:56:05.460]  it doesn't know what it's doing, so it regulates.
[1:56:05.460 --> 1:56:10.500]  We have a weird peculiar problem, two thirds of the legislation, the regulations that are
[1:56:10.500 --> 1:56:13.820]  passed in Britain are never put before parliament.
[1:56:13.820 --> 1:56:19.420]  Some bureaucrats stuff them out somewhere, they're called control orders, ministerial
[1:56:19.420 --> 1:56:20.420]  orders.
[1:56:20.420 --> 1:56:22.780]  People don't discover them for years.
[1:56:22.780 --> 1:56:29.220]  Well, you remember the case in New York about 12 years ago where the rat was eating the
[1:56:29.220 --> 1:56:32.180]  guys tomatoes so he beat it to death and they arrested him?
[1:56:32.180 --> 1:56:41.220]  Well, I mean this is just, you know, law enforcement and bureaucrats something to do, I think.
[1:56:41.220 --> 1:56:42.220]  It's crazy.
[1:56:42.220 --> 1:56:46.940]  But I mean this shows us where Obama's coming from though, that this is the guy who's going
[1:56:46.940 --> 1:56:47.940]  to put in charge of regulations.
[1:56:47.940 --> 1:56:54.620]  Well, I don't know, Obama seems like, you know, your previous distinguished guest care
[1:56:54.620 --> 1:57:00.420]  officer once said, Obama's a pretty smart guy, I think with issues like this, and maybe
[1:57:00.420 --> 1:57:04.740]  even with climate change, he knows these are stinking policies, everybody's going to hate.
[1:57:04.740 --> 1:57:09.220]  I think he's going to keep a real big distance from it.
[1:57:09.220 --> 1:57:15.140]  But the point is, is that this is the mindset of the people that he's bringing in.
[1:57:15.140 --> 1:57:22.900]  Yeah, they're, how do you say, they're legalistic, they kind of, they're the guys who would argue
[1:57:22.900 --> 1:57:28.020]  how many angels will be on a pin, that they won't know what a pin's for, you know, they're
[1:57:28.020 --> 1:57:32.860]  really kind of, it's, you know, it's like a different cast of people.
[1:57:32.860 --> 1:57:36.900]  And I come across this all the time, I think this is a curse of being a constitutional
[1:57:36.900 --> 1:57:43.300]  lawyer, I guess you spend 20 or 30 years in academia debating really abstract things,
[1:57:43.300 --> 1:57:48.620]  and the law just becomes an instrument of achieving political success.
[1:57:48.620 --> 1:57:49.620]  It becomes a shortcut.
[1:57:49.620 --> 1:57:52.100]  Now, to me, that kind of diminishes the idea of democracy.
[1:57:52.100 --> 1:57:56.460]  Hey, if you've got a good idea, put it out to the people, treat people intelligently,
[1:57:56.460 --> 1:57:59.900]  and you know, use the democratic route.
[1:57:59.900 --> 1:58:05.180]  But what about the United States, where they're using the Patriot Act on thousands of non-terror
[1:58:05.180 --> 1:58:08.580]  related cases, including a woman spilling her Bloody Mary?
[1:58:08.580 --> 1:58:11.300]  Well, I missed that story, what happened there?
[1:58:11.300 --> 1:58:15.780]  She was on the airplane, the kids knocked it over, she spat at one of them on the leg,
[1:58:15.780 --> 1:58:20.420]  and then, and then it said in the LA Times, it said, not even cussing, but arguing is
[1:58:20.420 --> 1:58:22.220]  an act of terrorism.
[1:58:22.220 --> 1:58:26.260]  And so she's now been charged with terrorism under the USA Patriot Act, as it being given
[1:58:26.260 --> 1:58:27.260]  due process.
[1:58:27.260 --> 1:58:28.260]  Jesus.
[1:58:28.260 --> 1:58:33.300]  Well, that's a funny, funny little detail for you, that the Metropolitan Police have
[1:58:33.300 --> 1:58:38.300]  defined one of the functions of protecting the public from terrorism.
[1:58:38.300 --> 1:58:43.180]  Well, stay there, let's hear about it in one minute, back in one minute.
[1:58:43.180 --> 1:58:45.740]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[1:58:51.340 --> 1:58:52.940]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[1:58:52.940 --> 1:58:56.780]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[1:58:56.780 --> 1:58:57.780]  important than ever.
[1:58:57.780 --> 1:59:00.780]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[1:59:00.780 --> 1:59:03.580]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line, if you have your own bread.
[1:59:03.580 --> 1:59:07.580]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome, and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[1:59:07.580 --> 1:59:11.420]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family
[1:59:11.420 --> 1:59:13.140]  in the final equation but you.
[1:59:13.140 --> 1:59:17.500]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E.coli,

[1:59:54.260 --> 2:00:05.780]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[2:00:05.780 --> 2:00:10.620]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.620 --> 2:00:11.620]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.620 --> 2:00:13.860]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.860 --> 2:00:22.260]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.260 --> 2:00:25.540]  Andrew Orlowski is our guest.
[2:00:25.540 --> 2:00:28.900]  He writes for one of my favorite publications, The Register.
[2:00:28.900 --> 2:00:31.340]  Check it out.
[2:00:31.340 --> 2:00:39.340]  On the online, just Google The Register, you can't miss it, or whattheregister.com.co.uk.
[2:00:39.340 --> 2:00:45.060]  Okay, we've got four minutes left with you served, and folks, I'm coming back with a
[2:00:45.060 --> 2:00:49.140]  bunch of news and your phone calls for the balance of the transmission, with a lot happening,
[2:00:49.140 --> 2:00:53.140]  your chance to respond to the coronation of Lord Obama and a lot more.
[2:00:53.140 --> 2:00:56.700]  Shifting gears, it's the same thing they do when they say, the polar bears are endangered,
[2:00:56.700 --> 2:01:00.300]  they're threatened by global warming, and they say there's a consensus.
[2:01:00.300 --> 2:01:01.860]  Every scientist says it's real.
[2:01:01.860 --> 2:01:07.860]  Yeah, I mean, I take it, it's way, it's pretty crazy over here in Europe.
[2:01:07.860 --> 2:01:14.860]  If you even publish a contrary point of view, you get heaps of stuff, but poor people do
[2:01:14.860 --> 2:01:15.860]  it.
[2:01:15.860 --> 2:01:17.580]  They're trying to make that illegal, they're trying to make that illegal, but you are telling
[2:01:17.580 --> 2:01:18.580]  a story, I interrupt.
[2:01:18.580 --> 2:01:19.580]  Yeah.
[2:01:19.580 --> 2:01:21.780]  That's just an insane show, sir, so I operate, I'm sorry.
[2:01:21.780 --> 2:01:22.780]  No, no, no, that's cool.
[2:01:22.780 --> 2:01:25.300]  Going back to the police in London, I'm sorry.
[2:01:25.300 --> 2:01:30.260]  I just figured this might, I'm easy to read, as one of our guys got hold of the police
[2:01:30.260 --> 2:01:36.420]  operating manual for, it's kind of complicated, but it's part of the stop and search that's
[2:01:36.420 --> 2:01:42.460]  part of the terrorism act, and they put in a word that, this is advice for the police,
[2:01:42.460 --> 2:01:47.460]  it is important that officers take out of every opportunity to deter and disrupt terrorist
[2:01:47.460 --> 2:01:51.260]  operations, but they added the phrase, and provide public reassurance.
[2:01:51.260 --> 2:01:52.260]  All right, okay.
[2:01:52.260 --> 2:01:59.260]  Oh, listen, that happened to me in London, two guys that work for me in London, it happens
[2:01:59.260 --> 2:02:04.580]  to them, they can put these terror databases, but going back to the Helper Skelter interview
[2:02:04.580 --> 2:02:09.300]  here, going back to, that's the same thing, saying now groups or governments or individuals
[2:02:09.300 --> 2:02:15.500]  will represent animals, and that their vote will count as more than the rest of us, that's
[2:02:15.500 --> 2:02:16.660]  the same thing with the polar bears.
[2:02:16.660 --> 2:02:22.820]  They get to then take control governmentally of the entire area of the pole, claiming it's
[2:02:22.820 --> 2:02:24.940]  for the polar bears, there's nothing to do with them.
[2:02:24.940 --> 2:02:31.660]  Well, I've looked at the subject, and Alex, my position is I'm an agnostic because I look
[2:02:31.660 --> 2:02:37.700]  at all the arguments for what might be causing climate change, which changes all the time,
[2:02:37.700 --> 2:02:42.420]  and I haven't seen a really strong scientific case from anyone, so that's a good position
[2:02:42.420 --> 2:02:49.980]  to be in, I think, but what I see is the kind of relentless background of you can't do certain
[2:02:49.980 --> 2:02:56.460]  things that were all doomed, and certainly Obama's other scientific policy advisor is
[2:02:56.460 --> 2:03:02.220]  this guy who predicted catastrophes for America and the rest of the world every few years.
[2:03:02.220 --> 2:03:06.820]  I can't understand the mentality of people who realize the world is kind of okay, it
[2:03:06.820 --> 2:03:15.260]  could be better, but we are not facing an environmental catastrophe as far as I can
[2:03:15.260 --> 2:03:16.260]  see.
[2:03:16.260 --> 2:03:19.460]  If there is one, it's not one I'm going to be able to do very much about.
[2:03:19.460 --> 2:03:24.340]  Well, we do have one, it's going to be genetic engineering or nuclear weapons, it's certainly
[2:03:24.340 --> 2:03:30.460]  not the climate change, we have seasons, we have ice ages, we have hiberian maxims, it
[2:03:30.460 --> 2:03:31.460]  goes up and down.
[2:03:31.460 --> 2:03:35.940]  Yeah, but I think there's a subtle kind of background to all this, is that it makes
[2:03:35.940 --> 2:03:38.540]  us feel bad about almost everything we do.
[2:03:38.540 --> 2:03:43.420]  Yeah, it's going to make us feel like we're bad, humans are evil, sorry, go ahead, you're
[2:03:43.420 --> 2:03:44.420]  right.
[2:03:44.420 --> 2:03:47.620]  Yeah, I mean it makes us think that resources are limited, and to me that's a crazy idea,
[2:03:47.620 --> 2:03:52.580]  but if you look around you almost every resource we have has been created, we're going to be
[2:03:52.580 --> 2:03:57.020]  okay as long as we keep inventing stuff and making sure we can all get hold of it.
[2:03:57.020 --> 2:04:01.700]  Uranium was no good to a caveman, so that's a great example.
[2:04:01.700 --> 2:04:06.460]  Absolutely, well do you have a private website or some place people can see all your writings
[2:04:06.460 --> 2:04:07.460]  other than theregister.com?
[2:04:07.460 --> 2:04:13.500]  Yeah, they can go to Andrew Wallofsky.com and then they'll find a heap of stuff, it's
[2:04:13.500 --> 2:04:17.500]  a blog format and a welcome email and comment.
[2:04:17.500 --> 2:04:23.940]  Well I've seen your writing for years, and then I want to have you back for an official
[2:04:23.940 --> 2:04:29.940]  maiden voyage for a full hour where you actually have a check, because you're wet in the different
[2:04:29.940 --> 2:04:36.140]  angles you cover things, I mean I agree with about 95% of what you say and do, the other
[2:04:36.140 --> 2:04:40.980]  5%, I mean you're just a really interesting fellow and we put your website up on screen,
[2:04:40.980 --> 2:04:45.900]  put it back up on screen, you bet, and we'll talk to you in the near future, I know you're
[2:04:45.900 --> 2:04:49.380]  going to be busy coming up the next few months, but after that, I promise you'll come back
[2:04:49.380 --> 2:04:50.380]  on.
[2:04:50.380 --> 2:04:53.060]  I'd love to be back, thanks Alex and I look forward to seeing you.
[2:04:53.060 --> 2:04:57.140]  Hey thank you, take care, okay ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back after this
[2:04:57.140 --> 2:05:02.100]  quick break and get into the economy, the news, and a lot more, stay with us.
[2:05:02.100 --> 2:05:06.340]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:05:06.340 --> 2:05:11.180]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:05:11.180 --> 2:05:16.860]  It's known as the Bilderberg, but their objective being world domination.
[2:05:16.860 --> 2:05:22.260]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the New World
[2:05:22.260 --> 2:05:30.380]  Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:05:30.380 --> 2:05:35.420]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:05:35.420 --> 2:05:39.700]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:05:39.700 --> 2:05:42.380]  The Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[2:05:42.380 --> 2:05:45.500]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[2:05:45.500 --> 2:05:47.700]  they're after power, that's their after vision.
[2:05:47.700 --> 2:05:54.140]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com, or watch it online right now
[2:05:54.140 --> 2:06:00.900]  at prisonplanet.tv, in-game, blueprint for global enslaved, you have been warned.
[2:06:00.900 --> 2:06:04.700]  I am so frustrated, I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[2:06:04.700 --> 2:06:05.700]  What?
[2:06:05.700 --> 2:06:09.660]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible, I read something and forget, I forget
[2:06:09.660 --> 2:06:13.700]  people's names, I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people but
[2:06:13.700 --> 2:06:14.700]  I forget, I-
[2:06:14.700 --> 2:06:19.740]  Okay, slow down, poor attention and memory loss is not your fault, factors like fluoride
[2:06:19.740 --> 2:06:25.260]  in the water, aluminum and deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system
[2:06:25.260 --> 2:06:29.340]  taught you, it's all meant to dumb you down, you know I can remember everything now, even
[2:06:29.340 --> 2:06:30.340]  entire books.
[2:06:30.340 --> 2:06:31.340]  What?
[2:06:31.340 --> 2:06:32.340]  How?
[2:06:32.340 --> 2:06:36.540]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory, their online course is a real breakthrough
[2:06:36.540 --> 2:06:38.260]  in the field of memory improvement.
[2:06:38.260 --> 2:06:42.860]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of
[2:06:42.860 --> 2:06:48.860]  information including entire books after they complete just 60 lessons and they offer a
[2:06:48.860 --> 2:06:53.100]  no questions asked, no time limit, money back guarantee.
[2:06:53.100 --> 2:06:54.700]  Wow, what's the website?
[2:06:54.700 --> 2:07:03.900]  Now, don't forget, it's pmemory.net, the letter pmemory.net.
[2:07:03.900 --> 2:07:07.820]  Before last night, we already knew the Bush administration had spied on some US journalists
[2:07:07.820 --> 2:07:09.460]  inside the US.
[2:07:09.460 --> 2:07:13.160]  Last night on this newscast, we revealed the new allegation that Mr. Bush's national security
[2:07:13.160 --> 2:07:18.700]  agency was systematically 24 hours a day monitoring not just individual reporters but
[2:07:18.700 --> 2:07:23.220]  entire US news organizations as well as other organizations, the identities of which we
[2:07:23.220 --> 2:07:24.220]  still don't know.
[2:07:24.220 --> 2:07:28.340]  Tonight in our third story, Russell Tice, the NSA whistleblower who revealed that breathtaking
[2:07:28.340 --> 2:07:33.100]  claim on this program last night returns and he is breaking more news for some context.
[2:07:33.100 --> 2:07:36.780]  In the New Yorker magazine last year, reporter Lawrence Wright revealed that the FBI had
[2:07:36.780 --> 2:07:41.300]  asked him about phone calls he made to a British lawyer who was representing former
[2:07:41.300 --> 2:07:46.420]  jihadists calls the FBI thought that were made by Wright's college age daughter.
[2:07:46.420 --> 2:07:48.300]  More than wiretapping, was at work here.
[2:07:48.300 --> 2:07:51.200]  The name of Wright's daughter was not in the phone records.
[2:07:51.200 --> 2:07:55.500]  So how the hell Wright demanded, did the FBI know his daughter's name?
[2:07:55.500 --> 2:07:59.740]  In 2007, Wright asked Mike McConnell, then director of national intelligence, his reply,
[2:07:59.740 --> 2:08:00.740]  I don't know.
[2:08:00.740 --> 2:08:04.740]  When Wright found it troubling that his daughter's name was on some NSA list somewhere, McConnell
[2:08:04.740 --> 2:08:09.220]  said quote, it may be troublesome, it may not be, you don't know.
[2:08:09.220 --> 2:08:12.020]  As Mr. Tice is about to clarify, now we know.
[2:08:12.020 --> 2:08:15.140]  But first, yesterday we asked the NSA to comment on his allegations.
[2:08:15.140 --> 2:08:20.100]  The agency declined saying only quote, NSA considers the constitutional rights of US
[2:08:20.100 --> 2:08:21.860]  citizens to be sacrosanct.
[2:08:21.860 --> 2:08:25.220]  The intelligence community faces immense challenges in protecting our nation.
[2:08:25.220 --> 2:08:29.580]  No matter the challenges, NSA remains dedicated to performing its mission under the rule of
[2:08:29.580 --> 2:08:30.580]  law.
[2:08:30.580 --> 2:08:35.180]  Not from a Bush holdover at NSA, no reply yet, from the Obama White House.
[2:08:35.180 --> 2:08:39.700]  Returning to our program tonight, Russell Tice, former NSA analyst, now a very public
[2:08:39.700 --> 2:08:40.700]  whistleblower.
[2:08:40.700 --> 2:08:42.340]  Thank you again for your time tonight, sir.
[2:08:42.340 --> 2:08:43.340]  Good evening.
[2:08:43.340 --> 2:08:44.340]  Thank you.
[2:08:44.340 --> 2:08:45.340]  Thank you.
[2:08:45.340 --> 2:08:49.580]  Last night, we discussed collection of phone and email data, envelope info, like the length
[2:08:49.580 --> 2:08:51.740]  of the call, but also the content.
[2:08:51.740 --> 2:08:55.700]  But the information they collected on journalists and other people, this was more than just
[2:08:55.700 --> 2:08:57.180]  phone and email info?
[2:08:57.180 --> 2:09:03.420]  Well, as far as the information, the wiretap information that made it to NSA, there was
[2:09:03.420 --> 2:09:06.020]  also data mining that was involved.
[2:09:06.020 --> 2:09:11.620]  And at some point, information from credit card records and financial transactions was
[2:09:11.620 --> 2:09:13.820]  married in with that information.
[2:09:13.820 --> 2:09:21.140]  So the lucky US citizens, tens of thousands of whom that are now on digital databases
[2:09:21.140 --> 2:09:27.540]  at NSA who have no idea of this, also have that sort of information included on those
[2:09:27.540 --> 2:09:32.060]  digital files that have been warehouse.
[2:09:32.060 --> 2:09:35.700]  Throwing that kind of information in there too, your credit card records, where you have
[2:09:35.700 --> 2:09:42.180]  spent your money, does that make it clear to you who used this information or why it
[2:09:42.180 --> 2:09:44.380]  was used or what the goal was of gaining it?
[2:09:44.380 --> 2:09:49.220]  Do you have any better idea of what all this stuff was used for?
[2:09:49.220 --> 2:09:57.460]  Well, the obvious explanation would be that if you did have a potential terrorist, you'd
[2:09:57.460 --> 2:10:01.700]  want to know whether they're spending money and whether they purchased an airline ticket
[2:10:01.700 --> 2:10:05.940]  or something like that and that sort of thing.
[2:10:05.940 --> 2:10:10.460]  But once again, we're talking about tens of thousands of innocent US citizens that have
[2:10:10.460 --> 2:10:16.460]  been caught up in this trap that they have no clue.
[2:10:16.460 --> 2:10:20.420]  This thing could sit there for 10 years and then potentially it marries up with something
[2:10:20.420 --> 2:10:21.860]  else in 10 years from now.
[2:10:21.860 --> 2:10:26.860]  They get put on a no fly list and of course won't have a clue why.
[2:10:26.860 --> 2:10:31.140]  All these tens of thousands of people that you refer to, do they at least have possible
[2:10:31.140 --> 2:10:35.020]  ties to terrorists like the story of this New Yorker magazine reporter where there was
[2:10:35.020 --> 2:10:39.580]  a phone call made at least a starting point or do they not even have that?
[2:10:39.580 --> 2:10:43.220]  In most cases, they don't have that at all.
[2:10:43.220 --> 2:10:49.460]  This is garnered from algorithms that have been put together to try to just dream up
[2:10:49.460 --> 2:10:56.500]  scenarios that might be information that is associated with how a terrorist could operate.
[2:10:56.500 --> 2:11:01.940]  Like I mentioned last night, the one to two minute pizza delivery call and things of that
[2:11:01.940 --> 2:11:07.820]  nature of which an innocent citizen could be easily tied into these things.
[2:11:07.820 --> 2:11:12.100]  Once that information gets to NSA and they start to put it through the filters there
[2:11:12.100 --> 2:11:19.700]  where they have language interpreters and stuff and they start looking for word recognition.
[2:11:19.700 --> 2:11:26.420]  If someone just talked about the daily news and mentioned something about the Middle East,
[2:11:26.420 --> 2:11:32.260]  they could easily be brought to the forefront of having that little flag put by their name
[2:11:32.260 --> 2:11:37.980]  that says potential terrorist and of course this US citizen wouldn't have a clue.
[2:11:37.980 --> 2:11:42.820]  This massive thing obviously did not grow of its own accord.
[2:11:42.820 --> 2:11:48.700]  Do you know or do you have an educated guess as to who authorized this and who developed
[2:11:48.700 --> 2:11:51.380]  this?
[2:11:51.380 --> 2:11:55.460]  I have a guess where it was developed.
[2:11:55.460 --> 2:12:00.420]  I think it was probably developed out of the Department of Defense and this is probably
[2:12:00.420 --> 2:12:05.060]  the remnants of the total information awareness that came out of DARPA.
[2:12:05.060 --> 2:12:06.060]  That's my guess.
[2:12:06.060 --> 2:12:07.820]  I don't know that for sure.
[2:12:07.820 --> 2:12:13.580]  The previous reports of individual incidents suggest they were looking for leak sources.
[2:12:13.580 --> 2:12:18.900]  In 2006 the former NSA director Michael Hayden was asked if he targeted political opponents
[2:12:18.900 --> 2:12:22.780]  of the Bush administration and he refused to answer.
[2:12:22.780 --> 2:12:27.500]  Was he, was that one of the factors in determining which journalists they targeted?
[2:12:27.500 --> 2:12:33.420]  I don't know the answer to that but from the avenue that I know about everyone was
[2:12:33.420 --> 2:12:38.740]  elected so they sucked in everybody and at some point they may have cherry picked from
[2:12:38.740 --> 2:12:44.620]  what they had but I wasn't aware of who got cherry picked out of that big pot.
[2:12:44.620 --> 2:12:47.700]  I didn't have time to play that key part.
[2:12:47.700 --> 2:12:52.140]  It's much worse than what Oberman's saying so we played that so we could break that down.
[2:12:52.140 --> 2:12:54.540]  People need to stop living in denial about how bad the surveillance is.
[2:12:54.540 --> 2:12:59.900]  We're going to take a lot of calls now for the balance of the broadcast and get into
[2:12:59.900 --> 2:13:05.420]  Obama's deception with Guantanamo Bay saying well we're probably going to close it in the
[2:13:05.420 --> 2:13:06.620]  next year.
[2:13:06.620 --> 2:13:10.260]  The headline is he's closed it and it's well we're going to try to close it or figure
[2:13:10.260 --> 2:13:13.260]  out how to close it in the next year and what we're going to do with these people.
[2:13:13.260 --> 2:13:17.660]  Well the Pentagon already said a year ago, more than a year ago, that they were going
[2:13:17.660 --> 2:13:23.060]  to move them to other bases and create a more judicial process that isn't just openly we
[2:13:23.060 --> 2:13:27.220]  can grab you secretly, hold you secretly, execute you secretly but all that stuff is
[2:13:27.220 --> 2:13:34.580]  still on the books in the enemy commissions act, the enemy combatants, having one of those
[2:13:34.580 --> 2:13:37.500]  brain moments.
[2:13:37.500 --> 2:13:40.700]  It's the John Warner Defense Authorization Act deals with taking over the states and
[2:13:40.700 --> 2:13:46.020]  martial law, PD-51 deals with continuity of government where the Congress and the states
[2:13:46.020 --> 2:13:49.380]  have no power, will Obama repeal all of those?
[2:13:49.380 --> 2:13:51.660]  Those are a question we've got to ask.
[2:13:51.660 --> 2:13:52.780]  You're not hearing anything about that.
[2:13:52.780 --> 2:13:57.620]  It's all about how he's getting rid of Guantanamo and then it's the Military Commissions Act.
[2:13:57.620 --> 2:14:00.980]  It was calling it the Enemy Commissions Act, the Military Commissions Act that turns a
[2:14:00.980 --> 2:14:05.220]  U.S. citizen secretly, they could secretly issue this finding not from a court but from
[2:14:05.220 --> 2:14:08.900]  the president, the Defense Department of their designates and then secretly snatching grab
[2:14:08.900 --> 2:14:12.340]  you and you disappear, they could torture you and then use that evidence in their secret
[2:14:12.340 --> 2:14:13.340]  tribunals.
[2:14:13.340 --> 2:14:18.740]  If the military secret tribunals find you not guilty, higher ups can still find you
[2:14:18.740 --> 2:14:19.740]  guilty.
[2:14:19.740 --> 2:14:22.020]  I mean it's not even a kangaroo court.
[2:14:22.020 --> 2:14:25.020]  It is worse than that, so we'll go over some of that.
[2:14:25.020 --> 2:14:26.460]  I got Bob Chapman coming on.
[2:14:26.460 --> 2:14:29.740]  I don't usually have him on twice a week but I'm having him on about 10, 15 minutes later
[2:14:29.740 --> 2:14:34.900]  in the hour after we take some calls because I want to get his specific take from my analysis
[2:14:34.900 --> 2:14:39.620]  and we'll see if he concurs with it about what they're doing with the, quote, nationalization
[2:14:39.620 --> 2:14:40.620]  of the banks.
[2:14:40.620 --> 2:14:41.620]  It isn't really a nationalization.
[2:14:41.620 --> 2:14:42.620]  We'll tell you what it really is.
[2:14:42.620 --> 2:14:44.140]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[2:14:44.140 --> 2:14:45.940]  Craig in New York disagrees.
[2:14:45.940 --> 2:14:46.940]  First up, go ahead.
[2:14:46.940 --> 2:14:53.620]  Hi, Alex, thanks for letting me on, I told the guys I called up a disagree, so you really
[2:14:53.620 --> 2:14:54.860]  do believe in open dialogue.
[2:14:54.860 --> 2:15:00.300]  You really don't screen the calls, I just want to say you're honest with that and I
[2:15:00.300 --> 2:15:01.300]  respectfully disagree.
[2:15:01.300 --> 2:15:05.180]  I think you exaggerate a lot of things from the show and I think that hurts putting the
[2:15:05.180 --> 2:15:08.340]  information out there because someone finds that you exaggerated to go, oh, everything
[2:15:08.340 --> 2:15:09.340]  you say is BS.
[2:15:09.340 --> 2:15:13.100]  Okay, let me stop you at specifics of what I exaggerated about.
[2:15:13.100 --> 2:15:18.540]  Okay, for example, when you talk about norad drills on September 11th, then you say that
[2:15:18.540 --> 2:15:23.380]  it was for the same target, the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, there were different drills
[2:15:23.380 --> 2:15:29.340]  on September 11th, for example, the drills for those targets, Twin Towers, Pentagon, earlier
[2:15:29.340 --> 2:15:30.780]  drills in March.
[2:15:30.780 --> 2:15:31.780]  It's when you...
[2:15:31.780 --> 2:15:32.780]  No, no.
[2:15:32.780 --> 2:15:33.780]  Yes, sir.
[2:15:33.780 --> 2:15:39.620]  No, they ran drills two years before, six months before, two months before, the week
[2:15:39.620 --> 2:15:40.700]  before.
[2:15:40.700 --> 2:15:44.100]  And so this is cherry picking and if I had the time, we could go through this, but anybody
[2:15:44.100 --> 2:15:46.260]  who wants to research it can look at it.
[2:15:46.260 --> 2:15:53.940]  Much of the drills on 9-11 are still classified, but the CIA was specifically running a separate
[2:15:53.940 --> 2:15:59.540]  drill on the morning of 9-11 and the news articles, and it's in some of my films, said
[2:15:59.540 --> 2:16:02.220]  that it was off the previous drills that were those targets.
[2:16:02.220 --> 2:16:03.220]  I mean, are you saying...
[2:16:03.220 --> 2:16:04.820]  Well, I mean, hey, what are you saying?
[2:16:04.820 --> 2:16:06.700]  Are you saying they weren't running drills that morning?
[2:16:06.700 --> 2:16:07.700]  No, no, no.
[2:16:07.700 --> 2:16:12.140]  Well, not at all, Alex, and it's... it was in front of USA today that they were.
[2:16:12.140 --> 2:16:16.380]  Just to make clear with you, I've shown videos of yours, different classrooms, but I'm not
[2:16:16.380 --> 2:16:17.380]  exaggerating.
[2:16:17.380 --> 2:16:18.380]  I mean, I'm...
[2:16:18.380 --> 2:16:19.380]  Wait, one example.
[2:16:19.380 --> 2:16:20.380]  Can I get one example?
[2:16:20.380 --> 2:16:21.380]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:16:21.380 --> 2:16:27.500]  Okay, for example, as a joke, I called up with a Baba Buwi phone call and you are seeing
[2:16:27.500 --> 2:16:31.420]  on YouTube claiming that the Howard Stern Show called you and that they showed off about
[2:16:31.420 --> 2:16:32.420]  it.
[2:16:32.420 --> 2:16:33.420]  That never occurred.
[2:16:33.420 --> 2:16:34.420]  That was me who was calling.
[2:16:34.420 --> 2:16:39.900]  Put him on hold, total and complete disinformation, pal.
[2:16:39.900 --> 2:16:44.260]  Total and disinformation, what you just did.
[2:16:44.260 --> 2:16:47.500]  Somebody called up and it was a couple of years ago, I think, and it does sound just
[2:16:47.500 --> 2:16:48.500]  like you from memory.
[2:16:48.500 --> 2:16:53.660]  My memory serves, or it was somebody with the exact same type, Brooklyn or Queens or whatever
[2:16:53.660 --> 2:16:59.740]  your accent is, so it sounds like you, and they did a Baba Buwi, and I said, well, going
[2:16:59.740 --> 2:17:02.580]  from memory, and I know the YouTube's out there, so you can go look it up, I'm not
[2:17:02.580 --> 2:17:07.500]  on me present, but I said, yeah, that might have been Baba Buwi because the Howard Stern
[2:17:07.500 --> 2:17:11.060]  Show doesn't like me.
[2:17:11.060 --> 2:17:12.060]  And that's what I said.
[2:17:12.060 --> 2:17:14.620]  I did not say I was sure that was you and that was happening.
[2:17:14.620 --> 2:17:23.660]  Now, you just integrated that in with me somehow saying that it was the Howard Stern Show.
[2:17:23.660 --> 2:17:31.660]  What I talked about when that happened was the fact that I was called four times by producers
[2:17:31.660 --> 2:17:39.700]  at the Howard Stern Show, some guy with electric eel, another group saying, we'd like to have
[2:17:39.700 --> 2:17:46.060]  you on the Howard Stern Show, this is about five years ago, but the other producers and
[2:17:46.060 --> 2:17:53.020]  Howard are concerned that you would plug ManCal, and that you're like a minion of ManCal,
[2:17:53.020 --> 2:17:58.220]  and those two were rivals, you know, ManCal is junior, and I said, I do thousands of
[2:17:58.220 --> 2:18:04.260]  interviews, I wouldn't come on and plug ManCal because they said, well, ManCal tries people
[2:18:04.260 --> 2:18:05.260]  to do that.
[2:18:05.260 --> 2:18:08.460]  I said, I'm not involved with that, ManCal has me on half the time and disagrees with
[2:18:08.460 --> 2:18:09.460]  me.
[2:18:09.460 --> 2:18:12.620]  We've had screaming arguments on there, and they said, okay, we'll call you back, and
[2:18:12.620 --> 2:18:15.460]  then they call back six months later, and it was the same thing.
[2:18:15.460 --> 2:18:20.340]  So that is the discussion with me saying the Howard Stern Show somehow doesn't like me.
[2:18:20.340 --> 2:18:25.580]  Okay, so you're integrating two separate things into a strawman there.
[2:18:25.580 --> 2:18:26.580]  That's what you just did.
[2:18:26.580 --> 2:18:27.580]  Go ahead.
[2:18:27.580 --> 2:18:32.740]  I'm not trying to be that convoluted, and Brad, like you do sometimes get carried away,
[2:18:32.740 --> 2:18:33.740]  you might have misspoken.
[2:18:33.740 --> 2:18:38.900]  But for example, even let's say, Stephenie Jones' research, if you look at the way he
[2:18:38.900 --> 2:18:44.780]  procured the materials in which he tried to find their thermite in the World Trade Center,
[2:18:44.780 --> 2:18:48.740]  they've been peer reviewed in prestigious peer-reviewed journals, and I bet you're
[2:18:48.740 --> 2:18:49.740]  going to say that's a lie too.
[2:18:49.740 --> 2:18:53.220]  Social, political, economic journals, nothing to do with science.
[2:18:53.220 --> 2:18:55.700]  No, some of them have been reviewed.
[2:18:55.700 --> 2:19:00.220]  You know what, I appreciate your call, I'm not going to spend my time on Howard Stern,
[2:19:00.220 --> 2:19:01.220]  buddy.
[2:19:01.220 --> 2:19:02.220]  I guess everything's fine.
[2:19:02.220 --> 2:19:06.020]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced
[2:19:06.020 --> 2:19:07.380]  alkaline environment.
[2:19:07.380 --> 2:19:12.740]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[2:19:12.740 --> 2:19:17.140]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention
[2:19:17.140 --> 2:19:18.340]  of disease.
[2:19:18.340 --> 2:19:22.940]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and
[2:19:22.940 --> 2:19:24.020]  loss of weight.
[2:19:24.020 --> 2:19:28.660]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most
[2:19:28.660 --> 2:19:30.260]  people are overly acidic.
[2:19:30.260 --> 2:19:34.180]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[2:19:34.180 --> 2:19:38.500]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[2:19:38.500 --> 2:19:39.500]  it.
[2:19:39.500 --> 2:19:40.500]  Do your part.
[2:19:40.500 --> 2:19:43.020]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[2:19:43.020 --> 2:19:47.660]  Alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH
[2:19:47.660 --> 2:19:51.820]  of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[2:19:51.820 --> 2:19:58.140]  Water your bottle of Alcovision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[2:19:58.140 --> 2:20:01.140]  Again, that's alcovision.com.
[2:20:01.140 --> 2:20:06.260]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:20:06.260 --> 2:20:07.780]  against this country.
[2:20:07.780 --> 2:20:09.980]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:20:09.980 --> 2:20:11.980]  But who is the enemy?
[2:20:11.980 --> 2:20:12.980]  Bin Laden.
[2:20:12.980 --> 2:20:13.980]  This is his MO.
[2:20:13.980 --> 2:20:14.980]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:20:14.980 --> 2:20:16.980]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:20:16.980 --> 2:20:21.780]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:20:21.780 --> 2:20:24.340]  networks inside the United States.
[2:20:24.340 --> 2:20:28.820]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:20:28.820 --> 2:20:30.980]  in and on the U.S.
[2:20:30.980 --> 2:20:34.660]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:20:34.660 --> 2:20:40.140]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:20:40.140 --> 2:20:44.300]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much,
[2:20:44.300 --> 2:20:45.300]  much more.
[2:20:45.300 --> 2:20:46.300]  Fabled Enemies.
[2:20:46.300 --> 2:20:51.180]  Look at the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds
[2:20:51.180 --> 2:20:53.980]  of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:20:53.980 --> 2:21:01.340]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:21:01.340 --> 2:21:04.500]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial
[2:21:04.500 --> 2:21:05.500]  affairs?
[2:21:05.500 --> 2:21:09.740]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation
[2:21:09.740 --> 2:21:11.260]  of stocks and bonds.
[2:21:11.260 --> 2:21:15.260]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty
[2:21:15.260 --> 2:21:16.900]  and the pursuit of happiness.
[2:21:16.900 --> 2:21:22.900]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984,
[2:21:22.900 --> 2:21:27.500]  and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some
[2:21:27.500 --> 2:21:30.900]  precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[2:21:30.900 --> 2:21:34.900]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading
[2:21:34.900 --> 2:21:36.580]  precious metals privately.
[2:21:36.580 --> 2:21:40.300]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed
[2:21:40.300 --> 2:21:43.220]  my representatives to give this report out free.
[2:21:43.220 --> 2:21:47.140]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[2:21:47.140 --> 2:21:49.500]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[2:21:49.500 --> 2:21:53.180]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[2:21:53.180 --> 2:21:56.340]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[2:21:56.340 --> 2:22:01.180]  1-800-686-2237.
[2:22:01.180 --> 2:22:02.980]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[2:22:02.980 --> 2:22:07.620]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[2:22:07.620 --> 2:22:08.620]  by you.
[2:22:08.620 --> 2:22:09.900]  But the symptoms are there.
[2:22:09.900 --> 2:22:14.940]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[2:22:14.940 --> 2:22:18.500]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:22:18.500 --> 2:22:23.020]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[2:22:23.020 --> 2:22:24.020]  across America.
[2:22:24.020 --> 2:22:28.020]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[2:22:28.020 --> 2:22:31.660]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[2:22:31.660 --> 2:22:32.660]  healthier I feel.
[2:22:32.660 --> 2:22:35.340]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:22:35.340 --> 2:22:40.580]  Only over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[2:22:40.580 --> 2:22:43.100]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[2:22:43.100 --> 2:22:54.180]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305 or order online hbextract.com.
[2:22:54.180 --> 2:23:20.180]  Heart and Body Extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[2:23:20.180 --> 2:23:24.820]  By the way, Stephen Jones has gotten samples now from last time I checked seven or eight
[2:23:24.820 --> 2:23:29.980]  different places including government stores and people on record who have property right
[2:23:29.980 --> 2:23:36.180]  next to it and his finding of the spheres was also found by NIST in their sulfidation
[2:23:36.180 --> 2:23:37.180]  reports.
[2:23:37.180 --> 2:23:40.180]  We have the police and firemen saying get back, they're going to bring the building
[2:23:40.180 --> 2:23:43.660]  down and we have it blowing up with the CIA being in there.
[2:23:43.660 --> 2:23:44.820]  I mean, nice try guy.
[2:23:44.820 --> 2:23:51.700]  You're somebody who calls shows and does pranks and hey, I told you the economy was going
[2:23:51.700 --> 2:23:55.780]  to blow up years ago, told you to start with subprime mortgages, told you the bankers would
[2:23:55.780 --> 2:23:59.460]  take over and announce a world government run by the banks, you'd pay carbon taxes
[2:23:59.460 --> 2:24:02.900]  too, told you they'd announce youth brigades, it's all happening.
[2:24:02.900 --> 2:24:04.660]  We don't exaggerate anything here.
[2:24:04.660 --> 2:24:08.380]  It's far worse than we're saying.
[2:24:08.380 --> 2:24:15.460]  So I don't know, I just feel sorry for you, Bubba, because a lot of you Kool-Aid drinkers
[2:24:15.460 --> 2:24:19.540]  are so invested in the false reality that you're going to have a lot of problems in
[2:24:19.540 --> 2:24:20.540]  life.
[2:24:20.540 --> 2:24:22.980]  David Louisiana, you're on the air, welcome.
[2:24:22.980 --> 2:24:23.980]  Alex.
[2:24:23.980 --> 2:24:24.980]  Hi.
[2:24:24.980 --> 2:24:25.980]  How are you doing?
[2:24:25.980 --> 2:24:26.980]  Good.
[2:24:26.980 --> 2:24:27.980]  Go ahead.
[2:24:27.980 --> 2:24:34.060]  I'm looking at the February 2000, not in Playboy and it has an article named Peep Culture
[2:24:34.060 --> 2:24:39.060]  by Hal and it's Becky and the sub caption is seven things you should know about our
[2:24:39.060 --> 2:24:42.420]  New World Order.
[2:24:42.420 --> 2:24:43.420]  But it doesn't exist.
[2:24:43.420 --> 2:24:44.420]  You're exaggerating.
[2:24:44.420 --> 2:24:45.420]  That's right.
[2:24:45.420 --> 2:24:46.420]  It doesn't exist.
[2:24:46.420 --> 2:24:49.900]  Henry Kissinger goes on and says Obama will be able to get the world to go along with
[2:24:49.900 --> 2:24:53.500]  the New World Order and he writes books calling on New World Order World Government and Walter
[2:24:53.500 --> 2:24:57.300]  Cronkite gets up and says we want world government and Hillary Clinton says it and they say a
[2:24:57.300 --> 2:25:00.660]  New World Order is a world government and we get the North American Union documents and
[2:25:00.660 --> 2:25:02.500]  they still say it doesn't exist.
[2:25:02.500 --> 2:25:05.580]  That's right, everything is fine, you know.
[2:25:05.580 --> 2:25:10.020]  But basically the article gets into how our culture is changing and modifying to the internet
[2:25:10.020 --> 2:25:16.620]  to be more, to basically accept surveillance and how you can profit off of it and become
[2:25:16.620 --> 2:25:20.940]  entertained by it, so basically acclimating us to constant surveillance.
[2:25:20.940 --> 2:25:22.700]  Yes, that's what's happening.
[2:25:22.700 --> 2:25:26.620]  Well, Alex, hey man, I appreciate your show and you have a great show, you have great
[2:25:26.620 --> 2:25:30.860]  soundtracks on your bumper music and Bob Chapman is the man.
[2:25:30.860 --> 2:25:34.540]  All right, my friends, so are you, good to hear from you.
[2:25:34.540 --> 2:25:39.500]  Let's go ahead and get in as many calls here as we can and let's go ahead and talk to Stan
[2:25:39.500 --> 2:25:40.500]  in Missouri.
[2:25:40.500 --> 2:25:41.500]  Stan, you're on the air.
[2:25:41.500 --> 2:25:42.500]  Is this Farmer Stan?
[2:25:42.500 --> 2:25:47.140]  Well, I've got to say, I don't disagree with you on anything, but you do.
[2:25:47.140 --> 2:25:49.780]  You've been talking about all this compulsory service.
[2:25:49.780 --> 2:25:53.420]  I want to know how in the world are they going to plan to enforce this?
[2:25:53.420 --> 2:25:54.900]  Are they going to stick a gun to our head?
[2:25:54.900 --> 2:25:56.380]  Are they going to seize our bank assets?
[2:25:56.380 --> 2:25:58.860]  Are they going to take our social security away from us?
[2:25:58.860 --> 2:26:02.020]  Now, how in the world are they planning to enforce all of this?
[2:26:02.020 --> 2:26:03.020]  Notice what they're saying.
[2:26:03.020 --> 2:26:07.140]  The economy's imploding, it's our fault as the American people in a speech.
[2:26:07.140 --> 2:26:12.780]  We've got to serve, we've got to sacrifice, it's America, we've got to do it.
[2:26:12.780 --> 2:26:16.740]  And then as things get worse, the media's going to blame those of us that don't go slave
[2:26:16.740 --> 2:26:19.100]  for the government for free, that it's our fault.
[2:26:19.100 --> 2:26:23.900]  Now, the rest are going to volunteer and then get a stipend check.
[2:26:23.900 --> 2:26:28.180]  That's going to be in his separate from government volunteer corps and then they'll stage some
[2:26:28.180 --> 2:26:33.380]  more terror attacks and things or launch some more wars and say 18 to 24 and then they're
[2:26:33.380 --> 2:26:37.820]  going to offer you a government check for college and they're saying this, but you'll
[2:26:37.820 --> 2:26:44.020]  have to serve and they're going to say, don't worry, you don't have to serve overseas, you're
[2:26:44.020 --> 2:26:45.740]  going to be part of the new domestic army.
[2:26:45.740 --> 2:26:47.340]  This is all proposed.
[2:26:47.340 --> 2:26:48.940]  And so that's how they're going to do it.
[2:26:48.940 --> 2:26:51.620]  I mean, how do they do the draft back in the 60s and 70s?
[2:26:51.620 --> 2:26:52.620]  How do they do it?
[2:26:52.620 --> 2:26:54.060]  I mean, they just say, our country's under attack.
[2:26:54.060 --> 2:26:55.060]  We have to do this.
[2:26:55.060 --> 2:26:57.700]  And then they demonize cowardly draft dodgers.
[2:26:57.700 --> 2:27:02.340]  Until now, you'll be a service dodger and, but you're going to be able to opt out.
[2:27:02.340 --> 2:27:07.020]  They claim to be able to serve domestically and healthy, young 18, 24 year olds.
[2:27:07.020 --> 2:27:11.780]  They're going to love wearing an Obama uniform, literally, and stomping around and, you know,
[2:27:11.780 --> 2:27:16.300]  at first it's feeding soup kitchens, digging ditches, cleaning up parks, but then they're
[2:27:16.300 --> 2:27:20.100]  going to convert it over, which they say they're going to do in a spying on neighbors running
[2:27:20.100 --> 2:27:22.180]  checkpoints and things like that.
[2:27:22.180 --> 2:27:23.580]  So see, first they're going to launch it.
[2:27:23.580 --> 2:27:24.580]  We're helping the old.
[2:27:24.580 --> 2:27:25.580]  We're helping everybody.
[2:27:25.580 --> 2:27:26.580]  We love you.
[2:27:26.580 --> 2:27:27.580]  We love you.
[2:27:27.580 --> 2:27:28.580]  And then everybody gets behind it.
[2:27:28.580 --> 2:27:29.580]  Oh yeah.
[2:27:29.580 --> 2:27:33.060]  Then how dare you be against soup kitchens and spying on your neighbors?
[2:27:33.060 --> 2:27:36.940]  I mean, how are they going to get the people, just like when you got an air conditioning
[2:27:36.940 --> 2:27:40.020]  guy at your house and you're a homeschooler and you're homeschooling and they say, your
[2:27:40.020 --> 2:27:41.020]  kids should be in school.
[2:27:41.020 --> 2:27:42.220]  I'm calling the cops on you.
[2:27:42.220 --> 2:27:43.220]  There's no law.
[2:27:43.220 --> 2:27:45.660]  You've got a homeschool, but the public believes it.
[2:27:45.660 --> 2:27:46.660]  There's no law.
[2:27:46.660 --> 2:27:49.700]  You've got to take vaccines, but the news lies and says it.
[2:27:49.700 --> 2:27:53.980]  I understand that, my friend, but right now we're having a complete absolute breakdown
[2:27:53.980 --> 2:27:54.980]  of society.
[2:27:54.980 --> 2:27:57.540]  This is why people are turning to crime.
[2:27:57.540 --> 2:28:00.820]  Elden Missouri, they're just absolutely going in the store up at Elden and they're taking
[2:28:00.820 --> 2:28:01.820]  what they want, Alex.
[2:28:01.820 --> 2:28:05.220]  People at your point where they just don't care, but don't say about anything anymore.
[2:28:05.220 --> 2:28:09.100]  And that's how society, and that's how you'll beg for it.
[2:28:09.100 --> 2:28:13.900]  When they design the breakdown of society, deindustrializing is making us a service economy.
[2:28:13.900 --> 2:28:20.660]  So when they blew out the dollar and hyperinflated and the society implodes, only place you can
[2:28:20.660 --> 2:28:24.060]  look is the government and then they're going to give you a hand and pull you in the boat
[2:28:24.060 --> 2:28:26.060]  and slit your throat right as you get into the boat.
[2:28:26.060 --> 2:28:27.060]  Here, I'll give you a hand.
[2:28:27.060 --> 2:28:28.060]  Take that.
[2:28:28.060 --> 2:28:29.060]  God beloved you.
[2:28:29.060 --> 2:28:30.940]  We're in the New World Order.
[2:28:30.940 --> 2:28:32.440]  We're hardcore radical.
[2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:33.540]  We're hardcore savage.
[2:28:33.540 --> 2:28:34.540]  That's why we're in control.
[2:28:34.540 --> 2:28:35.540]  We're the New World Order.
[2:28:35.540 --> 2:28:38.340]  And if you don't like it, you're racist, all hell, Obama.
[2:28:38.340 --> 2:28:39.340]  We'll be right back.
[2:28:39.340 --> 2:28:40.340]  Good to hear from you.
[2:28:40.340 --> 2:28:44.140]  Stan Patrick, Nicolette, Bob, and many others.
[2:28:44.140 --> 2:28:52.100]  Straight ahead, I am Alex Jones, Infowars.com, Cruise and Planet.tv.
[2:28:52.100 --> 2:29:02.260]  Where on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:02.260 --> 2:29:05.540]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[2:29:05.540 --> 2:29:09.220]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the
[2:29:09.220 --> 2:29:10.220]  world.
[2:29:10.220 --> 2:29:15.140]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver who
[2:29:15.140 --> 2:29:20.080]  offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates
[2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:21.660]  or saline solutions.
[2:29:21.660 --> 2:29:26.220]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized
[2:29:26.220 --> 2:29:31.140]  at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day
[2:29:31.140 --> 2:29:32.140]  antibiotics.
[2:29:32.140 --> 2:29:37.180]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper,
[2:29:37.180 --> 2:29:40.420]  with a money-bag guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[2:29:40.420 --> 2:29:44.700]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that
[2:29:44.700 --> 2:29:48.820]  would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.
[2:29:48.820 --> 2:30:00.340]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com, that's utopiasilver.com, or call 888-213-4338, 888-213-4338 and help us
[2:30:00.340 --> 2:30:01.340]  win this battle.
[2:30:01.340 --> 2:30:02.340]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[2:30:02.340 --> 2:30:03.340]  I've come with a message of information.
[2:30:03.340 --> 2:30:04.340]  9-Eleven was an inside job.
[2:30:04.340 --> 2:30:05.340]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:30:05.340 --> 2:30:06.340]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[2:30:06.340 --> 2:30:07.340]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a state?
[2:30:07.340 --> 2:30:08.340]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF, and
[2:30:08.340 --> 2:30:09.340]  the U.S.
[2:30:09.340 --> 2:30:22.340]  The data we stop asking questions is the data that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:30:22.340 --> 2:30:27.820]  to grow at our own door.
[2:30:27.820 --> 2:30:33.140]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:30:33.140 --> 2:30:36.660]  An inside job?
[2:30:36.660 --> 2:30:37.660]  How dare you?
[2:30:37.660 --> 2:30:43.980]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:30:43.980 --> 2:30:46.980]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:30:46.980 --> 2:30:51.300]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[2:30:51.300 --> 2:30:52.300]  anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[2:30:52.300 --> 2:30:53.300]  Truth Risen.

[2:30:58.580 --> 2:31:01.380]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:31:01.380 --> 2:31:04.020]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[2:31:04.020 --> 2:31:05.380]  E-Foods does it again.
[2:31:05.380 --> 2:31:09.860]  The 3-day responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix
[2:31:09.860 --> 2:31:10.860]  food.
[2:31:10.860 --> 2:31:16.340]  The price of the 3-day responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95.
[2:31:16.340 --> 2:31:19.340]  For actually 12 meals, plus snacks.
[2:31:19.340 --> 2:31:23.980]  When you taste the food in the 3-day responder, you will understand why families trust E-Foods
[2:31:23.980 --> 2:31:27.460]  Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[2:31:27.460 --> 2:31:32.100]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-day responder
[2:31:32.100 --> 2:31:34.580]  is easy to fix and ready to go.
[2:31:34.580 --> 2:31:36.300]  Food is an everyday need.
[2:31:36.300 --> 2:31:41.140]  The 3-day responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry
[2:31:41.140 --> 2:31:42.140]  about.
[2:31:42.140 --> 2:31:49.060]  The 3-day responder, $21.95, sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages.
[2:31:49.060 --> 2:32:06.580]  Call 800-409-5633 on thewebefoodsdirect.com.
[2:32:06.580 --> 2:32:11.500]  I'm just going to have Bob Chapman for the next 25 minutes and he's going to be open
[2:32:11.500 --> 2:32:27.380]  phones again in the fourth hour today.
[2:32:27.380 --> 2:32:39.260]  I want to break down with Bob Chapman of theinternationalforecaster.com.
[2:32:39.260 --> 2:32:43.940]  Not this nationalization really means.
[2:32:43.940 --> 2:32:49.460]  I'm going to give you my analysis and then see if he concurs.
[2:32:49.460 --> 2:32:56.580]  Okay, the international central banks industrialize the western world.
[2:32:56.580 --> 2:32:57.700]  They get us under their control.
[2:32:57.700 --> 2:33:01.100]  They state that's the plan so that they can get us all in debt.
[2:33:01.100 --> 2:33:03.020]  They call it a service economy.
[2:33:03.020 --> 2:33:07.780]  Then they cut off the liquidity to Main Street, killing it so they can buy it up with the
[2:33:07.780 --> 2:33:11.700]  tens of trillions of dollars of bailout money that they've sucked into their coffers in
[2:33:11.700 --> 2:33:15.220]  the last three and a half months, 8.5 trillion on record.
[2:33:15.220 --> 2:33:16.220]  That's six weeks ago.
[2:33:16.220 --> 2:33:23.300]  It was a trillion, $300 billion a week, so it's well over $10 trillion now.
[2:33:23.300 --> 2:33:27.500]  And then they say to the public, they already got dictatorial power under the bill they
[2:33:27.500 --> 2:33:31.780]  passed that stated no one can review them, no court, no government, not Congress, not
[2:33:31.780 --> 2:33:32.780]  the President.
[2:33:32.780 --> 2:33:41.220]  That gives this totally illegal, fraudulent, omnipotent, imperial power to the private
[2:33:41.220 --> 2:33:43.580]  fellow reserve governors.
[2:33:43.580 --> 2:33:47.460]  And separate Fed governors and former governors are saying, we've been told war powers have
[2:33:47.460 --> 2:33:48.460]  been enacted.
[2:33:48.460 --> 2:33:49.460]  We're not even involved.
[2:33:49.460 --> 2:33:53.300]  That's been in Bloomberg and AP.
[2:33:53.300 --> 2:33:54.700]  So they've already got the dictatorial power.
[2:33:54.700 --> 2:33:57.660]  They have to sell now what they're going to do in that power by acting like they don't
[2:33:57.660 --> 2:34:00.860]  have it and say, we have to nationalize the banks.
[2:34:00.860 --> 2:34:06.540]  But they won't tell you where it's going, what the money is, into this new bank of the
[2:34:06.540 --> 2:34:07.540]  U.S.
[2:34:07.540 --> 2:34:10.060]  That's been in the Wall Street Journal and a bunch of other publications.
[2:34:10.060 --> 2:34:11.540]  And it will issue bonds.
[2:34:11.540 --> 2:34:15.720]  But really, that's the fellow reserve that's already quietly started issuing some type
[2:34:15.720 --> 2:34:19.780]  of secretive bonds to institutions and governments that they claim are as good as U.S. Treasury
[2:34:19.780 --> 2:34:20.780]  notes.
[2:34:20.780 --> 2:34:24.060]  So they're blowing the U.S. out, blowing its credit out, the people have got to pay
[2:34:24.060 --> 2:34:29.140]  all that back in taxes and interest, and they're now creating this new instrument that is the
[2:34:29.140 --> 2:34:32.220]  new bank of the USA, which is USA in name only.
[2:34:32.220 --> 2:34:33.420]  It's also private like the fellow reserve.
[2:34:33.420 --> 2:34:34.420]  It's the same group.
[2:34:34.420 --> 2:34:39.580]  You have the private shareholders of the small group of banks that are also the fellow reserve,
[2:34:39.580 --> 2:34:41.620]  which will also be this new bank.
[2:34:41.620 --> 2:34:47.300]  And then it seeds its power to Bretton Woods, too, to internationally devalue the currencies
[2:34:47.300 --> 2:34:50.180]  together, as they've said they're going to do.
[2:34:50.180 --> 2:34:55.500]  And Newsweek has called it World Bank, World Government, offering that as a solution.
[2:34:55.500 --> 2:35:02.140]  So when they call it nationalization, it isn't really that, it's the last vestiges of Treasury
[2:35:02.140 --> 2:35:08.780]  control over financial systems being transferred to the Federal Reserve and then openly transferred
[2:35:08.780 --> 2:35:13.380]  publicly into an international body, which again is owned by the private shareholders
[2:35:13.380 --> 2:35:17.460]  of the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bundesbank, a handful of families.
[2:35:17.460 --> 2:35:19.860]  And so that's what's happening with all of this.
[2:35:19.860 --> 2:35:24.180]  So if nationalization was bad enough, the only way, the only sense it's nationalized
[2:35:24.180 --> 2:35:30.740]  is they're saying unlimited secret funds will be transferred further, not just the 8.5
[2:35:30.740 --> 2:35:35.180]  trillion, and they're looting all the other countries through, that's just here, into
[2:35:35.180 --> 2:35:40.620]  this group, into this body, which will then set currency rates, that will then set interest
[2:35:40.620 --> 2:35:45.380]  rates worldwide, that will then set tax policy worldwide, and they're calling it the New
[2:35:45.380 --> 2:35:46.980]  World Order.
[2:35:46.980 --> 2:35:50.140]  So that's basically what they're doing, and the public will think they're paying taxes
[2:35:50.140 --> 2:35:56.740]  into the new Bank of the USA to freeze up these bad derivatives, these bad instruments,
[2:35:56.740 --> 2:36:00.340]  when in reality the establishment is just writing those off to their investors and hoarding
[2:36:00.340 --> 2:36:04.900]  all the capital and cash to themselves as the world goes into depression, they continue
[2:36:04.900 --> 2:36:08.660]  the process of buying everything up and then telling governments through their INF World
[2:36:08.660 --> 2:36:13.340]  Bank Shock Therapy System that in Argentina, Russia, now in Iceland, you have to hand over
[2:36:13.340 --> 2:36:16.700]  roads, infrastructure to all these private interests, which are also owned by the very
[2:36:16.700 --> 2:36:20.460]  same central banks themselves that are setting the policies for the government to have the
[2:36:20.460 --> 2:36:26.780]  right to pay all of the people's money into the private central banks that are doing it
[2:36:26.780 --> 2:36:27.780]  themselves.
[2:36:27.780 --> 2:36:34.460]  Now, that sounds crazy, it is, we're paying them to pay taxes and then to pay interest
[2:36:34.460 --> 2:36:35.860]  on that.
[2:36:35.860 --> 2:36:39.940]  Bob Chapman, does that succinctly describe it, or can you boil it down better, or do
[2:36:39.940 --> 2:36:42.420]  you agree with that analysis?
[2:36:42.420 --> 2:36:48.380]  One of the downsides of being on with you is thinking about things that you miss, which
[2:36:48.380 --> 2:36:51.740]  in this case you haven't missed anything at all.
[2:36:51.740 --> 2:36:57.700]  And I agree with you wholeheartedly, of course there's all kinds of nuances along the way,
[2:36:57.700 --> 2:37:00.260]  but you got it nailed, absolutely.
[2:37:00.260 --> 2:37:05.220]  Now, we're going to be in the middle of a depression, I think the depression has begun,
[2:37:05.220 --> 2:37:06.220]  at least in the United States.
[2:37:06.220 --> 2:37:12.100]  But hold on Bob, put it in your own words, I mean I did that whole long extrapolated thing,
[2:37:12.100 --> 2:37:16.140]  I mean with all of your decades of research in finance and being spot on predicting what's
[2:37:16.140 --> 2:37:20.220]  going to happen, how would you sum up what they're doing right now, and then go into
[2:37:20.220 --> 2:37:22.220]  the depression?
[2:37:22.220 --> 2:37:31.100]  Well, the summation is what you said is true, and I think that they are going to have trouble
[2:37:31.100 --> 2:37:35.300]  getting across what they're trying to get across.
[2:37:35.300 --> 2:37:45.460]  And that is, that they're going to find resistance about the way that they're rolling this thing
[2:37:45.460 --> 2:37:54.060]  into this new USA Bank, we're still going to get lots of questions admittedly from Wall
[2:37:54.060 --> 2:37:57.740]  Street, people who are not involved in this.
[2:37:57.740 --> 2:37:59.860]  What are you people doing?
[2:37:59.860 --> 2:38:04.420]  This is like Alexander Hamilton and his US Bank all over again.
[2:38:04.420 --> 2:38:13.900]  And of course that was defeated by Congress, but they are going to have trouble implementing
[2:38:13.900 --> 2:38:14.900]  this.
[2:38:14.900 --> 2:38:18.660]  It's not going to be easy, especially not in the middle of a depression, but you know
[2:38:18.660 --> 2:38:22.980]  they think that they're masters of the universe and they can get anything done that they want.
[2:38:22.980 --> 2:38:27.300]  Well, yeah, that's the issue is that it's totally unpopular, 98, 99% against at the
[2:38:27.300 --> 2:38:31.420]  polls, 1,001 phone calls against it in Congress, and that's with the public not even having
[2:38:31.420 --> 2:38:37.300]  one inkling how bad it really is, and then this is only the beginning, and then they're
[2:38:37.300 --> 2:38:41.300]  just giving us no quarter.
[2:38:41.300 --> 2:38:48.620]  You're right, and we discussed this yesterday, and it's our job to inform the public that
[2:38:48.620 --> 2:38:53.060]  this is going down, how it's going down, why it's going down, and what we've got to do
[2:38:53.060 --> 2:39:00.300]  about it, and that is, ring the phone off your congressman's wall and tell other people,
[2:39:00.300 --> 2:39:07.500]  demonstrate, right now, all over Europe, demonstrations are going berserk, and a lot of them becoming
[2:39:07.500 --> 2:39:13.820]  violent, the Iceland government is stepping down, you'll probably have government changes
[2:39:13.820 --> 2:39:18.820]  in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece.
[2:39:18.820 --> 2:39:22.940]  But the banker scam, the banker scam, when they do implode an economy and do this, as
[2:39:22.940 --> 2:39:26.940]  they're doing here, is to just put puppet after puppet until it wears the people out,
[2:39:26.940 --> 2:39:31.140]  but they're giving the people no quarter, so that's not going to work.
[2:39:31.140 --> 2:39:38.540]  No it's not going to work, and so it could turn into revolution in a number of countries.
[2:39:38.540 --> 2:39:42.100]  But they don't care because they want it all they want to know.
[2:39:42.100 --> 2:39:44.980]  That's right, and they've opened the window and they can't close it.
[2:39:44.980 --> 2:39:51.220]  They can't go back, they're beyond the halfway point to where they're going, and they have
[2:39:51.220 --> 2:39:58.860]  been since 2002, 2003, and the game is on, and we have to use the opportunities that
[2:39:58.860 --> 2:40:05.980]  we got to tell other people, this is what's happening to you, and I see on CNBC and reading
[2:40:05.980 --> 2:40:12.500]  in the business publications that the professionals in Wall Street are pulling the money out of
[2:40:12.500 --> 2:40:13.500]  banks.
[2:40:13.500 --> 2:40:18.500]  I mean, I never saw anything like that before in the last almost 50 years I've been involved
[2:40:18.500 --> 2:40:19.500]  in it.
[2:40:19.500 --> 2:40:23.180]  And I said six, eight months ago that I believe it would happen in the next year of the total
[2:40:23.180 --> 2:40:24.180]  implosion.
[2:40:24.180 --> 2:40:26.100]  I'm saying that's what the evidence looked like.
[2:40:26.100 --> 2:40:30.540]  You and many others, Dr. Roberts and others are saying two to three years, but I had Roberts
[2:40:30.540 --> 2:40:33.060]  on a few weeks ago and he said it may happen quicker now.
[2:40:33.060 --> 2:40:37.100]  Are you still saying two to three years until we actually inter-hell itself?
[2:40:37.100 --> 2:40:43.860]  Well I've said in the international forecaster, it now may happen quicker, just exactly what
[2:40:43.860 --> 2:40:47.620]  Mr. Roberts said, so we don't know the timing on that.
[2:40:47.620 --> 2:40:51.060]  All you know is it's bad and it's going to happen.
[2:40:51.060 --> 2:40:59.260]  And if you look at what they're doing, I don't know what stage is behind the scenes that
[2:40:59.260 --> 2:41:01.460]  they're planning is that.
[2:41:01.460 --> 2:41:08.300]  I mean they might come out next week and say, the big surprise that others have talked
[2:41:08.300 --> 2:41:17.500]  about that we have for you with the new administration is that we are going to work toward world
[2:41:17.500 --> 2:41:27.220]  financial regulatory control and eventually have a new financial order, a new currency
[2:41:27.220 --> 2:41:34.660]  for the entire world because we don't want this terrible devaluations to happen again.
[2:41:34.660 --> 2:41:41.660]  And then advertise it that the only solution to get America going in the world is this.
[2:41:41.660 --> 2:41:50.460]  And then they'll pull up somebody like Goebbels and he'll be on television every day and telling
[2:41:50.460 --> 2:41:54.900]  the people all this is what we've got to do.
[2:41:54.900 --> 2:42:00.100]  It is reckless and you're right, they've done it by design but clearly the execution has
[2:42:00.100 --> 2:42:04.420]  gotten out of control for them but it's like opening a screen door on a submarine, there's
[2:42:04.420 --> 2:42:07.980]  no putting the door back in place, they've committed, I mean they've jumped out of the
[2:42:07.980 --> 2:42:11.940]  airplane, parachute or not.
[2:42:11.940 --> 2:42:18.420]  And we have our weapons at our disposal as well and that is getting out to the public
[2:42:18.420 --> 2:42:27.420]  as best we can and when the public's disgruntled you tell them what the problem is and get
[2:42:27.420 --> 2:42:32.340]  them mobilized, I mean if you're out of work and you can't get a job and you're on some
[2:42:32.340 --> 2:42:38.340]  kind of welfare, you have plenty of time on your hands so you can start putting people
[2:42:38.340 --> 2:42:39.340]  together.
[2:42:39.340 --> 2:42:43.500]  Well what the public's got to know is that the establishment's going ahead with this
[2:42:43.500 --> 2:42:48.740]  and nothing they promise you is there to help you, it's to secure their global empire, if
[2:42:48.740 --> 2:42:53.860]  they can care less about starving and dying and murdered Iraqis or Africans, they don't
[2:42:53.860 --> 2:42:55.580]  care about you.
[2:42:55.580 --> 2:43:01.380]  And it still is reckless though, I mean if I was the power elite I would want soft power
[2:43:01.380 --> 2:43:07.460]  and but I guess I'm not the power elite and I'm not a psychopath.
[2:43:07.460 --> 2:43:14.700]  As Mr. Roberts spent 10 minutes one day on this program saying these people are insane.
[2:43:14.700 --> 2:43:22.620]  And he's absolutely right and he knows them better than we do because he worked in Washington
[2:43:22.620 --> 2:43:26.860]  and he knows that mindset.
[2:43:26.860 --> 2:43:31.060]  Well I mean it is insane, did you see the LA Times where they admit, they say hundreds
[2:43:31.060 --> 2:43:37.460]  of thousands of people for raising their voices on airplanes are arguing, are now being charged
[2:43:37.460 --> 2:43:43.340]  as terrorists and then are having their rights in trial stripped and they always promised
[2:43:43.340 --> 2:43:46.700]  the Patriot Act was only for Al Qaeda but now they're using it against marijuana, they're
[2:43:46.700 --> 2:43:53.460]  using it on the street, I mean that is classical tyranny right there.
[2:43:53.460 --> 2:43:58.780]  You're absolutely right and the gentleman was on before saying that people have thrown
[2:43:58.780 --> 2:44:03.620]  their hands in the air and they're going in the stores and just taking what they want
[2:44:03.620 --> 2:44:06.060]  and that's going to get worse.
[2:44:06.060 --> 2:44:12.660]  And there's millions of stores shutting down whether they're in clothing or food and all
[2:44:12.660 --> 2:44:17.860]  kinds of things, the economy's coming down.
[2:44:17.860 --> 2:44:24.820]  And you're now saying you think it's happening faster than you previously thought degrading
[2:44:24.820 --> 2:44:29.980]  slowly for two or three years, I know people can read the nuances of that in the international
[2:44:29.980 --> 2:44:38.780]  forecaster but for those that are listening right now, if you're revising your forecast,
[2:44:38.780 --> 2:44:41.860]  I mean project that for us.
[2:44:41.860 --> 2:44:48.380]  Well two weeks ago in the forecaster at the beginning of the forecaster where I always
[2:44:48.380 --> 2:44:54.780]  put something where I want to catch people's attention, I said this is it.
[2:44:54.780 --> 2:44:59.540]  People go all in on gold and silver because they're going to take off.
[2:44:59.540 --> 2:45:04.900]  Now they're going to take off because the news is going to get so bad and the ability
[2:45:04.900 --> 2:45:11.500]  to control those two markets is going to wane for the insiders who have been doing it.
[2:45:11.500 --> 2:45:17.180]  And I think things are about ready to bust out and fly and I've been dead right here
[2:45:17.180 --> 2:45:19.580]  over the next couple of weeks.
[2:45:19.580 --> 2:45:26.500]  We had two breakouts technically in gold and silver today and the sky's the limit now.
[2:45:26.500 --> 2:45:34.900]  I suppose along the way we'll have burps so to speak but we're going to test $20 on silver
[2:45:34.900 --> 2:45:42.740]  and silver because of the suppression by two banks, it could go up $3 or $4 in a day, there's
[2:45:42.740 --> 2:45:52.100]  no limits on silver which there was at one time a long time ago and it could be wild.
[2:45:52.100 --> 2:45:58.540]  And gold's going to go up and test $10.33 and it is going to break it and the market
[2:45:58.540 --> 2:46:00.580]  is going to go lower.
[2:46:00.580 --> 2:46:07.060]  Starting an hour and a half ago you could see the government come into the stock market
[2:46:07.060 --> 2:46:08.180]  trying to hold it up.
[2:46:08.180 --> 2:46:15.700]  They get the S&P and the NASDAQ up but they couldn't get the Dow off, their power is waning
[2:46:15.700 --> 2:46:19.260]  and the market's going to go down.
[2:46:19.260 --> 2:46:25.820]  And I'm sorry a bunch of deceived, pathetic Obama zombies prattling around cheerleading
[2:46:25.820 --> 2:46:31.780]  the government isn't going to change the fundamentals of what's happening.
[2:46:31.780 --> 2:46:37.980]  No and the fundamentals have been again deliberately put in place and all of the things that you
[2:46:37.980 --> 2:46:43.980]  see just aren't happening, they've been planned that way and we're just going to have to disrupt
[2:46:43.980 --> 2:46:44.980]  what they're doing.
[2:46:44.980 --> 2:46:48.540]  Gold's been shooting up, Gold's been shooting up so fast today, I don't even know what it's
[2:46:48.540 --> 2:46:51.140]  at right now, what's it at Bob?
[2:46:51.140 --> 2:46:58.460]  Well we know it's up over $37 and that's in the February contract, it's been up all
[2:46:58.460 --> 2:46:59.460]  day long.
[2:46:59.460 --> 2:47:04.260]  Well, Ted Anderson, go ahead, sorry, go ahead.
[2:47:04.260 --> 2:47:10.140]  But they tried to knock it down at $14, they couldn't do it.
[2:47:10.140 --> 2:47:14.700]  All I know is like we said yesterday with UBS grabbing 19,000 plus Swiss bank accounts
[2:47:14.700 --> 2:47:18.500]  of mid-level Nuba reach and they're doing this all over the place that the only way
[2:47:18.500 --> 2:47:23.460]  to protect assets that you've earned, even paid taxes on to the damn bankers, excuse
[2:47:23.460 --> 2:47:26.140]  me folks, that slipped out, I apologize.
[2:47:26.140 --> 2:47:32.860]  Even with those people, I mean all you can do is get Gold and Silver and I want to bring
[2:47:32.860 --> 2:47:38.060]  Ted Anderson in briefly here because Ted is still offering Gold at the offer he did yesterday
[2:47:38.060 --> 2:47:43.140]  that was last week's prices, that was what, $30 something under what he was able to buy
[2:47:43.140 --> 2:47:49.100]  it for and then today it's up $30 something more and so those were great deals yesterday,
[2:47:49.100 --> 2:47:51.140]  these deals are insane.
[2:47:51.140 --> 2:47:56.100]  Ted offering yesterday's deal today, is that a good deal Bob Chapman?
[2:47:56.100 --> 2:47:58.380]  Doesn't get any better.
[2:47:58.380 --> 2:48:01.660]  Ted Anderson, tell folks about today's Gold and Silver offer.
[2:48:01.660 --> 2:48:06.620]  Well yes, the question, Gold has gone over $903 today, so up over $900 an ounce in the
[2:48:06.620 --> 2:48:07.620]  closing contract.
[2:48:07.620 --> 2:48:08.620]  Then it's up $50.
[2:48:08.620 --> 2:48:14.340]  Yeah, you, right now, I repriced it, Frank's right now are at $225, if I want to sell Frank's
[2:48:14.340 --> 2:48:20.980]  today at today's price, they're $225, my yesterday's price was $202, that means that the Gold price,
[2:48:20.980 --> 2:48:26.940]  and this is, I priced it at about $890, so I mean I give, I'm $980, I'm sorry, $989
[2:48:26.940 --> 2:48:29.980]  right around there, so it's up higher than that right now, gives you an idea, these are
[2:48:29.980 --> 2:48:35.620]  up over 10% from the time that I bought these things to where they're at now.
[2:48:35.620 --> 2:48:42.460]  Frank's are at $225 currently, I'm selling them at $202, the British sovereigns right
[2:48:42.460 --> 2:48:48.500]  now are at $275, I'm selling those at $250, I also have the Gold Buffalo, I didn't have
[2:48:48.500 --> 2:48:53.580]  time to reprice those again, but they're going to be going up the same 10%, everything
[2:48:53.580 --> 2:48:55.180]  that I have is going up.
[2:48:55.180 --> 2:49:00.060]  The silver coins right now, that the walking liberty haves that we've been talking about
[2:49:00.060 --> 2:49:04.820]  at $840, I have to reprice those, I will hold this special through the weekend, but I'm
[2:49:04.820 --> 2:49:08.860]  telling you, the market holds into this $900 range, there's going to be a whole new set
[2:49:08.860 --> 2:49:10.860]  of prices, and everything's going to be up to $15 more.
[2:49:10.860 --> 2:49:17.620]  Now let's explain, you have limited supplies of silver and gold at the price when the market
[2:49:17.620 --> 2:49:19.420]  was at what, $830?
[2:49:19.420 --> 2:49:23.020]  Yeah, that's when I picked it up, Alex, it was when Gold was sitting there down, it
[2:49:23.020 --> 2:49:27.100]  was trying to test $700 an ounce, and then I'm buying like a madman, trying to get as
[2:49:27.100 --> 2:49:28.780]  much supply as I can.
[2:49:28.780 --> 2:49:32.180]  Now the market, without a question, has just gone up about $100.
[2:49:32.180 --> 2:49:38.020]  Specifically, this gold you bought on average, those different buys in there, how much, the
[2:49:38.020 --> 2:49:41.220]  gold you're selling now is priced at where in the market?
[2:49:41.220 --> 2:49:45.380]  Right now, if you took that same coin, it would be $225, and I'm selling that coin right
[2:49:45.380 --> 2:49:46.900]  now at $202.
[2:49:46.900 --> 2:49:50.620]  That's one of the examples, I've got several different examples just like that, I can't
[2:49:50.620 --> 2:49:55.500]  buy it from one place, I have to make a lot of buys, it's hard to get this stuff now.

[2:51:01.380 --> 2:51:07.340]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:51:07.340 --> 2:51:08.860]  against this country.
[2:51:08.860 --> 2:51:12.580]  The enemies struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[2:51:12.580 --> 2:51:14.020]  Bin Laden.
[2:51:14.020 --> 2:51:15.020]  This is his MO.
[2:51:15.020 --> 2:51:16.020]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:51:16.020 --> 2:51:18.220]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:51:18.220 --> 2:51:22.860]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:51:22.860 --> 2:51:25.460]  networks inside the United States.
[2:51:25.460 --> 2:51:29.900]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:51:29.900 --> 2:51:32.100]  in and on the U.S.
[2:51:32.100 --> 2:51:35.860]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:51:35.860 --> 2:51:41.220]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:51:41.220 --> 2:51:45.260]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[2:51:45.260 --> 2:51:46.260]  much more.
[2:51:46.260 --> 2:51:47.260]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:52:07.220 --> 2:52:10.220]  A couple of soft drinks each day, a few slices of pizza.
[2:52:10.220 --> 2:52:11.660]  These nights cheeseburgers.
[2:52:11.660 --> 2:52:15.900]  These acidic foods will make you tired, overweight and cause numerous negative health problems
[2:52:15.900 --> 2:52:17.860]  in the short and long term.
[2:52:17.860 --> 2:52:23.180]  An acidic environment is created in the body causing fuzzy memory and that all day low
[2:52:23.180 --> 2:52:24.460]  energy feeling.
[2:52:24.460 --> 2:52:27.780]  These are the early signs of your body telling you that it's not getting the proper care
[2:52:27.780 --> 2:52:28.780]  it needs.
[2:52:28.780 --> 2:52:31.220]  We are truly a junk food nation.

[2:53:00.420 --> 2:53:07.060]  What's in your water?
[2:53:07.060 --> 2:53:16.580]  This is the end, beautiful friend.
[2:53:16.580 --> 2:53:32.100]  This is the end, my only friend, the end of our elaborate class, the end of everything
[2:53:32.100 --> 2:53:35.020]  that starts the end.
[2:53:35.020 --> 2:53:51.060]  No safety, no safety, no surprise, the end, I'll never look into your eyes again.
[2:53:51.060 --> 2:54:15.700]  Can you picture what will be so limitless, and that hand is the hand of Barack Obama
[2:54:15.700 --> 2:54:18.860]  that is going to betray you even greater.
[2:54:18.860 --> 2:54:22.980]  That's what they do, they build the crises off of the solution and always gets worse.
[2:54:22.980 --> 2:54:26.140]  Bob Chapman, the internationalforecaster.com, we'll give you a toll free number to call
[2:54:26.140 --> 2:54:31.100]  and get a free trial, a subscription, a sample of it, it's excellent.
[2:54:31.100 --> 2:54:37.380]  Ted Anderson, you're saying you've got enough gold and silver there to hold this special
[2:54:37.380 --> 2:54:42.700]  throughout the weekend with gold cresting up to $900 an ounce, silver going up.
[2:54:42.700 --> 2:54:44.140]  Tell us about the silver offer.
[2:54:44.140 --> 2:54:49.100]  Yeah, the silver currently right now, the walking liberty halves, but like I said, Alex,
[2:54:49.100 --> 2:54:54.660]  in very limited supply, I mean, we will take orders through this weekend, I was just warned
[2:54:54.660 --> 2:54:59.740]  by my trader that she cannot get them past that, we will have to raise their prices,
[2:54:59.740 --> 2:55:01.660]  we will have to reflect what Silver's doing.
[2:55:01.660 --> 2:55:05.660]  Let's be clear, during the break, your traders are running and saying, watch it, Ted, watch
[2:55:05.660 --> 2:55:06.660]  it.
[2:55:06.660 --> 2:55:11.820]  Yeah, they're calling all their sources right now to try to gear up for this particular
[2:55:11.820 --> 2:55:15.980]  special because everybody knows the phones are going to blow off the hook.
[2:55:15.980 --> 2:55:19.860]  And if you're not calling to buy gold and silver while you're watching what's going
[2:55:19.860 --> 2:55:25.220]  on in the market right now, and you've got money sitting the bank, I think you're nuts.
[2:55:25.220 --> 2:55:26.220]  The market.
[2:55:26.220 --> 2:55:27.220]  800.
[2:55:27.220 --> 2:55:28.220]  800.
[2:55:28.220 --> 2:55:29.220]  686.
[2:55:29.220 --> 2:55:30.220]  2237.
[2:55:30.220 --> 2:55:31.220]  800.
[2:55:31.220 --> 2:55:32.220]  686.
[2:55:32.220 --> 2:55:33.220]  2237.
[2:55:33.220 --> 2:55:34.220]  This is what I believe in.
[2:55:34.220 --> 2:55:35.220]  That number on your screen.
[2:55:35.220 --> 2:55:36.220]  800.
[2:55:36.220 --> 2:55:37.220]  686.
[2:55:37.220 --> 2:55:38.220]  2237.
[2:55:38.220 --> 2:55:39.220]  Midas resources.
[2:55:39.220 --> 2:55:40.220]  Bob Chapman.
[2:55:40.220 --> 2:55:45.220]  I mean, we were telling people on the show when it was $286 an ounce, six years ago to
[2:55:45.220 --> 2:55:49.500]  buy gold because we knew they were going to devalue the currency.
[2:55:49.500 --> 2:55:52.740]  It's gone up to 1,000, it's gone back down, it's going racing right back up.
[2:55:52.740 --> 2:55:54.780]  They're not being able to suppress it.
[2:55:54.780 --> 2:55:58.500]  Should people get into gold and silver now, especially because they're getting last week's
[2:55:58.500 --> 2:56:02.380]  prices today during a gold bull market?
[2:56:02.380 --> 2:56:07.780]  Well, it certainly doesn't get any better than that price wise.
[2:56:07.780 --> 2:56:12.260]  And as you know, I've said all in, I mean, this is it.
[2:56:12.260 --> 2:56:16.180]  And I'm telling people to pull their money out of banks, except what they need for operating
[2:56:16.180 --> 2:56:21.340]  expenses and taking a hard look at their insurance policies because insurance companies
[2:56:21.340 --> 2:56:29.540]  are asking regulators to lower the bar for them, just in case the stock market dow drops
[2:56:29.540 --> 2:56:30.540]  from 8,400.
[2:56:30.540 --> 2:56:34.220]  I was about to say, every time Ted says your annuities aren't insured, we get hate mail,
[2:56:34.220 --> 2:56:37.740]  then they call back apologizing saying, okay, I found out it's true, I'm not insured.
[2:56:37.740 --> 2:56:41.500]  Annuities are not insured, FDIC, are they?
[2:56:41.500 --> 2:56:42.500]  No.
[2:56:42.500 --> 2:56:46.180]  And not only that, you know, they're in the market.
[2:56:46.180 --> 2:56:48.580]  And market goes down, they're going to go down.
[2:56:48.580 --> 2:56:52.140]  There will be insurance companies that will be in trouble, whether the government will
[2:56:52.140 --> 2:56:53.140]  bail them out or not.
[2:56:53.140 --> 2:56:54.140]  I don't know.
[2:56:54.140 --> 2:56:57.460]  But why take the chance when you get something that's going up?
[2:56:57.460 --> 2:57:02.220]  There is one thing that they can't get their greedy hands on, and that's gold and silver
[2:57:02.220 --> 2:57:03.860]  and precious metals.
[2:57:03.860 --> 2:57:07.100]  They can put property taxes on your land and take it, they can do anything.
[2:57:07.100 --> 2:57:10.540]  They can't get your gold and silver unless they physically stick you up for it.
[2:57:10.540 --> 2:57:11.540]  So 800-686-2237.
[2:57:11.540 --> 2:57:16.260]  Ted, you're holding this deal until what?
[2:57:16.260 --> 2:57:17.260]  Sunday evening?
[2:57:17.260 --> 2:57:18.260]  Sunday evening.
[2:57:18.260 --> 2:57:21.340]  I'll place your orders by Sunday evening or you'll pay more, there's no question about
[2:57:21.340 --> 2:57:22.340]  it.
[2:57:22.340 --> 2:57:23.340]  800-686-2237.
[2:57:23.340 --> 2:57:29.100]  Bob, can you stay, just one more five minute segment, I've got a few other financial questions
[2:57:29.100 --> 2:57:30.100]  for you.
[2:57:30.100 --> 2:57:31.100]  Here.
[2:57:31.100 --> 2:57:32.100]  Okay.
[2:57:32.100 --> 2:57:34.940]  Oh, and in the 10 seconds we've got left, well, we'll just come back and also go about
[2:57:34.940 --> 2:57:37.660]  the number for folks to get a free copy of your newsletter.
[2:57:37.660 --> 2:57:44.220]  Stay with us, 800-686-2237.
[2:57:44.220 --> 2:57:46.580]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[2:57:51.740 --> 2:57:53.340]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[2:57:53.340 --> 2:57:57.180]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[2:57:57.180 --> 2:57:58.180]  important than ever.
[2:57:58.180 --> 2:58:01.180]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[2:58:01.180 --> 2:58:03.980]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[2:58:03.980 --> 2:58:07.860]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[2:58:07.860 --> 2:58:10.260]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[2:58:10.260 --> 2:58:13.500]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[2:58:13.500 --> 2:58:17.860]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[2:58:17.860 --> 2:58:21.540]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the
[2:58:21.540 --> 2:58:23.780]  cost of last year's grocery prices.
[2:58:23.780 --> 2:58:29.100]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[2:58:33.780 --> 2:58:35.260]  foods they have to offer.
[2:58:35.260 --> 2:58:40.260]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[2:58:40.260 --> 2:58:46.620]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:58:46.620 --> 2:58:47.620]  Take action today.
[2:58:47.620 --> 2:58:54.620]  The first step is getting storable food.
[2:58:54.620 --> 2:58:56.780]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:58:56.780 --> 2:59:03.780]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[2:59:26.780 --> 2:59:33.780]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:59:56.780 --> 3:00:07.420]  They're talking about bank holidays.
[3:00:07.420 --> 3:00:11.580]  It's in the news that money people are getting their money out of the banks.
[3:00:11.580 --> 3:00:15.980]  They're talking about a bank holiday, a devaluation.
[3:00:15.980 --> 3:00:19.380]  We've seen Gerald Salente and all these really accurate trends forecasters the best in the
[3:00:19.380 --> 3:00:25.420]  world saying they believe bank runs in or bank holidays to stop them in mid-February.
[3:00:25.420 --> 3:00:26.420]  That's only a few weeks away.
[3:00:26.420 --> 3:00:27.420]  I hope he's wrong.
[3:00:27.420 --> 3:00:30.020]  What do you see, Bob?
[3:00:30.020 --> 3:00:36.100]  I see it happening, but I just don't know what the timing on it is.
[3:00:36.100 --> 3:00:41.580]  I think the next two weeks are going to be crucial because we may get an idea of the
[3:00:41.580 --> 3:00:50.700]  timetable that the alumnus are going to use to regulate the world financial system.
[3:00:50.700 --> 3:00:55.700]  I think that's going to be very important and hopefully they will let us know what they're
[3:00:55.700 --> 3:00:59.820]  going to do and then we can work against that program.
[3:00:59.820 --> 3:01:04.100]  As far as the bank holiday is concerned, I just can't say.
[3:01:04.100 --> 3:01:05.100]  It's going to happen.
[3:01:05.100 --> 3:01:06.540]  I just don't know when.
[3:01:06.540 --> 3:01:11.540]  Well, Gethner, who doesn't pay his taxes to the private IRS, the private Federal Reserve,
[3:01:11.540 --> 3:01:17.340]  he went before Congress, as you know, two days ago and he said, we're not going to tell
[3:01:17.340 --> 3:01:22.140]  you what we're planning, but it's international in scope and it's not going to be popular.
[3:01:22.140 --> 3:01:23.140]  What is?
[3:01:23.140 --> 3:01:24.140]  I mean...
[3:01:24.140 --> 3:01:29.060]  That's what we just said and that's what you said yesterday and you were right.
[3:01:29.060 --> 3:01:30.060]  I'm right.
[3:01:30.060 --> 3:01:32.060]  And that's what they're going to do.
[3:01:32.060 --> 3:01:38.020]  And you know, down the line this year with the hearings that they've had regarding retirement
[3:01:38.020 --> 3:01:40.980]  plans, what are they going to do with that?
[3:01:40.980 --> 3:01:46.980]  I mean, are they going to try to roll the retirement plans into Social Security and make it retroactive?
[3:01:46.980 --> 3:01:54.700]  I know we're from January the 1st, 2009, and they passed legislation in August and they
[3:01:54.700 --> 3:01:58.100]  say, whoops, all you people who have taken your money out, you've got to give it back
[3:01:58.100 --> 3:01:59.100]  to us.
[3:01:59.100 --> 3:02:00.100]  Well, they're openly saying...
[3:02:00.100 --> 3:02:04.800]  I mean, these people in Washington, they're real beauties.
[3:02:04.800 --> 3:02:07.460]  That's actually in the Wall Street Journal.
[3:02:07.460 --> 3:02:11.460]  They're saying what bank nationalization means for you and it says the government's going
[3:02:11.460 --> 3:02:16.820]  to take over your funds and your 401Ks for your own safety and congressional testimony
[3:02:16.820 --> 3:02:17.820]  a month ago.
[3:02:17.820 --> 3:02:20.180]  They said they're going to start taxing and stealing part of it.
[3:02:20.180 --> 3:02:26.980]  So not only will it be devalued, they'll protect it by stealing large portions.
[3:02:26.980 --> 3:02:27.980]  You're right.
[3:02:27.980 --> 3:02:30.500]  And that's what they intend to do.
[3:02:30.500 --> 3:02:34.020]  But the timing again, I don't know.
[3:02:34.020 --> 3:02:39.420]  I don't know for sure they're going to make it retroactive in regard to retirement.
[3:02:39.420 --> 3:02:41.740]  But knowing them, they probably will.
[3:02:41.740 --> 3:02:48.740]  I mean, just like the 1986 Tax Reform Act, every accountant in the nation thought that
[3:02:48.740 --> 3:02:54.260]  the people who had abided by the law would be grandfathered in.
[3:02:54.260 --> 3:02:56.300]  They didn't grandfather anyone in.
[3:02:56.300 --> 3:02:59.260]  Eight million million is when bankrupt.
[3:02:59.260 --> 3:03:00.780]  Well, it was worse than that.
[3:03:00.780 --> 3:03:04.740]  My dad was no millionaire then, but he was a successful dentist owning a dental office.
[3:03:04.740 --> 3:03:09.500]  And I remember they took basically everything we had and they said to my dad in the office,
[3:03:09.500 --> 3:03:12.540]  in the IRS, they said, Mr. Jones, we know you did everything by the book.
[3:03:12.540 --> 3:03:16.420]  We're white collar criminals and we're going to take everything you've got.
[3:03:16.420 --> 3:03:17.420]  And it was retroactive.
[3:03:17.420 --> 3:03:22.980]  They changed the tax law, claimed you owed all this money with interest.
[3:03:22.980 --> 3:03:23.980]  I was there.
[3:03:23.980 --> 3:03:27.100]  I know I was entrapped in it.
[3:03:27.100 --> 3:03:35.940]  And I beat them because you were a patriot and knew all about the New World Order.
[3:03:35.940 --> 3:03:36.940]  That's right.
[3:03:36.940 --> 3:03:39.500]  That's like exactly what to expect from them.
[3:03:39.500 --> 3:03:44.820]  Give us the number to get a complimentary copy of the International Forecaster.
[3:03:44.820 --> 3:04:01.140]  That number is 877, you always catch me here, 877-479-8178, again, 877-479-8178, toll free.
[3:04:01.140 --> 3:04:02.140]  Thank you, Bob.
[3:04:02.140 --> 3:04:07.180]  This is the new multipolar inline and portable water system new from hempusa.org.
[3:04:07.180 --> 3:04:11.860]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source rendering chemicals
[3:04:11.860 --> 3:04:15.740]  harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[3:04:15.740 --> 3:04:20.780]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[3:04:20.780 --> 3:04:25.780]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere making it our number one new product
[3:04:25.780 --> 3:04:27.860]  from hempusa.org.
[3:04:27.860 --> 3:04:32.580]  This water system will de-scale all piping, hot water heaters and appliances due to heavy
[3:04:32.580 --> 3:04:34.140]  buildup of hard minerals.
[3:04:34.140 --> 3:04:38.620]  Detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering the fine capillaries
[3:04:38.620 --> 3:04:43.980]  of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins with extreme positive effects on plants,
[3:04:43.980 --> 3:04:49.020]  vegetables and fruits, improved taste, color, size and yield with approximately 30% less
[3:04:49.020 --> 3:04:50.180]  water usage.
[3:04:50.180 --> 3:04:54.060]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[3:04:54.060 --> 3:05:01.980]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608, that's 908-691-2608.
[3:05:01.980 --> 3:05:07.140]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:05:07.140 --> 3:05:08.660]  against this country.
[3:05:08.660 --> 3:05:12.860]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[3:05:12.860 --> 3:05:13.860]  Bin Laden.
[3:05:13.860 --> 3:05:14.860]  This is his MO.
[3:05:14.860 --> 3:05:18.020]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:05:18.020 --> 3:05:22.620]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:05:22.620 --> 3:05:25.220]  networks inside the United States.
[3:05:25.220 --> 3:05:29.700]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:05:29.700 --> 3:05:31.860]  in and on the US.
[3:05:31.860 --> 3:05:35.420]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.

[3:07:02.940 --> 3:07:05.580]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:07:05.580 --> 3:07:35.380]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:07:35.580 --> 3:07:41.740]  Nothing like delicious boiling hot coffee.
[3:07:41.740 --> 3:07:47.140]  Oh, man, people sometimes like my wife pick up my coffee and she'll say, how do you drink
[3:07:47.140 --> 3:07:48.140]  it that hot?
[3:07:48.140 --> 3:07:50.140]  It's the only way.
[3:07:50.140 --> 3:07:51.140]  Mmm.
[3:07:51.140 --> 3:07:52.140]  Delicious.
[3:07:52.140 --> 3:07:56.300]  I'm going to go to your phone calls, including some of the disagree in a moment.
[3:07:56.300 --> 3:07:59.380]  Before I do that, I want to tell you about a really exciting new sponsor we have.
[3:07:59.380 --> 3:08:02.460]  Now, they ship all over the country, but they're based right here in Austin, Texas.
[3:08:02.460 --> 3:08:06.340]  They got these huge rainwater collectors, and then they purify it after that.
[3:08:06.340 --> 3:08:10.620]  These are Patriot, Anti-New World Order folks, and they sent us some of this stuff like a
[3:08:10.620 --> 3:08:12.780]  month ago, and I was drinking it around the office, and I'm like, this is really good
[3:08:12.780 --> 3:08:13.780]  bottled water.
[3:08:13.780 --> 3:08:14.780]  Well, it is.
[3:08:14.780 --> 3:08:15.780]  This is bottled water.
[3:08:15.780 --> 3:08:16.780]  You can trust.
[3:08:16.780 --> 3:08:25.540]  Pure Rain is the website, PureRainUSA.com, PureRainUSA.com, they have another, TexasPureRain.com,
[3:08:25.540 --> 3:08:29.140]  and it's free delivery anywhere in Austin and in a few surrounding areas.
[3:08:29.140 --> 3:08:34.580]  So give them a call to find out more at 512-514-1076.
[3:08:34.580 --> 3:08:39.380]  Another thing in this economy falling apart by design, Patriot's got to stick together.
[3:08:39.380 --> 3:08:42.940]  That means supporting the sponsors of this show, or AM and FM affiliates.
[3:08:42.940 --> 3:08:47.100]  It means all of us supporting each other, and this is just a great deal, very inexpensive.
[3:08:47.100 --> 3:08:58.300]  Check them out, 512-514-1076, or TexasPureRain.com, go to their website and find out more at PureRainUSA.com
[3:08:58.300 --> 3:09:00.660]  as well.
[3:09:00.660 --> 3:09:06.420]  And one other sponsor, Solutions From Science advertises like five different things with
[3:09:06.420 --> 3:09:07.420]  us.
[3:09:07.420 --> 3:09:10.380]  And the reason I like Solutions From Science has been around a long time, they only get
[3:09:10.380 --> 3:09:15.660]  the best units out there, the best seeds, heirloom, the best, their whole product lines
[3:09:15.660 --> 3:09:16.660]  are awesome things.
[3:09:16.660 --> 3:09:21.540]  We only take sponsors, we believe in, and Solutions From Science found the best solar
[3:09:21.540 --> 3:09:23.340]  kit for the price.
[3:09:23.340 --> 3:09:25.860]  You can get a couple of these and run your whole house, I guess four or five of them,
[3:09:25.860 --> 3:09:27.460]  or just get one and run certain things.
[3:09:27.460 --> 3:09:30.940]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow, ice storms, listeners
[3:09:30.940 --> 3:09:33.820]  should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that, the
[3:09:33.820 --> 3:09:37.940]  solar powered generator is now available from our long time sponsors, Solutions From Science
[3:09:37.940 --> 3:09:42.140]  is designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage
[3:09:42.140 --> 3:09:43.140]  or just use it every day.
[3:09:43.140 --> 3:09:46.940]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of the Power Source 1,800 power
[3:09:46.940 --> 3:09:50.420]  plant and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[3:09:50.420 --> 3:09:52.340]  That's right, it generates free electricity folks.
[3:09:52.340 --> 3:10:01.180]  MySolarBackup.com, one word, MySolarBackup.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365,
[3:10:01.180 --> 3:10:06.580]  and again, the sponsors make this show possible.
[3:10:06.580 --> 3:10:11.180]  People disagree, let's, they get to go to the headline, but I gotta be quick with you
[3:10:11.180 --> 3:10:12.420]  because I want to get everybody else.
[3:10:12.420 --> 3:10:16.060]  Bob in Florida who disagrees, you're on the air.
[3:10:16.060 --> 3:10:18.060]  Hello Bob.
[3:10:18.060 --> 3:10:25.820]  Good afternoon, yeah, I got a question about, it seems like you always criticize people
[3:10:25.820 --> 3:10:30.900]  who see things differently than you, like for instance, that guy who made Zeitgeist
[3:10:30.900 --> 3:10:35.940]  Addendum, Peter Joseph, I don't understand why you have to criticize his movie.
[3:10:35.940 --> 3:10:41.900]  Anybody who exposes Federal Reserve or 9-11 should be encouraging him or supporting them.
[3:10:41.900 --> 3:10:47.300]  He has obviously different views on the solution, but one of the main views is to end the Federal
[3:10:47.300 --> 3:10:48.300]  Reserve.
[3:10:48.300 --> 3:10:53.060]  So if somebody came, like you say, like you say we should do, you should encourage other
[3:10:53.060 --> 3:10:54.060]  people.
[3:10:54.060 --> 3:11:00.300]  Well, you know, let me just say this, I could have probably done that better, but so could
[3:11:00.300 --> 3:11:01.300]  he.
[3:11:01.300 --> 3:11:05.260]  I mean, I was saying that most of our programming is innate, he said no, that's not true, everything
[3:11:05.260 --> 3:11:09.460]  is learned, and I just said, but we have all these studies, and he just said no, I'm an
[3:11:09.460 --> 3:11:12.660]  intellectual, you're not, and it made me angry.
[3:11:12.660 --> 3:11:16.420]  I agree with a lot of what the film has to say, and I said that to him, and he used a
[3:11:16.420 --> 3:11:19.700]  lot of my footage in the first Zeitgeist.
[3:11:19.700 --> 3:11:26.940]  The point is, is that I disagree with the central planning, and he did say on the show
[3:11:26.940 --> 3:11:30.260]  that I would have to be reeducated under the system, that I would have to do what they
[3:11:30.260 --> 3:11:32.780]  said, and that I would be reeducated.
[3:11:32.780 --> 3:11:36.540]  Now did you hear him say, I would have to be go to a reeducation center?
[3:11:36.540 --> 3:11:38.980]  No, I didn't hear that at all.
[3:11:38.980 --> 3:11:44.500]  Well you better go listen to the hour and a half interview, near the end.
[3:11:44.500 --> 3:11:52.900]  See, I've seen what they're putting out before, this utopias, what the globalist push, and
[3:11:52.900 --> 3:11:55.340]  so am I perfect, absolutely not.
[3:11:55.340 --> 3:11:59.980]  Yeah, but even utopias in the Bible, I mean, it's okay to want utopia, it's fine, it's
[3:11:59.980 --> 3:12:05.980]  okay, it's not bad, it's not bad, you know, reality, you know, it's okay to do it.
[3:12:05.980 --> 3:12:10.060]  A centralized directorate, he says run by a computer, who's going to program that computer?
[3:12:10.060 --> 3:12:11.700]  Just, I appreciate your call, man.
[3:12:11.700 --> 3:12:14.060]  Look, okay, fine, believe it.
[3:12:14.060 --> 3:12:16.500]  It's good, it's wonderful, I'm bad.
[3:12:16.500 --> 3:12:22.020]  The big thing is I don't talk like this and do intellectual stuff and go, you know, I
[3:12:22.020 --> 3:12:26.300]  got a redneck voice, so Alex Jones is an idiot, no Alex Jones is pretty darn smart, and all
[3:12:26.300 --> 3:12:29.620]  he does is interview the people that have been right over and over again.
[3:12:29.620 --> 3:12:33.340]  We know what we're talking about, we're on the cutting edge, we predict the future, we
[3:12:33.340 --> 3:12:38.060]  know what's happening, okay, I know what that is.
[3:12:38.060 --> 3:12:40.860]  You know, even though it attacked anybody who's religious or anybody who has faith in
[3:12:40.860 --> 3:12:44.140]  the first one, I didn't really attack it for that, I stayed out of it, even though they
[3:12:44.140 --> 3:12:48.540]  used my footage without me even knowing, and my problem with that was, is that I then
[3:12:48.540 --> 3:12:55.580]  got blamed for that, because I was in the movie, but I was nice after the thing was
[3:12:55.580 --> 3:12:58.620]  out already out of the barn door, and I said whatever, just use it, and they know they
[3:12:58.620 --> 3:13:01.620]  contacted me about it, and what do I get for that?
[3:13:01.620 --> 3:13:07.100]  I'm bad, I'm evil, because I don't want to go to a re-education center, okay, fine.
[3:13:07.100 --> 3:13:13.620]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in Brazil, who also disagrees, go ahead Don.
[3:13:13.620 --> 3:13:20.780]  Yeah, hey Alex, I just want to tell you, I'm a long time listener, and a recent member
[3:13:20.780 --> 3:13:26.940]  of prison planet, and I really like it, I'm a big supporter, but I do have to agree with
[3:13:26.940 --> 3:13:33.140]  that guy that said, if you sometimes exaggerate things, or just lead a look, okay, well let
[3:13:33.140 --> 3:13:35.260]  me ask you about this.
[3:13:35.260 --> 3:13:43.700]  How about Title 50, Chapter 32, U.S. Code, Section Paragraph B?
[3:13:43.700 --> 3:13:47.460]  Yeah, I think you've said it, go ahead.
[3:13:47.460 --> 3:13:53.540]  Yeah, you said that that gives the government the right to do biological or chemical testing
[3:13:53.540 --> 3:14:01.060]  on Americans, well, doesn't Paragraph C say that you need informed consent?
[3:14:01.060 --> 3:14:07.220]  Unless, unless it's being done for research purposes, read below it.
[3:14:07.220 --> 3:14:13.380]  Oh, well, there's Paragraph D that says you've got to have notable.
[3:14:13.380 --> 3:14:18.100]  Your iPhone, or your IP phone's cutting out, say it again.
[3:14:18.100 --> 3:14:23.220]  Paragraph D, C is informed consent of every human subject that's involved in the testing,
[3:14:23.220 --> 3:14:29.100]  and Paragraph D is, you've got to give prior notice to Congress.
[3:14:29.100 --> 3:14:34.540]  I don't have that up in front of me, but, oh man, I wish somebody would I am that to
[3:14:34.540 --> 3:14:37.180]  me right now so I could just read it.
[3:14:37.180 --> 3:14:42.380]  That has been, I have covered that 50 times on air years ago with it in my hand, and I
[3:14:42.380 --> 3:14:43.380]  know what it says.
[3:14:43.380 --> 3:14:47.900]  Now there's been amendments to it, it's been changed, so there's several versions as well.
[3:14:47.900 --> 3:14:54.540]  But if you look at U.S. Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B, is that
[3:14:54.540 --> 3:14:57.540]  what you have in front of you?
[3:14:57.540 --> 3:15:00.100]  Yes, I got the updated version of it, I'm looking at it right now.
[3:15:00.100 --> 3:15:05.620]  No, I asked you, I asked you, I'm making sure from memory I've got it right.
[3:15:05.620 --> 3:15:13.860]  I'll have to type it in right now on air, I'll have to pull it up right now, hold on.
[3:15:13.860 --> 3:15:17.300]  It's hard to do this while I'm talking on air, just keep going.
[3:15:17.300 --> 3:15:22.260]  If you read that in the legalese, and then in the cases it's been used, let me ask you
[3:15:22.260 --> 3:15:26.980]  this, are you aware that they've done without consent on troops and everybody else and on
[3:15:26.980 --> 3:15:30.980]  U.S. cities thousands of chemical, biological, and radiological tests?
[3:15:30.980 --> 3:15:35.860]  Are you denying that without conform consent, say, five years ago they sprayed almost all
[3:15:35.860 --> 3:15:40.500]  of Oklahoma with Subtilis-Globa-G bacteria out of aircraft?
[3:15:40.500 --> 3:15:43.260]  No, Alex, no, I'm not.
[3:15:43.260 --> 3:15:48.180]  Let me stop you, did they get conform consent there?
[3:15:48.180 --> 3:15:50.580]  No, they probably didn't.
[3:15:50.580 --> 3:15:55.940]  Now let me stop you again, all I know is, is that when I've read U.S. Code, Title 50,
[3:15:55.940 --> 3:16:02.180]  number 32, subsection 1520A, paragraph B, and I can play you a newscast right now where
[3:16:02.180 --> 3:16:06.940]  they say in the newscast that they didn't tell people, it says in there you've got
[3:16:06.940 --> 3:16:12.500]  to get conform consent, but if you read the legalese in it, sir, it then says unless it's
[3:16:12.500 --> 3:16:17.340]  for research purposes, and then they don't, you have to go look at the U.S. Code finding
[3:16:17.340 --> 3:16:20.980]  list that they have there to see what that means.
[3:16:20.980 --> 3:16:24.940]  Just like when I said the Patriot Act would be used in non-terror related cases because
[3:16:24.940 --> 3:16:29.420]  of Section 802 saying any action that endangers a human life that's a violation of any federal
[3:16:29.420 --> 3:16:34.580]  or state law, then you've got to go look at the coding on that, and then now the proofs
[3:16:34.580 --> 3:16:38.140]  in the pudding that my interpretation of that is right, because tens of thousands of
[3:16:38.140 --> 3:16:42.300]  people in non-terror related cases are being charged under the Patriot Act.
[3:16:42.300 --> 3:16:47.100]  Okay, well, yeah, I don't, I mean, you're wrong, look, look, look, I don't even have
[3:16:47.100 --> 3:16:49.060]  it in front of me, and I know-
[3:16:49.060 --> 3:16:50.860]  I do, I have it in front of me.
[3:16:50.860 --> 3:16:58.020]  Okay, well, well, this is what I want you to do, read the subsection, okay, read, read
[3:16:58.020 --> 3:17:01.260]  above it, go ahead and read it right now.
[3:17:01.260 --> 3:17:04.500]  Subsection, what, C, paragraph C, or C.
[3:17:04.500 --> 3:17:08.940]  I don't have it in front of me, I just know in there, in several of the versions, there's
[3:17:08.940 --> 3:17:13.060]  one where they took it out and they brought it back, it says unless it's for research
[3:17:13.060 --> 3:17:16.700]  purposes, you're saying it doesn't say that in there?
[3:17:16.700 --> 3:17:20.740]  No, sir, no, sir, I don't see for not research purposes, but let me, let me just say one
[3:17:20.740 --> 3:17:24.780]  thing, we're getting a little bit too much on detail, I'm not really want to get on you
[3:17:24.780 --> 3:17:26.900]  about that much, I just want to say-
[3:17:26.900 --> 3:17:31.900]  Hey, hey, stop, stop, stop, stop, it's not exaggeration.
[3:17:31.900 --> 3:17:34.340]  What I say is in the Patriot Act is there.
[3:17:34.340 --> 3:17:40.140]  Now, if they've amended the U.S. code and changed it, good.
[3:17:40.140 --> 3:17:45.260]  I know it became a big news on national news years ago, sir, this has been a major issue.
[3:17:45.260 --> 3:17:50.220]  I don't keep track of the entire federal registry, but I'm telling you, you can find copies of
[3:17:50.220 --> 3:17:55.180]  it on government websites with a version that says unless it's research purposes, then they
[3:17:55.180 --> 3:17:57.180]  don't need informed consent.
[3:17:57.180 --> 3:18:00.540]  Okay, so maybe that was a past thing, yeah, but then-
[3:18:00.540 --> 3:18:04.220]  I don't know, I'm saying I don't get up here on air and lie.
[3:18:04.220 --> 3:18:09.740]  Okay, if I get up here and say, if I get up, why the hell would I sit here, excuse me,
[3:18:09.740 --> 3:18:16.260]  why would I get up here and say go look this up and then it's not there?
[3:18:16.260 --> 3:18:18.580]  Why on earth would I do that?
[3:18:18.580 --> 3:18:19.580]  Okay?
[3:18:19.580 --> 3:18:22.020]  There's laws change all the time.
[3:18:22.020 --> 3:18:24.020]  I don't exaggerate, sir.
[3:18:24.020 --> 3:18:25.020]  I don't exaggerate.
[3:18:25.020 --> 3:18:27.780]  Let me ask you one other thing.
[3:18:27.780 --> 3:18:28.780]  Let me ask you one other thing.
[3:18:28.780 --> 3:18:29.780]  Go ahead.
[3:18:29.780 --> 3:18:37.580]  You said that David Rockefeller went into the board meetings of the other, all the large
[3:18:37.580 --> 3:18:42.580]  oil, American oil companies other than Exxon Mobil and told them they were all fired.
[3:18:42.580 --> 3:18:46.580]  Yes, he went into a bunch of them, yes, he went into a bunch of them.
[3:18:46.580 --> 3:18:50.380]  Well, do you mean Conoco Phillips and-
[3:18:50.380 --> 3:18:53.260]  Go pull the news articles up.
[3:18:53.260 --> 3:18:56.980]  He went around to the oil companies they have big family holdings in.
[3:18:56.980 --> 3:18:59.100]  What the hell are you talking about?
[3:18:59.100 --> 3:19:01.940]  Are you saying that isn't true?
[3:19:01.940 --> 3:19:04.860]  Are you fed up with all the side effects?
[3:19:04.860 --> 3:19:10.900]  I'm out of time here and we'll do this just on the internet only on prisonplanet.tv.
[3:19:10.900 --> 3:19:13.180]  Are you there, sir?
[3:19:13.180 --> 3:19:14.180]  Are you there?
[3:19:14.180 --> 3:19:15.180]  Yeah, I'm here.
[3:19:15.180 --> 3:19:16.180]  What are you doing down in Brazil?
[3:19:16.180 --> 3:19:21.500]  I'm just traveling through right now.
[3:19:21.500 --> 3:19:22.500]  I'm in Rio.
[3:19:22.500 --> 3:19:25.300]  Okay, let me just stop you.
[3:19:25.300 --> 3:19:32.220]  When I get up on air six months ago and I say, David Rockefeller has gone to the Exxon
[3:19:32.220 --> 3:19:33.220]  Mobil board.
[3:19:33.220 --> 3:19:37.060]  He's threatening Rex Tillerson and saying they have to get on board and say carbon
[3:19:37.060 --> 3:19:38.060]  dioxide's a toxic waste.
[3:19:38.060 --> 3:19:41.700]  They have to get behind a global tax and people call me and say you're alive, there's
[3:19:41.700 --> 3:19:43.780]  no plan for a global tax and now they're announcing it.
[3:19:43.780 --> 3:19:44.780]  That was exaggeration.
[3:19:44.780 --> 3:19:45.780]  It's public.
[3:19:45.780 --> 3:19:50.060]  I remember reading he went to a bunch of the other oil companies, not all the oil companies
[3:19:50.060 --> 3:19:54.100]  as you know there's thousands but the big ones, that they have holdings in and that
[3:19:54.100 --> 3:19:58.420]  they went and put pressure on them with the Rockefeller holdings and the rest of his family.
[3:19:58.420 --> 3:20:01.460]  So of course I boil it down and say he went around to a bunch of the oil companies with
[3:20:01.460 --> 3:20:02.460]  pressure on them.
[3:20:02.460 --> 3:20:05.540]  That's admitted it's in the news, they've now buckled and done it.
[3:20:05.540 --> 3:20:07.060]  Now I mean, is there a global tax?
[3:20:07.060 --> 3:20:08.060]  Are they pushing it?
[3:20:08.060 --> 3:20:09.620]  Did the Rockefellers go put pressure?
[3:20:09.620 --> 3:20:11.500]  Are you saying that isn't true?
[3:20:11.500 --> 3:20:13.900]  No, I'm not saying that's not true.
[3:20:13.900 --> 3:20:20.900]  All I'm saying is this, would you say that you had ever exaggerated anything maybe once
[3:20:20.900 --> 3:20:21.900]  or something?
[3:20:21.900 --> 3:20:22.900]  I'm just saying that-
[3:20:22.900 --> 3:20:27.460]  No, what I've done is I've been incorrect, I get bill numbers wrong sometimes, I get
[3:20:27.460 --> 3:20:38.460]  dates wrong, I get phone numbers for sponsors out wrong, I called Chris 1, KRS 1, I reversed
[3:20:38.460 --> 3:20:39.460]  the numbers-
[3:20:39.460 --> 3:20:46.940]  Yeah, but that wasn't an exaggeration, that was me running a TV show, people talking to
[3:20:46.940 --> 3:20:49.460]  me through the window, stuff on the screen, things going on.
[3:20:49.460 --> 3:20:52.380]  Let me ask you about this, let me ask you about this.
[3:20:52.380 --> 3:20:56.660]  I mean, here's another example, no, no, no, no, let me ask you something.
[3:20:56.660 --> 3:21:01.500]  I saw a comment on Infowars.com in a story last night saying, look at Alex, I heard him
[3:21:01.500 --> 3:21:06.340]  today say thousands of people have been charged under the Patriot Act in non-terror related
[3:21:06.340 --> 3:21:10.540]  cases, and they put a link up and they said, but look at the LA Times, it says more than
[3:21:10.540 --> 3:21:12.300]  200.
[3:21:12.300 --> 3:21:15.860]  That was more than 200 on airplanes.
[3:21:15.860 --> 3:21:21.300]  I'm talking about all the articles I've seen where South Carolina, thousands, you know,
[3:21:21.300 --> 3:21:26.580]  and so of course I'm integrating that into a simple statement, and then people play
[3:21:26.580 --> 3:21:33.060]  wordsmith semantical games with it and imply that thousands haven't been charged in non-terror
[3:21:33.060 --> 3:21:36.940]  related cases under the Patriot Act and had their due process violated.
[3:21:36.940 --> 3:21:43.900]  I mean, I mean, that's not exaggeration.
[3:21:43.900 --> 3:21:51.260]  No, I love you, man, you do a hell of a job and, man, I support you 100%.
[3:21:51.260 --> 3:21:55.860]  I'm just saying that if somebody looks up something that you had said and then found
[3:21:55.860 --> 3:22:01.580]  out it was, you know, kind of a stretch or not exactly true, they might discount everything
[3:22:01.580 --> 3:22:02.580]  you're going to say.
[3:22:02.580 --> 3:22:03.580]  Let me ask you a question.
[3:22:03.580 --> 3:22:04.580]  Let me ask you a question.
[3:22:04.580 --> 3:22:09.580]  Do you believe there's a version of the U.S. code which changes every year that says what
[3:22:09.580 --> 3:22:11.820]  I said it said?
[3:22:11.820 --> 3:22:12.820]  I sure do.
[3:22:12.820 --> 3:22:13.820]  Okay, because I'm not lying to you.
[3:22:13.820 --> 3:22:15.860]  I'd be an idiot even if I was a bad person.
[3:22:15.860 --> 3:22:21.940]  Okay, but more than that, are they not announcing a world government run by the bankers?
[3:22:21.940 --> 3:22:28.540]  I mean, everything, the major issues we talk about, did it not come true like we said?
[3:22:28.540 --> 3:22:29.540]  You're right.
[3:22:29.540 --> 3:22:35.660]  Do you want to, is it like, maybe you want to say, well, you know, it's, it's, you know,
[3:22:35.660 --> 3:22:41.020]  it's helpful exaggerating a little bit to make people, you know, wake up and see it
[3:22:41.020 --> 3:22:42.700]  and everything is okay or something.
[3:22:42.700 --> 3:22:44.260]  No, I'm not exaggerating.
[3:22:44.260 --> 3:22:45.260]  What?
[3:22:45.260 --> 3:22:47.260]  Let me ask you about this.
[3:22:47.260 --> 3:22:48.260]  Okay.
[3:22:48.260 --> 3:22:52.820]  Like yesterday with the one, when you're talking to Joe Rogan and the woman on the plane with
[3:22:52.820 --> 3:22:57.420]  the two kids and the getting charged with terror and stuff, you know that one?
[3:22:57.420 --> 3:22:58.420]  Yes.
[3:22:58.420 --> 3:22:59.420]  Yeah.
[3:22:59.420 --> 3:23:05.340]  And if you kept saying, you would say she got a long prison sentence, you know, and
[3:23:05.340 --> 3:23:07.660]  yeah, we've called them.
[3:23:07.660 --> 3:23:12.780]  Now that you just, it even says it in the article, that is, that is correct.
[3:23:12.780 --> 3:23:16.300]  I was thinking of another case and I was screaming and yelling and arguing on air and I thought
[3:23:16.300 --> 3:23:18.340]  about that last night when I heard the rebroadcast.
[3:23:18.340 --> 3:23:23.260]  Now you just legitimately found, but they're trying to put her in jail for 10 years.
[3:23:23.260 --> 3:23:26.180]  That is something real because I'm yelling and screaming, arguing with Joe.
[3:23:26.180 --> 3:23:27.180]  You're right.
[3:23:27.180 --> 3:23:28.180]  So there you go.
[3:23:28.180 --> 3:23:29.180]  Hey, I got to go back live to the full audience.
[3:23:29.180 --> 3:23:30.180]  All right.
[3:23:30.180 --> 3:23:31.180]  Thank you.
[3:23:31.180 --> 3:23:32.180]  Okay.
[3:23:32.180 --> 3:23:39.420]  The point here is for those that weren't watching prison money.tv with that caller,
[3:23:39.420 --> 3:23:44.060]  he listed a bunch of things where I didn't exaggerate and then he listed something where
[3:23:44.060 --> 3:23:45.060]  I was wrong.
[3:23:45.060 --> 3:23:46.060]  And that's what I just said.
[3:23:46.060 --> 3:23:47.060]  I get things wrong.
[3:23:47.060 --> 3:23:48.060]  There's all these cases.
[3:23:48.060 --> 3:23:49.220]  I'm not on nipotent.
[3:23:49.220 --> 3:23:51.540]  I don't have all the answers.
[3:23:51.540 --> 3:23:55.860]  The issue is, are they charging people under terrorism and then restricting their rights
[3:23:55.860 --> 3:23:59.660]  and their due process in court when they swore they wouldn't use the Patriot Act except
[3:23:59.660 --> 3:24:02.220]  against Al Qaeda?
[3:24:02.220 --> 3:24:04.460]  And the answer is they are.
[3:24:04.460 --> 3:24:07.980]  And so we can play games with all of this stuff all day.
[3:24:07.980 --> 3:24:13.060]  Alex, it is, everybody acts like it's up to Alex Jones what happens in the future.
[3:24:13.060 --> 3:24:17.020]  I'm here doing the best job I can, putting my best foot forward, attempting to be as
[3:24:17.020 --> 3:24:19.100]  accurate as I can.
[3:24:19.100 --> 3:24:21.860]  And I'd say we're 95% accurate.
[3:24:21.860 --> 3:24:27.820]  Whereas the mainstream media generally has an agenda or is trying to spin, look, what
[3:24:27.820 --> 3:24:32.380]  you take away from here is what you want to take away from it.
[3:24:32.380 --> 3:24:39.100]  What you go do about this is your issue.
[3:24:39.100 --> 3:24:42.940]  I know stuff's scary and a lot of people subconsciously don't want this to be real or this to be
[3:24:42.940 --> 3:24:45.700]  happening.
[3:24:45.700 --> 3:24:48.300]  Believe me, all the time I lay in bed thinking, this can't be this bad.
[3:24:48.300 --> 3:24:49.300]  This can't be real.
[3:24:49.300 --> 3:24:52.020]  You know, this can't be going on.
[3:24:52.020 --> 3:24:54.220]  But it is.
[3:24:54.220 --> 3:24:57.740]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[3:24:57.740 --> 3:25:00.140]  Let's go ahead and talk to Patrick in Canada.
[3:25:00.140 --> 3:25:01.860]  Patrick, you're on the air.
[3:25:01.860 --> 3:25:02.860]  Welcome.
[3:25:02.860 --> 3:25:03.860]  How are you doing, Alex?
[3:25:03.860 --> 3:25:04.860]  Good, sir.
[3:25:04.860 --> 3:25:05.860]  Good.
[3:25:05.860 --> 3:25:07.900]  First of all, I'd like to address one thing that I don't really hear addressed too often
[3:25:07.900 --> 3:25:12.540]  on your shows that I really appreciate your sarcasm and your wit fits in perfectly with
[3:25:12.540 --> 3:25:14.420]  the subject matter of the show.
[3:25:14.420 --> 3:25:18.460]  Definitely lightens things up at all the right times, but I'm calling to discuss something
[3:25:18.460 --> 3:25:20.980]  of a little more serious nature.
[3:25:20.980 --> 3:25:27.700]  In Toronto, Canada, we have a radio personality who you're familiar with, Richard Serret.
[3:25:27.700 --> 3:25:30.620]  You've been on a show numerous times over the past few years.
[3:25:30.620 --> 3:25:31.620]  Probably not.
[3:25:31.620 --> 3:25:38.220]  Yeah, he was actually fired on Tuesday afternoon by Astral Media, who's a giant media conglomerate
[3:25:38.220 --> 3:25:40.780]  controlled media up here in Canada.
[3:25:40.780 --> 3:25:43.620]  There's been no mention as to why he was fired.
[3:25:43.620 --> 3:25:49.460]  They try to use the excuse of a softening economy yet in the last fiscal year, they've
[3:25:49.460 --> 3:25:54.420]  been making record profits, and the show has been under continual growth and expansion
[3:25:54.420 --> 3:25:56.300]  since he's come on board.
[3:25:56.300 --> 3:26:01.220]  And basically, I just wanted to let the Canadian listeners, because I know you've got tons,
[3:26:01.220 --> 3:26:07.540]  that we're going to be rallying outside the CFRB radio station this coming Monday between
[3:26:07.540 --> 3:26:13.500]  11 a.m. and 2 p.m. to protest the firing of Richard Serret, and this is a lot more than
[3:26:13.500 --> 3:26:15.540]  just one individual losing a paycheck.
[3:26:15.540 --> 3:26:17.060]  This is about preserving our access.
[3:26:17.060 --> 3:26:19.940]  Yeah, that's in Toronto, and he was on what?
[3:26:19.940 --> 3:26:21.340]  Five nights a week.
[3:26:21.340 --> 3:26:25.620]  It started out as four nights with two hours, went to five nights, three hours, and then
[3:26:25.620 --> 3:26:27.780]  they did a best of on Sundays for an hour.
[3:26:27.780 --> 3:26:33.780]  So, you know, it's not due to a lack of listenership, and this is about preserving our access to
[3:26:33.780 --> 3:26:36.580]  truthfulness and openness on the airwaves here in Canada.
[3:26:36.580 --> 3:26:40.220]  Well, let's call Richard Serret up and maybe get him on next week.
[3:26:40.220 --> 3:26:41.620]  This is the first I've heard of this.
[3:26:41.620 --> 3:26:47.140]  I've got to confirm it, but I mean, I believe you, but CFRB, that's the oldest radio station
[3:26:47.140 --> 3:26:48.540]  in Canada, isn't it?
[3:26:48.540 --> 3:26:53.980]  I believe so, and we actually have done the Canadian theatrical premieres of Endgame and
[3:26:53.980 --> 3:27:00.500]  Truth Rising here in Toronto, both received fantastic reception, so this is something
[3:27:00.500 --> 3:27:01.500]  serious.
[3:27:01.500 --> 3:27:06.140]  I mean, you guys in America can look up here to Canada and see what's going on with media
[3:27:06.140 --> 3:27:10.260]  censorship and take note, because there's much more consolidation up here than there
[3:27:10.260 --> 3:27:17.060]  is in the United States, and with all that's anticipated to come down the route in 2009,
[3:27:17.060 --> 3:27:21.540]  the best way to have people swallow it with a teaspoon of sugar is to remove anybody that's
[3:27:21.540 --> 3:27:22.540]  objecting it.
[3:27:22.540 --> 3:27:26.180]  And Richard was pretty much the only source that we had for this type of information.
[3:27:26.180 --> 3:27:27.180]  Absolutely.
[3:27:27.180 --> 3:27:28.680]  I appreciate your call.
[3:27:28.680 --> 3:27:35.900]  You know, the guys just pulled up US Code Title 30, but that's his Title 45 code on
[3:27:35.900 --> 3:27:40.940]  federal, the informed consent requirements in this policy are not intended for the purpose
[3:27:40.940 --> 3:27:46.460]  of research and development, so I've got to click on this and go find it, but I mean,
[3:27:46.460 --> 3:27:49.020]  I just can't keep track of it all anymore.
[3:27:49.020 --> 3:27:53.820]  You know, like I've got, like when I say he's on five days a week, he goes, well, he's
[3:27:53.820 --> 3:27:58.460]  on four days, and then on the weekend, as well, say, oh, that's not five, that's four,
[3:27:58.460 --> 3:27:59.460]  you know, you're exaggerating.
[3:27:59.460 --> 3:28:00.460]  Hell, I don't know.
[3:28:00.460 --> 3:28:02.380]  I've been on weekdays on the guy's show.
[3:28:02.380 --> 3:28:03.380]  Weeknights is all I know.
[3:28:03.380 --> 3:28:11.580]  I mean, the thing is, I can't keep track of all the info anymore, but I'm trying to
[3:28:11.580 --> 3:28:12.580]  find US Code.
[3:28:12.580 --> 3:28:16.740]  See, it will take me 10 minutes to do that, and I just can't do it while I'm on air,
[3:28:16.740 --> 3:28:18.420]  but I want to go pull that up and do that.
[3:28:18.420 --> 3:28:23.100]  Maybe the guy's in the prisonplanet.com forum can find that and post all that.
[3:28:23.100 --> 3:28:25.300]  I mean, this is unbelievable stuff.
[3:28:25.300 --> 3:28:30.340]  It's like that Oregon bill they had where it said, life in prison or you consent 25
[3:28:30.340 --> 3:28:31.780]  years in a forest labor camp.
[3:28:31.780 --> 3:28:33.980]  I mean, who comes up with this stuff?
[3:28:33.980 --> 3:28:37.180]  I mean, that's in the bill.
[3:28:37.180 --> 3:28:38.180]  Or I guess everything's fine.
[3:28:38.180 --> 3:28:39.700]  They're in the police state.
[3:28:39.700 --> 3:28:40.700]  Everything's going wonderful.
[3:28:40.700 --> 3:28:43.780]  The NSA isn't spying on us, and everything's good.
[3:28:43.780 --> 3:28:46.060]  I remember always being told, you're exaggerating.
[3:28:46.060 --> 3:28:47.900]  The NSA isn't spying on everybody.
[3:28:47.900 --> 3:28:48.900]  Now they admit they are.
[3:28:48.900 --> 3:28:49.900]  Stay with us, folks.
[3:28:49.900 --> 3:28:52.380]  We'll be right back.
[3:28:52.380 --> 3:28:53.660]  We're on the march.
[3:28:53.660 --> 3:28:56.060]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:28:56.060 --> 3:29:02.540]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:29:02.540 --> 3:29:06.020]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[3:29:06.020 --> 3:29:09.900]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[3:29:09.900 --> 3:29:11.500]  than when drinking the water?
[3:29:11.500 --> 3:29:15.340]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[3:29:15.340 --> 3:29:16.500]  into the skin.
[3:29:16.500 --> 3:29:21.180]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to
[3:29:21.180 --> 3:29:26.700]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[3:29:26.700 --> 3:29:28.020]  algae, and fungus.
[3:29:28.020 --> 3:29:32.900]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever
[3:29:32.900 --> 3:29:33.900]  comes first.
[3:29:33.900 --> 3:29:38.100]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:29:38.100 --> 3:29:40.140]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[3:29:40.140 --> 3:29:41.140]  What about you?

[3:30:00.540 --> 3:30:07.500]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[3:30:07.500 --> 3:30:08.500]  this country.
[3:30:08.500 --> 3:30:12.420]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[3:30:12.420 --> 3:30:13.420]  Bin Laden.
[3:30:13.420 --> 3:30:14.420]  This is his MO.
[3:30:14.420 --> 3:30:18.020]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:30:18.020 --> 3:30:22.620]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:30:22.620 --> 3:30:25.180]  networks inside the United States.
[3:30:25.180 --> 3:30:29.660]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:30:29.660 --> 3:30:31.820]  in and on the U.S.
[3:30:31.820 --> 3:30:35.580]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:30:35.580 --> 3:30:40.980]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:30:40.980 --> 3:30:44.980]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[3:30:44.980 --> 3:30:45.980]  much more.

[3:32:28.900 --> 3:32:47.900]  Okay, I found US Code Title 50 Chapter 32 Subsection 1520A during the break, but I found it during
[3:32:47.900 --> 3:32:48.900]  the break.
[3:32:48.900 --> 3:32:54.620]  Now I'm trying to read it and just scanning over in the last 10 seconds, I believe it says
[3:32:54.620 --> 3:32:58.140]  right here, exceptions to when they can do this testing on you.
[3:32:58.140 --> 3:33:02.100]  Now keep zooming in on this, because I mean we're just people, we're here, I know there's
[3:33:02.100 --> 3:33:04.300]  been a version of this because it's been on national news.
[3:33:04.300 --> 3:33:11.180]  In fact, John, there's a clip of it, you grabbed off the news in that Walter Cronkite clip
[3:33:11.180 --> 3:33:14.860]  you play where they go, you know, they didn't tell the public, they were experimenting on
[3:33:14.860 --> 3:33:15.860]  them.
[3:33:15.860 --> 3:33:19.620]  There, we put it on screen for people and we're going to go to our next many guests.
[3:33:19.620 --> 3:33:28.460]  The US Code Title 50 Chapter 32 Subsection 1520A, and I'm going to look find B, that's
[3:33:28.460 --> 3:33:29.460]  where it's at.
[3:33:29.460 --> 3:33:33.100]  Of this subsection only of informed consent, the testing was obtained from each human subject
[3:33:33.100 --> 3:33:35.740]  in advance of the testing on that subject.
[3:33:35.740 --> 3:33:40.180]  Okay, a peaceful purpose that is related to the medical therapeutic pharmacological
[3:33:40.180 --> 3:33:44.360]  agriculture industrial research activity, any purposes directly related to the production
[3:33:44.360 --> 3:33:48.660]  against toxic chemicals, any law enforcement purposes including any purposes related to
[3:33:48.660 --> 3:33:50.700]  riot control.
[3:33:50.700 --> 3:33:59.460]  And it's saying that exception subject to subsection CBE of the section, the prohibition
[3:33:59.460 --> 3:34:03.780]  and subsection of the section is not applied to the test or experiment carried out for
[3:34:03.780 --> 3:34:07.900]  any of the following purposes, well there it is.
[3:34:07.900 --> 3:34:12.260]  I mean I've had top constitutional lawyers on a decade ago about this, I mean I've made
[3:34:12.260 --> 3:34:17.620]  major hay of this and I'm just now looking at it again after years and it's saying that
[3:34:17.620 --> 3:34:23.860]  there's exemptions, they don't have to give conformed consent, guys you're in there reading
[3:34:23.860 --> 3:34:26.380]  it, does it not say that?
[3:34:26.380 --> 3:34:31.740]  I mean how, now maybe he's on another area of the US Code and it's changed or something
[3:34:31.740 --> 3:34:38.940]  but US Code Title 50 Chapter 32 Subsection 1520A, Secretary of Defense may not conduct
[3:34:38.940 --> 3:34:43.820]  directly or by contract any test experiment involving the use of chemical laser or biological
[3:34:43.820 --> 3:34:46.940]  laser on a civilian population or any of the testing of chemical laser, biological laser
[3:34:46.940 --> 3:34:55.180]  on human subjects, B exceptions, the subject to subsection CBE of the section, the prohibition
[3:34:55.180 --> 3:34:59.740]  and subsection of the section is not applied to a test experiment carried out for any of
[3:34:59.740 --> 3:35:02.660]  the following purposes.
[3:35:02.660 --> 3:35:11.140]  So it's saying exception of subjects, CBE to the section, the prohibition in subsection
[3:35:11.140 --> 3:35:15.020]  of the subsection is not applied to a test experiment carried out for any of the following
[3:35:15.020 --> 3:35:23.060]  purposes and the way the law scholars read that is it's saying that then for these exceptions
[3:35:23.060 --> 3:35:26.700]  you can do it, any peaceful purpose that is related to medical, therapeutic, pharmacological,
[3:35:26.700 --> 3:35:31.060]  agriculture, industrial, research, activity, any purpose that is directly related to production
[3:35:31.060 --> 3:35:34.900]  against toxic chemicals or biological weapons and agents, any law enforcement purposes including
[3:35:34.900 --> 3:35:42.700]  any related to riot control and then they add informed consent required in a subsection
[3:35:42.700 --> 3:35:47.340]  over C but I don't know what that means, the Secretary of Defense make a ducted test experiment
[3:35:47.340 --> 3:35:52.660]  described in subsection of this section only of informed consent but that's saying of this
[3:35:52.660 --> 3:35:58.260]  section but then they give the sections above it so that's a lawyer trick there and then
[3:35:58.260 --> 3:36:01.540]  you know they do it without informed consent every day so what do you talk, I mean there
[3:36:01.540 --> 3:36:02.540]  it is.
[3:36:02.540 --> 3:36:07.340]  Of this section only informed consent to be testing was obtained from each human subject
[3:36:07.340 --> 3:36:13.420]  in the advance of the testing on them so there it is we're just reading that differently
[3:36:13.420 --> 3:36:20.980]  sir I'll just have a constitutional law scholar on back about it, I mean they do all this
[3:36:20.980 --> 3:36:29.180]  uninformed testing I mean they do it all the time it comes out I mean it's there so I don't
[3:36:29.180 --> 3:36:34.300]  know what the debate is let's go to Steve Shank I haven't had him on in a few weeks
[3:36:34.300 --> 3:36:38.820]  and to give us a report on what's going on worldwide, you know my biggest reason Steve
[3:36:38.820 --> 3:36:44.660]  all along has not been food shortages or things like that caused by drought or any problems,
[3:36:44.660 --> 3:36:48.960]  my problem and the reason I told folks historical foods is the depression situation to buy bulk
[3:36:48.960 --> 3:36:54.420]  food before they inflate the currency or the depression sets in and I've really been excited
[3:36:54.420 --> 3:37:03.140]  to hear these ads you're running on the network for the, what is it the three day responder
[3:37:03.140 --> 3:37:09.060]  is for twenty one bucks a multi-day, well let me give us the specifics I've only heard
[3:37:09.060 --> 3:37:11.540]  the ad twice what exactly is this new offer?
[3:37:11.540 --> 3:37:19.940]  Well what it is is it's a three day pack it comes in a little box it's four inches by
[3:37:19.940 --> 3:37:25.180]  eight inches by eleven inches so it's just a nice little package it's got four meals
[3:37:25.180 --> 3:37:33.100]  a day for three days in that rascal and they're all add water heat and go for it it's in
[3:37:33.100 --> 3:37:38.980]  intended to be something that people can throw in the back of a car and they got three days
[3:37:38.980 --> 3:37:46.020]  worth of food all they do is add water and eat it it's intended right now you know Alex
[3:37:46.020 --> 3:37:51.980]  that I've said before that close to forty percent of our population now when they go
[3:37:51.980 --> 3:37:59.340]  to the grocery store is very simply having to make the decision between buying food
[3:37:59.340 --> 3:38:03.100]  and paying their other bills or less now in the news I mean that's what's been happening
[3:38:03.100 --> 3:38:08.580]  for months but it's getting worse I know it's getting worse and some information that we
[3:38:08.580 --> 3:38:16.140]  just we just got from a big article a lot of the biggest farms in the country are pulling
[3:38:16.140 --> 3:38:24.220]  back on planting because the banks are requiring them now before they'll give them loans to
[3:38:24.220 --> 3:38:31.580]  prove that they have water available the huge water districts in California are putting
[3:38:31.580 --> 3:38:38.140]  out notices that they might they might lower the amount of water available to farmers to
[3:38:38.140 --> 3:38:44.740]  zero percent zero that means they're going to have to depend on wells which won't even
[3:38:44.740 --> 3:38:49.420]  do the job so the farmers aren't even planning but they can't get the money to plant and
[3:38:49.420 --> 3:38:57.500]  so back to the food shortage right now families need to get their food supplies in so that
[3:38:57.500 --> 3:39:04.060]  they actually have food that's available now this little three-day pack is the result of
[3:39:04.060 --> 3:39:10.860]  something very interesting Alex and that is two things a lot of people are hesitant they've
[3:39:10.860 --> 3:39:15.900]  never dealt with the old dried food before so what we did was we put we originally were
[3:39:15.900 --> 3:39:21.140]  going to put together just a little sample pack but then all this issue of people not
[3:39:21.140 --> 3:39:25.180]  being able to afford food and you got to realize that all of this food that eat foods direct
[3:39:25.180 --> 3:39:32.700]  is handling cost wise is coming in about half the cost of last year's groceries for people
[3:39:32.700 --> 3:39:37.300]  and so what we decided to do is put something together that number one people could actually
[3:39:37.300 --> 3:39:43.780]  buy for emergency grab and goes number two some people will actually be living on them
[3:39:43.780 --> 3:39:48.540]  because it's cheaper than groceries number three it's something that that parents can
[3:39:48.540 --> 3:39:52.980]  send away to their kids at college and give them three days to get home on and number
[3:39:52.980 --> 3:39:59.500]  four a lot of people will pick these up try them and once they discovered that the food
[3:39:59.500 --> 3:40:04.660]  is absolutely wonderful then they'll be comfortable with with getting in their two three four
[3:40:04.660 --> 3:40:11.380]  year supplies so it is a great test people should buy a few of them to save but also
[3:40:11.380 --> 3:40:18.340]  buy one and test it out at eFoodsDirect.com yeah absolutely now there's a there's an
[3:40:18.340 --> 3:40:25.940]  issue that I need to cover with you that your listeners need to be aware of why 2k there
[3:40:25.940 --> 3:40:31.180]  are a bunch of questionable characters that jumped into the food business because that
[3:40:31.180 --> 3:40:38.020]  is something that that opportunists see right now as being a great profit center now you
[3:40:38.020 --> 3:40:43.260]  know we've been at this for a long time when when it wasn't popular but right now I need
[3:40:43.260 --> 3:40:48.260]  to tell your listeners something there is there are quite a few of the organizations
[3:40:48.260 --> 3:40:54.340]  that were very questionable reputation wise that have now hopped into the food business
[3:40:54.340 --> 3:40:58.660]  and they are perfectly happy to take your money and leave you with a food supply that
[3:40:58.660 --> 3:41:04.620]  you cannot live on an offer that we're making Alex and we're putting this up on the website
[3:41:04.620 --> 3:41:10.260]  and I'm going to put together a couple of one minute spots to telling people this if
[3:41:10.260 --> 3:41:14.900]  as you're looking at the confusion that's created by huge numbers of people jumping
[3:41:14.900 --> 3:41:23.980]  on this bandwagon of food if you're confused by it there's a simple remedy go to eFoodsDirect.com
[3:41:23.980 --> 3:41:29.740]  and we've placed in a statement up there that if you find any of these any of these
[3:41:29.740 --> 3:41:35.460]  supplies of food these one year supplies of food that you think are a better combination
[3:41:35.460 --> 3:41:42.300]  or a better price or a better value to you please contact us compare with what we've
[3:41:42.300 --> 3:41:48.980]  got up on the website and we will offer you this promise if you're willing to take the
[3:41:48.980 --> 3:41:54.340]  combination of food that they're putting in at these cheap prices and these goofy combinations
[3:41:54.340 --> 3:41:59.620]  if you're willing to take that we will build it for you ourselves and charge you at least
[3:41:59.620 --> 3:42:03.500]  a hundred dollars less per one year supply than what they're advertising.
[3:42:03.500 --> 3:42:10.460]  So you're saying you will offer less than anybody out there offer basically and I know
[3:42:10.460 --> 3:42:15.860]  the stuff that goes on people sell 10, 15 year old, 20 year old food saying it's new
[3:42:15.860 --> 3:42:19.700]  you guys for those that don't know have your own factory the food people are getting you
[3:42:19.700 --> 3:42:24.420]  got in the last few weeks or last few months you're packaging it canning making yourself
[3:42:24.420 --> 3:42:29.980]  non GMO everything from right here in the U.S. except for your bananas and the reason you're
[3:42:29.980 --> 3:42:32.980]  our sponsor is I did the research and you're the place we went to I bought some other stuff
[3:42:32.980 --> 3:42:38.020]  years ago and it was full of MSG and vegetable protein and all this other stuff and and and
[3:42:38.020 --> 3:42:42.460]  I mean you guys will have really high quality food and that's why you're here that's you
[3:42:42.460 --> 3:42:45.420]  have a really a plus you have a really good price go ahead.
[3:42:45.420 --> 3:42:49.860]  Well and the and the other thing is the combination of food I mean you fill up a bunch of cans
[3:42:49.860 --> 3:42:58.180]  with with the wheat and beans and maybe five cans of vegetables for a for a for you know
[3:42:58.180 --> 3:43:02.820]  for adult family and it's just a terrible combination of bad food supplies worth the
[3:43:02.820 --> 3:43:06.260]  no food supply because people depend on it and then when they have to use it they can't
[3:43:06.260 --> 3:43:07.260]  live on it.
[3:43:07.260 --> 3:43:08.260]  Well they've done studies.
[3:43:08.260 --> 3:43:09.260]  And that's what we're trying to avoid.
[3:43:09.260 --> 3:43:13.740]  Well they've done studies and the name escapes me what is that palate fatigue we're eating
[3:43:13.740 --> 3:43:18.660]  the same thing you you just really have trouble eating it and you don't even absorb it.
[3:43:18.660 --> 3:43:26.060]  What's that goes in absolutely and kids particularly will do that but even still the confusion
[3:43:26.060 --> 3:43:30.300]  that people have we've had we've had calls every day with some of these from some of
[3:43:30.300 --> 3:43:35.780]  these folks that that think that some of these specials and stuff as us because you your
[3:43:35.780 --> 3:43:43.700]  organization and GCN has been been become so you know similar to to what we're doing
[3:43:43.700 --> 3:43:47.700]  we're kind of walking in lockstep and so there's other shows on the network others
[3:43:47.700 --> 3:43:53.940]  add but I am yeah and so the main thing that I need to tell folks is go ahead and shop
[3:43:53.940 --> 3:43:58.140]  around and when you find something you think is cool get back in touch with the food's
[3:43:58.140 --> 3:44:03.500]  direct and we'll show you what the problems are with it but if you still want that stuff
[3:44:03.500 --> 3:44:08.660]  we'll put it together only with stuff that you can trust and we'll charge you at least
[3:44:08.660 --> 3:44:13.140]  a hundred dollars less if if they're really ripping you off we'll charge you the difference
[3:44:13.140 --> 3:44:20.340]  and and and let's just make the savings chances are they won't go with that but it's a promise
[3:44:20.340 --> 3:44:25.060]  we want to guarantee people at least they get good food even if they got the wrong combination
[3:44:25.060 --> 3:44:29.100]  don't get ripped off and don't let people take their money again or eight hundred four
[3:44:29.100 --> 3:44:32.580]  oh nine five six three three well let's just say you guys have got a great deal I mean
[3:44:32.580 --> 3:44:37.300]  I'll I'll I'll just put it that way again give folks the toll free number who could
[3:44:37.300 --> 3:44:42.980]  so they can call and get a free brochure or get the responder pack that sounds good
[3:44:42.980 --> 3:44:48.180]  it's eight hundred four zero nine five six three three eight hundred four zero nine
[3:44:48.180 --> 3:44:54.860]  five six three three it's it's it's critical times Alex and what we're hoping with these
[3:44:54.860 --> 3:45:00.700]  little three-day packs we can get people jump started and a lot of folks that really can't
[3:45:00.700 --> 3:45:04.940]  afford food or are hopping on these we had three calls yesterday from people that are
[3:45:04.940 --> 3:45:13.140]  living on the two months supply right now and so it's just no when you told people here
[3:45:13.140 --> 3:45:17.700]  at fourteen months ago we're having depression you were lying everything's wonderful we've
[3:45:17.700 --> 3:45:21.740]  got your website e-foods direct the letter e-foods direct dot com up on the screen for
[3:45:21.740 --> 3:45:26.940]  those that are watching prison planet dot tv twenty one ninety five that shows all those
[3:45:26.940 --> 3:45:32.420]  containers of food three-day responder I'm guessing that's at cost or below it for you
[3:45:32.420 --> 3:45:38.540]  Steve it's absolutely it's introductory it's trying to help people to get jump started
[3:45:38.540 --> 3:45:44.220]  and get going and for those of those of those that are in real trouble financially it's
[3:45:44.220 --> 3:45:48.540]  a leg up for some food and for ninety nine ninety five I see you have a three-day responder
[3:45:48.540 --> 3:45:55.260]  five pack yeah and then that's for ninety nine ninety five how much more inexpensive
[3:45:55.260 --> 3:46:00.580]  is this if one person tried to eat for three days at the grocery store even on cheap stuff
[3:46:00.580 --> 3:46:06.700]  oh it's probably about half or or less but uh... are you can't love a bread and some
[3:46:06.700 --> 3:46:12.900]  bologna and and and and i mean it's like ten bucks and you try to go get i know i mean
[3:46:12.900 --> 3:46:16.580]  i don't know how people come up i guess you guys just buying such bulk you're able to
[3:46:16.580 --> 3:46:21.020]  do it eight hundred four oh nine five six three three eight hundred four oh nine five six
[3:46:21.020 --> 3:46:25.620]  three three and this is where uh... you know over the years i bought a few different packages
[3:46:25.620 --> 3:46:29.620]  storeable foods never really liked what i got and i finally ran into the j michael stevens
[3:46:29.620 --> 3:46:33.100]  group because i thought they were the biggest the longest generally operating and you know
[3:46:33.100 --> 3:46:38.980]  the big guys that advertise nationally who care about their name and uh... so i got
[3:46:38.980 --> 3:46:43.940]  them as a sponsor at years after buying their food and uh... again i've got food i bought
[3:46:43.940 --> 3:46:48.100]  from eight years ago that i gave to family i bought new packages to give it to family
[3:46:48.100 --> 3:46:52.420]  uh... you know i just got more food from you a few months ago uh... so i hate to even
[3:46:52.420 --> 3:46:56.580]  mention that was everybody's starving that will come to my house but uh... we do have
[3:46:56.580 --> 3:47:00.740]  the boom booms to protect the food but i mean we hope none of this happens we hope it doesn't
[3:47:00.740 --> 3:47:05.880]  get this bad but it already is where people are losing their jobs by what is it five hundred
[3:47:05.880 --> 3:47:10.500]  thousand a month on average you have millions of aggregate uh... i mean things are getting
[3:47:10.500 --> 3:47:14.860]  really serious eight hundred four oh nine five six three three before they devalue the
[3:47:14.860 --> 3:47:19.780]  currency on top of the depression the uh... hyper stag inflation we're going into that
[3:47:19.780 --> 3:47:23.460]  the economist and experts we've had on or say we're going into a rdn you know the first
[3:47:23.460 --> 3:47:28.980]  level of uh... give them a call folks while the f rn still have value and again it's
[3:47:28.980 --> 3:47:32.500]  not just that it's a great sponsor that gives you a great deal this show is made possible
[3:47:32.500 --> 3:47:37.060]  by this and i got three guys out there in the show right now i got a staff we're making
[3:47:37.060 --> 3:47:40.780]  films were fighting the new world order and it is you the radio listeners that are funding
[3:47:40.780 --> 3:47:46.220]  the operation to resist but while you do that we also give you access to sponsors i believe
[3:47:46.220 --> 3:47:51.060]  in so you hear me in dorsal sponsor it means i've checked it out and i believe in it and
[3:47:51.060 --> 3:47:55.420]  uh... i just want to make that clear so again uh... eight hundred give folks that number
[3:47:55.420 --> 3:48:01.420]  again steve eight hundred four zero nine five six three three eight hundred four oh nine

[3:48:11.420 --> 3:48:16.460]  well the main thing that i'm seeing and uh... i've seen some things that i predicted that
[3:48:16.460 --> 3:48:22.500]  that you know it did come about is that it's entirely possible that uh... the folks that
[3:48:22.500 --> 3:48:28.300]  are freezing up and saying we don't dare spend anything now because of all the job loss around
[3:48:28.300 --> 3:48:33.100]  they must get off of that frozen state and put in food because that is going to be the
[3:48:33.100 --> 3:48:36.780]  determinant as to whether they're going to maintain their liberties in the next three
[3:48:36.780 --> 3:48:38.780]  to four months

[3:48:57.620 --> 3:49:00.900]  i'm hoping he's wrong i'm not saying this is going to happen
[3:49:00.900 --> 3:49:03.700]  uh... but uh... the globalist uh...
[3:49:03.700 --> 3:49:06.180]  obama sing it ready for something unpopular

[3:53:22.940 --> 3:53:28.540]  nicolette in ohio thanks for holding your trooper welcome to the airwaves
[3:53:28.540 --> 3:53:33.700]  time okay i got a couple of comments first i want to say thank you for your
[3:53:33.700 --> 3:53:38.540]  show man i mean i've never had so much information in for those callers that
[3:53:38.540 --> 3:53:43.020]  say that you're making mistakes i just want them to understand that they have
[3:53:43.020 --> 3:53:48.340]  to do their research as well first thing a lot of people think i'm crazy but if
[3:53:48.340 --> 3:53:53.780]  you're out here single and you're living in on meager means and you have a good
[3:53:53.780 --> 3:53:59.820]  job then kind of think about what's going on so first the cuba embargo i had a
[3:53:59.820 --> 3:54:04.100]  couple of questions about that i'm not really familiar with the terms or what
[3:54:04.100 --> 3:54:08.220]  happened in the history in cuba so i'd like you to reiterate on that for me as
[3:54:08.220 --> 3:54:14.540]  well as some of the list and well i mean fidel Castro was a cia operative
[3:54:14.540 --> 3:54:17.900]  because they thought they could use him to take over and kick out kind of the
[3:54:17.900 --> 3:54:22.380]  old money elite that were there but then he double-crossed them at least they
[3:54:22.380 --> 3:54:26.220]  claim and so they clamped down the island and don't let the u.s. persons
[3:54:26.220 --> 3:54:31.020]  travel there and you know don't like Cuban cigars or rum or sugar anything
[3:54:31.020 --> 3:54:35.940]  else into the united states and now fidel is getting ready to die and raul's in
[3:54:35.940 --> 3:54:40.220]  command his brother and i don't like our government i don't like particularly
[3:54:40.220 --> 3:54:44.340]  things they've done either but i think the way to reform cuba if they'd have
[3:54:44.340 --> 3:54:47.780]  opened it up 30 40 years ago that place would be nothing but hotels again and
[3:54:47.780 --> 3:54:51.180]  people thought in the sun it wouldn't be communist there's no way all the money
[3:54:51.180 --> 3:54:54.620]  and wealth of the of this country and people wanting to go there because it's
[3:54:54.620 --> 3:54:57.860]  nice i've been told you know and it's it's 90 miles i mean you're talking
[3:54:57.860 --> 3:55:02.460]  about the the Caribbean 90 miles away from florida you can get you know it's
[3:55:02.460 --> 3:55:06.420]  90 miles away who's he's looking at me not believing it really is i just i mean
[3:55:06.420 --> 3:55:10.220]  i would love to go there i'd love it not you know a hour and a half flight from
[3:55:10.220 --> 3:55:14.580]  houston i'd love to you know it you know a hundred dollar flight down there for
[3:55:14.580 --> 3:55:18.900]  the weekend yeah that's what would cost us where it is to florida you know from
[3:55:18.900 --> 3:55:22.380]  texas i would go there and then you know from the sun i love that's what i love
[3:55:22.380 --> 3:55:23.580]  the sun
[3:55:23.580 --> 3:55:24.780]  can't do it
[3:55:24.780 --> 3:55:29.620]  uh... and uh... so fidel by them clamping down on him
[3:55:29.620 --> 3:55:33.140]  that allowed his communism in control to stay in place that's my take on a
[3:55:33.140 --> 3:55:34.540]  nicolette
[3:55:34.540 --> 3:55:36.820]  okay another another quick thing uh...
[3:55:36.820 --> 3:55:40.140]  i was on the phone the other day trying to call nine one one and and this is a
[3:55:40.140 --> 3:55:42.340]  pretty weird
[3:55:42.340 --> 3:55:45.180]  uh... my neighbors downstairs i don't know what they do
[3:55:45.180 --> 3:55:46.660]  uh... but all i know
[3:55:46.660 --> 3:55:49.220]  they were slamming doors so hard that the keys are falling down hard to one
[3:55:49.220 --> 3:55:53.020]  screaming stuff and and sky arguing with them
[3:55:53.020 --> 3:55:55.060]  i called nine one one and
[3:55:55.060 --> 3:55:57.700]  i'd get this receptionist nine one one
[3:55:57.700 --> 3:56:01.860]  uh... what is uh... you're sitting state and i think we've been ohio
[3:56:01.860 --> 3:56:04.980]  and then they say name and phone number please and i said i'd rather keep that
[3:56:04.980 --> 3:56:05.780]  private
[3:56:05.780 --> 3:56:08.620]  and they kept asking me over and over again it sounds kind of like a robotic
[3:56:08.620 --> 3:56:11.340]  voice but i've heard a person at the same time
[3:56:11.340 --> 3:56:12.500]  i kept reiterating
[3:56:12.500 --> 3:56:14.700]  i don't want to give out my information
[3:56:14.700 --> 3:56:18.220]  so until you know they already knew it they already knew it off your phone
[3:56:18.220 --> 3:56:21.220]  number you're calling from one of your phones you pay for
[3:56:21.220 --> 3:56:24.700]  yeah they're gonna federalize nine one one there they've they've talked about
[3:56:24.700 --> 3:56:25.740]  doing that
[3:56:25.740 --> 3:56:29.420]  with these threat fusion centers these emergency management centers
[3:56:29.420 --> 3:56:32.140]  these threat integration center's a different names for them but it's all
[3:56:32.140 --> 3:56:35.420]  little federalized nodes i gotta let you go right of time
[3:56:35.420 --> 3:56:37.740]  and like ten colors here i want to go to
[3:56:37.740 --> 3:56:40.940]  you know i'm reading this u.s code this was pointed out to me by constitutional
[3:56:40.940 --> 3:56:42.820]  lawyers years ago
[3:56:42.820 --> 3:56:46.620]  and it's saying that there are exceptions
[3:56:46.620 --> 3:56:50.020]  subject to subsection cd and e
[3:56:50.020 --> 3:56:51.860]  so they're saying there's an exception
[3:56:51.860 --> 3:56:54.980]  to inform consent for any peaceful purposes related to medical
[3:56:54.980 --> 3:56:57.020]  therapeutic
