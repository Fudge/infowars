[00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:10.350]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.931]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:13.852]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:17.695]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:21.959]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:29.424]  Well, we're going to have another jam-packed radio broadcast today.
[00:00:29.424 --> 00:00:31.526]  It is Friday, the 12th day of November 2010.
[00:00:35.373 --> 00:00:39.655]  Coming up, we've got Wayne Madsen joining us for 30 minutes.
[00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:43.117]  He's got the headline, it's up at InfoWars.com.
[00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:47.959]  Wayne Madsen, China-fired missile seen in Southern California.
[00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:52.461]  We really respect Wayne and his analysis and breakdown.
[00:00:52.461 --> 00:01:00.085]  Others are saying that they've gone and looked at basically FAA documents where the Navy files
[00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:01.225]  I don't know.
[00:01:31.545 --> 00:01:44.688]  Obviously, the whole naked body scanner, TSA, molestation, pat-down, has gone into supernova when you talk about it being one of the biggest stories in the world right now.
[00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:50.689]  And at the very forefront of that is InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and the Drudge Report.
[00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.751]  It is the Drudge Report that has driven this the last two weeks to be the firestorm it is now today.
[00:01:59.477 --> 00:02:03.200]  I told you this years ago that the naked body scanners are getting a biometric reading of your body.
[00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:30.008]  Wired Magazine then reported they are coming out with cameras on street poles that can look through your clothes, just like they can face scan you, retina scan you, thumb scan you, hand scan you, finger scan you, voice print scan you.
[00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:31.608]  They can get biometrics off of any of this.
[00:02:31.608 --> 00:02:32.909]  It's all individual.
[00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.930]  But the best way is to have a whole body scan.
[00:02:36.392 --> 00:02:38.714]  Now it's in Market Watch.
[00:02:38.714 --> 00:02:41.476]  I guess that's the division of News Corp.
[00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:44.158]  Just a little blurb yesterday that a listener emailed us.
[00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:45.378]  Very thankful for that.
[00:02:45.378 --> 00:02:48.140]  Naked body scanners to store biometrics.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.401]  Kurt Nemo.
[00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:51.803]  Infowars.com.
[00:02:51.803 --> 00:02:57.106]  I think this is a report that Drudge really ought to look into, even if it doesn't link to our story, to the Market Watch article.
[00:02:58.087 --> 00:02:59.128]  Dealing with this.
[00:02:59.128 --> 00:03:01.109]  This is a big, big deal.
[00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.291]  And they say in the press release, oh, the scanners are already kind of getting your biometrics.
[00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:13.135]  Now we just put in software that, quote, tells us if you are who you say you are.
[00:03:13.135 --> 00:03:14.956]  So see, they're putting you through the scanners.
[00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:18.498]  They've already got your name, your social security number, your driver's license number.
[00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:26.063]  Then they get that body print, and now they can attach it to your name, just like when you go into thumbprint or face scan, digital photo, get a driver's license.
[00:03:26.883 --> 00:03:28.685]  They can now attach it to your name.
[00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:39.816]  It's a little harder for them to just face scan you on the street and then try to tie it to what car you get in off your license plate and then assign a name to the body print.
[00:03:40.796 --> 00:03:50.187]  They want your DNA, they want your biometric data, that's why for 39 years, from Australia to Canada to the United States, from England to Germany, it's now declassified.
[00:03:50.187 --> 00:03:58.056]  Blood is taken from all babies that are born in hospitals under a secret federal mandate, now public, and put in a global DNA database.
[00:03:59.121 --> 00:04:02.543]  And they're already using it, quote, in crime investigations in Australia.
[00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:05.264]  That's when it really started to break mainstream news five years ago.
[00:04:05.264 --> 00:04:07.125]  People started to actually listen to us.
[00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:12.048]  Families filed suit in Minnesota and Texas, and now they've been forced to declassify it.
[00:04:12.048 --> 00:04:13.869]  But it's just an example of how they operate.
[00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:16.310]  They're getting your biometrics with these scanners.
[00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.492]  They're not just humiliating you and violating your Fourth Amendment.
[00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:26.096]  And now with the pat-downs, the TSA admitted and told Atlantic Monthly they're doing this for humiliation.
[00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.963]  To force you into the body scanners.
[00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:33.689]  And so it's operant Pavlovian conditioning.
[00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:37.432]  It's like a shock, you know, if you don't do what they're wanting you to do.
[00:04:37.432 --> 00:04:46.159]  We've got another big development that our video slash photo experts, we've got some real experts working here in the office, have blown up in Photoshop and looked at.
[00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.340]  It appears to be real.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.483]  It's from a photographer on Flickr who was in the airport.
[00:04:50.483 --> 00:04:56.708]  We'll tell you about what he saw and the photograph that's going up on InfoWars.com in the next 20 minutes.
[00:04:56.708 --> 00:04:58.109]  Kurt Nemo's writing a story on it.
[00:04:58.109 --> 00:04:59.450]  When we come back, stay with us.
[00:05:01.983 --> 00:05:05.985]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:09.226]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:14.028]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:20.410]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.651]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:23.491]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:23.751]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:24.372]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.372 --> 00:05:25.132]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.132 --> 00:05:26.813]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:49.388]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:49.388 --> 00:05:58.500]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:04.423]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:06:04.423 --> 00:06:05.564]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:10.129]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:16.076]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:18.218]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:06:18.218 --> 00:06:20.901]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:06:21.241 --> 00:06:27.745]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:06:27.745 --> 00:06:29.946]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:35.290]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.573]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:06:40.573 --> 00:06:45.736]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:06:45.936 --> 00:06:49.139]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.142]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:06:52.142 --> 00:06:52.903]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:05.582]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:05.582 --> 00:07:09.444]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:09.444 --> 00:07:11.746]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:11.746 --> 00:07:17.609]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:23.853]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:24.273 --> 00:07:30.255]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:30.255 --> 00:07:34.416]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:34.416 --> 00:07:38.717]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:38.717 --> 00:07:44.659]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:48.220]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.201]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:50.641]  It's here.
[00:07:51.301 --> 00:08:01.170]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.953]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.953 --> 00:08:06.756]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.496 --> 00:08:32.331]  We've been covering the TSA, this federalization body, openly setting up checkpoints at train stations, bus stations, highways, mobile x-ray trucks, even using National Guard in New York State and in Tennessee to make people drive under high-powered x-ray systems.
[00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:33.692]  They have put x-ray
[00:08:34.532 --> 00:08:38.057]  Backscatter systems into many of the airports.
[00:08:38.057 --> 00:08:42.623]  They plan by 2012 to have them in all major airports over 200.
[00:08:44.619 --> 00:08:50.342]  Drudge Report again today is carrying our article at the very, very top.
[00:08:50.342 --> 00:08:55.485]  Big Sis forced to respond to nationwide revolt against TSA.
[00:08:55.485 --> 00:09:07.491]  See, if we can have victories against the globalists and their police state brainwashing, re-education of America and the world, because similar things are happening all over the Western world, their whole system will then start
[00:09:09.012 --> 00:09:10.052]  Uh, falling apart.
[00:09:10.052 --> 00:09:11.072]  It will be reversed.
[00:09:11.072 --> 00:09:12.913]  That's why they always want more, more, more.
[00:09:12.913 --> 00:09:13.793]  Take your shoes off.
[00:09:13.793 --> 00:09:14.493]  Answer questions.
[00:09:14.493 --> 00:09:15.693]  Take your belt off.
[00:09:15.693 --> 00:09:16.573]  Go through your goods.
[00:09:16.573 --> 00:09:18.894]  You can't have more than three ounces of shampoo.
[00:09:18.894 --> 00:09:21.434]  You can't have a tiny pocket knife.
[00:09:21.434 --> 00:09:23.155]  Uh, you know, now we're gonna pat you down.
[00:09:23.155 --> 00:09:26.855]  Now we're gonna intensify it and touch your genitals.
[00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:29.196]  Now we're gonna record your naked body.
[00:09:29.196 --> 00:09:30.556]  On and on and on.
[00:09:30.556 --> 00:09:36.737]  Uh, and Drudge is top-linked to Big Sis, forced to respond to nationwide revolt against TSA.
[00:09:38.331 --> 00:09:43.074]  Very, very exciting information on that front.
[00:09:43.074 --> 00:09:46.377]  Of course, we're mainly reporting on a Reuters story.
[00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:49.999]  Pilots and passengers rail at new airport pat-downs.
[00:09:49.999 --> 00:10:01.828]  There's an emergency meeting today happening with Homeland Security Director Janet Napolitano and some of the biggest tourist lobbies and hotel lobbies in the country.
[00:10:01.828 --> 00:10:03.269]  They've got four different
[00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:07.192]  Pilot unions, some of them the biggest.
[00:10:07.192 --> 00:10:10.835]  They've got five different flight attendant unions.
[00:10:10.835 --> 00:10:13.418]  They've got airport worker unions.
[00:10:13.418 --> 00:10:16.000]  The TSA has not been allowed to unionize.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.021]  They've been angry.
[00:10:17.021 --> 00:10:18.803]  They're made to go through these.
[00:10:18.803 --> 00:10:25.168]  And there's been cases where TSA employees are made fun of every day for the size of their genitals.
[00:10:25.168 --> 00:10:29.032]  And so they punch their supervisor in the nose and they get arrested.
[00:10:30.165 --> 00:10:31.305]  Remember that came out a few months ago.
[00:10:31.305 --> 00:10:34.407]  The guy said, I've told you five times, this is the end.
[00:10:34.407 --> 00:10:34.967]  Pow!
[00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:36.167]  Right in the nose.
[00:10:36.167 --> 00:10:40.789]  Because they would make fun of the size of his genitalia.
[00:10:40.789 --> 00:10:43.090]  That's AP, Reuters, that's old news.
[00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.751]  Been out for what, three months or more?
[00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:48.312]  So all of that is going on.
[00:10:49.693 --> 00:10:52.315]  And you've got the TSA lying about recording the images.
[00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:56.238]  You've got the TSA lying about radiation dangers and being caught lying.
[00:10:56.238 --> 00:11:10.548]  The TSA two weeks ago announced, we started really hammering this then, that yes, not only if you refuse the body scanner will you get the enhanced pat-down, we will touch your genitals, we will touch your breasts, we will squeeze them to make sure they're not bombs.
[00:11:10.548 --> 00:11:12.470]  And people describe it as very painful.
[00:11:13.564 --> 00:11:25.348]  Then they came out last week and said, we're not doing that in official press releases, contradicting everything they'd already told USA Today, LA Times, New York Times, Washington Post.
[00:11:25.348 --> 00:11:32.471]  Now there are pilots and flight attendants and doctors and police and Muslim groups.
[00:11:32.471 --> 00:11:35.952]  Just everybody is up in an uproar.
[00:11:35.952 --> 00:11:42.395]  When Obama landed in India, they had top ministers bringing it up to him, tourism's down by
[00:11:43.075 --> 00:11:44.916]  Over a third just a few years ago.
[00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:47.238]  Reportedly, it's intensifying.
[00:11:47.238 --> 00:11:49.079]  People won't fly to Disney World.
[00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:52.961]  They won't fly to different theme parks.
[00:11:52.961 --> 00:11:54.182]  Tourism is way down.
[00:11:54.182 --> 00:11:56.423]  There's a no-fly day coming up.
[00:11:57.928 --> 00:12:04.793]  In a few weeks on Thanksgiving, in about two weeks, all of this is now happening.
[00:12:04.793 --> 00:12:18.762]  And so this simmering, boiling anger and frustration at this asinine searches in the name of terrorism, and if you really believe it's Muslims that are doing all this, which of course 99% of the time it's staged and it's not, why aren't they being singled out?
[00:12:18.762 --> 00:12:20.923]  Why aren't they being searched?
[00:12:20.923 --> 00:12:24.265]  Why aren't people affiliated with radical groups on the watch list?
[00:12:24.265 --> 00:12:26.767]  Why is it gun owners, conservatives, members of Congress?
[00:12:27.327 --> 00:12:34.611]  Because it's for the American people as the MIAC and Homeland Security reports that we got from law enforcement almost two years ago.
[00:12:34.611 --> 00:12:44.636]  January and February respectively, got the MIAC report in January, the Homeland Security report in February of 2009, over a year and a half ago.
[00:12:44.636 --> 00:12:50.819]  95% of it, and Napolitano now admits this, Janet Napolitano, that the main focus is returning veterans and gun owners.
[00:12:51.715 --> 00:12:51.935]  I think?
[00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:23.278]  All the major finance ministers saying we're going into a depression, total dollar collapse, and our own government saying that this is a great way to help the world to devalue the dollar.
[00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:26.459]  I think that should probably be the biggest story.
[00:13:26.459 --> 00:13:34.143]  It's now the second biggest story in the world, and we're going to be covering it today with Bob Chapman coming up.
[00:13:34.143 --> 00:13:35.204]  We've got Wayne Madsen.
[00:13:36.368 --> 00:13:39.389]  Saying China fired missiles seen in Southern California.
[00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:43.350]  We're going to get some other views of this as well coming up.
[00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.070]  Wayne joins us in about an hour and 15 minutes.
[00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:51.711]  Always informative and revealing and so many times what he covers turns out to be true no matter how wild it sounds.
[00:13:51.711 --> 00:13:54.852]  And I've seen other mainstream articles saying it might have been China or North Korea.
[00:13:54.852 --> 00:13:55.392]  I don't know.
[00:13:55.392 --> 00:13:58.333]  We're just investigating this because you've asked us to investigate it.
[00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:02.634]  We're going to continue to look at it.
[00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:02.774]  Now,
[00:14:04.298 --> 00:14:15.610]  When I got into the office a little bit later than usual, about 30 minutes before showtime, Rob Dew came to me and they'd been for hours looking at this image we're about to put on screen.
[00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.432]  Now this is the screensaver image.
[00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:27.722]  That was reportedly at the Indianapolis International Airport because they have the screened-in TSA offices where they look at the naked body scanner images.
[00:14:27.722 --> 00:14:34.524]  That's not done up there at the terminals where the TSA people are being radiated and the citizens are being radiated and having their rights violated.
[00:14:34.524 --> 00:14:36.564]  It's done in these glassed-off areas.
[00:14:36.564 --> 00:14:42.166]  And I before have walked up and looked through the windows and they get all angry and tell you to stop looking in because, you know, you might be a terrorist.
[00:14:42.166 --> 00:14:44.087]  You know, how dare you even look at them?
[00:14:44.087 --> 00:14:44.867]  They're like gods.
[00:14:46.243 --> 00:14:54.391]  This image, reportedly on a photographer's Flickr site, he took this photo, and we're trying to contact the photographer.
[00:14:54.391 --> 00:15:09.446]  We've looked at his site, is a photographer, and I've had several of our experts at Photoshop blowing it up on our big screen computers, and it appears to be real.
[00:15:10.492 --> 00:15:14.413]  Now, a lot of other sites are going with it, saying it is real.
[00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:19.375]  The point is, we're going to post it at InfoWars.com the next 10 minutes.
[00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:21.495]  Curt Nemo is in there doing it right now.
[00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:25.077]  But for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we're gonna put this up right now.
[00:15:25.077 --> 00:15:36.000]  It says, my first cavity search, helping your child understand why he may pose a threat to national security, ages six and up, homeland security.
[00:15:37.549 --> 00:15:39.451]  And Matt Ryan made the point minutes before air.
[00:15:39.451 --> 00:15:43.233]  He said, you know, this looks like from your TSA poster contest.
[00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:45.095]  This was never submitted to us or we missed it.
[00:15:45.095 --> 00:15:49.898]  Hundreds were sent in that we had six months ago.
[00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:55.182]  But I mean, obviously, yes, this is satire.
[00:15:55.182 --> 00:15:56.363]  There's no doubting that.
[00:15:56.363 --> 00:16:00.547]  And maybe it's even a TSA person that's angry about what's going on.
[00:16:00.547 --> 00:16:04.570]  I doubt that, though, because supervisors would get angry about something like this.
[00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.730]  Now, here's the photo.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.601]  It's linked up on Flickr and it's a high-res photo.
[00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:15.224]  It's through the glass and we'll blow it up on screen in the TSA Command Center.
[00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:20.166]  You can see through the TSA Command Center looking out on the terminals.
[00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:30.331]  Go ahead and blow up that photo for me.
[00:16:30.331 --> 00:16:32.552]  You can see that it is the
[00:16:34.338 --> 00:16:39.360]  Screensaver image that we just showed you a crisp image of.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.762]  The actual image, not the photo of the image on a computer screen.
[00:16:42.762 --> 00:16:49.865]  We've blown this up all the way, and if it is a fake, it's one of the best fakes we've ever seen.
[00:16:49.865 --> 00:16:52.066]  I tend to really doubt it is a fake.
[00:16:52.526 --> 00:16:59.190]  Plus, the photographer's got nothing but legitimate stuff on their Flickr site and other photos, and is using their real name.
[00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.131]  So again, we're reaching out to them.
[00:17:01.131 --> 00:17:04.793]  Maybe we'll have them on Sunday, maybe even today, if we're able to get a hold of them.
[00:17:04.793 --> 00:17:08.115]  I got three people in there trying to get a hold of this photographer.
[00:17:08.115 --> 00:17:11.297]  Now, what does the image show?
[00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:18.721]  It doesn't just say my first cavity search, teaching children how they're a threat to national security.
[00:17:18.721 --> 00:17:19.842]  And obviously, it's satire.
[00:17:21.647 --> 00:17:32.076]  But we have Atlantic Monthly, Jeffrey Goldberg interviewing TSA, and they admitted that they call it the male genital measurement device.
[00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:35.178]  They use the street slang term.
[00:17:35.178 --> 00:17:37.781]  It's the first name of Dick Cheney.
[00:17:37.781 --> 00:17:42.785]  And they call it the male member measuring device.
[00:17:42.785 --> 00:17:46.748]  And I'm sorry, folks, we don't talk about potty humor and stuff and things like this here on air.
[00:17:46.748 --> 00:17:48.490]  This is not Monty Python, this is not,
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.541]  You know, Jay Leno, this is not Benny Hill.
[00:17:53.541 --> 00:17:58.123]  This is happening to our children, our women, this is happening to our society, we have to cover this.
[00:17:58.123 --> 00:18:04.285]  For some of the people that are more prudent out there, I understand, for the prudes.
[00:18:04.285 --> 00:18:08.006]  I'm somewhat of one myself, especially on radio, it's a very serious format.
[00:18:08.006 --> 00:18:11.807]  But let's go back, let's go back to that photograph.
[00:18:11.807 --> 00:18:16.249]  When you look at this photograph, and you go back,
[00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:33.683]  It's important to realize that Jeff Goldberg, Jeffrey Goldberg of Atlantic Monthly has reported as of two days ago that TSA told him that it's all a big joke and that they watch it in a separate room and that they call it the male genital measuring device.
[00:18:34.761 --> 00:18:43.653]  How many TSA workers have been caught claiming they find drugs in people's bags repeatedly and demanding favors from them, in some cases sexual?
[00:18:43.653 --> 00:18:52.305]  How many TSA workers have been caught screaming and yelling and making fun of people and pulling good-looking women out of line and feeling them up?
[00:18:53.598 --> 00:18:58.260]  How many TSA workers have been caught going crazy and saying, I'm God, I'm God?
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.961]  I mean, this is in the news every week.
[00:19:00.961 --> 00:19:04.302]  Most of them are just people that want a job, 10, 15 bucks an hour.
[00:19:04.302 --> 00:19:09.444]  Most of them are just people, you know, who are just applying for a job.
[00:19:09.444 --> 00:19:11.985]  I've run into a lot of TSA that are fans of the show.
[00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:21.329]  But more and more, it's these control freaks who don't mind being radiated, who don't mind violating people's rights, who are either so stupid or so arrogant that they enjoy it.
[00:19:22.304 --> 00:19:25.726]  So we do have a real history.
[00:19:25.726 --> 00:19:27.827]  And this is what happens in concentration camps.
[00:19:27.827 --> 00:19:29.188]  This is what happens in prisons.
[00:19:29.188 --> 00:19:32.009]  This is what happened in the Stanford prison study.
[00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:35.051]  People become dehumanized and they always make jokes.
[00:19:35.051 --> 00:19:40.674]  It's like, you know, the Japanese cutting the heads off of our troops in World War II and playing soccer with their heads.
[00:19:41.827 --> 00:19:47.549]  Or the Pakistanis or Afghans famously will cut your head off and play polo with it.
[00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:51.731]  When you have a brutal society, they make a joke out of it to make it fun.
[00:19:51.731 --> 00:19:53.371]  The Nazis did that as well.
[00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:57.113]  So, I believe the photo's real because it's par for the course.
[00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:57.793]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:57.793 --> 00:19:58.193]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.187 --> 00:20:05.348]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[00:20:05.348 --> 00:20:07.229]  That something is Atwood Rope.
[00:20:07.229 --> 00:20:09.330]  The highest quality rope made in the USA.
[00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:15.152]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, towline, or boating.
[00:20:15.152 --> 00:20:18.833]  Quality rope at affordable prices you and your customers can depend on.
[00:20:18.833 --> 00:20:22.434]  Find a dealer or shop online at atwoodrope.net.
[00:20:22.434 --> 00:20:27.576]  Enter promo code RADIO to receive 100 feet of 550 paracord free with purchase.
[00:20:27.576 --> 00:20:28.456]  Atwood Rope.
[00:20:28.456 --> 00:20:30.337]  Working to keep the world tied together.
[00:20:30.837 --> 00:20:32.078]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:32.078 --> 00:20:36.641]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:36.641 --> 00:20:42.445]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:42.445 --> 00:20:46.087]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:46.087 --> 00:20:48.809]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:48.809 --> 00:20:53.872]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:53.872 --> 00:20:54.113]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:54.113 --> 00:20:55.514]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.917 --> 00:21:03.298]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:03.298 --> 00:21:05.619]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:05.619 --> 00:21:08.841]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.841 --> 00:21:13.943]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.943 --> 00:21:18.125]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:20.908]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.908 --> 00:21:23.672]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.672 --> 00:21:26.596]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.596 --> 00:21:34.206]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:34.522 --> 00:21:39.927]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.927 --> 00:21:42.230]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.454]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:46.454 --> 00:21:47.535]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:47.535 --> 00:21:48.876]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:50.377]  Invisible Empire.

[00:22:00.467 --> 00:22:04.652]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:22:04.652 --> 00:22:06.074]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:22:06.074 --> 00:22:10.079]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:12.823]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[00:22:12.823 --> 00:22:14.805]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:22:14.805 --> 00:22:17.108]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:22:18.109 --> 00:22:26.897]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:22:26.897 --> 00:22:30.400]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.483]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:22:33.703 --> 00:22:35.623]  Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:22:35.623 --> 00:22:39.484]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[00:22:39.484 --> 00:22:40.245]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:22:40.245 --> 00:22:43.285]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[00:22:43.285 --> 00:22:43.745]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:22:59.938 --> 00:23:01.999]  As gardeners, we can all relate.
[00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:04.399]  What do you do with all of the excess food that you grow?
[00:23:04.399 --> 00:23:12.302]  Freezing or canning may have been the process you've used, but the good folks at Excalibur Dehydrator have a healthy alternative to preserve the fruits of your labor.
[00:23:12.302 --> 00:23:18.944]  The Excalibur Dehydrator will help you preserve your fruits and vegetables quickly and easily, so you don't have to worry about premature spoiling.
[00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:23.287]  You can also use your Excalibur dehydrator year-round to make delicious jerky.
[00:23:23.287 --> 00:23:24.328]  And the best part?
[00:23:24.328 --> 00:23:28.391]  The foods you dehydrate are free from excess additives, salt, and preservatives.
[00:23:28.391 --> 00:23:30.573]  And that's something we can all do without!
[00:23:30.573 --> 00:23:40.261]  To learn more and to order your very own Excalibur dehydrator, visit Drying123.com and see how the Excalibur dehydrator can help you preserve your favorite foods.
[00:23:40.501 --> 00:23:40.981]  I think so.
[00:24:15.578 --> 00:24:18.200]  Coming up today, Wayne Madsen on the missile.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.341]  He says he's got intel sources.
[00:24:20.341 --> 00:24:22.403]  It was a Chinese threat.
[00:24:22.403 --> 00:24:24.704]  Angry over what's happening with devaluation of the dollar.
[00:24:24.704 --> 00:24:25.625]  They're the biggest holders.
[00:24:25.625 --> 00:24:27.946]  Then Bob Chapman's coming in.
[00:24:27.946 --> 00:24:35.631]  We may have some surprise guests as well on this live Friday edition, the 12th day of November 2010.
[00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:43.491]  I want to get into the economy, because we've been covering TSA so much, but our listeners know what's happening.
[00:24:43.491 --> 00:24:46.832]  We covered it with Max Keiser yesterday, but there's been some big new developments.
[00:24:46.832 --> 00:24:51.713]  The fighting between the central bank heads, at least on the surface, is intensifying.
[00:24:51.713 --> 00:24:52.973]  That's coming up.
[00:24:52.973 --> 00:25:06.156]  But I first just want to read to you the Reuters report that backs up our report, Big Sis forced to respond to nationwide revolt against TSA.
[00:25:08.373 --> 00:25:12.977]  That's the headline, again, top story on DrudgeReport.com as well.
[00:25:12.977 --> 00:25:16.500]  Pilots and passengers rail at new airport pat-downs.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.923]  This is Reuters last night.
[00:25:19.923 --> 00:25:20.683]  And it continues.
[00:25:20.683 --> 00:25:27.329]  Stepped-up security screening at airports in the wake of the foiled terrorist bombs have provoked an outcry from airline pilots and travelers.
[00:25:27.329 --> 00:25:33.454]  Yeah, those bombs were definitely sent because of the backlash already happening, including parents of children who say they are too intrusive.
[00:25:34.363 --> 00:25:47.468]  With the busiest holiday travel season nearing, flyers face long security lines and new rigorous pat-down checks that have begun in recent weeks amid the discovering of hidden explosives.
[00:25:47.468 --> 00:25:51.010]  As a result, some travelers are questioning whether to fly at all.
[00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:51.610]  This is Reuters.
[00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:59.614]  The Transportation Security Administration has ramped up airport security after two pilots and two plots by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
[00:25:59.614 --> 00:26:00.194]  Yeah, right.
[00:26:00.194 --> 00:26:04.096]  And where Al-Awlaki, admittedly, works for the Pentagon, is behind it.
[00:26:04.096 --> 00:26:07.478]  A Nigerian man hit a bomb in his underwear last Christmas.
[00:26:07.478 --> 00:26:09.759]  Again, working for Al-Awlaki, helped on the plane by the U.S.
[00:26:09.759 --> 00:26:10.660]  government.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.380]  The State Department admits that.
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.941]  Of course, Reuters doesn't tell you that.
[00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:18.143]  A Nigerian man hit a bomb in his underwear last Christmas, and the group tied
[00:26:19.404 --> 00:26:21.845]  I tried to send package bombs via U.S.
[00:26:21.845 --> 00:26:25.365]  cargo planes, but none of the explosives detonated.
[00:26:25.365 --> 00:26:30.246]  To thwart such an attack, TSA is deploying body scanning machines to U.S.
[00:26:30.246 --> 00:26:30.846]  airports.
[00:26:30.846 --> 00:26:34.347]  They ordered them two years before with Chertoff making the order.
[00:26:34.347 --> 00:26:38.828]  The head of Homeland Security, he's now the CEO of the main company that sold most of the machines.
[00:26:38.828 --> 00:26:39.928]  You gotta love that.
[00:26:39.928 --> 00:26:43.889]  He makes the purchase orders for billions and billions of dollars.
[00:26:43.889 --> 00:26:47.270]  It's been almost three billion each year, so we're talking about six billion total.
[00:26:48.366 --> 00:26:51.250]  And then he's the CEO of the company when he leaves.
[00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.513]  That's a delayed payoff.
[00:26:53.513 --> 00:26:56.657]  That is illegal, according to all the information I have.
[00:26:58.442 --> 00:27:01.663]  To thwart such an attack, TSA is deploying body scanning machines to U.S.
[00:27:01.663 --> 00:27:08.586]  airports, but travelers and pilots have complained about potential health risk and that they are too intrusive.
[00:27:08.586 --> 00:27:14.828]  The alternative is a physical pat-down by a TSA officer, which even USA Today reports means touching your genitals.
[00:27:14.828 --> 00:27:24.052]  Pilots are not a terrorist threat, said John Prater, president of the Airline Pilots Association, that's the biggest one, and a veteran pilot for United Continental.
[00:27:29.238 --> 00:27:33.825]  Seeing scarce security resources being used on pilots makes absolutely no sense.
[00:27:33.825 --> 00:27:36.829]  Yeah, you're going to trust them to fly the plane, but we've got to pat them down.
[00:27:36.829 --> 00:27:38.371]  Yeah, they could use the plane as a weapon.
[00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:39.072]  It's ridiculous!
[00:27:40.137 --> 00:27:43.239]  I mean, if you trust them to fly the plane, there should be no security.
[00:27:43.239 --> 00:27:46.961]  Some pilots, male and female, have complained the pat-downs make them feel uncomfortable.
[00:27:46.961 --> 00:27:50.984]  Yeah, their reports are that it hurts and they grab their breasts and genitals.
[00:27:50.984 --> 00:27:58.369]  The group urged any pilot who feels unfit for duty afterward, because they're shook up, to call in sick and remove themselves from the trip.
[00:27:58.369 --> 00:28:01.110]  So that's a form of strike that's already happening.
[00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.953]  This has prompted urgent talks between the pilots group and the TSA administrator.
[00:28:07.222 --> 00:28:15.824]  Again, this has prompted urgent talks between the TSA and the Pilots Group and the TSA Administrator, John Pistoli.
[00:28:15.824 --> 00:28:22.045]  The two sides hope to resolve the matter in a few weeks, Pratter said.
[00:28:22.045 --> 00:28:29.107]  Now, before I get into the hardcore info as I babble through this article, because as I'm thinking, as I'm reading, I'm thinking of all the different angles here.
[00:28:30.305 --> 00:28:42.192]  Remember just three weeks ago, a pilot said no to the pat-downs and no to the scanners, and then they wouldn't let him fly, and then he got in all this trouble, then they threatened to fire him and he stood his ground?
[00:28:42.192 --> 00:28:49.577]  Now it's thousands of pilots, tens of thousands of flight attendants, airport workers, TSA agents complaining about it.
[00:28:50.197 --> 00:28:53.879]  See, one guy stood up, and now everybody's standing up.
[00:28:53.879 --> 00:28:55.861]  What do they say in the movie A Bug's Life?
[00:28:55.861 --> 00:28:56.521]  The grasshopper.
[00:28:56.521 --> 00:28:58.462]  They're saying, why are we oppressing these ants?
[00:28:58.462 --> 00:28:59.963]  We don't need them for food.
[00:28:59.963 --> 00:29:01.564]  We don't need them as slaves.
[00:29:01.564 --> 00:29:09.930]  And the head grasshopper says, those little puny ants outnumber us 100 to 1, and if they ever figure that out, our way of life is over.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:18.585]  So those of you that call yourselves patriots and say we have no power, anybody that says we can change things or make them better is a liar.
[00:29:18.585 --> 00:29:21.667]  That is defeatist, globalist propaganda.
[00:29:21.667 --> 00:29:23.008]  It is a lie.
[00:29:23.008 --> 00:29:31.333]  I'm going to come back and get into the most hardcore information on this front because they've got the travel agencies, the hotels, the theme park heads, not just the unions.
[00:29:31.333 --> 00:29:35.556]  This revolt is becoming absolutely massive.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.982]  Now, no doubt the globalists are going to launch some more bombs on planes.
[00:29:39.982 --> 00:29:41.723]  I have no doubt of that.
[00:29:41.723 --> 00:29:43.164]  To try to get this through.
[00:29:43.164 --> 00:29:45.366]  Because it's not just about the billions for the scanners.
[00:29:45.366 --> 00:29:48.048]  It's about teaching us that they're the boss.
[00:29:48.048 --> 00:29:51.130]  And it's about federalizing the streets of America next.
[00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.531]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.531 --> 00:29:55.052]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.052 --> 00:29:57.734]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.782 --> 00:30:04.984]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:30:04.984 --> 00:30:11.387]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:30:11.387 --> 00:30:18.770]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:23.312]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:30:23.652 --> 00:30:32.315]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:30:32.315 --> 00:30:36.037]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:30:36.573 --> 00:30:43.339]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:30:43.339 --> 00:30:47.222]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:30:47.222 --> 00:30:53.607]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:30:53.607 --> 00:30:54.388]  Thank you.
[00:31:01.462 --> 00:31:16.928]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:31:16.928 --> 00:31:20.609]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:21.638 --> 00:31:34.392]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:41.680]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:52.731]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:31:52.731 --> 00:31:56.655]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:31:56.655 --> 00:31:59.758]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:04.940]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:05.840]  Number 1.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.281]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:09.281 --> 00:32:10.141]  Number 2.
[00:32:10.141 --> 00:32:15.022]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:15.022 --> 00:32:15.762]  It's true.
[00:32:15.762 --> 00:32:20.643]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.643 --> 00:32:21.463]  Number 3.
[00:32:21.463 --> 00:32:25.044]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:25.044 --> 00:32:28.745]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.965 --> 00:32:29.746]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.746 --> 00:32:32.508]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.508 --> 00:32:36.192]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:36.192 --> 00:32:36.993]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.993 --> 00:32:41.136]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:41.136 --> 00:32:45.901]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:46.181 --> 00:32:50.344]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:50.344 --> 00:32:52.145]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:52.145 --> 00:32:54.387]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:54.387 --> 00:32:56.268]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:56.268 --> 00:32:56.769]  Big Brother.
[00:32:56.769 --> 00:32:57.209]  Mainstream Media.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.780]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.861]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:10.861 --> 00:33:13.021]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:13.021 --> 00:33:21.343]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.343 --> 00:33:22.903]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:22.903 --> 00:33:26.564]  I'm going to continue now with this Reuters report.
[00:33:26.564 --> 00:33:31.225]  Pilots and passengers rail at new airport pat-downs.
[00:33:31.225 --> 00:33:34.366]  Headline, Gateway to Commerce.
[00:33:35.725 --> 00:33:36.746]  Well, that's what this is all about.
[00:33:36.746 --> 00:33:39.708]  The government can control the airways and the highways.
[00:33:39.708 --> 00:33:40.829]  They control everything, just like Rome.
[00:33:43.596 --> 00:34:02.332]  Executives from the travel industry, including online travel sites, theme parks and hotels, were set to meet with Homeland Security Director Janet Napolitano and the head of the TSA today to discuss their concerns that security is crippling travel.
[00:34:02.332 --> 00:34:04.394]  You see, the boycott's working.
[00:34:04.394 --> 00:34:10.940]  My wife and children haven't flown in nine years, ladies and gentlemen, because they're not going through it.
[00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:16.657]  And if you stop me at a checkpoint on the highway, you're not putting your hands on my daughters and my son and my wife.
[00:34:16.657 --> 00:34:19.058]  You got it, thugs, with your open borders?
[00:34:19.058 --> 00:34:19.578]  You got it?
[00:34:19.578 --> 00:34:21.678]  We know your boss has carried out the attacks.
[00:34:21.678 --> 00:34:22.378]  You got it?
[00:34:22.378 --> 00:34:23.239]  It's over.
[00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:29.080]  We know you carried out the attacks to set up a police state grid to get away with stealing all the pension funds and taxing us.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.100]  It's all about the foreign banks taking over.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.221]  This is how they're introducing authoritarian oppression.
[00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:35.490]  Sorry, I'm getting angry.
[00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:37.311]  I'll just think about it.
[00:34:37.311 --> 00:34:53.379]  Executives from the travel industry, see this is the power of the people, including online travel sites, theme parks and hotels, were set to meet Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and the head of the TSA, Pistoli, on Friday to discuss their concerns that security is crippling travel.
[00:34:53.979 --> 00:35:02.346]  We have received hundreds of emails and phone calls from travelers vowing to stop flying, said Jia Freeman, an executive vice president of the U.S.
[00:35:02.346 --> 00:35:03.527]  Travel Association.
[00:35:03.527 --> 00:35:05.729]  How about they get thousands?
[00:35:05.729 --> 00:35:06.669]  And don't stop.
[00:35:06.669 --> 00:35:08.451]  They think this will go away in a few weeks.
[00:35:08.451 --> 00:35:09.192]  It's not going away.
[00:35:09.192 --> 00:35:11.253]  It's going to get more intense.
[00:35:11.253 --> 00:35:22.803]  That's why in the last year I've had several naked body scanner contests and protests and flyers asking folks to post anti-TSA flyers all over your towns and cities.
[00:35:25.222 --> 00:35:37.670]  It was in the Dallas News yesterday that somebody put up our flyers about fluoride being poison in the water and that the health department and water department pulled them all down and is scared that people think fluoride is poison.
[00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:45.396]  The power of you going out and pointing out the 10 trillion pound elephant in the living room that the emperor has no clothes is unstoppable!
[00:35:46.036 --> 00:35:48.719]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[00:35:48.719 --> 00:35:49.840]  You've got the power!
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.562]  Start realizing it!
[00:35:51.562 --> 00:36:02.032]  I've always told you, as soon as you realize you've got power, as soon as you take action, and aren't shunted off into the left-right paradigm and all this garbage, it's over!
[00:36:02.032 --> 00:36:07.317]  For 9 plus years, for more than that, for 15 years, I've talked about government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:36:07.317 --> 00:36:08.378]  From Oklahoma City on.
[00:36:09.454 --> 00:36:12.156]  I don't care what people think, I've got the facts!
[00:36:12.156 --> 00:36:18.201]  And now Glenn Beck's on TV saying Obama's people are getting ready to stage a new Oklahoma City.
[00:36:18.201 --> 00:36:22.284]  Unbelievable!
[00:36:22.284 --> 00:36:25.386]  And even I saw a neocon site attack Glenn Beck over that.
[00:36:25.386 --> 00:36:27.808]  Little green footballs.
[00:36:27.808 --> 00:36:30.930]  I mean, you're losing control, New World Order.
[00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:34.333]  You're losing control, because the people are awake, and they're going to get more awake.
[00:36:35.307 --> 00:36:46.053]  I've described it as, America was in a deep trance, a deep sleep, now we're on the edge of our bed, kind of rubbing, you know, the sleep out of our eyes, but now that people are awake, we're able to give them the coffee.
[00:36:46.053 --> 00:36:48.474]  Here, you want, okay, you're awake now, drink this!
[00:36:48.474 --> 00:36:51.255]  Here's all the info!
[00:36:51.255 --> 00:36:54.357]  And in just 15-20 minutes, that caffeine's gonna hit.
[00:36:54.357 --> 00:36:57.859]  15-20 minutes in societal time, 6 months a year.
[00:36:58.834 --> 00:37:05.517]  So the globalists are gonna stage more attacks and do all sorts of crisis creation and perception management, i.e.
[00:37:05.517 --> 00:37:07.738]  lying, to try to put us back to sleep.
[00:37:07.738 --> 00:37:11.419]  It ain't gonna work if we get up and yell and scream that much louder.
[00:37:11.419 --> 00:37:12.680]  You see people starting to go back to sleep?
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.460]  Go, wake up!
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.100]  No!
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:19.543]  Don't let the body snatchers get your soul, your mind, your intellect.
[00:37:19.543 --> 00:37:22.084]  So, listen to the magnitude of this, how exciting this is.
[00:37:23.067 --> 00:37:35.812]  Executives from the travel industry, including online travel sites, theme parks, and hotels, were set to meet with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Pistoli on Friday to discuss their concerns that security is crippling travel.
[00:37:35.812 --> 00:37:40.514]  Europe's pulling this stuff out because it's killing tourism!
[00:37:40.514 --> 00:37:47.016]  We have received hundreds of emails and phone calls from travelers vowing to stop flying, said the Executive Vice President of U.S.
[00:37:47.016 --> 00:37:50.698]  Travel Association, which was set to meet with Obama administration officials.
[00:37:51.601 --> 00:38:02.990]  You can't talk on the one hand about creating jobs in this country and getting the economy back on track, and on the other hand, discourage millions of Americans from flying, which is the gateway to commerce, he said.
[00:38:03.598 --> 00:38:11.324]  Well, they're raising taxes all over the country and the world, knowing that'll stall the economy further and have less tax receipts.
[00:38:11.324 --> 00:38:16.408]  And the global estate, CFR, Club of Rome, UN, they want a post-industrial world.
[00:38:16.408 --> 00:38:20.271]  It's the big megabanks waging war against real industry and commerce.
[00:38:20.271 --> 00:38:22.053]  They want to consolidate it.
[00:38:22.053 --> 00:38:28.098]  You think a corrupt bank 70, 80 years ago wanted the farmer on his last payment?
[00:38:29.246 --> 00:38:32.389]  To make his last payment and own the farm?
[00:38:32.389 --> 00:38:32.589]  No.
[00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:36.774]  They want all those payments over the years, and then to steal them.
[00:38:36.774 --> 00:38:44.181]  And they get people to sign fraudulent contracts, you know, ten years before, and on the last payment day, they come and refuse the payment and take the farm.
[00:38:44.181 --> 00:38:46.083]  They're taking the farm, folks.
[00:38:46.083 --> 00:38:47.004]  It's really simple.
[00:38:50.057 --> 00:38:52.258]  Of course they wanna shut down the economy.
[00:38:52.258 --> 00:38:53.599]  Of course they don't want you flying.
[00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:58.843]  They want carbon taxes, they've announced, of over $1,000 to fly from the U.S.
[00:38:58.843 --> 00:38:59.863]  to England.
[00:38:59.863 --> 00:39:05.067]  England wants 2,000 pounds to leave England.
[00:39:05.067 --> 00:39:06.768]  They're trying to put those in place.
[00:39:06.768 --> 00:39:16.474]  That's like $3,500 to leave England on any flight out of the country for carbon taxes.
[00:39:18.539 --> 00:39:21.301]  Of course they don't want you flying!
[00:39:21.301 --> 00:39:30.849]  Of course they don't want you... The head of the Transportation Administration, what, six, seven months ago, was in the Wall Street Journal and said, yes, we are anti-car.
[00:39:30.849 --> 00:39:32.490]  Yes, we want you out of your cars.
[00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:37.253]  Yes, we don't want highways.
[00:39:37.253 --> 00:39:47.541]  Continuing, you can't talk on the one hand about creating jobs in this country and getting the economy back on track, and on the other hand, discourage millions of Americans from flying, which is the gateway to commerce, he said.
[00:39:47.541 --> 00:39:47.982]  By the way,
[00:39:49.534 --> 00:39:52.416]  I was so focused covering the national election.
[00:39:52.416 --> 00:40:01.500]  Will you guys search and see if the carbon taxes, greenhouse gas law went into effect last week in California?
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.301]  I know it was neck and neck in the polls.
[00:40:03.301 --> 00:40:06.463]  It'd be a 20% tax on anything producing carbon dioxide.
[00:40:11.016 --> 00:40:14.118]  Imagine a 20% tax on top of everything in California.
[00:40:14.118 --> 00:40:16.680]  What industry won't leave to another state like Texas?
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.101]  Or won't leave to China?
[00:40:18.101 --> 00:40:21.024]  Or won't leave to South Korea where there's none of these carbon taxes?
[00:40:21.957 --> 00:40:23.238]  So just look that up.
[00:40:23.238 --> 00:40:35.264]  I forget the prompt number, but I want to see if, you know, something like voters reject greenhouse curbs, they don't even call it a tax, or voters pass.
[00:40:35.264 --> 00:40:37.945]  I don't know, because it was, they'd already passed the law years ago.
[00:40:37.945 --> 00:40:45.168]  It was a ballot initiative to get rid of it.
[00:40:45.168 --> 00:40:47.770]  Maybe somebody can Twitter us who's in California.
[00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:48.050]  Do what?
[00:40:49.568 --> 00:40:51.209]  They rejected it.
[00:40:51.209 --> 00:40:56.791]  So by rejecting it, they shot down the carbon taxes?
[00:40:56.791 --> 00:40:57.991]  Oh, they went with it.
[00:40:57.991 --> 00:40:59.292]  Oh my gosh.
[00:40:59.292 --> 00:41:00.812]  French news agency.
[00:41:00.812 --> 00:41:05.874]  California rejects proposal to repeal greenhouse gas law.
[00:41:05.874 --> 00:41:06.995]  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:18.485]  Welcomed late Tuesday voters' rejection of a proposal to backtrack on a law limiting greenhouse gas emissions in the most populous U.S.
[00:41:18.485 --> 00:41:19.006]  state.
[00:41:19.006 --> 00:41:30.894]  Proposition 23, one of the series of referendums held alongside midterm and governor polls, sought to all but repeal the 2006 Schwarzenegger-backed climate change law.
[00:41:32.045 --> 00:41:33.706]  Bill known as AB 32.
[00:41:33.706 --> 00:41:38.968]  But it goes through, and now they're gonna put phased in over the next five years, 20% taxes.
[00:41:38.968 --> 00:41:43.629]  Man, I tell ya, post-industrial America.
[00:41:43.629 --> 00:41:47.511]  And of course a Nazi's presiding over it, an admitted Nazi.
[00:41:47.511 --> 00:41:50.972]  I always admired Hitler, wants to be worshipped like at Nuremberg.
[00:41:50.972 --> 00:41:54.894]  Source, 1977 Rolling Stone Magazine.
[00:41:54.894 --> 00:41:55.574]  That's just part of it.
[00:41:57.023 --> 00:42:01.766]  But you're saying, why are you talking about TSA and travel and then now greenhouse gases?
[00:42:01.766 --> 00:42:12.552]  Because you've got these industry heads and travel heads, travel association heads saying, you can't talk about free market and business and do this.
[00:42:12.552 --> 00:42:14.073]  It's killing us.
[00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:19.896]  Travel to the US is down by over a third and people say on the questionnaires, because I don't want to be squeezed.
[00:42:19.896 --> 00:42:22.598]  For three years, they've been genital grabbing foreigners.
[00:42:25.216 --> 00:42:27.738]  But because the Muslims protested, they leave them alone.
[00:42:27.738 --> 00:42:28.979]  That's on record.
[00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:34.283]  Just like Muslims get to wear their headdresses and cover their faces when they get driver's license photos.
[00:42:34.283 --> 00:42:40.007]  But Willie Nelson, this has been in the news, he's told, you take that cowboy hat off, boy!
[00:42:40.007 --> 00:42:47.092]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:42:51.027 --> 00:42:55.169]  You can't talk on the one hand about creating jobs in this country and getting the economy back on track.
[00:42:55.169 --> 00:43:00.352]  On the other hand, discourage millions of Americans from flying, which is a gateway to commerce, he said.
[00:43:00.352 --> 00:43:04.694]  Privacy groups have challenged the new body scanners in court, saying they are a violation of privacy and illegal...
[00:43:06.331 --> 00:43:07.191]  It goes on.
[00:43:07.191 --> 00:43:11.293]  Lawmakers plan to hold hearings on aviation security next week when they return to Washington.
[00:43:11.293 --> 00:43:14.334]  Some travelers are all... See, now there's hearings in Congress!
[00:43:14.334 --> 00:43:16.094]  There's meetings at the White House!
[00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:18.135]  There's meetings at Homeland Security!
[00:43:18.135 --> 00:43:18.955]  Boom!
[00:43:18.955 --> 00:43:24.797]  Because you got angry, you spoke out, Drudge carried our stories, now everybody's talking about it.
[00:43:24.797 --> 00:43:26.718]  The TSA's been caught in lies.
[00:43:26.718 --> 00:43:32.220]  Think of the power we have as citizens to take action through the alternative media, which is why they want to shut it down.
[00:43:34.679 --> 00:43:37.542]  Some travelers are also livid about how children are being screened.
[00:43:37.542 --> 00:43:45.531]  During a trip last Sunday by a father and son through an Orlando airport in Florida, the 8-year-old boy was selected for extra screening by the TSA for going through the metal detector.
[00:43:45.531 --> 00:43:48.274]  The fathers of the officer described the procedure before conducting it.
[00:43:48.274 --> 00:43:53.560]  Then he patted down the boy in an open security area using the back side of his hands to check the genital area.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.601]  See, that's not even enhanced.
[00:43:55.322 --> 00:44:03.587]  I didn't think it was going to be as horrible as he was describing, said the boy's father, Bill, who works as a lobbyist in Washington and did not want his full name used.
[00:44:03.587 --> 00:44:11.613]  See, you got all these New York Times and Washington Post and high-powered lobbyists and governors like Jesse Ventura.
[00:44:11.613 --> 00:44:14.635]  I've been with him when he's like, that's why I'm leaving the country, Alex.
[00:44:14.635 --> 00:44:16.256]  That's why I'm getting out of here.
[00:44:16.256 --> 00:44:17.556]  This is East Germany.
[00:44:17.556 --> 00:44:18.857]  Checkpoint Charlie.
[00:44:18.857 --> 00:44:23.680]  As I was watching him go up his legs and his genitals, patting his chest, putting their hands on his
[00:44:25.299 --> 00:44:29.745]  Blutus Maximus.
[00:44:29.745 --> 00:44:35.634]  Because he has a metal hip.
[00:44:35.634 --> 00:44:38.278]  The father said he didn't believe it'd be as horrible as it was described.
[00:44:39.653 --> 00:44:50.123]  The lobbyist said, we spend my child's whole life telling him that only mom, dad, or a doctor can touch you in a private area, and now we have TSA agents, and that's just wrong, he told Reuters.
[00:44:50.123 --> 00:44:52.606]  At some point, the terrorists have won.
[00:44:52.606 --> 00:44:56.369]  Yeah, the terrorists that carried out the attacks that run the government, pal?
[00:44:56.369 --> 00:44:58.932]  You got it, the terrorists are winning, but now we're fighting back.
[00:45:00.182 --> 00:45:06.605]  TSA defends the body scanners is safe and says the devices and friskings are key tools to detect hidden explosives.
[00:45:06.605 --> 00:45:07.885]  And it goes on with the baloney.
[00:45:07.885 --> 00:45:09.566]  So a total revolt.
[00:45:09.566 --> 00:45:14.148]  Drudge has top-linked our key report.
[00:45:14.148 --> 00:45:17.569]  Big Sis forced to respond to nationwide revolt.
[00:45:17.569 --> 00:45:21.091]  Top story on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:45:21.091 --> 00:45:24.232]  It's the article to send out to everybody.
[00:45:24.232 --> 00:45:26.053]  And LinkedIn it as well.
[00:45:27.353 --> 00:45:42.586]  Is the update, the new article, so under the photo of Butch Napolitano, Janet Napolitano, is the link to TSA desktop image makes joke of cavity searching children.
[00:45:42.586 --> 00:45:49.693]  And then it ties into all the confirmed TSA jokes, the vulgar names they have for the x-ray machines.
[00:45:51.021 --> 00:45:52.402]  The X-Ray Body Scanners.
[00:45:52.402 --> 00:45:54.384]  Again, I'm not going to repeat what they call it.
[00:45:54.384 --> 00:45:56.926]  You can read the Atlantic Monthly Blurb we have.
[00:45:56.926 --> 00:45:58.066]  Here's Kurt Nemo's article.
[00:45:58.066 --> 00:46:00.729]  Excellent job, Kurt, getting this article done in 30 minutes.
[00:46:00.729 --> 00:46:06.133]  TSA desktop image makes joke of cavity searching children.
[00:46:06.133 --> 00:46:12.478]  A Flickr photo shows a computer in a TSA airport office with a desktop image of a satirical book.
[00:46:14.183 --> 00:46:15.983]  My first cavity search.
[00:46:15.983 --> 00:46:20.144]  Our photo and Photoshop experts have examined the image and believe it's real.
[00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:25.205]  Infowars.com is currently attempting to contact the Flickr photographer to establish the image is real.
[00:46:25.205 --> 00:46:33.866]  In January, The Guardian reported that experts determined the naked body scanner technology violates child protection laws, which ban the creation of indecent images of children.
[00:46:33.866 --> 00:46:42.328]  The British Government Department for Transport confirmed that child porn problem was among the legal and operational issues under discussion within the government.
[00:46:43.493 --> 00:46:44.574]  So they just violate the law.
[00:46:44.574 --> 00:46:52.077]  Earlier this year, a TSA employee in Miami was arrested after he physically assaulted a coworker who had joked about the size of his genitals.
[00:47:01.673 --> 00:47:10.199]  As the neocon Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in October, the TSA considers the backscatter scanners and the opt-out manual search comical.
[00:47:10.199 --> 00:47:16.023]  Goldberg asked the TSA officer if he knew the Department of Homeland Security's guidelines involving a cavity search.
[00:47:16.023 --> 00:47:16.523]  No way.
[00:47:16.523 --> 00:47:17.744]  You think Congress would allow that?
[00:47:17.744 --> 00:47:19.125]  The TSA employee responded.
[00:47:20.868 --> 00:47:32.496]  Congress may be squeamish about the anal cavity searches, but if the photo below is indeed real, employs the TSA consider the most humiliating form of molestation to be a laughing matter, especially when they are conducted on children.
[00:47:34.704 --> 00:47:35.784]  That's good, Kurt.
[00:47:35.784 --> 00:47:39.366]  I want you, Kurt misunderstood me when I said take a Jeffrey Goldberg quote.
[00:47:39.366 --> 00:48:02.814]  There's a new article and it's in Paul Watson's article, Drudge Report Stirs TSA Debate, that has the newest Goldberg article where he interviews, but this is pertinent as well, where he interviews the TSA and they call it the male member measurement system.
[00:48:04.235 --> 00:48:09.256]  So, the article's up.
[00:48:09.256 --> 00:48:10.697]  We're going to get beefed up.
[00:48:10.697 --> 00:48:13.597]  I also want to add other abuse.
[00:48:13.597 --> 00:48:16.958]  Shane, again, we don't know if this photo is real, but it appears to be.
[00:48:16.958 --> 00:48:24.820]  And look at how they plant drugs on people, or fake drugs, and then demand favors, or the TSA workers who've been caught being pedophiles.
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.920]  I want to add the pedophile stuff.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.881]  A, I'll just write it down right now.
[00:48:28.881 --> 00:48:31.161]  I want to add, this is all live time, folks.
[00:48:31.161 --> 00:48:32.382]  War game on the air.
[00:48:32.382 --> 00:48:33.762]  Info war declared on The Globalist.
[00:48:34.824 --> 00:48:38.527]  I want the pedophile cases exposed.
[00:48:38.527 --> 00:48:43.691]  I want the death cases added where they killed people.
[00:48:43.691 --> 00:48:44.872]  I want the Jeff Goldberg.
[00:48:44.872 --> 00:48:51.498]  I want the Jeff Goldberg latest piece.
[00:48:51.498 --> 00:48:54.780]  And if you want to find it, Kurt, it's in Watson's last article.
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:58.023]  Drudge stirs debate about TSA screening.
[00:48:58.023 --> 00:48:58.784]  It's got a link to it.
[00:48:58.784 --> 00:49:01.506]  It's got the excised portion.
[00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:03.507]  We're
[00:49:23.625 --> 00:49:51.438]  Through the window of the cavity search with a little kid who's scared with two TSA workers laughing about it And again that they just took some satire off the web and put it as a desktop image Then you can see the actual desktop image Underneath it my first cavity search helping your child understand why he may pose a threat to national security in fact Let's just go to InfoWars.com now live on air for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers Let's just show the article Kurt's new article up there, and we'll show you
[00:49:52.658 --> 00:50:01.023]  Where the stuff is posted down at the bottom, but TSA desktop image makes a joke of searching children
[00:50:03.356 --> 00:50:07.017]  And then again, you scroll down, and it's all right there.
[00:50:07.017 --> 00:50:12.878]  This is big, big, big news and information.
[00:50:12.878 --> 00:50:19.219]  I want to finish up with this issue, and then I want to start getting into the economy, other world news, coming up in about 40 minutes.
[00:50:19.219 --> 00:50:26.661]  We're going to look at Wayne Madsen's report that is from a subscription site, but he authorizes to post it at Infowars.com and Brisbane.com, graciously.
[00:50:26.661 --> 00:50:28.141]  Wayne Madsen, China.
[00:50:28.141 --> 00:50:30.862]  Fired missile seen in Southern California.
[00:50:30.862 --> 00:50:32.102]  But then I've got other reports.
[00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:33.643]  Where they're saying the U.S.
[00:50:33.643 --> 00:50:41.148]  Navy was testing a missile launch off the coast, off the west coast, and that they had to tell the FAA so planes don't fly in the area they were doing it.
[00:50:41.148 --> 00:50:44.111]  If that's the case, why wouldn't the government just tell us they did a missile test?
[00:50:44.111 --> 00:50:49.595]  Unless they wanted to create fear, and then put out the story through government that it was China to blame China for things.
[00:50:49.595 --> 00:50:53.357]  We'll discuss it all with Wayne Madsen, coming up, jam-packed Friday transmission.
[00:50:53.357 --> 00:50:54.398]  We'll be right back.

[00:52:06.641 --> 00:52:10.342]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:10.342 --> 00:52:12.802]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.802 --> 00:52:18.684]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:18.684 --> 00:52:24.925]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:25.345 --> 00:52:31.287]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:31.287 --> 00:52:35.489]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:52:35.489 --> 00:52:39.791]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[00:52:45.733 --> 00:52:49.295]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:49.295 --> 00:52:51.256]  The police state isn't coming.

[00:53:15.765 --> 00:53:19.688]  Have you ever wondered about whether your personal and religious liberty will survive?
[00:53:19.688 --> 00:53:24.652]  After all, what good are gold, silver, and survival supplies in a concentration camp?
[00:53:24.652 --> 00:53:29.035]  And have you ever thought about what kind of America you're leaving to your kids and grandkids?
[00:53:29.035 --> 00:53:33.398]  Then theonlywayback.com is an open online letter you must read.
[00:53:33.398 --> 00:53:35.520]  Find out where true liberty comes from.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:35.960]  Let's do it!
[00:54:07.503 --> 00:54:20.493]  Okay, this segues back into Glenn Beck with the bombshell statement that the government is preparing to stage a new Oklahoma City to be blamed on the Patriot movement.
[00:54:20.493 --> 00:54:21.173]  That's what he said.
[00:54:21.173 --> 00:54:21.734]  We played the clip.
[00:54:21.734 --> 00:54:24.936]  I'm going to play it again later when Bob Chapman's on with us to get his take on it.
[00:54:30.441 --> 00:54:34.204]  We tried to make the term stage terror the number one search term.
[00:54:34.204 --> 00:54:40.369]  It became the number two search term yesterday because it couldn't become number one because you made FEMA camps number one.
[00:54:40.369 --> 00:54:41.329]  Great job, folks.
[00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:42.791]  Great job in the Info War.
[00:54:42.791 --> 00:54:44.212]  We declare the Info War.
[00:54:44.212 --> 00:54:49.296]  We declare major offensives in the Info War that we're intensifying what we're doing.
[00:54:49.296 --> 00:54:50.296]  We smell blood.
[00:54:50.296 --> 00:54:51.117]  We see blood.
[00:54:51.117 --> 00:54:53.299]  We're going to get in there and get after them.
[00:54:53.299 --> 00:54:53.939]  It's our liberty.
[00:54:53.939 --> 00:54:54.540]  It's our freedom.
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:55.220]  It's our children.
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:56.261]  It's our republic.
[00:54:56.261 --> 00:54:57.022]  It's free humanity.
[00:54:57.796 --> 00:55:07.983]  But I saw a commenter on the InfoWars.com article that Aaron Dykes blurbed last night, FEMA camps becomes number one search term on Google.
[00:55:07.983 --> 00:55:12.386]  The commenter said, hey Alex, get yourself together, beta test this better.
[00:55:12.386 --> 00:55:16.969]  FEMA camps became the number one search term, but your articles about it were nowhere.
[00:55:18.669 --> 00:55:24.211]  Yes, and it's not because we use too simple of a term, sir, as you said, and not that we're perfect.
[00:55:24.211 --> 00:55:26.592]  We learn new stuff all the time, and a lot of you help us.
[00:55:26.592 --> 00:55:29.794]  It was a listener's idea to do search terms four or five months ago.
[00:55:29.794 --> 00:55:34.996]  Now we've had over 40 of them that are top search terms.
[00:55:34.996 --> 00:55:41.379]  If you put the headline in for Prison Planet or InfoWars under Google News, it was completely blocked.
[00:55:41.379 --> 00:55:43.420]  They blocked our articles yesterday.
[00:55:44.781 --> 00:55:49.944]  It wasn't that we didn't use a complex enough term as you recommended.
[00:55:49.944 --> 00:55:53.027]  He wanted to say bombshell FEMA camps because that was our headline.
[00:55:53.027 --> 00:55:55.068]  That wasn't it, my friend.
[00:55:55.068 --> 00:55:56.309]  They completely blocked
[00:55:57.384 --> 00:56:02.526]  On web and on news, when you clicked on the top search term, it was nowhere.
[00:56:02.526 --> 00:56:12.670]  But that didn't stop people from finding out we'd done it, and over 50 blogs and websites, as of this morning that I counted, had run with the story and picked our article up, and those had gone up to the top.
[00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:14.230]  So, it got out.
[00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.911]  It got out.
[00:56:14.911 --> 00:56:17.932]  Yes, they're trying to block us, because they know this is effective.
[00:56:17.932 --> 00:56:22.154]  It's starting to drive the news.
[00:56:22.154 --> 00:56:25.315]  Now, we'll see if they block this today, but it's three words.
[00:56:26.209 --> 00:56:27.689]  Let's do it together!
[00:56:27.689 --> 00:56:30.010]  REVOLT AGAINST TSA!
[00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:32.310]  REVOLT AGAINST TSA!
[00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:35.211]  REVOLT AGAINST, and then TSA.
[00:56:35.211 --> 00:56:38.751]  Three words, two words and an acronym.
[00:56:38.751 --> 00:56:40.672]  REVOLT AGAINST TSA!
[00:56:40.672 --> 00:56:41.292]  And guess what?
[00:56:41.292 --> 00:56:49.373]  There's already so many articles with that headline and all this info, it won't matter if Google blocks InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:49.373 --> 00:56:53.054]  And the big dirty secret is, I don't even care if they do.
[00:56:53.054 --> 00:56:53.334]  Sure,
[00:56:54.668 --> 00:56:58.452]  I like millions of visitors every day because we're putting the truth out.
[00:56:58.452 --> 00:57:01.655]  But I'd love to beat these people and go home.
[00:57:01.655 --> 00:57:03.557]  All I care about is the info.
[00:57:03.557 --> 00:57:09.243]  You think Google, I care that you blocked InfoWars and Prison Planet with those search terms so people couldn't get to articles?
[00:57:09.243 --> 00:57:10.604]  Everybody else just picked them up.
[00:57:10.604 --> 00:57:12.166]  It got out there.
[00:57:12.166 --> 00:57:15.049]  Hip hip hooray!
[00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:17.692]  That's all I care about is getting the information out.
[00:57:19.608 --> 00:57:21.950]  And we're forcing all of this into the mainstream.
[00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:27.073]  Glenn Beck's talking about the government wanting to blow up federal buildings to blame it on patriots.
[00:57:27.073 --> 00:57:33.317]  The biggest news story in the world is the revolt against all this slave training, this Nazi training, this submission training.
[00:57:34.448 --> 00:57:37.270]  We're hitting on all cylinders and I want to commend my crew.
[00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:43.594]  I want to commend our sponsors, the Genesis Network, our listeners, you activists out there, you wonderful people taking action.
[00:57:43.594 --> 00:57:48.858]  Let's make revolt against TSA numero uno.
[00:57:48.858 --> 00:57:51.279]  Revolt against TSA.
[00:57:51.279 --> 00:57:58.804]  They cannot stop you if you take action and take those three words and put them into Google and let's hit Yahoo and let's hit all the other search engines.
[00:57:58.804 --> 00:58:00.105]  Let's get aggressive.
[00:58:00.105 --> 00:58:04.088]  You just put it in the search box and click it and then hit enter, enter, enter over and over again.
[00:58:04.928 --> 00:58:08.872]  Gotta put the cursor in the middle each time and, you know, so it thinks it's a new search.
[00:58:08.872 --> 00:58:10.093]  And then click on our story.
[00:58:10.093 --> 00:58:11.594]  Send them out to everybody you know.
[00:58:11.594 --> 00:58:13.656]  You're seeing the effect we're having.
[00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:15.777]  Look, folks, I'm a kamikaze in the info war.
[00:58:15.777 --> 00:58:16.938]  I'm going all in.
[00:58:16.938 --> 00:58:19.400]  I passed the point of no return over a decade ago.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.641]  I'm not stopping.
[00:58:20.641 --> 00:58:22.223]  The globalists know we're effective.
[00:58:22.223 --> 00:58:23.604]  They know we're real.
[00:58:23.604 --> 00:58:26.226]  And we're reaching out to hearts and minds.
[00:58:26.226 --> 00:58:30.189]  Politicians, lobbyists, rich people are getting mad by the TSA.
[00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:32.752]  Everybody knows this is wrong.
[00:58:32.752 --> 00:58:35.394]  It's causing the travel industry a lot of money.
[00:58:35.394 --> 00:58:36.636]  There's a revolt on.
[00:58:36.636 --> 00:58:38.738]  We're gonna beat these terrorists.
[00:58:38.738 --> 00:58:42.601]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:42.601 --> 00:58:46.205]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.205 --> 00:58:48.067]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.354 --> 00:58:54.937]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:58:54.937 --> 00:58:56.058]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:58:56.058 --> 00:59:00.623]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:59:00.623 --> 00:59:06.568]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:59:06.568 --> 00:59:08.730]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:11.413]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:59:11.753 --> 00:59:18.239]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:59:18.239 --> 00:59:20.461]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:59:20.461 --> 00:59:25.805]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:59:25.805 --> 00:59:31.090]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:36.214]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:59:36.434 --> 00:59:39.637]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[00:59:39.637 --> 00:59:42.640]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:43.401]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:59:43.401 --> 00:59:44.342]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:44.342 --> 00:59:46.063]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.762 --> 01:00:10.608]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:12.210]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:13.752]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.752 --> 01:00:17.937]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.937 --> 01:00:22.002]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.755 --> 01:00:26.478]  We are now into hour number two in about 30 minutes.
[01:00:26.478 --> 01:00:29.321]  Wayne Madsen of Wayne Madsen Report will be joining us.
[01:00:29.321 --> 01:00:30.903]  He's got a lot of good sources for him.
[01:00:30.903 --> 01:00:32.585]  We worked with the NSA.
[01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:35.729]  He says China fired a missile seen in Southern California as a threat.
[01:00:37.602 --> 01:00:42.025]  North Korea does that type of thing routinely against Japan and South Korea.
[01:00:42.025 --> 01:00:43.847]  Very bizarre.
[01:00:43.847 --> 01:00:47.369]  But we've got other reports, and Paul Watson's vetting these and looking into them.
[01:00:47.369 --> 01:00:49.671]  One of them is from Mike Rivera, What Really Happened?
[01:00:49.671 --> 01:00:50.552]  Confirmed U.S.
[01:00:50.552 --> 01:00:54.595]  Navy was testing missile launch off the coast of California.
[01:00:54.595 --> 01:00:58.197]  And I've looked into this myself previously.
[01:00:58.197 --> 01:01:01.220]  They've got to tell the FAA when they're going to be testing high-powered missiles.
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.901]  They didn't do that with Flight 800, TWA.
[01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:13.325]  And that did come out that that was a Navy test missile that blew that aircraft out of the air so many years ago, and Hare Clinton covered that up.
[01:01:13.325 --> 01:01:32.192]  But there is a Pentagon report, Naval Air Warfare Center, to the FAA, telling them the degrees, the latitude, the longitude, and areas not to fly into Monday through Friday this week.
[01:01:36.986 --> 01:01:39.467]  So I don't know what to say about all this.
[01:01:39.467 --> 01:01:45.930]  We're just looking at it, trying to figure out exactly what's happening on that front.
[01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:53.193]  We've got Wayne Madsen, as I said, coming up.
[01:01:53.193 --> 01:01:54.494]  There's a new report up on
[01:01:55.776 --> 01:02:01.223]  PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Watson, Steve Watson, they're on fire over there.
[01:02:01.223 --> 01:02:11.695]  World battles the invasion of the naked body scanners and it breaks down just the incredible full-on assault as people realize the emperor has no clothes.
[01:02:12.276 --> 01:02:30.825]  Now, I'm also going to be getting into the unbelievably important developments on the economy, but I want to open the phones up in the next segment for quick comments or questions on your view on this revolt against the TSA takeover of society, similar things happening in Europe, and what's happening with the announcement of the dollar devaluation, gold and silver exploding off the chart.
[01:02:30.825 --> 01:02:31.285]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:31.285 --> 01:02:31.305]  800-259.
[01:02:37.848 --> 01:02:43.891]  92 31 and we will get you up and on the air on this live Friday edition.
[01:02:43.891 --> 01:02:51.193]  Then I'll even take a few calls for Wayne on the missile issue once he gets on with us and then Bob Chapman.
[01:02:51.193 --> 01:02:54.415]  And then I'm going to get back into Glenn Beck says government preparing to stage terror.
[01:02:54.415 --> 01:02:55.195]  That is so
[01:02:57.486 --> 01:03:00.667]  So important that he did that.
[01:03:00.667 --> 01:03:15.110]  I mean, that is just... Regardless of what you think of Glenn Beck, the fact that he came out and said, look, all these Clinton and Obama people are talking about how great an Oklahoma City or 9-11 would be, and they're putting out all these memos saying it's going to be Patriots' fault, and Glenn said he's being blamed.
[01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:21.972]  In the George Soros, Media Matters, and a bunch of other publications, they say Glenn Beck and Alex Jones.
[01:03:23.168 --> 01:03:28.311]  They had some nut a few months ago have a shootout on the highway up by San Francisco.
[01:03:28.311 --> 01:03:33.155]  Said he was going to the Tides Foundation that Beck talks about all the time to kill people.
[01:03:33.155 --> 01:03:36.477]  And the media said that Glenn Beck and Alex Jones are causing it.
[01:03:36.477 --> 01:03:39.919]  He was fans of them and they're going to cause a new Oklahoma City.
[01:03:39.919 --> 01:03:41.940]  So yes, Beck, we've been warning you for months.
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:48.345]  They are framing you and I and every other person, whether you're a real patriot or not, just across the board.
[01:03:49.085 --> 01:03:50.825]  I don't know if you're a real patriot, pal.
[01:03:50.825 --> 01:03:52.086]  I know I am.
[01:03:52.086 --> 01:03:56.787]  But it's just like the MIAC and Homeland Security report a year and a half ago you made jokes about on air.
[01:03:56.787 --> 01:03:58.567]  You said, oh, maybe this is good.
[01:03:58.567 --> 01:04:00.728]  Maybe Ron Paul supporters might be dangerous.
[01:04:00.728 --> 01:04:02.188]  Maybe.
[01:04:02.188 --> 01:04:02.909]  Remember all that?
[01:04:02.909 --> 01:04:04.529]  And I got so angry at you, Beck.
[01:04:04.529 --> 01:04:05.749]  How do you like it?
[01:04:05.749 --> 01:04:11.351]  How do you like seeing them gear up to blow up something and blame it on us?
[01:04:11.351 --> 01:04:12.331]  How do you like it, buddy boy?
[01:04:14.244 --> 01:04:20.789]  How do you like neocon websites, multiple sites today attacking you saying you're a 9-11 truther?
[01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:25.612]  You've got Democratic operatives saying Obama needs a terror attack like Oklahoma City.
[01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:32.217]  You've got Soros' operatives saying that Glenn Beck and I are going to cause an Oklahoma City bombing every stinking day.
[01:04:32.217 --> 01:04:34.739]  Every day there's articles.
[01:04:34.739 --> 01:04:37.821]  They're out in the open saying what they're going to do.
[01:04:37.821 --> 01:04:43.385]  And you finally face reality and say you're being set up with another bombing.
[01:04:44.466 --> 01:04:47.169]  And you're called a 9-11 truther.
[01:04:47.169 --> 01:04:48.390]  How do you like that, pal?
[01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:56.318]  See, you're not supposed to talk about the big secret, like Gulf of Tonkin, Northwoods, and Ajax, and Gladio, and all these staged events.
[01:04:56.318 --> 01:04:59.501]  You're supposed to ignore that, Glenn, and let them blame it on you.
[01:05:01.462 --> 01:05:08.124]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:08.124 --> 01:05:13.265]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:13.265 --> 01:05:21.987]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:21.987 --> 01:05:26.048]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:05:26.048 --> 01:05:27.929]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:05:30.353 --> 01:05:35.074]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.

[01:08:23.942 --> 01:08:25.483]  That's coming up.
[01:08:25.483 --> 01:08:29.384]  We do have a search term today that I want to make number one.
[01:08:29.384 --> 01:08:31.825]  It's revolt against TSA.
[01:08:31.825 --> 01:08:36.107]  Just put that in Google and Yahoo and other major search engines over and over again.
[01:08:36.107 --> 01:08:38.648]  Revolt against TSA.
[01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:41.109]  That'll intensify the revolt.
[01:08:41.109 --> 01:08:43.050]  Up on screen, we'll show you the Drudge Report.
[01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:46.052]  DrudgeReport.com for the eighth day straight.
[01:08:46.052 --> 01:08:49.253]  You can see that top link at the very top.
[01:08:49.253 --> 01:08:51.314]  Pilots, passengers, rage.
[01:08:51.994 --> 01:09:04.958]  At New Naked Scanners, Pat Downs, and then you read the article, it's the travel associations, the hotel associations, the theme park associations, the heads of the biggest associations, the pilots associations, all in absolute revolt.
[01:09:04.958 --> 01:09:14.841]  See, they're trying to break our will, train us to put their hands on us, to take our blood at checkpoints, to take our baby's blood at birth, to force inoculations on us, and people are saying no, no, no.
[01:09:16.351 --> 01:09:18.833]  So nationwide revolt against the TSA.
[01:09:18.833 --> 01:09:22.195]  Big Sis forced to respond to nationwide revolt against TSA.
[01:09:22.195 --> 01:09:28.259]  Let's make revolt against TSA numero uno search term today.
[01:09:28.259 --> 01:09:29.920]  Let's do it together.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.823]  Alina in California, thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[01:09:33.823 --> 01:09:44.110]  Hey Alex, I just want to let you know that I am planning on flying to New York in the next week and I'm definitely going to be opting out of this naked body scanner.
[01:09:45.009 --> 01:09:49.133]  I've basically been word of mouth spreading that this is going on.
[01:09:49.133 --> 01:09:58.021]  And then opt out of the rape down because people are, and they admit, and I would tell them, look I know you're supposed to manhandle me to make me go to the scanner.
[01:09:58.021 --> 01:09:59.402]  Oh, that's the other big news.
[01:09:59.402 --> 01:10:01.584]  They admit that they're getting biometrics with them.
[01:10:01.584 --> 01:10:02.765]  Did you know that?
[01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:06.448]  Now, how is it that a guy can pat me down?
[01:10:06.448 --> 01:10:11.873]  I mean, not that a woman is any better, but that seems a little odd that if I do do the pat down.
[01:10:12.426 --> 01:10:14.126]  Why is it a guy can pat me down?
[01:10:14.126 --> 01:10:19.227]  I heard one of your workers talking about that, and how she noticed that.
[01:10:19.227 --> 01:10:21.868]  Yep, and the TSA has tried to deny that.
[01:10:21.868 --> 01:10:31.910]  Look, it's just as bad to have a woman do it, but societally it's seen as having, you know, a woman pat down a man, a man pat down a woman because then it's seen as more sexual because it's hard for it not to be sexual.
[01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:33.731]  Look, I am married.
[01:10:33.731 --> 01:10:34.631]  I love my wife.
[01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:35.371]  I'm into my wife.
[01:10:36.277 --> 01:10:42.779]  But before I was married, and still, I'm into my significant other, my wife, being into me.
[01:10:42.779 --> 01:10:52.523]  I'm not one of these people that, some people do like it when you're not into it, but I would not be able, to even a very attractive woman, I would be disgraced.
[01:10:52.523 --> 01:11:01.006]  I would be revolted by coming up and putting my hands between her legs and lifting up, they have to put pressure, and squeezing around a woman.
[01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:04.788]  I mean, that would totally traumatize me, not just the woman.
[01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.690]  I mean, it's just horrible.
[01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:12.672]  You know, I'm the type of guy that, you know, is out to eat with friends, and I'm the guy buying dinner and drinks.
[01:11:12.672 --> 01:11:14.554]  I like people to have pleasure.
[01:11:14.554 --> 01:11:16.295]  I like people to be happy.
[01:11:16.295 --> 01:11:17.616]  I enjoy that atmosphere.
[01:11:17.616 --> 01:11:24.080]  Who wants to work in a place humiliating people all day, bathing them in radiation, and grabbing their genitals?
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.701]  Well, you're gonna get either idiots,
[01:11:26.461 --> 01:11:36.644]  Desperate people or pedophiles control freaks gropers and it's been all over the news for years They single out the attractive women and I was witnessing it just a few weeks ago flying myself.
[01:11:36.644 --> 01:11:44.946]  Go ahead People are basically like you've always said on a power trip They have that suit on they got that wand and they're basically on a power trip in there.
[01:11:44.946 --> 01:11:50.668]  They're robots So they're there that you know, somebody's pulling their strings basically now I've posted
[01:11:52.529 --> 01:12:05.577]  Yeah, no, no, that's the normal response.
[01:12:05.577 --> 01:12:16.483]  You tell somebody 11 years ago, the Glass-Steagall Act will devalue the currency and give the bankers tens of trillions of dollars to buy up the economy, then they're going to implode it and set up a new global government.
[01:12:16.483 --> 01:12:17.724]  Oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:12:18.064 --> 01:12:23.788]  Now it's happening, and a lot of people still say it's a conspiracy theory, even when it's all over the newspapers.
[01:12:23.788 --> 01:12:25.008]  And it's the same thing with this.
[01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:33.114]  We are still seeing articles, and the TSA is saying, we do not touch your genitals, we do not squeeze your breast, even in their own press releases.
[01:12:33.934 --> 01:12:36.616]  Two and a half, three weeks ago they announced this.
[01:12:36.616 --> 01:12:41.740]  They told USA Today this, but now they're denying it even though it's on the news.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:42.861]  Video them of doing it.
[01:12:42.861 --> 01:12:53.308]  So what happens to the average coward who doesn't feel powerful or who likes to go along with tyranny because it makes them feel like they're part of the system, is they will just deny what you're even saying.
[01:12:53.308 --> 01:12:55.590]  That's the common knowledge.
[01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:56.491]  That's the common
[01:12:57.111 --> 01:12:57.952]  We're good to go.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.281]  You have the proof right in front of them.
[01:13:18.281 --> 01:13:19.202]  You could send them articles.
[01:13:19.202 --> 01:13:21.223]  I'm not going to do the research for them.
[01:13:21.223 --> 01:13:23.365]  Let's say you present this information to these people.
[01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:30.851]  They still want to call it conspiracy theories or Obama's great and I love what he's doing for the country, blah, blah, blah.
[01:13:30.851 --> 01:13:33.253]  It's so frustrating on my end.
[01:13:33.253 --> 01:13:35.354]  Just, you know, I do open my mouth a lot.
[01:13:35.354 --> 01:13:37.936]  I'm very outspoken and I post these things a lot.
[01:13:37.936 --> 01:13:38.657]  I spread the word.
[01:13:39.096 --> 01:13:42.779]  But still, you know, you get the backlash of, it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:13:42.779 --> 01:13:43.859]  Oh, you're lying.
[01:13:43.859 --> 01:13:45.641]  Oh, where are you getting your news information?
[01:13:45.641 --> 01:13:47.442]  Oh, Alex Jones is crazy.
[01:13:47.442 --> 01:14:02.192]  This and that, you know, it's just like, you know, that's one part, aspect of handling all of this is spreading the word and then dealing with the backlash and trying to protect my information, you know, and just like,
[01:14:03.104 --> 01:14:04.827]  Stay true to my integrity.
[01:14:21.684 --> 01:14:30.950]  People have bought into so many lies, so much humiliation, so much oppression, so much tyranny, that we have the biggest population of prisoners in the world.
[01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:36.634]  We are rapidly becoming one of the most tyrannical nations in the world by every university study that's out there.
[01:14:36.634 --> 01:14:39.976]  We're listed as number six in the world, worst police state.
[01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:48.162]  We have a government violating our rights, spying on us en masse, and people have decided this is okay because they don't want to be scared.
[01:14:48.162 --> 01:14:49.243]  They just want to say, it's okay.
[01:14:50.003 --> 01:15:03.626]  They lie to themselves, and so now that it's getting more obscene, more bizarre, more 1984, more Kafka-esque, more absurdist, they have to buy into it by denying it.
[01:15:03.626 --> 01:15:07.307]  And then, as it's proven to them, they'll say, oh, I guess that's okay.
[01:15:07.307 --> 01:15:08.187]  See?
[01:15:08.187 --> 01:15:09.968]  So this is how they operate.
[01:15:09.968 --> 01:15:11.728]  But just ignore them, move on.
[01:15:11.728 --> 01:15:12.448]  They're slaves.
[01:15:12.448 --> 01:15:13.349]  They want to be slaves.
[01:15:13.349 --> 01:15:14.229]  Sorry for them.
[01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:15.089]  They'll wake up later.
[01:15:15.089 --> 01:15:15.669]  Don't worry.
[01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:16.889]  Just plant the seeds.
[01:15:16.889 --> 01:15:17.890]  Josh in Georgia.
[01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:18.730]  Josh, you're on the air.
[01:15:19.454 --> 01:15:20.795]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:15:20.795 --> 01:15:22.656]  Good.
[01:15:22.656 --> 01:15:43.252]  I just wanted to let you know, this might sound a little odd, but just last night, I've never had a vision before, but I was watching the stars and it just hit me all of a sudden that, and I voiced this to my girlfriend who was with me, I said, I just had a vision and I feel like
[01:15:44.611 --> 01:15:50.593]  There's going to be a terrorist attack and they're going to stage it on the conservatives.
[01:15:50.593 --> 01:15:53.415]  It's going to be another Oklahoma City.
[01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:59.097]  And then I turned on your show today and you were talking about it.
[01:15:59.097 --> 01:16:01.678]  Oh, you didn't hear me talking about it yesterday, Josh?
[01:16:01.678 --> 01:16:02.018]  No, sir.
[01:16:03.106 --> 01:16:22.822]  Well, you know, scientific studies, literally thousands of them, have shown that they can have somebody in a room and somebody in another room a mile away watching them on CCTV camera and almost everyone, statistically, can tell when someone's watching them even over the CCTV camera.
[01:16:22.822 --> 01:16:31.750]  As soon as they're not watching them, the camera's on, the TV's on, but somebody a mile away, or sometimes even further away, you can tell when somebody's looking at you.
[01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:33.571]  Hi Alex, this is Charlie from Maui.
[01:16:49.491 --> 01:16:52.074]  First time caller, long time listener.
[01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:54.878]  I've got a few ideas on the naked body scanners.
[01:16:54.878 --> 01:17:06.672]  First of all, I think it's our demeanor, the people that listen to your show, when we go in there, we need to be proud, we need to stand proud and we need to say, I respectfully opt out.
[01:17:06.672 --> 01:17:07.994]  And we need to say it so that
[01:17:08.669 --> 01:17:10.550]  You know, everybody around us hears it.
[01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:13.972]  It's not them yelling, you know, we got an opt-out here.
[01:17:13.972 --> 01:17:15.393]  We have to be proud to opt out.
[01:17:15.393 --> 01:17:21.917]  Well, more than that, and it is important to be calm but authoritative and say, I'm not going to go through that.
[01:17:21.917 --> 01:17:24.918]  The New York Times reports it can and will give you cancer.
[01:17:24.918 --> 01:17:25.399]  The U.S.
[01:17:25.399 --> 01:17:31.082]  government's own, and I've quoted the agencies, admits this is very dangerous.
[01:17:31.082 --> 01:17:35.244]  It's very bad for you officers to be standing around these all day.
[01:17:35.244 --> 01:17:37.686]  And then when they start trying to do the pat-downs, say,
[01:17:38.286 --> 01:17:45.749]  Look, I know and everybody needs to know that they are ordered to do these pat-downs to intimidate us.
[01:17:45.749 --> 01:17:52.891]  Atlantic Monthly, AP and others report that they admit this is to intimidate us into going through the naked body scanner.
[01:17:52.891 --> 01:17:58.533]  And I would just want to add it's admitted that they're storing these images for biometric scans.
[01:17:59.761 --> 01:18:01.701]  See, they're already biometric scanners.
[01:18:01.701 --> 01:18:10.763]  Now what they admit is they want to add the software to them, now with your name and your scan attached, to put it in a database and apply the biometric digital overlay.
[01:18:10.763 --> 01:18:12.044]  They already have the image.
[01:18:12.044 --> 01:18:17.105]  It's like a digital photo at the DMV or a thumbprint, and then they apply the software.
[01:18:17.105 --> 01:18:20.065]  So they're already body scanners, now admitted, MarketWatch.
[01:18:20.065 --> 01:18:21.806]  That's Wall Street Journal division.
[01:18:22.881 --> 01:18:27.943]  Now reports this, as I've been telling you for two years, naked body scanners to store biometrics.
[01:18:27.943 --> 01:18:37.887]  See, I happen to know that the companies involved originally sold these twelve years ago and failed ten, twelve years ago, ten years ago, and then again five years ago they tried to push it.
[01:18:37.887 --> 01:18:39.108]  They've had different waves.
[01:18:39.108 --> 01:18:46.811]  For high-end clothiers, you go into that Brooks Brothers, you go into that Prada store, those are two that looked at doing it, and
[01:18:47.671 --> 01:18:50.633]  You step into a scanner, and then I went and researched it.
[01:18:50.633 --> 01:18:51.793]  It's a biometric scanner.
[01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:53.234]  It's a 360 scan of your body.
[01:18:53.234 --> 01:18:54.615]  It's a naked body scanner.
[01:18:54.615 --> 01:18:57.576]  And then it supposedly gives you the ultimate tailoring.
[01:18:57.576 --> 01:19:06.701]  Then a factory with computers, with, you know, robot sewing systems, then makes your suit exactly tailored to you.
[01:19:06.701 --> 01:19:08.942]  So I already knew these were biometric.
[01:19:08.942 --> 01:19:09.862]  And now it's admitted.
[01:19:09.862 --> 01:19:11.043]  So what do you think of them apples?
[01:19:12.301 --> 01:19:27.135]  Well, the second idea I have is maybe you guys could put out a sheet or something that we could pass out like 3x5 size cards that we could cut out of an 8 and a half by 11 that gives the passengers around us
[01:19:27.815 --> 01:19:36.844]  Uh, you know, they might think of us as terrorists if we did that, but that explains to the other passengers... Oh yeah, terrorists who communicate through the First Amendment.
[01:19:36.844 --> 01:19:44.412]  Yeah, I think it's fine, once you get through the gate, too, to just hand out business cards that have, like, ten facts on them and a website on the back, and say,
[01:19:45.453 --> 01:19:47.554]  This is what's going on, but the revolt is on.
[01:19:47.554 --> 01:19:49.174]  Beautiful idea.
[01:19:49.174 --> 01:19:50.555]  Anything else, Charlie?
[01:19:50.555 --> 01:19:59.759]  Yeah, the third idea is I saw a YouTube video about a guy who called Disney and said he could not bring his family to the Walt Disney Resort.
[01:19:59.759 --> 01:20:00.539]  Everybody should call.
[01:20:01.929 --> 01:20:05.931]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:20:43.752 --> 01:20:46.753]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:21:04.338 --> 01:21:09.199]  Eighteen years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:21:09.199 --> 01:21:15.361]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:21:15.361 --> 01:21:17.782]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:21:17.782 --> 01:21:23.883]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:21:23.883 --> 01:21:27.284]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:21:27.284 --> 01:21:29.164]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:21:29.164 --> 01:21:31.165]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[01:22:00.103 --> 01:22:04.027]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.

[01:23:00.003 --> 01:23:02.384]  A new way to improve your health has arrived.
[01:23:02.384 --> 01:23:07.827]  Your body's primary nutrient for detoxification and antioxidant power is glutathione.
[01:23:07.827 --> 01:23:13.070]  Glutathione mops up heavy metals and toxins of all kinds and carries them to the liver for elimination.
[01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:17.072]  Glutathione neutralizes free radicals, which keeps your cells younger and stops inflammation.
[01:23:17.512 --> 01:23:18.233]  We're good to go!
[01:23:38.536 --> 01:23:46.885]  This miraculous whey protein powder supplies your body with the nutrient power to increase your glutathione production by as much as 64% or more.
[01:23:46.885 --> 01:23:51.289]  The increase in strength, energy and well-being can be pronounced and amazing.
[01:23:51.289 --> 01:23:51.670]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:51.670 --> 01:23:51.890]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:52.971]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:24:11.061 --> 01:24:12.445]  I don't think so.
[01:24:27.076 --> 01:24:28.437]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[01:24:28.437 --> 01:24:38.563]  Everybody should make YouTube videos of calling Disney World, Disneyland, calling other theme parks, Six Flags, hotels, and saying, I was coming.
[01:24:38.563 --> 01:24:53.932]  Listen, I would have definitely taken my wife and children to Florida like I went when I was a child to rent a little sailboat and take them out in the bays to go fishing, to go snorkeling.
[01:24:53.932 --> 01:24:54.413]  Won't do it.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.741]  And look, I told my wife, I said, honey, if you want to do it, we'll do it.
[01:24:58.741 --> 01:25:00.541]  She's like, no, I don't want them touching the kids.
[01:25:00.541 --> 01:25:02.382]  This goes back years ago.
[01:25:02.382 --> 01:25:04.142]  And now there's no way.
[01:25:04.142 --> 01:25:06.003]  And the globalists want that.
[01:25:06.003 --> 01:25:07.784]  But that's the people at the top.
[01:25:07.784 --> 01:25:14.866]  Lower down, people in industry and business and who are involved in tourism, they do not want it.
[01:25:14.866 --> 01:25:16.466]  And that's how we're going to beat this.
[01:25:16.466 --> 01:25:22.648]  But if the globalists are ever able to shut the economy down, then they won't have all these middle class groups lobbying for freedom.
[01:25:23.775 --> 01:25:25.837]  So how do you like tyranny, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:25:25.837 --> 01:25:30.141]  Ralph in Arizona, then Ricky, Fiat Dollars, Nate, Caesar, and others.
[01:25:30.141 --> 01:25:30.921]  Ralph, you're on the air.
[01:25:30.921 --> 01:25:33.203]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:25:33.203 --> 01:25:33.824]  I'm doing great.
[01:25:33.824 --> 01:25:34.805]  We're having a big effect.
[01:25:35.675 --> 01:25:36.656]  I know you are!
[01:25:36.656 --> 01:25:37.336]  I know you are!
[01:25:37.336 --> 01:25:37.996]  You are!
[01:25:37.996 --> 01:25:38.577]  You are!
[01:25:38.577 --> 01:25:40.238]  You are, Ralph!
[01:25:40.238 --> 01:25:41.278]  I know.
[01:25:41.278 --> 01:25:42.679]  Hey, uh, Alex.
[01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:43.139]  Yes?
[01:25:43.139 --> 01:25:44.480]  I don't know how to convey this.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:50.323]  I'm a little nervous, but, uh, I got my amateur radio license about 15 years ago.
[01:25:50.323 --> 01:25:53.045]  I was there at Ruby Ridge, Waco.
[01:25:53.045 --> 01:25:56.487]  We had communications all the way back to Rhode Island.
[01:25:56.487 --> 01:25:58.528]  We knew what they were doing then.
[01:25:58.528 --> 01:26:04.291]  I don't know how to convey it to you, but now they dropped the Morse Code requirements to get your license.
[01:26:04.952 --> 01:26:19.181]  And you could have, and your listeners could have, uh, with a little bit of, uh, testing, an amateur radio license, you could have a radio in your car when you go home at night, say, at the end of the show, say, hey, I'll meet you on 14278.
[01:26:21.495 --> 01:26:23.676]  And you'll have 20,000 people around the world.
[01:26:23.676 --> 01:26:25.257]  And let me say this.
[01:26:25.257 --> 01:26:29.119]  In the last decade, the government hasn't moved away from shortwave.
[01:26:29.119 --> 01:26:33.802]  They've moved more to the ham radio systems as their emergency backup.
[01:26:33.802 --> 01:26:44.727]  And if they ever shut the web down or pull some crisis, it's going to be the shortwave radios, both amateur and then I'm also in 100,000 watt WWCR, that are still going to be getting the info out.
[01:26:44.727 --> 01:26:47.649]  That's what they'll try to shut down last because they're on it.
[01:26:47.649 --> 01:26:49.090]  Great points, Ralph.
[01:26:49.090 --> 01:26:49.510]  Anything else?
[01:26:50.256 --> 01:26:54.059]  Yeah, it's so easy to get your license now.
[01:26:54.059 --> 01:26:56.381]  The equipment is relatively cheap.
[01:26:56.381 --> 01:26:57.401]  It's small.
[01:26:57.401 --> 01:26:59.723]  It fits in your car with no problem.
[01:26:59.723 --> 01:27:02.585]  You get a tower in your backyard.
[01:27:02.585 --> 01:27:07.169]  You can run legally a kilowatt and a half.
[01:27:07.169 --> 01:27:14.274]  I don't know how to put this, how important it is for the patriot movement
[01:27:14.833 --> 01:27:16.333]  Hey Alex, I'm fired up!
[01:27:16.333 --> 01:27:18.294]  I wanted to tell you I had an experience.
[01:27:18.294 --> 01:27:20.934]  Actually, first of all, I want to tell you I was in the Navy.
[01:27:20.934 --> 01:27:21.955]  I've been a veteran for six years.
[01:27:42.982 --> 01:27:52.806]  And I've been in the Navy for six years, and we were doing exercises off the coast of California and the Catalina Islands.
[01:27:52.806 --> 01:28:03.891]  So it's no surprise to me that the Navy has some kind of hand in all this fire missile tests.
[01:28:03.891 --> 01:28:11.794]  We were actually doing exercises about firing missiles off the coast of the Catalina Islands.
[01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:27.002]  And we had, I don't remember if we had submarines with us or not, but it's just kind of a coincidence that this story blew up so big, and I noticed that there's a distinct coincidence to that.
[01:28:27.002 --> 01:28:32.206]  I also wanted to talk about the TSA incidences and the horror stories.
[01:28:32.206 --> 01:28:36.070]  Right after I got out of the Navy, which was in July of 06,
[01:28:37.334 --> 01:28:40.535]  Um, uh, another coincidence had happened.
[01:28:40.535 --> 01:28:48.137]  I went to the wrong gate and, um, uh, the TSA had introduced me to a body scanner and I had no idea.
[01:28:48.137 --> 01:28:52.758]  Yeah, they first put them in in 2002, but only at six airports.
[01:28:52.758 --> 01:28:54.078]  My horror story.
[01:28:54.078 --> 01:28:57.379]  So they put me in to the body scanner.
[01:28:57.379 --> 01:28:58.839]  First of all, they want me down.
[01:28:59.318 --> 01:29:11.657]  And then they put me through the body scanner and they say, okay, well now we're going to pick you out and choose you to subject you for a body scan or for a back room check.
[01:29:11.657 --> 01:29:12.458]  And so here I am.
[01:29:13.872 --> 01:29:21.638]  Uh, a veteran in my uniform, uh, why it's a second-class petty officer who has, um, had the greatest experience in the world.
[01:29:21.638 --> 01:29:23.500]  What'd they do, take your pants down?
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.702]  Hell yeah, uh, excuse my language, I'm sorry.
[01:29:25.702 --> 01:29:37.231]  Heck yeah, Alex, they, they, uh... Yeah, they're now talking about Al-Qaeda having bombs inside their body, uh, the, you know, the two different openings on a woman and the one on a man, and so they're getting ready for the, uh,
[01:29:37.771 --> 01:29:39.933]  Hey, get your five-year-old daughter in here.
[01:29:39.933 --> 01:29:41.994]  We got a pervert who wants to have their way with them.
[01:29:41.994 --> 01:29:44.776]  Finish your story briefly on the other side, then Wayne Madsen.
[01:29:44.776 --> 01:29:45.196]  Stay with us.
[01:29:45.196 --> 01:29:45.857]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:45.857 --> 01:29:51.461]  Stay there.
[01:29:51.461 --> 01:29:52.862]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.862 --> 01:29:55.384]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.384 --> 01:29:58.086]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.035 --> 01:30:05.578]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.578 --> 01:30:06.499]  Number one.
[01:30:06.499 --> 01:30:09.921]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.921 --> 01:30:10.782]  Number two.
[01:30:10.782 --> 01:30:15.685]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.685 --> 01:30:16.425]  It's true.
[01:30:16.425 --> 01:30:21.289]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:21.289 --> 01:30:22.129]  Number three.
[01:30:22.129 --> 01:30:25.711]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.711 --> 01:30:29.394]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.614 --> 01:30:30.394]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.394 --> 01:30:33.155]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:33.155 --> 01:30:36.837]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.837 --> 01:30:37.637]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.637 --> 01:30:41.779]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.779 --> 01:30:46.841]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:51.002]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:51.002 --> 01:30:52.803]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.803 --> 01:30:57.385]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:31:01.148 --> 01:31:04.732]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:31:04.732 --> 01:31:06.033]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:31:06.033 --> 01:31:10.437]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:31:10.437 --> 01:31:16.383]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:31:16.383 --> 01:31:18.525]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:31:18.525 --> 01:31:21.208]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.

[01:32:04.670 --> 01:32:05.931]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.931 --> 01:32:09.812]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.812 --> 01:32:12.113]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:12.113 --> 01:32:17.975]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:32:17.975 --> 01:32:24.197]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.637 --> 01:32:30.581]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.581 --> 01:32:34.784]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.784 --> 01:32:39.086]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:45.030]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:48.592]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.592 --> 01:32:50.553]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.553 --> 01:32:50.994]  It's here.

[01:32:59.659 --> 01:33:01.580]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:02.961]  A lie!
[01:33:02.961 --> 01:33:04.942]  No man is obsolete!
[01:33:04.942 --> 01:33:06.824]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:06.824 --> 01:33:10.066]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[01:33:10.066 --> 01:33:15.169]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[01:33:15.529 --> 01:33:23.374]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect, an ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[01:33:23.374 --> 01:33:24.895]  I am a human being!
[01:33:24.895 --> 01:33:32.620]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:33.761]  I don't care!
[01:33:33.761 --> 01:33:34.781]  I tell you, I don't care!
[01:33:34.781 --> 01:33:36.362]  I'm a human being!
[01:33:36.362 --> 01:33:36.863]  I exist!
[01:33:37.935 --> 01:33:44.079]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[01:33:44.079 --> 01:33:47.242]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:33:47.242 --> 01:33:54.927]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[01:33:54.927 --> 01:34:00.291]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and mistake has no use for your kind!
[01:34:01.929 --> 01:34:06.050]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:06.050 --> 01:34:10.311]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:10.311 --> 01:34:13.692]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:13.692 --> 01:34:18.374]  And I've got all these different news articles.
[01:34:20.768 --> 01:34:29.672]  Like the one in the Daily Mail, the uninvited guest, Chinese sub pops up in middle of US Navy exercise, leaving military chiefs red-faced.
[01:34:29.672 --> 01:34:30.152]  Remember that?
[01:34:30.152 --> 01:34:33.573]  November 2007.
[01:34:33.573 --> 01:34:44.378]  And we know that the Chinese military has been saber-rattling against the United States because the United States is run by the offshore bankers who sold all the fake derivatives and the fake mortgage stocks
[01:34:44.918 --> 01:34:45.599]  To them.
[01:34:45.599 --> 01:34:47.641]  I'm not saying the Communist Chinese are good.
[01:34:47.641 --> 01:34:51.725]  The point is, is that they own over a trillion dollars of T-bills.
[01:34:51.725 --> 01:34:55.508]  Their ministers have delisted the U.S.
[01:34:55.508 --> 01:34:56.349]  bond rating.
[01:34:56.349 --> 01:34:58.951]  They've lowered it twice in the last year.
[01:34:58.951 --> 01:35:01.494]  Once this week.
[01:35:01.494 --> 01:35:03.235]  All of this is happening.
[01:35:03.235 --> 01:35:07.219]  But I do respect Wayne Madsen, who of course
[01:35:09.059 --> 01:35:16.167]  Worked in the Navy, worked for RCA, the National Security Agency, Naval Data Automation Command.
[01:35:17.757 --> 01:35:26.280]  Of course, he's written for some of the biggest national publications out there, and just so much of what he's covered here just turns out, in hindsight, later to come out.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:37.025]  I mean, he comes on first and says it's an Israeli company spying on citizens in Pennsylvania, and the director's going to have to step down.
[01:35:37.025 --> 01:35:39.446]  And then it came out three days later, mainstream news, that was true.
[01:35:39.446 --> 01:35:40.486]  I mean, it's just so many things.
[01:35:40.486 --> 01:35:42.227]  People are like, oh, Madsen's making that up.
[01:35:43.327 --> 01:35:45.008]  Uh, no, I don't think he is.
[01:35:45.008 --> 01:35:52.133]  And I know that when I watch C-SPAN and see national security hearings, or when I watch the press club on C-SPAN, I always see Madsen in the crowd.
[01:35:52.133 --> 01:35:56.536]  Always there, you know, with all these sources, his ear to the ground.
[01:35:56.536 --> 01:36:00.219]  Now, we've had a lot of people ask us the last four days, what happened with this missile?
[01:36:01.052 --> 01:36:01.312]  I don't know.
[01:36:25.276 --> 01:36:25.376]  Okay.
[01:36:56.142 --> 01:37:01.369]  China has been very aggressive recently in South China and the Yellow Seas.
[01:37:01.369 --> 01:37:05.094]  We know about the incidents between the Japanese and the Chinese.
[01:37:05.094 --> 01:37:09.140]  The Japanese are keeping a very close eye on the Chinese Navy.
[01:37:10.154 --> 01:37:15.917]  The Chinese have an underground submarine base on the south coast of Hainan Island.
[01:37:15.917 --> 01:37:19.618]  People might recall Hainan Island from two previous incidents.
[01:37:19.618 --> 01:37:27.842]  In 2001, when the Navy spy plane was forced to land on Hainan Island.
[01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:30.503]  Wayne, we're having cell phone problems with you.
[01:37:30.503 --> 01:37:32.864]  We're going to disconnect and call you back, okay?
[01:37:32.864 --> 01:37:34.085]  Okay.
[01:37:34.085 --> 01:37:37.386]  Are you on hands-free?
[01:37:37.386 --> 01:37:38.667]  I'm not on hands-free, no.
[01:37:39.588 --> 01:37:40.049]  Okay, wait a minute.
[01:37:40.049 --> 01:37:41.472]  Your phone just came back.
[01:37:41.472 --> 01:37:44.117]  The first part, the first of what you said got cut off.
[01:37:44.117 --> 01:37:47.725]  I believe you said the Chinese Navy has been very aggressive lately.
[01:37:47.725 --> 01:37:48.847]  Your phone's now better.
[01:37:48.847 --> 01:37:49.889]  Recap what you just said.
[01:37:50.789 --> 01:38:03.017]  Well, the Chinese Navy, people might recall two incidents off the Hainan Island, which is where an underground Chinese submarine base is located.
[01:38:03.017 --> 01:38:09.701]  These submarines leave underwater undetected and go back into their underground base undetected.
[01:38:09.701 --> 01:38:11.342]  They're not forced to surface.
[01:38:11.342 --> 01:38:17.046]  So, we had in 2001 the Navy spy plane and had the altercation with the Chinese MiG.
[01:38:17.827 --> 01:38:20.153]  In fact, going back nine years, didn't they even ram it?
[01:38:25.768 --> 01:38:30.949]  Well, yeah, they hit it with a MiG.
[01:38:30.949 --> 01:38:38.891]  And then just last year we had what's called a Surface Towed Array Surveillance System ship, a U.S.
[01:38:38.891 --> 01:38:44.753]  Navy ship, called the Impeccable, was harassed off of Hainan Island.
[01:38:44.753 --> 01:38:49.054]  This is a ship that detects submarines specifically in that area.
[01:38:49.054 --> 01:38:52.675]  And by the way, I would add, you were a Navy man first yourself.
[01:38:53.682 --> 01:38:59.864]  Well, I worked in the sound surveillance system for over seven years in both Atlantic and Pacific.
[01:38:59.864 --> 01:39:06.846]  I was an anti-submarine warfare officer and a certified integrated undersea surveillance officer.
[01:39:06.846 --> 01:39:16.309]  So, A, you didn't just work for the NSA, you worked in anti-submarine warfare for the Navy in some of the most secret areas.
[01:39:16.309 --> 01:39:21.751]  B, you now have these sources in Washington, so you're a very credible source to be able to speak on this.
[01:39:21.751 --> 01:39:22.291]  Please continue.
[01:39:22.978 --> 01:39:31.024]  Yeah, and what we did with SOSIS, and I have to say, people will say we have the capability now to track submarines.
[01:39:31.024 --> 01:39:33.906]  Well, we've curtailed that capability.
[01:39:33.906 --> 01:39:39.770]  We used to have a vast array of undersea acoustic hydrophones.
[01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:50.818]  We only have two bases left, one at Whitby Island in Washington State, and the other at Dam Neck, Virginia, and only five of these SIRTAS ships, one of which I mentioned was harassed by the Chinese,
[01:39:56.740 --> 01:40:03.503]  So this is going back to the Cold War, but now our country doesn't have the submarines or the ships that they did.
[01:40:03.503 --> 01:40:14.747]  There was constant harassment and tag and subs shadowing carriers, our Navy SEALs going in from subs, cutting undersea cables.
[01:40:14.747 --> 01:40:16.888]  I mean, this has been a long-term Cold War, correct?
[01:40:17.088 --> 01:40:41.879]  Oh, absolutely, and I remember once when I was stationed at the SOSUS base in Coos Bay, Oregon, we actually had a Soviet-victored pre-nuclear submarine surface off the coast, 30 miles off the coast, about the same area where it's figured that this Chinese submarine may have launched this missile that actually headed northwest and probably impacted in China, just as a test.
[01:40:42.679 --> 01:40:49.162]  And also a message to the United States, if you're going to play in our waters, in the Yellow Sea and South China Sea, guess what?
[01:40:49.162 --> 01:40:51.583]  We can do the same thing.
[01:40:51.583 --> 01:41:04.128]  I also understand that the National Security Agency may have intercepted telemetry from that Chinese missile, so they know the Pentagon knows, the Chinese have no vested interest in having the public know.
[01:41:04.688 --> 01:41:16.891]  All that matters to them is that Obama knew right before he met President Hu in Seoul, and he's going to meet him again in Tokyo at the APEC conference, and that's the only people that need to know.
[01:41:16.891 --> 01:41:24.373]  They're happy with that situation, and I believe that with the incidents we had between Soviet and American submarines during the Cold War,
[01:41:26.014 --> 01:41:30.056]  Obama probably talked to the Chinese President and said, okay, you proved your point.
[01:41:30.056 --> 01:41:33.017]  Let's not exacerbate these tensions.
[01:41:33.017 --> 01:41:34.118]  Let's keep it quiet.
[01:41:34.118 --> 01:41:42.562]  And then it took a day and a half for the Pentagon to start trotting out these newly minted experts, including from the Discovery Channel of all places.
[01:41:42.562 --> 01:41:47.465]  People that claim, oh, it was an airplane, it was a U.S.
[01:41:47.465 --> 01:41:49.986]  Airways flight from Honolulu to Florida.
[01:41:50.126 --> 01:41:58.618]  Well, Wayne, we've posted the videos the last three days of former generals and experts in this saying it was a missile show.
[01:41:58.618 --> 01:42:00.621]  I guess those were people that they couldn't control.
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:02.201]  Right.
[01:42:02.201 --> 01:42:13.049]  The editor of Jane's Missile publication in London stated that as far as he was concerned, it looked like a submarine-launched ballistic missile.
[01:42:13.049 --> 01:42:20.054]  Now, when I was in the Navy, we had a lot of intelligence sources, but you know what we used as our major reference?
[01:42:20.054 --> 01:42:24.257]  Jane's is the global premier encyclopedia for all things weapons.
[01:42:24.697 --> 01:42:25.337]  Absolutely.
[01:42:25.337 --> 01:42:30.899]  When there was a question asked, we would opt for James over even our own Navy Intelligence.
[01:42:30.899 --> 01:42:34.900]  We figured James was right and some of our intelligence may not have been correct.
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:46.623]  So with all that, and of course now we have all these so-called experts coming out of the woodwork claiming, oh no, it was a contrail from a commercial airplane.
[01:42:46.623 --> 01:42:49.404]  Well anyone that looked at that knows that with the
[01:42:51.704 --> 01:42:56.367]  The plume, uh, very few contrails look like that.
[01:42:56.367 --> 01:43:02.451]  That was actually, you saw, you saw the Booneburg Trail because that suddenly was fired from underwater.
[01:43:02.451 --> 01:43:06.174]  So, uh, there was not, it was not on the surface.
[01:43:06.174 --> 01:43:11.017]  And we've seen, just take a look at some of the Polaris missile shots and look at the similarities.
[01:43:11.517 --> 01:43:16.639]  Now we're told, oh, well, there's similar contrails off of JFK in New York and off of Florida.
[01:43:16.639 --> 01:43:18.280]  Well, isn't Photoshop wonderful?
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:27.624]  Because if you look at those contrails, it looks like they took the contrail from off of California and superimposed it on pictures from other locations.
[01:43:41.409 --> 01:43:50.472]  Navy missile testing in the past right off the coast and a few weeks before they did tell the FAA that they would be doing some drills.
[01:43:50.472 --> 01:43:52.433]  What's your intel in Washington telling you?
[01:43:52.433 --> 01:43:55.774]  I mean, are you getting other intel that this was the Chinese?
[01:43:55.774 --> 01:43:56.094]  Right.
[01:43:56.094 --> 01:44:03.076]  What you're talking about is a notice to... It's called a notice to airmen and NOTAM.
[01:44:03.636 --> 01:44:20.840]  They release those periodically to say, look, it is known that the Navy or the Air Force is conducting, or NASA conducting, missile tests in these areas off Wallops Island, off of Virginia, off Point Magoo, and in California, in Southern California.
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:22.781]  That's just standard procedure.
[01:44:22.781 --> 01:44:28.062]  It's not saying that we're... Because the Navy and Air Force said that it was not any of their missile tests.
[01:44:28.542 --> 01:44:30.723]  They came right out in the beginning and said that.
[01:44:30.723 --> 01:44:37.486]  The FAA said that was not a plane that had taken off from LAX or any other airport in the area.
[01:44:37.486 --> 01:44:42.428]  So it took, of course, it took the Pentagon, like I say, a day and a half.
[01:44:42.428 --> 01:44:47.971]  But I would note that I see a lot of skepticism now from some of the Pentagon correspondents
[01:44:48.531 --> 01:44:51.212]  Let's look at the geopolitical ramifications.
[01:44:51.212 --> 01:44:58.336]  You have the Chinese military in the last three months saying they're openly getting on a war footing and are very quote angry at the Pentagon.
[01:45:13.223 --> 01:45:21.309]  You have the head of the Chinese central bank coming out and downgrading US treasuries.
[01:45:21.309 --> 01:45:26.713]  You have the Chinese government saying it's horrible what they're doing devaluing the dollar.
[01:45:26.713 --> 01:45:30.035]  You've got the Brazilian head of the finance minister
[01:45:30.896 --> 01:45:34.801]  The German finance minister, the French finance minister.
[01:45:34.801 --> 01:45:35.822]  I mean, it's countless.
[01:45:35.822 --> 01:45:40.989]  It's literally scores of articles every day, official press releases.
[01:45:40.989 --> 01:45:44.894]  Obama is being excoriated at the G20.
[01:45:44.894 --> 01:45:45.815]  Meanwhile, he's doing press...
[01:45:46.596 --> 01:45:48.917]  Conference is saying we're helping the world.
[01:45:48.917 --> 01:45:50.918]  Everyone's happy.
[01:45:50.918 --> 01:45:53.099]  Totally lying.
[01:45:53.099 --> 01:45:56.521]  Just ball-faced in front of everyone.
[01:45:56.521 --> 01:46:00.042]  The Federal Reserve is accelerating this currency war.
[01:46:00.042 --> 01:46:05.264]  Herman Van Rompuy has announced at the G20, nation-states are dead, EU chief says.
[01:46:05.264 --> 01:46:07.826]  The belief that countries can stand alone is a lie and an illusion.
[01:46:08.846 --> 01:46:12.368]  These offshore banks have engineered this fiat system.
[01:46:12.368 --> 01:46:13.309]  They've used the U.S.
[01:46:13.309 --> 01:46:14.610]  as one of their main bases.
[01:46:14.610 --> 01:46:16.111]  And now, globally, the U.S.
[01:46:16.111 --> 01:46:21.094]  is being blamed for the private IMF and World Bank and what the six big banks have done.
[01:46:21.094 --> 01:46:22.474]  I mean, we're really being scapegoated.
[01:46:22.474 --> 01:46:33.401]  And if you're right, as a lot of other military sources are saying, that this was some type of missile similar to North Korea routinely firing missiles over Japan publicly to menace them.
[01:46:33.401 --> 01:46:36.023]  This is an incredible escalation, and it's similar
[01:46:36.463 --> 01:46:50.372]  To Dick Cheney during the Olympics on 888 and George W. Bush launching the attack on South Ossetia and Abkhazia, now confirmed, saying that Russia had done it and launching it while they're meeting with Putin.
[01:46:50.372 --> 01:46:57.077]  So I guess this is something, and we know that now happened, so it's like a threatening brinksmanship of, you want World War III, pal?
[01:46:57.077 --> 01:46:58.878]  I mean, is that what you're saying the Chinese have done?
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:13.037]  Well, I think primarily China wanted to send a message to us, look, you keep playing in the South China Sea, and Hillary was rattling some stabers about the islands that China claims down there, the Paracel and the Spratly Islands.
[01:47:13.037 --> 01:47:14.760]  Yeah, they're fighting with the Japanese over that.
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:19.785]  And up in the Yellow Sea, they're fighting over some islands there.
[01:47:19.785 --> 01:47:20.646]  With Russia?
[01:47:20.646 --> 01:47:31.117]  Primarily, this is a Chinese military telling the Chinese government, look, you better take a stand here because if the U.S.
[01:47:31.117 --> 01:47:35.281]  thinks it can play in our waters, we have to demonstrate to them that we can play in theirs.
[01:47:35.481 --> 01:47:35.741]  I don't
[01:47:55.335 --> 01:47:57.257]  All those C-130s landing with U.S.
[01:47:57.257 --> 01:48:02.201]  troops and mercenaries pulled out, and now we've got U.S.
[01:48:02.201 --> 01:48:16.992]  and other ships all around China doing these drills with Japan and South Korea, and so I guess China's saying two can play at that game, because we know our government's been doing missile tests off the coast of China, so I guess this is just turnabout as fair play?
[01:48:17.592 --> 01:48:30.615]  Oh, absolutely, and I think primarily this was a military response by the Chinese, but I think what you said about the economic situation, this was the perfect storm to make a demonstration like that.
[01:48:30.615 --> 01:48:34.635]  So, I think there's a lot of things that played into this decision.
[01:48:34.635 --> 01:48:42.877]  So, the Chinese dispatched a gen-class nuclear ballistic missile, nuclear submarine, they may have one or two of those.
[01:48:43.337 --> 01:49:00.540]  And frankly, we also know that the previous submarines that they had of the same type, ballistic missile submarines, were very noisy, but the Chinese, being such a high-tech power, they know how to quiet these down, just like the Soviets and the Russians were able to quiet their submarines.
[01:49:01.971 --> 01:49:12.117]  Well, reportedly though, Wayne, and I mean, you were a submariner and somebody who worked on all this sonar and surveillance, but just from my research in Janes and other places, the Chinese don't care.
[01:49:12.117 --> 01:49:17.540]  They'll run into channels with a bunch of traffic and routinely pop up right behind with their diesels.
[01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:18.301]  They just don't care.
[01:49:18.621 --> 01:49:23.164]  Yeah, well they had a diesel-electric, as you mentioned, that popped up right in the middle of a U.S.
[01:49:23.164 --> 01:49:44.538]  Navy task group about the same time that this incident takes place, but it was the USS Kitty Hawk, and the whole purpose of those task force, the other ships are supposed to protect the aircraft carrier, so obviously we have a problem with our anti-submarine warfare detection capabilities, and also remember, Wilmstown's pet project, the Ballistic Missile Defense System,
[01:49:44.978 --> 01:49:50.480]  Star Wars 2, they sunk billions into that, and this also shows, well, that money was wasted.
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:57.002]  So, what the Pentagon's trying to do by covering this up is to protect a lot of heads from rolling.
[01:49:57.002 --> 01:50:03.085]  And, you know, one thing I know about the Navy, when they screw up, they're very good at one thing, they're very good at covering up.
[01:50:03.085 --> 01:50:09.127]  I don't think they were very good here because it took them a day and a half to start finding the newly minted experts.
[01:50:09.127 --> 01:50:12.328]  What are the other Navy people saying you're talking to on Capitol Hill?
[01:50:13.075 --> 01:50:22.443]  Well, some Navy sources are telling me absolutely it was a test firing of a Chinese submarine-launched ballistic missile.
[01:50:22.443 --> 01:50:25.346]  The Japanese intelligence are on to that, too.
[01:50:25.346 --> 01:50:29.890]  They've been keeping a close eye on what's happening in Hainan with the Chinese submarines.
[01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:31.371]  That's their conclusion.
[01:50:31.371 --> 01:50:33.513]  And I think we're going to see more people coming out.
[01:50:33.513 --> 01:50:39.678]  I think we're going to see leaks starting to filter out of the Pentagon very shortly.
[01:50:39.929 --> 01:50:44.191]  Because there's people who want to fix this problem, not engage in a cover-up.
[01:50:44.191 --> 01:50:55.436]  Absolutely, because, you know, you've got our Navy ships out there are vulnerable to these Chinese submarines, and obviously we have a problem in our detection capabilities.
[01:50:55.436 --> 01:50:56.056]  Wayne, stay there.
[01:50:56.056 --> 01:51:00.358]  I want to come back in a short segment and find out what else is on your radar of political import.
[01:51:01.499 --> 01:51:02.799]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.799 --> 01:51:08.381]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.381 --> 01:51:13.403]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.403 --> 01:51:18.445]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.985 --> 01:51:24.211]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.211 --> 01:51:31.319]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.319 --> 01:51:32.441]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.441 --> 01:51:38.808]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:39.108 --> 01:51:42.310]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:44.531]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:45.571 --> 01:51:49.113]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:49.113 --> 01:51:50.833]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.561 --> 01:52:02.664]  Pure water.

[01:53:03.573 --> 01:53:05.294]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:53:05.294 --> 01:53:07.836]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:53:07.836 --> 01:53:15.400]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:16.901]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:53:16.901 --> 01:53:19.643]  Don reports dramatic improvements with hardened body extract.
[01:53:19.643 --> 01:53:24.966]  I started taking hardened body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:53:24.966 --> 01:53:29.989]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:53:30.189 --> 01:53:35.291]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.

[01:53:44.994 --> 01:53:47.774]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[01:53:47.774 --> 01:53:52.496]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:52.496 --> 01:53:55.957]  Details at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:54:06.178 --> 01:54:11.260]  I'll say this in closing on the submarine missile story, and Wayne's probably right.
[01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:13.860]  I certainly believe he believes what he's saying.
[01:54:13.860 --> 01:54:15.981]  All the evidence points towards it.
[01:54:15.981 --> 01:54:24.244]  This is a very bold move and shows them way out of their hemisphere, but they see it as their territory because they're on the Pacific.
[01:54:25.084 --> 01:54:29.586]  And it fits with the rest of China's military posturing.
[01:54:29.586 --> 01:54:32.068]  And remember, this is who owns most of our debt.
[01:54:32.068 --> 01:54:36.210]  Wayne Madsen, what else is on your radar at WayneMadsenReport.com?
[01:54:36.792 --> 01:54:53.443]  Well, keeping the story in Asia, we know that President Obama postponed two trips to Indonesia where he spent some time when he was a young boy being raised by Lola Sotoro, his stepfather, and Donna, his mom.
[01:54:53.443 --> 01:54:59.607]  Now we have this report that came out that his nanny, who raised him in Jakarta, was
[01:55:01.047 --> 01:55:10.289]  A nanny by day, but apparently a transvestite member of a dance troupe called the Fantastic Dolls at night.
[01:55:10.289 --> 01:55:13.749]  His boyfriend was a local butcher in Jakarta.
[01:55:13.749 --> 01:55:15.890]  I think we're going to hear more of this.
[01:55:15.890 --> 01:55:23.411]  I think this is the reason why Obama really didn't want to go to Jakarta, because the Indonesian press is pretty good at this.
[01:55:23.411 --> 01:55:27.012]  But this story was picked up by both the Washington Post and the New York Times.
[01:55:27.772 --> 01:55:31.415]  Yeah, they're getting ready to dump all of their sins on their puppet Obama and sink him
[01:55:45.666 --> 01:55:52.552]  And we're now seeing former fellow Reserve Chief Greenspan and others talk about criminality in the banking system.
[01:55:52.552 --> 01:55:56.495]  We're now starting to see Glenn Beck claiming George Soros runs everything.
[01:55:56.495 --> 01:55:59.057]  He's behind the New World Order.
[01:55:59.057 --> 01:56:03.881]  They know they can't deny this anymore, so they're getting ready to flush a few of their puppets down the toilet.
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:05.941]  Well, I think so.
[01:56:05.941 --> 01:56:14.267]  We know that after the election, there's some key Democrats that are out basically saying, look, Obama, you can't run again.
[01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:16.828]  You've hurt the party severely.
[01:56:16.828 --> 01:56:20.671]  A lot of big-time, long-serving Democrats went down the tube.
[01:56:20.671 --> 01:56:26.435]  People like Rick Boucher from Virginia, Overstar from Minnesota.
[01:56:26.435 --> 01:56:27.796]  We had Ike Skelton,
[01:56:28.336 --> 01:56:33.479]  Yeah, they don't want Pelosi in there, so this is the message from the big liberal media.
[01:56:33.479 --> 01:56:36.900]  Hey, we'll talk about the freak shows, the trannies, the drugs.
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:40.462]  And it was all over the news this week that his name is Barry Sotaro.
[01:56:40.462 --> 01:56:42.223]  Suddenly, that's all over CNN.
[01:56:42.223 --> 01:56:43.583]  I mean, they're... Right.
[01:56:43.583 --> 01:56:47.825]  And that he was enrolled in that school in Jakarta as a Muslim.
[01:56:47.825 --> 01:56:50.507]  And that his mother didn't want him to pray, but he demanded it.
[01:56:51.184 --> 01:56:52.005]  Right, right.
[01:56:52.005 --> 01:56:54.467]  So, we're going to get more of this.
[01:56:54.467 --> 01:57:06.178]  The word I'm getting is that there's teams of people who might be working for those who want to try to get Obama dumped off the ticket in 2012.
[01:57:06.178 --> 01:57:16.307]  There's teams running around Indonesia, Kenya, and other places, Pakistan, and we're going to probably see a lot more exposés with Obama's background.
[01:57:17.188 --> 01:57:18.769]  Is her name Hillary and Bill Clinton?
[01:57:18.769 --> 01:57:21.810]  Because we know she left town for the election.
[01:57:21.810 --> 01:57:22.851]  Don't count them out.
[01:57:22.851 --> 01:57:28.054]  I understand that they're working overtime on collecting this data also, yes.
[01:57:28.054 --> 01:57:28.614]  Absolutely.
[01:57:29.511 --> 01:57:40.758]  So it's a lot of different people, not so much the neocons then, because he admits the cocaine, the heroin came out this week, and everything we've heard continues to get confirmed.
[01:57:40.758 --> 01:57:45.161]  The Barry Sitaro, the Tranny, now I guess the Larry Sinclair.
[01:57:45.161 --> 01:57:46.702]  I mean, it's just all going to come out.
[01:57:46.702 --> 01:57:50.704]  And wait until the second Blagojevich trial in Chicago.
[01:57:50.704 --> 01:57:56.588]  We're going to hear a lot more about Obama and a guy named Tony Rezko.
[01:57:56.588 --> 01:57:58.429]  So they're getting ready to flush their puppet.
[01:57:59.133 --> 01:58:18.150]  Yeah, I think what we're going to see is Obama, like an LBJ, saying, you know, the duties of office are so great, I will not serve, nor will I allow my name to be put in nomination for another term as your president, just like LBJ did in March of 68.
[01:58:18.150 --> 01:58:25.317]  Wayne Madsen, briefly, what's your take on Glenn Beck coming out and saying the government may blow up a building?
[01:58:26.218 --> 01:58:29.761]  Well, hey, the water's warm, Glenn.
[01:58:29.761 --> 01:58:36.567]  I'm happy you're finally seeing the light here, on both that and on George Soros.
[01:58:36.567 --> 01:58:39.730]  Alright, thank you so much, Wayne Madsen.
[01:58:39.730 --> 01:58:44.974]  Okay.
[01:58:44.974 --> 01:58:48.958]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:53.188 --> 01:58:57.151]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:58:57.151 --> 01:59:06.018]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:59:06.018 --> 01:59:10.642]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:59:10.642 --> 01:59:21.471]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:59:22.091 --> 01:59:31.594]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:59:31.594 --> 01:59:37.036]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:59:37.036 --> 01:59:44.519]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:59:44.519 --> 01:59:47.260]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:59:54.255 --> 01:59:56.637]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.637 --> 02:00:06.125]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.125 --> 02:00:07.426]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.426 --> 02:00:09.207]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.207 --> 02:00:10.968]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.968 --> 02:00:12.550]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:14.471]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.471 --> 02:00:18.274]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.274 --> 02:00:22.358]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.551 --> 02:00:27.512]  Well, a lot of weeks he spends an hour with us, or even two hours.
[02:00:27.512 --> 02:00:35.036]  Today we've just got him for 30 minutes, and I really appreciate Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com joining us every Friday.
[02:00:35.036 --> 02:00:44.661]  We've got Michael Braverman, one of the producers of the hit TV show Conspiracy Theory, what they think is the most important episode of this season, and I agree with them.
[02:00:44.661 --> 02:00:47.622]  FEMA cams confirmed the police state episode tonight.
[02:00:47.622 --> 02:00:48.343]  He's going to be on with us.
[02:00:48.823 --> 02:00:50.164]  In the last 20 minutes or so.
[02:00:50.164 --> 02:00:52.746]  So Bob will probably be with us 35-40 minutes.
[02:00:52.746 --> 02:00:57.030]  But going to Bob Chapman, we haven't gotten into all the economic news.
[02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:59.992]  It's all happening.
[02:00:59.992 --> 02:01:02.895]  The dollar devaluation, the Chinese are angry.
[02:01:02.895 --> 02:01:06.297]  Madsen thinks it was the Chinese threatening us with a missile test.
[02:01:06.297 --> 02:01:08.659]  Similar to what North Korea does with Japan.
[02:01:08.659 --> 02:01:12.543]  We've got the revolt against the TSA pat-downs and body scans.
[02:01:12.543 --> 02:01:13.543]  So much is happening.
[02:01:13.543 --> 02:01:17.587]  Bob Chapman, what is first and foremost on your radar screen right now?
[02:01:19.468 --> 02:01:29.435]  Well, it's the G20 meeting, and they're not having any success whatsoever as far as I know, and that will probably continue.
[02:01:29.435 --> 02:01:45.326]  I think in part, you have to look at the positions of the other countries who have really been cheating for years and years, and they want to continue to do so, but now that the dollar's gone down, they
[02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:47.610]  They want the cake and eat it too.
[02:01:47.610 --> 02:01:52.333]  They want the dollar to remain, we'll call it firm, and it's not happening.
[02:01:52.333 --> 02:01:56.016]  And they're still devaluing their currencies against one another.
[02:01:56.016 --> 02:01:58.318]  And that's what the currency war is all about.
[02:01:58.318 --> 02:02:04.982]  And what it's going to lead to, if they continue to do what they're doing, is a trade war.
[02:02:04.982 --> 02:02:12.047]  And quite frankly, that would be to the advantage of the United States, in as much as 432,000 companies
[02:02:14.941 --> 02:02:23.346]  And 8.5 million jobs with tariffs on goods and services just might decide to come home.
[02:02:23.346 --> 02:02:26.048]  And that would certainly help the American economy.
[02:02:26.048 --> 02:02:36.314]  So there's a little glimmer of light in there, and as you know, Paul Craig Roberts agrees with me on that, and not very many other people do.
[02:02:36.314 --> 02:02:40.377]  As far as the meeting's concerned, they're just getting nowhere.
[02:02:40.377 --> 02:02:42.658]  The dollar's been firm, but that's because
[02:02:43.208 --> 02:02:43.668]  The U.S.
[02:02:43.668 --> 02:02:46.569]  government is in the market driving it up.
[02:02:46.569 --> 02:02:49.590]  And they're in the market knocking gold and silver down.
[02:02:49.590 --> 02:02:51.011]  And that's okay.
[02:02:51.011 --> 02:02:52.972]  We would have had a correction anyway.
[02:02:52.972 --> 02:02:56.213]  And the correction in all likelihood is probably over.
[02:02:56.213 --> 02:02:59.814]  We've had two dips here in the last four or five days.
[02:02:59.814 --> 02:03:04.556]  And what they do when they do that is called filling a gap.
[02:03:04.556 --> 02:03:06.177]  And the gaps have been filled.
[02:03:06.177 --> 02:03:12.019]  So next week, silver and gold have every reason to move back up again.
[02:03:12.785 --> 02:03:15.326]  And they're going much higher.
[02:03:15.326 --> 02:03:19.847]  This is a temporary intercession into the market.
[02:03:19.847 --> 02:03:21.107]  So it's the beach ball.
[02:03:21.107 --> 02:03:23.188]  It's the beach ball effect.
[02:03:23.188 --> 02:03:24.788]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:24.788 --> 02:03:35.190]  And they're doing it because they want the dollar strong and gold and silver weak during the process of this meeting, which is yesterday and today.
[02:03:35.190 --> 02:03:40.772]  And also the bleating and complaining about other foreign governments.
[02:03:40.772 --> 02:03:41.492]  I had a piece in
[02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:43.570]  Uh, out of Mexico City.
[02:03:43.570 --> 02:03:46.131]  It'll be in tomorrow's issue.
[02:03:46.131 --> 02:03:53.812]  Uh, they're thinking of, uh, lowering interest rates to take pressure off of a strong peso.
[02:03:53.812 --> 02:03:59.994]  It's been trading as low as, uh, uh, $12.20 and, uh, to the dollar.
[02:03:59.994 --> 02:04:00.854]  And they don't like that.
[02:04:00.854 --> 02:04:03.855]  They'd rather have it up to $13 or $14.
[02:04:03.855 --> 02:04:05.315]  And that's not what's happening.
[02:04:05.315 --> 02:04:10.656]  So they are just atypical trying to protect their exports.
[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:15.564]  And this whole thing is either going to stop or they're going to have trade barriers.
[02:04:15.564 --> 02:04:20.668]  And they're going to have trade barriers.
[02:04:20.668 --> 02:04:22.269]  Bob, we're going to come back from break.
[02:04:22.269 --> 02:04:26.593]  I want to continue looking at the economy.
[02:04:26.593 --> 02:04:31.417]  They tried to say a month ago that we left the recession in June of 2009.
[02:04:31.417 --> 02:04:35.680]  Now even mainstream media says, OK, we never left the recession.
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:37.222]  We may be going into a depression.
[02:04:38.615 --> 02:04:47.063]  I want to go through some of the economic data and the things that are happening on the world political scale with you.
[02:04:47.063 --> 02:04:53.509]  I want to get into Herman Van Rompuy's disgusting, that's the EU head, folks, statement yesterday that nation states are dead.
[02:04:53.509 --> 02:04:55.651]  That's the goal of all of this.
[02:04:55.651 --> 02:04:58.293]  Straight ahead with Bob Chapman.
[02:04:58.293 --> 02:04:58.994]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:58.994 --> 02:05:01.176]  This is the GCN Radio Network, GCNlive.com.
[02:05:02.597 --> 02:05:06.598]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:06.598 --> 02:05:09.859]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:09.859 --> 02:05:14.640]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:21.042]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:21.042 --> 02:05:23.283]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:23.823 --> 02:05:24.123]  Tim Geithner?
[02:05:24.123 --> 02:05:24.644]  Bernanke?
[02:05:24.644 --> 02:05:25.304]  They're arsonists!
[02:05:25.304 --> 02:05:26.585]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:28.826]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:42.714 --> 02:05:44.575]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:05:44.575 --> 02:05:50.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:59.127]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:01.087 --> 02:06:05.650]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.650 --> 02:06:06.550]  Number 1.
[02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:09.993]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.993 --> 02:06:10.853]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.853 --> 02:06:15.736]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.736 --> 02:06:16.477]  It's true.
[02:06:16.477 --> 02:06:21.360]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:22.180]  Number 3.
[02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:25.763]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.763 --> 02:06:29.465]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.665 --> 02:06:30.466]  Number 4.
[02:06:30.466 --> 02:06:33.228]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:33.228 --> 02:06:36.911]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.911 --> 02:06:37.692]  Number 5.
[02:06:37.692 --> 02:06:41.836]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.836 --> 02:06:46.600]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:51.062]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:00.939 --> 02:07:05.122]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:07:05.122 --> 02:07:11.526]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:07:11.526 --> 02:07:18.931]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:07:18.931 --> 02:07:23.795]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:07:32.442 --> 02:07:36.187]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:07:36.710 --> 02:07:43.472]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:07:43.472 --> 02:07:47.374]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:07:47.374 --> 02:07:54.336]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:07:54.336 --> 02:07:54.936]  Thank you.
[02:08:02.355 --> 02:08:05.136]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:05.136 --> 02:08:10.938]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.938 --> 02:08:13.278]  Well, here's the Boston Herald.
[02:08:13.278 --> 02:08:18.380]  Obama's economic view is rejected on the world stage.
[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:22.461]  Meanwhile, Obama claims strengthened hand in global dealings.
[02:08:22.461 --> 02:08:23.042]  That's AP.
[02:08:23.042 --> 02:08:24.202]  He says everything's wonderful.
[02:08:25.765 --> 02:08:28.707]  Continuing, G20 refuses to back U.S.
[02:08:28.707 --> 02:08:31.748]  push on China currency.
[02:08:31.748 --> 02:08:34.970]  The leaders of the 20 major economies on Friday refused to back U.S.
[02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:37.112]  push to make China boost its currency value.
[02:08:37.112 --> 02:08:42.635]  You see, they get to lower theirs and unfairly ship all our jobs there because it's cheaper to manufacture.
[02:08:43.837 --> 02:08:51.700]  So what's happening is all these other countries, as Bob Chapman just said, want us to continue to slit our throats for what Herman Von Ruppe calls his global government.
[02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:57.743]  He says nation-states are dead and that we must basically sacrifice everything on the altar of globalism.
[02:08:57.743 --> 02:09:01.245]  He said the EU chief says the belief that countries can stand alone is a lie.
[02:09:02.305 --> 02:09:12.193]  And an illusion so they get us held captive to their fiat money system and then always say give us more power and we'll make the depression stop and you give them more power and things only get worse.
[02:09:12.193 --> 02:09:12.733]  Bloomberg.
[02:09:12.733 --> 02:09:17.077]  Sarkozy takes over G20 aiming to update monetary system.
[02:09:17.077 --> 02:09:20.860]  They want to move towards this global SDR that we all pay taxes to.
[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:24.323]  That's making the swindling bankers world rulers openly.
[02:09:25.234 --> 02:09:26.915]  We'll get Bob Chapman's take on that.
[02:09:26.915 --> 02:09:30.756]  IMF shadow looms as Irish take pay cuts to avoid bailout.
[02:09:30.756 --> 02:09:33.797]  Their cost of borrowing going way up.
[02:09:33.797 --> 02:09:38.078]  It just goes on and on and on.
[02:09:38.078 --> 02:09:38.919]  And here in the U.S.
[02:09:38.919 --> 02:09:40.679]  they're slashing all the main services.
[02:09:40.679 --> 02:09:42.300]  England's dimming their lights.
[02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:43.120]  Pay to protect.
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:45.821]  Sheriff cutting services to city over late payment.
[02:09:45.821 --> 02:09:49.142]  All over they're slashing police sheriffs, but the taxes go up and up.
[02:09:49.142 --> 02:09:51.083]  More and more of the money going to debt service.
[02:09:51.883 --> 02:09:53.625]  They're not going to get an SDR because I think that
[02:10:14.412 --> 02:10:31.282]  They're going to have to back something that they create, whether it's a rebirth of the dollar, or an index, or a bank core, which most people haven't heard of, but something that was dreamed up by Mr. Keynes back in the 30s.
[02:10:31.282 --> 02:10:34.164]  The SDR cannot be backed by gold.
[02:10:34.164 --> 02:10:40.628]  It's part of the IMF arrangement, although that could change.
[02:10:40.628 --> 02:10:43.870]  And, you know, the easiest way out for these people
[02:10:45.012 --> 02:10:56.581]  But they'll have to give up their current push for world government, is have a big meeting, all the countries are there, devalue, revalue, default.
[02:10:56.581 --> 02:11:14.695]  And then they can decide whether they're going to have an indexed, and Zolder said the other day, he's a Bilderberger, Trilat, CFR person, and very, very important, mind you, although most of you haven't heard of him, he said that
[02:11:15.231 --> 02:11:20.457]  We should consider an international unit of some kind with gold backing.
[02:11:20.457 --> 02:11:23.260]  And then he retracted it a couple of days later.
[02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:26.703]  But the trial balloon went up and that's what that was intended to be.
[02:11:26.703 --> 02:11:27.584]  Well, so did Zoellick.
[02:11:27.584 --> 02:11:30.147]  So did Zoellick, the head of the World Bank, which is a U.S.
[02:11:30.147 --> 02:11:33.511]  arm, also was talking about this three days ago and then retracted.
[02:11:35.523 --> 02:11:37.044]  That's the gentleman I was talking about.
[02:11:37.044 --> 02:11:39.044]  Okay, I guess you're pronouncing it a bit different than I would.
[02:11:39.044 --> 02:11:41.065]  I might have given him the wrong name.
[02:11:41.065 --> 02:11:41.685]  No, it's okay.
[02:11:41.685 --> 02:11:42.905]  There's so many of these creatures.
[02:11:42.905 --> 02:11:50.727]  But, you know, when you talk about the Bancor, the IMF three months ago put out a paper and said we want a Bancor.
[02:11:50.727 --> 02:11:53.608]  So they're actually proposing it.
[02:11:53.608 --> 02:11:54.848]  That's right.
[02:11:54.848 --> 02:11:56.349]  But they've got to back up with gold.
[02:11:56.349 --> 02:12:00.029]  Now, we don't know whether the United States has any gold or not.
[02:12:00.029 --> 02:12:01.930]  There is gold in Fort Knox and
[02:12:02.572 --> 02:12:05.894]  Under the Fed building in New York and at West Point.
[02:12:05.894 --> 02:12:12.819]  And I know we have subscribers who are in the military, who are now retired, who counted it.
[02:12:12.819 --> 02:12:16.882]  So we know something's there, but we don't know who it belongs to.
[02:12:16.882 --> 02:12:17.983]  But if the U.S.
[02:12:17.983 --> 02:12:28.350]  has their gold, or a good part of it left, and squandered everybody else's, then all I have to do is back the dollar with gold.
[02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:31.913]  Now, before they do that, they must
[02:12:32.461 --> 02:12:36.423]  devalue and default along with others.
[02:12:36.423 --> 02:12:45.987]  And the reason why is if they just revert and say, okay, tomorrow morning at eight o'clock, we're going to go back to a gold standard.
[02:12:45.987 --> 02:12:51.289]  And what would happen is the Chinese would say, hey, that's terrific.
[02:12:51.289 --> 02:12:52.489]  Here's a trillion dollars.
[02:12:52.489 --> 02:12:55.491]  We want a trillion dollars worth of gold.
[02:12:55.491 --> 02:13:00.773]  So that's not going to work very well unless they devalue and default along with the others first.
[02:13:01.528 --> 02:13:04.109]  So, the easy way out is to have the meeting.
[02:13:04.109 --> 02:13:12.211]  They can try to do a Bancorp, and it could conceivably work for them, but it's got to be goal-backed.
[02:13:12.211 --> 02:13:15.272]  And that's why more and more they're floating that.
[02:13:15.272 --> 02:13:24.374]  I want to shift gears now and play a video clip, because I talked about this yesterday, but the magnitude of this is so huge.
[02:13:24.374 --> 02:13:28.295]  We had Warren Glenn Beck on air, and we know he listens, his people listen every day.
[02:13:30.094 --> 02:13:35.197]  About half his show is exactly what's covered here, and then he puts a neocon spin on it, but less and less.
[02:13:35.197 --> 02:13:41.280]  Again, I don't trust him, but he's going in the right direction, like Wayne Madsen said, you know, hey, the water's warm, come on in.
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:45.482]  But the bigger question is, why would Fox News allow him to do this?
[02:13:45.482 --> 02:13:50.484]  Well, I'll tell you one big reason, and I'm gonna get into what he's done here in a moment.
[02:13:50.484 --> 02:13:59.349]  George Soros, in the last six or seven years, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying and running campaigns.
[02:14:00.492 --> 02:14:03.653]  to shut down Fox and News Corp's advertisers.
[02:14:03.653 --> 02:14:09.315]  They've cost him tens of millions just in the last two years, year and a half, that he's been at Fox.
[02:14:09.315 --> 02:14:12.236]  They've taken hundreds of sponsors.
[02:14:12.236 --> 02:14:17.357]  And so, Rupert Murdoch's a high-level globalist, but not in the capstone.
[02:14:17.357 --> 02:14:18.758]  He's angry at that.
[02:14:18.758 --> 02:14:20.959]  And it really is Soros that started it.
[02:14:20.959 --> 02:14:21.479]  Soros is a
[02:14:22.335 --> 02:14:22.455]  Yes.
[02:14:42.282 --> 02:14:46.343]  And they're saying we're going to cause an Oklahoma City or we're going to be behind it.
[02:14:46.343 --> 02:14:49.443]  And we put the warning out in June.
[02:14:49.443 --> 02:14:58.845]  In July, Obama faces growing credibility crisis, where Robert Shapiro advising Obama said without an Oklahoma City or 9-11, you're not going to be able to pose as our savior.
[02:14:58.845 --> 02:15:03.166]  The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, quote.
[02:15:03.166 --> 02:15:10.048]  He has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he's a leader who can command confidence in short of a new 9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:15:10.048 --> 02:15:11.088]  I can't think of how I could do that.
[02:15:13.095 --> 02:15:19.620]  Ex-Clinton Strategist, Obama Needs Events Similar to OKC to Reconnect with Voters.
[02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:22.202]  That's another Obama and Clinton advisor.
[02:15:22.202 --> 02:15:24.684]  Mark Penn said that on National TV.
[02:15:24.684 --> 02:15:30.488]  So we wrote the article last Sunday, Clintonite Obama Needs OKC Bombing to Reconnect with American People.
[02:15:30.488 --> 02:15:37.773]  Beck, because we put it in the articles, I showed where all these Soros publications are saying that Beck and I, it's not just Beck, he says, oh, they're going to blame me.
[02:15:37.773 --> 02:15:39.174]  No, it's Alex, too.
[02:15:39.174 --> 02:15:40.355]  I'm in the crosshairs, folks.
[02:15:40.355 --> 02:15:41.276]  That's why I talk about this.
[02:15:42.762 --> 02:15:44.523]  to stage a new Oklahoma City.
[02:15:44.523 --> 02:16:10.596]  Now, Beck came out and said that George Soros, I won't even go this far, because he's a mid-level minion, the shadowy corporate interest, and the MIAC report, they are gearing up to go after the Patriot movement, and we've been saying that for actually two years now, but we've been intensifying our warning, but Beck came out, and we're going to skip the break here, the network break coming up in a moment, because I want to give Bob plenty of time, because we're cutting him short today, and I apologize for that, but don't worry, he'll get two hours next week if he wants it.
[02:16:10.596 --> 02:16:11.516]  Sometimes he can't do it.
[02:16:14.133 --> 02:16:21.195]  How big a deal is it to have Glenn Beck come out and say twice, in the same video clip, they're going to blame me.
[02:16:21.195 --> 02:16:24.396]  They're getting ready to stage a new Oklahoma City.
[02:16:24.396 --> 02:16:26.116]  I mean, this is bold.
[02:16:26.116 --> 02:16:29.837]  And for him to be green-lighted, this shows a fight within the globalist, I believe.
[02:16:29.837 --> 02:16:33.218]  As you know, Fox News is globalist.
[02:16:33.218 --> 02:16:39.640]  But how big of a deal is it to have Beck admit false flag terror in America to be blamed on the American people?
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:41.600]  This is huge, Bob.
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:42.261]  It's giant.
[02:16:42.261 --> 02:16:43.361]  There's no question about it.
[02:16:44.133 --> 02:16:52.601]  And, uh, you know, he's going down the avenue that we discussed over and over again over the last year or so, and he's really stealing what you're doing.
[02:16:52.601 --> 02:17:00.007]  But, you know, if it's in the right direction, as Madsen said, the water's warm, come on in.
[02:17:00.007 --> 02:17:02.029]  They are challenging them.
[02:17:02.029 --> 02:17:03.310]  There is a breakup.
[02:17:05.259 --> 02:17:10.404]  Probably temporary between these people and they've gone on the attack on Fox.
[02:17:10.404 --> 02:17:12.485]  There's absolutely no doubt about it.
[02:17:12.485 --> 02:17:23.875]  And I don't know if you noticed, you probably did, that the ADL is now after Glenn Beck because he's a racist because of what he had to say about Mr. Soros.
[02:17:23.875 --> 02:17:26.438]  Yeah, so they're pulling out the big guns now.
[02:17:26.438 --> 02:17:27.739]  I mean, they're desperate.
[02:17:27.739 --> 02:17:29.020]  That's right.
[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:30.241]  And they're hurting.
[02:17:31.094 --> 02:17:32.314]  The truth kills.
[02:17:32.314 --> 02:17:34.335]  I mean, it's awful.
[02:17:34.335 --> 02:17:36.955]  And that's why we're here, to tell the truth.
[02:17:36.955 --> 02:17:48.058]  And Soros' background, what Beck should do, is what we have done, is point out that the man has been convicted twice of breaking the law.
[02:17:48.058 --> 02:17:50.638]  Yeah, Beck never does that that I've seen.
[02:17:50.638 --> 02:17:53.879]  This guy's a convict!
[02:17:53.879 --> 02:17:55.279]  Yes, that's true.
[02:17:55.279 --> 02:17:58.040]  And he even lost an appeal in France.
[02:17:58.743 --> 02:18:11.392]  And now he's gone to one of these international organizations, whose name I can't remember, to tell him that you have to exonerate me because of some obscure reason.
[02:18:11.392 --> 02:18:18.356]  But he was after that, he was convicted in Hungary as well, was doing the same thing, rigging the stock market, in essence.
[02:18:18.356 --> 02:18:27.603]  And Beck is telling the truth to a certain degree when he says that George Soros is at the top of the pyramid, but only over an enclave
[02:18:28.283 --> 02:18:34.485]  Of socialist and communist because you know the big mega banks want to steal the middle class wealth to give it to the bankers.
[02:18:34.485 --> 02:18:43.727]  They always hire a crew of lazy, ignorant, you know, intellectual, lightweights, you know, to basically be their vanguard.
[02:18:43.727 --> 02:18:53.850]  But Soros on the power structure, I don't even consider him to be at the top of the pyramid where the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Queen of England, Dutch Royal Family are.
[02:18:53.850 --> 02:18:55.331]  They promote all the same policies.
[02:18:56.411 --> 02:19:02.513]  So there does seem to be somewhat of a throwing Soros under the bus here.
[02:19:02.513 --> 02:19:08.974]  Well, uh, certainly Fox and Glenn Beck are in that direction already.
[02:19:08.974 --> 02:19:12.955]  And they're probably waiting to see what, uh, that you have to say.
[02:19:12.955 --> 02:19:19.757]  And, uh, we just told people the truth about Mr. Soros and if the ADL doesn't like that, well that's just too darn bad.
[02:19:20.860 --> 02:19:26.783]  And maybe Mr. Beck didn't even know that part of Mr. Soros' background.
[02:19:26.783 --> 02:19:27.804]  Yeah, there's so much.
[02:19:27.804 --> 02:19:29.444]  I mean, how do you know it all?
[02:19:29.444 --> 02:19:31.866]  It's an endless file.
[02:19:31.866 --> 02:19:42.371]  Well, in all of the financing that he did through his organizations throughout Europe, particularly Eastern Europe, causing those colored revolutions,
[02:19:43.369 --> 02:19:45.830]  All of which have been thrown asunder.
[02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:54.194]  All they did was bankrupt most of the countries that experienced those electoral revolutions, we'll call them.
[02:19:54.194 --> 02:19:55.975]  And this guy is bad news.
[02:19:55.975 --> 02:19:58.796]  He also wants to legalize marijuana.
[02:19:58.796 --> 02:20:05.559]  And everybody has their own idea on that, but it's something I should throw in because he's been a longtime advocate of that.
[02:20:07.213 --> 02:20:10.616]  Well, his main reason for it is that's just some liberal cover he has.
[02:20:10.616 --> 02:20:15.319]  And I don't listen to Howard Stern a lot, but I scan around through XM.
[02:20:15.319 --> 02:20:20.783]  And I was driving home last night, and they were re-airing it, because he's on, I think, XM 100, or is it Sirius 100?
[02:20:20.783 --> 02:20:22.885]  I guess I have Sirius in my car.
[02:20:22.885 --> 02:20:24.246]  Same company.
[02:20:24.246 --> 02:20:28.309]  But the point is, Sirius and XM were merged, what, three years ago.
[02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:34.213]  But I listened to Stern for like 30 minutes talk about how he got Glenn Beck's
[02:20:34.974 --> 02:20:35.374]  I think?
[02:20:55.275 --> 02:20:55.876]  I don't think so.
[02:21:10.484 --> 02:21:12.966]  Then none of their operations are taxable.
[02:21:12.966 --> 02:21:16.609]  They keep most of the money and give some of it for horrible programs.
[02:21:16.609 --> 02:21:31.021]  And Soros calls philanthropy, having media matters and all these other outfits, demonizing the Second Amendment, demonizing people that want sovereignty or to control our borders, demonizing people who are against the Federal Reserve, helping overthrow countries.
[02:21:32.702 --> 02:21:38.603]  And one thing Beck says is true, we've talked about it for years, Soros is on record always trying to kill the dollar.
[02:21:38.603 --> 02:21:41.684]  He's on, I've seen him on Laird News Hour a decade ago doing it.
[02:21:41.684 --> 02:21:49.846]  Soros is on record going in and bragging, he's been convicted of it, for setting up currency implosions and making tens of billions at a pop.
[02:21:49.846 --> 02:21:55.927]  So, I mean, for the ADL and all these other groups to say he's some little angel cake, I mean,
[02:21:56.847 --> 02:22:03.369]  Is a complete fraud and a joke, Bob, but I mean, I'm ranting about this now.
[02:22:03.369 --> 02:22:11.012]  It's just that, look, if we get Howard Stern, he's probably got 10 million listeners overall, to start attacking the New World Order.
[02:22:11.012 --> 02:22:12.693]  The globalists are in a lot of trouble.
[02:22:12.693 --> 02:22:22.377]  You know, I mean, because of all of the people that listen to Stern, if they start hearing serious information, I mean, my point is, first Stern covered the naked body scanners in one of our news articles.
[02:22:22.377 --> 02:22:23.097]  I forgot that part.
[02:22:23.857 --> 02:22:25.178]  Well, first of all, he's not in the middle.
[02:22:25.178 --> 02:22:26.059]  I think he's closer to the top.
[02:22:52.015 --> 02:22:54.798]  I would say in the top 10%.
[02:22:54.798 --> 02:23:03.445]  Because he's a decision maker, he's been given the opportunity to have billions and billions of dollars, and he's instructed what he's supposed to do with it.
[02:23:03.445 --> 02:23:05.847]  He doesn't make those decisions himself.
[02:23:05.847 --> 02:23:11.853]  They have committees that do that, they're working 24-7 worldwide in these think tanks, and they've been doing it for years.
[02:23:12.612 --> 02:23:13.773]  He's just a dummy.
[02:23:13.773 --> 02:23:24.258]  When he dies, all the money will go back to the Illuminists and they'll continue and they'll use some other stooge to do it in the likes of Kissinger.
[02:23:24.258 --> 02:23:25.519]  Let me just back you up.
[02:23:25.519 --> 02:23:31.862]  It came out in the church hearings and others that that's exactly what happens and that's what's happening with Bill and Melinda Gates.
[02:23:31.862 --> 02:23:36.205]  They had all those antitrust things slapped on them until they gave the money to eugenics.
[02:23:36.205 --> 02:23:36.725]  Please continue.
[02:23:38.522 --> 02:23:38.782]  Right.
[02:23:38.782 --> 02:23:50.569]  So, you know, let's get a hold of Glenn and tell him, look, and now that you've started this and you're trying to work your way up the pyramid, let us give you a little help.
[02:23:50.569 --> 02:23:52.310]  These are the people who are doing it.
[02:23:52.310 --> 02:23:53.971]  This is why they're doing it.
[02:23:53.971 --> 02:23:56.152]  And I don't think your boss is going to like it.
[02:23:56.152 --> 02:24:03.657]  But if you run this stuff, it'll be unbelievably good because others will pick it up, like Howard Stern.
[02:24:03.657 --> 02:24:05.398]  And maybe he'll do some more research.
[02:24:06.013 --> 02:24:07.794]  And this is how these things work.
[02:24:07.794 --> 02:24:09.555]  They feed on themselves.
[02:24:09.555 --> 02:24:20.282]  You know, a lot of the people out there who are opportunists and who don't really care sometimes have a change of heart.
[02:24:20.282 --> 02:24:23.644]  And they start to care and say, gee, how did I ever overlook this?
[02:24:23.644 --> 02:24:24.805]  This is dreadful.
[02:24:24.805 --> 02:24:25.926]  Let's do something about it.
[02:24:27.043 --> 02:24:28.384]  Absolutely.
[02:24:28.384 --> 02:24:30.905]  I want to play this Glenn Beck clip since we've been talking about it.
[02:24:30.905 --> 02:24:32.726]  It's about two minutes long.
[02:24:32.726 --> 02:24:34.167]  Here it is.
[02:24:34.167 --> 02:24:36.048]  Why does the left need this violence?
[02:24:36.048 --> 02:24:43.772]  Well, listen to a clip from a Democratic pollster, Mark Penn, happened just the other day, and yet no one pays attention to it.
[02:24:43.772 --> 02:24:47.414]  How can the left win the country?
[02:24:47.414 --> 02:24:47.694]  Watch.
[02:24:49.232 --> 02:24:51.174]  Cabinets don't really sell things.
[02:24:51.174 --> 02:24:53.495]  The President himself has to reconnect with the people.
[02:24:53.495 --> 02:24:57.779]  Remember, President Clinton reconnected through Oklahoma, right?
[02:24:57.779 --> 02:25:00.721]  And the President right now, he seems removed.
[02:25:00.721 --> 02:25:04.904]  And it wasn't until that speech that he re-clicked with the American public.
[02:25:04.904 --> 02:25:08.987]  Obama needs a similar kind of event.
[02:25:08.987 --> 02:25:12.250]  Obama needs a similar kind of event.
[02:25:12.250 --> 02:25:13.451]  How?
[02:25:13.451 --> 02:25:14.372]  Like Oklahoma City.
[02:25:15.245 --> 02:25:25.450]  If only Barack Obama can have the opportunity to speak to America after another Oklahoma City type event, then he'll politically be in good shape.
[02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:27.831]  Wow!
[02:25:27.831 --> 02:25:35.075]  Now, according to Drummond Pike, the founder of Tides, who, Drummond, I hope you watch this week because, oh, it's all coming undone this week.
[02:25:36.543 --> 02:25:40.046]  I will be the guy who causes the next Oklahoma City.
[02:25:40.046 --> 02:25:47.631]  This is in a letter, an appeal to advertisers of Fox, dear Fox advertisers, read this part of it.
[02:25:47.631 --> 02:25:51.813]  No one, left, right, center, wants to see another Oklahoma City.
[02:25:51.813 --> 02:25:53.635]  The next assassin may succeed.
[02:25:53.635 --> 02:25:56.056]  If so, there will be blood on many hands.
[02:25:56.056 --> 02:25:59.038]  They are setting up another Oklahoma City.
[02:25:59.038 --> 02:26:04.082]  They are claiming that one is coming and they've already marked the one who caused it.
[02:26:05.882 --> 02:26:10.474]  But don't you miss Wednesday's show when I show you violence and the pressure from below.
[02:26:10.474 --> 02:26:12.720]  It will boggle your mind!
[02:26:13.775 --> 02:26:14.635]  So there you have it.
[02:26:14.635 --> 02:26:18.337]  They, he's talking about Soros, are setting up in Oklahoma City.
[02:26:18.337 --> 02:26:21.079]  And there's actually some truth to that.
[02:26:21.079 --> 02:26:27.742]  We know from the FBI memos that people sued lawyer Jesse Trinidou because they killed his brother and got him.
[02:26:27.742 --> 02:26:29.543]  He got one declassified and another.
[02:26:29.543 --> 02:26:30.444]  They blacked him out.
[02:26:30.444 --> 02:26:36.347]  But when he got the two copies of the same document, different areas blacked out, two different courts, he had the whole document.
[02:26:36.787 --> 02:26:37.948]  Southern Poverty Law Center
[02:26:52.162 --> 02:26:53.423]  I'll tell you something, that's a brilliant take.
[02:26:53.423 --> 02:26:54.964]  And I'm not shining you on, that is just terrific.
[02:26:54.964 --> 02:26:56.525]  And that's exactly what they do.
[02:27:18.937 --> 02:27:23.039]  And that's what the CIA is all about, in part as well.
[02:27:23.039 --> 02:27:34.485]  And there's no question in any person who's done any investigation about who did Oklahoma City in 9-11.
[02:27:34.485 --> 02:27:37.907]  They were events, and there's been a lot of others this recent.
[02:27:38.809 --> 02:27:43.811]  The thing that we've watched here in the Gulf of Mexico with the oil.
[02:27:43.811 --> 02:27:45.592]  It's the same thing.
[02:27:45.592 --> 02:27:47.213]  And they keep on doing it.
[02:27:47.213 --> 02:27:57.758]  And so, obviously, the Democrats are working on, or at least the people in the White House, are working on some kind of event to make everybody like the President.
[02:27:58.351 --> 02:28:04.615]  So maybe he can be around and maybe the Democrats can gain some ground back.
[02:28:04.615 --> 02:28:07.496]  And people ask, why would they brag out in the open?
[02:28:07.496 --> 02:28:10.118]  Because most people in the system aren't involved in it.
[02:28:10.118 --> 02:28:23.946]  They've got to put the talking point out so all their people rush on TV when Obama's people blow up a federal building or a school and put the talking point out that Obama, you know, he saved you, he stood up for you.
[02:28:23.946 --> 02:28:25.467]  That's exactly right.
[02:28:25.467 --> 02:28:26.928]  And that's the path that they follow.
[02:28:27.941 --> 02:28:31.124]  And so we can expect they're gonna try something.
[02:28:31.124 --> 02:28:32.445]  Where and when?
[02:28:32.445 --> 02:28:34.827]  I certainly don't know, and you don't.
[02:28:34.827 --> 02:28:37.550]  But they're gonna try something, because they just told us.
[02:28:37.550 --> 02:28:40.112]  It's just like reading Foreign Affairs.
[02:28:40.112 --> 02:28:43.856]  The House organ, literary organ of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:28:44.431 --> 02:28:46.552]  They tell you what they're going to do right in there.
[02:28:46.552 --> 02:28:48.133]  That's how we've known.
[02:28:48.133 --> 02:28:50.214]  That's how you've known for 50 years fighting.
[02:28:50.214 --> 02:28:52.675]  That's how I've known for 15 fighting.
[02:28:52.675 --> 02:28:54.216]  They said how they get rid of the borders.
[02:28:54.216 --> 02:28:55.997]  They talked about the global currency.
[02:28:55.997 --> 02:28:57.958]  We'd come warn people, get laughed at.
[02:28:57.958 --> 02:28:59.319]  All we're doing is reading.
[02:28:59.319 --> 02:29:03.601]  It's like they go on TV and say, we need terror attacks to blame it on Glenn Beck.
[02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:07.063]  I mean, and then you read the actual reports.
[02:29:07.063 --> 02:29:09.424]  They say, yours truly, Bob.
[02:29:09.424 --> 02:29:11.985]  It's two people, Glenn Beck and Alex Jones.
[02:29:11.985 --> 02:29:13.386]  And this is dangerous.
[02:29:15.034 --> 02:29:19.038]  Well, they have to have the stooges, but it's not going to stick.
[02:29:19.038 --> 02:29:26.004]  Because both of you, generally speaking, are very well accepted by the public.
[02:29:26.004 --> 02:29:29.507]  And, you know, there's always people who don't agree, and that's fine.
[02:29:30.171 --> 02:29:33.453]  But they figure they can get away by doing that.
[02:29:33.453 --> 02:29:34.774]  It's not going to stick.
[02:29:34.774 --> 02:29:36.375]  Bob, I want to come back.
[02:29:36.375 --> 02:29:42.498]  I want to come back and finish up with you for about three minutes on this and give folks the place where they can get the internationalforecaster.com free copy.
[02:29:42.498 --> 02:29:44.920]  So grab that number because Bob never even thinks to plug it.
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:47.501]  So when I take out the numbers, he can call and get a free one.
[02:29:47.501 --> 02:29:50.643]  Then we got Michael Braverman with Jesse Ventura's TV show.
[02:29:50.643 --> 02:29:51.804]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.804 --> 02:29:53.205]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.205 --> 02:29:55.726]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.726 --> 02:29:58.408]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.621 --> 02:30:05.702]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[02:31:01.457 --> 02:31:05.040]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:06.161]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:31:06.161 --> 02:31:10.725]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:31:10.725 --> 02:31:16.671]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:31:16.671 --> 02:31:18.832]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:31:18.832 --> 02:31:21.495]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:31:21.855 --> 02:31:28.341]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:31:28.341 --> 02:31:30.563]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:31:30.563 --> 02:31:35.907]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:31:35.907 --> 02:31:40.872]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:31:41.172 --> 02:31:46.535]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:31:46.535 --> 02:31:49.737]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[02:31:52.718 --> 02:31:53.739]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:32:01.288 --> 02:32:07.930]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:32:07.930 --> 02:32:13.071]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:32:13.071 --> 02:32:28.156]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[02:32:30.185 --> 02:32:34.888]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:32:34.888 --> 02:32:39.970]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[02:32:39.970 --> 02:32:42.111]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:32:42.111 --> 02:32:43.892]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:32:43.892 --> 02:32:46.774]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:32:56.099 --> 02:32:58.961]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[02:33:03.463 --> 02:33:12.997]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:33:12.997 --> 02:33:14.559]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:33:14.559 --> 02:33:18.244]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:20.282 --> 02:33:24.564]  We spearheaded two and a half weeks ago a global revolt against the naked body scanners.
[02:33:24.564 --> 02:33:25.865]  I told you we could do it together.
[02:33:25.865 --> 02:33:30.387]  For eight days straight, we've been the top link on Drudge with our articles each day.
[02:33:30.387 --> 02:33:35.569]  Pilots, passengers rage at new naked scans and pat-downs.
[02:33:35.569 --> 02:33:40.131]  Under that giant text, Big Sis moves to stop revolt.
[02:33:40.131 --> 02:33:41.692]  Holiday travel on the brink.
[02:33:42.412 --> 02:33:54.677]  They're the heads of the biggest travel organizations, Disney, the hotel associations, the major pilot association, the flight attendant associations.
[02:33:54.677 --> 02:33:57.178]  They are all in total revolt.
[02:33:57.178 --> 02:33:58.419]  Everybody who's been through these
[02:33:59.019 --> 02:33:59.759]  And I've been through them.
[02:33:59.759 --> 02:34:00.420]  I've seen it happen.
[02:34:00.420 --> 02:34:01.580]  I've said no.
[02:34:01.580 --> 02:34:04.241]  Are in total revolt right now.
[02:34:04.241 --> 02:34:05.462]  This is so exciting.
[02:34:05.462 --> 02:34:17.687]  We've got Michael Braverman, TV producer and researcher and one of the folks that appears in the hit TV show, I'd call it a documentary, now in its second season, Conspiracy Theory.
[02:34:17.687 --> 02:34:19.307]  This was the number one search term yesterday.
[02:34:19.307 --> 02:34:19.888]  Bombshell.
[02:34:19.888 --> 02:34:20.968]  FEMA cams confirmed.
[02:34:20.968 --> 02:34:23.029]  Good job to the listeners.
[02:34:23.029 --> 02:34:25.450]  Google tried to block our
[02:34:26.574 --> 02:34:27.575]  I don't know.
[02:34:42.728 --> 02:34:43.008]  I think?
[02:35:01.485 --> 02:35:02.925]  FEMA camps confirmed.
[02:35:02.925 --> 02:35:05.666]  Put that into Google over and over and over again.
[02:35:05.666 --> 02:35:07.326]  FEMA camps confirmed.
[02:35:07.326 --> 02:35:08.626]  And hit them again.
[02:35:08.626 --> 02:35:10.887]  Hit them with bombshell FEMA camps.
[02:35:10.887 --> 02:35:12.607]  Let's see them try to block both those.
[02:35:12.607 --> 02:35:15.348]  So I just fired two torpedoes.
[02:35:15.348 --> 02:35:18.048]  Bombshell FEMA camps.
[02:35:18.048 --> 02:35:19.549]  Bombshell FEMA camps.
[02:35:19.549 --> 02:35:20.689]  And FEMA camps confirmed.
[02:35:20.689 --> 02:35:22.709]  Two separate search terms.
[02:35:22.709 --> 02:35:24.390]  Nothing can stop you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:24.390 --> 02:35:25.250]  You are awesome.
[02:35:25.250 --> 02:35:27.410]  Look at the global revolts that we're starting.
[02:35:27.410 --> 02:35:29.171]  And then I forget my search term from the first hour.
[02:35:29.171 --> 02:35:30.331]  That's why I'm asking for the blue screen.
[02:35:34.093 --> 02:35:35.574]  Okay, it's revolt against TSA.
[02:35:35.574 --> 02:35:36.515]  That's what I thought it was.
[02:35:36.515 --> 02:35:37.315]  Revolt.
[02:35:37.315 --> 02:35:37.716]  There it is.
[02:35:37.716 --> 02:35:44.040]  Revolt against TSA, and that's destined to be number one in the next hour, then the others later and throughout the week, and you keep searching the term.
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:45.581]  Alright, finishing up with Bob Chapman.
[02:35:45.581 --> 02:35:56.449]  Bob, briefly, what's your take on the naked body scanner revolt, the pat-downs, the grabbing women and children's genitals, even Atlantic Monthly, Jeffrey Goldberg's reporting on this.
[02:35:56.449 --> 02:35:57.670]  This is huge.
[02:35:57.670 --> 02:36:01.293]  They're having emergency meetings at the White House right now with the
[02:36:01.573 --> 02:36:03.834]  You know, heads of Disney World, you name it.
[02:36:03.834 --> 02:36:06.414]  I mean, this is big.
[02:36:06.414 --> 02:36:14.037]  It is big and it's a national disgrace that these people would even attempt to do such things to control people.
[02:36:14.037 --> 02:36:16.677]  This is what it's really all about.
[02:36:16.677 --> 02:36:25.840]  And I hope they revolt so that every machine is taken out of everywhere and sent down to the machine dump someplace.
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:29.061]  Because there's absolutely no reason
[02:36:29.588 --> 02:36:32.870]  For doing those kind of things to people.
[02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:43.516]  And there needs to be an investigation of Chertoff purchasing billions of machines in late 2008 before he left office and then becoming the CEO of the company.
[02:36:43.516 --> 02:36:46.317]  I mean, that's brazen!
[02:36:46.317 --> 02:36:50.499]  Well, it certainly is something that should be investigated.
[02:36:50.499 --> 02:36:54.982]  But unfortunately in Washington today, no matter what you do, you get away with it.
[02:36:54.982 --> 02:36:57.283]  But just to bring it up to the public attention,
[02:36:57.987 --> 02:37:00.929]  And cause the consternation that it will cause.
[02:37:00.929 --> 02:37:02.931]  And they will do away with them.
[02:37:02.931 --> 02:37:04.572]  They're not going to keep them in there.
[02:37:04.572 --> 02:37:05.592]  Well said, Bob Chapman.
[02:37:05.592 --> 02:37:11.857]  Bob, in closing, folks can call Midas Resources and get a free copy of your 40 plus page weekly newsletter.
[02:37:11.857 --> 02:37:13.798]  What's the toll free number for folks to call and get it?
[02:37:13.798 --> 02:37:14.779]  877-479-8178.
[02:37:14.779 --> 02:37:14.979]  That's 877-479-8178.
[02:37:14.979 --> 02:37:16.340]  And don't forget, Ted has a special deal.
[02:37:26.036 --> 02:37:34.219]  Free one-year subscription to the International Forecaster if you buy one of the Frank Coins.
[02:37:34.219 --> 02:37:36.921]  It's the best deal I've ever seen.
[02:37:36.921 --> 02:37:37.881]  Well said.
[02:37:37.881 --> 02:37:42.443]  Bob, God willing, we'll see you back live during the show next Friday.
[02:37:42.443 --> 02:37:43.163]  You got it.
[02:37:43.163 --> 02:37:43.863]  Thank you.
[02:37:43.863 --> 02:37:46.625]  Thank you so much, Bob Chapman, Crusader for Liberty.
[02:37:48.755 --> 02:37:59.120]  I was really excited when TruTV folks called me, Michael Braverman and Tyrell, and said, hey, we think the police state episode that you're in is the most powerful.
[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:00.241]  It's groundbreaking.
[02:38:00.241 --> 02:38:00.821]  And I was there.
[02:38:00.821 --> 02:38:03.423]  I was at the FEMA centers, I mean, with Jesse.
[02:38:03.423 --> 02:38:08.886]  I haven't been able to talk about it, but now they're allowing folks, because this is so big, it airs tonight, 9 p.m.
[02:38:08.886 --> 02:38:09.666]  Central, 10 p.m.
[02:38:09.666 --> 02:38:10.967]  Eastern, you know I'm going to be watching it.
[02:38:11.747 --> 02:38:26.155]  The episode I think is the next powerful is the JFK with a deathbed confession, E. Howard Hunt coming up next Friday, and it's really important because there's been all these denials about FEMA camps, and now it's all coming out.
[02:38:26.155 --> 02:38:29.958]  Now, of course, Breiverman has worked extensively with Jesse Ventura for many years.
[02:38:31.038 --> 02:38:35.400]  Uh, and of course, uh, he's produced a whole bunch of hit television shows.
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:41.341]  One of them, the number one new show, of course, in the last two years on, uh, TruTV, getting record ratings, uh, there.
[02:38:41.341 --> 02:38:46.243]  And, and there's no doubt why, because they're, they're covering things that's never been on national television.
[02:38:46.243 --> 02:38:52.145]  It's been here on this show, but, but never with the budget, never with the research, never on national, uh, television.
[02:38:52.145 --> 02:38:56.066]  And tonight's police state episode is absolutely off the charts.
[02:38:56.066 --> 02:38:58.447]  And the article's bombshell, FEMA camps confirmed.
[02:38:59.187 --> 02:39:00.408]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:39:21.971 --> 02:39:22.852]  You know what?
[02:39:22.852 --> 02:39:25.435]  I listened a little bit to your last guest.
[02:39:25.435 --> 02:39:31.322]  I think this whole thing is going to go down in flames or up in flames because people aren't going to stand for it.
[02:39:31.322 --> 02:39:36.669]  It's just they're now got to the point where the masses of population are going to start to push back.
[02:39:37.779 --> 02:39:41.902]  This could be the trigger, kind of like the T-tax in 1776.
[02:39:41.902 --> 02:39:42.563]  I'm not kidding.
[02:39:42.563 --> 02:39:43.964]  I mean, this is huge.
[02:39:43.964 --> 02:39:46.165]  Now, so much is coming out.
[02:39:46.165 --> 02:39:57.994]  I think of last year's episodes, how you had made the global warming fraud special, and then everything in your special, even though it had been produced and finished weeks before, it came out right as ClimateGate broke.
[02:39:58.354 --> 02:40:01.197]  And it made international headlines because you've got people at the U.N.
[02:40:01.197 --> 02:40:04.199]  to admit they'd engaged in chicanery and lies.
[02:40:04.199 --> 02:40:08.583]  Now this, I believe, is even bigger, but it's up to the listeners to spread the word.
[02:40:08.583 --> 02:40:11.005]  I mean, I know Tyrell agrees, Jesse agrees.
[02:40:11.005 --> 02:40:13.548]  What's your view on this key episode coming up tonight?
[02:40:14.332 --> 02:40:19.976]  I'll tell you what, just to back up a little bit, I always call this show the miracle show.
[02:40:19.976 --> 02:40:33.246]  I call conspiracy theory a miracle, because having been in the trenches of the TV business, the fact that we're on and we're in our second season is, to overstate it again, a miracle.
[02:40:33.246 --> 02:40:36.149]  To have a show like this that exposes the things that we do,
[02:40:37.009 --> 02:40:47.756]  In the mass media, or the corporate media as some people call it, but in the mass media on a network that reaches 90 million homes is, to me, unbelievable.
[02:40:47.756 --> 02:40:58.923]  And a lot of it is to the support of people that are your listeners and other people that have open minds and are willing to look at an alternative and are willing to accept an alternative.
[02:41:00.704 --> 02:41:07.027]  This episode that's going to air tonight, you know, I've seen a lot of stuff, Alex, you and I have talked a couple of different times, you know, many times.
[02:41:07.027 --> 02:41:15.510]  I've seen a lot of stuff in producing this show, but this stuff, the stuff that's on tonight, I gotta tell you, it keeps me up.
[02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:20.092]  It keeps me up at night thinking about what the government is really doing and the stuff.
[02:41:20.092 --> 02:41:20.852]  And we saw it.
[02:41:20.852 --> 02:41:21.692]  We see it.
[02:41:21.692 --> 02:41:22.753]  We prove it.
[02:41:22.753 --> 02:41:28.275]  And we have people looking at our faces and just lying, lying right in the camera.
[02:41:28.275 --> 02:41:28.975]  It's unbelievable.
[02:41:30.575 --> 02:41:34.842]  Absolutely, and I'm very proud to be associated with this important episode.
[02:41:34.842 --> 02:41:38.728]  You've got the water episode coming up, how they're hoarding and taking over all the water.
[02:41:38.728 --> 02:41:42.133]  By the way, I'll just stop you for a second.
[02:41:42.133 --> 02:41:44.176]  That will blow people's minds.
[02:41:44.176 --> 02:41:45.298]  Blow your minds.
[02:41:46.718 --> 02:41:52.301]  We're going to talk about some of the other episodes coming up, but specifically, I've got the bullet points of what we're able to reveal.
[02:41:52.301 --> 02:41:53.462]  Michael, you've got the floor.
[02:41:53.462 --> 02:41:59.926]  Walk through, prelude, a kind of first look of what people are going to see tonight, 9 p.m.
[02:41:59.926 --> 02:42:00.246]  Central.
[02:42:01.607 --> 02:42:03.829]  What they're going to see is a couple different things.
[02:42:03.829 --> 02:42:14.057]  We're going to tell a story that begins with... We're going to tell a story that if you said it to your friends and neighbors, they would go, come on, it's unbelievable, it sounds like fiction.
[02:42:14.057 --> 02:42:21.863]  What you're going to see tonight sounds like a made-up story, a made-up fictional story, but it's not.
[02:42:21.863 --> 02:42:24.125]  I mean, you watch this thing, and we're going to show you
[02:42:25.146 --> 02:42:33.472]  Uh, a coffin storage yard, and I know Alex, you were there on that shoot, with hundreds and hundreds of thousands of coffins.
[02:42:33.472 --> 02:42:39.336]  They're just stacked up waiting for someone, and right as we got there to shoot, all of a sudden trucks showed up and started moving them out.
[02:42:39.336 --> 02:42:41.837]  Now you can draw your own conclusions about that.
[02:42:41.837 --> 02:42:45.400]  They knew we were coming, they knew we were going to be there, and they wanted to get
[02:42:45.900 --> 02:42:47.922]  Yeah, a driver even told the locals.
[02:42:47.922 --> 02:42:57.731]  We talked to multiple locals who talked to the drivers, because they're in a neighborhood area with some woods behind it, that yeah, they told us, you know, because people are coming out here and we know the media is coming.
[02:42:57.731 --> 02:42:59.853]  And then there's the usual suspects.
[02:42:59.853 --> 02:43:05.038]  Popular Mechanics supposedly debunks it by doing a strawman saying that the locals are involved.
[02:43:05.038 --> 02:43:07.400]  The locals that were storing it are good people.
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:10.383]  The fact is we know, and I gave you guys the documents,
[02:43:10.703 --> 02:43:21.048]  That emergency managers in New York, Indiana, and other states, including Alabama and Georgia, have confirmed there is a CDC program preparing for mass graves of millions of dead Americans during a bio-attack.
[02:43:21.048 --> 02:43:21.708]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:43:21.708 --> 02:43:23.049]  No, no, that's absolutely right.
[02:43:23.049 --> 02:43:26.811]  And then we move on in the episode to these things called fusion centers.
[02:43:26.811 --> 02:43:31.613]  I didn't know what the heck a fusion center was until I started, you know, doing the research and building out this show.
[02:43:31.613 --> 02:43:33.794]  There are these places all over the
[02:43:33.814 --> 02:43:34.394]  We're good to go.
[02:43:54.310 --> 02:44:12.334]  And it's been proven, and anybody can Google it, in Missouri, the Fusion Center in Missouri, was sued because they were watching people with Rand, with Paul, Ron Paul stickers on their cars, anybody associated with the third party movement, or people who were conspiracy theorists.
[02:44:14.051 --> 02:44:15.132]  Now, you tell me.
[02:44:15.132 --> 02:44:17.314]  Anybody listening to this program, you tell me.
[02:44:17.314 --> 02:44:21.619]  So, basically, if that ain't the thought police, I don't know what is.
[02:44:21.619 --> 02:44:28.205]  If I believe in conspiracies and I go on conspiracy websites, or I want to talk to somebody, or I go to a meeting, I'm on a watch list?
[02:44:28.205 --> 02:44:29.567]  When did that happen in this country?
[02:44:31.693 --> 02:44:41.379]  It's Soviet-style secret police, and then they stop people that protest the Mayak Homeland Security reports that law enforcement sent us, and then we broke, of course.
[02:44:41.379 --> 02:44:43.640]  When locals protest it, then they get followed.
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:47.383]  And just a month ago, I had a Pennsylvania representative on.
[02:44:48.396 --> 02:44:51.498]  Who was having tea parties and gun rallies.
[02:44:51.498 --> 02:44:54.460]  And so he was surveilled by Homeland Security.
[02:45:18.336 --> 02:45:22.678]  Maybe you could be at a Ron Paul rally, or you could be, you know, believing in conspiracy theories.
[02:45:22.678 --> 02:45:23.298]  It doesn't matter.
[02:45:23.298 --> 02:45:25.360]  Anti-war groups are being watched.
[02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:26.280]  All the time.
[02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:26.700]  All the time.
[02:45:26.700 --> 02:45:35.505]  And then we found out that these fusion centers are actually a precursor to these mass FEMA camps that you just discussed.
[02:45:35.505 --> 02:45:41.388]  So this thing all kind of ties in together, and it all kind of goes down, you know, one thing leads to another.
[02:45:41.388 --> 02:45:43.969]  And then you get to the FEMA camps, and then you find out, and
[02:45:44.893 --> 02:45:47.754]  You know, Alex, you've been so helpful in a lot of this stuff.
[02:45:47.754 --> 02:45:54.875]  Then you find out that President Obama's executive order divides the country into 10 sectors.
[02:45:54.875 --> 02:45:57.536]  So forget about your state government, forget about your governor.
[02:45:57.536 --> 02:46:04.857]  In a crisis, these 10 hand-picked governors are now going to take over these 10 sectors of the country.
[02:46:04.857 --> 02:46:05.758]  Unbelievable.
[02:46:05.758 --> 02:46:11.719]  Which, you know, and people, I've told people this, you know, my own family, they go, come on, you're making this up.
[02:46:11.719 --> 02:46:12.439]  I go, no.
[02:46:13.704 --> 02:46:15.605]  Well, I mean, that's like classical tyranny.
[02:46:15.605 --> 02:46:34.936]  That's like the line from Star Wars, you know, Episode 4, A New Hope, when they're on the deck of the, you know, command area of the Death Star, and Darth Vader and Governor Tark walk in and they say, the Emperor has dissolved the Senate, and he says, and one of the commanders says, gotten rid of the Senate, who's going to maintain control?
[02:46:34.936 --> 02:46:37.117]  The regional governors will control their systems.
[02:46:37.117 --> 02:46:37.718]  Yeah, remember that?
[02:46:37.718 --> 02:46:39.959]  I mean, that is classic tyranny right there.
[02:46:40.379 --> 02:46:54.181]  Well, also, too, I mean, you know, it's another way to take power away from the hands of people and put power into the hands of people, of a tiny group of people that they think know better.
[02:46:54.181 --> 02:46:55.142]  That's the part that scares me.
[02:46:55.142 --> 02:46:56.322]  Well, this is FEMA government.
[02:46:56.322 --> 02:47:08.584]  You've got ten FEMA regions, now with ten governors over them, and in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act it says that the government can now just set aside Congress for six months and operate under this.
[02:47:08.584 --> 02:47:08.724]  Yeah.
[02:47:09.484 --> 02:47:16.329]  Yeah, and when you realize that these things are real, and these things are in writing, and they're in place, and they're waiting, they're all there.
[02:47:16.329 --> 02:47:17.770]  The trigger is waiting to be pulled.
[02:47:17.770 --> 02:47:22.193]  And again, I came at this, as you know, Alex, from a kind of a neutral point of view.
[02:47:22.193 --> 02:47:26.176]  I mean, you know, the TV guy and a guy in the business and stuff.
[02:47:26.176 --> 02:47:34.081]  I tell you, a show like tonight, again, it keeps me up at night because I think, you know, this stuff is, we're not making this stuff up.
[02:47:34.773 --> 02:47:39.036]  Well, I've worked on a lot of shows with you, Michael, with Tyrell and Jesse and the whole great crew.
[02:47:39.036 --> 02:47:40.397]  And you guys take it serious.
[02:47:40.397 --> 02:47:43.078]  You go into it, you know, not knowing if it's real or not.
[02:47:43.078 --> 02:47:46.220]  And unfortunately, it always turns out to be real and worse than you thought.
[02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:49.643]  But you guys, is it accurate to say I've been a little bit shaken up by this episode?
[02:47:50.188 --> 02:48:12.205]  Yeah, this is one of the ones, and the one you mentioned too, the water one, and a couple others that I can't talk about that are coming really, really soon in this season, because we have, I think, five weeks left, five Fridays left, and we'll talk more as we approach those maybe in the next couple of weeks, but the water one, the JFK one is a mind-blower for anybody who lived through that era, or anybody who's interested in that era.
[02:48:12.205 --> 02:48:17.989]  This episode about this water conspiracy is something I had no idea about, and I guarantee you 97%
[02:48:20.776 --> 02:48:22.609]  Of Americans have no idea about.
[02:48:23.015 --> 02:48:24.996]  Let's go back to tonight's episode, 9 p.m.
[02:48:24.996 --> 02:48:25.856]  Central, 10 p.m.
[02:48:25.856 --> 02:48:32.998]  Eastern, and folks can find TruTV on your cable or your DISH or DirecTV systems.
[02:48:32.998 --> 02:48:40.081]  We'll give you the website so people can visit the Conspiracy Theory website and see some sneak peeks of this.
[02:48:40.081 --> 02:48:42.542]  But Michael, look, this isn't hype.
[02:48:42.542 --> 02:48:45.983]  This is breaking news, what's gonna air tonight.
[02:48:45.983 --> 02:48:47.083]  This is groundbreaking.
[02:48:47.083 --> 02:48:51.185]  This proves it and connects it, and you have all the documents and the video.
[02:48:52.185 --> 02:49:03.358]  Well, I appreciate that, and I would just urge everybody to tell people to watch this.
[02:49:03.358 --> 02:49:08.744]  I'm not even saying to people, and I know you don't do this either, I'm not telling you to believe it or not believe it.
[02:49:08.744 --> 02:49:12.228]  I'm saying watch it with an open mind, draw your own conclusion.
[02:49:13.115 --> 02:49:22.884]  And one thing I will say is that, you know, your audience and the people who do have an open mind and the people who do ask questions and don't just believe what they're told, they're our supporters.
[02:49:22.884 --> 02:49:25.226]  They're the people who support this show.
[02:49:25.226 --> 02:49:26.887]  And we need them to watch this show.
[02:49:26.887 --> 02:49:33.193]  We need them to watch this show tonight and all the subsequent shows, especially the one tonight, because we want to stay on the air.
[02:49:33.193 --> 02:49:39.258]  We want to keep bringing this stuff, you know, to a mass audience, to 90 million homes.
[02:49:39.258 --> 02:49:40.099]  As I said at the beginning,
[02:49:41.002 --> 02:49:43.545]  It's a miracle that we've lasted into our second season.
[02:49:43.545 --> 02:49:47.490]  We're hit, but we need to stay on the air, and we need everyone's support.
[02:49:47.490 --> 02:50:01.866]  We need everybody to tune in, you know, tell your friends and neighbors, anybody who's got an open mind, who's interested in the world around them, and really wants to take another look and a more serious look at what's really going on in this country.
[02:50:01.886 --> 02:50:02.386]  Well that's right.
[02:50:02.386 --> 02:50:05.389]  The mainstream media has always had the laugh factor.
[02:50:05.389 --> 02:50:08.291]  Made fun of anybody that questioned any corruption.
[02:50:08.291 --> 02:50:10.413]  And now it comes out the Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[02:50:10.413 --> 02:50:14.256]  It comes out the government shooting up little kids with syphilis in Guatemala.
[02:50:14.256 --> 02:50:16.117]  And now people are really starting to pay attention.
[02:50:16.117 --> 02:50:20.001]  And it's not just that it airs and 1.8 million or 1.6 watch it.
[02:50:20.001 --> 02:50:20.901]  That's great.
[02:50:20.901 --> 02:50:23.864]  They air this show over and over and over again.
[02:50:24.384 --> 02:50:30.470]  I mean, it's got to be reaching tens and tens of millions per episode because people all over the streets.
[02:50:30.470 --> 02:50:33.993]  When I was on Nightline, you know, I didn't get hardly any response on the streets.
[02:50:33.993 --> 02:50:38.037]  I get responses everywhere about the show Conspiracy Theory being on it.
[02:50:38.037 --> 02:50:41.020]  Yeah, and here's the last thing I want to say about that.
[02:50:42.501 --> 02:50:44.142]  I want your listeners to take to heart.
[02:50:44.142 --> 02:50:45.263]  I tell you what, stay there, Michael.
[02:50:45.263 --> 02:50:45.863]  Final segment.
[02:50:45.863 --> 02:50:46.463]  We've got a break.
[02:50:46.463 --> 02:50:51.606]  Come back, talk about the other key point you want to make, and then more about some of the other groundbreaking episodes coming up.
[02:50:51.606 --> 02:50:55.649]  And give us the TruTV website, or just Google Conspiracy Theory Jesse Ventura.
[02:50:55.649 --> 02:50:56.809]  It's the top link.
[02:50:56.809 --> 02:50:57.930]  Send it out to everybody you know.
[02:50:57.930 --> 02:50:58.990]  Tell them watch tonight.
[02:50:58.990 --> 02:50:59.671]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:06.084]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:06.084 --> 02:51:10.588]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.588 --> 02:51:16.754]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.754 --> 02:51:19.176]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:19.176 --> 02:51:25.162]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:25.282 --> 02:51:28.684]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.684 --> 02:51:30.565]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.565 --> 02:51:32.746]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.746 --> 02:51:37.608]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:37.608 --> 02:51:38.429]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:38.429 --> 02:51:42.471]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:42.711 --> 02:51:50.759]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[02:51:50.759 --> 02:51:51.500]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:51:51.500 --> 02:51:52.341]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:52:01.448 --> 02:52:06.412]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:06.412 --> 02:52:07.412]  What have we got?
[02:52:07.412 --> 02:52:09.854]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.854 --> 02:52:10.855]  A republic.
[02:52:10.855 --> 02:52:13.517]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:13.517 --> 02:52:15.779]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:15.779 --> 02:52:17.800]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:19.481]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:19.481 --> 02:52:20.802]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:20.802 --> 02:52:21.403]  Children?
[02:52:21.403 --> 02:52:22.524]  Our education?
[02:52:22.524 --> 02:52:23.364]  Our money?
[02:52:23.364 --> 02:52:27.007]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:27.367 --> 02:52:32.335]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:32.335 --> 02:52:33.357]  We have the facts.
[02:52:33.357 --> 02:52:34.538]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:34.538 --> 02:52:35.440]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:35.440 --> 02:52:36.321]  We have common law.
[02:52:36.321 --> 02:52:38.845]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:38.845 --> 02:52:42.631]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:42.731 --> 02:52:47.676]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:47.676 --> 02:52:49.178]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:49.178 --> 02:52:50.259]  Don't tread on me.

[02:53:06.337 --> 02:53:09.380]  When the unexpected happens, will you be ready?

[02:54:06.135 --> 02:54:17.344]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have been going for two hours and 54 minutes and haven't even talked about the online video bookstore, the fact that you can get five months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv with all my films, the live stream of the show.
[02:54:17.344 --> 02:54:25.750]  It's your support, buying the books, the videos, the t-shirts, all of it that makes InfoWars.com and the films and everything we do possible.
[02:54:25.750 --> 02:54:30.494]  So just like we need to spread the word about this show to keep it on air, and Michael just told me something really big during the break.
[02:54:30.494 --> 02:54:32.715]  He was trying to say, this is pretty scary stuff actually.
[02:54:33.596 --> 02:54:34.998]  Yeah, here's what I want everyone to know.
[02:54:34.998 --> 02:54:35.958]  I have information which I have to keep.
[02:54:54.838 --> 02:54:55.859]  Wall Street, water!
[02:55:17.893 --> 02:55:21.977]  Wall Street, water, they want us off the air.
[02:55:21.977 --> 02:55:23.739]  Alex, I can't be any clearer than that.
[02:55:23.739 --> 02:55:26.101]  You know, I've got some information from people.
[02:55:26.101 --> 02:55:30.025]  I know it sounds like, you know, trust me, I'm not making this up.
[02:55:30.025 --> 02:55:30.925]  No, I understand.
[02:55:30.925 --> 02:55:39.894]  It's scary stuff, and I'm fighting, and you're fighting, and Jesse especially, you know, more important than all of us, is fighting really hard to keep this show on the air.
[02:55:41.684 --> 02:55:47.388]  In our business, in the TV business, there's one thing that beats all of them, and that's ratings.
[02:55:47.388 --> 02:55:56.614]  So if people support us, and people enjoy the show, and they're willing to come to it with an open mind, you don't have to agree with everything we say, but you have to have an open mind.
[02:55:56.614 --> 02:56:06.080]  And if you want a show like this on the mass media, again what I called it at the very beginning, the miracle show, if you want us to stay on the mass media and be able to reach 90 million homes,
[02:56:06.792 --> 02:56:11.915]  You know, we need everybody's help and, you know, because again, ratings, it's a money business.
[02:56:11.915 --> 02:56:12.976]  Ratings win.
[02:56:12.976 --> 02:56:19.680]  And if we get the ratings, I can, with everybody's help, we can beat back these people that want us up here.
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:20.901]  And these are big, powerful people.
[02:56:21.394 --> 02:56:23.035]  Michael, let me throw this out at you.
[02:56:23.035 --> 02:56:27.739]  I don't want you to get in trouble for saying too much, but I know quite a bit about behind the scenes.
[02:56:27.739 --> 02:56:31.641]  They've had people in suits digging through Tyrell Ventura's trash.
[02:56:31.641 --> 02:56:32.922]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[02:56:32.922 --> 02:56:44.511]  But obviously, and we talked a little bit behind the scenes, because this is seen as a genre by the establishment, if this is a hit show, which it is, now other people are going to pitch these shows on other networks.
[02:56:45.151 --> 02:56:45.471]  Yes.
[02:56:45.471 --> 02:56:45.571]  Yes.
[02:57:02.065 --> 02:57:02.546]  Big time.
[02:57:02.546 --> 02:57:04.509]  And it's exactly right.
[02:57:04.509 --> 02:57:07.873]  If we weren't a successful show, we wouldn't have any problems.
[02:57:07.873 --> 02:57:09.476]  Because then we'd be below the radar.
[02:57:09.476 --> 02:57:18.008]  And I think we ran below the radar in the first year, and now suddenly we're back and we're doing numbers and we're doing stuff like FEMA camps, the conspiracy to steal water.
[02:57:19.189 --> 02:57:24.272]  You know, when you do this stuff, you know, suddenly people in high positions, they start to take notice.
[02:57:24.272 --> 02:57:27.653]  And suddenly, you start to get all kinds of strange things happening to you.
[02:57:27.653 --> 02:57:29.534]  Some of them, you know, I can't talk about.
[02:57:29.534 --> 02:57:33.436]  I know Tyrell talked about the guy going through his trash.
[02:57:33.436 --> 02:57:37.258]  I've had some things happen to me on Facebook that are, they're killing.
[02:57:37.990 --> 02:57:39.312]  They're chilling.
[02:57:39.312 --> 02:57:49.286]  I mean, again, I'm not an alarmist kind of guy, you know, Alex, but I am now convinced there are forces out there who, again, who do not want this show to continue.
[02:57:49.286 --> 02:57:51.629]  Yeah, they go out and do horrible things and say, you did it.
[02:57:51.629 --> 02:57:52.330]  I know what they do.
[02:57:52.330 --> 02:57:54.233]  I've been going through it for 15 years.
[02:57:54.233 --> 02:57:54.774]  Yeah, have you?
[02:57:54.774 --> 02:57:54.934]  Yeah.
[02:57:55.374 --> 02:57:56.735]  But the tide is turning.
[02:57:56.735 --> 02:58:01.679]  And you talk about how many big Hollywood stars you talk to who are tired of the left-right paradigm.
[02:58:01.679 --> 02:58:04.641]  They're tired of the old guard.
[02:58:04.641 --> 02:58:05.762]  They want to cover real issues.
[02:58:05.762 --> 02:58:07.704]  They don't want to just be a liberal or a conservative.
[02:58:07.704 --> 02:58:08.965]  They want to talk about real issues.
[02:58:09.878 --> 02:58:13.220]  Well, I always tell people this has nothing to do with liberal or conservative.
[02:58:13.220 --> 02:58:16.622]  The show tonight, as I said, they're targeting everybody.
[02:58:16.622 --> 02:58:19.023]  This police state show, they're after everybody.
[02:58:19.023 --> 02:58:30.269]  If you like guns, if you're against abortion, if you're in the Tea Party movement, if you're a leftist, whatever you are, as long as you're not toeing the line and marching in lockstep, they want you.
[02:58:30.689 --> 02:58:32.872]  All right, I'm going to talk to you as the show ends here.
[02:58:32.872 --> 02:58:35.014]  Retransmission comes up with so much key info.
[02:58:35.014 --> 02:58:35.876]  Stay with us.
[02:58:35.876 --> 02:58:37.077]  It airs tonight, 9 p.m.
[02:58:37.077 --> 02:58:37.998]  Central, 10 p.m.
[02:58:37.998 --> 02:58:39.099]  Eastern, True TV.
[02:58:39.099 --> 02:58:40.701]  It's Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[02:58:40.701 --> 02:58:43.144]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:43.144 --> 02:58:46.809]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.732 --> 02:58:56.275]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:56.275 --> 02:58:57.196]  Number 1.
[02:58:57.196 --> 02:59:00.619]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.619 --> 02:59:01.479]  Number 2.
[02:59:01.479 --> 02:59:06.383]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:06.383 --> 02:59:07.123]  It's true.
[02:59:07.123 --> 02:59:11.987]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.987 --> 02:59:12.828]  Number 3.
[02:59:12.828 --> 02:59:16.410]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:16.410 --> 02:59:20.113]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:20.313 --> 02:59:21.094]  Number 4.
[02:59:21.094 --> 02:59:23.855]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.855 --> 02:59:27.537]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:27.537 --> 02:59:28.338]  Number 5.
[02:59:28.338 --> 02:59:32.480]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:32.480 --> 02:59:37.243]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
