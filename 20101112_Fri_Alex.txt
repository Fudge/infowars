[00:00.000 --> 00:12.720]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.720 --> 00:21.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.480 --> 00:30.320]  well we're gonna have another jam-packed radio broadcast today it is Friday the
[00:30.320 --> 00:38.680]  12th day of November 2010 coming up we've got Wayne Madsen joining us for 30
[00:38.680 --> 00:44.640]  minutes he's got the headline it's up at info wars.com Wayne Madsen China fired
[00:44.640 --> 00:50.800]  missiles seen in southern California we really respect Wayne and his analysis
[00:50.800 --> 00:57.280]  and breakdown others are saying that they've gone and looked at basically
[00:57.280 --> 01:03.400]  FAA documents where the Navy files with the airlines and others when they're
[01:03.400 --> 01:07.520]  going to be doing missile test and that it was a US Navy missile test I don't
[01:07.520 --> 01:11.520]  know we just know it's not a contrail like we've been told and they've had
[01:11.520 --> 01:17.080]  former top Pentagon brass NASA experts come out and say that's a missile trail
[01:17.080 --> 01:22.240]  of a large sea-launched missile and that's been out since day one but the
[01:22.240 --> 01:25.880]  government is still saying it's a contrail so we'll be looking at that with
[01:25.880 --> 01:33.080]  Wayne Madsen coming up in about an hour and a half from now obviously the whole
[01:33.080 --> 01:40.200]  naked-body scanner TSA molestation pat down has gone into supernova when you
[01:40.200 --> 01:44.920]  talk about it being one of the biggest stories in the world right now and at the
[01:44.920 --> 01:50.280]  very forefront of that is info wars.com prison planet.com and the drudge
[01:50.280 --> 01:55.880]  report it is the drudge report that has driven this the last two weeks to be the
[01:55.880 --> 02:01.960]  firestorm it is now today liken it to the drudge report being the giant howitzer
[02:01.960 --> 02:06.960]  cannon firing info wars and prison planet Sabo munitions where the
[02:06.960 --> 02:12.760]  munitions drudge report is the cannon now I told you this years ago that the
[02:12.760 --> 02:17.960]  naked-body scanners are getting a biometric reading of your body wired
[02:17.960 --> 02:21.320]  magazine then reported they are coming out with cameras on street poles that
[02:21.320 --> 02:24.840]  can look through your clothes just like they can face scan you retina scan you
[02:24.840 --> 02:30.280]  thumb scan you hand scan you fingers scan you voice print scan you then get
[02:30.280 --> 02:34.080]  biometrics off of any of this it's all individual but the best way is to have a
[02:34.080 --> 02:40.600]  whole body scan now it's in market watch I guess that's a division of news core
[02:40.600 --> 02:44.720]  just a little blurb yesterday that a listener emailed us very thankful for
[02:44.720 --> 02:51.400]  that naked-body scanners to store biometrics Kurt Nemo info wars.com I
[02:51.400 --> 02:54.320]  think this is a report that drudge really ought to look into even if it
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.360]  doesn't link to our story to the market watch article dealing with this this is
[02:59.360 --> 03:03.480]  a big big deal and they they say in the press release all the scanners are
[03:03.480 --> 03:09.160]  already kind of getting your biometrics now we just put in software that you
[03:09.160 --> 03:14.400]  quote tells us if you are who you say you are so see they're putting you through
[03:14.400 --> 03:17.200]  the scanners they've already got your name your social security number your
[03:17.200 --> 03:21.320]  driver's license number then they get that body print and now they can attach
[03:21.320 --> 03:24.760]  it to your name just like when you go into thumb print or face scan digital
[03:24.760 --> 03:29.040]  photo the driver's license they can now attach it to your name it's a little
[03:29.040 --> 03:33.080]  harder for them to just face scan you on the street and then try to tie it to what
[03:33.080 --> 03:39.880]  car you get in off your license plate and then assign a name to the body print
[03:39.880 --> 03:44.840]  they want your DNA they want your biometric data that's why for 39 years
[03:44.840 --> 03:49.120]  from Australia to Canada to the United States from England to Germany it's
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.160]  now declassified blood is taken from all babies that are born in hospitals under
[03:53.160 --> 03:59.320]  a secret federal mandate now public and put in a global DNA database and they're
[03:59.320 --> 04:02.800]  already using it quote and crime investigations in Australia that's when
[04:02.800 --> 04:05.760]  it really started to break mainstream news five years ago people started to
[04:05.760 --> 04:09.880]  actually listen to us families filed suit in Minnesota and Texas and now
[04:09.880 --> 04:13.360]  they've been forced to declassify it but it's just an example of how they
[04:13.360 --> 04:16.920]  operate they're getting your biometrics with these scanners they're not just
[04:16.920 --> 04:20.840]  humiliating you and violating your fourth amendment and now with the Pat Downs the
[04:20.840 --> 04:27.360]  TSA admitted and told Atlantic Monthly they're doing this for humiliation to
[04:27.360 --> 04:33.760]  force you into the body scanners and so it's operant Pavlovian conditioning it's
[04:33.760 --> 04:37.680]  like a shock you know if you don't do what they're wanting you to do we've got
[04:37.680 --> 04:42.240]  another big development that our video slash photo experts we got some real
[04:42.240 --> 04:45.480]  experts working here in the office have have blown up and Photoshop and looked
[04:45.480 --> 04:49.640]  at it appears to be real it's from a photographer on flicker who was in the
[04:49.640 --> 04:54.240]  airport will tell you about what he saw and the photograph that's going up on
[04:54.240 --> 04:58.360]  infowars.com the next 20 minutes Kurt Nemo's writing a story on it when we
[04:58.360 --> 05:04.400]  come back stay with us hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the
[05:04.400 --> 05:09.400]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[05:09.400 --> 05:13.200]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[05:13.200 --> 05:17.880]  Americans at home turning members influence on our president in Congress
[05:17.880 --> 05:23.280]  and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[05:23.280 --> 05:28.120]  American citizens to pay attention fall the Republic identifies the enemies of
[05:28.120 --> 05:33.200]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and

[09:44.560 --> 09:50.280]  Reuters story pilots and passengers rail at new airport pat downs there's an
[09:50.280 --> 09:54.080]  emergency meeting today happening with homeland security director Janet
[09:54.080 --> 10:00.200]  Napolitano and some of the biggest tourist lobbies and hotel lobbies in
[10:00.200 --> 10:06.840]  the country they've got four different pilot unions some of them the biggest
[10:06.840 --> 10:11.800]  they've got five different flight attendant unions they've got airport
[10:11.800 --> 10:16.880]  worker unions the TSA has not been allowed to unionize they've been angry
[10:16.880 --> 10:20.680]  they're made to go through these and there's been cases where TSA employees
[10:20.680 --> 10:26.400]  are made fun of every day for the size of their genitals and so they punch their
[10:26.400 --> 10:30.920]  supervisor in the nose and they get arrested remember that came out a few
[10:30.920 --> 10:35.280]  months ago the guy said I've told you five times this is the end pow right in
[10:35.280 --> 10:41.400]  the nose because they would make fun of the size of his genitalia that's AP
[10:41.400 --> 10:47.600]  Reuters that's old news been out for what three months or more so all of that
[10:47.600 --> 10:52.440]  is going on and you've got the TSA lying about recording the images you've
[10:52.440 --> 10:57.480]  got the TSA lying about radiation dangers and being caught lying the TSA two
[10:57.480 --> 11:01.760]  weeks ago announced we started really hammering this then that yes not only if
[11:01.760 --> 11:05.720]  you refuse the body scanner will you get the enhanced pat down we will touch
[11:05.720 --> 11:09.840]  your genitals we will touch your breasts we will squeeze them to make sure
[11:09.840 --> 11:14.520]  they're not bombs and people describe it as very painful then they came out last
[11:14.520 --> 11:19.320]  week and said we're not doing that in official press releases contradicting
[11:19.320 --> 11:24.400]  everything they'd already told USA Today LA Times New York Times Washington
[11:24.400 --> 11:30.800]  Post now there are pilots and flight attendants and doctors and police and
[11:30.800 --> 11:38.200]  Muslim groups just everybody is up in an uproar when Obama landed in India they
[11:38.200 --> 11:40.880]  had top ministers bringing it up to him
[11:40.880 --> 11:45.840]  tourism's down by over a third just a few years ago the reportedly it's
[11:45.840 --> 11:51.640]  intensifying people won't fly to Disney World they won't fly you know to two
[11:51.640 --> 11:58.000]  different theme parks tourism is way down there's a no fly day coming up in a
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.440]  few weeks on Thanksgiving about two weeks all all of this is now happening and
[12:04.440 --> 12:11.000]  and so this simmering boiling anger and frustration at this asinine searches in
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.840]  the name of terrorism and if you really believe it's Muslims that are doing all
[12:13.840 --> 12:17.880]  this which of course 99% of the time at stage and it's not why aren't they being
[12:17.880 --> 12:21.480]  singled out why aren't they being searched why aren't people what why aren't
[12:21.480 --> 12:25.160]  people affiliated with radical groups on the watch list why is it gun owners
[12:25.160 --> 12:29.560]  conservatives members of Congress because it's for the American people as the
[12:29.560 --> 12:33.640]  Mayak and Homeland Security reports that we got from law enforcement almost two
[12:33.640 --> 12:38.000]  years ago January and February respectively got the mic report in
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.680]  January the Homeland Security report in February of 2009 over a year and a half
[12:42.680 --> 12:48.200]  ago 95% of it and Napolitano now admits this Janet Napolitano that the main
[12:48.200 --> 12:51.200]  focus is returning veterans and gun owners
[12:51.200 --> 12:55.600]  conservatives libertarians and I know I hammer that home a lot but but you need
[12:55.600 --> 12:59.680]  to hammer that home to everyone you know and so this big international debate
[12:59.680 --> 13:03.960]  is now on I'd say four or five days ago this was the fourth or fifth biggest
[13:03.960 --> 13:12.200]  story in the world it is now the biggest story in the world even bigger than
[13:12.200 --> 13:16.520]  all the major finance ministers saying we're going into a depression total
[13:16.520 --> 13:20.760]  dollar collapse and our own government saying that this is a great way to help
[13:20.760 --> 13:24.960]  the world to devalue the dollar I think that should probably be the biggest
[13:24.960 --> 13:29.520]  story it's now the second biggest story in the world and we're going to be
[13:29.520 --> 13:36.600]  covering it today with Bob Chapman coming up we've got Wayne Madsen saying
[13:36.600 --> 13:40.080]  China fired missiles seen in southern California we're gonna get some other
[13:40.080 --> 13:45.960]  views of this as well coming up Wayne joins us in about an hour and 15 minutes
[13:45.960 --> 13:49.560]  always informative and revealing and so many times what he covers turns out to
[13:49.560 --> 13:53.040]  be true no matter how wild it sounds and I've seen other mainstream articles
[13:53.040 --> 13:55.720]  saying it might have been China or North Korea I don't know we're just
[13:55.720 --> 13:58.840]  investigating this because you've asked us to investigate it we're going to
[13:58.840 --> 14:06.280]  continue to look at it now when I got into the office a little bit later than
[14:06.280 --> 14:10.920]  usual about 30 minutes before showtime Rob do came to me and they'd been for
[14:10.920 --> 14:16.200]  hours looking at this image we're about to put on screen now this is the
[14:16.200 --> 14:20.960]  screensaver image that was reportedly at the Indianapolis International
[14:20.960 --> 14:25.880]  Airport because they have the screened-in TSA offices where they look at the
[14:25.880 --> 14:30.240]  naked body scanner images that's not done up there at the terminals where the
[14:30.240 --> 14:33.680]  TSA people are being radiated and the citizens are being radiated having their
[14:33.680 --> 14:37.320]  rides violated it's done in these glassed-off areas and I before have
[14:37.320 --> 14:39.640]  walked up and looked through the windows and they get all angry and tell you to
[14:39.640 --> 14:42.600]  stop looking in because you know you might be a terrorist you know how dare
[14:42.600 --> 14:48.520]  you even look at them they they're like gods this this image reportedly on a
[14:48.520 --> 14:53.320]  photographer's flicker site he took this photo and we're trying to contact the
[14:53.320 --> 15:00.440]  the photographer we've looked at his site is a photographer and I've had several
[15:00.440 --> 15:07.320]  of our experts at Photoshop blowing it up on our big-screen computers and it
[15:07.320 --> 15:12.760]  appears to be real now a lot of other sites are going with it saying it is
[15:12.760 --> 15:19.040]  real you know the point is we're going to post it at info wars.com the next 10
[15:19.040 --> 15:23.240]  minutes curtain MO is in there doing it right now but for prison planet TV viewers
[15:23.240 --> 15:28.600]  we're gonna put this up right now it says my first cavity search helping your
[15:28.600 --> 15:34.000]  child understand why he may pose a threat to national security ages six and
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.680]  up homeland security and Matt Ryan made the point minutes before air he said
[15:39.680 --> 15:44.040]  you know this looks like from your TSA poster contest this was never submitted
[15:44.040 --> 15:51.040]  to us or we missed it hundreds were sent in that we had six months ago but I mean
[15:51.040 --> 15:58.000]  obviously yes this is satire there's no doubting that and maybe it's even a TSA
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.280]  person that's angry about what's going on I doubt that though because supervisors
[16:02.280 --> 16:07.400]  would get angry about something like this now here's the photo that's linked
[16:07.400 --> 16:11.720]  up on flicker and it's a high res photo it's through the glass and we'll blow it
[16:11.720 --> 16:16.920]  up on screen in the TSA command center you can see through the TSA command
[16:16.920 --> 16:30.400]  center looking out on the terminals go ahead and blow up that photo for me you
[16:30.400 --> 16:38.720]  can see that it is the screensaver image that we just showed you a crisp image
[16:38.720 --> 16:42.920]  of in the actual image not the photo of the image on a computer screen we've
[16:42.920 --> 16:48.560]  blown this up all the way and if it is a fake it's one of the best fakes we've
[16:48.560 --> 16:53.920]  ever seen I tend to really doubt it is a fake plus the photographers got nothing
[16:53.920 --> 16:58.680]  but legitimate stuff on their flicker site and other photos and is using their
[16:58.680 --> 17:02.240]  real name so again we're reaching out to them maybe we'll have them on Sunday
[17:02.240 --> 17:05.840]  maybe even today if we're able to get a hold of them I got three people in
[17:05.840 --> 17:10.760]  there trying to get a hold of this photographer now what does the image show
[17:10.760 --> 17:17.040]  it doesn't just say my first cavity search you know teaching children how
[17:17.040 --> 17:22.360]  they're a threat to national security and obviously it's satire but we have
[17:22.360 --> 17:27.160]  Atlantic Monthly Jeffrey Goldberg interviewing TSA and they admit it
[17:27.160 --> 17:33.040]  that they call it the male genital measurement device they use the street
[17:33.040 --> 17:40.360]  slang term it's the first name of Dick Cheney and they call it the the the male
[17:40.360 --> 17:44.880]  member measuring device and I'm sorry folks we don't talk about potty humor and
[17:44.880 --> 17:49.360]  stuff and things like this here on earth this is not Monty Python this is not you
[17:49.360 --> 17:55.000]  know Jay Leno this is not Benny Hill this is happening to our children our
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.680]  women this is happening to our society we have to cover this for some of the
[17:58.680 --> 18:04.320]  people that are you know more prudent out there I understand for the prudes I'm
[18:04.320 --> 18:08.120]  somewhat of one myself especially on radio it's very serious format but but
[18:08.120 --> 18:13.720]  let's go back let's go back to that photograph when you look at this this
[18:13.720 --> 18:19.720]  photograph and you go back it's important to realize that Jeff Goldberg
[18:19.720 --> 18:25.640]  Jeffrey Goldberg of Atlantic Monthly has reported as of two days ago that TSA told
[18:25.640 --> 18:29.400]  him that it's all a big joke and that they watch it in a separate room and
[18:29.400 --> 18:35.960]  that they call it the male genital measuring device how many TSA workers
[18:35.960 --> 18:40.600]  have been caught claiming they find drugs in people's bags repeatedly and
[18:40.600 --> 18:45.320]  demanding favors from them in some cases sexual how many TSA workers have been
[18:45.320 --> 18:49.160]  caught screaming and yelling and making fun of people and pulling good-looking
[18:49.160 --> 18:55.320]  women out of line and feeling them up how many TSA workers have been caught
[18:55.320 --> 19:01.080]  going crazy and saying I'm God I'm God I mean this is in the news every week most
[19:01.080 --> 19:05.040]  of them are just people that want a job 10 15 bucks an hour most of them are just
[19:05.040 --> 19:10.680]  people you know who are just applying for a job I've run into a lot of TSA that
[19:10.680 --> 19:14.840]  are fans of the show but more and more it's these control freaks who don't mind
[19:14.840 --> 19:19.560]  being radiated who don't mind violating people's rights who are either so stupid
[19:19.560 --> 19:26.120]  or so arrogant that they enjoy it so we do have a real history and this is what
[19:26.120 --> 19:29.560]  happens in concentration camps this is what happens in prisons this is what
[19:29.560 --> 19:33.880]  happened in the Stanford prison study people become dehumanized and they
[19:33.880 --> 19:37.600]  always make jokes it's like you know the Japanese cutting the heads off of our
[19:37.600 --> 19:42.840]  troops in World War two and playing soccer with their heads or the
[19:42.840 --> 19:47.640]  Pakistanis or Afghans famously will cut your head off and play polo with it when
[19:47.640 --> 19:51.780]  you have a brutal society they make a joke out of it to make it fun the
[19:51.780 --> 19:56.040]  Nazis did that as well so I believe the photo is real because it's par for the
[19:56.040 --> 20:00.200]  course we'll be right back stay with us

[24:28.440 --> 24:35.600]  surprise guest as well on this live Friday edition the 12th day of November
[24:35.600 --> 24:41.880]  2010 I want to get into the economy because we've been covering TSA so much
[24:41.880 --> 24:44.880]  but our listeners know what's happening we covered with Max Kaiser yesterday
[24:44.880 --> 24:48.040]  but there's been some big new developments the fighting between the
[24:48.040 --> 24:52.200]  central bank heads at least on the surface is intensifying that's coming
[24:52.200 --> 24:58.760]  up but I first just want to read to you the Reuters report that backs up our
[24:58.760 --> 25:08.480]  report big sis forced to respond to nationwide revolt against TSA that's
[25:08.480 --> 25:13.560]  the headline again top story on drudge report comm as well pilots and
[25:13.560 --> 25:20.080]  passengers rail at new airport pat downs this is Reuters last night and it
[25:20.080 --> 25:23.000]  continues stepped-up security screening at airports in the wake of the foiled
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.400]  terrorist bombs have provoked an outcry from airline pilots and travelers you
[25:27.400 --> 25:30.360]  know those bombs were definitely sent because of the backlash already happening
[25:30.360 --> 25:35.320]  including parents of children who say they are too intrusive with the busiest
[25:35.320 --> 25:40.000]  holiday travel season nearing flyers face long security lines and new rigorous
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.200]  pat down checks that have begun in recent weeks amid the discovering of the
[25:45.200 --> 25:50.360]  of hidden explosives as a result some travelers are questioning whether to
[25:50.360 --> 25:53.760]  fly at all this is Reuters the transportation security administration
[25:53.760 --> 25:58.560]  has ramped up airport security after two pilots and two plots by al-Qaeda in the
[25:58.560 --> 26:02.240]  Arabian Peninsula yeah right and we're all a lock he admittedly works for the
[26:02.240 --> 26:06.320]  Pentagon this is behind it a Nigerian man hit a bomb in his underwear last
[26:06.320 --> 26:10.160]  Christmas again working for a lock he helped on the plane by the US government
[26:10.160 --> 26:14.520]  the State Department admits that course Reuters doesn't tell you that a Nigerian
[26:14.520 --> 26:19.800]  man hit a bomb in his underwear last Christmas and the group tied I tried to
[26:19.800 --> 26:25.440]  send package bombs via US cargo planes but none of the explosives detonated to
[26:25.440 --> 26:30.120]  thwart such an attacks TSA is deploying body scanning machines to US
[26:30.120 --> 26:33.960]  airports they ordered them two years before with shirt off making the order
[26:33.960 --> 26:37.360]  the head of Homeland Security he's now the CEO of the main company that sold
[26:37.360 --> 26:41.760]  most of the machines you got to love that he makes the purchase orders for
[26:41.760 --> 26:45.960]  billions and billions of dollars spent almost three billion each year so we're
[26:45.960 --> 26:50.360]  talking about six billion total and then he's the CEO of the company when he
[26:50.360 --> 26:55.680]  leaves that's a good that's a delayed payoff that is illegal according to all
[26:55.680 --> 27:00.960]  the information I have to thwart such an attacks TSA is deploying body scanning
[27:00.960 --> 27:04.840]  machines to US airports but travelers and pilots have complained about
[27:04.840 --> 27:09.240]  potential health risk and that they are too intrusive the alternative is a
[27:09.240 --> 27:13.520]  physical pat down by a TSA officer which even USA Today reports means
[27:13.520 --> 27:17.760]  touching your genitals pilots are not a terrorist threat said John Pratt are
[27:17.760 --> 27:21.720]  president of the airline pilots Association that's the biggest one and a
[27:21.720 --> 27:25.960]  veteran pilot for United Continental
[27:28.640 --> 27:33.280]  seeing scarce security resources being used on pilots makes absolutely no sense
[27:33.280 --> 27:36.320]  so yeah you're gonna trust them to fly the plane but we got a pat them down
[27:36.320 --> 27:40.760]  yeah make it use the plane as a weapon it's ridiculous even if you trust them
[27:40.760 --> 27:44.400]  to fly the plane there should be no security some pilots male and female
[27:44.400 --> 27:47.960]  that complain the pat downs make them feel uncomfortable yeah their their
[27:47.960 --> 27:51.240]  reports are that it hurts and they grab their breasts and generals the group
[27:51.240 --> 27:56.080]  urged any pilot who feels unfit for duty afterward because they're shook up to
[27:56.080 --> 27:59.400]  call in sick and remove themselves from the trip so that's a form of strike
[27:59.400 --> 28:02.880]  that's already happening this is prompted urgent talks between the
[28:02.880 --> 28:08.720]  pilots group and the TSA administer again this is prompted urgent talks
[28:08.720 --> 28:15.880]  between the TSA and the pilots group and the TSA administer John pistol Lee the
[28:15.880 --> 28:22.520]  two sides hope to resolve the matter in a few weeks Pratt are said now before I
[28:22.520 --> 28:26.200]  get into the hardcore info as I babble through this article because as I'm
[28:26.200 --> 28:30.680]  thinking as I'm reading I'm thinking of all the different angles here remember
[28:30.680 --> 28:34.960]  just three weeks ago a pilot said no to the pat downs and no to the scanners
[28:34.960 --> 28:39.760]  and then they wouldn't let him fly and then he got in all this trouble then
[28:39.760 --> 28:43.320]  they threatened to fire him and he stood his ground now it's thousands of
[28:43.320 --> 28:48.680]  pilots tens of thousands of flight attendants airport workers TSA agents
[28:48.680 --> 28:53.960]  complaining about it see one guy stood up and now everybody's standing up what
[28:53.960 --> 28:57.160]  do they say in the movie a bug's life the grasshopper they're saying why are we
[28:57.160 --> 29:00.920]  oppressing these ants we don't need them for food we don't need them as slaves
[29:00.920 --> 29:06.640]  and the head grasshopper says those little puny ants outnumber us a hundred
[29:06.640 --> 29:12.000]  to one and if they ever figure that out our way of life is over so those of you
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.840]  that call yourselves patriots say we have no power anybody that says we can
[29:15.840 --> 29:20.520]  change things or make them better is a liar that is defeatist globalist
[29:20.520 --> 29:24.400]  propaganda it is a lie I'm gonna come back and into the most hardcore
[29:24.400 --> 29:28.200]  information on this front because they've got the travel agencies the
[29:28.200 --> 29:33.200]  hotels the theme park heads not just the unions this revolt is becoming
[29:33.200 --> 29:38.920]  absolutely massive now no doubt the globalist are gonna launch some more
[29:38.920 --> 29:43.400]  bombs on planes I have no doubt of that to try to get this through because it's
[29:43.400 --> 29:46.680]  not just about the billions for the scanners it's about teaching us that
[29:46.680 --> 29:50.040]  they're the boss and it's about federalizing the streets of America
[29:50.040 --> 29:57.240]  next we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[32:01.920 --> 32:05.880]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[32:05.880 --> 32:09.680]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[32:09.680 --> 32:14.040]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[32:14.040 --> 32:18.480]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[32:18.480 --> 32:22.920]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[32:22.920 --> 32:27.680]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[32:27.680 --> 32:31.440]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[32:31.440 --> 32:35.080]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[40:00.280 --> 40:04.680]  California I know it was neck and neck in the polls it'd be a 20% tax on
[40:04.680 --> 40:13.120]  anything producing carbon dioxide and imagine a 20% tax on top of everything
[40:13.120 --> 40:16.920]  in California what industry won't leave to another state like Texas or won't
[40:16.920 --> 40:20.600]  leave to China or won't leave to South Korea where there's none of these carbon
[40:20.600 --> 40:25.800]  taxes so just look that up I forget the prompt number but I want to see if you
[40:25.800 --> 40:32.280]  know something like voters reject greenhouse curbs they don't even call
[40:32.280 --> 40:37.080]  it attacks or voters pass I don't know because it was they'd already passed the

[42:29.120 --> 42:32.320]  like Muslims get to wear their headdresses and cover their faces when
[42:32.320 --> 42:36.520]  they get driver's license photos but Willie Nelson this has been in the news
[42:36.520 --> 42:41.800]  he's told you take that cowboy hat off boy

[43:25.440 --> 43:30.280]  been caught in lies think of the power we have as citizens to take action through
[43:30.280 --> 43:35.360]  the alternative media which is why they want to shut it down some travelers are
[43:35.360 --> 43:38.960]  also livid about how children are being screened during a trip last Sunday by a
[43:38.960 --> 43:41.960]  father and son through Orlando Airport in Florida the eight-year-old boy was
[43:41.960 --> 43:45.080]  selected for extra screening by the TSA after going through the metal detector
[43:45.080 --> 43:48.440]  the fathers of the officer described the procedure before conducting it then he
[43:48.440 --> 43:52.360]  patted down the boy in an open security area using the backside of his hands to
[43:52.360 --> 43:55.880]  check the genital area see that's not even enhanced I didn't think it was
[43:55.880 --> 44:00.360]  going to be as horrible as he was describing to the boy's father Bill who
[44:00.360 --> 44:04.200]  works as a lobbyist in Washington and did not want his full name used see you
[44:04.200 --> 44:08.480]  got all these New York Times and Washington Post and high-powered lobbyist
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.920]  and governors like Jesse Ventura I've been with him when he's like that's why

[44:16.720 --> 44:20.760]  Germany checkpoint Charlie as I was watching him go up his legs and his
[44:20.760 --> 44:29.960]  genitals pat in his chest putting their hands on his on his glutus maximus because
[44:29.960 --> 44:37.560]  he has a metal hip the father said he didn't believe it be as horrible as it
[44:37.560 --> 44:43.120]  was described the lobbyist said we we spend my child's whole life telling him
[44:43.120 --> 44:46.720]  that only mom dad or a doctor can touch you in a private area and now we have
[44:46.720 --> 44:51.720]  TSA agents and that's just wrong he told Reuters at some point the terrorists
[44:51.720 --> 44:55.160]  have won yeah the terrorists that carried out the attacks that run the
[44:55.160 --> 44:59.280]  government pal you got it the terrorists are winning but now we're fighting back
[44:59.280 --> 45:04.320]  TSA defends the body scanners is safe and says the devices and friskings are
[45:04.320 --> 45:08.640]  key tools to detect hidden explosives and it goes on with the baloney so a total
[45:08.640 --> 45:15.920]  revolt drudge has top-linked our key report big sis forced to respond to
[45:15.920 --> 45:21.320]  nationwide revolt top story on info wars calm and prison planet calm it's the

[45:28.440 --> 45:36.360]  new article so under the photo of Bush Napolitano Janet Napolitano is the
[45:36.360 --> 45:43.440]  link to TSA desktop image makes joke of cavity searching children and then it
[45:43.440 --> 45:49.160]  ties into all the confirmed TSA jokes the vulgar names they have for the x-ray
[45:49.160 --> 45:53.880]  machines the x-ray body scanners again I'm not going to repeat what they call
[45:53.880 --> 45:57.960]  it you can read the Atlantic Monthly blurb we have here's Curt Nemo's article
[45:57.960 --> 46:01.880]  excellent job but Curt getting this article done in 30 minutes TSA desktop
[46:01.880 --> 46:07.160]  image makes joke of cavity searching children a flicker photo shows a
[46:07.160 --> 46:12.960]  computer in a TSA airport office with a desktop image of a satirical book
[46:12.960 --> 46:18.960]  entry my first cavity search our photo and Photoshop experts have examined the
[46:18.960 --> 46:22.440]  image and believe it's real info wars commas currently to contact the flicker
[46:22.440 --> 46:26.560]  photographer to establish the image is real in January the Guardian reported
[46:26.560 --> 46:29.880]  that experts determined the naked body scanner technology violates shall
[46:29.880 --> 46:33.920]  protection laws which ban the creation of indecent images of children the
[46:33.920 --> 46:38.040]  British government department for transport confirmed that child porn
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.640]  problem was among the legal and operational issues under discussion
[46:41.640 --> 46:45.680]  within the government so they just violate the law since the introduction of
[46:45.680 --> 46:48.560]  airport scanners there have been countless complaints regarding privacy
[46:48.560 --> 46:56.040]  issues earlier this year a TSA employee in Miami was arrested after he
[46:56.040 --> 47:00.480]  physically assaulted a co-worker who had joked about the size of his genitals
[47:00.480 --> 47:06.480]  as the neocon Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in October the TSA considers the backscatter
[47:06.480 --> 47:12.000]  scanners and the opt-out manual search comical Goldberg asked the TSA officer if
[47:12.000 --> 47:14.920]  he knew the Department of Homeland Security's guidelines involving a
[47:14.920 --> 47:18.520]  cavity search no way you think Congress would allow that the TSA employee
[47:18.520 --> 47:24.360]  responded Congress may be squeamish about the anal cavity searches but if the
[47:24.360 --> 47:28.040]  photo below is indeed real employs the TSA consider the most humiliating form of
[47:28.040 --> 47:32.040]  molestation to be a laughing matter especially when they are conducted on
[47:32.040 --> 47:37.920]  children that's good Kurt I want you Kurt misunderstood me when I said take a
[47:37.920 --> 47:42.880]  Jeffrey Goldberg quote there's a new article and it's in Paul Watson's article
[47:42.880 --> 47:49.680]  drudge report stirs TSA debate that has the newest Goldberg article where he
[47:49.680 --> 47:59.280]  interviews but this is pertinent as well where where he interviews the TSA and
[47:59.280 --> 48:08.760]  they call it the male member measurement system so well we're gonna the
[48:08.760 --> 48:13.960]  articles up we're gonna get beefed up I also want to add other abuse saying again
[48:13.960 --> 48:18.440]  we don't know if this photo is real but it appears to be and look at how they
[48:18.440 --> 48:23.160]  you know plant drugs on people or fake drugs and then demand favors or the TSA
[48:23.160 --> 48:25.720]  workers who've been caught being pedophiles I want to add the pedophile
[48:25.720 --> 48:30.840]  stuff a let's write it down right now I want to add this is all live time folks
[48:30.840 --> 48:37.960]  wargame on the air info or declared on the globalist I want the pedophile cases
[48:37.960 --> 48:44.160]  exposed I want the death cases added where they killed people I want the Jeff
[48:44.160 --> 48:52.220]  Goldberg I want the Jeff Goldberg latest piece and if you want to find it
[48:52.220 --> 48:57.040]  Kurt it's in Watson's last article drudge stirs debate about TSA screening
[48:57.040 --> 49:04.600]  it's got a link to it it's got the excised portion or the excerpt portion
[49:04.600 --> 49:09.320]  that I guess we excised out of his article and then excerpted into ours so
[49:09.320 --> 49:11.800]  I want to get that in there because I want to give people a full spectrum
[49:11.800 --> 49:17.960]  breakdown of this but excellent job and when you go to the bottom of the

[54:19.440 --> 54:23.200]  patriot movement that's what he said we played the clip on playing in later when
[54:23.200 --> 54:31.640]  Bob Chapman's on with us to get his take on it but but we tried to make the term
[54:31.640 --> 54:35.440]  stage terror the number one search term it became the number two search term
[54:35.440 --> 54:38.680]  yesterday because it couldn't become number one because you made FEMA camps
[54:38.680 --> 54:44.280]  number one great job folks great job in the info war we declare the info war we
[54:44.280 --> 54:48.320]  declare major offensives in the info war that we're intensifying what we're

[55:07.360 --> 55:11.880]  the commenter said hey Alex get yourself together beta test this better
[55:11.880 --> 55:16.520]  FEMA camps became the number one search term but your articles about it were
[55:16.520 --> 55:22.480]  nowhere yes and it's not because we use too simple of a term sir as you said
[55:22.480 --> 55:26.280]  and not that we're perfect we learn new stuff all the time and a lot of you help
[55:26.280 --> 55:30.040]  us it was a listeners idea to do search terms four or five months ago now we've
[55:30.040 --> 55:36.600]  had over 40 of them that are top search terms if you put the headline in for
[55:36.600 --> 55:41.920]  prison planet or info wars under Google news it was completely blocked they blocked
[55:41.920 --> 55:48.640]  our articles yesterday it wasn't that we didn't use a complex enough term as you
[55:48.640 --> 55:52.320]  recommended he wanted to say bombshell FEMA camps because that was our
[55:52.320 --> 55:59.480]  headline that wasn't it my friend they completely blocked on web and on news
[55:59.480 --> 56:03.280]  when you clicked on the top search term it was nowhere but that didn't stop

[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:31.360]  report will be joining us he's got a lot of good sources from we work with the
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:36.800]  NFJ he says China fired a missile seen in southern California is a threat
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.560]  North Korea does that type of thing routinely against Japan and South
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:46.360]  Korea very bizarre but we've got other reports and Paul Watson's vetting these
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.240]  and looking into them one of them is from Mike Rivera what really happened
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:54.200]  confirmed US Navy was testing missile launch off the coast of California and
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:59.320]  and I I've looked into this my shelf previously they've got to tell the FAA
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.640]  when they're going to be testing high-powered missiles they didn't do
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:06.480]  that with flight 800 TWA and that did come out that that was a Navy test
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:09.640]  missile that blew that aircraft out of the air so many years ago and hair
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:21.200]  Clinton covered that up but there is a Pentagon report naval air warfare
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:28.280]  center to the FAA telling them the degrees the latitude the longitude and
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:37.960]  areas not to fly into Monday through Friday this week so I don't know what
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.160]  to say about all this we're just looking at it trying to figure out exactly
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:52.520]  what's happening on that front we've got Wayne Madsen as I said coming up
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:59.440]  there's a new report up on prisonplanet.com by Paul Watson Steve Watson
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.280]  they're on fire over there world battles the invasion of the naked body
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:09.400]  scanners and it breaks down just the incredible full on assault as people
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.480]  realize the Emperor has no clothes now I'm also going to be getting into the
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.560]  unbelievably important developments on the economy but I want to open the
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.880]  phones up in the next segment for quick comments or questions on your view on
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.480]  this revolt against the TSA takeover of society similar things happening in
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.000]  Europe and what's happening with the announcement of the dollar devaluation
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:39.160]  gold and silver exploding off the chart 1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231 and we
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:44.360]  will get you up and on the air on this live Friday edition then I'll even take
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:48.280]  a few calls for Wayne on the missile issue once he gets on with us and then
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:53.120]  Bob Chapman and then I'm gonna get back into Glenn Beck says government
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:03:01.000]  preparing a stage terror that is so so important that he did that I mean that
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.680]  is just what regardless what you think of Glenn Beck the fact that he came out
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.880]  and said look all these Clinton and Obama people are talking about how great
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.440]  an Oklahoma City or 9-11 would be and they're putting all these memos saying
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:17.240]  it's gonna be Patriot's fault and Glenn said he's being blamed in them George
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:21.320]  Soros media matters and a bunch of other publications they say Glenn Beck and
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:26.400]  Alex Jones they had some nut a few months ago have a shootout on the highway
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.280]  up by San Francisco said he was going to the Tides Foundation that Beck talks
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.600]  about all the time to kill people and the media said that Glenn Beck and Alex
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.840]  Jones are causing and he was fans of them and they're gonna cause a new
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.680]  Oklahoma City so yes Beck we've been warning you for months they are framing
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.480]  you and I and every other person whether you're a real Patriot or not just
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:52.360]  across the board I don't know if you're a real Patriot pal I know I am but it's
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.520]  just like the Mike and Homeland Security report a year and a half ago you
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.920]  made jokes about on air you said oh maybe this is good maybe Ron Paul supporters
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:04.640]  might be dangerous maybe remember all that and I got so angry at you Beck how
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.680]  do you like it how do you like seeing them gear up to blow up something and
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:15.840]  blame it on us how do you like it buddy boy how do you like neocon websites
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:21.200]  multiple sites today attacking you saying you're a 9-11 truth or you've got
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.720]  Democratic operative saying Obama needs a terror attack like Oklahoma City you've
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.800]  got Soros's operatives saying that Glenn Beck and I are gonna cause an Oklahoma
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:35.320]  City bombing every stinking day every day there's articles they're out in the
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:41.720]  open saying what they're gonna do and you finally face reality and say you're
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:47.320]  being set up with another bombing and you're called a 9-11 truth or how do
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.720]  you like that pal so you're not supposed to talk about the big secret like
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:56.240]  Gulf of Tonkin Northwoods and Ajax and Gladio and all these staged events

[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:17.040]  birth to force inoculations on us and people are saying no no no so nationwide
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:21.400]  revolt against the TSA big sis forced to respond to nationwide revolt against
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:28.800]  TSA let's make revolt against TSA numero uno search term today let's do it
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:34.680]  together Alina in California thanks for holding you're on the air hey Alex I
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:39.560]  just want to let you know that I am planning on flying to New York in the
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.920]  next week and I'm definitely gonna be opting out of this naked body scanner
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:49.240]  on I've basically been word of mouth spreading that that this is going on and
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:53.320]  then opt out of the of the of the of the rate down because people are and they
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.680]  admit there and I would tell them look I know you're supposed to manhandle me to
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.120]  make me go to the scanner oh that's the other big news they admit that they're
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.320]  getting biometrics with them did you know that no I didn't but now what now
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.400]  how is it that a guy can pat me down I mean not that a woman it's any better
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:13.720]  but that seems a little odd that if I do do the pat down why is it a guy can pat
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:18.280]  me down I heard your your one of your workers talking about that and how she
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:23.040]  noticed that yep in the TSA has tried to deny that look it's just as bad to have
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.560]  a woman do it but societally it's seen as having you know a woman pat down a
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.240]  man a man pat down a woman because then it's seen as more sexual because it's
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:35.280]  hard for it not to be sexual look I am married I love my wife I'm into my wife
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:42.160]  but before I was married and still I'm into my significant other my wife being
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:45.400]  into me I'm not one of these people that some people do like it when you're not
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:51.720]  into it but I would not be able to even a very attractive woman I would be
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:56.400]  disgraced I would be revolted by coming up and putting my hands between her legs
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:01.280]  and lifting up they have to put pressure and squeezing around a woman I mean that
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:08.800]  would totally traumatize me not just the woman I mean it's just horrible you know
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:11.400]  I'm the type of guy that you know is out to eat with friends and I'm the guy
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.680]  buying dinner and drinks I like people to have pleasure I like people to be
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.640]  happy I enjoy that atmosphere who wants to work in a place humiliating people
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.680]  all day bathing them in radiation and grabbing their genitals well you're
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:29.440]  gonna get either idiots or desperate people or pedophiles control freaks
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.520]  gropers and it's been all over the news for years they single out the attractive
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.200]  women and I was witnessing it just a few weeks ago flying myself go ahead people
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.560]  are basically like you've always said on a power trip they have that suit on they
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.720]  got that wand and they're they're basically on a power trip and they're
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.560]  they're robots so they're you know somebody's pulling their strings
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:55.080]  basically now I've posted this on my Facebook and I've sent emails about the
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.960]  naked body scanners and people are saying oh Alina you know it's all
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:02.640]  conspiracy theories and blah blah blah blah blah all that BS and it's like you
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.840]  know what look it up yeah yeah no no no that's the normal response you tell
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:10.280]  somebody 11 years ago the Glass-Steagall Act will devalue the currency and give
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:14.000]  the bankers tens of trillions of dollars to buy up the economy then they're
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.640]  gonna implode it to set up a new global government oh that's a conspiracy theory
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.120]  now it's happening and a lot of people still say it's a conspiracy theory even
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.200]  when it's all over the newspapers and it's the same thing with this we are
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.080]  still seeing articles and the TSA is saying we do not touch your genitals we
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.920]  do not squeeze your breast even in their own press releases two and a half three
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:39.640]  weeks ago they announced this they told USA Today this but now they're denying
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:44.000]  it even though it's on the news video them of doing it so what happens to the
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.960]  average coward who doesn't feel powerful or who likes to go along with tyranny
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.680]  because it makes them feel like they're part of the system is they will just
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:56.600]  deny what you're even saying that's the common knowledge that's the common
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:02.080]  wisdom is to be an idiot and to deny reality you know I mean the real
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.080]  unemployment's over 22% for two years a lot of yuppies go no it's 9.6% the
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:11.840]  government says so you know they they know you know putting a 20% tax on
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:17.520]  Californians will help the economy they enjoy being idiots you have the proof
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.800]  right in front of them you can send them articles I'm not going to do the
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.320]  research for them you let's say you present this information to these people
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:28.480]  they still want to call it conspiracy theories or Obama's great and I love
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:32.600]  what he's doing for the country blah blah blah it's so frustrating on my end
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.360]  just you know I do open my mouth a lot I'm very outspoken and I post these
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.640]  things a lot I spread the word but still you know you get the backflash of it's a
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.840]  conspiracy theory oh you're lying oh where are you getting your news
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.360]  information oh Alex Jones is crazy this and that you know it's just like you
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.240]  know that that's one part it's aspect of handling all of this is spreading the
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:59.960]  word and then dealing with the backlash and and trying to protect my
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:05.800]  information you know it and just like they stay true to my integrity here's
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.360]  what happens Alina and I appreciate your call and I'll briefly get into the
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:12.200]  psychology than back to calls but great points the same thing happened in
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.840]  Soviet Russia Nazi Germany it's happened over and over again the globalists are
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.800]  in control because they understand how people work they understand psychology
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:25.840]  human behavior people have bought into so many lies so much humiliation so much
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.200]  oppression so much tyranny that we have the biggest population of prisoners in
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.920]  the world we are rapidly becoming one of the most tyrannical nations in the
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:37.680]  world by every university study that's out there we're listed as number six in
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.120]  the world worst police state we have a government violating our rights spying
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:47.600]  on us in mass and people have decided this is okay because they don't want to
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.800]  be scared they just want to say it's okay they lied to themselves and so now
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:58.320]  that it's getting more obscene more bizarre more 1984 more Kafka asked more
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:05.000]  absurdist they have to buy into it by denying it and then as it's proven to
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.080]  them they'll say oh I guess that's okay see so so this is how they operate but
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.920]  just ignore them move on their slaves they want to be slaves sorry for them
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.080]  they'll wake up later don't worry just plant the seeds Josh and Georgia Josh
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:23.720]  you're on the air hey Alex how you doing good I just wanted to let you know
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:29.440]  this this might sound a little odd but just last night I've never had a vision
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:37.160]  before but I was watching the stars and it just hit me all of a sudden that and
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.920]  I and I voice this to my girlfriend who was with me I said I just had a vision
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:48.360]  and I feel like there's going to be a terrorist attack and they're gonna stage
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:54.680]  it on the conservatives it's gonna be another Oklahoma City and then I turned
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:16:00.040]  on your show today and you were talking about it oh you didn't hear me talking
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:06.040]  about it yesterday Josh no sir well you know scientific studies literally
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:10.840]  thousands of them have shown that they can have somebody in a room and somebody
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:16.640]  in another room a mile away watching them on CCTV camera and almost everyone
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:22.280]  statistically can tell when someone's watching them even over the CCTV camera
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:27.080]  as soon as they're not watching them the cameras on the TV's on but somebody a
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.600]  mile away or sometimes even further away you can tell when somebody's looking at
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:37.240]  you and you know we've got six senses or five we know about but there is
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:42.440]  something to that and I appreciate your call I really appreciated Josh but let's
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:47.040]  go ahead and talk to Charlie in Hawaii Charlie you're on the air hi Alex this
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:52.320]  is Charlie from Maui hey buddy first-time caller a long-time listener I've got a
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.440]  few ideas on that the naked body scanners first of all I think it's our
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:01.600]  demeanor the people that listen to your show when we go in there we need to be
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.840]  proud we need to stand proud and we need to say I respectfully opt out and we
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.840]  need to say it so that you know everybody around us here is it it's not
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:15.520]  them yelling you know we got an opt out here we have to be proud to opt out well
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:20.440]  well more than that and it is important to be calm but authoritative and say I'm
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:24.000]  not going to go through that the New York Times reports it can and will give
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.200]  you cancer the US government's own and I've quoted the agencies admits this is
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:34.640]  very dangerous it's very bad for you officers to be standing around these all
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:39.960]  day and then when they start trying to the pat down say look I know and
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:44.320]  everybody needs to know that they are ordered to do these pat downs to
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:49.320]  intimidate us Atlantic Monthly AP and others report that they admit this is to
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.720]  intimidate us into going through the naked body scanner and I would just want
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.880]  to add it's admitted that they're storing these images for biometric scans see
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.160]  they're already biometric scanners now what they admit is they want to add the
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.080]  software to them now with your name and your scan attached to put it in a
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:11.680]  database and apply the biometric digital overlay they already have the image
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:16.400]  it's like a digital photo at the DMV or a thumb print then they apply the
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.200]  software so they're already body scanners now admitted market watch that's
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:24.440]  Wall Street Journal division now reports this as I've been telling you for two
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:28.920]  years naked body scanners to store biometrics see I happen to know that
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:35.400]  the companies involved originally sold these 12 years ago and failed 10 12 years
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:38.000]  ago 10 years ago and then again five years ago they tried to push it they've
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.600]  had different waves for high-end cloth ears you go into that Brooks Brothers you
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:48.080]  go into that Prada store those are two that looked at doing it and you step
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.880]  into a scanner and then I went and researched it's a biometric scanner it's
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.800]  a 360 scan of your body it's a naked body scanner and then it supposedly gives
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:01.480]  you the ultimate tailoring then a factory with computers with you know
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:07.120]  robot sewing systems then makes your suit exactly tailored to you so I already
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.720]  knew these were biometric and now it's admitted so what do you think of them
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:16.920]  apples well the second idea I have is maybe you guys could put print out a
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:21.080]  sheet put out a sheet or something that we could pass out like three by five
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:25.800]  size cards that we could cut out of an eight and a half by 11 it gives the
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.840]  passengers around us you know they might think of us as terrorists if we did
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:35.120]  that but that explains to the other past oh yeah terrorist who terrorist who
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:38.480]  communicate to the First Amendment yeah I think it's fine once you get through
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:42.920]  the gate to just hand out business cards that have like 10 facts on them in a
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:47.360]  website on the back and say hey this is what's going on but the revolt is on
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:53.360]  beautiful idea anything else Charlie yeah the third idea is I saw a YouTube
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:58.520]  video about a guy who called Disney and said he could not bring his family to the

[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:02.600]  like no I don't want them touching the kids this goes back years ago and now
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:07.520]  there's no way and the globalists want that but that's the people at the top
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:12.680]  lower down people in industry and business and who are involved in in
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:16.760]  tourism they do not want it and that's how we're gonna beat this but if the
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:20.240]  globalists are ever able to shut the economy down then they won't have all
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:24.800]  these middle-class groups lobbying for freedom so how do you like tyranny

[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:57.400]  had communications all the way back to Rhode Island we knew what they were
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:02.080]  doing then I don't know how to convey it to you but now they dropped the Morse code
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:07.400]  requirements but to get your license and you could have and your listeners could
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:13.360]  have with a little bit of testing an amateur radio license you could have a

[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:34.480]  more to the ham radio systems as their emergency backup and if they ever shut
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:39.240]  the web down or pull some crisis it's gonna be the shortwave radios both

[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:31.120]  price I've seen thank you so much Ralph Ricky in Missouri you're on the air hey
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:37.840]  Alex I'm fired up welcome I wanted to tell you I had an experience actually
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.680]  first of all I want to tell you I was in the Navy been a veteran for six years and
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:49.120]  or I've been in the for the Navy for six years and we were doing exercises off
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:54.760]  the coast of California and the Kalina Islands so it's no surprise to me that
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:28:04.080]  the Navy has had some kind of hand in in all this fire missile tests we were
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:10.560]  actually doing like exercises about firing missiles off the coast of the
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:17.040]  Kalina Islands and we had I don't remember if we had submarines with us
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:23.520]  or not but it's just a kind of a coincidence that this grew up so big
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:28.320]  and I noticed the distinct coincidence to that I also wanted to talk about the
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:35.240]  TSA incidences and the horror stories right after I got out of the Navy which
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:41.880]  was in July of 06 another coincidence had happened I went to the wrong gate
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:48.960]  and the TSA had introduced me to a body scanner and I had no idea they first put
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:55.800]  them in in 2002 but only at six airports my horror story so they put me into the
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:00.080]  body scanner scanner first of all they want me down and then they put me to
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:03.440]  the body scanner and they say okay well now we're gonna pick you out and choose
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:12.680]  you to subject you for a body scan or for a back room check and so here
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:19.840]  I am a veteran in my uniform white second-class petty officer who has had
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.880]  the greatest experience the world what they do take your pants down hell yeah

[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:14.640]  nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:19.280]  pages you're a bug mr. Wordsworth a crawling insect an ugly
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:24.040]  misforned little creature who has no purpose here no meaning I am a human
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:31.400]  being words mr. Wordsworth that have no substance and no dimension like air like
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:38.120]  a wind I don't care I tell you I don't care I'm a human being I exist and if I
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:43.480]  speak one for a loud that thought lives even after I'm shoveled into my grave
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:51.280]  delusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you inject into your veins to make you
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:55.600]  think you have a strength when you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:06.960]  spindly limbs of a dream resistance to tyrants his obedience to God it's Alex
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:14.800]  Jones we are back live at ladies and gentlemen and I've got all these
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:23.400]  different news articles like the one in the Daily Mail the uninvited guest
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:28.720]  Chinese sub pops up in middle of US Navy exercise leaving military chiefs
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:35.560]  redface remember that November 2007 and we know that the Chinese military has
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.560]  been saber-rattling against the United States because the United States is
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:43.240]  run by the offshore bankers who sold all the fake derivatives and the fake
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:47.960]  mortgage stocks to them I'm not saying the Communist Chinese are good the point
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:52.520]  is is that they own over a trillion dollars of T bills their ministers have
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:58.120]  have delisted the US bond rating they've lowered it twice in the last year
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:06.840]  once this week all of this is happening but I do respect Wayne Madsen who of
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:14.640]  course worked in the Navy worked for RCA the National Security Agency Naval
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:20.880]  Data Automation Command of course he's written for some of the biggest national
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:24.920]  publications out there and just so much of what he's covered here just turns out
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:28.520]  in hindsight later come out of me know he comes on first and says it's an
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:34.960]  Israeli company spying on citizens in Pennsylvania and the director's gonna
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:39.040]  have to step down and then it came out three days later mainstream news that
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.920]  was true I mean it's just so many things people like all Madsen's making that up
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:47.280]  no I don't think he is and I know that when I watch C-span is he national
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:51.120]  security hearings or when I watched the press club on C-span I always see Madsen
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:56.280]  in the crowd always there you know with all these sources his ear to the ground
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.800]  now we've had a lot of people ask us the last four days what happened with this
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:05.120]  missile or last three days and I've said I don't know I know that on record
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:08.360]  there have been a lot of former Pentagon brass including members of the Joint
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:12.560]  Chiefs of Staff retired NASA people have come out and said yeah that's some type
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:18.480]  of sea launched either submarine or ship launched serious missile perhaps even
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:25.600]  intercontinental ballistic or at least a medium range and Wayne Madsen of course
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:34.280]  has the report China fired missiles seen in southern California I'm gonna get
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:39.360]  back to Ricky and and others to tell their TSA stories coming up but I want
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:43.560]  to go to Wayne Madsen right now dealing with this we appreciate him coming on on
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:50.920]  short notice of the Wayne Madsen report calm so Wayne what's your intel on this
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:37:00.480]  from your government sources okay very aggressive recently in about China and
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:05.160]  yellow stays we know about the incidence between the Japanese the Chinese the
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:11.080]  Japanese are keeping a very close eye on the Chinese Navy the Chinese have an
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:16.200]  under underground submarine base on the south coast of high non-Island people
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:21.520]  might recall high non-Island from two previous incidents and 2001 when the
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:29.120]  Navy spy plane was forced to look at on Wayne Wayne we're having cell phone
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:33.800]  problems with you we're gonna disconnect and call you back okay okay are you on
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:40.160]  are you on hands-free I'm not on a hands-free no okay wait a minute your
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:44.120]  phone just came back the first part the first of what you said got cut off I
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:48.080]  believe you said the Chinese Navy has been very aggressive lately your phones
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:52.880]  now better recap what you just said well the Chinese Navy we people might
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:59.240]  recall two incidents off off the high non-Island which is whether an
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:04.720]  underground Chinese submarine base is located these submarines leave underwater
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:09.840]  undetected and go back under their under underground base undetected they're
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:15.160]  not forced to surface so we had in 2001 the Navy spy plane and had the
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:21.000]  altercation with the Chinese MiG the US Navy EP3 Aries was forced to land on
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:27.040]  high non-Island in fact going back nine years didn't they even ram it well yeah
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:33.800]  they hit it they hit it with a with a MiG and then just last year we had what's
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:40.480]  called a surface tow-to-ray surveillance system ship US Navy ship called the
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:46.040]  impeccable was harassed off of high non-Island this is a ship that detects
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:50.760]  some briefs specifically in that area and by the way I would add you were a
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:56.200]  Navy man first yourself well I worked I worked in the sound surveillance system
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:02.160]  for over seven years and but when the Pacific I was a anti-submarine warfare
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:09.000]  officer and a certified integrated undersea surveillance so so a a you
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.520]  didn't just work for the NSA you worked in anti-submarine warfare for the Navy
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:19.320]  in some of the most secret areas B you now have these sources in Washington so
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.880]  you're a very credible source to be able to speak on this please continue what
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:28.480]  we did with those systems I have to say people will say we have the capability
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:34.520]  now to track submarines well we curtail that capability we used to have a
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:41.480]  vast array of under undersea acoustic hydrophones we only have two bases left
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:45.840]  one it would be island in Washington state the other at Damneck, Virginia and
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:50.160]  only five of these search ships one of which I mentioned was harassed by the
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:55.960]  Chinese Navy all high non-Island last year five ships to cover the entire
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:00.400]  warfare so this is going back to the Cold War but now our country doesn't have
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.000]  the submarines or the ships that they did there was constant harassment and
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:12.640]  tag and and and and and subs shadowing carriers our Navy seals going in from
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:16.880]  subs cutting undersea cables I mean this has been a long-term Cold War correct
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:21.360]  Oh absolutely and I remember once when I was stationed at the Soviet base in
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:27.280]  Coos Bay, Oregon we actually had a Soviet Victor 3 nuclear submarine surface off
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:33.440]  the coast 30 miles off the coast about the same area where it's figured that
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:37.300]  this Chinese submarine may have launched this missile that was that actually
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:43.200]  headed northwest and probably impacted in China just as a test and also a
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:47.040]  message to the United States if you're going to play in our waters in the
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.520]  LSE in South China Sea guess what we can do the same thing I also understand
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:57.480]  that the National Security Agency may have intercepted telemetry from that
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:02.200]  that Chinese missile so they know the Pentagon knows the Chinese have no
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:06.080]  vested interest in having the public know all that matters to them is that
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:10.560]  Obama know right before he met president who in Seoul and he's going to meet him
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:15.040]  again in Tokyo at the APEC conference and and that's that's the only people to
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:20.680]  know they're happy with that situation and I believe that like with the
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:25.440]  incidents we had between Soviet and American submarines during the Cold War
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.400]  Obama probably talked to the Chinese president said okay you proved your point
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:34.680]  let's not exacerbate these tensions let's keep the quiet and then it took a
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:38.640]  day and a half for the Pentagon to start trotting out these newly minted
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:43.240]  experts including from the Discovery Channel of all places people that claim
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:49.840]  oh it was a it was an airplane it was a US Airways flight from Honolulu Honolulu
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:55.120]  the plane we've posted the videos the last three days of former generals and
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:59.920]  experts in this saying it was a missile so I guess those were people that they
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:08.480]  couldn't control right editor of James missile publication in London stated
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:12.600]  that it as far as he was concerned it looked like a submarine launch ballistic
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:16.960]  missile now when I was in the movie we had a lot of intelligence sources but
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:21.920]  you know what we used as far our major reference James is the global premier
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:26.280]  encyclopedia for all things weapons absolutely when there was a question
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:31.320]  asked we we would opt for James over even our own Navy intelligence we figured
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:34.800]  Jones was right and some of our intelligence may not have been correct
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:40.560]  so so with all that and of course now we have all these so-called experts coming
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:46.080]  out of woodwork claiming oh no it was a contrail from a from a commercial
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:52.880]  airplane running when it looked at that nose that with the with the the plume
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:58.600]  very few contrails look like that that that was actually you saw you saw the
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:03.960]  Boatburg Trail because that submarine was fired from underwater so there was
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:08.240]  not it was not on the surface and we've seen it just take a look at some of the
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:12.720]  Polaris missile shots and look at the similarities now we're told oh there's
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:17.080]  similar contrails off of JFK in New York and off of Florida well every
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:21.440]  Photoshop wonderful because if you look at those those contrails it looks like
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.880]  they took the contrails from off of California and superimposed it on
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:29.960]  pictures from some other well I mean I'm no missile expert but I've watched a
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:35.040]  lot of Polaris submarine launched and the plume is a lot bigger at the bottom
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:38.800]  and then it goes up and then off at an angle and that's what all the experts
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:43.880]  said at the time now there is a lot of Navy missile testing in the past right
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:48.680]  off the coast and a few weeks before they did tell the FAA that they would be
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:52.680]  doing some drills what's your intel in Washington telling you I mean are you
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:57.080]  getting other it other intel this was the Chinese right what you're talking
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:04.240]  about is no notice to it's called a notice to airmen and no Tam they release
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:09.880]  those periodically to say look it is known that the Navy or the Air Force is
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:14.960]  conducting or NASA conducting missile tests in these areas off Wallops Island
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:20.960]  off of Virginia off Point Magoo and in California in Southern California that's
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:25.720]  just standard procedure it's not saying that word because the Navy and Air Force
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:29.560]  said that it was not any of their missile tests they came right out in the
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:34.480]  beginning and said that the FAA said that was not a plane that had taken off
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:39.520]  from LAX or any other airport in the area so it took it of course it took the
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:44.800]  Pentagon like I say a day and a half but I remember that I see a lot of
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:49.880]  skepticism now from some of the Pentagon correspondents for the major networks
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:55.400]  like Jim Nikolshevsky with NBC I don't think he was buying it the other day
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:45:00.880]  when he reported that the Navy said well with an airplane but they really have
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:05.760]  no okay when let's look let's look at the geopolitical ramifications you have
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:09.960]  the Chinese military in the last three months saying they're openly getting on
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:14.720]  a war footing and are very quote angry at the Pentagon you have the head of the
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:21.880]  Chinese Central Bank coming out and downgrading US treasuries you have the
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:26.560]  Chinese government saying it's horrible what they're doing devaluing the dollar
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:31.800]  you've got the Brazilian head of the finance minister the German finance
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:36.360]  minister the French finance minister I mean just it's countless it's literally
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:42.640]  scores of articles every day official press releases Obama is being excoriated
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:48.400]  at the G20 meanwhile he's doing press conferences saying we're helping the
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:56.600]  world everyone's happy totally lying just ball faced in front of everyone the
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:01.120]  Federal Reserve is accelerating this currency war Herman von Roompi has
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:05.760]  announced at the G20 nation states are dead EU chief says the belief that
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:10.320]  countries can stand alone as a lion and illusion so these offshore banks have
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:14.440]  engineered this fiat system they've used the US as one of their main bases and
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:19.200]  now globally the US is being blamed for the private IMF and World Bank and what
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:22.640]  the six big banks have done I mean we're really being scapegoated and if
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:27.160]  you're right as a lot of other military sources are saying that this was some
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:31.360]  type of missiles similar to North Korea routinely firing missiles over Japan
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:36.520]  publicly to menace them this is an incredible escalation it's similar to
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:42.080]  Dick Cheney during the Olympics on 888 and George W. Bush launching the attack
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:46.520]  on South Ossetia and Abkhazia now confirmed saying that Russia had done
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:50.960]  it and launching it while they're meeting with Putin so I guess this is
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:54.640]  something we know that now happen so it's like a threatening brinksmanship of
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:58.640]  you want World War three pal I mean is that what you're saying the Chinese have
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:03.280]  done I think primarily China wanted to send a message to us look you keep
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:08.400]  playing in the South China Sea and Hillary was rattling some sabers about
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:12.840]  the the islands of China claims down there the Paris Bell and the Spratly
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:16.720]  other fighting with the Japanese over that and I'm not up in the up in the
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:20.280]  yellow thing there's fighting over some islands there with Russia I think
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:26.320]  primarily this is a this is a this is a Chinese military telling the Chinese
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:30.960]  government what you better take a stand here because we're if the US
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.520]  things that can play in our waters we have to demonstrate to them that we can
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:39.040]  play in theirs and let me just back up what you're saying the Russians day to
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:45.200]  rolled mobile nuke launchers into South Ossetia and Abkhazia and the head of
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:48.240]  their joint chiefs of staff went on television pulled it up on YouTube and
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:52.240]  said we're preparing for nuclear war with NATO in the United States they've
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:57.440]  launched this attack and then suddenly all those C-130s landing with US troops
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:03.840]  and mercenaries pulled out and now we've got US and other ships all around
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:09.040]  China doing these drills with Japan and South Korea and and so I guess China's
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:12.560]  saying two can play at that game because we know our government's been doing
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:16.720]  missile test off the coast of China so I guess this is just turn about as fair
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:21.800]  play oh absolutely and I think that primarily this was a military response
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:26.280]  by the Chinese but I think what you said about the economic situation this was
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:32.480]  a perfect storm to make a demonstration like that so I think there's a lot of
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:39.040]  things that played into this decision so the Chinese dispatches in class nuclear
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:44.400]  ballistic missile nuclear submarine they may have one or two of those and frankly
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:49.160]  we also know that the previous submarines that they had of the same
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:53.840]  type ballistic missile submarines were very noisy but the Chinese being such a
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:57.920]  high-tech power they know how to quiet these down just like this the Soviets
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:02.960]  and the Russians were able to quiet their submarines well reportedly though
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:06.380]  Lane and I mean you were a submariner and it and it's money worked on all this
[01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:10.600]  sonar and surveillance but just from my research and James and other places the
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:14.480]  Chinese don't care they'll run into channels with a bunch of traffic and
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:18.800]  routinely pop up right behind with their diesels they just don't care yeah
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:21.840]  well they had a diesel electric as you mentioned the pops up right in the
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:25.880]  middle of that US Navy task group about the same time the distance that it
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:29.920]  takes place that it was the USS Kitty Hawk and the whole purpose of those
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:34.960]  task force the other ships are supposed to protect the aircraft carrier so
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.760]  obviously we have a problem with our anti-submarine warfare detection
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:43.640]  capabilities and also remember room stealth pet project the ballistic missile
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:48.840]  defense system Star Wars 2 they sunk billions into that and this also shows
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:53.000]  well that money was wasted so what the Pentagon is trying to do if I cover this
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.440]  up covering us up is to protect a lot of heads from rolling and you know one
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:01.680]  thing I know about the Navy when they screw up they're very good at one thing
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:04.720]  they're very good at covering up I don't think they were very good here because
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:09.240]  it took them a day and a half to start finding the newly minted experts what
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:13.520]  are the other Navy people saying you're talking to on Capitol Hill well I've
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:18.280]  got some Navy sources are telling me I absolutely it was it it was a test firing
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:24.000]  in the Chinese submarine launch ballistic missile the Japanese intelligence are
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.800]  on to that too they've been keeping a close eye on what's happening in high
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:31.840]  none with the Chinese submarines that's their conclusion and I think we're
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.040]  going to see more people coming out I think we're going to see leaks start
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:40.800]  starting to filter out of the Pentagon very shortly because there's people who
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:45.800]  want to fix this problem not engage in a cover-up absolutely because you know
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:51.360]  you've got the art our movie ships out there are vulnerable to these Chinese
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:55.400]  submarines and obviously we have a problem in our detection capabilities
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.480]  Wayne stay there I want to come back in the short segment find out what else is
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:03.560]  on your radar a political import hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the

[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:14.920]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about performing in
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:18.160]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen

[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:08.280]  New Mexico January of 2000 I had a heart attack then my real
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:12.640]  health began going downhill and I had high blood pressure high blood sugar
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:17.000]  poor vision and I really wasn't sleeping well I was a mess pretty much Don
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.360]  reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract I started taking
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:25.040]  heart and body extract and within a few days I started sleeping a lot better my
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:29.600]  blood pressure normalized my blood sugar normalized and my sleep really did

[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:09.280]  heart and body extract I'll say this in closing on the submarine missile story
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:13.840]  and Wayne's probably right I certainly believe he believes what he's saying all
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:19.360]  the evidence points towards it this is a very bold move and shows them way out
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:23.720]  of their hemisphere but they see it as their territory because they're on the
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:30.040]  Pacific and it fits with the rest of China's military posturing and remember
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:34.920]  this is who owns most of our debt. Wayne Madsen what else is on your radar at
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:40.160]  WayneMadsenreport.com? Well keeping the story in Asia we know that President
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:45.400]  Obama postponed two trips to Indonesia where he spent some time when he was a
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:53.680]  young boy being raised by Lolo Satoro, stepfather, and Donovan's mom. Now he
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:55:01.520]  has a report that came out that his nanny who raised them in Jakarta was a nanny
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:07.440]  by their but apparently a transvestite member of a dance troupe called the
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:14.080]  Fantastic Dolls at night his boyfriend was a local butcher in Jakarta I think
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:18.200]  we're gonna hear more of this we I think and this is the reason why Obama
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:22.880]  really didn't want to go to Jakarta because the Indonesian press is pretty
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:26.280]  good at this but this story was picked up by both the Washington Post and New
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:31.440]  York Times and neither of which have really gotten into the Obama background
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.920]  at all that of him and his family I think we're now gonna see the gloves off
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:40.600]  we're gonna see more expo days. Yeah they're getting ready to dump all of
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:46.320]  their sins on their puppet Obama and sink him and we're now and we're now
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:50.040]  seeing former Federal Reserve Chief Greenspan and others talk about
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:54.280]  criminality in the banking system we're now starting to see Glenn Beck claiming
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:59.560]  George Soros runs everything he's behind the New World Order they know they
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:02.880]  can't deny this anymore so they're getting ready to flush a few of their
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:08.120]  puppets down the toilet. Well I think so we know that after the election there's
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:13.040]  some key Democrats they're out that basically they're saying look
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:17.440]  Obama you can't run again you've you've heard the party severely a lot of big
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:22.960]  time long-serving Democrats went down the tubes people like Rick Boucher from
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:30.080]  Virginia, Overstar from Minnesota, we had Ike Skelton. They don't want Pelosi in there so
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:34.520]  so this is the message from the big liberal media hey we'll talk about the
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:38.320]  freak shows the trannies the drugs and it was all over the news this week that
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:43.360]  his name is Barry Sataro suddenly that's all overseeing in I mean they're right
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:48.120]  and that he was enrolled in that school in Jakarta as a Muslim and that his
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:53.080]  mother didn't want him to pray but he demanded it right right so we're gonna
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:58.720]  get more of this the word I'm getting is that there's teams of people who might
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:05.560]  be working for those who want to try to get Obama dumped off the ticket in 2012
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:11.920]  there's teams running around Indonesia, Kenya and other places Pakistan and we're
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:17.200]  gonna probably see a lot more expo days with Obama's background. Is
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:20.640]  her name Hillary and Bill Clinton because we know she left town for the
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:24.840]  election? Don't count them out I understand that they're working over time on
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:31.360]  collecting this data also yes absolutely. So it's a lot of different people not so
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:36.080]  much the neocons then that are because he admits the cocaine the heroin came
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:40.760]  out this week and everything we've heard continues to get confirmed the
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:45.760]  Barry Sataro the Tranny now I guess the Larry Sinclair I mean it's just all
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:50.920]  gonna come out. And wait till the second Blagojevich trial in Chicago we're gonna
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:57.080]  hear a lot more about Obama and a guy named Tony Rezko. So they're getting
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:02.240]  ready to flush their puppet? Yeah I think what we're gonna see is Obama like an
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:10.040]  LPJ saying I you know that the duties of officers are so great I will not I will
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:15.240]  not serve nor will I allow my name to be put in nomination for another term as
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:22.160]  your president just like LPJ did in March of 68. Wayne Madsen briefly what's
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:24.960]  your take on Glenn Beck coming out and saying the government may blow up a
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:33.880]  building? Well the waters warm Glenn I'm happy you're finally seeing the light here on both
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:46.480]  that and on George Soros. All right thank you so much Wayne Madsen. This is GCN the
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:55.000]  Genesis Communications Radio Network. Hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to

[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:13.320]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:21.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:27.720]  Jones. Well a lot of weeks he spends an hour with us for even two hours. Today
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:30.960]  we've just got him for 30 minutes and I really appreciate Bob Chapman of the
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:35.600]  International Forecaster.com joining us every Friday. We've got Michael
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:41.680]  Breverman, one of the producers of the hit TV show Conspiracy Theory. What they
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:44.920]  think is the most important episode of this season and I agree with them. FEMA
[02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:48.960]  Camps confirmed the police state episode tonight. He's gonna be on with us in the
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:53.680]  last 20 minutes or so. So Bob will probably with us 35-40 minutes. But going
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:58.440]  to Bob Chapman, we haven't gotten into all the economic news. It's all happening.
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:04.240]  The dollar devaluation, the Chinese are angry. Madsen thinks it was the Chinese
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:07.600]  threatening us with a missile test similar to what North Korea does with
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:13.080]  Japan. We've got the revolt against the TSA pat downs and body scans. So much is
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:17.400]  happening. Bob Chapman, what is first and foremost on your radar screen right
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:23.920]  now? Well it's the G20 meeting and they're not having any success whatsoever
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:31.720]  as far as I know and that will probably continue. I think in part you have to look
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:38.840]  at the positions of the other countries who have really been cheating for years
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:44.440]  and years and they want to continue to do so. But now that the dollar's gone down,
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:49.840]  they want the cake and eat it too. They want the dollar to remain, we'll call it
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:54.640]  firm and it's not happening. And they're still devaluing their currencies
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:58.880]  against one another and that's what the currency was all about. And what it's
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:05.000]  going to lead to if they continue to do what they're doing is a trade war. And
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.680]  quite frankly, that would be to the advantage of the United States in as
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:19.560]  much as 432,000 companies and 8.5 million jobs with tariffs on goods and
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:24.560]  services just might decide to come home. And that would certainly help the
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:29.720]  American economy. So there's a little glimmer of light in there and as you
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:34.600]  know, Paul Craig Roberts agrees with me on that and not very many other people
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:40.840]  do. As far as the meeting's concerned, they're just getting nowhere. The dollar's
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:45.560]  been firm but that's because the U.S. government is in the market driving it
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:51.120]  up and they're in the market knocking gold and silver down and that's okay. We
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:54.540]  would have had a correction anyway and the correction and all likelihood is
[02:02:54.540 --> 02:03:00.320]  probably over. We've had two dips here in the last four or five days and what
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:05.280]  they do when they do that is it's called filling a gap and the gaps have been
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:11.440]  filled. So next week they have silver and gold have every reason to move back
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:18.680]  up again and they're going much higher. This is a temporary intercession into
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:24.160]  the market. So it's the beach ball. It's the beach ball effect. Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:29.200]  And they're doing it because they want the dollar strong and gold and silver
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:36.440]  week during the process of this meeting, which is yesterday and today. And also the
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:41.480]  bleating and complaining about other foreign governments. I had a piece in
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:48.800]  out of Mexico City. It'll be in tomorrow's issue. They're thinking of lowering
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:55.080]  interest rates to take pressure off of a strong peso. It's been trading as low
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:04:01.800]  as 1220 and to the dollar and they don't like that. They'd rather have it up to
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:08.720]  13 or 14 and that's not what's happening. So they are just atypical trying to
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:14.240]  protect their exports and this whole thing is either got to stop or they're
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:20.800]  going to have trade barriers and they're going to have trade barriers. Bob,
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:25.600]  we're going to come back from break. I want to continue looking at the economy.
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:32.240]  They tried to say a month ago that we left a recession in June of 2009. Now
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:36.360]  even mainstream media says, okay, we never left the recession. We may be going
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:42.640]  into a depression. I want to go through some of the economic data and the things
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:47.560]  that are happening on the world political scale with you. I want to get into
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:52.200]  Herman von Rumpies. Disgusting. That's the EU head folks. Statement yesterday
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:56.400]  that nation states are dead. That's the goal of all of this. Straight ahead with
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:05:01.800]  Bob Chapman. I'm Alex Jones. This is the GCN Radio Network, GCNLive.com.
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:06.720]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:11.280]  is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:15.240]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:20.280]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:25.560]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:30.080]  attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:34.800]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:38.800]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists. They're
[02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:42.480]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to?
[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:47.560]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:54.600]  a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com

[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:04.720]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:08.960]  generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:13.120]  your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:17.200]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:21.560]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number
[02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:25.600]  three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:30.200]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:34.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:38.080]  families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:42.120]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:44.840]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:48.280]  Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at

[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:04.280]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you a
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:07.840]  bit about soap, not detergents but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:12.160]  Calvin Soap Company, a family owned and operated American company. My family,
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:16.320]  staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:19.920]  these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes. There is nothing like these

[02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:41.520]  see what he has to say. As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me,
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:47.760]  how's business? I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain. Call us

[02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:09.880]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:16.080]  Well, here's the Boston Herald. Obama's economic view is rejected on the world
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:22.400]  stage. Meanwhile, Obama claims strengthened hand in global dealings.
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:28.560]  That's AP. He says everything's wonderful. Continuing, G20 refuses to back U.S.
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:34.280]  push on China currency. The leaders of the 20 major economies on Friday refused
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:38.400]  to back U.S. push to make China boost its currency value. See, they get to lower
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:42.880]  theirs and unfairly ship all our jobs there because it's cheaper to manufacture.
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:46.680]  So what's happening is all these other countries, as Bob Chapman just said, want
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:50.720]  us to continue to slit our throats for what Herman von Rupy calls his global
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:55.800]  government. He says nation states are dead and that we must basically sacrifice
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:59.600]  everything on the altar of globalism. He said EU chief says the belief that
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:05.000]  countries can stand alone as a lie and an illusion so they get us held captive to
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.040]  their fiat money system and then always say give us more power and we'll make the
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:12.000]  depression stop and you give them more power and things only get worse.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:17.320]  Bloomberg, Sarkozy takes over G20 aiming to update monetary system. They want to
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:21.520]  move towards this global SDR that we all pay taxes to. That's making the
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:26.640]  swindling bankers world rulers openly. We'll get Bob Chapman's take on that.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:31.760]  IMF shadow looms as Irish take pay cuts to avoid bailout. Their cost of borrowing
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:39.080]  going way up. It just goes on and on and on and here in the U.S. they're
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:43.000]  slashing all the main services. England's dimming their lines. Pay to protect.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.840]  Sheriff cutting services to city over late payment. All over they're slashing
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:50.640]  police sheriffs but the taxes go up and up. More and more the money going to debt
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:54.840]  service. That's the mark of a third world nation. The peso rises against the
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:10:02.880]  dollar. This is amazing. Let's go to Bob Chapman on this front. What do you see
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:07.160]  coming out of this? Are they going to get their SDR and if not then how do you
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:14.560]  see this playing out? They're not going to get an SDR because I think that they're
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:19.560]  going to have to back something that they create whether it's a rebirth of the
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:26.600]  dollar or an index or a bank or which most people haven't heard of but
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:32.240]  something that was dreamed up by Mr. Keane's back in the 30s. The SDR cannot
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:39.560]  be backed by gold. It's part of the IMF arrangement although that could change.
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:46.000]  And you know the easiest way out for these people but they'll have to give up
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:52.120]  their current push for world government is have a big meeting. All the
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:58.040]  countries are there. Devalue, revalue, default. And then they can decide whether
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:04.800]  they're going to have an indexed and the Zolder said the other day he's a
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:10.720]  Bilderberger trial at CFR person and very very important mind you although most
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:17.040]  of you haven't heard of him. He said that we should consider an international
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:22.160]  unit of some kind with gold backing and then he retracted it a couple of days
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:27.320]  later but the trial balloon went up and that's what that was. Well so did Zolik.
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:31.880]  So did Zolik, the head of the World Bank which is the U.S. Arm also was talking
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:36.440]  about this three days ago and then retracted. That's a gentleman I was
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:39.640]  talking about. I guess you pronounce it a bit different than I would. I might have
[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:42.800]  given them the wrong name for it. No it's okay there's so many of these creatures
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.300]  but but you know when you talk about the bandcore the IMF three months ago put
[02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:52.520]  out a paper and said we want a bandcore so so they're actually proposing it.
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:58.120]  That that's right but they've got to back up with gold. Now we don't know whether
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:02.760]  the United States has any gold or not. There is gold in Fort Knox and out of
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:07.560]  the Fed Building in New York and at West Point and I know we have subscribers
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:13.280]  who are in the military who are now retired who counted it. So we know
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:18.400]  something's there but we don't know who it belongs to but if the U.S. has their
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:24.760]  gold or a good part of it left and squandered everybody else's then all I
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:32.080]  have to do is back the dollar with gold. Now before they do that they must
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:38.720]  devalue and default along with others and the reason why is if they just
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:44.520]  revert and say okay tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock we're gonna go back to a gold
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:50.600]  standard and what would happen is the Chinese to say hey that's terrific
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:56.200]  here's a trillion dollars we want a trillion dollars worth of gold so that's
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:00.080]  not going to work very well unless they devalue and default along with the
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:04.880]  others first. So the easy way out is to have the meeting. They can try to do a
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:10.160]  bandcore and it could conceivably work for them but it's got to be
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:15.800]  gold backed. And that's why more and more they're floating that. I want to shift
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:20.360]  gears now and play a video clip because I talked about this yesterday but the
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:26.960]  magnitude of this is so huge we had Warren Glenn back on air and we know he
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:31.920]  listens as people listen every day. About half his show is exactly what's
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:35.400]  covered here and then he puts a neocon spin on it but less and less. Again I
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:38.680]  don't trust him but he's going in the right direction like Wayne Madsen said
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:43.040]  you know hey the water's warm come on in but the bigger question is why would
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:47.640]  Fox News allow him to do this? Well I'll tell you one big reason and I'm gonna
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:52.520]  get into what he's done here in a moment. George Soros in the last six or
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:58.600]  seven years has spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying and running
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:05.360]  campaigns to shut down Fox and news corps advertisers. They've cost him tens of
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:09.600]  millions just in the last two years year and a half that he's been at Fox. They've
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:16.120]  taken hundreds of sponsors and so Rupert Murdoch's a high-level globalist
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:20.760]  but not in the capstone. He's angry at that and it really is Soros that started
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:26.640]  it. Soros is a horrible creature you've talked years ago about him helping
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:30.440]  sell out Jews in World War II. Beck talked about that two days ago that's
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:34.720]  really got Soros publications like Media Matters really mad right now but
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:37.200]  they're not just attacking Beck in these articles it's always Beck and then
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:43.600]  Alex Jones you know his evil media junior and they're saying we're gonna
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:47.760]  cause an Oklahoma City or we're gonna be behind it and we put the warning out in
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:53.240]  June in July Obama faces growing credibility crisis where Robert
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:57.000]  Shapiro advising Obama said without an Oklahoma City or 9-11 you're not
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.040]  gonna be able to pose as our savior. The bottom line here is that Americans
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:04.080]  don't believe in President Obama's leadership quote. He has to find some
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:06.800]  way between now November demonstrating that he's a leader who can command
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:10.080]  confidence and short of a noon 9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing I
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:15.400]  can't think of how I could do that. Now ex-Clinton strategist Obama needs events
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:21.680]  similar to OKC to reconnect with voters that's another Obama and Clinton
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:26.760]  advisor Mark Penn said that on national TV so we wrote the article last Sunday
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:30.640]  Clinton night Obama needs OKC bombing to reconnect with American people. Beck
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:33.720]  because we put it in the articles I showed where all these Soros publications
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:37.840]  are saying that Beck and I not just Beck he says oh they're gonna blame me no
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:42.880]  it's Alex too I'm in the crosshairs folks that's why I talk about this to
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:47.920]  stage a new Oklahoma City. Now Beck came out and said that George Soros I won't
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:51.680]  even go this far because he's a mid-level minion you know the shadow we
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:55.080]  corporate interest and the Mic report they are gearing up to go after the
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:59.520]  Patriot movement and we've been saying that for actually two years now but we've
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:03.200]  been intensifying our warning but Beck came out and we're gonna skip the break
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:05.600]  here the network break coming up in a moment because I want to give Bob plenty
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:08.520]  of times we're cutting him short today and I apologize for that but don't worry
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:14.240]  he'll get two hours next week if he wants it sometimes he can't do it. How
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:19.320]  big a deal is it to have Glenn Beck come out and say twice in the same video
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:23.800]  clip they're going to blame me they're getting ready to stage a new Oklahoma
[02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:28.320]  City. I mean this is bold and for him to be green-lighted this shows a fight
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:33.600]  within the globalist I believe so you know Fox News is globalist but but how
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:38.520]  big of a deal is it to have Beck admit false flag terror in America to be
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:42.960]  blamed on the American people this is huge Bob. It's giant there's no question
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:47.520]  about it and you know he's going down the avenue that we discussed over and
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:52.000]  over again after over the last year or so and he's really stealing what you're
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:57.080]  doing but you know if it's in the right direction as Madsen said the waters
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:17:05.680]  warm come on in. They are challenging them. There is a breakup probably
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:10.520]  temporary between these people and they've gone on the attack on Fox's
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:14.480]  absolutely no doubt about it and I don't know if you noticed you probably did
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:21.320]  that the ADL is now after Glenn Beck because he's a racist because of what
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:25.480]  he had to say about Mr. Soros. Yeah so they're pulling out they're pulling out
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:30.200]  the big guns now I mean they're desperate. That's right and they're hurting
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:35.920]  the truth kills I mean it's it's awful and that's why we're here to tell the
[02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:44.160]  truth and Soros' background what Beck should do is what we have done is point
[02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:49.400]  out that the man has been convicted twice of breaking the law. Yeah Beck never
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:56.160]  does that that I've seen this guy's a convict. Yes that's true and he even
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:01.440]  lost an appeal in France and now he's gone to one of these international
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:06.200]  organizations whose name I can't remember to tell them that you have to
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:12.720]  exonerate me because some obscure reason but he was after that he was
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:16.920]  convicted in Hungary as well as doing the same thing rigging the stock market
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:21.240]  in essence. And Beck is telling the truth to a certain degree when he says
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:27.760]  that George Soros is at the top of the pyramid but only over an enclave of
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:32.280]  socialist and communist because you know the big mega banks want to
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:35.320]  steal the middle-class wealth to give it to the bankers they always hire a crew
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:41.400]  of lazy ignorant you know intellectual lightweights you know to
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:47.160]  basically be their vanguard but but Soros on the power structure I don't
[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:50.360]  even consider him to be at the top of the you know pyramid where the Rothschilds
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:54.480]  Rockefellers, Queen of England, Dutch Royal Family are they promote all the
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:59.560]  same policies so there does seem to be somewhat of a throwing Soros under the
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:08.360]  bus here. Well certainly Fox and Glenn Beck are in that direction already and
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:14.360]  they're probably waiting to see what that you have to say and we just told
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:18.720]  people the truth about Mr. Soros and if the ADL doesn't like that well that's
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:24.920]  just too darn bad and maybe Mr. Beck didn't even know of that part of
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:29.440]  Mr. Soros' background. Yeah there's so much I mean how do you know at all it's
[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:35.880]  an endless file. Well in all of the financing that he did through his
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:40.280]  organizations throughout Europe particularly East in Europe causing those
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:46.480]  colored revolutions all of which have been thrown asunder all they did was
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:52.680]  bankrupt most of the countries that experienced those electoral revolutions
[02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:57.840]  will call them and this guy is bad news and he also wants to legalize marijuana
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:02.640]  and everybody has their own idea on that but it's something I should throw in
[02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:08.800]  because he's been a longtime advocate of that. Well his main reason for it is
[02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:12.440]  that's just some liberal cover he has and I don't listen to Howard Stern a lot
[02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:16.800]  but I scan around through XM and I was driving home last night they were
[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:21.360]  re-airing it because he's on I think XM 100 or is it Sirius 100 I guess I have
[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:26.280]  Sirius in my car the same same company but the point is Sirius and XM are
[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:30.840]  merged about three years ago but I listened to Stern for like 30 minutes
[02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:37.840]  talk about how he got Glenn Beck's books his materials he's studying it it was
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:40.320]  the first time I've ever heard Howard Stern I probably listened hundreds of
[02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:44.040]  times over the years because I've been on radio stations he's on like 98-9 back
[02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:48.000]  when it was talk he was on there in the morning and I was on at night I've never
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.600]  heard him actually get Sirius and he was talking about world government new world
[02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:56.360]  order who's at the top of the pyramid that it's scary and then he said well I
[02:20:56.360 --> 02:21:00.280]  did my own research like Beck said and the first thing I saw was that Soros has
[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:03.480]  given seven billion dollars a charity well that's like Bill and Melinda Gates
[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:07.560]  giving with Warren Buffett over a hundred billion they put it this is on
[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:13.080]  record in a tax-free foundation then none of their operations are taxable they
[02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:17.840]  keep most the money and give some of it for horrible programs and Soros calls
[02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:22.600]  philanthropy having media matters and all these other outfits demonizing the
[02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:26.360]  Second Amendment demonizing people that want sovereignty or to control our
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:30.480]  borders demonizing people who are against the Federal Reserve helping overthrow
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:34.840]  countries that's good and one thing Beck says is true we've talked about it for
[02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:39.440]  years Soros is on record always trying to kill the dollar he's on I've seen him
[02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:44.000]  on Lair News Hour a decade ago doing it Soros is on record going in and bragging
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:48.560]  he's been convicted of it for setting up currency implosions and making tens of
[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:53.720]  billions at a pop so I mean for the ADL and and all these other groups to say
[02:21:53.720 --> 02:22:00.920]  he's some little angel cake I mean he is a complete fraud and a joke Bob but I'm
[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:07.040]  I mean I'm ranting about this now it's just that look if we get Howard Stern
[02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:10.480]  he's probably got 10 million listeners overall to start attacking the New World
[02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:14.000]  Order the globalists are in a lot of trouble you know I mean because of all
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.240]  of the you know people that listen to Stern if they start hearing serious
[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:21.360]  information I mean my point is first Stern covered the naked body scanners in
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:25.120]  one of our news articles I forgot that part he read our headline and plug in
[02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:28.480]  four wars are present but I don't care he's obviously on drudge and then he
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:32.360]  went into 30 minutes about Glenn Beck and world government but the problem is
[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:36.560]  Soros is not the top of it so that's my problem with Beck is he's only telling
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:39.840]  people about one person in the strata Bob what's your take on what I just said
[02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:46.360]  and where do you see in the pyramid of power where do you see George Soros well
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:52.240]  first of all and he's not in the middle I think he's closer to the top I would
[02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:57.760]  say in the top 10% because he's a decision maker he's been given the
[02:22:57.760 --> 02:23:01.640]  opportunity to have billions and billions of dollars and he's instructed
[02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:05.280]  who he's supposed to do with it but he doesn't make those decisions himself
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:09.520]  they have committees that do that they're working 24-7 worldwide and these
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:14.520]  think tanks and even doing it for years and he's just a dummy when he dies all
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:19.560]  the money will go back to the alumnus and they'll continue and they'll use some
[02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:25.560]  of the stooge to do it in in the likes of kissing or let me just back you up it
[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:29.160]  came out in the church hearings and others if that's exactly what happens and
[02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:32.440]  that's what's happening with with Bill and Melinda Gates they had all those
[02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:36.360]  antitrust things slapped on them until they gave the money to eugenics please
[02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:43.480]  continue right so you know let's get a hold of Glenn and tell him look and now
[02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:47.600]  that you've started this and you're trying to work your way up the pyramid
[02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:52.600]  let us give you a little help these are the people who were doing it this is
[02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:56.520]  why they're doing it and I don't think your boss is gonna like it but if you
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:02.200]  run this stuff it'll be unbelievably good because others will pick it up like
[02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:07.320]  Howard Stern and maybe he'll do some more research and this is how these things
[02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:12.160]  work they feed on themselves you know a lot of the people out there who are
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:20.560]  opportunists and who don't really care sometimes have a change of heart and they
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:24.360]  start the care and say gee how do they have a little look this is dreadful
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:30.040]  let's do something about it absolutely I want to play this Glenn Beck clip since
[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:34.960]  we've been talking about it's about two minutes long here it is why does the left
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:39.480]  need this violence well listen to a clip from a Democratic pollster Mark Penn
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:44.480]  happened just the other day and yet no one pays attention to it how can the
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:51.680]  left win the country watch cabinets don't don't really sell things president
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:55.840]  himself has to reconnect with the people remember president Clinton reconnected
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:25:01.760]  through Oklahoma right and the president was removed and it wasn't until that
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:06.120]  speech that he re-clicked with the American public Obama needs a similar
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:13.520]  a similar big words of work for Obama needs a similar kind of event oh like
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:17.880]  Oklahoma City if only Barack Obama couldn't have the opportunity to speak
[02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:22.600]  to America after another Oklahoma City type event then he'll politically be
[02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:30.880]  in good shape Wow now according to Drummond Pike the founder of Tides who
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:36.320]  drum and I hope you watch this week because oh it's all coming undone this week I
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:41.320]  will be the guy who causes the next Oklahoma City this is in a letter an
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:47.960]  appeal to advertisers of Fox dear Fox advertisers read this part of it no one
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:52.920]  left right center wants to see another Oklahoma City the next assassin may
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:58.080]  succeed if so there will be blood on many hands they are setting up another
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:02.280]  Oklahoma City they are claiming that one is coming and they've already marked
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:08.760]  the one who caused it but don't you miss Wednesday show when I show you
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:14.320]  violence and the pressure from below it will boggle your mind so there you have
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:18.520]  it they he's talking about Soros are setting up an Oklahoma City and there's
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:24.800]  actually some truth to that we know from the FBI memos that people sued lawyer
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:28.240]  Jesse trying to do because they killed his brother and got him he got one
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:31.800]  declassified another they blacked him out but when he got the two copies of
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:35.480]  the same document different areas blacked out two different courts he had
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:40.440]  the whole document Southern Poverty Law Center key to all of this running
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:45.920]  Elohim City and McVay I mean so I mean in a way there is a connection there but
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:50.880]  they wouldn't have a green lighted an attack like that if the Pentagon and the
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:54.920]  FBI and others weren't gonna go along with it but notice it was another liberal
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:58.880]  administration who likes to blame domestics where Republicans like the
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:02.600]  boogeymen of Arabs and Muslims so they could have far an empire
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:06.720]  Democrats like to attack in the homeland because they have a serious hatred of
[02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:11.200]  liberty and the American people Bob Chapman I'll tell you something that's a
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:16.960]  brilliant take and I'm not shining you on that is just terrific and that's
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:22.440]  exactly what they do and that's what the CIA is all about in part as well and
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:31.640]  there's no question in any person who's done any investigation about who did
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:37.360]  Oklahoma City in 9-11 they were events and there's been a lot of others this
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:43.840]  recent thing that we've watched here and in the Gulf of Mexico with the oil it's
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:50.080]  the same thing and they keep on doing it and so obviously the Democrats are
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:55.040]  working on or at least the people in the White House are working on some kind of
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:59.800]  event to make everybody like the president so maybe he'll be good can be
[02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:05.000]  around and maybe the Democrats can gain some ground and people ask why would they
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:08.440]  people ask why would they brag out in the open because most people in the
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:12.320]  system aren't involved in it they've got to put the talking point out so all
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:17.000]  their people rush on TV when Obama's people blow up a federal building or a
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:21.720]  school and put the talking point out that Obama you know he saved you he
[02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:27.280]  stood up for you that's exactly right and that's the path that they follow and
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:32.160]  so we can expect they're gonna they're gonna try something where and when I
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:36.320]  certainly don't know and you don't but they're gonna try something because it
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:40.840]  just told us it's just like rating foreign affairs the House organ
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:44.680]  literally a literary organ of the council and foreign relations they tell
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:48.400]  you what they're gonna do right in there that's how we've known that's how
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:52.760]  you've known for 50 years fighting that's how I've known for 15 fighting they
[02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:55.720]  said how they get rid of the borders they talked about the global currency
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:59.680]  we'd come warn people get laughed at all we're doing is reading it's like they
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:04.960]  go on TV and say we need terror attacks to blame it on Glenn Beck I mean and
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:09.720]  then you read the actual reports that they they say yours truly Bob it's two
[02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:15.680]  people Glenn Beck and Alex Jones and this is this is dangerous well they
[02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:21.400]  they have to have the Stooges but it's not gonna stick because both of you
[02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:26.480]  generally speaking are very well accepted by the public and you know
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:32.040]  there's always people who don't agree and that's fine but they figure they can
[02:29:32.040 --> 02:29:36.600]  get away by doing that it's not gonna stick Bob I want to come back I want to
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:39.160]  come back and finish up with you for about three minutes on this and give
[02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:42.120]  folks the place where they can get the international forecaster.com a free
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:45.080]  copy so grab that number because Bob never even thinks to plug it's only

[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:07.960]  right now this is so exciting we've got Michael Braverman TV producer and
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:13.360]  researcher and one of the folks that appears in the hit TV show I'd call it
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:18.320]  a documentary now in its second season conspiracy theory this was the number one
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:21.520]  search term yesterday bombshell FEMA camps confirmed good job to the
[02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:29.800]  listeners Google tried to block our FEMA camp search term but other people
[02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:34.720]  wrote about our story so it it got out to everybody very very exciting good job
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:43.960]  on that front we are doing a another search term today dealing of course with
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:49.640]  the revolt against the TSA will put that up on screen if we can the search term
[02:34:49.640 --> 02:34:54.680]  I'm doing today but but I want to give them a double shot of resistance and
[02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:56.880]  we're about to finish up with Bob Chapman then go to Michael Braverman I
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:02.200]  want to make three words the term today FEMA camps confirmed FEMA camps
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:06.280]  confirmed put that into Google over and over and over again FEMA camps
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:11.160]  confirmed and hit them again hit them with bombshell FEMA camps let's see
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:16.480]  them try to block both those so I just fired two torpedoes bombshell FEMA
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:21.680]  camps bombshell FEMA camps and FEMA camps confirmed two separate search
[02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:25.560]  terms nothing can stop you ladies and gentlemen you are awesome look at the
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:28.760]  global revolts that we're starting and then I forget my search term from the
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:34.760]  first hour that's why I'm asking for the blue screen so I can okay it's revolt
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:39.040]  against TSA that's what I thought it was revolt there it is revolt against TSA
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:42.560]  and that's destined to be number one in the next hour than the others later and
[02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:45.000]  throughout the weekend you keep searching the term are finishing up with
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:50.160]  Bob Chapman Bob briefly what's your take on the naked body scanner revolt of the
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:54.200]  pat downs of the grabbing women and children's genitals even Atlantic
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:58.600]  Monthly Jeffrey Goldberg's reporting on this this is huge they're having emergency
[02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:03.080]  meetings at the White House right now with the you know heads of Disney World
[02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:09.640]  you name it I mean this is big it is big and it's a national disgrace that these
[02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:14.660]  people would even attempt to do such things to control people this is what
[02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:21.120]  it's really all about and I I hope they revolt so that every machine is taken
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:26.520]  out of everywhere and sent down to the machine dump someplace because it did
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:33.080]  there's absolutely no reason for doing those kind of things to people and there
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:38.560]  needs to be an investigation of Chertoff purchasing billions of machines in late
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:43.360]  2008 before he left office and then becoming the CEO of the company I
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:49.760]  mean that's brazen well it certainly is something that should be investigated
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:54.200]  but unfortunately in Washington today no matter what you do you get away with
[02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:58.760]  it but just to bring it up to the public attention and cause the
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:03.280]  consternation that it will cause and they will do away with them they're not
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:07.280]  going to keep them in there well said Bob Chapman Bob in closing folks can call

[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:51.240]  so much Bob Chapman the crusader for Liberty I was really excited when true
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:56.960]  TV folks called me Michael Braverman and Tyrell and said hey we think the police
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:38:00.560]  state episode that you're in is the most powerful it's groundbreaking and I was
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:04.160]  there I was at the FEMA centers I mean with Jesse I haven't been able to talk
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:08.240]  about it but now they're allowing folks because this is so big it airs tonight
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:12.240]  9 p.m. central 10 p.m. Eastern you know I'm gonna be watching it the episode I
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:15.880]  think is the next powerful is the JFK with the deathbed confession eHoward
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:20.160]  Hunt coming up next Friday and it's really important because there's been
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:26.520]  all these denials about FEMA camps and now it's all coming out now of course
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:31.360]  Braverman has worked extensively with Jesse Ventura for many years and of
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:35.760]  course he's produced a whole bunch of hit television shows one of them the
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:39.880]  number one new show of course the last two years on true TV getting record
[02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:43.680]  ratings there and there's no doubt why because they're they're covering things
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:48.000]  that's never been on national television it's been here on this show but but
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.120]  never with the budget never with the research never on national television
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:56.240]  and tonight's police state episode is absolutely off the charts and the
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:39:00.280]  articles bombshell FEMA camps confirmed and we're making FEMA camps
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:03.760]  confirmed the search term please put it in Google over and over again and then
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:07.400]  separately bombshell FEMA camps let's see them try to censor that like they
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:11.160]  tried yesterday and failed they tried they tried and failed they tried and
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:15.640]  failed let's go to Michael Braverman Michael good to have you here with us
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:19.520]  hey Alex thanks for having me on so much is going on I gotta ask you what's
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:24.120]  your take on the naked body scanners you know what I listened a little bit to
[02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:27.920]  your last guess I think this whole thing is gonna go down in flames or up in
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:32.880]  flames because people aren't gonna stand for it it's just they're they're now
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:37.880]  got to the point where we're the masses of population are going to start to push back this
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:42.760]  could be the trigger kind of like the t-tax in 1776 I'm not getting I mean
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:47.520]  this is huge now so much is coming out you got I think of last year's episodes
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:52.800]  how you had made the global warming fraud special and then everything in your
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:56.640]  special even though it'd been produced and finished weeks before it came out
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:40:00.160]  right as climate gate broke and it made international headlines because you got
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:05.080]  people at the UN to admit they'd engaged in in chicanery and lies now this I
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:09.040]  believe is even bigger but it's up to the listeners to spread the word I mean I
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:13.280]  know Tyrell agrees Jesse agrees what's your view on this key episode coming up
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:18.320]  tonight I'll tell you what I you know just to back up a little bit I always call
[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:22.840]  this show the miracle show I call conspiracy theory a miracle because
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:27.760]  having been in the trenches of the TV business the fact that we're the fact
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:33.040]  that we're on and we're in our second season is overstated again a miracle
[02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:38.040]  to have a show like this that exposes the things that we do in the mass media
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:42.160]  and the or the corporate media as some people call it but in the mass media on
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:48.480]  a network that reaches 90 million homes it is to me unbelievable and a lot of it
[02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:52.800]  is to the support of people that are your listeners and other people that you
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:57.280]  know have open minds and are willing to look at you know at an alternative and
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:02.320]  are willing to accept an alternative and this episode is going to air tonight
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:05.680]  you know I've seen a lot of stuff Alex you and I have talked a couple of
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:09.200]  different times you know many times I've seen a lot of stuff in producing the
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:15.120]  show but this stuff the stuff that's on tonight I gotta tell you it keeps me up
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:18.320]  it keeps me up at night thinking about what's really what the government is
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:22.920]  really doing and the stuff that we thought we we see it we prove it and we
[02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:27.800]  have people looking at our faces and just and just lying lying right in the
[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:33.800]  camera it's unbelievable absolutely and I'm very proud to be associated with
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:37.240]  this important episode you've got the water episode coming up how they're
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:41.040]  hoarding and taking over all the water by the way I'll just stop you for a
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:47.320]  second that will blow people's minds blow your minds we're gonna talk about
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:51.200]  some of the other episodes coming up but specifically I've got the bullet points
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:56.200]  of what we're able to reveal Michael you've got the floor walk through prelude
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:42:01.040]  a kind of first look of what people are gonna see tonight 9 p.m. central well
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:04.400]  what they're gonna see is a couple different things we're gonna tell a
[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:10.280]  story that begins with the story that if you if you said it to your friends and
[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:14.200]  neighbors they would go come on it's unbelievable it sounds like fiction what
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:18.720]  you're gonna see tonight sounds like a made-up story you know made-up
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:23.880]  fictional story but it's not I mean you watch this thing and we're gonna show
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:29.840]  you a coffin storage yard and I know Alex you were there on that shoot with
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:34.440]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of coffins they're just stacked up waiting
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:38.520]  for some and right as we got there to shoot also the truck show up and started
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:41.880]  moving them out now you can draw your own conclusions about that they knew it
[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:45.400]  they knew we were coming they knew we were gonna be there and I wanted to get
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:49.320]  that stuff yeah driver even told the locals we talked to multiple locals who
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:53.320]  talked to the drivers because it's there in a neighborhood area with some woods
[02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:56.280]  behind it that yeah they told us you know because people are coming out here
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:42:59.800]  and we know the media is coming and then and then there's the usual suspects
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:03.800]  popular mechanics supposedly debunks it by doing a straw man saying that the
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:08.040]  locals are involved the locals that were storing it are good people the fact is
[02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:12.000]  we know and I got I gave you guys the documents that emergency managers in
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:15.360]  New York Indiana and other states including Alabama and Georgia have
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:19.520]  confirmed there is a CDC program preparing for mass graves of millions of
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:23.120]  dead Americans during a bio attack sorry go ahead no that's absolutely right and
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:27.080]  then we move on in the episode to these things called fusion centers and I didn't
[02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:30.320]  know what the heck a fusion center was so I started you know doing the research
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:34.200]  and building out this show there are these places all over the country I
[02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:39.320]  think there's 90 of them where it's federal state the local you know cops
[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:44.720]  FBI DEA ice everybody I'll get together and they share information and they say
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:48.040]  they don't watch people they watch and I'm gonna put in you'll see this the
[02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:52.520]  guy says it directly they watch trends and as Jesse says or trends who makes
[02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:56.480]  trends people make trends and it's been proven and you anybody can do
[02:43:56.480 --> 02:44:00.320]  will see in Missouri the fusion center in Missouri was sued because they were
[02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:06.560]  watching people with Rand with Paul Ron bowl stickers on their cars anybody
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:11.840]  associated with the third-party movement or people who were conspiracy
[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:18.200]  theorists now you tell me anybody listen to this program you tell me so it
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:22.160]  basically it's if I need to talk police I don't know what it is if I believe in
[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:25.440]  conspiracies and I go on conspiracy websites or I want to talk to somebody
[02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:31.720]  I go to a meeting I'm on a watch list when did that happen in this country it's
[02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:37.520]  Soviet style secret police and then they stop people that protest the the
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:40.600]  Mayak Homeland Security reports that law enforcement sent us that we broke of
[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:45.760]  course when locals protested then they get followed and just a month ago I had a
[02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:51.240]  Pennsylvania representative on who was having tea parties and gun rallies and
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:56.040]  so he was surveilled by Homeland Security I mean this is incredible
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:45:01.840]  right it's not really political like what's the next step if I go if I go to a
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:06.040]  Middle Eastern restaurant am I gonna get watched if I go to a gun show I mean
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:10.000]  it's a point is it's not political it's everything they don't like it's an
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:13.560]  attempt to intimidate everybody correct no matter where your politics are and
[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:15.840]  that's my point you could be on the right you can be on the left doesn't matter
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:18.880]  you could be in a tea party rally or you could be you know you could be in a
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:22.720]  Ron Paul rally or you could be you know believing in conspiracy theories it
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:27.040]  doesn't matter anti-war groups are being watched all the time and then we
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:32.040]  found out that that these fusion centers are actually a precursor to these
[02:45:32.040 --> 02:45:36.520]  mass female camps that you just discussed so this thing all kind of
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:40.560]  tied in together and it's it all kind of goes down you know one thing leads to
[02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:44.960]  another and then you get to the female camps and then you find out and you
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:50.440]  know Alex you've been so helpful a lot of stuff then you find out that President
[02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:55.320]  Obama's executive order divides the country into 10 sectors so forget about
[02:45:55.320 --> 02:46:00.360]  your state government forget about your governor in a crisis these 10 hand-ticked
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:04.680]  governors are now going to take over these 10 sectors of the country
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:09.320]  unbelievable which you know and people I've told people who seem on my own
[02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:14.520]  family they go come on you're making this up I go no I mean that's like
[02:46:14.520 --> 02:46:19.560]  classical tyranny that's like the line from Star Wars you know episode 4 a new
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:23.520]  hope when they're on the deck of the you know command area of the Death Star and
[02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:27.160]  Darth Vader and Governor talk walk-in and they say the Emperor's dissolved the
[02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:33.440]  Senate and he says and and one of the commander says gotten rid of the Senate
[02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:36.680]  who's gonna maintain control the regional governors will control their
[02:46:36.680 --> 02:46:41.720]  systems I mean that is classic tyranny right there well also to I mean I mean
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:46.040]  you know it takes it's another way to take power away from the hands of people
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:52.280]  and put power into the hands of people of a tiny group of people that they think
[02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:56.560]  no better that's the part that scares well this is FEMA government you've got
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:00.520]  10 FEMA regions now with 10 governors over them and in the John Warner
[02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:05.820]  Defense Authorization Act it says that the government can now just just set
[02:47:05.820 --> 02:47:10.480]  aside Congress for six months and operate under this yeah yeah and and when
[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:13.800]  you realize that these things are real and these things are are in writing and
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:17.160]  they're in place and they're waiting they're all there the triggers waiting
[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:21.240]  to be pulled and again I came out this is you know Alex from a kind of a
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:24.600]  neutral point of view I mean you know the TV guy and a guy in the business
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:30.480]  and stuff I tell you a show like tonight again it keeps me up at night
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:35.000]  because I think you know this stuff is we're not making this stuff up well I've
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.280]  worked on a lot of shows with you Michael with Tyrell and Jesse and the
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:41.920]  whole great crew and you guys take it serious you go into it you know not
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:44.800]  knowing if it's real or not and unfortunately it always turns out to
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:47.840]  be real and worse than you thought but you guys is it accurate to say I've
[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:51.480]  been a little bit shaken up by this episode yeah this is one of the ones
[02:47:51.480 --> 02:47:55.760]  and the one you mentioned to the water one and a couple others that I can't
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:58.840]  talk about they're coming really really soon in this season because we have I
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:02.920]  think five weeks left five Fridays left and we'll talk more as we approach those
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:08.560]  maybe the next couple weeks but the water one that the JFK one is a mind
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:12.280]  blower for anybody who lived through that error or anybody's interested in that era this
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:17.280]  episode about this water conspiracy is something I had no idea about and I
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:23.960]  guarantee you 97% of Americans have no idea about let's go back to tonight's
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:29.160]  episode 9 p.m. central 10 p.m. Eastern and folks can find a true TV on your

[02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:50.080]  this is groundbreaking this proves it and connects it and you have all the
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:55.440]  documents and the video this this this is the FEMA camp film I wish I could have
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:59.400]  made but didn't have the resources well I appreciate that and I would just
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:05.080]  urge everybody to tell people to watch this I'm not even saying to people but
[02:49:05.080 --> 02:49:08.520]  I know you don't do this either I'm not telling you to believe it or not believe
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:13.960]  it I'm saying watch it with an open mind draw your own conclusion and one thing I
[02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:18.160]  will say is that you know your audience and the people who do have an open mind
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:21.680]  and the people who do ask questions and don't just believe what they're told
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:25.720]  there are supporters there are the people who support this show and we need
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:29.560]  them to watch this show we need them to watch this show tonight and all the
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:32.680]  subsequent shows especially the one tonight because we want to stay on the
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:37.560]  air we want to keep bringing this stuff to you know to a mass audience to 90
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:42.000]  million homes nice as I said at the beginning it's a miracle that we've
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:46.320]  lasted into our second season we're hit but we need to stay on the air and we
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:50.560]  need everyone's support we need everybody to tune in you know tell your

[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:02.480]  serious look at what's really going on in this country well that's right the
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:06.600]  mainstream media has always had the laugh factor made fun of anybody that
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:10.280]  questioned any corruption and now it comes out the Gulf of Tonkin was staged
[02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:13.680]  it comes out the government shooting up little kids with syphilis and Guatemala
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:16.840]  and now people are really starting to pay attention and it's not just that it

[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:57.000]  have information which I have to keep for obvious reasons very very private
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:02.680]  but I have information that there are forces out there powerful forces they
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:06.720]  want to show off the air they want us off they don't want to talk about stuff
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:11.080]  like the me camps I don't want to talk about stuff like the JFK assassination
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:15.280]  they don't want us talking about you know these these really controversial
[02:55:15.280 --> 02:55:21.120]  important things Wall Street water Wall Street water they want us off the air
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:25.720]  Alex I can't see any clearer than that you know I've got some information from
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:30.160]  people I know it sounds like that you know trust me I'm not making this up I
[02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:34.960]  understand this scary stuff and I'm fighting and you're fighting and Jesse
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:38.880]  especially you know more important than all of us is fighting really hard to
[02:55:38.880 --> 02:55:43.600]  keep this show on the air and in our business in the TV business there's
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:49.280]  one thing that beats all of them and that's ratings so people support us and
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:52.480]  people enjoy the show and they're again it's you know you're willing to come to
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:56.080]  an open mind don't have to agree with everything we say but you have to have an
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:55:59.840]  open mind and if you want to show like this on the mass media again what I
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:03.680]  call it at the very beginning the miracle show if you want to stay on the
[02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:07.720]  mass media and be able to reach 90 million homes you know we need everybody's
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:13.080]  help and you know because again ratings it's a money business ratings win and
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:18.360]  if we get the ratings I can with everybody's help we can beat back these
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:21.880]  people that want us off here and these are big powerful people Michael let me
[02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:25.320]  throw this out at you I don't want you to get in trouble for saying too much but
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:29.080]  I know quite a bit about behind the scenes they've had people in suits digging
[02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:34.680]  through Tyrell Ventura's trash I mean it goes on and on but but obviously we
[02:56:34.680 --> 02:56:38.280]  talked a little bit behind the scenes if because this is seen as a genre by the
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:42.560]  establishment if this is a hit show which it is now other people are gonna
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:46.760]  pitch these shows on other networks that I know other networks are looking at
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:50.440]  similar things Beck is getting record audiences doing the same thing it's not
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:54.600]  conspiracy theories talking about real issues the system is scared yes and the
[02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:58.200]  old Hollywood elite we talked about this last year they're getting upset
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:03.520]  because they understand that we are starting to take over big time and it's
[02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:07.720]  exactly right if we weren't a successful show we wouldn't have any problems you
[02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:10.760]  know because then you know we'd be below the radar and I think we ran below the
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:14.040]  radar in the first year and now suddenly we're back and we're doing
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:18.400]  numbers and we're doing stuff like FEMA camps the conspiracy to steal water
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:22.720]  you know when you do this stuff you know suddenly people in high positions they
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:26.960]  start to take notice and suddenly you start to get all kinds of strange things
[02:57:26.960 --> 02:57:30.360]  happening to you some of them you know I can't talk about I know Tyrell talked
[02:57:30.360 --> 02:57:34.600]  about the guy going through his his trash I've had some things happen to me
