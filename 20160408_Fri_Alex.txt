[00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:12.225]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:13.545]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:18.367]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:03.382 --> 00:01:10.344]  The momentum of the slippery slope to demolish our inherent rights protected by the First Amendment is picking up speed.
[00:01:10.344 --> 00:01:21.208]  Back in January of 2014, federal prosecutors threw the book at author and documentary filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza for exaggerated campaign finance law violations.
[00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:22.049]  In September of 2014,
[00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:32.937]  D'Souza was sentenced to five years probation, eight months in a halfway house, a $30,000 fine, community service, and mandatory therapy.
[00:01:32.937 --> 00:01:40.243]  Even the liberal Harvard Law professor, Alan Dershowitz, said the felony sentencing smacked of selective prosecution.
[00:01:40.243 --> 00:01:41.064]  Why?
[00:01:41.064 --> 00:01:49.251]  It just so happened that D'Souza had made a highly successful documentary criticizing President Barack Obama.
[00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:56.335]  Unfortunately, D'Souza's admission of guilt set the precedent for a newfound attack on the First Amendment.
[00:01:56.335 --> 00:02:00.137]  The liberals had tasted blood, and they wanted more.
[00:02:00.137 --> 00:02:13.064]  Matt Drudge had warned in 2015 that plans to take down conservative, i.e., right-wing, i.e., alternative media were gathering steam in the back rooms of Washington, D.C.
[00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:15.645]  No, they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[00:02:15.645 --> 00:02:17.666]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:19.527]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[00:02:19.527 --> 00:02:30.853]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[00:02:30.853 --> 00:02:32.554]  Then that will end for me.
[00:02:32.554 --> 00:02:34.175]  Fine, I've had a hell of a run.
[00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:54.012]  So when pro-life activist David Daleiden exposed Planned Parenthood's sale of fetal tissue via secret recordings and investigative techniques, the liberal Rockefeller-supported organization Planned Parenthood used the unchecked liberal inertia to slap Daleiden with a possible 22-year sentence.
[00:02:54.012 --> 00:02:58.796]  While beyond the embarrassment, no charges were ever filed against Planned Parenthood.
[00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:11.280]  Now documentary filmmaker Joel Gilbert, creator of the Obama expose, Dreams From My Real Father, faces a federal precedent-setting onslaught by the FEC.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:22.064]  WorldNetDaily writes, in a case spotlighting regulation of conservative media, the three Democrats on the FEC alleged Gilbert violated
[00:03:24.708 --> 00:03:33.150]  When he mailed out DVDs of his movie Dreams for My Real Father, a story of reds and deception, during the 2012 election campaign.
[00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:43.333]  The panel's three Republican members quashed the move, however, arguing the standard media exemption had been given to liberal filmmakers such as Michael Moore.
[00:03:43.493 --> 00:04:03.494]  Gilbert added, if the makeup of the Federal Election Commission is changed because a Democrat wins the presidency and appoints one more Democrat than Republican to the commission, we face a dire future in which only political speech favorable to far-left agenda will be tolerated in America.
[00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:06.777]  Documentary films shown on television or the internet.
[00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:11.740]  or broadcast over radio may be subject to criminal penalties.
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:30.193]  Gilbert said, the liberal line is being drawn in the sand and as the Obama administration slowly reveals its teeth, their guard goes down as the possibility of their actions backfires into charges against their own criminal violations of the First Amendment.
[00:04:30.193 --> 00:04:32.755]  We are seeing nothing less than a witch hunt.
[00:04:32.955 --> 00:04:35.418]  Masquerading as a liberal agenda.
[00:04:35.418 --> 00:04:48.692]  It's not that they're breaking the laws, it's that the laws are so poorly designed that they allow people, if they've got enough lawyers and enough accountants, to wiggle out of responsibilities that ordinary citizens are having to abide by.
[00:04:48.692 --> 00:04:50.194]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:05:01.363 --> 00:05:05.225]  The future of flawless skin, brought to you by the CIA.
[00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:10.209]  That's right, the CIA is funding a skincare product that collects your DNA.
[00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:18.013]  SkinCentral Sciences is a company with an innovative line of cosmetic products marketed as a way to erase blemishes and soften skin.
[00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:28.620]  Via patented technology, a thin outer layer of the skin is removed, revealing unique biomarkers that can be used for a variety of diagnostic tests, including DNA collection.
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.643]  According to The Intercept, the skincare startup has attracted interest and funding from In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA.
[00:05:36.643 --> 00:05:44.946]  In-Q-Tel provides venture funding to help grow tech firms that develop the technology that will support the mission of the CIA and other intelligence agencies.
[00:05:44.946 --> 00:05:54.529]  The CIA fund approached the company saying the fund shares an interest in looking at DNA extraction using the method pioneered by SkinCentral Sciences.
[00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:56.910]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:01.968]  Uh, yeah.
[00:06:01.968 --> 00:06:07.793]  First of all, I want to say, Bigfoot 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[00:06:07.793 --> 00:06:08.754]  I use them all.
[00:06:08.754 --> 00:06:09.735]  They're phenomenal.
[00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:10.476]  They work.
[00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:11.316]  Fine folks.
[00:06:11.316 --> 00:06:11.737]  Thank you, brother.
[00:06:11.737 --> 00:06:13.718]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[00:06:13.718 --> 00:06:19.944]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[00:06:19.944 --> 00:06:21.946]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[00:06:21.946 --> 00:06:27.351]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:28.512]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[00:06:28.512 --> 00:06:33.174]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, AcuFX, uh, Nascent... Mike, let me ask you a question.
[00:06:33.174 --> 00:06:34.235]  Have they worked for you?
[00:06:34.235 --> 00:06:37.076]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[00:06:37.076 --> 00:06:38.177]  What products are you taking?
[00:06:38.177 --> 00:06:46.461]  Are you taking... Everything from, uh, Super Male to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2, even got a little, uh, DNA Force.
[00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:49.923]  So, and I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:05.063]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:07:05.063 --> 00:07:11.368]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:07:11.368 --> 00:07:18.654]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:27.462]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:07:27.762 --> 00:07:33.926]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:07:33.926 --> 00:07:38.769]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:07:38.769 --> 00:07:42.351]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:44.253]  No needles, no injections.
[00:07:44.253 --> 00:07:45.894]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:07:45.894 --> 00:07:47.094]  Try it for yourself.
[00:07:47.094 --> 00:07:49.396]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[00:08:03.486 --> 00:08:06.248]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:06.248 --> 00:08:19.839]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:25.703]  Leaked memo reveals how the Donald Trump campaign really feels about mainstream media.
[00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:28.565]  And the government.
[00:08:28.565 --> 00:08:33.467]  We're going to be breaking that down in this hour.
[00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:42.109]  We also have a lot of really, really big reports out there that we're going to be going over, dealing with this so-called biggest WikiLeaks-style data dump ever.
[00:08:42.109 --> 00:08:46.530]  When I first saw this yesterday, I said, it's going to be low-level groups trying to protect their money.
[00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.251]  It's going to be the Russian networks.
[00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:53.232]  As soon as I saw that they were going after that soccer, that international football group,
[00:08:54.517 --> 00:09:12.072]  This is the big mega banks that control trillions, that create trillions in derivatives, that engage in all forms of drug dealing, money laundering, child kidnapping, white slavery, overthrow governments, 5 billion to overthrow Ukraine, 5 billion to the rebels in Syria.
[00:09:13.598 --> 00:09:24.128]  This is the most corrupt group you can imagine simply leaking this to the Germans, handing it out to a hundred different newspapers or more in the last year to quote vet it.
[00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:29.593]  No, that was to make sure that it didn't connect to any Western operations and to cherry pick what to go after.
[00:09:31.707 --> 00:09:33.268]  And sure enough, it's in the news today.
[00:09:33.268 --> 00:09:38.592]  They're saying this is a selective leak by the West against other networks they don't control.
[00:09:38.592 --> 00:09:39.312]  This is how it works.
[00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:44.896]  You get Arthur Anderson previously, or now it's another big accounting firm that the former Attorney General runs.
[00:09:44.896 --> 00:09:46.897]  Then you can have offshore accounts.
[00:09:46.897 --> 00:09:48.338]  Then you cannot pay taxes.
[00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:58.685]  They certify it and the government doesn't touch it because it's full of vice presidents, former presidents on their boards, former attorney generals, former FBI directors.
[00:09:58.685 --> 00:10:00.086]  There's only two or three of these firms in D.C.
[00:10:01.826 --> 00:10:02.707]  Like Arthur Anderson.
[00:10:02.707 --> 00:10:03.788]  And then you're left alone.
[00:10:03.788 --> 00:10:06.170]  Now the law says you can have an offshore bank account.
[00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.934]  The law says you can go to the Cayman Islands or Switzerland or Luxembourg.
[00:10:10.934 --> 00:10:15.017]  But when they want to, they will come and shake you down and arrest you.
[00:10:15.017 --> 00:10:24.125]  This is a model of global government where you have the FBI going out and arresting the leadership of the International Football League, of the International Soccer League.
[00:10:24.963 --> 00:10:33.892]  This is global governance, and I'm going to go over that later in the hour with our guest and get his view on it, because he's an expert on people going offshore and more.
[00:10:33.892 --> 00:10:38.757]  But Wikileaks reveals IMF plan to cause a credit event in Greece and destabilize Europe.
[00:10:38.757 --> 00:10:39.478]  Don't forget that.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.041]  The French elite, where it went wrong.
[00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:45.402]  Financial Times admitting they don't pay taxes themselves.
[00:10:45.402 --> 00:10:49.084]  French billionaire's assault to face trial for tax fraud.
[00:10:49.084 --> 00:10:51.866]  Chinese newspaper editor resigns over media control.
[00:10:51.866 --> 00:10:55.828]  Associated Press willfully cooperated with the Nazis to show how they're controlled.
[00:10:55.828 --> 00:10:59.189]  Top German journalist admits mainstream media is completely fake.
[00:10:59.189 --> 00:11:02.811]  We quote, all lie for the CIA in Germany.
[00:11:02.811 --> 00:11:04.952]  It's a whole bunch of their biggest reporters coming out.
[00:11:04.952 --> 00:11:05.813]  Why is that important?
[00:11:05.813 --> 00:11:07.994]  Because when it comes out of Germany particularly,
[00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.893]  People see Germany as like, oh, modern, liberal, you can really trust it.
[00:11:13.893 --> 00:11:18.777]  It's the worst garbage you'll ever find.
[00:11:18.777 --> 00:11:33.589]  Some of their news is accurate, if you research it, but general scandal news is really coming out of the CIA, out of the MI6, out of Israel, out of other groups, but they fence it through Germany, because somehow they have credibility.
[00:11:33.589 --> 00:11:34.870]  They never got over being occupied.
[00:11:36.174 --> 00:11:41.517]  High earners say goodbye to France, so again, they want this international tax grab.
[00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:54.404]  Tax traders widen division in belt-tightening France, and now they're trying to blame Russia for $2 billion in the quote, biggest scandal ever with this Panama data dump, the Panama Papers.
[00:11:54.404 --> 00:11:55.024]  $2 billion?
[00:11:55.024 --> 00:11:56.545]  I mean, that is nothing.
[00:11:56.545 --> 00:11:59.487]  You know how many trillions exchange hands in the currency markets every day?
[00:12:00.407 --> 00:12:10.711]  The rigged stock markets, the rigged credit default swaps, the rigged currency, the rigged interest rates, all of it.
[00:12:10.711 --> 00:12:13.252]  They admit it's all rigged is what's crazy.
[00:12:13.252 --> 00:12:24.137]  Just like they've tried to steal elections, they've manipulated them before, but never come right out and said, we're going to put Paul Ryan in, this is Karl Rove last week, even if he doesn't have one delegate.
[00:12:25.123 --> 00:12:30.926]  And Kasich is showing his wares saying, you know, it doesn't matter if he's only got a few, he deserves to win.
[00:12:30.926 --> 00:12:35.728]  I don't know what you call this coming out in the open.
[00:12:35.728 --> 00:12:38.889]  Is this really the fall of America, the fall of the West?
[00:12:38.889 --> 00:12:42.411]  Or is this a psyop to prepare us for just anything?
[00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:46.593]  Because when things get this crazy in history, you go over the edge of a cliff.
[00:12:46.593 --> 00:12:49.294]  Are we going over the edge of the cliff right now?
[00:12:49.294 --> 00:12:50.795]  Have we reached the event horizon?
[00:12:52.093 --> 00:12:53.433]  We're going to talk geopolitics.
[00:12:53.433 --> 00:12:54.354]  We're going to talk Syria.
[00:12:54.354 --> 00:12:55.474]  We're going to talk Iran.
[00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:57.455]  We're going to talk Ukraine.
[00:12:57.455 --> 00:12:58.395]  We're going to talk Obama.
[00:12:58.395 --> 00:13:01.636]  We're going to talk Black Lives Matter and the destabilization program.
[00:13:01.636 --> 00:13:06.418]  We're going to talk the entire waterfront, 2016 and beyond.
[00:13:06.418 --> 00:13:08.338]  But first off, I don't know his view.
[00:13:08.338 --> 00:13:12.660]  I follow his articles, but he's pretty libertarian, conservative, apolitical, though.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.561]  He just does analysis of the world.
[00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.541]  Best-selling nonfiction author.
[00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:18.222]  Best-selling fiction author.
[00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:24.835]  James Wesley Rawls is an American novelist and blogger who is best known for his recently completed Patriots novel series.
[00:13:24.835 --> 00:13:26.035]  Rawls is a former U.S.
[00:13:26.035 --> 00:13:27.396]  Army intelligence officer.
[00:13:27.396 --> 00:13:34.958]  He is the founder of the senior editor of SurvivalBlog.com, which is one of the top sites in the world with tens of millions of visitors a month.
[00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:41.100]  For the past 10 years, he's covered survival and preparedness topics from a constitutional Christian libertarian perspective.
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.941]  His latest novel is titled Land of Promise.
[00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:43.841]  He's got another one coming out too.
[00:13:44.241 --> 00:13:47.544]  The first book in the Counter Caliphate Chronicle series.
[00:13:47.544 --> 00:13:52.688]  This novel, set two decades in the future, describes the establishment of a Christian nation under siege.
[00:13:52.688 --> 00:13:57.312]  Now, I could do three hours with this guy, because I got a lot to say, a lot of angles to cover.
[00:13:57.312 --> 00:14:03.737]  He's only on to the bottom of the next hour, but I want to invite him back in a few weeks for a part two, for two full hours, because he was willing to do it today.
[00:14:03.737 --> 00:14:04.318]  He's a busy guy.
[00:14:05.828 --> 00:14:09.170]  Because I've got my reporters popping in for the last 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.572]  I may push them, though, up to David Knight, though.
[00:14:11.572 --> 00:14:12.692]  We'll see how this goes.
[00:14:12.692 --> 00:14:15.694]  But I just threw out that menu of what I want to cover.
[00:14:15.694 --> 00:14:19.517]  But front and center is, what is this caliphate plan?
[00:14:19.517 --> 00:14:25.781]  Why would the West be bold enough to bring in 5 million people they know, many of which are military-age men and are jihadis?
[00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:32.847]  Will they carry out attacks and then martial law comes in like areas of Europe have already done?
[00:14:32.847 --> 00:14:37.909]  And how will our political elite get away with bringing them in and then having them attack us?
[00:14:37.909 --> 00:14:41.691]  Is that part of this victory over logic and common sense?
[00:14:41.691 --> 00:14:47.274]  Just like, in effect, they're suspending the election by stealing Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump's delegates.
[00:14:48.453 --> 00:14:49.574]  Openly.
[00:14:49.574 --> 00:14:51.215]  I mean, we're really entering a new phase.
[00:14:51.215 --> 00:14:52.395]  Is this bravado?
[00:14:52.395 --> 00:14:53.336]  Is this arrogance?
[00:14:53.336 --> 00:14:54.736]  Is this megalomania?
[00:14:54.736 --> 00:14:57.658]  Or is this a desperate attempt to look confident?
[00:14:57.658 --> 00:14:59.779]  I've thrown out a lot there.
[00:14:59.779 --> 00:15:02.621]  James Wesley Rawls, survivalblog.com.
[00:15:02.621 --> 00:15:04.742]  We're going to break here in about 15 minutes.
[00:15:04.742 --> 00:15:05.983]  You've got the floor.
[00:15:05.983 --> 00:15:10.925]  Tell us where you want to start first and what you think is currently happening.
[00:15:10.925 --> 00:15:14.327]  Well, Alex, I think looking at it from a 30,000 foot view,
[00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:39.660]  What we have in the global geopolitical realm is with the end of the Cold War, the powers that be needed to have a continued destabilization as an excuse for carrying on with all of their banking shenanigans, their massive military buildups and so forth.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:56.785]  They, in effect, through Osama Bin Laden and other Islamic leaders, that they supported, the CIA itself created ISIS, as you've pointed out many times.
[00:15:56.785 --> 00:15:59.926]  They want destabilization.
[00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:10.710]  They are hoping that they can walk the tightrope of destabilization to the point where they can continue to consolidate power
[00:16:11.502 --> 00:16:36.264]  With a massively centralized government, with an electronic currency replacing physical currency, and with the whole statist agenda, by building up the Islamic threat, and then hoping to counter that threat, all the time accumulating more power and wealth for themselves.
[00:16:36.986 --> 00:16:53.134]  But what I'm afraid is going to happen is that they are going to over destabilize and they will, in effect, create their own downfall and perhaps the downfall of all the Western nations in the process.
[00:16:53.134 --> 00:17:01.398]  They're hoping that they can kind of lock that tightrope and carry on year after year after year.
[00:17:02.674 --> 00:17:17.365]  But I'm afraid it's going to come back and blow up in their face because a lot of these terrorist groups that they have created don't have any compunctions at all against using true weapons of mass destruction.
[00:17:17.365 --> 00:17:22.229]  So that Wall Street itself may be the next ground zero.
[00:17:22.229 --> 00:17:31.416]  And their best laid plans of these totalitarian wannabes is going to come back and haunt them.
[00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:34.300]  Well, you just crystallized it perfectly.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.242]  I want you to continue, but I just want to back up, sir, what you were just saying.
[00:17:39.242 --> 00:17:42.664]  Obviously, I know you're retired, but you talked to a lot of your sources in government.
[00:17:42.664 --> 00:17:46.886]  I have amazing sources, high level in government, but also out.
[00:17:46.886 --> 00:17:48.707]  People say, well, I mean, how do you do that?
[00:17:48.707 --> 00:17:50.267]  They're going up for whistleblowers.
[00:17:50.267 --> 00:17:52.869]  Things are so bad now that mainly the U.S.
[00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:53.089]  Army
[00:17:53.952 --> 00:17:55.993]  Strangely enough, that's just historical.
[00:17:55.993 --> 00:18:04.098]  One of the oldest institutions in this country has been the main group inside the Pentagon saying no to Syria, no to all these events, no to double-crossing Egypt.
[00:18:04.098 --> 00:18:09.601]  And they are basically telling the neocons, the left, and the socialists, you better stop it.
[00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:22.628]  And there's such a socialist vein in this godless, atheist, New World Order culture that really the only ideology they have is destroy the better clangers, destroy the farms, collectivize everything under corporate control.
[00:18:24.185 --> 00:18:27.953]  You know, a type of high-tech, fascist, Great Leap Forward.
[00:18:27.953 --> 00:18:30.619]  Not communist, but fascist more like.
[00:18:30.619 --> 00:18:34.507]  And that they're blowing the engine that made the globalists have a major command base.
[00:18:35.399 --> 00:18:45.701]  And that the military, not even because the top brass and statisticians are angels, but because they want to keep playing golf and don't want their grandkids killed, they're saying stop it right now.
[00:18:45.701 --> 00:18:53.963]  You're about to bring civilization down by crisis creation because you keep getting more power out of crises, but at a certain point this black hole is going to swallow you.
[00:18:53.963 --> 00:19:03.025]  Now that message you just kind of threw out is the message I've been getting for about six years from high-level Pentagon people and others that obviously use this show as a conduit to warn people.
[00:19:03.385 --> 00:19:07.187]  But now, even down to low-level enlisted officers, they know.
[00:19:07.187 --> 00:19:09.547]  The military, basically, has been warned.
[00:19:09.547 --> 00:19:11.288]  About 90% of the Army's on board.
[00:19:11.288 --> 00:19:13.689]  About 60% of the Marines are on board.
[00:19:13.689 --> 00:19:15.870]  About 60% of the Navy knows what's going on.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.591]  For whatever reason, the Navy's not doing too good waking up.
[00:19:18.591 --> 00:19:20.432]  That's just kind of a dead reckoning number.
[00:19:21.363 --> 00:19:37.766]  But this is really a big deal where you almost have a Mexican standoff between institutions in our government, newer more corrupt private contractor institutions and delusional people like Hillary and Samantha Powers and Obama who have no idea what they're doing and watch SportsCenter all day.
[00:19:37.766 --> 00:19:44.628]  At least Hitler was in a bunker when he was endangering his whole country and doing super dangerous stuff and knew he could lose and had been in the military.
[00:19:45.208 --> 00:19:50.653]  These people are completely out of their minds, and it really is frightening to see them not knowing what they're doing.
[00:19:50.653 --> 00:19:53.876]  And is that what you're basically coming down to?
[00:19:53.876 --> 00:20:04.166]  Yes, I agree with you, Alex, that there is a level of self-delusion that now exists amongst the powers that be that's unprecedented.
[00:20:05.135 --> 00:20:21.051]  And their level of control over the economy, over the stock markets, manipulating the derivatives market, manipulating the precious metals market, which is a very thin market, the level of control they have is frightening.
[00:20:21.051 --> 00:20:24.074]  And again, it's likely to come back and blow up in their faces.
[00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.952]  It's the law of unintended consequences.
[00:20:27.952 --> 00:20:41.444]  So for many years you've talked about the Hegelian dialectic and it's been employed heavily for the last seven years under the Obama administration.
[00:20:41.444 --> 00:20:44.827]  And my fear is that regardless of who comes in
[00:20:47.188 --> 00:21:09.041]  In the next administration, we're probably going to see a statist of some sort who's going to want to continue playing the same game, playing the same political games, playing pressure groups off of one another, trying to increase divisiveness within our own country.
[00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:22.313]  By bringing in almost uncontrolled immigration of Islamists who are not going to be properly vetted at all.
[00:21:22.313 --> 00:21:28.079]  And in fact, right now there seems to be a preference within the US State Department
[00:21:29.113 --> 00:21:32.495]  To bring in Islamists rather than persecuted Christians.
[00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:52.640]  They put people at odds with one another to create friction, and out of that friction, they're, you know, it's the Hegelian dialectic again.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:22:04.773]  They create the crisis, and out of that crisis comes their solution, which is all stage-managed, to fill their coffers and to build political power.
[00:22:07.699 --> 00:22:27.814]  And then under their Agenda 21 depopulation program, they codify the cosmology of us being poor and them being rich as their guardians, getting rid of the scourge of humanity, all perfectly scripted, where they play savior of the earth, while they literally block industrialization, block systems that would set up a two
[00:22:30.114 --> 00:22:37.113]  Two-child family, with all the actuaries we know that lead towards stabilization, global prosperity.
[00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:46.802]  And a new renaissance, and they themselves, going back even to Bertrand Russell and the non-fiction books of H.G.
[00:22:46.802 --> 00:22:57.245]  Wells and Galton and all the rest of them, admit a hundred years ago that they were going to have to block a new renaissance and quote, kill a lot of beautiful and gallant people to quote H.G.
[00:22:57.245 --> 00:22:59.766]  Wells, to get their new world order.
[00:22:59.766 --> 00:23:02.626]  And even wrote the book and had the movie, Things to Come.
[00:23:02.626 --> 00:23:04.107]  The movie came out in the early thirties.
[00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:10.848]  Where they set up a world government run by a UN that flies around in giant B-2 style bombers.
[00:23:10.848 --> 00:23:12.770]  Actually shows B-2 bombers.
[00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:13.090]  Right.
[00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:20.076]  Nervegassing nation states and taking the guns from the people and depopulating the planet.
[00:23:20.076 --> 00:23:31.026]  I mean these people are completely out of their minds but the thing is they've got control because the British Empire got behind them and funded this wild dream and Mr. Rawls looks like they're pretty much getting there.
[00:23:31.026 --> 00:23:31.927]  Do you think they'll succeed?
[00:23:33.487 --> 00:23:34.968]  It seems like it.
[00:23:34.968 --> 00:23:37.950]  You mentioned HG Wells and Things to Come.
[00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:42.753]  He was a socialist, but he was very prescient about what might happen.
[00:23:42.753 --> 00:23:54.221]  And you'll notice that in the storyline of Things to Come, the way that they were able to create their global governance was out of the aftermath
[00:23:55.037 --> 00:24:01.358]  of a global socio-economic collapse following war after war after war.
[00:24:01.358 --> 00:24:05.299]  It looks a lot like what we're seeing right now.
[00:24:05.299 --> 00:24:15.462]  And that's why his boss, as you know, anybody can look this up, the letters, the writings are public, the man that basically took the British Empire and folded it into the U.S.
[00:24:15.462 --> 00:24:20.383]  Empire, Cecil Rhodes and the Rhodes Scholars, envisioned the whole plan we're currently living under.
[00:24:22.489 --> 00:24:25.811]  Yeah.
[00:24:25.811 --> 00:24:36.078]  Ironically, the legacy of Cecil Rhodes is now being protested in South Africa.
[00:24:36.078 --> 00:24:41.802]  They don't want anything to do with any of the colonialist
[00:24:46.776 --> 00:24:55.403]  They're literally tearing down statues in South Africa at the universities right now.
[00:24:55.403 --> 00:25:07.413]  Cecil Rhodes really had a view, not just for the African continent, not just, as they said in those days, Cape to Cairo, but for the whole world.
[00:25:08.582 --> 00:25:18.587]  And a lot of his protégés ended up creating organizations like the CFR and the Trilateral Commission and so forth.
[00:25:18.587 --> 00:25:36.736]  Years later, it's all been an almost uninterrupted chain of this quest for global dominance, global control, and they very wisely co-opted the educational system,
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.761]  The mass media and the banking system.
[00:25:40.761 --> 00:25:42.401]  And let's be clear, go further.
[00:25:42.401 --> 00:25:45.882]  Again, you're getting the inside scoop here, listeners.
[00:25:45.882 --> 00:26:03.928]  Cecil Rhodes, all the rest of it, they even said, I mean he wrote, you can read it, a hundred years ago, we will then even finally get rid of the trappings of the empire, the flags, the statues, the parades, the uniforms, and it'll be invisible through our corporate interlocking directorates like the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:26:04.588 --> 00:26:05.948]  And it'll be multinational.
[00:26:05.948 --> 00:26:13.050]  And now that's why at Oxford and places, they're supporting, you know, pulling down bust of the Queen.
[00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:26.513]  And that's why Obama sent back the bust of Churchill is because they're going to even let the socialists and leftists pull that down and believe they've defeated it when they've actually are helping it bring in the next phase, the end of free speech.
[00:26:26.513 --> 00:26:30.254]  I mean, these folks are so sophisticated.
[00:26:30.254 --> 00:26:30.935]  It is indeed.
[00:26:35.976 --> 00:26:52.620]  It's worth mentioning that 20 years ago, the socialists in England turned their own flag, the Union Jack, into a supposed symbol of racism and colonialism.
[00:26:54.168 --> 00:27:02.295]  And they declared that the Union Jack couldn't be used in political rallies and protests.
[00:27:02.295 --> 00:27:02.695]  That's right.
[00:27:02.695 --> 00:27:04.717]  In fact, the police tried to arrest you.
[00:27:04.717 --> 00:27:05.758]  Right.
[00:27:05.758 --> 00:27:07.279]  That was 20 years ago.
[00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:11.342]  And at the time, I was in shock and disbelief that that could happen.
[00:27:11.342 --> 00:27:17.808]  But right now, in America, we're on the verge of that happening with our own American flag.
[00:27:19.238 --> 00:27:19.679]  Exactly.
[00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:21.261]  They start with the rebel battle flag.
[00:27:21.261 --> 00:27:24.124]  It has nothing to do with slavery, but ignorant people are told so.
[00:27:24.124 --> 00:27:26.327]  So what if some toothless racists drive around with it?
[00:27:26.327 --> 00:27:27.889]  It's not what it symbolizes.
[00:27:27.889 --> 00:27:29.731]  And then now they want the American flag.
[00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:33.837]  And to expand on that, that was only one symbol of empire.
[00:27:33.837 --> 00:27:35.178]  The globalists have conquered.
[00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:42.465]  The Rothschilds owners have conquered England, they're using that model and the people they use to enforce it upon the world.
[00:27:42.465 --> 00:27:59.481]  It's moved on from England, it's still based there to a certain extent, but now they're demonizing anything Western, when it's England that ended slavery worldwide, it's England that brought forward the abolitionist movement, and now in the ultimate victory, while slavery goes on in more than 10 Muslim nations today,
[00:28:00.302 --> 00:28:02.764]  And women are slaves in hundreds of nations.
[00:28:02.764 --> 00:28:10.828]  It's okay because the greatest evil on earth is England where we got Magna Carta and the beginning of the Renaissance.
[00:28:10.828 --> 00:28:13.870]  You're so right Alex.
[00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:24.617]  It's just almost a sweet irony to see that the symbols of what really stand for freedom are being stood on their head
[00:28:26.031 --> 00:28:52.994]  And the institutions that really stand for individual liberty are being denigrated while everything that represents statism, control, collectivism, socialism, are being lifted up by people like the Obama administration, by all the socialists of Europe and so forth.
[00:28:54.801 --> 00:29:06.797]  Right now, we are living in what I refer to as the age of deception and betrayal, where our basic institutions are that anything that stands for freedom
[00:29:07.851 --> 00:29:10.452]  Is being cast in a bad light.
[00:29:10.452 --> 00:29:16.675]  We are living in the true fall of the West, and all the wealth and the cultural wealth being flushed down the toilet.
[00:29:16.675 --> 00:29:23.799]  When we come back, sir, I want to talk about what that looks like, what comes on the other side, if we don't beat it, and where you think we are in the fight against it.
[00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:25.460]  Amazing guest, James Wesley Rawls.
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.340]  We need to get him on more and more, but he's such a busy guy.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.742]  He usually can only come on for an hour, and that's rarely.
[00:29:29.742 --> 00:29:30.882]  He offered two hours today.
[00:29:30.882 --> 00:29:34.324]  I may just push the reporters, even though I love them and want them on.
[00:29:35.104 --> 00:29:47.607]  End of the fourth hour, check with Knight, see if that's good with him in the first 30 minutes because I want to really walk through all this and look at the different sectors of the globe and the master plan because knowing this plan, and this is a plan, I mean, this is public, folks.
[00:29:47.607 --> 00:29:49.648]  Knowing the plan is our chance to beat it.
[00:29:49.648 --> 00:29:50.928]  You understand how important this is?
[00:29:50.928 --> 00:29:54.849]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.849 --> 00:29:57.530]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.414 --> 00:30:05.277]  The future of flawless skin, brought to you by the CIA.
[00:30:05.277 --> 00:30:10.240]  That's right, the CIA is funding a skincare product that collects your DNA.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:18.046]  SkinCentral Sciences is a company with an innovative line of cosmetic products marketed as a way to erase blemishes and soften skin.
[00:30:18.046 --> 00:30:28.654]  Via patented technology, a thin outer layer of the skin is removed, revealing unique biomarkers that can be used for a variety of diagnostic tests, including DNA collection.
[00:30:28.894 --> 00:30:36.680]  According to The Intercept, the skincare startup has attracted interest and funding from In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:44.986]  In-Q-Tel provides venture funding to help grow tech firms that develop the technology that will support the mission of the CIA and other intelligence agencies.
[00:30:44.986 --> 00:30:54.573]  The CIA fund approached the company saying the fund shares an interest in looking at DNA extraction using the method pioneered by SkinCentral Sciences.

[00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:13.671]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:13.671 --> 00:33:17.833]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:32.722 --> 00:33:36.363]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't get up here and say all these things to have a sensational show.
[00:33:36.363 --> 00:33:38.663]  Believe me, reality is sensational.
[00:33:38.663 --> 00:33:42.584]  Reality is dangerous, it's crazy, it's real.
[00:33:42.584 --> 00:33:51.266]  And I never imagined 21 years ago, going on air, local access, local radio, I'd be here with tens of millions of people every week, conservatively.
[00:33:51.266 --> 00:33:53.586]  Way more than that, it's ridiculous.
[00:33:53.586 --> 00:33:54.747]  Tuning in all over the world.
[00:33:54.747 --> 00:34:01.628]  But the good news is, the facts we're covering are what the real insiders, good and bad, know is going on.
[00:34:02.443 --> 00:34:11.050]  The elite have been so arrogant for decades, they've admitted so much of their plan so their own people could understand it, thinking you'd never go look it up.
[00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:14.693]  Well, we've been making preparations to resist, to slow this down.
[00:34:14.693 --> 00:34:18.536]  It's over 15 years behind, most experts agree, but now they're accelerating.
[00:34:18.536 --> 00:34:23.280]  We're going to talk to Mr. Rawls about where this system of betrayal is going.
[00:34:24.309 --> 00:34:32.251]  The caliphate they're setting up, clearly the elite are allied with radical Islam, turning it loose to take over the rest of Islam, and to bring it into our countries.
[00:34:32.251 --> 00:34:33.351]  That's happening.
[00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:34.992]  That's one area I underestimated.
[00:34:34.992 --> 00:34:43.114]  It's so bold, it's so over the top, that I would hear people like Rawls saying this 10 years ago, and I thought, yeah, I could see that down the road, but, you know, not in 10, 20 years.
[00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:45.274]  Well, it's happening quicker.
[00:34:45.274 --> 00:34:50.136]  So, I gotta say that we're gonna really be focusing on this a lot, obviously.
[00:34:50.136 --> 00:34:51.136]  Before I go any further,
[00:34:52.230 --> 00:35:00.017]  The soils, as you know, are depleted in most areas, so a lot of the food you eat, a lot of the vegetables you eat, just don't have the trace elements, all the different vitamins and minerals you need.
[00:35:00.017 --> 00:35:18.312]  We've developed, with our research at InfoWarsLife.com, an amazingly concentrated, strong system with all the minerals, all the vitamins, the amino acids, you name it, in the newest product, Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multivitamin Formulation at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:35:19.366 --> 00:35:22.147]  And this is just a super product.
[00:35:22.147 --> 00:35:27.808]  It's so good for yourself, for your children, for your husband, your wife.
[00:35:27.808 --> 00:35:29.189]  It's such a great gift to give.
[00:35:29.189 --> 00:35:34.370]  Old people, most of them have absorption problems because of all the, you know, how dead their gut is.
[00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:37.571]  Get your grandparents, get your parents on a good probiotic.
[00:35:37.571 --> 00:35:41.452]  Get them on something like Vitamin Mineral Fusion and
[00:35:42.768 --> 00:35:44.269]  Watch what happens.
[00:35:44.269 --> 00:35:48.933]  The amount of energy I get from this is incredible, and it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:35:48.933 --> 00:36:02.623]  It's just that it is from plant-derived, highest quality sources, and there's only a few things in here that are laboratory produced, and those are of the highest quality and of the highest standards, absolutely pure.
[00:36:03.993 --> 00:36:04.993]  It's an amazing product.
[00:36:04.993 --> 00:36:09.555]  Two plus years, I could have gone and gotten hundreds of products, private labeled, had them super cheap, rolled them out.
[00:36:09.555 --> 00:36:13.896]  Yeah, they'd be pretty good, but I wanted to be able to say, this is the best we could come up with.
[00:36:13.896 --> 00:36:14.817]  It's a game changer.
[00:36:14.817 --> 00:36:18.758]  This is so good, we're gonna probably end up putting this in stores, you name it.
[00:36:18.758 --> 00:36:20.839]  Because, I mean, this is just over the top.
[00:36:21.619 --> 00:36:28.705]  Over the top, we use one of the biggest producers of organic, high quality, natural supplements out there to produce this.
[00:36:28.705 --> 00:36:30.366]  We're going to be talking about that in the future.
[00:36:30.366 --> 00:36:32.087]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:36:32.087 --> 00:36:35.870]  And I have a glass at lunch every day.
[00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:39.533]  My children, I get them to drink it in the morning before they go to school.
[00:36:39.533 --> 00:36:40.474]  They absolutely love it.
[00:36:40.474 --> 00:36:41.895]  It's fruit punch flavor.
[00:36:41.895 --> 00:36:42.615]  You can sign up.

[00:36:56.475 --> 00:37:03.438]  And then the sub-session for the nutraceuticals, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:03.438 --> 00:37:06.420]  And I also promote the Longevity line because their products are excellent.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.762]  You can find all those products and your purchase there helps fund our operation at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[00:37:12.409 --> 00:37:21.258]  CoreInfoWorksTeam.com, but find Vitamin Mineral Fusion, AnthroPlex, by the way, is about to sell out, Survival Shield Nation Iodine X2, Super Melon Super Female Vitality, and more.
[00:37:21.258 --> 00:37:21.498]  And look,
[00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:33.032]  All we do is go out and go to the most known for thousands of years herbs for male vitality, female vitality, concentrate them in a proprietary process and sell that.

[00:37:42.954 --> 00:37:45.075]  Other stuff will have like two or three ingredients and some alcohol.
[00:37:45.655 --> 00:37:46.616]  This is oil, folks.
[00:37:46.616 --> 00:37:48.738]  Only problem is the sprayer gets clogged quite a bit.
[00:37:48.738 --> 00:37:54.722]  You gotta put it under hot water and wash it out a lot because it's just such an incredible essential oil.
[00:37:54.722 --> 00:37:55.763]  Check out all the products.
[00:37:55.763 --> 00:37:59.886]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[00:37:59.886 --> 00:38:06.552]  And things are getting so serious that I myself am redoubling my efforts to have basic medical equipment.
[00:38:07.751 --> 00:38:13.296]  Firearms, ammunition, going out shooting, an area in the country that's safer to get to.
[00:38:13.296 --> 00:38:15.978]  I hope it doesn't get to that, but the depression's here.
[00:38:15.978 --> 00:38:16.899]  It's going to get worse.
[00:38:16.899 --> 00:38:18.660]  Society's already unraveling.
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.081]  The police state isn't going to save us.
[00:38:20.081 --> 00:38:23.944]  We're going to talk about preparedness with Mr. Rawls as well coming up.
[00:38:23.944 --> 00:38:26.466]  Survivalblog.com.
[00:38:26.466 --> 00:38:27.888]  Again, formerly with Army Intelligence.
[00:38:27.888 --> 00:38:31.431]  And of course, nobody in the Army ever brags about the stuff they did, but I ran into a colonel.
[00:38:32.745 --> 00:38:32.965]  I don't
[00:38:50.578 --> 00:38:55.420]  I was out in the courthouse taking care of something, and he was saying, oh, you know, Rawls used to work for me, he's a great guy.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.601]  So I had three different people who tuned into the show.
[00:38:58.601 --> 00:39:04.203]  He was talking about the great stuff Mr. Rawls has done for America, which we'll never hear about, you know, the quiet professionals.
[00:39:04.203 --> 00:39:06.884]  But he just really knows what he's talking about, and we love having him on.
[00:39:06.884 --> 00:39:11.645]  I want to get into the Caliphate, your latest novel, which is a smart way to educate people, obviously.
[00:39:11.645 --> 00:39:17.447]  They seem to listen to stuff that's fiction, even though it's real, versus stuff that's real, they seem to ignore it.
[00:39:17.447 --> 00:39:18.808]  But we'll talk about that as well.
[00:39:20.308 --> 00:39:23.729]  Survival, the economy, where you think Obama's going, the rest of it.
[00:39:23.729 --> 00:39:34.813]  But as we went to break, Mr. Rawls, you brought up the situation with the age of deception, the age of betrayal.
[00:39:34.813 --> 00:39:36.414]  Is this the beginning of the fall?
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.321]  Why are they so naked now?
[00:39:39.321 --> 00:39:40.803]  What do you think of Donald Trump?
[00:39:53.332 --> 00:39:55.273]  He was against Naftan Gantt 20 years ago.
[00:39:55.273 --> 00:39:56.233]  He is a nationalist.
[00:39:56.233 --> 00:40:02.674]  I know people that know him before he ever ran for office that said, oh, you didn't know Donald Trump's anti-New World Order?
[00:40:02.674 --> 00:40:08.876]  And so all this clicked for me about six, seven months ago that they're scared of him for some reason.
[00:40:08.876 --> 00:40:10.536]  This couldn't be a foil.
[00:40:10.536 --> 00:40:12.037]  This couldn't be a double cross, could it?
[00:40:12.737 --> 00:40:14.499]  But I want your real view on that as well.
[00:40:14.499 --> 00:40:24.809]  But let's get into the age of betrayal, the age of deception, where you think the world is right now, and then into this election and into the caliphate.
[00:40:24.809 --> 00:40:34.459]  Well, Alex, I think that Donald Trump, I think, is popular because he represents, at least, an outsider to the political system.
[00:40:34.459 --> 00:40:36.201]  And people are definitely fed up
[00:40:36.866 --> 00:40:43.167]  With insider after insider after insider being offered up as candidates.
[00:40:43.167 --> 00:41:00.291]  And while I don't think Donald Trump is a perfect candidate, I think that he at least resonates with a lot of people as representing old school American nationalism, national sovereignty.
[00:41:01.831 --> 00:41:08.154]  And as a counterbalance to the forces of international banking.
[00:41:08.154 --> 00:41:16.657]  Now unfortunately he has some compromises in his background that make him kind of suspect.
[00:41:17.518 --> 00:41:26.767]  Because of actually connections to the Clintons of all people and his many business connections with the bankers.
[00:41:26.767 --> 00:41:32.393]  So I find it really difficult to believe that he's a true outsider.
[00:41:32.393 --> 00:41:36.837]  But he certainly represents more of an outsider than Trump.
[00:41:37.973 --> 00:41:42.357]  Then certainly Hillary or Sanders.
[00:41:42.357 --> 00:41:53.989]  Let me ask you this then, the all hands on deck scenario, and I agree with what you just said, the all hands on deck scenario from the communist Chinese government, the Mexican government, the former president, the British government, the Pope, to you name it,
[00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:57.712]  Every magazine, every newspaper coming out against him.
[00:41:57.712 --> 00:42:04.456]  I see real hysteria and real hate and real concern and the big billionaires getting together and giving hundreds of millions to beat him.
[00:42:04.456 --> 00:42:14.024]  I see that as them legitimately hitting the panic button because they see the nationalism he's saying, even if he's not really a good guy, is irrevocable damage to them.
[00:42:14.024 --> 00:42:22.550]  But it also shows how arrogant they are to think we can have all these foreign governments lecture us how deep into globalist colonialism we really are.
[00:42:24.343 --> 00:42:36.718]  Yeah, the amount of vitriol that's being directed against him is evidence that the powers that be are feeling very nervous, very anxious.
[00:42:36.718 --> 00:42:38.099]  They're losing control.
[00:42:39.366 --> 00:42:52.932]  of the political process because for years and years we've had political party A versus political party B and lo and behold the candidates for both of those parties have been insiders.
[00:42:52.932 --> 00:43:01.615]  They've all been CFR or trilateral commission related individuals.
[00:43:01.615 --> 00:43:07.078]  Every time we've been given a so-called choice on the ballot that really isn't a choice.
[00:43:07.078 --> 00:43:07.398]  It's either
[00:43:08.456 --> 00:43:23.948]  Political Insider A or Political Insider B. And for them to see Trump on the horizon is truly, truly frightening to them to see anything outside of their stage managed operation.
[00:43:23.948 --> 00:43:28.411]  So we're seeing a de facto response to populism, whether he be real or not.
[00:43:28.411 --> 00:43:32.674]  It's kind of like, you know, putting up a fake owl to scare away crows.
[00:43:32.674 --> 00:43:34.215]  They just see an owl and are upset.
[00:43:34.215 --> 00:43:35.476]  They don't know if it's real or not.
[00:43:35.476 --> 00:43:37.618]  They're trying to figure out if it's real, but it scares them.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.663]  Yes, that's essentially it.
[00:43:42.663 --> 00:44:00.274]  The folks that want to control the whole game, really, they want to control us economically, politically, in every sphere, basically, look at people like Donald Trump as wild cards.
[00:44:00.274 --> 00:44:05.997]  And because he's outside of their control, and he is unpredictable,
[00:44:09.398 --> 00:44:12.040]  It really throws a monkey wrench into their plans.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.603]  Do you think he realizes how much danger he's in?
[00:44:15.603 --> 00:44:17.944]  Probably not.
[00:44:17.944 --> 00:44:21.687]  Anyone who goes up against Hillary Clinton ought to be really, really worried.
[00:44:24.268 --> 00:44:33.677]  His chances of making it at body temperature to the election, I would say, are actually fairly small.
[00:44:33.677 --> 00:44:44.507]  I would not be surprised to see that he mysteriously dies of an aneurysm or a heart attack or, you know, something, anything.
[00:44:47.834 --> 00:44:51.417]  The chances of him making the election, I think, are small.
[00:44:51.417 --> 00:44:55.499]  If he truly is the threat that they think he is.
[00:44:55.499 --> 00:45:08.188]  Have you ever, in your decades of being politically involved, 30 years or so since you got out of the army, have you ever, Mr. Rawls, James Wesley Rawls from survivalblog.com, joining us, one of the top, most respected survivalists and global security experts out there.
[00:45:09.104 --> 00:45:11.206]  I mean, not just with the general public, but with the Pentagon, you name it.
[00:45:11.206 --> 00:45:12.908]  Everybody really respects him, and I know.
[00:45:12.908 --> 00:45:16.332]  Have you ever seen a more dangerous time, not just for America, but the world?
[00:45:16.332 --> 00:45:19.595]  I mean, this is just, for me, looking at this, this is unprecedented.
[00:45:19.595 --> 00:45:27.184]  The amount of dominoes lined up, the amount of triggers being thrown, the elite scurrying around building armored redoubts.
[00:45:27.184 --> 00:45:31.088]  I mean, government all over the world is acting like something big is coming.
[00:45:32.208 --> 00:45:41.795]  It's truly unprecedented, because if you look at the mountain of debt and the scale of the derivatives that have built up, that's one huge threat.
[00:45:41.795 --> 00:45:55.585]  And meanwhile, geopolitically, we see a regional war in Syria that could very well blow up into World War III, and we see tension in the South China Sea, which could very well blow up into another world war.
[00:45:55.585 --> 00:45:58.147]  We are truly in uncharted waters here.
[00:45:58.147 --> 00:46:00.709]  We have a situation that
[00:46:02.082 --> 00:46:16.694]  Where the global economy is teetering on the brink, we have the central banks are right now in the process of going to sub-zero interest rates, which is an absolute panic move.
[00:46:16.694 --> 00:46:20.398]  They have basically run out of ammunition in the economic war.
[00:46:20.398 --> 00:46:25.062]  That's like injecting adrenaline directly into the heart.
[00:46:25.062 --> 00:46:26.182]  Yeah, I think that...
[00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:41.596]  At this point, we are teetering on the brink of either economic collapse or global war as kind of the final option for the insiders to have their way.
[00:46:41.596 --> 00:46:46.318]  Because without either of those, we're just simply going to see the truth come out.
[00:46:46.318 --> 00:46:50.600]  What's happened with the Panama Papers, I think, is just one little glimpse
[00:46:51.898 --> 00:47:00.446]  Of the extent of the international financial web that exists.
[00:47:00.446 --> 00:47:05.911]  Well, from what I've seen, it looks like it's a Western attempt to just go after Putin, and certainly Putin's involved in a bunch of this stuff.
[00:47:05.911 --> 00:47:09.154]  But it seems selective to some mid-level networks.
[00:47:09.154 --> 00:47:11.056]  Highly selective, yes.
[00:47:11.056 --> 00:47:13.398]  And if you'll notice, they're mainly pointing the finger at
[00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:31.441]  Uh, African dictators, for example, with these, uh, these trust arrangements with, you know, bearer number one or bearer number two, for example, as the beneficiaries.
[00:47:31.441 --> 00:47:37.085]  The serious money, the big money, is being traded in the hot markets every day.
[00:47:37.085 --> 00:47:39.187]  It's not these tiny little
[00:47:39.867 --> 00:47:42.410]  You know, I say relatively tiny.
[00:47:42.410 --> 00:48:00.750]  These billion-dollar trusts that are being set up to benefit the children of Middle Eastern and African dictators are small change compared to the trillions of dollars that are flowing internationally
[00:48:01.471 --> 00:48:05.273]  The manipulation that's going on in the currency markets.
[00:48:05.273 --> 00:48:07.534]  You mentioned earlier credit default swaps.
[00:48:07.534 --> 00:48:13.356]  People have no idea about the scope of the derivatives trading that goes on.
[00:48:13.356 --> 00:48:30.864]  A CDS, a credit default swap, is a form of derivative and that is so well refined as a derivative that a movement as small as one-tenth of one percent of an interest rate
[00:48:32.222 --> 00:48:35.544]  Can put a major shockwave through the system.
[00:48:35.544 --> 00:48:49.553]  And unfortunately, the way this derivatives casino has built up, it's so finely tuned that when a big swing does happen where interest rates move a whole percentage point or two percentage points, it's going to absolutely collapse the system.
[00:48:49.553 --> 00:48:51.214]  Well, James, I want to talk triggers with you.
[00:48:51.214 --> 00:48:52.275]  I want to get into Caliphate.
[00:48:52.275 --> 00:48:53.235]  And I just want to go ahead.
[00:48:53.235 --> 00:48:54.616]  I'm going to have you through the whole next hour.
[00:48:54.616 --> 00:48:57.138]  We're going to have reporters on in the fourth hour with David Knight.
[00:48:57.138 --> 00:48:58.659]  He has another guest popping in as well.
[00:48:58.659 --> 00:49:00.180]  But looking at this,
[00:49:02.179 --> 00:49:06.701]  Here's a Telegraph article, China jitters could trigger global market bloodbath, IMF warns.
[00:49:06.701 --> 00:49:17.445]  I love how the very progenitors of this whole scam warn us, and the former head of the Fed that helped give us the derivatives with Clinton, Greenspan, warns us of irrational exuberance.
[00:49:17.445 --> 00:49:25.448]  It's like selling a kid a bag full of crack and giving him a pipe and saying, look out, this might be addicting, but it's just amazing.
[00:49:25.448 --> 00:49:30.970]  But getting back to things I see as problems that nobody talks about it, and I'm not bragging when I say,
[00:49:32.105 --> 00:49:42.159]  One thing that launched our show, unbeknownst to me, like 19 years ago, is I put out some police state films showing the military training for gun confiscation and things domestically.
[00:49:42.159 --> 00:49:46.525]  And then the Army and Marines said, don't watch Alex Jones' videos and don't go to his website.
[00:49:47.606 --> 00:49:50.567]  Man, I suddenly had this huge audience of the military tune in.
[00:49:50.567 --> 00:49:52.127]  What was the establishment thinking?
[00:49:52.127 --> 00:49:56.109]  Because my audience probably quadrupled overnight when they started doing that.
[00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:59.290]  That actually launched us, was them saying, don't go here.
[00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:02.251]  So they seem like they're smart, but they also seem like they're dumb.
[00:50:02.251 --> 00:50:03.531]  Now, I was totally unpolished.
[00:50:03.531 --> 00:50:06.332]  They still are, but knew more than the average person.
[00:50:06.332 --> 00:50:07.652]  So the show got very popular.
[00:50:07.652 --> 00:50:12.854]  I became a source because then all these people started giving me stuff because nobody else would talk about it.
[00:50:13.905 --> 00:50:26.356]  Here we are, 20 years later, and the military listens to the show, foreign governments listen to it, they listen to others like it, but it shows how bad the rest of the media is, is that we're some of the best that's out there, I'm not bragging.
[00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:34.964]  But to know that most of the military is aware of what's going on, says they're not going to go along with the globalist takeover, that's got to really cause a problem.
[00:50:34.964 --> 00:50:40.189]  And I'm not saying I'm behind this, I'm one small part of it, but I'm a gauge because I interface with these people.
[00:50:40.929 --> 00:50:43.913]  On the street, you name it, so I know how awake they are.
[00:50:43.913 --> 00:50:52.163]  Does the establishment realize that they still currently say don't go to m4wars.com and don't go to your site and a bunch of others, as you know.
[00:50:52.163 --> 00:50:56.528]  Don't they understand that's backfiring with the Streisand effect squared?
[00:50:56.528 --> 00:50:59.371]  We'll be back with James Wesley Rawls, survivalblog.com.
[00:50:59.371 --> 00:51:00.553]  I'm Alex Jones with the answer.

[00:54:02.488 --> 00:54:08.291]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.291 --> 00:54:19.417]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:19.417 --> 00:54:26.721]  Okay, we're gonna get back to that point that Mr. Rawls got cut off on as we went to break.
[00:54:26.721 --> 00:54:28.462]  Where I was asking the question about the military.
[00:54:29.759 --> 00:54:32.260]  And I'm not branding them as the heroes or anything.
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:34.780]  These are people that have actually been in the real world on average.
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:35.861]  They know about the corruption.
[00:54:35.861 --> 00:54:37.421]  They know about the system.
[00:54:37.421 --> 00:54:42.302]  And that's always been the problem of dictators or oligarchies, is the security services turning against them.
[00:54:42.302 --> 00:54:44.703]  Now look at Operation Valkyrie and Hitler.
[00:54:44.703 --> 00:54:46.063]  The problem is this is an oligarchy.
[00:54:46.063 --> 00:54:46.883]  It's a whole bunch of people.
[00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:47.703]  It's not one guy.
[00:54:47.703 --> 00:54:50.124]  So we're going to talk about that briefly, start the next hour.
[00:54:50.124 --> 00:54:51.404]  But here's an example.
[00:54:51.404 --> 00:54:52.404]  I get up Saturday.
[00:54:52.404 --> 00:54:58.446]  I see a headline, Muslim woman run over by right-wing nationalist in Molenbeek.
[00:54:59.724 --> 00:55:03.808]  And I read the article from the Daily Mail, and it never says who they are or they've been caught.
[00:55:03.808 --> 00:55:06.111]  I go, that doesn't sound right.
[00:55:06.111 --> 00:55:09.935]  That sounds like a false flag, because the radical Muslims are experts at this.
[00:55:09.935 --> 00:55:16.101]  She runs out, and it looks staged, and jumps in front of the car.
[00:55:16.101 --> 00:55:18.884]  Just like they, you know, staged the dead baby on the beach in Greece and all that.
[00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:22.984]  I go to the comments, everybody's mad thinking we're the ones saying this.
[00:55:22.984 --> 00:55:25.965]  Well, go to our, go to our InfoWars and I'll show you.
[00:55:25.965 --> 00:55:31.468]  Horrific moment, Muslim woman is mowed down by grinning driver who then stops to take picture.
[00:55:31.468 --> 00:55:34.669]  Oh, they changed the headline, look, when this came out, ah!
[00:55:34.669 --> 00:55:41.432]  Now, Breitbart, Molonbeek, far right, hit and run was Muslim on Muslim attack.
[00:55:47.122 --> 00:55:58.550]  A local drunk youth named Mohammed, hit and run by a Muslim woman in Mozambique this week, blamed on far-right anti-Islam demonstrators, was in fact perpetrated by an allegedly drunk local youth named Mohammed.
[00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:06.216]  So, I don't mean to just, you know, divert off, but it's this constant lying, and then saying German men raped the women in Cologne and all this.
[00:56:06.216 --> 00:56:07.737]  They're almost all military-age men.
[00:56:07.737 --> 00:56:08.757]  They invaded Syria.
[00:56:08.757 --> 00:56:09.398]  They're coming in.
[00:56:10.922 --> 00:56:14.564]  Now Europe's bringing him, and we're going to talk about that at the start of the next hour with Mr. Rawls.
[00:56:14.564 --> 00:56:25.150]  But the time we have, sir, in this short segment, getting back to you in the next four minutes, specifically with my military question, what are they thinking when they say, don't visit patriot sites?
[00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:27.712]  Don't, you know, George Washington's bad.
[00:56:27.712 --> 00:56:28.993]  The founding fathers are bad.
[00:56:28.993 --> 00:56:31.534]  They actually, as you know, teach the military that.
[00:56:31.534 --> 00:56:33.375]  That's actually woken the military up.
[00:56:33.375 --> 00:56:34.356]  What are the globalists thinking?
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:40.653]  Well, they're hoping that they can control the military, but the problem is...
[00:56:42.502 --> 00:56:57.374]  Even with a dumbed-down electorate, a dumbed-down populace that's reaching military age, even with that, people still have basic common sense and they can see what's going on in the world around them.
[00:56:57.374 --> 00:56:58.875]  They get curious.
[00:56:58.875 --> 00:57:00.497]  They now turn to the Internet.
[00:57:00.497 --> 00:57:05.981]  It used to be newsletters and magazines and that sort of thing, but they turn to the Internet to seek the truth.
[00:57:08.683 --> 00:57:23.389]  They're hoping that they can control access to that knowledge, to keep that knowledge out of the hands of the people that they want to have as their foot soldiers.
[00:57:23.389 --> 00:57:24.729]  It's not working.
[00:57:24.729 --> 00:57:35.994]  They tried firewalling more than a thousand Patriot websites at the Pentagon two years ago, and there was a quiet rebellion that went on.
[00:57:37.142 --> 00:57:55.967]  Where, at first, people were saying, well, you can't firewall us, or if you firewall us, only firewall us during working hours, but we want to have unlimited internet access before working hours, on our lunch hour, and after work.
[00:57:55.967 --> 00:58:00.388]  And the IT staff at the Pentagon backed down.
[00:58:00.388 --> 00:58:01.529]  They actually relented.
[00:58:02.429 --> 00:58:08.494]  Because there were so many people at the Pentagon that were upset about this.
[00:58:08.494 --> 00:58:09.535]  And that's what I'm getting at.
[00:58:09.535 --> 00:58:15.360]  Don't they understand that when they tried to blacklist you and myself and others, that just made everybody come check out what we're saying?
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.282]  They hear we're telling the truth and it backfired, didn't it?
[00:58:18.282 --> 00:58:19.183]  Right.
[00:58:19.183 --> 00:58:24.006]  What happened was people were using VPN, virtual private networks, or
[00:58:24.807 --> 00:58:37.817]  Web surfing from at home or web surfing from wireless networks literally from their mobile devices in the parking lot of the pentagon.
[00:58:37.817 --> 00:58:38.938]  This is so exciting.
[00:58:38.938 --> 00:58:39.579]  Stay there.
[00:58:39.579 --> 00:58:40.039]  Back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:40.039 --> 00:58:42.101]  This is a microcosm of everything.
[00:58:42.101 --> 00:58:43.802]  They're not invincible folks.
[00:58:43.802 --> 00:58:47.625]  The globalists can be defeated if you realize you have the power.
[00:58:47.625 --> 00:58:48.486]  You are the resistance.
[00:58:48.486 --> 00:58:49.126]  Back in 70.
[00:58:49.126 --> 00:58:49.507]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.141 --> 00:58:52.082]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:58:52.082 --> 00:58:52.662]  Good, brother.
[00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:54.603]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:58:54.603 --> 00:58:56.325]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:58:56.325 --> 00:59:00.347]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:59:00.347 --> 00:59:02.969]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:59:02.969 --> 00:59:05.391]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:59:05.391 --> 00:59:13.256]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:59:13.436 --> 00:59:16.820]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.342]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:59:18.342 --> 00:59:21.385]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:59:21.385 --> 00:59:23.027]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:59:23.027 --> 00:59:28.353]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:59:28.353 --> 00:59:31.695]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:14.665 --> 01:00:17.289]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:17.289 --> 01:00:23.757]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:23.757 --> 01:00:29.004]  Alright, coming up...
[01:00:30.137 --> 01:00:36.345]  At about 24 after, we're going to start opening the phones up for the balance of the hour for James Wesley Rawls, our guest.
[01:00:36.345 --> 01:00:39.869]  Also want to hit a bunch of other news items with him and get his take on it.
[01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:41.070]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:00:45.111 --> 01:00:45.271]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:45.271 --> 01:00:47.853]  That was a short segment.
[01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:48.894]  This is a short segment.
[01:00:48.894 --> 01:01:00.983]  In the long segment, we're going to get into the Caliphate, his latest novel, and what the next big shooter drop in his brain is with the man that heads up SurvivalBlog.com, James Wesley Rawls.
[01:01:00.983 --> 01:01:05.847]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:05.847 --> 01:01:08.889]  But getting back to what you were just saying, to me this is key because
[01:01:10.029 --> 01:01:12.411]  I used to get mad at police and some of the police state stuff.
[01:01:12.411 --> 01:01:15.913]  I realize that's what they're being trained to do is we should change it above them.
[01:01:15.913 --> 01:01:17.534]  That's our political job.
[01:01:17.534 --> 01:01:21.796]  But on average, cops tend to be more awake to the general public.
[01:01:21.796 --> 01:01:28.380]  And some jurisdictions are very corrupt, but others are pretty good folks overall.
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:33.103]  And so that's why you've got the Black Lives Matter, the UN Strong Cities Initiative coming in to take over.
[01:01:33.103 --> 01:01:33.944]  I mean, it's actually happening.
[01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:39.136]  And so we also have the military even more awake.
[01:01:39.136 --> 01:01:43.320]  So they're saying the number one domestic enemy will be returning veterans and gun owners.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:49.847]  Well, that woke up military training to take on domestic terrorists who they're being taught are themselves.
[01:01:49.847 --> 01:01:51.789]  So there's a major disconnect in the elites.
[01:01:51.789 --> 01:01:55.493]  And if they would have disconnects, like not realizing when you tell
[01:01:57.259 --> 01:02:03.264]  Marines and Army troops on bases across the country don't go to InfoWars.com, but they're all going to go to InfoWars.com.
[01:02:03.264 --> 01:02:13.752]  Or, when they get up there and bad-mount the founders and Christians and gun owners and make the men wear red high-heeled shoes, that it's not demoralizing them, it's turning them against their controllers.
[01:02:14.312 --> 01:02:21.678]  I mean, you take a bunch of socialist engineers, give them ROTC merit, give them an officer's commission, stick them in the military.
[01:02:21.678 --> 01:02:24.221]  It's so alien, they've caused a total wake-up.
[01:02:24.221 --> 01:02:26.883]  I mean, I really see this as one of the biggest missteps ever.
[01:02:26.883 --> 01:02:28.604]  Go ahead, sir, and give me your view on that.
[01:02:28.604 --> 01:02:37.072]  We are in a situation where the controllers are losing control.
[01:02:38.598 --> 01:02:46.770]  Because there's so many different channels of media now available, they basically can't stop the signal.
[01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:48.553]  The truth is out there.
[01:02:48.553 --> 01:02:53.680]  It's people like you and bloggers and podcasters.
[01:02:55.083 --> 01:03:02.107]  And journalists, non-mainstream journalists, who are waking people up to the truth.
[01:03:02.107 --> 01:03:06.090]  A lot of those people are in military organizations.
[01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:12.673]  They're people, as I mentioned before, at the Pentagon, for example.
[01:03:12.673 --> 01:03:15.935]  People who are on general staffs.
[01:03:15.935 --> 01:03:18.537]  People who are in military intelligence.
[01:03:18.537 --> 01:03:19.778]  And most people don't realize that
[01:03:20.699 --> 01:03:25.999]  There's as many people in military intelligence with the different military services as there are
[01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:32.192]  With the CIA and the NSA and the NRO, for example.
[01:03:32.192 --> 01:03:55.679]  There is, from my sources, I'm not saying they're perfectly good, but the army groups and others are basically battling the foreign interests that have come in and taken over the CIA, and there's been a decades-long war now emerging, where more and more army officers are even able to go on air now and actively badmouth the corrupt system, which, for folks that don't know, is basically mutiny, but it's not mutiny because the military realizes the country's now been captured.
[01:03:56.553 --> 01:03:57.854]  Right.
[01:03:57.854 --> 01:04:06.858]  There's definitely different competing camps within the intelligence agencies and within the military.
[01:04:06.858 --> 01:04:14.022]  A lot of the really conservative, libertarian, and freedom-minded
[01:04:15.513 --> 01:04:23.676]  General officers were purged during the seven years of the Obama administration.
[01:04:23.676 --> 01:04:36.941]  But there's still a lot of people in the enlisted ranks, warrant officers, junior officers, and up into the field grade officers who have a concept of American liberty.
[01:04:36.941 --> 01:04:39.181]  And they cannot quench that.
[01:04:39.181 --> 01:04:39.742]  They can't just
[01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:43.795]  They just can't put that fire out.
[01:04:43.795 --> 01:04:44.616]  This is the key to everything.
[01:04:44.616 --> 01:04:44.976]  Stay there.
[01:04:44.976 --> 01:04:46.818]  I want you to come back and speak to this at length.
[01:04:46.818 --> 01:04:47.959]  Then get into the Caliphate.
[01:04:47.959 --> 01:04:49.041]  Survivalblog.com.
[01:04:49.041 --> 01:04:50.542]  This is the key.
[01:04:50.542 --> 01:04:57.289]  They've already decapitated the federal government and brought in their operatives, but the people that actually run the military are still there and they're awake now.
[01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:58.130]  This is a key time.
[01:05:01.187 --> 01:05:09.012]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com and I'm here to report UT Chattanooga student senator pressured to resign over pro-Trump chalking.
[01:05:09.012 --> 01:05:10.333]  Yeah, you heard that right.
[01:05:10.333 --> 01:05:17.117]  Some kid is going to have to resign from their student senate spot over chalking and showing support for a candidate.
[01:05:17.117 --> 01:05:19.579]  A candidate that's not Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton.
[01:05:19.579 --> 01:05:21.580]  An evil, scum-sucking succubus.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:32.668]  A student senator-elect at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga has been asked to resign by members of her own campaign ticket for participating in drawing pro-Trump images in chalk on campus.
[01:05:32.668 --> 01:05:38.131]  Hasn't Chattanooga gone through enough already this year with the terrorist attack at the recruiting station?
[01:05:38.131 --> 01:05:41.174]  You're already not allowing our soldiers to defend themselves.
[01:05:41.174 --> 01:05:45.216]  Now you're not even allowing us to use our First Amendment rights!
[01:05:45.216 --> 01:05:47.178]  You can't even defend the Constitution!
[01:05:47.178 --> 01:05:48.779]  What is the point of college anymore?
[01:05:48.939 --> 01:05:50.159]  It's not for you to feel safe.
[01:05:50.159 --> 01:05:51.420]  You guys are a joke!
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.540]  What happened to America?
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:55.820]  What happened to what it is I fought for in Iraq and Afghanistan?
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:06:00.921]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com, and these students are really pissing me off.
[01:06:00.921 --> 01:06:01.742]  Hey, everyone.
[01:06:01.742 --> 01:06:04.022]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:06:04.022 --> 01:06:07.863]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:09.943]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:06:09.943 --> 01:06:18.845]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses
[01:06:18.865 --> 01:06:19.165]  I think?
[01:06:41.223 --> 01:06:41.423]  Thank you.
[01:07:00.811 --> 01:07:09.054]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[01:07:09.054 --> 01:07:10.274]  A 360 win.
[01:07:10.274 --> 01:07:16.836]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:07:16.836 --> 01:07:24.359]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:07:24.779 --> 01:07:29.443]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:07:29.443 --> 01:07:35.949]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:07:35.949 --> 01:07:43.756]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:07:43.756 --> 01:07:50.962]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:07:50.962 --> 01:07:51.763]  10% off on auto ship.
[01:07:51.923 --> 01:07:54.344]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:54.344 --> 01:07:56.344]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:07:56.344 --> 01:08:10.669]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:08:10.669 --> 01:08:13.330]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:16.131]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:08:16.131 --> 01:08:18.672]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:32.826]  About 160 years ago, 165 years ago, the British crown was having trouble expanding and maintaining its empire.
[01:08:32.826 --> 01:08:41.652]  So they financed their top scientists, this is all in books that have been published at the time and since then, to come up with social engineering and social control.
[01:08:41.652 --> 01:08:49.577]  And to develop machines that could track and trace everyone and to develop cultural systems of what they called mind war.
[01:08:51.311 --> 01:08:54.872]  That was actually a British term and then it was picked up by the Germans.
[01:08:54.872 --> 01:09:00.033]  It's what they called psyops or psychological warfare.
[01:09:00.033 --> 01:09:04.094]  But what happens when people in the endgame realize that they're the target of it as well?
[01:09:04.094 --> 01:09:09.696]  You see, globalism isn't just taking over because it's a better system.
[01:09:09.696 --> 01:09:11.697]  That would just take over by adoption.
[01:09:11.697 --> 01:09:12.937]  Free market.
[01:09:12.937 --> 01:09:15.057]  It's taking over to end all competition.
[01:09:15.057 --> 01:09:19.119]  It's taking over to end the family, to end our culture as you know it.
[01:09:19.119 --> 01:09:20.559]  Go read the book, Things to Come.
[01:09:24.508 --> 01:09:27.229]  Go see what the head of the Fabian Socialists said they were going to do.
[01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:31.132]  He wrote more non-fiction books than he wrote fiction.
[01:09:31.132 --> 01:09:34.253]  I've probably read seven or eight non-fiction books by H.G.
[01:09:34.253 --> 01:09:37.235]  Wells, and I'll be honest, I can't read any more of them.
[01:09:37.235 --> 01:09:40.837]  I used to read all their books and stuff and Carol Quigley, and I already know their plan.
[01:09:40.837 --> 01:09:46.980]  It's really scary to actually read them saying it and licking their lips and stuff.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:49.321]  Folks, these people really don't like you, okay?
[01:09:51.283 --> 01:10:01.688]  You need to understand, they're the same people that used the people of Ireland and Scotland and England, who were strong, to build their world tyranny.
[01:10:01.688 --> 01:10:07.371]  They were colonialized by the Romanian and Habsburg, who weren't even really German.
[01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:15.663]  Criminals that had learned how to control the final spice trade coming in out of the Middle East, there in what's Transylvania today.
[01:10:15.663 --> 01:10:20.204]  And they perfected torture and political manipulation and really a lot of bad stuff.
[01:10:20.204 --> 01:10:27.685]  Not that Western Europe was perfect, but they brought all that in, they took over, and God help us, man.
[01:10:27.685 --> 01:10:33.827]  And notice, now the West gets the blame for what these people have used us to build for them.
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.221]  And they're now moving into their endgame.
[01:10:37.221 --> 01:10:40.181]  So here are terms like communist, fascist, socialist, those are all to confuse you.
[01:10:40.181 --> 01:10:46.163]  They're different forms of command and control that the elites want because they can manage command and control because it's centralized.
[01:10:46.163 --> 01:10:47.183]  Read Tragedy and Hope.
[01:10:47.183 --> 01:10:48.784]  We sell the book.
[01:10:48.784 --> 01:10:56.326]  Infowarsstore.com, back in print, written by this guy that published it so the State Department's own people could understand what they're doing.
[01:10:56.326 --> 01:10:59.066]  What, we fund communists and fascists and socialists?
[01:10:59.066 --> 01:11:00.087]  And we want dictators?
[01:11:00.087 --> 01:11:00.787]  We don't want freedom?
[01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:12.393]  It's an 1100-page book explaining to them that none of this means anything, that we're taking over, and that we're the new British Empire, and that we know best, so just do it.
[01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:16.194]  And you'll be taken care of.
[01:11:16.194 --> 01:11:18.535]  They're so arrogant, they published it.
[01:11:18.535 --> 01:11:21.256]  People actually started reading it, though, so they took it out of print.
[01:11:21.256 --> 01:11:22.636]  That's where this goes.
[01:11:22.636 --> 01:11:26.638]  James Wesley Rowles and I are not up here giving you our opinion.
[01:11:26.638 --> 01:11:27.598]  Do you understand that?
[01:11:29.028 --> 01:11:33.309]  The thousands of quotes, the statements, the admissions, it's far worse than I can tell you.
[01:11:33.309 --> 01:11:40.811]  Prince Philip, Prince Charles, constantly talking about how they want to kill everybody and bring in world government to forcibly inoculate you, you know, cancer viruses.
[01:11:40.811 --> 01:11:45.513]  They mean business.
[01:11:45.513 --> 01:11:47.613]  They mean business.
[01:11:47.613 --> 01:11:50.334]  And the fact that some whacked out Transylvanian royalty
[01:11:52.386 --> 01:11:55.950]  He wants a world government to run your life.
[01:11:55.950 --> 01:12:00.075]  And they're always, you know what, they're always digging up on the castle properties and the rest of it.
[01:12:00.075 --> 01:12:00.755]  Little kids.
[01:12:00.755 --> 01:12:03.699]  I mean, folks, you cannot make up how evil these people are.
[01:12:03.699 --> 01:12:05.180]  I'm going to stop right there.
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:06.562]  But again, it's legends.
[01:12:06.562 --> 01:12:08.164]  They're not physical vampires.
[01:12:09.087 --> 01:12:11.728]  They're a bloodline of psychotics.
[01:12:11.728 --> 01:12:12.949]  And they're not even running the show.
[01:12:12.949 --> 01:12:16.270]  They just kicked off and funded science.
[01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:19.271]  You know, there was major science in the 1850s, folks.
[01:12:19.271 --> 01:12:21.052]  They focused on the science of control.
[01:12:21.052 --> 01:12:22.032]  And this has been copied.
[01:12:22.032 --> 01:12:23.073]  It's been exported.
[01:12:23.073 --> 01:12:24.013]  It's been refined.
[01:12:24.013 --> 01:12:25.094]  There's all these new systems.
[01:12:25.094 --> 01:12:25.794]  I'm ranting.
[01:12:25.794 --> 01:12:27.175]  I'm gonna go back to our guest.
[01:12:27.175 --> 01:12:28.755]  You should understand what we face.
[01:12:28.755 --> 01:12:29.876]  The terms you want to know
[01:12:31.252 --> 01:12:44.865]  Is the fact that globalism is really totally corrupt scientific colonialism by multinational mega banks and institutions that are above the law and are the new royalty.
[01:12:44.865 --> 01:12:47.107]  With the power to tax but are exempt from it.
[01:12:47.107 --> 01:12:49.069]  Letter of Mark given to their operatives.
[01:12:49.069 --> 01:12:51.631]  They're mercenaries.
[01:12:51.631 --> 01:12:56.876]  And they're reversing the Western invasion where they say you're going to be put on a ship or we're going to kill you.
[01:12:58.632 --> 01:13:04.613]  I mean, you think it was fun when, you know, like the 1600s, more than half of crews died routinely?
[01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:08.114]  Usually about a third on an African or South American voyage.
[01:13:08.114 --> 01:13:11.995]  You think they weren't slaves?
[01:13:11.995 --> 01:13:14.255]  And the West then tried to end slavery.
[01:13:14.255 --> 01:13:17.896]  But within the West was growing this great evil.
[01:13:17.896 --> 01:13:24.117]  And so now you're facing scientific colonialism
[01:13:25.842 --> 01:13:39.185]  At a multinational, above the state level, playing the states off against each other, the individuals against each other, the great game times a thousand, and nested in the heart of this, nested in the core of this.
[01:13:41.785 --> 01:13:58.201]  Then using the giant third world populations with promises of their own colonialism to come to the West and get the free welfare and the free goodies to be brought here to be programmed with liberation theology, hate the West theology and then you conquer the third world and the West by playing them off against each other.
[01:13:59.136 --> 01:14:01.218]  And that is their admitted plan.
[01:14:01.218 --> 01:14:03.159]  You have been given the enemy's blueprint.
[01:14:03.159 --> 01:14:03.960]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:08.142]  Now, Mr. Rawls, I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor now, but I want to set the table here.
[01:14:08.142 --> 01:14:21.532]  Getting back into the military waking up, the bureaucrats waking up, a lot of people understanding now as we near the endgame that the patriots were right the last 60 plus years, from Barry Goldwater up to you and others, warning people.
[01:14:21.532 --> 01:14:23.994]  And so now how does that affect the battle space?
[01:14:23.994 --> 01:14:25.215]  Where does this go?
[01:14:25.215 --> 01:14:26.796]  And why is Islam
[01:14:27.899 --> 01:14:36.944]  As I think you correctly predicted over a decade ago, the secret skeleton key weapon that they're going to use to finish their world government takeover.
[01:14:36.944 --> 01:14:42.686]  Well, Alex, the goal obviously is control.
[01:14:42.686 --> 01:14:45.188]  They want to consolidate power.
[01:14:45.188 --> 01:14:49.850]  They want to institute a global system.
[01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:54.913]  And all the pieces are in place right now to make that happen.
[01:14:54.913 --> 01:14:55.553]  With the Internet,
[01:14:56.391 --> 01:15:10.374]  With the possibility of going cashless for the world currencies and soon to be just a single currency, I think that's definitely their goal.
[01:15:10.374 --> 01:15:18.855]  They have this game plan and they are indeed, just as you said, playing one group off of another to make all this happen.
[01:15:18.855 --> 01:15:21.736]  And as I mentioned at the beginning of the last hour,
[01:15:22.614 --> 01:15:35.322]  The real tool that's being used right now, following the end of the Cold War, is using radical Islam as a pawn.
[01:15:35.322 --> 01:15:43.607]  And as I mentioned before, I think that that pawn may actually be a knight or a queen in hiding.
[01:15:43.607 --> 01:15:49.651]  It's going to turn against them with dramatic results when all is said and done.
[01:15:51.212 --> 01:15:54.214]  We are seeing this all play out.
[01:15:54.214 --> 01:16:04.743]  And the pace at which change is taking place is getting faster and faster and faster.
[01:16:04.743 --> 01:16:07.305]  And they're trying to manipulate this whole game.
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:14.982]  They're keeping people in the dark, they're failing at that, and at this point, it's going to come down to crisis.
[01:16:14.982 --> 01:16:35.188]  Whether it's a global pandemic, whether it's a global economic collapse, or whether it's a global war, they're going to have to play the crisis card very soon, because they basically lost control economically, and they have lost, they don't realize it yet, but they have lost the information war.
[01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:40.852]  People like you have woken up too many people.
[01:16:40.852 --> 01:16:51.818]  And at this point, the only arrow left in their quiver is absolute crisis.
[01:16:51.818 --> 01:16:52.899]  That's right.
[01:16:52.899 --> 01:16:56.781]  And we're now going into it.
[01:16:56.781 --> 01:17:02.044]  Hillary admitted they're losing the information war four years ago to Congress.
[01:17:02.044 --> 01:17:05.246]  But I don't think she even realizes how much they've lost the information war.
[01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:12.418]  Is there any way to get these cornered rats to not destroy everything to keep power?
[01:17:12.418 --> 01:17:33.505]  Couldn't the states get together in a first-run constitutional convention just to have letters of demand and basically tell the top operatives, stop their anti-American activities, don't shut down power plants, don't let China have unfair trade deals, start there, and then give them a year to exit
[01:17:34.659 --> 01:17:44.407]  The United States, I mean, that of course, as you know, as a student of history, Mr. Rawls, has been done before with corrupt elites who are like a cancer and are too hard to dislodge.
[01:17:44.407 --> 01:17:50.612]  I mean, could some type of through-the-system armistice happen and just have these people flake off?
[01:17:51.328 --> 01:17:52.288]  That is possible.
[01:17:52.288 --> 01:18:03.131]  And I think one venue for that may be the upcoming Republican National Convention, because they don't control all of those individual delegates.
[01:18:03.131 --> 01:18:17.294]  And once a party convention is in a lot of ways like a constitutional convention, once the floor is open, if enough people call for
[01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:18.915]  I think?
[01:18:40.319 --> 01:18:50.425]  That's right, because when they engage in this open theft, it is going to be a huge wake-up call on top of the wake-up call that's already happening, and people are really going to see through it.
[01:18:50.425 --> 01:18:56.529]  Do you think it's arrogance overall, or fear that they're just nakedly going, yeah, your vote doesn't count, get used to it, all over TV?
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.741]  Well, the level of arrogance is just horrendous.
[01:19:02.741 --> 01:19:15.984]  To think that they can attempt to stage-manage an entire political convention by manipulating the rules of that convention.
[01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:17.324]  I think it may backfire on them.
[01:19:20.333 --> 01:19:22.234]  A lot of two things are going to happen.
[01:19:22.234 --> 01:19:31.240]  Either there's going to be absolute pandemonium on the floor, or there's going to be a walkout of a lot of delegates.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.922]  They may just walk to a hotel across the street.
[01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:37.592]  And start their own convention.
[01:19:37.592 --> 01:19:38.333]  That's the idea.
[01:19:38.333 --> 01:19:43.420]  I'm going to call Roger Stone right now because obviously his former business partner now is pretty much the head of the campaign.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:46.284]  They've still got Lewandowski over there on the side.
[01:19:46.284 --> 01:19:48.868]  But wow, that is a great idea.
[01:19:48.868 --> 01:19:52.473]  And I kind of think that's what may be actually planned, but it's funny you brought that up.
[01:19:54.659 --> 01:19:57.040]  Well, again, things are spinning out of control.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:07.543]  And at this point, again, I think it's going to come down to a massive crisis of some sort as kind of a last-ditch effort for them to maintain their control.
[01:20:07.543 --> 01:20:11.644]  And as things get more out of control... Sure, sure, as things get more out of control...
[01:20:12.424 --> 01:20:14.145]  It's going to get more out of control and more out of control.
[01:20:14.145 --> 01:20:16.086]  Let's stay on a scale of one to a hundred.
[01:20:16.086 --> 01:20:17.667]  A hundred being the most out of control.
[01:20:17.667 --> 01:20:19.628]  You know, full-on nuclear war happening.
[01:20:19.628 --> 01:20:21.028]  It is total insanity.
[01:20:21.028 --> 01:20:26.391]  And you know, zero being volholic pastoral utopias.
[01:20:26.391 --> 01:20:27.612]  Where are we on that scale, sir?
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:34.764]  Well, I'd say we're somewhere in the 80s or the 90s here right now.
[01:20:34.764 --> 01:20:36.125]  They're losing control.
[01:20:36.125 --> 01:20:54.357]  And at this point, unless they have a crisis that they can use as the excuse to collapse the stock market, cause a banking crisis, and institute a global currency,
[01:20:55.310 --> 01:21:01.512]  They'll need something of that scale to continue to consolidate power.
[01:21:01.512 --> 01:21:04.853]  Otherwise, power is going to slip through their grasp.
[01:21:04.853 --> 01:21:13.116]  And so what you keep hammering is, they're going to pull a crisis, they're going to false flag, or they're going to wind somebody up, and they're going to create a crisis to be the saviors.
[01:21:13.116 --> 01:21:21.258]  It's so huge, it diverts from stealing elections and everything else.
[01:21:21.258 --> 01:21:22.719]  Yeah, they'll probably have a
[01:21:23.993 --> 01:21:24.293]  Okay.
[01:21:41.262 --> 01:21:48.770]  Of a key political figure or a key candidate that they'll then try to pin on the Patriot movement, for example.
[01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:49.271]  That's right.
[01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:54.156]  So they could false flag and kill Donald Trump and blame it on the Patriots, or they could do it to Obama.
[01:21:54.156 --> 01:22:00.242]  That's what my gut's been telling me is we're entering the season of a political assassination to be pinned on one group or the other.
[01:22:00.242 --> 01:22:02.204]  It won't matter if it ever gets proven.
[01:22:02.204 --> 01:22:03.625]  It'll just cause war on the streets.
[01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:09.735]  Yes, and there literally will be blood in the streets if that happens.
[01:22:09.735 --> 01:22:24.021]  And again, getting back to the political conventions, the party conventions, coming out of the Democratic Convention or more likely out of the Republican Convention, we could see a huge uproar, especially if they attempt to
[01:22:26.118 --> 01:22:36.564]  To broker this convention and put an insider in, in place of one of the two perceived outsiders.
[01:22:36.564 --> 01:22:40.306]  And that's the only way, I mean look, I'll be honest, I don't want to scare people.
[01:22:41.932 --> 01:22:57.994]  They could do stuff like a low-yield nuke in Cleveland and then, you know, have Obama declare a civil emergency saying, you know, in a year now we're going to have an election and then basically, I mean, all the preparations I see is if they're planning something humongous and I don't want to...
[01:22:58.354 --> 01:23:03.816]  Speculate here, but I said before 9-11, look for him to blow up the World Trade Centers and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[01:23:03.816 --> 01:23:06.176]  I'm not saying there isn't radical Islam, and obviously Saudi Arabia.
[01:23:06.176 --> 01:23:15.299]  28 pages, I was just saying, I could see the preparation, I could see them beta testing, I could see them getting everybody ready, and then I called it exactly as they did it.
[01:23:15.299 --> 01:23:17.920]  And I'm telling you, I've never seen such frightening rhetoric.
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:22.921]  Obama's hyping nuclear terror, everybody else is, saying, oh, mushroom cloud over Manhattan.
[01:23:24.873 --> 01:23:32.861]  In your gut and your sources, what are some of the false flag triggers you think that activating the ISIS Al Qaeda sleeper cells they have all over the U.S.?
[01:23:32.861 --> 01:23:34.763]  What do you think it could be?
[01:23:34.763 --> 01:23:43.152]  It could very well be ISIS here in the United States or another major event in Europe.
[01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:48.765]  But I think they, at this point, see the need to step things up a notch.
[01:23:48.765 --> 01:23:56.010]  So it won't just be guys pulling out AK-47s and hand grenades and shouting, Allahu Akbar.
[01:23:56.010 --> 01:24:05.737]  It's going to be more like nuclear dirty bombs or even nuclear devices that reach critical mass, actual nuclear weapons.
[01:24:06.886 --> 01:24:17.373]  Or biological warfare agents or massive use of chemical agents in a confined but heavily populated space.
[01:24:17.373 --> 01:24:22.077]  And by that I mean something like a subway or a stadium full of people.
[01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:26.442]  Where there wouldn't just be dozens of deaths or hundreds of deaths.
[01:24:26.442 --> 01:24:29.806]  There could be thousands of simultaneous deaths.
[01:24:29.806 --> 01:24:36.794]  And that is the level they want to step things up to that level.
[01:24:36.794 --> 01:24:41.640]  Because it's only out of that level of crisis that they can call for something like martial law.
[01:24:44.099 --> 01:24:48.980]  Wow, and they've already got, quote, civil emergencies in Germany and France suspending people's rights.
[01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:50.661]  It's amazing.
[01:24:50.661 --> 01:24:51.501]  What do we do?
[01:24:51.501 --> 01:24:53.182]  I mean, I guess we call mainstream media.
[01:24:53.182 --> 01:24:54.622]  We do our own shows.
[01:24:54.622 --> 01:24:55.743]  Everybody does videos.
[01:24:55.743 --> 01:24:59.644]  Everybody becomes their own activist and says, we don't want nuclear terror.
[01:24:59.644 --> 01:25:04.525]  If there's nuclear Islamic terror, we hold you responsible, Mr. President.
[01:25:04.525 --> 01:25:06.726]  You know, we know you're cooking something.
[01:25:07.766 --> 01:25:09.847]  Hey Ugly, we know you're cooking.
[01:25:09.847 --> 01:25:14.989]  Don't cook it up for me to reverse what Hank Williams said.
[01:25:14.989 --> 01:25:18.010]  What do we do to stop it?
[01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:24.233]  I really don't know an ideal solution other than to continue to wake people up.
[01:25:25.248 --> 01:25:28.870]  And encourage people to not give up completely on the political process.
[01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:38.536]  I hear so many people who say, it's all over, we can't do anything, no matter who gets into office they're going to pack the Supreme Court, blah blah blah.
[01:25:38.536 --> 01:25:41.377]  No, I think there still is hope for the political process.
[01:25:41.377 --> 01:25:51.663]  So people need to be aware, they need to be politically active, they need to be incredibly vocal, and don't be buffaloed.
[01:25:51.663 --> 01:25:52.904]  There's going to be a lot of
[01:25:54.892 --> 01:26:03.756]  of changes going on in our country in the next five years where they're going to use hate speech laws to try to silence people.
[01:26:03.756 --> 01:26:04.076]  I agree.
[01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:08.257]  I want to talk about that next because the answer is everybody use your speech or lose it.
[01:26:08.257 --> 01:26:10.678]  They're openly announcing it and I want to come back and go to calls.
[01:26:10.678 --> 01:26:11.399]  Right.
[01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:14.100]  But separately, James Wesley Rawls, SurvivalBlog.com.
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:22.303]  Again, joining us here, if you just tuned in, I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com, syndicated radio slash TV transmission every day, 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:26:22.303 --> 01:26:22.563]  Eastern.
[01:26:23.795 --> 01:26:37.893]  Looking at this and looking at the different things that they're pulling, I also think it's important to reach out to some of the bots and some of the mainline liberals who come out to protest Trump and wants to actually talk to Trump supporters.
[01:26:37.893 --> 01:26:40.235]  I see a lot of videos where people are actually coming together.
[01:26:40.235 --> 01:26:41.717]  That's not getting a lot of coverage in the media.
[01:26:42.318 --> 01:26:42.478]  Yeah.
[01:27:04.265 --> 01:27:26.880]  If their goal is to divide groups, and the groups throw that back in their face by actually showing some cohesiveness and a unity of voice saying, yes, we want less government, we want less control, we want more individual freedom, that's going to really throw a monkey wrench into their plans.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.622]  They want to continue to divide and conquer, and if we
[01:27:32.745 --> 01:27:39.349]  Can actually find some common ground with people on the other end of the political spectrum.
[01:27:39.349 --> 01:27:41.871]  It's going to thwart their plans separately.
[01:27:41.871 --> 01:27:44.693]  You bring up don't give up the political process.
[01:27:46.007 --> 01:27:46.888]  It's become fake.
[01:27:46.888 --> 01:27:47.989]  It's become a fraud.
[01:27:47.989 --> 01:27:50.952]  But as we get involved, we expose the voting machines.
[01:27:50.952 --> 01:27:54.175]  As we run for office, good people get elected.
[01:27:54.175 --> 01:27:54.815]  It's a battle.
[01:27:54.815 --> 01:27:56.117]  We're fighting crooks.
[01:27:56.117 --> 01:28:01.121]  Good men and women always trump them, pun intended, when we finally take action.
[01:28:01.121 --> 01:28:02.022]  It may take 10 years.
[01:28:02.022 --> 01:28:02.803]  It may take 30 years.
[01:28:02.803 --> 01:28:03.924]  It may take six months.
[01:28:03.924 --> 01:28:05.105]  You never know how it's going to work.
[01:28:05.105 --> 01:28:06.526]  We have the moral high ground.
[01:28:06.526 --> 01:28:09.649]  And by going there and forcing them to steal the nomination,
[01:28:10.530 --> 01:28:12.550]  That only accelerates the awakening.
[01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:15.211]  People think, oh, it's correct, give up, you can't fix it.
[01:28:15.211 --> 01:28:24.612]  No, I've always said resistance is victory, because in my own life, but also studying history, it's the animating contest of liberty that empowers our liberty muscles.
[01:28:24.612 --> 01:28:26.533]  Mr. Rawls?
[01:28:26.533 --> 01:28:27.693]  I agree with you, Alex.
[01:28:27.693 --> 01:28:34.174]  The political process still has hope.
[01:28:34.174 --> 01:28:39.315]  There's still at least a kernel of hope there for America, and we cannot give up on the process.
[01:28:39.838 --> 01:28:41.559]  Well look at how fast people are waking up right now!
[01:29:00.197 --> 01:29:05.621]  I think they can't stop people from waking up to what's really going on.
[01:29:05.621 --> 01:29:13.888]  And people who have called themselves Republicans for many, many years are going to suddenly stop calling themselves Republicans if they see the convention.
[01:29:13.888 --> 01:29:14.248]  That's right.
[01:29:14.248 --> 01:29:15.829]  It's a Democratic Party plan.
[01:29:15.829 --> 01:29:16.770]  They're the dominant party.
[01:29:16.770 --> 01:29:20.773]  The Republicans, since the Rockefeller days, just play along.
[01:29:20.773 --> 01:29:22.655]  They're preparing to finally go ahead and kill the party.
[01:29:24.033 --> 01:29:28.778]  Uh, entirely, and create one-party rule with a vestigial Republican Party in the South.
[01:29:28.778 --> 01:29:30.079]  This is the true fall of America.
[01:29:30.079 --> 01:29:31.981]  I want to get your take on that, James Wesley Rawls.
[01:29:31.981 --> 01:29:32.661]  Survivalblog.com.
[01:29:32.661 --> 01:29:38.647]  We'll talk about the caliphate, and then go write the calls, talk about your new novel, straight ahead, that folks can find in bookstores everywhere.
[01:29:38.647 --> 01:29:40.689]  Survivalblog.com.
[01:29:40.689 --> 01:29:44.413]  In the, uh, land of promise, first book in the counter-caliphate chronicles.
[01:29:50.608 --> 01:29:53.629]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.629 --> 01:30:01.413]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.413 --> 01:30:04.194]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:30:04.194 --> 01:30:08.335]  College students panic after confusing priest for KKK member.
[01:30:08.335 --> 01:30:08.796]  Wow!
[01:30:08.796 --> 01:30:09.656]  Way to go students!
[01:30:09.656 --> 01:30:11.257]  Glad you're learning something out there.
[01:30:11.257 --> 01:30:17.119]  The difference between KKK members and quite frankly a man that looks like a priest with a rosary around his neck.
[01:30:17.279 --> 01:30:20.542]  According to news source the tab at around 9 15 p.m.
[01:30:20.542 --> 01:30:26.608]  students began issuing warnings on social media that a man in white robes had been seen on campus.
[01:30:26.608 --> 01:30:34.055]  Other students uninterested in waiting for the claims to be verified immediately demanded the school find a way to make them feel safe.
[01:30:34.055 --> 01:30:39.320]  After a flurry of emails and the likely construction of several safe spaces students were of
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:39.841]  We're good to go.
[01:31:01.304 --> 01:31:01.965]  Uh, yeah.
[01:31:01.965 --> 01:31:07.789]  First of all, I want to say Bigfoot 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[01:31:07.789 --> 01:31:08.750]  I use them all.
[01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:09.731]  They're phenomenal.
[01:31:09.731 --> 01:31:10.471]  They work.
[01:31:10.471 --> 01:31:11.312]  Buy them, folks.
[01:31:11.312 --> 01:31:11.712]  Thank you, brother.
[01:31:11.712 --> 01:31:13.754]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:31:13.754 --> 01:31:19.939]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:31:19.939 --> 01:31:21.941]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[01:31:21.941 --> 01:31:27.345]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:31:27.745 --> 01:31:28.506]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:31:28.506 --> 01:31:32.249]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, OscuFX, Nascent Iodine.
[01:31:32.249 --> 01:31:33.169]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:31:33.169 --> 01:31:34.210]  Have they worked for you?
[01:31:34.210 --> 01:31:37.073]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:31:37.073 --> 01:31:38.434]  What products are you taking?
[01:31:38.434 --> 01:31:46.440]  Everything from Super Male to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:49.923]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[01:31:50.063 --> 01:31:55.115]  Visit Infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[01:31:55.115 --> 01:31:57.159]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:00.962 --> 01:32:07.467]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:32:07.467 --> 01:32:20.456]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:32:20.456 --> 01:32:24.098]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:32:24.098 --> 01:32:27.621]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[01:32:27.941 --> 01:32:31.085]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:32:31.085 --> 01:32:43.839]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:32:43.939 --> 01:32:45.780]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:52.183]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[01:32:52.183 --> 01:32:57.105]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:33:16.834 --> 01:33:21.197]  Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:33:21.197 --> 01:33:22.678]  You want answers?
[01:33:22.678 --> 01:33:24.319]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:24.319 --> 01:33:28.002]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:30.367 --> 01:33:40.092]  Look, I don't want to get up here on a high horse, but I grew up in a family that was heavily informed about politics and what was really going on in the world.
[01:33:40.092 --> 01:33:42.593]  And I didn't think anything big deal of it when I was a kid.
[01:33:42.593 --> 01:33:47.395]  Now talk about this, people use it as a discrediting point, act like it's a secret and play a clip from the show.
[01:33:47.395 --> 01:33:48.396]  I'm saying it on my show.
[01:33:49.096 --> 01:33:56.343]  That there were a lot of people that were army officers, a lot of people that worked at intelligence agencies, people that knew about what was going on.
[01:33:56.343 --> 01:34:05.132]  They were all like Mr. America, like Superman characters, just like Mr. I mean absolutely change all these tires, go get blood, go to the Salvation Army on Christmas.
[01:34:06.286 --> 01:34:08.207]  Good Christian people.
[01:34:08.207 --> 01:34:10.288]  And they were manipulated into this whole system.
[01:34:10.288 --> 01:34:18.812]  And by the time I was a little kid, I mean, people come over, family come over and stuff, I would just hear about the Federal Reserve, the takeover, and the communists, and they're gonna break up the family.
[01:34:18.812 --> 01:34:20.133]  You can't believe what these people are doing.
[01:34:20.133 --> 01:34:28.517]  And just people sitting around the coffee table, just like, you know, Dallas cops coming in, and FBI agents, and, you know, people running around, you know, just freaking out.
[01:34:28.517 --> 01:34:30.598]  And I'm like five years old, like, watching all this.
[01:34:33.939 --> 01:34:39.700]  You know, like family getting blown up in Guatemala and being shipped in on a C-130 and, you know, just all sorts of stuff.
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:49.422]  And, I mean, Buckley works here and, you know, his dad was down there and they were routinely attacked by rebels in the government district and the house blown up they were in because it had all the antennas on the roof.
[01:34:49.422 --> 01:34:51.323]  I mean, I'm not going to get into the whole deal.
[01:34:51.323 --> 01:34:55.424]  Just the point is that I sit here and I know this is all real.
[01:34:56.284 --> 01:34:58.886]  I know they're coming after us, and you need to understand something.
[01:34:58.886 --> 01:35:05.789]  The globalists, they love third world, they love radicalism, they love authoritarianism because it's like them.
[01:35:05.789 --> 01:35:13.174]  They hate Christians, they hate America, they hate free market, they hate all of it.
[01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:18.797]  And they wanted totalitarianism to have their way with us.
[01:35:18.797 --> 01:35:20.778]  They're really bad news people, you need to understand.
[01:35:21.991 --> 01:35:23.992]  People think it's brave to fight them.
[01:35:23.992 --> 01:35:32.519]  I'd be the most brave person in the world to not resist the globalists.
[01:35:32.519 --> 01:35:46.429]  If I'm out on a sailboat in the middle of a great lake and all of a sudden a huge leak forms and the boat's going to sink and it's freezing water, I'm going to be bailing as fast as I can to get back to shore, not because I have courage.
[01:35:46.429 --> 01:35:48.571]  I'm going to be busting my butt because I want to live.
[01:35:49.724 --> 01:35:52.125]  That's why I don't call up and say I'm a hero.
[01:35:52.125 --> 01:35:53.945]  Do not call up and say how great I am.
[01:35:53.945 --> 01:35:57.426]  Folks, it's normal to fight this.
[01:35:57.426 --> 01:36:01.908]  It's abnormal not to.
[01:36:01.908 --> 01:36:07.109]  These people are really bad, and humanity deserves not to go through this anymore.
[01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:11.690]  You've seen all the tyrannies, and most governments are horrible and oppressive, and now you see the way we're going.
[01:36:11.690 --> 01:36:12.291]  It's bad news.
[01:36:12.291 --> 01:36:15.151]  I want to go back and get into Zoom Novel, take your phone calls.
[01:36:15.151 --> 01:36:16.352]  I'm not going to belabor this, but
[01:36:17.302 --> 01:36:36.268]  You need to understand that the reason I can be on the same page with somebody like Rawls, or the same page as a Colonel Schaefer, or the same page as a Tosh Plumley whistleblower, or the same page as a Lieutenant Marine Corps Colonel that was on last week, or the same page as everybody else, or the same page as congressmen that come on the show, like Walter Jones, is because it's a real page.
[01:36:36.268 --> 01:36:40.510]  It's like the Sammy Hagar song.
[01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:42.150]  It's a fact.
[01:36:42.150 --> 01:36:44.871]  Not my point of view, and you know it's true.
[01:36:44.871 --> 01:36:46.572]  And so, debate's over!
[01:36:49.209 --> 01:36:57.354]  We have a scientific tyranny coming in that's very easy to defeat, but it's so big and stinking and open and it's been so arrogant.
[01:36:59.841 --> 01:37:03.222]  Because all the other tyrannies came as tanks or weapons or troops.
[01:37:03.222 --> 01:37:08.203]  So, they thought, oh, we're corporate, we're sophisticated, the hillbillies won't look at what we're doing.
[01:37:08.203 --> 01:37:10.604]  Well, the hillbillies wouldn't look when everything was still pretty nice.
[01:37:10.604 --> 01:37:13.324]  Now they're looking and they're finding out, you did it.
[01:37:13.324 --> 01:37:15.205]  You're not getting away with this.
[01:37:15.205 --> 01:37:17.405]  You won't be safe anywhere with your money.
[01:37:17.405 --> 01:37:21.486]  I don't have some big raging thing to prove to want a war with you.
[01:37:21.486 --> 01:37:22.466]  I'm not an idiot.
[01:37:22.466 --> 01:37:27.148]  I want to stop this now.
[01:37:27.148 --> 01:37:28.608]  So I hope listeners and people understand,
[01:37:31.243 --> 01:37:32.984]  This isn't a game.
[01:37:32.984 --> 01:37:38.407]  And when I say, tell your friends and family about the show, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:37:38.407 --> 01:37:49.732]  When I tell you go to InfoWars.com forward slash show and download the free iPhone out of the Droid app or to send out articles or to send out podcasts, some people go, well, the government will get me if I do that.
[01:37:49.732 --> 01:37:50.533]  We're the government.
[01:37:50.533 --> 01:37:51.493]  We're the people.
[01:37:51.493 --> 01:37:53.754]  The military is ignoring all these threats.
[01:37:53.754 --> 01:37:55.795]  Just like Rawls said, they're coming after our free speech.
[01:37:55.795 --> 01:37:59.497]  Now is the time to stand, to protest, to demonstrate.
[01:37:59.497 --> 01:38:00.918]  You think I want to go to Cleveland?
[01:38:01.618 --> 01:38:04.800]  When I got three little kids, you think I really want to get up there?
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:08.862]  You think I really want to be all over the streets?
[01:38:08.862 --> 01:38:11.764]  I'm gonna be there.
[01:38:11.764 --> 01:38:13.545]  Because I'm afraid of letting these people win.
[01:38:13.545 --> 01:38:19.328]  A lot more than I'm afraid of what could happen to me.
[01:38:19.328 --> 01:38:20.909]  Stuff in the game, people.
[01:38:20.909 --> 01:38:22.349]  These people want to hurt you and your family, okay?
[01:38:22.349 --> 01:38:23.710]  You understand that?
[01:38:23.710 --> 01:38:25.051]  They hate you because you're a good person.
[01:38:25.051 --> 01:38:26.332]  They want to dominate you.
[01:38:26.332 --> 01:38:28.793]  Where is your instinct that God gave you to resist these people?
[01:38:32.827 --> 01:38:33.988]  Get up!
[01:38:33.988 --> 01:38:35.749]  Take action!
[01:38:35.749 --> 01:38:40.092]  I want to see our stories, our videos, Rawls material, everything plastered everywhere.
[01:38:40.092 --> 01:38:40.813]  This is a war!
[01:38:40.813 --> 01:38:45.136]  I have climbed up on the billboards at night, personally.
[01:38:45.136 --> 01:38:46.978]  I have put the flyers everywhere.
[01:38:46.978 --> 01:38:48.139]  I have flown around on airplanes.
[01:38:48.139 --> 01:38:49.960]  I've done stuff I don't even talk about on air.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.481]  I'm not going to get into it here today.
[01:38:51.481 --> 01:38:53.042]  I do it at the grocery store.
[01:38:53.042 --> 01:38:55.924]  I do it at church, everywhere.
[01:38:55.924 --> 01:38:57.205]  Because I'm fighting for my life.
[01:38:57.205 --> 01:38:57.786]  You understand that?
[01:38:59.076 --> 01:39:01.397]  You're in a fight for your life and your children's future.
[01:39:01.397 --> 01:39:02.818]  You need to act like it.
[01:39:02.818 --> 01:39:07.119]  And I'm not bitching at anybody, but they put us into a trance, myself included.
[01:39:07.119 --> 01:39:16.023]  And I need people to go to Infowarsstore.com and get the Hillary for Prison t-shirts, to get the Molon Labe, to meet like-minded people, and to spread the word and support the transmission.
[01:39:17.898 --> 01:39:19.299]  We brought the Heller for Prison shirt back.
[01:39:19.299 --> 01:39:19.919]  It's been augmented.
[01:39:19.919 --> 01:39:22.261]  It's a new edition, but it looks pretty much the same.
[01:39:22.261 --> 01:39:24.583]  We also have the new Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:39:24.583 --> 01:39:27.064]  You absolutely need that with your diet to boost your health.
[01:39:27.064 --> 01:39:28.645]  Everything else, it's a game changer.
[01:39:28.645 --> 01:39:33.308]  X2, Super Male Vitality, the Methylcobalamin, Vitamin B12, Secret 12's back in.
[01:39:33.308 --> 01:39:38.772]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:39:38.772 --> 01:39:42.335]  I want the money to have more reporters be able to go and cover everything.
[01:39:42.995 --> 01:39:46.136]  And not spend all my time jacking around trying to get sponsors.
[01:39:46.136 --> 01:39:47.277]  And I'm not complaining.
[01:39:47.277 --> 01:39:49.778]  But we need fuel in this war.
[01:39:49.778 --> 01:39:52.379]  We need to be strong to face the enemy.
[01:39:52.379 --> 01:39:53.139]  In the storm.
[01:39:53.139 --> 01:39:54.940]  And I thank you all for your support.
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:56.280]  I know it's rough out there.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.141]  Thank you for your prayers, first and foremost.
[01:39:58.141 --> 01:40:03.463]  Alright, Mr. Rawls, I want to give you the floor for about 6, 7, 8 minutes, because I just get really excited talking about all this stuff.
[01:40:03.463 --> 01:40:04.924]  Because things are so earnest now.
[01:40:04.924 --> 01:40:05.824]  It's all happening now.
[01:40:05.824 --> 01:40:07.044]  We've been proven right.
[01:40:07.044 --> 01:40:10.926]  I know it's... How does it feel for you, writing for 30 years, to now see it all proven right?
[01:40:11.906 --> 01:40:14.987]  And to see that your work has become basically prescient.
[01:40:14.987 --> 01:40:18.027]  I mean, I know personally, I'm not excited about the fact that I've been proven right.
[01:40:18.027 --> 01:40:19.408]  It's a very sick feeling.
[01:40:19.408 --> 01:40:22.749]  But at least we've been proven right, so more people pay attention now.
[01:40:22.749 --> 01:40:25.229]  And then let's get into the caliphate.
[01:40:25.229 --> 01:40:37.232]  Sure, well, it is gratifying to see that, you know, back in 1990, when I wrote the first draft of my first novel, people were saying that it was absolutely inconceivable to see a
[01:40:39.207 --> 01:40:45.009]  A stock market collapse and a collapse in the US dollar as a currency unit.
[01:40:45.009 --> 01:40:47.810]  And now people aren't saying that anymore.
[01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:51.792]  They recognize that it really is a possibility.
[01:40:51.792 --> 01:40:54.453]  And it is gratifying to see that people are waking up.
[01:40:55.287 --> 01:41:11.420]  But beyond that, it's important that as people wake up, they are politically active, they don't hold back from sharing this knowledge with their friends, and that they are fully committed
[01:41:12.492 --> 01:41:13.753]  To the fight ahead of them.
[01:41:13.753 --> 01:41:24.119]  You know, the old joke is that when the farmer was putting together breakfast, the chicken was involved, but the pig was committed.
[01:41:24.119 --> 01:41:35.406]  And that's the stage that we're at right now, where we have to be fully committed to this, because the battle is on.
[01:41:37.967 --> 01:41:53.845]  It's right before us and what I'm trying to do with my new novel series, the Counter Caliphate series, is to wake people up to the big picture of what's going on geopolitically and to point out to them that we're
[01:41:55.106 --> 01:42:00.047]  are not just victims of our circumstances, okay?
[01:42:00.047 --> 01:42:11.049]  We can actually make a change as individuals that we can individually push for the establishment of a Christian nation of refuge, for instance.
[01:42:11.049 --> 01:42:15.730]  That's what I put forth in the first novel in the series.
[01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:22.771]  That kind of change can take place and because we are a globally interconnected
[01:42:24.019 --> 01:42:24.419]  I think?
[01:42:45.558 --> 01:42:47.660]  These kind of changes will take place.
[01:42:47.660 --> 01:43:04.733]  And just like cockroaches scurrying away from the light, you turn enough lights on, like you're doing with all your educational quests, the roaches are going to go scurrying for cover.
[01:43:04.733 --> 01:43:12.600]  And people will realize that they individually can make a difference and they can truly change things.
[01:43:13.644 --> 01:43:20.026]  That's the encouraging thing, and that's why as a Christian and as a patriot, I hold out a lot of hope.
[01:43:20.026 --> 01:43:22.587]  Because I think in the long run, we are bound to win.
[01:43:22.587 --> 01:43:31.751]  As your promo says, we are on the march.
[01:43:31.751 --> 01:43:35.572]  We will prevail in the long run, and that's very encouraging.
[01:43:35.572 --> 01:43:39.734]  So I do encourage people to get active.
[01:43:41.252 --> 01:43:46.483]  And to share this knowledge as much as they can with others.
[01:43:46.483 --> 01:43:49.388]  No one knows who said it last time I checked.
[01:43:49.388 --> 01:43:51.532]  It's author unknown of the statement.
[01:43:51.532 --> 01:43:52.935]  There are no atheists in foxholes.
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:44:03.007]  But it is true that armies throughout history know about Providence, they know about trying to purify themselves, they know about trying to seek God.
[01:44:03.007 --> 01:44:10.572]  And that's because they've learned, even the most arrogant atheists, that you laugh at God, it's very unlucky.
[01:44:10.572 --> 01:44:16.597]  But you talk about George Washington and others, Providence is a real thing, and I've experienced it in my life.
[01:44:18.342 --> 01:44:26.708]  And I just feel sorry for people that really think that this world's a joke, and who don't think there aren't good and evil forces active in the world.
[01:44:26.708 --> 01:44:32.912]  Those people are so spiritually blind, they have no idea what's coming or what they're about to face.
[01:44:32.912 --> 01:44:37.195]  Well, that's our real hope, really, is in Christ.
[01:44:37.195 --> 01:44:45.842]  And as we look at this whole global political mess that's developed, we can have hope
[01:44:46.784 --> 01:44:58.348]  In the certain knowledge of our salvation, and we can be absolutely fearless with that knowledge in the fight ahead, knowing that we know our destination.
[01:44:58.348 --> 01:45:01.510]  If we're going to heaven, they can't take that away from us.
[01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:04.071]  So we can be fearless in this fight.
[01:45:04.071 --> 01:45:07.772]  Other tidbits, other tidbits before we go to calls that you'd like to relay to the listeners today.
[01:45:16.178 --> 01:45:19.040]  Yeah, his Skype was breaking up and we just lost his audio.
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:19.881]  It should come back in a moment.
[01:45:19.881 --> 01:45:24.204]  Did his Skype completely disconnect?
[01:45:24.204 --> 01:45:26.046]  Okay, James, can you hear us?
[01:45:26.046 --> 01:45:27.407]  Yeah, I have you.
[01:45:27.407 --> 01:45:33.151]  Okay, any other little Ted Bits you want to add before we go to some calls?
[01:45:33.151 --> 01:45:36.314]  Well, I just want to encourage people to
[01:45:39.289 --> 01:45:40.569]  Wake up individually.
[01:45:40.569 --> 01:45:41.870]  Wake up their friends.
[01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:47.871]  It's time to stock up, team up, and train up.
[01:45:47.871 --> 01:45:51.292]  Because we're far beyond just politics with this now.
[01:45:51.292 --> 01:45:57.794]  And the problems that have been created are going to affect us on a physical level.
[01:45:57.794 --> 01:46:05.956]  I mean, in terms of individual sustenance, in terms of individual, you know, just personal security.
[01:46:06.949 --> 01:46:08.670]  Of staying alive.
[01:46:08.670 --> 01:46:21.279]  So you need to have food storage, you need to have training, you need to have alternative currency, whether it's precious metals or ammunition for barter.
[01:46:21.279 --> 01:46:30.465]  It's actually come to that time where if you don't stock up, if you don't team up with your friends who are like-minded and if you don't train up,
[01:46:31.617 --> 01:46:37.025]  Because those supplies just by themselves are kind of useless unless you know exactly what you're doing with them.
[01:46:37.025 --> 01:46:40.411]  There's a learning curve with all of these things.
[01:46:40.411 --> 01:46:45.138]  It's time truly, folks, to stock up, team up, and train up to be ready for the dark days ahead.
[01:46:46.519 --> 01:46:47.960]  And it only runs from bad to worse.
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:49.361]  We're not trying to be negative here, folks.
[01:46:49.361 --> 01:46:52.784]  They plan to collapse Western civilization to bring in social engineering.
[01:46:52.784 --> 01:46:55.386]  They're going to make you very poor and desperate to do that.
[01:46:55.386 --> 01:46:57.187]  They do it in every communist takeover.
[01:46:57.187 --> 01:47:05.833]  This is not a communist program, but the globalists are using communist re-education tools, and even communist terminology now in army manuals that are declassified.
[01:47:05.833 --> 01:47:07.474]  So this is very, very dangerous.
[01:47:07.474 --> 01:47:11.117]  They use what's worked before, and they've been preparing the ground here for a while.
[01:47:11.117 --> 01:47:13.499]  Tim in Wyoming has a question for our guest.
[01:47:13.499 --> 01:47:14.680]  Mr. Rawls, go ahead, Tim.
[01:47:16.848 --> 01:47:19.029]  Yes, hello, thanks for taking my call.
[01:47:19.029 --> 01:47:28.033]  My question for you Mr. Rawls is, Alex asked this question of listeners yesterday and I never got a chance to call in and say what my line of command was.
[01:47:28.783 --> 01:47:36.449]  What is your line in the sand for when we should basically stand up and be counted, so to speak?
[01:47:36.449 --> 01:47:40.992]  Because, I mean, I'm already doing as much as I can possibly do in my small town.
[01:47:40.992 --> 01:47:42.653]  I think a lot of that's targeting.
[01:47:42.653 --> 01:47:44.955]  I mean, the people around you are just minions of the system.
[01:47:44.955 --> 01:47:46.576]  Going after them doesn't do anything.
[01:47:46.576 --> 01:47:47.837]  That's why I'm defensive.
[01:47:47.837 --> 01:47:50.319]  At least if somebody's attacking me, I know they're in the wrong.
[01:47:50.319 --> 01:47:56.183]  But a lot of this is just exposing the operatives so that if everything does go to a shoot-and-war, people know who the foreign enemy is.
[01:47:56.183 --> 01:47:57.604]  But Mr. Rawls, your comments?
[01:48:02.675 --> 01:48:07.078]  Well, I think everybody has to draw their own individual line, as it were.
[01:48:07.078 --> 01:48:20.789]  Because for someone who is a single person, for example, without a family, without children to worry about, that line in the sand might be a lot farther out than someone who has a large family to worry about.
[01:48:20.789 --> 01:48:28.055]  They're going to lock and load at a much later date than someone who doesn't have
[01:48:29.216 --> 01:48:32.599]  That level of responsibility for a family.
[01:48:32.599 --> 01:48:32.919]  That's right.
[01:48:32.919 --> 01:48:38.324]  My line of the stand is protect my family, protect my community, not be offensive.
[01:48:38.324 --> 01:48:42.227]  I'm offensive with information and then try to be defensive like a mother hen.
[01:48:42.227 --> 01:48:45.971]  But then at what point then do you go aggressive?
[01:48:45.971 --> 01:48:50.915]  And boy, once the people that are in a mother hen position go aggressive, that's when heads really roll, historically, correct?
[01:48:52.109 --> 01:48:59.853]  Yes, and again, people have to be wise as serpents and meek as doves, as the Bible teaches.
[01:48:59.853 --> 01:49:17.021]  Right now, if you look at what happened with the Bundy Ranch and with the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, people who stood up too early, too vocally, and who made some tactical mistakes in terms of committing felonies on federal property are now
[01:49:19.073 --> 01:49:19.875]  They walked into a trap!
[01:49:30.152 --> 01:49:35.217]  They all did it on camera, gave their names, and were seen on camera with weapons.
[01:49:35.217 --> 01:49:43.604]  And the sight of those weapons alone was used as felony charges of use of firearms to the commission of offense.
[01:49:43.604 --> 01:49:48.849]  And they thought just because they were in the right on a few issues, they didn't know about the optics.
[01:49:48.849 --> 01:49:49.850]  It was very, very foolish.
[01:49:51.078 --> 01:49:51.959]  Right.
[01:49:51.959 --> 01:49:55.163]  And so people have to be wise about that sort of thing.
[01:49:55.163 --> 01:49:57.486]  You have to pick your fights.
[01:49:57.486 --> 01:49:59.749]  You have to choose your battles wisely.
[01:49:59.749 --> 01:50:00.990]  Don't tilt at windmills.
[01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:07.678]  That's one reason I've never gotten involved in it, even though the tax system in the United States is inherently wrong.
[01:50:08.499 --> 01:50:13.481]  I chose not to fight the tax battle because I saw what happened to too many tax protesters.
[01:50:13.481 --> 01:50:28.725]  Exactly, we're fighting the general globalist occupied takeover, that it's a worldwide takeover, it's illegitimate, we're occupied, we're not fighting each tentacle, we're exposing to everyone that this is an illegitimate takeover that's now more naked than ever.
[01:50:28.725 --> 01:50:29.566]  Right.
[01:50:29.566 --> 01:50:36.688]  So, again, choose your battles wisely, and when you go to a public protest,
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:46.844]  You need to think very seriously about how far away you park your car, for example, so your license plate number won't be photographed.
[01:50:46.844 --> 01:50:50.426]  And whether or not you're going to disguise yourself.
[01:50:50.426 --> 01:50:54.028]  But don't be buffaloed into not attending at all.
[01:50:54.028 --> 01:50:57.429]  Well, I say either choose to be totally public or be underground.
[01:50:57.429 --> 01:50:58.450]  That's the model I think.
[01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:00.571]  People should either be completely underground or totally out in the open.
[01:51:00.931 --> 01:51:01.852]  I'm totally out in the open.
[01:51:32.672 --> 01:51:35.213]  Think body armor is just for commandos?
[01:51:35.213 --> 01:51:36.193]  Think again.
[01:51:36.193 --> 01:51:39.795]  In a collapse situation, you need to protect your entire family.
[01:51:39.795 --> 01:51:45.797]  Infidel Body Armor has created lightweight armor that repels AR-15 and AK-47 rounds.
[01:51:45.797 --> 01:51:49.078]  And priced at around $500, it won't break the bank.
[01:51:49.078 --> 01:51:51.119]  The whole kit weighs just 10 pounds.
[01:51:51.119 --> 01:51:53.480]  Light enough for your 7-year-old or 70-year-old.
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:56.681]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com and get yours today.
[01:51:56.681 --> 01:51:59.302]  That's InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:59.302 --> 01:52:00.343]  Just won't quit.
[01:52:02.225 --> 01:52:03.826]  Hi, my name is Nick Lupo.
[01:52:03.826 --> 01:52:07.087]  One World Way has been by far the best protein that I've ever had.
[01:52:07.087 --> 01:52:08.708]  I take it three times a day.
[01:52:08.708 --> 01:52:14.210]  Once in the morning as soon as I wake, once for a pre-workout snack, and once for a post-workout recovery drink.
[01:52:14.210 --> 01:52:17.751]  It has helped me transform and sculpt my body into what I have now.
[01:52:17.751 --> 01:52:22.913]  I began taking the product about two years ago, and boy, let me tell you, I'm in the best shape of my life.
[01:52:22.913 --> 01:52:26.614]  I've seen major muscle mass gains and have 0% body fat.
[01:52:26.614 --> 01:52:30.796]  I have had people in my gym ask if I compete in bodybuilding because of how lean and muscular I am.
[01:52:31.076 --> 01:52:37.521]  I used to suffer from everyday aches and pains from hard manual labor my whole life, and arthritis that runs through my family.
[01:52:37.521 --> 01:52:41.824]  But One World Way has helped me take that everyday pain from a 10 to a 3.
[01:52:41.824 --> 01:52:44.666]  Some days I feel no pain at all, just full of life and energy.
[01:52:44.666 --> 01:52:47.768]  It has also helped my skin look younger and healthier.
[01:52:47.768 --> 01:52:50.731]  Thank you, Synergistic Nutrition, for One World Way.
[01:52:50.731 --> 01:52:53.573]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:52:53.573 --> 01:52:55.714]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y, dot com.
[01:53:01.317 --> 01:53:03.659]  Are you concerned about the Power Grid?
[01:53:03.659 --> 01:53:06.082]  About the new war on the Power Grid?
[01:53:06.082 --> 01:53:11.647]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[01:53:11.647 --> 01:53:12.628]  Here's why.
[01:53:12.628 --> 01:53:18.174]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the Power Grid has just been written.
[01:53:18.174 --> 01:53:22.058]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies.
[01:53:22.338 --> 01:53:25.599]  But only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[01:53:25.599 --> 01:53:30.300]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:36.081]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[01:53:36.081 --> 01:53:37.021]  Why do this?
[01:53:37.021 --> 01:53:40.882]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[01:53:40.882 --> 01:53:42.182]  The answer is simple.
[01:53:42.182 --> 01:53:46.343]  America's power grid is in grave danger and most Americans are clueless.
[01:53:46.343 --> 01:53:51.464]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes and why the most common question this author gets is,
[01:53:51.724 --> 01:53:53.207]  Do you fear for your life?
[01:53:53.207 --> 01:53:55.491]  Go to waronthegrid.com.
[01:53:55.491 --> 01:53:57.595]  That's waronthegrid.com.
[01:53:57.595 --> 01:53:58.216]  Don't wait.

[01:54:18.573 --> 01:54:20.015]  James Leslie Rawls is our guest.
[01:54:20.015 --> 01:54:20.976]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:54:20.976 --> 01:54:25.141]  Coming up at about 8 after, David Knight's going to take over to cover all the election news.
[01:54:25.141 --> 01:54:31.468]  A whole bunch of big interviews that our crew in multiple states have been getting following Donald Trump.
[01:54:31.468 --> 01:54:32.910]  That's in the fourth hour today.
[01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:34.552]  Many stations are picking up the fourth hour.
[01:54:34.552 --> 01:54:35.013]  Some don't.
[01:54:35.553 --> 01:54:40.558]  But anybody can find the video feeds and audio feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:54:40.558 --> 01:54:50.149]  Also to be sent exclusive articles, exclusive videos, exclusive material so we can stay in touch with you even when we're being attacked or the website's been taken down sometimes when we get hit.
[01:54:50.729 --> 01:54:53.210]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:54:53.210 --> 01:54:58.931]  Just put in a random email you make just to get Infowars material or your regular email or whatever.
[01:54:58.931 --> 01:55:02.252]  Tell your friends and family sign up as well so we can stay in contact with you.
[01:55:02.252 --> 01:55:07.954]  That is a key lower tech way for us to send you information that you can then spread on to others.
[01:55:07.954 --> 01:55:08.774]  Survivalblog.com
[01:55:09.814 --> 01:55:16.340]  You know, I want to get Mr. Rawls on about his novel itself and Islam for a full hour or more in the near future.
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:20.303]  But right now, let's just go ahead and go back to calls.
[01:55:20.303 --> 01:55:24.307]  Speaking of the caliphate, more in Texas here on the air with James Wesley Rawls.
[01:55:25.803 --> 01:55:26.244]  I don't know.
[01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:51.167]  I don't want to say defective, but is it payback for them allying with Arabs instead of black people as they should have allied with?
[01:55:51.167 --> 01:55:51.888]  That's my question.
[01:55:51.888 --> 01:55:52.528]  All right, all right.
[01:55:52.528 --> 01:56:04.879]  Well, let me try to throw... I mean, I get what you're saying, that it is true that the British Empire and others kind of set up Islam, put the Wahhabis in control, the worst sect, obviously, who did say that black people weren't humans.
[01:56:05.319 --> 01:56:07.721]  Well, to begin with, I think the whole concept of race is spurious.
[01:56:07.721 --> 01:56:10.863]  I think there's only one race, and that's the human race.
[01:56:10.863 --> 01:56:11.763]  And for many, many years,
[01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:47.564]  Kings and princes and parliaments have been trying to divide people by putting labels on the so-called races and to drive a wedge between people to create conflict which they can then manage.
[01:56:48.391 --> 01:56:50.912]  To their, to meet their goals.
[01:56:50.912 --> 01:56:54.334]  So, I reject the whole concept of racism to begin with.
[01:56:54.334 --> 01:56:55.214]  Racist and racist.
[01:56:55.214 --> 01:56:56.675]  That's right, it's vulcanization.
[01:56:56.675 --> 01:56:57.976]  Thank you more, but it's an interesting question.
[01:56:57.976 --> 01:56:59.596]  Well, I mean, here's Mexico.
[01:56:59.596 --> 01:57:01.097]  Six months to a year hard labor.
[01:57:01.097 --> 01:57:02.318]  They torture you.
[01:57:02.318 --> 01:57:02.998]  They shock you.
[01:57:02.998 --> 01:57:03.438]  They beat you.
[01:57:03.438 --> 01:57:04.339]  That's in The Guardian.
[01:57:04.339 --> 01:57:06.260]  I said just last week, they beat you up.
[01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:08.481]  They tear, I mean, Mexico has some of the most draconian
[01:57:09.281 --> 01:57:12.842]  Rules, but they can't have huge third world populations coming in.
[01:57:12.842 --> 01:57:13.962]  They'll collapse even worse.
[01:57:13.962 --> 01:57:16.063]  I'm not saying what they're doing is good.
[01:57:16.063 --> 01:57:19.164]  How are we supposed to take all these people, though, and give them everything free?
[01:57:19.164 --> 01:57:21.484]  I'm not against these poor Latin Americans.
[01:57:21.484 --> 01:57:30.266]  But the globalists are bringing them in, turning them into a tribal, racial-based group, even if that's a fraud, to then ally with the socialists and vote our guns away.
[01:57:30.266 --> 01:57:31.967]  What do we do then, Mr. Rawls?
[01:57:33.692 --> 01:57:36.955]  Well, we need to reject racism.
[01:57:36.955 --> 01:57:42.399]  We need to point out when it's being used as a psychological weapon.
[01:57:42.399 --> 01:57:46.002]  And we can't we can't fall for the race baiting.
[01:57:46.002 --> 01:57:52.148]  It's important that we recognize that as American citizens, we represent
[01:57:53.570 --> 01:57:57.694]  The end result of what our founding fathers had in mind.
[01:57:57.694 --> 01:58:02.418]  And it actually worked remarkably well for many, many generations.
[01:58:02.418 --> 01:58:15.048]  And yeah, granted we're in dire straits right now, and we've read up a huge national debt, but they cannot extinguish the spirit of individual liberty that still exists in this country.
[01:58:15.048 --> 01:58:19.953]  I totally agree, but we can't have totally open borders and just bring people in and sign them up with the socialists.
[01:58:21.398 --> 01:58:29.102]  No, we have to be very protective of our borders.
[01:58:29.102 --> 01:58:35.765]  But for people who are American citizens, we have to fully bring them up in the culture.
[01:58:35.765 --> 01:58:38.926]  Absolutely, to bring them in to the Renaissance.
[01:58:38.926 --> 01:58:39.246]  70 seconds.
[01:58:39.246 --> 01:58:40.167]  Thank you, Mr. Rawls.
[01:58:40.167 --> 01:58:40.567]  Stay there.
[01:58:40.567 --> 01:58:42.808]  We'll be back with more calls, Matt and others.
[01:58:42.808 --> 01:58:45.249]  Infowars.com is the tip of the spear, folks.
[01:58:45.249 --> 01:58:47.550]  And I don't like that fact, but that's the way it is.
[01:58:47.550 --> 01:58:48.190]  So pray for us.
[01:58:48.190 --> 01:58:48.591]  We need it.
[01:58:48.591 --> 01:58:48.911]  Believe me.
[01:58:51.078 --> 01:58:54.599]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:58:54.599 --> 01:59:02.840]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:08.242]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:59:08.242 --> 01:59:10.782]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:55.785]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:16.252 --> 02:00:18.113]  We are on the march.
[02:00:18.113 --> 02:00:21.274]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:00:21.274 --> 02:00:26.016]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.016 --> 02:00:27.457]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:27.457 --> 02:00:34.200]  I'm David Knight and in this hour we're going to be talking to the former lawyer of Deborah Jean Palfrey.
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:39.342]  She was the, also known as the DC Madam, that's probably how you know her, the person that we were told
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:40.961]  Committed suicide.
[02:00:40.961 --> 02:00:42.622]  And of course, before the D.C.
[02:00:42.622 --> 02:00:56.254]  madam had committed suicide by hanging herself, there was also another prostitute who had been involved in these same high-profile clients who had committed suicide, we're told, the same way.
[02:00:56.254 --> 02:00:57.015]  By hanging herself.
[02:00:58.188 --> 02:01:00.929]  Now, we have the interviews, and we've played these many times.
[02:01:00.929 --> 02:01:05.752]  We'll play them also in this hour, where Alex Jones was, I believe, the last person to talk to the D.C.
[02:01:05.752 --> 02:01:10.774]  Madam, and he clarified with her that she was not at all suicidal.
[02:01:10.774 --> 02:01:12.715]  She was very adamant that she was not suicidal.
[02:01:12.715 --> 02:01:22.099]  He looked at the handwriting, did not, the suicide note did not look like her handwriting, and of course, 90% of the women who commit suicide do it with pills.
[02:01:22.099 --> 02:01:25.521]  It's very rare for women to commit suicide by hanging themselves.
[02:01:25.521 --> 02:01:27.082]  Of course, two of them committed suicide
[02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:30.392]  Back-to-back that way, in that same particular case.
[02:01:30.392 --> 02:01:32.194]  Now, why is this coming up?
[02:01:32.194 --> 02:01:46.225]  Well, this is coming up because her former lawyer, Montgomery Blair Sibley, who's going to be joining us in the next segment, has said that he has information that he believes is significant to the current presidential election.
[02:01:46.225 --> 02:01:47.466]  That time is of the essence.
[02:01:47.466 --> 02:01:49.388]  He went before the Supreme Court.
[02:01:49.388 --> 02:01:51.890]  He requested that this information be released.
[02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:53.932]  We're going to talk to him about the updates on that.
[02:01:54.926 --> 02:01:58.487]  Also we're going to have in the fourth hour, Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us.
[02:01:58.487 --> 02:02:01.307]  We have a story that's up on Infowars.com.
[02:02:01.307 --> 02:02:06.188]  Chaos as Social Justice Warrior Students Crash Students for Trump Meeting.
[02:02:06.188 --> 02:02:15.910]  Now what's interesting about this is that this was a relatively small number of students for Trump at a very, very liberal university, Portland State University.
[02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:17.590]  And I tell you, I've been to Portland.
[02:02:17.590 --> 02:02:19.511]  We went there for vacation.
[02:02:19.511 --> 02:02:20.691]  Beautiful, beautiful place.
[02:02:20.691 --> 02:02:21.331]  We were walking down.
[02:02:22.111 --> 02:02:28.033]  This former elementary school that is now a very nice hotel, restaurant area, just to look at the architecture.
[02:02:28.033 --> 02:02:37.436]  And as we're walking down the halls, I hear this meeting with all of the talking points of the politically correct left about white privilege and everything.
[02:02:37.436 --> 02:02:38.516]  I just couldn't believe it.
[02:02:38.516 --> 02:02:40.057]  It was just scripted.
[02:02:40.057 --> 02:02:44.078]  And I stopped and just went into the room for a while and just watched it.
[02:02:44.078 --> 02:02:44.959]  It's absolutely unbelieving.
[02:02:44.959 --> 02:02:47.419]  But that is the way Portland is.
[02:02:47.419 --> 02:02:48.860]  Now they had a group of a hundred
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:54.743]  Students show up at this Portland State University to intimidate the students for Trump.
[02:02:54.743 --> 02:02:57.264]  You can see the b-roll footage there.
[02:02:57.264 --> 02:03:00.045]  It was a massive number of people and of course they called the police.
[02:03:00.045 --> 02:03:01.646]  The police would never come.
[02:03:01.646 --> 02:03:05.408]  And why are you not hearing about this from the media?
[02:03:05.408 --> 02:03:14.053]  Why is it not a story when anti-Trump socialists continue to crash political meetings because they don't like your point of view?
[02:03:15.148 --> 02:03:17.990]  To intimidate and to shut down your free speech.
[02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:19.351]  This is the pattern.
[02:03:19.351 --> 02:03:25.635]  This is the pattern of confrontation, censorship, intimidation, threats of violence, getting in their face.
[02:03:25.635 --> 02:03:27.096]  That's what we're seeing here with this.
[02:03:27.096 --> 02:03:29.978]  We can't play it because there is so much language on there.
[02:03:29.978 --> 02:03:31.699]  We can't run this on the radio.
[02:03:31.699 --> 02:03:33.360]  But that's what we see over and over again.
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:35.762]  Of course, it doesn't happen on the right.
[02:03:35.762 --> 02:03:42.026]  You don't see people crashing in and trying to shut down Bernie Sanders rallies, except for the Black Lives Matter people.
[02:03:42.026 --> 02:03:43.147]  He allowed them to do that.
[02:03:44.619 --> 02:03:46.540]  Presumably, I guess he agrees with him.
[02:03:46.540 --> 02:03:50.562]  But you don't see Trump people going and trying to shut down Hillary Clinton's rallies.
[02:03:50.562 --> 02:03:54.384]  There's a guy right in his face, trying to get violent with him.
[02:03:54.384 --> 02:03:55.765]  You don't see that happening on the other side.
[02:03:55.765 --> 02:04:10.632]  Of course, you do see, on the right-hand side, you do see the social justice warriors like Megyn Kelly and Michelle Fields, who cannot figure out whether they want to be victims or power women, and they're kind of vacillating back and forth between those two.
[02:04:10.632 --> 02:04:11.973]  They do want to shut people down.
[02:04:12.796 --> 02:04:16.018]  And of course, it was not covered that much this last weekend.
[02:04:16.018 --> 02:04:25.384]  Megyn Kelly told Charlie Rose that she thought that CNN shouldn't have covered interviews with Donald Trump when he did not go to her debates.
[02:04:25.384 --> 02:04:26.404]  They should have censored him.
[02:04:26.404 --> 02:04:29.106]  They should have banned him from television because that's the way you handle it.
[02:04:29.106 --> 02:04:32.088]  And she said, we should do this to support the First Amendment.
[02:04:32.688 --> 02:04:36.929]  No, the First Amendment is about a free marketplace of ideas.
[02:04:36.929 --> 02:04:40.049]  And it's about competition in that marketplace, if it's about anything.
[02:04:40.049 --> 02:04:42.530]  There's very little of that in the mainstream media.
[02:04:42.530 --> 02:04:45.411]  But what little of it does exist?
[02:04:45.411 --> 02:04:49.351]  These social justice warriors, like Megyn Kelly, want to shut it down.
[02:04:49.351 --> 02:04:49.771]  Stay with us.
[02:04:49.771 --> 02:04:51.572]  We're going to be right back with the D.C.
[02:04:51.572 --> 02:04:52.832]  Madam's lawyer.
[02:04:52.832 --> 02:04:54.832]  What is in these records?
[02:04:54.832 --> 02:04:56.753]  Whose name is in these records?
[02:04:56.753 --> 02:04:57.533]  Find out when we come back.
[02:05:01.124 --> 02:05:08.250]  Belgian authorities are still on the lookout for the infamous Man in the Hat, seen walking alongside the Brussels airport suicide bombers.
[02:05:08.250 --> 02:05:19.900]  According to a report in France's Le Monde newspaper, the Man in the Hat could be Naeem al-Hamed, who was born in Syria in 88 and arrived in Europe amongst the wave of refugees who entered via Greece last year.
[02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:28.387]  Al-Hamed arrived with Sofiane Ayari, another suspected Brussels terror plotter who was captured in a police raid, along with Paris massacre suspect Salah Abdeslam.
[02:05:28.547 --> 02:05:37.053]  And if Al-Hamid is not the man in the hat, he's still suspected to be an accomplice of the suicide bomber who blew himself up on the train at Malbik metro station.
[02:05:37.053 --> 02:05:48.100]  Back in December, ISIS bragged in its own manifesto of how it planned to exploit the refugee crisis in order to infiltrate jihadists and create Muslim no-go ghettos from where future attacks could be planned.
[02:05:48.100 --> 02:05:58.507]  The possibility of yet another jihadist exploiting the migrant crisis to enter Europe better put the pressure on governments to scale back these open border policies that have left the continent vulnerable to terrorists.
[02:05:58.827 --> 02:06:01.129]  Read more at InfoWars.com.

[02:06:33.007 --> 02:06:34.028]  Have they worked for you?
[02:06:34.028 --> 02:06:36.909]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:06:36.909 --> 02:06:37.989]  What products are you taking?
[02:06:37.989 --> 02:06:46.271]  Everything from Supermail to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[02:06:46.271 --> 02:06:49.732]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[02:07:10.079 --> 02:07:18.444]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:07:18.444 --> 02:07:24.108]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.

[02:07:33.670 --> 02:07:39.891]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[02:07:39.891 --> 02:07:46.633]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:07:46.633 --> 02:07:51.674]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[02:07:52.014 --> 02:07:56.577]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.

[02:08:11.486 --> 02:08:15.848]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:15.848 --> 02:08:18.190]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:26.541]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight and we're going to be talking to the lawyer of the D.C.
[02:08:26.541 --> 02:08:28.761]  Madam, Deborah Jean Palfrey.
[02:08:28.761 --> 02:08:35.163]  She supposedly had committed suicide about 10 years ago.
[02:08:35.163 --> 02:08:37.863]  She was the D.C.
[02:08:37.863 --> 02:08:42.304]  Madam who had a lot of information and phone numbers on powerful people in Washington.
[02:08:42.304 --> 02:08:45.445]  Politicians, staff members, many others.
[02:08:45.445 --> 02:08:46.965]  Who could lose their careers?
[02:08:48.001 --> 02:08:55.184]  And we had a Senator Vitter who did lose his career once his name was discovered in the list.
[02:08:55.184 --> 02:08:57.085]  Now, it's been some time.
[02:08:57.085 --> 02:09:02.108]  We want to talk to the lawyer because this has resurfaced after the stories from the National Enquirer.
[02:09:02.984 --> 02:09:09.511]  Talking about how Ted Cruz had had accusing him alleging that he had had affairs with multiple women.
[02:09:09.511 --> 02:09:18.500]  There were also prior to the National Enquirer story going back several weeks I think to the beginning of March was when the Marco Rubio camp was
[02:09:19.448 --> 02:09:22.970]  Putting a story around about Ted Cruz and former liaisons.
[02:09:22.970 --> 02:09:31.476]  There was also a release from Anonymous saying that they had information about Ted Cruz and situations that he had been involved in.
[02:09:31.476 --> 02:09:36.599]  Then calling on him to quit the campaign or they would release this information.
[02:09:36.599 --> 02:09:39.801]  Now we have the lawyer, the former lawyer of the DC Madam.
[02:09:41.099 --> 02:09:46.140]  And he says he has a lot of records that he believes are relevant to the current election campaign.
[02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:52.642]  He believes that time is of the essence, that the population, the voting population needs to see this information.
[02:09:52.642 --> 02:10:04.925]  And our information from him says that he is in sole possession of over 2,500 emails from and to Jean Palfrey, and the only one with full knowledge of what transpired during those last 20 months of her life.
[02:10:05.485 --> 02:10:10.912]  It was compelled by her express direction to him to tell her story in the event of her death.
[02:10:11.761 --> 02:10:14.082]  He's been practicing law for over 25 years.
[02:10:14.082 --> 02:10:15.603]  Most recently, he's engaged the U.S.
[02:10:15.603 --> 02:10:27.969]  Supreme Court in a series of lawsuits challenging that court's assertion of discretionary jurisdiction and personal immunity from suits alleging violation of federal statutes and the disposition of cases before them.
[02:10:27.969 --> 02:10:29.909]  This is Montgomery Blair Sibley.
[02:10:29.909 --> 02:10:33.971]  His website is montgomeryblairsibley.com.
[02:10:33.971 --> 02:10:36.592]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Sibley.
[02:10:36.592 --> 02:10:39.754]  David, what a pleasure and indeed an honor to be on your show today.
[02:10:40.265 --> 02:10:42.366]  I really appreciate the opportunity.
[02:10:42.366 --> 02:10:48.988]  Well, I appreciate you putting this information out there, and we want to get an idea of exactly what you have.
[02:10:48.988 --> 02:10:50.749]  You've been under a gag order for some time.
[02:10:50.749 --> 02:10:53.670]  This is all nine, ten years old.
[02:10:53.670 --> 02:10:55.631]  This information has been around.
[02:10:55.631 --> 02:10:57.512]  Tell us about the gag order.
[02:10:57.512 --> 02:11:01.253]  Tell us what you can about the information that you have.
[02:11:01.253 --> 02:11:02.994]  Well, I'll start with the gag order.
[02:11:02.994 --> 02:11:04.534]  That was entered back in May of 2007.
[02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:12.056]  It was to prevent me from releasing any telephone numbers of the DC Madam.
[02:11:12.056 --> 02:11:23.869]  It was partially modified to let me release telephone numbers alone, which we did, and that's how, through the crowdsource, we identified various people of prominence.
[02:11:23.869 --> 02:11:27.994]  Dan Moldea particularly identified Senator Vitter as one of the more prominent people on the list.
[02:11:29.489 --> 02:11:31.770]  Subsequent orders were entered in the case.
[02:11:31.770 --> 02:11:37.091]  Oral orders, which were never reduced to writing, never appear on the docket, were entered in the case.
[02:11:37.091 --> 02:11:48.654]  And the sum and substance of it all is, I understand and believe I'm operating on order not to release the names of the escorts or the clients of the escort service as of this day.
[02:11:48.654 --> 02:11:51.594]  Okay, now you appealed to the U.S.
[02:11:51.594 --> 02:11:53.695]  Supreme Court to release this gag order.
[02:11:53.695 --> 02:11:54.655]  Tell us what happened with that.
[02:11:55.737 --> 02:11:58.400]  Well, let me back up if I could, David, just a bit more.
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:07.208]  It was in January that, for other reasons, I was looking at these records and believed they became irrelevant to the presidential election cycle we're in.
[02:12:07.208 --> 02:12:16.697]  So I first went to the court that issued the orders, gagging me, if you will, restraining me, and they refused to let me file a request to modify the orders.
[02:12:17.941 --> 02:12:21.562]  As a result, I went to the appellate court in D.C.
[02:12:21.562 --> 02:12:28.165]  and challenged that refusal of the right to even file the request to modify the restraining orders.
[02:12:28.165 --> 02:12:41.069]  After two weeks waiting and hearing no response, and I'll just note it's now been 30 days and I still have had no response from the Circuit Court of Appeal, I then went to Chief Justice Roberts of the U.S.
[02:12:41.069 --> 02:12:44.570]  Supreme Court requesting his intervention in this matter.
[02:12:45.492 --> 02:12:55.684]  And of course, many of us are concerned about Justice Roberts himself having written both the concurring and dissenting opinions on Obamacare.
[02:12:55.684 --> 02:12:56.785]  Highly unusual.
[02:12:56.785 --> 02:13:06.015]  Many of us at the time believed that he perhaps had been blackmailed for whatever reason, we have no idea, but it was very, very unusual and of course
[02:13:06.716 --> 02:13:16.006]  The idea that the federal government can force people to buy something in the marketplace is something that none of us could find in the Constitution.
[02:13:16.006 --> 02:13:22.492]  And clearly, Justice Roberts couldn't find it either, so he wrote both the dissenting and the concurring opinion.
[02:13:22.492 --> 02:13:29.259]  Highly irregular, and now we have learned that both he and Ginsburg have been the subject of
[02:13:30.849 --> 02:13:32.571]  Phone taps and that sort of thing from the government.
[02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:38.436]  So that is something that we all need to worry about, and it is an issue when we're looking at political candidates, because they can be blackmailed.
[02:13:38.436 --> 02:13:48.385]  Because you have situations, as the National Enquirer has done in the past, exposing moral situations with Gary Hart, with John Edwards, that ended their careers.
[02:13:48.385 --> 02:13:54.611]  Because these people can be blackmailed, but it also breaks faith with their image with the public.
[02:13:54.611 --> 02:13:55.511]  Tell us what's in these
[02:13:56.736 --> 02:14:01.682]  Uh, and these phone records that we've not previously seen, the ones that you're trying to get released.
[02:14:01.682 --> 02:14:04.365]  Well, here's the challenge technologically.
[02:14:04.365 --> 02:14:15.878]  David, you have a cell phone, telephone number, and that number belongs to you, and you know it, and anyone you give it to knows it, and of course the phone company, let's say it's AT&T, knows it, knows your name, your address.
[02:14:16.927 --> 02:14:23.309]  But nobody else can find that number because there is no white pages for cell phone telephone numbers.
[02:14:23.309 --> 02:14:29.550]  So while we were able to identify some of the numbers in the records, a large number of the numbers we couldn't identify.
[02:14:29.550 --> 02:14:40.393]  So I issued secret subpoenas, that is unknown to the government, to the major telephone companies asking them whose telephone numbers these are.
[02:14:40.393 --> 02:14:43.554]  And I gave them a list of about 6,000 telephone numbers.
[02:14:44.829 --> 02:14:52.074]  Those subpoenas went to Verizon Wireless, Alltel, AT&T, T-Mobile, and some others.
[02:14:52.074 --> 02:15:07.326]  And as a result from Verizon Wireless, God bless them, they responded and gave me a list of 815 individuals and companies that had numbers in the telephone records of the escort service.
[02:15:07.326 --> 02:15:10.329]  Okay, so you were able to reverse those out.
[02:15:12.341 --> 02:15:17.605]  Yes, it's reverse engineering of the identities of the escorts and the customers of the escort service.
[02:15:17.605 --> 02:15:19.106]  Have those names been released?
[02:15:19.106 --> 02:15:22.048]  Are there presidential candidates within those 815?
[02:15:22.048 --> 02:15:26.051]  Is that what you're trying to get released with these appeals to the court?
[02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:32.555]  Well, David, let me be very clear in answering that compound question so there's no confusion.
[02:15:32.555 --> 02:15:41.842]  Those names have not been released because I believe they are under the court orders preventing me and everyone else who may think they have them or not have them from releasing those orders.
[02:15:42.657 --> 02:15:48.520]  If you do so, you're in violation of the court order, which is contempt, which is punishable by incarceration.
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:53.042]  And there originally, arguably, was a good reason for those orders.
[02:15:53.042 --> 02:15:56.464]  My position now is that those reasons have dissipated.
[02:15:57.202 --> 02:16:10.406]  And alternatively, my First Amendment right to give comment now trumps whatever original reasons existed for issuing those orders, and therefore I properly have asked to be heard on my motion to dissolve those restraining orders.
[02:16:10.406 --> 02:16:14.447]  The government will not let me file that request, and that's what all the litigation is about.
[02:16:15.245 --> 02:16:15.586]  I see.
[02:16:15.586 --> 02:16:30.907]  So, out of the 6,000 or so that you've got, you were able to get from Verizon about 800 of those that you were able to identify, but you cannot release the identification of those numbers without the court lifting this restraining order.
[02:16:30.907 --> 02:16:31.308]  Is that correct?
[02:16:31.568 --> 02:16:36.533]  Right, so I identified about 13% of the actors involved in the D.C.
[02:16:36.533 --> 02:16:39.757]  Madam's Escort Service over a 13-year period.
[02:16:39.757 --> 02:16:45.823]  That means, if my math is any good, I did not identify 87% of those actors.
[02:16:45.823 --> 02:16:53.992]  Now, in the ones that we identified, there were a fair amount of public actors, if you will, government or quasi-government officials.
[02:16:54.574 --> 02:16:56.358]  We only got 13%.
[02:16:56.358 --> 02:17:04.777]  Well, obviously, 87% is statistically likely to contain about five times more such people that I think we have the right to know about.
[02:17:05.874 --> 02:17:22.560]  Now when we look at the information, you got started on this, trying to release this information way back in January, and of course it was in March, way before this story came out, the National Enquirer, that we saw the action from the Rubio account as well as from Anonymous.
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:28.782]  It was reported that Anonymous was threatening Ted Cruz, saying that they had information that they believed
[02:17:29.502 --> 02:17:31.244]  LinkedIn with the DC Madam.
[02:17:31.244 --> 02:17:57.586]  Now, of course, you can't comment on that specifically as to whether or not you have any information on that, but do they have information that, how much of this is out in the open in terms of, are all the 5,000 or so names out there in the open, or are there some additional names, as I read in the introduction, you said there was about 2,500 names that you had sole possession of, so I would assume those are not on the internet.
[02:17:57.586 --> 02:17:57.986]  Is that correct?
[02:17:58.909 --> 02:17:59.890]  That is correct.
[02:17:59.890 --> 02:18:08.797]  They were never released, and the telephone numbers I gave on to the telephone companies pursuant to these secret subpoenas were never released publicly.
[02:18:08.797 --> 02:18:11.660]  What everyone's claiming they have is the stuff that we did send out.
[02:18:11.660 --> 02:18:17.585]  I sent out 50 CDs containing, I don't know, 10,000 phone numbers or so, and those are still floating around.
[02:18:17.585 --> 02:18:22.549]  They've pretty much been identified or were unable to be identified in the course of things.
[02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:24.851]  No, what I'm talking about now is stuff that no one's ever seen before.
[02:18:25.836 --> 02:18:31.159]  Let me ask you about Debra Jean Palfrey, the DC Madam, and her supposed suicide.
[02:18:31.159 --> 02:18:35.622]  Do you believe it was a suicide or do you believe that there was foul play involved?
[02:18:35.622 --> 02:18:36.482]  Your personal opinion.
[02:18:36.482 --> 02:18:42.305]  David, my personal opinion is I wake up and struggle with that answer on a regular basis.
[02:18:42.305 --> 02:18:44.947]  So many things about I know about that woman.
[02:18:44.947 --> 02:18:52.391]  My communications with her the days before she was found dead just make it improbable, if not impossible, that she committed suicide.
[02:18:53.186 --> 02:18:57.307]  On the other hand, suicide is always an enigma to those who've suffered through it.
[02:18:57.307 --> 02:19:01.048]  So, one really can never know what is actually going on in somebody's mind.
[02:19:01.048 --> 02:19:04.168]  It just seems... We were talking about a very aggressive appeal.
[02:19:04.168 --> 02:19:05.409]  We had great issues.
[02:19:05.409 --> 02:19:08.149]  I think we would have been very successful on appeal.
[02:19:08.149 --> 02:19:10.950]  I just didn't see her giving up the fight the way she did.
[02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:14.090]  So, to answer your question, I don't know.
[02:19:14.090 --> 02:19:18.571]  Let me ask you, you're not contemplating suicide, right?
[02:19:18.571 --> 02:19:19.952]  Oh, let's go on the record about that.
[02:19:19.952 --> 02:19:20.832]  Yeah, let's do that.
[02:19:21.614 --> 02:19:28.845]  There's too much joy ahead of me in my life, and this is only part of my life, please, that I wouldn't even, that isn't even a passing fancy of mine.
[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:32.501]  Well, you know, I ask that question because we do want to get that on record.
[02:19:32.501 --> 02:19:38.002]  We did talk to Dylan Webb before he allegedly committed suicide, shooting himself twice in the head.
[02:19:38.002 --> 02:19:39.262]  And he was very combative.
[02:19:39.262 --> 02:19:43.042]  He was moving forward, exposing new stories.
[02:19:43.042 --> 02:19:46.463]  And of course, Alex was the last one to interview the D.C.
[02:19:46.463 --> 02:19:50.024]  Madam, and she was very adamant that she was not going to commit suicide.
[02:19:50.024 --> 02:19:50.344]  Stay with us.
[02:19:50.344 --> 02:19:51.104]  We're going to be right back.
[02:19:51.104 --> 02:19:54.284]  We've got some more questions for the lawyer of the D.C.
[02:19:54.284 --> 02:19:56.365]  Madam and the information that he has.
[02:19:56.365 --> 02:19:56.705]  Stay with us.
[02:19:56.705 --> 02:19:57.205]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:06.843]  First of all, my number one priority, like yours Alex, is the customer's health.
[02:20:06.843 --> 02:20:08.564]  And that's the first thing that we look at.
[02:20:08.564 --> 02:20:24.012]  I want to provide the highest quality, best ingredients, stuff that I know is going to be effective, stuff that I know individuals are going to get results with, and stuff that's going to change, literally change, their health for the betterment of their life.
[02:20:24.012 --> 02:20:26.413]  And so they don't have to deal with anything and it starts at the cell.
[02:20:26.833 --> 02:20:37.939]  If you add up all the ingredients that we have in DNA Force and you were to buy those separately, you would be spending two, probably three hundred dollars because we use the highest quality, best ingredients.
[02:20:37.939 --> 02:20:43.222]  I mean, literally, you're creating miracles because what you're doing is you're repairing the cells.
[02:20:43.222 --> 02:20:52.726]  And a lot of the supplements out there aren't focused on getting into the cellular mitochondrial regrowth.
[02:20:52.726 --> 02:20:55.088]  And when the mitochondria dies and the cell dies,
[02:20:56.048 --> 02:21:01.193]  Or when new cells come about from that, they're even unhealthier than the cells before.
[02:21:01.193 --> 02:21:07.960]  That's right, the cell is ready to die, it emergency divides, you only get so many divisions of the telomeres, that's when your body shuts down.
[02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:11.643]  That's why old people look old, because their cells are dead and dying.
[02:21:11.643 --> 02:21:17.109]  What we have is we have the Bio-PQQ, which is found as the original life form, multi
[02:21:17.709 --> 02:21:20.791]  Antioxidant mineral that's found in space dust.
[02:21:20.791 --> 02:21:22.672]  We have the Pteropura in there too.
[02:21:22.672 --> 02:21:29.995]  That's it that's it which contains different components health-giving components and antioxidants that are contained in blueberries.
[02:21:29.995 --> 02:21:35.037]  The equivalent of 500 cartons of blueberries that you would have to eat.
[02:21:35.037 --> 02:21:36.718]  So really this is an antioxidant.
[02:21:36.718 --> 02:21:37.959]  It's an anti-aging
[02:21:39.299 --> 02:21:48.683]  It's a cellular repair, mitochondrial repair, and since everything starts at the cellular level, you're getting all these nutrients into the base of that.
[02:21:48.683 --> 02:21:58.227]  And what we've done with this new batch of DNA Force, I'm always looking for new and exciting things that we can add to these formulas to bring the quality up.
[02:21:58.227 --> 02:22:02.949]  That's why constantly we're looking at improving the quality and adding new things.
[02:22:02.949 --> 02:22:05.790]  That's why it's now DNA Force Plus, though we haven't changed the label yet.
[02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:15.632]  So this new DNA Force batch has the addition of an OMRI listed organic fulvic acid and it's just like the Shilajit that we use as well.
[02:22:15.632 --> 02:22:20.313]  The fulvic acid is the base core component of all cellular life.
[02:22:20.313 --> 02:22:28.154]  It's made from the decomposition of plants and that decomposes into a humus structure and fulvic acid is one of the components of that.
[02:22:28.154 --> 02:22:33.995]  Fulvic acid contains 77 different base ionic minerals and it's on the
[02:22:34.335 --> 02:22:38.478]  Label on the back, we just haven't changed the main label on the front to call it DNA Force Plus.
[02:22:38.478 --> 02:22:39.739]  We have a limited run.
[02:22:39.739 --> 02:22:43.902]  And again, it does have so many things in it that are hard to source, hard to get.
[02:22:43.902 --> 02:22:47.204]  That's why we're sold out half the time of DNA Force.
[02:22:47.204 --> 02:22:49.285]  It's just because the formula is that good, folks.
[02:22:49.285 --> 02:22:52.367]  That's not a gimmick where we're sold out all the time of some of these key things.
[02:22:52.367 --> 02:22:59.873]  It's the more complex the product is, the harder it is to get the truly pure, clean, organic, the harder it is to pass all the standards.
[02:22:59.873 --> 02:23:01.394]  And when we don't, we just don't put it out.
[02:23:02.304 --> 02:23:03.365]  I mean, nobody else does that.
[02:23:32.264 --> 02:23:35.046]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:23:35.046 --> 02:23:37.488]  Listen, it goes back to nature.
[02:23:37.488 --> 02:23:40.451]  Nature is our medicine.
[02:23:40.451 --> 02:23:42.573]  Nature is the next thing.
[02:23:42.573 --> 02:23:44.935]  Nature is the high tech.
[02:23:44.935 --> 02:23:46.276]  Nature trumps the drugs.
[02:23:46.276 --> 02:23:47.717]  Not drugs, nature.
[02:23:47.717 --> 02:23:48.938]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:23:48.938 --> 02:23:50.900]  Powered by nature, not drugs.
[02:23:50.900 --> 02:23:51.620]  Exactly.
[02:23:51.620 --> 02:23:54.342]  I'm pitching something here to you because it's amazing.
[02:23:54.342 --> 02:23:55.403]  DNA Force.
[02:23:55.403 --> 02:23:57.345]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:24:12.113 --> 02:24:13.415]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:13.415 --> 02:24:18.562]  I'm David Knight and I'm talking to the lawyer of Deborah Jean Palfrey, the former DC Madam.
[02:24:18.562 --> 02:24:23.029]  Of course, back in 2006 she was arrested for running an escort service.
[02:24:23.029 --> 02:24:27.175]  It's very popular in Washington, especially amongst Republicans that outed
[02:24:27.964 --> 02:24:35.245]  Very key people like Senator David Vitter from Louisiana, Deputy Secretary of State Randall Tobias, and Dick Morris.
[02:24:35.245 --> 02:24:36.666]  We all know Dick Morris.
[02:24:36.666 --> 02:24:39.246]  All Republicans.
[02:24:39.246 --> 02:24:51.689]  Sibley, who was representing her at the time, said that he had about, I think it's been reported, you had about 10,000 phone numbers, Mr. Sibley, and you said that you held some of those back for leverage.
[02:24:51.689 --> 02:24:52.449]  Is that correct?
[02:24:52.449 --> 02:24:57.650]  You've got 2,500 at least that you say nobody has seen before or have been put online.
[02:24:57.810 --> 02:24:58.932]  Is that correct?
[02:24:58.932 --> 02:24:59.994]  Yes, exactly so.
[02:24:59.994 --> 02:25:02.620]  Because when you litigate, you don't want to put everything out to begin with.
[02:25:02.620 --> 02:25:04.464]  You need some surprise witnesses for trial.
[02:25:05.322 --> 02:25:20.572]  And of course this is in the news because you have publicly stated, and of course you've been trying to get this stuff released going back to January, but you publicly stated that this time is of the essence on this because of the Republican election, or the presidential election I should say.
[02:25:20.572 --> 02:25:28.877]  Tell me where we go from here because you have appealed to the Supreme Court to try to lift the stay that would prevent you from, that is preventing you from releasing information.
[02:25:28.877 --> 02:25:30.818]  What, where do you go from here with this information?
[02:25:32.119 --> 02:25:46.845]  Well, I mean, quite candidly, if I don't get relief from the Supreme Court or the Circuit Court of Appeal or the District Court, which issued the gag orders by the middle of next week, I'm going to release a list of
[02:25:47.443 --> 02:25:56.867]  The entities, government and private, that are on the list as a demonstration that there are significant people involved in this list.
[02:25:56.867 --> 02:26:04.270]  I can do that because I'm prohibited from releasing the names of the customers, not the companies and government agencies the customers were working for.
[02:26:04.270 --> 02:26:15.554]  I'm going to hope that that and perhaps the public support I get for that action will convince the courts that I deserve the simple right every citizen of this country has, which is to be heard.
[02:26:16.355 --> 02:26:17.657]  And I agree with you wholeheartedly.
[02:26:17.657 --> 02:26:21.823]  I think we need to know the information needs to be made public.
[02:26:33.098 --> 02:26:36.964]  We need to know this information if it involves any of these presidential candidates.
[02:26:36.964 --> 02:26:40.410]  And of course, our government looks at everything in our private lives.
[02:26:40.410 --> 02:26:42.974]  Nothing is off limits to the government.
[02:26:42.974 --> 02:26:46.139]  And they repeatedly say they don't even need a search warrant.
[02:26:46.139 --> 02:26:47.901]  They don't have to be specific about what they're looking for.
[02:26:47.901 --> 02:26:48.162]  They just...
[02:26:48.402 --> 02:27:01.894]  Grab these massive search warrants with Verizon, looking, interestingly enough, using these pen techniques, just going out and grabbing a phone number, tracking people's information as they move around.
[02:27:01.894 --> 02:27:10.962]  So, you're going to release, then, not specific names, but the connections to organizations to try to show the significance here, right?
[02:27:12.572 --> 02:27:21.896]  Exactly so, because I believe, remember, it's not only the candidates themselves, but there are 435 congressional districts that will be up for election.
[02:27:21.896 --> 02:27:25.917]  They're the vice presidential candidates, which will ultimately be announced.
[02:27:25.917 --> 02:27:31.899]  There's the executives who will populate the major branches of government after the election.
[02:27:31.899 --> 02:27:35.641]  All those people are, to my mind,
[02:27:36.707 --> 02:27:43.134]  Fair game or inquiry into their private behavior because it may well compromise their public behavior.
[02:27:43.134 --> 02:27:51.262]  But we know the government has used their surveillance techniques to persuade people to blackmail people to follow people around in their private affairs.
[02:27:51.932 --> 02:27:53.514]  And I'll just, you know, pose this question.
[02:27:53.514 --> 02:27:58.698]  Instead of outing Senator Bitter, what if I had gone to him and said, gee, I'd like my son appointed to West Point?
[02:27:58.698 --> 02:27:59.339]  Exactly.
[02:27:59.339 --> 02:28:00.620]  Exactly.
[02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:07.106]  That's the danger that this government can keep what they want for their purposes, but we the people can't know for our purposes.
[02:28:07.106 --> 02:28:14.433]  And all I'm asking is for a day in court, David, and I don't think that's too much to ask from the judicial system, but I'm getting impatient with their denial to allow me even that.
[02:28:15.242 --> 02:28:22.065]  Or even more importantly than your own personal preferences, if some agency were to come to a senator or to a judge.
[02:28:22.777 --> 02:28:30.544]  And say, we would like for you to give us carte blanche on this new legislation that we want to do, or this new power that we want to assume.
[02:28:30.544 --> 02:28:32.526]  And if you don't do it, we're going to expose you.
[02:28:32.526 --> 02:28:47.840]  That's the thing that concerns me the most, even more than the corruption of political favors, is the fact that we have very ambitious bureaucracies that are building their empires, and they can very easily blackmail these senators or presidents to do whatever they wish.
[02:28:48.843 --> 02:29:09.063]  Well, remember, when I was representing her, I not only subpoenaed the telephone companies, I subpoenaed the FBI, Department of State, Internal Revenue Service, Postal Inspection Service, the Director of National Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence, and 16 local D.C.
[02:29:09.063 --> 02:29:11.065]  law enforcement agencies, and the White House.
[02:29:12.271 --> 02:29:22.299]  And I think that illustrates the fact, you know, as we've got a clip that we're going to play coming up in the next segment, we're going to be talking to Wayne Madsen, who also knew the DC Madam and who investigated this.
[02:29:22.299 --> 02:29:24.801]  Wayne and I and Jean had dinner many times together, by the way.
[02:29:24.801 --> 02:29:25.681]  Yes, yes.
[02:29:25.681 --> 02:29:32.427]  And what one of the people in the clips says is, there wasn't any government program to take down prostitutes.
[02:29:32.427 --> 02:29:38.352]  There was a government program to take down Deborah Jean Palfrey because of what she knew about powerful people.
[02:29:38.652 --> 02:29:39.952]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:29:39.952 --> 02:29:42.653]  It's montgomeryblairsibley.com.
[02:29:42.653 --> 02:29:44.053]  Keep up with what he's going to be releasing.
[02:29:44.053 --> 02:29:46.114]  It's going to be a big release coming up next week.
[02:29:46.114 --> 02:29:47.674]  Thank you so much, Mr. Sibley.
[02:29:47.674 --> 02:29:49.575]  My pleasure, David.
[02:29:49.575 --> 02:29:50.635]  We'll be right back with Wayne Madsen.
[02:29:50.635 --> 02:29:51.976]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.976 --> 02:29:54.516]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.516 --> 02:29:57.177]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.294 --> 02:30:05.177]  The future of flawless skin, brought to you by the CIA.
[02:30:05.177 --> 02:30:10.121]  That's right, the CIA is funding a skincare product that collects your DNA.
[02:30:10.121 --> 02:30:17.927]  SkinCentral Sciences is a company with an innovative line of cosmetic products marketed as a way to erase blemishes and soften skin.
[02:30:17.927 --> 02:30:28.555]  Via patented technology, a thin outer layer of the skin is removed, revealing unique biomarkers that can be used for a variety of diagnostic tests, including DNA collection.
[02:30:28.775 --> 02:30:36.561]  According to The Intercept, the skincare startup has attracted interest and funding from In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA.
[02:30:36.561 --> 02:30:44.867]  In-Q-Tel provides venture funding to help grow tech firms that develop the technology that will support the mission of the CIA and other intelligence agencies.
[02:30:44.867 --> 02:30:54.454]  The CIA fund approached the company, saying the fund shares an interest in looking at DNA extraction using the method pioneered by SkinCentral Sciences.
[02:30:54.454 --> 02:30:56.856]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:31:01.132 --> 02:31:09.380]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[02:31:09.380 --> 02:31:10.601]  A 360 win.
[02:31:10.601 --> 02:31:17.167]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[02:31:17.167 --> 02:31:24.714]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:31:25.094 --> 02:31:30.176]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:31:30.176 --> 02:31:36.279]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:31:36.279 --> 02:31:44.063]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:31:44.063 --> 02:31:51.267]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:31:51.267 --> 02:31:52.067]  10% off on auto ship.
[02:31:52.227 --> 02:31:54.669]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:54.669 --> 02:31:56.671]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[02:31:56.671 --> 02:32:00.775]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[02:32:00.775 --> 02:32:04.298]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:04.298 --> 02:32:09.002]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth, and
[02:32:09.082 --> 02:32:09.562]  I don't know.
[02:32:30.712 --> 02:32:31.613]  Shower Filters.
[02:32:31.613 --> 02:32:33.334]  We're introducing the best yet.
[02:32:33.334 --> 02:32:37.416]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[02:32:37.416 --> 02:32:42.219]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[02:32:42.219 --> 02:32:49.303]  This new 4-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[02:32:49.303 --> 02:32:56.228]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping at InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139 to order your ProMax Shower Filter from ProPure today.
[02:33:03.878 --> 02:33:13.385]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:33:13.385 --> 02:33:14.966]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:33:14.966 --> 02:33:18.629]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:21.857 --> 02:33:23.258]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.258 --> 02:33:30.583]  I'm David Knight and we're going to be going to Wayne Madsen, certainly no stranger to the listeners of InfoWars, an excellent investigative journalist.
[02:33:30.583 --> 02:33:36.567]  I've seen him work firsthand at the Cebolla Creek Ranch after the death of Justice Scalia.
[02:33:36.567 --> 02:33:43.552]  He knew the DC Madam and we're going to talk to him as well as play a clip when Alex was on the Geraldo Show and they're talking about
[02:33:44.457 --> 02:33:46.037]  The death of the D.C.
[02:33:46.037 --> 02:33:46.838]  Madam.
[02:33:46.838 --> 02:33:48.158]  The suspicious circumstances.
[02:33:48.158 --> 02:33:55.119]  We're also going to talk to him about the data and what we just learned from Mr. Sibley, the lawyer of the D.C.
[02:33:55.119 --> 02:33:55.360]  Madam.
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:59.641]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know that we have DNA Force back.
[02:33:59.641 --> 02:34:03.021]  And not only is it back, but we've added a new ingredient to it.
[02:34:03.021 --> 02:34:05.262]  A new powerful ingredient, but it's the same price.
[02:34:05.262 --> 02:34:08.102]  It's now DNA Force Plus.
[02:34:08.102 --> 02:34:10.143]  It's back in stock, and of course, DNA Force itself
[02:34:10.703 --> 02:34:15.846]  It's loaded with a patented bio PQQ compound backed by 175 clinical studies.
[02:34:15.846 --> 02:34:17.547]  It's extremely hard to secure.
[02:34:17.547 --> 02:34:20.268]  That's why it goes in and out of stock so much.
[02:34:20.268 --> 02:34:25.371]  It's been out of sold out for months and we expect to sell out of this very quickly.
[02:34:25.371 --> 02:34:31.834]  So get your get your DNA Force now while it is available or sign up for AutoShip.
[02:34:31.834 --> 02:34:39.358]  That is a key thing to do for any of our products because all of them sell out but none of them I think sell out as quickly as DNA Force.
[02:34:39.798 --> 02:34:44.642]  And of course, these 175 clinical studies have associated it with nerve growth factor.
[02:34:44.642 --> 02:34:46.844]  That's why we talk about DNA force.
[02:34:46.844 --> 02:34:52.869]  If you look at the telomeres, it's one of the best ways to indicate somebody's real biological age.
[02:34:52.869 --> 02:34:54.290]  It's kind of like shoestrings.
[02:34:54.290 --> 02:34:59.214]  And the end of the shoestring, you know how you've got the little tip there that keeps the shoestring from unraveling?
[02:34:59.214 --> 02:35:04.419]  That's what the telomeres are on your DNA that keeps the DNA from starting to unravel.
[02:35:04.419 --> 02:35:07.982]  And so the length of those telomeres really are a good indicator of your
[02:35:08.522 --> 02:35:09.143]  That's right.
[02:35:30.078 --> 02:35:31.000]  Vitamin supplement.
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.182]  It's in a drink form.
[02:35:32.182 --> 02:35:36.569]  It's a very easy way to take a lot of vitamins.
[02:35:36.569 --> 02:35:38.332]  You don't have to swallow a lot of pills.
[02:35:38.332 --> 02:35:41.778]  You can get it in an easy, dissolvable format.
[02:35:41.778 --> 02:35:42.619]  There's a drink mix.
[02:35:43.695 --> 02:35:46.956]  It's very tasty and it's very easy to get a lot of vitamins.
[02:35:46.956 --> 02:35:53.718]  It's got vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine, folic acid, calcium, many, many others.
[02:35:53.718 --> 02:35:58.079]  All of these are plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:35:58.079 --> 02:36:06.801]  It's a very affordable way to get a broad-based supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body needs.
[02:36:06.801 --> 02:36:08.722]  Again, that is the Vitamin Mineral Fusion
[02:36:09.202 --> 02:36:14.906]  Drink Mix, that's at Infowarslife.com, and DNA Force is now back in stock.
[02:36:14.906 --> 02:36:26.112]  Joining us now is Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist based out of Washington, D.C., somebody who's had a lot of experience in and out of Washington and knows that place like the swamp that it is.
[02:36:26.112 --> 02:36:27.974]  Wayne, thanks for joining us.
[02:36:27.974 --> 02:36:29.194]  Hi, Dave.
[02:36:30.782 --> 02:36:37.896]  Yes, tell us your take on what's going on with this new aspect of the story of the DC Madam.
[02:36:37.896 --> 02:36:40.982]  You had knowledge of this at the time it happened about ten years ago.
[02:36:42.182 --> 02:36:56.333]  Yes, I do recall when Blair Sibley was issuing those subpoenas to all those federal agencies and also to the phone companies.
[02:36:56.333 --> 02:37:07.763]  I guess what I was not aware of then, and he just mentioned it, that Verizon did respond with the identities of the 815 owners of those cell phones.
[02:37:12.446 --> 02:37:36.475]  Now, I think I was the first to receive the CDs with the raw copies of Gene Palfrey's telephone records, and they included Verizon and the Bell Telephone Company at the time, Chesapeake and Potomac, or Bell Atlantic.
[02:37:39.316 --> 02:37:44.238]  I began to try to trace back some of those numbers.
[02:37:44.238 --> 02:37:52.340]  Now, also at the same time, Dan Moldea was doing the same thing.
[02:37:52.340 --> 02:38:02.664]  It turns out we were both working, but not together on the same team, but we were both doing this on behalf of Larry Flynn.
[02:38:03.704 --> 02:38:20.159]  And I went to the libraries in the area to look at the old Haines crisscross directories where you have a list of numbers and then you can track back to the person who had the telephone.
[02:38:20.159 --> 02:38:22.401]  Now these were only good for landlines.
[02:38:24.082 --> 02:38:28.005]  And marketers use those in the old days.
[02:38:28.005 --> 02:38:38.634]  And so I looked at those and it was a time-consuming effort, but it was quite clear that there were some numbers of interest.
[02:38:38.634 --> 02:38:51.886]  Now, I recall that one number that I pretty well locked in belonged to somebody who had been an official with Pat Robertson, the televangelist.
[02:38:52.787 --> 02:38:59.124]  Um, and another number went right back to the Centrix switch.
[02:39:00.336 --> 02:39:09.918]  of the Bush-Cheney transition team in 2000, which was located in the West Building in McLean, Virginia.
[02:39:09.918 --> 02:39:12.558]  Now, that's of interest.
[02:39:12.558 --> 02:39:25.361]  I didn't get anybody's name because it's the central switch you get to when you call Bush-Cheney transition team headquarters, but we do know that Ted Cruz was one of the lawyers
[02:39:26.101 --> 02:39:36.592]  For the Bush team and the Bush vs. Gore legal issues going on down in Florida at the time.
[02:39:36.592 --> 02:39:37.593]  Yes.
[02:39:37.593 --> 02:39:42.418]  And he was traveling back and forth because he had been with the Bush-Cheney campaign.
[02:39:42.418 --> 02:39:45.241]  He actually joined the Bush campaign in 1999 in Austin.
[02:39:47.948 --> 02:40:06.784]  Uh, so I would not be surprised whether there were calls from Ted Cruz to the escort service, either from his own cell phone or from Bush Cheney transition team headquarters at the West Building in McLean, Virginia.
[02:40:06.784 --> 02:40:06.984]  Now,
[02:40:08.065 --> 02:40:09.807]  I think that's kind of interesting.
[02:40:09.807 --> 02:40:22.899]  Now, aside from that, I used every source I had in the intelligence community and law enforcement to see if I could get outside of those numbers any names of interest.
[02:40:23.719 --> 02:40:42.130]  And I was told by people who were on the inside, I got to say that the reports that I issued on the DC Madam's clients resulted in a number of what I would say walks through the park by people at the CIA.
[02:40:44.371 --> 02:40:51.153]  When you know you're not being surveilled and this is where you leave your cell phone in the glove box of your car.
[02:40:51.153 --> 02:40:54.554]  But three names of interest that came up from these sources.
[02:40:54.554 --> 02:41:01.637]  Dick Cheney before he was Vice President, when he was the President of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown and Root.
[02:41:01.637 --> 02:41:06.238]  And when he lived in McLean, Virginia before he moved to Dallas.
[02:41:06.238 --> 02:41:10.980]  The late Senator Fred Thompson and the current Senator John McCain.
[02:41:12.762 --> 02:41:13.803]  Wow, that's big news.
[02:41:13.803 --> 02:41:14.703]  Yeah, I wasn't aware of that.
[02:41:14.703 --> 02:41:17.224]  Is that something that was not previously reported?
[02:41:17.224 --> 02:41:19.585]  No, I reported it.
[02:41:19.585 --> 02:41:22.547]  In those days, nobody was paying attention.
[02:41:22.547 --> 02:41:33.712]  You know, Gene Poffrey gave a partial list that Brian Ross at ABC News, and they said, oh, we looked through several of these records and we decided there were no names of interest.
[02:41:35.482 --> 02:41:54.751]  Basically, ABC rolled over on her, and in a typical fashion for the corporate media, they knew there were names on there, but in addition though... Presidential candidates, Senators, and Vice Presidents... And ABC News reporters is probably the real reason.
[02:41:54.751 --> 02:41:55.472]  Well, that's interesting.
[02:41:55.472 --> 02:41:57.092]  You know, I've got an article here, of course,
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:03.105]  We had Mr. Sibley saying that he was trying to get this information released going back to January.
[02:42:03.105 --> 02:42:11.895]  We know the Rubio campaign was shopping information around, alleging that Ted Cruz had been involved in things like this beginning of March.
[02:42:11.895 --> 02:42:14.157]  We also had Anonymous, which is hard to pin down.
[02:42:14.157 --> 02:42:14.658]  You don't know.
[02:42:14.658 --> 02:42:15.819]  Anybody can say they're anonymous.
[02:42:15.819 --> 02:42:17.181]  Anybody can put stuff out there.
[02:42:17.601 --> 02:42:27.432]  There's a report that they're threatening Ted Cruz, and there is a blogger, Marshall Reports, that claims that they have reversed some of these numbers to Cruz's private numbers.
[02:42:27.432 --> 02:42:31.857]  I'm not sure how they would have done that, but that's the buzz around this.
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:55.213]  I don't think it was you, but I think it was the other investigator that you mentioned said that he would have remembered if it had been any of the presidential candidates currently, except for Ted Cruz, who is not on the radar because he was part of, you know, he's a lawyer at a lower level working for the Bush administration at that time.
[02:42:55.213 --> 02:42:58.415]  He would not have drawn any attention to anybody looking at names.
[02:42:58.415 --> 02:43:00.937]  He's not a Fred Thompson or Senator McCain.
[02:43:01.417 --> 02:43:16.815]  Dan Molde has said, of the candidates for president, he would have known the names, of course, Bernie Sanders, of course, Donald Trump, and John Kasich, who was a Congressman.
[02:43:16.815 --> 02:43:20.440]  He was the Chairman of the Budget Committee at the time, so he's pretty well known.
[02:43:21.801 --> 02:43:28.265]  And I asked Jean Poffrey specifically, uh, Jean, you don't deal in any, uh, uh, cowboys.
[02:43:28.265 --> 02:43:29.566]  She said, no, only women.
[02:43:29.566 --> 02:43:35.510]  So, uh, that would ostensibly, uh, have, uh, let Hillary Clinton off the hook.
[02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:42.075]  Although I understand her appetites have gone, uh, in both directions over the years.
[02:43:42.495 --> 02:43:47.624]  Well, yeah, and I think Dan also mentioned her name as being one, of course, that he would have recognized at the time as well.
[02:43:47.624 --> 02:43:51.652]  Now, to a lot of people who think that this is not something that's important or something that we should be covering...
[02:43:52.233 --> 02:43:55.276]  Of course, it opens candidates up to blackmail.
[02:43:55.276 --> 02:44:08.206]  And we don't believe, many of us don't find it credible, that she and the other lady who was, I think, worked for her, worked in conjunction with her, that both committed suicide, we're told, by hanging.
[02:44:08.206 --> 02:44:19.655]  I want to play this clip where Alex Jones went on with Geraldo, and not only Alex Jones, but Geraldo and two other people there at Fox News were talking about this at the time.
[02:44:21.212 --> 02:44:22.433]  No, I'm not planning to commit suicide.
[02:44:22.433 --> 02:44:27.797]  I'm planning to go into court on April 7th and I plan on exposing the government in ways that, you know, I do not think they want me to expose them.
[02:44:51.175 --> 02:44:56.762]  Joining me now from Austin, Texas, the well-known radio host himself, the conspiracy theorist and documentary filmmaker Alex Jones.
[02:44:56.762 --> 02:45:03.171]  Alex interviewed Deborah Palfrey in March of this year when she told him what you just heard, that she would never commit suicide.
[02:45:03.171 --> 02:45:04.332]  So Alex, welcome.
[02:45:04.332 --> 02:45:05.314]  What do you think?
[02:45:05.314 --> 02:45:08.198]  Do you believe this to be as the authorities say it is?
[02:45:09.434 --> 02:45:11.815]  Geraldo, first off, thanks for having me on.
[02:45:11.815 --> 02:45:14.097]  She was a very nice lady, very genteel.
[02:45:14.097 --> 02:45:16.658]  There's no doubt in my mind that she was murdered.
[02:45:16.658 --> 02:45:18.359]  Let me just go through some of the basic evidence.
[02:45:18.359 --> 02:45:26.603]  She told me repeatedly on my radio show, and those interviews are posted at InfoWars.com in full, that she would never kill herself, that she wasn't planning to kill herself.
[02:45:26.603 --> 02:45:28.965]  I pressed her during breaks in front of the board ops.
[02:45:28.965 --> 02:45:30.326]  I said, listen, this is dangerous.
[02:45:30.326 --> 02:45:32.467]  You've got to say who these people were.
[02:45:32.467 --> 02:45:34.468]  Do you know?
[02:45:34.468 --> 02:45:35.648]  And she said, well, I'm not going to say.
[02:45:35.648 --> 02:45:36.849]  I just want this all to end.
[02:45:36.849 --> 02:45:38.210]  And I said, you've got to say.
[02:45:38.770 --> 02:45:40.091]  Uh, who it was, or you're not safe.
[02:45:40.091 --> 02:45:42.031]  She said, listen, I'll never kill myself.
[02:45:42.031 --> 02:45:43.992]  If they claim that, I was murdered.
[02:45:43.992 --> 02:45:46.993]  So, we have a tape of her saying she wouldn't commit suicide.
[02:45:46.993 --> 02:46:01.539]  Now, NBC in Florida, where she had a condo, is reporting that one of her friends, who was the manager of the high-rise condos, and he's on tape saying, two days before she was killed, before she died, she left to her mother's and said, look, I'm being followed.
[02:46:01.539 --> 02:46:03.580]  I think there's a contract out on me.
[02:46:03.580 --> 02:46:05.281]  I'm not gonna kill myself.
[02:46:05.281 --> 02:46:06.521]  This is on tape.
[02:46:06.521 --> 02:46:07.762]  Then you look at Brandi Britton.
[02:46:08.442 --> 02:46:11.705]  She was facing six months in jail last year.
[02:46:11.705 --> 02:46:13.166]  Shot her mouth off, Ms.
[02:46:13.166 --> 02:46:14.187]  Palfrey said, the D.C.
[02:46:14.187 --> 02:46:17.169]  Madam said, and said, I'm going to talk about who my Johns are.
[02:46:17.169 --> 02:46:18.210]  This is hypocritical.
[02:46:18.210 --> 02:46:19.050]  She was a professor.
[02:46:19.050 --> 02:46:21.232]  You know, she had a psychology degree.
[02:46:21.232 --> 02:46:22.433]  She was saying, this is hypocritical.
[02:46:22.433 --> 02:46:24.014]  I'm going to tell who my Johns were.
[02:46:24.014 --> 02:46:25.416]  And then she hangs herself.
[02:46:25.416 --> 02:46:27.637]  Number one, Geraldo, you've covered a lot of criminology.
[02:46:27.637 --> 02:46:29.919]  You know women don't normally hang themselves.
[02:46:29.919 --> 02:46:32.721]  First one of her girls kills herself.
[02:46:32.721 --> 02:46:34.182]  Now she kills herself.
[02:46:36.145 --> 02:46:36.706]  Exactly.
[02:46:36.706 --> 02:46:39.451]  And on top of it, in fact, 90% of women take pills.
[02:46:39.451 --> 02:46:40.313]  That's why they do it.
[02:46:40.313 --> 02:46:42.216]  Now, men shoot themselves and hang themselves.
[02:46:42.216 --> 02:46:46.844]  Now, on top of it, her mother said she was happy, saying she was going to fight it.
[02:46:46.844 --> 02:46:47.826]  Alex, let me take a break.
[02:46:49.093 --> 02:46:50.635]  Yeah, that's what they were saying at the time.
[02:46:50.635 --> 02:46:52.357]  And of course, that's what we're all concerned about.
[02:46:52.357 --> 02:47:05.531]  As I was talking to Mr. Sibley, the former lawyer of the DC Madam, what he was saying was, what if I had this information and I went to one of these powerful men and said, I want an appointment to West Point for my son.
[02:47:05.531 --> 02:47:07.834]  But you know, the thing that concerns me, as I said to him, was
[02:47:08.394 --> 02:47:24.870]  What if it's the CIA that has this information, or the NSA, or somebody who wants to not only just get personal favors, but they want to do something that is going to perhaps start a war, or alter our Constitution, and they blackmail a Supreme Court judge, or do something like that.
[02:47:24.870 --> 02:47:29.474]  That's why we have to be concerned about this, and that's why this information ought to be out there.
[02:47:29.474 --> 02:47:31.116]  These people are engaging in something.
[02:47:31.696 --> 02:47:38.218]  That supposedly a crime in D.C., it's treated that way, then this information ought to be out there.
[02:47:38.218 --> 02:47:50.223]  These are people who violated the current law, and if they're not prosecuting them, we ought to at least know who these powerful people are who could be blackmailed or turned to do whatever the people who have this information wish them to do.
[02:47:51.294 --> 02:48:01.627]  Well I believe the CIA does have the information because one of the odd things that Jean Palfrey did in her trial was she tried to invoke the Classified Information Procedures Act.
[02:48:01.627 --> 02:48:03.250]  Now when do you invoke that?
[02:48:03.250 --> 02:48:07.415]  Well you invoke it when you have signed a non-disclosure confidentiality
[02:48:07.415 --> 02:48:07.655]  I don't
[02:48:25.086 --> 02:48:31.971]  I want to say some things about who I was really working for here, but I need to be covered under my nondisclosure agreement.
[02:48:31.971 --> 02:48:40.557]  So I'm asking the court that I can now provide classified information in camera with the judge.
[02:48:40.557 --> 02:48:46.381]  And the court said, no, you cannot invoke the Classified Information Procedures Act.
[02:48:46.761 --> 02:48:47.101]  Why?
[02:48:47.101 --> 02:48:59.490]  Because when you look at some of these escorts that Jean Palfrey was running, you're not talking about barely English-speaking girls from Mexico or South Korea or Thailand.
[02:48:59.490 --> 02:49:04.934]  You're talking about Brandy Britton, a professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore campus.
[02:49:04.934 --> 02:49:09.337]  You're talking about a professor at the U.S.
[02:49:09.337 --> 02:49:11.579]  Naval Academy was one of her escorts.
[02:49:12.379 --> 02:49:17.901]  One of them was a 58-year-old psychiatrist in Montgomery County, Maryland.
[02:49:17.901 --> 02:49:19.881]  You know why she was using people like that?
[02:49:19.881 --> 02:49:31.924]  Because when they got with, say, a visiting foreign official, an oil minister, a foreign businessman, you know, their briefcases are available, their laptops are available.
[02:49:31.924 --> 02:49:34.425]  I would suggest that Jean Poffrey, and one of the
[02:49:34.445 --> 02:49:58.024]  The reason she was trying to leave to go move to an apartment in East Berlin, which she obtained for $70,000, it's pretty cheap, is she had a relationship with the former head of the CIA's logistics operations in Frankfurt, a guy named Kyle Dusty Fago, who also went to prison for fraud, and he eventually wound up as the executive director of the CIA.
[02:49:58.624 --> 02:50:02.327]  And of course we know that the NSA and the CIA have this information.
[02:50:02.327 --> 02:50:11.373]  If you go back to the Church Committee hearings, to the Pike Committee hearings that were happening at the same time, they were tapping people's phones, which is what they're doing right now.
[02:50:11.373 --> 02:50:14.916]  They created the FISA Act, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,
[02:50:15.456 --> 02:50:25.922]  In order to stop that kind of surveillance, but then they used the FISA Act to set up essentially a star chamber court that allowed them to get these broadcast search warrants.
[02:50:25.922 --> 02:50:27.483]  They're not specific to anybody.
[02:50:27.483 --> 02:50:33.607]  So we know that these intelligence services know this information on these politicians.
[02:50:33.607 --> 02:50:42.272]  We need to know which ones are compromised, because you just pointed out, if we've got people like Oliver North and John Poindexter running some kind of a secret war somewhere,
[02:50:42.452 --> 02:50:47.180]  We're going to go continue that secret war by blackmailing a senator that they have information on.
[02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:47.521]  Stay with us.
[02:50:47.521 --> 02:50:50.346]  We're going to be right back with investigative journalist Wayne Madsen.
[02:51:03.815 --> 02:51:07.017]  December 7th, 1941.

[02:54:09.793 --> 02:54:11.475]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:11.475 --> 02:54:13.677]  I'm David Knight with Wayne Madsen.
[02:54:13.677 --> 02:54:15.840]  We're going to go back to Wayne in just a moment.
[02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:20.004]  I do want to let you know that we have gotten back in stock DNA Force.
[02:54:20.004 --> 02:54:21.406]  It's now DNA Force Plus.
[02:54:21.406 --> 02:54:26.631]  It has a new ingredient, but it is still the same price that we've had available for a very long time.
[02:54:26.631 --> 02:54:26.831]  Again...
[02:54:27.392 --> 02:54:32.876]  DNA Force is loaded with a patented bio-PQQ compound backed by 175 clinical studies.
[02:54:32.876 --> 02:54:36.599]  Extremely hard to secure, that's why it comes and goes in stock.
[02:54:36.599 --> 02:54:42.263]  Very popular, even though it's one of our most premier supplements, it doesn't last very long.
[02:54:42.263 --> 02:54:48.868]  And that's because it's been associated with very important things for your health, for your biological age, nerve growth factor.
[02:54:48.868 --> 02:54:53.112]  Just one ingredient in DNA Force costs us about $30,000 per batch.
[02:54:53.112 --> 02:54:54.453]  We do have a batch back in now.
[02:54:55.033 --> 02:55:00.139]  It's hard to produce and we're going to run out pretty quickly, but it is back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[02:55:00.139 --> 02:55:04.323]  Also, we have the new product that we've just introduced, Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:55:04.323 --> 02:55:09.829]  That's a drink mix that we have put together, a platinum standard of multivitamin products.
[02:55:09.829 --> 02:55:15.155]  This is something that in a very easily digested, very easily, very available to your
[02:55:15.815 --> 02:55:17.256]  To your body to assimilate.
[02:55:17.256 --> 02:55:19.937]  It's a large assortment of multivitamins.
[02:55:19.937 --> 02:55:27.241]  Things like vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, magnesium, selenium, glutamine, folic acid, calcium, many, many other things.
[02:55:27.241 --> 02:55:29.182]  Great tasting, very affordable.
[02:55:29.182 --> 02:55:31.483]  That's vitamin mineral fusion drink.
[02:55:31.483 --> 02:55:35.485]  You'll find that also at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:55:35.485 --> 02:55:39.387]  Now Wayne, as we're looking at this, of course, the name that keeps coming up is Ted Cruz.
[02:55:39.387 --> 02:55:43.149]  And as I've said, when the National Enquirer made the allegations that they did,
[02:55:44.238 --> 02:56:01.292]  And he denied them, and I said, I find National Enquirer to be far more credible than Ted Cruz when we look at the things that he's done with Ben Carson, the reversals that he's had on so many different issues like Ed Snowden and privacy on the trade treaties and so forth.
[02:56:02.793 --> 02:56:05.315]  National Enquirer has done this many, many times.
[02:56:05.315 --> 02:56:08.858]  They have taken down people like Ed Snowden.
[02:56:08.858 --> 02:56:11.200]  I'm sorry, John Edwards.
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:12.300]  Too many Eds there.
[02:56:12.300 --> 02:56:13.321]  John Edwards.
[02:56:13.321 --> 02:56:16.524]  They've also Gary Hart, many others.
[02:56:16.524 --> 02:56:25.931]  And the issue with this, as we were just talking about, is the fact that you can not only show somebody to be a fraud, but you can make them into a complete laughing stock.
[02:56:25.931 --> 02:56:29.214]  I noticed that one of the names on here was Dick Morris, and I know that
[02:56:29.674 --> 02:56:33.859]  Rush Limbaugh used to troll him incessantly as the toesucker.
[02:56:33.859 --> 02:56:45.873]  That's just one thing right there that can just destroy somebody's reputation, even if they wouldn't normally be destroyed by the fact that they had visited a call girl.
[02:56:45.873 --> 02:56:49.117]  They might be embarrassed by the details that came out about that.
[02:56:50.103 --> 02:56:56.708]  Yeah, you know, there were so many aspects to this case that went far, actually beyond Washington.
[02:56:56.708 --> 02:56:59.250]  There was also a Baltimore aspect.
[02:56:59.250 --> 02:56:59.730]  The U.S.
[02:56:59.730 --> 02:57:07.436]  attorney for Maryland at the time and Baltimore, Tom Bigagio, was actually the first U.S.
[02:57:07.436 --> 02:57:13.141]  attorney fired after Bush's re-election.
[02:57:13.141 --> 02:57:16.824]  Reason being is he was looking at the involvement
[02:57:17.364 --> 02:57:40.498]  of then Republican Governor of Maryland Bob Ehrlich in this whole operation and that tied in with the limousine service called Shirlington Limo and Jack Abramoff and Randy Duke Cunningham from San Diego who went to jail representative and poker parties taking these escorts to poker parties at the Watergate Hotel
[02:57:41.478 --> 02:57:54.349]  And another Washington Hotel, and president of the poker party would be Randy Duke Cunningham, and none other than Porter Goss, the then-director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:57:54.349 --> 02:58:04.257]  So, you know, no wonder they killed Gene Palfrey, no wonder they killed Brandy Britton, because there were big heads going to roll there.
[02:58:04.257 --> 02:58:10.162]  And remember that Bush eventually demanded Porter Goss' resignation.
[02:58:11.222 --> 02:58:19.283]  I believe that that was not, for some other reason, than his involvement in those poker parties.
[02:58:19.283 --> 02:58:20.864]  We've got to take a break, but stay with us, Wayne.
[02:58:20.864 --> 02:58:32.866]  When we come back, I want to ask you where you think this is going to go, because we have seen, when National Enquirer has done this in the past, usually there is a drip, drip, drip of information that unfolds over a gradual process.
[02:58:32.866 --> 02:58:38.027]  And of course, I want to ask you about her lawyer, Sibley, saying that he's going to release information next week.
[02:58:38.027 --> 02:58:38.367]  Stay with us.
[02:58:38.367 --> 02:58:39.387]  We'll be right back with Wayne Madsen.

[03:00:18.348 --> 03:00:24.731]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:24.731 --> 03:00:26.412]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:26.412 --> 03:00:31.235]  I'm David Knight and with me still is Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com.
[03:00:31.235 --> 03:00:33.917]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[03:00:33.917 --> 03:00:36.298]  He's going to be with us throughout the fourth hour.
[03:00:36.298 --> 03:00:39.420]  Joe Biggs is going to be joining us at the bottom of the fourth hour.
[03:00:39.420 --> 03:00:42.102]  I want to go back to Wayne and kind of wrap this up now.
[03:00:43.157 --> 03:00:50.480]  Wayne, as we're looking at this, and of course, Mr. Sibley said that he is going to release some information next week.
[03:00:50.480 --> 03:00:51.601]  What's your sense of this?
[03:00:51.601 --> 03:00:56.022]  Do you think that the mainstream media is going to completely paper this over for Ted Cruz?
[03:00:56.022 --> 03:01:00.044]  I mean, we saw him meet with Megyn Kelly over the weekend.
[03:01:00.044 --> 03:01:08.247]  She appeared with him and her Prada heels, her $1,200 Pradas, and did a denial that he had ever cheated on his wife.
[03:01:08.247 --> 03:01:09.028]  Of course, this goes
[03:01:10.089 --> 03:01:15.417]  Earlier than the time in question is before he got married.
[03:01:15.417 --> 03:01:16.498]  How do you see this unfolding?
[03:01:16.498 --> 03:01:18.341]  Are they going to be able to cover this up?
[03:01:18.341 --> 03:01:24.410]  Or do you think this is going to be a drip-drip of continuing revelations from National Enquirer and from other sources?
[03:01:24.878 --> 03:01:27.019]  Well, notice how Cruz answered that question.
[03:01:27.019 --> 03:01:29.861]  He said, I've always been faithful to my wife.
[03:01:29.861 --> 03:01:33.863]  He didn't talk about what happened before they got married in 2001.
[03:01:33.863 --> 03:01:41.608]  We're talking about Bush-Cheney transition in December 2000 into January, and then the time he spent with the campaign before that.
[03:01:42.648 --> 03:01:50.654]  So, and then, you know, typical Cruz, when he's hit with something, he tried to attack the messenger.
[03:01:50.654 --> 03:01:58.320]  He referred to the name of the publisher of the National Enquirer and the other American media.
[03:01:58.820 --> 03:02:00.200]  And that's just it, Wayne.
[03:02:00.200 --> 03:02:01.561]  We don't know who the real Ted Cruz is.
[03:02:26.206 --> 03:02:26.767]  That's just it.
[03:02:26.767 --> 03:02:29.128]  We don't know who the real Ted Cruz is.
[03:02:29.128 --> 03:02:30.209]  Is this guy a Canadian?
[03:02:30.209 --> 03:02:31.089]  Is he an American?
[03:02:31.089 --> 03:02:35.572]  I mean, he was a Canadian citizen until after he became a senator.
[03:02:35.572 --> 03:02:38.693]  And then he got rid of his citizenship so he could run for president.
[03:02:38.693 --> 03:02:41.435]  I mean, everything about this guy from the get-go is phony.
[03:02:42.042 --> 03:02:44.923]  Yeah, I mean, my dad had a name for people like him.
[03:02:44.923 --> 03:02:46.984]  He's a four-flusher, you know.
[03:02:46.984 --> 03:02:58.527]  He's just, you know, the guy, he claims he's a great debater, yet he had to resort to making fun of somebody's last name in this interview with Megyn Kelly.
[03:02:58.527 --> 03:03:00.548]  But where do I think this is going?
[03:03:00.548 --> 03:03:07.490]  I think the mainstream media will eat around the edges like they did, you know, when I exposed Dennis Hastert.
[03:03:08.030 --> 03:03:17.256]  Now there's four, you know, others that come up and said, yeah, we were abused by him too, but back in 2006, no one was interested, and now they're all interested.
[03:03:17.256 --> 03:03:20.098]  That's right, you broke that way before anybody else did.
[03:03:20.098 --> 03:03:25.141]  Alex wasn't even comfortable going there with that information, but you were way ahead of the curve there.
[03:03:25.141 --> 03:03:30.684]  You got your ear to the ground as to what's going on in that swamp we call Washington, D.C.
[03:03:30.684 --> 03:03:33.906]  I guess, you know, Rome on the Potomac is what many people call it.
[03:03:33.906 --> 03:03:36.148]  It really is like Rome, like Caligula's Rome.
[03:03:37.221 --> 03:03:39.763]  It's a bad place.
[03:03:39.763 --> 03:03:51.888]  People may have their heroes in both parties, but over the years I've come to the realization that none of these guys or women walk on water.
[03:03:51.888 --> 03:03:54.009]  That's right.
[03:03:54.009 --> 03:03:58.111]  So we're going to see a lot more information, I think, come out.
[03:03:59.232 --> 03:04:07.207]  You know, with Ted Cruz, it's going to be his political demise by a thousand cuts.
[03:04:07.947 --> 03:04:09.248]  You know, and that's the thing.
[03:04:09.248 --> 03:04:22.914]  I mean, even if there is absolutely nothing to this story, to me, what he did to Ben Carson, his fellow Christian, for him to parade his piety in public, for him to say, he and his wife, our campaign is the face of God to America.
[03:04:22.914 --> 03:04:28.157]  As a Christian, I'm offended by what he has done that is known and made public.
[03:04:28.157 --> 03:04:31.099]  And this just brings up more issues to me.
[03:04:31.099 --> 03:04:34.880]  I saw the way that he diverted these questions about his natural-born citizenship.
[03:04:34.880 --> 03:04:35.721]  He didn't answer them.
[03:04:36.061 --> 03:04:37.922]  He said, hey, I'm a lawyer.
[03:04:37.922 --> 03:04:39.302]  I know these things.
[03:04:39.302 --> 03:04:41.823]  And so don't question me on this.
[03:04:41.823 --> 03:04:43.864]  He believes in the end justifies the means.
[03:04:43.864 --> 03:04:44.765]  That's right.
[03:04:44.765 --> 03:04:46.886]  I don't find any Christianity in that.
[03:04:46.886 --> 03:04:48.066]  No, no, absolutely not.
[03:04:48.066 --> 03:04:51.748]  Thank you so much, Wayne Madsen, wademansenreport.com.
[03:04:51.748 --> 03:04:52.228]  Stay with us.
[03:04:52.228 --> 03:04:55.809]  We're going to be talking to Paul Joseph Watson from London.
[03:04:55.809 --> 03:04:56.910]  Be right back after the break.
[03:05:01.024 --> 03:05:08.149]  Belgian authorities are still on the lookout for the infamous Man in the Hat, seen walking alongside the Brussels airport suicide bombers.
[03:05:08.149 --> 03:05:19.798]  According to a report in France's Le Monde newspaper, the Man in the Hat could be Naeem al-Hamed, who was born in Syria in 88 and arrived in Europe amongst the wave of refugees who entered via Greece last year.
[03:05:19.798 --> 03:05:28.284]  Al-Hamed arrived with Sofiane Ayari, another suspected Brussels terror plotter who was captured in a police raid, along with Paris massacre suspect Salah Abdeslam.
[03:05:28.464 --> 03:05:36.970]  And if Al-Hamid is not the man in the hat, he's still suspected to be an accomplice of a suicide bomber who blew himself up on the train at Malbik metro station.
[03:05:36.970 --> 03:05:48.017]  Back in December, ISIS bragged in its own manifesto of how it planned to exploit the refugee crisis in order to infiltrate jihadists and create Muslim no-go ghettos from where future attacks could be planned.
[03:05:48.017 --> 03:05:58.404]  The possibility of yet another jihadist exploiting the migrant crisis to enter Europe better put the pressure on governments to scale back these open border policies that have left the continent vulnerable to terrorists.

[03:06:00.145 --> 03:06:01.786]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:06:01.786 --> 03:06:02.346]  Good, brother.
[03:06:02.346 --> 03:06:04.307]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:06:04.307 --> 03:06:06.028]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:06:06.028 --> 03:06:10.070]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:12.672]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:06:12.672 --> 03:06:15.093]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:06:15.093 --> 03:06:23.037]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:06:23.257 --> 03:06:26.521]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[03:06:26.521 --> 03:06:28.043]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:06:28.043 --> 03:06:30.986]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[03:06:30.986 --> 03:06:32.728]  Saving a ton of money there.
[03:06:32.728 --> 03:06:38.094]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[03:06:38.114 --> 03:06:38.995]  We're good to go.
[03:07:00.692 --> 03:07:03.893]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[03:07:03.893 --> 03:07:06.253]  Deep Cleanse by Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:06.253 --> 03:07:13.255]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[03:07:18.576 --> 03:07:27.578]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[03:07:27.998 --> 03:07:36.860]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[03:07:36.860 --> 03:07:43.962]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[03:07:43.962 --> 03:07:49.323]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best
[03:07:49.503 --> 03:07:50.784]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[03:07:50.784 --> 03:07:52.166]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:07:52.166 --> 03:07:53.187]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[03:08:16.818 --> 03:08:21.639]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:08:21.639 --> 03:08:25.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:25.380 --> 03:08:30.060]  I'm David Knight and our host for this fourth hour is Paul Joseph Watson from London.
[03:08:30.060 --> 03:08:33.901]  I got an article from Nico, our producer here.
[03:08:33.901 --> 03:08:40.762]  He was saying that Paul had something about a European legislator, Paul, who was raped by a migrant but doesn't want this person deported.
[03:08:40.762 --> 03:08:43.183]  I mean, is this person from Stockholm?
[03:08:43.183 --> 03:08:45.263]  Is this a Stockholm syndrome that we're seeing here?
[03:08:46.581 --> 03:08:50.004]  Well, I mean, this is the point I've made over and over again, David.
[03:08:50.004 --> 03:09:06.616]  We had feminists in Cologne handing out roses to migrants at an asylum centre after the mass molestation of women on New Year's Eve, which now we know is confirmed was covered up by the police, just as they've been covering up these rapes for months and months.
[03:09:07.196 --> 03:09:12.359]  In their own words, so as to not legitimise critics of mass migration.
[03:09:12.359 --> 03:09:19.283]  They don't care about the victims, they don't care about the women being raped, they care about the perception, about the narrative.
[03:09:19.283 --> 03:09:23.225]  So now this has gone one step deeper into insanity.
[03:09:23.225 --> 03:09:24.866]  This is an article out of Breitbart.
[03:09:25.686 --> 03:09:30.991]  After anal rape, left-wing activist felt guilt and responsibility.
[03:09:30.991 --> 03:09:33.133]  His migrant attacker was deported.
[03:09:33.133 --> 03:09:43.802]  And it reads, a left-wing activist has bared all to a Norwegian documentary crew about his rape at the hands of a Somalian migrant and his despair at seeing the man deported.
[03:09:43.802 --> 03:09:52.209]  This is an active member of the Norwegian Socialist Left Party who described himself as an ardent feminist and anti-racist
[03:09:52.990 --> 03:09:58.192]  ...explained the difficulty he experienced accepting that he had been anally raped by a male migrant.
[03:09:58.192 --> 03:10:04.695]  He said he didn't blame the man for the attack and regretted the fact that he had been sent back to Somalia.
[03:10:04.695 --> 03:10:12.899]  And we've seen this before, in Sweden especially, there was a woman on a train who got raped by a couple of Iraqi migrants.
[03:10:13.559 --> 03:10:21.588]  She felt guilty because she said that they had been traumatized and so it kind of entitled them to rape her.
[03:10:21.588 --> 03:10:28.576]  And she didn't initially report it to police because she feared that these rapists, being migrants, would be deported.
[03:10:29.036 --> 03:10:31.699]  So it's an almost identical situation.
[03:10:31.699 --> 03:10:38.886]  Again, it's about this man putting himself on trial for his own white guilt, even though he's the victim of this attack.
[03:10:38.886 --> 03:10:42.170]  And you mentioned Stockholm Syndrome.
[03:10:42.170 --> 03:10:43.431]  That's exactly what it is.
[03:10:43.431 --> 03:10:46.654]  There's another psychological phenomenon which is similar called
[03:10:47.415 --> 03:10:49.657]  Traumatic bonding.
[03:10:49.657 --> 03:10:59.766]  And that's when a victim adopts the same values of the aggressor, because if they do so, the aggressor ceases to be perceived as a threat.
[03:10:59.766 --> 03:11:11.036]  So, you know, instead of accepting the reality of the problem that we have to face up to this, that we're importing this terrible culture, this actual rape culture, we're importing it into Europe, into the West.
[03:11:11.736 --> 03:11:16.599]  It's easier to deny it by just identifying with the perpetrator.
[03:11:16.599 --> 03:11:21.503]  Which is now, we've seen in all these situations, they say, well, they were traumatized.
[03:11:21.503 --> 03:11:26.366]  I mean, you can understand why they would want to rape us and we should feel guilty about it.
[03:11:26.366 --> 03:11:28.127]  Complete mental illness.
[03:11:28.127 --> 03:11:30.268]  Complete Stockholm Syndrome.
[03:11:30.268 --> 03:11:36.533]  And when most of the victims in these cases are young children, as we saw again in Germany a couple of days ago,
[03:11:37.113 --> 03:11:46.679]  We have to reject this ridiculous notion that somehow these individuals are entitled to rape women, men and children because they're traumatized.
[03:11:46.679 --> 03:11:47.880]  It's completely ludicrous.
[03:11:47.880 --> 03:11:49.181]  You're talking about these young children.
[03:11:49.181 --> 03:11:58.707]  That was something that really, really profoundly disturbed my wife to see that video of that migrant who was holding that baby and threatening to throw that baby and shaking the baby and everything.
[03:11:59.307 --> 03:12:06.273]  This is what we're seeing on the other side, in terms of people waking up and understanding that there's something insane here.
[03:12:06.273 --> 03:12:17.822]  I've heard multiple people, not just calling in to our program, calling in to when we're doing the debates, but I've also heard people calling in to local talk radio, people who are coming from Central and South America saying,
[03:12:18.843 --> 03:12:27.578]  I like Trump because I don't want a lot of these bad people that I'm running away from in these other countries to be able to follow me into this country.
[03:12:27.578 --> 03:12:28.940]  I want something done about this.
[03:12:28.940 --> 03:12:30.243]  I want these people vetted.
[03:12:32.148 --> 03:12:45.891]  Yeah, and if you look at the polls when Rubio was still in the race back a few weeks ago, Donald Trump had more support amongst Muslims in America than all the other GOP candidates combined.
[03:12:45.891 --> 03:12:53.912]  Obviously not a lot of Muslims are going to vote for him in the first place because generally people from those areas of the world are dependent on government.
[03:12:53.912 --> 03:12:58.713]  They vote for an expansion of the welfare state so they're more likely to support Democrats.
[03:12:58.713 --> 03:13:01.094]  But amongst the Muslims who are Republicans,
[03:13:02.094 --> 03:13:06.398]  Again, Trump had more support from Muslims than all the other candidates combined.
[03:13:06.398 --> 03:13:20.151]  And it's because the ones who have assimilated, and that's the only way that it works, is to bring in skilled migrants at a slow pace, not 300,000 a year like we do in Britain.
[03:13:20.151 --> 03:13:21.152]  That's when it works.
[03:13:21.152 --> 03:13:23.094]  That's when they build businesses.
[03:13:23.094 --> 03:13:24.775]  They become assimilated.
[03:13:24.775 --> 03:13:26.317]  They adopt American values.
[03:13:26.897 --> 03:13:33.261]  They want to pursue happiness, you know, build wealth, have happy families, and actually integrate into society.
[03:13:33.261 --> 03:13:48.111]  And when they do that, they look back to the countries where they came from, these police state hellholes which have an incredibly low standard of living, and they say, we don't want to import hundreds of thousands of people from North Africa and the Middle East.
[03:13:49.352 --> 03:13:53.596]  We will become like North Africa and the Middle East, because they don't assimilate.
[03:13:53.596 --> 03:13:55.819]  The pace of immigration is so fast.
[03:13:55.819 --> 03:13:59.142]  There is no, you know, program of assimilation.
[03:13:59.142 --> 03:14:00.403]  There isn't in Europe.
[03:14:00.403 --> 03:14:05.669]  And that's why they turn Europe into North Africa and the Middle East, because they create these ghettos.
[03:14:06.349 --> 03:14:06.749]  Exactly.
[03:14:06.749 --> 03:14:09.750]  They self-ghettoize because they bring in so many people at a time.
[03:14:09.750 --> 03:14:11.870]  That's the core issue.
[03:14:11.870 --> 03:14:16.691]  By bringing them in, in the large groups, just like you said, they create ghettos because they self-ghettoize.
[03:14:16.691 --> 03:14:24.873]  If they have a large enough group of people that come in together, they don't want to mix with the population that's already there.
[03:14:24.873 --> 03:14:29.454]  They don't adopt the legal cultural language of that nation.
[03:14:29.454 --> 03:14:31.895]  They stay within that small area and I think it makes it
[03:14:32.515 --> 03:14:34.475]  More easy for them to radicalize.
[03:14:34.475 --> 03:14:49.018]  Of course, you know, when you've got a large number of people coming in as well, if you've only got, as we've mentioned before, doing the math, looking at the number of people that have come into Europe, if you only have one-tenth of one percent, you've got hundreds or thousands of people who are radical jihadists who could come in.
[03:14:49.018 --> 03:15:01.321]  Even though you've got 99.9% of the people that are okay, you've still got, if you've got a massive number of people, you've still got a significant number of people who are radicals, and those radicals can easily radicalize the second generation.
[03:15:01.621 --> 03:15:03.442]  Who doesn't really understand what's going on with this.
[03:15:03.442 --> 03:15:04.843]  They didn't see the previous country.
[03:15:04.843 --> 03:15:13.890]  All they know is that they grew up in this ghetto and they're resentful of the outside culture that they've never been really allowed to mix with.
[03:15:15.404 --> 03:15:24.431]  Well that's exactly right, and again you saw today yet another one of the individuals involved in plotting the Brussels bombing was a Syrian refugee.
[03:15:24.431 --> 03:15:27.913]  He came in from Syria through Greece into Europe.
[03:15:27.913 --> 03:15:33.918]  So of course a percentage of these individuals, if you import them in such vast numbers, are going to be jihadists.
[03:15:34.338 --> 03:15:49.345]  And with the ghettos, in fact ISIS said in its own manifesto, which was released back in December, that they're going to exploit this migrant wave to create those ghettos because they're the perfect breeding ground for radicalisation.
[03:15:49.345 --> 03:15:52.007]  And you saw that with Salah Abdeslam.
[03:15:52.007 --> 03:15:56.349]  Of course he hid out in Molenbeek for three months after the Paris massacre.
[03:15:56.929 --> 03:16:04.573]  And he was able to do so because he was protected by his friends and neighbours, which is the point I make over and over again.
[03:16:04.573 --> 03:16:07.955]  The problem we have isn't just with jihadists.
[03:16:07.955 --> 03:16:17.020]  Yes, a tiny percentage of Muslims are actually jihadists, but a whole bigger percentage of Muslims are Islamists.
[03:16:17.580 --> 03:16:29.752]  So they will give protection to jihadists to force their brand of Islam on the world, and that's what happened in Molenbeek when they protected, you know, Abdeslam, the Paris Massacre.
[03:16:29.752 --> 03:16:31.294]  He was involved in the Paris Massacre.
[03:16:31.294 --> 03:16:33.836]  You're talking about somebody's particular brand of Islam.
[03:16:33.836 --> 03:16:39.022]  One of the callers that we had during one of the debates said, look, I'm Muslim and I support Donald Trump because I'm concerned
[03:16:39.642 --> 03:16:39.902]  About
[03:16:59.091 --> 03:17:00.692]  There were going to be Wahhabis coming in.
[03:17:00.692 --> 03:17:04.555]  So he wanted some kind of vetting of the number of people that were coming in.
[03:17:04.555 --> 03:17:11.160]  He didn't want the gates just opened up to allow masses of unvetted people to come in and that's what Donald Trump has been talking about.
[03:17:11.160 --> 03:17:17.565]  It's betrayed and spawned by the media to say he's against all Muslims and that's not what he's saying and that's not what the Muslims are saying.
[03:17:17.565 --> 03:17:22.309]  They're saying we want to know who is coming in and making sure that this isn't what's happening.
[03:17:23.567 --> 03:17:28.790]  Well yeah, the voices of reform within Islam always get intimidated and drowned out.
[03:17:28.790 --> 03:17:32.433]  I mean, you can look at Majid Nawaz and people like that.
[03:17:32.433 --> 03:17:34.634]  They're trying to reform Islam from the inside.
[03:17:34.634 --> 03:17:36.855]  They're getting drowned out by Islamists.
[03:17:36.855 --> 03:17:38.777]  And then back to the point about ghettos.
[03:17:39.517 --> 03:17:43.180]  If you look at the statistics, I mean, it's absolutely shocking.
[03:17:43.180 --> 03:17:48.664]  You can look at Belgium, for example, which has a Muslim population of around 6%.
[03:17:48.664 --> 03:17:53.988]  The prison population of Belgium, given that its Muslim population is just 6%, is 45% Muslim.
[03:17:57.450 --> 03:18:04.157]  So they're grossly over-represented, because again, they get sucked into these hopeless ghettos, they commit petty crimes.
[03:18:04.157 --> 03:18:04.877]  But it gets worse.
[03:18:04.877 --> 03:18:07.020]  You can look at France.
[03:18:07.020 --> 03:18:09.001]  6-10% Muslim population.
[03:18:09.001 --> 03:18:13.666]  Muslims make up 70% of prisoners in France.
[03:18:13.666 --> 03:18:15.067]  Same stats for Spain.
[03:18:16.008 --> 03:18:18.930]  Muslim population 3.7%.
[03:18:18.930 --> 03:18:22.011]  Yeah, the prison population of Spain is 70%.
[03:18:22.011 --> 03:18:26.194]  That's 70, not 17.
[03:18:26.194 --> 03:18:27.194]  70% Muslim.
[03:18:27.194 --> 03:18:29.515]  So obviously this isn't working, right?
[03:18:29.515 --> 03:18:31.236]  They're creating these ghettos.
[03:18:31.236 --> 03:18:33.638]  They're getting sucked into this hopeless life.
[03:18:33.638 --> 03:18:37.720]  They're committing petty crime because they're not being assimilated.
[03:18:37.720 --> 03:18:42.923]  Yet we still have this ludicrous open border policy by European leaders.
[03:18:42.923 --> 03:18:44.964]  They've now said they're going to double down on it.
[03:18:45.484 --> 03:18:47.525]  And it's clearly failed.
[03:18:47.525 --> 03:18:50.785]  It's failed in terms of social cohesion.
[03:18:50.785 --> 03:18:54.626]  It's failed in terms of putting Europe's security at risk.
[03:18:54.626 --> 03:19:02.208]  All of these individuals involved in Paris and Brussels, either they were supposedly assimilated or they came in as refugees.
[03:19:02.208 --> 03:19:05.749]  So either way you look at it, it's just not working and it's a big threat.
[03:19:06.923 --> 03:19:21.691]  Yeah, when we look at the political parties throughout Europe that have risen up to try to take back their sovereignty from the European Union, of course we have the Brexit that's coming up, whether or not Britain is going to exit the EU.
[03:19:21.691 --> 03:19:24.273]  I'm curious as to what your take is on that, Paul.
[03:19:24.273 --> 03:19:25.754]  How do you see that playing out?
[03:19:25.754 --> 03:19:28.275]  Do you think that that's going to prevail?
[03:19:28.275 --> 03:19:29.936]  It's coming up pretty soon, isn't it?
[03:19:31.516 --> 03:19:33.436]  It's coming up in June.
[03:19:33.436 --> 03:19:48.219]  I think if it looks like the lead vote is going to win, they'll probably try and pull some shenanigans, because that would deal such a massive blow to this multi-decade project, which started way back in the 50s with the Bilderberg Group, of course.
[03:19:48.219 --> 03:19:52.220]  They planned the single currency, which only came into fruition in the 90s.
[03:19:52.220 --> 03:19:54.181]  Stay with us, we've got to take a quick break.
[03:19:54.181 --> 03:19:56.941]  I want to know what you have to say about the Brexit.
[03:19:56.941 --> 03:19:59.542]  It's all part of the globalist consolidation.
[03:19:59.542 --> 03:20:01.002]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:01.775 --> 03:20:08.325]  Men, if you're like me, you appreciate the feeling of a clean, smooth shave from a quality blade.
[03:20:09.079 --> 03:20:12.902]  The sort of shave that cuts clean, without the burn.
[03:20:12.902 --> 03:20:23.429]  So, why are you messing around with generic razors that cost $32 for an 8-pack, when you can shave with Harry's high-quality German-engineered blades for half the price?
[03:20:23.429 --> 03:20:35.118]  And if saving money and a clean shave isn't incentive enough, Harry's will give you their starter set, complete with a razor, three of their world-famous blades, and shaving cream for just $15.
[03:20:35.118 --> 03:20:36.699]  And shipping is always free.

[03:22:01.002 --> 03:22:05.186]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[03:22:05.186 --> 03:22:11.392]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[03:22:11.392 --> 03:22:13.133]  How is this even possible?
[03:22:13.133 --> 03:22:20.440]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:22:20.680 --> 03:22:28.647]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[03:22:28.647 --> 03:22:33.010]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[03:22:33.010 --> 03:22:41.778]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[03:22:41.778 --> 03:22:43.359]  But you must act fast.
[03:22:43.359 --> 03:22:47.903]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[03:22:48.183 --> 03:22:52.448]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.

[03:24:11.512 --> 03:24:12.754]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:12.754 --> 03:24:16.397]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[03:24:16.397 --> 03:24:19.920]  We're going to be joined by Joe Biggs in the next segment.
[03:24:19.920 --> 03:24:23.363]  Before we go back to Paul, I just want to let you know that we have Secret 12.
[03:24:23.363 --> 03:24:27.247]  That's our vitamin B12 is back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[03:24:27.247 --> 03:24:28.428]  Again, it's one of the
[03:24:29.028 --> 03:24:34.290]  Products that we had run out of stock, but it is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:24:34.290 --> 03:24:39.992]  Combines the two ultra bio available forms of vitamin B12 into a single bottle.
[03:24:39.992 --> 03:24:42.013]  And the best part, there's no injections.
[03:24:42.013 --> 03:24:44.734]  Just put it under your tongue, leave it there for a while, and swallow it.
[03:24:45.394 --> 03:24:55.161]  Nothing could be easier, but you get the same benefit as if you're taking this high-quality vitamin B12 supplement in a more, let's call it, painful form.
[03:24:55.161 --> 03:24:56.962]  Nobody likes to get stuck with a needle.
[03:24:56.962 --> 03:24:57.943]  So you don't have to do that.
[03:24:57.943 --> 03:25:03.106]  You can just take it in a very easily available, bioavailable form, in a liquid form.
[03:25:03.106 --> 03:25:05.167]  That's our Vitamin B12 Secret 12.
[03:25:05.167 --> 03:25:08.169]  That's now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:25:09.670 --> 03:25:28.835]  Paul, we were talking before we went to the break about the Brexit, and of course, and I'm curious with all the parties that are picking up in popularity there because they're opposing the open borders, here what we're seeing with Donald Trump that I think is so valuable is he's the only candidate that's here in America that is opposing not only the trade treaties,
[03:25:29.395 --> 03:25:29.715]  I think so.
[03:25:46.140 --> 03:26:00.311]  A predecessor to coming in and having a political consolidation and they use economic crisis as they've talked about possibly doing some kind of a move just before the Brexit vote that was leaked by WikiLeaks.
[03:26:00.311 --> 03:26:07.337]  Some private correspondents there that was going on between the IMF and some people in Greece threatening them with an event.
[03:26:07.857 --> 03:26:12.199]  And talking about how they might want to do that just before Britain decides whether or not it's going to leave the EU.
[03:26:12.199 --> 03:26:14.800]  So we have these economic treaties that bring things together.
[03:26:14.800 --> 03:26:17.282]  We have the open borders that directly affect our sovereignty.
[03:26:17.282 --> 03:26:24.645]  But then they use the economic issues, these climate treaties and these trade treaties to also attack our sovereignty.
[03:26:24.645 --> 03:26:30.628]  Is there anybody in the UK or in Europe that is opposed to all three of these tactics?
[03:26:32.503 --> 03:26:33.904]  Yeah, there are several parties.
[03:26:33.904 --> 03:26:36.586]  I mean, for the past two years they've been having great success.
[03:26:36.586 --> 03:26:40.089]  There was a party in Germany recently that had a lot of success.
[03:26:40.089 --> 03:26:45.573]  Sweden and Denmark as well, of course, as a UKIP in the United Kingdom.
[03:26:45.573 --> 03:26:49.616]  But as you said, the migrant crisis was a kind of reaction to that.
[03:26:49.616 --> 03:26:55.281]  We had these conservative political parties sweeping to victories a couple of years ago.
[03:26:55.281 --> 03:26:59.964]  The reaction to that was to bring in all these millions of people now.
[03:26:59.964 --> 03:27:02.086]  It's up to over a million just in Germany alone.
[03:27:02.606 --> 03:27:07.008]  Who will become dependent on government and they will vote for bigger government.
[03:27:07.008 --> 03:27:08.748]  That's the point about this.
[03:27:08.748 --> 03:27:16.191]  Every time you poll people from these areas of the world and you ask them, do you support smaller or bigger government?
[03:27:16.191 --> 03:27:23.113]  Always the vast majority say they support bigger government because they're quite poor and they want to vote for more welfare.
[03:27:23.113 --> 03:27:28.595]  So that's why big government has an incentive to bring them into the country.
[03:27:28.595 --> 03:27:29.496]  Then of course you've got this
[03:27:30.484 --> 03:27:40.928]  narrative which we have in Germany, which is, oh, the German population is dying, we need immigrants to act as cheap labour, otherwise the economy's going to grind to a halt.
[03:27:40.928 --> 03:27:42.628]  It's just absolute BS.
[03:27:42.628 --> 03:27:51.812]  I mean, you can look at Germany and you can look at Sweden, for example, where 58% of the welfare payments in Sweden go to immigrants.
[03:27:52.592 --> 03:28:01.517]  Again, given that immigrants are still a relatively small number in the population, 58% of welfare payments are going to immigrants.
[03:28:01.517 --> 03:28:06.159]  So they're not doing the jobs that other people don't want to do.
[03:28:06.159 --> 03:28:10.102]  48% of immigrants in Sweden of working age don't work.
[03:28:10.862 --> 03:28:21.436]  So this argument that you need to bring in these millions of people to do cheap labour just doesn't stand up to the test, because they're not doing labour, they're sucking off the state.
[03:28:21.436 --> 03:28:27.064]  And then they vote for more state, for bigger government, which is why the government wants to bring them in.
[03:28:27.064 --> 03:28:28.606]  That's the whole agenda behind this.
[03:28:28.846 --> 03:28:42.704]  It's kind of funny because you know they're looking at this and saying, hey we've got this population demographics issue, you people want to retire, we've got a kind of a social security system, a social net here, but there's not enough people to support you so we've got to bring in these populations.
[03:28:42.704 --> 03:28:43.785]  And you know Paul, I'm reminded
[03:28:44.386 --> 03:28:50.310]  That it was Germany and it was Bismarck who created the first social security template.
[03:28:50.310 --> 03:28:56.034]  He picked the age of 65 because that was the life expectancy of the German people.
[03:28:56.034 --> 03:28:59.016]  It has always been a lie.
[03:28:59.016 --> 03:29:01.958]  And they keep moving that age as life expectancy goes up.
[03:29:01.958 --> 03:29:06.782]  They say, hey, we got a solvency issue because we never really expected to pay people any benefits here.
[03:29:06.782 --> 03:29:10.224]  Now that they're living longer, we got to change that age of withdrawal.
[03:29:10.224 --> 03:29:11.405]  But now they've got a new lie.
[03:29:11.465 --> 03:29:18.987]  And they're going to take care of you by importing people who have absolutely no connection to you, to your culture, to your language, to your country.
[03:29:18.987 --> 03:29:22.787]  And of course, they're going to pay heavy taxes to support your retirement.
[03:29:22.787 --> 03:29:25.208]  What a lie!
[03:29:25.208 --> 03:29:25.788]  Well, stay with us.
[03:29:25.788 --> 03:29:29.589]  We're going to come back with Paul Joseph Watson and with Joe Biggs.
[03:29:29.589 --> 03:29:39.191]  He's going to be joining us right after the break to talk about a new Sesame Street character, a hijab-clad Muppet from Afghanistan.
[03:29:39.191 --> 03:29:39.751]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:50.464 --> 03:29:54.392]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.392 --> 03:29:57.057]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.155 --> 03:30:05.058]  The future of flawless skin, brought to you by the CIA.
[03:30:05.058 --> 03:30:10.001]  That's right, the CIA is funding a skincare product that collects your DNA.
[03:30:10.001 --> 03:30:17.787]  SkinCentral Sciences is a company with an innovative line of cosmetic products marketed as a way to erase blemishes and soften skin.
[03:30:17.787 --> 03:30:28.415]  Via patented technology, a thin outer layer of the skin is removed, revealing unique biomarkers that can be used for a variety of diagnostic tests, including DNA collection.
[03:30:28.655 --> 03:30:36.437]  According to The Intercept, the skincare startup has attracted interest and funding from In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA.
[03:30:36.437 --> 03:30:44.739]  In-Q-Tel provides venture funding to help grow tech firms that develop the technology that will support the mission of the CIA and other intelligence agencies.
[03:30:44.739 --> 03:30:54.321]  The CIA fund approached the company, saying the fund shares an interest in looking at DNA extraction using the method pioneered by SkinCentral Sciences.
[03:30:54.321 --> 03:30:56.702]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:31:01.198 --> 03:31:01.859]  Uh, yeah.
[03:31:01.859 --> 03:31:07.683]  First of all, I want to say, Bigfoot 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[03:31:07.683 --> 03:31:08.643]  I use them all.
[03:31:08.643 --> 03:31:09.624]  They're phenomenal.
[03:31:09.624 --> 03:31:10.365]  They work.
[03:31:10.365 --> 03:31:11.205]  Buy them, folks.
[03:31:11.205 --> 03:31:11.626]  Thank you, brother.
[03:31:11.626 --> 03:31:13.607]  I want to thank you guys for putting those out there.
[03:31:13.607 --> 03:31:19.831]  I am a relatively short-time listener and quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[03:31:19.831 --> 03:31:21.813]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[03:31:21.813 --> 03:31:27.237]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[03:31:27.677 --> 03:31:28.378]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[03:31:28.378 --> 03:31:33.083]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, CoqFX, uh, nascent... Mike, let me ask you a question.
[03:31:33.083 --> 03:31:34.124]  Have they worked for you?
[03:31:34.124 --> 03:31:36.967]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[03:31:36.967 --> 03:31:38.048]  What products are you taking?
[03:31:38.048 --> 03:31:46.637]  Are you taking... Everything from, uh, Super Male to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2, even got a little, uh, DNA Force, so... Nice.
[03:31:46.637 --> 03:31:49.820]  And I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[03:31:49.960 --> 03:31:55.003]  Visit Infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[03:31:55.003 --> 03:32:00.926]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:32:00.926 --> 03:32:11.472]  You're investing in your health and supporting the Infowar when you visit Infowarslife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine and all the great products at Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:11.472 --> 03:32:17.376]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[03:32:17.376 --> 03:32:19.437]  Iodine is key, is paramount,
[03:32:19.557 --> 03:32:24.602]  And there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[03:32:24.602 --> 03:32:33.550]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:37.454]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[03:32:37.454 --> 03:32:40.296]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[03:32:40.296 --> 03:32:44.360]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[03:32:44.500 --> 03:32:45.261]  We're good to go.
[03:33:04.454 --> 03:33:08.037]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:33:08.037 --> 03:33:12.199]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:16.380 --> 03:33:17.881]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.881 --> 03:33:23.563]  I'm David Knight, and here in Austin with me is Joe Biggs, and we've got Paul Joseph Watson on the line from the UK.
[03:33:23.563 --> 03:33:29.186]  Joe is here to talk about a new story that we have up about a new Sesame Street character.
[03:33:29.186 --> 03:33:35.189]  This is a hijab-clad Muppet, Zari, a feminist from Afghanistan.
[03:33:35.189 --> 03:33:39.851]  I guess, Joe, when I look at this, I think an Islamic feminist is something of an oxymoron.
[03:33:40.611 --> 03:33:43.052]  I mean, look, I've been to Afghanistan.
[03:33:43.052 --> 03:33:47.074]  I've seen firsthand how they treat women, how they treat these children.
[03:33:47.074 --> 03:33:48.995]  It's completely and totally ridiculous.
[03:33:48.995 --> 03:33:54.898]  I'm all for empowering women over in the Middle East, that's great, but first you have to change their ideologies.
[03:33:54.898 --> 03:33:55.618]  They need to come into 2016.
[03:33:57.199 --> 03:34:08.315]  If you teach a young generation of Afghani females to empower themselves, to stand up to these men, there's going to be mass mutilations, there's going to be mass killings.
[03:34:08.315 --> 03:34:09.938]  They don't play games around there.
[03:34:09.938 --> 03:34:13.402]  You have to first change this radical Islamic ideology.
[03:34:13.883 --> 03:34:16.847]  And then you can bring in some of this female empowerment.
[03:34:16.847 --> 03:34:18.669]  But I think this is ridiculous.
[03:34:18.669 --> 03:34:23.816]  Is Sesame Street going to be held accountable when these young girls grow up and they start back talking to these guys?
[03:34:23.816 --> 03:34:25.878]  I'm not saying that's right, but this is reality.
[03:34:25.878 --> 03:34:27.741]  This is what's going to happen.
[03:34:27.741 --> 03:34:28.842]  I've been to Afghanistan.
[03:34:28.842 --> 03:34:29.623]  I've been to Iraq.
[03:34:29.623 --> 03:34:31.646]  I've been into other countries I can't name.
[03:34:31.966 --> 03:34:32.606]  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[03:34:51.804 --> 03:34:53.305]  That's not going to be good.
[03:34:53.305 --> 03:34:54.607]  And when is that going to happen?
[03:34:54.607 --> 03:34:59.151]  When is this character going to get leaked into the American version of Sesame Street?
[03:34:59.151 --> 03:35:03.295]  They're saying right now this is only going to be in Afghanistan, which is already dangerous enough.
[03:35:03.295 --> 03:35:04.796]  Then you bring that over here.
[03:35:04.796 --> 03:35:05.977]  What's going to happen then?
[03:35:05.977 --> 03:35:11.022]  Oh yeah, I think it's not going to be very long before they introduce it into the American version of Sesame Street.
[03:35:11.022 --> 03:35:12.243]  Paul, your comments on that?
[03:35:14.028 --> 03:35:20.312]  Well, Joe mentioned the article, and it's out of the New York Post, there are Muslim men fighting for the right to kill their wives.
[03:35:20.312 --> 03:35:32.661]  They're actually having to pass a law in Pakistan which says that it's not your right within your own private home to physically abuse and kill your wife in an honour killing.
[03:35:33.021 --> 03:35:41.925]  They're actually having to pass a law in Pakistan to ban that, and there's this huge campaign against it by these Islamists again.
[03:35:41.925 --> 03:35:53.009]  And if you read the article, it states, they've deemed the bill un-Islamic, contradictory to the verses of the Quran, in an attempt to secularize or westernize Pakistan.
[03:35:53.009 --> 03:35:57.511]  So again, they cite the Quran in justifying their quote, right,
[03:35:58.191 --> 03:36:04.155]  To physically abuse and kill their own family members, because we know this happens over and over again.
[03:36:04.155 --> 03:36:18.163]  You know, girls who marry somebody who they actually want to marry, God forbid, that's a shame on the family because it's not an arranged marriage, and fathers in many cases have killed and attempted to kill their own daughters.
[03:36:18.163 --> 03:36:19.704]  This is a massive problem.
[03:36:19.704 --> 03:36:25.968]  In fact, there was a girl in Pakistan who was shot in the head by her own father, dumped in a river,
[03:36:26.488 --> 03:36:30.630]  Because, again, she tried to marry somebody who she actually fell in love with.
[03:36:30.630 --> 03:36:31.571]  I mean, the horror.
[03:36:31.571 --> 03:36:32.391]  Well, think about this.
[03:36:32.391 --> 03:36:37.214]  The US surge operation to clear 10,000 Syrian refugees in just three months.
[03:36:37.214 --> 03:36:39.876]  This is an article by Washington Examiner.
[03:36:39.876 --> 03:36:47.340]  You're talking about bringing these people with these ideologies that treat women this way, that rape them, that want to murder them, that throw acid in their face.
[03:36:47.340 --> 03:36:50.662]  You want to bring these people, unvetted, into this country.
[03:36:50.662 --> 03:36:51.742]  What's going to happen?
[03:36:51.742 --> 03:36:54.364]  How many social justice warriors are going to stand up
[03:36:55.222 --> 03:36:57.824]  When they're being attacked and beaten.
[03:36:57.824 --> 03:37:03.789]  It's happening in Europe, but it's going to happen here, and we're going to let it go because the government is allowing it to happen.
[03:37:03.789 --> 03:37:05.251]  It's completely ridiculous.
[03:37:05.251 --> 03:37:09.394]  And as Paul was just saying, if they've got a... And they're going to sit there and go, thank you, thank you for it, throw more acid on my face.
[03:37:09.394 --> 03:37:10.615]  You know, it's sick!
[03:37:10.615 --> 03:37:20.163]  If they have a culture, if they have a religion that supports this activity, the laws or the Sesame Street programs really aren't going to change that.
[03:37:20.163 --> 03:37:21.424]  Paul, your comment.
[03:37:21.424 --> 03:37:21.785]  Yeah, I mean...
[03:37:23.144 --> 03:37:26.605]  The hijab is worn by women in many Middle Eastern countries.
[03:37:26.605 --> 03:37:30.006]  Because if they didn't wear it, they would get acid attacks.
[03:37:30.006 --> 03:37:31.267]  They would get raped.
[03:37:31.267 --> 03:37:35.728]  I mean, that's one of the justifications that migrants in Europe use for raping women.
[03:37:35.728 --> 03:37:39.950]  They say, well, she wasn't wearing a hijab, she wasn't wearing a burqa.
[03:37:39.950 --> 03:37:41.190]  She deserves it.
[03:37:41.190 --> 03:37:43.071]  So it's not a choice they make.
[03:37:43.071 --> 03:37:45.812]  It's not some feminist female empowerment thing.
[03:37:46.312 --> 03:37:52.138]  It's something that's forced upon them, otherwise they leave themselves open to be sexually abused and attacked.
[03:37:52.138 --> 03:37:55.221]  So again, complete disconnection with the Sesame Street thing.
[03:37:55.221 --> 03:37:57.103]  It's not about female empowerment.
[03:37:57.103 --> 03:37:59.666]  South by Southwest, the music festival that was here.
[03:37:59.666 --> 03:38:02.589]  I had some friends of mine that live in London.
[03:38:02.589 --> 03:38:03.070]  They were here.
[03:38:03.070 --> 03:38:03.971]  It was a husband and wife.
[03:38:04.531 --> 03:38:08.693]  And they were talking about their experience when they went to the U.A.
[03:38:08.693 --> 03:38:10.274]  over in Qatar and all that stuff.
[03:38:10.274 --> 03:38:14.555]  And how when they went there, the wife was like, you know what, I'm going to kind of abide by their culture.
[03:38:14.555 --> 03:38:19.517]  I'm going to cover up, dress really conservative because I don't want to be offensive to their culture.
[03:38:19.517 --> 03:38:27.161]  Then she goes back into London and she's wearing her natural clothes that she would wear out, you know, a dress, high heels.
[03:38:27.161 --> 03:38:32.283]  And these Muslim men are spitting at her, calling her names and things like that, attacking her in her own land.
[03:38:32.483 --> 03:38:33.843]  Because they don't respect her culture.
[03:38:33.843 --> 03:38:34.463]  Yeah.
[03:38:34.463 --> 03:38:43.885]  She respects their culture, tries to play by their rules, by their customs, but then they come to her culture and are going to try to force her to conform.
[03:38:43.885 --> 03:38:44.266]  Yeah.
[03:38:44.266 --> 03:38:48.406]  And they're already talking about housing these refugees on military bases.
[03:38:48.406 --> 03:38:54.748]  We've already done that with these immigrants coming in from Mexico and Central America at Lackland Air Force Base where the shooting was today.
[03:38:54.748 --> 03:39:00.049]  You know, it's out of control and they're wanting to bring in tons and tons without vetting them.
[03:39:00.569 --> 03:39:05.931]  Well, and of course the issue, and we all three understand that, our listeners understand it, it is not incompetence.
[03:39:05.931 --> 03:39:08.172]  It is not that they don't understand what's going on with this.
[03:39:08.172 --> 03:39:09.632]  This is by design.
[03:39:09.632 --> 03:39:10.112]  Exactly.
[03:39:10.112 --> 03:39:16.594]  This is actually part of the globalist agenda to try to create chaos within these countries.
[03:39:16.594 --> 03:39:18.635]  They don't want to have assimilation.
[03:39:18.635 --> 03:39:24.137]  That's why they bring them in in such large numbers, as Paul was talking about, the self-ghettoizing that happens with that.
[03:39:24.517 --> 03:39:27.561]  But it's also the trade treaties, the climate treaties.
[03:39:27.561 --> 03:39:37.271]  This is all part of the takedown of the West as well as establishing an economic control that is outside of the national sovereignty of the existing countries.
[03:39:37.271 --> 03:39:37.632]  Exactly.
[03:39:38.827 --> 03:39:48.153]  Uh, you know, one of the things that I thought was interesting that we saw here, and I don't know if you guys saw this or not, it's kind of off the side here, but we're talking about, you're mentioning the military and everything.
[03:39:48.153 --> 03:39:48.694]  The U.S.
[03:39:48.694 --> 03:39:55.939]  military has christened a self-driving Sea Hunter warship, and as they report this in Reuters, they say,
[03:39:56.599 --> 03:39:59.500]  It's the naval equivalent of Google's self-driving car.
[03:39:59.500 --> 03:40:07.882]  So I'm kind of wondering if this warship is going to drive into, if they programmed it to drive into a bus, or if it's going to turn into a bus or whatever.
[03:40:07.882 --> 03:40:17.884]  You know, we looked at this $360 million stealth warship that they released a couple of months ago, went about 50 miles and broke down and had to be towed back.
[03:40:17.884 --> 03:40:21.885]  We're getting to the point where nothing that our government is doing
[03:40:22.774 --> 03:40:25.876]  Is working to, you know, they tell us they're there to keep us safe.
[03:40:25.876 --> 03:40:27.437]  That's the whole justification.
[03:40:27.437 --> 03:40:31.879]  Security, safety, and yet it is just open corruption.
[03:40:31.879 --> 03:40:35.101]  Driverless cars have already had 84 wrecks.
[03:40:35.101 --> 03:40:35.201]  84!
[03:40:35.201 --> 03:40:38.582]  I've only had one in my entire life and I wasn't the cause of it.
[03:40:38.582 --> 03:40:47.007]  You know, what's going to happen when this, you know, driverless boat warship accidentally creeps into Iranian waters or something and launches a missile?
[03:40:47.007 --> 03:40:48.788]  They're going to go, whoa, that's not our fault.
[03:40:48.788 --> 03:40:49.748]  Sorry, guys.
[03:40:49.748 --> 03:40:50.829]  We didn't mean to start this war.
[03:40:51.809 --> 03:40:55.611]  It really does allow them, and it does, it gives them plausible deniability.
[03:40:55.611 --> 03:40:58.313]  So I mean, you want to talk about a false flag, it would be very easy to do that.
[03:40:58.313 --> 03:41:01.714]  But I mean, we look at something like this, we have not solved this problem.
[03:41:01.714 --> 03:41:08.618]  We just had a situation in Pennsylvania where you had a tragedy on a railroad track.
[03:41:08.618 --> 03:41:09.819]  On a railroad track.
[03:41:09.819 --> 03:41:11.980]  And now here they're going to put a warship
[03:41:12.540 --> 03:41:18.344]  That is self-driving out at sea, and they can't even get their manned ship.
[03:41:18.344 --> 03:41:20.145]  They spent $360 million on it.
[03:41:20.145 --> 03:41:22.026]  Can't even find an airplane when it goes down in the ocean.
[03:41:22.026 --> 03:41:23.587]  What the hell are they going to do when that thing's gone?
[03:41:23.587 --> 03:41:24.627]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:41:24.627 --> 03:41:25.108]  Absolutely.
[03:41:25.108 --> 03:41:27.709]  So, uh, yeah.
[03:41:27.709 --> 03:41:28.270]  It's really crazy.
[03:41:28.270 --> 03:41:30.291]  I don't see anything bad happening with this at all.
[03:41:30.948 --> 03:41:32.149]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:41:32.149 --> 03:41:33.269]  There's a lot that's going to go wrong.
[03:41:33.269 --> 03:41:34.810]  Because look at this story, too, as well.
[03:41:34.810 --> 03:41:37.532]  We're talking about the technology that's failing.
[03:41:37.532 --> 03:41:42.054]  Robot waiters were fired after spilling drinks and food during restaurant service.
[03:41:42.054 --> 03:41:52.840]  So you can't get your ship that you spent $360 million on to go further than 50 miles, you can't get robot waiters to serve food without spilling it all over the customers, but you're going to
[03:41:53.480 --> 03:41:58.483]  Release an autonomous warship, and that's the thing that so many people are concerned about.
[03:41:58.483 --> 03:42:06.828]  Of course, there's a movement in Europe to try to block this, to try to get some kind of sense to people, to get the public to wake up as well, Paul.
[03:42:06.828 --> 03:42:09.350]  We've talked many times to Dr. Noel Sharkey.
[03:42:09.890 --> 03:42:15.312]  Who has warned us about the desire to create autonomous killing machines.
[03:42:15.312 --> 03:42:19.334]  This is the first time I've seen it in terms of a warship.
[03:42:19.334 --> 03:42:24.676]  Usually we're thinking about swarms of drones that are operating or something like that.
[03:42:24.676 --> 03:42:27.477]  But these warships that they're already unleashing.
[03:42:29.241 --> 03:42:37.551]  Yeah, of course, the big thing with driverless cars is that they're going to give the computer the moral agency to decide who it kills.
[03:42:37.551 --> 03:42:42.817]  So if you're in a driverless car, you're going down the highway, you're going to have a wreck.
[03:42:42.817 --> 03:42:47.903]  And there's a chance that you could die or that some child, you know, that's just crossing the road could die.
[03:42:48.624 --> 03:42:50.425]  It's gonna choose to kill you.
[03:42:50.425 --> 03:42:50.725]  Yeah.
[03:42:50.725 --> 03:42:58.908]  Now, in certain situations, of course, you could avoid both tragedies, but that computer is gonna make a split-second decision to kill you.
[03:42:58.908 --> 03:43:00.188]  That's a problem.
[03:43:00.188 --> 03:43:08.532]  Also a problem is the fact, now we know that the government is gonna regulate this, where they decide whether you can get in this driverless car in the first place.
[03:43:08.532 --> 03:43:10.352]  It's about control of mobility.
[03:43:10.352 --> 03:43:12.613]  It's not about giving people freedom.
[03:43:12.613 --> 03:43:14.874]  It's about increased control.
[03:43:15.174 --> 03:43:17.855]  Yeah, increased control and tracking.
[03:43:17.855 --> 03:43:32.103]  That's the key thing because we're going to have the United States, I don't know how this is progressing in the UK, but they are accelerating this in America and they're going to have vehicle-to-vehicle black boxes mandated for the cars and they're going to be releasing that legislation.
[03:43:32.103 --> 03:43:36.686]  We're told the rules, actually it's not going to be legislation because we don't pass laws anymore in the Congress.
[03:43:36.686 --> 03:43:42.609]  We simply turn the power over to these bureaucracies who then tell us what the new laws are going to be, calling them regulations.
[03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:55.473]  The regulations that are going to be coming out in the fall are going to mandate these vehicle-to-vehicle communications, and there's going to be a black box you're going to have to buy in your car, but it's also going to talk to the infrastructure.
[03:43:55.473 --> 03:44:06.417]  They have vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, and that's going to be used to track you, it's going to be used to tax you, it's going to be used to change your insurance plans so they can get you out of the car.
[03:44:06.417 --> 03:44:07.858]  You won't be able to afford to drive a car.
[03:44:08.078 --> 03:44:12.143]  Excuse me, Mr. Johnson, we've just been notified that you are late on child support.
[03:44:12.143 --> 03:44:16.408]  We will be shutting down the vehicle, locking the doors, and notifying law enforcement.
[03:44:16.408 --> 03:44:17.529]  Enjoy your day.
[03:44:17.529 --> 03:44:22.174]  Or maybe they didn't like that Facebook post and they're just going to lock the doors and drive you to a prison.
[03:44:23.195 --> 03:44:24.116]  Exactly.
[03:44:24.116 --> 03:44:27.898]  Yeah, we know that's already happening in China.
[03:44:27.898 --> 03:44:38.606]  Remember the social credit score that they had, where if people had criticized the government or if they were purchasing things that were a little bit suspicious, they would lose their social credit score.
[03:44:38.606 --> 03:44:39.787]  It would go down.
[03:44:39.787 --> 03:44:42.469]  And that would then impact their friends.
[03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:45.071]  So they bring peer pressure into it.
[03:44:45.071 --> 03:44:49.654]  So, you know, if you're not a well-behaved citizen, maybe you're not going to be allowed to get in the car in the first place.
[03:44:50.185 --> 03:45:04.516]  Yeah, and of course we had those articles at the beginning of the week where they were reviving this system where they're going to have police booths every few blocks throughout China where they're going to have actually a very crude form of surveillance where they're going to have humans.
[03:45:05.396 --> 03:45:26.846]  Knowing everybody that's in their neighborhood, coming to a modern city like Guangzhou, which is one of the most modern cities in mainland China, they're bragging about how the fact that they're going to put these people in there within a couple of months, they're going to know who the families are, but then they're going to know within about six months everything about all the individuals and all of the families, and they are jumping on this self-driving car
[03:45:27.586 --> 03:45:31.507]  Even more so than the American government, because they're all about control.
[03:45:31.507 --> 03:45:32.508]  That's what this is all about.
[03:45:32.508 --> 03:45:46.512]  It creates a lot of safety issues, and just as we're looking at these military things, you've got situations where these autonomous killing machines can go crazy, either with an error or with a false flag attack, but it can also start wars, as you just mentioned.
[03:45:46.512 --> 03:45:52.194]  But when we look at it from the transportation standpoint, when a government wants to control a population, what do they do?
[03:45:52.774 --> 03:45:54.075]  They control the movement.
[03:45:54.075 --> 03:45:58.419]  It's one of the first things the military is going to do is get control of transportation methods.
[03:45:58.419 --> 03:46:02.463]  And so that's one of the things that they're doing in enacting this control grid.
[03:46:02.463 --> 03:46:05.245]  And I think Americans don't really realize how dangerous this is going to be.
[03:46:05.245 --> 03:46:06.266]  You know, I was just in Philly.
[03:46:06.266 --> 03:46:07.968]  They are building the city up.
[03:46:07.968 --> 03:46:09.169]  They're going higher.
[03:46:09.169 --> 03:46:09.790]  They're not going out.
[03:46:10.939 --> 03:46:14.481]  And you have these massive BLM grabs where they're taking all this land.
[03:46:14.481 --> 03:46:15.442]  That's Agenda 21, yeah?
[03:46:15.442 --> 03:46:15.822]  Exactly.
[03:46:15.822 --> 03:46:22.526]  They're taking the land, they're pushing you into cities, building the cities as high up as they can, putting you in these tiny little rooms where they can control you.
[03:46:22.526 --> 03:46:27.329]  Then they put you in this driverless car where they control you and watch you and listen to you.
[03:46:27.329 --> 03:46:31.392]  There's already that, uh, the new Corvette has a thing called valet mode.
[03:46:31.392 --> 03:46:31.712]  Yeah.
[03:46:31.712 --> 03:46:36.455]  That regardless if your car is on or off, it is always listening and recording your conversations.
[03:46:36.755 --> 03:46:54.690]  And of course in the UK, Paul, you've got, I think we just lost Paul there, but of course in the UK, they have the same issues that we have here, where they're trying to sell all these micro apartments that are 200 square feet, 100 square feet, that are extremely expensive, selling that as the newest, latest, trendiest thing.
[03:46:54.690 --> 03:47:02.036]  Yes, like in a cute, smart storage unit or something like that down the street, and go, hey, look at my new trendy apartment, it's 5 by 5 foot, it's amazing!
[03:47:02.276 --> 03:47:03.417]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:47:03.417 --> 03:47:06.501]  And that's why, you know, when we look at what's happening, so many people...
[03:47:07.332 --> 03:47:07.792]  who are
[03:47:37.492 --> 03:47:45.496]  And the government is coming in and taking those away from these people who are doing productive things for our society.
[03:47:45.496 --> 03:47:50.358]  People in the suburbs, people in the cities don't realize that they're next on the list.
[03:47:50.358 --> 03:47:55.681]  They can take somebody's property rights that are surface grazing rights or logging rights.
[03:47:55.681 --> 03:48:00.723]  They can come in and they can take the rights to your home and they can force you into a city situation.
[03:48:00.723 --> 03:48:03.884]  They can force you into a controlled transportation.
[03:48:03.884 --> 03:48:04.105]  2008?
[03:48:04.105 --> 03:48:04.905]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:48:05.426 --> 03:48:06.167]  Absolutely.
[03:48:06.167 --> 03:48:07.190]  That's what we're seeing.
[03:48:07.190 --> 03:48:09.014]  I think we lost Paul.
[03:48:09.014 --> 03:48:13.404]  We're going to try to establish contact with Paul in just a moment.
[03:48:15.060 --> 03:48:27.449]  Again, when we look at what's happening in this country, and it's not just Sesame Street, we're also seeing the way the agendas are being set up with the movies.
[03:48:27.449 --> 03:48:35.094]  As I was talking about yesterday, the CIA even having episodes of a cooking show that they're involved in.
[03:48:35.094 --> 03:48:39.097]  It's not just things like Zero Dark Thirty that they're doing, it's a complete
[03:48:40.598 --> 03:48:48.224]  Full spectrum control of the media, going back to the beginning of the Cold War.
[03:48:48.224 --> 03:48:48.984]  Paul's back with us.
[03:48:48.984 --> 03:48:51.166]  Paul, your comments?
[03:48:51.166 --> 03:48:52.567]  I missed what you were talking about, sorry.
[03:48:52.567 --> 03:48:53.688]  Can you recap?
[03:48:53.688 --> 03:48:59.573]  Well, we were just talking about Agenda 21 and how we're going back to the Sesame Street situation that we've got.
[03:49:03.257 --> 03:49:09.580]  It's not just Sesame Street, but it is everything that the media is doing in terms of the movies that are coming out.
[03:49:09.580 --> 03:49:15.843]  We just had a story yesterday where we had the CIA involved even in a cooking show here in the United States.
[03:49:15.843 --> 03:49:19.044]  It's not just the high-profile movies that are pretty obvious.
[03:49:19.044 --> 03:49:23.106]  It's not just Sesame Street where they're coming in and doing this in Afghanistan.
[03:49:23.106 --> 03:49:25.827]  We'll probably bring this character into the United States.
[03:49:25.827 --> 03:49:28.528]  But it's even in subtle ways like cooking shows.
[03:49:28.528 --> 03:49:29.669]  It's full spectrum
[03:49:30.129 --> 03:49:34.772]  Dominance when they're trying to manipulate and control society.
[03:49:34.772 --> 03:49:42.198]  Well, and that's because they know that young people, you know, millennials growing up in their early 20s now, don't watch the news anymore.
[03:49:42.198 --> 03:49:44.780]  They watch entertainment programs.
[03:49:44.780 --> 03:49:46.741]  If that, you know, now they're all on Netflix.
[03:49:46.741 --> 03:49:50.524]  So I guess we're going to see more propaganda placement in those kind of shows.
[03:49:51.184 --> 03:49:55.650]  So, yeah, they avoid doing it in the news because less and less people are watching it.
[03:49:55.650 --> 03:49:58.373]  Trust in mainstream media is at record lows.
[03:49:58.373 --> 03:50:08.205]  So now they have to use the narratives of entertainment shows and the characters within those shows to get their brainwashing out because that's what the millennials are watching right now.
[03:50:08.205 --> 03:50:09.286]  It's working very effectively.
[03:50:10.888 --> 03:50:16.252]  Rob Dew and my son were covering these protests out in Wisconsin.
[03:50:16.252 --> 03:50:18.213]  It was very, very effective.
[03:50:18.213 --> 03:50:32.462]  You saw most of the people who were there as protesters, most of the people bought into this mindless, privileged narrative that they've given people, as well as this story that we have on our site today, these social justice warriors crashing the Students for Trump meeting.
[03:50:32.462 --> 03:50:39.447]  Over and over again, we're seeing just how effective this propaganda has become, because it's not only entertainment, but of course it's the educational system.
[03:50:39.907 --> 03:50:43.590]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson and Joe Biggs.
[03:51:01.770 --> 03:51:08.794]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[03:51:08.794 --> 03:51:13.416]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[03:51:13.416 --> 03:51:23.921]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[03:51:24.221 --> 03:51:37.817]  Supernatural silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers, using a patented technology that is highly effective against colds, flus, infections, food poisoning, and yeast, in addition to many other pathogens.
[03:51:39.158 --> 03:51:39.799]  We're good to go.
[03:52:01.377 --> 03:52:03.698]  Are you concerned about the Power Grid?
[03:52:03.698 --> 03:52:06.120]  About the new war on the Power Grid?
[03:52:06.120 --> 03:52:11.683]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[03:52:11.683 --> 03:52:12.684]  Here's why.
[03:52:12.684 --> 03:52:18.227]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the Power Grid has just been written.
[03:52:18.227 --> 03:52:22.109]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies.
[03:52:22.389 --> 03:52:25.651]  But only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[03:52:25.651 --> 03:52:30.354]  He simply asked that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[03:52:30.354 --> 03:52:36.138]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[03:52:36.138 --> 03:52:37.079]  Why do this?
[03:52:37.079 --> 03:52:40.941]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[03:52:40.941 --> 03:52:41.982]  The answer is simple.
[03:52:42.242 --> 03:52:46.386]  America's power grid is in grave danger, and most Americans are clueless.
[03:52:46.386 --> 03:52:53.253]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes, and why the most common question this author gets is, do you fear for your life?
[03:52:53.253 --> 03:52:55.556]  Go to waronthegrid.com.
[03:52:55.556 --> 03:52:57.658]  That's waronthegrid.com.
[03:52:57.658 --> 03:52:58.278]  Don't wait.
[03:52:58.278 --> 03:53:00.020]  waronthegrid.com.
[03:53:01.161 --> 03:53:05.342]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[03:53:05.342 --> 03:53:11.523]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[03:53:11.523 --> 03:53:13.283]  How is this even possible?
[03:53:13.283 --> 03:53:20.845]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:53:20.845 --> 03:53:28.586]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[03:53:28.786 --> 03:53:33.149]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[03:53:33.149 --> 03:53:41.935]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[03:53:41.935 --> 03:53:43.516]  But you must act fast.
[03:53:43.516 --> 03:53:48.039]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[03:53:48.319 --> 03:53:52.103]  If you'd like to claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[03:53:52.103 --> 03:53:52.944]  That's Greens75.com.

[03:54:18.843 --> 03:54:20.064]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:20.064 --> 03:54:24.489]  I'm David Knight here in Austin with Joe Biggs and we have Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the UK.
[03:54:24.489 --> 03:54:28.733]  We have a couple of headlines that are very significant on InfoWars today.
[03:54:29.637 --> 03:54:34.318]  Millions wrongly treated for cancer, says a National Cancer Institute panel.
[03:54:34.318 --> 03:54:38.019]  Also, chemo and radiation can make cancer more malignant.
[03:54:38.019 --> 03:54:55.322]  Now, these stories are saying that millions of people who are screen-detected abnormalities are not cancer in the first place, but even those which can be considered to be fast-growing are often being driven into greater malignancy by the conventional chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery-based standards of cancer care itself.
[03:54:56.022 --> 03:54:58.364]  Check out those stories at Infowars.com.
[03:54:58.364 --> 03:55:01.967]  That's information you need to know, information that is breaking.
[03:55:01.967 --> 03:55:15.579]  And of course, when we look at this, we know that one of the best things you can do for yourself is to try to make sure that you have pure food, try to get the dangerous chemicals out of your food, and make sure that you're getting the essential nutrients that you need.
[03:55:16.079 --> 03:55:21.024]  With that in mind, remember that we have Survival Shield X2 now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:55:21.024 --> 03:55:24.788]  That's our pure nascent iodine formula.
[03:55:24.788 --> 03:55:29.313]  Its populations, as we pointed out, have gained as much as 15 IQ points.
[03:55:29.313 --> 03:55:34.918]  When it was added back into the salt in the 1990s, they take it in and out of the food supply.
[03:55:34.918 --> 03:55:38.903]  And so make sure that you're getting the kinds of nutrition that you need
[03:55:39.583 --> 03:55:49.313]  Give your body what it needs to build itself up and that's one of your best ways to keep yourself healthy and to look out for the health of your family as well.
[03:55:50.143 --> 03:55:53.627]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:53.627 --> 03:56:05.040]  Now today we had a shooting at a military base in San Antonio and I want to play you a clip and get a reaction from Paul Joseph Watson and Joe Biggs to what one of the officers on site said.
[03:56:05.040 --> 03:56:05.680]  Let's roll that.
[03:56:05.680 --> 03:56:10.366]  Secondly is on the larger camps and installations of Fort Hood, of Fort Bragg, of Fort Lewis for example.
[03:56:11.195 --> 03:56:18.842]  In terms of carrying privately owned weapons on military bases, concealed privately owned weapons, that is not authorized.
[03:56:18.842 --> 03:56:21.064]  That is a DOD policy.
[03:56:21.064 --> 03:56:23.566]  I do not recommend that it be changed.
[03:56:23.566 --> 03:56:27.250]  We have adequate law enforcement on those bases to respond.
[03:56:27.250 --> 03:56:28.871]  You take the Fort Hood Incident No.
[03:56:28.871 --> 03:56:34.016]  2, the one where I was the commander of 3rd Corps, those police responded within 8 minutes and that guy was dead.
[03:56:34.016 --> 03:56:35.857]  So, that's pretty quick.
[03:56:36.878 --> 03:56:49.392]  A lot of people died in the process of that but that was a very fast evolving event and I am not convinced from what I know that carrying privately owned weapons would have stopped that individual.
[03:56:49.392 --> 03:56:50.533]  I've been around guns all my life.
[03:56:50.533 --> 03:56:52.856]  Let's go to Joe Biggs and Paul Joseph White.
[03:56:52.856 --> 03:56:55.238]  So he's saying that eight minutes is pretty quick.
[03:56:55.238 --> 03:56:57.480]  Is that pretty quick when somebody's got a loaded gun pointed at you?
[03:56:57.981 --> 03:57:00.064]  Well, I mean, when you're in a situation like that, that's like being in combat.
[03:57:00.064 --> 03:57:01.205]  Eight minutes is a lifetime.
[03:57:01.205 --> 03:57:01.666]  Yeah.
[03:57:01.666 --> 03:57:03.709]  So much can happen in eight minutes.
[03:57:03.709 --> 03:57:05.050]  A lot can happen.
[03:57:05.050 --> 03:57:06.953]  Death, you know, whether you're going to live or not.
[03:57:06.953 --> 03:57:09.236]  I mean, it's completely and totally crazy.
[03:57:09.236 --> 03:57:11.639]  We've only got a couple of minutes in this segment, and it's not enough.
[03:57:11.639 --> 03:57:13.802]  I mean, especially if somebody was pointing a gun at my head.
[03:57:13.902 --> 03:57:16.183]  I mean, this happened today at Lackland Air Force Base.
[03:57:16.183 --> 03:57:19.425]  It's about an hour and 15 minutes south of us here in Austin, Texas.
[03:57:19.425 --> 03:57:23.027]  And basically the report is, earlier this morning there was an active shooter.
[03:57:23.027 --> 03:57:28.530]  Come to find out it's an airman who went on base, shot his commander, then turned the gun on himself and killed himself, apparently.
[03:57:28.530 --> 03:57:29.291]  So that's what they're saying.
[03:57:30.632 --> 03:57:35.456]  Look, if somebody, even with the laws how they are, this kid could have just thrown it out in the trunk of his car.
[03:57:35.456 --> 03:57:39.098]  They only randomly screen and search certain vehicles just from time to time.
[03:57:39.098 --> 03:57:44.322]  They have like a little, like a number they do every day, like every fifth car, every tenth car, whatever.
[03:57:44.322 --> 03:57:48.305]  Or then they'll do one day they elevate the security level and they just search all of them.
[03:57:48.305 --> 03:57:52.769]  You know, that can easily, you know, be sent through if they have the same law in act.
[03:57:53.169 --> 03:57:58.075]  So, and of course, if they hadn't had that rule, the person that he killed might have been able to defend himself.
[03:57:58.075 --> 03:57:59.077]  Defend himself, exactly.
[03:57:59.077 --> 03:58:01.480]  I mean, look, we saw what happened in Chattanooga.
[03:58:01.480 --> 03:58:03.542]  You know, at these recruiting centers.
[03:58:03.542 --> 03:58:04.884]  It's completely and totally ridiculous.
[03:58:04.884 --> 03:58:06.606]  Real quickly, just a couple of seconds.
[03:58:06.606 --> 03:58:10.371]  Paul, I know you're in a victim disarmament zone there in the UK.
[03:58:10.371 --> 03:58:10.932]  Your comments.
[03:58:12.173 --> 03:58:16.998]  Well, I mean, he's hailing the fact that it only took eight minutes with the Fort Hood shooting.
[03:58:16.998 --> 03:58:18.479]  Thirteen people died!
[03:58:18.479 --> 03:58:18.719]  Yeah.
[03:58:18.719 --> 03:58:22.703]  If you can't trust military personnel to carry guns on base, then who can you trust?
[03:58:22.703 --> 03:58:23.104]  That's ridiculous.
[03:58:23.104 --> 03:58:23.945]  Exactly.
[03:58:23.945 --> 03:58:24.425]  Exactly.
[03:58:24.425 --> 03:58:26.387]  These are the people that work for the government.
[03:58:26.387 --> 03:58:28.589]  They're supposed to be keeping us safe and secure.
[03:58:28.589 --> 03:58:30.631]  They can't be trusted to protect themselves.
[03:58:30.631 --> 03:58:32.213]  Join us tonight, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:32.213 --> 03:58:33.874]  Eastern, for the InfoWars Nightly News.
