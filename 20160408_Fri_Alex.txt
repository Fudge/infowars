[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  you
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.760]  the momentum of the slippery slope to demolish our inherent rights protected
[01:07.760 --> 01:13.040]  by the First Amendment is picking up speed back in January of 2014 federal
[01:13.040 --> 01:16.840]  prosecutors through the book at author and documentary filmmaker Dinesh
[01:16.840 --> 01:22.840]  D'Souza for exaggerated campaign finance law violations in September of 2014
[01:22.840 --> 01:27.320]  D'Souza was sentenced to five years probation eight months and a halfway
[01:27.320 --> 01:33.680]  house a $30,000 fine community service and mandatory therapy even the liberal
[01:33.680 --> 01:38.240]  Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said the felony sentencing smacked of
[01:38.240 --> 01:44.600]  selective prosecution why it just so happened that D'Souza had made a highly
[01:44.600 --> 01:50.280]  successful documentary criticizing president Barack Obama unfortunately
[01:50.280 --> 01:55.280]  D'Souza's admission of guilt set the precedent for a new found attack on the
[01:55.280 --> 02:00.680]  First Amendment the liberals had tasted blood and they wanted more Matt Drudge
[02:00.680 --> 02:08.120]  had warned in 2015 that plans to take down conservative IE right-wing IE
[02:08.120 --> 02:13.680]  alternative media were gathering steam in the back rooms of Washington DC they're
[02:13.680 --> 02:17.280]  getting ready for these decisions to come you thought Obamacare was shocking
[02:17.280 --> 02:20.240]  you thought some of these other decisions were shocking wait until these
[02:20.240 --> 02:26.720]  copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a
[02:26.720 --> 02:32.040]  website with news headlines linking across the board then that will end for
[02:32.040 --> 02:36.640]  me fine I've had a hell of a run so when pro-life activist David Daliden
[02:36.640 --> 02:41.560]  exposed Planned Parenthood sale of fetal tissue via secret recordings and
[02:41.560 --> 02:46.120]  investigative techniques the liberal Rockefeller supported organization
[02:46.120 --> 02:51.400]  Planned Parenthood used the unchecked liberal inertia to slap Daliden with a
[02:51.400 --> 02:56.720]  possible 22-year sentence while beyond the embarrassment no charges were ever
[02:56.720 --> 03:01.760]  filed against Planned Parenthood now documentary filmmaker Joe Gilbert
[03:01.760 --> 03:07.440]  creator of the Obama expose a dreams from my real father faces a federal
[03:07.440 --> 03:13.280]  precedent setting onslaught by the FEC World Net Daily writes in a case
[03:13.280 --> 03:19.600]  spotlighting regulation of conservative media the three Democrats on the FEC
[03:19.600 --> 03:26.800]  alleged Gilbert violated reporting rules when he mailed out DVDs of his movie
[03:26.800 --> 03:31.560]  dreams from my real father a story of reds and deception during the 2012
[03:31.560 --> 03:36.520]  election campaign the panel's three Republican members quashed the move
[03:36.520 --> 03:41.120]  however arguing the standard media exemption had been given to liberal
[03:41.120 --> 03:46.040]  filmmakers such as Michael Moore Gilbert added if the makeup of the Federal
[03:46.040 --> 03:50.320]  Election Commission has changed because a Democrat wins the presidency and
[03:50.320 --> 03:55.520]  appoints one more Democrat than Republican to the Commission we face a
[03:55.520 --> 04:01.480]  dire future in which only political speech favorable to far-left agenda will
[04:01.480 --> 04:06.760]  be tolerated in America documentary films shown on television or the internet
[04:06.760 --> 04:12.760]  or broadcast over radio may be subject to criminal penalties Gilbert said the
[04:12.760 --> 04:18.120]  liberal line is being drawn in the sand and as the Obama administration slowly
[04:18.120 --> 04:24.080]  reveals its teeth their guard goes down as the possibility of their actions
[04:24.080 --> 04:29.160]  backfires into charges against their own criminal violations of the first
[04:29.160 --> 04:34.600]  amendment we are seeing nothing less than a witch hunt masquerading as a liberal
[04:34.600 --> 04:37.840]  agenda it's not that they're breaking the laws it's that the laws are so poorly
[04:37.840 --> 04:41.720]  designed that they allow people if they've got enough lawyers and enough
[04:41.720 --> 04:46.480]  accountants to wiggle out of responsibilities that ordinary citizens

[08:33.520 --> 08:37.040]  also have a lot of really really big reports out there that we're going to
[08:37.040 --> 08:41.720]  be going over dealing with this so-called biggest wiki leaks style data dump
[08:41.720 --> 08:45.440]  ever when I first saw this yesterday I said it's going to be low-level groups
[08:45.440 --> 08:49.640]  trying to protect their money it's going to be the russian networks as soon as I
[08:49.640 --> 08:53.840]  saw that they were going after that soccer that international football group
[08:53.840 --> 08:58.160]  this is the big mega banks that control trillions that create trillions and
[08:58.160 --> 09:02.240]  derivatives that is that engage in all forms of drug dealing money laundering
[09:02.240 --> 09:08.160]  child kidnapping white slavery overthrow governments five billion to
[09:08.160 --> 09:14.680]  overthrow Ukraine five billion to the rebels in Syria this is the most corrupt
[09:14.680 --> 09:19.280]  group you can imagine simply leaking this to the Germans handing it out to a
[09:19.280 --> 09:24.400]  hundred different newspapers or more in the last year to quote vet it no that
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.240]  was to make sure that it didn't connect to any western operations and it's
[09:28.240 --> 09:33.520]  cherry pick what to go after and sure enough it's in the news today they're
[09:33.520 --> 09:37.560]  saying this is a selective leak by the west against other networks they don't
[09:37.560 --> 09:41.200]  control this is how it works you get Arthur Anderson previously or now it's
[09:41.200 --> 09:45.480]  another big accounting firm that the former attorney general runs then you
[09:45.480 --> 09:49.800]  can have offshore accounts that then you cannot pay taxes they certify it and
[09:49.800 --> 09:53.520]  the government doesn't touch it because it's full of vice presidents former
[09:53.520 --> 09:57.600]  presidents on their boards former attorney generals former FBI directors
[09:57.600 --> 10:02.880]  there's only two or three of these firms in DC like Arthur Anderson and then
[10:02.880 --> 10:06.200]  you're left alone now the law says you can have an offshore bank account the
[10:06.200 --> 10:11.000]  law says you can go to the Cayman Islands or Switzerland or lexenberg but
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.240]  when they want to they will come and shake you down and arrest you this is a
[10:15.240 --> 10:19.560]  model of global government where you have the FBI going out arresting the
[10:19.560 --> 10:23.520]  leadership of the International Football League of the International
[10:23.520 --> 10:27.720]  Soccer League this is global governance and I'm gonna go over that later in the

[10:31.760 --> 10:36.880]  going offshore and more but WikiLeaks reveals IMF plan to cause a credit event
[10:36.880 --> 10:42.400]  in Greece and destabilize Europe don't forget that the French elite where it
[10:42.400 --> 10:45.360]  went wrong financial time submitting they don't pay taxes themselves
[10:45.360 --> 10:50.200]  French billionaire to salt to face trial for tax fraud Chinese newspaper editor
[10:50.200 --> 10:53.960]  resigns over media control associated press will have fully cooperated with
[10:53.960 --> 10:57.640]  the Nazis to show how they're controlled top German journalist admits mainstream
[10:57.640 --> 11:03.080]  media is completely fake we quote all live for the CIA in Germany it's a whole
[11:03.080 --> 11:06.200]  bunch of their biggest reporters coming out why is that important because when
[11:06.200 --> 11:11.800]  it comes out of Germany particularly people see Germany is like oh modern
[11:11.800 --> 11:19.040]  liberal you can really trust it it's the worst garbage you'll ever find some of
[11:19.040 --> 11:24.640]  their news is accurate if you research it but but general scandal news is really
[11:24.640 --> 11:29.920]  coming out of the CIA out of the MI6 out of Israel out of other groups but they
[11:29.920 --> 11:34.000]  fence it through Germany because somehow they have credibility they never got
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.480]  over being occupied high earners say goodbye to France so again they want
[11:39.480 --> 11:44.120]  this international tax grab tax traders widen division in belt tightening
[11:44.120 --> 11:48.200]  France and now they're trying to blame Russia for two billion dollars in the
[11:48.200 --> 11:54.280]  quote biggest scandal ever with this Panama data dump the Panama papers two
[11:54.280 --> 11:58.520]  billion I mean that is nothing you know how many trillions exchange hands in the
[11:58.520 --> 12:03.600]  currency markets every day the rig stock markets the rig credit default swaps the
[12:03.600 --> 12:10.800]  rigged currency the the rigged interest rates the all of it is it's if they
[12:10.800 --> 12:14.520]  admit it's all rigged is what's crazy just like they've tried to steal
[12:14.520 --> 12:18.400]  elections they manipulated them before but never come right out instead we're
[12:18.400 --> 12:23.200]  gonna put Paul Ryan in this is Carl Rove last week even if he doesn't have one
[12:23.200 --> 12:28.920]  delegate and Kasek is showing his wares saying you know doesn't matter if he's
[12:28.920 --> 12:33.880]  only got a few he deserves to win I don't know what you call this coming out
[12:33.880 --> 12:39.200]  in the open is this really the fall of America the fall of the West or is this
[12:39.200 --> 12:43.960]  a psi-op to prepare us for just anything because when things get this crazy in
[12:43.960 --> 12:47.880]  history you go over the edge of a cliff are we going over the edge of the cliff
[12:47.880 --> 12:53.400]  right now have we reached the event horizon we're gonna talk geopolitics
[12:53.400 --> 12:57.680]  we're gonna talk Syria we're gonna talk Iran we're gonna talk Ukraine we're gonna
[12:57.680 --> 13:00.960]  talk Obama we're gonna talk black lives matter on the destabilization program
[13:00.960 --> 13:07.200]  we're going to talk the entire waterfront 2016 and beyond but first off I
[13:07.200 --> 13:10.960]  don't know his view I follow his articles but he's pretty libertarian
[13:10.960 --> 13:15.080]  conservative a political though he just does analysis of the world best-selling
[13:15.080 --> 13:20.360]  nonfiction author best-selling fiction author James Leslie Rawls is American
[13:20.360 --> 13:24.400]  novelist and blogger who is best known for his recently completed Patriots novel
[13:24.400 --> 13:28.280]  series Rawls the former US Army intelligence officer he is the founder
[13:28.280 --> 13:32.480]  of the senior editor of survival blog calm which is one of the top sites in
[13:32.480 --> 13:35.760]  the world with tens of millions of visitors a month for the past ten years
[13:35.760 --> 13:39.760]  he's covered survival and preparedness topics from a constitutional Christian
[13:39.760 --> 13:43.280]  libertarian perspective his latest novel is titled land of promise got another
[13:43.280 --> 13:47.640]  one coming out to the first book in the counter caliphate chronicle series this
[13:47.640 --> 13:51.360]  novel set two decades in the future describes the establishment of a
[13:51.360 --> 13:55.600]  Christian nation under siege now I could do three hours with this guy because I
[13:55.600 --> 13:58.240]  got a lot to say a lot of angles of coverage only on to the bottom of the
[13:58.240 --> 14:01.720]  next hour but I want to invite him back in a few weeks for a part two for two
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.080]  full hours because he was willing to do it today he's a busy guy because I've
[14:06.080 --> 14:09.720]  got my reporters popping in for the last 30 minutes the next hour I may push
[14:09.720 --> 14:13.880]  them though up to David Knight though we'll see how this goes but I just
[14:13.880 --> 14:17.680]  threw out that menu of what I want to cover but front and center is what is
[14:17.680 --> 14:21.840]  this caliphate plan why would the West be bold enough to bring in five million
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.560]  people they know many of which are middle military aged men and our jihadis
[14:26.560 --> 14:31.000]  will they carry out attacks and then martial law comes in like areas of
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.240]  Europe have already done and how are our political elite get away with bringing
[14:36.240 --> 14:40.240]  them in and then having them attack us is that part of this victory over logic
[14:40.240 --> 14:44.800]  and common sense just like in effect they're suspending the election by
[14:44.800 --> 14:49.960]  stealing Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump's delegates openly I mean we're
[14:49.960 --> 14:53.640]  really entering a new phase is this bravada is this arrogance is this
[14:53.640 --> 14:58.200]  megalomania or is this a desperate attempt to look confident I've thrown out
[14:58.200 --> 15:03.520]  a lot there James Wesley Rawls survival blog.com we're going to break here in
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.840]  about 15 minutes you've got the floor tell us where you want to start first
[15:07.840 --> 15:13.960]  and what you think is currently happening well Alex I think looking at it
[15:13.960 --> 15:21.680]  from a 30,000 foot view what we have in the global geopolitical realm is with
[15:21.680 --> 15:28.720]  the end of the Cold War the powers that be needed to have a continued
[15:28.720 --> 15:35.560]  destabilization as an excuse for carrying on with all of their banking
[15:35.560 --> 15:42.600]  shenanigans their massive military buildups and so forth they in effect
[15:42.600 --> 15:51.800]  through Osama bin Laden and other Islamic leaders that they supported the CIA
[15:51.800 --> 15:57.200]  and self-created ISIS as you pointed out many times they want
[15:57.200 --> 16:05.160]  destabilization they are hoping that they can walk the tightrope of
[16:05.160 --> 16:11.640]  destabilization to the point where they can continue to consolidate power with
[16:11.640 --> 16:18.000]  massively centralized government with a electronic currency replacing physical
[16:18.000 --> 16:26.720]  currency and with the whole statist agenda by building up the Islamic threat
[16:26.720 --> 16:34.160]  and then hoping to encounter that threat all the time accumulating more
[16:34.160 --> 16:39.120]  power and wealth for themselves but what I'm afraid is going to happen is that
[16:39.120 --> 16:47.400]  they are going to over destabilize and they will in effect create their own
[16:47.400 --> 16:52.080]  downfall and perhaps the downfall of all the western nations in the process
[16:52.080 --> 17:00.320]  they're hoping that they can kind of walk that tightrope and carry on year
[17:00.320 --> 17:05.120]  after year after year but I'm afraid it's going to come back and blow up in
[17:05.120 --> 17:09.760]  their face because a lot of these terrorist groups that there they have
[17:09.760 --> 17:16.000]  created don't have any compunctions at all against using what true true weapons
[17:16.000 --> 17:22.520]  of mass destruction so that Wall Street itself may be the next ground zero and
[17:22.520 --> 17:30.080]  their best leg plans of these totalitarian one of these is going to
[17:30.080 --> 17:34.640]  come back in and halt them. Well you just crystallized it perfectly I want you to
[17:34.640 --> 17:39.920]  continue but I just want to back up sir what you were just saying obviously I
[17:39.920 --> 17:42.840]  know you're retired you talked a lot of your sources in government I have
[17:42.840 --> 17:48.320]  amazing sources high-level in government but also out people say well I mean how
[17:48.320 --> 17:51.200]  do you do that they're going up for whistleblowers things are so bad now
[17:51.200 --> 17:56.240]  that mainly the US Army strangely enough that's just a historical one of the
[17:56.240 --> 17:59.400]  oldest institutions in this country has been the main group inside the Pentagon
[17:59.400 --> 18:03.520]  saying no to Syria no to all these events no to double-crossing Egypt and
[18:03.520 --> 18:09.000]  they are basically telling the neocons the left and the socialists you better
[18:09.000 --> 18:14.180]  stop it and there's such a socialist vein in this godless atheist neural
[18:14.180 --> 18:17.680]  order culture that really the only audiology they have is destroy the
[18:17.680 --> 18:22.000]  better clangers destroy the farms collectivize everything under corporate
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  control you know type of high-tech fascist great leap forward not
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.440]  communist but fascist more like and that they're blowing the engine that made the
[18:32.440 --> 18:37.900]  globalist have a major command base and that the military not even because the
[18:37.900 --> 18:41.520]  top brass and statisticians are angels but because they want to keep playing
[18:41.520 --> 18:45.440]  golf and don't want their grandkids killed they're saying stop it right now
[18:45.440 --> 18:49.800]  you're about to bring civilization down by crisis creation because you keep
[18:49.800 --> 18:53.120]  getting more power out of crises but at a certain point this black hole is gonna
[18:53.120 --> 18:56.400]  swallow you now that message you just kind of threw out is the message I've
[18:56.400 --> 19:00.040]  been getting for about six years from high-level Pentagon people and others
[19:00.040 --> 19:04.600]  that obviously use this show as a conduit to warn people but now even down to
[19:04.600 --> 19:08.880]  low-level enlisted officers they know the military basically has been warned
[19:08.880 --> 19:14.520]  about 90% of the armies on board about 60% of Marines are on board about 60% of
[19:14.520 --> 19:17.160]  the Navy knows what's going on for whatever reason the Navy is not doing
[19:17.160 --> 19:21.840]  too good waking up that's just kind of a dead reckoning number but this is
[19:21.840 --> 19:24.680]  really a big deal where you almost have a Mexican standoff between
[19:24.680 --> 19:28.800]  institutions in our government newer more corrupt private contractor
[19:28.800 --> 19:33.780]  institutions and delusional people like Hillary and Samantha Powers and Obama
[19:33.780 --> 19:38.000]  who have no idea what they're doing and watch Sports Center all day at least
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.360]  Hitler was in a bunker when he was endangering his whole country and doing
[19:41.360 --> 19:45.320]  super dangerous stuff and knew he could lose and had been in the military these
[19:45.320 --> 19:48.680]  people are completely out of their minds and it really is frightening to see
[19:48.680 --> 19:51.960]  them not knowing what they're doing and is that what you're basically coming
[19:51.960 --> 19:59.960]  down to yes I agree with you Alex but there is a level of self-delusion that
[19:59.960 --> 20:06.480]  now exists amongst the powers that be that's unprecedented and the their
[20:06.480 --> 20:11.800]  level of control over the economy over the stock markets manipulating the
[20:11.800 --> 20:16.200]  derivatives market manipulating the precious metals market which is a very
[20:16.200 --> 20:22.000]  thin market the level of control they have is frightening and again it's
[20:22.000 --> 20:26.760]  likely to come back and blow up in their faces and it's the law of unintended
[20:26.760 --> 20:32.840]  consequences so I for many years you've talked about the Hegelian dialectic
[20:32.840 --> 20:39.760]  and it's been employed heavily for the last seven years under the Obama
[20:39.760 --> 20:47.360]  administration and my fear is that regardless of who comes in in the
[20:47.360 --> 20:53.920]  next administration we're probably going to see a statist of some sort who's
[20:53.920 --> 20:59.920]  going to want to continue playing the same game playing this the same political
[20:59.920 --> 21:08.000]  games playing pressure groups off of one another trying to increase divisiveness
[21:08.000 --> 21:17.440]  within our own country by bringing in almost uncontrolled immigration of
[21:17.440 --> 21:23.720]  Islamists who are not going to be properly vetted at all and in fact right
[21:23.720 --> 21:29.040]  now there seems to be a preference within the the US State Department to
[21:29.040 --> 21:34.880]  bring in Islamists rather than persecuted Christians so what does that tell us it
[21:34.880 --> 21:43.600]  tells us that they want a lack of stability they want to put people at
[21:43.600 --> 21:51.000]  odds with one another to create friction and out of that friction their you know
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.600]  it's the Hegelian dialectic again they create the crisis and out of that crisis
[21:55.600 --> 22:03.520]  comes their solution which is all stage managed to fill their coffers and to
[22:03.520 --> 22:10.560]  build political power and then under their agenda 21 depopulation program
[22:10.560 --> 22:15.080]  they codify the cosmology of us being poor and them being rich as their
[22:15.080 --> 22:20.680]  guardians getting rid of the scourge of humanity all perfectly scripted where
[22:20.680 --> 22:25.600]  they play savior of the earth while they literally block industrialization block
[22:25.600 --> 22:33.320]  systems that would set up a two to child family with all the actuaries we know
[22:33.320 --> 22:40.400]  that lead towards stabilization global prosperity and a new Renaissance and they
[22:40.400 --> 22:46.400]  themselves going back even to Bertrand Russell and the nonfiction books of
[22:46.400 --> 22:51.400]  H.G. Wells and Galton all the rest of them admit a hundred years ago that they
[22:51.400 --> 22:54.240]  were gonna have to block a new Renaissance and quote kill a lot of
[22:54.240 --> 22:58.840]  beautiful and gallant gallant people to quote H.G. Wells to get their new world
[22:58.840 --> 23:03.120]  order and even wrote the book and had the movie things to come the movie came
[23:03.120 --> 23:08.080]  out in the early 30s where they set up a world government run by a UN that flies
[23:08.080 --> 23:13.280]  around in giant B2 style bombers actually shows B2 bombers right nerve
[23:13.280 --> 23:18.800]  gassing nation-states and taking the guns from the people and depopulating the
[23:18.800 --> 23:22.120]  planet I mean these people are completely out of their minds but the
[23:22.120 --> 23:25.480]  thing is they've got control because the British Empire got behind them and
[23:25.480 --> 23:30.760]  funded this wild dream and mr. Rawls looks like they're pretty much getting
[23:30.760 --> 23:36.400]  there do you think they'll succeed it seems like it you mentioned H.G. Wells
[23:36.400 --> 23:41.200]  and things to come he was a socialist but he was very prescient about what
[23:41.200 --> 23:46.600]  might happen and you'll notice that in this in the storyline of things to come
[23:46.600 --> 23:51.960]  though the way that they were able to create their global governance was out
[23:51.960 --> 23:59.720]  of the aftermath of a global socioeconomic collapse following war
[23:59.720 --> 24:05.560]  after war after war it looks a lot like what we're seeing right now and that's
[24:05.560 --> 24:10.760]  why his boss as you know anybody look this up the letters the writings are
[24:10.760 --> 24:14.840]  public the man that basically took the British Empire and folded it into the
[24:14.840 --> 24:19.640]  US Empire Cecil Rhodes and the Rhodes scholars envision the whole plan we're
[24:19.640 --> 24:27.680]  currently living under yeah and it's the ironically the the legacy of Cecil
[24:27.680 --> 24:37.040]  Rhodes was is now being protested in South Africa they don't want anything to
[24:37.040 --> 24:43.720]  do with with any of the colonialist
[24:45.200 --> 24:49.520]  any that history they wanted their take they're literally tearing down statues
[24:49.520 --> 24:58.960]  in in South Africa at the universities right now Cecil Rhodes really had had a
[24:58.960 --> 25:04.680]  view not just for the African continent not just as they said in those days
[25:04.680 --> 25:12.480]  Cape to Cairo but for the whole world and his a lot of his protégés ended up
[25:12.480 --> 25:17.840]  creating organizations like the CFR and the Trilateral Commission and so forth
[25:17.840 --> 25:27.560]  years later it's all been an almost uninterrupted chain of this quest for
[25:27.560 --> 25:35.680]  global dominance global control and they they very wisely co-opted the
[25:35.680 --> 25:41.800]  educational system the mass media and the banking system and let's be clear go
[25:41.800 --> 25:46.960]  further again that you're getting inside scooper listeners Cecil Rhodes all the
[25:46.960 --> 25:50.960]  rest of it they even said and he wrote you can read it a hundred years ago we
[25:50.960 --> 25:54.800]  will then even finally get rid of the trappings of the Empire the flags the
[25:54.800 --> 25:59.280]  statues the parades the uniforms and it'll be invisible through our corporate
[25:59.280 --> 26:02.640]  interlocking directorates like the Royal Institute of International Affairs the
[26:02.640 --> 26:07.280]  Council on Foreign Relations and it'll be multinational and now that's why it at
[26:07.280 --> 26:12.840]  Oxford in places they're supporting you know pulling down bust of the Queen and
[26:12.840 --> 26:17.320]  and that's why Obama sent back the bust of Churchill is because they're going to
[26:17.320 --> 26:21.360]  even let the socialists and leftists pull that down and believe they've
[26:21.360 --> 26:25.320]  defeated it when they've actually are helping it bring in the next phase the
[26:25.320 --> 26:31.920]  end of free speech I mean these folks are so sophisticated it is indeed and it
[26:31.920 --> 26:43.120]  is it's a a it's worth mentioning that 20 years ago the socialists in England
[26:43.120 --> 26:51.600]  turned their own flag the Union Jack into a supposed symbol of racism and
[26:51.600 --> 26:59.760]  colonialism and they declared that that the Union Jack couldn't be used in
[26:59.760 --> 27:03.920]  political rallies and protests right the fact the police are going to arrest you
[27:03.920 --> 27:10.280]  right that was 20 years ago and at the time I I was in shock and disbelief that
[27:10.280 --> 27:14.880]  that could happen but right now in America we're on the verge of that
[27:14.880 --> 27:20.640]  happening with our own American flag exactly they start with the rebel
[27:20.640 --> 27:24.400]  battle flag it doesn't do with slavery but ignorant people are told so so what
[27:24.400 --> 27:27.480]  of some toothless races drive around whether it's not what symbolizes and
[27:27.480 --> 27:32.600]  then now they want the American flag and to expand on that it's that was only
[27:32.600 --> 27:36.840]  one symbol of empire the globalists have conquered the Rothschild's others have
[27:36.840 --> 27:40.680]  conquered England they're using that model and the people they use to enforce
[27:40.680 --> 27:45.180]  it upon the world it's moved on from England it's still based there to a
[27:45.180 --> 27:48.880]  certain extent but now they're demonizing anything Western when it's
[27:48.880 --> 27:53.440]  England that ended slavery worldwide it's England that brought forward the
[27:53.440 --> 27:57.440]  abolitionist movement and now in the ultimate victory while slavery goes on
[27:57.440 --> 28:01.840]  in more than 10 Muslim nations today and women are slaves and hundreds of
[28:01.840 --> 28:06.720]  nations it's okay because the greatest evil on earth is England where we got
[28:06.720 --> 28:13.160]  Magna Carta and the beginning of the Renaissance you're so right Alex it's
[28:13.160 --> 28:22.160]  it's just almost a sweet irony to see that the the symbols of what really
[28:22.160 --> 28:29.360]  stand for freedom are being stood on their head and the institutions that
[28:29.360 --> 28:35.560]  really stand for individual liberty are being denigrated while everything that
[28:35.560 --> 28:45.600]  represents statism control collectivism socialism are being lifted up by
[28:45.600 --> 28:52.640]  people like the Obama administration by all the socialists of Europe and so
[28:52.640 --> 29:00.000]  forth right now we are living in what I refer to as the age of deception and
[29:00.000 --> 29:06.440]  betrayal where our basic institutions are that anything that stands for
[29:06.440 --> 29:12.680]  freedom is being cast in a bad light we are living in the true fall of the west
[29:12.680 --> 29:16.760]  and all the wealth and the cultural wealth being flushed on the toilet when
[29:16.760 --> 29:19.640]  we come back sir I want to talk about what that looks like what comes on the
[29:19.640 --> 29:23.160]  other side if we don't beat it and where you think we are in the fight against it
[29:23.160 --> 29:26.720]  amazing guest James Wesley Rawls we need to get him on more and more be such a
[29:26.720 --> 29:30.200]  busy guy usually only come home for an hour and that's rarely he offered two
[29:30.200 --> 29:33.800]  hours today I may just push the the reporters even though I love them and
[29:33.800 --> 29:37.280]  want them on into the fourth hour check with night see if that's good with him
[29:37.280 --> 29:40.480]  in the first 30 minutes because I want to really walk through all this and look
[29:40.480 --> 29:44.440]  at the different sectors of the globe and the master plan because knowing this
[29:44.440 --> 29:48.520]  plan this is a plan I mean this is public folks knowing the plan is our
[29:48.520 --> 29:52.360]  chance to beat it you understand how important this is we're on the March the
[29:52.360 --> 29:59.400]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:16.440 --> 33:19.440]  radio network
[33:32.200 --> 33:35.360]  ladies and gentlemen I don't get up here and say all these things have a
[33:35.360 --> 33:39.840]  sensational show believe me reality is sensation reality is dangerous it's
[33:39.840 --> 33:46.280]  crazy it's real and I never imagined 21 years ago going on air local access
[33:46.280 --> 33:49.720]  an old radio I'd be here with tens of millions of people every week
[33:49.720 --> 33:54.600]  conservatively way more than that it's ridiculous tuning in all over the world
[33:54.600 --> 34:00.360]  but the good news is the facts we're covering are what the real insiders good
[34:00.360 --> 34:05.560]  and bad know what's going on the elite have been so arrogant for decades they've
[34:05.560 --> 34:09.880]  admitted so much of their plan so their own people could understand it thinking
[34:09.880 --> 34:13.760]  you'd never go look it up well we've been making preparations to resist to
[34:13.760 --> 34:17.800]  slow this down it's over 15 years behind most experts agree but now they're
[34:17.800 --> 34:22.480]  accelerating we're gonna talk to mr. Rawls about where this system of
[34:22.480 --> 34:26.840]  betrayal is going the caliphate they're setting up clearly the elite are out
[34:26.840 --> 34:30.360]  alive with radical Islam turning it loose to take over the rest of Islam and
[34:30.360 --> 34:34.200]  to bring it into our countries that that's happening that's one area I
[34:34.200 --> 34:37.960]  underestimated it's so bold it's so over the top that I would hear people like
[34:37.960 --> 34:41.120]  Rawls saying this 10 years ago and I thought yeah I could see that down the
[34:41.120 --> 34:45.880]  road but you know not in 10 20 years well it's it's happening quicker so I
[34:45.880 --> 34:50.480]  gotta say that we're gonna really be focusing on this a lot obviously before
[34:50.480 --> 34:54.880]  I go any further the soils as you know are depleted most areas so a lot of the
[34:54.880 --> 34:57.560]  food you eat a lot of the vegetables you eat just don't have the trace elements
[34:57.560 --> 35:01.600]  all the different vitamins and minerals you need we've developed with our

[35:37.720 --> 35:44.600]  them on something like vitamin mineral fusion and watch what happens the amount
[35:44.600 --> 35:48.320]  of energy I get from this is incredible and it doesn't have any stimulus in it

[38:11.440 --> 38:15.040]  the country that's safer to get to I hope it doesn't get to that but the
[38:15.040 --> 38:19.000]  depressions here it's going to get worse society's already unraveling the police
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.320]  state isn't going to save us we're gonna talk about preparedness with mr. Rawls
[38:22.320 --> 38:27.960]  as well coming up survival blog.com again formerly with army intelligence and
[38:27.960 --> 38:30.840]  of course nobody in the army ever brags about the stuff they did but I ran into
[38:30.840 --> 38:35.520]  a colonel and then to another lieutenant colonel that we talked to and then I ran
[38:35.520 --> 38:41.280]  into another gentleman who I'd met before but looked up he's in civilian life
[38:41.280 --> 38:46.800]  now and developing stuff for different agencies and he told me his name he gave
[38:46.800 --> 38:51.560]  me his card I forget it's at home but but I was down at the courthouse taking care
[38:51.560 --> 38:54.680]  of something and he was saying oh yeah you know Rawls used to work for me he's
[38:54.680 --> 38:58.680]  a great guy so that three different people who tune into the show you're
[38:58.680 --> 39:01.720]  just talking about the great stuff mr. Rawls has done for America which which
[39:01.720 --> 39:04.880]  we'll never hear about you know the quiet professionals but he just really
[39:04.880 --> 39:07.480]  knows what he's talking about and we love having him on I want to get into the
[39:07.480 --> 39:11.280]  call of fate your latest novel which is a smart way to educate people obviously
[39:11.280 --> 39:15.080]  they seem to listen to stuff that's fiction even though it's real versus
[39:15.080 --> 39:19.800]  stuff that's real they seem to ignore it but we'll talk about that as well but
[39:19.800 --> 39:25.320]  survival the economy where you think Obama is going the rest of it but as we
[39:25.320 --> 39:32.160]  went to break mr. Rawls you brought up the situation with the age of deception
[39:32.160 --> 39:38.880]  the age of betrayal is this the beginning of the fall why are they so naked
[39:38.880 --> 39:43.280]  now what do you think of Donald Trump why are they so scared of him because
[39:43.280 --> 39:46.920]  quite frankly I didn't trust him a year ago he's involved in casinos and things
[39:46.920 --> 39:51.440]  and I'm not in a really being super flashy it kind of turns me off but but
[39:51.440 --> 39:56.160]  at the same time he was against NAFTA and get 20 years ago he is a nationalist
[39:56.160 --> 39:59.720]  I know people that know him before he ever ran for office that said oh you
[39:59.720 --> 40:04.040]  didn't know Donald Trump's anti-New World Order and so all this click for me
[40:04.040 --> 40:08.960]  about six seven months ago that they're scared of him for some reason this
[40:08.960 --> 40:13.400]  couldn't be a foil this couldn't be a double-cross could it but I want your
[40:13.400 --> 40:17.120]  real view on that as well but let's get into the age of betrayal the age of
[40:17.120 --> 40:21.120]  deception where you think the world is right now and then into this election
[40:21.120 --> 40:27.960]  and and into the caliphate well Alex I think that Donald Trump I think is
[40:27.960 --> 40:33.920]  popular because he represents at least an outsider to the political system and
[40:33.920 --> 40:39.880]  people are definitely fed up with insider after insider after insider
[40:39.880 --> 40:45.520]  being offered up as as candidates and while I don't think Donald Trump is a
[40:45.520 --> 40:51.520]  perfect candidate I think that he at least resonates with a lot of people as
[40:51.520 --> 41:03.000]  representing old-school American nationalism national sovereignty and as a
[41:03.000 --> 41:10.160]  counterbalance to the forces of international banking now unfortunately he
[41:10.160 --> 41:16.080]  he has some compromises in his in his background that make him kind of
[41:16.080 --> 41:20.200]  suspect because of the actually connections to the Clintons of all
[41:20.200 --> 41:27.600]  people and his many business connections with the bankers so I find it
[41:27.600 --> 41:33.360]  really difficult to believe that he's a true outsider but he certainly
[41:33.360 --> 41:42.000]  represents more of an outsider than sure then certainly the Hillary or Sanders
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.200]  let me ask you this then the all hands on deck scenario and I read what you
[41:46.200 --> 41:49.920]  just said the all hands deck scenario from the communist Chinese government
[41:49.920 --> 41:52.880]  the Mexican government the former president the British government to the
[41:52.880 --> 41:56.880]  pope to you name it coming every magazine every newspaper coming on against
[41:56.880 --> 42:01.320]  him I see real hysteria and real hate and real concern and the big billionaires
[42:01.320 --> 42:05.200]  getting together and given hundreds of millions to beat him I see that as them
[42:05.200 --> 42:09.000]  legitimately hitting the panic button because they see the nationalism he's
[42:09.000 --> 42:14.160]  saying even if he's not really a good guy is irrevocable damage to them but it
[42:14.160 --> 42:17.680]  also shows how arrogant they are to think we can have all these foreign
[42:17.680 --> 42:23.280]  governments lecture us how deep into globalist colonialism we really are I
[42:23.280 --> 42:31.680]  yeah the the amount of vitriol that's being directed against him is evidence
[42:31.680 --> 42:36.960]  that the powers that be are feeling very nervous very anxious that they're
[42:36.960 --> 42:42.800]  losing control of the political process because for years and years we've had
[42:42.800 --> 42:48.840]  political party a versus political party b and lo and behold the candidates for
[42:48.840 --> 42:55.080]  both of those parties have been insiders they've all been CFR or
[42:55.080 --> 43:04.360]  trilateral Commission related individuals every time we've we've been given a so
[43:04.360 --> 43:08.880]  called choice on the ballot that really isn't a choice it's either political
[43:08.880 --> 43:16.120]  insider a or political insider b and for them to see Trump on the horizon is
[43:16.120 --> 43:22.640]  truly truly frightening to them to see anything outside of their stage
[43:22.640 --> 43:27.040]  managed operation we're seeing a de facto response to populism whether he
[43:27.040 --> 43:31.800]  be real or not it's kind of like you know putting up a fake owl to scare away
[43:31.800 --> 43:35.120]  crows they just see an owl and are upset they don't know if it's real or not
[43:35.120 --> 43:39.400]  they're trying to figure out if it's real but it scares them yes that's
[43:39.400 --> 43:47.160]  that's essentially it the the the folks that want to control the the whole the
[43:47.160 --> 43:52.960]  whole game really they want to control us economically politically in every at
[43:52.960 --> 43:59.680]  every sphere basically look at people like Donald Trump as wildcards and
[43:59.680 --> 44:09.480]  because they are out he's outside of their control he's and he is unpredictable it
[44:09.480 --> 44:13.240]  really throws a monkey wrench into their plans do you think he realizes how much
[44:13.240 --> 44:20.160]  danger he's in probably not anyone who goes up against Hillary Clinton ought to
[44:20.160 --> 44:27.400]  be really really worried them right his chances of making it at at body
[44:27.400 --> 44:33.400]  temperature to the to the election I would say are actually fairly small I
[44:33.400 --> 44:39.040]  would not be surprised to see that he mysteriously dies of an aneurysm or a
[44:39.040 --> 44:48.640]  heart attack or or or you know something anything but his the chances of him
[44:48.640 --> 44:53.640]  making the election I think are small if if he's truly is the threat that they
[44:53.640 --> 44:58.920]  think he is have you ever in your decades of being politically involved 30 years
[44:58.920 --> 45:02.880]  or so since you got on the army have you ever mr. Rawls James Jose Rawls
[45:02.880 --> 45:06.840]  revival blog.com joining us from the top most respected survivalist and global
[45:06.840 --> 45:10.400]  security experts out there and not just with the general public but with the
[45:10.400 --> 45:13.400]  Pentagon you name it everybody really respects him and I know have you ever
[45:13.400 --> 45:17.040]  seen a more dangerous time not just for America but the world I mean this is just
[45:17.040 --> 45:21.400]  for me looking at this is unprecedented the amount of dominoes lined up the
[45:21.400 --> 45:26.560]  amount of triggers being thrown the elite scurrying around building armored
[45:26.560 --> 45:30.760]  redoubts I mean government all over the world is acting like something big is
[45:30.760 --> 45:36.440]  coming. It's truly unprecedented because if you look at the mountain of debt and
[45:36.440 --> 45:41.520]  the scale of the derivatives that have built up that's one huge threat and
[45:41.520 --> 45:46.440]  meanwhile geopolitically we see a regional war in Syria that could very
[45:46.440 --> 45:50.920]  well blow up in World War three and we see tension in the sites in the
[45:50.920 --> 45:55.800]  South China Sea which could very well blow up into another world war we are
[45:55.800 --> 46:03.120]  truly in uncharted waters here we have a situation that where the the global
[46:03.120 --> 46:10.760]  economy is teetering on the brink we have the central banks are right now in
[46:10.760 --> 46:15.600]  the process of going to sub zero interest rates which is an absolute panic
[46:15.600 --> 46:20.600]  move they have basically run out of ammunition in the economic that's like
[46:20.600 --> 46:27.920]  injecting adrenaline directly into the heart yeah I think that at this at this
[46:27.920 --> 46:34.720]  point we are teetering on the brink of either economic collapse or global war
[46:34.720 --> 46:41.760]  as as kind of the final option for the insiders to have their way because
[46:41.760 --> 46:45.800]  without either of those we're just simply going to see the truth come out
[46:45.800 --> 46:53.480]  what's happened with the Panama Papers I think is just one's little glimpse of the
[46:53.480 --> 47:00.960]  extent of the international financial web that exists well from what I've
[47:00.960 --> 47:04.000]  seen it looks like it's a Western attempt to just go after Putin and
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.280]  certainly Putin's involved in a bunch of stuff but it seems selective to some
[47:07.280 --> 47:12.280]  mid-level networks highly selective yes and if you'll notice they're mainly
[47:12.280 --> 47:18.120]  pointing the pig pointing the finger at African dictators for example with these
[47:18.120 --> 47:24.880]  these trust arrangements with you know bearer want bearer number number one or
[47:24.880 --> 47:33.160]  bearer number two for example as the beneficiaries the the serious money the
[47:33.160 --> 47:38.400]  big money is being traded in the hot markets every day it's not these these
[47:38.400 --> 47:44.440]  tiny little you know I say relatively tiny these billion dollar trusts that
[47:44.440 --> 47:51.920]  are being set up by the in to benefit that the children of Middle Eastern and
[47:51.920 --> 47:58.400]  African dictators are small change compared to the trillions of dollars
[47:58.400 --> 48:03.200]  that are that are flowing internationally the manipulation that's going on in the
[48:03.200 --> 48:07.920]  currency markets the you mentioned earlier credit default swaps people have
[48:07.920 --> 48:14.160]  no idea about the the the scope of the derivatives trading that goes on a CDS a
[48:14.160 --> 48:22.840]  credit default swap is a form of derivative and that is so well refined
[48:22.840 --> 48:30.480]  as a derivative that a movement as small as one tenth of 1% of an interest
[48:30.480 --> 48:36.680]  rate can put a major shockwave through the system and unfortunately the way
[48:36.680 --> 48:42.920]  this derivatives casino has built up it's so finely tuned that when a big swing
[48:42.920 --> 48:46.960]  does happen where interest rates move a whole percentage point or two percentage
[48:46.960 --> 48:50.440]  points it's going to absolutely collapse the system well James I want to talk
[48:50.440 --> 48:53.360]  triggers with you I want to get into caliphate I just want to go ahead I'm
[48:53.360 --> 48:55.840]  gonna have you through the whole next hour we're gonna have reporters on in
[48:55.840 --> 48:58.760]  the fourth hour with David Knight he has another guest popping in as well but
[48:58.760 --> 49:04.760]  looking at this here's a telegraph article China jitters could trigger global
[49:04.760 --> 49:08.880]  market bloodbath IMF warrants I love how the very progenitors of this whole scam
[49:08.880 --> 49:12.440]  warn us and then you know the former head of the Fed that helped give us the
[49:12.440 --> 49:17.640]  derivatives with Clinton Greenspan warns us of irrational exuberance it's like
[49:17.640 --> 49:21.640]  selling a kid a bag full of crack and giving him a pipe and saying look out
[49:21.640 --> 49:27.480]  this might be addicting but it's just amazing but but getting back to things
[49:27.480 --> 49:31.480]  I see as problems that nobody talks about it and I'm not bragging when I say
[49:31.480 --> 49:36.240]  one thing that launched our show I'm opposed to me like 19 years ago as I
[49:36.240 --> 49:39.880]  put out some police state films show in the military training for gun
[49:39.880 --> 49:43.320]  confiscation and things domestically and then the and then the army and
[49:43.320 --> 49:47.000]  Marines said don't watch Alex Jones videos and don't go to his website well
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.720]  that meant I suddenly had this huge audience of the military tune in what
[49:50.720 --> 49:54.880]  was the establishment thinking my audience probably quadrupled overnight
[49:54.880 --> 49:58.120]  when they started doing that that actually launched us was them saying
[49:58.120 --> 50:01.560]  don't go here so they seem like they're smart but they also seem like they're
[50:01.560 --> 50:05.480]  dumb now I was totally unpolished them still aren't but but knew more than the
[50:05.480 --> 50:09.200]  average person so the show got very popular I became a source because then
[50:09.200 --> 50:12.520]  all these people sort of giving me stuff because nobody else would would talk
[50:12.520 --> 50:18.120]  about it here we are 20 years later and the military listens to the show foreign
[50:18.120 --> 50:22.000]  governments listen to it they listen to others like it but it shows how bad the
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.280]  rest of media is is that we're some of the you know best that's out there I'm
[50:25.280 --> 50:29.160]  not bragging but to know that most the military is aware of what's going on
[50:29.160 --> 50:32.920]  says they're not going to go along with the globalist takeover that's got a
[50:32.920 --> 50:37.000]  really cause a problem and I'm not saying I'm behind this I'm one small part
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.520]  of it but I'm a gauge because I interface with these people on the street you
[50:41.520 --> 50:46.120]  name it so I know how awake they are does the establishment realize that they
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.520]  still currently say don't go to infowars.com and don't go to your site and
[50:50.520 --> 50:54.200]  a bunch of others as you know don't they understand that's backfiring with the

[54:09.880 --> 54:21.240]  your mind
[54:21.240 --> 54:25.360]  okay we're gonna get back to that point that the mr. Rawls got cut off on as we
[54:25.360 --> 54:30.200]  went to break where I was asking the question about the military and I'm not
[54:30.200 --> 54:33.360]  branding them as the heroes or anything these are people have actually been in
[54:33.360 --> 54:36.240]  the real world on average they know about the corruption they know about the
[54:36.240 --> 54:39.680]  system and that's always been the problem of dictators or oligarchies
[54:39.680 --> 54:43.040]  is the security service is turning against them and look at operation
[54:43.040 --> 54:46.640]  valkyrie and hitler the problem is this is an oligarchy it's a whole bunch of
[54:46.640 --> 54:49.760]  people it's not one guy so we're gonna talk about that briefly start the next
[54:49.760 --> 54:54.400]  hour but here's an example I get up Saturday I'll see a headline Muslim
[54:54.400 --> 55:00.680]  woman run over by right-wing nationalist in Molan beat and I read the article
[55:00.680 --> 55:05.120]  from the Daily Mail and it never says who they are they've been caught I know
[55:05.120 --> 55:08.040]  that doesn't sound right that sounds like a false flag because the radical
[55:08.040 --> 55:12.480]  Muslims are experts at this he runs out and it looks staged and jumps in front
[55:12.480 --> 55:18.600]  of the car just like they you know stage the dead baby on the beach in Greece and
[55:18.600 --> 55:22.480]  all that I go to the comments everybody's mad thinking we're the ones
[55:22.480 --> 55:26.240]  saying this will go to our go to our info wars and I'll show you perfect
[55:26.240 --> 55:29.960]  moment Muslim woman is mowed down by grinning driver who then stops to take
[55:29.960 --> 55:36.720]  picture during anti oh they changed the headline look when this came out ah now
[55:36.720 --> 55:47.640]  right Bart Molan big far right hit and run was Muslim on Muslim attack a local
[55:47.640 --> 55:51.480]  drunk youth named Muhammad it hit and run by a Muslim woman in Molan big this
[55:51.480 --> 55:55.360]  week blamed on far right anti-islam administrators was in fact perpetrated by
[55:55.360 --> 55:59.920]  an allegedly drunk local youth named Muhammad so I don't mean to just you
[55:59.920 --> 56:04.240]  know divert off but it's this constant lying and then saying German men raped
[56:04.240 --> 56:07.800]  the women in Cologne and all this they're almost all military age men they
[56:07.800 --> 56:12.320]  invaded Syria they're coming in now Europe's bringing we're going to talk
[56:12.320 --> 56:15.560]  about that at the start of the next hour with mr. Rawls but the time we have sir
[56:15.560 --> 56:20.400]  in the short segment getting back to you the next four minutes specifically with
[56:20.400 --> 56:23.800]  my military question what are they thinking when they say don't visit
[56:23.800 --> 56:28.480]  Patriot sides don't you know George Washington's bad the founding fathers
[56:28.480 --> 56:32.280]  are bad they actually as you know teach the military that that's actually woke
[56:32.280 --> 56:36.720]  in the military up what are the globalists thinking well they're hoping
[56:36.720 --> 56:43.480]  that they can control the military but the problem is even with a dumb down
[56:43.480 --> 56:50.280]  electorate a dumb down populace that's reaching military age even with that
[56:50.280 --> 56:55.800]  people still have basic common sense and they can see the what's going on in the
[56:55.800 --> 57:00.880]  world around them they get curious they now turn to the Internet it used to be
[57:00.880 --> 57:04.320]  newsletters and magazines and that sort of thing but they turned to the Internet
[57:04.320 --> 57:12.640]  to seek the truth and they're hoping that they can control access to that
[57:12.640 --> 57:20.880]  knowledge to keep that knowledge out of the hands of the people that they want
[57:20.880 --> 57:27.120]  to have as their foot soldiers it's not working they tried firewalling more than
[57:27.120 --> 57:34.280]  a thousand Patriot websites at the Pentagon two years ago and there was a
[57:34.280 --> 57:41.080]  quiet rebellion that went on where first people were saying well you can't
[57:41.080 --> 57:47.160]  firewall us or if you firewall us only firewall us firewall us during working
[57:47.160 --> 57:53.200]  hours but we want to have unlimited Internet access before working hours on
[57:53.200 --> 58:00.440]  our lunch hour and after work and the IT staff at the Pentagon back down they
[58:00.440 --> 58:06.160]  actually relented because there was such there were so many people at the
[58:06.160 --> 58:09.800]  Pentagon that were upset about and that's what I'm getting at don't they
[58:09.800 --> 58:13.400]  understand that when they tried to blacklist you and myself and others that
[58:13.400 --> 58:16.120]  just made everybody come check out what we're saying they here were telling the
[58:16.120 --> 58:20.320]  truth and then I mean it backfired didn't quite what happened was people were
[58:20.320 --> 58:28.080]  were using VPN virtual private networks or web surfing from at home or web
[58:28.080 --> 58:36.320]  surfing from wireless networks literally from their mobile devices in the
[58:36.320 --> 58:40.440]  parking lot of the pentagon stay there was back in 70 seconds this is a
[58:40.440 --> 58:44.920]  microcosm of everything they're not invincible folks the globalist and be
[58:44.920 --> 58:48.720]  defeated if you realize you have the power you are the resistance back in
[58:48.720 --> 58:50.760]  70 stay with us

[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.120]  segment this is a short segment in the long segment we're gonna get into the
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.840]  caliphate his latest novel and and what the next big shoot a drop in his brain
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:01.240]  is with the man that heads up survival blog comm James Wesley Rawls I'm Alex
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:06.520]  Jones of info wars comm and present planet comm but getting back to what you
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.360]  were just saying to me this is key because I used to get mad at police and
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.840]  some of the police state stuff I realized that's what they're being trained to do
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.440]  is we should change it above them that's our political job but on average cops
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:24.560]  tend to be more awake than the general public and I mean some jurisdictions are
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.080]  very corrupt but others are pretty good folks overall and so that's why you've
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.760]  got the black lives matter the UN strong cities initiative coming in to take
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:38.640]  over I mean it's actually happening and so we also have the military even more
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.040]  awake so they're saying the number one domestic enemy will be returning
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.640]  veterans and gun owners well that woke up military training to take on domestic
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.160]  terrorists that are being taught are themselves so there's a major disconnect
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:55.200]  to the elites and if they would have disconnects like not realizing when you
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:00.600]  tell Marines and Army troops on bases across the country don't go to info wars
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.640]  dot com that they're all gonna go to info wars dot com or when they get up
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.720]  there and badmout the founders and Christians and gun owners and make the
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.600]  men wear red high heel shoes that it's not demoralizing them it's turning them
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.360]  against their controllers there's you take a bunch of socialist engineers give
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.720]  them ROTC merit give them an officers commission stick them in the military it's
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.960]  so alien they've caused a total wake-up I mean I I really see this is one of the
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:30.760]  biggest missteps ever go ahead sir and give me your view on that we are in a
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:38.920]  situation where there the the controllers are losing control because
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:44.880]  there's so many different channels of media now available they basically can't
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:51.880]  stop the signal the truth is out there it's people like you and bloggers and
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:59.160]  podcasters and journalists non mainstream journalists that are who are
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:04.280]  waking people up to the truth as a lot of those people are in military
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:10.880]  organizations they're people as I mentioned before at the Pentagon for
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:17.640]  example people who are on general staffs people who are in in military
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.040]  intelligence and most people don't realize that there's as many people in
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:27.240]  military intelligence with the different military services as there are with the
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:33.680]  the CIA and the NSA and the NRO for example there is from my sources much
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.480]  thing they're perfectly good but the army groups and others are basically
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.280]  battling the foreign interests that have come in and taken over the CIA and
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:44.320]  there's been a decades-long war now emerging where more and more army
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:48.200]  officers are even able to go on air now and actively badmouth the corrupt system
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:52.880]  which for folks that don't know is basically mutiny but it's not mutiny
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:58.000]  because the military realizes the country's now been captured right there's
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.560]  definitely different competing camps within the intelligence agencies and
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:13.000]  within the military a lot of the really conservative libertarian and you know
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:21.360]  freedom-minded general officers were purged during the the seven years of
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:28.360]  the Obama administration but there's still a lot of people in the enlisted
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:33.440]  ranks warrant officers junior officers that up into the field grade officers
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:39.520]  who have a concept of American liberty and they cannot quench that they can't
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.520]  they can't just they just can't put that fire this is the key to everything
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:47.080]  stay there I want you to come back and speak to this at length then get into
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:51.560]  the caliphate survival blog.com this is the key they've already decapitated the
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:54.160]  federal government brought in their operatives but the people that actually
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:59.960]  run the military are still there and they're awake now this is a key time
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.840]  Joe Bates here with info wars.com and I'm here to report you teach at a new

[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:20.440]  listening to alex jones
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:30.840]  about 160 years ago 165 years ago the British crown was having trouble
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.920]  expanding and maintaining its empire so they financed their top side this is
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:38.280]  all in books that have been published at the time and since then they come up
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:43.440]  with social engineering and social control and to develop machines that
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:48.000]  can track and trace everyone and to develop a cultural systems of what they
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.760]  called mind war that was actually a British term and then it was picked up
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:09:00.320]  by the Germans it's what they call psyops or psychological warfare but what
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:03.680]  happens when people in the endgame realize that they're the target of it
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:08.920]  as well you see globalism isn't just taken over because it's a better system
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:14.160]  that would just take over by adoption free market it's taking over to end all
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:18.800]  competition it's taking over to end the family to end our culture as you know it
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.600]  go read the book things to come
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.320]  go see what the head of the Fabian socialists said that we're gonna do he
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:32.960]  wrote more nonfiction books than he wrote fiction I've probably read seven or
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.760]  eight nonfiction books by H.G. Wells and I'll be honest I can't read any more of
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:39.680]  them I used to read all their books and stuff and Carol quickly and I've already
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:45.040]  know their plan it's really scary to actually read them saying it and licking
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:51.640]  their lips and stuff folks these people really don't like you okay and you need
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.960]  to understand they're the same people that use the people of Ireland and
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:01.960]  Scotland and England who were strong to build their world tyranny they were
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:08.480]  colonialized by the Romanian and and Hapsburg who weren't even really German
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.960]  criminals that had learned how to control the final spice trade coming in out
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.760]  of the Middle East there in what's Transylvania today and then they
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.520]  perfected torture and political manipulation and really a lot of bad
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:23.600]  stuff not that Western Europe was perfect but they brought all that in they
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:31.840]  took over and God help us man and notice now the West gets the blame for
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.960]  what these people have used us to build for them and they're now moving into
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.320]  their endgame so here in terms of communist fascist socialists those are
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.080]  all the confusion they're different forms of command and control that the
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.160]  elites want because they can manage command and control because it's
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:50.240]  centralized read tragedy and hope we sell the book infowarstore.com back in
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.840]  print written by this guy that publishes so the State Department's own people
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.160]  could understand what they're doing what we fund communist and fascist and
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:03.040]  socialist and we want dictators we don't want freedom and it's a 1,100 page
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.880]  book explaining to them that none of this means anything that we're taking
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:11.280]  over and that we're the new British Empire and that we know best so just do
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:18.760]  it and you'll be taken care of they're so arrogant they published it people
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.680]  actually started reading it though so they took it out of print that's where
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:26.720]  this goes James Wesley Rawls and I are not up here giving you our opinion do
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.360]  you understand that the thousands of quotes the statements the admissions
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.520]  it's far worse than I can tell you Prince Philip Prince Charles constantly
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.880]  talking about how they want to kill everybody and bring in world government
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:45.600]  the force will be inoculate you you know cancer viruses they mean business they
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:52.520]  mean business and the fact that some whacked out Transylvanian royalty wants
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:57.480]  a world government to run your life and they're always you know what they're
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.280]  always digging up on the castle properties and the rest of it little
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:04.200]  kids I mean folks you cannot make up how evil these people are I'm gonna stop
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:09.280]  right there but again it's legends they're not physical vampires they're a
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.360]  bloodline of psychotics and they're not even run in the show they just kicked
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:19.400]  off and funded science you know there was major science in the 1850s folks they
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.800]  focused on the science of control and this has been copied it's been exported
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.280]  it's been refined there's all these new systems I'm ranting I'm gonna go back to
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:31.440]  our guest you just understand what we face the terms you want to know is the
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:38.360]  fact that globalism is really totally corrupt scientific colonialism by
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.880]  multinational megabanks and institutions that are above the law and of the new
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:48.260]  royalty with the powered attacks but are exempt from it letter of mark given to
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:54.280]  their operatives their mercenaries and they're reversing the Western invasion
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.800]  where they'd say you're gonna go to put on a ship we're gonna kill you and we
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:04.000]  think it was fun when you know like the 1600s more than half of crews died
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.200]  routinely usually about a third on an African or South American voyage you
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:14.920]  think they weren't slaves and the West then tried to end slavery but within the
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:22.480]  West was growing this great evil and so now you're facing scientific
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:29.200]  colonialism at a multinational above the state level playing the states off
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:33.360]  against each other the individuals against each other the great game times
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:41.920]  a thousand and nested in the heart of this nested in the core of this is then
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:46.880]  using the giant third world populations with promises of their own colonialism
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.040]  to come to the West and get the free welfare and the free goodies to be
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.440]  brought here to be programmed with liberation theology hate the West
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.440]  theology and then you conquer the third world and the West by playing them off
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.920]  against each other and that is their admitted plan you have been given the
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.080]  enemy's blueprint what are you going to do about it now mr. Rawls I'm gonna try
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.520]  to shut up give me the floor now but I want to set the table here getting back
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.440]  into the military waking up the bureaucrats waking up a lot of people
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.960]  understanding now as we near the end game that the Patriots were right the
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:21.080]  last 60 plus years from Barry Goldwater up to you and others warning people and
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:26.000]  so now how does that affect the battle space where does this go and and why is
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.560]  Islam as I think you correctly predicted over a decade ago the secret
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:34.200]  skeleton key weapon that they're going to use to finish their world government
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:43.160]  take over well Alex the the goal obviously is is control they want to
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:51.680]  consolidate power they want to institute a global system and all the pieces are
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:58.160]  in place right now to make that happen with the internet with the possibility
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:05.200]  of going cashless or the world currencies and soon to be a just a single currency
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:13.120]  I think that's that's definitely their goal they have this game plan and they
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.000]  are indeed just as you said playing one group off of another to to make all this
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.520]  happen and as I mentioned at the beginning of the last hour the the real
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.960]  tool that's being used right now following the end of the Cold War is
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:38.880]  using radical Islam as a pawn and as I mentioned before I think that that pawn
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:44.480]  may maybe actually be a knight or a queen in in hiding it's it's going to turn
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:52.840]  against them and with dramatic results when all is said and done we are seeing
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:16:02.000]  this all play out and the the pace at which change is taking place is getting
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.920]  faster and faster and faster and they're they're trying to manipulate this whole
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:12.400]  game that keeping people in the dark they're failing at that and at this
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:16.680]  point it's going to come down to crisis whether it's a global pandemic
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:20.960]  whether it's a global economic collapse or whether it's a global war they're
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:27.120]  going to have to play the crisis card very soon because they basically lost
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:33.600]  control economically and they have lost they don't realize it yet but they have
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:42.320]  lost the information war people like you have woken up too many people and at
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:52.200]  this point the only arrow left in their quiver is absolute crisis that's right
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:58.640]  and we're now going into it Hillary admitted they're losing the information
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:03.880]  war four years ago to Congress but I don't think she even realizes how much
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:08.880]  they've lost the information war is there any way to get these cornered
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.240]  rats to not destroy everything just keep power couldn't the states get
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:18.680]  together in a first-run constitutional convention just to have letters of
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:23.520]  demand and basically tell the top operatives stop their anti-American
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:27.400]  activities don't shut down power plants don't let China have unfair trade
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:36.000]  deals start there and then give them a year to exit the United States I mean
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.040]  that that of course you as you know is a student of history mr. Rawls has been
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.440]  done before with corrupt elites who are like a cancer and are too hard to
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:48.320]  dislodge I mean could some type of through the system armistice happened
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:53.640]  and just have these people flake off that is possible and I think one venue
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:59.920]  for that may be the upcoming Republican National Convention because they don't
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:07.720]  control all of those individual delegates and once a party convention
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:12.480]  is in a lot of ways like a constitutional convention once the floor is
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:22.000]  open if enough people call for discussion of a particular topic it can't be
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.280]  stopped and I think that if the upcoming Republican National Convention a lot
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.880]  of these fundamental issues may be raised and we may see another Barry
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:39.400]  Goldwater moment for our nation coming up and it could very well happen there
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:44.440]  that's right because when they engage in this open theft it is going to be a huge
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.240]  wake-up call on top of the wake-up call that's already happening and people are
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:52.840]  really going to see through it do you think it's arrogance overall or fear that
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:56.000]  they're just nakedly going yeah your vote doesn't count get used to it all
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:03.480]  over TV well that the level of arrogance is just horrendous to think that they
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:14.280]  can attempt to stage manage a an entire political convention by manipulating the
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:18.800]  rules of that convention I think it may backfire on them I think they're you
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:23.800]  know well a lot of two things are going to happen either there's going to be
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:30.120]  absolute pandemonium on the floor or there's going to be a walkout of a lot
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:36.440]  of delegates they may just walk to a hotel across the street and start their
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:40.360]  own convention that's the idea I'm gonna call Roger Stone right now because
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.640]  obviously his former business partner now is pretty much the head of the
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:48.040]  campaign they still got Lew and Dowsky over there on the side but wow that is a
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:51.640]  great idea and I kind of think that's what maybe actually planned but it's
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:56.800]  funny you brought that up well again things are spinning out of control and
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:02.260]  at this point again I think it's going to come down to a massive crisis of some
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:08.240]  sort as kind of a last-ditch effort for them to maintain their control and if
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:12.520]  things get more out of control sure sure things get more out of control it's
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.960]  going to get more out of control and more out of control let's say on a scale of
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:19.000]  one to a hundred a hundred being the most out of control you know full on nuclear
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.560]  war happening and his total insanity and you know zero being a volholic
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:29.720]  pastoral utopias where are we on that skill sir well I'd say we're somewhere
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:37.720]  in the 80s or the 90s here right now yeah the they're losing control and at
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:47.520]  this point unless they have a crisis that they can use as the excuse to collapse
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:55.440]  the stock market cause a banking crisis and institute a global currency they'll
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:01.080]  they'll need something of that scale to continue to consolidate power because
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:05.800]  otherwise power is going to slip through their grasp so you keep hammering
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:09.280]  and they're going to pull a crisis they're going to false flag or they're
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.280]  going to wind somebody up and they're going to create a crisis to be the
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:17.080]  saviors it's so huge it diverts from stealing elections and everything else
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:29.200]  yeah they'll probably have a a preplanned event of on a grand scale it
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:36.040]  won't just be something like Sandy Hook okay it's going to be more like a and a
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:43.320]  major assassination say for example of a of a of a key political figure or a key
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:48.920]  candidate that they'll then try to pin on the patriot movement for example that's
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:52.080]  right so a they could false flag and kill Donald Trump and blame it on the
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:55.480]  patriots or they could do it to Obama that's what my guts been telling me is
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:59.520]  wondering the season of a political assassination to be pinned on one group
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:03.320]  or the other it won't matter if it ever gets proven it'll just cause war on the
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:08.960]  streets yes and and there literally will be blood in the streets if that happens
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:14.520]  and again good getting back to the to the political conventions that the party
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:19.520]  convention's coming out of the Democratic convention or more likely out of
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.440]  the Republican convention we could see a huge uproar especially if they attempt
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:33.040]  to to broker this convention and put an insider in in place of one of the two
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:39.640]  perceived outsiders and that's the only way I mean look I'll be honest I don't
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:44.760]  want to scare people they could do stuff like a load and yield nuke in Cleveland
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:48.640]  and then you know to have Obama declare a civil emergency saying to you know a
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:53.720]  year now we're gonna have an election and then basically I mean all the
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.760]  preparations I see is if they're planning something humongous and I don't
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:01.680]  want to speculate here but I said before 9-11 look for the world trade
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:04.720]  centers and blame it on their asset bin Laden I'm not saying there's a radical
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:08.440]  Islam they're obviously Saudi Arabia 28 pages I was just saying I could see the
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:12.440]  preparation I could see them beta testing I could see them getting everybody
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:16.000]  ready and then I called it exactly as they did it and I'm telling you I've
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.040]  never seen such frightening rhetoric Obama's hyping nuclear terror everybody
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:26.280]  else is saying oh mushroom cloud over Manhattan in your gut and your sources
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:30.480]  what are some of the false flag triggers you think that the activating the
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:33.360]  ISIS al-Qaeda sleeper cells they have all over the U.S. what do you think it
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:40.920]  could be it could very well be ISIS here in the United States or another major
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:47.480]  event in in Europe but they I think they at this point see the need to step
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:53.800]  things up a notch so it won't just be guys pulling out AK-47s and hand grenades
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:59.880]  and shouting out of the Akbar it's going to be more like nuclear dirty bombs or
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:06.840]  even nuclear devices that reach critical mass actual nuclear weapons or
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:15.760]  biological warfare agents or massive use of chemical agents in a confined but
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:20.160]  heavily populated space and that by that I mean something like a subway or a
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:25.360]  stadium full of people where there wouldn't just be sure dozens of deaths
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:29.800]  or hundreds of deaths there could be thousands of simultaneous death deaths
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:37.360]  and that is the level they want to step things up to that level because it's
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:41.440]  only out of that level of crisis that they can call for something like martial
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:46.440]  law wow and they've already got quote several emergencies in Germany and
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:51.960]  France is spending people's rights it's amazing what do we do I mean I guess we
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:56.040]  call mainstream media we do our own shows everybody does videos everybody
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:00.000]  comes their own activists and says we don't want nuclear terror if there's
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.520]  nuclear Islamic terror we hold you responsible Mr. President you know we
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.680]  know you're cooking something you know hey ugly we know you're cooking you
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:14.280]  know don't cook it up for me to reverse what Hank Williams said I mean this is
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:20.960]  what do we do to stop it I really don't I really don't know an ideal solution
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:26.840]  other than to continue to wake people up and encourage people to not give up
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:31.640]  completely on the political process I hear so many people who say it's all
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:36.280]  over we can't do anything no matter who gets into office they're gonna pack the
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.600]  Supreme Court blah blah blah no I think there still is hope for the political
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:45.640]  process so people need to be aware they need to be politically active they
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:54.040]  need to be incredibly vocal and don't be buffaloed there's going to be a lot of
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:59.400]  of changes going on in our country in the next five years where they're going
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:04.640]  to use hate speech laws to try to silence people I agree on the end I want to
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:08.240]  talk about that next because the answer is everybody use your speech or lose it
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:11.440]  they're openly announcing it and I want to come back and go to calls right but
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.920]  separately James Wesley Rawls survival blog.com again joining us here if you
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:19.320]  just tuned in I'm Alex Jones of info wars.com syndicated radio slash TV
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:26.280]  transmission every day 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern looking at this and looking at
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:29.680]  the different things that they're pulling I also think it's important to
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:34.760]  reach out to some of the bots and some of the mainline liberals who come out to
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:38.320]  protest Trump and once they actually talk to the Trump supporters I see a lot
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.760]  of videos where people are actually coming together that's not getting a
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:44.000]  lot of coverage in the media but it's happening I mean when Lewis Farrakhan
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.800]  says we don't need to bring more Muslims in because they're gonna blow stuff up
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.800]  and then regular Muslims are gonna get blamed nobody covered that because it
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:57.440]  makes Trump look so common sense and so I really see them being afraid of doing
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:00.560]  this crisis everybody trying to reach out to each other I mean I think that's a
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:10.960]  big part of this. Yeah if their goal is to divide groups and the groups throw
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:15.840]  that back in their face by actually showing some cohesiveness and a unity
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:20.640]  of voice saying yes we want less government we want less control we want
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:25.000]  more individual freedom that's gonna really throw a monkey wrench into their
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:30.560]  into their plans. Sure. They want to continue to divide and conquer and if
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:37.480]  if we can actually find some common ground with people on the other end of
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:43.440]  the political spectrum it's gonna thwart their plans. Separately you bring up
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:48.120]  don't give them the political process it's become fake it's become a fraud but
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:52.640]  as we get involved we expose the voting machines as we run for
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.520]  office good people get elected it's a battle we're fighting crooks good men
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:01.520]  and women always trump them unintended when we finally take action it may take
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.560]  ten years may take thirty years may take six months you never know how it's
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:08.440]  gonna work we have the moral high ground and by going there and forcing them to
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:12.960]  steal the nomination that only accelerates the awakening people think
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.040]  oh it's correct give up you can't fix it no I've always said resistance is
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.560]  victory because in my own life but also studying history it's the animating
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:27.040]  contest of liberty that empowers our liberty muscles Mr. Rawls. I agree with
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:35.360]  you Alex they the the political process still has hope it's still at least a
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:40.080]  kernel of hope there for America and we cannot give up on the process but look
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:44.360]  at how fast people are waking up right now. Well people are indeed waking up
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:49.840]  and seeing what comes out of the Republican convention if it is if they
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:55.320]  do their broker deal and they have they they do their what it really comes down
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:29:03.480]  to is power-brokering and people see that I think they can't stop people from
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:06.760]  waking up to what's really going on and people who have called themselves
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:11.280]  Republicans for many many years are going to suddenly stop calling
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:14.400]  themselves Republicans if they see that the convention is right it's a
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.800]  Democratic Party plan they're the dominant party the Republicans since the
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:21.800]  Rockefeller days just just you'll play along they're preparing to finally go
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:27.240]  ahead and kill the party entirely and create one-party rule with a vestigial
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:30.360]  Republican Party in the South this is the true fall of America I want to get
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:33.200]  your take on that James Wesley Rawls survival blog.com I'll talk about the

[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:23.320]  tab at around 9 15 p.m. students began issuing warnings on social media that a
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:28.360]  man in white robes had been seen on campus other students uninterested in
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:32.120]  waiting for the claims to be verified immediately demanded the school find a
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:36.440]  way to make them feel safe after a flurry of emails in the likely
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:40.440]  construction of several safe spaces students were eventually informed that
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:44.520]  the alleged racist was actually a monk of the Dominican order in traditional

[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:41.320]  and what was really going on in the world and i didn't think anything
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.000]  big deal of it when i was a kid i talk about this people use it as a discrediting
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.120]  point act like it's a secret and play a clip from the show i'm saying it on my
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.600]  show that there were a lot of people that were army

[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:31.240]  world to not resist the globalist
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:35.720]  if i'm out on a sailboat in the middle of a great lake and all of a sudden a
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:41.480]  huge leak forms and the boat's going to sink and it's freezing water

[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:52.040]  i want to live that's why don't call up and say i'm a hero
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:57.640]  do not call up and say how great i am folks it's normal to fight this it's
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:00.760]  abnormal not to
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.400]  these people are really bad and humanity deserves not to go through this
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.520]  anymore you've seen all the tyrannies and most
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:11.400]  governments are horrible and oppressive and now you see the way we're going
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.920]  it's bad news i want to go back and get into a new novel take your phone calls
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:18.440]  i'm not going to belabor this but you need to understand that
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.320]  the reason i can be on the same page with somebody like Rawls
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:25.000]  or the same page as a colonel schaefer or the same page as the tosh plumlee
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.800]  whistleblower or a same page as the lieutenant marine
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.080]  corps colonel you know it was on last week or the same page everybody else
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:34.520]  or the same page as congressmen that come on the show like walter jones is
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:37.880]  because it's a real page
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:43.720]  like the sammy hagar song it's a fact not my point of view and you know it's
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:48.600]  true and so debates over
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:53.240]  we have a scientific tyranny coming in that's very easy to defeat
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:59.320]  because it's so big and stinking and open and has been so arrogant
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:03.080]  because all the other tyrannies came as tanks or weapons or troops
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.920]  so they thought oh we're corporate we're sophisticated the hillbillies won't look
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:09.880]  at what we're doing well the hillbillies wouldn't look when everything was still
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:13.160]  pretty nice now they're looking and they're finding out you did it
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:17.160]  you're not getting away with this you won't be safe anywhere with your money
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:21.320]  i don't have some big raging thing to prove to want a war with you
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:25.800]  i'm not an idiot i want to stop this now
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.440]  so i hope listeners and people understand
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:35.720]  this isn't a game and when i say tell your friends and family about the show
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:40.920]  info wars dot com info wars dot com four slash show when i tell you go to

[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:56.760]  just like ralph said they're coming after our free speech now is the time

[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:15.640]  because i'm afraid of letting these people win a lot more than i'm afraid
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:18.440]  what could happen to me

[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:03.320]  minutes because i just get really excited talking about all this stuff
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:06.840]  these things are so earnest now it's all happening now we've been proven right
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:10.280]  i know it's how does it feel for you writing for 30 years so now see it all
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:13.560]  proven right and to see that your work has become basically
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:16.760]  prescient i mean i know personally i'm not excited
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:19.880]  about the fact i've been proven right it's a very sick feeling but at least
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:23.160]  we've been proven right so more people pay attention now and then let's get
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:27.640]  into the caliphate sure well it is gratifying to see that
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:33.560]  um you know back in 1990 when i wrote the first draft of my first novel
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.600]  people were saying that it was absolutely inconceivable
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:42.840]  to see a stock market collapse and a collapse in the unit us dollar as a
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:47.240]  currency unit and now people aren't saying that anymore
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:51.560]  yeah they recognize that it really is a possibility
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:55.160]  and it is gratifying to see that people are waking up
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:59.080]  but beyond that it it's important that
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:05.560]  as people wake up they are politically active they don't hold back
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.440]  from sharing this knowledge with their friends
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:14.200]  and that they are fully committed to the fight ahead of them you know the old
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:17.240]  joke is that uh when when the farmer was
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:22.440]  putting together breakfast the chicken was involved but the pig
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:27.080]  was committed and uh we gotta be committed
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:30.280]  yeah that's that's the stage that we're at right now
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:34.040]  where um you we have to be fully committed to this
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:40.280]  because the the the battle is on it's it's right before us and what i'm
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:44.120]  trying to do with my new novel series the counter caliphate series
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:49.160]  is to wake people up to the big picture of what's going on
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.000]  geopolitically and to point out to them
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:59.960]  that we are not just victims of our circumstances okay
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:06.280]  we can actually make a change as individuals that we can individually
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.440]  push for the establishment of a christian nation of refuge
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:15.640]  for instance that's what i i put forth in the first novel in the series
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.400]  that kind of change can take place and we because we are
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:24.360]  a globally interconnected
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:31.800]  society where individuals can make an enormous difference
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.280]  the individual efforts of waking people up
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:41.640]  organizing and creating alternatives to the the current system
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:45.480]  can happen they will happen with god's help
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:50.120]  these kind of changes will take place and uh just like
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:54.360]  cockroaches scurrying away from the light you turn enough lights on
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:57.640]  like you're doing with all your educational
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:04.520]  quests the the the roaches are going to go scurrying for cover
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:10.760]  and people will realize that they individually can make a difference
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:15.400]  and they can truly change things that's the encouraging thing and that's
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:19.880]  why as a christian and as a patriot i hold out a lot of hope
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:24.200]  because i think in the long run we are bound to win
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:31.000]  as your promo says that you know the we are on the march
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.400]  we we we will prevail in the long run and that's very encouraging
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:42.920]  so i do encourage people to um get active and to share this knowledge as
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:48.120]  much as they can with others no one knows who said it last time i
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:51.080]  checked it's it's it's author unknown of the
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:54.920]  statement there are no atheists and foxholes but it is true that armies
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:58.600]  throughout history um know about providence they know
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:02.760]  about trying to purify themselves they know about trying to seek god
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:07.240]  and that's because they've learned even even the most arrogant atheists that
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:10.360]  you know you laugh at god uh it's very unlucky
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:15.160]  but you talk about george washington and others providence is a real thing
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:20.520]  and i've experienced it my life and i just feel sorry for people that really
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:24.760]  think this that this world's a joke and who don't think there aren't good
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:28.520]  and evil forces active in the world those people are so spiritually blind
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:32.760]  they have no idea what's coming or what they're about to face
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:36.920]  well that's uh that's our real hope really is in christ
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:44.840]  and as we look at this this whole global political mess uh that's developed
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:49.000]  we can have hope in the certain knowledge
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:54.200]  of our salvation and we can be absolutely fearless with that knowledge
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:59.480]  in the fight ahead knowing that we know our destination if we're going to heaven
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.880]  they can't take that away from us so we can be fearless in this fight
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:07.080]  other tidbits other tidbits before we go to calls that you'd like to relate to
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:09.720]  the listeners today
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:19.240]  yeah his his skype was breaking up and we just lost his audio it should come
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:24.040]  back in a moment it is the skype completely disconnect
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:28.600]  okay james can you hear us yeah i have you okay i'll
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:33.000]  any other little tidbits you want to add before we go to some calls
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:39.160]  well i just want to encourage people to
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:43.000]  wake up individually wake up their friends it's time to
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:50.440]  stock up team up and train up because we're far beyond just politics with this
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.520]  now and the the problems that have been created
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:59.160]  are going to affect us on a physical level i mean in terms of individual
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:03.560]  sustenance into in terms of individual
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:08.520]  you know just personal security of staying alive
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:11.560]  so you need to you need to have food storage
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:15.480]  you need to have training you need to have
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.680]  alternative currency whether it's precious metals or
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:23.560]  ammunition for barter it's it's actually come to that time
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:27.880]  where if you don't stock up if you don't team up with your friends
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:31.480]  who are like-minded and if you don't train up
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:35.000]  because those supplies just by themselves are kind of useless unless you
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.520]  know exactly what you're doing with them there's a learning curve with all of
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:42.200]  these things it's time truly folks to stock
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:46.360]  up team up and train up to be ready for the dark days ahead
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:49.240]  and it only runs from bad to worse we're not trying to be negative here folks
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:52.200]  they plan to collapse western civilization to bring in social
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:55.240]  engineering they're going to make you very poor and desperate to do that
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:58.680]  they do it in every communist takeover this is not a communist program
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:01.960]  but the globalists are using communist reeducation tools
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:05.880]  and even communist terminology now in army manuals that are declassified so
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:09.080]  this is very very dangerous they use what's worked before
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:12.040]  and they've been preparing the ground here for a while tim and wyoming has a
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:16.280]  question for our guest mr ralls go ahead tim
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:21.960]  yes yes hello thanks for taking my call my question for you mr ralls is i'll
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:26.280]  ask this question of listeners yesterday and i never got a chance to call in
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:31.640]  and say what my line of the sand was what is your line in the sand for when
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:35.480]  when we should uh i'd be basically stand up and be counted
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:39.880]  so to speak because i mean i'm already doing as much as i can possibly do
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:43.320]  in my small town and why a lot of that's targeting i mean the people around
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:46.360]  your just minions of the systems are going after them doesn't do anything
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.320]  that's why i'm defensive at least i have somebody's attacking me i know they're
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.920]  in the wrong but a lot of this is just exposing the operative so that if
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:56.040]  everything does go to a shooting war people know who the foreign enemy is
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:59.720]  but mr ralls your comments
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:06.040]  right well i think everybody has to draw their own individual line
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:11.640]  as it were because for someone who is a single person for example without a
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:15.320]  family without children to worry about that line in the
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:19.560]  sand might be a lot farther out than someone who has a large family to worry
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:23.800]  about that they're going to um you know lock
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:27.400]  in load at a much later date than someone who
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:32.520]  doesn't have that level of uh responsibility for a family
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:36.200]  that's right my line in the sand is protect my family protect my community
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:39.800]  uh not be offensive i'm offensive with information
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:43.400]  and then try to be defensive like a mother hen but then at what point then
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:47.320]  do you go uh aggressive and boy once the people that are in a
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:50.040]  mother hen position go aggressive that's when heads really roll
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:55.160]  historically correct yes and again people have to be
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:59.720]  wise as serpents and meek as dubs as the bible teaches
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:03.640]  right now if you look at what happened uh with the bundy ranch
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:10.920]  and with the malheur wildlife refuge uh people who stood up too early
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:14.920]  too vocally and who made some tactical mistakes in terms of committing
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:19.000]  felonies on federal property are now
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  feeling the wrath of the federal government with multiple multiple
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:30.520]  felonies they walk into a trap yes big time and unfortunately they all
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:34.760]  did it on camera gave their names and were seen on camera with
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:38.120]  weapons and the and the site of those of those weapons alone
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:43.400]  was used for as felony charges of uh use of firearms to the commission of a
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:45.640]  felon they thought just because they were quote
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:49.400]  in the right on a few issues they didn't know about the optics it was very very
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:54.200]  foolish right and so people have to be wise about
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.400]  that sort of thing you have to be you have to pick your fights
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:01.240]  you have to choose your battles wisely don't tilt it win mills that's one
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:04.360]  reason i've never gotten involved in even though
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:08.360]  the tax system in the united states is inherently wrong
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:12.200]  i chose not to fight the tax battle because i saw what happened to too many
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:15.560]  tax process exactly we're fighting the general globalist
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:19.320]  occupied takeover that it's a worldwide takeover it's illegitimate
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:22.920]  we're occupied we're not fighting each tentacle we're exposing to everyone
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:28.680]  that this is an illegitimate takeover that's now more naked than ever
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:34.040]  right so again choose your choose your battles wisely
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:40.440]  and when you go to a public protest you need to think very seriously about
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:44.040]  how far away you park your car for example so your license plate number
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:47.880]  won't be uh photographed and whether or not you're
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.960]  going to disguise yourself but don't be
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:55.720]  buffaloed into not attending at all well i'd say either choose to be totally
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:58.520]  public or be underground that's that's the model i think people
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:00.760]  see they're being completely underground or totally out in the open

[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:22.120]  let's just go ahead and go back to calls speaking of the caliphate more
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:25.560]  in texas you're on the air with james wasley rawls
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:29.800]  hi y'all join today my question and i don't want to be long-winded but my
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:34.120]  question is the original founder of this one was black people
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:39.400]  and it wasn't arab but my question is that the europeans actually helped with
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:43.800]  the arab in charge if it kind of like i don't want to
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:48.360]  be objective but if it payback for them outlying with arrows instead of black
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:52.040]  people as they should have allied with that's my question
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:56.440]  all right well let me try to throw i mean i get what you're saying that it is
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:56:00.280]  true that the british empire and others kind of set up islam put the
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:03.080]  little hobbyist in control the worst sect obviously
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:06.920]  who did say that black people weren't humans and in their you know not the
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:10.920]  korean they wrote that afterwards and kill all the blacks they find in areas of
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:14.040]  africa that's why i don't get so many blacks you know joining that form of
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:16.360]  islam but mr. Rawls you study this what's your
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:19.240]  take on what he said
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:23.800]  well to begin with i think the whole concept of race
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:27.880]  is spurious i think there's only one race and that's the human race
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:33.960]  yes and for many many years kings and princes and
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:37.640]  parliaments have been trying to divide people
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:41.320]  by putting labels on the so-called races
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:47.080]  and to to drive a wedge between people to create conflict which they can then
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:53.880]  manage to their to meet their goals so i reject the whole concept of racism to
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:57.240]  begin with at races and that's right it's vulcanization thank you more but it's
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:59.480]  an interesting question well i mean here's mexico
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:03.240]  six months to a year hard labor they torture you they shock you they beat
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:05.320]  you that's in the guardian i said just last week
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:09.160]  they beat you up they tear i mean mexico has some of the most draconian
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:13.000]  rules and but they can't have huge third world populations coming in they'll
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.960]  collapse even worse i'm not saying what they're doing is good
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:18.680]  how are we supposed to take all these people though and give them everything
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:21.320]  free i'm not against these poor latin americans
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:25.400]  but the globalists are bringing them in turning them into a tribal racial based
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:29.880]  group even if that's a fraud to then ally with the socialist and vote our guns
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:33.560]  away what do we do then mr. Rawls
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:39.880]  well we need to reject racism we need to point out when it's being used as a
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:44.280]  psychological weapon and we can't we can't fall for the
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:48.200]  race baiting it's important that we recognize
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:53.400]  that as american citizens we represent
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:57.480]  the end result of what our founding fathers had in mind
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:02.200]  and it it actually worked remarkably well for many many generations
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:06.680]  and yeah granted we're we're in in dire straits right now
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:12.680]  and we've run up a huge national debt but they cannot extinguish the spirit of
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:16.360]  individual liberty that still exists in this i totally agree and that's but we
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:19.320]  can't have totally open borders and just bring people in and sign them up with
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:23.240]  a socialist no that week we have to we have to
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:29.560]  be very uh protective of our borders but for
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:32.760]  people who are american citizens we have to fully
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:36.920]  uh bring them up in the culture absolutely to bring them

[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:28.520]  network welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight and in this
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:32.040]  hour we're going to be talking to the former lawyer of
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:37.000]  debora gene palfrey she was the also known as the dc madame that's probably
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.960]  how you know her the person that we were told
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:44.280]  committed suicide and of course before the dc madame had committed suicide by
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:48.120]  hanging herself there was also another
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:51.480]  prostitute who had been involved in these same
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:56.120]  high-profile clients who had committed suicide we're told the same way
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:01:00.680]  by hanging herself now we have the interviews and we've played these many
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:04.200]  times we'll play them also in this hour where alex jones was i believe the last
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:07.880]  person to talk to the dc madame and he clarified with her
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:12.600]  that she was not at all suicidal she was very adamant that she was not suicidal
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:16.760]  he looked at the handwriting did not the suicide note did not look like her
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:20.040]  handwriting and of course 90 percent of the women who commit
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:23.640]  suicide do it with pills it's very rare for women
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:27.880]  to commit suicide by hanging themselves of course two of them committed suicide
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:31.240]  back to back that way in that same particular case now why is this coming
[02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:35.400]  up well this is coming up because her former lawyer
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:38.920]  Montgomery Blair Sibley who's going to be joining us in the next
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:42.760]  segment has said that he has information that he believes
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:47.000]  is significant to the current presidential election that time is of the
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.320]  essence he went before the supreme court he requested that this information be
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:54.760]  released we're going to talk to him about the updates on that
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:57.960]  also we're going to have in the fourth hour Paul Joseph Watson is going to be
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:02.920]  joining us we have a story that's up on info wars dot com chaos as social
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:06.360]  justice warrior students crash students for trump meeting now what's
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:10.200]  interesting about this is that this was a relatively small
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:13.960]  number of students for trump at a very very liberal
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:17.800]  university portland state university and i tell you i've been portland we went
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:22.040]  to uh went there for vacation beautiful beautiful place we're walking down
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:25.560]  this former elementary school that is now a very nice hotel
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:28.760]  restaurant area just to look at the architecture and as we're walking down
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:33.080]  the halls i hear this meeting with all of the
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:37.080]  talking points of the politically correct left about white privilege and
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:39.880]  everything i just couldn't believe it it was just scripted
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:44.120]  and i stopped and just went into the room for what i just watched it is
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:47.960]  absolutely unbelieving but that that is the way portland is now they had a
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:52.920]  group of a hundred students show up at this portland state university to
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:57.160]  intimidate the students for trump you can see the b-roll footage there
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:00.360]  it was a massive number of people and of course they call the police the police
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:04.520]  would never come and why are you not hearing about this
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:10.600]  from the media why is it not a story when anti-trump socialists continue to
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:13.320]  crash political meetings because they don't like
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:17.880]  your point of view to intimidate and to shut down your free speech
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:21.400]  this is the pattern this is the pattern of confrontation
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:25.800]  censorship intimidation threats of violence getting in their face that's
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:29.160]  what we're seeing here with us we can't play it because there is so much
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:32.600]  language on there we can't run this on the radio but that's what we see over
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.080]  and over again and of course it doesn't happen
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:38.680]  on the right you don't see people crashing in and trying to shut down
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:42.360]  bernie sanders rallies except for the black lives matter people he allowed
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:46.280]  them to do that presumably i guess he he agrees with
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:49.720]  them but you don't see trump people going and trying to shut down hillary
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:52.120]  clinton's rallies there's a guy right in his face
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:55.480]  uh trying to get violent with him you don't see that happening on the other
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:59.720]  side of course you do see on the right hand side you do see the social
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:02.760]  justice warriors like megyn kelly and michelle fields
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:06.120]  who are cannot figure out whether they want to be victims
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:10.200]  or power women and they're kind of uh vacillating back and forth between
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:14.040]  those two they do want to shut people down and of course it was not covered
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:17.160]  that much this last weekend megyn kelly told charlie
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:20.760]  rose that she thought that cnn shouldn't have covered
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:24.360]  interviews with donald trump when he did not go to
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:27.400]  her debates they should have censored him they should have banned him from
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:30.200]  television because that's the way you handle it and she said we should do
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:34.760]  this to support the first amendment no the first amendment is about a free
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:39.240]  marketplace of ideas and it's about competition in that marketplace if it's
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:42.920]  about anything there's very little of that in the mainstream media but what
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:47.240]  little of it does exist these social justice warriors
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:50.520]  like megyn kelly want to shut it down stay with us we're going to be right
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:55.960]  back with the dc madams lawyer what is in these records whose name is in these
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:05:01.000]  records find out when we come back
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:04.760]  belgian authorities are still on the lookout for the infamous man in the hat
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:08.120]  seen walking alongside the brussels airport suicide bombers
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:12.280]  according to a report in frances lamal newspaper the man in the hat could be
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:16.280]  naeem al-hamad who was born in syria in 88 and arrived in europe
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:19.720]  amongst the wave of refugees who entered via greece last year
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:23.720]  al-hamad arrived with sofian ayari another suspected brussels terraplotter
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:27.320]  who was captured in a police raid along with paris massacre suspect
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:30.600]  salah abdaslam and if al-hamad is not the man in a hat
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:34.840]  he's still suspected to be an accomplice of a suicide bomber who blew himself up
[02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:39.240]  on the train at malbec metro station back in december isis bragged in its own

[02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:53.800]  exploiting the migrant crisis to enter europe better put the pressure on
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:57.080]  governments to scale back these open border policies that have left the

[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:39.000]  she was a uh at the dc madam who had a lot of
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.200]  information and phone numbers on powerful people in washington
[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:47.800]  politicians staff members many others who could lose their careers
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:51.320]  and we had a senator of bitter who who did lose
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:55.080]  his career once his name was discovered in the lists
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:58.600]  now it's been some time we want to talk to the lawyer because this is
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:02.840]  resurfaced after the stories from the national inquire
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:07.560]  talking about how ted cruise had had accusing him alleging that he had had
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:11.320]  affairs with multiple women there were also prior to the national
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:15.080]  inquire story going back several weeks i think to the beginning
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:19.320]  of march was when the marco rubio camp was
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:24.040]  putting a story around about ted cruise and former liaisons there was also
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:27.240]  a release from anonymous saying that they had information
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:31.400]  about ted cruise and situations that he had been involved in
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:35.640]  then calling on him to quit the campaign or they would release this
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:40.840]  information now we have the lawyer the former lawyer of the dc madam
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:43.720]  and he says he has a lot of records that he believes
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:47.160]  are relevant to the current election campaign he believes that time is of the
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:51.080]  essence that the population the voting population needs to see this
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:54.760]  information and our information from him says
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:57.960]  that he is in sole possession of over 2,500 emails
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:02.440]  from and to gene palfrey and the only one with full knowledge of what
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:05.320]  transpired during those last 20 months of her life
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:09.400]  he was compelled by her express direction to him to tell her story
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:14.120]  in the event of her death now he's been practicing law for over 25 years most
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:17.560]  recently he's engaged the u.s supreme court in a series of lawsuits
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:20.600]  challenging that court's assertion of discretionary jurisdiction
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:24.520]  and personal immunity from suits alleging violation of federal statutes
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:28.280]  in the disposition of cases before them this is

[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:40.040]  david what a pleasure and indeed an honor to be on your show today
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:43.560]  i really appreciate the opportunity well i appreciate you
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:47.320]  putting this information out there and and we want to get an idea of
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:52.120]  exactly what you have you've been under a gag order for some time this is all
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:56.040]  nine ten years old that this is uh this information has been around tell us
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:01.080]  about the gag order tell us what you can about the information that you have
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:06.680]  well i'll start with the gag order uh that was entered back in may of 2007
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:09.960]  it was to prevent me from releasing any telephone numbers
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:14.120]  of the dc madame uh it was partially released
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:17.640]  modified to let me release telephone numbers alone
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:22.360]  which we did and that's how to the crowdsource we identified
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:26.280]  various people of prominence dan molde particularly identified senator vitter
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:29.400]  is one of the more prominent people on the list
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:32.920]  subsequent orders were entered in the case oral orders which were never
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:37.000]  reduced to writing never appear on the docket were entered in the case
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.720]  and the summon substance of it all is i understand and believe i'm operating our
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:46.520]  order not to release the names of the escorts or the clients of the escort
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:51.000]  service as of this day okay now you appeal to the
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:55.560]  us of supreme court to release this gag order tell us what happened with that
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:59.800]  well let me back up if i could david just a bit more it was in january that
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:02.760]  uh for other reasons i was looking at these records and
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:07.080]  believe they became irrelevant to the presidential election cycle we're in
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:10.600]  so i first went to the court that issued the orders gagging me if you will
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:15.400]  restraining me and they refused to let me file a request
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:21.400]  to modify the orders uh as a result i went to the appellate court in dc
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:26.600]  and challenged that refusal of the right to even file the request to modify the
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:30.120]  restraining orders after two weeks i waiting and hearing
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:33.240]  no response and i'll just note it's now been
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:36.440]  30 days and i still have had no response from the circuit
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:40.360]  court of appeal i then went to chief justice roberts
[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:43.800]  of the u.s supreme court requesting his intervention
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:48.040]  in this matter and of course uh many of us are concerned
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:52.600]  about justice roberts himself having written both the
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:57.240]  concurring and dissenting opinions on obama care highly unusual many of us at
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:01.720]  the time believe that he perhaps had been blackmailed for whatever
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:06.600]  reason we have no idea but it was very very unusual and of course
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:12.200]  the idea that the federal government can force people to buy something in the
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:15.880]  marketplace is something that none of us could find in the constitution
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:20.360]  and clearly uh justice roberts couldn't find it either so he wrote both the
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:24.520]  dissenting and the concurring opinion highly irregular and now we have learned
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:30.520]  that uh both he and uh ginsburg have been the subject of
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:33.240]  uh phone taps and that sort of thing from the government so that is something
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:35.800]  that we all need to worry about and it is an issue when we're looking at
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:39.000]  political candidates because they can be blackmail because you have
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.640]  situations as the national inquire has done in the
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:45.480]  past exposing uh moral situations with gary
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:49.240]  hart with john edwards that ended their careers because these people can be
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:54.280]  blackmailed but it also breaks faith with their image with the public
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:58.840]  uh tell us what's in these uh in these phone records that we've not previously
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:01.560]  seen the ones that you're trying to get released
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:05.320]  well here's the challenge technologically david you have a cell
[02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:09.880]  phone telephone number and that number belongs to you and you know it and
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:13.400]  anyone you give it to knows it and of course the phone company let's say it's
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:18.040]  AT&T knows it knows your name your address but nobody else can find that
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:23.400]  number because there is no white pages for cell phone telephone numbers so
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:27.400]  while we were able to identify some of the numbers in the records a large
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:30.280]  number of the numbers we couldn't identify so
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:34.360]  i issued secret subpoenas that is unknown to the government
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:37.880]  to the major telephone companies asking them
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:41.560]  uh whose telephone numbers these are and i gave them a list of
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:47.000]  of about 6 000 telephone numbers uh those uh subpoenas went to verizon
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:53.880]  wireless alt l at&t t mobile uh and some others and as a result from
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:15:00.840]  verizon wireless god bless them they responded and gave me a list of 815
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:05.000]  individuals and companies that had numbers in the
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:10.120]  telephone records of the escort service okay so you're able to reverse those
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:13.000]  out and reverse yes it's reverse
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.360]  engineering of the identities of the escorts and the customers of the escort
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:19.240]  service have those names been released are there
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:22.920]  presidential candidates within those 815 that is that what you're trying to
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:25.880]  get released with these uh these appeals to the court
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:30.040]  well david let me be very clear in answering that compound question so
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:34.280]  there's no confusion those names have not been released
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:38.360]  because i believe they are under the court orders preventing me and everyone
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:42.440]  else who may think they have them or not have them from releasing those orders
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:46.120]  if you do so you're in violation of court order which is contempt which is
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:50.120]  punishable by incarceration and they're originally
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:54.040]  arguably was a good reason for those orders my position now
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:58.600]  is that those reasons have dissipated and alternatively
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:02.680]  my first amendment right to give comment now trumps whatever original reasons
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:06.600]  existed for issuing those orders and therefore i properly have asked to
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:10.280]  be heard on my motion to dissolve those restraining orders
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:13.480]  the government will not let me file that request and that's what all the
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:18.120]  litigation is about i see so out of the 6000 or so that
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:21.720]  you've got you're able to get from vryzen
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:25.160]  about 800 of those that you were able to identify but you cannot release the
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:29.480]  identify the identification of those numbers without the court
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:33.160]  lifting this restraining order is that correct right so i identified about
[02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:37.000]  13 percent of the actors involved in the dc madams
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:41.720]  escort service over a 13-year period that means if my math is any good
[02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:45.720]  i did not identify 87 percent of those actors
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:49.480]  now if in the ones that we identified there were a fair amount of public
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:52.680]  opinion public actors if you will government or
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:56.280]  closet government officials we only got 13 percent
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:59.960]  well obviously the 87 percent is statistically likely to
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:04.200]  contain about five times more trust people that i think we have the right
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:07.800]  to know about now when we look at the information you
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:11.960]  you got started on this trying to release this information way back in
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:17.480]  january and of course it was in march way before this story came out the
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:20.120]  national inquire that we saw the action from the rubio
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:24.840]  account as well as from anonymous it was reported that anonymous was
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:28.120]  threatening ted cruz saying that they had information that
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:32.600]  they believed linked linked him with the dc madam now of course you can't
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:35.400]  comment on that specifically as to whether or not you have any
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:40.520]  any information on that but do they have information that
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:44.760]  how much of this is out in the open in terms of are all the five thousand or
[02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:48.360]  so names out there in the open or are there some additional names
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:52.840]  as i read in the in the introduction you said there was about 2,500
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:56.760]  names that you had sole possession of so i would assume those are not on the
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:18:00.360]  internet is that correct that is correct they were never
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:04.280]  released and the telephone numbers i gave on to the
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:07.800]  telephone companies pursuant to these secret subpoenas were never released
[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:11.560]  publicly what everyone's claiming they have is the stuff that we did send out
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:16.040]  i sent out 50 cd containing i don't know 10 000 phone numbers or so
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:19.000]  and those are still floating around they've pretty much been identified or
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.360]  were unable to be identified in the course of things
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:25.720]  no what i'm talking about now is stuff that no one's ever seen before
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:29.000]  let me ask you about deborjean palfi the dc madam
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:33.560]  and her supposed suicide do you believe it was a suicide or do you believe that
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:37.000]  there was foul play involved your personal opinion gave it
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:41.160]  my personal opinion is i wake up and struggle with that answer on a regular
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:44.760]  basis so many things about i know about that woman
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:48.840]  my communications with her the days before she was found dead
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:53.000]  just make it improbable if not impossible that she committed suicide
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.600]  on the other hand suicide is always an enigma to those who've suffered through
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:18:59.240]  it so one really can never know what is
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:02.120]  actually going on in somebody's mind it just seems
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:05.800]  we were talking about a very aggressive appeal we had great issues i think we
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:09.240]  would have been very successful on appeal i just didn't see her giving up
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:12.680]  the fight the way she did so to answer your question
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:15.960]  i don't know let me ask you you're not contemplating
[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:20.040]  suicide right oh let's go on the record about that
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:24.040]  yeah let's do that there's too much joy ahead of me in my life and this is only
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:26.600]  part of my life please uh that i wouldn't even
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:30.840]  that isn't even a passing fancy of mine well you know i ask that question
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:34.600]  because we do want to get that on record we did talk to Gary Webb before he
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:38.200]  allegedly committed suicide shooting himself twice in the head he's and he
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:42.200]  was very combative he was uh moving forward exposing
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:45.880]  new stories and of course alex was the last one to interview
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:49.240]  the dc madam and she was very adamant that she was not going to commit
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:52.120]  suicide stay with us we're going to be right back we've got some more questions
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:56.760]  for the lawyer of the dc madam and the information that he has stay with us we'll
[02:19:56.760 --> 02:20:02.680]  be right back first of all my number one
[02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:06.680]  priority like yours alex is the customer's health
[02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:09.880]  and that's the first thing that we look at i want to provide the highest
[02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:13.880]  quality best ingredients stuff that i know
[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:17.320]  is going to be effective stuff that i know individuals are going to get
[02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:20.680]  results with and stuff that's going to change literally change
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:24.680]  their health for the for the betterment of their life and so they don't have to
[02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:28.920]  deal with anything and it starts at the cell if you add up all the ingredients
[02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:32.360]  that we have in dna for us and you were to buy those separately
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:35.960]  you would be spending two probably three hundred dollars because we use the
[02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:39.400]  highest quality best ingredients i mean literally you're creating
[02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:42.920]  miracles because what you're doing is you're repairing the cells
[02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:47.640]  and a lot of the supplements out there aren't focused on
[02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:51.800]  getting into the cellular mitochondrial
[02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:55.880]  regrowth and when the mitochondria dies and the cell dies
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:21:00.520]  or when new cells come about from that they're even unhealthier than the cells
[02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:03.720]  before the cell is ready to die an emergency divides
[02:21:03.720 --> 02:21:07.480]  you only get so many divisions in the telomeres that's when your body shuts
[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:09.960]  down that's why they people old people look old
[02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:13.720]  because their cells are dead and dying what we have is we have the biop qq
[02:21:13.720 --> 02:21:17.560]  which is found as the original life form multi
[02:21:17.560 --> 02:21:20.520]  antioxidant mineral that's found in space dust
[02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:24.680]  and we have the pitero purin there too that's it that's it which contains
[02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:28.120]  different components health giving components and antioxidants
[02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:31.800]  that are contained in blueberries the equivalent of 500
[02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:35.880]  cartons of blueberries that you would have to eat so really this is an
[02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:41.080]  antioxidant it's an anti-aging uh system it's a cellular repair
[02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:45.320]  mitochondrial repair and since everything starts at the cellular level
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:49.080]  you're getting all these nutrients into the base of that and
[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:53.880]  what we've done with this new batch of dna force i'm always looking for new and
[02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:58.120]  exciting things that we can add to these formulas to bring the quality up
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:02.280]  that's why constantly we're looking at improving the quality and adding
[02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:05.320]  new things that's why it's now dna force plus though we haven't changed the
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:08.280]  label yet so this new dna force batch has the
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:13.000]  addition of an omry listed organic fulvic acid
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:17.320]  and it's just like the shellage that we use as well the fulvic acid is the base
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:22.360]  core component of all cellular life it's made from the decomposition of
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:25.800]  plants and and that decomposes into a humus structure
[02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:30.440]  and fulvic acid is one of the components of that fulvic acid contains 77
[02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:35.000]  different base ionic minerals and it's on the label on the back we
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:38.280]  have to change the main label on the front to call it dna force plus
[02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:42.440]  we have a limited run and and again it it does have so many things in it
[02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:45.880]  that are hard to source hard to get that's why we're sold out half the time of
[02:22:45.880 --> 02:22:49.560]  dna force uh it's just because the formula is that good folks that's not a
[02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:52.760]  gimmick or we're sold out all the time of some of these key things it's the
[02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:56.280]  more complex the product is the harder it is to get the truly
[02:22:56.280 --> 02:22:59.720]  pure clean organic the harder it is to pass all the standards
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:03.880]  and when we don't we just don't put it out i mean nobody else does that that's
[02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:08.360]  that is true quality control right there that is true i would love to have
[02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:12.600]  sources but our rigorous process of vetting sources for these products and
[02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:16.440]  getting these materials in and it's only getting worse across the industry
[02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:21.160]  because everybody is trying to jump into the nutraceutical and ride the
[02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:24.440]  organic bandwagon right now you have pharmaceutical companies
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:28.600]  that are in bet investing hundreds of billions of dollars right now into the
[02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:31.880]  probiotic and we now have big pharma contacting us saying hey we want to work
[02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:36.440]  with you with our laboratories i mean it's just crazy listen it goes back to
[02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:40.360]  nature nature is our medicine everything
[02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:44.840]  nature is the next thing nature is the high tech
[02:23:44.840 --> 02:23:48.840]  nature trumps the drugs not drugs nature infowarslife.com
[02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:53.080]  powered by nature not drugs exactly i'm pitching something here to you
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:56.440]  because it's amazing dna force infowarslife.com
[02:23:56.440 --> 02:24:12.040]  recall toll-free 888-253-3139
[02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:14.920]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night and i'm talking to the
[02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:19.800]  lawyer of debora jean paulfree the former dc madame of course
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:24.040]  back in 2006 she was arrested for running an escort service is very popular
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:27.880]  in washington especially amongst republicans that outed
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:32.280]  very key people like senator david vitter from louisiana deputy secretary
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:35.400]  of state randall tabias and dick morris we all
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:40.600]  know dick morris all republicans uh sibling who was representing her at the
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:43.160]  time said that he uh had about uh i think it was
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:47.160]  10th has been reported you had about 10 000 phone numbers mr
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:51.800]  uh sibling and you said uh that you held some of those back for leverage is that
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:55.720]  correct uh you've got 2500 at least that you say nobody has
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:58.840]  seen before or have been put online is that correct
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:01.640]  yes exactly so because when you litigate you don't want to you know put
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:05.160]  everything out to begin with you need some uh surprise witnesses for trial
[02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:08.680]  and of course this is in the news because you have publicly stated of course
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:12.040]  you've been trying to get this stuff released going back to january but
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:16.440]  you publicly stated that this time is of the essence on this because of the
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:20.440]  republican election or the presidential election i should say
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:23.880]  tell me where we go from here because you have appealed to the supreme court to
[02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:27.240]  try to lift the stay that would prevent you from that is
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:29.720]  preventing you from releasing information what where do you go from
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:33.880]  here with this information well i mean quite candidly if i don't
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:38.280]  get released from the supreme court or the circuit court of appeal or the
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:42.600]  district court which issued the gag orders uh by uh the middle of next week
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:49.720]  i'm going to release a list of the entities government and private
[02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:53.640]  that are on the list as a demonstration that there are
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:57.880]  significant people involved in this list i can do that because i'm
[02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:01.720]  prohibited from releasing the names of the customers not the companies and
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:04.840]  government agencies the customers were working for
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:09.080]  i'm going to hope that that and perhaps the public support i get for that
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:13.560]  action will convince the courts that i deserve the simple right every citizen
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:17.960]  of this country has which is to be heard to petition the government and to be
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:22.200]  heard on my claim that this information needs to be made public
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:25.800]  because my goodness it's an election year this is a first amendment right to
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:29.800]  speak and it's being uh denied to me and i agree with you wholeheartedly i think
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:33.000]  we need to know the information needs to be made public
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:36.520]  we need to know this information if it involves any of these presidential
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:39.880]  candidates and of course our government looks at everything in our private
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:42.760]  lives nothing is off limits to the government
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:45.960]  and they repeatedly say they don't even need a search warrant
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:48.600]  they don't have to be specific about what they're looking for they just grab
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:53.160]  these massive search warrants with Verizon looking interestingly enough
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:57.880]  using these these pen techniques just going out and grabbing a phone number
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:01.800]  tracking people's information as they move around
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:05.480]  so you're going to release then not specific names
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:09.480]  but the connections to organizations to to try to show
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:14.600]  the significance significance here right exactly so because i believe
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:19.880]  remember it's not only the candidates themselves but there are 435 congressional
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:23.560]  districts they'll be up for election yes they're the vice presidential candidates
[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:27.880]  which will ultimately be announced there's the executives who will
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:31.800]  populate the major branches of government after the election
[02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:36.600]  all those people are um you know to my mind
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:40.360]  fair game or inquiry into their private behavior because it may well
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:44.840]  compromise their public behavior but we know the government has used their
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:49.320]  their surveillance techniques to persuade people to blackmail people to
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:53.080]  follow people around in their private affairs and i'll just you know pose this
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.520]  question instead of outing senator bitter what if i had gone to and said
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:27:59.720]  gee i'd like my son appointed the west point exactly
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:03.560]  exactly that's the danger that this government can keep what they want for
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:06.920]  their purposes but we the people can't know for our purposes
[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:10.200]  and all i'm asking is for a day in court David and i don't think that's too
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:13.560]  much to ask from the judicial system i'm getting impatient with their denial to
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:17.560]  allow me even that or even more importantly than your own personal
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:22.600]  preferences if some agency were to come to a senator or to a judge
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:26.200]  and say we would like to give you we'd like for you to give us carte blanche
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:29.560]  on this new legislation that we want to do or this new power that we want to
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:33.400]  assume and if you don't do it we're going to expose you that's the thing that
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:36.600]  concerns me the most even more than the corruption of
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:41.560]  political favors is the fact that we have uh very ambitious bureaucracies that
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:45.800]  are building their empires and they can very easily blackmail these senators
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:48.760]  or presidents to do whatever they wish
[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:52.680]  well remember when i was representing her i not only subpoenaed the
[02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:56.920]  telephone companies i subpoenaed the fbi department of state internal revenue
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:00.520]  service postal inspection service the director of national intelligence
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:04.440]  central intelligence agency defense intelligence agency national security
[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:07.560]  agency department of state bureau of intelligence
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:11.560]  and a 16 local dc law enforcement agencies and the white house
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:15.320]  uh and i think that illustrates the fact you know as we've got a clip that
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:17.960]  we're going to play coming up in the next segment we're going to talking to
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:21.000]  wane madson who also knew the dc madam and who

[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:32.440]  an excellent investigative journalist i've seen him work first hand at the

[02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:40.040]  he knew the dc madam and we're going to talk to him as well as play
[02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:44.360]  a clip when alex was on the heraldo show and they're talking about
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:48.440]  the death of the dc madam the suspicious circumstances but we're also
[02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:52.600]  going to talk to him about the data and what we just learned from
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:56.280]  mr cibley the lawyer of the dc madam before we do
[02:33:56.280 --> 02:33:59.480]  real quickly i want to let you know that we have dna force back
[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:03.480]  and not only is it back but we've added a new ingredient to a new powerful
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:07.320]  ingredient but it's the same price it's now dna force
[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:10.520]  plus is back in stock and of course dna force itself
[02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:15.720]  is loaded with the patented bio pqq compound backed by 175 clinical studies
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:20.360]  it's extremely hard to secure that's why it goes in and out of stock so much it's
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:24.760]  been out of uh sold out for months and we expect to sell out of this very
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:28.280]  quickly so get your uh get your dna force now
[02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:31.720]  while it is available or sign up for auto ship
[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:34.680]  that is a key thing to do for any of our products
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:38.600]  because all of them sell out but none of them i think sell out as quickly as
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:41.880]  dna force and of course these 175 clinical studies have
[02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:46.040]  associated it with nerve growth factor that's why we talk about
[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:49.720]  dna force if you look at the telomeres it's one of the best ways to
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:53.480]  indicate somebody's real biological age it's kind of like
[02:34:53.480 --> 02:34:56.040]  shoestrings and the end of the shoestring you know how you've got the
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:59.080]  little tip there that keeps the shoestring from unraveling
[02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:03.720]  that's what the telomeres are on your dna that keeps the dna from starting to
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:06.360]  unravel and so the length of those telomeres really
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:10.840]  are a good indicator of your chronological your true but biological age i
[02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:15.560]  should say this is a patented ingredient in dna force a bio pqq and
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:19.080]  it contains more potent and antioxidant activity than
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:22.920]  vitamin c again it is available now at info wars life dot com

[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:22.360]  washington dc somebody who's had a lot of experience in and out of
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:27.000]  washington and was that place like the swamp that it is wane
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:33.400]  thanks for joining us yes tell us your take on what's going on with
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:37.480]  this new aspect of the of the story of the dc
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:42.120]  madam you had knowledge of this at the time it happened about 10 years ago
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:49.560]  yes i do recall when blare sibley was issuing those
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:56.200]  subpoenas to all those federal agencies and also to the phone companies
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:37:01.720]  i guess what i was not aware of then but i and he just mentioned it
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:06.920]  that the verizon did respond with the identities of
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:14.440]  the 815 owners of those cell phones now i was
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:18.280]  either i think i was the first to receive the
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:24.200]  cds with the raw copies of gene palfrey's
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:28.040]  telephone records and they included verizon and
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:31.880]  and bell tell the bell telephone company
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:37.400]  at the time chesapeake and patomic or bell atlantic
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:46.600]  and i began to try to trace back some of those numbers now
[02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:52.360]  also at the same time dan maldea was doing the same thing it
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:57.400]  turns out we were both working but but not together
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:38:01.880]  on the same team but we were both doing this on behalf of
[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:08.920]  larry flint and i i went to the libraries in the area to look at the
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:13.160]  old heinz crisscross directories where you have a list of numbers and then you
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:18.200]  can track back to the person who had the
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:23.880]  telephone now these were only good for land lines
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:28.280]  and marketers use those in the old days
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:33.480]  and so i looked at those and it was a time consuming effort
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:37.400]  but it was quite clear that there were some
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:43.080]  numbers of interest now i recall that one number that i
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:47.320]  pretty well locked in belonged to somebody who had been
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:53.720]  an official with pat robertson the televangelist
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:39:00.200]  and another number went right back to the centrex switch
[02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:06.120]  of the bush cheney transition team in 2000 which was located in the west
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:12.360]  building in mclean virginia now that's that's of interest
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:16.280]  i didn't get anybody's name because it's this it's the central switch
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:20.040]  you get to when you call bush cheney transition team
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:26.040]  headquarters but we do know that ted cruz was one of the lawyers
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:29.880]  for the bush team and the bush versus gore
[02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:36.520]  uh uh legal issues going on down in uh florid at the time
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:40.840]  yes so and he was traveling back and forth because he had been with the
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:47.560]  bush cheney campaign he actually joined the bush campaign in 1999 in austin
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:55.960]  um so i would not be surprised uh whether there were calls from ted cruz
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:40:00.360]  to the escort service either from his own cell phone or
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:05.080]  from bush cheney transition team headquarters at the west building
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:10.200]  in mclean virginia now that's a i think that's kind of interesting now
[02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:14.680]  aside from that i used every source i had in the intelligence community
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:18.280]  and law enforcement to see if i could get
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:23.480]  uh outside of those numbers uh any names of interest
[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:29.480]  and uh i was told uh by people were on the inside i got to say that
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:35.160]  the reports that i issued on the dc madams custa clients
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:41.400]  resulted in a number of uh what i would say um walks through the park by people
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:45.800]  at the cia uh when you you know you're not being
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:49.880]  surveilled and this is where you leave your cell phone in the glove box of your
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:54.440]  car uh but three names of interest that came up from these sources
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:58.520]  dick cheney before he was vice president when he was the president of
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:03.560]  halliburton kelloch brown enroute uh and then when he lived in mclean virginia
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:08.120]  before he moved to dallas uh the late senator uh fred
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:12.600]  tomsen and the current senator john mccain wow
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:15.720]  wow that's big news yeah i wasn't aware of that is that something that was not
[02:41:15.720 --> 02:41:19.160]  previously reported or no i reported it okay all right i wasn't
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:22.440]  aware of that in those days nobody was paying attention
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:28.200]  you know gene poffrey gave a partial list that brian ross at abc news and
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:31.960]  and they said oh we looked through several of these records and we decided
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:39.240]  there were no names of interest yeah basically abc uh rolled over honor
[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:42.440]  and in a typical fashion for the corporate media
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:47.160]  they knew there were names on there but they uh but in addition though
[02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:51.800]  presidential candidates senators and vice presidents and abc news reporters
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:55.720]  is probably the real well that's interesting you know i've
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:42:00.440]  got an article here of course uh we had mr cibley saying that he was
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:03.640]  trying to get this information release going back to january we know the
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:07.240]  rubio campaign was uh shopping information around
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:11.400]  alleging that ted cruz had been involved in things like this uh beginning of
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:15.000]  march we also had anonymous which is hard to pin down you don't know anybody can
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.480]  say they're anonymous anybody can put stuff out there
[02:42:17.480 --> 02:42:20.840]  there's a report that uh they're threatening uh ted cruz and there is a
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:25.480]  blogger marshal reports they claims that they have some reversed some of these
[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:29.560]  numbers to cruises private numbers i'm not sure uh how they would have done
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:36.040]  that but that's the neither that's the the uh the what the buzz is around this
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:39.240]  and of course i don't think it was you but i think it was the other
[02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:43.080]  investigator that you mentioned said that he would have remembered if it had been
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:47.160]  any of the presidential candidates currently
[02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:51.480]  except for ted cruz who was not on the radar because he was part of you know
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:55.080]  he's a lawyer at a lower level working for the bush administration at that time
[02:42:55.080 --> 02:42:59.000]  he would not have drawn any attention to anybody looking at names he's not a
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.800]  fray thompson or senator came in and molde has said of the candidates for
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:07.560]  president he would have known the names of of course
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:15.320]  birdie sanders of course uh donald trump um and john kasek who was
[02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:19.560]  a congressman he was the chairman of the budget committee at the time so he's
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:24.760]  pretty well known yeah and and i asked gene pawfrey specifically
[02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:30.680]  uh gene you don't deal in any uh call boys she said no only women so
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:36.040]  that would ostensibly uh have uh let hillary clinton off the hook although i
[02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:42.360]  understand her appetites have gone uh in both directions over the
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:45.560]  well yeah and i think dan also mentioned her name is as being one of the
[02:43:45.560 --> 02:43:48.360]  course that he would have recognized at the time as well now a lot of people
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:50.920]  who think that this is not something that's important or something that we
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:55.080]  should be covering of course it opens candidates up to blackmail
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:58.760]  and we don't believe uh many of us don't find it
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:03.400]  credible that she and the other lady who was uh i think worked for her worked
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:06.520]  in conjunction with her that both committed suicide
[02:44:06.520 --> 02:44:10.360]  were told by hanging i want to play this clip
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:14.040]  where alex jones went on with herald and not only
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:18.760]  alex jones but herald and two other people there at fox news were talking
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:23.480]  about this at the time they did not find it very credible that uh this is
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:26.920]  something that's very rare for women to commit suicide by hanging and of course
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:30.120]  we had two of these hangings and as one of the ladies there uh janine
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:33.880]  perero said uh there was no government program to take down
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:37.080]  prostitutes but there was a program to take down
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:41.400]  the dc madam let's play that clip no i'm not planning to commit suicide i'm
[02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:44.360]  planning to go into court on april seventh night
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:49.000]  plan on exposing the government in ways that you know i do not think they want
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:53.480]  me to expose them join me now from Austin texas the well-known radio host
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:57.000]  himself the conspiracy theorist and documentary filmmaker alex jones alex
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:00.520]  interviewed uh deborah palfrey in march of this year when she told him
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:04.360]  what you just heard that she would never commit suicide so alex uh welcome what
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:09.240]  do you think uh do you believe this to be as the authorities say it is
[02:45:09.240 --> 02:45:13.400]  herald of first off thanks for having me on uh she was a very nice lady uh very
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:16.360]  genteel there's no doubt in my mind that she was murdered
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:19.800]  let me just go through some of the basic evidence she told me repeatedly on my
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:23.560]  radio show and those interviews are posted at info wars dot com in full
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:26.600]  that she would never kill herself that she wasn't planning to kill herself i
[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:28.760]  pressed her during breaks in front of the board ops
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:31.240]  i said listen this is dangerous you've got to say
[02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:35.240]  who these people were uh you know do you know and she said well i'm not going to
[02:45:35.240 --> 02:45:38.680]  say i just want this all to end and i said you've got to say
[02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:41.800]  uh who it was you're not safe she said listen i'll never kill myself
[02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:45.800]  if they claim that i was murdered so we have a tape of her saying she wouldn't
[02:45:45.800 --> 02:45:50.520]  commit suicide now mbc in florida where she had a condo is
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:53.640]  reporting that one of her friends who was the manager of the high-rise
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:57.080]  condos and he's on tape saying two days before she was
[02:45:57.080 --> 02:46:01.400]  killed before she died she left her mothers and said look i'm being followed
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:05.160]  i think there's a contract out on me i'm not going to kill myself
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:08.280]  this is on tape then you look at brandy britain
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:12.840]  she was facing six months in jail last year shot her mouth off
[02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:15.880]  miss palfrey said that he seemed adam said and said i'm going to talk about
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:19.160]  who my johns are this is hypocritical she was a professor
[02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:22.440]  you know she had a psychology degree she was saying this is hypocritical i'm
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:25.320]  going to tell who my johns were and then she hangs herself
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:28.600]  number one heraldo you've covered a lot of criminology you know women don't
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:30.840]  normally hang themselves first one of her
[02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:36.040]  true girls kills herself now she kills herself they take pills uh
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:39.560]  exactly and on top of it her in fact 90 percent of women take pills that's
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:42.840]  the way they do it now now men shoot themselves and hang themselves now on
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:47.000]  top of it her mother said she was happy saying she was going to fight it
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:50.680]  let me take a break stand yeah that's what they were saying at the time and
[02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:53.560]  of course that's what we're all concerned about as i was talking to
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:57.880]  mr cibley the former lawyer of the dc madam what he was saying was what if i
[02:46:57.880 --> 02:47:01.480]  had this information and i went to one of these
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:05.400]  powerful men and said uh i want an appointment to west point for my son
[02:47:05.400 --> 02:47:08.280]  but you know the thing that concerns me as i said to him was
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:13.000]  what if it's the uh cia that has this information or the nsa or somebody who
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:16.360]  wants to uh not only just get personal favors but they
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:20.440]  want to do something that is going perhaps uh start a war or alter our
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:24.600]  constitution and they blackmail a supreme court judge or do something like
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:27.640]  that that's why we have to be concerned about this and that's why this
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:31.640]  information ought to be out there these people are engaging in something
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:36.200]  that uh supposedly a crime in dc it's it's treated that way then this
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:40.840]  information ought to be out there these are people who violated the current law
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:43.640]  and if they're not prosecuting them we ought to at least know who these
[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:47.880]  powerful people are who could be blackmailed or turned to do
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:51.160]  whatever the people have this information wish them to do
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:54.600]  well i believe the cia does have the information because one of the odd
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:58.840]  things that gene powfrey did in her trial was she tried to invoke the
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:03.640]  classified information procedures act now when do you invoke that well
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:06.600]  you invoke it when you have signed a nondisclosure
[02:48:06.600 --> 02:48:12.280]  confidentiality agreement with the cia and you uh get indicted for some reason
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:16.040]  and you then say well listen um it's called graymail
[02:48:16.040 --> 02:48:20.120]  oliver north and john poindexter the national security advisor
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:24.280]  effectively did this in iran contra and what you do is you say
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:28.520]  look i want to say some things about who i was really working for here but i
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:32.440]  need to be covered under my nondisclosure agreement so i
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:38.520]  i'm asking the court that i can uh now provide classified information in in
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:44.200]  camera with the judge and and and the court said no you cannot invoke the
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:48.280]  classified information procedures act why because when you look
[02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:51.800]  at some of these escorts that gene powfrey was running you're not talking
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:57.160]  about barely uh english speaking uh girls from
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:00.600]  mexico or south korea or thailand you're talking about
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:04.760]  brandy britain a professor at the university of maryland baltimore campus
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:11.000]  you're talking about a professor at the us naval academy was one of her
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:14.760]  escorts so one of them was a psychiatrist a 58-year-old
[02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:19.000]  psychiatrist in montgomery county maryland you know why she was using
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:23.640]  people like that because when they got with say a visiting foreign official
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:27.640]  an oil minister a foreign businessman you know
[02:49:27.640 --> 02:49:31.720]  their briefcases are available their laptops are available
[02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:35.480]  i would suggest that gene powfrey and one of the reasons she was trying to
[02:49:35.480 --> 02:49:38.680]  leave to go move to an apartment in east berlin
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:42.520]  which he obtained for 70 000 dollars is pretty cheap
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:46.120]  is she had a relationship with the former head of the cia's
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:49.640]  logistics operations in frankford a guy named kyle
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:53.400]  dusty fago who also went to prison for fraud
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:58.440]  and um he eventually wound up as the executive director of the cia
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:02.040]  and of course we know that the nsa and the cia have this information
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:04.680]  and if you go back to the church committee hearings to the pike committee
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:06.760]  hearings that were happening at the same time
[02:50:06.760 --> 02:50:11.240]  they were tapping people's phones which is what they're doing right now
[02:50:11.240 --> 02:50:15.320]  they created the faiza act the foreign intelligence surveillance act
[02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:19.480]  in order to stop that kind of surveillance but then they use the faiza
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:23.480]  act to set up essentially a star chamber court that allowed them to get
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:27.400]  these broadcast search warrants they're not specific to anybody
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:30.680]  so we know that these intelligence services
[02:50:30.680 --> 02:50:34.840]  know this information on these politicians we need to know which ones
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:38.680]  are compromised because you just pointed out if we've got people like oliver
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:42.360]  north and john poindexter running some kind of a secret war somewhere they're
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:45.640]  going to go continue that secret war by blackmailing a
[02:50:45.640 --> 02:50:48.280]  senator that they have information on stay with us we're gonna be right back
[02:50:48.280 --> 02:51:00.760]  with investigative journalist wane madson

[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:40.760]  name that keeps coming up is ted cruise and as i've said
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:44.040]  when the national inquire made the allegations that they did
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:49.720]  and he denied them and i said i have uh i find national inquire to be far more
[02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:52.920]  credible than ted cruise and we look at the things that he's done
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:56.760]  with the with ben carson the reversals that he's had on so many different
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:01.720]  issues like ed snowden and privacy on the trade treaties and so forth
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:06.520]  uh i national inquire has done this many many times they have
[02:56:06.520 --> 02:56:12.200]  taken down people like ed snowden i'm sorry john edwards too many eds there
[02:56:12.200 --> 02:56:16.360]  john edwards they've also gary hart many others
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:21.080]  and the issue with this is weird just talking about is the fact that you can
[02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:25.160]  not only show somebody to be a fraud but you can make them into a complete
[02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:29.000]  laughing stock i noticed that one of the names on here was dick morris and i know
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:33.160]  that rush lumbar used to troll him incessantly as the
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:36.760]  toe sucker that's that's just one thing right there that can just
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:41.960]  makes destroy somebody's reputation even if they wouldn't normally be
[02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:46.680]  destroyed by the fact that they had visited a a call girl they might be
[02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:50.040]  embarrassed by the details that came out about that
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:53.400]  yeah you know there were so many aspects to this
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:58.680]  uh a case that went far actually beyond washington there was also a baltimore
[02:56:58.680 --> 02:57:03.400]  aspect the u.s attorney for uh um maryland at the time and baltimore
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:09.000]  tom bigagio uh was actually the first u.s attorney fired
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:14.520]  after um uh bush's uh reelection reason being
[02:57:14.520 --> 02:57:19.800]  is he was looking at the involvement of then republican governor maryland bob
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:25.480]  earlick in this whole uh operation and that tied in with the limousine service
[02:57:25.480 --> 02:57:29.800]  called shirlington limo and jack aberman off and randy duke
[02:57:29.800 --> 02:57:33.560]  conningham from san diego who went to jail representative
[02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:39.560]  and poker parties taking these uh escorts to poker parties at the water
[02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:44.600]  gate hotel and another washington hotel and
[02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:48.680]  president the poker party would be randy duke conningham and none other
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:52.360]  none other than porter goss the then director of the central
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:56.840]  intelligence agent agency so you know uh no wonder they
[02:57:56.840 --> 02:58:01.080]  they they killed gene paul free no wonder they killed brandy britain
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:05.320]  because there were big heads going to roll there and remember
[02:58:05.320 --> 02:58:09.240]  that uh bush eventually demanded porter goss's
[02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:16.200]  resignation now uh i believe that that was not uh uh uh uh for some other
[02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:19.160]  reason than his involvement in those poker parties
[02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:22.440]  we got to take a break but stay with us wane we come back i want to ask you
[02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:25.480]  where you think this is going to go because we have seen

[02:58:29.320 --> 02:58:32.680]  drip of information that unfolds over a gradual process
[02:58:32.680 --> 02:58:36.600]  and of course i want to ask you about her lawyer simply saying that he's going

[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:46.040]  now wane is as we're looking at this and of course
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:49.560]  mr. simply said that he is going to release some information
[03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:53.400]  next week what's your sense of this so do you think that the mainstream media is
[03:00:53.400 --> 03:00:57.240]  going to completely paper this over for ted cruise i mean we saw him
[03:00:57.240 --> 03:01:02.280]  meet with megan kelly over the weekend she appeared with him and her
[03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:08.040]  prodda heels her $1,200 proddas and did a denial that he had ever cheated on his
[03:01:08.040 --> 03:01:13.560]  wife of course this goes earlier than the time the time in question is before
[03:01:13.560 --> 03:01:16.600]  he got married how do you see this unfolding are they
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:19.960]  going to be able to cover this up or do you think this is going to be a drip
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:24.760]  drip of continuing revelations from a national inquire from other sources
[03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:28.280]  well notice how cruise answered that question he said i've always been
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:31.240]  faithful to my wife he that he didn't talk about what happened
[03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:36.040]  before they got married in 2001 we're talking about bush chaney transition
[03:01:36.040 --> 03:01:40.840]  in december 2000 into january and then the time he spent with the campaign
[03:01:40.840 --> 03:01:45.720]  before that uh so uh and then and then you know typical
[03:01:45.720 --> 03:01:49.320]  cruise when he's hit with something he tried to
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:55.320]  attack the messenger he referred to the name of the publisher of the
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:01:58.600]  national inquire and the other american media
[03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:03.000]  publications because of his last name he tried to make some
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:06.920]  joke out of that that even kind of appalled megan kelly if you saw she
[03:02:06.920 --> 03:02:10.040]  a real back and said oh my god you went there
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:13.880]  because the publisher's name is david pecker you know wink wink
[03:02:13.880 --> 03:02:19.560]  aha you know i mean is that is that is that is that the real ted cruise somebody who
[03:02:19.560 --> 03:02:24.040]  you know engages in such a infantile and that's just that way we don't know who
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:27.800]  real ted cruises um that's just that we don't know who the red
[03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:31.960]  real ted cruises is this guy a canadian is in american i mean he was a canadian
[03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:36.600]  citizen until after he became a senator and then he got rid of his
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:39.720]  citizenship so so he could run for president i mean everything about this
[03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:44.680]  guy from the get-go is phony yeah i mean my dad had a name for people like him
[03:02:44.680 --> 03:02:49.000]  and he's a foreflusher you know uh he's just you know the guy uh
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:53.560]  the guy uh he claims he's a great debater yet he had to resort to making fun of
[03:02:53.560 --> 03:02:57.640]  somebody's last name uh in in in his interview with
[03:02:57.640 --> 03:03:01.160]  megan kelly but where do i think this is going i think the
[03:03:01.160 --> 03:03:06.200]  mainstream media will eat around the edges like they did uh you know when i
[03:03:06.200 --> 03:03:10.840]  exposed ennis haster now now there's four you know others that come up and said
[03:03:10.840 --> 03:03:15.240]  yeah we were we were abused by him too but back in 2006 no one was
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:18.840]  interested and now they're all interested that's right you broke that way
[03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:22.360]  before anybody else did alex wasn't even comfortable going there with that
[03:03:22.360 --> 03:03:26.440]  information but you were way ahead of the the curve that you got your ear
[03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:30.840]  to the ground as to what's going on in that swamp we call washington dc i guess
[03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:34.760]  i you know rom on the potomac is what many people call it man it really is like
[03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:39.560]  realm like colegula's realm it it's a bad place and you know when
[03:03:39.560 --> 03:03:43.720]  people may have their heroes uh in in both parties but
[03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:47.880]  over the years i've come to the realization that
[03:03:47.880 --> 03:03:51.960]  uh you know none none of these guys or women walk on water
[03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:55.960]  that's right and so we're we're gonna see
[03:03:55.960 --> 03:03:59.720]  a lot more information i think come out and you know it's
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:06.280]  with ted cruz it's going to be uh political uh his political demise by a
[03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:09.400]  thousand cuts you know and and that's the thing i mean
[03:04:09.400 --> 03:04:12.920]  even if there is absolutely nothing to this story
[03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:16.840]  to me what he did to ben carson his fellow christian for him to parade his
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:19.400]  piety in public for him to say he and his wife

[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:26.680]  as a christian i'm offended by what he has done that is known
[03:04:26.680 --> 03:04:30.920]  and made public and this just brings up more issues to me
[03:04:30.920 --> 03:04:34.200]  i saw the way that he diverted these questions about his natural born
[03:04:34.200 --> 03:04:39.160]  citizenship he didn't answer them he said hey i'm a lawyer i know these things
[03:04:39.160 --> 03:04:43.560]  and so don't question me on this he believes in the end justifies the
[03:04:43.560 --> 03:04:46.760]  means right i don't find any christianity in that

[03:05:06.920 --> 03:05:10.840]  suicide bombers according to a report in france's lamal newspaper
[03:05:10.840 --> 03:05:14.440]  the man in the hat could be naeem alhamad who was born in syria in
[03:05:14.440 --> 03:05:19.000]  88 and arrived in europe amongst the wave of refugees who entered via greece
[03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:23.000]  last year alhamad arrived with sofian ayari another suspected brussels

[03:08:16.600 --> 03:08:23.880]  in defense of human liberty alex jones
[03:08:23.880 --> 03:08:27.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show on david night and our host for this fourth
[03:08:27.240 --> 03:08:33.160]  hour is paul joseph watson from london i got an article from nico our
[03:08:33.160 --> 03:08:37.080]  producer here he was saying that paul had something about a european legislator
[03:08:37.080 --> 03:08:41.240]  paul who was raped by a migrant but doesn't want this person deported i mean
[03:08:41.240 --> 03:08:44.840]  is this person from a stock home is this a stock home syndrome that we're
[03:08:44.840 --> 03:08:47.960]  seeing here well i mean this is the point i've
[03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:53.320]  made over and over again david we had feminist in cologne handing out roses
[03:08:53.320 --> 03:08:58.280]  to migrants at an asylum center after the mass molestation of women
[03:08:58.280 --> 03:09:03.080]  on new year's eve which now we know is confirmed was covered up by the police
[03:09:03.080 --> 03:09:07.080]  just as they've been covering up these rapes for months and months
[03:09:07.080 --> 03:09:12.200]  in our own words so as to not legitimize critics of mass migration
[03:09:12.200 --> 03:09:15.400]  they don't care about the victims they don't care about the women being raped
[03:09:15.400 --> 03:09:19.160]  they care about the perception about the narrative
[03:09:19.160 --> 03:09:24.200]  so now this has gone one step deeper into insanity this is an article out of
[03:09:24.200 --> 03:09:28.760]  breitbart after anal rape left-wing activists felt
[03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:33.480]  guilt and responsibility his migrant attacker was deported
[03:09:33.480 --> 03:09:37.160]  and it reads a left-wing activist has bared all to a norwegian documentary
[03:09:37.160 --> 03:09:40.040]  crew about his rape at the hands of a Somalian
[03:09:40.040 --> 03:09:43.640]  migrant and his despair at seeing the man deported
[03:09:43.640 --> 03:09:47.560]  this is an active member of the norwegian socialist left party
[03:09:47.560 --> 03:09:52.840]  who described himself as an ardent feminist and anti-racist
[03:09:52.840 --> 03:09:56.040]  explained the difficulty he experienced excepting that he had been
[03:09:56.040 --> 03:10:00.840]  anally raped by a male migrant he said he didn't blame the man for the attack
[03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:04.520]  and regretted the fact that he had been sent back to Somalia
[03:10:04.520 --> 03:10:08.360]  and we've seen this before in sweden especially
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:13.480]  there was a woman on a train who got raped by a couple of iraki migrants
[03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:18.120]  she felt guilty because she said that they had been traumatized
[03:10:18.120 --> 03:10:21.480]  and so it kind of entitled them to rape her
[03:10:21.480 --> 03:10:25.160]  and she didn't initially report it to police because she feared
[03:10:25.160 --> 03:10:28.920]  that these rapists being migrants would be deported
[03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:33.480]  so it's an almost identical situation again it's about this man putting
[03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:36.680]  himself on trial for his own white guilt
[03:10:36.680 --> 03:10:39.400]  even though he's the victim of this attack and
[03:10:39.400 --> 03:10:43.560]  you mentioned Stockholm syndrome that's that's exactly what it is there's
[03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:47.320]  another psychological phenomenon which is similar called
[03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:51.160]  traumatic bonding and that's when a victim
[03:10:51.160 --> 03:10:55.960]  adopts the same values of the aggressor because if they do so
[03:10:55.960 --> 03:10:59.640]  the aggressor ceases to be perceived as a threat
[03:10:59.640 --> 03:11:03.640]  so you know instead of accepting the reality of the problem that we have to
[03:11:03.640 --> 03:11:06.120]  face up to this that we're importing this terrible
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:11.560]  culture this actual rape culture we're importing it into europe into the west
[03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:16.440]  it's easier to deny it by just identifying with the perpetrator
[03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:20.200]  which is now we've seen in all these situations they say well
[03:11:20.200 --> 03:11:23.800]  they were traumatized I mean you can understand why they would want to
[03:11:23.800 --> 03:11:26.280]  rape us and we should feel guilty about it
[03:11:26.280 --> 03:11:30.120]  complete mental illness complete Stockholm syndrome
[03:11:30.120 --> 03:11:33.400]  and when most of the victims in these cases are
[03:11:33.400 --> 03:11:37.000]  young children as we saw again in Germany a couple of days ago
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:40.040]  we have to reject this ridiculous notion
[03:11:40.040 --> 03:11:44.120]  that somehow these individuals are entitled to rape
[03:11:44.120 --> 03:11:47.720]  women men and children because they're traumatized it's completely ludicrous
[03:11:47.720 --> 03:11:50.760]  you're talking about these young children that was something that that
[03:11:50.760 --> 03:11:54.680]  really really profoundly disturbed my wife to see that video of that migrant
[03:11:54.680 --> 03:11:57.560]  who was holding that baby and threatening to throw that baby and
[03:11:57.560 --> 03:12:00.600]  shaking the baby and everything this is what we're seeing
[03:12:00.600 --> 03:12:03.960]  you know on the other side in terms of people waking up
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:07.080]  and understanding that there's something insane here i've heard
[03:12:07.080 --> 03:12:11.160]  multiple people not just calling in to our program calling in to when we're
[03:12:11.160 --> 03:12:13.560]  doing the debates but i've also heard people calling
[03:12:13.560 --> 03:12:16.680]  into local talk radio people are coming from central and
[03:12:16.680 --> 03:12:20.680]  south america saying hey i like trump because
[03:12:20.680 --> 03:12:24.440]  i don't want a lot of these bad people that i'm running away from in these
[03:12:24.440 --> 03:12:27.800]  other countries to be able to follow me into this country i want
[03:12:27.800 --> 03:12:32.040]  something done about this i want these people vetted
[03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:37.400]  yeah and if you look at the polls when rubio was still in the race back a few
[03:12:37.400 --> 03:12:41.720]  weeks ago donald trump had more support amongst
[03:12:41.720 --> 03:12:45.800]  muslims in america than all the other gop candidates combined
[03:12:45.800 --> 03:12:49.000]  obviously not a lot of muslims are going to vote for him in the first place
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:52.360]  because generally people from those areas of the world are
[03:12:52.360 --> 03:12:56.520]  dependent on government they vote for an expansion of the welfare state so they're
[03:12:56.520 --> 03:13:01.960]  more likely to support democrats but amongst the muslims who are republicans
[03:13:01.960 --> 03:13:06.280]  again trump had more support from muslims and all the other candidates combined
[03:13:06.280 --> 03:13:09.320]  and it's because the ones who have assimilated
[03:13:09.320 --> 03:13:13.880]  and that's the only way that it works is to bring in skilled migrants
[03:13:13.880 --> 03:13:20.040]  at a slow you know pace not 300 000 a year like we do in britain
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:24.600]  that's when it works that's when they build businesses they become assimilated
[03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:29.320]  they adopt american values they want to pursue happiness you know build wealth
[03:13:29.320 --> 03:13:33.080]  have happy families and actually integrate into society
[03:13:33.080 --> 03:13:37.400]  and when they do that they look back to the countries where they came from
[03:13:37.400 --> 03:13:42.040]  these police state hellholes which have an incredibly low standard of living
[03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:46.680]  and they say we don't want to import hundreds of thousands of people from
[03:13:46.680 --> 03:13:51.320]  north africa and the middle east because we will become like north africa and
[03:13:51.320 --> 03:13:55.240]  the middle east because they don't assimilate the pace of immigration is so
[03:13:55.240 --> 03:13:59.240]  fast there is no you know program of assimilation there
[03:13:59.240 --> 03:14:01.960]  isn't in europe and that's why they turn europe
[03:14:01.960 --> 03:14:06.120]  into north africa and the middle east because they create these ghettos
[03:14:06.120 --> 03:14:09.640]  exactly they self-ghettos wise because they bring in so many people at a time
[03:14:09.640 --> 03:14:13.080]  that's the that's the core issue by bringing them in and the large
[03:14:13.080 --> 03:14:15.800]  groups just like you said they create ghettos because they
[03:14:15.800 --> 03:14:19.400]  self-ghettos they don't if they they have a large enough group of
[03:14:19.400 --> 03:14:23.240]  people that come in together they don't want to mix with the
[03:14:23.240 --> 03:14:27.640]  the population that's already there they don't adopt the legal cultural language
[03:14:27.640 --> 03:14:32.360]  uh that of that nation they stay within that small area and i think it makes it
[03:14:32.360 --> 03:14:36.040]  more easy for them to radicalize of course you know when you've got a large
[03:14:36.040 --> 03:14:38.840]  number of people coming in as well if you've only got as we've mentioned
[03:14:38.840 --> 03:14:41.480]  before doing the math looking at the number of people that come into europe
[03:14:41.480 --> 03:14:44.280]  if you only have one tenth of one percent you've got
[03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:48.840]  hundreds or thousands of people who are radical jihadists who could come in
[03:14:48.840 --> 03:14:53.000]  even though you got 99.9 percent of the people that are okay you still got
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:56.360]  if you've got a massive number of people you still got a significant number of
[03:14:56.360 --> 03:15:00.360]  people who are radicals and those radicals can easily radicalize the
[03:15:00.360 --> 03:15:03.480]  second generation who doesn't really understand what's going on with this they
[03:15:03.480 --> 03:15:06.680]  didn't see the previous country all they know is that they grew up
[03:15:06.680 --> 03:15:11.480]  in this ghetto and they're resentful of the outside culture that they've never
[03:15:11.480 --> 03:15:17.080]  been really allowed to mix with well that's exactly right and again
[03:15:17.080 --> 03:15:20.920]  you saw today yet another one of the individuals involved in plotting the
[03:15:20.920 --> 03:15:26.040]  pat the brussels bombing was a syrian refugee he came in from syria through
[03:15:26.040 --> 03:15:29.400]  Greece into europe so of course a percentage of these
[03:15:29.400 --> 03:15:34.200]  individuals if you import them in such vast numbers are going to be jihadists
[03:15:34.200 --> 03:15:38.360]  and with the ghettos in fact isis said in its own manifesto
[03:15:38.360 --> 03:15:42.520]  which was released back in december that they're going to exploit this migrant
[03:15:42.520 --> 03:15:45.880]  wave to create those ghettos because they're the
[03:15:45.880 --> 03:15:49.160]  perfect breeding ground for radicalization
[03:15:49.160 --> 03:15:54.040]  and you saw that with salaw abdeslam of course he hid out in mollambique for
[03:15:54.040 --> 03:15:58.760]  three months after the paris massacre and he was able to do so because he was
[03:15:58.760 --> 03:16:02.520]  protected by his friends and neighbors which is the
[03:16:02.520 --> 03:16:05.720]  point i make over and over again the problem we have
[03:16:05.720 --> 03:16:11.560]  isn't just with jihadists yes a tiny percentage of muslims are actually
[03:16:11.560 --> 03:16:15.800]  jihadists but a whole bigger percentage of muslims
[03:16:15.800 --> 03:16:20.840]  are islamists so they will give protection to jihadists to force their
[03:16:20.840 --> 03:16:23.400]  brand of islam on the world and that's what happened
[03:16:23.400 --> 03:16:26.520]  in mollambique when they protect when they protected
[03:16:26.520 --> 03:16:31.480]  you know abdeslam the paris massacre he was involved in the paris massacre
[03:16:31.480 --> 03:16:33.960]  they're talking about somebody's particular brand of islam one of the
[03:16:33.960 --> 03:16:36.840]  callers that we had during one of the debates said look i'm muslim and i
[03:16:36.840 --> 03:16:42.040]  support donald trump because i'm concerned about some of the
[03:16:42.040 --> 03:16:46.600]  sex of islam that are coming in because islam is not a monolithic thing you've
[03:16:46.600 --> 03:16:49.080]  got the wahhabis that he was concerned about that were
[03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:53.240]  our closest allies saudi arabia and really
[03:16:53.240 --> 03:16:58.280]  one of the most if not the most violent parts of islam he was concerned
[03:16:58.280 --> 03:17:01.800]  that there were going to be wahhabis coming in so he wanted
[03:17:01.800 --> 03:17:04.920]  some kind of vetting of the number of people that were coming in he didn't
[03:17:04.920 --> 03:17:07.960]  want the gates just opened up to allow masses of
[03:17:07.960 --> 03:17:11.000]  unvetted people to come in and that's what donald trump has been talking about
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:14.680]  it's portrayed and spawned by the media to say he's against all muslims and
[03:17:14.680 --> 03:17:17.640]  that's not what he's saying and that's not what the muslims are saying they're
[03:17:17.640 --> 03:17:20.840]  saying we want to know who is coming in and making
[03:17:20.840 --> 03:17:25.960]  sure that this isn't what's happening well yeah the voices of reform within
[03:17:25.960 --> 03:17:29.720]  islam always get intimidated and drowned out i mean you can look at
[03:17:29.720 --> 03:17:34.120]  a majid noas and and people like that they're trying to reform islam from the
[03:17:34.120 --> 03:17:37.800]  inside they're getting drowned out by islamists and then back to the point
[03:17:37.800 --> 03:17:41.400]  about ghettos if you look at the statistics i mean it's
[03:17:41.400 --> 03:17:45.080]  absolutely shocking you can look at belgium for example which
[03:17:45.080 --> 03:17:49.320]  has a muslim population of around six percent the prison
[03:17:49.320 --> 03:17:54.520]  population of belgium given that its muslim population is just six percent
[03:17:54.520 --> 03:17:59.720]  is 45 percent muslim so they're grossly over represented
[03:17:59.720 --> 03:18:03.400]  because again they get sucked into these hopeless ghettos they commit petty
[03:18:03.400 --> 03:18:06.200]  crimes but it gets worse you can look at france
[03:18:06.200 --> 03:18:12.040]  six to ten percent muslim population muslims make up 70 percent of prisoners
[03:18:12.040 --> 03:18:16.200]  in france same stats for spain muslim
[03:18:16.200 --> 03:18:20.520]  population 3.7 percent yeah the prison population of
[03:18:20.520 --> 03:18:27.000]  spain is 70 that's 70 not 17 70 percent muslim
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:31.400]  so obviously this isn't working right they're creating these ghettos they're
[03:18:31.400 --> 03:18:35.400]  sucked into this hopeless life they're committing petty crime
[03:18:35.400 --> 03:18:39.880]  because they're not being assimilated yet we still have this ludicrous open
[03:18:39.880 --> 03:18:43.240]  border policy by european leaders they've now
[03:18:43.240 --> 03:18:46.600]  said they're going to double down on it and it's clearly
[03:18:46.600 --> 03:18:50.680]  failed it's failed in terms of you know social cohesion
[03:18:50.680 --> 03:18:54.440]  it's failed in terms of putting europe's security at risk
[03:18:54.440 --> 03:18:57.960]  all of these individuals involved in paris and brussels
[03:18:57.960 --> 03:19:02.680]  either they were supposedly assimilated or they came in as refugees so either way
[03:19:02.680 --> 03:19:06.760]  you look at it it's just not working and it's it's the big threat
[03:19:06.760 --> 03:19:11.000]  yeah when we look at the political parties throughout europe that have
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:15.000]  risen up to try to take back their sovereignty from the european union of
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:18.600]  course we have the brexit that's coming up whether or not they're going to uh
[03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:21.480]  whether or not britain is going to exit the eu
[03:19:21.480 --> 03:19:25.480]  i'm curious as to what your take is on that paul how do you see that playing
[03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:29.320]  out do you think that that's going to prevail it's it's uh coming up pretty
[03:19:29.320 --> 03:19:33.240]  soon isn't it it's coming up in june
[03:19:33.240 --> 03:19:36.920]  i think if it if it looks like the lead vote is going to win they'll probably
[03:19:36.920 --> 03:19:39.400]  try and pull some shenanigans because that would
[03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:44.680]  deal such a massive blow to this multi-decade project which started way
[03:19:44.680 --> 03:19:48.040]  back in the fifties with the bilderberg group of course
[03:19:48.040 --> 03:19:52.680]  they planned the single currency which only came into fruition in the nineties
[03:19:52.680 --> 03:19:55.320]  say with us we gotta take a quick break i want to know what you have to say about
[03:19:55.320 --> 03:19:59.800]  the the brexit it's all part of the globalist consolidation we'll be right

[03:25:09.560 --> 03:25:13.640]  Paul we were talking before we went to the break about the brexit and of course
[03:25:13.640 --> 03:25:17.000]  and i'm curious with all the the parties that are
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:20.600]  picking up in popularity there because they're opposing the open borders
[03:25:20.600 --> 03:25:23.960]  here what we're seeing with donald trump that i think is so valuable
[03:25:23.960 --> 03:25:28.040]  is he's the only candidate that's here in america that is opposing not only the
[03:25:28.040 --> 03:25:31.080]  trade treaties and the open borders but also
[03:25:31.080 --> 03:25:34.360]  the climate treaties are there any political parties
[03:25:34.360 --> 03:25:38.600]  in europe or the uk that are talking about open borders because again that
[03:25:38.600 --> 03:25:42.680]  directly attacks our sovereignty but they also do these economic
[03:25:42.680 --> 03:25:46.360]  moves with these treaties and that's a a
[03:25:46.360 --> 03:25:51.320]  predecessor to coming in and having a a political consolidation and they use
[03:25:51.320 --> 03:25:54.920]  an economic crisis as they've talked about possibly doing
[03:25:54.920 --> 03:25:58.200]  some kind of a move just before the brexit vote
[03:25:58.200 --> 03:26:02.520]  that was leaked by wiki leaks some private correspondents there that was
[03:26:02.520 --> 03:26:05.800]  going on between the imf and some people in greece
[03:26:05.800 --> 03:26:09.400]  threatening them with an event and talking about how they might want to do
[03:26:09.400 --> 03:26:12.280]  that just before britain decides whether or not it's going to leave the EU so we
[03:26:12.280 --> 03:26:15.320]  have these economic treaties that bring things together we have the open
[03:26:15.320 --> 03:26:18.360]  borders that directly affect our sovereignty but then they use the
[03:26:18.360 --> 03:26:22.920]  economic issues this climb these climate treaties and these trade treaties to
[03:26:22.920 --> 03:26:26.680]  also attack our sovereignty is there anybody in the UK
[03:26:26.680 --> 03:26:32.360]  or in europe that is opposed to all three of these tactics
[03:26:32.360 --> 03:26:35.400]  yeah there are several parties i mean for the past two years they've been
[03:26:35.400 --> 03:26:39.000]  having great success there was a party in Germany recently that had a lot of
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:42.920]  success sweden and danmark as well of course
[03:26:42.920 --> 03:26:46.840]  as a ukip in the united kingdom but as he said
[03:26:46.840 --> 03:26:50.200]  the migrant crisis was a kind of reaction to that we had these
[03:26:50.200 --> 03:26:55.320]  conservative political parties sweeping to victories a couple of years ago the
[03:26:55.320 --> 03:26:58.680]  reaction to that was to bring in all these
[03:26:58.680 --> 03:27:02.440]  millions of people now it's up to over a million just in germany alone
[03:27:02.440 --> 03:27:06.440]  who will become dependent on government and they will vote for bigger
[03:27:06.440 --> 03:27:10.280]  government that's the point about this every time you poll
[03:27:10.280 --> 03:27:13.160]  people from these areas of the world and you ask them
[03:27:13.160 --> 03:27:15.960]  do you support smaller or bigger government
[03:27:15.960 --> 03:27:19.800]  always the vast majority say they support bigger government because
[03:27:19.800 --> 03:27:23.000]  they're quite poor and they want to vote for more welfare
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:26.520]  so that's why big government has an incentive
[03:27:26.520 --> 03:27:30.360]  to bring them into the country then of course you've got this
[03:27:30.360 --> 03:27:35.160]  narrative which we have in germany which is oh the german population is dying we
[03:27:35.160 --> 03:27:38.840]  need immigrants to act as cheap labor otherwise the
[03:27:38.840 --> 03:27:42.920]  economy is going to grind to a halt it's just absolute BS
[03:27:42.920 --> 03:27:46.680]  i mean you can look at germany and you can look at sweden for example
[03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:50.760]  where 58 percent of the welfare payments in sweden
[03:27:50.760 --> 03:27:54.520]  go to immigrants again given that immigrants are still
[03:27:54.520 --> 03:27:58.040]  a relatively small number in the population
[03:27:58.040 --> 03:28:01.320]  58 percent of welfare payments are going to immigrants
[03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:04.920]  so they're not doing the jobs that other people don't want to do
[03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:09.240]  48 percent of immigrants in sweden of working age
[03:28:09.240 --> 03:28:14.200]  don't work so this argument that you need to bring in these millions of people
[03:28:14.200 --> 03:28:18.200]  to do cheap labor just doesn't stand up to the test because they're not
[03:28:18.200 --> 03:28:22.360]  doing labor they're sucking off the state and then they vote
[03:28:22.360 --> 03:28:26.360]  for more state for bigger government which is why the government wants to
[03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:28.920]  bring them in that's the whole agenda behind this
[03:28:28.920 --> 03:28:31.400]  it's kind of funny because you know they're looking at this and saying hey
[03:28:31.400 --> 03:28:34.120]  we've got this population demographics issue
[03:28:34.120 --> 03:28:38.040]  you people want to retire we've got a kind of a social security system
[03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:41.560]  a social net here but there's not enough people to support you so we've got to
[03:28:41.560 --> 03:28:44.280]  bring in these populations and you know paul i'm reminded
[03:28:44.280 --> 03:28:48.680]  that it was germany and it was a bismarck who created the first
[03:28:48.680 --> 03:28:52.840]  social security template he picked the age of 65
[03:28:52.840 --> 03:28:55.880]  because that was the life expectancy of the german people
[03:28:55.880 --> 03:29:00.680]  it has always been a lie and so now they and they keep moving that age as
[03:29:00.680 --> 03:29:03.640]  life expectancy goes up they say hey we got a solvency issue because
[03:29:03.640 --> 03:29:07.080]  we never really expected to pay people any any benefits here now that they're
[03:29:07.080 --> 03:29:10.040]  living longer we got to change that age of withdrawal
[03:29:10.040 --> 03:29:13.400]  but now they've got a new lie and they're going to take care of you by
[03:29:13.400 --> 03:29:17.480]  importing people who have absolutely no connection to you to your culture to
[03:29:17.480 --> 03:29:20.600]  your language to your country and of course they're going to pay
[03:29:20.600 --> 03:29:25.080]  heavy taxes to support your retirement what a lie
[03:29:25.080 --> 03:29:28.680]  well say with us we're going to come back with paul joseph watson and

[03:32:18.600 --> 03:32:22.520]  is paramount and there's still so much new information coming out that we
[03:32:22.520 --> 03:32:26.680]  simply can't even keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine
[03:32:26.680 --> 03:32:31.320]  we drill down more than 7 000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to

[03:32:50.040 --> 03:32:53.000]  to come up with anything even close to what we have

[03:33:08.280 --> 03:33:13.880]  alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:33:13.880 --> 03:33:19.640]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and here in austin with me
[03:33:19.640 --> 03:33:23.400]  is joe biggs and we've got paul joseph watching on the line from the uk
[03:33:23.400 --> 03:33:27.400]  joe is here to talk about a new story that we have up about a
[03:33:27.400 --> 03:33:31.560]  new sesame street character this is a hijab clad muppet
[03:33:31.560 --> 03:33:36.600]  zari a feminist from afghanistan you know i i guess joe when i look at this i
[03:33:36.600 --> 03:33:39.960]  think an islamic feminist is something of an oxymoron
[03:33:39.960 --> 03:33:44.280]  that's the i mean look i've been to afghanistan i i've seen firsthand how
[03:33:44.280 --> 03:33:46.920]  they treat women how they treat these children
[03:33:46.920 --> 03:33:50.760]  is completely and totally ridiculous i'm all for empowering women
[03:33:50.760 --> 03:33:53.800]  over in the middle east that's great but first you have to change their
[03:33:53.800 --> 03:33:57.800]  ideologies they need to come into 2016 if you
[03:33:57.800 --> 03:34:03.400]  teach a young generation of afghani females to empower themselves to stand
[03:34:03.400 --> 03:34:06.280]  up to these men there's going to be mass
[03:34:06.280 --> 03:34:09.400]  mutilations there's going to be mass killings they don't play games around
[03:34:09.400 --> 03:34:12.520]  there you have to first change this radical islamic
[03:34:12.520 --> 03:34:17.560]  ideology and then you can bring in some of this female empowerment but i think
[03:34:17.560 --> 03:34:20.520]  this is ridiculous the sesame street going to be held accountable
[03:34:20.520 --> 03:34:23.640]  when these young girls grow up and they start back talking to these guys
[03:34:23.640 --> 03:34:27.560]  i'm not saying that's right but this is reality this is what's going to happen
[03:34:27.560 --> 03:34:30.360]  i've been to afghanistan i've been to iraq i've been into
[03:34:30.360 --> 03:34:34.840]  other countries i can't name because not officially there but
[03:34:34.840 --> 03:34:38.360]  this is something that will happen and then you look at this right here there's
[03:34:38.360 --> 03:34:42.520]  a new law there are muslims fighting for the right to kill their wives
[03:34:42.520 --> 03:34:45.800]  what if that passes and then you have this group of women growing up
[03:34:45.800 --> 03:34:49.400]  becoming adults thinking that they can go off take this off empower themselves
[03:34:49.400 --> 03:34:53.560]  remove the hijab that's not going to be good and then
[03:34:53.560 --> 03:34:56.360]  when is that going to happen when is this character going to get leaked into
[03:34:56.360 --> 03:35:00.200]  the american version of sesame street they're saying right now this is only
[03:35:00.200 --> 03:35:03.160]  going to be in afghanistan which is already dangerous enough
[03:35:03.160 --> 03:35:06.600]  then you bring that over here what's going to happen then oh yeah i think it's
[03:35:06.600 --> 03:35:09.400]  not going to be very long before they introduce it into the very the american
[03:35:09.400 --> 03:35:13.880]  version of sesame street uh paul your comments on that
[03:35:13.880 --> 03:35:17.480]  well joe mentioned the article and it's out of the new york post there are
[03:35:17.480 --> 03:35:20.200]  muslim men fighting for the right to kill their wives
[03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:23.400]  they're actually having to pass a law in pakistan
[03:35:23.400 --> 03:35:28.440]  which says that it's not your right within your own private home
[03:35:28.440 --> 03:35:33.400]  to physically abuse and kill your wife in an honor killing they're actually
[03:35:33.400 --> 03:35:36.760]  having to pass a law in pakistan to ban that
[03:35:36.760 --> 03:35:42.200]  and there's this huge campaign against it by these islamists again and if you
[03:35:42.200 --> 03:35:45.560]  read the article it states they've deemed the bill
[03:35:45.560 --> 03:35:48.840]  unislamic contradictory to the verses of the
[03:35:48.840 --> 03:35:52.840]  quran and an attempt to secularize or westernize pakistan
[03:35:52.840 --> 03:35:57.080]  so again they cite the quran in justifying their quote
[03:35:57.080 --> 03:36:02.360]  right to physically abuse and kill their own family members because we know
[03:36:02.360 --> 03:36:04.840]  this happens over and over again you know
[03:36:04.840 --> 03:36:08.760]  girls who marry somebody who they actually want to marry
[03:36:08.760 --> 03:36:13.960]  god forbid that's a shame on the family because it's not an arranged marriage
[03:36:13.960 --> 03:36:18.040]  and fathers in many cases have killed and attempted to kill their own daughters
[03:36:18.040 --> 03:36:21.800]  this is a massive problem in fact there was a girl in pakistan who was
[03:36:21.800 --> 03:36:26.360]  shot in the head by her own father dumped in a river
[03:36:26.360 --> 03:36:30.520]  because again she tried to marry somebody who she actually fell in love with
[03:36:30.520 --> 03:36:34.440]  i mean the horror well think about this they the u.s surge operation to clear
[03:36:34.440 --> 03:36:37.560]  10 000 syrian refugees in just three months this is a
[03:36:37.560 --> 03:36:41.000]  article by washington examiner you're gonna you're talking about bringing
[03:36:41.000 --> 03:36:44.920]  these people with these ideologies that treat women this way that rape them that
[03:36:44.920 --> 03:36:48.200]  want to murder them that throw acid in their face you want to bring
[03:36:48.200 --> 03:36:51.560]  these people unvetted into this country what's going to happen
[03:36:51.560 --> 03:36:55.160]  how many social justice warriors are going to stand up
[03:36:55.160 --> 03:36:59.080]  when they're being attacked and beaten it's happening in europe
[03:36:59.080 --> 03:37:01.800]  but it's going to happen here and we're going to let it go because your
[03:37:01.800 --> 03:37:05.640]  government is allowing it to happen it's completely ridiculous and as paul was
[03:37:05.640 --> 03:37:08.280]  just saying if they're gonna sit there and go thank you thank you for it throw
[03:37:08.280 --> 03:37:11.800]  more acid on my face you know it's sick if they have a culture if they have a
[03:37:11.800 --> 03:37:15.640]  religion that supports this activity the laws or the sesame
[03:37:15.640 --> 03:37:20.040]  street programs really aren't going to change that
[03:37:20.040 --> 03:37:25.320]  paul your comment yeah i mean the the hijab is worn by women in many middle
[03:37:25.320 --> 03:37:29.400]  eastern countries because if they didn't wear it they would get acid
[03:37:29.400 --> 03:37:32.040]  attacked they would get raped i mean that's one of the
[03:37:32.040 --> 03:37:36.680]  justifications that migrants in europe use for raping women they say well
[03:37:36.680 --> 03:37:39.880]  she wasn't wearing a hijab she wasn't wearing a burqa
[03:37:39.880 --> 03:37:44.760]  she deserves it so it's not a choice they make it's not some feminist female
[03:37:44.760 --> 03:37:48.120]  empowerment thing it's something that's forced upon them
[03:37:48.120 --> 03:37:52.200]  otherwise they leave themselves open to be sexually abused and attacked so
[03:37:52.200 --> 03:37:55.880]  again complete disconnection with the sesame street thing it's not about
[03:37:55.880 --> 03:37:59.880]  female empowerment south by southwest the the music festival that was here
[03:37:59.880 --> 03:38:03.240]  i had uh some friends of mine that live in uh london they were here was a
[03:38:03.240 --> 03:38:05.480]  husband and wife and uh they were talking about their
[03:38:05.480 --> 03:38:10.120]  experience when they went to the ua the uh uh over a guitar and all that stuff
[03:38:10.120 --> 03:38:13.240]  and how when they went there the wife was like you know what i'm gonna you know
[03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:16.840]  kind of abide by their culture i'm gonna cover up dress really conservative
[03:38:16.840 --> 03:38:20.440]  because i don't want to be offensive to their culture then that she goes back
[03:38:20.440 --> 03:38:25.320]  into london and she's wearing her natural clothes that she would wear out
[03:38:25.320 --> 03:38:29.080]  you know address high hills and these muslim men are spitting at her calling
[03:38:29.080 --> 03:38:32.840]  her names and things like that attacking her in her own land because i don't
[03:38:32.840 --> 03:38:35.800]  respect her culture yeah yeah he respects their culture tries to
[03:38:35.800 --> 03:38:40.520]  play by uh their rules by their customs but then they uh come to her culture
[03:38:40.520 --> 03:38:43.800]  and are going to try to to force her to to conform
[03:38:43.800 --> 03:38:47.080]  yeah and they're already talking about housing these refugees on military
[03:38:47.080 --> 03:38:50.680]  bases we've already done that with these immigrants coming in from
[03:38:50.680 --> 03:38:54.040]  mexico and central america at lackland air force base where the shooting was
[03:38:54.040 --> 03:38:56.760]  today you know it's out of control and they're
[03:38:56.760 --> 03:39:00.360]  wanting to bring in tons and tons without vetting them
[03:39:00.360 --> 03:39:03.640]  well and of course the issue and we all three understand that our listeners
[03:39:03.640 --> 03:39:07.160]  understand it it is not incompetence it is not that they don't understand what's
[03:39:07.160 --> 03:39:11.720]  going on this this is by design exactly this is actually bar is part of the
[03:39:11.720 --> 03:39:16.120]  globalist agenda to try to to create chaos within these
[03:39:16.120 --> 03:39:19.320]  countries they don't want to have a simulation that's why they bring them
[03:39:19.320 --> 03:39:22.200]  in in such large numbers as paul was talking about the
[03:39:22.200 --> 03:39:26.120]  self ghettoizing that happens with that but it's also the trade treaties the
[03:39:26.120 --> 03:39:29.480]  climate treaties uh this is all part of the takedown of the
[03:39:29.480 --> 03:39:34.520]  west as well as establishing an economic control that is outside
[03:39:34.520 --> 03:39:39.640]  of the national sovereignty of the existing countries exactly uh you know
[03:39:39.640 --> 03:39:41.880]  one of the things that i thought was interesting that we saw here and i don't
[03:39:41.880 --> 03:39:45.160]  know if you guys saw this or not it's it's kind of off the side here but we're
[03:39:45.160 --> 03:39:48.040]  talking about you mentioning the the military everything this
[03:39:48.040 --> 03:39:52.120]  the u.s. military has christened a self-driving
[03:39:52.120 --> 03:39:56.440]  seahunter warship and as they report this in Reuters they say
[03:39:56.440 --> 03:40:00.600]  it's the naval equivalent of google's self-driving car
[03:40:00.600 --> 03:40:04.680]  it's i'm kind of wondering if this warship is going to drive into if they
[03:40:04.680 --> 03:40:07.800]  programmed it to drive into a bus or it's going to turn into a bus or whatever
[03:40:07.800 --> 03:40:11.640]  you know we looked at this 360 million dollar stealth warship
[03:40:11.640 --> 03:40:16.040]  that they released a couple months ago went about 50 miles and broke down and
[03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:19.960]  had to be towed back we're getting to the point where
[03:40:19.960 --> 03:40:24.680]  nothing that our government is doing is working to uh you know they tell us
[03:40:24.680 --> 03:40:27.320]  they're there to keep us safe that's the whole justification
[03:40:27.320 --> 03:40:32.680]  security safety and yet it is just open corruption the driverless cars have
[03:40:32.680 --> 03:40:36.040]  already had 84 wrecks 84 yeah i've only had one in my
[03:40:36.040 --> 03:40:39.480]  entire life and i wasn't the the cause of it you know what's gonna happen when
[03:40:39.480 --> 03:40:42.840]  this you know driverless boat warship
[03:40:42.840 --> 03:40:46.920]  accidentally creeps into iranian waters or something and launches a missile
[03:40:46.920 --> 03:40:49.560]  they're going to go whoa that's not our fault sorry guys
[03:40:49.560 --> 03:40:53.480]  we didn't mean to start this war you know it really does allow them
[03:40:53.480 --> 03:40:56.280]  and it does it gives them plausible deniability so i mean you want to talk
[03:40:56.280 --> 03:40:59.400]  about a false flag to be very easy to do that but i mean we look at something
[03:40:59.400 --> 03:41:03.160]  like this we have not solved this problem we just had a situation in
[03:41:03.160 --> 03:41:08.200]  pennsylvania where you had a a tragedy on a railroad track
[03:41:08.200 --> 03:41:12.360]  okay on a railroad track and now here they're going to put a warship
[03:41:12.360 --> 03:41:15.880]  that is self-driving out at sea and they can't even
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:20.680]  get their their their manned ship that they spent 360 million dollars on an
[03:41:20.680 --> 03:41:22.840]  airplane when it goes out in the ocean what the hell they're gonna do when
[03:41:22.840 --> 03:41:27.560]  that thing's going yeah absolutely absolutely so uh yeah it
[03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:30.840]  it's really crazy i don't see anything bad happening with this at all
[03:41:30.840 --> 03:41:34.280]  yeah yeah there's a lot that's going to go wrong because look at this story too
[03:41:34.280 --> 03:41:37.880]  as well when we're talking about the uh the technology that's failing robot
[03:41:37.880 --> 03:41:42.520]  waiters were fired after spilling drinks and food during restaurant service so
[03:41:42.520 --> 03:41:46.120]  you can't get your ship that you spent 360 million dollars on to go further
[03:41:46.120 --> 03:41:49.720]  than 50 miles you can't get robot waiters to serve
[03:41:49.720 --> 03:41:53.320]  food without spilling it all over the customers but you're going to
[03:41:53.320 --> 03:41:57.800]  release a an autonomous warship and that's the thing that so many people are
[03:41:57.800 --> 03:42:01.960]  concerned about of course there's a movement in europe to try to
[03:42:01.960 --> 03:42:05.720]  to block this to try to get some kind of uh sense to people to get the public to
[03:42:05.720 --> 03:42:09.800]  wake up as well paul we've got we've talked many times to dr noel scharke
[03:42:09.800 --> 03:42:13.480]  who has warned us about the the desire to create
[03:42:13.480 --> 03:42:17.320]  autonomous killing machines and i mean this uh this is the first time i've
[03:42:17.320 --> 03:42:20.920]  seen it in terms of a warship usually we're we're thinking about
[03:42:20.920 --> 03:42:25.320]  swarms of drones that are operating or you know something like that but
[03:42:25.320 --> 03:42:29.160]  these warships that they're already unleashing
[03:42:29.160 --> 03:42:32.600]  yeah of course the big thing with driverless cars is that they're gonna
[03:42:32.600 --> 03:42:37.240]  give the computer the moral agency to decide who it kills
[03:42:37.240 --> 03:42:40.440]  so if you're if you're driving if you're in a driverless car you're going down
[03:42:40.440 --> 03:42:44.520]  the highway you're gonna have a wreck and there's a chance that you could die or
[03:42:44.520 --> 03:42:48.440]  that some child you know that's just crossing the road could die
[03:42:48.440 --> 03:42:52.520]  it's gonna choose to kill you yeah now in certain situations of course
[03:42:52.520 --> 03:42:56.840]  you could avoid both tragedies but that computer is going to make a split second
[03:42:56.840 --> 03:43:00.040]  decision to kill you that's the problem
[03:43:00.040 --> 03:43:03.400]  also a problem is the fact now we know that the government is going to
[03:43:03.400 --> 03:43:06.840]  regulate this where they decide whether you can get in this
[03:43:06.840 --> 03:43:10.680]  driverless car in the first place it's about control of mobility it's not
[03:43:10.680 --> 03:43:15.320]  about giving people freedom it's about increased control yeah
[03:43:15.320 --> 03:43:19.080]  countries increased control and tracking that's the key thing because
[03:43:19.080 --> 03:43:22.120]  we're going to have the united states i don't know how this is progressing
[03:43:22.120 --> 03:43:25.720]  in the uk but they are accelerating this in america
[03:43:25.720 --> 03:43:29.640]  and they're going to have vehicle to vehicle black boxes mandated for the
[03:43:29.640 --> 03:43:33.080]  cars and they're going to be releasing that legislation we're told the rules
[03:43:33.080 --> 03:43:35.400]  actually it's not going to be legislation because we don't pass laws
[03:43:35.400 --> 03:43:38.360]  anymore in the congress we simply turn the power over to these
[03:43:38.360 --> 03:43:42.040]  bureaucracies who then tell us what the new laws are going to be calling them
[03:43:42.040 --> 03:43:45.320]  regulations but the the regulations that are going
[03:43:45.320 --> 03:43:49.320]  to be coming out in the fall are going to mandate these vehicle to vehicle
[03:43:49.320 --> 03:43:51.800]  communications and there's going to be a black box you're
[03:43:51.800 --> 03:43:54.760]  going to have to buy in your car but it's also going to talk to the
[03:43:54.760 --> 03:43:57.800]  infrastructure they have vehicle to infrastructure communication
[03:43:57.800 --> 03:44:01.080]  and that's going to be used to track you it's going to be used to
[03:44:01.080 --> 03:44:05.000]  tax you it's going to be used to change your insurance plans so that they can
[03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:07.960]  get you out of the car you won't be able to afford to drive a car
[03:44:07.960 --> 03:44:11.720]  excuse me mr johnson we've just been notified that you are late on child
[03:44:11.720 --> 03:44:14.200]  support we will be shutting down the vehicle locking the doors and
[03:44:14.200 --> 03:44:17.320]  notifying law enforcement enjoy your day
[03:44:17.320 --> 03:44:19.960]  or maybe they didn't like that facebook post and they're just going to lock the
[03:44:19.960 --> 03:44:23.160]  door and drive you to a uh off the cliff
[03:44:23.160 --> 03:44:27.720]  exactly yeah we know that we know that's already happening in china
[03:44:27.720 --> 03:44:31.880]  remember the the social credit score that they had where if people had
[03:44:31.880 --> 03:44:35.000]  criticized the government or if they were purchasing things that were a
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:39.000]  little bit suspicious they would lose their social credit score it would go
[03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:42.280]  down and that would then impact their friends
[03:44:42.280 --> 03:44:46.440]  so they bring peer pressure into it so you know if you're not a well-behaved
[03:44:46.440 --> 03:44:49.240]  citizen maybe you're not going to be allowed to get in the car in the first
[03:44:49.240 --> 03:44:51.640]  place yeah and of course we had those articles at
[03:44:51.640 --> 03:44:54.440]  beginning of the week where they were reviving this system where they're going
[03:44:54.440 --> 03:44:57.960]  to have police boosts every few blocks
[03:44:57.960 --> 03:45:01.800]  throughout china where they're going to have actually a very crude form of
[03:45:01.800 --> 03:45:05.240]  surveillance where they're going to have humans
[03:45:05.240 --> 03:45:08.520]  knowing everybody that's in their neighborhood coming to a modern city
[03:45:08.520 --> 03:45:12.280]  like guangzhou which is one of the most modern cities in mainland china
[03:45:12.280 --> 03:45:14.760]  they're bragging about how the fact that they're going to put these people in
[03:45:14.760 --> 03:45:18.040]  there within a couple of months they're going to know who the families are but
[03:45:18.040 --> 03:45:21.640]  then they're going to know within about six months everything about all the
[03:45:21.640 --> 03:45:25.720]  individuals in all of the families and they are jumping on this
[03:45:25.720 --> 03:45:30.200]  self-driving car even more so than the american government because they're
[03:45:30.200 --> 03:45:33.800]  all about control but what this is all about it creates a lot of
[03:45:33.800 --> 03:45:37.480]  safety issues and just as we're looking at these military things you've got
[03:45:37.480 --> 03:45:40.280]  situations where these autonomous killing machines can go
[03:45:40.280 --> 03:45:44.920]  crazy either with an error or with a false flag attack but it can also you
[03:45:44.920 --> 03:45:47.800]  know start wars as you just mentioned but when we look at it from the
[03:45:47.800 --> 03:45:51.080]  transportation standpoint when a government wants to control a
[03:45:51.080 --> 03:45:54.280]  population what do they do they control the movements one of
[03:45:54.280 --> 03:45:57.640]  the first things military is going to do is get control of transportation
[03:45:57.640 --> 03:46:00.680]  methods and so that's one of the things that they're doing
[03:46:00.680 --> 03:46:04.200]  and enacting this control grid and i think americans don't really realize how
[03:46:04.200 --> 03:46:06.840]  dangerous this is going to be you know i was just in philly they are
[03:46:06.840 --> 03:46:10.840]  building the city up they're going higher they're not going out
[03:46:10.840 --> 03:46:14.360]  and you have these massive blm grabs where they're taking all this land
[03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:17.160]  that's the gender 21 exactly they're taking the land they're pushing you in
[03:46:17.160 --> 03:46:20.520]  the cities building the cities as high up as they can put you putting in these
[03:46:20.520 --> 03:46:23.480]  tiny little rooms where they can control you then you put they put you in this
[03:46:23.480 --> 03:46:27.480]  driverless car where they control you and watch you and listen to you there's
[03:46:27.480 --> 03:46:31.240]  already that uh the new corvette has a thing called valet mode
[03:46:31.240 --> 03:46:34.600]  yeah that regardless if your car is on or off it is always listening and
[03:46:34.600 --> 03:46:38.680]  recording your conversations and of course in the uk paul you've got um i
[03:46:38.680 --> 03:46:41.160]  think we just lost paul there but of course in the uk
[03:46:41.160 --> 03:46:44.840]  they have the uh same issues that we have here where they're trying to sell
[03:46:44.840 --> 03:46:48.520]  all these micro apartments that are 200 square feet
[03:46:48.520 --> 03:46:52.680]  100 square feet that are extremely expensive selling that as the
[03:46:52.680 --> 03:46:56.440]  newest latest trendiest thing yes i get an acute smart
[03:46:56.440 --> 03:46:59.320]  storage unit or something like that down the street and go hey look at my new
[03:46:59.320 --> 03:47:02.200]  trendy apartment it's five by five foot it's amazing
[03:47:02.200 --> 03:47:05.720]  yeah yeah and that's why you know when we look at what's happening
[03:47:05.720 --> 03:47:09.800]  so many people who are in the cities who are in the suburbs
[03:47:09.800 --> 03:47:13.400]  when these stories that we have covered uh in oregon and nevada
[03:47:13.400 --> 03:47:16.280]  other places like that where the ranchers the farmers the loggers the
[03:47:16.280 --> 03:47:20.280]  miners who've had property rights that are genuine property
[03:47:20.280 --> 03:47:24.760]  rights just as much as the home that you have in the suburbs these are
[03:47:24.760 --> 03:47:27.480]  property rights that they have passed on many cases
[03:47:27.480 --> 03:47:30.760]  far longer than anybody in your family has had a house in the suburbs they've
[03:47:30.760 --> 03:47:33.720]  had these uh logging or mineral rights they've
[03:47:33.720 --> 03:47:38.920]  had for maybe 150 160 years and the government is coming in and
[03:47:38.920 --> 03:47:43.480]  taking those away from these people who are doing productive things for our
[03:47:43.480 --> 03:47:46.600]  our society people in the suburbs people in the
[03:47:46.600 --> 03:47:50.200]  cities don't realize that they're next on the list
[03:47:50.200 --> 03:47:53.480]  they can take somebody's property rights that are
[03:47:53.480 --> 03:47:56.840]  surface grazing rights or logging rights they can come in and they can take
[03:47:56.840 --> 03:48:00.760]  the rights to your home and they can force you into a city situation they
[03:48:00.760 --> 03:48:04.040]  can force you into a controlled transportation 2008
[03:48:04.040 --> 03:48:08.200]  yeah absolutely absolutely that's what we're seeing i think we lost uh
[03:48:08.200 --> 03:48:12.680]  we lost paul we're gonna try to establish contact with paul
[03:48:12.680 --> 03:48:16.280]  in just a moment but again when we look at
[03:48:16.280 --> 03:48:23.240]  what's happening in this country uh and it's not just sesame street we're also
[03:48:23.240 --> 03:48:26.680]  seeing the way the agendas are being set up with
[03:48:26.680 --> 03:48:31.240]  the movies as i was talking about yesterday the cia even having
[03:48:31.240 --> 03:48:36.760]  episodes of a cooking show that they're involved okay it's not just things like
[03:48:36.760 --> 03:48:40.520]  a zero dark 30 that they're doing it's a complete
[03:48:40.520 --> 03:48:45.400]  full spectrum control of the media uh going back to uh
[03:48:45.400 --> 03:48:49.240]  going back to the beginning of the cold war uh paul's back with us paul your
[03:48:49.240 --> 03:48:52.440]  comments i missed what you talked about sorry
[03:48:52.440 --> 03:48:55.800]  can you recap well we were just talking about the
[03:48:55.800 --> 03:49:00.280]  we were talking about agenda 21 and how the uh you know we're going back to the
[03:49:00.280 --> 03:49:04.120]  sesame street situation that we've got it's not just sesame
[03:49:04.120 --> 03:49:08.840]  street but it is everything that the media is doing in terms of the movies
[03:49:08.840 --> 03:49:12.040]  that are coming out it just had a story yesterday where we had the cia
[03:49:12.040 --> 03:49:16.040]  involved even in a cooking show here in the united states it's not
[03:49:16.040 --> 03:49:18.840]  just the high profile movies that are pretty obvious
[03:49:18.840 --> 03:49:22.440]  it's not just sesame street where they're coming in uh and and doing this in
[03:49:22.440 --> 03:49:25.640]  afghanistan will probably bring this character into the united states
[03:49:25.640 --> 03:49:30.040]  but it's even in subtle ways like cooking shows it's it's full spectrum
[03:49:30.040 --> 03:49:34.680]  dominance when they're trying to manipulate and control society
[03:49:34.680 --> 03:49:38.440]  well and that's because they know that young people you know millenials growing
[03:49:38.440 --> 03:49:42.680]  up in their early 20s now don't watch the news anymore they watch
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:46.120]  entertainment programs if that you know now they're all on
[03:49:46.120 --> 03:49:50.200]  netflix so i guess we're going to see more propaganda placement in those kind of
[03:49:50.200 --> 03:49:53.880]  shows so yeah they they avoid doing it in the news
[03:49:53.880 --> 03:49:57.080]  because less and less people are watching it trust in mainstream media is at
[03:49:57.080 --> 03:50:00.760]  record lows so now they have to use the narratives of
[03:50:00.760 --> 03:50:04.040]  entertainment shows and the characters within those shows
[03:50:04.040 --> 03:50:07.240]  to get their brainwashing out because that's what the millenials are watching
[03:50:07.240 --> 03:50:10.840]  right now it's working very effectively when
[03:50:10.840 --> 03:50:13.960]  rob do and and my son were covering these protests
[03:50:13.960 --> 03:50:19.320]  out in wisconsin uh it was it was very very effective you saw most the people
[03:50:19.320 --> 03:50:22.840]  who were there as protesters most of people bought into this mindless
[03:50:22.840 --> 03:50:26.440]  privilege narrative that they've given people as well as a story that we have
[03:50:26.440 --> 03:50:30.120]  on our site today these social justice warriors
[03:50:30.120 --> 03:50:33.880]  crashing the students for trump meeting over and over again we're seeing
[03:50:33.880 --> 03:50:37.320]  just how effective this propaganda has become because it's not only
[03:50:37.320 --> 03:50:39.720]  entertainment but of course it's the educational system
[03:50:39.720 --> 03:50:42.840]  stay with us we're going to be right back with paul joseph watson and
[03:50:42.840 --> 03:50:49.800]  joe biggs
[03:50:49.800 --> 03:51:06.440]  it's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria viruses moles and fungus can
[03:51:06.440 --> 03:51:08.680]  inflict severe damage in the human body

[03:54:38.520 --> 03:54:41.720]  stories are saying that millions of people who are screen detected
[03:54:41.720 --> 03:54:45.480]  abnormal abnormalities are not cancer in the first place but even those which
[03:54:45.480 --> 03:54:49.240]  can be considered to be fast growing are often being driven into greater
[03:54:49.240 --> 03:54:52.360]  malignancy by the conventional chemotherapy radiation
[03:54:52.360 --> 03:54:55.960]  and surgery based standards of cancer care itself

[03:55:53.640 --> 03:55:57.240]  today we had a shooting at a military base in
[03:55:57.240 --> 03:56:00.920]  san Antonio and i want to play you a clip and get a reaction from Paul Joseph
[03:56:00.920 --> 03:56:05.080]  Watson and Joe Biggs to what the uh one of the officers on site said let's
[03:56:05.080 --> 03:56:07.720]  roll back. Secondly is on the larger camps installations of
[03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:11.080]  Fort Hood of Fort Bragg of Fort Lewis for example
[03:56:11.080 --> 03:56:15.560]  in terms of carrying privately owned weapons on military bases concealed
[03:56:15.560 --> 03:56:18.680]  privately owned weapons that is not authorized
[03:56:18.680 --> 03:56:23.320]  that is a dod policy i do not recommend that it be changed
[03:56:23.320 --> 03:56:27.080]  we have adequate law enforcement on those bases to respond
[03:56:27.080 --> 03:56:29.880]  you take the fort hood incident number two the one where i was the commander of
[03:56:29.880 --> 03:56:33.880]  third corps those police responded within eight minutes and that guy was dead
[03:56:33.880 --> 03:56:38.600]  so uh that's pretty quick uh and not quick enough people died in the process
[03:56:38.600 --> 03:56:41.880]  of that but that was a very fast evolving uh
[03:56:41.880 --> 03:56:46.200]  event and i am not convinced from what i know
[03:56:46.200 --> 03:56:49.240]  that carrying privately owned weapons would have stopped that individual wow
[03:56:49.240 --> 03:56:52.600]  i've been around guns all my life. Well let's go to Joe Biggs and Paul Joseph
[03:56:52.600 --> 03:56:55.880]  Watson he's saying that eight minutes is pretty quick is that pretty quick when
[03:56:55.880 --> 03:56:58.920]  somebody's got a loaded gun pointed at you i mean when you're in a situation
[03:56:58.920 --> 03:57:01.560]  like that that's like being in combat eight minutes is a lifetime yeah
[03:57:01.560 --> 03:57:05.000]  so much can happen in eight minutes a lot can happen
[03:57:05.000 --> 03:57:08.040]  death you know whether you're gonna live or not i mean it's completely and
[03:57:08.040 --> 03:57:10.440]  totally crazy we've only got a couple of minutes in this
[03:57:10.440 --> 03:57:13.320]  segment and it's not enough i mean i especially somebody was pointing a gun
[03:57:13.320 --> 03:57:16.520]  at my head i mean this happened today at Lackland Air Force base it's about an
[03:57:16.520 --> 03:57:20.680]  hour and 15 minutes south of us here in austin texas and uh basically the report
[03:57:20.680 --> 03:57:22.920]  is earlier this morning there was an active shooter
[03:57:22.920 --> 03:57:26.440]  come to find out it's an airman who went on base shot his commander then turned
[03:57:26.440 --> 03:57:29.960]  a gun on himself and killed himself apparently so that's what they're saying
[03:57:29.960 --> 03:57:33.960]  but look if somebody even with the laws how they are this kid could have just
[03:57:33.960 --> 03:57:37.400]  thrown out in the trunk of his car they only randomly screen and search certain
[03:57:37.400 --> 03:57:40.440]  vehicles just from time to time they do they have like a little uh
[03:57:40.440 --> 03:57:43.560]  like a number they do every day like you know every fifth car every tenth car
[03:57:43.560 --> 03:57:46.600]  or whatever or then they'll do one day they elevate the security level and
[03:57:46.600 --> 03:57:51.160]  they just search all of them you know that can easily you know be sent through
[03:57:51.160 --> 03:57:55.400]  if they have the same law and act so and of course if if they hadn't had that
[03:57:55.400 --> 03:57:58.440]  rule the person that he killed might have been able to defend himself
[03:57:58.440 --> 03:58:02.440]  exactly i mean we saw what happened in chattanooga you know at these uh
[03:58:02.440 --> 03:58:05.480]  recruiting centers it's completely and totally ridiculous real real quickly
[03:58:05.480 --> 03:58:09.640]  just a couple of seconds paul uh i know you're in a victim disarmament zone
[03:58:09.640 --> 03:58:14.120]  there in the uk your comments well i mean he's hailing the fact that it only
[03:58:14.120 --> 03:58:18.760]  took eight minutes with the four four hood shooting 13 people died yeah if you
[03:58:18.760 --> 03:58:22.680]  can't trust military personnel to carry guns on base then who can you trust
[03:58:22.680 --> 03:58:26.440]  exactly exactly these are the people that work for the government they're
[03:58:26.440 --> 03:58:29.720]  supposed to be keeping us safe and secure they can't be trusted to protect
[03:58:29.720 --> 03:58:33.480]  themselves join us tonight seven central apm eastern for the info wars nightly
