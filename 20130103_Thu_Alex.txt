[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20.720 --> 00:43.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the third day of the new year, 2013. And we are
[00:43.920 --> 00:48.040]  going to be here, Lord willing, for the next three hours. We do have Dr. Jerome Corsi joining
[00:48.040 --> 00:53.440]  us. They are going ahead with the North American Union NAPA superhighway program, despite telling
[00:53.440 --> 00:57.800]  the public that first it didn't exist, and then the legislature shot it down twice.
[00:57.800 --> 01:02.160]  It affects the entire nation, but begins down in Mexico through Texas up into Canada. They
[01:02.160 --> 01:06.920]  even have the whole highway planned out with the highway markers for all the way into Canada.
[01:06.920 --> 01:12.740]  But then when you talk about it, they say it doesn't exist. And that's part of the psychological
[01:12.740 --> 01:21.480]  warfare tactic they use in general. The legislation is introduced and is passed out of committee
[01:21.480 --> 01:28.840]  in Illinois to ban all semi-autos, even pump shotguns, pump rifles. I saw a comment on
[01:28.840 --> 01:29.840]  infowars.com.
[01:29.840 --> 01:34.340]  They said pump rifles. There's actually a lot of pump rifles. Now, the point is is that
[01:34.340 --> 01:42.960]  it's everything but bolt action. And the NRA, of course, is responding to it. And it looks
[01:42.960 --> 01:50.340]  like it's gonna pass very, very close today. And Obama is quoted as saying he wants to
[01:50.340 --> 01:54.660]  quickly go for immigration reform, totally open borders, end of America, just not even
[01:54.660 --> 01:56.400]  having a country.
[01:56.400 --> 02:03.720]  No other country lets you do that. It's globalism, it's New World Order, and gun control. So
[02:03.720 --> 02:13.080]  it's hammer down. And you notice that in mainline, quote, conservative circles, they're not even
[02:13.080 --> 02:17.420]  discussing this. They're talking about tax increases in the fiscal cliff, which is important,
[02:17.420 --> 02:19.880]  but the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[02:19.880 --> 02:24.540]  But this pales in significance. And I didn't even get to it yesterday, cuz it's so well
[02:24.540 --> 02:28.600]  known that Obama's one of the greatest liars in history. Just because we've gotten deeper
[02:28.600 --> 02:33.400]  into the corruption, he's just a puppet. But the system is lying through their mouthpiece
[02:33.400 --> 02:37.780]  where he said, I'll never raise your payroll taxes, I'll never raise this tax, that tax.
[02:37.780 --> 02:44.600]  They're raising payroll taxes, you name it, a whole bunch of new taxes, fines, fees, regulations.
[02:44.600 --> 02:51.080]  One of the crew members calculated on their paycheck what the new payroll tax is that
[02:51.080 --> 02:57.640]  started. And it comes out to about 200, a little over $200 a month. So we're gonna do
[02:57.640 --> 03:04.460]  a news piece on that. Or I guess whoever volunteers around here, we can black out their pay stub
[03:04.460 --> 03:05.460]  and all that.
[03:05.460 --> 03:10.440]  But government knows when you work for a company, they can just keep adding fees and regulations
[03:10.440 --> 03:19.880]  and surcharges onto things. One of my crew members got pulled over literally two days
[03:19.880 --> 03:25.080]  after his insurance expired, cuz he was gonna sell the truck, cuz he did, he did sell the
[03:25.080 --> 03:31.280]  truck. The illegal aliens, of course, are released, they're allowed to not have insurance.
[03:31.280 --> 03:38.040]  And I think he's gonna do a news piece on it, it's not a secret, but it was a $300 ticket.
[03:38.040 --> 03:41.640]  It's all automated, turned out the cops had cameras that were scanning and reading it,
[03:41.640 --> 03:48.040]  that's why they pulled him over. And then they said there's gonna be another surcharge
[03:48.040 --> 03:53.200]  whenever you go to get your license of between 300 and $1,000 next time he renews it.
[03:53.200 --> 03:57.920]  And then he got another $500 charge in the mail and it says you are convicted and they're
[03:57.920 --> 04:02.600]  just starting to send him more and more bills. That's the new system where you're never out
[04:02.600 --> 04:10.080]  of it. To be a US citizen is to be seen, you've seen those cartoons where the wolf looks at
[04:10.080 --> 04:16.480]  the rabbit or looks at the chicken and then actually sees it as like a skinned piece of
[04:16.480 --> 04:20.400]  meat on a spit and then starts drooling.
[04:20.400 --> 04:27.980]  When government sees you, that's what they see is a meal and they see a mark. Americans
[04:27.980 --> 04:35.040]  are now known as planetary chumps, we are now known as dinner. And all of us more and
[04:35.040 --> 04:39.200]  more have to do whatever we can to get out of the system, sabotage the system, not go
[04:39.200 --> 04:42.120]  along with it, because it's totally illegitimate.
[04:42.120 --> 04:47.400]  You guys pull me the article Steve Watson did about checkpoints all over the highways.
[04:47.400 --> 04:51.520]  By the way, now they're gang checkpoints where they search your vehicle. I mean, this country
[04:51.520 --> 04:57.760]  is in martial law. It's what degree of it and we've got forced inoculation news as well
[04:57.760 --> 05:01.480]  coming up.
[05:01.480 --> 05:05.960]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[05:05.960 --> 05:10.960]  storm. The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst
[05:10.960 --> 05:16.200]  drought in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[05:16.200 --> 05:21.160]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply. I just doubled down and got even
[05:21.160 --> 05:25.600]  more supplies from E Foods Direct and I recommend you do the same. It's time to get your own

[08:23.880 --> 08:30.880]  Up from the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. A new world order. What
[08:30.880 --> 08:39.880]  we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong. A new world order. A new world
[08:39.880 --> 08:54.240]  order. A new world order. A new world order. A new world order. Ladies and gentlemen, we
[08:54.240 --> 09:05.680]  are live. It is Thursday, the third day of January, 2013. And we are going to be here
[09:05.680 --> 09:12.600]  for the next three hours. Wow, where to begin? I have a personal story of here in our office
[09:12.600 --> 09:24.600]  of just unmitigated, over the top oppression and tyranny going on with one of our crew
[09:24.600 --> 09:27.720]  members who we're gonna keep anonymous at this point.
[09:27.720 --> 09:37.360]  And I'm gonna tell that story calmly at the bottom of the hour. And I will tie it into
[09:37.360 --> 09:41.840]  everything else that's happening. But you need to understand, ladies and gentlemen,
[09:41.840 --> 09:46.920]  that the globalists are moving on every front. They are not just coming to confiscate the
[09:46.920 --> 09:56.020]  guns. I am so busy working and spending time with my family and things that I never have
[09:56.020 --> 09:58.960]  time to go out bird hunting or deer hunting.
[09:58.960 --> 10:03.720]  I never even have time to really go to the shooting range, maybe two or three times a
[10:03.720 --> 10:08.020]  year. I have time to go shooting now or I have people visit and they wanna shoot cuz
[10:08.020 --> 10:11.840]  I live out in the country now. So I guess I'm shooting a little bit more than I used
[10:11.840 --> 10:21.720]  to. Growing up, I shot every week and became a pretty good rifleman and even shot competitively
[10:21.720 --> 10:24.800]  a little bit with rifles and handguns.
[10:24.800 --> 10:34.160]  But that is a side issue rabbit trail. It's not that I'm freaked out about physically
[10:34.160 --> 10:40.200]  Dianne Feinstein now introducing the bill today to confiscate most firearms. It's not
[10:40.200 --> 10:44.360]  even the idea of going and laying them outside and the police come and inspect your house
[10:44.360 --> 10:45.360]  without warrants.
[10:45.360 --> 10:49.780]  That's what they're announcing. And they set up checkpoints on highways that are now searching
[10:49.780 --> 10:53.240]  for firearms. That's now happening all over the country. They're even taking legal ones.
[10:53.240 --> 10:56.260]  They don't care if the law says you could have a gun, they just take it right here in
[10:56.260 --> 10:57.260]  Texas as well.
[10:57.260 --> 11:03.920]  I mean, it's just martial law being phased in. It's that I know what comes with it and
[11:03.920 --> 11:10.720]  it's going to be taxes increasing on everything. It's going to be VAT, it's going to be increased
[11:10.720 --> 11:17.720]  sales taxes, it's gonna be increased taxes on energy. It is going to be increased payroll
[11:17.720 --> 11:23.840]  taxes, that's already happening, surcharges, and it's designed. Some of the economists
[11:23.840 --> 11:25.640]  say this will destroy the economy.
[11:25.640 --> 11:30.680]  Well, that's the plan. I mean, they've got 100 plus million people on one form of welfare
[11:30.680 --> 11:35.320]  or another. They wanna go up to 200 million. They've gone from 25 million on food stamps
[11:35.320 --> 11:41.880]  to 49 million in four years. And they intend to double that. And they don't mince words
[11:41.880 --> 11:47.940]  about it. This is your domestication. America has always been the target.
[11:47.940 --> 11:53.200]  And we are to be fully brought down like Poland or Ukraine under Soviet occupation. And I've
[11:53.200 --> 12:03.080]  studied history in depth, that is the plan. And people could say, cuz I've tried to psychoanalyze
[12:03.080 --> 12:13.640]  myself. Is it a macho action that I am going to stay behind in this country and go toe
[12:13.640 --> 12:14.640]  to toe with this?
[12:14.640 --> 12:18.920]  And no, that is not why I'm doing it. It's not out of some hatred of the New World Order
[12:18.920 --> 12:26.760]  and what they do. It's out of an absolute duty and commitment and pledge to fight these
[12:26.760 --> 12:31.760]  people. I just wanna get it across to you, ladies and gentlemen, that they're hurting
[12:31.760 --> 12:35.520]  innocents all over the world.
[12:35.520 --> 12:43.040]  And they're doing things that when you're even mildly informed, are so over the top
[12:43.040 --> 12:52.960]  that it boggles the mind. They give premature babies vaccines now in this country and kill
[12:52.960 --> 13:00.760]  them. They know full well what they do. They give pregnant women vaccines and push them
[13:00.760 --> 13:06.200]  and tell them in hospitals it's the law when they come in to get checkups, when there is
[13:06.200 --> 13:09.200]  no law.
[13:09.200 --> 13:19.880]  Guys, I sent you probably 50 IMs and it's clear there's a problem, you need to reload
[13:19.880 --> 13:25.760]  that. Because I had the definitions in the history of gaslighting, it's a political term.
[13:25.760 --> 13:30.760]  So if that's not in there, I need you to go get me just the top four or five up, the use
[13:30.760 --> 13:34.920]  of gaslighting, the psychological term gaslighting, cuz I wanna cover gaslighting.
[13:34.920 --> 13:42.280]  It's just one term to cover a game the globalists play, and they define it as gaslighting. And
[13:42.280 --> 13:49.880]  it's when you walk in and you find your wife in bed with another man. And she says, there's
[13:49.880 --> 13:54.360]  no man here and the guy gets up, dresses and walks out. They've psychologically found most
[13:54.360 --> 13:57.140]  people will actually go, am I crazy?
[13:57.140 --> 14:01.080]  That's not a guy right there. And because of denial, how we've been programmed through
[14:01.080 --> 14:12.280]  television, gaslighting is more and more effective today than it's ever been. So I'm gonna go
[14:12.280 --> 14:21.240]  over gaslighting today, because I read that term years ago, but I came back across it.
[14:21.240 --> 14:26.520]  And I'm like, that's a great term for what I've been trying to describe. So many times
[14:26.520 --> 14:30.380]  you learn something and you forget it, and they've got different terms for it. They've
[14:30.380 --> 14:37.160]  got Stockholm syndrome, I mean, there's a lot of different learned helplessness.
[14:37.160 --> 14:44.600]  But they've been building the Napa superhighway from Mexico into Texas and up in Oklahoma.
[14:44.600 --> 14:48.880]  It's all over the news here. And they go on CNN over the years, I've played the clips
[14:48.880 --> 14:53.880]  and go, Ron Paul isn't sane. There is no trans Texas corridor, Napa superhighway. When it's
[14:53.880 --> 14:59.680]  all department transportation and publicly admitted and billboards up everywhere, then
[14:59.680 --> 15:00.680]  they go, it doesn't exist.
[15:00.680 --> 15:05.040]  And then they say, we're not gonna build it now. And then they sign an order and bring
[15:05.040 --> 15:08.320]  it back in, even though the legislature said no, cuz they're having the states go and pay
[15:08.320 --> 15:14.840]  for it with taxpayer money. And then the globalists get the tax money off the toll roads. Or it's
[15:14.840 --> 15:23.560]  like CBS, NBC, ABC, all of them saying, Wayne LaPierre is a liar, there are no guns in Israel,
[15:23.560 --> 15:27.560]  there are no armed teachers, there are no armed citizens, that is a lie.
[15:27.560 --> 15:32.160]  The answer to mass shootings is not arming people. And the media went, whoa, LaPierre
[15:32.160 --> 15:39.760]  has got egg on his face, man, that guy's a liar. I mean, it's an absolute fact in triplicate
[15:39.760 --> 15:43.080]  that since the 80s, they've armed the teachers. And then when they go on field trips, they've
[15:43.080 --> 15:50.080]  got M16s, and it's in Haaretz, Jerusalem Post, anybody can go type, Israeli teachers
[15:50.080 --> 15:52.200]  armed, Israeli citizens armed.
[15:52.200 --> 15:57.400]  It's a known fact, you can go read the Israeli laws on the Knesset website, and we've done
[15:57.400 --> 16:03.120]  newscast on it showing you. But see, we can't reach but a few million people a day. And
[16:03.120 --> 16:08.160]  even those listening on radio, once they've been gas lit, once they've been manipulated,
[16:08.160 --> 16:11.740]  once everything's been fogged, they're like, well, he says they got guns, but I've never
[16:11.740 --> 16:13.280]  been there.
[16:13.280 --> 16:23.080]  And it's just incredible. Yeah, there's Fox News showing the teachers with the armed teachers
[16:23.080 --> 16:29.280]  guards bolster school security in Israel. That's from December 30th. As bad as Fox News
[16:29.280 --> 16:32.520]  is, at least they didn't try to hoax their audience. That's why they got more audiences
[16:32.520 --> 16:36.580]  than all the cable news channels combined, because they at least tell enough of the truth
[16:36.580 --> 16:42.200]  so people don't think they're total operatives and actually watch them.
[16:42.200 --> 16:46.400]  That's part of the hoax, though, with MSNBC and CNN, whose top shows have a half million
[16:46.400 --> 16:52.120]  viewers a piece. I mean, there's big shows in Chicago and Dallas and New York that per
[16:52.120 --> 16:57.120]  hour have over a half million listeners on one radio station. I mean, I can look at the
[16:57.120 --> 17:01.800]  numbers on affiliates we've got. Some of our bigger affiliates, we have 110,000 listeners
[17:01.800 --> 17:06.220]  an hour.
[17:06.220 --> 17:15.360]  And that's right off the dash, instant meter computers, 100% people are listening. But
[17:15.360 --> 17:20.320]  it doesn't matter, they get up there in these big giant glistening sets, and they tell you
[17:20.320 --> 17:25.840]  authoritatively, you need to turn your guns in. And people just, well, my gosh, I mean,
[17:25.840 --> 17:30.740]  Piers Morgan, he has that snot-nosed accent and he's such a big audience.
[17:30.740 --> 17:34.880]  Even around here, when I told my crew that they've officially set me up for the seventh
[17:34.880 --> 17:39.360]  with Piers Morgan, people are incredible. And of course, they're thinking it'll be a
[17:39.360 --> 17:42.960]  big news event because we'll have an argument or something. And that is how Piers Morgan
[17:42.960 --> 17:46.820]  actually does have an audience. His actual show doesn't have an audience. The derivative
[17:46.820 --> 17:49.560]  of it does get picked up and put on a lot of other channels.
[17:49.560 --> 17:54.320]  That's why he's number one on CNN, is that he at least knows to have enough controversy
[17:54.320 --> 18:00.680]  and people he disagrees with on to try to get some viewers. So I mean, it's a good move
[18:00.680 --> 18:05.780]  by the Pentagon that on record runs CNN. That's come out Washington Post even, that it's run
[18:05.780 --> 18:09.920]  by the Department of Defense and is basically a PSYOP operation out of Atlanta, New York
[18:09.920 --> 18:12.400]  and Los Angeles and DC.
[18:12.400 --> 18:21.520]  Well, not just a PSYOP, it's far beyond that. But still, there's the, my gosh, Piers Morgan,
[18:21.520 --> 18:26.200]  you're gonna be on there? I mean, it's almost not worth it to go down to the satellite uplink
[18:26.200 --> 18:31.160]  and do the interview. Seriously, and I'm not just saying that. Well, I turn down every
[18:31.160 --> 18:35.780]  week offers, don't even call people back, I should, some other might be something good
[18:35.780 --> 18:36.780]  comes along.
[18:36.780 --> 18:42.960]  Reality TV shows, Discovery Channel, History Channel, BBC, and they send emails back going,
[18:42.960 --> 18:47.240]  we're a huge show. Now, I did wanna go on BBC Radio last week, but I was out that day
[18:47.240 --> 18:52.200]  and missed it. Because it was that World Service show that's on everywhere and it's live, that
[18:52.200 --> 18:56.560]  I would have done. But I don't like tape stuff cuz they can manipulate it.
[18:56.560 --> 19:01.480]  The point is, I'm not up here bragging, hey, I don't need them. It's that they are a hoax.
[19:01.480 --> 19:07.360]  But in a way, I probably should go participate just because the general lemmings see it and
[19:07.360 --> 19:14.640]  think, man, you've really arrived. I mean, my goodness, you were on The View. And The
[19:14.640 --> 19:20.600]  View actually, I did get a big response out of, I've been on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, Discovery
[19:20.600 --> 19:28.560]  Channel, History Channel, you name it, I've been on it, A&E, 60 Minutes, Extra Hard Copy,
[19:28.560 --> 19:33.240]  you name it, I've been on it in 17 years.
[19:33.240 --> 19:38.480]  And it just doesn't do anything, because you've got a bunch of zombies watching it. Now, when
[19:38.480 --> 19:42.760]  we come back, but again, doesn't matter, it still creates the illusion that they're in
[19:42.760 --> 19:47.360]  charge and that everybody believes them. So you've gotta understand, folks, it's a total
[19:47.360 --> 19:48.360]  facade.
[19:48.360 --> 19:53.080]  You ever seen those Hollywood facades to a tour of the studios where it looks like a
[19:53.080 --> 20:01.800]  house but it's just the front with boards propping it up behind it? It's a facade.
[20:01.800 --> 20:06.200]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect

[23:58.280 --> 24:16.960]  Here's USA Today, Huffington Post, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal. We can punch it up for
[24:16.960 --> 24:23.960]  TV viewers that are watching on prisonplanet.tv or just type in tax increase on 77% and literally
[24:23.960 --> 24:30.640]  dozens of articles will pop up. 77% of Americans to have their taxes increased and it'll just
[24:30.640 --> 24:37.220]  be added on to your paycheck or taken out if you actually file your own taxes.
[24:37.220 --> 24:41.680]  And we've got this clip of Obama here. That's just on payroll taxes right there. There's
[24:41.680 --> 24:47.440]  a bunch of other taxes and the Obama surcharge on investments and 401Ks and that's just the
[24:47.440 --> 24:54.000]  beginning. All totals like 14, 15 new taxes, but they call them surcharges and fees so
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.480]  they're not. It's not global government that's being set up, it's global governance. Let's
[24:59.480 --> 25:04.320]  go ahead and play Obama four years ago back during the campaign as saying, I pledge to
[25:04.320 --> 25:06.680]  never raise your taxes. Here it is.
[25:06.680 --> 25:15.960]  I can make a firm pledge under my plan. No family making less than $250,000 a year will
[25:15.960 --> 25:22.600]  see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital
[25:22.600 --> 25:27.200]  gains taxes, not any of your taxes.
[25:27.200 --> 25:34.880]  Okay, so capital gains went up in Obamacare and payroll taxes went up. I mean, he broke
[25:34.880 --> 25:41.220]  every single pledge and that's all he does. And a lot of Obama people over the first three
[25:41.220 --> 25:44.680]  years really woke up to him, his approval rating went down. But once it was the left
[25:44.680 --> 25:50.520]  versus right, rah, rah, Obama, Romney, you're a racist if you don't like Obama, the yuppies
[25:50.520 --> 25:55.220]  and trendies, everybody said, well, hey, Obama's gonna win.
[25:55.220 --> 25:58.960]  And then when Obama won, which was fraud, it was fraud to begin with, the whole fix
[25:58.960 --> 26:03.400]  was in. Just like with the Republicans and the tax increases right now, it was rigged
[26:03.400 --> 26:08.440]  from who was in the race to the fact that Obama clearly didn't win. They didn't care,
[26:08.440 --> 26:14.960]  he was the guy who could create the most division, so they put him in.
[26:14.960 --> 26:21.440]  And people are like, hey, my guy won, just you're angry about it. And I'm like, do you
[26:21.440 --> 26:26.920]  understand Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney work for the very same foreign banks? And literally
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.640]  when Mitt Romney was governor, he supported abortion, of government abortion funding,
[26:31.640 --> 26:37.880]  open borders, takings, all semi-auto, handguns and rifles, carbon taxes.
[26:37.880 --> 26:43.760]  And they go, sure, you lost, I won. And it's like, listen, this is dangerous, okay? They're
[26:43.760 --> 26:50.120]  gonna destroy the economy. Right, right, you're just a racist. And it used to be a white person
[26:50.120 --> 26:55.720]  calling in or on the street telling me this or commenting or newscasters. And see they
[26:55.720 --> 27:02.080]  play along like they're part of the power structure, they're winning.
[27:02.080 --> 27:06.920]  And now all over the country, in fact, guys, will you guys print me the article? I had
[27:06.920 --> 27:11.000]  it on the nightly news last night, but I think it's on the other side. You can either jog
[27:11.000 --> 27:18.200]  over there and then try to find it or just print me, teachers fired for not taking vaccines.
[27:18.200 --> 27:24.840]  And there's another one, nurses fired. Suddenly all over the country, there's no law, and
[27:24.840 --> 27:29.160]  they'd actually lost lawsuits before and it's racketeering when they make you do this.
[27:29.160 --> 27:32.840]  But they just count on ignorance and they don't care if they lose lawsuits cuz it's
[27:32.840 --> 27:38.040]  all government funded. It's about medical tyranny and forcing you to take shots. And
[27:38.040 --> 27:43.760]  they're training police under the state's Model Health Emergency Powers Act to forcibly
[27:43.760 --> 27:44.960]  inoculate you.
[27:44.960 --> 27:48.960]  And that's what TSA putting their hands on you about, and that's what highway checkpoints
[27:48.960 --> 27:53.240]  are all about, is they're getting you ready to put their hands on you. And I'm gonna get
[27:53.240 --> 27:58.320]  into Feinstein's bill to physically confiscate your guns being introduced today. We told
[27:58.320 --> 28:01.880]  you yesterday, Illinois was gonna introduce a bill, according to the NRA, they've done
[28:01.880 --> 28:02.880]  it.
[28:02.880 --> 28:08.400]  It's out of committee, set to pass today. Looks like it may pass right now to make all
[28:08.400 --> 28:14.360]  people in Illinois turn their semi-autos in and pump everything that bolt action is gonna
[28:14.360 --> 28:18.880]  be turned in. And they've got your void card, they know where to come get your gun, so they're
[28:18.880 --> 28:23.960]  coming. It'll be on the news, the trucks and the police and people resisting being killed.
[28:23.960 --> 28:29.160]  And it'll be patriotism to kill American gun owners, and they deserve it. They did Sandy
[28:29.160 --> 28:32.680]  Hook and they're all Klan members anyways. Remember when that month ago they were calling
[28:32.680 --> 28:34.800]  us Klan members and murderers?
[28:34.800 --> 28:38.280]  You're like, that makes no sense, why are they just saying that? Cuz they're demonizing
[28:38.280 --> 28:45.640]  us. Okay, see, you never saw demonization like that before, did you? See, they're taking
[28:45.640 --> 28:51.880]  all the safeties off politically. They're announcing all of it. Here it is, nurses fired
[28:51.880 --> 28:58.560]  for refusing flu shot all over the country. And now they're telling people that have children,
[28:58.560 --> 29:09.720]  you're not gonna get your kid if you don't take the shot to my crew, to my crew.
[29:09.720 --> 29:13.000]  Now we're recording them and stuff and not letting them know that it's my guy and they're
[29:13.000 --> 29:19.680]  just to document all this nightmare, to get them. But the point is, is that I'm gonna,
[29:19.680 --> 29:24.940]  it's just this country, folks. I've got mainstream news announcing checkpoints nationwide at
[29:24.940 --> 29:30.820]  permanent highway checkpoints. Like you've had 100 miles into the border, nationwide
[29:30.820 --> 29:35.000]  you're gonna drive up to police checkpoints, they're gonna search you, TSA is gonna be
[29:35.000 --> 29:36.000]  there, it's been announced.
[29:36.000 --> 29:42.880]  I've got those articles here. It's martial law, folks. And they're gonna set up machine
[29:42.880 --> 29:47.400]  gun nest. You're gonna be under machine gun point when you pull up to these. We're going
[29:47.400 --> 29:49.760]  under Fallujah control.

[32:14.640 --> 32:21.420]  convincing and that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[32:21.420 --> 32:25.600]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen. If you want to know

[34:14.480 --> 34:20.120]  and prisonplanet.com. They say that it is get one membership and share it with 10 people.
[34:20.120 --> 34:28.360]  That's technically 11 memberships. The same username and passcodes can be logged in simultaneously
[34:28.360 --> 34:36.000]  from 11 different computers with the same username and passcode. That is less than 59
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.160]  cents per person per month.
[34:38.160 --> 34:43.480]  You've absolutely got to go get a prisonplanet.tv membership or buy five or six of them and
[34:43.480 --> 34:49.300]  support us. And then put the username and passcode you create that's for the site. Simple
[34:49.300 --> 34:54.560]  names so people can remember it and go give them maybe cards to your boss or your employees
[34:54.560 --> 34:55.720]  or your church.
[34:55.720 --> 35:02.920]  I mean, you could go get three memberships that would be like, I guess $17, $18 a month.
[35:02.920 --> 35:11.840]  And that would be 30 plus memberships. And then go out and get friends and family to
[35:11.840 --> 35:18.020]  tune in every night. We put archives up in high def, all the films, ebooks, a bunch of
[35:18.020 --> 35:19.020]  other documentaries.
[35:19.020 --> 35:23.320]  We've been authorized to post up there. I mean, it really is a first class site now,
[35:23.320 --> 35:30.780]  the new film, strategic relocation, special documentaries, all of it. This is the future
[35:30.780 --> 35:39.680]  of the real medium. This is the real cutting edge. And we are continuing, I mean in perpetuity
[35:39.680 --> 35:45.060]  that you can go get a monthly membership for 595 and 11 people can use it simultaneously.
[35:45.060 --> 35:50.480]  And I'll tell you, most people aren't gonna tune in at the same time at seven o'clock
[35:50.480 --> 35:53.720]  every night when the show goes on and then re-airs over and over again.
[35:53.720 --> 35:59.360]  So I mean, you can probably get 20, 30 people. I mean, in fact, I think it's safe to give
[35:59.360 --> 36:04.120]  like 20 people your username and passcode. Again, don't have the same username and passcode
[36:04.120 --> 36:09.240]  as we say on the site. You have for other things, make it a unique one. And then email
[36:09.240 --> 36:10.240]  it to friends and family.
[36:10.240 --> 36:13.660]  Say, hey, here's my username and passcode. You can use it. They just go enter into the
[36:13.660 --> 36:22.520]  username and passcode. Boom, they're in prisonplanet.tv or in fullwarsnews.com. We'll get them there.
[36:22.520 --> 36:27.440]  And this is a really powerful initiative. If you've already got a membership, share
[36:27.440 --> 36:33.060]  it with other people. If you wanna really support us, go get a couple more memberships
[36:33.060 --> 36:37.800]  and print them up on cards, the username and passcode you create that's simple.
[36:37.800 --> 36:44.700]  And then go give it to people, prisonplanet.tv. And I see that people are using this, people
[36:44.700 --> 36:53.840]  are doing this and it is very, very exciting to see tons of people tuning in when the transmission
[36:53.840 --> 37:02.840]  premieres every single evening at seven o'clock central standard time. And then of course,
[37:02.840 --> 37:08.680]  there's archives a few hours later in HD. You can watch it when you want, how you want,
[37:08.680 --> 37:09.680]  where you want.
[37:09.680 --> 37:13.260]  And we're just adding more and more features to it all the time, a big redesign of the
[37:13.260 --> 37:20.520]  site. Okay, getting back into the news, let me just cover some of what's coming up here.
[37:20.520 --> 37:25.040]  Obama to quickly go for immigration reform, that means total open borders. And this is
[37:25.040 --> 37:35.360]  out of the weekly standard, and gun control. So every time we do the document cam, it's
[37:35.360 --> 37:40.560]  just right here. This is the spot right here, it's right here, we can show the TV viewers,
[37:40.560 --> 37:43.080]  there you go, it's right there.
[37:43.080 --> 37:49.580]  Obama to quickly go for immigration reform and gun control, White House pledges action
[37:49.580 --> 37:59.560]  this month. And it just continues to go over all of that draconian Illinois gun ban advances
[37:59.560 --> 38:09.760]  to Senate floor. Effort to apply Chicago's disastrous gun policy across entire state
[38:09.760 --> 38:10.760]  accelerates.
[38:10.760 --> 38:15.280]  It hasn't been disastrous, it's been a mafia takeover, it's worked absolutely well, the
[38:15.280 --> 38:21.260]  drug war is a big success. Record prison populations, the country converting to a prison culture,
[38:21.260 --> 38:31.240]  largest prison population in world history. Giant mega banks laundering all the drug money,
[38:31.240 --> 38:40.360]  the police totally corrupted in many areas, I mean, it's absolutely worked like a charm.
[38:40.360 --> 38:47.800]  And continuing here with the news, deputy police chief calls for permanent DWI checkpoint
[38:47.800 --> 38:54.460]  in Texas. And they're doing this all over the country, they have these individuals under
[38:54.460 --> 39:01.360]  federal grants. Every day I tune into local radio news and they're going, I think it's
[39:01.360 --> 39:06.400]  the right thing to do to have checkpoints on the highways and just search everyone.
[39:06.400 --> 39:09.920]  And Clinton called for this and signed an executive order, but obviously was unconstitutional
[39:09.920 --> 39:12.960]  so it never got implemented. And they said, we're gonna set up hardened checkpoints on
[39:12.960 --> 39:16.440]  the highways and we're gonna pull everybody over and search them. So to get everybody
[39:16.440 --> 39:21.440]  ready up to 100 miles inside the border, they put these up to basically harass citizens
[39:21.440 --> 39:25.600]  and dig through your car without a warrant claiming their constitution free zones.
[39:25.600 --> 39:29.920]  More than half the population lives within 100 miles of a border or coastline. I think
[39:29.920 --> 39:35.940]  it's like 70 plus percent if you pull up the numbers. So the point here is that they're
[39:35.940 --> 39:43.040]  already doing it though. And under Clinton, I filmed this and have it in my film, Police
[39:43.040 --> 39:51.280]  Day 2000. You can see I-35 at night backed up 20 miles from Kyle in South Austin, in
[39:51.280 --> 39:59.120]  the suburbs, all the way to Georgetown, 20 miles traffic, 3 miles an hour, just to see
[39:59.120 --> 40:00.440]  if they could do it.
[40:00.440 --> 40:05.680]  And people sat there, and if you exited anywhere on the 20 miles, they said that was probable
[40:05.680 --> 40:11.800]  cause to pull you over and search your vehicle on top of it. I mean you see 20 miles of traffic,
[40:11.800 --> 40:16.280]  and we went and drove down the country roads, got out to the end of the checkpoint. Awesome
[40:16.280 --> 40:20.680]  police remember this, and they tried and then the legislature said that's illegal, don't
[40:20.680 --> 40:21.680]  do it anymore.
[40:21.680 --> 40:26.960]  And the police now servile minions of the feds, at least the police chiefs. You've heard
[40:26.960 --> 40:33.920]  it in Arkansas and Oklahoma and California and Michigan, Marines help run DWI checkpoints.
[40:33.920 --> 40:40.640]  And it's in the newspapers in California and places and Marines with nine millimeter Berettas
[40:40.640 --> 40:46.720]  on their hip and heavy machine guns in the backs of Humvees aiming at people.
[40:46.720 --> 40:52.920]  There's a bank robbery outside Denver, so they shut down 50 something square miles and
[40:52.920 --> 40:59.840]  dozens of roads and streets and have cops out with M-16s aiming them at everybody. Just
[40:59.840 --> 41:04.080]  an act of domination, an act of piracy, an act of total control.
[41:04.080 --> 41:09.140]  And now all over the country, they're pulling people over with the same glove. It's totally
[41:09.140 --> 41:12.640]  illegal to search you without a warrant. They don't care, they just say women, get up against
[41:12.640 --> 41:19.880]  the car. And then they take their hand and go in your body. They go in men's rectum,
[41:19.880 --> 41:24.340]  they go in women's hind end, they go in the women's sexual organ.
[41:24.340 --> 41:29.580]  And the women get sick and they get infections, they do it to multiple people. And they go
[41:29.580 --> 41:34.640]  to the doctor and they just go shut up, shut up and get used to it. We'll use the same
[41:34.640 --> 41:41.720]  glove and we're gonna stick our hands in you and you're gonna take it.
[41:41.720 --> 41:46.400]  Just amazing, ladies and gentlemen. And so here's the article, deputy police chief, he's
[41:46.400 --> 41:52.000]  been doing this like every day for six months, calls for permanent DWI checkpoints in Texas,
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.400]  hardened points. And this is what Homeland Security is already announcing, they bought
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.720]  thousands of these armored pillboxes that are like these armored 18-wheeler trailers.
[41:59.720 --> 42:03.120]  And they just set them up, they've already done tests in Tennessee and other areas. We've
[42:03.120 --> 42:08.600]  shown you newscast video, showing some of it now, and they just search you.
[42:08.600 --> 42:12.280]  And by the way, folks, it's getting to the point, they're hiring cops, where you even
[42:12.280 --> 42:17.560]  lip them. They just get you out and just go taser time, or they just roundhouse with a
[42:17.560 --> 42:22.400]  big old punch, break your jaw, charge you with assaulting them, even though it's on
[42:22.400 --> 42:26.240]  video. You videotape them, they club your head in, take you to jail, and it's just they're
[42:26.240 --> 42:28.600]  gonna stomp your guts out, America.
[42:28.600 --> 42:33.640]  They're gonna take your guns unless you wake up. I mean, I'm laying out what's really going
[42:33.640 --> 42:40.320]  on here. I'm telling you where the end of the road goes, okay? I'm telling you where
[42:40.320 --> 42:47.160]  the end of the road goes, okay? And the state police for two weeks, when they showed these
[42:47.160 --> 42:55.520]  police just randomly, I'm gonna pull you over, happened to Darren McBreen's girlfriend.
[42:55.520 --> 43:00.000]  She's driving all the way out of West Texas to come here and see him. She's on the same
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.720]  road, cops pull him over, and they go, I saw you not use a turn signal. And she said, I've
[43:04.720 --> 43:10.320]  been on the same lane for over 100 miles, he goes, let me just see your eyes.
[43:10.320 --> 43:16.120]  This is just a DWI, just apologize, just randomly checking here. It's a joke, I mean, cops pull
[43:16.120 --> 43:21.040]  me over, know who I am and ask if I'm drinking or if I have drugs or guns. And I just go,
[43:21.040 --> 43:25.100]  number one, I don't use products that your bosses ship in. Number two, I'm not dumb enough
[43:25.100 --> 43:26.620]  to be drinking and driving.
[43:26.620 --> 43:40.240]  And number three, I just don't even know what to say anymore. You know full well that you're
[43:40.240 --> 43:46.120]  implying guns are illegal. It's gone, it's gone. We have the biggest prison population,
[43:46.120 --> 43:50.160]  we have the highest cancer rate, they're killing us. We're being killed, okay? And I've got
[43:50.160 --> 43:54.680]  all their White House science, our book, Eco Science, where they talk about how they kill
[43:54.680 --> 43:57.680]  us with cancer and kill us with stuff in the water.
[43:57.680 --> 44:05.360]  I mean, it just sterilizes our sperm counts down 87 to 89% and the women are dying. Highest
[44:05.360 --> 44:08.920]  rate of breast cancer in the world and our kids are the most brain damaged in the world
[44:08.920 --> 44:15.160]  from all the shots. And I'm a bad guy, I'm a mad dog for being upset about it. Let me
[44:15.160 --> 44:21.820]  continue here. A deputy police chief in South Texas, South Texas is the second biggest city
[44:21.820 --> 44:22.820]  in Texas.
[44:22.820 --> 44:26.200]  What is it, like 5 million people, wants to set up permanent DWI checkpoints in order
[44:26.200 --> 44:32.080]  to save lives. Well, I mean, how do I put cameras in our house? They're already proposing
[44:32.080 --> 44:35.960]  that in Houston. It saves lives, raising the possibility that Texans would be forced to
[44:35.960 --> 44:40.160]  show their papers, submit to breathalyzer tests, and even mandated to have blood drawn
[44:40.160 --> 44:42.160]  whenever they drive down the street.
[44:42.160 --> 44:46.720]  Yeah, the feds started this 15 years ago in Phoenix, and now they've done it everywhere.
[44:46.720 --> 44:53.500]  And first they go, well, it's a holiday, no refusal to take blood. Listen, one of my graphics
[44:53.500 --> 45:06.560]  crew was out, and I happen to know she doesn't even drink. And they're out before New Year's,
[45:06.560 --> 45:10.840]  it was after Christmas, and they're driving home and she's a designated driver going out
[45:10.840 --> 45:12.400]  to eat.
[45:12.400 --> 45:17.720]  And they get them out and they go, we're arresting you all, we can smell alcohol. And they go,
[45:17.720 --> 45:21.720]  well, I haven't been drinking, I'm a designated driver. They said, well, do a bunch of sobriety
[45:21.720 --> 45:25.080]  tests. She did one and said, look, I've not been drinking, I told you. They said, that's
[45:25.080 --> 45:30.860]  it, you're DWI too. They wanna stick needles in you, and I'm gonna get to the forced inoculations
[45:30.860 --> 45:31.860]  in a moment.
[45:31.860 --> 45:37.500]  And it goes on, San Antonio Deputy Police Chief Antonio Trevino appeared Monday in Austin
[45:37.500 --> 45:43.240]  before the Texas House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee. The San Antonio Express News reports
[45:43.240 --> 45:48.600]  he urged legislators to allow law officers to stop drivers and do routine sobriety tests
[45:48.600 --> 45:51.880]  near so-called drinking and driving hot spots, which is just everywhere.
[45:51.880 --> 45:55.880]  Again, they let you go drinking the bars, humans have always done it. Texting and driving
[45:55.880 --> 46:01.600]  is five times more dangerous than MIT studies, that isn't what matters. It's all about getting
[46:01.600 --> 46:06.600]  you into the system, but if you're an illegal alien, they let you go. He says local data
[46:06.600 --> 46:09.880]  could be used to identify areas where such behavior is prevalent.
[46:09.880 --> 46:15.520]  Okay, let me explain to you, they're already doing these illegally. Here's the next story,
[46:15.520 --> 46:22.800]  Steve Watson, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com. Texas cops cite gangs as justification for
[46:22.800 --> 46:28.880]  unconstitutional checkpoints. They set up highway checkpoints across South Texas, and
[46:28.880 --> 46:33.360]  then just search your car, they admit it in the articles, the McKellen Monitor, and make
[46:33.360 --> 46:39.040]  you take your shirt off on the side of the road and take photos of your tattoos.
[46:39.040 --> 46:44.980]  And then the argument is, well, it's the Mexican drug gangs that are government trained and
[46:44.980 --> 46:49.880]  ship guns to and launders the drug money for, well, COVID Wells Fargo on record. I mean,
[46:49.880 --> 46:54.480]  it's all a joke. You made the drugs illegal, just like they made alcohol illegal, cuz you're
[46:54.480 --> 46:57.640]  criminals, cuz you want a cut of it, and you've destroyed Mexico.
[46:57.640 --> 47:01.920]  And now they're gonna declare martial law. I had a state senator on two years ago who
[47:01.920 --> 47:05.040]  said they've already declared martial law on the border. Now it's coming all the way
[47:05.040 --> 47:11.360]  up to San Antonio, almost 200 miles from the border. I mean, I've seen Border Patrol vehicles
[47:11.360 --> 47:19.440]  pulling people over in Austin, and it's citizens. I've talked to people who've had TSA, we even
[47:19.440 --> 47:23.000]  got photos of it, big black armored vehicles that say TSA.
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.300]  And they'll come up and rouse women in a parking lot and ask them what they're doing. I mean,
[47:27.300 --> 47:36.200]  it's just a bunch of goons like North Korea. And they go on to break down how they're doing
[47:36.200 --> 47:41.600]  and that's out of the McAllen monitor. I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is just unbelievable.
[47:41.600 --> 47:50.440]  Now let me move along to this report right here. Nurses fired for refusing shot, KTXS.
[47:50.440 --> 47:57.720]  This is all over the country. Hospital employees had filed appeals citing religious reasons.
[47:57.720 --> 48:02.640]  Six nurses and other employees at hospital in Indiana are out of jobs refusing the flu
[48:02.640 --> 48:07.660]  shot. I just feel like it's a toxin. Well, it says it on the insert, it can kill you.
[48:07.660 --> 48:12.440]  And I don't want it in my body, she told the station. There are side effects. Says that
[48:12.440 --> 48:16.280]  in the insert, I can show you. CDC saying it can kill you. There are no guarantees that
[48:16.280 --> 48:17.960]  it's even going to protect you.
[48:17.960 --> 48:23.200]  The flu shot has never been guessed a year early of what it's actually gonna be. And
[48:23.200 --> 48:26.600]  it lowers your immunity by 50% each time you take it and gives you Alzheimer's. But that's
[48:26.600 --> 48:33.320]  mainline studies. Now let me tell you the story, okay? And we're not ready to give out
[48:33.320 --> 48:38.680]  the info yet because we wanna not play that card right now cuz I'm probably gonna help
[48:38.680 --> 48:41.040]  him litigate.
[48:41.040 --> 48:49.560]  One of my crew members wife had a two pound six ounce baby last week. The baby has brain
[48:49.560 --> 48:55.880]  swelling, the baby has blood going cuz 300 heart beats per minute out of its ventricles
[48:55.880 --> 49:02.820]  into the lungs, the baby is in critical condition. What's going on at the hospital? And I warned
[49:02.820 --> 49:07.880]  him too cuz it's a city affiliated when I said don't go near your life.
[49:07.880 --> 49:11.760]  You gotta go where rich people go if you're gonna go to a hospital because they don't
[49:11.760 --> 49:16.960]  feed on them yet. If you go to a big mainline mega hospital, folks, they see you as an animal.
[49:16.960 --> 49:23.200]  Or you better show up in diamond rings and top hats because you have a birth plan or
[49:23.200 --> 49:26.120]  whatever, you say on there no vaccines.
[49:26.120 --> 49:31.040]  And the nurses try to pressure you do it, you go, no, I know there's no law, stop saying
[49:31.040 --> 49:34.760]  there is. They're in there telling him, we're not gonna give you your baby. We're gonna
[49:34.760 --> 49:41.640]  take your baby, which is in a lot of trouble. I want you to pray for the baby girl, we're
[49:41.640 --> 49:43.840]  just gonna leave it at that.
[49:43.840 --> 49:51.960]  This is a great guy and great lady, friends of mine, just really good people. And they
[49:51.960 --> 49:56.280]  are in there day one going, you as parents must take the shots or you can't have your
[49:56.280 --> 50:01.080]  kid, hepatitis, flu, you name it. No law, but they're telling them it is. You understand
[50:01.080 --> 50:04.880]  how criminal that is, but they just do it cuz they're backed up by the police and their
[50:04.880 --> 50:08.260]  ignorance and their evil.
[50:08.260 --> 50:13.560]  And they're in there saying basically that, well, I'm gonna break it down after break.
[50:13.560 --> 50:18.240]  But you remember just four years ago, everybody knew you don't give a pregnant woman a vaccine
[50:18.240 --> 50:23.400]  as the insert says and cause a miscarriage or brain damage the child. And it's just well
[50:23.400 --> 50:31.980]  known for decades. And I got crew here who have wives who are nurses, where they're pregnant.
[50:31.980 --> 50:35.400]  And the hospital's like, okay, you don't have to take the shot cuz you're pregnant cuz the
[50:35.400 --> 50:37.340]  doctors still know that.
[50:37.340 --> 50:41.880]  But now they've come out in the news and said, no, if you're pregnant, you need extra shots.
[50:41.880 --> 50:47.400]  Folks, they wanna just see if they can kill us right out in the open. And they're there,
[50:47.400 --> 50:54.960]  imagine when a mother is in these desperate straits. They forced her to take the shots
[50:54.960 --> 51:00.040]  outside of law, saying we'll take your baby. It's unbelievable.
[51:00.040 --> 51:05.960]  Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older
[51:05.960 --> 51:10.240]  one gets. The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the
[51:10.240 --> 51:14.560]  older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention
[51:14.560 --> 51:20.120]  to nutrition. If the Hanza men can play rugby in their 90s, then it is possible for everyone
[51:20.120 --> 51:24.640]  in North America to experience a more youthful life as well. One key ingredient to warding
[51:24.640 --> 51:29.120]  off aging and reversing some of it is the type and quality of protein consumed. All
[51:29.120 --> 51:33.920]  protein foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damage, destroying 50 to
[51:33.920 --> 51:39.840]  75% of your ability to utilize the bodybuilding amino acids. One world way is not heat damage
[51:39.840 --> 51:46.400]  and allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids. This feat no one else has achieved.

[54:13.000 --> 54:19.320]  Let me break down how evil, how criminal, how wicked the TSA, the hospital workers,
[54:19.320 --> 54:24.840]  the police, the whole system, they gang up like gangs and say, we're going to drag you
[54:24.840 --> 54:28.720]  off in a room and stick our hands down your pants. We're the state police. And we'll show
[54:28.720 --> 54:32.520]  some video of that for TV viewers. We're going to pull women over and we're going to get
[54:32.520 --> 54:33.800]  these good looking women out.
[54:33.800 --> 54:38.440]  That's why this was, it's always the same. And we're going to take the same glove and
[54:38.440 --> 54:43.200]  we're going to stick it inside your body. That's America, folks. And the sycophantic
[54:43.200 --> 54:50.920]  fetish of worshiping government is so incredible that people are like, it's the right thing
[54:50.920 --> 54:55.020]  to do. It's for our safety. And they're showing the video now and they go to the next woman.
[54:55.020 --> 55:00.980]  It's even more incredible. Now same glove, it's on record, here they go. That's on top
[55:00.980 --> 55:03.520]  of all this.
[55:03.520 --> 55:09.240]  Now let's expand on this. One of my crew members, probably the sweetest person that works up
[55:09.240 --> 55:17.680]  here. In fact, no doubt the sweetest person that works up here. They're so excited about
[55:17.680 --> 55:25.240]  having a baby. And of course, the system pushed to have ultrasounds over and over again. And
[55:25.240 --> 55:29.160]  I was like warning them that it's study show that causes this.
[55:29.160 --> 55:34.720]  But the point is, that goes on. There's a medical mafia. And then they're in there for
[55:34.720 --> 55:39.000]  like a week now. And they come in and they go, you're not going to get your baby unless
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.040]  you take shots. And this is somebody that works here and is smart. And they go, there's
[55:43.040 --> 55:44.040]  no law.
[55:44.040 --> 55:49.280]  They're like, yeah, there is. Well, show me the insert. There is no insert. Well, I want
[55:49.280 --> 55:53.680]  the one without mercury. Just see what they go. There is no mercury. It's all just, you're
[55:53.680 --> 56:01.520]  like, well, yes, there is. It's all just savage lying. And it's called gaslighting. That's
[56:01.520 --> 56:05.960]  one term used in psychology.
[56:05.960 --> 56:10.560]  And it made me physically ill when he was up here with tears in his eyes yesterday.
[56:10.560 --> 56:16.260]  And I just said, go in there, record it. And we'll save a lot of people's children when
[56:16.260 --> 56:23.560]  we put all this out. I said, record it. Get them to all say it again. Record on your iPhone.
[56:23.560 --> 56:25.320]  And we'll get them.
[56:25.320 --> 56:29.320]  You gotta get aggressive with these people, okay? They will tell parents, it's the law,
[56:29.320 --> 56:34.040]  your kids gotta take vaccines. They shoot them up from Alabama to California now without
[56:34.040 --> 56:39.220]  parental consent. And when people sued in California, they got the legislature to pass
[56:39.220 --> 56:47.400]  a law to shoot your kids up and not even tell you, saying the state is the parent.
[56:47.400 --> 56:52.840]  I mean, that's crook. They're like, we got a law to do it. Really, you got a law to do
[56:52.840 --> 56:59.200]  it, huh? Your law is a tyranny. Your law is a fraud. And I've got all the Supreme Court
[56:59.200 --> 57:04.600]  cases, but everybody knows that. I mean, these people are a cult of yes men. And these mega
[57:04.600 --> 57:11.940]  corporations that are eugenicist, they go out and they hire people who will do what
[57:11.940 --> 57:12.940]  they're told.
[57:12.940 --> 57:17.320]  They give you psychological profiles now to get a job at McDonald's. And those profiles
[57:17.320 --> 57:22.800]  on record are set to make sure you'll go along with it. Gaslighting is a form of psychological
[57:22.800 --> 57:27.900]  abuse in which false information is presented with the intent of making a victim doubt his
[57:27.900 --> 57:30.680]  or her own memory, perception, and sanity.
[57:30.680 --> 57:35.520]  That's where they go. They'll say, you have to take the shots as mommy and daddy. And
[57:35.520 --> 57:42.680]  so does the baby. Instances may range simply from the denial by an abuser that previous
[57:42.680 --> 57:48.240]  abuse incidents have occurred, up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention
[57:48.240 --> 57:53.360]  of disorienting the victim. And see, the globalist brag, Cass Sunseat at the White House says,
[57:53.360 --> 57:55.400]  they want to disorient us.
[57:55.400 --> 58:00.440]  All this is like, our bill says we're gonna take your guns, but we're not going to. We're
[58:00.440 --> 58:06.620]  building the trans Texas corridor, but it doesn't exist. And they play these mind games
[58:06.620 --> 58:12.500]  with people, and that's why people are disoriented. And you watch cartoons and TV. That's why
[58:12.500 --> 58:15.140]  cartoons don't make sense and are all disjointed.
[58:15.140 --> 58:20.460]  It's on major studies. The kids brains are already wired wrong. They're brain damaged.
[58:20.460 --> 58:26.480]  The general public's in a trance, folks. They've got military control grade systems that have
[58:26.480 --> 58:32.640]  been proven in torture camps by the Chinese, the communist Russians, the Nazis in our government,
[58:32.640 --> 58:37.920]  and they're using it on you. The police are pulling you over, putting their hands up your
[58:37.920 --> 58:51.240]  rear end. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.240 --> 58:55.920]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[58:55.920 --> 59:01.560]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing

[59:30.740 --> 59:35.800]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:33.600]  If you just joined us, it makes me physically ill because I empathize. I've told the story
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:44.560]  of
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:49.220]  I live out in the country, I can watch these geckos hunt like tigers or lions sitting there
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:56.860]  by the light coming out and eating mosquitoes, little fat pink things, a little lizards and
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:58.440]  skinks and others.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.400]  Some of them are like a foot and a half long, some of these lizards, it's like Wild Kingdom
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.640]  out in the Texas Hill Country.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.420]  And undoubtedly a couple times a year, especially when it gets cold, they come in the house
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:15.520]  and I'll be in the bathroom at night and I feel a crunch.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:19.580]  And I turn the light on and there's a little smash gecko, his guts and brain smashed down
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.680]  and it hurts.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:27.080]  Because it's a pointless death and it's a cute little creature and I empathize with
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.080]  it cuz I love life.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.320]  Now I have proper instincts, I understand to go out and shoot a deer that's a prey animal,
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.840]  butcher it and then eat it, that is a natural progression.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.080]  If you don't, you get overpopulations of them and they're running out in front of cars everywhere
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.560]  and starving to death, this is just happening in Austin.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.720]  You're like, where is this going?
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:48.160]  What are you talking about before Dr. Corsi comes on to get into the Trans Texas corridor,
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.800]  the attack on the Second Amendment, just unprecedented stuff happening, but we have a normalcy bias,
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.560]  even I do now, to just accept it.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.600]  Warrantless checkpoints where they stick their hands inside your body, it's all being set
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.600]  up.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.000]  Then the cops pull you over and just laugh at you cuz they're in the uniform, they're
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.440]  in the car, they got the power.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:08.520]  Doesn't matter they've already been implanted with cancer viruses in the flu shot, doesn't
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.360]  matter they're gonna be in 10, 15 years dead of cancer, 45 years old, they'll never even
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.560]  know what hit them.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:21.480]  So there's not even a, it's sad when you're looking at one of these zombies, cuz they're
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:27.400]  just victims, but you can't get through to them, you can't get through.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:32.640]  You're not gonna get through to the zombies, 5% of our forebears said no to the corruption
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.360]  and won, and there's way more than 5% of us really get what's going on, but I wanna say
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.960]  something to mainline conservatives here.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:53.120]  It's time for you to realize that the left isn't the left, and the left isn't environmental
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.880]  wackos or stupid or they don't know what they're doing.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.920]  They know taking guns makes crime go up, they wanna make you their slave.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:09.800]  And the reason I got off into empathy is that when I know somebody and their baby is in
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.680]  critical condition fighting for their life.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:20.040]  And the nurses are there bullying them and telling the young mother, yeah, you gotta
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.520]  take the shot or you don't get to have the baby, we'll take the baby.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:28.520]  That's like saying, come into somebody's door and saying, buy life insurance from me or
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.880]  I'm gonna kidnap your kid.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:36.320]  I mean, it's the same thing, but it's, you're in a nurse uniform, well, I better do what
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.360]  you say cuz the nurses have been forced to take it.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:46.080]  They're gonna now abuse you and force you to do it outside of law, assaulting you with
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:56.920]  a deadly weapon proven to be hurting people.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.200]  It's amazing.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:06.680]  And they sit there with gaslighting and I'm telling you, gaslighting is a term used since
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:10.120]  the 30s and there's other clinical names for it.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.360]  And it's in psychological warfare manuals that are declassified that I've gone and read
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.800]  and training films that you can look on YouTube, army training psyop manuals of how when they
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.080]  would take over a third world country, how they control people and round them up.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.920]  Our military has done that.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.200]  You go watch those psychological warfare videos, just type that in, army psychological warfare
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.080]  videos, and you'll see them from the 50s and stuff.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:34.480]  And it's what they're setting up with the checkpoints and the tattletales and all this.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:41.760]  And they'll come to you and you're like, you just use the same glove to go in my hind end
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.920]  and then in theirs, and they'll go, there's no glove.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:53.040]  And you're like, what do you mean there's no, cuz it never, it's a psych warfare technique.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:05:00.720]  There's no trans Texas corridor, Israelis don't own guns.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.760]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.320]  you get sick and die?
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.520]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:13.080]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:17.640]  is ProPure and it's available discounted at infowars.com.

[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.000]  ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.880]  It's what my family uses, infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:55.680]  Even if you add the promo code water at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com.

[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:06.200]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200]  storm.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.520]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:16.420]  in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:19.720]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:24.000]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct, and I recommend you do
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  the same.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.640]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoods Direct.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:31.240]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.640]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.280]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.080]  409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.920]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:08.120]  A prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:14.160]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.160]  to the global takeover.
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:21.120]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfowarsShop.com.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.800]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:29.760]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:34.600]  The Ktor Hand Crank Generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.600]  in the field.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.560]  Strategic Relocation, third edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:41.000]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.

[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.800]  Hand Crank Shortwave AM-FM radios.

[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.100]  We're getting prepared.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.100]  Are you?
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.100]  InfowarsShop.com.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:10.240]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.400]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:25.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:41.320]  My friends, we are in extremely dark times.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:44.080]  The darkest of my 17 years on air.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.120]  And unfortunately, our worst analysis is coming true.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.160]  The worst case scenario is now unfolding.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.840]  You can probably tell I'm a lot more serious and focused on air.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.920]  I'm a lot more angry.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.900]  And it's because the globalist are hammer down.
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:03.440]  They are going for broke right now.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.740]  As the big new Brzezinski has said in two council on foreign relations speeches, also
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:11.160]  another one in Poland, and in his new book that I read a few months ago.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:15.460]  The globalist are in trouble, worldwide there's an awakening.
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:20.440]  And so they are going to try to artificially trigger revolutions and put radical Muslims
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:23.560]  in charge to destabilize the whole world.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:29.040]  And then use that threat to take our liberties, it's the old British game of divide and conquer.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:35.320]  Expanding on that, it is in the Illinois Senate, the NRA says it looks like it may pass.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.280]  The article is up at infowars.com.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:47.960]  It is a physical gun ban of all semi-automatics, revolvers, handguns.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:48.960]  You name it.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:56.200]  You can reach up infowars.com for viewers and people can actually see that article if
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.160]  they're watching at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:03.720]  But gun ban bill advances to Senate floor.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:08.540]  Now notice they use the psychological warfare program of saying we never want your guns.
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.920]  We don't wanna make you turn them in.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:10.920]  That's preposterous.
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.800]  I've played Joe Biden saying it's ridiculous.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.460]  Nobody's gonna try to take your handguns.
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:18.120]  Nobody's gonna try to take your shotgun.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:22.300]  He authored an even stronger assault weapons ban that called for them to physically be
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:27.480]  turned in, that Dianne Feinstein originally turned in, that made you physically turn in
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.480]  all semi-autos.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.720]  And we played the clip of her saying, I tried to get a bill where Mr. and Mrs. America have
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.640]  to turn in their guns.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.120]  I'll play that clip later, but if you're a new listener, it was all over the news last
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.120]  week.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:45.620]  But then they play this game of we're not doing that, we're not doing that, we're not
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:46.620]  doing that.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:50.200]  Dianne Feinstein's introduced her bill that even mainline gun groups are going, it makes
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:54.360]  you go in with your legally bought guns, and you go into the ATF and then they decide if
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.040]  you can keep them, it's registration.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.200]  No, the bill actually says that and a forced buyback.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:06.120]  And she's in the New York Times with Cuomo saying we're gonna make you turn them in.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:11.800]  And now in Illinois, the area that this mafia controls, Rahm Emanuel and others, we're on
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.160]  the radio in Chicago right now fighting him, a lot of good people up there are exposing
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.200]  it.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:23.720]  They're saying, yeah, all state holders of guns, handguns, rifles, revolvers, pump shotguns
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.720]  and pump rifles.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:30.080]  Yeah, I saw somebody on infowars.com comment and go, there's such a thing as pump rifles.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.040]  Yeah, you didn't know there were a lot of pump rifles?
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.840]  Actually some pretty good firearms out there.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.720]  Lever action, you name it.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:44.400]  They basically are banning everything but bolt action and single shot.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:51.080]  And they've got the Floyd registration, they always use registration to then confiscate.
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:55.520]  And they want the Chicago model of a total gun ban for citizens, which has made it the
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:02.120]  murder capital of the world, 500 deaths last year, 512 they said.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.120]  And most of it's getting related.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:08.020]  The point is, this is the days of Al Capone, it's gangs killing each other, citizens have
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.280]  a right to defend themselves.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.760]  And a lot of those deaths were citizens defending themselves.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.680]  Dr. Jerome, of course, is gonna join us for the balance of the hour and I appreciate him
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.680]  coming on.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.960]  We're gonna get into this, we're gonna get into his article where Perry is still doing
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:25.520]  public private partnerships, Trans Texas, Napa Super Highway in pieces.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.120]  And people say, I was on Man Cal yesterday and he said, well, why is it important if
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.120]  it's in Texas?
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:35.120]  He was asking a rhetorical question, he knew why, a really smart guy, Eric Muller.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:42.400]  And I said, Eric, there's 40 plus major interstate highways, another 40 other corollary roads
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:48.420]  that they, in the official Department of Transportation documents, say they wanna take over, put taxes
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:50.840]  on and fund the North American Union with.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:56.640]  And it's an artery right down to the Pacific side of Mexico with the biggest port now in
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:00.040]  the hemisphere to bring in Chinese goods.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:03.320]  And it's an international corridor, like the Romans used roads to control things.
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:07.220]  And I made the film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, almost three hours long.
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:11.120]  About 30 minutes of it is on this subject and it shows Bush giving speeches saying,
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.760]  we've merged the North American Union with the EU, all the agreements.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:18.480]  I mean, we're already way down the hole here.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.320]  So all of that's going on, and that's what this is about.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.260]  We're already under a North American Union.
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:27.120]  But the states twice voted it down.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.960]  Texas is the main funding artery to fund it all the way up into Canada.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.980]  They've got mile markers all the way to Canada.
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:38.000]  It's marked for mile markers all the way for something like 2,000 miles.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:46.280]  But they just call it the I-35 shooter round outside Austin.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.120]  But it goes all the way to San Antonio, it's there.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:54.240]  And CNN, I've played the clubs, you've seen it, would say Ron Paul four years ago is insane.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:58.640]  There is no Texas superhighway, there is no trans Texas corridor.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:03.760]  We had billboards all over the state with a cowboy going, I like the trans Texas corridor
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:04.760]  and paying tolls.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:09.720]  And they had ads going, yeah, it's trans Texas corridor, Texas is proud to be part of the
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:10.720]  NAP superhighway system.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:16.800]  I'd go to movies and see ads before the movies going, Texas is a proud part of the North
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.120]  American Union, appreciate all you're doing.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.960]  Meanwhile, we go, hey, we don't want this, it doesn't exist.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:27.920]  And that's a psychological warfare term called gaslighting, is a form of psychological abuse
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:33.000]  in which false information is presented with the intent of making a victim doubt his or
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.560]  her own memory, perception, and sanity.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:41.080]  Instances may range simply from the denial by an abuser that previous abuse incidents
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:46.720]  ever occurred, or even the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.960]  disorienting the victim.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:51.240]  That's why they'll have school drills unannounced where they aim guns at kids.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.820]  It happened to my crew, who's got kids in public school.
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:57.500]  They come and bang on the elementary and say, we're here to kill you, and the kids all cry
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:58.500]  and get scared.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:03.120]  And the teachers go, following a manual, we're sorry we had to do this.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.920]  It's because of American gun owners.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:08.360]  In one manual in Michigan, the feds issued it was, we're sorry to do this.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.820]  This was due to homeschoolers and people against public education.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:16.640]  That's AP, if you think I'm joking, they go, sorry, we just blew up a car in the front
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.080]  parking lot and came and said we were going to kill you.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:23.200]  And children literally urinate on themselves, teachers have had to go to funny farms over
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.200]  it.
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:27.400]  Literally, this has been in the news, have breakdowns where they marched people out saying
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.060]  they're gonna kill them and mask, and don't tell them it's a drill.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.440]  That was in Minneapolis, St. Paul.
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:32.920]  Okay, I'm ranting, we'll go to our guests.
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:37.640]  I just wanna introduce this, cuz some stations just joined us in this hour.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:42.360]  That it is a psychological warfare program, and the police are being brainwashed too to
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.040]  just accept this.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.960]  Now they're announcing checkpoints all over the country to stop gangs and look for illegal
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.960]  guns.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.400]  The hammer's being dropped, and Dr. Corsi can break this down.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.640]  He, of course, has worked with the State Department and National Security in classified areas.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.440]  He has a Harvard PhD in political science.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.240]  He's worked for Fortune, top mega banks, you name it.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:08.080]  I'm not gonna go over his whole bio, he's, I don't know, three or four number one New
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.880]  York Times bestsellers.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:16.720]  But this is the total takeover, and the Republicans, you notice, $1 of cuts for every $41 in tax
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:17.720]  increases.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:21.760]  77% of Americans, massive tax increases, Obama lying about that.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.680]  They're announcing total open borders, total legalization.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.600]  They're going for our guns everywhere, it's on, checkpoints, everything.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.960]  Dr. Corsi, how bad is it?
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.360]  It's even worse than I thought it would be.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.360]  What is your take?
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.960]  Why is it moving so quickly?
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:38.400]  I mean, it is like the dam is broken.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.080]  Well, I think it's a rush to the finish line.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:45.440]  I think the new world order sees an opportunity.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:53.140]  With the article I wrote in the World Net Daily WND just over the holidays, it's clear
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:58.200]  that Governor Perry, with the trans Texas corridor, that it's back.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:06.340]  I mean, I researched it and found that now there's something like $20 billion in road
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:12.480]  work underway throughout Texas on these public-private partnerships.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:15.560]  That's the key idea, the public-private partnership.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:22.440]  In other words, and typically three of the one, three of these deals I looked at in particular,
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:33.960]  is State Highway 130 near San Antonio, extensions of I-35 around Dallas-Fort Worth, Cintra C-I-N-T-R-A
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:39.200]  in Spain, which was the company that was going to do the full development of the trans Texas
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:45.320]  corridor, the 4,000 miles that Governor Perry proposed before we exposed it and they had
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.000]  to withdraw the plan in disgrace.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.840]  But Cintra's going to build these highways on 50-year leases, where, for instance, let's
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:03.880]  say Cintra puts up $5 billion, the state of Texas subsidizes with a billion dollars, Cintra
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:11.500]  builds the extension to the road, now they're doing it piece by piece, and Cintra gets to
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:18.680]  run the toll road for 50 years on a 50-year lease, and Cintra in Spain collects the tolls
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.760]  from the motorists driving in Texas.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:27.400]  And again, this was something that Governor Perry said he'd put an end to.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:32.120]  2009, there was a pledge to end the trans Texas corridor with Cintra.
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:35.720]  Don't forget, you've seen the collapse where CNN just said it didn't even exist.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.720]  Right, exactly.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:42.120]  I mean, they're still denying that any of this planning exists or that Winnipeg up in
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:49.080]  Canada has been declared by Prime Minister Harper to be an inland port, and they're building
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.080]  the same infrastructure.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.600]  What's incredible is the meetings, the maps, all of it's 100% public, and then they first
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.480]  announced it even in Time Magazine, and then when we don't like it, they go, you're crazy,
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.480]  that doesn't exist.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.680]  Well, they deny it, they laugh about it.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:11.880]  If you remember up in Montebello in Canada, when they were asked, Harper and Bush at that
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:17.680]  time, the president of Mexico, three of them meeting in the Security and Prosperity Partnership,
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:24.800]  if there was going to be a NAFTA super highway that was going to combine three nations and
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:31.400]  this continent, North America, into an international transportation system, and Harper laughed
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.760]  at it and he said, oh yes, it may be interplanetary.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:41.080]  And then of course he comes out and announces that Winnipeg is going to be an inland port
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:46.600]  and that the government of Canada is committed to building an international transportation
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:50.000]  structure that ties into trade in China.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.600]  Well, it's all in the SPP documents.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.120]  We're going to be right back to get into this, but then I want to get into the guns with
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:02.080]  you, and I want to get into the Middle East, Benghazi, because you're an expert on this.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:06.880]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:07.880]  storm.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:11.760]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression, America's worst drought
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:16.560]  in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:19.800]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:24.080]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from E Foods Direct, and I recommend you do
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.080]  the same.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.600]  It's time to get your own supply from E Foods Direct.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.120]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:35.480]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:07.640]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin

[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.680]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:34.400]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.400]  IRAs?
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.460]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:41.160]  of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.640]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:49.620]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.440]  Hi there.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.440]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:05.720]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:11.960]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:16.560]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent, lying crooks
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:21.800]  that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:25.800]  Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a coverup, and you will be
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:29.700]  shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:35.360]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.680]  and how you can beat them too.
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:41.520]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.240]  in the last three months.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.640]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:49.640]  your home.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:55.480]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:20.080]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.000]  To be kind to Dr. Jerome Corsi, who's with us again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.080]  I've been right up front in this, going to the Campo board meetings, watching the takeover,
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:32.120]  reading the SPP documents that Judicial Watch sued and got.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:38.080]  And I know Dr. Corsi's been on this even more than I have, but watching in Texas, they don't
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.720]  even follow their agreements.
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:44.680]  In fact, most of the new toll road stuff is built off existing toll roads on roads they're
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.100]  not even supposed to put them on.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:48.040]  They break the law and do that.
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:51.240]  Bush signed an executive order, I guess they say that makes it all right.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:56.200]  I guess they could sign an executive order saying the moon was made of cheese.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:00.680]  And then most of these new roads get paid for with taxpayer money, and then Central
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.680]  just gets the money.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.680]  But I wanna get into that, and that's why I originally asked the guys to get you on
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.440]  Dr. Corsi, and I appreciate you coming on.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:09.360]  But what about the overall, I'm gonna go back into it.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:14.040]  I know you're focused on this now, but what about the overall going after the guns?
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:20.160]  I know you've been writing about that, and the Republicans selling out to massive tax
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.160]  increases.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:25.520]  I mean, they're trying to collectivize this country, they know massive tax increases are
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.200]  gonna shut the economy off.
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:30.480]  But I guess that's the plan to get people on welfare.
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:31.480]  Let's first deal with the guns.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:39.320]  I mean, I wrote an article also sent it in to your producers there on the shooting that
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:46.040]  was the recent shooting in the elementary school in Sandy Hook.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:51.640]  And I interviewed some of the top psychiatrists in the world, Dr. David Healy, who was in
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:57.940]  Great Britain, Peter Bragan, Harvard-trained, formerly full-time consultant to the National
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:00.320]  Institute of Mental Health.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:07.200]  And they universally told me that these kids who are shooting in the schools, these incidences
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:15.080]  are almost 90% linked with the medications prescribed to these kids by psychiatrists.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:20.240]  In other words, what happens is the school shootings, a kid, let's say, in school is
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.480]  a little bit difficult to deal with and maybe has some problems at home.
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:30.380]  So immediately, the doctors come in and they diagnose the kid as having some psychological
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:33.420]  disorder or an attention deficit disorder.
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:39.240]  They put him, get him psychiatric treatment and put him on forced medication, Ritalin
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:44.820]  or Prozac or any number of other very powerful drugs.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:51.040]  And these are psychotropic drugs that they produce, especially in these adolescents,
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:57.200]  a form of suicidal and violent outbursts.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:04.200]  So if you look at the incidents that have occurred and track down who these shooters
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:09.760]  are, you're going to find that about 90%, especially the high-profile cases, these kids
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:16.160]  were on medication prescribed by psychiatrists, on behavioral problems, which may or may not
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:21.680]  have been real or may have just been an attempt to control a difficult kid in a school environment.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.960]  And by the way, I covered your article last week.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:28.500]  And when you say 90%, that these scientists, these doctors are being conservative, they
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:33.840]  count the few gang-related shootings where three or four people shoot each other as in
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:34.840]  that.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.000]  And in those cases, they're usually just drug dealers.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.020]  So that's why it goes down to 90.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:47.360]  If you look at the real mass shootings, it's always goth whites or Hispanics who are avowed
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.360]  devil worshipers.
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:54.500]  I mean, every case, they are into the occult, they are avowed devil worshipers, and they
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.080]  are on psychotropic drugs.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.000]  I mean, it's more like 100%.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.500]  In fact, I can't find cases where the real mass shooters where it's like 10, 15, 20 people
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.960]  and it's not gang-related aren't on these drugs.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:09.960]  Well, in fact, Dr. Bragan was particularly good.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:14.240]  He said a lot of these kids are just kids that in a normal environment, you go back
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:19.920]  40, 50 years, first of all, you'd have God in the school, you'd have parents around that
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.720]  could be involved.
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:25.440]  The kid might need some attention, might be a lonely kid.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:29.800]  Now the school, which doesn't really want to deal with the kids in general, in particular,
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:34.040]  they don't want to spend any teacher time, the teachers aren't trained.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:39.000]  So they get the psychiatrist involved, they prescribe these extremely powerful drugs.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.320]  They put them on suicide pills, the insert says cause you to commit mass murder and suicide.
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:49.360]  And these pills are extremely dangerous, psychotropic effects, which produce the suicidal tendencies
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:51.040]  of the violent tendencies.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:57.520]  The kids further withdraw, they withdraw into these video games, which are killing video
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:02.760]  games in this created world of fantasy of killing and violence.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:08.640]  And then when these kids acted out in reality in a school, people are surprised.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:10.400]  I mean, there's no reason to be surprised.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:18.640]  Doctor, doctor, if you study Chinese style mind control and CIA, it's drugging with scenarios.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:24.240]  These video games were designed to create instinctive killing by the US military, non-thinking.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:29.640]  You put them on mind control drugs and put them on a Pentagon killing simulator.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:30.840]  What do you think you're going to get?
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:35.760]  Well, and in fact, a lot of these video games were created by the military in order to increase
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:40.960]  the percentage of soldiers in combat that would actually use lethal force.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:46.720]  It's one of the little, little appreciated secrets of combat going back to the...
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.080]  Break this down, doctor, break it down on the other side, we'll be right back.

[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:05.840]  There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:11.720]  says fool me once, shame on me.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.720]  Shame on you.
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:15.600]  If you fool me, you can't get fooled again.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:21.400]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.440]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:32.760]  You know, Dr. Corsi is probably more qualified to talk about Benghazi than anybody I probably
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:33.760]  know.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.800]  And I should have gotten him on the last few months about that, it's just that it gets
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.000]  lost in the shuffle, and I'm jumping in, chomping at the bit, wanting to back up everything
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.320]  he says because it's so on target.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:48.280]  I wanna get into that and Hillary's feigned garbage and all this other stuff that's going
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:51.520]  on and where he sees America in general going.
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:56.840]  I mean, does he agree with my analysis that it is just runaway train right now?
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.040]  Is there any way to stop the takeover?
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.920]  Why do the globalists think it's their opportunity?
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.820]  Is it a response to seeing an awakening happening?
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:06.560]  They're trying to head us off at the pass.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:07.720]  I wanna get his take on that.
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:14.320]  I wanna go back into the Napa superhighway because it ties in to this tactic now that
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:19.440]  those of us that are awake go, this is ridiculous and discrediting that they announced there's
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.440]  no global government being formed.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:24.920]  But in hundreds of financial papers, they brag how they're forming a world government
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.740]  run by private banks.
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:28.640]  So why are they doing that?
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:32.840]  Well, cuz we're informed the general public folks doesn't know where their state capital
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:33.840]  is.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:38.000]  You have to understand, people think of knowing things as work.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.980]  They never discover that knowing things is addictive and is what really being alive is.
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:50.680]  And so you gotta understand, I mean, the general public is just not even dumb, they're ignorant.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:58.080]  And this tactic of just lying, I mean, at hospitals everywhere, everybody I know goes
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:01.600]  into the hospital and they say, we're not gonna fix your broken leg till you take a
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.600]  flu shot.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:06.280]  And they're like, but you have to render care and they go, we're not going to, get out.
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:12.040]  I mean, it's totally illegal on so many fronts, I mean, I've had lawyers on, it's unbelievable.
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:17.640]  That's what tyranny is, it's a willful criminal oppression.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:20.380]  And they're just doing it.
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:24.220]  And now they're gonna set up armored checkpoints all over the highways to quote, check for
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:26.320]  gang members.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.320]  It's just incredible.
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:31.280]  Dr. Corsi, getting back to what you were gonna talk about with, for those that don't know,
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:36.720]  the statistics from World War I, World War II, on troops wouldn't kill people up close.
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:41.580]  So the Department of Defense developed, and you're right, this is something even foreign
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:43.620]  governments really didn't pick up on for a while.
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:49.480]  It's given the quote, United States the edge, murder simulators, killer simulators, tell
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:50.480]  people about that.
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:56.680]  Well, these original combat video games were developed by the military around the time
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:58.520]  of Vietnam.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:03.680]  Because the little known secret is that in combat, most of the killing in person is done
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.280]  by two or three percent of the troops.
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:10.680]  A lot of troops will not use violence, lethal violence where they can actually see the enemy,
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:13.120]  even when they're in danger themselves.
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:19.280]  So in Vietnam, our troops exposed to these kinds of games were able to get the kill ratio
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.280]  up to about 90%.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:24.960]  90% of the people in combat would be willing to use lethal force.
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:30.280]  And that's where these games started, because psychologically, they engineered desensitization,
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:36.000]  their desensitized process to where killing another human being or using lethal force
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.320]  against another human being is no longer repugnant.
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:44.240]  It becomes acceptable in the frame of behavior for the person to find for themselves.
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:50.960]  That in combination with the type of psychotropic drugs that we are regularly handing out in
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:54.200]  our schools is a formula for disaster.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:37:00.360]  These kids play these games, get programmed for violence, take the drugs, the drugs affect
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.400]  their psychology, their thinking, they become suicidal and violent.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.480]  And then we wonder why we have the incidents of the schools.
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:10.080]  And we wonder why the military has record suicide, and we wonder why the US, the number
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:12.760]  one cause of death now is suicide.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:17.120]  Wasn't in the top 10, 50 years ago, in fact, folks, you can show ABC News, number one cause
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.240]  of unnatural death, now suicide.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:24.920]  You're a nation on suicide mass murder pills, and the social engineers know this full well.
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.720]  Of course they do.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:31.520]  And I want to skip to, with the time we've got, I've been writing again about the economics.
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:38.120]  I have an article out today that Ben Bernanke, in the time he's been in the Fed, which started
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:46.600]  in February 1, 2006, on December 12th, which is when they announced this QE4, another round
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.920]  of buying our own debt.
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:57.760]  That period of time, from 2006 to December 12th, 2012, Bernanke doubled the amount of
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:59.320]  national debt.
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:07.840]  We went from $8.13 trillion to $16.4 trillion.
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:13.560]  And this is, again, another conscious process of destroying the United States.
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:21.840]  The QE4, Quantitative Easing 4, which is the economist's term for it, means that we're
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:31.240]  going to be buying monthly $85 billion of our own treasury securities and mortgage backed
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:39.520]  securities, which keeps interest rates artificially low, but is essentially creating so much liquidity
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:45.720]  that the dollar is becoming debased, and it's setting up the precondition for hyperinflation.
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:48.460]  Hyperinflation is now an inevitability.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:50.120]  It's built into the system.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:55.940]  And again, the economists know this, because in the crisis of hyperinflation, crisis of
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:39:00.840]  all these mountains of debt, the Americans will give up freedom, they'll move into an
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:03.080]  international environment, they'll allow the-
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:08.560]  And by the way, you worked in banking at the highest level, so again, you are uniquely
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.720]  able to speak to this.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:10.720]  What's the timeframe?
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:11.720]  How bad is it going to get?
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:16.560]  Well, it's going to get, first of all, we're going to be at a point where we may double
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:23.240]  again the national debt, not within, may not take us six years this time.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:26.080]  We may do it within three or four years.
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:31.160]  Certainly, we're going to be over $20 trillion by 2014.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:37.760]  And when we get over $20 trillion, remember, our gross national product is under $16 trillion.
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:38.800]  Unbelievable.
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:46.400]  So by the end of 2014, which is in two years, when we're coming up with the next congressional
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:51.400]  election, I expect us to be in another economic crisis of hyperinflation.
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.780]  And this whole deal of fiscal cliff is a fiction.
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:59.260]  We went over the fiscal cliff a long time ago.
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:05.420]  This recent legislation did nothing to solve the fiscal crisis of the United States.
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:10.280]  We actually have more spending in the bill that was just signed, just passed, in this
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:12.560]  emergency fashion.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.160]  And the idea that people, again, lies were rampant.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:20.120]  Obama was saying that no middle class taxes were going to be increased.
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:26.240]  77% of Americans who pay taxes are going to have an increase because of the phasing out
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:33.800]  of the 2% relief that was granted on the FICA reductions on payroll taxes.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.160]  That's going back in.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:40.600]  Even though this lie was told, Obama will say, well, I didn't mean that.
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:44.680]  But people are still going to get smaller take home pay, and they can judge for themselves
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.520]  whether they were lied to.
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:48.640]  The federal government lies to us regularly.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:56.040]  The Obama now lies boldly and doesn't even get called for it by the mainstream media.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:01.600]  And this whole idea of increasing our debt to a proportion that's unprecedented in the
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:06.440]  history of the world, you know, buying our own debt, I mean, you have to get your mind
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:12.640]  around the Treasury is issuing debt and we are buying it in the Federal Reserve.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:14.640]  It's so insane.
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:17.840]  And at some point or other, you can't keep doing this.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.320]  You can't keep printing money.
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.960]  This is just blatantly printing money.
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:27.600]  And the liquidity may boost the stock market, but eventually, like the Weimar Republic,
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:33.720]  you get into hyperinflation, and the authorities doing this, including Ben Bernanke, know that
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.880]  it is inevitable that they're going to debase the dollar.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:40.080]  In fact, it's a plan to debase the dollar.
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:43.600]  You can't look at it any other way.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:48.880]  Now I wrote, I mean, I've also got, I sent in the links, I just published a book on Obama's
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:56.100]  plan to bankrupt the United States, and this goes to the Cloward-Piven theory, and I really
[01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:58.480]  think it's critical people understand what the Cloward-
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:01.760]  And we're gonna put your new book up, and we've been showing WorldNetDaily and the information.
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:05.240]  In fact, I wanna get this book, I haven't read it yet, we've carried your other books,
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:10.240]  but I know this is gonna be powerful because I know they're game playing as well, and what's
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:15.140]  incredible is, and I know you know about this, you've written about it, they brag that they're
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:16.760]  bankrupting us.
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:19.940]  Communists don't bankrupt things on accident.
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:24.280]  We always say communists are bad managers, and quote, things don't work.
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:29.280]  Because of the incredible production of the last 100 years and science, even in a communist
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:35.160]  system that wasn't run by devils, it'd be horrible and it would be unfair, but everything
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.700]  wouldn't collapse.
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:39.920]  They collapsed Ukraine and Poland on purpose.
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.680]  This is not a secret.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:47.220]  They collapsed China and killed between 60 and 80 million people, they debate the numbers,
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:50.160]  to radically transform forever.
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:52.940]  They understand you've gotta break eggs to make an omelet.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:58.040]  It's about the control, and so the goal is going well.
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:02.960]  More people in prison, more people on welfare, paying to ship General Motors to China.
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:07.680]  I mean, this is a plan, and I've read the review of your book, I know it breaks down
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:09.920]  where they say it's their plan.
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:15.840]  So explain to people, California when they raise taxes over and over again, that's meant
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.080]  to bankrupt the state.
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.920]  I mean, explain this to people.
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:24.360]  Concord and Piven were two sociologists at Columbia when Obama was there, when Brzezinski
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:25.560]  was there.
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:32.640]  And their whole idea was that to destroy capitalism, you create social welfare programs, all the
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:39.360]  unemployment insurance, the Obama phones, the entire list of programs where the government
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:42.280]  is paying checks to people.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:48.320]  And you build this system to the point where it is so huge, you've gotta raise the tax
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:55.480]  base in order to pay these welfare payments, social welfare payments, entitlements, that
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:02.240]  the system collapses because the taxes destroy the economic activity, the tax base decreases,
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:04.520]  the system goes into bankruptcy.
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:09.100]  And then the, Cloward and Piven, the sociologists said that this is the time when we really
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:17.000]  have the opportunity to create a true socialist, read communist state, in which the principles
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:23.480]  of social justice, meaning destroying private property, destroying the family, having government
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:28.480]  control of every aspect of your life, having the bureaucrats make all decisions, including
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:34.800]  death panels on health insurance, 100% government control of all the means of production.
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:38.640]  This is what the communist dream has been, and the Cloward and Piven theory is a way
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:47.880]  to make the Democratic Party essentially advocate the socialist themes, welfare.
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:52.200]  We're trying to help you, we care about you, want unemployment insurance.
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:57.240]  And then by putting the tax burden to these unreasonable levels, having debt go beyond
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:01.760]  the ability to pay the debt off, the system goes into bankruptcy, collapses, and then
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:07.120]  the ashes, out of the ashes is born a true socialist communist state.
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.120]  That's the goal, that's Obama's-
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:13.640]  And they're gonna look to the 90% that don't have jobs anymore from over taxation and say,
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:19.400]  we gotta kill the old people, they're already saying this in slate and Soros outfits.
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:24.600]  I mean, it's so diabolical, and remember doctor, they always said, there's no death panels
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:25.980]  or like it's in the bill.
[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:28.840]  No, there's not, there's no NAFTA highway.
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:34.520]  What do you make of them coming out and saying that Israelis don't own guns and they don't
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:35.520]  arm teachers?
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:41.240]  I mean, the level of lying, these people make the Politburo look honest.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:49.160]  In fact, the Democrats were gonna propose this legislation, in themselves own guns that
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:51.320]  are protected by guns.
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:55.320]  If you go into a federal building, you try to go into the US Congress, you're gonna go
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:46:00.840]  through metal detectors, you're gonna go through all kinds of federal agencies with badges,
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:04.400]  with guns, examining everything you've got before you get in that building.
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:07.120]  Why don't you know where you're gonna go?
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:14.160]  The bureaucrats that want these gun-free environments don't themselves operate in a gun-free environment
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:16.080]  because they know how dangerous it would be.
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:18.480]  Well, they're mafia, mafia always wants to disarm its slaves.
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:21.520]  Here's my question, what is the general prognosis?
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:26.680]  Am I right, and Larry Pratt saying this is the worst assault ever, Ron Paul, I mean,
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:29.040]  I want your view on this and then your analysis.
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:35.480]  How bad is it because they now look gleeful and are attacking on every front and the Republican
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:40.280]  leadership is collapsing and just saying, yes, this is what we're gonna do because the
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:43.400]  foreign banks are buying both sides.
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:51.520]  The GOP is in disarray, the globalists and the socialists who, the far left, the bill
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:56.640]  of errors crowd has stolen the leadership of the Democratic Party.
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:03.600]  This is not the Democratic Party of Jack Kennedy or Hubert Humphrey or Harry Truman.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.240]  That party's dead.
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:12.880]  This is the radical left, the socialists, read communists, hijacking the Democratic
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:16.240]  Party and putting their agenda in the name of progressive.
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:21.480]  I saw another slight article today calling to get rid of our free speech.
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:24.360]  I mean, these people are monsters.
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:32.000]  Diets are gonna be left and right, you get a Sandy Hook coming on immediately, the new
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:37.080]  world order agenda jumps on this for gun legislation, the worst possible thing.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:42.640]  And then when the NRA tries to hold a press conference, they get ridiculed by the mainstream
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:48.360]  media, there's demonstrations, the acting up, the agenda is not heard, the lies are
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:53.280]  being told, yes, teachers are armed in Israel.
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:48:01.280]  Yes, if you walk around Israel, there are automatic weapons being held by off duty military
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:02.960]  in uniform.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:07.200]  It's a very militarized environment because it's the only way it's safe.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:13.080]  And in fact, if you do create these gun free zones, the truth is like Chicago, you're gonna
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:15.560]  create a free killing zone.
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.600]  And then they bring the military in as the answer.
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:18.600]  See how they do it?
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:23.040]  They take the citizens' guns, it becomes a crime system, then they bring in troops, which
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.800]  is they're now doing.
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:29.560]  Rely on the government to protect you, which is exactly, our founding fathers' advice is
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:33.040]  do not rely on the government to do anything for you.
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:34.880]  Let me ask you this, are they going to win?
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.360]  I mean, how bad is it?
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:42.840]  Well, it's gonna be, it's the closest to the globalist and the socialist communists left
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:47.000]  winning, and they're using the Saul Alinsky agenda.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.560]  Obama is gonna, again, you've gotta read these two ebooks I wrote, the one on the Saul Alinsky,
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:56.960]  the evil genius behind Obama, and Obama's plan to bankrupt the USA, the Cloward-Pippin
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:00.280]  theory, cuz it explains what they're doing.
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:06.400]  They're using the class warfare, resentment against the rich, we've gotta tax the rich.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:12.760]  Even with Obama getting this agreement on the fiscal cliff, he's already saying in videotape
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:19.940]  presentations to his constituency, the Obama for America crowd, that he hasn't taxed, which
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:21.880]  are still not paying their fair share.
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:22.880]  They won't have-
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:26.160]  Howard Dean came out and said the poorest people need to pay more taxes.
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:32.240]  Well, in fact, the point is that the socialist agenda, nobody in the end owns any private
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:33.240]  property.
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:37.720]  Except the master bureaucrats who are exempt from all the rules.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:43.440]  And are protected by the military, do not themselves live in gun-free zones, don't give
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:45.840]  up their weapons, but in fact-
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:49.800]  No, no, they all have bodyguards, that's a status symbol of them.
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:57.920]  Bodyguards, go into a federal building that you don't have to go through a metal detector
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:49:58.920]  with badges and guns-
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:03.680]  Michael Moore has five to six bodyguards every time I've seen him, it appears Morgan has
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:06.760]  armed bodyguards, I mean, it's all on record.
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:13.880]  Hypocrisy and the lying of the New World Order and this Bill Ayers left, that Obama left,
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:15.560]  has never been greater.
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:20.480]  They're lying about everything saying, although we don't have a NAFTA superhighway, there's
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:22.320]  no public-private partnerships here.
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:28.880]  Then you look and you find there's $20 billion of deals that Governor Perry has signed with
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:30.040]  Central and Spain.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:36.280]  No, no, they bragged in the AP years ago, they said Perry's just going ahead in chunks.
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:41.520]  I mean, it's not a secret, they just laugh at us and incredible, incredible, just stay
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:45.520]  there Doc, we gotta get a break, I wanna come back and get more into just the economy.
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.960]  I mean, is there any way to turn this around?
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:48.960]  How bad is it gonna get?
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.400]  And then we'll have the third hour with a bunch of special reports we're gonna premiere
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:58.360]  here and a bunch of news and so much more, we just gotta get the word out.
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:02.400]  These people are such authoritarians, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:06.900]  Big business has discovered the preparedness market and that makes it difficult to know
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:09.120]  where to go and who to trust.

[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:04.280]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:05.280]  Box.
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:08.240]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:13.040]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:17.360]  House at a time when only the President could obtain its world class healer.
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:22.920]  Now 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:33.140]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:34.280]  normal cell.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:37.960]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:42.040]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:09.240]  Hi, I'm Pastor Ginny and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:11.240]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:16.920]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:21.680]  of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs and other
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:22.840]  tissues behave.
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:26.840]  I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I've been conditioned
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:27.840]  to believe.
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:33.640]  I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.800]  me with amazing health and joy.

[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:14.720]  We've got an extremely powerful video piece we did to counter Mayor Bloomberg's piece
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:19.120]  with all the different actors saying turn your guns in.
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:23.400]  One of our listeners, again, I'm proud that our listeners are so active, put out a video
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:27.780]  showing how each actor in there is in these movies involved in gratuitous mass murder
[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:30.240]  and shooting.
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:33.720]  Which then anti-gunners who aren't even gun owners, cuz there's not just the predatory
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:37.480]  anti-gunners who know they wanna disarm us and make us slaves.
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:42.320]  There's folks who've never had guns and they think of guns like Hollywood that every time
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:47.320]  a gun's out somebody's oozing someone and they're real scared of them.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:49.920]  And Hollywood helps do that.
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:53.740]  And one of our listeners put out a video that's had millions of views cuz DrudgeReport.com
[01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:57.440]  linked to it and then Fox News picked it up and all these other channels.
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:03.140]  That's what I keep telling listeners, I'm nobody special folks and I've reached 15 million
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:06.540]  people a week now one way or another, okay?
[01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:10.160]  People like Dr. Corsi, who's well researched and smart, he reaches millions every week
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:12.680]  in interviews and his books.
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:17.080]  One of our listeners, cuz I went to his channel and saw that he listens to the show and some
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:22.920]  of his videos, went and did something that's been seen by tens of millions now.
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:26.880]  And we're gonna put a video out that hopefully will get seen by millions that really counters
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.140]  Bloomberg.
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:30.040]  It's up to you though.
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:34.120]  And just thank God for Drudge, listen, I gotta say something Dr. Corsi, I'm not just kissing
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:37.040]  the rumpus of DrudgeReport.com.
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:44.560]  I've been tracking it, and more and more, it's WorldNet daily, it's Infowars, but we're
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:50.560]  like Junior when it comes to really just every time Drudge is able to take our information
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:54.720]  and others and his research and really force it out there.
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:59.280]  And I see the system always demonizing Drudge, because they don't like it.
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:05.440]  And I think it's a tale and an example, an allegory of the fact that we can win.
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:09.880]  If we get aggressive now, so let me ask you solutions in this segment and five and in
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:11.760]  the next hour, I know you've got to go.
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:14.780]  What can we do to really beat these people?
[01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:20.340]  Because even a lot of folks don't like socialism, but their jobs have been shipped overseas,
[01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:22.340]  they're disabled.
[01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:26.400]  And Obama's gonna give them money until he fully takes over, then he's gonna euthanize
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:27.400]  you.
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:28.640]  What can we do as solutions, Dr. Corsi?
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:34.240]  Well, I think first of all, you're right about Drudge, Drudge is doing yeoman's work, and
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:36.240]  so are you, Alex.
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:41.280]  We're in the battle, we're doing it every day as well at WND.
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:47.600]  The weapon we've got is the truth, and we've got to keep developing and presenting the
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:49.720]  truth to the American people.
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:54.520]  We've got the advantages of being able to communicate with millions of people through
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:59.800]  the internet, we've got the ability to get the word out, and people are reading and paying
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:00.800]  attention.
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:05.960]  In the next few years, we're gonna have to learn how to even use social media more effectively,
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:11.880]  how to use all these techniques of reaching people one by one in their homes, knowing
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:14.080]  who our listeners are.
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:19.320]  There's great advances coming, and the ability, I believe, to technologically reach people
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:23.960]  and communicate with people individually, but in large numbers.
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:28.880]  But the advantage we've got is the truth, and I think if we keep going back to it, I
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:33.400]  mean, every one of the articles I write, Alex, I footnote, I've got all kinds, you can go
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:35.320]  look at the original sources.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:39.920]  That's what made the Articles of the North American Union, going back to when I was writing
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:47.080]  the late, great USA in 2005, 2006, so powerful, was I linked to their own documents, the government's
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:48.080]  own documents.
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:54.680]  If you look at the article I have on Bernanke increasing our debt, I linked to the Federal
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:59.640]  Reserve minutes in which that is announced, which is a document that's boring, most people
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:04.640]  don't want to read it, but when you see it, it's startling, because there, the Federal
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:12.040]  Reserve is telling you they're going to buy $85 billion a month, it's staggering.
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:18.200]  It's like, we're going to buy a trillion dollars of our own debt, and as if that's, you know,
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:23.160]  buying your own debt is like having a, you know, a printing press in your basement, so
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:26.560]  checks come in, don't worry about it, we'll just keep printing money and send out, pay
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:27.560]  the bills.
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:32.240]  Well, it's a globalist, they get real goods for that, and then we get handed the debt
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:34.240]  when most of its derivatives stay there.
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:37.680]  Again, we're bailing the bankers out, we're going to do five more minutes, I want to hear
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:38.680]  more solutions.
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:43.680]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:53.760 --> 02:00:05.640]  Aging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:10.440]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:11.440]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:13.560]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:23.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:24.480]  What is your own course?
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:25.480]  He's got to leave in about four or five minutes.
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:29.480]  He's got another interview coming up and again, I've been covering the whole field here, throwing
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:34.280]  stuff at him, but finishing up with solutions.
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:40.720]  I guess the solution is the truth, as you said, and knowing what their plans are.
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:41.720]  Bankrupting America.
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:44.080]  How do you expect things to go?
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:50.240]  Sure people are waking up, but the power structure is accelerating things in your gut.
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:54.760]  How do you see things ending and in your gut, are you the most concerned you've ever been?
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:58.000]  I'm the most concerned I've ever been.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:05.720]  And we're going to have a series of crises that are produced that the only solution offered
[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:12.520]  is more government control by both parties, Democrats and Republicans alike.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:17.840]  This is where the Tea Party has got to recognize that the Republican Party is not necessarily
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:21.920]  a natural home for a conservative movement.
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:27.400]  It's not only exposing the truth, which we've got to do, but it's exposing the hypocrisy
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:30.560]  of the socialists, the communists, the Obamas.
[02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:35.040]  Obama lives, he's talking about the rich don't pay their fair share.
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:41.920]  Well, Obama's living a life that would make most kings and queens in history pale in comparison
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:44.560]  to the privileges he gives himself and his family.
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:46.360]  We've got to expose this.
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:51.280]  Michael Moore does not live a carbon efficient life.
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:52.280]  None of these people.
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:59.800]  Michael Moore is protected by weapons as is Nancy Pelosi, as is Senator Feinstein and
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:01.360]  Chuck Schumer.
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:05.120]  All these people go into a federal building to work all day where you go through a metal
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:10.360]  detector and there's guards all over the place to protect them.
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:17.200]  The hypocrisy is what exposes the New World Order, the lies and the hypocrisy.
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:22.880]  The crises are what I'm concerned about because the capability of producing, people got to
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:28.360]  understand this power pivot theory, that the engineered bankruptcy that we're in, this
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:32.120]  expansion of the entitlement programs is a plan.
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:36.200]  It's a plan to cause capitalism to crumble so people will give up freedom.
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:41.760]  And then they blame capitalism when we've left capitalism and this is crony fascist
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:43.080]  socialism.
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:44.880]  Removal of God from everywhere.
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:47.040]  This is a major theme.
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:53.080]  The school in which the kid who's on, you know, psychiatrically prescribed drugs, playing
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:56.760]  all day video games at his home, comes into that school.
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:00.400]  You couldn't even use the word God in that school without being arrested.
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:04.720]  But then Obama would pray once it came time, they still give us the old thing every once
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:08.320]  in a while like it's a treat they give us to then punch our buttons.
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:11.600]  It's all masterfully done and you get back to that.
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:14.120]  When you remove God, the devil comes in.
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:18.280]  You know, it's funny all these killers, they're not atheists, they're devil worshipers.
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:24.280]  Play the God theme like music on, you know, in Oregon to get our emotions going.
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:27.560]  So we say, oh, isn't it horrible, we've got to get the guns out of the schools.
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:31.800]  No, you've got to get armed guards in the schools.
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:33.400]  You got to get these kids.
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:37.860]  So the teachers in the teachers union who don't want to spend any time dealing with
[02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:43.040]  problem children, can't just send them off to a psychiatrist and give them Ritalin or
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:44.320]  Prozac or some other-
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:48.920]  Well, look, I'll say this, it'd be better to put kids in a boot camp to get their butts
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:54.160]  kicked than assault them with Prozac and Ritalin that literally destroys their hearts and brains
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:55.160]  and organs.
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:56.580]  And again, that's the problem.
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:04:00.320]  When I did stuff wrong, I got my butt whipped, the coaches whipped my butt, they'd make me
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:01.840]  run till I threw up.
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:04.480]  And thank God they did, or I'd have probably been in prison.
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:05.480]  These kids need discipline.
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:10.320]  And the social engineers, Dr. Spock and all them, they bragged, they knew, they knew what
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:11.720]  they were doing.
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:13.560]  They knew exactly what they're doing.
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:20.200]  This is no longer freedom, it's no longer producing character, it's about control.
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:21.200]  Producing control.
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:27.000]  So those in power, the teachers union, the socialists running the Democratic Party, they
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.200]  control everyone.
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:34.200]  And whenever they want more control or more power, they create a crisis, a bunch of people
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:40.400]  are killed, people are starving, they bring out God, roll out God for 20 minutes.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:43.720]  Barack Obama's not gonna let God be on the horizon.
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:45.800]  Watch how many times he refers to God in the second inaugural.
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:48.200]  No, he says we are not a Christian nation.
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:49.480]  God bless you, sir.
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:51.520]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:53.200]  The battle for the republic is now.
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:54.520]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:55.520]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:56.520]  Keep up the fight.
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:57.520]  I will, sir.
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:05:00.920]  We'll be back with masses of key information.
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:03.960]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:08.960]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:15.000]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  to the global takeover.
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.680]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:35.520]  The Ktor Handcrank Generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:36.520]  in the field.
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:39.440]  Strategic Relocation, third edition by Joel Skousen.

[02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:58.000]  We're getting prepared.
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000]  Are you?
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.000]  Infowarsshop.com.
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:05.460]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.
[02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:06.840]  Don't be one of them.
[02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:11.520]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:12.520]  solution.
[02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:16.340]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be
[02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:21.360]  used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold and food poisoning and help improve wound
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:22.360]  healing.

[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:31.800]  the causes of many serious diseases such as strep, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus and other
[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:33.200]  harmful pathogens.
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:38.080]  This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:42.200]  hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:45.880]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:49.720]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

[02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:20.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:26.360]  Alright we've had listeners begging for this more than anything I've probably ever seen
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:33.080]  and because I know at a sick level it's entertaining but it's also revealing and the incredible
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:37.560]  thing is we sit here and talk about them and then they still call in but some of them have
[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:39.040]  a halfway valid point.
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:41.680]  They go, look, I don't like Mitt Romney.
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:42.680]  I know he's evil.
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:43.680]  I know Obama's evil.
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:50.040]  He's a lesser of two evils but those are people that have, in my view, a fallacy in their
[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:55.120]  understanding and they don't understand what we're saying but when you get real Obama supporters
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:09:01.800]  calling in, they say you're racist, you're bad, basically the talking points but they
[02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:02.800]  really believe it.
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:06.480]  I mean, they're freaked out, they're mad, they think I'm trying to keep them from some
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:13.280]  wonderful world under collectivism under the eugenicist because this isn't just collectivism.
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:19.080]  It's eugenics run collectivism but see all collectivism in the last 200 years has been
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:24.680]  eugenics run because the British government ran this big empire and they made a big study
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:28.000]  on record with a whole bunch of different scientists.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:32.720]  That's why all the major sciences came out of eugenics the last 160 years.
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:33.960]  We cover this in the film Endgame.
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:38.280]  It's free online, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement and it's the key to understanding
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:46.040]  what's happening that they wanted to domesticate people and basically create a false reality.
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:51.000]  Create an artificial system where you can't think outside that box and never escape because
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:55.640]  they want that control box so they can reduce your numbers and people say, well, they haven't
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:57.400]  done a very good job of it.
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:04.480]  There are different paths and different forces in the world.
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:06.480]  That's the thing, the globalist aren't all powerful.
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:12.600]  They will be if they get that global technocracy in place, which they're really pushing for.
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:15.500]  They could easily fail, they failed before.
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:19.940]  They admit they're behind, that's why they're working so hard right now.
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:22.700]  And some of you will go, well, there are too many people, have you seen how dumb the general
[02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:23.700]  public is?
[02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:25.760]  Okay, but you need to understand something.
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:28.520]  Yes, there's truth to some of the eugenics argument.
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:31.920]  And I've never really talked about this on air, this is such a complex issue and I wanna
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:33.920]  make a whole film about it.
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:40.520]  But when you really look at it, they've been there sabotaging things all the way, doing
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:53.660]  things that actually increase the population and increased the population's systems, forms
[02:10:53.660 --> 02:10:59.040]  of their systems to where it was more destructive on the environment.
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:00.040]  It's incredibly complex.
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:06.520]  I shouldn't even have gotten off into all this because the point is, they're trying
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:12.380]  to dumb people down and they want more dumb people than smart people until they get control
[02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:15.400]  and then they're gonna wipe almost everybody out.
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:16.680]  It's all divide and conquer.
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:21.540]  It's all play nation states off against each other, races, religions off against each other.
[02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:24.240]  It's all a destabilization program.
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:26.280]  I forgot to get Corsi's take on Benghazi.
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:29.640]  We sent him back up next week for 30 minutes just on Benghazi.
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:31.080]  I forgot to get to that.
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:38.400]  The point is, is that it all goes back to eugenics and the government is attacking and
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:40.640]  going after smart people.
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:47.720]  You have to understand that eugenics is sold to yuppies and to intelligentsia like, hey,
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:50.480]  there's too many dumb people and they cost too much money.
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:53.360]  Let's go ahead and abort all their kids and get rid of them.
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:55.320]  It's the humane thing to do.
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:57.200]  Let's tell people we're liberals, we're really eugenicists.
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:58.360]  Okay, we'll do that.
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:02.440]  No, I understand, act non-threatening, exactly, sneak up on them.
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:04.360]  All right, let's do that.
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:10.440]  Meanwhile, the entire system, as if that isn't bad enough, is really targeted at smart people
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:15.360]  who aren't part of the power structure or a surplus of smart people.
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:22.600]  Or a surplus of aggressive people who they use to project their force, but who they fear.
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:28.680]  So like a cannon after a war, they decommission and spike and cut up into pieces and melt
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:29.680]  down.
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:32.520]  They do that to our military after they've used you, and now they're just going towards
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:36.280]  robots and drones where you're not even needed.
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:41.000]  And then they write books to the heads of the big computer companies, write books and
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:44.160]  articles in Wired Magazine how they're doing it to you.
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:48.000]  I mean, it's not my opinion is what's frustrating about this.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  I would have rather gone in the last 100 years, truly industrialized the third world equitably
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:13:00.560]  to try to build up a system, have technology export that actually built up the first world,
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:03.600]  while empowering the third world.
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:09.520]  Basically no federal welfare, only local welfare, cuz I've studied economic systems at work.
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:14.920]  But those systems create high education, true education, not indoctrination.
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:20.120]  Notice the more education we get, the dumber we get, the more ignorant.
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:25.480]  Again I said I'd take Obama calls and I just go off into a trillion different issues.
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:27.560]  I really want good things for humanity.
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:29.760]  I really have studied history.
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:34.100]  It's not hard, it's not like I have my opinion about what works and they have their opinion
[02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:35.100]  about what works.
[02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:38.000]  They don't want collectivism to empower you.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:43.200]  They want collectivism so they have you under their control paying your electric bill and
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:50.840]  paying for your tiny house, your agenda 21 jail cell, so that they can dictate you're
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:56.000]  gonna take shots that are gonna actuary when you die to kill you early.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:02.800]  And so they can fully control your life and use you and expend you as a cog because they
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:06.220]  are a religion, the priest of power.
[02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:13.060]  Their whole religion is about organizing groups of people.
[02:14:13.060 --> 02:14:16.760]  And I don't like it, and I don't like them.
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:23.080]  I mean these globalists are very, very sick people and it is the ultimate sin in the British
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:24.560]  Commission on Population.
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:30.040]  I'm gonna give the number out only for Obama supporters here in a moment and call in on
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:37.320]  their Obama phones.
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:39.880]  I'll just go ahead and give the number out now cuz I'll keep pontificating and the whole
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:40.880]  hour will go by.
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:43.760]  I got a bunch of news to get to and some incredible videos we're gonna premiere.
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:45.120]  One of them is absolutely amazing.
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:48.460]  I hope you're a prisonplanet.tv viewer, but for radio listeners, it'll be posted later
[02:14:48.460 --> 02:14:53.200]  this afternoon at mfallwars.com and prisonplanet.com, I wanna get it out to everybody.
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:15:01.040]  It's gonna be the featured video on the YouTube channel and it'll be in HD at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:07.360]  How am I gonna save the fluoride heads that have probably had 150 shots in their life?
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.640]  Let's say an average 30-year-old inner city woman, black, white, Hispanic, probably had
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:15.920]  150 shots on average, been drinking higher levels of fluoride.
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:19.360]  They've done national studies where in the minority areas it's a lot higher cuz they're
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:21.400]  putting it even higher in your area.
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:23.840]  And that's how actuated out this is, folks.
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:27.360]  And the people in the water district don't ask questions, they're just told to distribute
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:28.360]  it this way.
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:31.280]  That's why some have blown the whistle.
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:36.800]  See, I was able five years ago to start beating the drum about how they're adding radioactive
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:42.200]  isotopes in the so-called sodium fluoride from the phosphate mines.
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:45.380]  It's toxic waste they'd have to store, so they make you pay for it.
[02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:48.480]  Some cities, millions a year, like Austin.
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:52.300]  And I knew in the studies that the stuff they buy out of Florida, the stuff they buy out
[02:15:52.300 --> 02:16:02.080]  of Colorado, the stuff they buy out of Mongolia, China, is full of five or six different radioactive
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:03.080]  isotopes.
[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:11.760]  I mean, you want kidney cancer, you want bladder cancer, baby, get ready.
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:15.220]  I mean, in some studies, it gives you over 50 times chance of getting, and that's why
[02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:16.360]  that's all off the chart.
[02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:19.880]  So I just get up here, did reports, talked about it, read the ingredients.
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:24.280]  Took me probably 30, 40 times talking about it to get suddenly local newscasts all over
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:25.280]  the country.
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:26.280]  You can look these up.
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:30.720]  Would go and would stick a Geiger counter up against the pipes, and they would just
[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:32.000]  go off the chart.
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.260]  And the government spun it, it must be radiation in the aquifer, which is true.
[02:16:36.260 --> 02:16:42.360]  They're mining limestone for phosphates, where they then take the toxic waste derivative
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:43.740]  and put it in our water.
[02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:47.640]  It's the same thing that's in some of the aquifers, but in very low levels.
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:53.520]  So see, their spin, I tried my hardest to make sure you wouldn't get killed, but I can't,
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:55.240]  I can't help you.
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:57.300]  Because they're just gonna hit you with a disinfo off.
[02:16:57.300 --> 02:17:00.360]  The feds all come in, it turned out Rick Perry made it secret.
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:06.600]  As soon as I started exposing it, signed an executive order, in fact, it was an executive
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:10.880]  directive to keep the findings, cuz the state started investigating when I talked about
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:11.880]  it.
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:15.160]  They put an order on it, blocking it out, then folks blew the whistle inside.
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:19.860]  See, there are good people in government corporations, they just don't have intelligence.
[02:17:19.860 --> 02:17:24.960]  And by intelligence, I don't mean native electrochemical intelligence in their cerebral cortex.
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:27.060]  I mean, they don't know.
[02:17:27.060 --> 02:17:29.720]  They would never give people radioactive isotopes.
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:31.720]  So they hear me, they go, this guy's crazy.
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:36.940]  They go stick a Geiger counter up to it and to a bag of fluoride coming in out of China.
[02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:41.400]  And it's 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 times.
[02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:43.680]  I mean, it's pegging the meters.
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:48.140]  It's Chernobyl.
[02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:51.640]  And now you see the newscast, yeah, our water's radioactive in Austin.
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:52.640]  We don't know why.
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:53.640]  Don't worry about it.
[02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:54.640]  Our water, all outside Austin.
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:56.280]  So it's radioactive in Houston.
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:17:58.360]  It's radioactive in San Antonio.
[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:01.560]  All over the country, radioactive, even when you're not even getting it from aquifers.
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:03.080]  They're like, well, how is this happening?
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:04.500]  We're getting it out of a lake.
[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:06.280]  They're adding it.
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:07.280]  They're adding it.
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:08.840]  And it's on record, they're adding it.
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:13.680]  I mean, if a cop pulls me over for no reason, if I said they're putting radiation in your
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:16.640]  water, he'll go, I don't care, here's the ticket.
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:20.200]  I mean, it's like, how do you, and it's the same thing with Obama supporters.
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:22.040]  I get up here and criticize Obama.
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:24.200]  They think I'm saying I'm for Mitt Romney.
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:29.080]  No, the fix was in like a Don King boxing match, that that's the winner.
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:30.120]  That's the puppet.
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:31.120]  That's the guy.
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:32.120]  That's what he's gonna do.
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:36.720]  But then they still tear down liberty by having Romney claim he's for good things.
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:42.400]  So that can be discredited through fraud, so he won't defend it.
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:46.240]  So see, then it forces you to defend Romney when he's saying, no, small businesses did
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:47.240]  build America.
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:50.240]  But he's still a bad guy, but I'm forced to defend him.
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:53.200]  And then you hear that, you go, you're defending Romney.
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:57.640]  Listen, I'm not defending Romney when I tell you there's radiation being put in your water.
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:18:58.640]  Radioactive isotopes.
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:03.480]  See, this is what's so crazy about this, is can you grasp that in your brains if you're
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:07.160]  an Obama supporter, or if you're a right winger or whatever?
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:08.880]  Do you understand the fix is in?
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:11.580]  Do you get that through your head?
[02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:16.020]  The system wants to suck the energy out of you while they get ready to go to the next
[02:19:16.020 --> 02:19:18.380]  wave robotic system.
[02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:20.240]  They don't need us anymore.
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:25.000]  They say you used to be cheap, life used to be cheap, now you're a negative.
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:28.800]  And Brzezinski in a speech he gave a few months ago, you can pull it up, said, I saw it even
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:29.800]  quoted in the news.
[02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:35.080]  He said, he said 20 years ago, to paraphrase, we find the exact quote, he goes, it was easier
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:41.480]  to just spend a million dollars or a billion dollars to brainwash people to follow what
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:42.480]  you said.
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:44.760]  Now it's just cheaper to kill them.
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:51.880]  See, this is what I'm trying to get across to you, folks.
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:52.880]  You're under attack.
[02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:59.480]  800, I'll give the number out when we come back, 800-25-99231, Obama supporters.
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:07.480]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:12.560]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:19.520]  front Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:20.520]  your help.
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:25.760]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:31.800]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:35.260]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:41.480]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:48.920]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:50.680]  and ultimate extermination.
[02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:52.840]  The war is here.
[02:20:52.840 --> 02:21:00.360]  It's an Infowar, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:04.600]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:09.680]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:11.720]  This is really scary stuff.
[02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:16.680]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.
[02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:20.960]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed
[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:24.200]  piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:27.520]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:31.400]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.
[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:37.080]  That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat
[02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:39.880]  and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:45.720]  Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is plus
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:50.160]  discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:55.240]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone
[02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:56.240]  forever.
[02:21:56.240 --> 02:22:00.040]  Again, that's weirddevice.com.
[02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:04.240]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:06.760]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:11.800]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many
[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:14.820]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:14.820 --> 02:22:19.120]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[02:22:19.120 --> 02:22:23.040]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:26.800]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:28.480]  from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:32.200]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:37.240]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:38.640]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:43.360]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:48.160]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:51.280]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:56.040]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:57.040]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:23:02.840]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:03.840]  Box.
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:06.760]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:11.560]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:15.720]  House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:21.120]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:26.520]  Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:31.660]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[02:23:31.660 --> 02:23:32.800]  normal cell.
[02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:36.480]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:40.560]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:48.520]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:55.880]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.
[02:23:55.880 --> 02:23:56.880]  Protect your immune system.
[02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:58.880]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:07.280]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:10.800]  I'm Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:18.640]  Yeah, if you type in radioactive isotopes found in water supplies, you'll see newscasts
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:22.200]  all over the country.
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:26.360]  And guys also type in, as I mentioned, it's been a while since I've covered this, type
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:33.920]  in Rick Perry covered up radiation water or Rick Perry ordered radiation and water cover
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:34.920]  up.
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:40.880]  And again, my point is we're able to get a story out and go, by the way, they're putting
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:44.080]  radiation and radioactive isotopes in your water.
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:47.680]  We're able to get that out, but then they just give it a cover story.
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:51.440]  I mean, we know where it's coming from and they have all these investigations.
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:52.440]  Where's it coming from?
[02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:53.440]  Where's it coming from?
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:57.760]  And they've got enough globalist managers out there that no newscast ever said, it's
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:01.920]  in the bag of fluoride right here.
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:10.440]  When it's in government studies and state studies and federal stuff, it's all known.
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:11.480]  And see, that's an example.
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:16.200]  You will take vaccines from government controlled hospitals with a government that's been caught
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:17.200]  testing.
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:21.360]  Everybody knows about syphilis in black people because it was a big deal and came out.
[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:25.360]  But there's like thousands of studies, thousands of things like that, black, white, you name
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:26.360]  it.
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:32.600]  I mean, Obama is a globalist New World Order eugenicist.
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:33.600]  They all are.
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:37.640]  The point is they're gonna use the leftist takeover of collectivism to get control of
[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:40.080]  you so they can put whatever they want in your body.
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:46.680]  Obama supporters, 800-259-9231, they are feeling good right now.
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:48.440]  They're celebrating everywhere.
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:49.840]  The government's their friend.
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:51.880]  They've got a big ego now.
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:55.200]  They're under the dark wings of the New World Order.
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:59.120]  And let's talk to Mac in New Hampshire who's an Obama supporter.
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:00.120]  Some of these will be sarcastic.
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:01.120]  Go ahead, Mac.
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:02.120]  Hey, why not, Alex?
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:03.120]  I mean, think about it.
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:12.080]  You sell gold for the New World Order, so why can't I support Obama?
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:14.560]  Okay, so I guess that's it.
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:15.560]  I'm convicted.
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:17.800]  I sell gold for the New World Order.
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:20.560]  Who owns all the gold?
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:22.560]  The Rothschilds, right?
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:29.120]  They own a lot of it, but they're trying to drive down the price of it and hoard it.
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:34.760]  They actually, openly, all the big mega banks and people wanna keep gold down, so while
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:37.840]  they buy it, they're always bad mouthing it.
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:44.400]  And I told people buy gold at 260 bucks an ounce, and then it doubled, tripled, quadrupled.
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:46.240]  I personally believe in gold and silver.
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:51.040]  I guess everything I do is bad, so that's why you support Obama.
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:53.760]  I'm not saying everything you do is bad.
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:57.240]  No, no, no, hold on, no, no, no, it's a moral equivalency.
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:01.560]  You're saying I support Obama, I guess cuz you think he gives you something free, I guess
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:02.560]  that's the message.
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:08.160]  And then you're saying I'm immoral, I sell gold when I have a sponsor, Midas Resources
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:13.040]  where I get my gold, who has great deals on it, so that when the fiat currency goes belly
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:14.200]  up, people are prepared.
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:19.320]  See, I sell things I believe in to fund my operation because I try to be a moral person.
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:24.960]  So whatever I think's really hot, like Propure Water Filters discounted at info.store.com
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:30.200]  or Midas Resources, Frank's or whatever, I promote the bullion.
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:33.880]  Even though sponsorship wise, I could make more if I promoted the numismatics, and there
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:35.280]  are some good deals on that.
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:39.440]  It's just hard to really know what you're doing, I promote bullion.
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:44.360]  Even though I have sponsors knocking my doors down to promote numismatics with 200% markups
[02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:46.320]  that other talk show hosts promote all day.
[02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:47.320]  Do you hear me do that?
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:48.320]  No, you don't.
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:51.480]  So why do you like Obama?
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:52.480]  We've heard how I'm evil.
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:53.480]  Okay, I'm bad.
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:57.760]  Now, you tell us, you're in charge, aren't you?
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:00.600]  You kind of feel good about this big government right now, don't you?
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:03.720]  Well, I look at it this way.
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:07.840]  One way or the other, I don't care.
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:12.440]  What's Obama gonna do that any other president hasn't done already to us?
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:13.440]  Exactly.
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:17.520]  You're like, I'm old, I'm getting my government money and I'm just gonna laugh at it and that
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:19.160]  gives me power over it.
[02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:25.600]  Well, I mean, let's face it, every other president, right, has screwed up, am I right?
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:29.760]  No, no, no, since they murdered Kennedy and they were good and bad and he wasn't perfect,
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:33.880]  we've been run by foreign banks, so things are getting progressively worse.
[02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:39.140]  The president's a puppet, see, I can't get that through to you, we're in a foreign takeover.
[02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:40.900]  Do you know what they've done in Greece and places?
[02:28:40.900 --> 02:28:42.460]  They're gonna do that here.
[02:28:42.460 --> 02:28:47.280]  You understand, you're gonna end up not getting your money or social security down this road.
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:51.840]  Let me ask you this, if you think any president was ever good, right, then how come you never
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:58.840]  mentioned on your radio show that the Constitution was suspended in 1933 and no one's ever re-suspended
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:28:59.840]  it?
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:01.320]  How come you never mentioned that?
[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:07.000]  Well, sir, that's in my films, the Emergency Powers Act of 1933, and that's when they put
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.120]  us under emergency and that every year they re-enact the emergency and that we've had
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:16.160]  martial law since then as a beachhead and that they've been slowly turning the heat
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:17.160]  up.
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:20.000]  Back then we were about a number one at martial law on the Richter scale, now we're about
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.400]  a seven and a half, I've written articles about it, so I guess you must have missed
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:24.400]  that show.
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:28.640]  Right, and do you ever tell anybody that we live under corporations or we don't live under
[02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:29.640]  a government?
[02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:36.120]  But wait a minute, I talk about this constantly, you must be missing the show, but wait a minute,
[02:29:36.120 --> 02:29:40.520]  why do you like Obama just cuz you think you're gonna get more goodies, I mean, why do you
[02:29:40.520 --> 02:29:41.520]  support Obama?
[02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:42.520]  It's not.
[02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:48.040]  Of course not, he's not gonna do anything more than any other president has ever done.
[02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:49.040]  Are you kidding?
[02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:50.400]  We'll be right back.

[02:33:57.320 --> 02:33:59.880]  That is just some of the news.
[02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:02.800]  I want to go back to the Obama supporters.
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:04.360]  That's what I found.
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:08.900]  They just have an arrogance and he's all right.
[02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:11.880]  And they like how he talks and they like his baloney.
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:12.880]  Will you queue up?
[02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:17.240]  I've got to tell you this, the Obama clip where he pledged not to raise taxes on payroll
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:22.360]  taxes or any other taxes on people below a quarter million dollars a year because there's
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:28.920]  like 14 different new taxes, fines, fees, and was covering it yesterday, 14 different
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:36.640]  ones out of the new Congress that he robo signed yesterday.
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:40.160]  And 12 billion in cuts, I mean, that's a joke.
[02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:41.480]  They want to bankrupt us.
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:43.440]  They're not screwing up in Washington.
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:47.240]  Let's go ahead, I mean, I should have played this for that Obama supporter.
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:52.440]  I mean, do you like being lied to and they go, that's just the way I'll do it.
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:56.320]  Well, why the Democrats get so upset about drones and killing and wars?
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:34:57.800]  I got upset when Bush was doing it.
[02:34:57.800 --> 02:35:03.080]  I'm upset now, cuz see, that's being done in my name and my tax money is going to do
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:04.080]  that.
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:05.080]  So I feel responsible.
[02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:09.920]  So I mean, I feel bad about it.
[02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:14.200]  I can't control some Prozac head who stole guns from mommy and goes and kills people.
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:17.600]  The folks that put them on the drugs in the schools, the people that push all this and
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:19.840]  know it's gonna happen, I don't like them.
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:21.420]  They're the ones that help this happen.
[02:35:21.420 --> 02:35:26.440]  But I'm not guilty for Adam Lanza because I want to protect my family and my Second
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:27.440]  Amendment birthright.
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:33.160]  Well, let me tell you something, I do share some of the blame for not doing enough to
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:34.600]  stop these wars and things.
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:38.720]  And then just to watch you Democrats who would get so upset about Bush, cuz it was just moral
[02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:40.160]  power for you.
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:42.280]  Now when Obama does it, you love it.
[02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:43.400]  I see him defend it.
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:47.720]  I put a video out showing kids Obama killed with drones and they were like, good, kill
[02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:48.720]  them.
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:49.720]  They were real Democrats.
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:50.720]  I mean, you're just sick.
[02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:56.000]  You think you're on a winning team when Obama is a front man for a guy putting fluoride
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:59.360]  in your drinking water, putting cancer viruses in your vaccine.
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:03.120]  You're like, I ain't been doing it a long time.
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:04.920]  You are living in fantasy land.
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:09.160]  I'm gonna move quickly here through Obama supporters 80025 at 99231.
[02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:11.920]  We've got our answer to demand a plan that's gonna premiere here.
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:16.840]  It's pretty powerful, audio and video, and it'll be posted in the next few hours in infowars.com
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:19.000]  for the radio listeners.
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.280]  Obama supporter listening on 90.1 FM in Austin, go ahead.
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:24.440]  Wait, wait, wait, put them on hold.
[02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:28.200]  I forgot we have a station owner or manager who wanted to say something about Obama.
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:29.800]  I apologize, I'm out of control.
[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:32.240]  I'm doing stuff during the breaks is the problem.
[02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:43.720]  Greg, I think his name is Lesher, operates 1540 AM, KYAH, yeah, 540, I'm so out of my
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:46.560]  mind folks, operates 540.
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:47.560]  You know what it is?
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:50.720]  We gotta move this TV closer to me with the calls cuz I got good eyes.
[02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:55.480]  But since we put it on a smaller monitor, I can't read, I mean, my eyes are going.
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:58.920]  I've always had like 2015 vision and I can't read this.
[02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:07.800]  Again, Greg operates 540 AM, KYAH, another one of our great affiliates across the United
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:08.800]  States.
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:12.560]  Greg, what is your take today, sir, on all this?
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:15.440]  Okay, you're sitting down, I hope.
[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:18.240]  I am sitting down, sir.
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:25.040]  Okay, when a forest fire gets going, the best way that they fight it is create a backfire
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:26.880]  so they can burn up all the fuel.
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:35.280]  And they've done that with this birth certificate malarkey, okay?
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:38.400]  It doesn't matter where the man was born.
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:40.680]  He could have been born on the high seas.
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:42.720]  He understands this.
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:48.080]  But in order to qualify to be a candidate for the United States President, or to be
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:57.200]  the President, you have to have natural born citizens, both parents.
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:05.800]  And even according to the United Nations laws, because his father was a British citizen,
[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:08.000]  he is a British citizen himself.
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.120]  Yes, he's a dual citizen.
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:11.120]  I knew that.
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:12.280]  No, actually, I knew that.
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:13.280]  It's never gotten attention.
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:20.520]  And the laws, when he was born, said you had to have both parents be citizens who were
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:21.520]  actually born here.
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:24.160]  They've since, I believe, changed the law going from memory.
[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:28.600]  But no, he is illegitimate, and they used the whole thing about where is he really from
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:29.920]  as a distraction.
[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:33.560]  Yeah, no, laws are not changed.
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:37.640]  You have to be a natural born citizen, or your parents at least have to be naturalized
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:39.640]  citizens before your- Both of them.
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:41.480]  Yes, both of them.
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:45.120]  It's in the Constitution, okay?
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:46.120]  That's the way it is.
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:47.120]  No, no, you're right.
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:50.400]  But I believe at the time that was the law, and you're right, it's in the Constitution.
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:53.520]  I think they claim they have a law that changed it, but you're right.
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:54.520]  It's in the Constitution.
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:58.080]  You can't do that without a constitutional convention.
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:03.960]  Well, that's why they got this, the artificial birth certificate.
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:04.960]  That's not the issue.
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:05.960]  The issue isn't where he was born.
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:06.960]  It doesn't matter.
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:11.120]  As long as both your parents are citizens, you can be born on a high seas.
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:13.240]  You can be born in space.
[02:39:13.240 --> 02:39:16.040]  You are a natural born citizen.
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:21.960]  What we're talking about here is a native born, and that has nothing to do with the
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:22.960]  law.
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:26.360]  You have to be a natural born citizen, and here's what's happened.
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:28.400]  He has already served his four years.
[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:36.960]  Now, we're in a critical time period, very critical, because tomorrow, Congress sits
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:40.520]  down and they go ahead with the election and accept it.
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:42.000]  Now, here's the deal.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:49.540]  A quo warranto action has been started with the Attorney General, and people need to get
[02:39:49.540 --> 02:39:55.800]  behind this and get overnight letters to their senators tonight, today, before the post office
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:57.920]  closes.
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:01.800]  What they need to do is they need to go to teamlaw.net.
[02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:05.120]  There's a news flash, call to action.
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:06.680]  Click on that.
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:09.800]  Read the article.
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:16.120]  We actually did the one who started this quo warranto action, and actually, Eric Madsen
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:20.880]  there at team law has actually quo warrantoed judges numerous times and got them off the
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:21.880]  bench.
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:22.880]  They understand-
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:23.880]  No, no, I'm aware of that.
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:27.760]  And again, John McCain was born on a ship in the Panama Canal, but both his parents
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:29.600]  were known to be US citizens.
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:31.600]  So obviously, he's a citizen.
[02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:33.120]  It's not where you're born.
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:39.440]  It's that you have parents that are both born in the United States, and it's the same thing.
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:40.440]  And you're right.
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:41.440]  That's been looked into.
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:46.120]  It was part of England when he was born.
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:50.560]  And so his supposed dad, that makes him a British citizen.
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:57.120]  And up till now, nobody's done, they've investigated what has been done, and nothing has been brought
[02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:00.940]  into the proper venue until now.
[02:41:00.940 --> 02:41:06.200]  And once this gets started, and once these people send these things to their senators
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:12.520]  in Washington, because that's where they are right now, and overnight them, your listeners,
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:18.160]  we could create truckloads of these, and the attorney general will be flooded with these.
[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:21.160]  The attorney general's job is basically done, okay?
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:28.920]  Because even if he refuses to proceed with this, Zane Gray, who started this, becomes
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:35.280]  the special prosecutor for the United States, and then it becomes the United States against
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:36.280]  Barack Obama.
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:38.440]  That's what the court document will read.
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:42.720]  And it will begin the core warrantal action, and there is no way that Obama can get out
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:47.360]  of it, because he cannot argue the fact that he's already said his father was from Kenya.
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:48.920]  He's a Kenyan, okay?
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:54.600]  Well, let me ask you this, are people waking up there in Delta, Utah, to what's going on?
[02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:55.600]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:41:57.900]  We just had a two-hour program.
[02:41:57.900 --> 02:42:01.840]  We had Eric Madsen with Team Lawn, and by the way, Eric Madsen will be on with Butch
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:04.640]  Pot tonight on Call to Decision.
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:07.140]  We had a two-hour meeting, and Zane Gray was on there.
[02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:08.880]  We talked about this in great detail.
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:13.640]  I will actually send you that two-hour program, if you wanna put it on your website, so people
[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:15.400]  can listen to this.
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:18.400]  And I mean, it's just fantastic.
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:20.840]  This is the time when we can stop the whole thing.
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:26.640]  We can get this man out of office, because he will be going in there illegally, against
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:27.640]  the Constitution.
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:28.640]  He is not a citizen.
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:32.960]  Well, I'll tell you what, I'll get your name and number.
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:37.720]  We appreciate you carrying the show, and maybe we should get those guys on as well.
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:39.760]  God bless you, and I appreciate you calling in.
[02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:43.100]  I said I was gonna go to Obama supporters here, but I wanted to hear from one of the
[02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:46.080]  station owners out there in Utah.
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:50.600]  Now, let's go back to Karen, now in Texas, an Obama supporter.
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:52.600]  Go ahead, ma'am, you're on the air.
[02:42:52.600 --> 02:43:01.240]  Okay, well, it was the Republicans that put these toll roads into Austin, and we were
[02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:03.200]  trying to fight that.
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:10.480]  And when I originally voted for Obama, we thought that he would keep us out of a war,
[02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:11.480]  okay?
[02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:16.240]  And we thought that maybe he was better than McCain.
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:19.200]  So now he ran against Mitt Romney.
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:25.920]  Well, they wouldn't let us vote for Ron Paul, and we didn't know who else to vote for.
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:27.400]  So what are we supposed to do?
[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:31.240]  No, no, see, this is a reasonable Obama supporter calling in.
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:35.440]  No, I get it, the Republicans run horrible people, so you don't have a choice.
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:41.520]  The point is Obama is really, really bad is my point, because he gets away with the wars,
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:45.080]  he gets away with the torture, he gets away with everything.
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:49.960]  And they don't use him to bring people together, they use him to create division, Karen, I
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:50.960]  appreciate your call.
[02:43:50.960 --> 02:43:54.280]  And look, we get obsessed with personalities.
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:44:00.200]  My point is that the Obama supporters that cheerlead for Obama and who really think he's
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:06.040]  like a movie star and go, and I'm like, listen, he's really bad, you just lost.
[02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:07.720]  That's who we're talking about.
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:12.280]  Those are people that are really dangerous because they're so stupid.
[02:44:12.280 --> 02:44:15.960]  And that's who we're wanting to talk to, I'll be honest with you, we had one earlier.
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:18.680]  Joe in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:19.680]  Hello?
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:21.680]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:23.560]  Sorry about that.
[02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:29.800]  First things first, I would just like everybody to research an AD psyop created called Mind
[02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:34.200]  Wars, and how Infowars is a manifestation of that.
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:37.520]  Number two- Now, sir, now, sir, obviously, I use the
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:44.640]  term infowars.com to say the global issues information lies against us, we use truth
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:45.640]  against them.
[02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:51.980]  See, the word propaganda just means information to get something political done you want.
[02:44:51.980 --> 02:44:57.400]  Black propaganda means lies, white propaganda means truth, gray propaganda means spin.
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:03.120]  I use white propaganda, so I want to be clear about terms out there.
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:10.680]  When I talk about violence lowering after gun ownership increases, and I have the FBI
[02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:12.680]  statistics, that's white propaganda.
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:17.260]  Okay, so I want to be specific about that, go ahead.
[02:45:17.260 --> 02:45:23.120]  I understand that, and the message certainly use the term bear fruits.
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:27.600]  The fruit that is bared from the message is certainly true, but what I'd like to point
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:29.720]  out is that you have to be careful.
[02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:35.880]  A lot of the times in the entertainment industry especially, 75% of the truth is reported with
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:38.760]  15% careful- Listen, I agree with you, listen, we're taking
[02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:43.400]  calls from Obama supporters, will you tell us, do you support Obama or was that a way
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:44.400]  to get on the air?
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:46.600]  No, I do have a point about Obama.
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:51.400]  Now, you'd have to be completely unaware of the situation, what's really going on with
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:52.880]  the politics.
[02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:55.840]  Whether you're for or against Obama is irrelevant.
[02:45:55.840 --> 02:46:01.160]  If you go by the fruits of what their actions bear, you'd have to be an idiot to support
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:02.160]  them.
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:06.720]  All we're seeing the government do is wars, and we're seeing corruption and robbery of
[02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:07.720]  taxpayers.
[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:12.400]  Obama is merely, that's what you should focus more on, and I do agree with that.
[02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:14.680]  Well, the globalist wanted Obama.
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:15.680]  Why is that?
[02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:19.440]  Well, if the globalists want to open borders, I can intellectually tell you why it's bad,
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:20.960]  but I just automatically am against it.
[02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:24.800]  If the globalists want our guns, I can tell you intellectually why I'm against it, but
[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:27.400]  they're against it, I'm against them.
[02:46:27.400 --> 02:46:30.080]  You see, I'm pro-gun because they're anti-gun.
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:33.640]  I'm pro-sovereignty because they're anti-sovereignty, and I have all my reasons for that.
[02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:34.640]  They have their reasons.
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:37.440]  I don't know what you're getting at, Joe, I appreciate your call.
[02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:43.640]  I mean, these Obama supporters, just God bless them, you know Republicans are pretty dumbed
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:50.360]  down as well, but at least they say they want smaller government and no collectivism ruins
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:51.360]  people.
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:55.000]  And the Republicans are just basically the other side of the system and they just move
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:56.640]  forward as well.
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:46:59.560]  But I mean, Democrats, I mean, it's about being part of a club.
[02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:04.000]  It's about having the Obama sticker and people go, you're liberal, you're good.
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:11.120]  No, you support a front guy, a pitchman for a globalist operation feeding us GMO and fluoride
[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:17.000]  and cancer viruses in the vaccines and radioactive isotopes in the water and launching wars all
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:18.440]  over the place.
[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:21.960]  And I have Obama supporters, I go, listen, these wars are wrong in person.
[02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:26.520]  They go, you're just sad you lost and I'm like, no, no, listen, they're expanding wars.
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:27.520]  It's really bad.
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:32.580]  Oh, yeah, you wish Romney would have been better and I'm like, you need to recognize
[02:47:32.580 --> 02:47:34.520]  it's wrong what Obama's doing.
[02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:35.520]  Can you at least do that?
[02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:39.360]  They go, no, you're just trying to use that against him, but you don't like him.
[02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:43.520]  I'm just like, man, and it's the helplessness of them.
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:48.280]  Jamie in New Mexico, Obama supporter, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:53.520]  Yes, first time caller, long time listener.
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:48:01.680]  I am forced to support Obama because I am living off of welfare and food stamps.
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:05.880]  It is real easy to get food stamps.
[02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:09.960]  And depending on your employer, it's really easy to get unemployment benefits.
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:13.760]  I'm making about $100 less than I was.
[02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:18.320]  And right now it's a good thing because I'd probably be on the streets.
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:21.240]  I'd probably be living with my mom or my brother.
[02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:25.560]  You realize with 50 million people on food stamps, it destroys all the small businesses
[02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:29.800]  because only the big businesses are designed to take the money and the cards.
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:31.680]  And you understand in the end, you're going to get nothing.
[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:40.720]  I mean, you understand, have you heard my story of how you domesticate hogs, bald hogs?
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:45.440]  The reason why, it's only for this month, because I am looking currently-
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:47.400]  Listen, I'm not saying you're bad.
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:50.940]  Listen, if people are really downing out the churches or state government, there should
[02:48:50.940 --> 02:48:53.440]  be some form of safety net.
[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:57.760]  This isn't a safety net, this is a safety news, sir.
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:05.600]  And again, you say you support Obama, he's only doing all this to get you dependent so
[02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:07.880]  he can get the guns and then drop the hammer.
[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:11.240]  They've already done this in Europe and Mexico and everywhere else.
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:14.040]  Just so long as you know, it's a trap.
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:18.760]  I mean, look, there are calories in a butterscotch candy.
[02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:22.400]  A small butterscotch candy probably has 50 calories, okay?
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:24.080]  Do you agree with me on that?
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:25.080]  Yes.
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:28.600]  Now, a butterscotch candy is not bad in and of itself.
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:32.320]  If a man opens a van door at a playground and tells a three-year-old his parents aren't
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:37.160]  watching him, get in the car, I got butterscotch, should the child get in the car for the butterscotch
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:38.160]  candy?
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:39.160]  Negative.
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:43.880]  But I mean, it's a free candy.
[02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:47.440]  I see your point.
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:53.120]  I was at the EBT, the food stamp place yesterday.
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:58.320]  People purposefully have kids to get on welfare.
[02:49:58.320 --> 02:50:02.920]  People purposefully quit their jobs to get on unemployment.
[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:04.760]  It's too easy.
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:06.600]  That's why I'm not understanding.
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:08.240]  No, I really respect you.
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:13.280]  Listen, I respect you because when we open these phones up for Obama people, the really
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:18.240]  arrogant ones call in and are very entertaining, but it's sad to hear real Obama supporters
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:21.320]  calling and go, I don't have a job and I won't have food.
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:25.800]  That's what they've done to America that 50 years ago could feed the whole world.
[02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:28.200]  And now we can't even feed ourselves.
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:29.680]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:31.280]  I'm bankrupting the network doing this.
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:32.280]  God bless you, sir.
[02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:33.280]  I appreciate your call.
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:37.080]  I'm going to skip this network break because I've got to premiere this special report here
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:39.520]  in a moment and finish up with your calls.
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:43.040]  And briefly, there'll come a time when the country's so poor, people won't even be able
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:44.880]  to support us with sponsorship.
[02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:47.500]  You won't even be able, your dollar will be so worthless, you won't be able to even get
[02:50:47.500 --> 02:50:48.800]  a water filtration system.
[02:50:48.800 --> 02:50:51.640]  You won't be able to buy the magazine in bulk to give it out to people.
[02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:52.640]  That's their plan.
[02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:55.640]  The Bilderberg Group has bragged, Paul has an article out today that they want to make
[02:50:55.640 --> 02:50:58.680]  us poor to control us.
[02:50:58.680 --> 02:51:01.160]  Making you poor is a tool of total control.
[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:04.160]  And they've done everything they can to shut this country down.
[02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:07.740]  Believe me, I know.
[02:51:07.740 --> 02:51:12.960]  And it is very, very sad.
[02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:17.280]  I just hope listeners will support the broadcast, A, by spreading the word about the AM and
[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:22.680]  FM stations you're listening to, Global Shortwave, Internet Streams, and Infowars.com, the video
[02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:24.000]  streams at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:27.920]  I hope you'll send it out to your email list, your Facebook, your Twitter.
[02:51:27.920 --> 02:51:32.000]  Get our stories out, folks, retweet the articles we send out at Real Alex Jones.
[02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:36.720]  You have the power, but you have to get aggressive and vote with your dollars and your energy
[02:51:36.720 --> 02:51:42.560]  to promote broadcasts like this, these oases of truth, so that we can get the information
[02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:44.800]  out to checkmate the globalists.
[02:51:44.800 --> 02:51:45.800]  And we're close.
[02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:49.760]  I tell you, we're in the fight.
[02:51:49.760 --> 02:51:51.880]  That's why they're coming down on us, okay?
[02:51:51.880 --> 02:51:56.680]  But I mean, it's kind of like a bully starts beating you up, and you get a good lick in,
[02:51:56.680 --> 02:51:58.880]  and they go, whoa, this guy can fight.
[02:51:58.880 --> 02:52:02.200]  Now the real fight's about to start, okay?
[02:52:02.200 --> 02:52:04.480]  So I mean, it's on, all right?
[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:08.320]  I mean, I'm here to tell you, this is it.
[02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:14.560]  Every expert we talk to says their spotty sense, I just got a complete chill, is off
[02:52:14.560 --> 02:52:16.280]  the chart right now.
[02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:20.640]  Gosh, I got goosebumps on my face, look at that.
[02:52:20.640 --> 02:52:23.840]  I mean, this is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:25.980]  This is gut check time, okay?
[02:52:25.980 --> 02:52:28.960]  This is not theatrics here on the radio.
[02:52:28.960 --> 02:52:32.480]  This is not a game.
[02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:35.600]  And they're gonna bankrupt us forever, very soon, and put us under agenda 21.
[02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:42.720]  They want you on welfare to make you go live in a 200 square foot house room.
[02:52:42.720 --> 02:52:47.560]  They're already making welfare recipients take unlimited shots, like 50 a year.
[02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:52.800]  All right, I'm gonna go to this special report, it's very powerful.
[02:52:52.800 --> 02:52:56.920]  We're gonna give it a title in the next hour and put it up at infoawars.com.
[02:52:56.920 --> 02:53:01.420]  Get it, Facebook it, put it out on Twitter, put it out on YouTube, talk it up, get it
[02:53:01.420 --> 02:53:02.420]  out there.
[02:53:02.420 --> 02:53:05.960]  Fight the COINTELPRO trying to block our videos, trying to distract people.
[02:53:05.960 --> 02:53:08.280]  You cannot be stopped if you take action.
[02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:10.280]  Little things turn into big things.
[02:53:10.280 --> 02:53:15.180]  Small things can grow like a mustard seed.
[02:53:15.180 --> 02:53:16.640]  Big things have small beginnings.
[02:53:16.640 --> 02:53:23.000]  So this video is our answer to the demand a plan Hollywood Bloomberg turning the guns
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:24.000]  video.
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:29.240]  And it gets into false flag democide, you name it, put together by Melissa Melton and
[02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:31.080]  the rest of our crew.
[02:53:31.080 --> 02:53:32.080]  Here it is.
[02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:33.080]  Northwoods.
[02:53:33.080 --> 02:53:34.080]  Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:53:34.080 --> 02:53:35.080]  Gladio.
[02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:36.080]  Kent State.
[02:53:36.080 --> 02:53:37.080]  Ruby Ridge.
[02:53:37.080 --> 02:53:38.080]  Waco.
[02:53:38.080 --> 02:53:39.260]  Oklahoma City.
[02:53:39.260 --> 02:53:40.840]  The World Trade Center.
[02:53:40.840 --> 02:53:41.840]  The Pentagon.
[02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:42.840]  Shanksville.
[02:53:42.840 --> 02:53:44.720]  Hurricane Katrina.
[02:53:44.720 --> 02:53:46.560]  Fast and furious.
[02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:48.260]  Fast and furious.
[02:53:48.260 --> 02:53:49.500]  Fast and furious.
[02:53:49.500 --> 02:53:50.440]  How many more?
[02:53:50.440 --> 02:53:51.440]  How many more?
[02:53:51.440 --> 02:53:53.500]  How many more false flags?
[02:53:53.500 --> 02:53:54.500]  How many more?
[02:53:54.500 --> 02:53:56.840]  How many more government buildings?
[02:53:56.840 --> 02:53:58.840]  How many more innocent people?
[02:53:58.840 --> 02:53:59.960]  How many more?
[02:53:59.960 --> 02:54:00.960]  How many more?
[02:54:00.960 --> 02:54:04.760]  What has been the number one cause of unnatural death in history?
[02:54:04.760 --> 02:54:09.200]  Democide or death by government has killed 290 million people on record.
[02:54:09.200 --> 02:54:17.640]  Two hundred and ninety million people killed killed 290 million killed by government.
[02:54:17.640 --> 02:54:25.960]  The government, the number one killer in history is democide, democide, democide death by government.
[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:26.960]  Look it up.
[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:27.960]  Go look it up.
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:32.160]  In the 20th century, government murdered four times as many people as were killed in all
[02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:35.520]  the international and domestic wars combined.
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:41.200]  USSR, 61,911,000 people killed.
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:45.040]  Hitler's Germany, nearly 21 million people killed.
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:49.760]  Japan's imperialism, nearly 6 million people killed.
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:53.280]  Western colonization killed over 50 million people.
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:58.960]  Pol Pot's Cambodia, funded by the US government, 2 million people killed.
[02:54:58.960 --> 02:55:06.160]  China's Communist Party, as many as 76 million people killed between 1949 and 1987.
[02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:09.120]  And the list goes on and on.
[02:55:09.120 --> 02:55:14.120]  So now you know the most dangerous thing to you and your family in the world is government.
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:19.000]  Because mass murderers agree, gun control works.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.360]  Disarming citizens is democide.
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:23.800]  Disarming citizens is democide.
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:25.240]  Disarming people is democide.
[02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:28.520]  How many people have died because of Fast and Furious?
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:30.720]  No more false flags.
[02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:31.720]  Enough.
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:32.720]  Enough.
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:33.800]  It's enough.
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:35.000]  Now is the time.
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:36.000]  It's time.
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:40.920]  It's time to realize that when the government takes your guns, people die.
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:45.160]  It's time to realize the biggest threat to you and your family is government.
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:49.560]  It's time to recognize government is the greatest killer of all time.
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:50.560]  It's time.
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:51.920]  Demand a plan.
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:52.920]  Demand.
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:53.920]  Demand a plan.
[02:55:53.920 --> 02:55:56.080]  Demand a plan right now.
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:55:57.600]  As a free human being.
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:55:58.800]  As an American.
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:00.000]  As an American.
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:01.640]  As an American citizen.
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:02.820]  As a patriot.
[02:56:02.820 --> 02:56:04.320]  For your children.
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:09.800]  Demand to know why you and your children are forced into gun-free zones while government
[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:15.480]  officials, celebrities, and their children are protected by armed guards.
[02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:18.400]  Demand they show you the word hunting in the Second Amendment.
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:22.620]  Demand to know why the government shipped thousands of guns to Mexican drug cartels.
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:26.200]  Demand our government stops blowing up federal buildings.
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:31.640]  Demand that our troops stop protecting opium fields in Afghanistan and come home.
[02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:34.240]  Demand the government stop this phony drug war.
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:38.920]  Demand to know why the Department of Homeland Security bought more than 1.6 billion hollow
[02:56:38.920 --> 02:56:41.200]  point bullets with our money.
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:45.880]  Demand our government stop poisoning our food supply with genetically modified organisms.
[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:50.520]  Demand that President Obama stops killing innocent women and children all around the
[02:56:50.520 --> 02:56:53.600]  world with his illegal drone attacks.
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:56.620]  Demand an end to these unconstitutional wars.
[02:56:56.620 --> 02:57:00.240]  Demand that the TSA stop groping our genitals at the airport.
[02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:04.720]  Demand that the NSA stop illegally spying on all of us all the time.
[02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:08.020]  Demand that toxic fluoride be removed from the water supply.
[02:57:08.020 --> 02:57:13.580]  Demand our politicians uphold the Constitution and Bill of Rights as they swore to when they
[02:57:13.580 --> 02:57:14.920]  took office.
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:15.920]  It's time.
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:19.880]  It's time for our leaders to act like leaders.
[02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:23.200]  It's time for our leaders to read the Constitution.
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:26.600]  It's time for our leaders to obey the Constitution.
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:27.680]  The Constitution.
[02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:29.220]  The Constitution.
[02:57:29.220 --> 02:57:33.840]  Because a well regulated militia with 10 round magazines wouldn't last very long.
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:36.600]  Demand an end to citizen disarmament.
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:38.260]  Government sponsored terror.
[02:57:38.260 --> 02:57:39.560]  And democide.
[02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:42.040]  Democide, death by government.
[02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:43.600]  Right now.
[02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:44.760]  Right now.
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:46.140]  Right now.
[02:57:46.140 --> 02:57:52.400]  We are sick and tired of our tyrannical government taking away our rights.
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:54.080]  Stop stealing our rights.
[02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:55.200]  Our rights.
[02:57:55.200 --> 02:57:56.200]  Our rights.
[02:57:56.200 --> 02:57:59.240]  How many more people does government have to kill?
[02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:00.240]  Enough.
[02:58:00.240 --> 02:58:01.240]  Enough.
[02:58:01.240 --> 02:58:02.240]  Enough already.
[02:58:02.240 --> 02:58:03.240]  Enough.
[02:58:03.240 --> 02:58:04.240]  Enough.
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:05.240]  Enough.
[02:58:05.240 --> 02:58:06.240]  Enough.
[02:58:06.240 --> 02:58:07.240]  Enough.
[02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:13.640]  Enough of the people laying down and letting government kill them in mass after disarming
[02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:17.640]  them as they've done throughout history over and over again.
[02:58:17.640 --> 02:58:24.400]  Enough, enough to laying down and letting these criminals use us up like slaves.
[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:32.160]  All right, folks, the full video with all the documentation is going up at Infowars.com
[02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:34.040]  the next 10 minutes.
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:36.320]  Get it out to everyone you know.

[02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:52.400]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:56.880]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[02:58:56.880 --> 02:58:57.880]  storm.
[02:58:57.880 --> 02:59:01.480]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression.
[02:59:01.480 --> 02:59:04.080]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[02:59:04.080 --> 02:59:07.120]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[02:59:07.120 --> 02:59:10.400]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:14.680]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from Eastwood Direct and I recommend you do
[02:59:14.680 --> 02:59:15.680]  the same.
[02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:18.360]  It's time to get your own supply from E Foods Direct.
[02:59:18.360 --> 02:59:21.960]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[02:59:21.960 --> 02:59:26.360]  I'm taking control of my future and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[02:59:26.360 --> 02:59:30.400]  Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials and you can start with
[02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:34.160]  a holiday gift pack that's normally $80 now under 50 bucks.
[02:59:34.160 --> 02:59:36.760]  Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:59:36.760 --> 02:59:41.720]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:59:41.720 --> 02:59:45.360]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[02:59:45.360 --> 02:59:52.320]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:59:52.320 --> 02:59:55.800]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.800 --> 03:00:09.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:18.120]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:24.600]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[03:00:24.600 --> 03:00:27.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:27.440 --> 03:00:32.880]  When populations get decadent and decide it's cool to lay down a big government, everything
[03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:37.800]  collapses and you get put in forced labor brigades and the people that were on the welfare
[03:00:37.800 --> 03:00:39.680]  usually right in there in the forced labor.
[03:00:39.680 --> 03:00:43.080]  Of course, people that actually work usually make better workers, so it's the former welfare
[03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:46.960]  folks with their machine guns prodding us around like the Soviet Union.
[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:50.240]  Let's go to Jeannie who says she's a real Obama supporter.
[03:00:50.240 --> 03:00:51.720]  She's a KLBJ 590 listener.
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:54.760]  I guess she's listening on 90.1 though right now.
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:56.360]  Jeannie, show up.
[03:00:56.360 --> 03:00:58.120]  Tell me about how great Obama is.
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:03.440]  Well, I mean, I'm not going to say how great, but Alex, I was a Ron Paul supporter.
[03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:09.040]  When he came out of the president election, I had to, who else was I going to vote for?
[03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:10.040]  Think about it.
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:15.080]  To me, Romney, all the Republicans, I feel like he wanted to take women's rights away
[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:16.080]  and all this.
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:17.080]  I could not-
[03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:21.320]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, we're not even saying you should have voted
[03:01:21.320 --> 03:01:22.320]  for Romney.
[03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:27.660]  It's the endorsement of Obama and people feeling like they had a victory because he's in there
[03:01:27.660 --> 03:01:30.120]  now and he's your president.
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:31.600]  It was all rigged.
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:36.560]  Okay, that's what I'm telling you is that it's rigged and it is wrong what they did
[03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:37.560]  to Ron Paul.
[03:01:37.560 --> 03:01:41.680]  It's probably why Romney overtly lost, but there's election fraud as well.
[03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:47.000]  My point is, is that America is going in a socialist direction and socialism, ma'am,
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:48.000]  is a nightmare.
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:55.160]  I mean, France now has over 80% taxes with a 75% tax on everything above that.
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:59.960]  You make over a million dollars, you pay 80% plus 75 on any money you keep.
[03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:04.160]  I mean, should taxes be at 99% or 100%?
[03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:08.680]  Alex, I wanna say something controversial and I don't care if it gets everyone mad,
[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:13.800]  but I'm gonna say to me, the reason this country is going to you know where is because of old
[03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:17.520]  white men who are running the Senate and Congress who have been running it.
[03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:22.720]  We have what, 1% of Mexicans and black people that are in the Congress Senate?
[03:02:22.720 --> 03:02:25.760]  No, it's not, are you kidding?
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:27.160]  It's all time record high.
[03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:29.080]  There's like 20 women in the Senate alone.
[03:02:29.080 --> 03:02:33.800]  White, old men running this country, the Senate and Congress-
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:35.560]  All right, ma'am, ma'am, hold on, ma'am.
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:40.400]  Are you really this ding-dang bad where it's just fun to, hold on, I know the Democrats
[03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:41.400]  are all about race.
[03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:43.220]  You sound like a white lady, I don't know who you are.
[03:02:43.220 --> 03:02:46.720]  But the point is, it's like just fun to put down white people and I get that's fun.
[03:02:46.720 --> 03:02:48.760]  I mean, that's the new trendy thing.
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:49.760]  I get it.
[03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:52.540]  Jumping off cliffs is fun too.
[03:02:52.540 --> 03:02:59.360]  The point is, is that certainly, you know, ma'am, that Dianne Feinstein is a quote white
[03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:01.840]  lady and she's saying turn our guns in.
[03:03:01.840 --> 03:03:05.480]  So if she's white, if being white is bad, I guess she's a woman though, I must make
[03:03:05.480 --> 03:03:06.480]  it okay.
[03:03:06.480 --> 03:03:08.400]  Do you support us turning our guns in?
[03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:10.400]  No, I don't, I don't.
[03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:12.800]  I mean, I really don't, I'm against that.
[03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:18.200]  But to me, that's my opinion as a 49 year old Mexican woman living in Texas, I feel
[03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:23.640]  the reason this country is going to crap is because of all white men running it.
[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:29.200]  Let me be clear, okay, so why is Nigeria, that's all black people running that, why
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:30.200]  is that going to hell?
[03:03:30.200 --> 03:03:35.520]  Or let me ask you a question, why is Mexico, I guess Mexico is doing really good, cuz there's,
[03:03:35.520 --> 03:03:42.000]  I bet I mean Mexico, I mean, is that the fault of all white men?
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:45.640]  How many people are that are white, older men running the Congress and Senate?
[03:03:45.640 --> 03:03:48.400]  Can you tell me why we are in this situation?
[03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:53.640]  Well, Japan is in a total depression for about 15 years, and I mean, is that the fault of
[03:03:53.640 --> 03:03:54.640]  all white men?
[03:03:54.640 --> 03:03:59.640]  I wonder who, that's Steve, president, but- Well, ma'am, ma'am, I mean, listen, I'm asking
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:04.000]  you something here, cuz you know white skin is only a lack of pigment.
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:09.620]  Yeah, Alex, look, I'm being honest- But I mean, hold on, I understand, I got it,
[03:04:09.620 --> 03:04:11.080]  is it racist to own guns?
[03:04:11.080 --> 03:04:15.760]  Start putting him down also, if it was a Mexican president, and we were in this situation,
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:21.720]  I have no problem saying, he's a problem- Hold on, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, did you hear
[03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:22.720]  me?
[03:04:22.720 --> 03:04:27.120]  The president is a puppet, we're talking about how you're supporting a puppet.
[03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:33.720]  Alex, we can agree to disagree- No, no, but say you like Obama, but you don't
[03:04:33.720 --> 03:04:34.720]  like turning your guns in.
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:41.040]  No, I'm not gonna- I'm gonna ask you a question, should we get rid of our Congress and put
[03:04:41.040 --> 03:04:43.400]  in the Mexican Congress, would that make things better?
[03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:48.240]  No, I think we should start all over- But wait a minute, you just said, maybe we
[03:04:48.240 --> 03:04:52.720]  should go down to Mexico, that's kinda what the North American Union is, and bring all
[03:04:52.720 --> 03:04:57.680]  those great people, cuz they're Hispanic, up here to run, they would do a better job.
[03:04:57.680 --> 03:05:01.240]  I think she's actually right, folks, we gotta continue here, let's continue.
[03:05:01.240 --> 03:05:07.760]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[03:05:07.760 --> 03:05:13.040]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[03:05:13.040 --> 03:05:14.040]  front.
[03:05:14.040 --> 03:05:19.800]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[03:05:19.800 --> 03:05:20.800]  your help.
[03:05:20.800 --> 03:05:26.040]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[03:05:26.040 --> 03:05:32.060]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:32.060 --> 03:05:37.000]  We need your help to spread the word like never before, they wish to hide themselves
[03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:41.760]  during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.760 --> 03:05:49.200]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[03:05:49.200 --> 03:05:50.760]  and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:50.760 --> 03:06:01.440]  The war is here, it's an Infowar, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:01.440 --> 03:06:05.200]  Who wants to be disease-free, full of energy, and vibrant health?
[03:06:05.200 --> 03:06:09.300]  Two reasons you may feel constantly tired and run down could be that your body's acid
[03:06:09.300 --> 03:06:11.920]  level is high and your pH level is low.
[03:06:11.920 --> 03:06:13.400]  How does acid enter your body?
[03:06:13.400 --> 03:06:18.760]  A cup of coffee, a sandwich, tap water, stress, and cell phones, plus your own body produces
[03:06:18.760 --> 03:06:20.320]  acid on a regular basis.
[03:06:20.320 --> 03:06:25.140]  Alkavision plasma pH drops alkalize the water you drink and raise your pH level.
[03:06:25.140 --> 03:06:29.320]  They promote more oxygen in your system, higher energy potential, and many other documented
[03:06:29.320 --> 03:06:30.320]  health benefits.
[03:06:30.320 --> 03:06:35.800]  And studies show viruses, bacteria, and toxins cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[03:06:35.800 --> 03:06:41.240]  Alkavision plasma pH drops is the least expensive and the best pH level product you can buy.
[03:06:41.240 --> 03:06:47.800]  Order Alkavision plasma pH drops for just $29.95 at alkavision.com, spelled A-L-K-A

[03:07:02.360 --> 03:07:07.120]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[03:07:07.120 --> 03:07:08.120]  storm.
[03:07:08.120 --> 03:07:12.000]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought
[03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:16.800]  in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[03:07:16.800 --> 03:07:20.040]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[03:07:20.040 --> 03:07:24.240]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from E Foods Direct, and I recommend you do
[03:07:24.240 --> 03:07:25.240]  the same.
[03:07:25.240 --> 03:07:27.840]  It's time to get your own supply from E Foods Direct.
[03:07:27.840 --> 03:07:31.360]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:35.720]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[03:07:35.720 --> 03:07:39.680]  Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials, and you can start with
[03:07:39.680 --> 03:07:43.280]  a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50.
[03:07:43.280 --> 03:07:49.800]  Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you, call 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com
[03:07:49.800 --> 03:07:50.800]  forward slash Alex.
[03:07:50.800 --> 03:07:54.800]  Would you rather prepare six months too early, or one day too late?
[03:07:54.800 --> 03:08:00.360]  Call 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[03:08:00.360 --> 03:08:06.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:08:06.040 --> 03:08:26.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:31.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you just joined us, you missed an incredible phone call.
[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:37.360]  The woman called in, and she said, I am a real Obama supporter, she was real.
[03:08:37.360 --> 03:08:42.600]  And she said, there are too many white people in Congress, and that's why America's in trouble,
[03:08:42.600 --> 03:08:43.960]  and that's why I support Obama.
[03:08:43.960 --> 03:08:46.880]  She said she was Hispanic.
[03:08:46.880 --> 03:08:50.600]  And I said, so Mexico, should we take the Mexican Congress, one of the most corrupt
[03:08:50.600 --> 03:08:53.280]  governments in the world, and bring it up here?
[03:08:53.280 --> 03:08:56.480]  Governments are corrupt, whether you're in Africa, or whether you're in Iran, or whether
[03:08:56.480 --> 03:08:59.280]  you're in Israel, or whether you're in Russia.
[03:08:59.280 --> 03:09:04.820]  You read the Bible, it talks about government being wicked, and wickedness in high places,
[03:09:04.820 --> 03:09:05.820]  and the god of this world.
[03:09:05.820 --> 03:09:10.440]  Now, whether you believe in a physical devil or not, the issue is, historically, most governments
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:16.020]  are bad, and they tend to get worse, and worse, and worse the longer they're in.
[03:09:16.020 --> 03:09:20.760]  And I gotta be honest with you, I mean, the ignorance of Obama supporters, we got David
[03:09:20.760 --> 03:09:24.560]  Montana says he's an Obama supporter, I'm gonna continue to take Obama supporter calls
[03:09:24.560 --> 03:09:33.880]  right now on this third day of January 2013, 800-259-9231.
[03:09:33.880 --> 03:09:39.740]  Program note, there is a video we just premiered that is one of the most powerful short pieces
[03:09:39.740 --> 03:09:44.620]  we've done in a long time, collaboration between the whole crew, but John Bount and Melissa
[03:09:44.620 --> 03:09:46.440]  Melton kinda came up with it.
[03:09:46.440 --> 03:09:51.200]  Or I think simultaneously, Bount said we should do a knockoff of the demand to plan Bloomberg
[03:09:51.200 --> 03:09:55.520]  thing with all the stars saying turn your guns in.
[03:09:55.520 --> 03:10:00.300]  And then others have the idea, but the point is, I also had the idea to show Hollywood
[03:10:00.300 --> 03:10:02.340]  violence and them shooting people.
[03:10:02.340 --> 03:10:05.860]  And then one of our listeners had that idea, and I never talked about it on air.
[03:10:05.860 --> 03:10:10.020]  People just have the same thoughts when you're looking at hypocrisy.
[03:10:10.020 --> 03:10:14.120]  So we put out a new video pointing out that government's been the biggest chiller in history,
[03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:15.920]  and it shows all the statistics at the end.
[03:10:15.920 --> 03:10:19.500]  We're gonna put an article up in the next ten minutes or so, they're putting it together
[03:10:19.500 --> 03:10:26.940]  right now that shows from the University of Hawaii study, cuz I keep saying 260 plus million,
[03:10:26.940 --> 03:10:30.540]  they corrected me, it was 290 plus million.
[03:10:30.540 --> 03:10:35.900]  Sometimes I get factoids off, usually to the lower number, my mind tends to underestimate.
[03:10:35.900 --> 03:10:40.980]  That's why people think I'm exaggerating sometimes, most of the time, I mean, I would literally
[03:10:40.980 --> 03:10:47.180]  say over 95% of the time, I underestimate.
[03:10:47.180 --> 03:10:51.460]  Or sometimes I flip numbers, it's almost like dyslexia.
[03:10:51.460 --> 03:10:56.540]  But side issue, I just want you to know, if you hear me say something wrong sometimes,
[03:10:56.540 --> 03:11:03.420]  earlier I said 1540, a station was calling in and it was 540.
[03:11:03.420 --> 03:11:07.400]  The fact is, I'm not following a teleprompter, I'm not following a script here, I'm really
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:08.400]  telling you what I think.
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:12.580]  So you're gonna see some of that, but the point is, government non-military casualties
[03:11:12.580 --> 03:11:22.020]  200, 290 plus million people killed last century, and so we say demand a plan to stop
[03:11:22.020 --> 03:11:25.060]  government mass murder.
[03:11:25.060 --> 03:11:29.660]  And the video will go up at infowars.com for everybody to see it, and I want you to send
[03:11:29.660 --> 03:11:32.340]  it out on email, Twitter, Facebook, everywhere.
[03:11:32.340 --> 03:11:40.140]  Get it out to local talk stations, get it out to everybody, and again, it's now live
[03:11:40.140 --> 03:11:44.020]  on YouTube, Demand a Real Plan is what we call it.
[03:11:44.020 --> 03:11:50.300]  Demand a Real Plan, Demand a Real Plan, and we're gonna have the statistics that we have
[03:11:50.300 --> 03:11:51.540]  in it posted under it.
[03:11:51.540 --> 03:11:57.860]  She's also writing another article that'll be done soon that basically goes with it.
[03:11:57.860 --> 03:12:09.900]  But for Obama supporters, call in on your Obama phones, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[03:12:09.900 --> 03:12:13.380]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Montana.
[03:12:13.380 --> 03:12:15.300]  Dave, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:12:15.300 --> 03:12:25.100]  Alex, I support Obama because I hate the Republicans so much because they hate the 10th Amendment.
[03:12:25.100 --> 03:12:29.140]  They could have been in office, they could have ran away with the election.
[03:12:29.140 --> 03:12:36.500]  All they had to do was back up the 17 states that exercised the 10th Amendment-
[03:12:36.500 --> 03:12:37.500]  For marijuana.
[03:12:37.500 --> 03:12:46.740]  Allowed their people to use medical cannabis and to use cannabis to hemp, rutialis part
[03:12:46.740 --> 03:12:53.060]  of the cannabis for industry and jobs and- All right.
[03:12:53.060 --> 03:12:54.060]  And liberty.
[03:12:54.060 --> 03:12:57.940]  No, no, I hear you, I'm gonna go back to you, Dave, I'm gonna go back to you.
[03:12:57.940 --> 03:13:02.580]  This is the best Obama supporter call we've gotten in the five or six shows or sections
[03:13:02.580 --> 03:13:06.180]  of broadcasts that we've done cuz he actually has an issue.
[03:13:06.180 --> 03:13:11.500]  That thing about, the Republicans wanna take women's rights, I mean, that's just a pure
[03:13:11.500 --> 03:13:13.000]  political distraction.
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:17.580]  The state's rights issue, and I've supported decriminalization, I've supported legalization,
[03:13:17.580 --> 03:13:19.220]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:13:19.220 --> 03:13:24.740]  And I know all you do is get low quality marijuana full of pesticides and let the corrupt mafia
[03:13:24.740 --> 03:13:29.140]  and government get a percentage of it by making it illegal, just like in prohibition.
[03:13:29.140 --> 03:13:33.020]  I'm not a big supporter of alcohol, I think it's more destructive than marijuana.
[03:13:33.020 --> 03:13:37.540]  And I'm for drug decriminalization, but also I think the state shouldn't be involved in
[03:13:37.540 --> 03:13:38.540]  alcohol.
[03:13:38.540 --> 03:13:40.500]  It should be a local thing, a criminal thing.
[03:13:40.500 --> 03:13:44.420]  You poison somebody with alcohol you sold, you're going to prison.
[03:13:44.420 --> 03:13:48.180]  Now you poison somebody with alcohol, you just get a fine.
[03:13:48.180 --> 03:13:52.620]  But side issue, the thing I'm trying to get at here is Obama tripled the raids in California
[03:13:52.620 --> 03:13:55.340]  on medical cannabis.
[03:13:55.340 --> 03:14:00.460]  Triple the raids, look it up, I've had all the activists gone.
[03:14:00.460 --> 03:14:05.900]  So that's the bottom line on that front is that they did noises like they support.
[03:14:05.900 --> 03:14:10.300]  He said he was against the NDAA, but he actually wrote it, and then said he wouldn't sign it
[03:14:10.300 --> 03:14:11.300]  but did.
[03:14:11.300 --> 03:14:14.460]  See Obama, I'll tell you what Obama does.
[03:14:14.460 --> 03:14:24.300]  He gives you 15 pain pills to put you under, you pass out before he slits your throat.
[03:14:24.300 --> 03:14:30.860]  The Republicans, they want to just stab you in the back a couple times.
[03:14:30.860 --> 03:14:34.860]  But they don't give you any painkillers, and if you want to use that analogy.
[03:14:34.860 --> 03:14:39.100]  And that's the thing about it, it's not, I want to hear from Obama supporters why you
[03:14:39.100 --> 03:14:40.100]  think he's good.
[03:14:40.100 --> 03:14:43.660]  I mean, if you say, I don't like him either, but at least he did this, but see you're even
[03:14:43.660 --> 03:14:45.300]  really wrong about that.
[03:14:45.300 --> 03:14:50.260]  But I at least understand you had a thought, you had a reason in your mind you thought
[03:14:50.260 --> 03:14:51.260]  something was going on.
[03:14:51.260 --> 03:14:52.420]  Let me explain something.
[03:14:52.420 --> 03:14:54.980]  The globalists are gutting the economy, they're in control of that.
[03:14:54.980 --> 03:14:58.860]  They're 85 billion of themselves every month, on top of the trillions they already stole.
[03:14:58.860 --> 03:15:03.420]  And they're gonna pass on the inflation to us, I mean, it's both parties doing it.
[03:15:03.420 --> 03:15:07.980]  That's why I said, Boehner's gonna sell us out on tax increases, 77% of households got
[03:15:07.980 --> 03:15:12.260]  a tax increase, more than ten of them.
[03:15:12.260 --> 03:15:16.540]  Okay, so do you want to tell me how bad the Republicans are?
[03:15:16.540 --> 03:15:22.120]  The point is the Republicans represent the best people in this country.
[03:15:22.120 --> 03:15:28.700]  They are the people that soak up the energy of the libertarians, conservatives, constitutionalists
[03:15:28.700 --> 03:15:36.940]  who compared to the average Democrat are more productive, are more pro-human, pro-life,
[03:15:36.940 --> 03:15:37.940]  real people.
[03:15:37.940 --> 03:15:47.940]  Okay, I mean, the average Democrat I know is a helpless, disconnected from reality,
[03:15:47.940 --> 03:15:52.620]  visibly weak, stupid person who thinks they're real smart.
[03:15:52.620 --> 03:16:00.320]  The average Republican is a reactive, but hardworking person who's been conned as well,
[03:16:00.320 --> 03:16:04.300]  but at least believes in private property and the Second Amendment and national sovereignty.
[03:16:04.300 --> 03:16:11.260]  Sure, they've become territorially supportive of the Republicans, even though they don't
[03:16:11.260 --> 03:16:12.260]  really like them.
[03:16:12.260 --> 03:16:14.860]  It's kind of like a husband who doesn't really like their wife, but better not say something
[03:16:14.860 --> 03:16:19.300]  to my wife, buddy, or I'll punch your lights out.
[03:16:19.300 --> 03:16:22.380]  And the Democrats know they've taken over and they know the Republicans are bought off,
[03:16:22.380 --> 03:16:26.940]  so they know that conservatives are gonna leave Republicans and the whole party's just
[03:16:26.940 --> 03:16:27.940]  gonna die.
[03:16:27.940 --> 03:16:32.380]  And then it's gonna be a giant Democratic Party dictatorship to split in two, and that's
[03:16:32.380 --> 03:16:36.140]  actually been their plan, they're talking about that.
[03:16:36.140 --> 03:16:40.220]  Cancer divides, and they're just gonna hammer us up one side and down the other.
[03:16:40.220 --> 03:16:44.340]  When they legalize the 30 million illegals and let them bring in their families to have
[03:16:44.340 --> 03:16:48.500]  anchor babies paid for and everything, it's gonna further bankrupt stuff, drive down wages,
[03:16:48.500 --> 03:16:50.140]  they're exempt from all the laws.
[03:16:50.140 --> 03:16:54.140]  Again, not that they're bad people, they're leaving a country brought down by globalism
[03:16:54.140 --> 03:16:55.140]  as well.
[03:16:55.140 --> 03:16:57.500]  It's that they're given this free ride.
[03:16:57.500 --> 03:17:00.100]  Well, it's the same thing with any other group.
[03:17:00.100 --> 03:17:05.620]  You've got some Hispanic Mexicans who work harder than anybody I've ever seen, who are
[03:17:05.620 --> 03:17:09.940]  incredibly smart, know how to fix everything, politically know what's going on, and are
[03:17:09.940 --> 03:17:11.940]  good people.
[03:17:11.940 --> 03:17:14.660]  And they will not, cuz they're Christians, they're always Christians.
[03:17:14.660 --> 03:17:19.660]  They won't go take welfare, they're too prideful, they understand it's bad.
[03:17:19.660 --> 03:17:23.020]  And then you've got the other group, just like with whites or blacks, that wants the
[03:17:23.020 --> 03:17:24.700]  free ride.
[03:17:24.700 --> 03:17:28.380]  And it's just disgusting, and everybody's gonna have their future destroyed.
[03:17:28.380 --> 03:17:32.580]  All I'm telling you is, the people running things are super bad news.
[03:17:32.580 --> 03:17:36.500]  Let's go to Gordon in Canada, he is a Obama supporter, Gordon, go ahead.
[03:17:36.500 --> 03:17:40.060]  I was gonna go back to the other guy, but he hung up, go ahead, Gordon.
[03:17:40.060 --> 03:17:46.340]  Yeah, you mentioned that you believe the president is basically a puppet, is that correct?
[03:17:46.340 --> 03:17:50.820]  My gosh, he's an absolute New World Order puppet, but he enjoys his work.
[03:17:50.820 --> 03:17:58.020]  Okay, so we both agree on one thing, at least today, that the president is basically a puppet.
[03:17:58.020 --> 03:18:04.260]  And really, as a puppet, would you agree that he's basically ineffectual as a president,
[03:18:04.260 --> 03:18:06.260]  he's merely a puppet?
[03:18:06.260 --> 03:18:13.860]  Yeah, just like John Boner, John Boehner, but the spectacle of him being the leader,
[03:18:13.860 --> 03:18:18.100]  that's used to pacify people and to create a false debate.
[03:18:18.100 --> 03:18:27.100]  I think that as a leader, Obama has been one of the most influential leaders that the United
[03:18:27.100 --> 03:18:28.420]  States has ever seen.
[03:18:28.420 --> 03:18:33.580]  Yeah, no, no, Kissinger said that, he said Obama's gonna bring in the New World Order.
[03:18:33.580 --> 03:18:39.220]  Well, unfortunately, I probably would disagree with you there and say that it was probably
[03:18:39.220 --> 03:18:43.700]  Franklin Delano Roosevelt that brought in the New World Order a long time ago.
[03:18:43.700 --> 03:18:47.460]  Yeah, but a beachhead is not true domination.
[03:18:47.460 --> 03:18:52.540]  See, this country had so much wealth and so much power and was so wild, it's taken them
[03:18:52.540 --> 03:18:54.980]  80 years to get to this point.
[03:18:54.980 --> 03:19:01.660]  So see, that's an argument about, they may have declared a federal emergency and set
[03:19:01.660 --> 03:19:04.900]  up state police or a really federal police, I'm gonna skip this break and then go to the
[03:19:04.900 --> 03:19:05.900]  bottom of the hour.
[03:19:05.900 --> 03:19:09.620]  Go ahead and make your point, I'm gonna let you talk.
[03:19:09.620 --> 03:19:15.660]  Mr. Jones, I just flew into Canada, a very small country of 32 million people.
[03:19:15.660 --> 03:19:20.380]  I was relatively unaccosted at both security sides of the border.
[03:19:20.380 --> 03:19:27.860]  I enjoy a job that is based on free market society and the only reason that I'm able
[03:19:27.860 --> 03:19:32.700]  to enjoy the level of, or the standard of living that I do enjoy in the United States
[03:19:32.700 --> 03:19:37.660]  is because we have a stable government and right now, the United States government is
[03:19:37.660 --> 03:19:42.580]  one of the most stable governments in the Western Hemisphere and as long as the President
[03:19:42.580 --> 03:19:46.980]  of the United States is in power right now, I will continue to enjoy that standard of
[03:19:46.980 --> 03:19:47.980]  living.
[03:19:47.980 --> 03:19:52.900]  When I was living under the previous administration's standard of living, it was atrocious.
[03:19:52.900 --> 03:19:55.740]  The police state was far more worse than it is today.
[03:19:55.740 --> 03:20:00.340]  I understand where you're coming from, I do believe that we've probably stepped over the
[03:20:00.340 --> 03:20:02.220]  line in terms of personal liberty.
[03:20:02.220 --> 03:20:08.460]  But the goal so far is to start labeling the president or to question the president as
[03:20:08.460 --> 03:20:10.700]  integrity as a man.
[03:20:10.700 --> 03:20:15.060]  You and I really don't have the luxury of knowing the person or the human being.
[03:20:15.060 --> 03:20:23.860]  I disagree with that, you will know them by their fruits and the obsession over most Obama
[03:20:23.860 --> 03:20:28.420]  supporters I talked to who are intelligent will say the things you're saying.
[03:20:28.420 --> 03:20:31.580]  And then they'll say plus you don't know the man, you don't know what he's going through.
[03:20:31.580 --> 03:20:39.020]  Listen, I've really watched Obama carefully and I've read his earlier writings and he
[03:20:39.020 --> 03:20:44.060]  is just another narcissist wanting to dominate people and he's reading off teleprompters.
[03:20:44.060 --> 03:20:48.660]  I'm saying what Obama signifies and the time we're entering, by the way, I know a lot of
[03:20:48.660 --> 03:20:53.540]  folks have been in Canada lately, they say it was the worst security they ever went through.
[03:20:53.540 --> 03:20:56.340]  Now they must have you profiled, that's part of the police state and they're leaving you
[03:20:56.340 --> 03:21:00.380]  alone cuz your business, you go back and forth.
[03:21:00.380 --> 03:21:05.620]  Canada just worst experience I ever had at the hands of the quote police, well, not the
[03:21:05.620 --> 03:21:11.980]  worst but the worst as an adult, as a non teenager was there in Canada.
[03:21:11.980 --> 03:21:15.620]  So I mean, just to say I'm doing great, I'm doing good.
[03:21:15.620 --> 03:21:22.120]  All the financial metrics show the Republican and Democratic leadership are hand in glove
[03:21:22.120 --> 03:21:24.580]  with this banking takeover.
[03:21:24.580 --> 03:21:32.280]  And for certain people, the economy is doing better but overall worldwide, globalism is
[03:21:32.280 --> 03:21:35.940]  designed to render us bankrupt.
[03:21:35.940 --> 03:21:44.180]  And I mean, the globalist state they're using this to bankrupt us and Obama's trying to
[03:21:44.180 --> 03:21:49.060]  get carbon taxes through worldwide that are designed to block development in the third
[03:21:49.060 --> 03:21:53.860]  world clean development, cuz they don't want them ever becoming self sufficient.
[03:21:53.860 --> 03:21:57.300]  They want them poor, or they can hand pick cherry pick who they want to come into the
[03:21:57.300 --> 03:22:02.220]  armored compounds at the factories with the suicide nets, and then have forced abortions
[03:22:02.220 --> 03:22:03.220]  inside.
[03:22:03.220 --> 03:22:08.420]  I mean, I just know too much about the globalist, I mean, people tend to judge things by I mean,
[03:22:08.420 --> 03:22:12.680]  I guess I could sit here and say, I know a lot of conservative talk show hosts, libertarian
[03:22:12.680 --> 03:22:16.620]  talk shows, they go well, Alex, things are real bad, but at least, we're gonna get bigger
[03:22:16.620 --> 03:22:18.140]  audiences during this.
[03:22:18.140 --> 03:22:22.980]  And that's like saying, like if I own stock in a company that sold chemotherapy stuff
[03:22:22.980 --> 03:22:27.220]  and one of my kids had cancer and I'm like, well, at least I'm making money off the chemotherapy
[03:22:27.220 --> 03:22:29.020]  I just bought cuz I have stock in it.
[03:22:29.020 --> 03:22:35.780]  I mean, it's super hyper predatory and I've read all these books and papers by the top
[03:22:35.780 --> 03:22:39.500]  technocrats saying they're gonna set up a world government.
[03:22:39.500 --> 03:22:43.100]  They're gonna make it all look sexy and make it look like the bad stuff they're fighting,
[03:22:43.100 --> 03:22:47.500]  the good stuff they created, they're gonna shut the economies down.
[03:22:47.500 --> 03:22:51.760]  And they're going to forcibly reduce population.
[03:22:51.760 --> 03:22:54.980]  And then I talked to so called lefties and they go, well, there are old people do spend
[03:22:54.980 --> 03:22:57.100]  too much money at end of life.
[03:22:57.100 --> 03:22:59.100]  We are collectivist, let's get rid of them.
[03:22:59.100 --> 03:23:04.460]  I mean, that money that gets spent goes into the system to begin with and funds people.
[03:23:04.460 --> 03:23:05.740]  Is the medical system corrupt?
[03:23:05.740 --> 03:23:07.260]  Yeah, because they're teamed up with government.
[03:23:07.260 --> 03:23:08.860]  I mean, are there reforms?
[03:23:08.860 --> 03:23:12.460]  Yes, not the ones we're doing, it's gonna double the cost of health care.
[03:23:12.460 --> 03:23:17.020]  They talk about, see, it's gonna give you less care and charge you more for it.
[03:23:17.020 --> 03:23:23.120]  It's like you're gonna live in a 250 square foot house and pay 90% or 80% of your money
[03:23:23.120 --> 03:23:24.820]  in property tax.
[03:23:24.820 --> 03:23:29.620]  Whereas you put that same amount of energy you expended into work could have lived in
[03:23:29.620 --> 03:23:31.580]  a 3,000 square foot house.
[03:23:31.580 --> 03:23:34.460]  I mean, it's just diabolical.
[03:23:34.460 --> 03:23:39.140]  And I mean, look, they put cancer viruses and vaccines, I can show you all the documents
[03:23:39.140 --> 03:23:41.000]  I have before many times.
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:42.460]  These are bad people.
[03:23:42.460 --> 03:23:48.020]  They're doing medical experiments on kids in New York right now, on record.
[03:23:48.020 --> 03:23:53.580]  And people are like, but Obama, I got an Obama phone or people think the government made
[03:23:53.580 --> 03:23:55.540]  the economy good when they're in.
[03:23:55.540 --> 03:23:59.000]  And plus the economy is not good by most metrics.
[03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:02.980]  Just because you're doing good, I mean, here I am a talk show host reaching millions of
[03:24:02.980 --> 03:24:06.340]  people, have a big operation, you would call me successful.
[03:24:06.340 --> 03:24:08.820]  I feel successful for waking people up.
[03:24:08.820 --> 03:24:13.580]  I don't feel successful because I've got a new Ford pickup truck.
[03:24:13.580 --> 03:24:18.540]  I don't feel successful because people pull chairs out for me because I'm, quote, a celebrity.
[03:24:18.540 --> 03:24:20.300]  I mean, how do you gauge success?
[03:24:20.300 --> 03:24:21.300]  Go ahead.
[03:24:21.300 --> 03:24:28.020]  Success by the caliber of a person and the integrity of that person, not by his wallet.
[03:24:28.020 --> 03:24:34.580]  Mr. Jones, I have no doubt that your view of a world government is as such as it is.
[03:24:34.580 --> 03:24:37.540]  I've been listening to you for a number of years now.
[03:24:37.540 --> 03:24:39.580]  And I respect your opinions and views.
[03:24:39.580 --> 03:24:47.260]  However, I do disagree with you with regard to your sense of how quickly we're about to
[03:24:47.260 --> 03:24:49.140]  go over any precipice.
[03:24:49.140 --> 03:24:52.700]  When I travel around the world, one of the best countries that I'm always pleased to
[03:24:52.700 --> 03:24:55.900]  come back to is the United States of America.
[03:24:55.900 --> 03:24:58.740]  Yes, we have a very- But that's not the government.
[03:24:58.740 --> 03:24:59.740]  That's not the government.
[03:24:59.740 --> 03:25:03.020]  Everybody acts like the government made America.
[03:25:03.020 --> 03:25:04.660]  Guns made America, buddy.
[03:25:04.660 --> 03:25:06.140]  Whiskey made America.
[03:25:06.140 --> 03:25:07.140]  Freebooting.
[03:25:07.140 --> 03:25:10.620]  Pitching people's teeth in made this country.
[03:25:10.620 --> 03:25:12.220]  Obama did not make this.
[03:25:12.220 --> 03:25:13.860]  We made this country.
[03:25:13.860 --> 03:25:21.420]  But when we begin to target one individual and blame him for our collective woes, and
[03:25:21.420 --> 03:25:26.420]  incessantly, I mean, and constantly, I think we're really truly missing the target.
[03:25:26.420 --> 03:25:27.820]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:25:27.820 --> 03:25:31.740]  Do you think it's good to use taxpayer money to ship General Motors, Cadillac, and Volt
[03:25:31.740 --> 03:25:34.500]  factories to China?
[03:25:34.500 --> 03:25:38.980]  I understand that there are decisions that are being made in boardrooms all over the
[03:25:38.980 --> 03:25:44.580]  United States of America that are being made by individuals who are actually being controlled
[03:25:44.580 --> 03:25:50.220]  by individuals such as the big new Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger, and the likes of the law
[03:25:50.220 --> 03:25:51.220]  class.
[03:25:51.220 --> 03:25:52.820]  Exactly, and Obama is their golden child.
[03:25:52.820 --> 03:25:54.260]  I appreciate your call.
[03:25:54.260 --> 03:25:58.020]  It's, you know, tomorrow, we'll try to take more calls.
[03:25:58.020 --> 03:26:02.700]  And I just, you can talk in circles with each other all day.
[03:26:02.700 --> 03:26:07.340]  I mean, I don't even know what to say anymore.
[03:26:07.340 --> 03:26:13.540]  I'm not saying Mitt Romney would have been better.
[03:26:13.540 --> 03:26:17.740]  What is Cynthia McKinney, who's been so demonized with the corporate media say because she exposed
[03:26:17.740 --> 03:26:22.660]  government slave rings and things, sex slave rings, white slave rings, and the public so
[03:26:22.660 --> 03:26:26.220]  dumb they always send me emails saying, I see them printed out.
[03:26:26.220 --> 03:26:27.720]  What about black slaves?
[03:26:27.720 --> 03:26:30.060]  Sex slavery is called white slavery, folks.
[03:26:30.060 --> 03:26:38.020]  The point is, is that she says Obama is the more effective evil.
[03:26:38.020 --> 03:26:42.700]  He's not the lesser, he's not the greater, he's the more effective.
[03:26:42.700 --> 03:26:44.720]  It's real simple, okay, folks?
[03:26:44.720 --> 03:26:48.260]  If the globalists want your guns, you want guns.
[03:26:48.260 --> 03:26:50.820]  If the globalists say don't buy gold, you want gold.
[03:26:50.820 --> 03:26:55.900]  If the globalists say don't eat organic food, you want organic food.
[03:26:55.900 --> 03:27:00.700]  If the globalists say it's good to radiate your food, it's bad to radiate your food.
[03:27:00.700 --> 03:27:03.060]  And then you can go look at the reasons it's bad.
[03:27:03.060 --> 03:27:07.140]  But in every case, if they say something's good, you better believe it's bad.
[03:27:07.140 --> 03:27:12.420]  I mean, they call this modern world empowering women.
[03:27:12.420 --> 03:27:16.660]  Women aren't empowered, they look like they've been run over.
[03:27:16.660 --> 03:27:20.920]  They've been gaslighted into thinking they're ugly and they don't have any value when their
[03:27:20.920 --> 03:27:25.260]  family and everything is waiting for them and worshiping them.
[03:27:25.260 --> 03:27:26.940]  And they're running everything.
[03:27:26.940 --> 03:27:29.020]  Women have always been the center of everything.
[03:27:29.020 --> 03:27:32.940]  Women are running everything and they think they don't have anything, cuz the television
[03:27:32.940 --> 03:27:36.140]  is there showing them this imaginary Hollywood world.
[03:27:36.140 --> 03:27:38.900]  Let me tell you, that isn't what Hollywood's like.
[03:27:38.900 --> 03:27:44.560]  You can't keep me far, I'm not bragging, I get invited, not in as much as I used to.
[03:27:44.560 --> 03:27:54.260]  But I get invited to behind the scenes, huge world events, world concerts.
[03:27:54.260 --> 03:28:02.260]  You know, sky boxes at Formula One with the top five world rock band and he constantly,
[03:28:02.260 --> 03:28:04.580]  and it's not that I'm against those people, they're listeners.
[03:28:04.580 --> 03:28:08.380]  They wanna, maybe I should go meet with them and stand around all fancy with bodyguards
[03:28:08.380 --> 03:28:09.380]  and preen.
[03:28:09.380 --> 03:28:13.300]  I mean, I guess that is success, but that is not what I'm into.
[03:28:13.300 --> 03:28:18.860]  And not because I don't like status, I want status amongst thinkers.
[03:28:18.860 --> 03:28:21.540]  I want status amongst strong men and women.
[03:28:21.540 --> 03:28:29.380]  I want status amongst artists, not to be a peacock, but I want to influence them because
[03:28:29.380 --> 03:28:37.500]  I have a vein of primal human liberty that I want to infect people with.
[03:28:37.500 --> 03:28:45.780]  You understand, I don't just wanna have 15 children because I'm vain and like siring
[03:28:45.780 --> 03:28:46.780]  children.
[03:28:46.780 --> 03:28:49.020]  I want life, I wanna live forever.
[03:28:49.020 --> 03:28:53.580]  I wanna hug them and train them and see the electricity in their eyes.
[03:28:53.580 --> 03:28:58.980]  And I want their great, great grandchildren to be on Alpha Centuris, living to be 1,000
[03:28:58.980 --> 03:29:02.940]  years old, doing things that the eye has not seen or ear has not heard.
[03:29:02.940 --> 03:29:09.860]  I want to live, I want to produce, I want to let it all hang out.
[03:29:09.860 --> 03:29:13.820]  I don't wanna run around in some primitive monkey behavior and sit up on the top of the
[03:29:13.820 --> 03:29:18.180]  highest part of the tree like a chimpanzee with, I mean, you'll see arrogant chimpanzees
[03:29:18.180 --> 03:29:22.820]  or baboons acting just like humans sitting up there cuz the top one will sit there just
[03:29:22.820 --> 03:29:27.000]  lounge like a king, I'm in charge.
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:33.420]  That doesn't do anything for me, spacecraft, mathematics, art, beauty, that into the next
[03:29:33.420 --> 03:29:35.220]  level is what I want.
[03:29:35.220 --> 03:29:41.620]  I wanna see you win, the globalists wanna see you fall, I mean, it's real simple.
[03:29:41.620 --> 03:29:44.980]  The government is not your friend, it's cancer.
[03:29:44.980 --> 03:29:48.340]  Get the video at Infowars.com, get it out to everybody, the gun grabber video is now
[03:29:48.340 --> 03:29:49.860]  up there right now.
[03:29:49.860 --> 03:30:18.860]  On the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
