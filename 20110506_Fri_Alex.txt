[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.160 --> 00:19.680]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.680 --> 00:29.560]  alex jones it's the alex jones show live I'm Paul Joseph Watson editor and
[00:29.560 --> 00:34.280]  writer for prisonplanet.com filling in once again for alex jones while he's on
[00:34.280 --> 00:41.000]  the road on this Friday May 6 2011 edition and if you thought your
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.960]  intelligence had not been insulted enough by Obama and the establishment
[00:45.960 --> 00:52.720]  media over the bin Laden fable and stay tuned because the deception truly knows
[00:52.720 --> 00:58.960]  no bounds Steve Watson and Aaron Dykes coming up in the second half of the show
[00:58.960 --> 01:04.000]  and Aaron is going to be joined by top spy master worked under five U.S.
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.440]  presidents for his fourth installment of interviews this week on the alex jones
[01:09.440 --> 01:15.240]  show and that of course is dr. Steve R. Pachennick so be sure to tune in for
[01:15.240 --> 01:19.200]  that and we might get time for some of your calls in the next hour but I'm
[01:19.200 --> 01:23.480]  going to be joined at the bottom of the hour by Gerald Salente of the Trends
[01:23.480 --> 01:29.440]  Research Institute to talk about the real threats to the United States which
[01:29.440 --> 01:37.880]  go beyond the cartoonish bogeyman threat of Osama bin Laden and the CIA front
[01:37.880 --> 01:43.360]  group Al Qaeda but if you had some concerns about the fact that the bin
[01:43.360 --> 01:49.960]  Laden fable was collapsing amidst the deluge of deceit flip-flopping and these
[01:49.960 --> 01:55.880]  slippery narratives that the White House has to continually invent then fear no
[01:55.880 --> 02:01.840]  more because Al Qaeda themselves have now confirmed the absolute veracity and
[02:01.840 --> 02:07.960]  truthfulness of Obama's official story that he told to the nation about this
[02:07.960 --> 02:16.200]  bin Laden raid on Sunday night and of course Santa Claus and the two fairy
[02:16.200 --> 02:23.560]  also do exist that has been confirmed because the US government contractor S.
[02:23.560 --> 02:29.920]  I. T. E. Institute funded to the tune of half a million dollars a year by you
[02:29.920 --> 02:35.640]  guessed it the US government has posted a message on an internet forum and then
[02:35.640 --> 02:40.760]  pointed at it and said look Al Qaeda has now confirmed the absolute veritas of
[02:40.760 --> 02:46.960]  our fairy tale CNN reports Al Qaeda released a statement on jihadist
[02:46.960 --> 02:51.880]  forums confirming the death of its leader Osama bin Laden according to
[02:51.880 --> 02:57.400]  site intelligence group which monitors militant messages the statement
[02:57.400 --> 03:02.240]  translated by site lauded the late militant threatened to take action
[03:02.240 --> 03:07.160]  against the United States and urged Pakistanis to rise up and revolt now
[03:07.160 --> 03:13.200]  here's the problem site S. I. T. E. the group that's released this message
[03:13.200 --> 03:17.480]  confirming Obama's narrative of everything that happened on Sunday
[03:17.480 --> 03:23.840]  evening is nothing more than a front group for the US and Israeli intelligence
[03:23.840 --> 03:29.160]  community it's a propaganda conduit through which fake Al Qaeda tapes and
[03:29.160 --> 03:35.600]  statements are released as propaganda to justify this brutal and pointless war
[03:35.600 --> 03:41.120]  on terror which Obama and his administration are now aggressively
[03:41.120 --> 03:46.440]  reinvigorating with this post 9 11 intellectual castration of the American
[03:46.440 --> 03:51.600]  people that they're trying to whip up again as we approach the election cycle
[03:51.600 --> 03:57.360]  but the evidence that this site group is a US intelligence front doesn't consist
[03:57.360 --> 04:02.600]  of black helicopter fantasies as Time magazine would have it and it has nothing
[04:02.600 --> 04:08.800]  to do with Roswell or aliens as this weak Forbes magazine hit piece out today
[04:08.800 --> 04:14.400]  would have it because in my article on prisonplanet.com which you can go to
[04:14.400 --> 04:19.560]  right now it's the top story every single claim I make is documented with a
[04:19.560 --> 04:24.480]  link to the source that's something we just like to do mainstream media aren't
[04:24.480 --> 04:28.880]  too concerned about doing that because they don't report the facts all they're
[04:28.880 --> 04:32.720]  doing is trying to smear us forget trying to get to the bottom of this
[04:32.720 --> 04:40.160]  bin Laden fable the fact is that site is about as credible as Barney the purple
[04:40.160 --> 04:45.560]  dinosaur their history proves it this is an organization founded by the daughter
[04:45.560 --> 04:51.080]  of an executed Israeli spy this is an organization that receives half a
[04:51.080 --> 04:56.400]  million dollars a year directly from the US government this is a subsidiary of
[04:56.400 --> 05:00.800]  the pentagon and they claim that they're an independent group this is

[05:04.160 --> 05:08.120]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[05:08.120 --> 05:12.360]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[05:12.360 --> 05:16.640]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[05:16.640 --> 05:21.000]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.080]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[05:25.080 --> 05:29.640]  now a new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.640 --> 05:33.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.760 --> 05:37.480]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[05:37.480 --> 05:41.560]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[07:19.040 --> 07:23.800]  the crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM

[08:17.280 --> 08:22.840]  around about 24 past the hour to give his take on this unfolding bin Laden
[08:22.840 --> 08:27.200]  fable we got Aaron Dykes with Steve Picenic coming up later in the show and
[08:27.200 --> 08:31.920]  we'll try and get to some of your calls so CNN reports that Al Qaeda has
[08:31.920 --> 08:37.120]  conveniently come out and verified the official White House narrative of the
[08:37.120 --> 08:44.080]  bin Laden raid with this anonymous post on a message board but who's the who's
[08:44.080 --> 08:48.400]  the conduit for this information well it's our old friends at the site
[08:48.400 --> 08:53.800]  Institute who just by another coincidence have been caught red-handed in the past
[08:53.800 --> 08:58.600]  releasing fake Al Qaeda tapes and messages at the most politically
[08:58.600 --> 09:03.560]  expedient time for the Obama administration what an interesting
[09:03.560 --> 09:09.320]  coincidence as I was explaining before the break and this is all in my article
[09:09.320 --> 09:14.720]  on prisonplanet.com it's all documented not black helicopter fantasies as time
[09:14.720 --> 09:20.160]  magazine would have it nothing to do with Roswell as this bumbling weak Forbes
[09:20.160 --> 09:26.240]  hit piece tried to smear us from this is all fact source watch is the primary
[09:26.240 --> 09:32.000]  source of this that's the it's a wiki pediatype website that collates all
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.160]  information about specific organizations and this organization site that has
[09:37.160 --> 09:40.720]  released this Al Qaeda message today confirming everything that the White
[09:40.720 --> 09:45.560]  House says about the bin Laden raid founded by the daughter of an executed
[09:45.560 --> 09:51.160]  Israeli spy gets half a million dollars a year directly from the US government
[09:51.160 --> 09:55.560]  it's a subsidiary of the Pentagon it's basically a contractor to the US
[09:55.560 --> 10:00.600]  government this is an organization that has released Al Qaeda tapes before Al
[10:00.600 --> 10:05.760]  Qaeda itself has released them telling you again that the two organizations the
[10:05.760 --> 10:11.640]  as Sahab Al Qaeda so-called media arm and site as well as their sister
[10:11.640 --> 10:16.800]  organization Intel Center are one and the same that's why the logos on the
[10:16.800 --> 10:20.400]  videotape when they were analyzed were actually in the same frame because they
[10:20.400 --> 10:25.920]  were added at the same time not after Al Qaeda had released it in one case with
[10:25.920 --> 10:34.000]  the 2007 bin Laden 9 11 anniversary tape site released the tape before the Al
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.360]  Qaeda group so I mean it's a chicken and egg scenario these groups are one and
[10:39.360 --> 10:45.880]  the same and Rita Katz the founder of this group just happens to work very
[10:45.880 --> 10:49.200]  intimately with the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland
[10:49.200 --> 10:55.160]  Security and it's a front group it's a Trojan horse for releasing fake
[10:55.160 --> 11:00.000]  statements and tapes that claim to come from Al Qaeda but which actually
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.720]  emanate directly from the US government through this conduit and through the
[11:04.720 --> 11:10.000]  intelligence agencies that run Al Qaeda and it goes on I mean part of sites
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.520]  entire website was found to be wholesale copied lifted directly from the US
[11:15.520 --> 11:20.760]  State Department website their two thousand two thousand and three state
[11:20.760 --> 11:26.840]  patterns of global terrorism lifted wholesale onto the site website but
[11:26.840 --> 11:31.040]  don't worry because a very credible individual has now come forward and
[11:31.040 --> 11:37.000]  verified the veracity the credibility of this organization and it's none other
[11:37.000 --> 11:44.240]  than Blackwater's Eric Prince oh yes he of the mass murders in Iraq that's some
[11:44.240 --> 11:49.200]  good company to keep isn't it but he says that site is a perfectly proper
[11:49.200 --> 11:54.760]  reasonable truthful organization so I guess we can trust him but I mean just
[11:54.760 --> 11:59.120]  as they've come up trumps today with this Al Qaeda confirmation of you know
[11:59.120 --> 12:05.760]  Obama's furry tail as it collapses around him site has this convenient habit of
[12:05.760 --> 12:10.400]  releasing Al Qaeda tapes at the most politically expedient times for the
[12:10.400 --> 12:16.480]  Obama administration and indeed the Bush administration before that just two
[12:16.480 --> 12:22.560]  days after the bombshell story about Amar Alalaki who you know he's now being
[12:22.560 --> 12:27.320]  touted by the media as the new bin Laden they need a new bogeyman to replace
[12:27.320 --> 12:33.520]  him when the bombshell story about him visiting top brass at the Pentagon came
[12:33.520 --> 12:38.800]  out just weeks after 9-11 and bear in mind this is a guy who said they said
[12:38.800 --> 12:45.120]  ran the Fort Hood the Delta 253 the Times Square Pats is amongst a myriad of
[12:45.120 --> 12:51.640]  others two days after that story came out that he had been dining just weeks
[12:51.640 --> 12:56.040]  after 9-11 and he was supposedly in charge of the pats he's who flew flight
[12:56.040 --> 13:01.760]  77 into the Pentagon yeah he was visiting the top brass weeks later two
[13:01.760 --> 13:09.000]  days after that story hit the news site this institute that's in the news again
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.600]  today releases a videotape of Alalaki reaffirming his commitment to global
[13:14.600 --> 13:19.480]  jihad and celebrating the actions of Hassan the Fort Hood shooter the Times
[13:19.480 --> 13:25.560]  Square bomber as well as Abdul Mullah tab the Christmas Day Patsy so just 48
[13:25.560 --> 13:30.080]  hours after people start asking questions about why Alalaki is visiting
[13:30.080 --> 13:35.240]  the Pentagon when he's this so-called Al Qaeda mastermind site helpfully
[13:35.240 --> 13:40.200]  releases a tape with Alalaki saying no I'm fully committed to global jihad I'm
[13:40.200 --> 13:45.120]  a terrorist I support Hassan Times Square bomber Abdul Mullah tab it's all fine
[13:45.120 --> 13:51.520]  and dandy but that wasn't good enough on the same weekend site Institute
[13:51.520 --> 13:57.480]  released a tape of this Mossad intelligence agent Adam Perlman otherwise
[13:57.480 --> 14:03.440]  known as Al Qaeda leader Adam Gadan also praising Hassan the Times Square
[14:03.440 --> 14:09.960]  dud bomber and Abdul Mullah tab the fake Christmas Day Patsy you know well-dressed
[14:09.960 --> 14:14.160]  man got him on the plane he wasn't even aware of the fact they had this fizzle
[14:14.160 --> 14:19.200]  bomb and his underpants so it was basically two for the price of one in
[14:19.200 --> 14:23.600]  the very 48 hours after the whole war and terror was coming under increased
[14:23.600 --> 14:29.160]  scrutiny because of this Al Qaeda mastermind visits the Pentagon story site
[14:29.160 --> 14:36.080]  helpfully comes out and reaffirms the official view and I mean if you've got
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.360]  any doubts remaining that these Al Qaeda tapes and statements are the work of
[14:40.360 --> 14:45.800]  Mossad and the CIA just look at Adam Perlman himself I mean this is a guy
[14:45.800 --> 14:50.080]  that in his past in his college days wrote stinging essays condemning
[14:50.080 --> 14:54.800]  Muslims as quote bloodthirsty terrorists this is a guy who used to enjoy
[14:54.800 --> 15:01.120]  hanging around outside mosques to beat up Arabs and this is a so-called one of
[15:01.120 --> 15:05.960]  the primary leaders of Al Qaeda now this is a guy whose grandfather was none
[15:05.960 --> 15:11.080]  other than Carl K Perlman who was on the board of directors for the ADL which
[15:11.080 --> 15:17.040]  of course was caught spying on Americans back in the early 90s I mean he's got
[15:17.040 --> 15:22.360]  Mossad spy screaming out from every orifice a child of three could see
[15:22.360 --> 15:27.600]  that this guy's a double agent and yet site which is this organization in the
[15:27.600 --> 15:32.680]  news again today continues to release videotapes from him claiming to be you
[15:32.680 --> 15:37.600]  know Al Qaeda's top mastermind it's an insult to our intelligence and
[15:37.600 --> 15:43.040]  it's cartoonish propaganda a child could pick it apart and yet they're still
[15:43.040 --> 15:48.280]  bombarding the American people with this crap about this blatant Mossad agent
[15:48.280 --> 15:52.680]  beats up Arabs causing bloodthirsty terrorists but now he's the Al Qaeda
[15:52.680 --> 16:00.360]  leader how believable grandfather in the ADL I mean the proper it's like we were
[16:00.360 --> 16:06.200]  talking about yesterday with Paul Craig Roberts the propaganda is so weak it's
[16:06.200 --> 16:11.280]  so weak it makes you wonder if they're all it's just an inside joke with these
[16:11.280 --> 16:16.360]  people about how dumb down they've made the American people to even entertain
[16:16.360 --> 16:23.000]  this nonsense but now the same group funded by the US government tied at the
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.960]  hip with the US government run by the daughter of this Israeli spy puts out
[16:27.960 --> 16:34.360]  videos by this blatant Mossad spy Perlman caught putting out fake Al Qaeda
[16:34.360 --> 16:39.160]  videos we've got a list of when they did that in the article now tells us that a
[16:39.160 --> 16:44.360]  statement on a message board proves that Al Qaeda has confirmed every facet of
[16:44.360 --> 16:50.200]  Obama's official narrative and of course the lapdog mainstream media just
[16:50.200 --> 16:55.600]  instantly accepts it as gospel I mean I could find somebody who speaks Arabic
[16:55.600 --> 17:01.200]  Arabic to go on this message board and claim to be bin Laden himself in fact
[17:01.200 --> 17:05.240]  you know why don't we just have somebody who speaks Arabic call into the show and
[17:05.240 --> 17:11.080]  claim that they are a son of bin Laden alive and well because because you know
[17:11.080 --> 17:17.000]  if that standard of verification is good enough for CNN and Sky News a post an
[17:17.000 --> 17:23.360]  anonymous post on a message board fed to them by this Pentagon front then why
[17:23.360 --> 17:28.240]  can't it be good enough for the rest of us no we document our every claim with
[17:28.240 --> 17:33.280]  hyperlinks unlike the likes of Forbes magazine and Time magazine who just
[17:33.280 --> 17:39.520]  throw out glib statements about Roswell and you know black helicopter
[17:39.520 --> 17:43.600]  fantasies they document nothing it's all just
[17:43.600 --> 17:48.600]  sophomoric playground insults and it's pathetic and the majority of the
[17:48.600 --> 17:53.760]  American people and people globally are seeing right through it I mean you can
[17:53.760 --> 17:59.600]  go and read the comments you know Daily Mail New York Times CBS News ABC News
[17:59.600 --> 18:03.840]  read the stories about the terror fear mongering the propaganda but read the
[18:03.840 --> 18:09.400]  comments underneath the vast majority now just see right through it and yet they
[18:09.400 --> 18:15.560]  continue to put this out and it just doesn't seem to disturb them but now
[18:15.560 --> 18:21.080]  of course we have Osama's daughter and his wife say that their dad was killed so
[18:21.080 --> 18:25.600]  therefore it must be true again this has been fed to us by the same sources the
[18:25.600 --> 18:31.600]  government the Pentagon you know this is the same wife that was Osama's cowardly
[18:31.600 --> 18:37.360]  Osama's human shield that turned out to be absolute BS I mean who's to say if
[18:37.360 --> 18:42.600]  these people are even genuine you know or if they're not being tortured to say
[18:42.600 --> 18:46.640]  whatever they want them to say to continue this fable I mean they've been
[18:46.640 --> 18:50.880]  caught lying in every other instance about this narrative and so how are we
[18:50.880 --> 18:54.680]  supposed to believe them on this aspect you know first there's a 40 minute
[18:54.680 --> 19:00.520]  shootout that turns out to be one guy in another building across the street you
[19:00.520 --> 19:04.120]  know every aspect of it's been flip-flop that's why they're now saying that Jay
[19:04.120 --> 19:09.480]  Carney the the White House press secretary should basically be fired
[19:09.480 --> 19:14.560]  because he's trying to juggle all the lies and he just can't do it and he's
[19:14.560 --> 19:18.760]  exacerbated and you know the press corps are throwing all these questions at him
[19:18.760 --> 19:23.920]  saying trying to get the story straight and he just can't handle it anymore but
[19:23.920 --> 19:28.440]  don't worry because we've today we've got the DNA and the facial recognition
[19:28.440 --> 19:32.560]  evidence which has been promised to be released of course they didn't release
[19:32.560 --> 19:36.280]  the photo because they know it might end up like the birth certificate with a

[24:10.320 --> 24:27.440]  on the Alex Jones show May 6 2011 I'm Paul Joseph Watson editor writer for
[24:27.440 --> 24:32.560]  prisonplanet.com filling in for Alex today and we're joined on the road live
[24:32.560 --> 24:38.200]  by the man himself Alex Jones Alex it turns out we were wrong the US
[24:38.200 --> 24:42.880]  government funded Pentagon front group run by the daughter of an Israeli spy
[24:42.880 --> 24:48.720]  says that Al Qaeda has confirmed every aspect of Obama's bin Laden fairy tale
[24:48.720 --> 24:53.280]  well that's right I mean for years even the associated press will lower itself
[24:53.280 --> 24:58.120]  the level of pond scum by saying bin Laden says they're to strike with nukes
[24:58.120 --> 25:02.320]  next week or bin Laden says he's gonna hit us next month or and then at the
[25:02.320 --> 25:06.360]  bottom of the article it'll always say this was unconfirmed from a message board
[25:06.360 --> 25:10.920]  and we have the Intel Center with Rumsfeld uploading the Adam Gadon videos
[25:10.920 --> 25:15.960]  in the same layer with their logo with the Al Qaeda logo I mean this is just
[25:15.960 --> 25:20.480]  absolutely as tonight and it shows how desperate they're getting now that every
[25:20.480 --> 25:25.440]  aspect I mean think about it folks there's so-called situation room photo op
[25:25.440 --> 25:29.320]  wasn't even hooked to video they weren't watching anything they weren't running
[25:29.320 --> 25:33.680]  anything well absolutely the whole thing is a lie you know when I've been on
[25:33.680 --> 25:39.480]  national TV the last few days on Inside Edition Russia today you name it the
[25:39.480 --> 25:44.960]  host will sit there and say oh so 9-11 was a conspiracy and now this is a
[25:44.960 --> 25:50.840]  conspiracy well of course it is even 9-11 is a lie and a fraud and a hoax and
[25:50.840 --> 25:54.920]  the whole Al Qaeda situation is on record as your brother Steve covered
[25:54.920 --> 25:59.960]  yesterday with Clinton refusing to take bin Laden when he was under arrest in
[25:59.960 --> 26:05.240]  Sudan with Khaddafi's arrest warrant for bin Laden bin Laden tried to kill him
[26:05.240 --> 26:09.600]  and look at Al Qaeda attacking Khaddafi again I mean we happen to know the
[26:09.600 --> 26:13.600]  history we happen to be informed this is a hundred percent manufactured by
[26:13.600 --> 26:18.480]  outside groups that are staging terror against our country through agents in
[26:18.480 --> 26:22.000]  the government as a pretext to take all our rights and and that's why I'm
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.240]  popping in this hour and I'll pop in the last 15 minutes the next hour and I'll
[26:27.240 --> 26:31.200]  probably also pop in when Steve Pacenek is coming up again with more bombshell
[26:31.200 --> 26:36.980]  information Forbes's attack is for the Pacenek situation time New York
[26:36.980 --> 26:42.440]  magazine the Atlantic I mean it is all coming down right now because they're
[26:42.440 --> 26:46.760]  so scared but but here's the issue I've had time to really cogitate and think
[26:46.760 --> 26:53.840]  about what I think's going on right now and it's very clear they are getting
[26:53.840 --> 26:58.040]  ready to frame Pakistan they're seriously considering it for the next
[26:58.040 --> 27:02.360]  terror attacks here in the US claiming Al Qaeda's at Pakistan and oops they move
[27:02.360 --> 27:06.360]  the set piece if they want to invade Iraq say Al Qaeda's there if they want to
[27:06.360 --> 27:10.360]  invade Afghanistan say Al Qaeda's there they want to invade Sudan Al Qaeda's
[27:10.360 --> 27:14.040]  there if they want to invade Libya Al Qaeda's there oh but sorry Al Qaeda works
[27:14.040 --> 27:18.640]  for them in Libya Bush what five years ago signed that public order this was on
[27:18.640 --> 27:23.880]  White House.gov that four groups out of Iraq were being used inside Iran to bomb
[27:23.880 --> 27:29.560]  the government killed police and the media said then went further to say
[27:29.560 --> 27:37.040]  that Iran was working with Al Qaeda Iran is Shiite the opposite group of the
[27:37.040 --> 27:41.240]  Sunni Wahhabist out of Saudi Arabia Al Qaeda they hate each other more than
[27:41.240 --> 27:45.200]  anybody but here was the issue while our media was saying Iran was backing Al
[27:45.200 --> 27:50.480]  Qaeda three of the four groups that Bush sent in were known admitted Al Qaeda
[27:50.480 --> 27:54.360]  including at the time number three in Al Qaeda commanding one of the groups so
[27:54.360 --> 27:59.840]  Al Qaeda just like the attack the Serbs everybody else the Russians this is a
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.600]  tool of the global banking cartel that uses it to attack our country so they
[28:04.600 --> 28:08.880]  can wrap their unpopular policies in the flag but here's the biggest news and I
[28:08.880 --> 28:12.760]  told you this before 9-11 folks I'm telling you this now we're they are
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.640]  doing the preparatory groundwork and are clearly brainwashing the public and
[28:17.640 --> 28:23.000]  trial balloon testing this bin Laden hoax to see if they can stage massive
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.880]  terror attacks in Europe or the United States as a pretext for more wars but
[28:27.880 --> 28:32.160]  more importantly for domestic police state crack mounds here this is the
[28:32.160 --> 28:35.480]  greatest threat we have ever been under and the fact that we are officially
[28:35.480 --> 28:40.080]  challenging their fable and and and calling them on their fraud see a
[28:40.080 --> 28:44.760]  conspiracy theory is anybody that questions them anybody who's noticed
[28:44.760 --> 28:50.440]  they lie anyone who knows history they just have that label on on on on anyone
[28:50.440 --> 28:55.600]  that dare question their historical fairy tale narratives I mean be like if
[28:55.600 --> 29:00.080]  they told me Santa Claus was coming to my house next Christmas I'd say I don't
[29:00.080 --> 29:02.800]  believe in Santa Claus and they said first you didn't believe in Santa Claus
[29:02.800 --> 29:07.360]  when you were five then six then seven now you're 37 you still don't believe in
[29:07.360 --> 29:14.240]  it is this a new fantasy a new conspiracy theory that in 2011 you don't
[29:14.240 --> 29:18.160]  believe Santa Claus is coming Mr. Jones same thing oh you thought 9-11 was a
[29:18.160 --> 29:21.680]  conspiracy and now bin Laden's a conspiracy it was the same Santa Claus
[29:21.680 --> 29:27.600]  nine and a half years ago as this new Santa Claus it's all part of the same
[29:27.600 --> 29:31.440]  Santa Claus situation and no I don't believe in Santa Claus the tooth fairy
[29:31.440 --> 29:35.640]  or any of it we know the truth folks brace for massive stage terror attacks
[29:35.640 --> 29:40.280]  red alert red alert maximum alert get the word out to everyone we've got to warn
[29:40.280 --> 29:43.800]  everyone and because and we got to call the White House tell them don't stage the
[29:43.800 --> 29:47.040]  terror attack that all the White House advisors haven't calling for Gerald

[33:50.920 --> 33:55.880]  quarter of our defense budget a bloated homeland security apparatus that has at
[33:55.880 --> 34:00.120]  times pushed the bounds of civil liberty soaring oil prices partially
[34:00.120 --> 34:05.280]  attributable to the global war on bin Laden's terrorist network and a chunk
[34:05.280 --> 34:08.560]  of our mounting national debt which threatens to hobble the economy unless

[34:41.440 --> 34:46.840]  just want to get your take on the whole bin Laden circus show today we've got
[34:46.840 --> 34:52.080]  this US intelligence front saying that you know Al Qaeda itself has confirmed
[34:52.080 --> 34:57.520]  all the official narrative that Obama's put out even as the fable collapses
[34:57.520 --> 35:01.960]  around him with now even mainstream media journalists pointing out all this
[35:01.960 --> 35:07.520]  flip-flopping and deceit that's come out of the White House. What's behind the
[35:07.520 --> 35:12.960]  spectacle and how does Obama plan to use it to manipulate the American people
[35:12.960 --> 35:19.880]  as we head towards 2012? Well as we see it it's this is very important Paul to
[35:19.880 --> 35:27.240]  understand let's go back to four days before this happened April 27th Ben
[35:27.240 --> 35:34.240]  Bernanke made his first ever Fed's first ever press conference held this and by
[35:34.240 --> 35:39.320]  the time he finished the press conference gold prices shot up $20 an
[35:39.320 --> 35:47.320]  ounce silver went up $2 an ounce the dollar hit a three-year low and then
[35:47.320 --> 35:53.880]  two days later in the United States NATO the UK and France they bombed
[35:53.880 --> 36:00.760]  Gaddafi's son's home killed the son wiped out three of the kids and the
[36:00.760 --> 36:06.000]  tide was turning against Obama he was down in the polls his ratings were
[36:06.000 --> 36:13.360]  sinking the whole mentality has changed since this has happened as a comedy
[36:13.360 --> 36:18.560]  as this is and I don't know how any any living adult could believe one word that
[36:18.560 --> 36:24.560]  they're saying they've still been very successful in turning the tide the
[36:24.560 --> 36:30.880]  economic tide has been pushed back for a while and so they've accomplished
[36:30.880 --> 36:36.920]  something and what they've also done is they've reinstituted fear back in the
[36:36.920 --> 36:43.040]  people's minds and fear and hysteria are the two great cards to play by
[36:43.040 --> 36:48.160]  politicians does anybody ever forget George W. Bush this guy couldn't walk
[36:48.160 --> 36:52.280]  and chew gum at the same time you know and all of a sudden you know people
[36:52.280 --> 36:58.240]  started believing him because of all of this war on terror so it works and what
[36:58.240 --> 37:03.240]  Obama is doing and then you know the winter crats to me are the biggest
[37:03.240 --> 37:08.560]  hypocrites on the planet this guy's out pushing Bush by a long shot where they
[37:08.560 --> 37:12.920]  just send in and they just killed another 15 innocent people in Pakistan
[37:12.920 --> 37:18.200]  with predator drones oh excuse me suspected militants and some civilians
[37:18.200 --> 37:22.280]  that were near a restaurant you know what if this ever happened what if they
[37:22.280 --> 37:28.720]  started popping drones into the UK US and France boy we'd be at war really
[37:28.720 --> 37:33.880]  quick wouldn't we so what they've done is they've been successful in setting the
[37:33.880 --> 37:39.560]  stage for terror and the people bite at it at the first chop of the apple when
[37:39.560 --> 37:44.280]  it's put in front of them so we're going to see the terror card played that the
[37:44.280 --> 37:49.320]  terror bandwagon is rolling and it's going to roll right through to election
[37:49.320 --> 37:56.880]  day yeah and in your article bigger than bin Laden America's new public enemy
[37:56.880 --> 38:02.520]  number one you talk about this state of hysteria and I mean you had the the
[38:02.520 --> 38:06.600]  dichotomy about you know Obama's on Sunday night coming in front of the
[38:06.600 --> 38:11.160]  nation and saying the world is now safer but then you have Hillary Clinton the
[38:11.160 --> 38:15.080]  day after saying we need to redouble our efforts now we've got all these terror
[38:15.080 --> 38:21.240]  alerts about Al Qaeda wanting to derail trains we've got talk of TSA goons you
[38:21.240 --> 38:26.520]  know stationed in the malls putting their hands down our pants I mean doesn't
[38:26.520 --> 38:29.840]  that just represent the fact that they've exploited this to height and
[38:29.840 --> 38:34.200]  exactly what you said that state of hysteria and really I mean it's not
[38:34.200 --> 38:38.960]  about celebrating the death of bin Laden it's about using his death to just
[38:38.960 --> 38:43.920]  strike the fear of God into Americans exactly and that's exactly what they're
[38:43.920 --> 38:47.720]  doing that's what we're saying they're gonna keep this thing alive regardless
[38:47.720 --> 38:52.400]  of the fairy tale that they've told you know now most people don't know the
[38:52.400 --> 38:57.840]  details of the lies you know first it was a fire fight then it wasn't then he
[38:57.840 --> 39:02.240]  used his wife as a human shield and then he did and you know one after another
[39:02.240 --> 39:07.320]  most people don't know that they only hear the first lie they don't tune in
[39:07.320 --> 39:11.920]  you know most people you know this is America's snookies stupid let's you
[39:11.920 --> 39:16.320]  know this dancing with the stars they don't know the details all they know
[39:16.320 --> 39:22.520]  the headlines so it's working very very well for them as I mentioned it's
[39:22.520 --> 39:28.760]  changed the tide the country the world was freaking out if the public enemy
[39:28.760 --> 39:36.880]  number one Osama bin Bernanke got on stage and told the world that hey listen
[39:36.880 --> 39:41.520]  we're gonna keep interest rates low what does that mean oh we're gonna keep
[39:41.520 --> 39:47.800]  money really cheap so the Ponzi game could continue to be played and when I
[39:47.800 --> 39:53.240]  say the global Ponzi scheme I'm not saying that lightly I'm repeating the
[39:53.240 --> 40:02.440]  words from the king of Ponzi Bernie Madoff a February 27th New York magazine
[40:02.440 --> 40:08.240]  an article that was done by her tape recording telephone recording where
[40:08.240 --> 40:12.720]  Madoff said the two things that popped out in my mind in this other worthless
[40:12.720 --> 40:18.240]  article about how sorry Bernie is not the two things that stuck out with that
[40:18.240 --> 40:24.040]  he said the game is rigged he learned that early on when he went to Wall
[40:24.040 --> 40:28.160]  Street that it was a club in the game was rigged and the number two thing he
[40:28.160 --> 40:35.040]  said the US is nothing more than one big Ponzi scheme I believe Bernie and and
[40:35.040 --> 40:40.480]  so the Ponzi scheme is they're keeping risk low they're letting the game
[40:40.480 --> 40:46.640]  continue to be played so with money being cheap the world was freaking out the
[40:46.640 --> 40:53.520]  equity markets spoke but now Obama he got you know there's both jangles man he
[40:53.520 --> 40:59.320]  hit the stage dancing and and you saw all the prostitutes out there bowing
[40:59.320 --> 41:05.240]  scraping I can't watch CNN anymore I can't watch MSNBC anymore I can't watch
[41:05.240 --> 41:10.400]  the nightly news anymore it's an insult to anybody's thinking intelligence these
[41:10.400 --> 41:15.160]  people as I said the media in the United States are nothing more than
[41:15.160 --> 41:20.560]  prostitutes the only difference is this time you pay for it and you don't get a
[41:20.560 --> 41:27.120]  happy ending well exactly you've got you've got people on the White House
[41:27.120 --> 41:32.600]  launch and in USA USA because they supposedly found this guy holed up in a
[41:32.600 --> 41:38.920]  house in Pakistan meanwhile the number one global financial terrorist Mr. Ben
[41:38.920 --> 41:45.240]  Bernanke continues to launch his sustained terror attack against the US dollar as
[41:45.240 --> 41:49.680]  you mentioned last week we're here three year low against the Swiss rank I mean
[41:49.680 --> 41:54.440]  you've got the price of oil going up even though it's kind of flat oil over
[41:54.440 --> 41:57.960]  the last month is kind of flat doesn't mean the prices at the pump are going to
[41:57.960 --> 42:02.240]  go down every time I visit the petrol station it's gone up again no matter what
[42:02.240 --> 42:07.560]  the price of oils doing but we've got that we've got inflation skyrocketing
[42:07.560 --> 42:12.600]  but I mean even the European Central Bank has raised their rates they held off
[42:12.600 --> 42:17.840]  yesterday but they've raised them are we ever going to see the Fed raise the
[42:17.840 --> 42:21.800]  interest rates Gerald or are they just going to continue to devalue the green
[42:21.800 --> 42:27.240]  back out of existence even as everybody rushes to the exit they're going to keep
[42:27.240 --> 42:31.960]  re devaluing the dollar that's exactly what they're doing and of course the
[42:31.960 --> 42:36.840]  debt is getting cheaper to be paid off as the dollar becomes more devalued let's
[42:36.840 --> 42:43.640]  make this really clear what did what were the practical consequences of all
[42:43.640 --> 42:48.560]  of of killing if they did Osama bin Laden I don't think I don't believe a
[42:48.560 --> 42:52.200]  thing you know they threw him in the ocean you know what are they they call
[42:52.200 --> 42:56.720]  the mafia and fit him with some cement shoes you know was he sleeping with the
[42:56.720 --> 43:01.720]  fishes and you can't make this stuff up you know we can't show the photos and
[43:01.720 --> 43:05.640]  who's going to believe him anyway but what did it do we're still losing the
[43:05.640 --> 43:10.600]  wars in Afghanistan and Iraq the unemployment rate just went up again
[43:10.600 --> 43:15.520]  to 9% in the US and there's no it is no end in sight over in Europe the
[43:15.520 --> 43:22.720]  Portugal Spain Ireland Greece Italy one after another they're going to either go
[43:22.720 --> 43:27.560]  into recession and depression and as you mentioned out Trichet just held back in
[43:27.560 --> 43:33.200]  raising interest rates again because they're afraid to raise them they raise
[43:33.200 --> 43:40.000]  interest rates the global Ponzi scheme collapses did it do anything to reverse
[43:40.000 --> 43:45.560]  the failing real estate market no this old this thing is nothing more than
[43:45.560 --> 43:53.680]  theater just like 9-11 what they did following 9-11 was they lowered interest
[43:53.680 --> 44:00.920]  rates to 46 year lows because the white shoe boys were taking a beating from the
[44:00.920 --> 44:09.680]  dot-com bubble burst in March of 2000 just several months before now I mean
[44:09.680 --> 44:14.400]  anyone with two brain cells to rub together can figure out that the
[44:14.400 --> 44:20.360]  economic policies of the Fed of this administration and the one before it
[44:20.360 --> 44:25.480]  lead into the basically the end of America as a global economic superpower
[44:25.480 --> 44:30.440]  we had the IMF a couple of weeks ago even come out and put a date on it 2016
[44:30.440 --> 44:36.880]  Gerald why why on the one hand are they launching all these wars for political
[44:36.880 --> 44:41.360]  hegemony you know Libya being the latest example cost them over a billion
[44:41.360 --> 44:47.280]  dollars in the first week alone now we've got articles that it was three
[44:47.280 --> 44:53.160]  trillion to capture bin Laden I mean why are they launching these wars when
[44:53.160 --> 44:57.720]  simultaneously they're allowing the country's economic base to rot from
[44:57.720 --> 45:04.000]  within because there's sociopaths and psychopaths it's because there were
[45:04.000 --> 45:11.040]  general Dwight D Eisenhower five-star general two-term Republican president
[45:11.040 --> 45:16.080]  supreme commander the allied forces weren't one the American people as he was
[45:16.080 --> 45:20.600]  leaving office that the military industrial complex has taken over the
[45:20.600 --> 45:26.320]  nation and it has they robbed us of the genius of our scientists the sweat of
[45:26.320 --> 45:30.560]  our labors in the future of our children just like he said and look what's
[45:30.560 --> 45:37.000]  going on now now that's even worse than that it's a military intelligence slash
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.000]  industrial complex we just saw the revolving door opened when they're
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.800]  taking general Petraeus after losing at again in Afghanistan failing his way in
[45:47.800 --> 45:53.800]  Afghanistan now being slated for CIA director so look at the people if
[45:53.800 --> 45:59.120]  someone was to do a psychological profile on them they would they would
[45:59.120 --> 46:04.040]  come in between most politicians somewhere ranging between psychopath and
[46:04.040 --> 46:10.120]  sociopath look look at this guy that you have on CNN now prime time Elliot
[46:10.120 --> 46:15.000]  Spitzer you want to look at a sociopath you can't put a better label on it
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.160]  here's a cat that passes the John Law in New York when he's governor if he get
[46:20.160 --> 46:26.120]  caught with a hooker you get time you get busted this guy gets cook gets caught
[46:26.120 --> 46:31.040]  with thousand dollar and night hookers and what does he do he brings his wife
[46:31.040 --> 46:39.120]  out onto the stage and like a little weenie he cries oh I'm sorry you're
[46:39.120 --> 46:44.680]  sorry a guy I'm sorry I got caught and what do they do they reward him with his
[46:44.680 --> 46:51.040]  own television show I mean do you need any more evidence to see that what's
[46:51.040 --> 46:55.840]  going on here when they say that politics is nothing more than show
[46:55.840 --> 47:03.680]  business for ugly people tune in CNN it's a sick society and in a sick
[47:03.680 --> 47:08.160]  society I mean the psychopaths get rewarded with the money and the fame
[47:08.160 --> 47:13.320]  and they're promulgated and put up there as the examples to how other Americans
[47:13.320 --> 47:16.520]  should live their lives which is why people are you know getting to the
[47:16.520 --> 47:19.600]  habit of screwing each other and think that they're gonna get ahead in life
[47:19.600 --> 47:23.360]  when it's a complete fable and I mean people like that are perfectly
[47:23.360 --> 47:28.440]  illustrate you know that concept but I want to talk about this jobs data today
[47:28.440 --> 47:35.360]  in April 2010 the Ever Trust were the vice president Joe Biden assured us that
[47:35.360 --> 47:42.160]  the Obama administration will create 250 to 500 thousand jobs a month every
[47:42.160 --> 47:47.360]  month this jobs data today is being celebrated you know like it's some
[47:47.360 --> 47:52.480]  amazingly positive announcement even though the official unemployment figure
[47:52.480 --> 47:57.160]  and I say official is at 9% because of course we know the real figure is far
[47:57.160 --> 48:03.360]  higher in fact we had the we had the report last week where fewer than 45
[48:03.360 --> 48:09.880]  percent of Americans actually have a job today now Gerald in reference to your
[48:09.880 --> 48:15.360]  first great war of the 21st century piece recently for the Trends Journal
[48:15.360 --> 48:20.640]  this job situation this unemployment can you explain where it's leading to and
[48:20.640 --> 48:27.080]  how soon we can expect the outcome of it to hit home in America well look what's
[48:27.080 --> 48:33.000]  going on also with the administration said back when they passed the the so
[48:33.000 --> 48:40.320]  called Stimulus Recovery Act in 2009 they said that by now unemployment would
[48:40.320 --> 48:46.520]  be 7% so of course they were way off on that but you look Paul look around the
[48:46.520 --> 48:53.520]  world and what's gone on whether it's Tunisia Egypt Libya you name the
[48:53.520 --> 49:00.320]  country Bahrain Yemen under underlying a lot of this and of course
[49:00.320 --> 49:05.600]  Libya is a different case in the sense that it's also been provoked by NATO but
[49:05.600 --> 49:10.600]  in by and large and then in Europe you're seeing the same thing who are the
[49:10.600 --> 49:16.240]  protesters they're young people what's the unemployment rate in Spain for people
[49:16.240 --> 49:24.120]  between the ages of 18 and 26 around 50% Greece same thing look in the US what
[49:24.120 --> 49:28.240]  they're not adding on to the unemployment roles or all of these young people that
[49:28.240 --> 49:33.520]  are getting out of college and holding university degrees and worthlessness so
[49:33.520 --> 49:40.120]  now put it all together you're educated your hormones are raging you know no
[49:40.120 --> 49:46.400]  limits at that age and you know the score every the price of everything is
[49:46.400 --> 49:50.800]  going up and you have a futureless future and there's corruption at the top
[49:50.800 --> 49:55.480]  hey did you see the other number that just came out today great news for the
[49:55.480 --> 50:01.800]  CEOs they're making those pre-recession level earnings again the gap between the
[50:01.800 --> 50:06.320]  rich and the poor for example in the United States is the widest of any of
[50:06.320 --> 50:11.080]  the industrialized nations when I was a young man and into the workforce the
[50:11.080 --> 50:16.920]  gap between the CEO and the average worker was about 35 40 to 1 now it's
[50:16.920 --> 50:22.960]  around 500 to 1 so here's the deal you take to the streets that's what's
[50:22.960 --> 50:29.080]  behind all of this it has nothing to do with autocracy or democracy or monarchy
[50:29.080 --> 50:35.880]  it has to do with when the money stops flowing down to the man on the street the
[50:35.880 --> 50:42.040]  blood starts flowing in the streets we'll be back after the break with Gerald

[51:59.480 --> 52:06.520]  today hi this is Alex Jones the real US unemployment rate is now 22% and not
[52:06.520 --> 52:10.280]  nine like what we are told by the mainstream media the primary instinct
[52:10.280 --> 52:14.080]  of unemployed Americans is to go to college and seek a higher education but
[52:14.080 --> 52:17.640]  all across America students are graduating with hundreds of thousands

[54:41.520 --> 54:46.920]  trendsresearch.com just go to trendsresearch.com and click on the
[54:46.920 --> 54:52.920]  the photo of the trends journal it's the first great war Paul of the 21st
[54:52.920 --> 54:59.320]  century has begun when all else fails they lead you to war and that's where
[54:59.320 --> 55:05.480]  we're headed to you can you can only again it's just as people could be in
[55:05.480 --> 55:11.240]  ep not to believe the great Osama bin Laden lie they have to be brain dead to
[55:11.240 --> 55:16.560]  see where they're not where they're leading us it's one more after another
[55:16.560 --> 55:23.540]  Obama took us to war against Libya as did Sarkozy or Sarko the American in
[55:23.540 --> 55:29.320]  France and that little weenie Cameron over there in the UK without ever asking
[55:29.320 --> 55:34.760]  the people that's how quick you go to war and then you add in that the
[55:34.760 --> 55:43.120]  terrorism wildcard false flag or not and you see it happening so we're warning
[55:43.120 --> 55:47.640]  people that they better take precautionary measures now because the
[55:47.640 --> 55:53.000]  war drums are beating and I mean you predict today I remember at
[55:53.000 --> 55:59.160]  prisonplanet.com back in 2008 I was writing articles about your prediction
[55:59.160 --> 56:03.200]  of these tax revolts coming and these riots and that's exactly how it
[56:03.200 --> 56:07.360]  unfolded in Europe and of course America is the next stepping stone we
[56:07.360 --> 56:12.000]  currently have widespread unrest in the Middle East so basically half the globe
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.280]  has been inflamed with these riots so you know we'd be naive to think that
[56:16.280 --> 56:20.320]  they're not gonna spread even further just a quick one that I I wanted to get
[56:20.320 --> 56:28.000]  your take on oil lost about 9% yesterday gold got hammered the euro's getting
[56:28.000 --> 56:34.120]  batted again today they're talking about a bloodbath for commodities is this is
[56:34.120 --> 56:38.440]  this any kind of fundamental shift or is it merely a kind of correction to the
[56:38.440 --> 56:44.760]  general trend you know I I'm not sure I am I'm still bullish on gold because gold
[56:44.760 --> 56:49.480]  is a safe haven and I've made this very clear over many many interviews that I
[56:49.480 --> 56:55.400]  had some silver 80% in gold and and yes the commodities you know these be there
[56:55.400 --> 57:00.680]  there's a lot going on here because if this world economy is going to slow
[57:00.680 --> 57:06.680]  down the way I believe it's going to yes to supply and demand ratios going to
[57:06.680 --> 57:13.240]  change however by the devaluation of the dollar the commodity prices stay high
[57:13.240 --> 57:18.480]  because as you well know many of these commodities are dollar-based but I do
[57:18.480 --> 57:24.600]  think that the silver unwinding the considering that the Chicago Mercantile
[57:24.600 --> 57:31.720]  Exchange had had increased margins by what 84% within just a couple of weeks
[57:31.720 --> 57:36.640]  or days you know that's going to put a damper on things on silver particularly
[57:36.640 --> 57:43.160]  for a while but I that's our forecast and I also want to mention that although
[57:43.160 --> 57:46.480]  there's the Europe is going to be the next one to fall by the way the next
[57:46.480 --> 57:50.760]  domino and that the only thing that's holding it back over there is that the
[57:50.760 --> 57:54.960]  Europeans unlike the Middle East and North Africa are still living under the
[57:54.960 --> 57:58.560]  illusion that they have a democracy so they think they're going to make the
[57:58.560 --> 58:03.360]  changes at the ballot box oh yes sure you know you've heard me say before it's
[58:03.360 --> 58:07.920]  like voting for the Gambino's of the Bananos you know by going and voting for
[58:07.920 --> 58:12.720]  one of the major parties so that's going to forestall things a little bit but
[58:12.720 --> 58:17.480]  back in the USA as I mentioned the people are snookies stupid they're
[58:17.480 --> 58:22.760]  junk food fattened and prescription drug addicted so they're not going to be
[58:22.760 --> 58:26.840]  fighting you know people say you know where's the fight in America they
[58:26.840 --> 58:31.080]  become wussies I mean it's these aren't these aren't mommy's boys they're
[58:31.080 --> 58:35.560]  soccer mommy's boys stay there Gerald Salento will be right back with your

[59:53.360 --> 01:00:01.000]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:12.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:20.040]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:27.200]  Alex Jones second hour of the Alex Jones show live Paul Joseph Watson
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.840]  editor and writer for prisonplanet.com filling in for Alex who will return to
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:38.600]  the show later in the next hour just a note on the commodity thing before we
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.800]  go to your calls with Gerald Solante of Trends Research Institute I mean back in
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:50.120]  2008 and 2009 we got this explosion of adverts in America and in the UK you
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:57.080]  know sell your useless gold and silver for cash while simultaneously in places
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.280]  like China the government actually came out and encouraged their population to
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:06.360]  buy silver and gold and I was in China recently last month in Shanghai and
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:12.000]  basically on every street corner there's a huge gold shop selling gold and
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.960]  silver I mean the demand in China has gone absolutely nuts and this this
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:22.040]  correction we've had over the past few days I think is exactly that because the
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:27.680]  demand in China and India judging from everything I've seen is just basically
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:33.880]  through the roof. Sean in Texas you're on the air with Gerald Solante go ahead.
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:41.800]  Howdy real quick first off it's a privilege to speak to you Mr. Solante my
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:46.960]  question is please describe as best as you can not the things that have already
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.240]  been happening because I see so many things happening according to because I
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:56.000]  listen to you a lot but describe the most reliable combination of events that
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.240]  you think that we could possibly or reasonably expect to see say maybe a
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:06.560]  week or even the day before the final collapse of the US dollar and maybe when
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:13.000]  hyperinflation kicks in. It's really your timing is really I've been at this
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  over 30 years timing is really tough there's so many wild cards and that's
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.240]  what I would look for a wild card event it's just like one morning you woke up
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.360]  and all of a sudden or one night you you you heard on it was you if you're
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:29.840]  watching a ballgame that they killed Osama bin Laden as I mentioned the whole
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:35.800]  the whole made the whole context of what was going on changed so you don't know
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:41.160]  and yet the other thing you can't tell is that the schemes undreamed of for
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:46.120]  example who would have known that the people when they when they finally showed
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:49.720]  us the minutes so that the federal minutes of who went to the Fed discount
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:54.440]  window that most of the countries would have been foreign nations you know if
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:58.960]  anybody has any any doubts about the New World Order all you have to do is look
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:04.400]  at that one you can see who got most of the money it was it was foreign banks so
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.680]  you don't know these things so it's very hard to put a timetable on it who
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.320]  would have known that the Federal Reserve was doing 20 trillion with a T
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:21.840]  of backdoor deals in 2009 and 2010 to keep the Ponzi scheme scheme going and
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.960]  money going to hedge funds general electric and to banks around the world
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:34.440]  so the timing is tough and having said that as a close combat martial artist
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:39.600]  we have a wonderful story in there by the way from Brad Steiner one of the
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.640]  foremost close combat masters in the United States and he has the different
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:51.200]  codes the different the real code levels the colors not the BS from the from the
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:57.080]  TSA but you should always be on yellow alert and most people are on white
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:02.120]  they're on blank and that's what we're saying because right now what we're
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.720]  saying is prepare for the worst if the worst doesn't happen right away what
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:11.160]  did you lose but if the worst happens and you're not prepared you lose
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.920]  everything thanks for the call Gerald you were talking about it's gonna come to

[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.400]  this literally about 10 minutes ago you said it was coming to Europe first is
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:05.440]  this the kind of domino effect that could eventually kill the euro basically
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:09.960]  absolutely and it's not only in a kill the euro it's going to take the world
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:15.440]  to war you know they teach us as little kids you know all wars have started over
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.800]  religion now they're not you know it see you go back to the Bible you know it's
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:25.000]  the love of money that's the root of all evil and that's what's going on here
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.040]  you have money junkies they're losing dough and they want the people to pay
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:34.120]  for their fix and so what we're saying again we had predicted that the fall of
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:39.600]  the euro when they established the euro we said that it was going to work for a
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:45.200]  while as the new trend of globalization caught fire but it would it would fall
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:50.200]  apart because of the inequality of the nations involved in it so again it was
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:54.400]  a trend that you can see coming but of course nobody wanted to believe it when
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.720]  times were fat and now what we're going to another one Paul as you well know
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:04.920]  they had the vote in Finland a couple of weeks ago where the true Finns won and
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:09.560]  they're very anti-euro and anti bailout and in order for these bailouts to
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:15.080]  happen all of the countries have to agree upon it we're looking again that
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:21.680]  these are not one offs you put all the pieces together and it's leading us to
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:28.680]  the first great war of the 21st century this is the kind of it looks like it's
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:34.160]  an economic issue it's a war issue and oh by the way if you want to look at some
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:38.920]  more psychopaths look at the Greeks look at the money that they're dumping into
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.520]  defense you know like the Greek could Greece could defend themselves it's
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:48.040]  money it's that it's the dirty game it's kind of like listening to the news
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:52.640]  yesterday and saying that the United States is going to take the Libyan
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:57.320]  government's money and give it to the rebels that's not what they're saying is
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:02.000]  the United States a bunch of the criminals over there stole the money and
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.780]  now they're doing dirty deals with another group of bandits Derek in
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:12.560]  California you're on the air of Gerald Slent say go ahead all right thank you
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:17.120]  for having me on and I appreciate all the work and I just have a quick comment
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:22.920]  and a question I just want to say people came to the point where we really need
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.680]  to start taking to the streets and just informing everyone you come across
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:30.920]  because it's just getting a little bit ridiculous with I'm trying to pull this
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:35.640]  latest and lot in thing off and I think people a lot of people are buying into
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.880]  it but more people are really I mean with that thing and the sea some dumping
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:44.000]  into the sea that should nail in the coffin everybody's is really like hey
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.560]  what's going on so I'd say just let people know let people know the lot in
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.120]  history let people know about all this false flags and everything and I would
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.560]  just really encourage everybody to do that now just quick questions I've been
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:03.920]  hearing a lot of talk about you know nuclear wars or whatever there could be
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:09.680]  an attack over here in the United States or and I just wanted to get both of
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:14.760]  your takes Paul and Gerald on how serious do you think this threat is you you
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:17.760]  really think that they'll do something like that I mean I mean I wouldn't be
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:22.160]  surprised but I just want to know how serious do you think that threat is and
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:29.280]  where do you think they would attack you know if they were to do that well first
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.600]  of all Derek I totally agree with you people have to stand up and speak out
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:39.200]  and and forget this politically correct crap and and say what they believe
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.120]  and understand that you know it's it's we the people and that's the only way
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.960]  things are going to change and I also have to say morals count and and values
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:54.040]  change but morals don't and everyone has to ask themselves are they living by
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:59.760]  the golden rule and I I make it's very clear that for us to succeed we have to
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:04.480]  be in shape physically emotionally and spiritually and there's that old Buddhist
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.720]  saying when the teachers when the students ready the teacher appears the
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:13.760]  students have to get ready to answer your question if my name was Momar
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:19.000]  Gaddafi and they just killed my kid and bought to keep bombing my country you
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.720]  think I'd want to get even and in these days and one of my books by the way
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:29.560]  trends 2000 came out in the mid 90s and I wrote about all of the breakup of the
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:34.560]  Soviet Union and all of the nuclear weaponry and suit case say suitcase
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.360]  size nukes that were available were on the black market yeah boom goes London
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:45.840]  boom Paris how about a dirty bomb here how about some biological warfare there
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:52.040]  or a suitcase size nuke here of course they're taking us to war it's not going
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.360]  to be like World War two you heard the lines before the generals are always
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:02.120]  fighting the last war and by the way when you look at the generals look at the
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:08.520]  picture of that that phony set up of the White House as sensibly another lie
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:13.640]  that was retracted about them watching the the emission take place and look at
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:18.520]  that general on his computer this guy couldn't lead me across the street I
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.720]  bet he can't run around the block so these are the kind of people that are
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:28.200]  leading us and making decisions nothing is going to stop it from happening look
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:32.320]  at the immigrants pouring over the border you think they're going to stop stop some
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:37.440]  new millennium with terrorists from seeping over our borders so we're
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:43.000]  saying it's going to happen with a false flag or not well I mean that's the
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.200]  whole point in some senses they don't even need to conduct false flag when
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:52.600]  you kill people's children you drone attack Pakistan and Yemen and kill
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.520]  people at a wedding or a restaurant they're going to rile enough you know
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.440]  they're going to rile up enough people for them to take their own revenge and
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:05.120]  then of course they've always got the the false flag in the back pocket George
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:10.080]  in Indiana you're on the air Gerald's plenty go ahead Gerald before we go
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.920]  ahead I want to just comment on what you said and what they do when the United
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:21.880]  States kills somebody that kills Americans they call it justice so maybe
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:29.360]  that the people that got killed want to extract some justice
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:35.640]  well precisely I mean a million dead Iraqis that's not an act of terror but
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:41.520]  you know planting a dud bomb in New York with this facade guy completely
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:45.720]  handled by the Patsy Alaloki who's visiting the Pentagon three weeks after
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:50.360]  9 11 that's the biggest threat that we face when we've got this US military
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:56.040]  industrial complex literally strafing off the globe I mean it's amazing George
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:00.800]  in Indiana you're on the air with Gerald Salante go ahead yes thank you very
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:05.840]  much Gerald I'm in central Indiana and I'd like to know what kind of advice you
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:12.680]  would give somebody that had mature timber here in Indiana what would be the
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:21.760]  your advice the short temper mature you know wood yeah yeah you know I know you
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:29.840]  know I'm trying to think in and I see you know the economy declining and I
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:37.000]  just don't see growth happening I would say that is it is it of a very high
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:44.200]  quality well one of the few states that that has hardwoods good hardwoods and I
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.800]  was just wondering if the dollar does completely collapse is the timber going
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:53.760]  to be worth anything or is it going to collapse along with the the dollar and
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.680]  the the growth and everything well you're in the business and what is how
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:04.360]  if timber prices done since the real estate bubble burst oh it's not good
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:08.200]  at all but you know if this is a trend if this is showing what's going to
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.320]  happen I mean in the 80s it was a wonderful you know you can harvest
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.760]  your timber and make a whole lot of money but if there's still money out there
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:19.200]  to be made but I'm just wondering is it better to hold on to the timber and
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:23.480]  wait wait through all this trouble or should you get your money now and put
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.680]  it into something that is tangible well I'm not allowed to give it financial
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:32.480]  advice but sitting in on I don't know a lot I have to think about this more but
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:40.160]  right off the top of my head I would say get rid of some of it okay that would
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:44.720]  be isn't isn't it like Gerald isn't it the case that these kind of things can
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.000]  be used in a in a barter system that would inevitably ensue if the dollar
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.200]  collapsed it's too tough you know it's these things don't go that smoothly and
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:59.680]  of course the other opportunity is it depending on the on the grade and the
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:04.080]  quality is export if that's the real opportunity because this is who the
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.920]  cheap dollar is really helping it's helping exporters so if you could
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:15.040]  export this stuff I would say that would be the best opportunity for me okay
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.480]  thanks for the call George Rafael in Virginia you're on the air go ahead
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:25.240]  hello hi thank you for receiving my call first-time caller something you had
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:29.080]  mentioned earlier that kind of has me a questioning you mentioned the United
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:34.280]  States as a financial superpower is it not the case that the United States more
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:39.360]  of a clearinghouse post-second world war because the other countries were trying
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:44.560]  to rebuild their infrastructure and also the United States had a jump on that
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:49.160]  based on the infrastructure the post-depression infrastructure buildup
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:52.960]  for the war oh absolutely you're a hundred percent right but the United
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.520]  States was also in a position to keep that going but we squandered our future
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:03.800]  and when I wrote my book trends trend tracking in 1988 from that point on the
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:10.360]  United States squandered over 13 trillion in in in unnecessary defense
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:14.760]  fighting the Cold War so yeah we were not the economic superpower I don't
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:20.360]  believe I've ever said that but we did have the opportunity to become that to
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.960]  maintain that for the very reasons that you said Europe and Japan were rebuilding
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:32.680]  but they again we squandered our future and in mind also with the United States
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:39.680]  selling itself after 1935 to the Federal Reserve no in essence given living off
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:46.320]  their IOUs could they actually build without the consent of the of the
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:50.600]  debtor stay there Gerald we had hit in a break now but we'll get your answer on

[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.200]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:16.520]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:21.600]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling them
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.920]  currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about 70% of
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:30.480]  US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our friends at the
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.280]  National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar will soon become

[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:43.520]  they're not gonna be able to stop it particularly in Europe as you pointed out
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:47.880]  what's going on in Greece now you know what they call austerity measures here's
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:51.840]  an austerity measure for you you know we're gonna lower the minimum
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.240]  wage you're gonna really rack the people down at the bottom we're gonna cut
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:59.440]  services and anything you get well we're gonna charge you more for oh with

[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:34.680]  when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose they lose it and
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:38.360]  people are starting to lose it so you're gonna start seeing governments
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:43.840]  topple more fascism fascism has already come to America I love it they're
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.480]  worried about al-qaeda hitting the trains what trains the wagon trains

[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:21.280]  hey thank you there goes Gerald Salente coming up in the next segment Steve
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:26.360]  Watson and then of course Aaron Dykes Alex Jones will be calling in again from
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:31.400]  the road one final point I wanted to hit on we had the debates yesterday in South
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:36.800]  Carolina with the presumptive Republican candidates six months ago in
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:43.240]  November 2010 I wrote an article saying that only Ron Paul can beat Barack
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:49.600]  Obama and now this has been proven by a new CNN poll released which was
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:54.720]  conducted over the weekend quote who does best against Obama Paul the
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:59.240]  congressman from Texas who also ran as a libertarian in 1988 and who is well
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.280]  liked by many in the Tea Party movement trails the president by only seven
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.080]  points in a hypothetical general election showdown Huckabee trails by eight
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:13.680]  points with Romney down 11 points to Obama so I mean Paul is the
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:18.280]  Republicans best chance of beating Obama but instead the media after the
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:22.380]  debates last night lavishes all this praise on these wolves in sheep's
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:27.440]  clothing these people who mimic Ron Paul's populist talking points but then
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:33.240]  try to pose as tough guys by you know advocating torture and war I mean
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:37.840]  let's have a test of faith you know let's ask people like Paul Enti and this
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:43.800]  Fed Insider that Fox News was in a worship fest with Herman Cain let's ask
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.040]  them if they're prepared to be waterboarded to you know see if it's
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.720]  torture or not everyone who's agreed to do that has come out of it and said
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:54.960]  that it's torture and it's wrong and so they're trying to push these rhino
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.240]  candidates these people advocate torture these people advocate Obama's
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:05.080]  disastrous cap and tax policy they're trying to push him in order to sideline
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:10.400]  Ron Paul by making out that torture is now the American way and only by you
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:14.920]  know advocating torture can you be a tough war leader in these difficult
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:20.200]  years so they're basically trying to tie the debates that occurred last night to
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:25.560]  this bin Laden fable and they're also doing it by making out that Obama is
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:31.720]  soft on torture you know none of the Bush administration people who directed
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:36.180]  the torture committed war crimes were prosecuted by Obama a few of the
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:41.680]  underlings were which is why you had this phony confrontation yesterday at
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:46.840]  ground zero with the wife of the 9-11 pilot where she basically chastised
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:51.360]  Obama you know for not stopping holder from prosecute prosecuting these few
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.280]  underlings for torture so basically they're trying to push a GOP neocon
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:00.600]  who's going to be able to defeat Ron Paul with the media giving him all this
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.960]  bluster about how he's a tough war leader and then they're trying they're
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:10.240]  going to try and use that neocon to defeat Obama but as I documented in the
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:16.320]  article I wrote six months ago all these people Gingrich Romney Palin Paul
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:21.680]  Enti the lot of them are universally abhorred by the American people they've
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.400]  been using they've been losing their approval ratings at the same pace as
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:32.460]  Obama himself and as this new poll proves only Ron Paul can be president
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:36.360]  Barack Obama and that's why the Ron Paul revolution is going to move forward at
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:40.760]  great momentum in the coming months we'll be back with Steve Watson Aaron
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:47.520]  Dykes and Alex Jones it's the Alex Jones show live at prismplanet.tv stay tuned

[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:12.560]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:16.600]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:20.480]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:24.480]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:28.880]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:33.200]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:36.920]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:48.040]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:20.360]  filling in for Alex who's coming up live once again on this broadcast within the
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:25.960]  next 10 to 15 minutes. In the third hour we've got Aaron Dykes coming up. He's
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:31.720]  been barricaded in his secret bunker again doing some more deep research so
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:37.040]  it's always interesting to get his take on current events. Right now I'm just
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:42.520]  going to hit some news starting with this article by Kurt Nimmo feds issue
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:49.400]  terror advisory to justify police state distract from Osama Fable. Now this is
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:57.160]  about obviously Osama bin Laden's fake raid once again but the fallout of this
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:01.840]  domestically. Nimmo writes the government is exploiting the Obama death
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:06.520]  fantasy as an excuse to expand the police state grid in the United States
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:11.600]  and acclimatize the populace to the presence of militarized cops and
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:18.440]  unconstitutional random searches in mass transit hubs and this is about how the
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:24.320]  government today has issued an advisory warning that there could be an imminent
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:29.360]  giant terror attack on all the rail networks and where they glean this
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:35.400]  intelligence from. Of course from Osama bin Laden's computer hard drive on his
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:41.240]  laptop in his student squat flat. I'm sorry his million dollar compound
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:48.200]  mansion in Pakistan. Obviously he kept on this laptop all his dastardly plot
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:54.720]  that he was planning presumably with coordinated shortcuts on his desktop
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:02.280]  sort of you know helpfully titled giant train plot or how to blow up planes with
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:08.800]  toothpaste and shampoo. This is what we've apparently gleaned from his from
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.920]  his laptop when we did the raid on him. Let's let's quote an NBC report about
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:19.040]  this today. An advisory has been sent to law enforcement officials asking them to
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:23.320]  be vigilant about train security based on information uncovered at Osama bin
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:29.880]  Laden's compound after his death reports NBC New York. According to NBC News US
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:34.960]  officials say they have not found reference to any specific plots instead
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:40.360]  they say they found what they call aspirational items. I don't know what
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:45.200]  they are but events al-Qaeda operatives were interested in trying to make
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:50.000]  happen so again nothing specific here. We have no information quote we have no
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.280]  information of any imminent terrorist threat to the US rail sector but wanted
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.800]  to make our partners aware of the alleged plotting department of Homeland
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:03.560]  Security spokesman Matt Chandler said in a statement. We want to stress that this
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:08.400]  alleged al-Qaeda plotting is based on initial reporting which is often
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:13.320]  misleading or inaccurate and subject to change so essentially they've got no
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:18.160]  specific details of any plot to blow up trains whatsoever no specific cities
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.240]  they found it on Osama bin Laden's laptop but you know to hell with it let's
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:27.800]  just announce it publicly it covers all the bases that we want to cover. Let's
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.840]  go back to the article. Material supposedly gleaned from Osama's house in
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.680]  Pakistan reveals an operation against trains at unspecific locations in the
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:42.680]  United States on the 10th anniversary of 9-11. The advisory claims al-Qaeda
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:48.360]  planned to tip a train by tampering with the rails so that the train would fall
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:53.520]  off the track at a valley or a bridge. According to the government additional
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:58.440]  material mentions a desire to target mass transit hubs an interest long
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:02.080]  familiar to law enforcement because trains were targeted in Spain the UK and
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:07.200]  India and it goes on and we've got a representative of New York Steve King
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:13.360]  who has repeated the sort of you know the the same thing over again that there
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:19.480]  was information that it's going to be on the anniversary of 9-11. So what's the
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:24.200]  been the response to this in New York it's been to have squads of armed
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:30.320]  militarized police roaming about train stations in the subways unconstitutional
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:38.600]  random searches in in the train stations more TSA viper teams checking old men
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:44.320]  and pregnant women to see if they've got tickets to get on the the trains and
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:50.040]  just basically more police state the pumping of the police state. We've got a
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:54.600]  couple of clips here that I like to play to illustrate this the first is from
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:00.560]  PIX 11 news where they find a bunch of people walking about the train station
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:05.320]  to say how great they think the cops in camo gear are and how great the
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:08.200]  machine guns are we've got that clip ready.
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:13.800]  Sparked fresh security fears here in New York the city is on high alert fearful of
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:19.160]  possible revenge or retaliatory attacks as precaution places like Grand Central
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:22.600]  Terminal behind me here tonight and other sensitive locations in our area
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:26.560]  including water taxis and ferries security there has been noticeably
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:29.600]  stepped up.
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:35.080]  Remember see something say something thank you and be safe. On the surface it
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:39.440]  looks like a typical New York City rush hour hustle bustle harried commuters but
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:43.000]  all it takes is a glance to notice the stepped-up security heightened after the
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.560]  killing of Osama bin Laden. I just noticed that there's a lot more police and
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:52.720]  the more army personnel around which is which is good sign. Taking no chances part
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:56.360]  of midtown was briefly evacuated cops checking out a suspicious package today
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:01.040]  in the subway near 34th Street and 8th Avenue sources tell PIX 11 news in
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:05.720]  unattended black suitcase with the picture of Osama bin Laden on it was
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:09.920]  discovered on a subway platform police resolve the situation without incident
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:13.520]  what have you noticed security wise? Oh well I've noticed the soldiers around I've
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:18.240]  seen police with the security dog you know the dogs. They're trained to protect
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:21.960]  people so I mean whether they're here because they feel like there's an actual
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:25.160]  threat or because they're just here if something were to happen they are here
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:28.040]  and that's what's important and they're trained to react. They're here and it does
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:32.200]  make me feel safer that they're around. Penn Station Times Square Bryant Park
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:36.680]  Grand Central Port Authority the financial district just some of the iconic
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:41.320]  locations and transport hubs getting extra security attention tonight even as
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:45.780]  officials warn right now there are no specific or credible threats against the
[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:51.960]  city. Law enforcement officials say their biggest concern is not a
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:56.560]  sophisticated coordinated attack like 9-11 rather they're being extra watchful
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:00.960]  of a lone wolf attack the kind like Faisal Shahzad tried to pull off the
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:05.240]  convicted terrorist who tried to blow up that car bomb in an SUV in Times Square
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:08.920]  last year reporting live tonight from Grand Central Terminal I'm Peter Thorn
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:14.880]  pixel of a news right now let's get over to Marvin Scott. So there you have it
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.680]  once again of course they're doing this to reinvigorate the domestic police
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:25.040]  state and they're pushing this sort of soft target lone wolf aspect precisely
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:31.400]  because they've got no credible threats at all and you watch that clip and you
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.760]  ask yourself why are the cops walking around in camouflage gear because
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:37.800]  they're not in the jungle they're not in the desert they're in they're in the
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:42.880]  railway station obviously it's to generate this kind of is to normalize
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:47.400]  this kind of vigorous show of force this police state and we've got another clip
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:52.680]  coming up now from CBS which is even you know it's even more worse propaganda
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:58.120]  where they explain sooner or later all these soft target locations such as
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:03.080]  train stations department stores will have security checkpoints that you'll
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:07.480]  have to walk through just to get into them and you know we all need to watch
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:12.480]  each other and keep each other safe have we got that clip lined up terrorism
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:17.480]  experts say a retaliation attack for Osama bin Laden's death is inevitable
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:22.320]  terrorists are expected to aim for more vulnerable soft targets like shopping
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:28.840]  malls even museums CBS 2's Hazel Sanchez reports they are places jam packed
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:33.360]  with people pedestrian malls shopping centers and stadiums yeah I feel safe but
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:37.720]  of course in the back of my head I know that things can happen counterterrorism
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:41.520]  expert Juval Aviv says terrorists seeking revenge for Osama bin Laden's
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:45.840]  death will turn to attacks less dramatic than the destruction on September 11th
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:50.760]  focusing instead on soft targets like hotels places of worship and mass
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:55.720]  transit hubs it's easier less complicated for them to carry out what
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:00.120]  they're gonna achieve if they're successful is to kill as many people as
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:04.600]  possible security consultant David Bohm says the future could include security
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:08.440]  checkpoints entering all soft targets like your local department store
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.480]  bone says even with the police presence the areas are vulnerable the reason
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:16.600]  they're called so often because it's so easily accessible to anyone there has to
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:21.640]  be security checks for the safety of all people added security is a turnoff for
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:25.640]  some New Yorkers there's a police presence and they search someone with a
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:30.880]  backpack somebody who looks not really suspicious but it's random so I would go
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:36.440]  if that is the case not if everyone is being searched it's better to be safe
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:40.680]  for the story despite the challenges to secure high-volume soft targets like
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:44.960]  here in Times Square security experts say one of the best lines of defense
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:51.520]  already exists and doesn't cost a thing we are millions and millions of eyes
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:56.080]  and ears we need to assist each other and keep each other safe freedom coming
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:01.560]  with an increasingly heavy price in Midtown Hazel Sanchez CBS to news soft
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:05.360]  target securities a long-standing practice in Israel where people and
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:11.800]  their possessions are carefully examined in many public venues oh yes so it's
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:16.960]  perfectly normal in Israel so what's the problem it's just complete propaganda
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:22.360]  I mean people have become tired of having their freedom stripped away this
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.800]  show of force and they've begun to stand up to that you know the TSA body
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:31.880]  scanners the endless homeland security alerts the telescreens in Walmart's
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:36.320]  telling you you've got a spy on your neighbors there's the see something say
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:41.640]  something at football games and sports stadiums which is a literal starsy
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:47.440]  program to get the people to police each other promoting that sort of subservient
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:52.080]  mindset that we've all got to be vigilant and all that is being revigorate
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:58.760]  being vigorated again after this sort of phony bin Laden escapade and and right
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:03.120]  now we've got on the line the one and only Alex Jones and I'd like to go to
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:08.840]  Alex and ask him Alex have you heard about this big plot to blow up trains
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:15.960]  and tip them off bridges today absolutely we knew that this was coming
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:20.560]  Obama comes out with a calculated statement that now we're all safe just
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:24.520]  like in a state of the Union he said don't worry you can ride on the new
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:28.200]  mass transit trains we're gonna put in and you won't have to go to the scanners
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:32.840]  or be groped and then people sort of laughing in the Congress because it's
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:37.320]  all a big joke I saw Governor Ridge and I know I say this every week or so because
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:43.320]  it's so important on C-span eight years ago in a two-hour meeting with CEOs
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:49.800]  saying there will be TSA trained local goons the local federal auxiliary at
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:55.200]  every building every grocery store every shopping mall hardened federal
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:00.480]  checkpoints on the highways random checkpoints and they're going to take
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:04.560]  blood they're going to take tissue swabs out of the cheek they're gonna stick
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:08.440]  their hands down your pants this is about all of America and the Western
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:12.600]  world being a prison this is about all of us being told to line up England as you
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:16.960]  know as the mobile body scanner fans they're now getting those here in the
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:21.600]  United States this is all socially engineered this was all being worked on
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:26.880]  by the big defense contractors pre-911 and as the Eisenhower warned us about
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:30.440]  the military industrial complex in any third world country it's normally the
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:34.200]  military the corrupt leaders of it the takeover the nation well here it's that
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:38.960]  whole defense complex owned by the big offshore banks and it's a very elementary
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:43.680]  they stage the terror attacks with their patsies it doesn't matter there's a huge
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:47.880]  history of bin Laden in Sudan arrested and Clinton wouldn't it didn't want him
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:53.160]  or then them trying to use bin Laden people to kill Gaddafi and that's BBC
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:46:01.440]  Associated Press from the what 2000 and what was it was 2002 I think yeah 2002
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:06.440]  and then people are like aha and then Al Qaeda is back attacking Libya again they
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:10.040]  attack the Serbs but I want to go through a list of things here because I want
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:14.840]  people to understand what we're facing going back to Governor Ridge Governor
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:18.760]  Ridge is so arrogant last year he put out a book bragging that they put out
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:24.160]  fake terror alert for political purposes Ari Fleischer to cover as hind in three
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:28.280]  years before that in a press briefing admitted that they were doing that for
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:33.000]  political purposes of this is all admitted just like Cass Sunstein admits they
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.920]  want to shut down free speech or internet kill switch this is in rights papers on
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.200]  it that's what's so frustrating about the ignorant people out there who want to
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:45.280]  remain being ignorant 99% of what we tell you ladies and gentlemen is on record
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:50.400]  by them it's not Alex Jones that says the CIA put out fake bin Laden videos
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:54.440]  they admit it that's what's so frustrating when you live this you're
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:59.600]  informed and you're not just somebody in the lazy general public or even in
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:03.440]  lazy government who can just hear this and like a child decide that they're
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:07.680]  gonna say it isn't real let me run through a laundry list here we know Al
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:11.400]  Qaeda was created and controlled by the criminal element that runs our government
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:15.240]  and other governments we know they use them as a pretext to launch wars we
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:18.920]  know they use them as a pretext to have domestic police state crackdowns and to
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:22.360]  make what government corporations do secret from us we the people while they
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:27.400]  rob us through government control that's setting up monopolies for them but
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:31.360]  clearly that we have said that as the economy implodes as they launch these
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:35.680]  new wars that they would then bring in states terror and this death of bin
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:40.880]  Laden is a psychological resurrection of him then they introduced the four new
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:45.120]  bin Laden's three of which on record trained in the US two of which on record
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:48.400]  absolutely worked for the federal government at the highest levels of
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:52.320]  black ops and they're so arrogant it's just admitted everywhere but still it's
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:56.640]  not kosher to point that out so they're rolling them out just like they did pre
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:02.560]  9-11 I'm seeing the exact same preconditioning so maximum maximum total
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:08.000]  red alert everyone and in fact I'm gonna ask Aaron Dyke to do this next hour we
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.560]  need to get the White House number the Congress number the switchboard launch
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:17.200]  operation exposed the government terrorist part two I haven't done this in
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:25.760]  ten years since July of 2001 maximum total alert ladies and gentlemen you
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:32.360]  must call them we need to get an article out today or tomorrow by one of the great
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:37.160]  researchers there pointing all of this out with the phone numbers and call them
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:40.800]  we need links in the articles to all these White House advisors like Robert
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:44.680]  Shapiro in the Financial Times of London saying a terror attack would sure help
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:49.400]  us it sure be great Obama's got to get an Oklahoma City or 9-11 so you can get
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:52.720]  his new world order we need all those Republican neocons that wrote the
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:57.200]  tutorials saying how great September 11th was see they're all communicating with
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:02.280]  each other like we're too stupid to see it begging for it calling for it and
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:06.520]  here's my main point I want everybody to hear me and I'm begging everyone to
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:10.560]  listen to me very very carefully and I'm gonna go right through till five after
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.960]  next hour then we'll bring Aaron Dyke's in and if Steve can hold over has the
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:18.320]  comments with Aaron he's welcome to but I want to point this out right now now
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:24.240]  people listen to me very very carefully all that stands between the new world
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:28.640]  order just taking all the pension funds launching World War three with Pakistan
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:32.320]  they've got no every analyst says it will it will probably trigger World War
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:37.040]  three not may this is also part of framing Pakistan it always says a
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:41.400]  geopolitical external foreign policy element than the domestic policy they
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:46.160]  like full spectrum win-win wins oh everyone listen to me very carefully
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:53.080]  right now please take this to heart all that stands between pre-humanity our
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:57.120]  children the innocent people the folks on fixed incomes people on social
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:01.360]  security people that have paid into public and private pensions the globalist
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:04.720]  have done this in every other country they've fully taken over the only thing
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:09.720]  that stands between us and and real hot tyranny I mean the arrest wagons going
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:14.280]  around the FEMA camps being filled mushroom clouds the only thing that
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:20.520]  stands between us and that is we the people look in the mirror if you look
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:24.720]  at the mainstream media hundreds of newspapers prestigious establishment
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:32.680]  magazines are lowering their guns on us from their pile of sess and and firing

[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:04.840]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:08.560]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:12.120]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:15.880]  silver or gold it's true seeds and all perform even gold and silver before in
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:19.760]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:24.200]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:29.240]  call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:32.960]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:36.760]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to

[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:18.200]  with more drone attacks today we're talking the beefing of the domestic
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:23.720]  police state and the way I see it is the danger now is that bin Laden's
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:27.920]  officially gone so they're gonna attempt to elevate another patsy into the
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:32.840]  public mindset by you know staging another attack and blaming it on maybe
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:38.280]  you know alawaki the guy who dined at the Pentagon after 9-11 or you know
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:44.480]  g'dan the Mossad agent and hardcore Islamist let's let's go back to Alex
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.240]  Jones and Alex what what's your take on that what do you think about that well I
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:52.080]  want to be a hundred percent clear with people the globalists have clearly made
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:57.720]  the decision to roll out this new fear campaign introduce new boogeymen to the
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:04.360]  public and try to re-invoke is as president Obama said Sunday night the
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:08.680]  feeling we had it for 9-11 what was that feeling nuke everybody take all my
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:14.000]  rights away stick your hands down my pants it was a people ready to be robbed
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.480]  it's very simple these outside globalist interest come in take over the
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:22.720]  government wrap themselves in the American flag and the good old boys
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.560]  riding around with their US Army veteran sticker on their car are good
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:30.600]  people they just can't bring themselves to admit just how criminal these
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:35.600]  elements are and that they're using outside elements as a pretext to get
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:40.640]  them to basically rebrand American values that that's not land of the free
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:44.800]  home of the brave it's land of TSA checkpoints in the mall groping your
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:49.800]  small children and so they've been quietly rolling all of this out training
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:56.080]  everyone to become accustomed to having federally authorized goons come up ask
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:01.200]  you questions take you away question you for the next step that will be mass
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:05.200]  arrest of US citizens and at that point that they also know that a small
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:09.040]  percentage will fight back they will then be called terrorist and they will
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:13.000]  then be called American wide al-qaeda you don't hand over your ranch your wide
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.200]  al-qaeda you don't let the CPS take your kids your wide al-qaeda you don't let
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:20.200]  them take your pension fund your wide al-qaeda we have all the internal
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.360]  government documents we've published them it's never been about al-qaeda it's
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:27.880]  never been about and we're all a locky and bin Laden and I just want people out
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:31.760]  there to understand this is the crossroads globally they're trying to
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:35.600]  launch an attack on Pakistan and frame them we predicted this months ago
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:40.200]  domestically it's it's about expanding the police state right as everything
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:44.960]  collapses they don't want to take the blame for what they have done
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:49.360]  consolidating power they want to destroy us economically with their Ponzi scheme
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:53.560]  you notice us one day was saying no one could have guessed that the money was
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:57.120]  all going to offshore banks well a year and a half ago I put out fall the
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:00.840]  Republic you can play the ad for fall the Republic out a year and a half ago
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:05.800]  that's almost a year and a half before it was released I said in the film the
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.560]  offshore criminal cartel that took all the money from the bailout that's
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:13.360]  because I've studied these people it's actually wasn't secret that the main
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.120]  owners of the Federal Reserve of the Bank of England the German Buddhist Bank so
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:21.880]  of course it went offshore that's who owns America through the 1913 takeover
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:25.800]  and now they want to own you and your family so they want to bankrupt you so
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:29.080]  you go into receivership so right when they set up their world government
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:33.240]  publicly right when they start really raping you and raising gas prices and
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:37.360]  devaluing the dollar right when the euro plunges right as they have designed
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:40.960]  all this it's just stepping stones towards the new global SDR bandcore
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:47.280]  currency right as they do that out comes the boogeyman to menace everyone into
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:51.560]  rallying around the flag which the globalist have captured very simple and
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:56.640]  bowing down to them so they can gang rape us because we are saying protect us
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:01.480]  from the scary man in the cave who has Superman like powers and so here comes
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:05.920]  the stage terror attack and remember you are the resistance listeners we are the
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:10.120]  only main voice now fighting them thank god we built up to the point of having

[01:59:53.520 --> 02:00:01.000]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:13.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:21.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:28.560]  Jones it's Friday the 6th of May this is the Alex Jones show I'm Steve Watson
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:33.920]  webmaster at Infowars.net I'm here with Alex on the line and we're just
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:39.280]  discussing the revamp of the domestic police state and the possible dangers
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:43.440]  that that possesses and from my perspective all this comes at a very
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:49.080]  opportune time for big sis and Homeland Security because just a couple of weeks
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:53.960]  ago they announced a complete revamp of their terror alert warning system
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:01:00.000]  whereby they would get rid of the Sesame Street color-coded system under
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:05.840]  Bush and start you know sending you direct alerts on your iPhone and Twitter
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:11.240]  and Facebook and basically that alerts are gonna become unavoidable Alex can
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:15.760]  you speak to that? Oh absolutely I mean the whole thing was rolled out that's
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:21.480]  we told people Sunday that the photo of the situation room was fake and Pachennic
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:25.640]  told him that on Tuesday and it's been all admitted now completely fake no
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:31.960]  video feed the whole story's a lie they add things that change to make you think
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:36.320]  the general overall lie has some truth to it well we did kill the lot but yeah
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:42.520]  he didn't fight back and yeah he didn't throw his wife in front of the you know
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:49.160]  people on and on and on the bottom line is there a pack of lying criminals they've
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:55.760]  lied over and over and over again and we need to remember that the mainstream
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:01.920]  media keeps saying Alex is everything a conspiracy is everything a government
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:07.800]  lying well certainly with the 9-11 fable of course if 9-11's a lie the new
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:14.400]  bin Laden killing is a lie because the entire thing is a fraud and it was
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:19.520]  admitted mainstream news in the late 90s that he had total renal failure and
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:23.600]  another disease on top of it and couldn't live more than five to six years
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:29.240]  I mean this is this is absolute total fiction and when Steve Pachennic met
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:33.680]  bin Laden back in the mid-80s he was very very sick and of course but Pachennic
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:39.760]  coming up in 30 minutes with Aaron Dykes has broken all that down and is also a
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:43.480]  medical doctor with two medical degrees but this is all on record but I want
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:47.400]  listeners to understand something you can see it all the scripting the new
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:52.280]  terror alerts the TSA with the telescreens going in all of this is
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:55.760]  being done with big jumbo screens in public places saying spy on your
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:59.840]  neighbors because they're bringing this country into a total depression with
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:05.520]  inflation because of dollar devaluation in the oil in the food and there is
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.320]  going to be restlessness and so bin Laden and al-qaeda is just a cover for the
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:14.960]  rollout of the high-tech spying police state grid there's been a full court
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:20.080]  press in the last year that's why I said it's coming with every major
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:25.680]  professional I know prominent doctors lawyers my father and then other dentists
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:29.240]  that he works with being approached at their office and at home saying please
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:33.720]  spy on everybody for us and this is nothing to do with al-qaeda they are
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:39.040]  finding out who will work with them in a total takeover and they're setting up
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:43.440]  the internet kill switch the internet ID system it's all coming down they're
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:47.080]  announcing yes the cell phones are watching you yes we're going to torture
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:49.960]  people notice how they're saying torture is great here's my final point we have
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:54.520]  an article about this to point this out to everybody if torture so great why
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:58.600]  did they kill bin Laden now we learn the order was killing because they don't want
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:01.360]  the secrets even if you believe they really killed him they didn't want his
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:05.880]  history with the CIA and all the secrets he's got coming out they wanted him
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:09.600]  dead even if you believe the official fable if torture so great he was a
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:13.840]  treasure trove of all intelligence they should be waterboarding him right now
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:18.080]  folks and none of it makes sense because it's only designed for the lowest
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:22.160]  common denominator of citizens who barely pay attention or maybe just read
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:28.200]  the headlines the people that ran the hoax saying they killed bin Laden are the
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:32.760]  same people that stage 9-11 they are the same military industrial complex and
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:36.360]  these childlike people say well why would Bush let Obama bring this out later
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:40.440]  not himself because they all work on the same team at that level and they wanted
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:44.080]  to use bin Laden then saying he was still alive to be the boogeyman Steve
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:47.640]  Watson incredible job dr. Steve Pachennick coming up next with Aaron

[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:23.360]  predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you see he
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:27.240]  predicted the collapse of GM Pannie Mae Freddie Mac and America's biggest small

[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:46.120]  to Alex's latest YouTube video terrorism terrorism's biggest dirty secret all
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:50.400]  about the statistics of how undangerous all these supposed terrorists are let's
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:55.600]  cue it as soon as possible I'm here today to talk to you about terrorism's
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:04.880]  big dirty secret and no it's not that government stage events or finance
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:10.040]  criminal groups to carry out events so that those governments can crack down
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:16.280]  on their populations everybody knows about false flag from Gulf of Tonkin to
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:21.720]  Adolf Hitler and the Reichstag or Gliwitz to start the war with Poland in 1939 for
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:28.200]  the sake of debate let's just say 9-11 is exactly like they told us let's say
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:32.760]  Gulf of Tonkin was real doesn't matter if it's admittedly staged let's just say
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:39.320]  it was real let's say the Reichstag was real let's say it's all real it's all
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:47.800]  real bin Laden's assassination is real on May Day May 1st it's all real everything's
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:52.440]  true government never lies government can be trusted and loved and cared about
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:56.480]  in the big major corporations that are not free market but use government to
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:00.280]  shut down their competition they can all be trusted everything is happiness
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:06.320]  everything is love everything is reality when government tells you so
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:11.200]  anyone who questions a government statement or a major corporate statement
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:16.120]  is a conspiracy theorist they're a truth or they're a birther they're a they're a
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:22.760]  death or there's a label pre-made for them being skeptical is a criminal act
[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:26.440]  it's outrageous these people are nuts they should buy whatever they're told
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:34.240]  it's horrible to question buy everything be gullible I agree with that so let's
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:43.840]  then talk here about numbers about facts and look at terrorism and it's big dirty
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:49.680]  secret and I hope you'll look this up for yourself but all of it is public
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:53.320]  information most of you already know this when you hear it the big dirty
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:58.000]  secret is even if you buy the official story about terrorism and everything
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:03.480]  else we're told in that now they want to have TSA at all the malls and grocery
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:06.640]  stores sticking their hands down our pants because after all they'll put up
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:09.280]  with their hands on our pants we'll certainly give them our labor and our
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:13.920]  tax money but they're good folks keeping it safe from terrorist I forgot well the
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:17.680]  borders wide open again I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist and even have
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:22.640]  critical thinking and question anything they're saying the point I'm trying to
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:27.520]  get at here is the big dirty secret are you ready for the big dirty secret about
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:32.840]  terrorism no it's not that it's false flag they never stage anything that
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:40.040]  they're good folks no it's something that everybody knows and it's this they
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:47.000]  hype the living daylights out of it let's say it's real on average less than
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:53.600]  20 Americans die a year from terrorism but the media hypes it up with all this
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:59.640]  fear and look at them in this hatred and this tribalism the outsider and it's
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:04.360]  uses a distraction from the imploding economy the illegal wars all the things
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:10.120]  that are happening no one can deny that I looked it up on average over a hundred
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:14.360]  people die a year of honeybee stings from allergic reaction hundreds and
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:19.040]  hundreds die of peanut allergy hundreds more of wasp stings hundreds and
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:22.880]  hundreds close to a thousand every year from snake bites water moccasins
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:28.240]  rattlesnakes coral snakes do you see big terror announcements the fear a
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:33.040]  rattlesnake with a bin Laden beard and a turbine we've got to invade all these
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:38.280]  countries and go after all these nations because these snakes are killing
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:42.480]  close to a thousand people a year you have a better chance being struck by
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:49.360]  lightning the dying of a bee sting you have hundreds and hundreds of times a
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:55.880]  better chance of dying in a car wreck over 200,000 a year tens of thousands
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:13:02.160]  dying from hitting their head in the shower on the pool but do they hype it
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:06.440]  all up government cares so much about you here's the big secret the big hoax
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:12.040]  government tells you man the government's job is keeping you safe and we
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:17.520]  care so much that we're spying on all of you and watching you we get the homeland
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:21.440]  security documents and almost all the spies are focused on gun owners
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:26.240]  conservatives libertarians landowners independent people that don't want to be
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:31.840]  part of the collective aside board and so the big dirty secret is it's all the
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:36.760]  big hoax if they're actually worried about deaths they'd be concerned about
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:45.000]  the over 200,000 deaths a year from faulty prescription drugs the 300 plus
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:50.800]  thousand deaths from mistakes at the hospital the list goes on and on no they
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:58.760]  don't give a rats behind about you and your family they use really junior high
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:04.520]  or even childish boogeyman parables about scary men and turbines who want to
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:10.080]  kill you if you don't give your rights up and accept all these new wars it's so
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:15.120]  elementary since when did land of the free home of the brave become a shaking
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:24.320]  cowering rent-and-stimpy chihuahua afraid of the boogeyman since when did we say
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:29.920]  take all my rights keep me safe since when and statistically in the World
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:35.840]  Almanac terrorism deaths for US citizens is way down at the bottom more people
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:40.480]  die when they plug in their coffee maker and the tiles wet and they get
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:45.160]  electrocuted more people die when a bumblebee stings them but we've got to
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:49.680]  change our whole way of life and endless hype and all the hysteria for
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:58.680]  something that is a vapor an apparition a delusion they are creating irrational
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:04.760]  fears and that's the big hoax that's the big dirty line to have us fleeing over
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:08.760]  the edge of a cliff running from an enemy that doesn't exist you know the
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:14.640]  British hunt pheasant by having their servants beat the bushes bang on pots and
[02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:18.920]  pans and a wedge and drive the pheasants out of the woods towards their
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:23.240]  palatial lords hunting them with 12-gauge shotguns and that's what been
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:27.320]  lauding all the rest of it is the threat isn't been lauding the threat isn't
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:32.400]  Amaral a locky when he's not hanging out of the CIA the threat is the beaters
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:37.640]  beating the bushes that's the terrorists so in a way they are the threat they
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:43.640]  drive you out towards the real threat the royals lined up with their shotguns
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:50.440]  shooting the pheasants that have been driven in fear out to be shot the wicked
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:56.240]  fleeth when none pursueth that's always one of my favorite Bible quotes and I
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:16:02.880]  didn't steal that from true grit it's been one of my favorite quotes for years
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:07.640]  I'm glad they used it so you've been given the big dirty secret and it's right
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:12.160]  there for you to go find out for yourself you've got hundreds of times
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:15.200]  better chance dying in car wrecks we still drive cars every day we still
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:18.760]  accept the risk hundreds of times a better chance dying a bad drug
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:23.080]  interactions you still take the prescription drugs many many times a
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:28.360]  better chance of dying from a bumblebee or a wasp or a honeybee so why do you
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:33.760]  have this irrational fear because deep inside your anthropology your sociology
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:39.280]  you have an archetypal fear of the other tribe coming to enslave you coming to
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:45.240]  kill you and in that is a great truth in our human development on this planet
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:51.440]  hurling through space around the standard son the greatest threat we ever
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:57.640]  faced was the neighboring tribe deciding to come and kill all the men and take
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:02.200]  the women and children for themselves every culture's done it and so when you
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:07.240]  see a guy wearing a dress and a turban and a beard it's scary and when they
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:10.720]  tell you the tribal enemy is coming to get you you line up and you do what
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:15.760]  you're told and the sociologists and anthropologists know that if they show
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:20.200]  you a man in a dress bin Laden you will crap your pants and give over your
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:24.960]  entire life to them they're punching primitive buttons built into you for
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:30.920]  survival fifty thousand years ago we're facing a new enemy and there comes the
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:34.800]  next instinct and the ultra secret they don't want you to know and what they're
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:41.560]  afraid of humanity are the ultimate survivors the super dominant species of
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:51.120]  this planet the omnivore super predator it is because we adapt that we are all
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:59.240]  powerful on this planet and will project our species into the galaxy because we
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:05.760]  develop quickly we adapt quickly and we may be manipulated through some 50,000
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:11.400]  year-old template okay folks the rest of the video is on info wars calm and on
[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:17.080]  the Alex Jones channel on YouTube and Alex makes a great point ordinary life
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:20.920]  is very dangerous there's bee stings there's lightning there's accidental
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:26.320]  drownings electrocution all of it more common than terrorism the point of
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:32.600]  terrorism is not the acute danger but it's the fear factor the actual false
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:37.600]  flag attacks perpetrated by al Qaeda by bin Laden are just the inciting
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:41.480]  incidents for the drama they want to unfold because they want to institute
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:45.680]  the police state the security checks they want to expand the wars overseas and
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:52.360]  Alex is totally right it's that is just the distracting panic mode incident to
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:57.080]  get you to focus on their agenda to move you out of the bushes metaphorically
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:02.840]  into the open where you're easy prey and we've never been in greater danger at
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:07.560]  least it appears that way with this new bin Laden myth coming up after the break
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:11.200]  we have the White House phone numbers I'll go ahead and give them out now the

[02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:11.640]  compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will
[02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:15.600]  soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming
[02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:20.120]  homeless all caused by the devalued US dollar all the mainstream media continues
[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:23.880]  to ignore inflation our friends the National Inflation Association provide

[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:12.360]  another red alert those of us who have known 9-11 was a false flag event those
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:18.520]  of us who have known the bin Laden shadow puppet enemy is a hoax have been
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:24.240]  beating the drums for almost a decade but it's time to stand up again and tell
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:28.200]  them to stop do not stage new terror we're trying to stop the military
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:33.640]  industrial complex the globalists who want to hijack these scare tactics to
[02:25:33.640 --> 02:25:38.640]  expand wars to maintain the military budget even while we have you know
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:44.040]  unprecedented rhetoric about dropping the budget in Washington well we need to
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:47.840]  let them know we know what's going on we know the bin Laden death as a hoax
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:53.560]  we have expert Steve Pachennick coming up in the next segment but we need to
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:57.400]  call the White House we need to call Homeland Security contact them at their
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:01.960]  online reports let them know the White House number again is the comment line
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:15.920]  202-456-1111 202-456-1111 the switchboard number is 202-456-1414202
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:22.520]  456-1414 let them know we know who the real terrorists are and we don't want
[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:26.920]  to see another state's attack night like 9-11 we don't want even greater
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:31.520]  security we've already pushed back against the TSA invasions of practices
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:36.040]  we don't want security at our shopping malls and grocery stores ordinary life
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:43.520]  is dangerous enough as you saw in Alex Jones's video just briefly before we
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:47.560]  continue with the bin Laden events and all this staged terror I just wanted to
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:54.800]  touch on the GOP debates last night hosted by Fox News it was the so-called
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:27:01.480]  weak field we saw already in 2008 trying to obscure Ron Paul's run trying not to
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:06.080]  let a libertarian minded constitutionalist rise to the top of the fray
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:11.280]  so it's no event it's no surprise to see them manipulating events all over again
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:17.320]  we had the AP and Reuters staging some kind of protest of the GOP debate
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:21.600]  because they weren't given full access thus they reported less on this debate
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:27.000]  and moreover we saw this false positioning of an alternate dark horse
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:32.160]  candidate this Herman Cain fellow who used to work for the Federal Reserve
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:38.000]  people he's being positioned as the Tea Party you know populist movement rather
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:42.200]  than Ron Paul who they gave almost no focus on didn't talk to after the
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:47.280]  debates didn't talk about after the debates and I want to play one very
[02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:54.680]  brief 30 45 second clip of Frank Luntz he does these Fox News excuse me these
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:59.240]  Fox News focus groups and it's completely staged he handpicks these
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:04.760]  these Republican responders ordinary people so-called leads them down the
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:09.720]  path and you'll see he accidentally chooses alphabetically to talk about
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:17.800]  only Herman Cain I roll the clip please and so who won tonight's the debate for
[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:21.120]  that answer we now check in with our very own Frank Luntz he's standing by with
[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:26.280]  so a group of South Carolina GOP primary voters Frank
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:30.960]  Sean we got 29 of the most important people in America sitting right behind
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:34.720]  me right now let's go right to them who won the debate let's go now for better
[02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:39.360]  co-order how many of you think Herman Cain won the debate well we can stop
[02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:44.680]  right there John I want a word or phrase to describe Herman Cain answers
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:49.640]  the question most direct a breath of fresh air common sense talking points
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:54.520]  alright that's enough you've got 29 very closely handled supposed focus groups
[02:28:54.520 --> 02:29:01.840]  this Frank Luntz is a complete joke it's a way of staging false reaction to
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:07.000]  this GOP field before the so-called front-runner candidates even get to
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.120]  appear they didn't even mention Ron Paul I was up all night working on this video
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:16.160]  of Alex and the terrorism thing while monitoring Fox News's post-debate coverage
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:19.840]  they talked about all kinds of other stuff other candidates people who weren't
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:25.240]  even at the debate Ron Paul and much less the New Mexico governor we're not
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:29.760]  even mentioned it's just a joke but we have even more important fish to fry
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:33.960]  it's just interesting to watch as the politics begins to unfold for 2012
[02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:38.920]  Ben Laden and Dr. Steve Pachinic coming up after the break and call the White
[02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:50.800]  House we'll give out that number one more time
[02:29:50.800 --> 02:30:00.040]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:04.360]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:08.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:12.880]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:16.920]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:20.800]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:24.880]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:29.240]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:33.560]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:37.280]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:41.040]  wars we don't want to be provoked by this security complex police state it's
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:44.840]  very important that you tell your friends your neighbors perfect strangers
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:48.960]  and call the White House let them know we see through these tactics we know who
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:54.760]  the real terrorists are though one more time the White House's comment line is
[02:33:54.760 --> 02:34:06.160]  202-456-1111 202-456-1111 to and the switchboard 202-456-1414 you can
[02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:11.440]  also find that at White House gov and there's also ways to report incidents
[02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:17.800]  of suspected terror activity and other related stuff at Homeland Security but
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:24.080]  right now we go to Dr. Steve Pacenek he's an absolute counterterrorism and
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:29.600]  security expert he worked under I believe four presidents including directly
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:35.040]  under Henry Kissinger, Cybers Vance, George Shultz and James Baker all at
[02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:41.200]  varying roles as Secretary of State and or National Security Advisor under the
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:46.440]  corresponding presidents he has numerous PhDs a background in as a
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:52.400]  psychiatrist and is the first psychiatrist to receive a PhD focusing on
[02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:57.160]  international relations you can more or less guess what that means something
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:03.360]  along the lines of Black Ops but I'll let Steve Pacenek explain himself Dr.
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:08.120]  are you there? Yes I am thank you very much for that introduction but quite
[02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:12.120]  frankly really it's not just Black Ops what I was really trained to do and it
[02:35:12.120 --> 02:35:17.080]  was a formal of training between Harvard and MIT was really to understand
[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:22.080]  strategy tactics how to develop treaties how to do conflict resolution without
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:26.120]  using our military and how to use our military in a way that they didn't have
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:31.200]  to go to war and so I was involved in Camp David the peace chief treaties
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:37.720]  between Israel and Egypt and then the conflicts in the Palestinian areas and
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:41.760]  then it was brought back in to do the peace treaties the Khmer Rouge and
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:46.600]  Cambodia and disarming them without arms but I do work with our military and I
[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:51.160]  have great respect for them but I have been various roles I think everything you
[02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:56.000]  said was correct I think the audience should be aware of anything that
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:01.480]  resembles a suppression of liberty or an increased security in the name of
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:08.160]  Homeland Security or a stand-down or a false flag operation but from my point
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:12.880]  of view at this point in time I think that your public and the public in
[02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:17.240]  general but I think the Alex Jones shows and many other shows had really
[02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:22.040]  encouraged the American public to stand up and say listen we're not stupid and
[02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:27.960]  you know 9-11 occurred and that happened but that's not going to happen again
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:33.880]  and this whole story and nonsensical story of Osama bin Laden who's already been
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:39.800]  dead for 10 years from Marfan syndrome can't be used as a pretext for further
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:46.040]  increased security against the American public and a reason to send our brave
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:50.080]  men and women into wars that are really not of any great advantage for our
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:55.760]  national security but in effect let China come into Pakistan and use their
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:37:00.600]  resources and China come into Afghanistan to use their resources so the
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:06.880]  issue now becomes does Obama understand that he has made a very big mistake along
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:11.960]  with his White House cronies in sick defense and that if they pursue this
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:16.000]  nonsensical story which even the New York Times is pointing out on the front
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:20.840]  page Elizabeth Buehler is pointing out the inconsistency is now in the New
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:25.680]  York Times points that I do know very well there's a serious problem that the
[02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:30.360]  story just doesn't work in war that doesn't diminish the role of our
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:34.600]  military that doesn't diminish the role of a brave intelligence operatives who
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:38.880]  are up there for many other reasons than terrorism we do have other problems
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:43.960]  which have to do with drug cartels gang wars and other issues I don't want to
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:51.200]  get into but at this particular point in time there is a very clear voice in the
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:56.680]  loud unspoken but very clearly heard voice from the American public to Obama
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:38:05.480]  and his coteries cease and desist this nonsensical Syops operation and I am
[02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:10.920]  I'm just one single individual an American citizen no better no worse
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:15.800]  somebody who served eight to nine times in our government and is willing to die
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:21.480]  once again to say we can't continue this cronyism the capital cronyism the
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:26.920]  klepto cronyism and the psychological operations that they've been pulling not
[02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:32.360]  against not only in the world against Muslims innocent Muslims but also against
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:37.320]  the United States of America that consists of all types of people so that
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:42.960]  can continue and Obama is unnoticed and he's unnoticed very clearly and if he
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:48.000]  continues to pursue this nonsensical Syops with stories that make no sense
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.560]  whatsoever the inherent contradictions will blow up in his face as they're
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:56.720]  doing now and eventually he'll have to confront the American public and with
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:01.520]  another one of his lame speeches but we'll see what happened what does it mean
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:05.720]  that they've resurrected this specter of bin Laden at this political not only at
[02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:09.920]  a politically expedient point in time but at a time where they're looking to
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:14.160]  more or less rebrand our war on terror they've already told us they wanted to
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:20.240]  go on 40 50 100 years but we're in this new front with Libya Al-Qaeda is a sort
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:26.720]  of ally again as it was in the Yugoslav war years why have they resurrected
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:31.640]  bin Laden at this time and and why is that an indication that we're on watch
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:37.280]  for greater terror alerts well and there's one word for that and that word
[02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:41.440]  is desperation when you really don't know what to do when you don't know how
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:47.240]  to bring the increased number of unemployed people back into the labor
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:51.360]  force and you really don't know how to control the Congress and you really
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:55.640]  don't know how to control the budget and you don't know how to deal with the
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:59.800]  fiscal irresponsibility the biggest national security problem is not
[02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:06.680]  Al-Qaeda or anybody else it's our debt in our financial crisis what it means is
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:10.360]  that when you're desperate and you can't deal with internal problems you
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:15.520]  always look to external issues and this is a classical psychological operation
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:21.760]  which Hitler did when he had used prisoners of war to basically invade
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:27.040]  Poland when any country has an internal problem they externalize their problem
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:34.120]  in this case Obama fell into the old trite and almost pathetic psychological
[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:40.360]  operation where we say we have our summer bin Laden and I Obama had ordered
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:46.920]  Panetta to shoot Obama well Osama there's a Freudian slip again but basically
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:52.480]  when you well Osama Obama Obama been lying I mean it's all becoming so
[02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:56.160]  ridiculous and so much like a Walt Disney I have to explain what's happening in
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:41:00.880]  Disneyland and it's getting very tiresome to explain that the ridiculousness
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:04.960]  of the psyops operation is really ridiculous from a psyops point of
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:09.600]  view which I thought for over 30 years and was involved in this is so poorly
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:13.680]  constructed that even within the psychological operation it doesn't make
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:18.360]  sense you're resurrecting a man who everyone in the community knows was dead
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:24.360]  10 years ago the men in the CIA who were involved though very well that he was
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:28.760]  had died of Marfan syndrome the Bush on the Clinton actually and the Bush
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:33.240]  administration used it that didn't work and so they created a narrative which
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:38.880]  which junior perpetrated and it didn't work then and now Obama's resurrecting
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:45.000]  it out of desperation because he wants to one look very assertive to more than
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:49.560]  anything else this man who has really done very little in his life and also in
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:53.800]  the presidency wants to resurrect the notion that he's a very assertive
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:59.400]  leader and that having been asserted and having reaffirmed that he's an American
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:05.200]  citizen through a birth certificate quote end quote he now can show you that
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:09.080]  not only is the American but he's really a John Wayne American because he can go
[02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:14.680]  out and kill the man who's already dead exactly exactly and you mentioned
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:19.800]  Panetta go in and kill a dead man so are you mentioned once they get
[02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:24.880]  reelected in 2012 and really preemptive for a Republican Party since the
[02:42:24.880 --> 02:42:29.040]  Republican Party is very weak and the Tea Party has been marginalized and
[02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:34.120]  there's almost no one in the system that will you mention Panetta how
[02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:38.640]  important is it that he's moving to Secretary of Defense at this time how
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:43.120]  important is it that he looks tough on terror so that they can maintain some
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:48.200]  support for all these wars well actually he's been a very dysfunctional
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:53.000]  individual I don't know the gentleman I know his history he's really a what you
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:56.060]  know comes out of a school of what we call the pandering school of
[02:42:56.060 --> 02:43:00.880]  politicians he's just a low-level politician who worked for Clinton he is
[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:05.240]  very good in one area and that's budget allocation he knows nothing about the
[02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:10.280]  military when he took over the CIA it was a disaster under him as you remember
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:14.480]  there was an a whole episode where seven operatives were killed because they
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:18.880]  couldn't vet out one of the informants who was a doctor by the way and then he's
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:24.000]  been killing civilians repeatedly with the drone attack so it has changed from
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:30.240]  a CIA has changed from an analytical and intelligent than a human operation into
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:36.160]  basically reallocating special forces in mercenary so most of the CIA right now
[02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:41.120]  is really a mercenary unit with special forces reallocated begin so there's
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:45.680]  really no more or very little of what we used to have in a very effective CIA
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:50.800]  under Bush senior and other precedents I think is coming to secretary defense is
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:54.800]  a very serious mistake I don't think he's qualified I don't think he really
[02:43:54.800 --> 02:43:58.280]  knows anything about the military he knows really nothing about national
[02:43:58.280 --> 02:44:03.320]  security his poor performance as a CIA director just reaffirms the fact the
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:08.600]  president really doesn't care about performance needed at bush jr. and he
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:13.440]  just wants really loyalty and sick offense around him who he thinks he
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:19.080]  can control his only asset which is a strong asset his budget allocation but
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:23.360]  given the fact that he was a politician still is a politician is not an
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:28.000]  intelligence operative really doesn't understand intelligence I think this is
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:32.560]  not a very good sign the best secretary of defense we have had up to date
[02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:36.880]  besides George Marshall has been gates there's no accident that Gates was
[02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:42.320]  brought in many of us who work for Bush senior were great advocates for Gates
[02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:47.160]  instead of having Donald run so also an incompetent secretary of defense and a
[02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:54.160]  very dangerous one at that in this case Tana is not as malevolent or Machiavellian
[02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:59.320]  as runs fell was I'm Bush jr. senior really didn't like and none of us in the
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:03.040]  White House who worked for Bush senior in the State Department ever liked or
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:08.480]  respected Tana is really much more incompetent gates unfortunately it's
[02:45:08.480 --> 02:45:12.800]  been one of the best sectors of the sense he has he knows exactly what our
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:16.640]  strategies need to be needs that he knows exactly what the allocation of
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:21.080]  resources are required but unfortunately he's tired you know I think he's tired
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:25.520]  of a lot of the nonsense that's going on in this administration and he wants to
[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:29.320]  go back to private life I don't know the gentleman I know all him we've been in
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:33.440]  many administrations together but I have a great respect for him I have a great
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:37.120]  respect for his generals who work underneath him portray us and others
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:42.800]  and I think we will have a strong military I do not believe that our
[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:47.440]  military not the national security guards but our military will ever suit
[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:51.320]  American citizens let me repeat that again and let me tell that to our
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:56.000]  intelligence operatives who are listening to the show again let me explain it to
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:01.160]  you gentlemen and ladies do not in any way think that our military will ever
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:07.080]  ever shoot American citizens those who serve our country and not dedicated to
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:13.160]  our country will not do what happened in 1970 in Ohio it can't stay then kill
[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:19.280]  several students if that happens Obama has much more than a serious problem he
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:24.280]  has a revolution so I am not convinced that it's going to happen whether we
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:29.120]  have incompetent people in the so-called paramilitary and the more local
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:33.520]  law enforcement to the TSA and the so-called homeland security and an
[02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:37.360]  accident occurs there that's more likely but from the point of view of
[02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:42.320]  professional military the ones that I know that are not self-aggrandizing and
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:47.120]  not promoting themselves in the newspapers and you don't know about them
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:51.680]  nor should you these are very professional dedicated patriots to our
[02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:56.280]  country plus we have many veterans in this country including myself and
[02:46:56.280 --> 02:47:00.680]  millions of others who serve the country that will not allow a standout
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:05.520]  false flag operation to occur again and furthermore we really have to look at
[02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:09.480]  the problem of what happens to these men and women who go to the countries who
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:13.720]  are sent by civilians who've never served in the military including Clinton
[02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:20.000]  Bush Jr. and Obama and basically what happens is when they come back they
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:23.960]  don't have a house because the banks foreclosed on them they don't get health
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:28.280]  benefits because the VA doesn't have enough money to provide them with mental
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:33.120]  health and they don't have the the reimbursements that are required for
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:37.640]  them so we not only send these men and women to death for causes that are
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:42.080]  never clear and are never very relevant to our national security but when they
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:47.600]  come back we discard them as cannon fodder and that is inexcusable so what
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:52.120]  happens in effect is that we are building up a critical mass including
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:55.760]  myself and millions of other veterans who serve this country for many years
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:02.760]  who are disgruntled disappointed angry and that will be funneled into an
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:08.120]  articulation that could be quite quite serious to this presidency if he does
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:13.520]  not be careful about the narrative that he is continuing doctor you're right
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:17.880]  there's a lot of military and police who know better than to follow illegal
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:21.640]  orders and that's why we have great organizations like the oath keepers
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:25.640]  trying to reach those people and remind them not to follow illegal orders that
[02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:30.120]  their loyalty is to the American people but I want to switch gears briefly to
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:35.240]  the whistleblower I mean a recap the warning that you were told by a top
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:40.240]  general that 9-11 was a false flag that your knowledge about bin Laden but also
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:44.400]  the role of whistleblowers the made-off whistleblower was ignored for a decade
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:50.080]  you blew the whistle almost a decade ago barely any attention Sybil Edmonds was
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:54.800]  an FBI translator she blew the whistle so many others there's been people trying
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:59.280]  to beat the drum on this issue was it going to take to really take the 9-11
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:04.600]  false flag we don't want a continuing war on terror movement into the mainstream
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:10.480]  of the ordinary public well let me with all due respect to you in the audience I
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:15.880]  am not a whistleblower I literally am just an American citizen who when I saw
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:20.920]  the events of 9-11 not only did I understand what happened but remember I
[02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:25.600]  teach this at the war colleges in the various places so I knew right away who
[02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:31.120]  was involved Rumsfeld Cheney Wolfowitz again never been held accountable
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:37.000]  Hadley Connolly Sarice Elliott Abrams you have a whole bunch of these neocons the
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:41.480]  answer is it's very simple I really never stopped going on the air and Alex
[02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:47.280]  Jones is one of the first people to bring me up but the reality is we have to go
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:52.840]  on the air repeatedly and elect officials whom we feel really represent
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:57.240]  the voice of the people now the beginnings of the Tea Party I'm not here
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:01.960]  to criticize them had that initial urge of saying look we want less federal
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:06.600]  government we want transparency and we have one accountability that all sounds
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:12.160]  fine but the minute it was co-opted by very razzle dazzle personalities and
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:16.800]  extremely charismatic people who I don't in any way begrudge because that's the
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:21.320]  American way it was immediately diminished in importance so what really
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:25.880]  happens the critical group in this country of people who really have an
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:30.800]  infested interest in transparency and in national security are by definition
[02:50:30.800 --> 02:50:35.400]  the better we who have fought the men and women and the children who fought for
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:39.920]  our country in the various wars understand what it means that liberty is
[02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:45.840]  not given to us we have to acquire it but we will not go out and kill for just
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:50.120]  purposes that is defined by civilians who've never been in war and have no

[02:52:07.320 --> 02:52:11.360]  Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of
[02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:15.800]  government bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a
[02:52:15.800 --> 02:52:20.920]  seller of US bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing
[02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:24.520]  China by calling them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which
[02:52:24.520 --> 02:52:28.640]  is already buying about 70% of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer
[02:52:28.640 --> 02:52:32.960]  left of US Treasuries our friends at the National Inflation Association believe
[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:36.640]  that the US dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the

[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:31.120]  segment with dr. Steve Pachining doctor we have so many more questions to ask
[02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:35.800]  you first off I want to know could you do five minutes with us in overtime
[02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:40.800]  absolutely no problem for the Alex Jones show I'll do another hour well thank
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:45.480]  you very much look there's been Forbes there's been New York magazine other
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:49.800]  mainstream publications they've reported on you being on the show in the last few
[02:54:49.800 --> 02:54:53.440]  days they admit that you are who you say you are but they're trying to build a
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:57.640]  little it they're joking about it there they're not paying serious attention but
[02:54:57.640 --> 02:55:02.760]  they have been forced to respond what do you make of that sir I don't know
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:07.880]  because I don't buy Forbes I don't respect the Forbes family if you know
[02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:11.800]  anything about the Forbes family you will know with the Delano family they
[02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:17.200]  were in the drug business in the night 1890s 1880s they were selling opium to
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:21.840]  China the box of revolution so they can say whatever they want all I think they
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:25.960]  want is for somebody to buy this subscription but it's a little value to
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:30.520]  me what Forbes has to say what's the other magazine in New Yorker I did joke
[02:55:30.520 --> 02:55:35.920]  that's really a self-righteous magazine for liberals on the West End Avenue in
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:39.880]  85th Street you could sit there and mull over but I have no interest in any of
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:45.160]  them you know I'm too busy you're doing business in a really quite frankly
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:49.320]  enjoying going on your show but I have no time to read both of that but they
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:52.960]  know their extinct so they really it's nothing there of the interest is nothing
[02:55:52.960 --> 02:55:57.720]  to address there I think basically they delegitimize itself long time ago but
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:02.000]  that's what we see in all the mainstream history where they were drug
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:05.920]  pushers and they have been for a long time and then Forbes himself I think
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:10.800]  should be very careful as to whether he says anything because his own father and
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:16.360]  his family has a very very dark history and many many aspects so I would consider
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:20.840]  that they should shut their mouth up but just close up business and probably
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:26.480]  they should join your show and go on the internet that's my attitude exactly what
[02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:30.320]  do you see on the on the front do you see another false flag in the works with
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:34.840]  all this high propaganda and where would you expect to see it point of view of
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:39.120]  the extremist you would see a false flag but I as I said to you before it's a
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:43.560]  very dangerous concept for anyone in the and that's why I'm saying again to my
[02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:47.520]  colleague in the intelligence community in the military community if they're
[02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:53.280]  even thinking just thinking of doing a false flag it's a very dangerous
[02:56:53.280 --> 02:57:00.000]  consideration because this country is not the same country it was in 2001 when
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.760]  they pulled a false flag and stand on operation
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:07.440]  everybody knows now would stand down means what a false flag but for any
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:12.040]  reason there happens to be something that even smells of a false flag they
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:18.120]  will have a very serious disturbance in the United States populace and I don't
[02:57:18.120 --> 02:57:22.800]  think Obama understands it I don't really think many of his coterie do but
[02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:26.080]  fortunately there are some very bright people in the White House and they know
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:30.240]  who they are they're listening to me and they understand I think it's best that
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:35.300]  they cease and desist this absurd narrative of this of the attack on a
[02:57:35.300 --> 02:57:40.920]  mortuary to get a body that was dead for 10 years and just stop it because even
[02:57:40.920 --> 02:57:44.880]  the New York Times and Bill Keller who I do admire the managing director and I've
[02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:49.080]  known him since he was a writer a young writer you know they're beginning to
[02:57:49.080 --> 02:57:54.800]  question this and Roger Ailes who I admire immensely who's head of Fox
[02:57:54.800 --> 02:58:00.080]  News and who created Fox News he knows that this is absurd and even though
[02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:04.520]  his people below him the other shows they these people and Ted Turner who
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:09.200]  lives in my Panama 10 I mean he's a very smart individual and at some point they
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:13.720]  gonna make their own papers say okay it's enough the American public doesn't
[02:58:13.720 --> 02:58:17.120]  buy it they don't want it let's talk about the real issues which is the
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:21.760]  deficit the biggest national security problem without a doubt is right now
[02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:25.640]  our economy dr. Steve Pachinick we're gonna continue on the other side in a

[03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:32.640]  ridiculous bin Laden hoax and we're on with counter-terrorism export expert
[03:00:32.640 --> 03:00:39.160]  and and perennial government official dr. Steve Pacenek we were just talking
[03:00:39.160 --> 03:00:43.200]  about how the big wigs can see through this so many of the people can see
[03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:47.040]  through this in your previous appearances on this show you you've
[03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:51.840]  mentioned that we need a new peaceful American Revolution do you think calling
[03:00:51.840 --> 03:00:55.520]  the White House trying to reach out and let them know that people understand
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:00:59.640]  what's going on is that a good first step and how do we reach a tipping point
[03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:03.080]  sir what you did I think the American public should do that I think they
[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:07.080]  should call this senators and the congressmen and their state senators and
[03:01:07.080 --> 03:01:11.120]  I think there should be a response if there is not a response then the
[03:01:11.120 --> 03:01:15.920]  American people understand we need to have a third party and we have to start
[03:01:15.920 --> 03:01:20.360]  calling it the question number one the electoral college process that doesn't
[03:01:20.360 --> 03:01:24.800]  work anymore it doesn't represent the people of the United States secondly I
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:28.840]  think the veterans of America should really organize together along with
[03:01:28.840 --> 03:01:34.000]  their families to say you know we don't really have a legitimate third party
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:38.520]  which expresses what we want we will not accept this nonsense between the
[03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:42.080]  Republicans and Democrats which seems to be nothing more than just shifting
[03:01:42.080 --> 03:01:46.440]  hats between different members of the whorehouse I mean I remember President
[03:01:46.440 --> 03:01:50.640]  Truman saying you know when I leave the office of the presidency they wanted me
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:54.880]  to endorse various aspects he said they didn't want me as the president they
[03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:58.960]  want the office of the presidency I he said the only difference between me and
[03:01:58.960 --> 03:02:03.000]  a president is just that I'm a piano player in a whorehouse and he was very
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:07.720]  honest he left with no money no book guarantees unlike our present president
[03:02:07.720 --> 03:02:13.200]  and he left an honest poor man with his benefits from having been in World War
[03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:17.160]  one and what I'm asking again of the American public is very simple call the
[03:02:17.160 --> 03:02:21.720]  White House call you legislators call whomever but when that doesn't work which
[03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:26.320]  I suspect will not work then it's time for the American public to wake up and
[03:02:26.320 --> 03:02:30.680]  say okay there was one party that came up and represented whatever but it's time
[03:02:30.680 --> 03:02:35.080]  for us to really get together and to say to ourselves let's be practical we're
[03:02:35.080 --> 03:02:40.720]  pragmatic we're basically individuals we don't want federal government involved
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:45.240]  in our business in our private lives we don't need religion to be imposed on
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:50.520]  us and be an issue on the practical elements of our own life and where we
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:55.240]  going and we have men and women or 11 million veterans of different wars who
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:02:58.960]  are saying you know we gave our life to this country now it's time for the
[03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:03.520]  country to give us something back which is literally our democracy so in doing
[03:03:03.520 --> 03:03:08.720]  so we create papers we go on the internet we do shows like you have and we go out
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:13.080]  and demonstrate all peacefully just as the way it was done in Egypt it's done
[03:03:13.080 --> 03:03:19.840]  elsewhere if the federal government confronts us with guns and war I don't
[03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:23.840]  think that should happen nor will it happen but if that is the case I will
[03:03:23.840 --> 03:03:28.200]  be certain that there are men in the military who will not do that and we'll
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:34.000]  prevent that from happening so I say to the American public once again the voice
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:39.640]  of the people is the voice of God folks populace folks days it's your turn it's
[03:03:39.640 --> 03:03:43.640]  your chance but I am tired as an American citizen not because I'm a
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:47.760]  counterterrorist export which I think is a great line because I was
[03:03:47.760 --> 03:03:52.960]  exported out to go after terror for anything funny about the business of
[03:03:52.960 --> 03:03:58.040]  terrorism and it's something peculiar to it today's terrorist is tomorrow's
[03:03:58.040 --> 03:04:02.960]  statesman when I worked against Darifat and he killed one of our ambassadors and
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:07.880]  we hunted him and he knew we were at him years later I had to deal with him a
[03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:14.720]  statesman in the Camp David Accord and don't ever forget that because we too
[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:20.680]  American revolutionaries were born as revolutionaries John Adams Jefferson
[03:04:20.680 --> 03:04:25.560]  George what we were all terrorists in the eyes of the British years later we
[03:04:25.560 --> 03:04:32.240]  became the official founding fathers at this state now Al Qaeda is a product of
[03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:37.920]  our own government created by our government for the purposes of our national
[03:04:37.920 --> 03:04:43.640]  security those days are gone we don't see there is no more war on terrorism but
[03:04:43.640 --> 03:04:48.120]  there is an economic war which we have to address and the most serious
[03:04:48.120 --> 03:04:53.320]  national security problem is our debt and our financial growth we have to grow
[03:04:53.320 --> 03:05:01.880]  better okay I suppose that's all the time we have it is time to stand up
[03:05:01.880 --> 03:05:03.880]  you
