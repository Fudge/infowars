[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:26.920]  Texas Alex Jones welcome it's Thursday August 5th 2010
[00:26.920 --> 00:31.200]  we're gonna have wide-open phones throughout the full three hours and a
[00:31.200 --> 00:38.240]  mass of vital news and information coming up I know I've been on a three-day
[00:38.240 --> 00:47.000]  jag dealing with hundreds literally hundreds that I have seen of mainstream
[00:47.000 --> 00:54.160]  news articles and blogs and universities and governments and major think tanks
[00:54.160 --> 01:00.600]  calling for Prozac and other serotonin reuptake inhibitors lithium a dangerous
[01:00.600 --> 01:06.480]  metal and anti-psychotic to be added to the water it's got to be more than 50
[01:06.480 --> 01:09.400]  articles I mean that's just a dead reckoning number it's basically
[01:09.400 --> 01:13.600]  unlimited you can read as many as you want to find dealing with cognitive
[01:13.600 --> 01:18.520]  enhancer vaccines and they say in the articles mercury cognitively enhances
[01:18.520 --> 01:22.680]  you it's admitted heavy metal extremely toxic to the brain and they say no this
[01:22.680 --> 01:27.120]  will enhance your children being injected with mercury they've been saying
[01:27.120 --> 01:30.120]  that for about five years you know we've played different newscast here where
[01:30.120 --> 01:34.280]  they say mercury is good for your child's brain according to the government's
[01:34.280 --> 01:41.680]  definition of good behavior submitting to the tyranny I've been on a jag dealing
[01:41.680 --> 01:45.840]  with this and I'm not gonna cover it today you're welcome to call in about it
[01:45.840 --> 01:51.080]  until the third hour because there have been some big developments dealing with
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.720]  it in our video brain-eating vaccines being the top search engine off and on
[01:55.720 --> 02:00.360]  the last two days wired magazine putting out a disinfo piece against it
[02:00.360 --> 02:05.880]  of course one of the most famous tabloids out there the folks that you
[02:05.880 --> 02:10.360]  know get bring you bat boy and the president meeting with aliens on their
[02:10.360 --> 02:14.360]  cover they're the folks that give the National Enquirer a bad name National
[02:14.360 --> 02:17.400]  Enquirer actually does some of the best investigative journalism and they never
[02:17.400 --> 02:22.360]  have stories about bat boy or aliens you know landing at the White House they
[02:22.360 --> 02:28.080]  get associated in the checkout line with weekly world news and so they
[02:28.080 --> 02:34.360]  basically took my article and reported on it like it was real to discredit it
[02:34.360 --> 02:42.840]  and posted my video but spun it saying will all be zombies killing people in
[02:42.840 --> 02:49.160]  the streets so last night I did about three hours of additional not just
[02:49.160 --> 02:55.320]  research I've already researched this over the last decade but collating the
[02:55.320 --> 02:59.880]  research I thought I'd actually go over these new classes of so-called vaccines
[02:59.880 --> 03:03.560]  there's three different ways they reprogram your brain they go in and
[03:03.560 --> 03:08.760]  attack receptor sites and actually destroy the receptor sites for aggression
[03:08.760 --> 03:13.080]  or anger or stress which motivates you to know when you're too tired or when you
[03:13.080 --> 03:16.760]  need to get motivated to get angry I mean it's like saying we're gonna give you
[03:16.760 --> 03:21.520]  an injection to get rid of your nerve endings so you don't feel pain you
[03:21.520 --> 03:26.440]  don't know the day without the night you don't know the good without the bad it's
[03:26.440 --> 03:32.400]  it's like the ship without a storm the night without a dawn it's like the good
[03:32.400 --> 03:37.560]  without the bad and this latest wire article they've written two in one day
[03:37.560 --> 03:42.600]  attacking me comes out and says you know well we've written an article dealing
[03:42.600 --> 03:48.320]  with with defects in the brain defects in humanity don't you love it you've got
[03:48.320 --> 03:52.560]  these people who come along and they're gonna fix you with lithium in the water
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.480]  they're gonna fix you with Prozac in the water they're gonna fix you with
[03:57.480 --> 04:01.360]  statins in the water for your cholesterol they're gonna fix you and
[04:01.360 --> 04:05.080]  they're gonna inject you with something that fixes your brain and they're
[04:05.080 --> 04:10.600]  always lisping chicken necks who can hardly talk but they just walk around
[04:10.600 --> 04:16.160]  as the ultimate poser is going oh we're so smart and oh we're so great and oh
[04:16.160 --> 04:22.720]  we're so intellectual what they are is a bunch of control freak sickos and it's
[04:22.720 --> 04:29.520]  time we sweep these people aside intellectually I mean wired magazine
[04:29.520 --> 04:35.000]  thinks you're so dumb this this particular writer that he said that I'm a
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.880]  delusional liar and that there's no calls for lithium in the water when it's
[04:39.880 --> 04:43.480]  all over the New York Times you name it and one of his own colleagues from
[04:43.480 --> 04:47.800]  Oxford and I did some research turns out these two know each other is calling
[04:47.800 --> 04:52.320]  for forced lithium well forced prozac and another bioethicist is calling for
[04:52.320 --> 04:59.120]  forced lithium he just thinks he tells you it doesn't exist so it doesn't
[04:59.120 --> 05:04.160]  listen up friends this is Alex Jones with key information the mainstream media

[09:33.920 --> 09:38.560]  and infallwars.com it was in the federal regulations but it's an
[09:38.560 --> 09:43.720]  illustration of how brazen and how criminal and how larcenous and how
[09:43.720 --> 09:51.320]  outrageously corrupt big sis is Janet Napolitano and how arrogant they are and
[09:51.320 --> 09:57.280]  how they lie to you continually just like they told you the Patriot Act wasn't
[09:57.280 --> 10:03.080]  for US citizens it was only for terrorism section 802 said all misdemeanors no
[10:03.080 --> 10:07.200]  bill of rights no Constitution any action that endangers human life it's a
[10:07.200 --> 10:12.000]  violation of any federal or state law including jaywalking no constitutional
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.880]  right and within a year of it passing hundreds and hundreds of articles you
[10:16.880 --> 10:21.240]  can just search the term Patriot Act used in drug cases Patriot Act used in
[10:21.240 --> 10:26.640]  violent crime Patriot Act used in marijuana cases Patriot Act used in
[10:26.640 --> 10:32.080]  family court articles that say thousands of times in Florida thousands of times
[10:32.080 --> 10:37.480]  in Texas it's used thousands of times a year per state of course they lie to you
[10:37.480 --> 10:42.800]  this is what these criminals do they told you oh we're passing legislation to
[10:42.800 --> 10:48.280]  reform the Federal Reserve and the banks and then what did it openly state what
[10:48.280 --> 10:54.840]  does AP Reuters Fox News now admit after it passed Napolitano Judge Napolitano
[10:54.840 --> 10:58.680]  Ron Paul myself we all read the bill told you it gives them unlimited power
[10:58.680 --> 11:02.920]  over the economy including in Napolitano's words over a hot dog stand
[11:02.920 --> 11:08.000]  anything that deals with the economy and allows the SEC to not get in trouble
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.760]  when they protect people like Madoff but they told the public this is gonna fix
[11:13.760 --> 11:18.840]  derivatives this is gonna fix counter-fitting instruments financial
[11:18.840 --> 11:25.240]  instruments no it does nothing to stop it nothing to allow these select six
[11:25.240 --> 11:31.960]  global mega banks to issue any amount of fake credit they want which is an
[11:31.960 --> 11:37.100]  undue trade advantage they can buy off whoever that I mean it it just makes my
[11:37.100 --> 11:43.360]  blood boil everything they do is a manifest total criminal action and the
[11:43.360 --> 11:47.080]  sky's the limit as they reported in Bloomberg last week what do they
[11:47.080 --> 11:53.200]  report in Bloomberg last week that every major insurance company in the last
[11:53.200 --> 11:57.600]  four years got the feds to change regulations not a law the feds just
[11:57.600 --> 12:02.080]  changed the regulations they're not even real laws to allow them to keep your
[12:02.080 --> 12:09.840]  death benefits and it mentioned cases of 400,000 500,000 or more dollars of
[12:09.840 --> 12:15.160]  people's insurance policies in the military the death benefits and they
[12:15.160 --> 12:19.280]  just keep the money and say you know what you're not gonna get it and if you
[12:19.280 --> 12:22.960]  try to protest we'll send men out in black uniforms and ski masks with
[12:22.960 --> 12:28.280]  batons to beat your brains in pal we'll have unmarked black vans with plain
[12:28.280 --> 12:35.040]  clothes private mercenaries grab you and put a bag over your head they are
[12:35.040 --> 12:39.040]  stealing everything and don't say you weren't warned for people that listen to
[12:39.040 --> 12:43.800]  the show and make jokes about it don't say you weren't warned they now admit
[12:43.800 --> 12:47.960]  we're going into a depression that there was never a let-up in the
[12:47.960 --> 12:55.000]  recession all right I'm I'm ranting I I just want to take your phone calls
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.200]  today and cover the news let me just mention the stacks I have here one two
[13:00.200 --> 13:08.080]  three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen stacks I mean look
[13:08.080 --> 13:14.840]  at this baby look at this baby right here this baby is vaccines that attack
[13:14.840 --> 13:18.680]  your brain and drugs in the water all mainstream news and government documents
[13:18.680 --> 13:26.120]  look at that that's got to be 30 40 50 articles and government documents we're
[13:26.120 --> 13:30.760]  gonna try to get into that in the third hour today but let me just run over a
[13:30.760 --> 13:33.320]  few of the headlines and I'm going right to your calls and I'm gonna interspersed
[13:33.320 --> 13:37.120]  this news throughout the transmission police film dragging women and babies
[13:37.120 --> 13:41.440]  during protest CNN we've got this linked up on info wars dot com and what's
[13:41.440 --> 13:46.120]  chilling about this in France is they're beating up these African immigrants
[13:46.120 --> 13:52.760]  and dragging babies along the ground and it goes the video goes on and on and on
[13:52.760 --> 13:57.960]  and on and the CNN host says well this is what government has to do to maintain
[13:57.960 --> 14:03.440]  order if they're gonna deport the illegals which they're not even doing
[14:03.440 --> 14:06.760]  there they're getting rid of their shanty town you sure don't need to drag
[14:06.760 --> 14:15.120]  babies along the ground and what's done to immigrants is later done to other
[14:15.120 --> 14:19.840]  people if you can get away with this with immigrants and that's why I have
[14:19.840 --> 14:25.240]  protested at the FEMA camp in Taylor where they hold entire entire illegal
[14:25.240 --> 14:29.920]  alien families with their children they send CPS in and adopt some of their
[14:29.920 --> 14:33.240]  kids out they're in there taking them for American families that want them
[14:33.240 --> 14:36.920]  most American families are compartmentalized and don't realize what's
[14:36.920 --> 14:40.120]  going on and don't know where these Hispanic three and four and five year
[14:40.120 --> 14:45.760]  olds they're getting came from and they really abuse their rights I'm against
[14:45.760 --> 14:51.040]  having open borders but I'm also against abusing their rights on top of it
[14:51.040 --> 14:55.520]  Rex 84 from the 1986 congressional hearings with Oliver North and others
[14:55.520 --> 14:58.960]  and the subsequent articles in the Houston Chronicle Wall Street Journal
[14:58.960 --> 15:03.760]  in the last five years that we've covered in my films say that these camps
[15:03.760 --> 15:09.000]  have the dual use for illegal alien families but also for citizens and
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.760]  they're preparing them during emergencies so very very serious well
[15:13.760 --> 15:18.920]  that's just one of the stories federal police officer shot dog at Park
[15:18.920 --> 15:24.080]  Baltimore Sun two dogs just got in a fight at a dog park a husky and another
[15:24.080 --> 15:29.440]  dog so the cop just shot them both completely crazy it's like that video
[15:29.440 --> 15:37.440]  in the same place there in Baltimore Maryland where the guy is on his
[15:37.440 --> 15:41.240]  motorcycle with a mounted camera on his head motorcycles do this a lot it's a
[15:41.240 --> 15:47.840]  popular thing on online and he video taped himself doing a wheelie a plain
[15:47.840 --> 15:52.120]  closed cop pulls him over almost runs him out the road and jumps out with a
[15:52.120 --> 15:58.000]  gun and the guys got a camera and he says sir I'm just you know he gives him a
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.920]  ticket the guy puts it on YouTube and they arrest him in charging with felon
[16:01.920 --> 16:05.400]  he's saying it was wiretapping and of course even the mainstream media saying
[16:05.400 --> 16:09.360]  it's not really illegal to film cops it's illegal to sneak up to a cop or
[16:09.360 --> 16:12.920]  anybody else's house at midnight and film them in their underwear through the
[16:12.920 --> 16:17.640]  window watching television because there's a perception of privacy in your
[16:17.640 --> 16:22.240]  own home you can't be prowling around doing that in people's homes or
[16:22.240 --> 16:28.320]  businesses but if cops are out on the street beating people up and somebody
[16:28.320 --> 16:31.680]  videotaped them from a hundred yards away you can't charge them with wire
[16:31.680 --> 16:35.960]  tapping you can't charge them with eavesdropping but it just shows how
[16:35.960 --> 16:47.000]  they're naked body scanning us but then saying that we can't videotape them so
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.680]  that's just some of the news on that front I don't usually get into UFOs but
[16:50.680 --> 16:55.800]  this is out of the London Telegraph today UFO files Winston Churchill feared
[16:55.800 --> 17:02.280]  panic over Second World War RAF incident with giant UFOs he feared a panic
[17:02.280 --> 17:06.920]  and loss of faith in religion newly released secret file show I'll be
[17:06.920 --> 17:11.440]  covering that later very strange and of course I just mentioned this but here it
[17:11.440 --> 17:16.200]  is out of time magazine should videotaping the police really be a crime
[17:16.200 --> 17:21.660]  Anthony Graber a Maryland National Air National Guard's staff sergeant faces
[17:21.660 --> 17:24.960]  16 years in prison his crime he videotaped his March encounter with
[17:24.960 --> 17:29.320]  state trooper who pulled him over for speeding on a motorcycle then Graber
[17:29.320 --> 17:34.080]  put the video which could put the officer in a bad light on YouTube it
[17:34.080 --> 17:37.240]  doesn't sound like much but Graber is not the only person being slapped down
[17:37.240 --> 17:41.720]  the long arm of the law well they're misappropriating a law and it's gonna
[17:41.720 --> 17:44.080]  end up getting thrown out of court unless they're able to get into plea
[17:44.080 --> 17:49.360]  bargain they're trying to create a new precedent for this imagine your
[17:49.360 --> 17:55.040]  videotape of yourself a crazy cop pulls up in plain clothes jumps out points of
[17:55.040 --> 18:00.440]  gun at you the guy's like hey bro what's wrong cop comes to his senses puts
[18:00.440 --> 18:06.440]  the gun away writes him a ticket the fellow puts it on the online and he
[18:06.440 --> 18:12.320]  gets arrested is facing 16 years in prison under this rule then all these
[18:12.320 --> 18:17.520]  police cameras and highway cameras are eavesdropping under an illegal against
[18:17.520 --> 18:20.960]  us what are you gonna do go file charges against the police you can't do
[18:20.960 --> 18:25.920]  that because there's no perception of privacy in public that doesn't mean as
[18:25.920 --> 18:32.720]  a society we can choose not to have our tax money fund all those cameras and I'm
[18:32.720 --> 18:37.200]  seeing these stories out of mainly Maryland but also Connecticut I'm
[18:37.200 --> 18:42.600]  seeing them out of Florida I'm seeing them out of California I'm seeing them
[18:42.600 --> 18:46.840]  out of states where they don't even have these wiretapping laws or where they
[18:46.840 --> 18:53.560]  have one-party wiretap laws where if I decide to record a conversation then
[18:53.560 --> 19:01.240]  it's okay that's okay in Texas but it's not okay what is it in 11 states now but
[19:01.240 --> 19:04.520]  it just shows how they're using this to intimidate people okay that's just one
[19:04.520 --> 19:10.440]  stack that's just one stack look at this one Mexico looks to legalize drugs as
[19:10.440 --> 19:16.880]  drug war murders reach 28,000 since their new crackdown began sorry I've been
[19:16.880 --> 19:20.640]  saying 24,000 it's now 28,000 sorry it's worse than I said of course it
[19:20.640 --> 19:25.680]  normally is home video claims to show at Arizona police enforcing illegal
[19:25.680 --> 19:29.440]  immigration law traffic stop and I watched this video this is what police do
[19:29.440 --> 19:34.200]  to citizens all day now if you want to say these type of checkpoints are wrong
[19:34.200 --> 19:39.200]  for illegal aliens they're wrong for citizens as well oh here's another one
[19:39.200 --> 19:47.480]  gender-bending chemical and food tins may cut male fertility that's the male but

[20:21.040 --> 20:25.120]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[20:25.120 --> 20:29.680]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[20:29.680 --> 20:33.800]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[24:23.760 --> 24:29.120]  when I walked out there during the break two different issues when I was talking
[24:29.120 --> 24:37.120]  about this headline feds admit a storing checkpoint body scan images this is such
[24:37.120 --> 24:42.080]  old news for us because it was admitted in the federal regulations and in the
[24:42.080 --> 24:47.440]  purchase orders in the last few years for the naked body scanners they first
[24:47.440 --> 24:51.360]  started putting these in at select airports about six years ago and now
[24:51.360 --> 24:55.440]  they're going into almost every major airport 200 plus but they pointed out
[24:55.440 --> 25:00.520]  this article says that it's also in the federal courthouses and then in places
[25:00.520 --> 25:05.920]  like Denver they're putting them in at the county courthouses and state
[25:05.920 --> 25:11.520]  courthouses I mean this is just all over the nation and then at a single federal
[25:11.520 --> 25:20.080]  courthouse they stored 35,314 images of the men women and children going in and
[25:20.080 --> 25:25.120]  it goes on to say this follows an earlier disclosure by the TSA that it
[25:25.120 --> 25:29.480]  requires all airport body scanners it purchases to be able to store and
[25:29.480 --> 25:33.600]  transmit images for testing training and evaluation purposes and it's come out
[25:33.600 --> 25:37.760]  that they're saving those as well and have tried to make TV stars and other
[25:37.760 --> 25:45.440]  people sign color printouts of their naked bodies so again lying to you when
[25:45.440 --> 25:50.480]  they told you that these machines can't even store your image and we're not
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.160]  storing it or don't listen to those conspiracy theorist you know they're
[25:56.160 --> 26:01.040]  saying we're taking your baby's blood at birth for the Pentagon what's next that
[26:01.040 --> 26:05.560]  we're drugging the water and then now they admit they have been for 38 years
[26:05.560 --> 26:10.560]  and then here's another point all I did was read the headline from the Baltimore
[26:10.560 --> 26:19.320]  Sun federal police officer shot dog in park and it goes on to say the
[26:19.320 --> 26:27.000]  authorities say man killed husky dogs after fought in park but the eyewitnesses
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.840]  in the article are saying the dogs were just playing you know dogs will jump
[26:30.840 --> 26:35.240]  around and frolic and put their front paws up and kind of run into each other
[26:35.240 --> 26:40.000]  bare bare a brown and white husky that was about three years old was playing in
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.080]  the quail run dog park at about 6 30 p.m. running off leash inside the fenced in
[26:45.080 --> 26:50.320]  area when the officer and his wife arrived with a German shepherd oh well
[26:50.320 --> 26:54.720]  you don't so I guess you know if a cop shows up with his dog and his dog runs
[26:54.720 --> 26:59.360]  over to play with yours if your dog doesn't submit kind of like if a citizen
[26:59.360 --> 27:02.600]  doesn't get in a praying position the cops will beat you to death and say you
[27:02.600 --> 27:05.400]  assaulted them even though it's on their own squad car video you don't touch
[27:05.400 --> 27:11.120]  him it doesn't matter I mean they've had huge parades in Texas when a police
[27:11.120 --> 27:16.000]  dog gets killed but then when they kill a citizen it's like that's just scum
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.440]  their dogs are better than us remember Newcastle PA a few years ago the guy was
[27:21.440 --> 27:25.920]  in a Walmart parking lot and the police dog jumped out of the car at him so he
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.520]  just yelled at it and said no and the cops didn't like that disrespect so they
[27:30.520 --> 27:36.600]  charged him with assault for verbally yelling at the dog Newcastle Pennsylvania
[27:36.600 --> 27:41.040]  Bear Bear a brown and white husky that was about three years old was playing in
[27:41.040 --> 27:44.080]  the quail run dog park about 6 30 p.m. running off leash inside the
[27:44.080 --> 27:49.000]  fenced in area when the officer and his wife arrived with a German shepherd who
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.040]  was kept on a leash when the dogs began to play roughly the federal officer asked
[27:53.040 --> 27:57.880]  Bear Bear's guardian his owner's brother to call off the dog but before he could
[27:57.880 --> 28:02.000]  do anything the officer pulled out a gun and shot Bear Bear according to the
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.280]  Huskies owner Bear Bear who belongs to Rachel Ratelia died of his injuries a
[28:08.280 --> 28:11.320]  few hours later well the dog was probably obviously in a right wing
[28:11.320 --> 28:15.520]  extremist County police did not name the federal God I mean the federal
[28:15.520 --> 28:20.720]  officer I've been bawling my eyes out since 7 p.m. last night she said it's
[28:20.720 --> 28:24.760]  grief mixed with anger we're so angry at this guy was able to take our animal for
[28:24.760 --> 28:29.120]  what we feel was no reason at all well he's a God and you're just a blood bag
[28:29.120 --> 28:32.880]  that's there to supply blood to the government what does congressman Stark
[28:32.880 --> 28:36.080]  say the federal government can do anything to you individually at once
[28:36.080 --> 28:41.680]  anything you have no rights Goldman Sachs rules you you will drink poison
[28:41.680 --> 28:45.800]  water you will have your pension fund taken dead vets will have their
[28:45.800 --> 28:52.160]  insurance money taken the Federal Reserve is your lord period shut up and
[28:52.160 --> 28:58.440]  lie that in fact this woman and this man for even complaining should be sent to
[28:58.440 --> 29:03.360]  a FEMA camp now did you even look that God in the eyes he showed you didn't he
[29:03.360 --> 29:08.720]  I've been bawling my eyes out and they go on from there we still don't believe
[29:08.720 --> 29:14.720]  that he's gone we just want wanted so badly to be diligent about this the
[29:14.720 --> 29:20.120]  officer has to pay some sort of consequences for his foolishness but I
[29:20.120 --> 29:23.880]  mean constantly they come to your house with a drug warrant even at the wrong
[29:23.880 --> 29:28.920]  house and they'll shoot Chihuahuas corgis if the dog barks it the officer isn't
[29:28.920 --> 29:32.280]  in control and in their threat continuum of force they've got to be in
[29:32.280 --> 29:35.800]  control and they're gonna show you they're gonna show you the blood bag
[29:35.800 --> 29:41.320]  look you exist to serve the state the state is God submit your blood your

[33:26.680 --> 33:31.200]  the basic need of an immigrant community such as shelter clashes with the need of

[33:35.560 --> 33:40.080]  this video and not react in some shock it it occurred about a week ago when
[33:40.080 --> 33:43.600]  police in the northeastern suburb of Paris tried to evict a group of spotters
[33:43.600 --> 34:11.600]  from a housing project scheduled for demolition
[34:11.600 --> 34:15.560]  that most of the demonstrators are from Ivory Coast we want to make it very
[34:15.560 --> 34:19.240]  clear that in showing this we are not accusing the police of racism we are
[34:19.240 --> 34:22.680]  not implying that they use excessive force several people who saw this video
[34:22.680 --> 34:27.840]  questioned why mothers would have infant children on their backs in such a
[34:27.840 --> 34:32.320]  protest this is simply an example of the difficulty one region faces and dealing
[34:32.320 --> 34:36.960]  with its migrant community now in fact French authorities had offered the
[34:36.960 --> 34:40.720]  protesters temporary accommodation in hotel rooms whilst their cases were
[34:40.720 --> 34:45.640]  evaluated the video was shot by the group right to housing I talked a short
[34:45.640 --> 34:50.400]  time ago with spokesman I began by asking him so there's the whitewash they
[34:50.400 --> 34:56.840]  can't just show you a video by the way African women and in any group in the
[34:56.840 --> 35:01.000]  third world that's how you carry your babies is on your back you know they've
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.120]  got them tucked in to their backs these are poor people they don't have the
[35:04.120 --> 35:09.240]  expensive strollers and things so see it's their fault that police were
[35:09.240 --> 35:13.040]  dragging their children and their babies and grabbing them by their arms and
[35:13.040 --> 35:18.400]  tugging them with extreme force when there was no need to do that they're
[35:18.400 --> 35:23.640]  just slowly conditioning you to accept all of this and it's all about the state
[35:23.640 --> 35:28.760]  dominating every facet of our lives here's one from Oregon live the
[35:28.760 --> 35:34.680]  Oregonian Portland lemonade stand runs into health inspectors needs a hundred
[35:34.680 --> 35:39.200]  and twenty dollar license to operate and it says the seven-year-old Julie
[35:39.200 --> 35:43.760]  Murphy of Oregon City still smiles about her enterprise despite running a
[35:43.760 --> 35:48.520]  fowl of county inspectors for an unlicensed lemonade stand at last
[35:48.520 --> 35:51.960]  Thursday but then all the illegal aliens who work at the work sites they
[35:51.960 --> 35:56.760]  don't have to be inspected or have to have any licenses it's only citizens
[35:56.760 --> 36:01.960]  that are kept to these standards it's hardly unusual to hear small business
[36:01.960 --> 36:04.880]  owners gripe about in licensing requirements are complained that heavy
[36:04.880 --> 36:08.920]  handed regulators are driving them into the red so when the county shut down
[36:08.920 --> 36:12.680]  enterprise last week for operating a license you might just sigh and say
[36:12.680 --> 36:15.680]  there they go again except this entrepreneur was a seven-year-old
[36:15.680 --> 36:20.160]  named Julie Murphy her business was a lemonade stand and last Thursday month
[36:20.160 --> 36:23.680]  art fair in northeast Portland the government regulation she violated
[36:23.680 --> 36:32.920]  failing to get a hundred and twenty dollar temporary restaurant license that's
[36:32.920 --> 36:37.520]  just like in Sacramento for a four-cent unpaid tax bill armed IRS agents came
[36:37.520 --> 36:42.000]  out not once but twice threatening them but then when Goldman Sachs steals
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.240]  tens of billions they don't get in trouble but you don't pay four cents
[36:46.240 --> 36:51.520]  they're coming they're angry because they want to keep you in line little girl
[36:51.520 --> 36:55.120]  you're not gonna have a lemonade stand that makes five dollars you're gonna
[36:55.120 --> 37:01.360]  pay us a hundred and twenty to do that you didn't pay a four-cent bill we
[37:01.360 --> 37:05.680]  didn't know about the four-cent bill don't we get due process no we're here
[37:05.680 --> 37:11.160]  for four cents because the government puts all the inspectors on the little
[37:11.160 --> 37:17.120]  people so they don't inspect the big guys here in Austin they'll come harass
[37:17.120 --> 37:20.840]  you if you're watering on the wrong day during water restrictions but then big
[37:20.840 --> 37:23.780]  corporations they can just have sprinklers on you know three or four
[37:23.780 --> 37:28.960]  times a day broken sprinklers nobody gets in trouble it's you the little
[37:28.960 --> 37:32.480]  people they're trying to keep in line okay let's go to your phone calls and
[37:32.480 --> 37:42.360]  then I'm going to get into EPA left to pick up climate change where Congress
[37:42.360 --> 37:48.120]  dropped the debate oh Congress won't pass the law so outside the law the EPA is
[37:48.120 --> 37:52.320]  just gonna enforce these on the American people but it won't be enforced on all
[37:52.320 --> 37:56.240]  these other countries what will that do make industry move there that's the plan
[37:56.240 --> 38:02.040]  that will be covering that we'll also get more into Virginia police illegal
[38:02.040 --> 38:06.960]  immigrant charge with killing none after injuring two others in car crash that
[38:06.960 --> 38:12.240]  is coming up more mainstream news on gender-bending chemical in food tins
[38:12.240 --> 38:17.960]  may cut male fertility and it's also in 40% of receipts that you're being
[38:17.960 --> 38:21.400]  given and they say just a little bit of contact with this can reduce fertility
[38:21.400 --> 38:26.400]  or sterilized men increased cancer that's the state of Maryland's own
[38:26.400 --> 38:32.680]  analysis of that so also Newsweek reports will this phone kill you and
[38:32.680 --> 38:36.200]  they're just letting you know yeah cell phones do give you brain cancer but
[38:36.200 --> 38:41.520]  that's just the way it is so we'll be breaking that down as well and a lot of
[38:41.520 --> 38:47.560]  other important news today but right now let's go to your phone calls let's talk
[38:47.560 --> 38:53.320]  to Victoria in Montana Victoria you're on the air good morning thank you Alex
[38:53.320 --> 38:58.640]  I have two things to tell you about and one question to ask you the first one I
[38:58.640 --> 39:03.280]  wanted to tell you about TSA what they did to me you won't believe this but in
[39:03.280 --> 39:10.000]  the in the airport in North Dakota a TSA man actually hit me well of course he
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.600]  did you know he's letting you know that they've been told crack some skulls let
[39:15.600 --> 39:21.000]  them know to submit I mean I was in Billings at the airport flying out and
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.240]  they were just screaming at women for one ounce of perfume or one ounce of
[39:25.240 --> 39:29.280]  lotion they dug through my bag and screamed at me and I said listen lady
[39:29.280 --> 39:33.920]  your sign right there says three ounces and she's shot up real quick they're
[39:33.920 --> 39:39.560]  there to let you know you are their property so so so tell us tell us who
[39:39.560 --> 39:45.560]  hits you one of the TSA man what happened was I my carry on that went through
[39:45.560 --> 39:50.920]  made this you know ringing sound and so they said oh gotta be something in here
[39:50.920 --> 39:55.720]  so my key to unlock it so they could look into in there to see that there was
[39:55.720 --> 40:01.120]  nothing there but my jewelry bag I reached over to zip the little pop pocket
[40:01.120 --> 40:06.560]  so I could give him the key and he grabbed me by my arm hit my arm and
[40:06.560 --> 40:11.560]  slung it and I was so appalled it was all that I could do to keep from slapping
[40:11.560 --> 40:14.960]  his face and if you talk back that had taken you in a back room and beating
[40:14.960 --> 40:20.640]  your brains out and dashed around I know so I was like this I've never been back
[40:20.640 --> 40:25.600]  to that airport again now the second TSA person in Atlanta Georgia I'd already
[40:25.600 --> 40:30.720]  been through the checkpoints you know everything and sitting in the airport had
[40:30.720 --> 40:33.880]  just went up and bought one of their bottles of water since they made me
[40:33.880 --> 40:38.560]  throw the other one away and he came to me and said I have to check this water
[40:38.560 --> 40:43.240]  for a bomb I thought are you kidding me I said oh yeah that's the new thing even
[40:43.240 --> 40:46.880]  after you go through they then harass you and it's to train them that it's
[40:46.880 --> 40:51.120]  normal it's to train you that it's normal and this is just being done
[40:51.120 --> 40:56.040]  everywhere but listen I do not want to fly through George Herbert Walker Bush
[40:56.040 --> 41:02.740]  Airport I've flown through twice once I came in out of England on a continental
[41:02.740 --> 41:08.080]  flight and literally it was like being in a concentration camp there were
[41:08.080 --> 41:14.720]  crazy TSA people screaming at everyone saying hurry up people were unpacking
[41:14.720 --> 41:20.040]  things as fast as they could the TSA was wild eyed just on these crazy power
[41:20.040 --> 41:25.240]  trips and then my parents flew to a wedding with my 85 year old grandmother
[41:25.240 --> 41:29.140]  who had polio in the 50s she can barely walk but she makes herself walk on
[41:29.140 --> 41:34.440]  crutches they enjoyed screaming at her at George Herbert Walker Bush Airport and
[41:34.440 --> 41:40.600]  so this is how America works I mean and I've seen it in San Francisco I've seen
[41:40.600 --> 41:46.360]  it in other places where when they see an old person in a wheelchair who they
[41:46.360 --> 41:50.560]  scream at them they make them get up family tries to help them a lot of
[41:50.560 --> 41:54.720]  times they can't get up so they scream at them and it is that it's a vampiric
[41:54.720 --> 41:59.800]  orgy of evil and this is all our indoctrination then they heard you through
[41:59.800 --> 42:04.640]  the radiation bath hardcore radiation and you know top scientists to stick
[42:04.640 --> 42:09.840]  your breast cancer skin cancer they record your naked body they lie to you
[42:09.840 --> 42:14.080]  and routinely they beat people to death behind closed doors in Canada and the
[42:14.080 --> 42:19.240]  US if you talk back and then that's just the end of it but but so he comes
[42:19.240 --> 42:23.080]  over and says I got to check your water that's right and so I told him you know
[42:23.080 --> 42:27.400]  I've just bought it it was 20 ounces it only has like a couple of ounces left
[42:27.400 --> 42:31.160]  what could be in here so he goes open it up and I'm gonna check it had this
[42:31.160 --> 42:36.840]  little toolkit thing everybody was looking and so I opened the bottle and
[42:36.840 --> 42:41.440]  let him do his testing and then just to show him that I'm not being trained you
[42:41.440 --> 42:46.000]  know like a dog I did it in plain view put the top on it went over and threw it
[42:46.000 --> 42:52.560]  in the trash and then went back and you know how thousands of women have been
[42:52.560 --> 42:56.560]  made to drink their own breast milk of course I've been through airports before
[42:56.560 --> 43:00.080]  they totally banned walking through with the water and they say take a drink and
[43:00.080 --> 43:03.800]  it's an act of submission and I'll go no it's alright and they go let me check
[43:03.800 --> 43:06.920]  it's what you want to throw it away it's all about their control you're being
[43:06.920 --> 43:10.880]  trained as a blood bag to submit to the vampires when ordered because they're
[43:10.880 --> 43:14.760]  the low-level vampires training you for the bankers to fully suck you dry
[43:14.760 --> 43:20.480]  they're kind of the Renfield enforcers of Nosferatu of course they they're being
[43:20.480 --> 43:25.160]  brainwashed this is all normal but all over the country they tell women what's
[43:25.160 --> 43:30.840]  in that baby bottle well it's it's milk drink it well well no it's my milk but
[43:30.840 --> 43:34.480]  then the mother knows she's pumped milk she's about to be on a six-hour flight
[43:34.480 --> 43:39.040]  she can't she can't get it out in the bathroom and pump again and so she
[43:39.040 --> 43:42.440]  they'll go ahead and submit for their baby and alright I'll drink my own milk
[43:42.440 --> 43:47.120]  and the cops just like next it'll be your urine whore I mean you know and it's
[43:47.120 --> 43:50.720]  like just like they're gonna we're gonna take your insurance money and we're
[43:50.720 --> 43:54.480]  gonna take everything you've gotten we're gonna shut down lemonade stands and
[43:54.480 --> 43:57.560]  we're gonna shut down people selling watermelons on the side of the street
[43:57.560 --> 44:01.400]  and we're gonna swat team the Amish and take their kids and we're gonna take
[44:01.400 --> 44:05.120]  your property and we're gonna I mean they are just and we're gonna drug your
[44:05.120 --> 44:09.240]  water supply and make you submit I mean can you believe how crazy it's gotten
[44:09.240 --> 44:15.280]  Victoria I can't I'm just really shocked that people allow this that we're like
[44:15.280 --> 44:19.040]  you know people just won't draw the line in the fan and say no and I mean we
[44:19.040 --> 44:22.960]  have to because of the way things are accelerating if we don't we're gonna be
[44:22.960 --> 44:27.600]  in real trouble a second I wanted to tell you about a sneaky way that children
[44:27.600 --> 44:32.160]  are being classified and set up for academic failure and big pharma drugs
[44:32.160 --> 44:36.520]  in public schools this is a good one okay I taught junior high and high school
[44:36.520 --> 44:41.080]  first and found a large number of students couldn't read so I had to
[44:41.080 --> 44:45.360]  actually teach them phonics 12th graders 9th graders 7th graders before I
[44:45.360 --> 44:49.400]  could even teach a regular subject matter because by design 60 years ago they
[44:49.400 --> 44:54.200]  got rid of phonics the true way to teach people and made it be by visual as if a
[44:54.200 --> 44:59.280]  child supposed to recognize every word in the English language magically which
[44:59.280 --> 45:03.120]  is hundreds of times harder to literally instead of phonically doing it please
[45:03.120 --> 45:09.560]  continue okay so I started teaching kindergarten so I would be able to reach
[45:09.560 --> 45:14.040]  children early so they could start their education with the solid foundation and
[45:14.040 --> 45:19.200]  healthy self-esteem instead of being classified as special education students
[45:19.200 --> 45:24.360]  for bad behavior they've gone from what 2% a few decades ago being in it to some
[45:24.360 --> 45:28.480]  schools 30% they're classifying everyone and then putting them into a
[45:28.480 --> 45:34.520]  curriculum where they're not taught exactly and it's all about behavior
[45:34.520 --> 45:39.240]  programming so they push them in there and force the kids to become illiterate
[45:39.240 --> 45:44.360]  self-destructive and then in they end up on riddling and if the parents don't
[45:44.360 --> 45:49.800]  give it to them they will actually take them and so oh yeah I think so so what I
[45:49.800 --> 45:56.640]  did as a gift and everything I made a blog with free information and lessons
[45:56.640 --> 46:02.600]  step-by-step lessons on how to learn to read because it's such a real bad because
[46:02.600 --> 46:06.080]  again they won't let the teachers in the school teach them the way it worked for
[46:06.080 --> 46:09.640]  thousands of years and how every culture teaches it and again they did this by
[46:09.640 --> 46:12.800]  design but think about what you just said and it's been all over the news won't
[46:12.800 --> 46:16.120]  put your child on Prozac won't put them on a riddle and won't put them on
[46:16.120 --> 46:19.840]  lithium because the especially little boys because they talk and raise their
[46:19.840 --> 46:26.720]  hands too much and play you know you know grab butt on the playground which
[46:26.720 --> 46:33.160]  is what boys do now they come in and take your child that's the government
[46:33.160 --> 46:37.120]  taking your child kidnapping your child because you won't drug them that's
[46:37.120 --> 46:40.800]  forced drugging and now they're proposing it for everyone in the water go
[46:40.800 --> 46:45.200]  ahead well that's true so can I get about the name of the free blog for
[46:45.200 --> 46:48.580]  people that want to help their kids with their eating absolutely now this is
[46:48.580 --> 46:52.640]  radical we're about to send people to a site with phonics and this makes big
[46:52.640 --> 46:56.880]  brother mad we're committing an al-qaeda atrocity right now this is very extreme
[46:56.880 --> 47:06.920]  I'll give us the website okay it's a WWW dot phonics reading dot pro excuse me
[47:06.920 --> 47:13.920]  phonics reading pro dot com I'm sorry WWW dot phonics reading pro dot com and I
[47:13.920 --> 47:19.160]  also have a dot net with plenty of resources because everybody give it
[47:19.160 --> 47:28.000]  one more time WWW dot phonics reading pro dot com well God bless you and I
[47:28.000 --> 47:32.520]  appreciate your call of Victoria and her active resistance is what will bring
[47:32.520 --> 47:38.360]  down the new world order you know how radical and how extremist she is as an
[47:38.360 --> 47:43.280]  info warrior infiltrating the school system and secretly trying to teach
[47:43.280 --> 47:48.480]  them how to read I mean do you know how much that makes the enemy mad you're
[47:48.480 --> 47:51.400]  supposed to start teaching children how to read at three my son could read at
[47:51.400 --> 47:56.640]  three and a half the others we didn't focus on as much so age five and you
[47:56.640 --> 48:00.960]  teach them with very simple phonics how to sound it out over and over again
[48:00.960 --> 48:05.160]  boom they've got it my son is reading 11th 12th grade level now and he's eight
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.640]  years old I mean he's now it's kind of freaking me out though I'll catch him
[48:09.640 --> 48:13.000]  with like adult textbooks and things reading it and spouting off endless
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.200]  statistics at me he knows more than I do at age eight in many areas now and
[48:17.200 --> 48:21.240]  that's what scares the enemy forces they didn't get their mercury in him they
[48:21.240 --> 48:25.600]  didn't get their sodium fluoride in him and so he's just seething with energy
[48:25.600 --> 48:31.080]  and intelligence I mean he's scary smart scary smart and because you didn't get
[48:31.080 --> 48:35.680]  to ruining scum you didn't get to brain damage him I know that makes all you a
[48:35.680 --> 48:39.400]  feminine elitist out there that love brain damage and people part of your
[48:39.400 --> 48:45.040]  power trip angry oh a lot of kids are getting away from you and your eugenics
[48:45.040 --> 48:49.560]  are too bad for you murderers try to murder the psyche murder the spirit
[48:49.560 --> 48:54.220]  murder creativity bunch of murderers who traffic and people souls and their
[48:54.220 --> 49:03.400]  psyches but that is so radical what she's doing so subversive because as
[49:03.400 --> 49:08.440]  George Arwell said telling the truth you know in a time of universal deceit
[49:08.440 --> 49:15.640]  telling the truth is a revolutionary act and so Victoria starting that website
[49:15.640 --> 49:21.640]  doing what she's doing see public schools get roughly three times the money
[49:21.640 --> 49:28.360]  for a special needs child so two three percent twenty plus years ago we're in
[49:28.360 --> 49:32.520]  special ed now they've got areas where a third of the school is there cuz they're
[49:32.520 --> 49:38.640]  getting more cash haha so the superintendent can get 700 grand a year
[49:38.640 --> 49:44.760]  isn't it good works real good they got bounties on your children in England and

[54:43.360 --> 54:48.840]  back to Brian by the way I wanted to get Alan Wadd on the next few days so
[54:48.840 --> 54:53.000]  he's available today we were gonna get him on about these vaccines that attack
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.680]  the brain and the fluoride the water and the lithium in the water coming up in
[54:56.680 --> 55:00.440]  the third hour today we're gonna continue with your calls and news let's go
[55:00.440 --> 55:06.840]  ahead right now and go back to Brian in Pennsylvania he was bringing up
[55:06.840 --> 55:14.800]  the situation with truck driving go ahead sir well I know what you have told
[55:14.800 --> 55:18.320]  us about Maury strong talking about shutting down our industry what
[55:18.320 --> 55:22.440]  trucking is a big part of industry if they shut us down to eight hours a day
[55:22.440 --> 55:25.920]  it's gonna be hard enough when there is not enough trucks to move the freight
[55:25.920 --> 55:32.040]  mail to keep stores stocked there it's in the proposal stage well they're gonna
[55:32.040 --> 55:36.980]  make you cheat and they're gonna digitally with the with the RFID scanners
[55:36.980 --> 55:41.720]  track you and big corporations here's an example Tyson's allowed to have all
[55:41.720 --> 55:45.760]  the violations they want in chicken production to have a semi-monopoly BP's
[55:45.760 --> 55:49.360]  allowed to have many more times violations than anybody else and they're
[55:49.360 --> 55:53.000]  given all the safety awards so small companies are gonna be shut down and
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.760]  globalists are gonna be able to have their truck drivers drive a hundred hours
[55:55.760 --> 56:02.040]  a week go ahead well it gets worse than that they've proposed this bill is called
[56:02.040 --> 56:06.560]  a broker reform bill a lot of brokers snatch up all the freight because if you
[56:06.560 --> 56:09.600]  own your own company and you have your own authority you don't have to use a
[56:09.600 --> 56:14.280]  broker you can go to a company and contract loads they're trying to stop
[56:14.280 --> 56:18.840]  that with this bill they make it sound good because they're you know they know
[56:18.840 --> 56:22.400]  how they do it they go after they say we're going to get those evil brokers
[56:22.400 --> 56:26.120]  for still you know I mean I mean the big multinational transportation companies
[56:26.120 --> 56:30.000]  are shutting everybody down that that's what the New World Order is the global
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.280]  corporate mega monopolies they get to do business and do whatever they want and
[56:34.280 --> 56:38.000]  dump as much toxic waste as they want in the Gulf or have their plants blow up in
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.840]  Houston and they don't get in trouble well in the bill for the broker reform
[56:43.840 --> 56:48.400]  bill they they are gonna it's part of the bill says that if you own a company you
[56:48.400 --> 56:52.360]  have to go to a broker but they're gonna make it so expensive that you won't
[56:52.360 --> 56:56.200]  have as many brokers to them will stay in business they're raising the broker
[56:56.200 --> 57:00.920]  rates that you have to be bonded at from 10,000 to 100 sure you're not gonna be
[57:00.920 --> 57:05.080]  able to go to truck school and get a license and get a truck you don't do
[57:05.080 --> 57:10.000]  that in America you go through the global mafia that is correct I mean
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.160]  they're shutting down our industry and people need to get involved but one
[57:13.160 --> 57:18.600]  other thing they they're doing this hours of service change under the guys of
[57:18.600 --> 57:24.920]  safety but if people actually do the research the statistics say 75% of
[57:24.920 --> 57:31.000]  accidents that are caused between a big truck and a civilian vehicle is 75% of
[57:31.000 --> 57:36.280]  them are the civilian vehicles fault so what is the safety issue when it's
[57:36.280 --> 57:40.440]  proven that truck driving is one of the safest industries out here because
[57:40.440 --> 57:44.160]  we're going to notice the media always demonizes truck drivers when I've seen
[57:44.160 --> 57:46.960]  the statistics I know you're telling the truth just like they demonize the
[57:46.960 --> 57:51.440]  internet because they want to take control of it and I've also seen some
[57:51.440 --> 57:56.160]  statistics you can pull these up put out even by the federal transportation
[57:56.160 --> 58:01.480]  administration that in states where they have rules on restricting how much a
[58:01.480 --> 58:05.680]  trucker can drive they end up driving faster and more reckless because they've
[58:05.680 --> 58:10.680]  got to get the load there than when they've got more time that is correct
[58:10.680 --> 58:15.760]  I'm spoiled my lost man tells me to run legal and I do two runs a week up to the
[58:15.760 --> 58:19.240]  northeast from the south and I'm able to do it under the rules we got but if they
[58:19.240 --> 58:22.600]  change the rules I won't be able to do it because I don't mean a pay cut it'll
[58:22.600 --> 58:26.320]  mean everything it'll shut down the industry and one more I got one more
[58:26.320 --> 58:30.280]  point and I'll let you go I heard this morning I'm trying to get the documents
[58:30.280 --> 58:36.480]  that they are training at the hospitals and to not tell us about our MIT
[58:36.480 --> 58:44.840]  implementation for the vaccine stay there thank you for listening to GCN

[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.320]  Alex Jones
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.920]  Alan Watts joining us coming up at about 40 minutes into the third hour I'll
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:33.840]  continue with Brian, Brad, Ronnie, Steve, Desiree and others the toll-free number
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:39.520]  to join us is 800-259-9231 I got a bunch of other important news we're gonna be
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:44.000]  covering as well before Alan joins us then when he's on with us but Brian and
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.480]  PA was bringing up one final point he just dropped off he wanted to bring up
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:53.800]  well you heard him at the end of the last hour he was saying he's heard that
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:58.960]  they're putting RFID in the vaccines there are patents for that and there are
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:04.800]  patents for RFID in pills that you take but more important they have gene marker
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:10.480]  viruses where the viruses go in and do all sorts of different things to your
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.920]  body your brain your organs but they can also create viral markers in your body
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:20.200]  to track you so all of this high-tech science that could be used to extend
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:26.400]  life and empower humanity it's almost all being used to enslave and to control
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:33.280]  look we had upwards of 30% infant mortality over 100 years ago and
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.880]  sanitation running water and the miracles of modern medical science fixed a
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:44.280]  lot of that so people fell in love with Western science and medicine because you
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.840]  show out a good country and good doctors by and large then around the 1910 1920s
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.240]  30s eugenics totally took over the US 34 states passed laws for
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:57.520]  forced sterilization and medicine got taken over by psychiatry and the eugenicist
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:04.200]  this is all mainline history I mean you just go research it it's not really
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:08.160]  taught in schools but it's in the mainline text of history and so now
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.040]  medicine still got somewhat of a good name but it's losing it because they
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:16.480]  just brainwash and train the medical people and the doctors and the nurses to
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.520]  carry out things that they're told are good and most of it's a very very bad
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:24.200]  what is it 300 plus thousand people die of malpractice and surgeries alone
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.120]  hundreds of thousands of infection hundreds of thousands from bad drug
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:34.560]  interactions the most dangerous place in the world is a hospital then after
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.480]  that it's your supermarket so many people you know go in for a minor
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.040]  surgery and die of the superbugs in the hospital or doctors chop off the wrong
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:51.080]  leg or they you know they take out the wrong kidney and it gets worse under
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:56.000]  the National Health Service England is a complete nightmare I mean you can come
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.200]  in having a miscarriage they don't give you care for two days you can come in
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.360]  with your leg chopped off you're gonna bleed to death they got a bunch of they
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.800]  always use foreigners you know the National Health Service for the lower
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.040]  class is all run by a bunch of non-english speaking people with quack
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.960]  medical degrees from third world nations hope you all enjoy it I know I'm
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:19.560]  going to let's go ahead and talk to Brad in Texas you're on the air good
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.480]  morning or I guess good afternoon now first-time caller been a listener for
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:29.160]  about eight years welcome sir I have a question a couple solutions I was one
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.920]  if you heard the spin they're putting on this POSAC affecting the shrimp they're
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.160]  saying it's actually a carbon dioxide that's making the water more acidic and
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:41.040]  altering their psyche making go after birds and various things so is that
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.840]  their new spin because the major I mean the major university studies found that
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:50.120]  it was controlled conditions they tested it in the Gulf but then they gave the
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.080]  same amount of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor prosac class chemical to them
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:01.360]  and so this was in controlled water with not higher levels of carbon dioxide so
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.360]  that is a complete lie who is saying this I heard it on cheerers programs I
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:10.080]  get his first name he has a program we play that's a tariff music and tell the
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.200]  news very good program it's a very entertaining but apparently he's pretty
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.040]  mainstream no I hadn't I hadn't seen that we'll search the term shrimp
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.240]  well you know shrimp killing themselves because of carbon dioxide the truth is
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:28.040]  carbon dioxide has been 14 times higher in our history we're at a very low
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.600]  level of carbon dioxide according to the climatologist and researchers and it's
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.440]  just all a quack lie and the globalist aren't saying stop genetic engineering
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.320]  cross species open-air planning it really does endanger our planet it's
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:46.720]  let's tax with plants breathe when humans exhale anything else Brad yeah a
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.800]  couple solutions all right real fast when we come back your solutions then
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.880]  Steve Desiree Ronnie many others your calls are coming up well they're right
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.080]  back
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.240]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs

[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.640]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:08.400]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.920]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.480]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.880]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:25.120]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:28.880]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:33.000]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.960]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.800]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.520]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:47.040]  science one of my old sponsors you can get more information at
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:52.640]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:08:00.840]  doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:08.120]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:15.400]  GCN radio network all right taking your calls Alan Watt coming up brand in Texas
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.760]  quickly give us your solution ideas yes I was thinking we ought to make a list of
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.920]  the modality we could do this with the sheep out this is something some of your
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.560]  audience could do make a list of the different modalities or vectors are
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:33.560]  using to affect us like the phenol a plastic the shots the mercury and at
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.760]  first kind of lie to your audience say well this may this causes brittle nails
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:40.360]  this causes hair loss this causes a bad eyesight just go down the list the
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:43.680]  longer the list the better I think and then say well actually I lied to you
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.720]  here's the actual major side effect lower fertility let's see why this one of
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:53.920]  phenol a what does it do lower fertility oh what about mercury lower
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.280]  fertility and it causes brain damage or you go down the list and as you get
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.080]  down the list if you do maybe 10 or 12 you could start laughing kind of
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.160]  demonically with a medical after what does it do now or lower fertility
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:08.200]  unbelievable we've seen anything in common here people and I think that
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.280]  wakes some people up if you have a long list and showed all the major side
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.440]  effects were basically either dumb you down or lower fertility solution I think
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:19.360]  you could use for part of the general audience could do this if they have a
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.800]  cell phone we know their data mining us and I say does that your audience is
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.960]  probably weighted heavier than the general public as far as actual real
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:31.240]  people listening to a few of them always set yourself on by the radio that way
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:34.400]  when they do out of the few people they do actually listen to they can hear
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.040]  part of the program maybe this compartmentalized well this has been
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:43.360]  done in the last five six years a lot where talk show host and others have
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:49.560]  said search the term government spies or search the term big brother or you know
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.760]  jam their systems with it so they know that we're aware of what they're doing
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.280]  but that was back in the days when they were just now admitting that the NSA
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.760]  violates the Bill of Rights and spies on everybody and has nothing to do with
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.360]  fighting terror you know now it's just right out in the open so we're doing
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:09.520]  something similar Brad when a few times a week we asked the audience to make a
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.440]  search term the number one search term we've done this seven times in the last
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.360]  three weeks and every time we've put out a search term it's become number one and
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:24.720]  then depending on which search term 30 40 50 100 200 newspapers and
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:30.040]  publications sometimes it's over 100 write articles about it and then of
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.480]  course we have an article that has that in the headline that day that becomes the
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.560]  number one story and millions read it instead of just tens of thousands I
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:44.280]  appreciate your call let's go ahead and talk to Ronnie in Texas go ahead Ronnie
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:49.200]  thank you sir I got two comments for kids and then one thing about a brand if I
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.920]  can get to it and that is for kids to cherish your childhood and reject the
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.440]  grown-up blues it's true that with that first hit off a cigarette or join or
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.760]  swig of alcohol your carefree days are finished from then on welcome to the
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.600]  grown-up world of bills obligations headaches prison time heartbreaks just
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.520]  stay out of it anyway the other thing about kids is I'm living here at the
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.240]  mag Magnolia court apartments where we have at least one full-time intelligence
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.280]  operative who follows me around to take down this extraordinarily mild though
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:23.080]  informative flyer entitled water fluoridation an idea whose time is past
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:27.840]  you've probably seen it Alex anyway within 24 hours this apartment approved
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:33.000]  these apartment approved flyers are vandalized in the stolen censoring this
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.120]  helpful info information from all what you do is you move on down the road and
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:41.400]  do it on telephone poles and other things and by the way in the next hour
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:47.160]  we're gonna post the first fluoride flyer that we've created at info wars
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.880]  calm that simply states there is poison in the water and then down at the bottom
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.600]  it gives people a bunch of key data in fact Matt Ryan this is a good time to
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:00.520]  talk about that we bring the flyer in or actually Derek had it earlier have him
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:05.280]  bringing into me I want to show people on television slash radio right now this
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.320]  flyer and I want to get it up on info wars calm the next hour and I want
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:16.120]  listeners to submit their photo shop flyers or their flyers that they've
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.840]  created so that we can then post them with simple messages Ronnie I
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:30.240]  appreciate your call Steve in Tennessee Steve you're on the air yes hey
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.400]  Steve you're on the air brother all right something happened there talking
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.520]  about how they're putting it out in our face now I was watching the history
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:43.240]  channel the other night and talking about DNA manipulation crime eras
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:50.760]  scalar energy the nephilim and everything and it was a show called ancient aliens
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.440]  missions and talking about how you know we are descended from the aliens and
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:00.320]  everything and the scalar energy talking about how they can create hurricanes
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:09.160]  and steer them the m&a manipulation and all that it was pretty interesting let
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:14.040]  me say this let me say this you know you they'll mention all these real things
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:19.040]  that are going on and then mix into its space aliens and I'm not saying people
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.920]  don't have a right to talk about it and it's intriguing and interesting it's
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.600]  just I'd like to see mainstream media do TV shows and Ventura is actually the
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:31.360]  only person to ever do this on national television where they take real
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:36.360]  documented things that the public isn't really aware of and actually focus on
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:43.200]  things like that in you know like the Bilderberg group for instance instead of
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.440]  getting into things that we can't prove one way or the other so what they do is
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:54.880]  they mix in space aliens little green men yeti's bigfoot's with real things and
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.680]  it's kind of then pigeon-holed in that genre and I'm not criticizing people
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:03.480]  that cover all that it's very interesting I'm just saying that why do we never see
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:07.160]  it presented with the documented information by itself
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:13.120]  exactly I just thought I'd bring that to your attention that you know if that's
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:17.600]  exactly what they were doing and as far as the the nephilim and all that they
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:23.040]  weren't talking about fallen angels they were just saying you know angels and
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:29.160]  so that's all I had to say about that Alex anything else Steve no sir God bless
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:33.640]  you interesting point let me just mention something that's a hundred percent proven
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:38.040]  there are so many studies that you literally could probably net they're
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:43.760]  coming out as fast as you could ever read them all I mean it's got to be in the
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:51.640]  thousands if you just look at studies show health risk from corn syrup I
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:56.400]  literally every day or two see another university study or another government
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:00.240]  study or another private study they knew this sixty years ago when they
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:06.320]  approved it but here's raw story I mentioned this yesterday but here it is
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.600]  as a public service announcement as a warning corn by-product fructose
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.600]  literally fuels cancer cell growth study finds and they're finding with people
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:21.840]  that already have pancreatic cancer that killed my great uncle just just last
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:27.320]  year what a sweetheart but they found that the hospital diets are high in
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:32.920]  corn syrup and that if they just don't feed them corn syrup that that massively
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:39.000]  decreases the size and growth of the tumor not radiation not chemotherapy
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.600]  stop eating the fructose cone syrup pancreatic tumor cells use fructose to
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:49.120]  divide and proliferate US researchers said Monday in a study that challenges
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:56.520]  the common wisdom the common wisdom that all sugars are the same but you know
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:01.040]  is it the fructose itself or is it that so much of it has mercury in it
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.320]  according to government studies because they're spraying the crops with
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:10.560]  mercury my 15-minute special video we posted last week that's got 400,000
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:17.400]  views titled food the ultimate secret has all those documents in it and so we've
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:20.520]  had scientists on we're not sure if it's the mercury or if it's the corn syrup
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:26.320]  we don't know but they spray toxic waste calling it fertilizer to get rid of it
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:34.840]  on the corn tumor cells fed both glucose and fructose use two sugars in
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.920]  different ways the team at the University of California Los Angeles found
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:41.960]  they said they're finding published in the Journal of Cancer Research may help
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:45.320]  explain why other studies that have linked fructose intake to pancreatic
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:49.520]  cancer one of the deadliest cancer types ladies and gentlemen if you're
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:56.840]  drinking two or three die so does a day that a regular corn syrup I mean how
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:00.280]  many people you know they're 25 30 years old to get pancreatic cancer who drink
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:07.440]  who drink regular sugared high fructose corn syrup drinks and candy and then
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:13.640]  you go to the diet drink it's even worse with that aspartame these findings show
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:17.840]  that cancer cells can readily metabolize fructose to increase proliferation
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:23.360]  dr. Anthony heaney I want to get him on I want to get a dr. Anthony heaney on of
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:32.600]  UCLA's Johnson Center Cancer Center and colleagues wrote so again dr. Anthony
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:39.080]  heaney of UCLA's Johnson Cancer Center and colleagues wrote quote they have
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:44.280]  major significance for cancer patients given dietary refined fructose consumption
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:48.720]  and indicate that efforts to reduce refined fructose intake or inhibit
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.040]  fructose medicated actions may disrupt cancer growth oh we're conspiracy
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:59.880]  theorist I mean I read 40 year old books written by patriots saying fructose was
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:05.600]  growing cancer and they were quoting the studies then you've seen the TV ads the
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.640]  last two years where it'll always show like some real dumb woman with a smart
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:15.080]  good-looking woman at a party and she goes is that fructose corn syrup the
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:19.280]  lady goes yes it's wonderful and healthy no it's not well what's your proof I
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:24.680]  don't have any proof I believe in aliens and she goes have it it's good she go
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:31.280]  and it's a popsicle okay oh or it'll be a beautiful scene in a park under a tree
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.960]  with a woman and her boyfriend says oh that's fructose corn syrup popsicle or
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:41.360]  drink I don't want to I don't want to have that I heard it's bad who told you
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:44.520]  conspiracy theorist actually the scientists show conclusively it's very
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:49.200]  nutritious and helpful oh thank you honey I'm an idiot because they know women do
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:53.840]  80 plus percent of the purchasing at stores so it's ads showing women is
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.800]  smart and other men and women is dumb and then women watch it and trustfully go
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:05.120]  in and go for my children I want it oh yes and I get up here and tell you

[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.280]  fluoridating because if they're not fluoridating maybe make a flyer

[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:41.360]  lower level so I have a new search term today okay this is the new search term
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:45.560]  you've made every one of them what's six or seven terms at seven now in the last

[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:55.240]  want solutions we need to get aggressive we need to get proactive we must get in
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:01.120]  the face of the establishment and cause these local debates and the system's
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.680]  gonna come out and demonize people to put these flyers up and they're gonna
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.120]  start pulling them down and having newscasts convulsing over them and
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.240]  trying to tell the public oh no fluoride's good for you but in major
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:15.560]  studies the majority of the public is now against water fluoridation and is
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:26.920]  somewhat educated and so what's going to happen is they are going to get you
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:30.640]  know the media is gonna hype this up and cause a big fuss over it and then
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.440]  they're gonna get a response they weren't intending because they're gonna see
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:36.640]  how the majority of people are gonna come out in support of this and it's
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:41.600]  gonna cause a big debate in your town about fluoride and then you can organize
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.920]  and go to city council and demand it be taken out we're also gonna add in this
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:52.120]  article links to the open letters sent by the EPA Union and others with
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:57.760]  thousands of scientists that signed on to the government to the federal

[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:18.160]  this pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste has the same amount of
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:21.880]  fluoride as one glass of water I know it varies per toothpaste and I want to
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:31.160]  change that right now to studies studies conclusively show studies
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:38.520]  conclusively show a doubling in bone cancer in men and boys from one part
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:42.680]  per million of fluoride out of the water that's what they conclusively show a
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:47.800]  doubling and that's just in that type of cancer but regardless this is gonna go

[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:09.840]  got Alan Watt patiently waiting in the wings let's talk to Desiree in Florida
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:16.800]  you're on the air hey I'm a first-time caller and I wanted to ask you if you
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:23.040]  were following at all the outbreak of the dengue virus in South Florida no and
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:28.240]  I'm glad you called a guy search a dengue virus South Florida please tell me
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:34.720]  about it yeah about a month ago it supposedly broke out in Key West I live
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:41.040]  a few hours north on the coast I'm right in between Palm Beach and Melbourne and
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:48.400]  I do live on the water and my daughter was attacked by mosquitoes and fell ill
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:54.960]  three weeks ago and had the typical symptoms of dengue virus for children
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:38:01.680]  which is less severe than adults thank God I was also bit but did not have not
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.880]  showed any symptoms and it's more dangerous for adults and through this
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:11.760]  whole process of blood work and everything and doing my research I
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:16.880]  realized that I'm feeling like there is a cover-up going on because they don't
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:21.560]  want people to know that the virus is traveling yeah there's the Reuters
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:27.600]  headline more than 1000 exposed to dengue in Florida CDC 5% of the
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.560]  population of Key West Florida more than 1000 people have been infected at
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.880]  some point with the dengue virus government researchers reported on
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:38.840]  Tuesday and of course they've caught the government releasing mosquitoes with
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:44.000]  other diseases like West Nile and of course Lyme's disease with the ticks
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.840]  out of Plum Island off the coast of New York New Jersey before so I'm sure
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:55.280]  they'll have a loving vaccine to help you with it but yeah dengue virus can be
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:01.080]  pretty serious I've heard oh yes it can and and supposedly it was released
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:06.400]  about 20 30 years ago on the CIA was linked to it and releasing it in Avon
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:12.240]  Park Florida in Panama City and a few other cities in black areas predominantly
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:16.360]  black guys when you search that because I do remember that vaguely dengue virus
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:23.120]  Florida access on park but put in the search Avon Park Avon Park CIA released
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:29.160]  dengue virus yeah and as biological weapon and well I mean as a test for
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:36.240]  biological weapon and and then so now there's you know a supposed link with
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:40.800]  it of being connected with the oil spell because from what I read online a
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:47.920]  possible link because the symptoms of dengue is very similar to the symptoms
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:54.720]  of the dispersants so I don't think it I think this was the right month for them
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:01.000]  to do this unfortunately for us and and now my all the blood work came back from
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:07.680]  my daughter for to rule out West Nile virus and strap and they're holding back
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:13.840]  the dengue virus blood work and my doctor actually called up the nurse
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:19.240]  called up and said all your blood work is back and and she's fine well man there
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.000]  have been tens of thousands of declassified releases of deadly chemicals
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.720]  and biologicals on every US city and every small town you just search the
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:33.200]  name of your small town secret government studies bacteria viruses and we
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.040]  did pull up articles this is something I missed articles from ten days ago or
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:44.480]  more reporting on the history of the CIA and the loving dengue virus so they are
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:48.720]  certainly nice people as a ray I'm glad that your child survived God bless you
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:55.680]  thanks for the info Steve in South Korea you're on the air hello Alex yes sir
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:59.160]  nice to meet you yeah it's the first time call and I just want to thank you
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:02.520]  for your show and all your excellent insights but you you are a big part of
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:08.600]  my wife's my I and my wife's daily life we tune into you every morning to get
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:11.920]  our nice refresher course on what's going on in the world I just want to make
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:15.200]  this quick because I know you don't have a lot of time I've been here two years
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:19.480]  now and let's talk about the scientific and psychological global takeover that
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:23.240]  you always refer to it's even worse here than what's going on back in the US I
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:28.280]  mean these people here it's like a sick experiment I mean all their food is GMO
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:31.920]  here the chickens the the fruit the vegetables all the fruit when you go to
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:37.400]  the fruit market every apple is the exact same size every peach every plum it's
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:41.240]  the exact same size like it's just made out of a little tell you a story I've
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:47.320]  known for about 15 years a very successful computer engineer programmer
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:55.720]  and he moved for a year to an Asian country and when he came back it was it
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:01.560]  was Singapore he said oh yes I've heard your show it's true I was doing work over
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:05.240]  there in Singapore and different neighborhoods have different drugs put
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:10.320]  in the water and and this is this this guy's in the Republican Party you know
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:14.600]  this guy's actually but he told me this in confidence and then he agreed to come
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:18.320]  on the show and then he got scared and backed out and then got very agitated
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.320]  when I called him and said please come on but he was just like matter of fact
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:25.360]  how they were how he knew that they were drugging the water over there and then
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:30.000]  he got real mad and said that he wouldn't come on and wouldn't talk about it so
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  but I mean now they're all over the news saying they're drugging the food and
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.320]  water but these pharmacological crops is where they can engineer the
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:43.760]  sterilants the brain damaging viruses the mind control systems into the food
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:48.000]  itself people over here don't even know how to fight back I mean it's not like
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.080]  the US where you try to stand up for your rights they're like they're worse
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:54.600]  than sheeple over here I mean it's like I mentioned about the ship that got sunk
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:58.520]  that it might be a false flag and try to get China and the US involved in
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:01.880]  something over here and they can't even imagine that possibility they think I'm
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:05.480]  crazy and there's no use even talking to anybody here about that they just don't
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:09.960]  have that international type of knowledge well we actually get a lot of
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:15.880]  visits from South Korea online but that may be that may be Americans that are
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:19.800]  over there but I know they're the most computer connected group in the world
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:24.320]  and spend the most time online that people routinely die after three four
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:28.440]  days at their video game terminal they literally just collapse and die I see
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:32.720]  that all the time the news every few months and and computer addiction as
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:37.040]  it's called is epidemic over there they actually have reeducation camps to get
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:40.280]  people out of their computer addiction and I know I've talked to people that
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:44.120]  work at Samsung and of course the federal regulators just let them do it
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:49.720]  there but when the head brass come women aren't even allowed to be seen and you
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:54.840]  talk about a chauvinist culture and boy it is mind control city and so yeah it's
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:59.200]  not just North Korea that's under mind control that culture has allowed total
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:03.480]  mind control in South Korea you know Kim Jong-il's daddy didn't just come up
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:07.160]  with everything that's in North Korea it's been part of Korean culture for a
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:10.760]  long time and it's very very unfortunate because they're smart people I
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:16.080]  appreciate your call one last call and we're going to Alan want John in New
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:19.760]  Mexico good to have you on with us what's up Alex how you doing buddy
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:24.760]  worldwide broadcast good to hear you I'm calling in regards to the full body
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:29.080]  scanners and airports I live here in southern New Mexico about two hours away
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:33.880]  from El Paso I work for an engineering firm and I try to talk to people here
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:38.440]  but they're all compartmentalized I think I'm crazy but when we get sent to the
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:43.280]  field you know we fly out of El Paso and I'm strongly against the full body
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:49.720]  scanners for obvious reasons but my question is is there any kind of legal
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:55.280]  exemption that we can that we can get so that we don't oh yes sir yeah yeah they
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:00.320]  have no law to do this they just order you the feds have seized the airports and
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:04.920]  now they want to expand out to the trains the highways the courthouses with the
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:11.240]  naked body scanners in fact they are and they are saving it all and so people
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:15.200]  revolted and said they weren't going to do it so they say okay you can go for a
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:20.640]  pat down instead but now the El Paso times and others report that also the
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:25.120]  Chicago Airport they're trying to force everyone through them because they can
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:28.640]  make you submit to this they can do anything you you know you bring printed

[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:23.680]  terror attacks they're staging yeah and so is there has there ever been any kind
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:28.520]  of even on a mainstream news channel has ever been any kind of interview
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:33.000]  showing the the detail of these images because I've heard people say oh it's
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.280]  it's just a solid objects you can't see they're complete liars yes we've got
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:43.320]  articles at info wars and prison planet with the TSA's own training manuals that

[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:53.880]  images it's seen at news today at the courthouses the airports it's everywhere

[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:09.720]  medical scientific dictatorship today with him and why he thinks they're now
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:13.520]  coming out and saying okay we are recording your naked bodies okay we are
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:17.960]  putting lithium in the water okay we do want to put prozec in the water okay we
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:21.600]  do want to give you shots that literally go in and reprogram your brain by
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.840]  destroying receptor sites or causing autoimmune responses every time your
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:31.140]  body releases stress hormones to literally kill the act of resistance to
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:35.760]  literally neutralize the instinct of self-preservation and make us servile
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.840]  slaves they've gone from denying this was their plan even though we analyze
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:42.920]  their own documents have been warning you for more than a decade to now
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:47.720]  suddenly over a hundred articles the last week a hundred but hundreds I mean
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.440]  just hundreds in the last month suddenly telling you your brain is
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:57.000]  malfunctioning your there's a human defect we're gonna fix it with live
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.600]  viruses we inject into your body that go to your brain and with lithium and
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:06.120]  antipsychotic that's highly toxic Alan Watt is a longtime researcher and he
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:08.880]  really needs no introduction here on the show coming to the matrix comms his
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.840]  website Alan good to have you here my friend it's a pleasure to be back on
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:17.680]  again Alex Alan let's cut to the chase why I'm I know you scan the news and
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.560]  enemy transmissions why are they suddenly coming out and saying yeah we've
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:25.640]  been drugging you and we're gonna drug you more that's just a matter of
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:30.440]  training the public have been trained incrementally over the years up to this
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:35.160]  present condition and most people do accept the government is now an
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:39.080]  authority it's not really a matter of thinking through it it's a matter of
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:43.280]  just accepting your training you come to this there's a very vague conclusion
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:49.160]  that government is the boss basically we're not a sort of a public or a
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:53.560]  democracy it's a matter of training the public and that's the big boys said they
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:58.400]  do 50 years ago 60 years ago they would train us to accept a form of
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:04.280]  scientific dictatorship a world ruled by experts better people than we are and
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:10.800]  unfortunately it works no other people they do accept the government is now an
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:15.520]  authority that's what it is it's an authority is the authority and we're
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:20.440]  supposed to simply obey whatever they do because they know better that's that's
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:26.960]  the end of slavery when you accept that type of rulership that's it well I mean
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:32.280]  to openly now admit they naked-body scan us and save every scan to openly
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:35.720]  admit they're putting poison in the water now they admit by Sphinol is
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:41.600]  sterilizing us and the news giggles and says maybe that's good and maybe being
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:45.400]  injected and having your emotions taken away literally having your life ended

[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:06.920]  the street from Camp Swift and shooting some establishing shots and I was far
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:10.440]  away from Aaron I was over on another part of it shooting stuff and I saw a
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:13.760]  car pull up and I turned the camera over the guy's talking to Aaron asking him
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:19.280]  question and so I've been shooting whatever shooting then I walk up and the
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:23.080]  guy was you know repeating the question then you know Aaron is under no
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:26.600]  obligation to answer his questions that he was asking so Aaron didn't answer
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:30.920]  and I they asked me and I said we're shooting establishing shots for a TV
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:33.360]  show he said who do you work for and I said I don't think I have to answer that
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.240]  and he said okay fine they're not answering the question he was talking on
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:41.760]  his he told me to come around that was running video at the time and then he was
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:45.200]  going around I guess making a report shooting the license plate of the car
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:50.560]  we were in and you know guys give me the number hold on give me the number look
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:54.680]  up the number to Camp Swift I'll call them it's Alex Jones and Jesse Ventura

[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:28.080]  terror alert and said you were trying to blow the base up and that ended up
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:32.880]  making the news we had all the videos in police state for the rise of FEMA all
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:38.920]  you politely walked up and then you politely left and then they lied and
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:42.320]  filed false reports of the police that you were trying to run a terror attack on
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:45.960]  them this is and then we see in the news where they arrest women anybody that
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:49.440]  tries to even ask questions about the camps in America you get arrested for
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:52.520]  this because we're landed the cowards home of the slaves and we're going back
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:56.360]  to historical marker Alex I mean it's a it's a public place there's a sign right
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:59.520]  here says historical marker and it's pointing to the thing but you put your
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:03.520]  camera on it and you know you they ask you a bunch of questions like you're a
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:05.840]  criminal and now I'm afraid if we leave if we drive down the road we're gonna get
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:09.120]  pulled over by a sheriff and who'd you know I don't want to get and be in that
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:12.720]  kind of and then they'll claim then they'll claim you tried to do something

[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:44.360]  suspicious people were filming at the thing as in front of the camp and so he
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:47.720]  responded to that and I said okay and then he wanted to know I guess he ran

[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.920]  I guess we're just gonna we're gonna pack up the cameras and go because we got
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:09.640]  all the shots we well well here's the deal they're the ones that are
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:13.760]  suspicious running around with the military in America trying to boss
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:17.640]  Americans around and teach us to lick their boots they're the ones that are
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:20.840]  suspiciously working for a government that's stolen tens of trillions of
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:24.360]  dollars and it's flushing this country down the toilet they're the ones putting
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:27.800]  in naked body scanners they're the ones that are suspicious it's all about this
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:32.080]  moral high ground where we're the bad suspects and we're the bad people and
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:35.240]  we have their internal documents it was never about men wearing turbans it's
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:39.120]  about the American people being their enemies Rob can I talk to Aaron I want
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:41.320]  to get a report from Aaron and we're going back to Ellen what
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:45.360]  all right here he is good job dude thank you that was definitely dude's phone has
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:49.840]  bad cell reception there that was the problem Aaron break down what happened
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:55.160]  well they approached us after I would say about five minutes filming wanted to
[02:05:55.160 --> 02:06:01.440]  know why I was told he was concerned about terrorism asked him to repeat that
[02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:04.720]  he says well ask him about the Pentagon carrying out the attacks on themselves
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:08.240]  or Operation Northwoods if he's concerned about terrorism he needs to go
[02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:13.560]  study who he works for yeah he he also engaged me to talk to him I asked him if
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:16.760]  he had sworn a note to protect the Constitution including the First
[02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:20.360]  Amendment under which we're operating he didn't answer all he did not want to
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:24.560]  talk about the Constitution but he didn't talk about terrorism I know the
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:29.880]  sheriff also said he was concerned in these times what could happen basically
[02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:33.760]  alluding to terrorism in the post 9-11 world as well yeah their bosses stage
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:38.840]  and terror attacks it is a big concern so we know we're in an atmosphere where
[02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:43.720]  it's the homeland and the people who are the enemy now and journalism and
[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:48.760]  journalists are pretty much on the front line of that Alex now here's the deal I
[02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:53.600]  don't that's only one part of Swift they've got other fenced in areas so I
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:57.040]  want you to continue don't let them run you off they want to teach you that
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:00.640]  you're there to take vaccines drink sodium fluoride and lithium and lick
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:04.200]  government boots you know you were literally a blood bag to them and you
[02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:07.920]  let them know you're not a blood bag you let them know that you're there and
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:10.920]  you're the boss and I wish I could have talked to him I know you stood up to him
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:13.480]  it was just very frustrating because I couldn't hear what was going on because
[02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:17.800]  Deuce foam was cutting out but I wanted to tell that cop hey first amendment I
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:22.000]  don't have any warrants out for your stinking system get out of my face get
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:27.920]  out of my face get out of my face me and my children go ahead no Aaron go ahead
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:31.320]  you you tell us what else happened in your take on this well they were
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:36.480]  obviously concerned allegedly under the pretense of terrorism but I suppose they
[02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:40.040]  were not as concerned after talking to us just because they asked us a few
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:44.160]  questions and they're now leaving as I could see them both driving away both
[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:50.120]  the sheriff and the National Guard individual and only just now is anyone
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:53.960]  from the business we're at concerned about what we're doing so it wasn't a
[02:07:53.960 --> 02:07:58.480]  situation where private property owners asked us to leave now now the citizens
[02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:02.600]  are teaming in to run off the journalist they're showing you an
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:06.800]  American trying to be in a small town on the side of the road we're gonna show
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:12.480]  you boy ladies and gentlemen if you just joined us we skipped that break some
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:18.600]  stations may have taken it they sent the police at my guys they have sent the
[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:24.680]  the army captain out to ask basically if they were terrorist and now I guess
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:28.760]  you're not allowed to park on the side of the road somebody else is helping the
[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:34.120]  Stasi system telling you to move along and get away from that property yeah
[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:37.880]  and we're right now being talked to by the gas station owner is concerned only
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:42.920]  because the police came over but you know yeah they basically tried to run us
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:46.920]  off but we didn't go we were also told about how this whole area used to be a
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:51.480]  concentration POW camp during the war many of the homeowners are living on
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:56.440]  areas that used to be part of the camp all right here's the deal and we'll just
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:00.720]  go ahead and give them a heads up you were there four years ago for in-game
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:04.800]  blueprint for global enslavement up at the Taylor facility and even when you
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:08.120]  were 300 yards away they tried to come over and say you couldn't videotape the
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:16.160]  facility where entire families are held and under Rex 84 under Rex 84 they have
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:20.160]  programs and plans to first put the illegals in them and then the American
[02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:24.680]  people you're now going out there I want you guys to get in the car to leave go
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:27.400]  there then come back where you're at later if you didn't get shots of
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:31.720]  everything because the show is going to be over soon I need to be live on air
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:38.000]  for you guys but give folks the location there of course they'll obviously know
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.520]  you're coming they'll still say you're terrorist because I'm a radio host and
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:47.280]  anybody who has a radio show must be you must be a criminal oh sorry Alex we
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:51.760]  have some car discussion I'm pulling up the address for Taylor right now it is
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:59.440]  1001 Welch Street Taylor Texas I've been over four I know it's the Hutto
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:05.520]  detention facility it's in a remote part of that very small town but T. Don Hutto
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:09.640]  prison corrections corporations of America so it's a private corporation
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:14.520]  holding immigrants for Homeland Security and we've seen ice vehicles and we've
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:19.160]  seen Homeland Security vans there so that's what's going on Alex and we know
[02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:23.120]  when we got the video of the kids in the playground whole families and they
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:26.840]  admit it's dual use according to the Houston Chronicle for the American
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:31.680]  people during emergencies so what I want you to do is I want you to go there
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:35.720]  then I want you to go to Robert Mueller Airport where they've got the the pier
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:40.680]  57 type locked down in that hangar and see what happens there as well good job
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:46.520]  Aaron before that business owner says that you're with space aliens go ahead
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:51.240]  and leave okay yeah we're out of there we are on our way to Taylor Texas right
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:55.720]  now so people want to join us that's where we'll be all right well done here
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:59.800]  come evil Americans trying to show the FEMA camps and we'll see what happens
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:03.200]  and land the free home of the brave Alan want I apologize to you for this
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:07.800]  happening live but I think the their phones getting blown off the hook made
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:11.240]  them back off my guys but this is just another example of the freedom we live
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:15.240]  under isn't it Alan yes and it's happening in other countries at the same
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:20.040]  time I've watched videos from Britain for women have walked across hills and
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:24.200]  been stopped again under the same terrorism anti-terrorism act even though
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:28.720]  there's no warning signs that she's in their near camps or anything and in
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:32.880]  fact you get an approach by the military and the police at the same time so
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:37.760]  they're using this anti-terrorism law worldwide that's where it goes under for
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:42.240]  anybody who's inquisitive as to what's happening in a particular area even if
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:45.880]  they're innocent as I say they're simply on a hike and come across something
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:51.480]  that they're often detained questioned and maybe let go yeah and all of the
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:54.760]  training is for the American people the British people the Canadian people
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:59.720]  that's only a smokescreen about quote Muslims and of course remember the lady
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:03.040]  in upstate New York who heard that it was a big FEMA camp which it is
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:06.600]  designated as an emergency center under the Emergency Centers Act and they
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:10.200]  just arrested her and they said we're charging her with terror it was an
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:15.160]  American Glenn Beck Alex Jones listener and you know no no no you don't do that
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:19.080]  in America you are the enemy and they are chomping at the bit to throw our
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:22.640]  people in prisons I mean you're an uppity slave who dares to ask them
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:27.800]  questions or video police you're going to prison yes this is the new
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:30.840]  authoritarian system and the sudden the writings that would have to be a
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:35.600]  authoritarian and that's what the century of change is all about and as you
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:40.240]  say they kicked it off with 9-11 just to get it all through and to train the
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:44.520]  public worldwide that this is the new authoritarian system any idea of rights
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:49.360]  or freedoms or democracy as to go out the window they've said that openly and
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:53.600]  their writings at the from the very top so this is the new system by the way
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:57.080]  they've also got a lot of new private prisons they've already built in
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:02.080]  Canada they're owned by some companies in the US that they're only up to 10%
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:06.280]  capacity they're not taking anybody else in at the moment these are very high
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:10.520]  tech prisons by the way on a circular basis for sole cameras they can see
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:15.520]  around all the cells at all the time an optagon that's right and and so they're
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:20.600]  sitting idle waiting as well in Ontario the Grand Bend River is a big army
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:24.440]  facility there since World War II is well stacked already with beds and so on
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:28.000]  for people getting moved into it as well so they're all over the place right now
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.520]  and they're all stocked up just waiting and by the way when I was telling the
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:35.560]  guys where to go you've got the admitted FEMA center with whole families you got
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:41.400]  Swift that's designated as an emergency FEMA camp admittedly on record model
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:45.440]  state's health emergency powers act and of course some of the other acts the
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:49.120]  emergency centers act which hasn't passed yet but everything in it is already in
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:54.120]  place they always do it that way and kind of like we had national ID cards in
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:57.040]  94 under executive order they just now announced them two years ago to the
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:00.320]  slave grid still has the state seal on it but it's a federal slash
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:05.840]  international call the guys I want them to go to Lakeline mall that shut down
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:11.520]  and we we got we have video this a year ago and FEMA has taken over half of the
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:15.680]  old mega mall and they have Homeland Security buses and if you even try to
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:20.240]  videotape them all police and FEMA boil out and get in your face so there's just
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:25.480]  FEMA camps everywhere FEMA burrowing in but but let's get back to the medical
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:30.280]  lobotomies they've come out of course in the last decade announced all
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:34.680]  of these new types of vaccines that go in with live viruses either create viral
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:38.960]  plaques to plug up receptor sites for anger and aggression and resistance and
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:44.680]  freedom or they actually eat that is replicate and destroy the receptor
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:49.760]  sites or they cause even more deadly autoimmune responses that block these
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:53.760]  regular steroids is the main thing they're trying to block naturally
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:15:00.720]  occurring the estrogens the testosterone in the brain and that's admitted and so
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:05.240]  there's an autoimmune response which causes chronic brain swelling which is
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:08.760]  of course Alzheimer's that's where you're getting people 25 getting it and
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:14.080]  then so it causes continual brain swelling and they're announcing they
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:17.920]  plan to start injecting people Alan then after we have the shot will feel much
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:23.000]  better Alan that's right and remember to what's happening today is 90 years
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.400]  behind the times because Huxley wrote about that in Brave New World how do
[02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:32.160]  you think you get them from one type of society to a nice placid genetically
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:37.360]  altered and created society you must take them down gradually and Britain in the
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:41.920]  1930s remember was the first country that was teaching at Sandhurst the aspect
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:47.120]  of total war where whole populations are the enemy that includes your own
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:52.400]  population during a full-scale all-out war this is full-scale world war and
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:57.240]  we are all the targets and we must be brought down until we cannot use our
[02:15:57.240 --> 02:16:03.000]  critical thinking faculties anymore back in the 60s remember Arthur Kessler who
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.480]  worked with MI5 who was a propagandist for international he was a trots guy too
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:11.600]  they had lots of those guys to write novels and books and so on he also took
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:17.120]  part in a natural survey and they're doing for the United Nations to find ways
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:21.840]  to robotomize the general public through chemical means through water the food
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:26.720]  supply injections in order to bring about what they call the world peace
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:32.120]  world peace is absence of all opposition and that's what's happening today as I
[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:35.840]  say we're way behind the times a lot of people it's already happened as you well
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:39.960]  know you can't get through to the ones who have already had their ability for
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:44.120]  self-preservation destroyed and Kessler said that we can destroy that
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:49.480]  particular part in the brain very precisely that makes you an individual
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:55.440]  you and he said that that's what we call the ghost in the machine that was you
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:17:00.560]  your personality with your innate ability for self-preservation it says
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:07.040]  that will be destroyed through chemical or injections food and water to to
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:11.680]  bring about world peace he said the public won't need to make decisions
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:15.160]  because the state will make other decisions for them and they call this
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:20.040]  full spectrum dominance and most the public has succumbed to the chemicals
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:24.280]  in the water and now they're going straight to the endgame of an injection
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:28.200]  that turns you into a biological android and the cops are going to hold
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:31.760]  everybody down they're going to do it themselves and they just want to lose
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:36.040]  their soul their body they love it they love it because they feel that petty
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:41.880]  power trip of submitting and so good your family your whole family line they
[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:46.040]  plan to neutralize us psychologically before they just release mega plagues
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:50.760]  and actually kill you and so I know I'm the enemy the cops and military you want
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:55.760]  to die the bureaucrats you want to die you love it you love it you love it you
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:00.120]  just love it and we're a hundred percent accurate it's all on record and now
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:03.920]  they're announcing they're coming to inject us with literal brain-eating
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:07.800]  vaccines and they're trying to force inoculations everywhere they're taking
[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:12.680]  people's kids that won't take them with the quote flu shot and they admit ten
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:18.640]  fold in brain damage gion beret in convulsions it's all admitted the
[02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:22.800]  Gardasil's killing people and they love it the cops love shooting their kids up
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:25.880]  and watching them die the school teachers love shooting them up watching
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:30.000]  them die and why do they love the death and the kids all over the block dying of
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:35.040]  cancer why do they love it so much Alan well they are steele masochistic see
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:39.800]  totalitarian societies run on sedo masochism with an intelligentsia at the
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:43.640]  top who literally go by a completely different set of moral rules and
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:46.560]  principles than anyone else and to get off with it too because they're so
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:51.160]  incredibly wealthy however all their generals and all the way down respect the
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:55.080]  guy above them who's got more power than themselves and he despised the person
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:59.080]  beneath them who's got less power so the sedo masochistic system masochistic
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:04.040]  system it came out during the Nuremberg trials we saw the generals and all the
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:07.560]  different officers behind Hitler still praising him as though he were a god
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:11.960]  literally and the same thing happened with Stalin of course when he died all
[02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:15.440]  the people came forward and the officers themselves who knew that they were
[02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:20.000]  slated for death next if he had lived they were still praising Stalin as though
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.600]  he was some kind of god so sedo masochistic are attracted to power they
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:29.080]  will literally deify the person with more power that's what they're after they
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:32.920]  deify the ones with it with it and they despise those with less those at the
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:38.160]  bottom with no power literally they're utterly cruel and ruthless with that's
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:41.960]  right that army captain and that's sheriff's deputy they he they looked at
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:46.600]  money these were citizens these were piles of garbage these were filth these
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:52.000]  were blood bags to serve them how dare you in america videotape anything I'll

[02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:18.680]  matrix.com's website our sites are info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv we're
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:22.720]  launching a major information warfare salvo today I'll tell you about that
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:26.040]  coming up the middle of the next segment I need your help we're all in this
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:30.600]  together ladies and gentlemen I get agitated and upset because I haven't
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:34.400]  had minor irons destroyed and I've been reading a lot of globalist documents in
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:36.960]  fact some of which I just read in the last few days Alan you have noticed you
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:40.640]  talked about this years ago that a lot of globalist documents bemoan the fact
[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:45.200]  that lithium and fluoride in the water doesn't seem to work on some people and
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:49.680]  actually makes them more angry then I noticed the movie Serenity throws it in
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:54.040]  your face and I even saw an interview with a director talking about it he's
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:58.080]  anti-New World Order and was a great movie but they take a whole planet in
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:02.600]  the future and put in the atmosphere Prozac or Prozac drug but it ends up
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:05.800]  killing most people they become so passive like the shrimp that are
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:10.960]  ingesting Prozac now in the news that just give up and die but others become
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:18.400]  more aggressive and I mean I'm seeing that do you have any take on that that's
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:21.560]  true to the extent of a lot of drugs you'll find that some people who can't
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:26.560]  even take an aspirin for headache I'll actually make the headache worse
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:32.440]  others can take painkillers even higher-grade painkillers that intensify
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:36.880]  the pain so some people do react in an opposite way with certain medications
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:41.320]  however what you're finding as well is that a lot of see that the whole thing
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:44.640]  starts when you're you're young they talked about this back in the 20s how
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:50.280]  could you literally alter the chemistry of the brain and the chemistry of the
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:54.920]  person if you wanted a world of peace and they talked about denoculations with
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:58.480]  the best ways to do it and it could target specific
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:03.760]  injections diet injections injunctions Bertrand Russell right yes and and also
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:07.720]  and even before he came along with that too and said that openly there were
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:12.280]  others who talked about that as far back as as George Bernard Shaw on about
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:18.080]  1918 so he would belong to the Fabian Society that belongs to the Royal
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:21.560]  Institute of International Affairs or Council of Foreign Relations so this is
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:25.800]  an old-old agenda and what they've found too since then is that with your
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:31.200]  first inoculations that a child is that they're supposed to piggyback on certain
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:36.640]  enzymes that they go to the brain and it's interesting you see that every cell
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:40.080]  in the brain every type of tissue in your body vibrates that particular
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:43.760]  frequency a very small electrical frequency not a large one very small
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:48.120]  that's electrochemical electrochemical and therefore the nutrients for that
[02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:52.800]  particular part of the brain will will vibrate at the same rate as the tissue
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:56.760]  is where it wants to go to or the tissue wants it to come to and that's how it
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:00.400]  finds the tissue with a particular and that's what they're saying with all
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:04.720]  these new vaccines it will literally block you being able to become upset or
[02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:08.400]  resist and suddenly it's all over the news they're now moving against this
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:13.520]  publicly yes along with the fact that they could to take up the nutrients to
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:17.960]  different parts of the brain they knew they could piggyback the chemicals or
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:21.600]  even a virus on no that's what they say they say they're piggybacking the
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:27.560]  steroid on the back of a live with this particular one in the news this week
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:31.880]  with a live herpes virus to take it right into the brain and hit you hard
[02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:36.120]  that's right and therefore they could lobotomize different parts of the brain
[02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:40.480]  that makes you not much aggressive new if you're aggressive you can be
[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:44.600]  aggressive for a very good reason and that means surviving and all of these
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:48.920]  characters from the Fabian Society in Long before talked about the fact that
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:53.360]  some the world did bring in who had one obstacle and that was a general public
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:58.040]  how do we lobotomize the public to make them passive and obedient and there's
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:01.640]  no doubt from studying all the last major vaccines interrupt I want you to
[02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:06.040]  comment on this that they're adding these piggybackers into the vaccines for
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:09.640]  at least the last 30 years they've already hit the public that's why they're
[02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:13.840]  zombies most people out there are already brain damage that's why we can't
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:17.560]  reach them yeah they can't understand it's not they don't want to understand
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:21.920]  they can't understand and those parts that we should kick in with with the
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:26.960]  anxiety and a little bit of fear leading to decisive action are gone
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:31.800]  however the thing is some people sneak through just like the as I say the the
[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:36.720]  the medications often have the opposite effect some people they'll find that
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:40.920]  because their physiology is slightly different those enzymes that uptake to
[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:44.680]  the brain can be diverted to other parts of the body often into the
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:49.880]  intestines and they'll find people for instance with lots of allergies well
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:54.280]  no they now admit Crohn's is a measles vaccine that's why you have all these
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:58.000]  new diseases it ends it up attacking with an autoimmune response in the
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:02.880]  intestines and that's almost killed one of my great employees who got very
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:07.800]  close to dying from Crohn's and they know exactly what they're doing they
[02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:12.440]  don't what caused that for over 50 or 60 years at the top levels see there's
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:16.080]  different levels of medicine whatever's in the Lancet journals where all the
[02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:19.640]  doctors believe that was taught in university but in the higher levels of
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:23.960]  medicine it's part of the military industrial complex because warfare takes
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:29.440]  in medicine in a big way for bringing down populations long term so they've
[02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:33.440]  known this for 50 years what they were doing incredible longer stay there Alan
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:36.720]  finish up on the other side riveting and everything Alan is saying is in all
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:41.120]  their own literature for for banking for government they have super advanced
[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:44.800]  schools that once you become a general or once you become a governor they then
[02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:49.440]  send you to the advanced Woodrow Wilson school or others to be really taught the
[02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:56.360]  secret plan we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:56.360 --> 02:30:03.560]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:07.760]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:12.080]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:15.880]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:19.520]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:24.080]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:28.120]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:31.920]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:30:31.920 --> 02:30:35.520]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:39.840]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:42.960]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:38.840]  brain damaged now we're launching a key operation we're going Alan Watt in two
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:44.520]  minutes poison tap water we've had seven terms in a row we've never failed
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:48.720]  thanks to you the listeners making whatever term we put out the number one
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:53.080]  search term then it leads them back to our articles in our battle plan of
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:58.400]  action two days ago was brain-eating vaccine it caused over a hundred blogs
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:03.080]  and newspapers like wired magazine to go absolutely ape even news of the world
[02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:06.600]  tried to spin it to make it look like this info that's one of your big
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:11.680]  tabloids on store shelves it is not working we are countering them the new
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:18.680]  search term is poison tap water it's at info wars.com by Matt Ryan what Paul
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:23.240]  Watson's gonna expand this article with even more documentation because again I
[02:34:23.240 --> 02:34:29.480]  have these ideas live on air during the live battle space and that's what this
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:33.320]  is this is total resistance for the species to survive against the
[02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:37.520]  scientific technocracy this is not a game that you're living in a hardcore
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:42.520]  science fiction nightmare but humanity is rising and for all you want to make
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:46.400]  jokes about it you're already casualties enjoy it if you can't see pure
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:49.400]  tyranny when they're out in the open now saying they're going to put lithium in
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:52.320]  the water to control you when they're already doing it then fine enjoy
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:58.360]  yourselves they admit corn syrup they knew increased cancer massively and now
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:01.320]  more medical journals admit it and they don't care they're gonna hit you hard
[02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:06.680]  aspartame bisphenol a sterilization cancer and it lowers aggression
[02:35:06.680 --> 02:35:11.240]  everything they do in standardization and products you eat and drink and the
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:18.200]  packaging is meant to sterilize and this is key and reduce your aggression it's
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:22.400]  aggression that fires the resistance that fires determination as Alan Watts
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:27.240]  said here's the article Alex Jones is launching a new campaign to inform the
[02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:30.360]  public about the toxic chemical fluoride being added to the water across the
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:34.200]  country while EPA scientists and workers are calling for an end to water
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:37.480]  fluoridation we have a link to their top scientists coming out and saying it's
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:40.880]  deadly the government is doing everything in its power to continue and even
[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:43.760]  increase the amount of toxic chemicals being added to the public water
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:50.680]  supplies click here for the PDF of this of this yellow and white and black
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:55.240]  document there is poison in the tap water that'll get locals attention posted
[02:35:55.240 --> 02:36:01.640]  in legal areas and it goes on in the piece to say fact fluoride is a dangerous
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:07.400]  substance and the active ingredient in most insecticides if ingested as little
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:14.040]  as one tenth of an ounce of fluoride can kill a hundred pound adult and one in
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:17.920]  one hundred of an ounce can kill a ten pound infant studies have shown that
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:21.880]  exposure to fluoride can cause neurological damage and an increased
[02:36:21.880 --> 02:36:25.840]  risk of bone cancer fiction fluoride out of the public water supply strings
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:29.600]  that's teeps and helps prevent cavities demand safe water demand the truth
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:35.200]  visit info wars dot com there is poison in the tap water this is how a free
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:39.400]  humanity would resist they would go out and hit the enemy everywhere now the
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:42.440]  media is going to go absolutely ape over this if you post these everywhere
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:45.360]  they're going to try to demonize whoever did it in your area they're going to
[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:48.840]  demonize yours truly but then it's going to spur a public debate that this is
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:53.320]  poison and a lot of local media is now admitting it's poison because they're
[02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:58.520]  reading about the EPA scientists saying take it out so the key search term is
[02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:05.920]  poison tap water the key search term three words poison tap water get it out
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:09.800]  to everybody we're unstoppable together God bless you Alan I'm gonna try to sit
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:13.760]  back in the last 23 minutes and shut up and have you break down this and while
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:15.920]  you're talking about all the different poisons and things I'm gonna show
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:21.640]  mainstream news articles proposing drugs in our water to make a servile Alan
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:26.120]  Watt break it down yes when it's obvious if you want to take down a whole
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:30.200]  population and the whole world's populations you must literally attack
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:34.160]  the one enemy they have and that's your ability to survive because you have
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:39.280]  innate you're born with innate survival principles that powers intuition a
[02:37:39.280 --> 02:37:44.080]  reaction and your solution to the particular problem when they can knock
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:47.240]  out that part of the brain so that you're passive you don't even notice
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:51.760]  there's a threat in any direction then you then you're a happy citizen you're
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:57.280]  exactly what they want you to be and in fact I keep referring to wild animals
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:38:01.520]  just watching wild animals if I get foxes coming around here all the time
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:05.840]  and that's the tree down the fox you sit and watch from the top of the hill
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:09.920]  and he'll he'll you won't go past that tree something different in his roots
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:14.520]  his little circle and he'll observe it from 50 different angles before he
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:18.720]  decides it's safe or unsafe to go past it because he doesn't know it's a bluff
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:21.960]  there could be somebody behind there with a gun to shoot him who knows what it is
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:27.120]  but that's that's a neat survival instincts that you're born with those
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:31.200]  things and we're supposed to have that now the big boys themselves Charles
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:36.840]  Galton Darwin and all the rest of them in the 1950s descendant of Charles Darwin
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:41.040]  and he was a physicist this guy as well who worked on a Manhattan project he
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:47.480]  was a top eugenicist he was at all for world domination and he talked about the
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:51.560]  need to eradicate the useless eaters just like Bertrand Russell they all knew
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:56.640]  each other and he said we have to he says we must retain our capabilities to
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:01.520]  remain wild this is those who survive are wild men it says therefore we are
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:05.480]  leading at the planet earth with the captains of the ship we must retain those
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:10.840]  wild men capabilities but the rest of the public he said must literally have
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:15.240]  their ability destroyed to preserve themselves they would manage by the state
[02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:19.840]  of all echo the same principles and it's been happening all our lives long you
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:24.960]  just read a quote from one of these psychos mm-hmm yeah and that's right and
[02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:29.840]  they mean it and not only they mean it they worked for top world societies
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:34.080]  linked with the United Nations the United Nations is the front of course
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:37.920]  wherever they've gone with inoculations that's what they've done is to destroy
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:42.360]  especially the so-called primitive tribes of lived it but for thousands of
[02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:47.400]  years completely independent from from the rest of the world they've given
[02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:51.520]  inoculations is the first thing they do when we went into Iraq the first group
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:55.800]  of an in after the troops was UNESCO for inoculations to make sure the
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:59.880]  children got inoculations that will raise up a population who are easily
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:05.440]  managed and pliable now when you go into military strategy going as far back as
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:10.520]  was World War two they talked about prolonged warfare over populations
[02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:15.320]  prolonged that meant intergenerational warfare if something lasted 40 50 years
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:18.960]  because we've had 100 years wars in the past we forget these things these guys
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:24.000]  don't you're trained in this stuff they said they'd have to make sure that the
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:29.000]  upcoming future troops would have to be hit at either at birth pre-birth event
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:33.560]  inoculating the mother while the child's in the womb or getting the child very
[02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:37.240]  soon after birth with inoculations to make sure that he grows up and he will
[02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:41.680]  not be a fighter he won't mind being dominated or ruled this isn't these are
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:46.680]  in military manuals that the teacher the top military colleges so they've been
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:51.160]  doing this in Iraq of course and I'm sure in 20 30 years time you'll see the
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:55.520]  results of it with a dumbed-down happy population with hats on backwards
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:00.360]  dancing to rap music and taking drugs and all the rest of it but they will be
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:04.640]  unconcerned that they're dominated by foreign powers this is long-term
[02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:08.720]  strategy for the entire planet and as I say the ones at the top who formed the
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:13.160]  League of Nations and formed the United Nations that was their goal to bring
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:17.760]  about a world of peace pieces where those who should naturally rule the
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:22.720]  world are ruling the world and I mean naturally ruling it and they believe in
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:27.720]  a Darwin Darwin in principle that those who had achieved total success and
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:32.680]  held on to power and money through successive generations had proven by
[02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:36.400]  that they're running in principle of survival of the fittest that they had
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:40.640]  the right to rule everyone else who who hadn't achieved that particular level
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:46.040]  or a standard of living was there for a failure they were the junk genes and they
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:49.880]  would only reproduce junk genes and therefore that no need for them in a
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:56.920]  post-industrial society this stuff was discussed before World War one by by
[02:41:56.920 --> 02:42:00.160]  those who form eventually formed the League of Nations then the United
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:05.680]  Nations so this has been a long-term warfare we are seeing the effects of it
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:09.840]  and we see them going further they can go further now because most of the public
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:15.120]  to be honest with you cannot take any information critically anymore they are
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:19.480]  damaged too damaged to take it and the one hand is a double thing we think
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:24.080]  we're being managed and they're happy to be managed by superior people that's
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:28.280]  what they think of politicians and superior people and and on the other
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:31.520]  hand when you read the articles about how damaged they're becoming and what
[02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:35.640]  they want to do to them next they can't they're going to double think I love my
[02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:40.040]  government I love those special people so that I can who allow me to go out and
[02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:43.720]  play all the time well I don't have to make any big decisions and they wouldn't
[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:47.960]  do anything to hurt me surely and so that's how they react to articles that
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:51.080]  come out with the proof and the evidence to what's happening to them and their
[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:55.440]  children they wouldn't do anything to harm me they're too far gone to put two
[02:42:55.440 --> 02:42:59.240]  and two together they are out of the group they're running they're the
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:04.040]  casualties of war yeah well said Alan and while you've been talking I'm just
[02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:07.480]  showing New York Times LA Times how great it's gonna be to put lithium in
[02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:11.120]  your water how great it's gonna be to inject you you'll never be upset again
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:15.520]  this is literally destroying free will and you know the housewives and the
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:19.360]  soccer moms are gonna march their daughters and sons and and Jimmy's not
[02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:23.000]  gonna be bad anymore he's not gonna even be alive he'll just be a worker that
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:27.440]  does what they're told and it says the government's going to fix our
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:31.440]  malfunctioning brains to make us better workers we're not gonna get tired
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:34.600]  stress is meant to make you tired so you don't work to death you're not gonna
[02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:39.320]  complain we are literally biological androids and they're shooting all the
[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:43.240]  cops and military up with it and they're just gone they're gone you're right
[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:46.520]  with them with the cops in the military I mean you've read the same articles I'm
[02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:52.080]  sure from one of the chiefs of police officers who belongs to that the world
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:57.240]  the society of chief police officers under the UN and in the US and he said
[02:43:57.240 --> 02:44:02.600]  himself that he and his men were now on on testosterone implants under the skin
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:06.640]  they get them renewed every month or so and it makes them more aggressive they're
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:10.320]  not brighter that they're still been damaged mentally and again the Pentagon
[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:13.880]  talked about that in Wired magazine 10 years ago they said because we're
[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:17.600]  drugging the water to make people servile our troops are becoming wimps
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:22.320]  we're gonna have to supplement aggression drugs and testosterone and then
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:27.600]  later amnesics so they forget the mass murder and so now major police chiefs
[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:30.760]  like the police chief for the one you're mentioning is in Fort Worth that was
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:36.040]  three months ago said yeah we're gonna go on roids so they have to take drugs to
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:42.120]  re-masculize themselves because they've all been hit like the general public
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:45.880]  yes but they've all been hit but they have no wisdom therefore they're even
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:50.240]  more ruthless ones to get high doses of testosterone and so they're more lethal
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:54.040]  they're more aggressive and they have no wisdom they have no humanity actually
[02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:57.760]  left in them they're so dumb down so that yes they're aggressive but they
[02:44:57.760 --> 02:45:01.320]  don't have the wisdom or the compassion to balance the two as to the
[02:45:01.320 --> 02:45:05.400]  comparison job that they're supposed to be doing so they're very dangerous the
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:10.080]  great tools for them and remember to remember this is the thing that so many
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:15.280]  articles came out years ago saying the mind is the final frontier the
[02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:19.360]  conquering of the mind is the final frontier and that of course is what
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:23.480]  Kissinger and all the big boys were in he wrote about that to an extent little
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:27.520]  little hints here and there and his book between two ages in the technotronic
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:31.840]  era where he said that through ELF waves and various other things as I said
[02:45:31.840 --> 02:45:37.320]  remember all your cells are programmed by very tiny tiny electrical currents very
[02:45:37.320 --> 02:45:42.200]  tiny and they can match those electrical currents by using ELF waves and so on
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:47.040]  and that was in the Baltimore Sun about seven years ago and now DARPA admits oh
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:53.400]  we're now testing soothing ELF wave towers and so from us being kook saying
[02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:57.880]  it to we are drugging you we are gonna inject you there'll be no more pain after
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:02.240]  this and we are putting up towers to make you happy that's correct I mean how
[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:06.280]  and to show the public's under mind control they're announcing all of this
[02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:10.320]  and notice only the illegal aliens can march by the millions because they've
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:14.720]  been in Mexico and haven't been on these drugs as long so they're coming from a
[02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:19.040]  primitive society up here and then meanwhile Bloomberg announces all the
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:21.920]  major insurance companies are now taking people's insurance when they die and
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:25.840]  just saying we're doing it they're now just stealing everything because they
[02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:29.680]  know from your research what percentage of the public has already been pretty
[02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:38.800]  much lobotomized I'd have to say it's over 70 percent no please continue yeah
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:42.960]  I mean everyone really it isn't just the fact that you get one set of
[02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:46.760]  injections it's the follow-ups and what they can actually do and if admitted
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:51.040]  there's two in warfare at principles is they can release a chemical or something
[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:55.000]  into the bloodstream in any way they get it and food water or whatever spring it
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:47:00.560]  from the air which they're doing too and that can literally that can cocker
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:05.880]  it's like I'm just like cocking the trigger of a firearm that can cock the
[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:10.320]  body system ready for a booster shot years down the road and the booster
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:15.280]  literally kicks it off a binary weapon yes absolutely these are so far
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:20.120]  advanced in this technology and that is incredible and by the way for years
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:23.920]  Allen just like you all I do is read the research papers they're all bragging
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:29.600]  about it what do you make of Jonah Lear who's a Rhodes scholar and is an expert
[02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:33.800]  on psychology and neuroscience for wire the New Yorker all the major elite
[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:39.360]  publications he also works for MPR he's come out and called me a liar saying
[02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:42.760]  that they're proposing putting lithium in the water when his own colleagues
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:48.160]  including an Oxford are calling for Prozac drugs everything and then even
[02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:52.800]  though the video he critiques shows the mainstream news articles saying they're
[02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:57.640]  doing this and that these new virus vaccines go in and block aggression and
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:03.360]  anger and resistance he comes out and just says he's a kook and wrote a story
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:08.960]  saying that I'm basically into the end of the world in aliens I mean he he he's
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:14.600]  not addressing me he's not addressing I or you he he is addressing the zombies
[02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:19.200]  and he says no zombies there aren't space aliens when that's not and there's no
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:24.680]  lithium in the water so he mixes it together and you look at it and it's
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:28.960]  dumb down to like a four-year-old level and you go how do people buy this because
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:32.680]  because Russell explained that very very well he said that their techniques are
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:39.040]  creating the general population to only accept the opinion of experts and of
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:42.400]  course once you bring up these celebrities who are experts with a lot of
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:47.040]  letters behind their names you see from official world-recognized
[02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:50.680]  organizations that's how the public's been trained that's the word they'll
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:55.960]  take and unless you're up there with them with all those multi-letter numbers
[02:48:55.960 --> 02:48:59.160]  behind you they're not gonna listen they've already been trained that way
[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:03.160]  listening listening only to experts look at them the weather station when the
[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:06.320]  weather station first came out I thought what idiot wants to sit and watch the
[02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:11.000]  weather 24 hours a day it wasn't for that purpose because the first little rain
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:14.800]  that they had that was going to be a storm the same with the snow too is all
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:18.480]  everything was going to be a storm a crisis it was part of the getting
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:22.920]  ready for the weather modification stuff and so on and and the climate
[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:27.000]  change nonsense it was training the public for that but also through their
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:30.760]  the little ads that have always been a rain today then they show you someone
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:35.600]  wearing a raincoat and and and that they're teaching like a child that you
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:39.600]  can't make a decision on your own you must get an expert even to tell you how
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:43.800]  to dress that's why the news will say it's gonna rain today so take out an
[02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:49.000]  umbrella or it's hot out drink water and they talk and I've noticed like
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:54.200]  congressman Stark and others and Nancy Pelosi they talk to you like you're a
[02:49:54.200 --> 02:49:59.600]  child with neuro linguistic programming and they talk to you and then in town
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:03.160]  halls they'll make little giggles and like faces like my grandmother would
[02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:08.000]  make to me like little charming oh get in the car little boy but you know if
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:12.280]  it's not grandma it's these killers and they're all been trained with the Delphi
[02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:16.440]  technique they're just hardcore crooks they are crooks but I'll tell you
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:21.120]  nothing too there's a lot of people today as you well know who who'd listen to
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:25.320]  nothing but junk news from the regular media and the celebrities in the
[02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:29.800]  Hollywood know the rest of it who cannot think for themselves anymore they
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:33.680]  literally wait to be told what to think and what to talk about by the so-called
[02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:38.120]  experts even if it's junk junk Hollywood news when we come back final

[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:13.920]  want closing this out they they're moving towards some African countries have
[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:17.480]  lost over 40% of their population with engineered aides the globalist you're
[02:55:17.480 --> 02:55:20.720]  talking about they even said last week in the British papers it's time to stop
[02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:24.800]  mincing words we need to start getting rid of everybody I mean they're now
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:28.720]  coming out they're getting really ready for the hot kill weapons and so for the
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:32.280]  people out there that are laughing right now you know when they release these if
[02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:34.800]  we're unable to stop them just I want you at least while you're dying to know
[02:55:34.800 --> 02:55:38.400]  who killed you the news will be telling you al-qaeda did it but how long do you
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:41.880]  think they really start the mass plagues to they've just been testing the soft
[02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:45.640]  kills up until now they really want to devastate and kill a lot of people well
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:49.880]  they do and that was all part of the fake swine flu and other fluid
[02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:54.640]  davian flu before that to remember to the physical often to ours it is getting
[02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:58.480]  yeah it's getting as used to the idea that is definitely coming and that's
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:02.720]  what even the professors will tell their students in university the plague is just
[02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:08.240]  around the corner and and so they will release it when it's the right time when
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:13.280]  people are dumbed down enough to simply die off quietly and say oh well what could
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:17.520]  they do to try their best and and most folks actually unfortunately will go
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:22.720]  that way but it's coming there's no doubt about it is coming and number two I've
[02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:28.920]  gotten into bacterial and viral warfare in a big way over the years and in all
[02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:32.640]  the writings that they've disclosed to the public on these topics from the
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:37.120]  governments themselves they admit that for every plague that they create in the
[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:41.200]  laboratory and they've got thousands of them since World War two they had lots
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:45.320]  during World War two in fact they created in the lab they always must have
[02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:50.960]  by international law the antidote for them as well at every stage of mutation
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:56.280]  of virus or bacterium so they have them and the big rigs themselves of course
[02:56:56.280 --> 02:57:00.920]  will get a real inoculation that will prevent them from catching it and that's
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:04.080]  one of that's one of the incentives to get on board for those who are claiming
[02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:07.600]  the ladder of course is to get up there and to make sure that you and your
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:12.080]  family that's promised to your family will also be be preserved and looked
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:15.860]  after but it's all in the name of bringing down the population because we
[02:57:15.860 --> 02:57:20.920]  you see the useless eaters are now unsustainable we are using the resources
[02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:24.120]  they claim that will feed their families you know the right kind of people's
[02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:27.920]  families who should survive to feed them for thousands of years so they must
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:31.040]  get rid of us now that's what they're openly saying and you're quite right
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:35.360]  they are open to seeing it now they aren't hiding anything yeah well first
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:39.440]  they're gonna collapse the population give people inoculations for flu that
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:44.600]  have the the viruses that will destroy the resistance centers so what I mean
[02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:48.160]  if we don't back them off I mean they're already slaughtering people in mass in
[02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:51.080]  Latin America and Africa they've been admittedly caught over and over again
[02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:54.200]  what's the time frame Alan when they'll really start releasing Megadeth on
[02:57:54.200 --> 02:57:58.520]  people I'm sure you know like everything else that they do I'm sure 9-11 was
[02:57:58.520 --> 02:58:02.720]  planned probably 40 years before they hit it that's how they do things a long
[02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:06.600]  long-term business plan long the Northwoods was 40 years but about 30
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:10.720]  years before young yeah and and so they'll have a definite timetable don't
[02:58:10.720 --> 02:58:14.000]  know exactly when the public's ready to accept it I have done we are in the
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:19.320]  polls you constantly take and then they will release it but some again and not
[02:58:19.320 --> 02:58:23.360]  I've already got reports on the last flu injections and how many people have
[02:58:23.360 --> 02:58:27.800]  taken down with that alone with chronic fatigue syndrome I've gotten hundreds of
[02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:31.760]  emails and also see it in the news they inject the baby baby goes into a coma
[02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:35.440]  dies yeah and it's like that was wonderful we murdered another child
[02:58:35.440 --> 02:58:39.240]  we're the loving government Alan want great job thanks for joining us thank
[02:58:39.240 --> 02:59:06.800]  you Alan
