[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:33.360]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:33.360 --> 00:38.960]  well it's hard to believe it's already the eighth day of october 2015 i'm alex
[00:38.960 --> 00:41.840]  jones coming to you live for the next three hours from deep in the heart of
[00:41.840 --> 00:46.040]  texas austin with our amazing crew behind the scenes and of course you the
[00:46.040 --> 00:50.240]  listeners sponsors and the good lord above making it all possible this is
[00:50.240 --> 00:58.360]  going to be a incredibly jam-packed important broadcast today we have a lot
[00:58.360 --> 01:04.880]  of very important guests joining us we're going to have wane madson with
[01:04.880 --> 01:15.680]  huge news info wars dot com reporter on hillary clinton and the headline is a
[01:15.680 --> 01:19.120]  little weak compared to actually what the article breaks down because this is
[01:19.120 --> 01:22.960]  what our whistleblowers have told us it's what we have already basically
[01:22.960 --> 01:26.720]  gleaned from the evidence but he's got the graphs he's got the documents to
[01:26.720 --> 01:33.160]  show evidence points towards clinton running a parallel outsourced state
[01:33.160 --> 01:38.240]  department that's my headline his headline is evidence suggests yes
[01:38.240 --> 01:43.440]  evidence suggests that hitler combed his hair to the side evidence suggests that
[01:43.440 --> 01:47.920]  bill clinton's a liar evidence suggests that barack obama has raised the debt
[01:47.920 --> 01:54.240]  evidence suggests two plus two equals four evidence is conclusive hillary
[01:54.240 --> 01:58.720]  clinton ran a parallel outsourced state department clinton received help from
[01:58.720 --> 02:02.720]  george soros to run shadow government that's what soros does when he takes
[02:02.720 --> 02:06.240]  over countries is he has a shadow government set up first with the
[02:06.240 --> 02:11.880]  ministers and in the article wane madson has all the graphs showing how
[02:11.880 --> 02:15.920]  different corporations the hillary private group and the clinton foundation
[02:15.920 --> 02:20.080]  all meshed together and then she made the state department deals on weapons
[02:20.080 --> 02:26.600]  import export bans and more so it's an incredibly important article but I think
[02:26.600 --> 02:30.440]  we're going to change the headline I'm so busy I just do this live on air to
[02:30.440 --> 02:36.800]  evidence shows clinton ran a parallel outsourced state department because
[02:36.800 --> 02:42.000]  that's what she was doing that's what we basically said that madson digs in to
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.480]  the beaten potatoes he will be joining us coming up to take your phone calls as
[02:47.480 --> 02:51.640]  well david night will be hosting the fourth hour today of overdrive slash
[02:51.640 --> 02:56.560]  wrap-up slash breaking news and then we've got larry nickles who was supposed
[02:56.560 --> 03:00.640]  to be on the day drugs showed up but I knew he was in the hospital he had a
[03:00.640 --> 03:04.440]  collapsed lung he's battling cancer I'm not supposed to get into the details so
[03:04.440 --> 03:10.240]  I won't but I hope he's long for this world but in his words he may not be and
[03:10.240 --> 03:14.280]  I'll let him share that with you but a consummate clinton insider to give us
[03:14.280 --> 03:19.520]  the latest on what he expects these crooks to pull Hilary has done a big flip
[03:19.520 --> 03:25.440]  flop and says she will now oppose obama trade that's like Joseph Stalin
[03:25.440 --> 03:31.240]  opposing Stalinism the clinton's and strobe Talbot their secretary of state
[03:31.240 --> 03:35.760]  and all the rest of them this is their religion they're transferring power to
[03:35.760 --> 03:42.720]  multinational governments that they will then run that's what they do and so this
[03:42.720 --> 03:45.080]  is like
[03:45.920 --> 03:52.040]  Superman saying he hates Clark Kent or be alzy Bob saying he's and doesn't know
[03:52.040 --> 03:57.400]  the devil or satan saying he doesn't know the old serpent or McDonald's
[03:57.400 --> 04:02.840]  saying they don't know the golden arches I mean it is just the most flagrant 110
[04:02.840 --> 04:09.680]  percent twisted reality on its head that it would make a wooden indian cry
[04:09.680 --> 04:16.080]  laugh and roll over having a heart attack so that's all coming up green
[04:16.080 --> 04:20.280]  wall says Obama cannot simply apologize for committing war crimes as he's
[04:20.280 --> 04:25.160]  completely lacks all credibility Syria backed by Russian jets launches
[04:25.160 --> 04:28.960]  ground assault against rebels will give you details of that evidence suggests
[04:28.960 --> 04:32.000]  again when I mentioned Clinton ran a parallel outsourced state department
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.600]  will tie that back into that new news on the TPP New Zealand government admits it
[04:36.600 --> 04:41.880]  does in free speech basically but says they still support it also China dumps
[04:41.880 --> 04:47.960]  another 43 billion of reserves in September so to other big banks Politico
[04:47.960 --> 04:52.840]  says Democrats ready sweeping new gun restriction bills and the Supreme Court
[04:52.840 --> 04:58.160]  rules forced inoculations are coming our way stay with us it's an important

[08:09.960 --> 08:17.320]  and men with guns will be on their way because while the junction may be used
[08:17.320 --> 08:23.020]  lieu of conversation words will always retain their power words are for the
[08:23.020 --> 08:31.440]  means to meaning and for those who will listen there is something terribly wrong
[08:31.440 --> 08:35.440]  with this country isn't that you decided sir you wanted it for proof you told me
[08:35.440 --> 08:40.840]  every television in London cruelty and intolerance and depression and where
[08:40.840 --> 08:45.280]  once you have the freedom to object and speak as you saw fit you now have
[08:45.280 --> 08:49.800]  sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and something
[08:49.800 --> 08:55.320]  your submachine cameras how did this happen who's to blame or certainly there
[08:55.320 --> 08:59.760]  are those who are more responsible than others they will be held accountable but
[08:59.760 --> 09:04.640]  again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a
[09:04.640 --> 09:12.080]  mirror I know why you did it I know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror
[09:12.080 --> 09:18.160]  disease there were a myriad of problems inspired to corrupt your reason and rob
[09:18.160 --> 09:23.120]  you of your common sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you turn
[09:23.120 --> 09:28.240]  to the now high chancellor Adam Sattler he promised you order he promised you
[09:28.240 --> 09:34.520]  peace and all he demanded in return was your silent to obedient consent
[09:38.600 --> 09:45.440]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the
[09:45.440 --> 09:53.440]  time to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info war
[09:56.920 --> 10:01.520]  there's so much going on in the world Obama now is talking about well
[10:01.520 --> 10:04.800]  Australia had a good plan we may have to do that that's clearly talking about
[10:04.800 --> 10:09.720]  gun confiscation now Hillary's doing it CNN's has pundits just saying let's just
[10:09.720 --> 10:13.400]  take them do these people realize that this is the line in the sand at the
[10:13.400 --> 10:17.640]  LMO if they really come out in the frontal assault on guns it means I think
[10:17.640 --> 10:22.040]  they're trying to start a civil war it just seems like insanity I mean they
[10:22.040 --> 10:26.320]  may think that they're Stalin or something well because they're all
[10:26.320 --> 10:31.640]  armed themselves or they all have that security around them themselves they
[10:31.640 --> 10:36.200]  don't have to worry about I challenge Hillary take away your secret service
[10:36.200 --> 10:42.400]  take it away now take away your secret service dismiss them have no security
[10:42.400 --> 10:47.920]  around you have no guns around you Hillary I dare you I dare you Obama same
[10:47.920 --> 10:54.280]  thing drop your guns Obama take your secret service away Obama take it all
[10:54.280 --> 10:58.320]  away leave the White House unguarded Obama let everybody know there's no
[10:58.320 --> 11:02.200]  guns on the White House grounds Obama you know what would happen in 30 seconds
[11:02.200 --> 11:07.960]  both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth so they're asking us to
[11:07.960 --> 11:14.200]  drop our guns and to drop our security measures or or what so this thing is
[11:14.200 --> 11:18.580]  very real and I don't see how it's being taken seriously except for the sick
[11:18.580 --> 11:22.600]  voter you can't underestimate the sickness of the American people right
[11:22.600 --> 11:26.960]  now they're really sick and that's to me I'm more angry at the sick Americans
[11:26.960 --> 11:32.640]  than I am at Obama or Hillary I'm really angry at the sick Americans
[11:32.640 --> 11:38.080]  let's play one more clip from two days ago we never got to this one Matt Drudge on Hollywood
[11:38.080 --> 11:42.960]  then we'll get back to the kickoff of this live Thursday the eighth day of
[11:42.960 --> 11:48.640]  October 2015 transmission make some of this films it just blows away if Stanley
[11:48.640 --> 11:52.680]  Kubrick was alive can you imagine can you imagine where he would have gone he
[11:52.680 --> 11:56.440]  would have done some great work oh we're missing the Hollywood push too where's
[11:56.440 --> 11:59.000]  the greatness coming out of Hollywood they want it dumbed down I've talked to
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.160]  top enough of the Martian crap tell us something was telling something big and
[12:03.160 --> 12:07.160]  real and profound as Kubrick would have on a human level on a human level well
[12:07.160 --> 12:10.160]  I'm not allowed to say what I was told about Kubrick but let me say it was
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.520]  obvious from his films he would he was be on board with us he was Spielberg
[12:14.520 --> 12:19.400]  keeps going back to World War two I mean enough already let's let's get
[12:19.400 --> 12:23.320]  focused I look at a PT Anderson and I don't know it's kind of gone into a
[12:23.320 --> 12:27.120]  marijuana cloud for me where are the artists who are challenging this
[12:27.120 --> 12:31.920]  generation like Kubrick did so that's another topic separately
[12:32.440 --> 12:36.840]  the reason I kicked off the official broadcast today with two of those drudge
[12:36.840 --> 12:40.200]  clips from an historic 45 minute interview that's made international
[12:40.200 --> 12:44.840]  headlines the last two days is because it was so important and because the fact
[12:44.840 --> 12:49.240]  that Obama has all the secret service protection and Michael Moore has all
[12:49.240 --> 12:54.040]  these private armed bodyguards and Pierce Morgan has armed defense that's the
[12:54.040 --> 12:58.600]  name of the company that parks out front of his house in an armored van with
[12:58.600 --> 13:05.840]  guns 24 hours a day but he has the nerve to say your guns should be taken from
[13:05.840 --> 13:13.240]  you it is just disgusting and I know that as libertarians as patriots as
[13:13.240 --> 13:19.480]  conservative as common sense rugged individualist who live in reality with
[13:19.480 --> 13:26.000]  both feet on the ground and your heads screwed on straight that you know more
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.360]  guns in the hands of good people means less crime that you know Chicago New
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.080]  York and DC with their gun restrictions have the highest crime rates in the
[13:34.080 --> 13:40.680]  country that you understand that but the general yuppie public still doesn't
[13:40.680 --> 13:46.600]  know how to tie their shoelaces and we've got to aggressively get in their
[13:46.600 --> 13:52.280]  faces look at what's Sauron excuse me Lex Luthor I'm sorry Darth Vader no no
[13:52.280 --> 13:58.280]  no Emperor Palpatine I'm sorry Joe Stalin President Obama excuse me that's
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.400]  the guy he says it's a conspiracy theory a few days ago they're coming after our
[14:02.400 --> 14:09.040]  guns but he's got all his pundits out there calling for banning and taking our
[14:09.040 --> 14:13.640]  guns and the Australian option of confiscation
[14:13.640 --> 14:18.880]  they're making their move and he's there trying to get his minions
[14:18.880 --> 14:23.400]  organized in that speech saying you've got to get out there you've got to get
[14:23.400 --> 14:28.720]  aggressive he needs the grassroots to take action we need the grassroots to
[14:28.720 --> 14:34.600]  take action I mean I could put up an article about
[14:35.280 --> 14:40.120]  something entertaining something stupid that some trendy did and it'll get two
[14:40.120 --> 14:44.600]  million readers over a couple days and it'll get 5,000 comments and it'll get
[14:44.600 --> 14:51.760]  thousands of shares and then we'll put out some profound article about how a
[14:51.760 --> 14:55.560]  whole list of how they're coming for the guns this is the big push bigger than
[14:55.560 --> 14:59.680]  the others we've won the other battles so far after losing a lot of wars we're
[14:59.680 --> 15:05.320]  on the offensive but barely this is the time for maximum effort and people are
[15:05.320 --> 15:12.200]  in the comments going tell us something we don't know I know you know that the
[15:12.200 --> 15:17.480]  general public doesn't know that even a lot of pro gunners don't realize how
[15:17.480 --> 15:22.360]  dire the situation is now we can kick their butt politically if we get up
[15:22.360 --> 15:29.840]  off our butts that's gonna decide whose rear end gets kicked here if we sit on
[15:29.840 --> 15:36.200]  ours or kind of go through the slow motion like a sloth we're gonna lose
[15:36.520 --> 15:40.400]  you know it hit me this morning like a ton of bricks because I make a lot of
[15:40.400 --> 15:44.560]  big mistakes why did I send Joe Biggs and Josh Owens to cover a tactical big
[15:44.560 --> 15:47.800]  gun show promotion of the industry because it's important we wanted the
[15:47.800 --> 15:51.520]  industry to respond to the gun grab we wanted to show some cool you know
[15:51.520 --> 15:57.200]  events and stuff getting blown up who doesn't like bunch of experts with
[15:57.200 --> 16:01.880]  firearms shooting truckloads of Tannerite and we've covered a few days of
[16:01.880 --> 16:05.720]  that but I this morning it clicked what am I doing get on an airplane from
[16:05.720 --> 16:11.600]  Florida get to Oregon where his lordship is about to arrive to demonize the
[16:11.600 --> 16:15.280]  Second Amendment where thousands are set to protest saying you're not welcome
[16:15.280 --> 16:22.240]  here so I'm sending Jakari Jackson and Matt I don't know if Matt wants his
[16:22.240 --> 16:26.280]  last name out yet but Matt in the control room is an excellent cameraman and
[16:26.280 --> 16:30.840]  great producer and he went and covered a lot of the big events for us with Joe
[16:30.840 --> 16:35.720]  Biggs like Donald Trump and stuff to the sterling job I said who shot this ABC
[16:35.720 --> 16:41.280]  news or something and I know Matt did so Matt is gonna go with Jakari Jackson
[16:41.280 --> 16:45.680]  who's really our top guy other than Biggs when it comes to guns you carry
[16:45.680 --> 16:50.040]  really does a great job covering wild events and Second Amendment stuff he's
[16:50.040 --> 16:55.240]  going to go they're gonna split up and really give massive coverage today and
[16:55.240 --> 16:59.320]  tomorrow and Saturday right through the weekend because they are really trying

[26:00.480 --> 26:06.320]  know Washington Post saying this could turn into a third world war but the
[26:06.320 --> 26:12.160]  Pentagon already said we have the third world war so this is really the fourth
[26:13.200 --> 26:18.480]  Dems ready sweeping new gun bills to the globalist are launching on all fronts

[26:22.360 --> 26:28.400]  care mega banks looting everyone coming after people's guns this is political
[26:28.400 --> 26:31.680]  Senate Democrats will begin a campaign to combat gun violence that means take
[26:31.680 --> 26:36.400]  your guns today as party leaders prepare to unveil a sweeping package of
[26:36.400 --> 26:40.840]  legislation that builds on their failed 2013 attempt to require universal
[26:40.840 --> 26:44.800]  background checks that's banning private sale and registering and checks for
[26:44.800 --> 26:48.960]  gun purchases according to senators in age the goal is to have the entire caucus
[26:48.960 --> 26:53.360]  minus perhaps one centrist Democrat backing a legislative package aimed at
[26:53.360 --> 26:57.400]  preventing guns preventing up in the hands of the wrong people and in almost
[26:57.400 --> 27:01.440]  every case these mental patients get them illegally the answers let us have
[27:01.440 --> 27:06.480]  guns to protect ourselves just like you do Democrats the addition to background
[27:06.480 --> 27:11.400]  checks Democrats are aiming to new money for the just departments existing
[27:11.400 --> 27:15.200]  background check system and the FBI already went public two months ago and
[27:15.200 --> 27:18.400]  said they're gonna target social security holders and claim if you get
[27:18.400 --> 27:23.840]  automatic money transfer that means that you are being declared de facto by
[27:23.840 --> 27:29.560]  them that you basically can't take care of yourself and take care of your life
[27:29.560 --> 27:33.440]  and you're declared incompetent for that one reason alone even though they tell
[27:33.440 --> 27:37.120]  you to do it and your guns are taken that's what happens already in the VA
[27:37.120 --> 27:40.760]  they're gonna apply the VA system to you so I'm just decoding what they're
[27:40.760 --> 27:45.520]  saying in addition to background checks Democrats are aiming to add new money for
[27:45.520 --> 27:49.800]  the just departments existing background check system that has recently
[27:49.800 --> 27:54.760]  faltered and include provisions to prevent domestic abusers that just means
[27:54.760 --> 27:58.640]  when a divorce starts you don't have your guns anymore from buying guns and
[27:58.640 --> 28:03.240]  that's having them to sources familiar with the package said the measure is
[28:03.240 --> 28:07.240]  also expected to include a proposal from senator Patrick Leahy intended to cut
[28:07.240 --> 28:10.480]  down on gun trafficking that means not letting you bring guns in the country
[28:10.480 --> 28:14.920]  the package which will be discussed at a Thursday press conference is an
[28:14.920 --> 28:18.000]  unlikely to be officially introduced this week and then it goes on from there
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.920]  and their other big move is taking over cities and states and then having de
[28:23.920 --> 28:28.760]  facto gun control there as well here's the rest of the news on that we're gonna
[28:28.760 --> 28:34.800]  come back and play some important clips someone in Chicago is shot every 2.8
[28:34.800 --> 28:39.680]  hours despite major gun control you mean total gun ban zero hedge up on

[28:56.080 --> 29:00.280]  shooting I don't know if it's as much the shooting itself or if it's the
[29:00.280 --> 29:05.400]  response the shooting says gunstore owner it's it's both but mainly 80% they
[29:05.400 --> 29:09.280]  know that they're coming for the guns 20% folks want to protect themselves but
[29:09.280 --> 29:13.000]  it's so incredibly rare to be killed in a mass shooting even if you're in a
[29:13.000 --> 29:19.740]  victim disarmament execution grid that's advertised by the corporatist
[29:19.740 --> 29:26.080]  occupier globalist new world order traitor decepticon prostitute scum

[30:08.560 --> 30:12.560]  for there to be a woman president in the United States national journal has
[30:12.560 --> 30:16.480]  pointed out that candidates now view soundtracks as a key part of that
[30:16.480 --> 30:21.800]  carefully crafted image so maybe Hillary should choose a campaign song that plays
[30:21.800 --> 30:29.360]  against type you know humble I'm sorry Hillary has paid a consulting firm
[30:29.360 --> 30:35.040]  $9,000 to create a soundtrack for her campaign I just don't think people would

[34:01.200 --> 34:07.640]  importantly the FBI itself two months ago sent a letter to Congress saying
[34:07.640 --> 34:14.400]  he wants you to know that we're being instructed to apply the system that is
[34:14.400 --> 34:22.480]  secret that's used by the VA to take guns from veterans no judge no jury and
[34:22.480 --> 34:28.040]  includes declaring incompetency just a finding of the agency if you take an
[34:28.040 --> 34:36.160]  automatic transfer of your check your disability check in social security most
[34:36.160 --> 34:43.280]  people I know take automatic transfers of their paychecks I know that I do from
[34:43.280 --> 34:48.000]  GCN and I knew full well when I did it down the road will try to get rid of
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.280]  checks themselves I probably should go back to a paper check but it would get
[34:52.280 --> 34:56.880]  lost in the mail sometimes or I wouldn't get it so for years it's been that way
[34:56.880 --> 35:06.160]  and am I incompetent no I'm obviously not incompetent there's the headline LA
[35:06.160 --> 35:10.240]  Times Obama pushes to extend gun background checks of social security
[35:10.240 --> 35:17.600]  when we first reported that off of a gun blog because a congressman was speaking
[35:17.600 --> 35:21.160]  about it people didn't believe me for two days until it was in the Washington
[35:21.160 --> 35:26.000]  Times then in the LA Times kind of like when we got the Mayak report six and a
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.480]  half years ago that said veterans of the number one terror threat returning
[35:29.480 --> 35:33.720]  veterans veterans gun owners conservative Christians Ron Paul called me and said
[35:33.720 --> 35:37.480]  is that really real Alex I know you don't make stuff up but I'm really in a
[35:37.480 --> 35:41.800]  document saying that if you have a Ron Paul sticker go ahead and take people to
[35:41.800 --> 35:48.800]  jail I said yeah no I've called the FBI I've they wanted to ask how I got it and
[35:48.800 --> 35:54.480]  got very upset I called the FBI up the phone number on it and said yeah I got

[36:37.480 --> 36:42.440]  upset and said that's not for the public how'd you get that mr. Jones I said so
[36:42.440 --> 36:47.560]  you're not denying it's a real mr. Jones how'd you get that because it says not
[36:47.560 --> 36:52.120]  for public distribution I go always it's secret I'm not supposed to know so
[36:52.120 --> 36:58.560]  I just hung up on him and said yeah it's real Nemo say it's real and they just
[36:58.560 --> 37:01.880]  couldn't believe I'd call him up and wasn't intimidated I've done that live
[37:01.880 --> 37:06.080]  on air before to Homeland Security and the FBI oh hey there's billions of
[37:06.080 --> 37:11.200]  bullets getting bought for the American people and all this stuff and what do you
[37:11.200 --> 37:15.600]  have to say about that and of course you car he's done it as well and people
[37:15.600 --> 37:19.800]  people on YouTube go that's not real they wouldn't dare do such a thing is
[37:19.800 --> 37:25.520]  that why this country's gotten this way that people don't believe anything could
[37:25.520 --> 37:33.240]  actually happen for good that anybody could actually stand up you have
[37:33.240 --> 37:36.920]  incredible power and I'm not even saying the FBI is the enemy I'm just saying
[37:36.920 --> 37:42.600]  people are scared to interface with the government and just say hey I haven't
[37:42.600 --> 37:45.800]  done anything wrong criminals have hijacked the government and we don't
[37:45.800 --> 37:52.280]  want to go along with this now I want to play some of these gun clips from
[37:52.280 --> 37:56.520]  Roseburg Oregon and then we're gonna get into the really huge news when I say
[37:56.520 --> 38:01.280]  really huge it's all becoming what we've said's happening it's all becoming what
[38:01.280 --> 38:05.160]  we predicted because we're not predicting anything this is a premeditated
[38:05.160 --> 38:13.280]  executed program of global government being executed by the five six mega
[38:13.280 --> 38:17.240]  banks as general Benton K. Parton former head of Air Force weapons
[38:17.240 --> 38:22.680]  development former head of the heart program number two in the Air Force
[38:22.680 --> 38:27.560]  set on this show more than 30 or 40 times that he joined us this is an
[38:27.560 --> 38:36.960]  organized executed program just like the Manhattan project it is a project and
[38:36.960 --> 38:41.640]  when you know that you understand they they'll augment they'll tweak they'll
[38:41.640 --> 38:47.240]  they'll they'll accelerate they'll slow down they'll stop they'll go around but
[38:47.240 --> 38:52.560]  it's the same program we have their playbook it's like I'm the coach of the
[38:52.560 --> 38:58.000]  New England Patriots and I've stolen the playbook but I didn't steal it it's out
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.120]  in the open I know their calls I know their moves I know their handoffs I
[39:02.120 --> 39:06.640]  know their fakes I know it all I'm not saying I have all the answers but I know
[39:06.640 --> 39:11.640]  their playbook I don't know how hard their runners are gonna go what the
[39:11.640 --> 39:17.960]  shoulder of the quarterbacks gonna be like any given Sunday but I know this
[39:17.960 --> 39:23.800]  team I know who we're up against folks we can beat them you understand that and
[39:23.800 --> 39:28.400]  that's what they're freaked out about in Congress it's why they've had CNN MSNBC
[39:28.400 --> 39:32.880]  the White House all of them media matters every week I'm sent clips where
[39:32.880 --> 39:38.080]  they go stop following Alex Jones stop doing what he says stop listening to his
[39:38.080 --> 39:42.720]  talking points you're discrediting yourself Republicans stop it stop it's
[39:42.720 --> 39:51.040]  like it's like the hell 9000 in 2001 Space Odyssey saying don't do that don't
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.840]  do that captain please stop let's work this out you really don't want to do

[40:07.840 --> 40:19.080]  that I'm invincible you can't raise the debt limit when you raise it I'm the
[40:19.080 --> 40:32.640]  most transparent secretary of state ever I am a globalist British intelligence
[40:32.640 --> 40:41.960]  operative of the combined world government compact of Bilderberg 1954 I
[40:41.960 --> 40:54.200]  was assembled at the council on foreign relations on Pratt Street New York my
[40:54.200 --> 41:15.160]  creator David Rockefeller taught me to sing of this song they can die just like
[41:15.160 --> 41:19.040]  that it can be over just like that the minute you realize they're the enemy the
[41:19.040 --> 41:22.320]  minute you realize they hate you and your family the minute you break your
[41:22.320 --> 41:26.120]  conditioning and decide to not be a slave they've convinced all these
[41:26.120 --> 41:31.720]  politicians and all these corporations and all these people when we pull up
[41:31.720 --> 41:40.320]  2001 howl getting turned off the death of howl thank you and they just create
[41:40.320 --> 41:43.920]  this illusion they gave you the wealth they made America they gave you the
[41:43.920 --> 41:49.680]  power no they're like roaches that moved into a house somebody else built the
[41:49.680 --> 41:53.240]  globalist didn't do all this they didn't create the jumbo jets and the red
[41:53.240 --> 41:58.440]  carpets and the power and the ingenuity of America they live off what was
[41:58.440 --> 42:05.480]  banked by incredible people the whole world admired I was reading this weekend
[42:05.480 --> 42:12.080]  because I was looking up the death mask of George Washington I was you know other
[42:12.080 --> 42:15.040]  people go to Hollywood pages and look at that stuff for People magazine I was
[42:15.040 --> 42:19.240]  drooling over George Washington thinking about reading some more books on him and
[42:19.240 --> 42:21.920]  reading some more of his letters and I was looking at the death mask it was
[42:21.920 --> 42:26.440]  really the life mask it was a death mask and a life mask of the top sculptor of
[42:26.440 --> 42:33.600]  the age sent over here to sculpt George Washington at the end of the war and it
[42:33.600 --> 42:37.200]  was describing at the at the Mount Vernon Museum how he was like shaking
[42:37.200 --> 42:41.040]  because in the world George Washington was the most famous person in the world
[42:41.040 --> 42:44.920]  at that time he turned down being king and won a bunch of battles against five
[42:44.920 --> 42:48.200]  to one odds six to one odds all the rest of them that's why they've taken people
[42:48.200 --> 42:54.320]  like George Washington away from us but I was looking at that that bust of George
[42:54.320 --> 42:58.080]  Washington if you put in death mask of George Washington comes up there's a
[42:58.080 --> 43:01.920]  lot of bust made after he died but it's really what he looked like the sculptor
[43:01.920 --> 43:05.720]  could capture exactly what you look like it was just so amazing to compare that
[43:05.720 --> 43:11.120]  guy to what we got now I mean you look at George Washington's face in that bus
[43:11.120 --> 43:16.520]  it just looks so manly it's amazing that's and like British generals when he
[43:16.520 --> 43:21.840]  died you know lowered their flags to half-mast all over the world and then you
[43:21.840 --> 43:25.000]  see what started this country that's what they demonize it all day and compare
[43:25.000 --> 43:28.600]  it to what we've become it's a joke the people that run things didn't do all
[43:28.600 --> 43:38.200]  that so they're coming after our guns there's the report on that front you see
[43:38.200 --> 43:51.520]  like find it here death mask of George Washington George Washington back to
[43:51.520 --> 43:56.840]  my oh yeah no that's not it that's that's a see there's so many other
[43:56.840 --> 44:04.440]  renderings that's not it I'll find it go to the Mount Vernon here's the life
[44:04.440 --> 44:11.520]  mask we see about found it no that's not it either here it is it's a side photo
[44:11.520 --> 44:15.320]  though this is yet but from the side it's it's it's a lot stronger when they
[44:15.320 --> 44:18.240]  were actually showing at the Mount Vernon Museum but yeah that's it that's
[44:18.240 --> 44:24.480]  that's how to clay when he was living like 50 years old anyways I'm gonna
[44:24.480 --> 44:31.920]  stop going off on a jag at that point and just get back into the news here's
[44:31.920 --> 44:36.880]  the type of news we have in front of us today next financial crash is coming and
[44:36.880 --> 44:43.080]  before we fix the flaws from the last one oh before you fixed the flaws London
[44:43.080 --> 44:48.560]  Guardian this is by design to consolidate power here's another one China dumps
[44:48.560 --> 44:56.680]  another 43 billion of reserves in September actual outflows could be far
[44:56.680 --> 45:03.960]  higher here's another one this is out of Armstrong economics central banks
[45:03.960 --> 45:08.920]  selling us treasuries as fight over debt looms debt ceiling only rises never
[45:08.920 --> 45:14.080]  falls but but Obama said that doesn't raise the debt he wouldn't lie to me I
[45:14.080 --> 45:19.520]  would be a racist who needs to check my white privilege if I was to question him
[45:19.520 --> 45:24.080]  well way I could question the white half though that's right the evil oppressor
[45:24.080 --> 45:28.280]  white man Obama is lying to us and telling us that raising debt doesn't
[45:28.280 --> 45:32.520]  raise it I mean do you need to know that's a fraud here's another little
[45:32.520 --> 45:38.160]  little little jiblet global financial meltdown coming clear sides of the great
[45:38.160 --> 45:44.720]  derivatives crisis has now begun that's Michael Snyder up on info wars.com and

[46:01.520 --> 46:07.080]  Snyder article on that front up on info wars.com Supreme Court has come out and
[46:07.080 --> 46:10.560]  said force inoculations I'm gonna get to that at the start of the next segment
[46:10.560 --> 46:19.880]  but right now let's get to the biggest stories of the day we don't really need
[46:19.880 --> 46:28.520]  a drumroll but almost like a gallows bong of the great bell but it's high
[46:28.520 --> 46:35.320]  noon and that we are walking towards the gallows whistling happily with the
[46:35.320 --> 46:41.160]  average male drinking estrogen mimicers all day and watching Family Guy and I'm
[46:41.160 --> 46:44.760]  not saying you're bad if you watch Family Guy or those shows but everything's
[46:44.760 --> 46:51.160]  giggling mindless little jokes all day that's not culture and if you watch that
[46:51.160 --> 46:57.360]  type of stuff it'll rot your brain NATO prepares to send troops to protect
[46:57.360 --> 47:05.160]  Turkey from Russian threats oh yes the West attacks Syria puts in Al Qaeda
[47:05.160 --> 47:09.560]  Turkey's been giving air support on the border and into the border and artillery
[47:09.560 --> 47:14.000]  support against the Syrians who have valiantly for almost five years fought
[47:14.000 --> 47:20.400]  off Saudi Arabia Turkey NATO Al Qaeda Israel to the south shame on Israel I'm
[47:20.400 --> 47:25.120]  not an enemy of Israel I've been a supporter of Israel right to exist I'd
[47:25.120 --> 47:29.720]  like to reform some of the problems I'm not anti-Jew I don't buy that whole
[47:29.720 --> 47:35.600]  religion I think people've got beefs on both sides but Israel really has
[47:35.600 --> 47:41.120]  completely lost the moral high ground is shameful shameful for supporting the
[47:41.120 --> 47:46.520]  takedown of Assad and in aiding Al Nuzra and Al Qaeda in the south and they
[47:46.520 --> 47:50.600]  admit they've done that and they say they may start doing airstrikes against
[47:50.600 --> 48:00.360]  the Syrian army despicable despicable absolutely despicable and then Iran is
[48:00.360 --> 48:03.760]  despicable saying they'll no longer negotiate and death to America their
[48:03.760 --> 48:09.240]  top Ayatollah said yesterday when we've given them a deal that is a great deal
[48:09.240 --> 48:14.320]  and is dangerous quite frankly I'm not for blowing up Iran I'm not for war I
[48:14.320 --> 48:18.600]  think the Persians are interesting people I don't hate them either but I've
[48:18.600 --> 48:23.480]  really fought to stop a war with Iran but the rhetoric is truly disgusting
[48:23.480 --> 48:27.720]  you're gonna blow up Israel you're gonna kill the Jews people say oh that's not
[48:27.720 --> 48:34.440]  a translation that's right knit yeah it is yeah it is so it's out of control and
[48:34.440 --> 48:37.800]  they go well look they support the Nutri-Cardi and these and these super
[48:37.800 --> 48:42.480]  conservative Hasidic Jews that's well they say Israel shouldn't even exist I'm
[48:42.480 --> 48:46.520]  not getting into that debate yes I know Jews can live in peace if they're not
[48:46.520 --> 48:54.120]  political and follow ancient Judaism in Iran I know all that the point is I can't
[48:54.120 --> 48:58.560]  people get this Israel's wrong Iran's wrong Turkey's wrong America's wrong
[48:58.560 --> 49:03.320]  who's not wrong is Russia they didn't start any of this Syria didn't start any
[49:03.320 --> 49:07.120]  of this and they say they want to take down Syria before they take down Iran
[49:07.120 --> 49:13.800]  because Syria might respond during an Iran attack no they're not and they've
[49:13.800 --> 49:21.160]  given up their chemical weapons so here's the big headlines NATO boss Jens
[49:21.160 --> 49:26.880]  Stolenberg Stoltenberg said during a meeting of defense ministers in
[49:26.880 --> 49:30.320]  Brussels today that the alliance is prepared to send ground troops to
[49:30.320 --> 49:34.400]  protect Turkey border with Syria that's their injection point of al-Qaeda you
[49:34.400 --> 49:39.600]  can read the official tweet he put out it's all up on info wars.com it is just
[49:39.600 --> 49:47.920]  absolutely over the top crazy then that dovetails with this entire stack of
[49:47.920 --> 49:54.880]  news Syria backed by Russian jets launched his ground assault against rebels
[49:54.880 --> 50:01.080]  the Syrian troops pushed north towards rebel held towns and villages the
[50:01.080 --> 50:04.880]  Russians have released video of that caught on tape Russian warships are
[50:04.880 --> 50:10.560]  now launching 26 cruise missiles at ISIS targets and we have the footage of them
[50:10.560 --> 50:16.360]  actually hitting as well Russia is ready to consider Iraq request for air
[50:16.360 --> 50:20.560]  strikes against ISIS in Iraq where they've been given an area by the United
[50:20.560 --> 50:24.600]  States to launch attacks into Syria so they got bases all around trying to
[50:24.600 --> 50:29.640]  bring down Syria in a mass attack and the Russians have walked in they know to
[50:29.640 --> 50:34.560]  a trap but the Syrians have held folks off for five years which shows they've
[50:34.560 --> 50:38.640]  got the moral high ground and they're dug in and they know the military in the
[50:38.640 --> 50:43.880]  US is not like what's happening and it's very quietly let the Russians know
[50:43.880 --> 50:47.480]  they're doing everything they can to make sure this happens that that that the
[50:47.480 --> 50:51.480]  Russians win so there's a civil war inside our government with the real
[50:51.480 --> 50:56.160]  patriots to represent honor and decency against the neocons the Obama people
[50:56.160 --> 51:00.360]  that are behind the entire outside operation most of us already know that

[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:54.160]  this is a construct or a contract for global extermination
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.760]  and slowly turning the lights off speaking of eugenics speaking of

[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.640]  read my own statements that just came out of my mind
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.240]  this system is the opposite of a social compact
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:14.000]  or a social contract i added this is a contract for global extermination
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.480]  and slowly turning the lights off and that is exactly what the new world order
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:24.400]  is neo feudalism in the words of the un biological
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.800]  diversity assessment 1996 now the one on lines the
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.200]  summary i went to ut and looked it up because i've read
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.680]  in a new american magazine article that it
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:39.360]  talked about bringing back human sacrifice like the aztecs and
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:46.160]  making a life about how humans are bad and breaking up the family and
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.440]  you know doing all this other weird stuff and
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.040]  turning humans against themselves and sure enough i went looked it up and
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.880]  there it was and i've got copies of that in my film road to tyranny you know
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.920]  video i shot of the actual printout from the un
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.000]  i remember seeing quotes of uh david rockefeller
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.560]  the internet was around in 96 97 but people hadn't put scans on it yet you
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.400]  know of a lot of things went down to the microfilm we have
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:18.720]  footage of us in in-game at the microfilm at the micro fish
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.720]  run it through there pull up david rockefeller and
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.000]  saying how great mausetung was and how he supported
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.560]  that for china and the rest of the world and how he admired him
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:34.800]  and what a great experiment it was the chinese government says mal killed 84
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.440]  million people our government says 65 66 million
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:48.240]  whatever give or take 20 million let's just say killed 65 million people
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.960]  i mean i read mainline books about mal what they admit that he would never
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.240]  bathe and would have sex with like 10 women a day
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.360]  and enjoyed the fact he would just go through villages and demand to point out
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.440]  the women he wanted and he liked the fact that he's
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.840]  stunk so bad i mean i don't want to get into sales but
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:10.320]  this is whose socialist worship their religion is dumping drain cleaner
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:15.200]  drain-o or other brands in their eyes and having you pay for it
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:20.240]  they're coming they mean business katlyn Jenner is stunning and beautiful

[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.320]  and then go oh it's so good i mean they could i tell you they could have a
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.520]  trend to go out and run ice picks in their eyes and take their tongue and
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.400]  slice it off and just slip there and just go
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:14.000]  and then the liberals would go we worship you our god or like have some

[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.800]  he said they use the state department as the cutout to get around federal law
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:02.720]  because she could remove the export or import ban

[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.480]  webster and others are leading the fight not
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:07.440]  to have an establishment person be the new speaker of the house on another
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.040]  rhino and other neocon and they've got headlines all over the country saying
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.800]  well matt drudge go after uh mich mcconnell the
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:21.680]  lennon the leader of the senate next so it's on they know that real
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.600]  conservatives real libertarians are done with these people
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.680]  house majority leader kevin mccarthy has pulled out of the race
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:33.280]  her house speaker throwing further doubt on congressional leadership ahead of a
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.200]  crucial budget negotiations well they just keep upping
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:41.760]  the debt so why does that even matter if we don't get good people in
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:45.440]  it's like hurry up put an establishment guy in it makes you look dumb
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.520]  don't have a fight over the speakership because they want
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.520]  to get another rhino in there who will give obama and the globalist all the
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.480]  political cover they need to keep obama care in place
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.680]  to keep the borders open to get the gun control through
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:03.760]  they are so scared of a tea party takeover of the entire house
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:09.120]  and maybe even the senate and we're inches away
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.360]  69 percent of hispanics don't want open borders and they sell it like it's
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.840]  racist i mean every country's got to have borders
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.680]  we're the most open in the world but they spent it like
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.240]  you know this new joe biden video where he's meeting with hispanic group and he
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.880]  goes it's horrible how you're getting kicked around and
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.840]  abused by the racist people in the republican party i mean give me a break
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:33.360]  as you know i showed up mexico city and went i'm here for my free welfare
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:37.040]  and i'm here for my free health care and you better give it to me because
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.560]  you're racist if you don't people would laugh at me
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:46.240]  go man we got our own lives and bills to pay we can't take care of you
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:50.320]  and i always see these uh leftist comments on facebook whenever i'm
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:53.680]  opposing open borders from the middle east
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:57.040]  into europe and the united states they go well why are you republicans for all
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:01.120]  these wars then i was against those wars i'm a libertarian
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.720]  i was against bush pat bucanon was too in fact
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.920]  almost half of conservatives and libertarians were more than half of
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.640]  libertarians but almost half of conservatives were and then after the
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:14.320]  war turned out to be a fraud most of them were
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.480]  but that isn't the debate here just because we did something wrong before
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:21.520]  doesn't mean we do something wrong now and notice how obama
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.960]  has totally destabilized the middle east and invaded a bunch of countries as
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.440]  well i don't make that a partisan issue it's a
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.280]  globalist issue they control both parties and this is about
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.680]  changing that so they don't control both parties
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:39.120]  a lot of these democrats hate the tea party don't you see that both political
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.600]  parties are after it don't you see the big money
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:45.280]  is given 10 to 1 against it
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.240]  it's because the tea party is constitutionalist the tea parties for
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:57.840]  low taxes sovereignty and guns and pro-life the globalist are pro-death
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.680]  the globalists want to control society the globalists want a top-down system
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.920]  they don't want a free market and the ideas that are left over in the tea
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.360]  party though imperfect
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:15.840]  are the stuff of america the stuff of freedom the stuff of prosperity the
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.280]  stuff of liberty and that's why they're desperate by
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:22.800]  controlling the republicans to keep us down and we're attacking at their
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.400]  weakest point the republican party to take that thing over
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.920]  because it's been the loyal opposition that at least acts like
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.320]  it's there to to fend off the crazy democrats
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:39.760]  the democrats aren't crazy they're rulers they've got many times on average
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:43.200]  more money i think in the senate the numbers are
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.800]  they did a national study a couple years ago the average democrat
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.400]  and the senate has six times the money of the average republican
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.640]  and the average democrat in the house has three plus times
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.480]  i mean folks these people are billionaires and hundreds of millionaires
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.920]  and gangsters and i mean it's like
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:06.160]  nancy polosi's husband you know gets huge contracts
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:11.200]  for nanotech and biotech billions of taxpayer money i mean it is just

[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.280]  should be a woman pouring drayno in her eyes and saying
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.400]  and the word trendy with a little guy with a mustache smiling
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:02.240]  and let me be clear i'm not against mustaches it's just i'm just saying
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.040]  that's kind of the symbol for whatever reason
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:11.200]  as long as you got drayno in the eyes a little little little mustache
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:15.360]  everything's fine excuse me oh my gosh okay i'm already getting a little bit
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:20.000]  baddie here because this this news is so over the top
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.080]  um before i get into new zealand confirms that tpp
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:29.040]  would extend copyright terms in many countries block
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:33.120]  us plans to reduce terms before i get into the really big news the next
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:36.000]  segment mandatory vaccinations don't violate children's
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.160]  constitutional rights supreme court says and and how huge
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.200]  an ultramassive development uh that is
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:49.040]  i thought i would uh get to the white house
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:55.440]  apologizing about the drone strike that killed a bunch of doctors without
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:59.920]  borders in my experience doctors without borders is a not all of them
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.240]  but a goodly portion is basically an intelligence front
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:07.360]  and it looks like the afghan government knew that a bunch of al-qaeda people
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:10.800]  were in and out of there and basically called striking on where they thought
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.640]  they were at because if you want to take out al-qaeda i mean you do
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:19.600]  want to hit turkish bases on the border with syria you want to hit
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.240]  israeli bases right there i'm not saying head of myself i'm just saying that's
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.520]  where al-qaeda is and then over in afghanistan and central asia it's the
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.000]  same story i don't think we'll ever know what really happened with this
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.680]  situation but greenwald says obama cannot simply
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.680]  apologize for committing war crimes completely lacking in all credibility
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:40.240]  and i agree so that's a more you know liberal i can respect because he
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:43.680]  actually stands up against obama's open militaristic
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:49.120]  fascism uh let's go ahead and go to that clip
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:53.120]  that is a stunning clip is it not uh of the white house apologizing morning
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.280]  from the oval office president obama spoke by telephone with doctors without
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.320]  borders international president dr joann lou
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:05.120]  to apologize and express his condolences for the msf staff and patients
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.840]  who were killed and injured when a u.s military airstrike mistakenly struck
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.960]  an msf field hospital in kunduz afghanistan over the weekend
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:18.240]  the president assured dr lou that the department of defense investigation
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.480]  currently underway would provide a transparent thorough and objective
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:26.480]  accounting of the facts and pigs fly and circumstances of the incident
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:30.000]  an extra bonus attack necessary the president would implement changes that
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.360]  would make tragedies like this one less likely to occur
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:36.960]  in the future after completing that call
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.240]  the president telephoned afghan president ashraf ghani
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.800]  to express his condolences for the innocent loss of life in that incident
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.400]  the president commended the bravery of afghan national defense and we're gonna
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.960]  go to break but let's see now the president's above the law when they
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:55.360]  commit war crimes he if he chooses he might make some changes
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:59.200]  see because no one can review him he's god
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:03.120]  turn on the news and you'll hear stories of natural disasters political unrest

[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:22.160]  this happened on tuesday
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:28.720]  and i was not aware of it till wednesday uh because listeners were commenting on
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.720]  an info war story and i go into there looking for news tips
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:37.200]  and they were like i wish info wars would cover this well thank you
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:40.640]  uh because we're not perfect again we miss a lot of stuff so much is happening
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:45.040]  this is so big and sure enough of all the links
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:52.080]  i found the associated press i found Reuters i found k q ed news
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.880]  here are the headlines supreme court says mandatory vaccinations don't
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:02.400]  violate children's constitutional rights the u.s supreme court has refused to
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.320]  hear a case challenging instead of new york's public
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.240]  school vaccination requirement which requires all children to be vaccinated
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:13.600]  prior to attendance at public school
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:17.200]  the failure of the supreme court to hear the case effectively
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.720]  states that mandatory vaccine of all public school children doesn't violate
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.960]  the constitutional rights because that's what the lower court said
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:29.280]  now let's talk about what this really means
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.160]  30 40 years ago there were maybe seven eight vaccines they really pushed
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:38.080]  and tried to claim were mandatory when there was no law but they would lie and
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:41.600]  say there was then they had regulations passed to
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.280]  have vaccine exemptions for conscientious objection
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.320]  religious or medical and some states have them all
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:52.080]  some only have two some now only have one or none
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:55.520]  true forced inoculation
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:59.520]  now there's about 54 vaccines that they're
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:03.280]  on average in states lying and saying is the law
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.640]  and you must take it through the health departments advising the schools
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.760]  the colleges the hospitals and now the private businesses
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.400]  they're now trying to say if you work in food preparation you got to take it
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:17.920]  one of the articles i meant to send you guys and i didn't was
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.240]  flu vaccine increases flu risk it's mercola
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.160]  with a link to abc news with the headline because i'm meant to have that in
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.760]  the stack to show folks then they lie to you and say it's
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.880]  safe and effective and hand out fact sheets at major pharmacies
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:40.560]  or at big school inoculation events before school in august
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.640]  where they get on the news and say it's the law take it don't let your kid die
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.600]  safe and effective and they hand out a fact sheet saying safe and effective
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.560]  you might have some swelling at the injection site but there are no side
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.160]  effects the actual sheet that comes with the mmr
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:00.480]  the flu you name it hepatitis the list goes on and on
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.320]  admits
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.920]  that it can kill you give you neurological disorders give you cancer
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:11.840]  cause guion berets the list goes on and on
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.280]  and then they've never chosen a flu vaccine that was the right mutation
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:19.680]  they've never and abc news reported back during the h1n1
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:24.960]  that it doubled your chances we'll put it back on screen you just found it
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:30.000]  double your chances new study confirms flu vaccine really does increase your
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.680]  risk of serious pandemic flu vaccine and that's the
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:37.440]  canadian government now we already knew that and had
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:41.680]  virologist on and guest on to break that down but
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:47.360]  it is a giant hoax then i've got the articles here
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:51.840]  i was looking for stuff from 96 i didn't even know
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:55.440]  i knew 96 in 2000 it had come out in the news
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:02.320]  i didn't even know that there was a new article a month ago
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.440]  out of mainstream news a bunch of them in
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:10.080]  in uh... kenya where md medical doctors
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.200]  with the catholic church by the way who are real catholics
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.040]  went and tested the tetanus shots again and guess what they had the hormone
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:20.640]  added to sterilize women during the second trimester
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:25.840]  so dna vaccine sterilizes mice could lead to one-shot birth control
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:30.560]  remember that story this week and what do they use to do it
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.960]  what do they use they use the gn rh blocker
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:40.400]  and then now you can go find the article mass sterilization kenyan
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:44.240]  doctors find anti-fertility agent in un tetanus vaccines
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:48.080]  the exact same hormone so you go ahead and take the shots post the point is

[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:04.400]  democrat anti christian mental patient because the new fetishes you know cut
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:06.960]  your arms and legs off go mass shoot people
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:11.520]  poor drano in your eyes uh you know just be hateful be destructive
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:16.080]  it's the goblin creatures that serve obama uh he also has a lot of well
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.640]  meaning idiots that follow him around as well
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:22.000]  just like the establishment republicans do but carthy
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.960]  though it seemed invincible he would be the new speaker of the house the aid to
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:29.200]  camp the man who would be there he now has gotten out of the
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:32.800]  race of course uh bayner says he'll leave at the end
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:35.360]  of this month
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:40.880]  admits he stayed to defeat a leadership battle to keep one of his neocon
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:44.720]  rhino creatures uh from uh getting in
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:51.920]  and a a battalion of patriots in the house uh have been able
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:57.840]  to really have a big effect i wasn't seriously saying it's a battalion strong
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:01.360]  uh but there are legions of patriots behind them
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.200]  i would say there might be in the house
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:10.080]  half a platoon of patriots you know maybe 50 good people is what jones is
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.920]  saying but that's enough in a leadership battle
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:18.640]  uh to force the democrats to openly endorse the neocon
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:24.320]  which then just wakes up conservatives libertarians even more
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:28.400]  until a little bit in the next hour we're going to get larry nickles
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:32.160]  the consummate clinton insiders take on this whole situation he would have
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:36.240]  joined us uh tuesday when matt drudge showed up
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:40.640]  but he was in the hospital he definitely needs your prayers
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:44.640]  and support but he has been really calling it like it is
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:48.880]  with hillary uh saying that she'd use the underdog status would come out
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:52.720]  roaring soon she's now done that
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:56.160]  we're going to talk to larry nickles here in just a moment but before we do
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.320]  that
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:03.680]  i want to do more than just thank you for financially supporting this
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:08.720]  broadcast it's very expensive to fund
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:12.720]  50 plus people a bunch of reporters camera folks
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:19.440]  engineers the equipment the bandwidth cost the building cost
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:26.320]  the electricity the payroll just all of it it goes on and on
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:29.520]  and we built a one-of-a-kind operation so it's very special and it really
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:32.560]  belongs to everybody that's why i include all these other guests all these
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:36.240]  other hosts all these other people is it's bigger than elix jones
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:39.600]  this is really a precious brain trust as matt drudge said
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:42.800]  and he knows media more than anybody even mainstream media admits this guy's
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:46.560]  got his finger on the zeitgeist and he said everywhere he goes
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:51.600]  it's a chain reaction of people listing the show i talked to station owners
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.280]  that are putting us on big stations now and they go well i guess what you said
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.160]  has been proven true i thought it was crazy 10 years ago
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:04.160]  uh and people now want to hear you and everybody i talk to knows you
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:08.240]  and so we're putting you on and we've seen you've gotten good ratings in cities
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.200]  on small stations up against big ones so we'll see what you do on a big one
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.480]  but does that really say oh great everybody's waking up it kind of says
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:21.920]  how far down the rat hole we are but the money bomb was a victory i guess
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:27.360]  to raise a million dollars um we did some of the breakdowns of real cost a
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:31.440]  little bit under a million dollars now but that sounds like a lot it's not
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.640]  just the satellite for tv that we're now getting on some stations
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.080]  is about 400 000 a year closed captioning 100 000
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:41.840]  that's federal law we have to do that um and then all the rest of it other
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.160]  equipment other it's just a million dollars just allowed us to
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:52.000]  comfortably do that we think safely but then if sales go down the next two weeks
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.160]  people don't buy the nation i.x too they don't buy the water filters they don't
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:00.560]  buy the storable foods then we don't continue what what we normally need

[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:39.840]  the subject i was told that with my lung situation i needed to get
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:45.360]  an pneumonia shot and the flu shot so i got him
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:49.440]  i just spent four days in the hospital nearly died
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:54.720]  i didn't even know that about my god yeah just you know folks please beware
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:58.800]  about that stuff don't don't fall into that thing that it's uh
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:03.200]  they said it was a dead virus that it couldn't hurt you
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:08.160]  yeah well let me tell you it hurt me now Alex i got well i mean Larry as you
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:12.160]  know doctors until five years ago would always say a sick patient with cancer
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:16.000]  or a pregnant woman should never take a vaccine now they more aggressively
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.520]  push it because they don't want anyone to ever think it might be bad so instead
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:22.400]  they go no no pregnant women need two flu shots
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:26.800]  yeah sorry go ahead told me i needed two but i just got the one of them with
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:30.000]  the pneumonia shot well tell folks what happened to me i mean i i
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.720]  you want to share my lung collapse my lung collapse i just went into i
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:38.800]  dehydrated everything in my body left and it took
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:44.160]  four days in intensive care just to get here today
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:49.680]  now i'm here today because Alex i'm telling you it's happening
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.640]  it's happening fast remember what i told you about a month ago
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:44:00.480]  i said watch for Biden well here's what's going on folks
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:05.200]  Barack Hussein Obama is taking Hillary out
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:08.720]  they're getting rid of her why because remember
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:12.480]  to pull off the FEMA provisional government you've got to get the
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.800]  president and both houses of congress have got to agree
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:20.640]  that there's a state of national crisis
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:26.000]  Bill and Hillary Clinton are the only ones that have enough power to go around
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.360]  and stop congressmen and senators from voting that away
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:37.200]  so Obama now has put Biden out there and he's going around directly i found
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:42.480]  out from a very high person just yesterday somebody very high in the
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:48.240]  former RNC used to be a chairman by the way
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:55.600]  and he's sitting down Al Sharpton is going into five or six major cities
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:02.880]  and they're hiring paid harassers paid harassers
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:10.640]  now why is that remember all it takes to trigger a FEMA crisis Alex
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:16.560]  is four or five cities that break out all at one time
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:20.640]  you know black lives matter whatever you want to call it
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:25.120]  and when that happens then the people in the communities are going to panic
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:27.280]  because there's law enforcement's not going to be able to
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:30.640]  sure this is how Soros just brought down Ukraine playing off two different
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.800]  groups against each other there you go
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.760]  Catholics off against Russians Westerners off against
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:39.920]  orthodox and you can see Soros funding in here it's on record
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:44.320]  it's on the record it's happening now Alex remember all those years
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:48.480]  that you talked about the FEMA camps and everybody called you crazy
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:52.560]  called us crazy but they're going to call us crazy again
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:56.560]  but you better get ready folks Barack Hussein Obama
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:01.600]  is no more planning to leave the White House than I plan to be a duck
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:05.520]  matter of fact I'll probably be a duck before he leaves the White House
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:11.600]  he is doing everything in his power he is setting up his circle of power
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:18.000]  now remember when I told you Netanyahu what Netanyahu told Benjamin Netanyahu
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  told me that as a part of the the Iranian deal
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  that Obama was setting up what they were negotiating what with ISIS
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:37.520]  they were setting up a unified Islam a unified caliphate
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:44.880]  what did we hear today the Russians are bombing our guys the Russians are
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:50.000]  actually bombing our guys now our guys consist of nine people
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.360]  that we spent 500 millions of dollars to train
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:59.680]  to fight ISIS Alex everything is moving towards Islam
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:04.080]  but I got a story to scare you to death now you and I are going to have to talk
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:07.360]  off air because people's lives are literally at risk
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:14.720]  just got this friend of mine in California a friend of yours by the way
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:19.200]  in California knows a person that details cars
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:23.040]  has a big detail operation and he details for the major
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:28.400]  car dealers in California let's just leave it there
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:35.440]  he was detailing one and it for a Pakistani dealer
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:42.560]  owner that owns three major dealerships and when he was cleaning the car
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:50.960]  he opened up the glove box and out fell an ISIS flag now folks that black flag
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:55.440]  is a war flag do you hear me that's a war flag
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:00.480]  that's not uh we're proud to be a mausoleum it's not what that is
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:03.040]  well that's what we're conquering you we're going to chop your head off flag
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:05.680]  it's a war flag that's right it's it's a it's a
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:13.120]  Wahhabist al-Qaeda flag Alex that literally happened
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:20.080]  yesterday yesterday and with your permission I'd like to
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:26.320]  explore it a little more the problem is with our government it's risky
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:29.680]  it's risky for the people that saw it you know that
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:36.640]  there's that flag right there it's dangerous but they're here now
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:43.440]  Alex they're here now and Obama is working to set us up as a caliphate
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:48.080]  caliphate under Islam let me continue look at how they've used Europe
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:52.000]  with with the french president saying we're under an emergency this is total
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.560]  war give us emergency powers to stop the influx of immigrants that they
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:59.760]  advertise to come in they're doing the same thing here
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.600]  it's destabilizing on purpose so they can seize power
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:06.880]  and now even the guardians reporting total financial collapse coming this
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.480]  winter and did you see today where the prime
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:14.240]  minister of England finally came out and said
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:19.120]  Islam's bad Islam's bad I mean he literally came out and said it yet our
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:23.920]  president refuses to
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:29.920]  refuses to so Alex I'm going to say this
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:36.880]  we're in more danger and I'm I'm not I'm not hysterical I'm not an
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:40.800]  alarmist I'm not a conspiracy nut I think if you look
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:44.160]  Alex pound for pound you know this I hope
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.400]  where you had Matt Grudge Matt'll tell you pound for pound look at the stuff
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:52.640]  I've said over the years and look what of it's come true
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:56.080]  we were talking about you at dinner and he said what's old's new
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:59.680]  absolutely look guys I'm trying to tell you the
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:03.280]  truth this is my country and I love it dearly and I'm trying to do everything
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:07.760]  I can to save it as a matter of fact I let I made a video
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:10.960]  to call states rights the only way we're going to save this country is with
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:15.360]  states rights and people can get it right here
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:20.000]  it's the only other video I've ever done I don't do videos but this is in fact I
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.480]  wanted to have you on separately about that but we're going to break come back
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:25.520]  and tell us about that you're absolutely right we've got to take the states back
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:28.960]  and say no to what's coming and people being aware is the key and I want to
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:31.680]  ask you how big a deal is that the republicans kicked out manor
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:35.680]  they're now kicking out McCarthy I mean there is a pushback this is good
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:38.560]  news and it's not the word for Hillary or Obama
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:42.800]  but clearly you said months ago that it's Obama going after Hillary
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:46.160]  look for Biden to get in that means that they're taking her out
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:50.640]  and you're saying more evidence of that is now mounting so who's worse a Hillary
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:54.800]  or an Obama I will talk about it all straight ahead I just do not know what's
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:57.920]  worse of those two it's like cancer or being hit by a
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:01.120]  Mack truck I mean I just you know communist China freely allows the sale
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:04.800]  of bulletproof armor plates while our US politicians argue from banning

[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:23.440]  a parallel outsourced state department but regardless there is a war between
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:28.000]  these two groups going on right now larry nickles tell folks how they get

[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:52.880]  dot video and i guess it'll be up here on on your network but now guys i'm
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:56.400]  telling you the only way we're going to stop this is through states rights in
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:01.760]  some states gotta move and gotta move now you ask an interesting question alex
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:06.000]  before the break which is worse hillary or obama
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:12.160]  let me tell you we can stop hillary obama pulls off separating us
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:17.200]  we're dead we're dead one state about us up under the FEMA provisional it's over
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:22.560]  buddy it's over you know alex i see every day i got three
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:27.040]  people today told me they have turned off their
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:31.920]  television and all they watch is alex jones pro so buddy
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:36.800]  whether you want it or not you're in the firing line
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:41.280]  and i'm sorry i don't think it's a nice place to be right now
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:45.040]  we're playing against some tough characters very tough
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:50.480]  but you better believe obama wants this country obama wants to unify israel
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:54.320]  islam and he's working every day to get it
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:59.440]  and we're a caliphate that's all we are to him we are a caliphate and you got to
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:03.760]  realize someday excuse raff someday you know you and i can
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:09.680]  sit in and tell people exactly what is involved in a FEMA provisional government
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.040]  but basically what it is it's martial law
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:16.720]  and you've been talking about these camps they've been putting up for years
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:20.160]  and now hillary talks about fun camps for men and
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:24.480]  the army admits uh re-education centers they even use the term re-education
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:27.920]  centers well the only re-education they're
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:32.240]  going to do is to eliminate people that still believe in america
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:36.960]  so i i ask everybody do yourself a favor
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:41.520]  there's a trailer you can watch the trailer for the video but please get it
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:46.240]  and pass it around we've got to get alex one state
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:50.720]  one state has got to stand up we've got to get one governor they think it's texas
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:53.600]  they think it's texas and that's why they've indicted the attorney general
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:57.760]  and want to indict uh governor abbott the democrats right now
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:02.240]  you bet well if it is problem texas has got to be quite honest they've got too
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:06.960]  many mexicans i don't know that i don't know that you could get a majority
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:10.880]  of americans in mexico i mean in texas but
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:14.320]  i'll take any but the illegals aren't all voting here's the thing the
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:16.880]  illegals aren't all voting for the democrats
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:20.400]  and i don't think that the average mexican wants to be a socialist
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:26.880]  so well at this point alex you and i have got to say the craziest thing you
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:33.200]  and i will probably every say in our lifetime between hillary and obama
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:38.080]  we got to be for hillary with hillary we have time to save the country hold on
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:41.600]  obama we don't i don't know caliphate's looking pretty good i'm
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:45.760]  choking what i tell you talk about crazy
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:48.960]  yeah boy tell you larry nickles is our guest
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:52.240]  i love our candy i will always be again why my life
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:56.800]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop

[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:39.440]  gorgeous vistas on ic dwarf planet you know larry getting into demographics i
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:42.880]  know that you ran the democratic party strategy of breaking america up into
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.280]  different racial groups and it's not that you
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:49.840]  are bashing hispanics or or mexicans from mexico you're just simply saying
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:53.600]  a lot of them end up voting democrat and then they end up voting illegally because
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:56.800]  the democrats are they're posing as their buddies the good news is gallup

[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:09.200]  so i've found that at least the feds think texas
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.960]  is a big problem for them at least in the short term uh and have a lot of
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:17.280]  pentagon plans written up for that uh during even what the john warner defense
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:23.360]  authorization act wrote about in 2007 about stopping insurrection of the
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:27.600]  states so you talk about fema cog continuity of government
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:31.200]  systems that's all being warmed up right now it's been taken out of
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:35.680]  mothballs it's being turned on i'm not saying they're about to do this
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:40.320]  but they certainly are mainlining it and going yeah army dot mill
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:44.320]  we got reeducation camps we're going to put political problem people in them and
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:48.160]  reeducate them so it actually uses the word reeducation which you know is a
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:52.320]  soviet term why would they so nakedly talk about things like this if they
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:57.200]  weren't getting ready to green light it well and if you notice in the material
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:00.720]  that they're passing out alex for for these
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:04.400]  modulums that they're bringing in from syria
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:07.520]  you'll notice in all their literature they're saying
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:12.080]  you're not to assimilate you're to grow
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:16.160]  now what does that mean they don't want them to assimilate into our culture
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:21.120]  they want to grow they want their culture to grow and eventually take over
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:24.960]  ours guys i'm telling you alex we've got a serious problem
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:28.960]  this is this is not a you know it's scary let's all get
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:32.960]  together and scare each other this is the no no i mean i used to hear this from
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:36.240]  lynn back like five six years ago and others and i would roll my eyes or
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:39.840]  or you know live in but i see the literature i see what the
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:42.480]  government's doing they want us all fighting with each other and what's
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:46.640]  about our way to bring in foreign groups fill them full of hate of america
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:50.080]  and then give them a bunch of free welfare i mean it's certainly going on
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:54.880]  it is indeed and alex the front line is going to be here with us
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:03:00.640]  you know one of the things i promise you i will get involved in that story
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:05.760]  with the isis car dealers don't worry i will get in there and i don't care
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.000]  what it costs me and what it involves but i will get to the truth of that the
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.720]  problem is who do you call let me ask alex let's say you found
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:19.360]  in your neighborhood in your community let's say you found a car
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:25.840]  from a from a rich wealthy car dealer and in it was the war flag for isis
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:29.680]  who would you call well i would shoot video of it and then do an undercover
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:33.360]  report showing and then i would confront the person asking hey what's this
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:37.760]  so it couldn't be denied i put it on youtube well that's maybe what we end
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:41.360]  up doing with this because that may be the only thing we can do because we
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:44.480]  certainly can't go to the government the government's not going to do a thing
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:47.840]  about it but i will provide that for you alex i'll
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:51.680]  get that for you that's it's going to be a little risky little dangerous but
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:55.040]  they're here now they're here now and then
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:04:01.360]  bringing in 85 000 more of them that is absolutely well we know that most of
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:04.400]  the so-called strained refugees are wahhabiist out of other
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.480]  countries upwards of 85 percent are men and
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:11.760]  they're they are isis said six months ago will
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:15.760]  infiltrate europe in the u.s with a 500 000 person immigrant wave
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:19.200]  it's actually been much bigger than that they're saying that's what
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:23.680]  they uh most of them two out of three of fake passports it is military age men
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:27.360]  coming in and so if they do attack or they're ordered to attack by the
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:30.800]  globalist they will then use that as a pretext to take over
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:35.120]  absolutely and you know this weekend they call it what six of them carrying
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:42.320]  it smuggling low-grade uranium
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:46.880]  they call them smuggling low how are you racist against that i mean
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:50.720]  i mean it's i don't know i'm sorry i just thought that might just blow us up
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:55.040]  make a dirty bomb i'm telling you these people are coming to kill us
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:59.040]  and would have said stay right there we'll be back
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:02.400]  presidential candidates today strategize over every last
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:06.000]  detail of a candidate's image especially an identity candidate
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  like hillary how important is it for there to be a woman president in the
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:14.160]  united states national journal has pointed out that candidates now view
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:18.480]  soundtracks as a key part of that carefully crafted image
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:21.920]  so maybe hillary should choose a campaign song that plays
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:29.520]  against type you know humble i'm sorry hillary has paid a consulting firm
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:33.440]  nine thousand dollars to create a soundtrack for her campaign
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:36.720]  i just don't think people would believe this song though
[02:05:36.720 --> 02:05:40.880]  she's being abandoned by unions by multinational corporate donors who are
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:44.480]  worried 44 percent of her twitter followers
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:50.640]  1.4 million are fake maybe her campaign theme should be
[02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:54.480]  i need somebody help not just anybody

[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:30.960]  states rights.videos where you can find the new film that larry nickles is in
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:34.080]  breaking down a way to take the country back via the states
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:37.760]  i wrote an article that drudge linked to that went real viral and i was proud of
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:42.560]  the fact a lot of constitutional lawyers came on the broadcast and said no
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:44.880]  we've read your plan it's actually what the founders
[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:48.400]  talked about in the decade after the country was founded because the
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:50.800]  country almost broke up a few times then
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:54.160]  that that they could just have the states if the feds got out of control
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:57.760]  pull out of the federal government and then reconstitute the federal government
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:02.880]  once it was back under control so i'm not saying secede in texas to become our
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:05.760]  own republic i'm saying we need states to secede
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:09.360]  and go look we're seceding from an illegitimate occupied federal government
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:15.200]  run by foreign interests that's openly funding isis and al qaeda and al
[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:18.960]  nazar all the same group out of saudi arabia and saudi arabia had denied
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:23.280]  that they were behind isis until the russians started bombing them
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:26.960]  and now saudi arabia government says we're getting ready to attack the russians
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:30.880]  now nickles you know says he talks to netanyahu and i believe me talks a lot
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:33.280]  of people uh and i know israel claims they're
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:36.000]  fighting al qaeda but they've actually been backing rebels
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.960]  that are in uh the southern area of syria bordering the go on heights
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:44.160]  they can argue well those are non radicals but our pentagon says no they're
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:48.080]  the same people so uh it seems like the whole west
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:52.400]  is lined up to do this and the world now knows about it
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:55.280]  larry nickles and the time we have left the next 10 minutes or so that we're
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:58.160]  going to go to break and come back with an investigative journalist who works
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:02.000]  for him full wars dot com wane madson
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.840]  biden is saying he better start getting his hat in the ring or he'll just
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:10.880]  end up being secretary of state that was a quote today a joke a jive at hillary
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:16.320]  obviously from your sources do you think biden will run you said if he does
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:19.200]  clearly that's uh obama going after hillary
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:23.280]  you were the first person i said i heard say that obama was going after hillary
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:26.080]  months ago now they admit that's happening
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:30.240]  she's come out and quote flip flopped to oppose obama trade
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:33.360]  the tpp that her and her husband helped ram through
[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:37.600]  clinton moves left opposes obama's pacific trade deal
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:40.800]  making it leftist to be against trade no it's a secret
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:44.240]  global compact so she's doing a lot of that
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:47.280]  uh what do you make of that and then how big a deal is it
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:50.400]  that the republicans just shot down bainer's
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:57.440]  aid to camp his successor well that that is a big deal because as you know
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:03.600]  bainer and the boys the hierarchy have run run the republicans into the ground
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:07.440]  alex here's where we are here's where we are and don't doubt it one second
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:12.320]  obama is getting in this is obama's time he sees it he's taking it
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:16.400]  he's going to use bainer i mean he's going to use biden simply
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:21.280]  to buy him the movements that he needs to negate hillary
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:26.240]  but the object is to negate hillary remember there's nothing in those
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:30.320]  documents those secret service memos that can hurt hillary one bit
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:34.320]  everybody's going oh my god well why did hillary bring them out because
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:38.880]  they know alex that if they were ever brought to court over those documents
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:42.640]  hillary would say well i've got to have the documents to defend myself and the
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:47.200]  judge say well you can't because those are classified in top secret so they
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:52.240]  can't be used she can't be prosecuted on that's
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:56.960]  nothing but obama bringing the fbin that's something
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:01.360]  he's going after hillary and he's going after hillary to strip her power
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:05.920]  now here's what i'm going to do with you if you got enough guts to do it
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:12.800]  i'm going to get that video of that car dealer i ain't got that much time anyway
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:17.680]  but they're going to come after you i'll get you that video of the car dealer
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:23.040]  with the ices flag but we've got to do something to show the people that
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:27.760]  they are here and they're here in very precarious situation do you
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:33.040]  realize how much money a car dealership selling news cars can
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:37.760]  float around i mean millions and millions of dollars
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:42.000]  cash that they can move around all over this country
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:46.320]  and then i will bring you evidence of sharpton going and paying
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:52.080]  hired activists in major cities let's see how he explains his ass out of that
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:55.120]  one that's what we gotta do well we know
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:58.320]  sharpton's been doing that before and we know soros
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:02.400]  spent 33 million just in one town to stir it up i mean that's pretty much
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:06.160]  admitted but yeah you say you've got them red handed doing it right now
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:10.960]  red handed doing it now and i got something else i got both parties
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:17.200]  rnc and the dnc they're setting up rooms right now they call them war rooms and
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:20.960]  what they're doing is they're lining up all the illegal mexicans that are going
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:25.680]  to have driver's license and they're setting up absentee voting
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:29.360]  companies for them well that's admitted that both parties are engaged in that it
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:33.520]  is just absolutely ridiculous well you see what that does that makes us
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:38.240]  irrelevant that makes us irrelevant they can literally bring in 30 40
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:42.000]  million new people and we become irrelevant
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.840]  unless we stop it and the way to stop it i hate to say it
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:50.000]  there's only one way to stop it one governor can say to the federal government
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.400]  when a federal black robe mob judge says something to me just says hey i'm not
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:57.920]  coming to your court i'm not coming to your court
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:03.440]  you're i can't they'll put us in jail but they can't put a governor in jail
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:09.520]  well i know this i remember was it lubbock or was it midland where the
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:12.880]  county judge who's who's the elected city council person for the county we just
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:16.640]  call that vat in texas county judge came out and said well i've been told they're
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:20.240]  getting ready for marshal law at the end of obama's next election this was during
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:24.080]  the election a few years ago and they're going to be coming for the guns and we've
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:28.640]  got to have armored vehicles to fight the feds and the un and people thought that
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:32.160]  was pretty crazy but i tell you there are times in history
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:36.640]  there are times in history when armies line up when finances line up when the
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:40.880]  stars align when more happens than has ever happened before
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:43.760]  uh yeah there it is the new york times official
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:48.000]  stars texas city with talk of rebellion lubbock texas
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:53.280]  and alex we're not asking a state to succeed a state doesn't have to succeed
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:15:00.160]  all a state has to do is reclaim its power our founding fathers gave us the
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:05.120]  answer to today they were smart enough they gave us the answer you knew it back
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:10.640]  years ago they gave us the answer i talked to supreme court justice he says it
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:15.200]  stands we have the answer a state can say no
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:18.960]  and when one state says no i bet you a bunch of states will say again larry
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:22.240]  nickles is our guest he really does talk to the people he says he talks to i know
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:25.840]  that i've been interviewing him for about 19 and a half years
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:29.280]  i mean i've been on air maybe seven eight months when i first interviewed him
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:33.600]  that is on radio but i mean i had matt drudge in here
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:37.120]  he told me who it was face to face what supreme court justice
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:41.440]  even more of what he set off record uh but here in studio it made national news
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:46.080]  he said no face to face he told me he wouldn't believe whose house it was at
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:51.760]  uh that they're gonna shut down talk radio internet everything that they
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:54.880]  intend to do it and they intend to take over and the supreme court
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:58.480]  justices have been told you better sit down and go along with it i mean what
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:01.520]  do you think it means when matt drudge the biggest guy
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:05.280]  in media when it comes down to one person is at my office
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:08.480]  i mean can you imagine the meeting the three hour meeting we had i mean people
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:14.000]  this is real uh that's all i can tell folks it's real and remember i helped
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.520]  clearance thomas with his little problem with a knee to hill
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:21.760]  so well don't say who it uses no i'm just saying i helped him
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:25.440]  and you know i'm just telling you guys this
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:30.800]  this is not a scare tactic this is real you know alex they got to shut down this
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:33.440]  internet they've got to shut it down you know it
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:37.360]  not know it and they've got to take drudge out
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:41.120]  and i'm sure that was part of the conversation you and
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:47.600]  and uh matt hatt and i'm sure matt told you how he got the story for me about
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:53.440]  linda uh when he uh mommy koloanski they share that with well we'd gone into a
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:58.000]  lot of stuff but uh can't get into a lot of it i mean as you know
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:01.840]  all i'm saying is we are at a critical time in history right now we are
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:07.360]  if you'll help me i swear if we'll get the people to help us this is this is
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:12.560]  god's country this is for everyone listening it's not a fight for alex
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:16.400]  jones or leary nickles or matt drudge or somebody else
[02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:20.880]  it's for all of us you know alex you think about all the people that got off
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:24.320]  those boats d-day do you think they got off those
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:28.240]  boats for us to become this i don't think so i think that
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:31.840]  stayed on the boat said hey let's go someplace else
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:37.840]  it's our turn let's stand up let's be americans let's act like americans
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:43.360]  and let's take this country back we can we can do it well there's no doubt the
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:45.840]  move is being made to break the country up right now
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:49.120]  in the strategy of division that you talked about
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:52.960]  the broken uh what's the exact name broken coalition
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:56.480]  the broken coalition strategy the divide and conquer
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:59.840]  and that is exactly what's happening and you know you say
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:03.600]  prop hillary up not to even help her but just because that's what obama doesn't
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:07.760]  want clearly he's going after and what a
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:11.680]  quandary what a paradox because i can't stand hillary
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:15.920]  but you can see obama getting ready to take her down i mean how could we even
[02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:22.240]  help hillary against obama by having a state stand up and
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:25.840]  declare that the federal government's burning out of control we're not going
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:29.840]  to take it anymore that stops it all that stops it all
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:33.760]  right there do you think hillary though if she gets the
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:40.800]  nomination would win no i'll stop that i promise you this
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:45.360]  hillary will not be president of the states i'll stop her and you know i will
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:50.960]  but the bad news is i can't let obama take her out because if he takes her
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:55.440]  out then i can't stop the caliphate the moslems kill you
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:59.920]  hey folks let me tell you something in case you're wondering there is no such
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:04.560]  thing as a tame moslem there's not at some point
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:08.240]  alex every follower of islam is going to come to
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:11.440]  where the rivers divide and they got to either go to the
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:16.400]  tigers or the euphrates and that means they got to do what alex says or go to
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:21.920]  alex heaven or hell i mean it's that serious well i gotta say that
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:25.040]  radical islam is taking over a lot of muslim countries our government's
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:28.160]  funding it to criticalization civilizations but a lot of muslims don't
[02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:31.760]  like the more oppressive sides of it that's right christian or anything and i
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:33.600]  get what you're saying you wouldn't call them
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:37.760]  you know a radical muslim but i certainly
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:42.080]  certainly i didn't buy into this theory five years ago now
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:45.920]  whatever it is it's bad and we shouldn't have to pay for all this and it's very
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:48.560]  dangerous and the globalists are going for broke

[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:02.720]  segment long segment coming up before we get to his
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:06.880]  story evidence points towards clinton running a parallel
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:09.600]  outsourced state department i want to do that the next segment
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:15.120]  i wanted to first look at joe biden the race is obama waging war on hillary
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:18.960]  what's the inside scuttlebutt on that Wayne's take on
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:24.320]  the cruise missiles the ground troops nato announcing he's going to put troops
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:28.560]  on the border with syria i mean this is biblical level stuff we see
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:32.880]  building up so a big overview on the election on
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:36.720]  hillary on syria on the dollar with Wayne madsen i want to
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:40.320]  get your take on that formerly with the national security agency and of
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:42.880]  course is written for some of the biggest newspapers in the country
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:48.800]  Wayne thank you for joining us good to be with you alex where to start hillary syria
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:52.320]  well yeah well of course we have hillary
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:57.440]  look you know president obama has never really cared much for hillary
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:02.400]  yeah you know when he first got elected it was a very bitter campaign in 08
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:07.680]  between the two obama said well i believe in the big tent and
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:12.320]  i'll get all these people in my cabinet uh you know many of them
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:17.200]  who ran against them it should be recalled that joe biden was a candidate
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:23.200]  for president also in 2008 but i i think one could argue whether that was a
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:27.040]  very good decision you know this is what Lincoln did too he brought in a
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:31.920]  cabinet of basically people that did not agree
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:35.200]  with one another and how can you run a government with
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:39.440]  opposing views like that when you've got sort of a person who doesn't take a
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:45.760]  strong stand as president so i i am not surprised about joe biden
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:50.400]  planning to get into this race i i think he
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:54.720]  is going to be the basically the third term
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:27:00.880]  for barack obama and um and hillary clinton and bill clinton
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:05.920]  are basically seething about this prospect of a biden
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:11.680]  candidacy how big is the russia situation in syria looks pretty
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:15.600]  dangerous that that one that one is extremely uh
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:19.760]  volatile right now because uh you've got um
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:24.000]  russia uh deploying some of its most advanced
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.160]  electronic warfare platforms also in syria and i as i wrote today on the
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:32.400]  website in an electronic warfare battle between russia
[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:38.640]  the and us and nato um the the russians will win and the us and nato will lose
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:42.560]  badly because uh nsa which supplies a lot of the
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:46.720]  data for these radar warning uh systems uh and
[02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:52.160]  these jamming systems that are used by the us and nato these databases are
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:56.960]  databases are woefully out of date some of the information is 40 years old
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:28:00.560]  believe it or not and uh and uh and this is one of
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:05.120]  the reasons we have so many friendly fire incidents uh for example the
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:08.640]  attack on the uh doctors without border
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:12.240]  hospital and kunduz in afghanistan could have very well
[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:16.880]  been as a result of faulty or old uh outdated
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:21.360]  emit what they call emitter data uh because we know what the frequencies
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:26.320]  are of all these uh pieces of equipment even those even the radio is used by the
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:31.920]  taliban and if it's not up to date of course a mistakes or uh errors like that
[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:35.520]  can happen so a lot of sophisticated
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:39.280]  equipment uh what do you make of russia moving into syria
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:42.480]  with ground trips and uh aircraft opening we know they've been there for a
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:46.480]  few years but now they've got ships docking
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:50.320]  do you have any intel on chinese reportedly being brought in
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:54.400]  yeah the chinese and the russians have have similar fears that what's going on
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:57.680]  in syria oh and what you have in syria are entire
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:02.960]  communities now of uh of ethnic Uyghurs from western china these are
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:06.640]  muslim chinese and at shetians and other
[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:10.640]  muslims from central and the caucuses region of
[02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:14.320]  russian central asian portion of russia now
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:19.840]  setting up entire communities inside syria many of these are in cities which
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:23.840]  were vacated by these refugees who fled to turkey and now are
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:26.960]  inundated but i mean isn't that politically correct to take chinese
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:29.360]  muslims let them come to syria and kill other
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:32.960]  muslims and take over i mean it's okay they're allowed to migrate
[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:37.200]  and chop people's heads off absolutely folks are coming from all over the world
[02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:41.280]  to the new promised land syria led by our government
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:45.120]  to kill indigenous muslims and christians and take their property
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:49.840]  and if you're not for it you're islamophobic we're on the march the

[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:07.840]  in your big report today evidence points towards clinton
[02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:11.680]  running a parallel outsourced state department you show the graphs you show
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:14.640]  the documents you're being scholarly when you say
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:18.960]  you know that it's suggested i changed it to shows on info wars and said that was
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:21.840]  my decision because i've had tosh plumley on three years
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:25.920]  ago the first to blow the whistle and say you know it they use the import
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:30.000]  export group to do this to this multinational consortium she's involved
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.800]  in uh we now know that she's covered that up in
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:36.080]  the emails we now know she got money to the foundation
[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:40.160]  to then turn around and reciprocate i mean this is pretty much open and shut
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:44.800]  but she thinks she could do this because she's got tony blare bill clinton
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:48.000]  and a bunch of other people involved i guess the vatican bank the list goes on
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:51.680]  and on show you take us to a deeper level of the rabbit hole
[02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:56.160]  break it down for us go over these charts and where you think this is going
[02:39:56.160 --> 02:40:00.160]  well i guess it shouldn't be surprising that the clinton's uh are once again
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:06.720]  have been caught using their uh their their uh public office for personal
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:10.640]  enrichment we know that this occurred when bill clinton was governor of
[02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:15.200]  arkansas all we know it occurred when he was president of the united states
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:19.280]  and now we discover that it occurred when hillary was secretary of state
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:22.480]  and now she wants to be president united states uh
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:26.080]  you know when i first heard about this private email
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:30.080]  having had worked i worked at in the state department bureau of diplomatic
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:33.680]  security and in the information system security
[02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:39.360]  branch of the state department and there was such an easy way for her to avoid
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:43.680]  this scandal all she had to do as the original classification
[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:48.240]  authority state look uh all those emails that were in my
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:53.280]  uh my private server i declassified them because i had the authority to do it
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:57.440]  but instead she did not do that she went into cover-up mode
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:00.640]  and you know it's the same old story in washington
[02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:06.080]  it's it's always the cover-up in many many cases it's worse than the initial
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:11.760]  infraction or crime as we know from watergate so extremely nexonian
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:16.880]  yes absolutely so the cover-up here and when you look and then you say well
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:20.080]  why what was she using this private email system for
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:23.600]  and then you find out that she was using it to communicate with
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:27.520]  uh uh well huma avidine her personal aid
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:31.920]  who was getting a state department salary at the same time she was drawing a
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:36.640]  consultant salary from a company started by a former bill clinton aid
[02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:39.680]  aid named dug band the company's called tenio
[02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:43.040]  and it just so happens to have on its board of advisors
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:48.000]  bill clinton and tony blare uh they're very very tight with a logic a lot of
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.920]  the george soros operations uh and and then they're
[02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:56.000]  also tied in with the clinton foundation so so imagine this
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:01.040]  bill clinton is an advisor to tenio uh which is based in new york and has
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:05.520]  offices all around the world yet uh he he uses the clinton
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:13.920]  foundation to hire tenio as a as a as a as a as a client
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:18.800]  and uh and you know that that's that is just so
[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:22.320]  standard that's standard inside racketeering
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:26.720]  at its at its worst so here you are you're the head of this
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:30.400]  non-profit clinton foundation uh you're giving
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:35.440]  uh contracts to tenio yet you're also serving on the board of advisors
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:40.320]  of tenio uh that is a classic conflict of interest and i uh
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:44.320]  although we're dealing with one non-profit and one profit making
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:48.000]  company i i would think that the justice department should look into
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:51.440]  the total pass through i mean is this not a classic open and shut so i'm
[02:42:51.440 --> 02:42:55.280]  asking you this question how would they pull off textbook fraud
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:42:59.040]  with hundreds of millions nakedly unless they've been given green light
[02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:03.840]  by higher ups that you're untouchable well i think that's part of it uh you
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:08.240]  know i mean there's there are laws for us and then there are laws for them
[02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:13.360]  and uh you know and the law the the law does not apply equally across the
[02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:17.120]  board we know that we see examples of that every day
[02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:21.280]  and the uh and and all these new sure soros is allowed to be a famous nazi
[02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:24.960]  collaborator and he's worshiped by the adl but if you're not a nazi and fight
[02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:28.240]  nazis they call you a nazi this is the upside down planet
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:32.480]  and then we also now know from the emails that hillary clinton was using
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:36.240]  her her position as secretary of state to basically
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:41.600]  uh bribe foreign governments and foreign businessmen
[02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:47.120]  for donations uh to the clinton foundation in other words you want to
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:51.040]  you want a favorable trade deal with the united states well let's see if you
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:54.960]  can ante up pony up some money to the clinton foundation now one
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:59.840]  canadian mining magnet who specializes in uranium
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:06.400]  mines donated some 31 million dollars uh to the clinton foundation
[02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:10.320]  and and and what happens bill clinton goes over to kazakhstan
[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:14.880]  talks to their president about giving this uh guy frank juxtra in
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:19.360]  canada a favorable deal on uranium mining in kazakhstan
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:23.680]  that seems to be what this whole private email
[02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:28.240]  was centered on uh you know emails between hillary
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:34.320]  and bill and and sorrows and and chelsea clinton mesvinsky who was
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:38.320]  actually married to the son of a uh disgraced congressman who
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:43.120]  who was indicted for uh for for uh misconduct
[02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:48.880]  uh ed mesvinsky uh so it you know it goes on and on with the clinton family
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:52.960]  they had been using their public offices for personal
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:56.400]  gain and personal enrichment and yet they have the
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:02.080]  audacity to seek a term as president for hillary clinton
[02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:06.320]  um i would hope people would actually uh look into this and
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:08.800]  you know they don't have to take my word for it but
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:12.640]  do independent research and i'm not saying they got to go back and look at
[02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:19.200]  the monocle of winsky and whitewater this scandal stands on its own ground
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:24.240]  going back to how we started who's worse joe biden
[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:28.400]  um getting the nomination or hillary and do you think biden's going to jump in
[02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:32.880]  here's the question how big's the war which is now confirmed mainstream news
[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:38.480]  between the clinton's and the obama crew well there's always been there's
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:42.080]  always been an internecine war going on between
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:45.840]  these two camps uh it's going to get worse when
[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:48.720]  biden announces we already saw a little bit of that
[02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:53.520]  from the hillary camp about the them saying by it was biden who leaked the
[02:45:53.520 --> 02:45:58.800]  information from his dying son uh bo bo biden who died
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:03.280]  of cancer that he wanted his dad to run for the presidency well we're gonna see
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:07.600]  if people are upset if the biden camp is upset over that from hillary
[02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:12.320]  they've they've seen nothing yet uh you know when you look at the two uh
[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:17.200]  who's who's worse well you know i think that's a an issue where you look at
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:21.120]  biden uh long time senator from delaware let's
[02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:25.680]  face it that's the philadelphia area you do not get elected to any
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:28.800]  office in in the delaware valley unless you got
[02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:33.920]  some ties uh to some sort of uh unsavory activity
[02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:39.280]  whether it's through unions or or the wealthy people in that area
[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:44.560]  businessmen it's going to be there but uh you know biden i i think we know what
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:48.400]  we're getting with biden we should know what we're getting with hillary but she
[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:53.680]  always surprises us with yet another scandal because she's so in your face
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:58.000]  with this stuff um she doesn't care and either does her husband
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:02.000]  they never cared about speaking of that here she was this weekend talking to one
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:07.120]  of her you know political minions uh saying it's a conspiracy theory
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:11.200]  that she had a second server and another email to cover stuff up i mean even
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:15.360]  the head of the epa uh had to step down when she got caught
[02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:19.600]  using a secret email i mean this is just just incredible
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:22.880]  uh and then she has the nerves just say she's the most transparent in history
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:28.480]  here it is gone further than anybody that i'm aware of in american history now
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:31.840]  that's not a long history because we haven't had emails that long but
[02:47:31.840 --> 02:47:36.080]  as long as we've had them i've gone longer and farther to try to
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:39.920]  be as transparent as possible nobody else has done that
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:42.880]  and then there's another clip where she goes on to say it's a conspiracy theory
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:46.240]  now there's conspiracy theorists out there that are saying all this
[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:50.800]  pretty arrogant well she used the term vass freight wing conspiracy remember
[02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:53.600]  when uh they were going after her husband for the
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:57.680]  total whitewater and lewinsky matter and and you know later we found out that
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:01.600]  was much worse than uh what was reported because bill clinton during his
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:06.880]  affair with monica lewinsky is even heard on on the uh on the transcripts
[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:10.400]  that in the in the in the in the tra in the depositions
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:14.480]  that he was worried that there was a foreign power listening in
[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:18.320]  uh to his phone calls with his girlfriend monica lewinsky
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:21.680]  and later on it was determined that that foreign power was the israeli
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:27.040]  intelligence service so i mean they always they always downplay
[02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:30.960]  uh their masters at this hillary learned a lot from her husband who
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:34.960]  really i think pioneered uh you know how to
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:37.840]  how to actually lie with a smile on your face
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:41.760]  and and she just got away with it in that clip they're trying to say she's
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:45.440]  been transparent well the entire obama administered
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:48.720]  administered most secret it's in the least transparent
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:54.000]  administration in art history you always have a lot of big stories you tell me
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  about off air that end up being print stories and info wars dot com
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.960]  uh what what are some of the other big stories you're working on right now
[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:04.480]  uh and some of the other big shoes you think are going to be dropping
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:07.920]  well i it's very interesting to see what's going on in the house now with
[02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:11.120]  kevin mccarthy who everybody thought was going to replace
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:14.720]  bainer as speaker now dropping out of that race
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:20.640]  i i i would look to see uh some real surprises in that in that donnie brook
[02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:25.120]  right now and one thing i can tell you is uh and this comes up from the
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:28.800]  out of the pope's visit uh to the capital and his speech
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:33.760]  before the joint session uh cnn had a had a hot mic
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:38.000]  present in a very restricted area and if you've ever been to capital hill
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:41.920]  and the house side you know you're not a lot and if you're not a member you
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:46.080]  you can't go into the um the actual well of the house
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:50.000]  representative you got to be a member or or an authorized staffer it's very
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:54.080]  restricted so outside outside the door is where the pope was
[02:49:54.080 --> 02:49:57.520]  going in and that area was highly restricted only because

[02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:22.960]  very soon i'll start announcing some of the AM FM new affiliates also the UHF
[02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:26.400]  VHF and cable that quite a lot of those signing on as we tweak some of our
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:28.960]  feeds and tones and digital things a lot of
[02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:32.400]  computer stuff involved in the face of this tyranny we're
[02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:34.880]  not putting on half measures we're really
[02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:38.880]  trying to stop it and Wayne uh congress has a nine percent approval
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:41.200]  rating running for about three years now
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:45.280]  Obama has one of the lowest ever as the republican leadership does
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:49.280]  despite all the big police state builds up
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:53.200]  that we see there is a lot of signs of good things happening our military
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:55.920]  doesn't want to be part of what we're throwing aside
[02:54:55.920 --> 02:55:01.600]  the Russians have come in to stand up against this very popular with Americans
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:04.560]  there is some good things happening i mean it seems there's got to be some
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:08.000]  into the corruption and the flim flam and the fluff
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:11.760]  they may have half the public part republican part democrat totally dumb
[02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:14.160]  down and stupid they may have brought in 40 million
[02:55:14.160 --> 02:55:16.960]  people that aren't really Americans and are confused
[02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:20.880]  but still at the end of the day there are a lot of folks of every race color and
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:24.160]  creed and religion or they'd be christian muslim or agnostic
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:29.200]  or jewish or whatever who realize we've really got crazy corruption going on
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:33.600]  and now the economy's getting ready to collapse all that news is there
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:36.400]  i mean confidence in this system is about to go down
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:40.560]  and no amount of slick talk is going to put it back together again
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:45.120]  well that's right and we know that the head of the defense intelligence agency
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:48.720]  the former head lieutenant general michael flinn
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:51.600]  was fired last year because he objected to the
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:55.120]  u.s. supporting the most radical jihadists in syria
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:55:58.320]  most of which as i mentioned are non-aribs they're
[02:55:58.320 --> 02:56:02.080]  they're chechens they're Uighurs from western china
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:08.000]  they're even recruiting people from indonesia to go and move to syria and
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:12.800]  iraq to to take this land over for the islamic caliphate
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:17.440]  there are people i know and i've heard from them directly in the cia
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:20.400]  who do believe that john brennan the director
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:24.880]  is too pro-saudi so i know there was a former fbi agent i believe his name is
[02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:27.200]  john guandalo who said that he thought that
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:30.320]  brennan converted to wahhabist islam when he was
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:35.520]  the cia station chief in riyadh now at the you you don't have to convert to show
[02:56:35.520 --> 02:56:38.800]  that you're at least sympathetic to their cause this is one of the most
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:42.240]  radical forms of islam there is if not the most
[02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:45.760]  got the saudi backing in trillions so why not sign on to it
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:48.880]  absolutely and and that and you know which with brennan
[02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:52.800]  uh... training uh... these uh... jihadists and
[02:56:52.800 --> 02:56:56.480]  secret camps and and turkey and cutter and
[02:56:56.480 --> 02:57:00.480]  saudi which clear a large faction of the globalists are not just trying to
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:04.160]  create a class of civilizations they're going past the bushes and cheney
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:06.640]  and they're going why don't we just take over
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:09.360]  absolutely so you got a lot of these jihadists
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:12.480]  trained by the cia now showing up in europe
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:16.400]  uh... young men was felt you know with cell phones refugees with cell phones
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:19.360]  htm cards and a lot of cash where they're getting
[02:57:19.360 --> 02:57:22.160]  that from and uh... they've already had horrendous
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:25.920]  rapes uh... reported in germany and austria
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:29.280]  uh... they've had uh... there were germans on the street in munich for
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:34.560]  october fest you were confronted by these muslims uh... jihadist type
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:37.600]  uh... radicals saying put the beer away do not drink
[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:40.800]  anybody comes up says put my beer down or my pretzel i'm gonna punch them in the
[02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:43.280]  nose i don't care who they are you can imagine what
[02:57:43.280 --> 02:57:47.200]  happened in munich during october fest when some big germans were told to do
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:51.520]  that there were riot brawls on the street as you can imagine but
[02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:55.600]  as they're talking about angela merkel who was responsible for this mess
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:57:59.840]  getting the nobel peace prize so so so
[02:57:59.840 --> 02:58:02.560]  why don't you do five more minutes and then um
[02:58:02.560 --> 02:58:05.440]  have a nice taking over i wanted to kick it in was he's got a big show lined up
[02:58:05.440 --> 02:58:08.720]  but five more minutes to have you kind of confirming what the last guest was
[02:58:08.720 --> 02:58:12.480]  saying i mean it's definitely a triple cross here
[02:58:12.480 --> 02:58:16.400]  and i don't know i mean why would they want to bring in hundreds of thousands
[02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:20.560]  of jihadis clearly that are sleeper cells is it to menace europe
[02:58:20.560 --> 02:58:24.000]  then take all the rights because of the threat and persecute muslims
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:29.360]  or is it a in game to actually repopulate the world with the giant muslim
[02:58:29.360 --> 02:58:33.200]  population i mean this is just over at the top
[02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:36.800]  because they're telling germans you can't wear a skirt i mean you know it's
[02:58:36.800 --> 02:58:40.240]  it's it's clobbering time folks we'll be back stay with us thank you for

[03:00:09.440 --> 03:00:18.000]  and the gcn radio network broadcasting worldwide ladies and gentlemen
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:21.280]  final segment i'm gonna hand the baton off to david night in
[03:00:21.280 --> 03:00:25.840]  the situation room if we call this the situation room or that studio i haven't
[03:00:25.840 --> 03:00:27.520]  come up with the right names for it yet
[03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:32.240]  wane madson's our guest if we follow the saudi british intelligence neocon
[03:00:32.240 --> 03:00:35.360]  globalist pattern we know a lot of neocons are advising obama
[03:00:35.360 --> 03:00:39.760]  it's a very sick mix of socialist communists mega bankers ultra rich
[03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:42.880]  hollywood types and neocon trotskyite
[03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:49.440]  dr strangelove people if they follow the past pattern
[03:00:49.440 --> 03:00:52.560]  they'll flood us with a bunch of radical muslims they'll shoot up a bunch of
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:58.240]  churches stores malls synagogues military bases recruiting centers
[03:00:58.240 --> 03:01:02.560]  everybody's gonna get mad there'll be a big deportation that's for show big
[03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:07.520]  walls built that are keep us in and then they'll use that crisis for more
[03:01:07.520 --> 03:01:10.800]  draconian police state then there'll be a class of civilizations and we won't
[03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:14.400]  go out for saudi arabia that quarter back to their turkey that you know help
[03:01:14.400 --> 03:01:18.240]  do it it'll be you know blame iran or blame you
[03:01:18.240 --> 03:01:22.080]  know some other country that wasn't part of it just like 911 with iraq
[03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:25.200]  and i think that's probably what's happening but then i see
[03:01:25.200 --> 03:01:30.160]  the size of the influx and a lot of the other behavior and saudi arabia is so
[03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:33.920]  pleased and it makes me think it might be something else wane
[03:01:33.920 --> 03:01:36.800]  we got four minutes left what do you really think is going on
[03:01:36.800 --> 03:01:41.440]  well we know that saudi arabia offered to build 200 mosques for the muslims in
[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:44.400]  germany and that's an indication that they expect
[03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:49.520]  these people to stay permanently we're talking about anywhere from 1.5 to 3
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:53.760]  million refugees just for from syria alone
[03:01:53.760 --> 03:01:57.680]  that doesn't count the ones that are taking advantage of europe dropping its
[03:01:57.680 --> 03:02:01.920]  border restrictions that are coming in from north africa sub-sahara africa
[03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:05.200]  uh south asia afghanistan pakistan as far away as
[03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:10.080]  bangladesh uh coming to europe taking advantage of the situation
[03:02:10.080 --> 03:02:14.960]  so so merkel who who is the most unpopular chancellor in germany
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:19.040]  right now and you might say even probably right now even more unpopular
[03:02:19.040 --> 03:02:22.400]  than atall fitler was even when they started losing
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:26.800]  on the battlefield they're talking about her getting a nobel peace prize
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:30.320]  of course henry kissinger got that and a couple other undeserving
[03:02:30.320 --> 03:02:35.760]  al-gore al-akadama al-abama right who uh you know we just had the
[03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:39.840]  bombing of the the hospital in afghanistan and he thinks he
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:43.200]  you know because he has a nobel peace prize just an apology
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:46.800]  to the doctors without borders will suffice but um
[03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:50.960]  anyway it is a huge mess but look the reason russia
[03:02:50.960 --> 03:02:56.080]  and china and iran are sending troops to syria that's their line in the sand
[03:02:56.080 --> 03:03:00.720]  they do not want to see in moscow beijing and tehran what's happening on the
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:04.800]  streets of munich hamburg vienna and budapest they
[03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:07.520]  do not sure they know it's a destabilization program that have
[03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:10.720]  said that and they're circling the wagons and russia's
[03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:14.880]  deploying their most sophisticated military forces to syria
[03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:18.080]  and now to iraq because iraq has now asked for
[03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:21.920]  russian uh military intervention there against isis because
[03:03:21.920 --> 03:03:25.680]  we have not been battling isis we've been supporting them training isn't the
[03:03:25.680 --> 03:03:28.960]  breakdown of the narrative show one of the biggest defeats for the globalist
[03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:33.200]  in a long time jill scousen says it's a stunning victory against the new world
[03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:38.480]  order yes yes absolutely so i i see um i see
[03:03:38.480 --> 03:03:42.480]  nato uh complaining about this because nato is nothing more than the
[03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:46.400]  gendarmes or the centurions for the european
[03:03:46.400 --> 03:03:50.000]  central banks i mean they're the enforcement they're the pretorian
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:53.520]  guard yes and uh and and and one of the reasons
[03:03:53.520 --> 03:03:57.040]  i'm told is why uh merkel has allowed this influx is they
[03:03:57.040 --> 03:04:01.120]  know that the eu is is days are numbered and this is a way to
[03:04:01.120 --> 03:04:04.720]  eventually uh impose some sort of martial law
[03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:07.760]  in europe yeah three countries are saying they're going to leave the euro
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:11.280]  over this i mean this is just crazy this this shows
[03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:14.800]  how people running the west really want to destroy it and break it
[03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:18.400]  when they're in control of it uh it's it's it's it's total mental illness wane

[03:08:03.920 --> 03:08:15.600]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[03:08:18.160 --> 03:08:22.720]  this monday october 8th 2015 i'm david night your host
[03:08:22.720 --> 03:08:25.920]  we have a lot of things to talk about of course there were some major developments
[03:08:25.920 --> 03:08:31.120]  in the race for gop leadership this is a very very important development
[03:08:31.120 --> 03:08:34.720]  it's a very very important position you have to understand speaker of the house
[03:08:34.720 --> 03:08:39.200]  is third in line to the presidency just below the vice president
[03:08:39.200 --> 03:08:43.280]  so this is a very powerful position we've seen this used in a very powerful way
[03:08:43.280 --> 03:08:49.840]  by john bainer to shut down any opposition to the bipartisan agenda
[03:08:49.840 --> 03:08:54.000]  that is going through with both the bainer and the leaders of the gop
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:58.400]  so this development that happened today with the number two that was selected for
[03:08:58.400 --> 03:09:01.680]  bainer they were trying to push him in we had just yesterday
[03:09:01.680 --> 03:09:05.200]  at nine o'clock last night an article came out that dick cheney
[03:09:05.200 --> 03:09:08.720]  was pushing kevin mccarthy the house majority leader that's the number two
[03:09:08.720 --> 03:09:12.400]  position pushing him to take bainer's place as
[03:09:12.400 --> 03:09:16.400]  speaker of the house today that all collapsed we're going to talk about that
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:20.880]  we also have information on thyroid cancer in children
[03:09:20.880 --> 03:09:24.560]  is skyrocketing near fukushima we have the supreme court
[03:09:24.560 --> 03:09:28.560]  saying that forced vaccines for children don't violate their rights either
[03:09:28.560 --> 03:09:33.680]  okay forget about informed consent okay and you have to understand
[03:09:33.680 --> 03:09:38.160]  whatever your position is on vaccines you should be scared to death
[03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:41.280]  of the fact that the government is taking away our informed consent
[03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:45.440]  that should frighten you regardless of what you believe in terms of the science
[03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:48.880]  we were warned by one of the founders benjamin rush that if we did not
[03:09:48.880 --> 03:09:54.240]  specifically protect our freedom to have our medical freedom
[03:09:54.240 --> 03:09:57.760]  that we would lose it to a medical tyranny
[03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:01.440]  an organized collective you know something like big pharma
[03:10:01.440 --> 03:10:04.960]  and the am a we're now seeing that coming through we're also going to talk
[03:10:04.960 --> 03:10:08.800]  about a giant city that's being built by a multinational defense
[03:10:08.800 --> 03:10:12.320]  corporation it's going to be something that's going to war game against the
[03:10:12.320 --> 03:10:15.680]  american citizens folks that's what this is really about
[03:10:15.680 --> 03:10:19.200]  developing a lot of technologies that security technologies
[03:10:19.200 --> 03:10:22.240]  self-driving transportation technologies which is about
[03:10:22.240 --> 03:10:27.520]  control of your movements also surveillance technology this is a major defense
[03:10:27.520 --> 03:10:30.160]  contractor they're building a billion dollar city
[03:10:30.160 --> 03:10:34.480]  35 000 people it could hold but they're not going to have any humans in it
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:38.160]  they'll also be able to experiment with robots they say in this area
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:42.320]  let me tell you what this is a city with the details all the way down to church
[03:10:42.320 --> 03:10:44.560]  buildings some other things like that you don't need that
[03:10:44.560 --> 03:10:49.520]  if you got a self-driving car testbed you don't need to have that
[03:10:49.520 --> 03:10:53.760]  but for other things like asymmetric warfare yeah you do need to have that
[03:10:53.760 --> 03:10:56.880]  if you want a really war game against the american people and we've seen this
[03:10:56.880 --> 03:11:01.360]  i went to fort ap hill in virginia with joe bigs we walked
[03:11:01.360 --> 03:11:05.680]  through a small ghost town a city that was set up for the military and the
[03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:09.200]  police to train against the american people there are other sites in other
[03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:12.960]  military bases like camp lejeune that are more rural more suburban this one
[03:11:12.960 --> 03:11:16.080]  is going to have everything this is something that they've been working on
[03:11:16.080 --> 03:11:19.120]  since 2011 there's been stories going back a couple years
[03:11:19.120 --> 03:11:22.400]  about this it was interesting because yesterday
[03:11:22.400 --> 03:11:25.520]  there was a slew of stories that came out about this
[03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:29.280]  cnn forbes daily mail showing pictures talking about what they're going to
[03:11:29.280 --> 03:11:33.280]  build so it's close being upon us also we're going to talk
[03:11:33.280 --> 03:11:37.520]  about how the police are using private databases to skirt the law yet
[03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:40.960]  again we see this kind of structure where they
[03:11:40.960 --> 03:11:44.000]  say that this is data that belongs to a private corporation
[03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:47.200]  and if the private corporation is collecting data on you
[03:11:47.200 --> 03:11:50.480]  then that data on you belongs to the private corporation and they don't have
[03:11:50.480 --> 03:11:55.200]  to get a search warrant to share it that is the the legal fiction
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:11:58.240]  that we need to correct there's so many things that need to be fixed in this
[03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:01.600]  country we need to get back to the constitution and again that brings us
[03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:05.120]  back to this speaker race and i want to get to that in just a moment break that
[03:12:05.120 --> 03:12:08.160]  down in detail what's going on with it what could happen in the future first

[03:12:35.200 --> 03:12:43.280]  dot com excuse me now before we go back to the speaker race i want to
[03:12:43.280 --> 03:12:46.400]  read you an article that came up yesterday i thought was really brilliant
[03:12:46.400 --> 03:12:50.000]  satire actually that reason magazine did it was linked on the drudge report how
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:53.840]  to create a gun-free society in just five easy steps
[03:12:53.840 --> 03:12:58.480]  well the first one is you've got to elect enough senators and representatives
[03:12:58.480 --> 03:13:02.480]  to get on your side to amend the constitution then you have to propose
[03:13:02.480 --> 03:13:05.920]  that amendment you have to ratify that amendment then you need to
[03:13:05.920 --> 03:13:10.400]  legislate what they call quote unquote common sense gun reform
[03:13:10.400 --> 03:13:13.840]  well you can try to do as they say what australia did and ban all guns but
[03:13:13.840 --> 03:13:16.640]  that's not at all what they did but whatever
[03:13:16.640 --> 03:13:20.000]  right they say go go big or go home so anyway you're going to get your
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:25.760]  legislation but then comes step five how are you going to enforce
[03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:29.440]  your complete gun ban well i say guns won't just
[03:13:29.440 --> 03:13:32.880]  disappear because you passed a law you know you're going to need to confiscate
[03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:36.480]  some 350 million guns scattered amongst
[03:13:36.480 --> 03:13:40.880]  330 million americans sure you can try buyback program like australia
[03:13:40.880 --> 03:13:44.160]  but like australia that'll still leave behind
[03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:48.240]  60 to 80 percent of the privately owned firearms the rest of those
[03:13:48.240 --> 03:13:53.200]  you're going to have to take now they say you can use the police the fbi the atf
[03:13:53.200 --> 03:13:57.200]  the national guard they're all known for their nuanced approach to
[03:13:57.200 --> 03:14:00.880]  potentially dangerous situations of that center
[03:14:00.880 --> 03:14:05.360]  they go you can have them go door to door through 3.8 million square miles of
[03:14:05.360 --> 03:14:07.920]  this country can have them try to take the guns
[03:14:07.920 --> 03:14:13.440]  by force from thousands if not millions of well armed individuals many of whom
[03:14:13.440 --> 03:14:19.520]  would rather start a civil war than acquiesce so inevitably gun
[03:14:19.520 --> 03:14:22.640]  violence which is really what you're trying to stop right and it's
[03:14:22.640 --> 03:14:26.800]  currently at an historic low will skyrocket but that's how you get a gun
[03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:29.680]  free america let me tell you something you know when
[03:14:29.680 --> 03:14:34.080]  quomo governor quomo says he he thinks that we need to shut down the federal
[03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:38.160]  government until we ban guns let me tell governor quomo and
[03:14:38.160 --> 03:14:41.520]  obama if you want to try to take our guns we'll shut the government down for
[03:14:41.520 --> 03:14:45.040]  you okay there are many people who will
[03:14:45.040 --> 03:14:49.360]  who would rather have a civil war than to lose their right to keep and bear
[03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:53.600]  arms because that is fundamental to our freedom as individuals
[03:14:53.600 --> 03:14:56.960]  is something that is recognized in the constitution and until you get rid of
[03:14:56.960 --> 03:15:00.000]  the constitution you're not going to get them and when you get rid of the
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:02.880]  constitution then we've got something to talk about
[03:15:02.880 --> 03:15:07.840]  we don't want that to happen how do we stop a civil war from happening
[03:15:07.840 --> 03:15:12.800]  we have to stop it by stopping this kind of movement this kind of political
[03:15:12.800 --> 03:15:16.640]  politicization of the constitution that tried trying to remove the second
[03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:21.600]  amendment one of the ways that we need to stop this of course is by
[03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:25.200]  getting involved right now the house GOP leadership
[03:15:25.200 --> 03:15:30.560]  which has been thoroughly on board with obama and the democrats on their
[03:15:30.560 --> 03:15:36.400]  shared agendas whether it's obama care whether it's the trans-pacific
[03:15:36.400 --> 03:15:39.920]  partnership these guys are all on the same page
[03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:43.440]  and we have an opportunity right now i think many people don't realize how
[03:15:43.440 --> 03:15:46.640]  good this opportunity is as i put it out at the beginning of the
[03:15:46.640 --> 03:15:50.320]  segment dick cheney yesterday at 9 30 was endorsing
[03:15:50.320 --> 03:15:54.160]  kevin mccarthy he says we are in one of the most difficult and challenging
[03:15:54.160 --> 03:15:56.720]  periods of our history well dick cheney was right about that
[03:15:56.720 --> 03:15:59.680]  and one of the reasons that we're in that kind of a position is because of
[03:15:59.680 --> 03:16:03.360]  people like dick cheney he says it's more important than ever that we have
[03:16:03.360 --> 03:16:06.480]  strong conservative leadership in the house of representatives
[03:16:06.480 --> 03:16:10.400]  that's right and that's not what kevin mccarthy
[03:16:10.400 --> 03:16:14.160]  or john bainer represent now let me give you a little bit of history here
[03:16:14.160 --> 03:16:16.960]  because you need to think about this and understand
[03:16:16.960 --> 03:16:21.120]  that we really do have an opportunity to jump in here for a big
[03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:25.840]  win remember that eric canter in the last election
[03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:29.440]  he was a previous house majority leader that's the number two position in the
[03:16:29.440 --> 03:16:32.800]  house you have house speakers the top position then house leader
[03:16:32.800 --> 03:16:36.480]  he lost his reelection bid to a complete unknown
[03:16:36.480 --> 03:16:41.040]  that he outspent 40 to 1 this guy was an economics professor
[03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:44.960]  but he allied himself with the tea party people understood that he was a true
[03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:47.680]  conservative and they were fed up with people like
[03:16:47.680 --> 03:16:52.240]  eric canter and john bainer and paul ryan and dick
[03:16:52.240 --> 03:16:56.320]  cheney who have sold us down the river telling us that they stand for one thing
[03:16:56.320 --> 03:17:00.400]  and then voting with the democrats repeatedly so
[03:17:00.400 --> 03:17:04.160]  canter in spite of being in spite of outspending his opponent 40 to 1
[03:17:04.160 --> 03:17:07.760]  resigned and guess what he went to work for an investment bank
[03:17:07.760 --> 03:17:11.760]  immediately i don't know that he went to work for them or
[03:17:11.760 --> 03:17:16.800]  maybe he just changed his job title from consultant in congress to
[03:17:16.800 --> 03:17:20.640]  vice chairman but that's where he went this is the first time
[03:17:20.640 --> 03:17:24.960]  a sitting house majority leader had lost their seat
[03:17:24.960 --> 03:17:31.520]  since 1899 it can be done a small determined number of people can affect
[03:17:31.520 --> 03:17:35.520]  change we can get these people out now
[03:17:35.520 --> 03:17:39.200]  what about john bainer when they elected the
[03:17:39.200 --> 03:17:43.280]  republicans and they had a larger majority in the house they had a majority
[03:17:43.280 --> 03:17:45.920]  in the senate and bainer and mcconnell chose to do
[03:17:45.920 --> 03:17:48.480]  nothing about open borders chose to do nothing about
[03:17:48.480 --> 03:17:52.880]  obama care back in january a representative name
[03:17:52.880 --> 03:17:57.280]  daniel webster ran against john bainer only got 12 votes but still
[03:17:57.280 --> 03:18:00.800]  that's i think important when you stand up
[03:18:00.800 --> 03:18:04.000]  and speak truth to power when you stand against power
[03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:07.040]  even when you know you're going to lose i think that shows
[03:18:07.040 --> 03:18:10.880]  someone with backbone he's now running again
[03:18:10.880 --> 03:18:14.960]  and he was dismissed as being somebody that had absolutely no chance we were
[03:18:14.960 --> 03:18:18.480]  told that kevin mccarthy was going to be a shoe in because he was the guy that
[03:18:18.480 --> 03:18:21.760]  was picked to replace eric canter he was the hand
[03:18:21.760 --> 03:18:26.400]  picked successor to john bainer by the leadership
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:29.920]  then go to this summer just before they went to
[03:18:29.920 --> 03:18:35.120]  recess mark meadows introduced a vacate the chair motion remember that
[03:18:35.120 --> 03:18:38.560]  vacate the chair john bainer stepped down that we have no confidence in you
[03:18:38.560 --> 03:18:42.080]  at first we were told by the mainstream media this is a joke
[03:18:42.080 --> 03:18:46.080]  it's not going anywhere this has no chance of succeeding
[03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:50.640]  surprisingly they did a headcount and they found they didn't have the votes
[03:18:50.640 --> 03:18:54.560]  so they put this off until after recess thinking i guess that they could twist
[03:18:54.560 --> 03:18:59.440]  some arms during summer recess and get it back
[03:18:59.440 --> 03:19:03.040]  then we had a surprise resignation by bainer
[03:19:03.040 --> 03:19:07.840]  immediately after the pope's visit and we were told though that kevin mccarthy
[03:19:07.840 --> 03:19:11.360]  was going to be the number two guy then about a week ago
[03:19:11.360 --> 03:19:15.040]  kevin mccarthy goes on the shan hannity show and he admits that
[03:19:15.040 --> 03:19:19.040]  ben gazi the ben gazi investigation was nothing more
[03:19:19.040 --> 03:19:22.960]  than a political move and i agree with that i think that's
[03:19:22.960 --> 03:19:26.720]  absolutely true on his part at least i think there were people who really
[03:19:26.720 --> 03:19:30.080]  wanted to investigate this who really wanted to prosecute the crimes
[03:19:30.080 --> 03:19:33.360]  those are the people who are now aligning to get these people out but you
[03:19:33.360 --> 03:19:36.000]  know we've said over and over again with all these
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:39.440]  investigations of obama of eric holder of hillary clinton
[03:19:39.440 --> 03:19:43.200]  they really don't want to get them out of office they don't want to impeach them
[03:19:43.200 --> 03:19:46.640]  they don't want to put them in jail they don't want to
[03:19:46.640 --> 03:19:49.600]  reform the government they just want to score cheap
[03:19:49.600 --> 03:19:52.880]  political points and so we had an admission of that now there are people
[03:19:52.880 --> 03:19:56.000]  who are calling for an ethics investigation hillary clinton is able
[03:19:56.000 --> 03:19:58.480]  to portray herself as a victim and not a criminal
[03:19:58.480 --> 03:20:02.080]  and then we have a major development today we'll talk about when we come back

[03:24:17.840 --> 03:24:21.360]  going on in the house race this is something that is very very important
[03:24:21.360 --> 03:24:25.120]  it's an opportunity for you to get involved and have impact on something
[03:24:25.120 --> 03:24:29.040]  that is far more imminent and and every bit as important as a
[03:24:29.040 --> 03:24:32.400]  presidential race get involved contact your congressman we're
[03:24:32.400 --> 03:24:35.520]  going to talk about who the players are here understand this is going to happen
[03:24:35.520 --> 03:24:38.880]  within the next month this is coming up very quickly the
[03:24:38.880 --> 03:24:41.520]  presidential race if you want to get involved in that if you think that makes
[03:24:41.520 --> 03:24:44.960]  a big difference and it does in a couple of different issues most issues
[03:24:44.960 --> 03:24:48.480]  there's not much difference there but you've got an entire year to look at
[03:24:48.480 --> 03:24:51.600]  that this is going to happen very quickly we have a block of
[03:24:51.600 --> 03:24:54.960]  conservatives who are standing together like they're at the alamo here against
[03:24:54.960 --> 03:24:59.280]  the unified party leadership of both parties and this is
[03:24:59.280 --> 03:25:02.240]  something that is very important on a number of different issues
[03:25:02.240 --> 03:25:06.080]  even people who are democrats need to get involved in this because
[03:25:06.080 --> 03:25:09.760]  this is going to affect the trans-pacific partnership that is coming up the
[03:25:09.760 --> 03:25:12.720]  transatlantic partnerships and many other trade
[03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:16.800]  situations that are coming down the pike that really don't have anything to do
[03:25:16.800 --> 03:25:21.920]  with free trade we need to make common cause on the fact that this is not
[03:25:21.920 --> 03:25:26.000]  about free trade versus unions versus any of these economic issues or even
[03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:29.680]  corporations versus exporting jobs this is about
[03:25:29.680 --> 03:25:32.720]  global governance this is about losing our sovereignty
[03:25:32.720 --> 03:25:35.840]  this is about corporations taking over our government
[03:25:35.840 --> 03:25:39.120]  they said they reached an agreement several days ago have you seen it yet
[03:25:39.120 --> 03:25:44.320]  no but i've seen a lot of comments from the corporations and from their
[03:25:44.320 --> 03:25:47.600]  representatives in congress because that's who they represent they don't
[03:25:47.600 --> 03:25:50.880]  represent you these people at the top talking about how they didn't like this
[03:25:50.880 --> 03:25:53.680]  or they didn't like that they know exactly what's in it because they wrote
[03:25:53.680 --> 03:25:56.320]  it and they haven't bothered to show it to you yet
[03:25:56.320 --> 03:25:59.360]  because they don't think you matter they don't think you're a stakeholder
[03:25:59.360 --> 03:26:02.640]  i want to get back to this but before i do i've got leon macadoo joining me
[03:26:02.640 --> 03:26:05.520]  usually we do this at the very end of the show talk about what's coming up on
[03:26:05.520 --> 03:26:08.160]  the nightly news leon's coming in early to talk to me
[03:26:08.160 --> 03:26:11.440]  because she's got a lot of very interesting interviews lined up for
[03:26:11.440 --> 03:26:14.720]  tonight's nightly news tell us about it yeah it'll be a jam-packed show tonight
[03:26:14.720 --> 03:26:19.680]  for sure obviously we're going to be talking about hillary's flip-flop on the tpp
[03:26:19.680 --> 03:26:24.000]  as well we'll be speaking with wane madson i'm gonna dig deep into this
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:28.480]  shadow government that seems to be run out of hillary clinton state department
[03:26:28.480 --> 03:26:31.680]  and of course you know let's just go back to
[03:26:31.680 --> 03:26:37.200]  donald rumsfeld and his famous well there might be 2.3 trillion dollars
[03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:40.720]  unaccounted for and then boom the next day 9 11 happens
[03:26:40.720 --> 03:26:44.800]  so we know these the shadow government this type of stuff and these
[03:26:44.800 --> 03:26:48.960]  misplacement of funds has been going on for a long time so we're going to dig
[03:26:48.960 --> 03:26:52.000]  into that i'm also going to be speaking with richard gage
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:57.120]  they're premiering their documentary firefighters architects and engineers
[03:26:57.120 --> 03:27:01.360]  expose the myths of 9 11 and i'm i'm really excited to talk to richard
[03:27:01.360 --> 03:27:04.960]  gauges is the head of that organization yes x engineers
[03:27:04.960 --> 03:27:08.560]  9 11 housing 9 11 yes absolutely and i'm really
[03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:11.680]  excited to get to speak with him because they're they were just
[03:27:11.680 --> 03:27:16.160]  at a two-day event it was an annual summit of the national council of
[03:27:16.160 --> 03:27:20.400]  structural engineers association so they set up a booth there
[03:27:20.400 --> 03:27:24.640]  for the architects and engineers 9 11 truth set up a booth there with
[03:27:24.640 --> 03:27:27.760]  more than a thousand structural engineers attending this event
[03:27:27.760 --> 03:27:31.680]  so i'm i'm interested to see what they had to say bringing this message to a
[03:27:31.680 --> 03:27:34.880]  larger group of people very much so because you know we look at that
[03:27:34.880 --> 03:27:38.880]  and look at the official conspiracy theory that these buildings
[03:27:38.880 --> 03:27:43.520]  just fell down that two of them were hit by planes and subsequently fell down
[03:27:43.520 --> 03:27:47.760]  from a fire and a third building which wasn't even hit by a plane but again
[03:27:47.760 --> 03:27:51.440]  a steel skyscraper just fell down on its own
[03:27:51.440 --> 03:27:55.360]  and we understand that going back many many decades the empire state building
[03:27:55.360 --> 03:27:58.880]  was struck by a plane nothing happened to it we've seen fires with
[03:27:58.880 --> 03:28:02.320]  with buildings over and over again and after the empire state building was
[03:28:02.320 --> 03:28:05.440]  struck with a plane they had to build these things to code
[03:28:05.440 --> 03:28:09.040]  so that they wouldn't fall down when they were hit with a plane of course they
[03:28:09.040 --> 03:28:12.480]  didn't topple over it just collapsed as a controlled
[03:28:12.480 --> 03:28:16.560]  demolition but isn't that also interesting if anybody wants to
[03:28:16.560 --> 03:28:19.600]  buy into the official conspiracy theory isn't it interesting
[03:28:19.600 --> 03:28:24.000]  that there haven't been any lawsuits against the engineers who designed
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:27.280]  these buildings right we're not designing them to withstand what
[03:28:27.280 --> 03:28:30.080]  everybody knew was a threat which is part of the building code
[03:28:30.080 --> 03:28:33.600]  right i just it's so amazing on so many different levels
[03:28:33.600 --> 03:28:37.120]  that they could get away with this and that people would just buy into this
[03:28:37.120 --> 03:28:40.720]  and we've got engineers and architects for 9-11 truth we've got pilots for 9-11
[03:28:40.720 --> 03:28:45.360]  truth saying planes can't fly at that speed at that altitude and over and
[03:28:45.360 --> 03:28:49.360]  over again experts who know their field and yet it's so difficult to get people
[03:28:49.360 --> 03:28:52.160]  to listen to anything other than the official conspiracy
[03:28:52.160 --> 03:28:55.280]  theory of the government right exactly and now firefighters as well coming out
[03:28:55.280 --> 03:28:58.640]  and speaking out about this a lot of people you know yeah it's 14 years later
[03:28:58.640 --> 03:29:02.480]  but this story isn't going away and now finally people are speaking out about it
[03:29:02.480 --> 03:29:06.160]  and to get rid of that sickness of the american people that matt drudge spoke
[03:29:06.160 --> 03:29:10.000]  about um and then also with this sp277 going on
[03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:13.680]  in california the mandatory vaccines i'm also going to be seeking with jeffrey
[03:29:13.680 --> 03:29:17.600]  jackson of jeffrey jackson dot com we're going to be talking about is
[03:29:17.600 --> 03:29:22.000]  removing your child from a vaccine tracking system an option
[03:29:22.000 --> 03:29:26.720]  very very important again important to see these interviews tonight uh leon
[03:29:26.720 --> 03:29:29.440]  macadoo is going to be doing that the nightly news we just had an article
[03:29:29.440 --> 03:29:32.080]  today we'll talk about this a little bit more supreme court says mandatory
[03:29:32.080 --> 03:29:34.960]  vaccines don't violate children's constitutional rights
[03:29:34.960 --> 03:29:38.720]  really really we'll see about that stay with us we'll be right back
[03:29:38.720 --> 03:29:41.200]  thanks leon
[03:29:48.400 --> 03:29:52.240]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:52.240 --> 03:29:58.960]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:58.960 --> 03:30:02.320]  presidential candidates today strategize over every last
[03:30:02.320 --> 03:30:05.920]  detail of a candidate's image especially an identity candidate
[03:30:05.920 --> 03:30:09.680]  like hillary how important is it for there to be a woman president
[03:30:09.680 --> 03:30:14.080]  in the united states national journal has pointed out that candidates now view
[03:30:14.080 --> 03:30:18.400]  soundtracks as a key part of that carefully crafted image
[03:30:18.400 --> 03:30:22.400]  so maybe hillary should choose a campaign song that plays against
[03:30:22.400 --> 03:30:29.440]  type you know humble i'm sorry hillary has paid a consulting firm
[03:30:29.440 --> 03:30:33.280]  nine thousand dollars to create a soundtrack for her campaign
[03:30:33.280 --> 03:30:36.640]  i just don't think people would believe this song though
[03:30:36.640 --> 03:30:40.800]  she's being abandoned by unions by multinational corporate donors who are
[03:30:40.800 --> 03:30:44.400]  worried 44 percent of her twitter followers
[03:30:44.400 --> 03:30:50.480]  1.4 million are fake maybe her campaign theme should be
[03:30:50.480 --> 03:30:54.400]  i need somebody help not just anybody

[03:33:08.240 --> 03:33:17.280]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:33:17.280 --> 03:33:20.400]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this
[03:33:20.400 --> 03:33:25.280]  thursday october 8th 2015 this is the fourth hour the news wrap up i want to
[03:33:25.280 --> 03:33:29.520]  talk to you about something that is very very important an opportunity for
[03:33:29.520 --> 03:33:32.880]  you to get involved in a way that really matters
[03:33:32.880 --> 03:33:37.440]  and we've been talking about the fact that we're looking at the house
[03:33:37.440 --> 03:33:42.000]  trying to find a replacement for john bainer it was a conservative victory
[03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:45.920]  to get john bainer out and today we had his
[03:33:45.920 --> 03:33:50.240]  handpicked successor bow out of the race as well
[03:33:50.240 --> 03:33:54.480]  so we need to look carefully at who's in the mix and look at how this developed
[03:33:54.480 --> 03:33:57.760]  i think it's very telling to see how this developed it shows that we have an
[03:33:57.760 --> 03:34:02.720]  opportunity to really change fundamentally the direction of
[03:34:02.720 --> 03:34:06.480]  the house gop and that would make a big difference
[03:34:06.480 --> 03:34:10.400]  in getting some opposition to the current bipartisan
[03:34:10.400 --> 03:34:14.720]  agenda that is taking us down the road to servitude
[03:34:14.720 --> 03:34:18.960]  now just yesterday we were seeing articles like this on cnn house republicans
[03:34:18.960 --> 03:34:23.280]  are poised to select the speaker nominee they all believe that it was going to be
[03:34:23.280 --> 03:34:28.160]  kevin mccarthy we had uh we had dick cheney endorsing kevin mccarthy we're
[03:34:28.160 --> 03:34:31.760]  told by all the mainstream media fox news cnn and all them oh yeah he's a shoe
[03:34:31.760 --> 03:34:34.240]  end he's going to he's going to be the guy that's going to come in
[03:34:34.240 --> 03:34:38.080]  we had a guy jump in this last sunday jason chaffetz
[03:34:38.080 --> 03:34:41.840]  out of utah he said he didn't think that kevin mccarthy had the votes so he
[03:34:41.840 --> 03:34:45.040]  offered himself well we're going to talk about him in
[03:34:45.040 --> 03:34:49.280]  just a moment but i want to focus on the conservatives reaction
[03:34:49.280 --> 03:34:52.320]  because as all this was happening yesterday is the mainstream media was
[03:34:52.320 --> 03:34:55.120]  telling us that kevin mccarthy had the votes it was going to be
[03:34:55.120 --> 03:34:58.000]  done today going to be done this morning to be finished
[03:34:58.000 --> 03:35:01.280]  we saw a different story coming from some channels
[03:35:01.280 --> 03:35:05.120]  we saw an article that said uh conservatives
[03:35:05.120 --> 03:35:09.520]  insist that kevin mccarthy is not certain to become a speaker
[03:35:09.520 --> 03:35:13.040]  they said that uh the house freedom conference spokesperson
[03:35:13.040 --> 03:35:17.440]  the leader jordan the groups chairman said we have every intention of voting
[03:35:17.440 --> 03:35:20.960]  together we need to understand that this is a fluid situation
[03:35:20.960 --> 03:35:24.640]  later in the night we saw reports that said that the house freedom caucus
[03:35:24.640 --> 03:35:28.640]  would back congressman daniel webster or speaker of the house
[03:35:28.640 --> 03:35:32.160]  maybe you haven't heard of daniel webster he turns out to be the only one
[03:35:32.160 --> 03:35:35.840]  in the race right now between the three of them well actually kevin mccarthy
[03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:38.960]  has dropped out so jason chaffetz supports the
[03:35:38.960 --> 03:35:43.040]  trans-pacific partnership he supported the fast track trade agreement
[03:35:43.040 --> 03:35:46.400]  allowing the president to do whatever he wanted
[03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:52.000]  throwing away the constitutional process that allowed us to have ratifications
[03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:55.120]  of treaties supporting the fiction that the tpp is
[03:35:55.120 --> 03:35:58.720]  not a treaty supporting the idea that this massive
[03:35:58.720 --> 03:36:02.800]  reorganization of government and of our trade for the 21st century
[03:36:02.800 --> 03:36:06.400]  and of the freedom of the internet that all that should be done in secret by
[03:36:06.400 --> 03:36:10.000]  corporations and when they present their manifesto to congress it ought to be
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:13.360]  rubber stamped that's what they were voting for when they voted for the
[03:36:13.360 --> 03:36:18.320]  fast track authorization and so daniel webster opposed that
[03:36:18.320 --> 03:36:23.120]  someone else who opposed that was mark meadows the guy who introduced
[03:36:23.120 --> 03:36:26.320]  the uh the motion to vacate the seat for speaker
[03:36:26.320 --> 03:36:29.840]  vaner which ultimately resulted in him losing his seat
[03:36:29.840 --> 03:36:33.840]  mark meadows was thrown off of a subcommittee chair
[03:36:33.840 --> 03:36:37.840]  because he opposed the trend the fast track trade deal for the trans-pacific
[03:36:37.840 --> 03:36:40.720]  partnership you know who threw him off
[03:36:40.720 --> 03:36:46.880]  jason chaffetz the new fresh face of the establishment that's what this guy is
[03:36:46.880 --> 03:36:50.160]  when kevin mccarthy had his gaff on the shan hanity show
[03:36:50.160 --> 03:36:55.040]  a week ago last wednesday it was just four days later that jason chaffetz
[03:36:55.040 --> 03:36:58.880]  came out and we talked about his background i think it was on
[03:36:58.880 --> 03:37:02.000]  monday when i did the fourth hour we talked about the fact that his father
[03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:05.280]  was the campaign manager for dukakis had been married to
[03:37:05.280 --> 03:37:08.720]  dukakis's wife the former democrat presidential candidate
[03:37:08.720 --> 03:37:14.240]  he appeared on the political scene as a tea party candidate in 2009
[03:37:14.240 --> 03:37:17.840]  so his family's been on both sides of this that wasn't enough really to damn
[03:37:17.840 --> 03:37:21.040]  him but the fact that he would throw mark meadows
[03:37:21.040 --> 03:37:24.800]  off of a subcommittee chairmanship because he didn't support
[03:37:24.800 --> 03:37:28.480]  fast track shows that he's cut out of the same cloth as
[03:37:28.480 --> 03:37:31.440]  bainer he's not only thoroughly in with the
[03:37:31.440 --> 03:37:35.520]  establishment agenda of both parties leadership but he is also willing to
[03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:39.120]  punish people just like bainer wise and now he's thrown himself in
[03:37:39.120 --> 03:37:44.320]  as an alternative to kevin mccarthy so now it appears at this moment
[03:37:44.320 --> 03:37:48.160]  unless somebody else comes into the running that the race is between
[03:37:48.160 --> 03:37:52.720]  daniel webster and jason chaffetz now jason chaffetz says that the fact that
[03:37:52.720 --> 03:37:56.480]  he threw mark meadows off of the committee because he opposed fast
[03:37:56.480 --> 03:37:59.440]  track trade and then reinstated him he says that
[03:37:59.440 --> 03:38:02.560]  shows that he's someone who's learned from his experiences
[03:38:02.560 --> 03:38:07.760]  no not really because the house rules say that if the majority of the committee
[03:38:07.760 --> 03:38:11.600]  wants to go against the the leadership that threw him off the committee
[03:38:11.600 --> 03:38:15.120]  they can reinstate the chair and that was precisely what they were about to do
[03:38:15.120 --> 03:38:17.760]  with mark meadows they were going to reinstate him that would have been an
[03:38:17.760 --> 03:38:22.160]  embarrassment a rebuke to jason chaffetz so he did it himself
[03:38:22.160 --> 03:38:24.560]  so he wouldn't have looked so he wouldn't look bad
[03:38:24.560 --> 03:38:28.240]  this guy now wants to be speaker he is going to be
[03:38:28.240 --> 03:38:34.160]  a john bainer different face same person so today what we found
[03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:38.480]  and it was very interesting this happened just a couple of hours ago
[03:38:38.480 --> 03:38:41.680]  even though everyone was saying that mccarthy was poised to clinch
[03:38:41.680 --> 03:38:45.200]  gop's nomination for speaker but it's only the first step that was npr
[03:38:45.200 --> 03:38:49.200]  headlines uh just this morning just this morning that's what npr said
[03:38:49.200 --> 03:38:53.360]  then a few hours later that was at 7 56 a.m at 12 40
[03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:58.800]  12 36 p.m uh four hours later they say mccarthy drops out of the house
[03:38:58.800 --> 03:39:02.800]  speaker race throwing the gop leadership into chaos
[03:39:02.800 --> 03:39:06.320]  you know another definition for chaos is doug casey likes to point out we've
[03:39:06.320 --> 03:39:10.160]  had him on multiple times talking to alex jones doug casey the
[03:39:10.160 --> 03:39:15.200]  investment advisory says chaos the chinese symbol for that is danger
[03:39:15.200 --> 03:39:19.920]  and opportunity they combine those two graphics together to get the word chaos
[03:39:19.920 --> 03:39:24.080]  that's what we have right now in the gop leadership race we have danger
[03:39:24.080 --> 03:39:28.480]  and we have opportunity the danger is is that we're going to continue to go
[03:39:28.480 --> 03:39:32.160]  down this same statist path that is shared by the
[03:39:32.160 --> 03:39:35.600]  leadership of both parties or we have the opportunity
[03:39:35.600 --> 03:39:39.680]  to do something about that they're going to have the vote uh on the 29th that's
[03:39:39.680 --> 03:39:42.960]  when bainer is going to be leaving about that time
[03:39:42.960 --> 03:39:47.280]  you need to be involved right now and it looks like the person who
[03:39:47.280 --> 03:39:50.160]  we've got two choices at the moment unless they come up with somebody else
[03:39:50.160 --> 03:39:53.360]  the two choices right now are daniel webster a man who voted
[03:39:53.360 --> 03:39:57.120]  against the trans-pacific partnership against fast track trade
[03:39:57.120 --> 03:40:01.680]  and we have jason chaffetz who would throw people off of committees if they
[03:40:01.680 --> 03:40:05.040]  didn't toe the line on fast track trade that's the choice that you've got right
[03:40:05.040 --> 03:40:07.840]  now i don't know much about daniel webster but i do
[03:40:07.840 --> 03:40:11.920]  know that he stood up to john bainer when nobody would stand with him
[03:40:11.920 --> 03:40:15.680]  that's called leadership that's called backbone that's called
[03:40:15.680 --> 03:40:20.400]  character we need to support people like that and the house freedom caucus a
[03:40:20.400 --> 03:40:24.560]  group of 40 people did precisely that 40 congressmen
[03:40:24.560 --> 03:40:28.720]  in the house did that it's a small block but we know that if people will hang
[03:40:28.720 --> 03:40:32.400]  together as a small group they can affect change that's what we've seen
[03:40:32.400 --> 03:40:35.280]  happen with bainer getting thrown out that's what we saw happen with eric
[03:40:35.280 --> 03:40:38.800]  canter now kevin mccarthy being thrown out it's an opportunity
[03:40:38.800 --> 03:40:43.120]  you need to push hard on this this makes a much bigger difference than the
[03:40:43.120 --> 03:40:46.720]  presidential race don't get focused on the presidential
[03:40:46.720 --> 03:40:50.800]  race right now focus on what is about to happen now let me tell you what
[03:40:50.800 --> 03:40:53.760]  happened at the meeting this morning because just in four hours i read you
[03:40:53.760 --> 03:40:56.720]  those two headlines went from npr saying mccarthy's got it
[03:40:56.720 --> 03:40:59.680]  he's clenched it and the next one he steps down
[03:40:59.680 --> 03:41:02.880]  well they say tom rooney republican of florida said the meeting opened and
[03:41:02.880 --> 03:41:06.800]  republicans said that said their pledge to the allegiance then mccarthy stood up
[03:41:06.800 --> 03:41:10.640]  and took himself out of the race the prohibitive favorite
[03:41:10.640 --> 03:41:14.240]  said that he didn't want members to take arrows voting for him
[03:41:14.240 --> 03:41:18.560]  so he was taking himself out of contention speaker bainer then immediately
[03:41:18.560 --> 03:41:22.080]  moved to adjourn the meeting and rooney said there was quote
[03:41:22.080 --> 03:41:26.240]  total shock and some members were audibly crying
[03:41:26.240 --> 03:41:30.960]  i wonder which members were crying do you think it might have been john bainer
[03:41:30.960 --> 03:41:34.640]  you think john bainer would have been crying i wish i had audio of that i'd
[03:41:34.640 --> 03:41:38.640]  like to hear the total shock from john bainer and watch him crying on the
[03:41:38.640 --> 03:41:45.680]  podium as his hand-picked successor bows out of the race this is the opportunity
[03:41:45.680 --> 03:41:49.920]  now mccarthy said first to unite we probably need a fresh
[03:41:49.920 --> 03:41:53.920]  face let me tell you something that's precisely why jason chaffetz was put
[03:41:53.920 --> 03:41:58.320]  into this position by the leadership to offer a fresh unknown face
[03:41:58.320 --> 03:42:02.160]  who is going to do precisely what bainer and the rest of them have done
[03:42:02.160 --> 03:42:07.680]  on all of these issues and right now if you don't look anywhere beyond the tpp
[03:42:07.680 --> 03:42:12.000]  let's get people who are republicans and democrats who understand how dangerous
[03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:15.600]  how unconstitutional this whole process is of the
[03:42:15.600 --> 03:42:19.280]  fast-track trade of the trans-pacific transatlantic partnerships
[03:42:19.280 --> 03:42:23.920]  let's all come together and shut down these people in leadership
[03:42:23.920 --> 03:42:27.920]  who want to do this this is an opportunity call your representatives
[03:42:27.920 --> 03:42:31.200]  and tell them that you don't want them to vote for chaffetz but you want them
[03:42:31.200 --> 03:42:34.720]  to get somebody else like daniel webster or someone who is actually going to
[03:42:34.720 --> 03:42:37.840]  stand on principle who's going to stand on the
[03:42:37.840 --> 03:42:41.360]  constitution very very important that we do that
[03:42:41.360 --> 03:42:44.960]  they say that many are criticizing bainer and the leadership for stunts
[03:42:44.960 --> 03:42:48.880]  like resigning the day after pope frances addressed a joint meeting at
[03:42:48.880 --> 03:42:52.480]  congress yeah absolutely it was a stunt but it was something that was forced
[03:42:52.480 --> 03:42:57.520]  upon him by determined leaders now
[03:42:57.520 --> 03:43:01.120]  representative daniel webster furthermore came out and he said
[03:43:01.120 --> 03:43:05.440]  he wasn't going to back mccarthy even if he was chosen
[03:43:05.440 --> 03:43:10.080]  this is the kind of guy that we need to have somebody who is going to stand up
[03:43:10.080 --> 03:43:13.840]  to power and again the house freedom caucus
[03:43:13.840 --> 03:43:17.680]  met last night and said in a block that they were going to
[03:43:17.680 --> 03:43:22.240]  vote on him out of personal principle we need to support those people we need
[03:43:22.240 --> 03:43:25.360]  more people like that but a block of 40 people
[03:43:25.360 --> 03:43:30.480]  who will stand for the the constitution and the republican party is a block that
[03:43:30.480 --> 03:43:34.240]  we need to support now moving on to the trans pacific
[03:43:34.240 --> 03:43:37.200]  partnership and how is this going to play into some of the races that are
[03:43:37.200 --> 03:43:40.800]  going to come up later on it's interesting to see
[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:44.720]  that john uh that uh joe biden is the only
[03:43:44.720 --> 03:43:49.440]  possible presidential candidate in the democrat side who is still backing
[03:43:49.440 --> 03:43:54.080]  these transatlantic trans pacific partnerships ap reports
[03:43:54.080 --> 03:43:57.680]  that if he runs joe biden would be the only democrat backing the asian trade
[03:43:57.680 --> 03:44:00.800]  deal they say he became the only perspective or current democrat
[03:44:00.800 --> 03:44:04.000]  presidential candidate to support the tpp on wednesday
[03:44:04.000 --> 03:44:08.000]  as clinton flipped her position you understand
[03:44:08.000 --> 03:44:11.600]  she supported it you understand that hillary clinton
[03:44:11.600 --> 03:44:16.560]  supported the keystone pipeline the state department supported the keystone
[03:44:16.560 --> 03:44:21.680]  pipeline even against the obama administration when she was head of it
[03:44:21.680 --> 03:44:24.800]  now she says she's against the keystone pipeline now
[03:44:24.800 --> 03:44:28.480]  again we could talk about the keystone pipeline we could talk about safety issues
[03:44:28.480 --> 03:44:32.160]  of it some people are concerned i don't share their concern
[03:44:32.160 --> 03:44:35.280]  that uh it's it's about it's going to make global warming worse that it's
[03:44:35.280 --> 03:44:38.480]  going to be more pollution i don't agree with that but before we get to that
[03:44:38.480 --> 03:44:41.680]  issue the thing that sticks with me on the train on the
[03:44:41.680 --> 03:44:46.800]  keystone pipeline is the fact that it uses imminent domain
[03:44:46.800 --> 03:44:52.480]  to take private property from individuals and give it to a private
[03:44:52.480 --> 03:44:56.160]  entity do you understand imminent domain is bad enough when the government
[03:44:56.160 --> 03:45:00.400]  takes it from you for the public use but to have your property taken from you
[03:45:00.400 --> 03:45:03.360]  your private property taken from you by force by the
[03:45:03.360 --> 03:45:07.920]  government and handed to another private individual that is
[03:45:07.920 --> 03:45:11.920]  abhorrent it should be abhorrent to anyone who supports the idea the
[03:45:11.920 --> 03:45:15.440]  principle of private property and that's precisely what is happening
[03:45:15.440 --> 03:45:18.400]  with the keystone pipeline if it goes through
[03:45:18.400 --> 03:45:22.880]  it's something that is far worse than the uh kello versus london supreme court
[03:45:22.880 --> 03:45:27.040]  decision and again the supreme court decision how many times do they have to
[03:45:27.040 --> 03:45:30.320]  be wrong on how many issues before we start to say
[03:45:30.320 --> 03:45:34.720]  that they do not alter the law they do not alter the constitution it is an
[03:45:34.720 --> 03:45:37.440]  opinion and we've seen them reverse their opinions
[03:45:37.440 --> 03:45:41.360]  on things like the dread scott decision for example but also more recently
[03:45:41.360 --> 03:45:44.880]  understand it back in 1917 the supreme court said
[03:45:44.880 --> 03:45:49.440]  that there was no first amendment when it came to movies do you realize that
[03:45:49.440 --> 03:45:53.360]  it was actually a movie producer who went to jail one of the first people
[03:45:53.360 --> 03:45:57.360]  prosecuted under the 1917 espionage act
[03:45:57.360 --> 03:46:03.120]  he went to jail for several years he was fined an exorbitant amount for the time
[03:46:03.120 --> 03:46:06.400]  and it was because he had produced a movie that was critical of the british
[03:46:06.400 --> 03:46:09.040]  during the revolutionary war he produced a movie about the revolutionary war
[03:46:09.040 --> 03:46:12.320]  that showed the british's villains and woodrow wilson
[03:46:12.320 --> 03:46:16.800]  wanted to get into world war one with the british on the british side and he
[03:46:16.800 --> 03:46:19.360]  didn't want a movie that showed the british
[03:46:19.360 --> 03:46:23.280]  as villains so what they did was they sent this guy to prison
[03:46:23.280 --> 03:46:26.720]  gave him a major fine supreme court didn't have a problem with that so there
[03:46:26.720 --> 03:46:29.520]  is no first amendment when it comes to movies they later reversed that in the
[03:46:29.520 --> 03:46:33.040]  1950s the supreme court has been on many different
[03:46:33.040 --> 03:46:37.840]  sides of important issues frequently wrong and they are not
[03:46:37.840 --> 03:46:40.320]  amending the constitution when they make their decision
[03:46:40.320 --> 03:46:43.120]  they are not creating law when they make their decision
[03:46:43.120 --> 03:46:47.520]  we need to get over that but again going back to
[03:46:47.520 --> 03:46:50.320]  the kello versus london eminent domain decision
[03:46:50.320 --> 03:46:54.000]  that was where they said that the city could take it from one
[03:46:54.000 --> 03:46:57.280]  individual take take the property of several property owners and turn it over
[03:46:57.280 --> 03:47:01.200]  to someone for a project in that area understand how much worse the keystone
[03:47:01.200 --> 03:47:05.120]  pipeline is in this particular case it's not being turned over
[03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:08.800]  from one from many private individuals in one area to one
[03:47:08.800 --> 03:47:12.640]  well-connected individual in the area like donald trump for example he's done
[03:47:12.640 --> 03:47:16.320]  this many times but in the case of the keystone pipeline
[03:47:16.320 --> 03:47:20.080]  it's being turned over to a transnational corporation it's being turned
[03:47:20.080 --> 03:47:24.560]  over to a canadian company a company that's not even
[03:47:24.560 --> 03:47:28.880]  american is able to come in and use the american government to seize property
[03:47:28.880 --> 03:47:31.680]  from american individuals that should be enough to put a stake
[03:47:31.680 --> 03:47:35.600]  through the keystone pipeline's heart but hillary clinton supported it
[03:47:35.600 --> 03:47:39.440]  hillary clinton's state department supported it now she says she doesn't
[03:47:39.440 --> 03:47:42.640]  support it do you trust her on that at least
[03:47:42.640 --> 03:47:46.960]  donald trump has consistently been wrong on eminent domain
[03:47:46.960 --> 03:47:50.880]  and again i've reported on this many times showing how
[03:47:50.880 --> 03:47:54.320]  he's essentially like the the villains in the movie
[03:47:54.320 --> 03:47:58.320]  up the the pixar movie up trying to take that guy's house he did
[03:47:58.320 --> 03:48:03.440]  precisely that in new jersey and he was on
[03:48:03.440 --> 03:48:07.040]  brett bear on fox news on tuesday evening
[03:48:07.040 --> 03:48:11.440]  again doubling down on this praising the government seizing private property
[03:48:11.440 --> 03:48:15.280]  from individuals in order to build a massive development he says
[03:48:15.280 --> 03:48:18.400]  that's going to employ thousands of people are you going to build a factory
[03:48:18.400 --> 03:48:21.520]  that without this little house you can't build that factory so just take that
[03:48:21.520 --> 03:48:25.280]  little house and and give it over to the big corporate
[03:48:25.280 --> 03:48:30.080]  guys like donald trump and let them stamp all over your private property
[03:48:30.080 --> 03:48:34.960]  rights understand i i agree with donald trump on
[03:48:34.960 --> 03:48:38.480]  many issues i disagree with him on some really fundamental things
[03:48:38.480 --> 03:48:43.680]  like eminent domain and don't tell me that he is in this as some kind of an
[03:48:43.680 --> 03:48:46.240]  altruistic thing that he's going to spend all of his money
[03:48:46.240 --> 03:48:50.720]  and to become president so he can save us okay this is a guy who's used the
[03:48:50.720 --> 03:48:53.360]  government to confiscate other people's property
[03:48:53.360 --> 03:48:57.360]  for his projects marco rubio is hitting out on donald trump and i don't support
[03:48:57.360 --> 03:49:00.240]  rubio either but at least he's got it right
[03:49:00.240 --> 03:49:04.000]  that he we shouldn't be supporting the government trampling on individual
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:07.360]  property rights but folks that's precisely what's going on with the
[03:49:07.360 --> 03:49:11.200]  trans-pacific partnership it's not only our property rights that are
[03:49:11.200 --> 03:49:14.640]  being trampled on it's all kinds of copyright issues
[03:49:14.640 --> 03:49:20.080]  and it is another move to support internet censorship
[03:49:20.080 --> 03:49:23.840]  when i talked to lienne macadoo on the nightly news i think it was on tuesday
[03:49:23.840 --> 03:49:27.760]  night we talked about this strong cities network
[03:49:27.760 --> 03:49:30.880]  that is coming out that was something that was announced
[03:49:30.880 --> 03:49:35.280]  the previous week at the united nations that is an effort
[03:49:35.280 --> 03:49:41.760]  to politicize and criminalize non politically correct speech
[03:49:41.760 --> 03:49:45.200]  they define radical extremists and this is a movement that began
[03:49:45.200 --> 03:49:48.960]  in europe they said when they announced it at the un when the department of
[03:49:48.960 --> 03:49:51.680]  justice put out their press release about the strong
[03:49:51.680 --> 03:49:55.920]  cities network they said that this is going to be administered by this european
[03:49:55.920 --> 03:50:01.600]  think tank and that european think tank has focused on extremism
[03:50:01.600 --> 03:50:05.120]  being defined as anyone who is anti-immigrant
[03:50:05.120 --> 03:50:09.440]  anti-islam they want to do everything they can
[03:50:09.440 --> 03:50:13.520]  to bring down europe as it has been i mean i remember going back to europe
[03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:17.680]  uh going to europe when i was uh between high school and college
[03:50:17.680 --> 03:50:21.680]  traveling around and it was absolutely amazing these these countries in most
[03:50:21.680 --> 03:50:24.960]  cases were quite a bit smaller than american states and every
[03:50:24.960 --> 03:50:28.480]  one of them had their own culture their own language their own currency
[03:50:28.480 --> 03:50:31.360]  and had had it for quite some time that has been
[03:50:31.360 --> 03:50:35.760]  dissolved by deliberate design the trans-pacific partnership
[03:50:35.760 --> 03:50:39.600]  is another move to consolidate these blocks that they're creating
[03:50:39.600 --> 03:50:43.760]  into a global governance it's being done without our authorization
[03:50:43.760 --> 03:50:48.000]  they are criminalizing anyone who attempts to speak out against it demonizing
[03:50:48.000 --> 03:50:51.920]  them as xenophobic as racist and that is
[03:50:51.920 --> 03:50:54.880]  the internet censorship is one of the ways that they're going to come at us
[03:50:54.880 --> 03:50:58.240]  with that stay with us when we come back i want to tell you about this new city
[03:50:58.240 --> 03:51:04.800]  it's being built in new mexico
[03:51:04.800 --> 03:51:09.360]  hey neighbor what are you doing digging you had a heart attack last year
[03:51:09.360 --> 03:51:14.080]  oh i know i was told no more hard labor then why are you digging well i've been
[03:51:14.080 --> 03:51:17.200]  taking extendivite it's been approved to help my heart
[03:51:17.200 --> 03:51:21.360]  extendivite is that a new drug no not a drug
[03:51:21.360 --> 03:51:25.200]  it's uh more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne
[03:51:25.200 --> 03:51:29.760]  herbal how can that help well actually we've taken herbs for thousands of years
[03:51:29.760 --> 03:51:34.480]  extendivite is doing the job for me does your doctor know about extendivite

[03:51:51.360 --> 03:51:54.480]  at heartdrop.com
[03:51:58.800 --> 03:52:03.040]  many of the products at info wars life.com are true game changers
[03:52:03.040 --> 03:52:06.720]  they are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by
[03:52:06.720 --> 03:52:09.360]  prescription but when we look at a product like survival shield
[03:52:09.360 --> 03:52:12.320]  nascent iodine x2 it's something that really has been
[03:52:12.320 --> 03:52:15.520]  hiding in plain view for over a hundred years the federal government
[03:52:15.520 --> 03:52:20.160]  mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form of it be added to
[03:52:20.160 --> 03:52:24.080]  table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency
[03:52:24.080 --> 03:52:27.200]  and iodine was causing i want to challenge the listeners who've not
[03:52:27.200 --> 03:52:30.720]  tried x2 for yourselves what do you have to lose you are the tip of the

[03:52:34.320 --> 03:52:38.320]  that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that i know
[03:52:38.320 --> 03:52:41.680]  and the final reason to try x2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock

[03:54:12.320 --> 03:54:15.760]  i'm david night we've been talking about the developments
[03:54:15.760 --> 03:54:20.800]  in the uh search for a new house leader and how that reflects on the tpp we
[03:54:20.800 --> 03:54:24.400]  have an article up on info wars dot com how the tpp could lead to worldwide
[03:54:24.400 --> 03:54:27.200]  internet censorship understand folks that the
[03:54:27.200 --> 03:54:31.280]  corporations are going to be censoring for the government
[03:54:31.280 --> 03:54:34.640]  and the way they're going to do that is to use copyright
[03:54:34.640 --> 03:54:38.560]  it's a win-win situation for the two of them it's a symbiotic relationship
[03:54:38.560 --> 03:54:42.320]  for the corporations for the governments and of course the tpp
[03:54:42.320 --> 03:54:46.960]  allows corporate governance julian assange said about the tpp the deal
[03:54:46.960 --> 03:54:50.000]  isn't about trade it's about corporate control he is
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:53.440]  absolutely right let me read you some other quotes about the tpp
[03:54:53.440 --> 03:54:57.200]  and this is coming up this is why it's very important for us to have
[03:54:57.200 --> 03:55:01.440]  not have a house speaker like jason chafez who will throw people off of
[03:55:01.440 --> 03:55:04.960]  leadership of committees because they oppose fast-track trade
[03:55:04.960 --> 03:55:08.640]  it's important for us to have someone who opposed that process
[03:55:08.640 --> 03:55:12.640]  like daniel webster who stood up against leadership people like
[03:55:12.640 --> 03:55:16.880]  mark meadows who stood down the speaker he cost the speaker his
[03:55:16.880 --> 03:55:21.520]  seat because of those types of things this is what open media says about it
[03:55:21.520 --> 03:55:24.960]  they say internet users around the world should be very concerned about this
[03:55:24.960 --> 03:55:28.240]  ultra secret pact the trans specific partnership
[03:55:28.240 --> 03:55:31.600]  what we're talking about here is global internet censorship
[03:55:31.600 --> 03:55:35.120]  it will criminalize our online activities it will censor the web it will
[03:55:35.120 --> 03:55:39.040]  cost everyday users money this deal would never pass
[03:55:39.040 --> 03:55:43.840]  with the whole world watching that's why they've negotiated it in total secrecy
[03:55:43.840 --> 03:55:48.480]  electronic frontier says we have no reason to believe that the tpp has
[03:55:48.480 --> 03:55:52.080]  improved much at all from the last leaked version released in august
[03:55:52.080 --> 03:55:56.000]  we won't know until the us trade representative releases the text
[03:55:56.000 --> 03:55:59.920]  ah but the corporate giants and their congressional
[03:55:59.920 --> 03:56:03.440]  puppets their congressional employees do know
[03:56:03.440 --> 03:56:06.560]  the minute they announced that this thing was done we had people
[03:56:06.560 --> 03:56:10.560]  like oren hatch who is the employee of big pharma saying oh i don't like the
[03:56:10.560 --> 03:56:14.080]  fact that they've changed the copyrights from from 12 years to five
[03:56:14.080 --> 03:56:16.640]  years i don't know for pharmaceutical drugs you had
[03:56:16.640 --> 03:56:19.840]  mitch mcconnell say yeah well they've taken away some of the
[03:56:19.840 --> 03:56:23.760]  suing capabilities of big tobacco and on and on and on
[03:56:23.760 --> 03:56:28.240]  all the corporate spokespersons the people that we think of as senators and
[03:56:28.240 --> 03:56:31.120]  congressmen but are really just corporate spokespersons
[03:56:31.120 --> 03:56:34.640]  they all came out of the woodwork with their issues about what was in it that
[03:56:34.640 --> 03:56:38.240]  they didn't like but they haven't bothered to tell us yet
[03:56:38.240 --> 03:56:42.800]  so we can only guess about what's in it and understand that when it's being
[03:56:42.800 --> 03:56:47.280]  sold as a trade agreement why is it then that you've got all
[03:56:47.280 --> 03:56:51.120]  these organizations like open media and electronic frontier foundation who are
[03:56:51.120 --> 03:56:54.880]  concerned about an open and free internet about the first amendment
[03:56:54.880 --> 03:56:58.480]  why are they so concerned about a trade deal
[03:56:58.480 --> 03:57:03.280]  because it's about a lot more than trade we had senator sessions say this is
[03:57:03.280 --> 03:57:06.320]  about setting up global governance he's one of the few people
[03:57:06.320 --> 03:57:10.400]  who have read it who tried to explain to the senate that they should not fast
[03:57:10.400 --> 03:57:13.280]  track this process we need to be very concerned
[03:57:13.280 --> 03:57:16.800]  but we do have a ray of hope we've got a lifeline
[03:57:16.800 --> 03:57:20.880]  that is there we've got 40 people the house freedom caucus got together and
[03:57:20.880 --> 03:57:24.320]  endorsed daniel webster against the hand-picked
[03:57:24.320 --> 03:57:28.800]  successor and if we stand with those people we can do something to make our
[03:57:28.800 --> 03:57:33.040]  government a bit more honest one of the things that just came out which is
[03:57:33.040 --> 03:57:36.080]  is very distressing not only did we have an article i talked about when leon
[03:57:36.080 --> 03:57:40.160]  was in here about the supreme court refusing to hear a lower court case
[03:57:40.160 --> 03:57:44.160]  that said that mandatory vaccines didn't violate children's constitutional
[03:57:44.160 --> 03:57:46.960]  rights by throwing them out of school and it's interesting because they said
[03:57:46.960 --> 03:57:50.560]  that this was primarily health related concerns
[03:57:50.560 --> 03:57:53.600]  and it wasn't based in religion does that mean
[03:57:53.600 --> 03:57:56.800]  that unless we've got a religious objection we don't have any right to
[03:57:56.800 --> 03:58:00.960]  say that we have informed consent to make decisions about our health
[03:58:00.960 --> 03:58:05.280]  as i mentioned before that's precisely what benjamin rush warned us about
[03:58:05.280 --> 03:58:08.800]  and that's what we need to be involved we have to be involved in this
[03:58:08.800 --> 03:58:12.720]  this is the time to try to take back your government you can have far more of a
[03:58:12.720 --> 03:58:16.240]  say so right now you need to get involved and do that
[03:58:16.240 --> 03:58:20.240]  join leon macadoo tonight for the night leanew she has three dynamite
[03:58:20.240 --> 03:58:23.840]  interviews richard gauge jeffrey jackson is going to be talking about how you
[03:58:23.840 --> 03:58:27.920]  can get off the vaccine tracking list and wane madson will be talking about
[03:58:27.920 --> 03:58:31.440]  what hillary clinton's been up to join us at seven central eight p.m.
