[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  I think I hear an echo in here
[00:11.000 --> 00:12.000]  You want answers?
[00:12.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[00:18.000 --> 00:23.000]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.000]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, already
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  Well, well, well into the month of March
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday
[00:35.000 --> 00:37.000]  Worldwide broadcast
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.000]  I guess that makes it to the 19th already
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  First off, we've got a report from Rex Jones
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  On the dangers of sugar and beyond
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  My 12-year-old son
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  And then we're going to come back and launch into all of the news and information
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  The Fed opens the door wider for rate hike
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  But downgrades economic outlook
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.000]  DHS releases another 30,000 criminal aliens
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  On to the streets
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  U.S. likely to keep troops basically indefinitely in Afghanistan
[01:06.000 --> 01:07.000]  We knew that was coming
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.000]  Obama calls for mandatory voting
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  Is ISIS building a drone army?
[01:12.000 --> 01:13.000]  Breastfeeding pays
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  LA Times shows a study
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  We already told you about a long time ago
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.000]  Ammo ban is in trouble again
[01:19.000 --> 01:21.000]  All this and more straight ahead
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  But here is Rex Jones' report
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  Hi, I'm Rex Jones
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  And today, I'm here to talk about sugar
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  There are three main types of sugar
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  Type 1 would be natural sugar
[01:33.000 --> 01:34.000]  Which is kind of good for you
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  And has found most plant and animal byproducts such as apples or honey
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  Type 2, however, is not that good for you
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  And can be found in grocery stores or on your table
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  However, type 3, high-fructose corn syrup is so bad it belongs in a trash can
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  It's very toxic to humans and is linked to diabetes and obesity
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  I'm at South by Southwest
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  Standing in front of a McDonald's landfill
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  Where they're issuing out free food to the mind-controlled populace here
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  Despite the numerous sugar giants out there
[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  The American people are waking up
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  And realizing that hidden sugar is alive
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  What you see behind me right now
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  Is an example of how we are fighting back against the food tyranny
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  The hilariously funny Donald McDonald character behind us
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  Is an example of how we can use humor to fight back against the global tyranny
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  Let's face it, there's a reason McDonald's is losing money every month
[02:31.000 --> 02:33.000]  People are waking up and they're realizing
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  They don't want to eat the garbage anymore
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  This is how we use their own propaganda against them
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  This is how we flip the message to make sure people are informed
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  And make the right healthy choices
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  Let's go find out more on the hidden minutes of sugar
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.000]  Studies show that Oreos, a highly sugar-laden product
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.000]  Are no less addictive than cocaine and morphine
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  Even though we associate significant health hazards with taking drugs like cocaine and morphine
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  High fat and high sugar foods may represent even more of a danger
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  Because of their accessibility and their affordability
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  According to the US Department of Agriculture
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.000]  Americans consume an average of 156 pounds of sugar a year
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  Only about 29 pounds of it comes from traditional sugar
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  According to the Sugar Association
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  The rest comes from food
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  Now we're about to walk out the door and go to the grocery store
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  Where we will learn how much hidden sugar is behind the label that you don't see
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.000]  In foods you would never suspect
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  Even though most of these amounts may look small and insignificant
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  They're all based on serving size
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  One was the last time you only had three chips in a sitting
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  For one squirt of ketchup on your burger
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  Now that you see all the hidden sugar in these foods
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  You would never suspect some high fructose corn syrup
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  Or dextrose to be in
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  It makes you wonder how much sugar do we really consume
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  And where else is it hidden in our lives
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  Despite relentless PR being perpetrated against them
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  And the so-called mighty food giants behind me
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  Trying to influence their point of view
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  The American people are fighting back and realizing
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  That hidden sugar in high fructose corn syrup are a lie
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  Alright folks, I'm proud of that report
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  He pretty much edited that with Buckley's help
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  Came up with the whole thing and shot it
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.000]  That's about 95% Rex Jones, very proud of him
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  With super-male or super-female vitality
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.000]  Specifically designed to assist the body
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  In regulating proper hormone balance
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.000]  To create superior vitality in males and females
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  Supercharge and conquer your world
[05:23.000 --> 05:35.000]  The government's Department of Homeland Security
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  Is buying up loads of ammo
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  To own and purchase firearms
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  Can you put two and two together?
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  Including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  Is reasonably priced and fully legal
[05:50.000 --> 05:55.000]  Infidel Body Armor.com
[05:55.000 --> 06:21.000]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  For what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  In our quest to bring you what is simply
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  The most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.000]  That we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  Experience the benefits of combining
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.000]  Over 14 ancient herbs and extracts
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  With exciting new advances in nutraceutical science
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.000]  Now is the time to secure ancient defense

[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  That's infowarslife.com
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.000]  Hey, how you doing?
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.000]  Good, brother.
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  Just recently started using your products
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  Everything you said about them is correct
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  And it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  Supermale vitality was developed
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.000]  To activate your body's own natural processes
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  Instead of using synthetic chemicals
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.000]  We do the supermale and the superfemale vitality
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  Big changes, a lot of energy
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.000]  They've got a ton of money there
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  Harvested around the planet
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  And then concentrated or maximum potency
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  They want to stun and dumb down
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  And energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  But then burn you out in my experience
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.000]  Goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I love it
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  Visit InfowarsLife.com today
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  To secure your supermale vitality
[07:55.000 --> 08:18.000]  And other powerful products from InfowarsLife
[08:25.000 --> 08:38.000]  Music
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.000]  On this live Thursday, the 19th day of March
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  2015 global transmission
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.000]  We have an amazing researcher and documentary filmmaker
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  Joining us, the maker of Doctored, the film
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  The American Medical Association does not want you to see
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  Joining us coming up in the third hour today
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.000]  And we'll play some clips of the film as well
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  And talk about it
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  In the meantime, let me just be as calm as I can
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  Try to just give you some of the news
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.000]  We're going to be breaking down as best I can today
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  The fat opens the door, wider for rate hike
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  But downgrades economic outlook
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  We've been telling you that they're by design
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  Trying to implode the economy
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  Swedish central bank cuts key rate further below zero
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  That is the race to the bottom
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  Bailout is back, Fannie and Freddie
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  Likely need additional treasury investment
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  After derivatives losses
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  Retail all of this together
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  Ten charts which show we are much worse off
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  Than just before the last economic crisis
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  I'm going to go over these charts
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  And do an economic breakdown at the bottom of the hour
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  In about 23-24 minutes
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  Look at this stack of news
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  DHS released another 30,000 criminal aliens
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  Onto the streets in just the last month
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  And that dovetails with this article
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  Out of Scripps Howard News Service
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  I see these stories every day
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  Every day, sometimes a couple times a day
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  Tuberculosis infects 27 in Kansas City area high school
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.000]  Tuberculosis kills a lot of people
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.000]  It's now drug resistant or drug immune
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  And if you dig deeper into these stories
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  From Kansas City to Los Angeles, California
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  From Dallas, Texas to New York
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  It's people coming in out of Latin America and Asia
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  That have these deadly strains
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  Can you imagine if
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  They treated this like they did the measles
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  Because that's something that hasn't killed anybody
[10:42.000 --> 10:43.000]  In over a decade
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  There's some red spots on your face and a fever
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  Can you imagine if
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.000]  We apply the same logic to the tens of thousands a month
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  Getting tuberculosis in the United States
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  And the huge warts of people that are
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  Confined sometimes for years
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  Because they can't leave
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  Because they will give people uncurable TB
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  Uncurable
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  TB is pouring into the U.S.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  And oh well, it's brown people
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  So we better not say anything
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  Oh, Muslims in one town
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  Reportedly raped 5,000 girls admittedly
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  So the government covered it up in England
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  This is political correctness
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.000]  Where you gesticulate in front of Obama
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  Because he's supposedly African or whatever
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  When he's setting up death panels for the military
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  Obamacare trying to take our guns
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  Because after all, he's black, so it's okay
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  The system brainwashes us about political correctness
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  Not because they care about black people
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  Or quote brown people
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  But because it just becomes a political smokescreen
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  For the real agenda
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  Amazing
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  If you're a jail worker or a police officer
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  Or an aid worker
[12:01.000 --> 12:02.000]  Or somebody that eats fast food
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  Or eats stuff at restaurants, period
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  I was talking to William Benny
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  Right before he left the NSA
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  He and five others got
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  Type A
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  In the lunch room
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  Hepatitis at the national security agency
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  Probably on purpose, but the point is
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  That'll eat your liver and kill you
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  And the vaccines, the studies show
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  Don't even protect you
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  It's all a giant fraud
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  But these diseases are pouring
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  Across the borders of the United States
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  And it'll be no big deal
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  When you or your child get drug resistant
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  Or drug immune TB
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  And you get locked up in a modern sanitarium
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  For the rest of your natural days
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  But oh my gosh
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  20-something people got measles
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.000]  Oh, it turns out they had just been vaccinated
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  Now that political correctness in brainwashing
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  Ties into this
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  Daily mail story
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  Starbucks hit by cascade of negativity
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  After ordering staff to talk racism with customers
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  Vice president forced off Twitter
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  As angry public turns on patronizing project
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  That's patronizing
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  Karim Abdul-Jabbar, Time Magazine
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  Starbucks flawed but wonderful plan
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  To tackle race
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  Starbucks to fin race-together policy
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  This is about getting us ready
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  To pay trillions more to foreign banks
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  Propping up fraudulent counterfeit derivatives
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  Supporting all these illegal wars
[13:43.000 --> 13:44.000]  Supporting putting the veterans
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  On secret do not treat death list
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  Ignoring dehumanization as automation
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  Replaces human activity and as human
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  Activity is basically banned
[13:56.000 --> 13:57.000]  Elon Musk in the future
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  Human driving cars will be illegal
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  Well, of course they will be
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  The UN and others have announced that's the plan
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  I've been telling you that for 20 years
[14:04.000 --> 14:05.000]  I've been warning you
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  Because it's all in the official UN
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  Club of Rome
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  Council on Foreign Relations
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.000]  MIT, Rand Corporation
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  I mean, I've read hundreds and hundreds
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  And Control-F scanned with keywords
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  I won't read them all
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  Government documents
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  We've shown you the Emergency Centers
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  Establishment Act
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  We've shown you the National Police Stabilization Force
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  We know the plan
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  I don't care if you read a Rand Corporation
[14:33.000 --> 14:34.000]  Or a Council on Foreign Relations
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  Public Policy Report
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  That then gets adopted by government
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.000]  Whole cloth
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  It's all the same plan
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  And we ain't in it
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  That's why it's so sexy
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  I saw on CNN today
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  To live in this new fashionable
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  Off-the-grid house
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  They use the term off-the-grid
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  And sustainable
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.000]  When it's not really off-the-grid
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  And it's not sustainable
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  And it's 300 square feet
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  And you pay a lot more for it
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.000]  They're just selling us on the dehumanization
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  That ties in to the Starbucks situation
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  I didn't know about Planet Fitness
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  But I want to go to one and do a
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  Undercover Report
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  That if you barely set a weight down
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  An alarm goes off on the wall
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  Like you're in Star Trek
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  And the Klingons are attacking
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  And then little control freaks
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  In Star Trek outfits basically
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  Purple outfits show up
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  And harass you
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  But if a man wants to dress up
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  Like a woman and go in the women's
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  Dress rooms
[15:36.000 --> 15:37.000]  Who weighs like 400 pounds
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  That's A-OK
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.000]  Who isn't even a member
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  You complain
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.000]  You get kicked out
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  And then there isn't a squat rack
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  Because that scene is manly
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  And it's just everything
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  These big corporations
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  Are turning their facilities
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  Into literal
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  I use that word a lot
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  Because this is not a purbely
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  When I tell you America and the world
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.000]  Is being turned into a giant
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  Cross between a gulag
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  And a huge
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  Oh, what would the term be?
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  Re-education center
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  Meets
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  Meets Las Vegas
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  Meets Times Square
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  Where you're just bombarded
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  With conditioning in your face
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  This is the control freaks
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  Relishing what they're doing
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  And so imagine you go up
[16:32.000 --> 16:33.000]  There's ten people in front of you
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  At Starbucks
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  I don't like supporting big mega
[16:37.000 --> 16:38.000]  Corporations
[16:38.000 --> 16:39.000]  But they do have powerful coffee
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  I go there probably one tenth
[16:41.000 --> 16:42.000]  As much as I did
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  Five years ago
[16:43.000 --> 16:44.000]  And that was hardly any
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  Now I will never buy any Starbucks
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  I will not drink Starbucks
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  I don't care if I'm in a hotel
[16:50.000 --> 16:51.000]  And they serve Starbucks
[16:51.000 --> 16:52.000]  I'm going to say
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.000]  I want something else
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.000]  Bring me something else
[16:54.000 --> 16:55.000]  Or give me hot tea
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  Give me Earl Gray
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  Because they're anti-gun
[16:58.000 --> 16:59.000]  They won't let consult carry
[16:59.000 --> 17:00.000]  People in their offices
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.000]  They fund anti-gun control
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  They fund open borders
[17:07.000 --> 17:08.000]  And they're in the news today
[17:08.000 --> 17:09.000]  Pushing it
[17:09.000 --> 17:10.000]  And so you get up there
[17:10.000 --> 17:11.000]  And they go
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.000]  Do you know about white privilege?
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  I mean imagine five years ago
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.000]  A sitcom or drama
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  This is beyond Portlandia
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  Where you go to get coffee
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  And they ask you about white privilege
[17:22.000 --> 17:23.000]  And you're some Russian
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.000]  Who has no history
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  Of connection to any black slavery
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.000]  By the way
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  Most immigrants came to this country
[17:30.000 --> 17:31.000]  After 1900
[17:31.000 --> 17:32.000]  Who were white
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.000]  And had no history
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.000]  Two percent of southerners
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.000]  Owned slaves
[17:37.000 --> 17:40.000]  You can go to a pretty good size
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  Auditorium of people
[17:42.000 --> 17:43.000]  And have trouble finding somebody
[17:43.000 --> 17:44.000]  Who had ancestors
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  Who were involved in slavery
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.000]  You go to the right town
[17:49.000 --> 17:50.000]  In Texas or Alabama
[17:50.000 --> 17:51.000]  Or Tennessee
[17:51.000 --> 17:52.000]  You might be able to find some folks
[17:52.000 --> 17:53.000]  But I mean
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.000]  So what?
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  If my dad was a murderer
[17:55.000 --> 17:56.000]  He did my fault
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  What about great, great, great, great granddaddy?
[17:58.000 --> 18:01.000]  I mean this is crazy
[18:01.000 --> 18:02.000]  But again
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  We're being totally gang-raped
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.000]  By the globalist
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.000]  They want to set each other's throat
[18:05.000 --> 18:06.000]  And I mean
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  I don't even watch mainstream television a lot
[18:08.000 --> 18:09.000]  But every time I'm in a restaurant
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.000]  Or turn it on
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.000]  It's race, race, race, race, race, race, race, race
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  They set up political correctness
[18:15.000 --> 18:16.000]  Sounding legitimate
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  To help people get a good place in life
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  To end division
[18:20.000 --> 18:21.000]  With the ideas of Martin Luther King
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.000]  In common sense
[18:22.000 --> 18:23.000]  And then they totally double back
[18:23.000 --> 18:24.000]  And are using it now
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  That the studies are out
[18:26.000 --> 18:27.000]  And the actuaries are out
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  And the demographics are out today
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  America is now officially
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  More than half, quote, brown
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  The world is only about seven percent white
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  And that's using demographic numbers
[18:41.000 --> 18:42.000]  That are mixed
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  We're probably talking five percent of the world is white
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  In countries that are 95 percent African
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  Or 80 plus percent
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.000]  Mesoamerican or whatever
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  They will call the minorities whites
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.000]  The majority and the oppressors
[18:59.000 --> 19:02.000]  And it's all just a way to corner
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  Any middle classes
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  Or any highly industrialized area
[19:06.000 --> 19:07.000]  To manipulate them
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  They tell the Japanese they're racist
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  If they don't accept unlimited immigrants
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.000]  And give up their culture
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  Well, your races give South Koreans and Chinese
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  Because you invaded them
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  Well, China invaded Japan
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  South Korea, they all have wars with each other
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  Vietnam's basically been at war with China
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.000]  For six months
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  Does that mean that China's got to give Vietnam
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.000]  Something free?
[19:26.000 --> 19:31.000]  They just play this mindless guilt game all day
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  But I do want to send my reporters in
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  With hidden cameras to Starbucks today
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.000]  Let's do it
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  That's a good story for my southwest downtown
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.000]  And go in and go
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  Oh my gosh, yes, I'm so evil and white
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  What can I do to be better?
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.000]  I mean, Starbucks doesn't go
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  Do you know 52 percent of blacks
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  Are exterminated before they're born?
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  Did you know that for blacks, fluoride
[19:52.000 --> 19:53.000]  Is twice as bad for them
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  And the cancer rates and diabetes?
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  Here's a Harvard study
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  But that's why we filter our water
[19:58.000 --> 19:59.000]  No, no, they don't do that
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  It's all they'll get us fighting
[20:00.000 --> 20:03.000]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  And only one system allows you to generate
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.000]  An endless supply of natural silver solutions

[20:11.000 --> 20:14.000]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions

[20:20.000 --> 20:21.000]  Targets respiratory infections

[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  And Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com
[20:28.000 --> 20:40.000]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  Do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone

[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  Blockitpocket.com
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  Enhancing health and privacy
[21:00.000 --> 21:01.000]  Hey, how you doing?
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000]  Good, brother
[21:02.000 --> 21:03.000]  Just recently started using your products
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  Everything you said about them is correct
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  And that's made a lot of changes in our lives here
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.000]  Well, thank you, brother
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  It's because it also funds our operation
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  But doing that I know I've got to have the highest quality
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  Super-male vitality was developed
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  To activate your body's own natural processes
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  Instead of using synthetic chemicals
[21:22.000 --> 21:25.000]  We did the super-male and the super-female vitality
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  Big changes, a lot of energy
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  Energy shots, they've got a ton of money there
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs

[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  Call right now
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  So when I say
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  Welcome back folks, Alex Jones here live
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  When I say that the social engineers
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  Are turning this whole country into a giant reeducation camp
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  And Europe as well
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  Remember the Attorney General said
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  In a media meeting with TV executives
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  We need to literally brainwash the public
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  Into accepting turning their guns in
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  And a few years ago, News Corp.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  Put out a promo video
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  Internally to the US government
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.000]  Saying we have complied with your directives
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  Here are every TV show and movie we've produced
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  Promoting global warming and carbon taxes
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  And then it's their directors and actors
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  Going, and actresses going
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  Thank you federal government
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  We have followed your directive
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  I mean I've played that video probably 8 or 9 times
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  I forget the article Watson wrote about it years ago
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  So they go to meetings
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  They comply, it's an admitted agenda
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  And for so many years
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  It was hard to get the public to even admit
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  That there was a pre-planned
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  Commanded with military precision
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  Program
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  Now they admit what they call
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  A behavior placement
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  I call it brainwashing placement
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  Or propaganda placement
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  And so now the UN panel
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  To consider US failure
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  To clear up racial murders
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  Of civil rights era
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  And now they're talking about
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  Not opening our borders completely
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  We may go under UN sanctions
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  So you see where this is going
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  And people said, oh that'll never happen to the US
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  Oh, the UN is getting ready
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  To put sanctions with the US on Israel
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  That's in the news
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  You can say well Israel deserves it or whatever
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  Well see you've just fallen to the trap
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  Now you're under global control
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  So
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  The UN who was in the news
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  A couple years ago in the New York Times
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  Even admitting
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  That UN peacekeepers line up
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  Whole African villages and blow their heads off
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  To take their land for carbon sinks
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  That is a carbon easement
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  Oh you want to build a gold mine over here
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  For some globalist company
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  In that case it was a lithium mine
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  That's fine
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  You've got to clear these villagers off
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  And make this a nature preserve
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  Oh that's okay
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  Mowing them down is alright
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  If Bill and Melinda Gates
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  In India have 64,000 paralyzed kids
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  Several thousand that died
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  Advertising in the polio vaccine
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  That's loving and liberal
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  Because we didn't say it was politically incorrect
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  Actually killing them and maiming them
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  Is trendy and loving
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  Those heads off or chop them up in the womb
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  It's good
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  But when you go to Starbucks
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  Hi oh oh
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  You'd like a grande or whatever
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  Trendy name we have today
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  That's fine oh hi I notice you're white
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  I am too
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  We need to all work on race relations together
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  It's kind of bad that we're white alright
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  Oh my gosh oh my gosh you're black
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  I just want to say that I worship you
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  And I'm real sorry for all I've done
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  To make everybody uncomfortable and weird
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  Imagine if I walked around my office
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  And walked up to Jakari Jackson
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  And said I'm really sorry I'm white
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  I just don't want to thank you for being black
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  Or if
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  Maybe if somebody has a beard
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  Somebody doesn't have a beard you walk up and you say
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  You know it's okay that you don't have a beard
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  Okay it's alright
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  Or maybe one of our guys with a beard walks up to one of the women
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  That works here and said I want you to know that I'm different
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  From you but I don't mean anything bad by it
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  I know it may make you uncomfortable that I have a beard
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  I mean that's the level of mental illness
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  They're trying to impose on us
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  Where we're just totally screwed up
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  Obsessed with everything that's being said
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  To where I have repeatedly been in crowds of people
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  And heard someone go I want Chinese food tonight
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  And everybody goes you said the word Chinese
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  They now are using the word Lunar New Year
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  You don't want to say Chinese New Year
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  Or oh my gosh
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  In Europe they're banning the word black bird
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  Because it's racist
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  But don't worry they're also going to ban the word
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  White Bird
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  Snow Owl
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  Or brown bag
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  Colors everything
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  Racism racism black table
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  And see I put my elbows on this black table
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  We didn't choose a black table
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  Because it picks up the reflections
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  And looks powerful and cool
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  And like the deck of the Death Star
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  No no we chose it so I could put my elbows
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  On the black people
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  Yes everything is code
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  Except the mass murder of black people
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  Worldwide by the eugenicist globalist
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  This is all psych warfare on record
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  Hi I'd like a
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  Small cup of coffee
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  And one of those blueberry muffins please
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  You mean you'd like a tall
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  Using their psych warfare notice a tall
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  A little coffee is not a tall
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  But it's all part of the
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  Everything's about scrambling
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  Confusing up turning reality
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  Where you have no bearing where they can control you
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  You go to those three McDonald's
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  Outfit down on four street
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  And red river
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  Goes down to four street
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.000]  And there's just mutated dead babies
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  And skulls in a giant wrap
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  100 yards around it and I'm looking at it
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  Tuesday on air and I go
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  That looks like DU mutated babies
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  I said Google that we pulled it up and I go
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  Yep bloated lips the eyeballs that way
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  I go I've only seen that one other place
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  It's mutated babies from
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  Feluja and then we went oh my god
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  And learned it was a TV
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  Show on Cartoon Network about
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  After a nuclear apocalypse all the
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  Mutated babies
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  So see if you people at first
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  Were getting tweets and comments oh you're nuts
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  There's not mutated DU babies
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  Yes mutated DU
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  Rotting babies with puss balls
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  And puss marks all over their arms
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  With diseases dying
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  In pain and dead babies
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  With skulls and satanic
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  Lightning balls at McDonald's
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  This is in your face these people are sick

[32:50.720 --> 32:55.920]  now available in our limited first run at infowarslife.com, that's infowarslife.com or

[33:06.520 --> 33:12.200]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[33:12.200 --> 33:42.040]  I think Merrill Hack may have the best voice in country.
[33:42.040 --> 33:57.080]  The problem is he doesn't have the best written songs, powerful, oh but we're told it's the
[33:57.080 --> 34:01.360]  end of the age of humans and the beautiful voices and the beautiful literature and the
[34:01.360 --> 34:07.720]  beautiful poetry and the beautiful sculpting and the beautiful adventures and the friendships
[34:07.720 --> 34:13.680]  and the kinship and the passion and the love and the struggles and everything our ancestors
[34:13.680 --> 34:18.760]  built to this point now, just to know a bunch of political correctness, you go to planet
[34:18.760 --> 34:24.240]  fitness and if you barely bang weights, alarms go off and men in pink outfits show up and
[34:24.240 --> 34:30.960]  go ehh, ehh, just training us to live in a giant impact prison.
[34:30.960 --> 34:35.800]  You go get a Starbucks coffee, oh my gosh you wear your white privilege, in fact I didn't
[34:35.800 --> 34:41.600]  cover it yesterday, under the cover of exposing white privilege, they're now teaching in Kentucky
[34:41.600 --> 34:48.120]  under federal grants, it's mainstream news, five-year-olds about how to exchange gender
[34:48.120 --> 34:56.320]  fluids, how to, I can't even say this on air, I was reading what they're teaching five-year-olds
[34:56.320 --> 35:03.160]  and I didn't even know about this being a 41-year-old worldly person I thought, who's
[35:03.160 --> 35:09.480]  been around the block a couple times, maybe a couple hundred times and I was reading the
[35:09.480 --> 35:15.520]  transcripts of what they teach and I can't say it on air, in fact it's not even in the
[35:15.520 --> 35:22.440]  article you gotta link through, you guys pull that up for me, it was in the stack, I said
[35:22.440 --> 35:28.680]  I'd get to it, I mean, this is a psych warfare attack, white privilege conference workshop
[35:28.680 --> 35:35.320]  pushes grade school lessons about genderqueer transgender folks and exchanging gender fluids
[35:35.320 --> 35:39.520]  lecturing elementary school aged children, I'm not kidding, it's five-year-olds about
[35:39.520 --> 35:50.640]  gay, lesbian and transgender issues, holy Toledo, I'm 41 and I was reading this and learning
[35:50.640 --> 35:58.240]  things that five-year-olds are learning and then if you don't go along with it, you hate
[35:58.240 --> 36:03.200]  gay people, notice how they just keep pushing or if you don't accept herding your guns in,
[36:03.200 --> 36:11.360]  you hate black people, do you understand the left at the top knows that they are not liberals,
[36:11.360 --> 36:17.160]  that they are not freedom pushers, they are tyrants, they have stolen every word out there,
[36:17.160 --> 36:29.320]  they are a menace and they are social engineers with a plan, an in-game 1.5 that was released
[36:29.320 --> 36:37.960]  to prisonplanet.tv, an addendum to the film, we have Dr. Kaufman, university professor and
[36:37.960 --> 36:42.240]  he's going over university documents that we show on screen from Columbia, you name it,
[36:42.240 --> 36:46.800]  where they said in 1963, we're gonna break the family up, we're gonna call it a civil
[36:46.800 --> 36:52.040]  rights issue, we're gonna push infertility with chemicals and vaccines and things, we
[36:52.040 --> 36:58.240]  gotta find that clip from that film and show that to folks and we're going to then move
[36:58.240 --> 37:05.120]  past quote, gay rights to hundreds of different designations and then we're gonna end sexuality
[37:05.120 --> 37:09.600]  and make it totally asexual where there is no sexuality and that's the new thing they
[37:09.600 --> 37:15.240]  push for men and women to both look the same, act the same and basically have no sexuality,
[37:15.240 --> 37:22.040]  in a horrible world they wanna build, what an anti-liberal world, what a group of just
[37:22.040 --> 37:29.120]  horrible anti-humans, they are enemies, I mean let me tell you something, let me tell
[37:29.120 --> 37:33.160]  you, I run an operation with 50 crew members and I've worked in other businesses and I've
[37:33.160 --> 37:36.440]  worked as a salesman and I've worked as a dental assistant and I've worked on a golf
[37:36.440 --> 37:40.920]  course and I've worked as a ranch hand, you start getting into people's business, you
[37:40.920 --> 37:46.760]  start stirring stuff up, you get fights, the way to have quote different humans with different
[37:46.760 --> 37:52.040]  pigment to get along with each other is to go out and eat, is to go out and play golf,
[37:52.040 --> 37:59.160]  is to go out and see a movie or a show, is to hang out with people, to go play flag football,
[37:59.160 --> 38:05.880]  to go to the gym, to go to the coffee shop and that's what everybody's already doing
[38:05.880 --> 38:09.280]  and so the globalists wanna keep this whole race thing going to get us all each other's
[38:09.280 --> 38:17.280]  throats and Starbucks is a horribly evil organization, the CEO of Starbucks knows full well what
[38:17.280 --> 38:23.560]  he's doing, he's like I want everybody to be liberal, it's like how do we get people
[38:23.560 --> 38:28.080]  to accept a prison, well at Planet Fitness we have alarms on the walls and we boss you
[38:28.080 --> 38:31.680]  around constantly and we don't allow anybody who's got big muscles to be in there because
[38:31.680 --> 38:36.520]  when everyone to just feel like they're working out but not actually work out, we don't wanna
[38:36.520 --> 38:42.040]  challenge anyone, first they banned dodgeball 20 years ago, now they've banned tag or running
[38:42.040 --> 38:48.600]  in most schools, look it up, they've gotten rid of PE and now in the gym you can't grunt
[38:48.600 --> 38:53.880]  or slam weights and they have alarms on the walls and if you complain about a 400 pound
[38:53.880 --> 39:01.040]  man in drag in the restroom acting weird you get thrown out when they're not even a member,
[39:01.040 --> 39:07.920]  it's the new class, they're the gods so more people adopt it to be part of a privileged
[39:07.920 --> 39:16.280]  group, it's a new class system to replace an old class system, Starbucks hit by cascade
[39:16.280 --> 39:21.800]  of negativity after ordering staff to talk racism with customers, vice president forced
[39:21.800 --> 39:32.120]  off twitter as angry public turns on patronizing, project, it's so patronizing, oh hi you wanna
[39:32.120 --> 39:38.280]  spend money, oh my gosh you're white, I mean we are, you're white too, I'm a 18 year old
[39:38.280 --> 39:44.400]  and I wanna boss around some 60 year old getting coffee, kind of privilege, you know all sex
[39:44.400 --> 39:50.280]  is rape, hey we're fighting racism, oh really, yeah we're gonna teach your 5 year old about
[39:50.280 --> 39:59.040]  how to drink, I can't even say it on air, people say it's crazy, no it's not crazy,
[39:59.040 --> 40:03.520]  it's a takeover plan, if they can teach 5 year olds how to do things I can't say on
[40:03.520 --> 40:12.000]  the air then they can do anything and you know what they are, they're gonna bring TB
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.480]  in, they're gonna bring syphilis in, they're gonna bring every disease in, they're gonna
[40:16.480 --> 40:20.600]  let it spread, they're gonna get away with everything, they're gonna taser you to death,
[40:20.600 --> 40:23.720]  they're gonna bring in world government, they're gonna raise your taxes to pay off
[40:23.720 --> 40:27.840]  foreign banks money we don't even know, they're gonna do it all and the whole time dance around,
[40:27.840 --> 40:34.480]  I saw Google got caught in a bunch of new stuff and then when they talked to one of
[40:34.480 --> 40:40.160]  their presidents they said, but we wear fluffy socks, that's in my stack, they're like what
[40:40.160 --> 40:45.760]  about Google getting hacked and all your pass codes being taken and Google spying on people,
[40:45.760 --> 40:52.200]  we wear fluffy socks, almost every photo of Warren Buffett, a master wicked operative
[40:52.200 --> 40:56.480]  involved with his banks with money laundering, narcotics trafficking that's in Bloomberg,
[40:56.480 --> 41:02.320]  AP Reuters, but in almost every photo he goes I'm just a little old man and he goes
[41:02.320 --> 41:06.760]  ice cream, Google Warren Buffett's name and click images, almost every image and he goes
[41:06.760 --> 41:12.200]  ice cream and it's like Google goes I'm wearing a pink and a green sock and I got a little
[41:12.200 --> 41:16.600]  beard and I talk like this, you know what those guys do when they get on jets, they
[41:16.600 --> 41:22.000]  go bring me 15 hookers now and get the drugs ready and take me to the private island,
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.280]  get the mechanic rituals ready, I'm literally folks, I've been at the highest levels of
[41:26.280 --> 41:33.000]  Hollywood okay and they get on that aircraft and I mean they are just like shut the door
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.800]  let's get this going, give me the up heads up future predicting dialer, I want the sat
[41:38.800 --> 41:43.600]  phone on, scramble to NSA headquarters, prepare to run ops and they just sit there fixing
[41:43.600 --> 41:48.400]  the stock market and making billions on the side every few days and just like a huge pleasure
[41:48.400 --> 41:56.080]  aircraft with 14, 15, 20 top you know models in the back, look it up, that's come out about
[41:56.080 --> 42:01.760]  just a pleasure aircraft, but out front they're like did you notice I'm wearing, I always
[42:01.760 --> 42:07.320]  say the thing about the socks because with Google they go I've got different color socks,
[42:07.320 --> 42:11.960]  meanwhile you're literally dealing with a Psyop Satanist, with black op command forces
[42:11.960 --> 42:16.920]  predicting the future, with spy grid, AI going in everywhere, they can go in and punch up
[42:16.920 --> 42:22.000]  AI heads up, world models that the Pentagon has as well, integrated and actually know
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.760]  the future, they're in there like Sauron or Sauron and just dark sorcerers, total power
[42:27.760 --> 42:38.360]  and meanwhile they're like are you racist, I'm wearing fluffy socks and that's the reason
[42:38.360 --> 42:42.160]  I act like this because I've been around some of these people, I've been at some of the
[42:42.160 --> 42:47.400]  parties with the Facebook people and Google people and they see me and they just leave
[42:47.400 --> 42:53.760]  or they say get him out of here and they see me and they it'll be like let's go, let's
[42:53.760 --> 42:58.640]  get an old leave and that's the look on it, I mean they'll literally go just let me know
[42:58.640 --> 43:07.920]  I know you Jones, liberal I'm liberal, just wait till I liberal everybody, we're gonna
[43:07.920 --> 43:20.080]  teach your five year olds, you understand your chumps out there liberals, in fact I
[43:20.080 --> 43:24.840]  can't find it in the stack, you guys Google, Google, go to the NSA interface, they just
[43:24.840 --> 43:32.560]  opt in, opt into the NSA interface and just put in Google fluffy socks and people can
[43:32.560 --> 43:36.440]  say I mean I'm not joking and they're always like but we have pinball machines and let
[43:36.440 --> 43:44.000]  people drink beer at lunch and we have movies about the interns, we're liberal, liberal,
[43:44.000 --> 43:51.960]  there's nothing liberal about it, there it is, you guys print me that article please,
[43:51.960 --> 44:02.360]  don't trust humans, wear fluffy socks, wisdom from Google X, see they're already saying
[44:02.360 --> 44:08.480]  don't trust humans to drive cars, time magazine, don't trust humans, the new liberal system,
[44:08.480 --> 44:14.280]  the computers will make the decisions, where have we heard that before oh Rockefeller Foundation
[44:14.280 --> 44:19.160]  funded groups the New York Times promotes, movies perhaps where we get rid of money and
[44:19.160 --> 44:24.280]  the computers make all the decisions, but don't worry the makers of the films, talk
[44:24.280 --> 44:33.440]  in little lisping voices and they're liberal, we were so desperate that we ended up doing
[44:33.440 --> 44:40.680]  a detailed study about the fluffiness of the socks of the text who did the balloons, they'll
[44:40.680 --> 44:45.800]  just throw out something about don't trust humans, but by the way we talked about fluffy
[44:45.800 --> 44:51.600]  colored socks, now let's pull up Warren Buffett, put in Warren Buffett's name, hit images
[44:51.600 --> 44:58.440]  and you'll see ice cream cone and you know who else goes ice cream cone, pull up in a
[44:58.440 --> 45:10.960]  van, I have ice cream, I have cookies, I have candy five year old, everything's okay, everything
[45:10.960 --> 45:17.480]  is nice, Google Warren Buffett ice cream and then it'll just show hundreds of photos of
[45:17.480 --> 45:24.880]  him with the ice cream cones and then if that doesn't work they go puppy, puppy, I have
[45:24.880 --> 45:33.520]  a puppy, you love puppies, now there he is with ice cream, he's on a banjo and all so
[45:33.520 --> 45:42.000]  non-threatening, a nice man and there he is with his wife and daughter ice cream, oh and
[45:42.000 --> 45:52.480]  another shot of him with a little guitar and a shot of him having a beer, oh nice old man,
[45:52.480 --> 46:03.420]  lives in a modest little house in a mall, meanwhile behind the facade of this innocent
[46:03.420 --> 46:13.040]  looking bookstore, ignore me at your peril, I am here as a watchman to warn you, I have
[46:13.040 --> 46:19.080]  seen, I know, I know who the enemy is and let me tell you they are vicious wolves who hate
[46:19.080 --> 46:25.560]  you and your family and they tell you at McDonald's in downtown Austin, they show mutated dead
[46:25.560 --> 46:31.200]  children with pus pouring out of their eyeballs and welts all over their bodies, enter here
[46:31.200 --> 46:37.480]  at your own risk and doom and the fools throng and their subconscious sees it, I am being
[46:37.480 --> 46:41.400]  delivered unto death, I am being delivered unto poison, I am being delivered just like
[46:41.400 --> 46:45.320]  the golden child allegory, great Eddie Murphy movie where they're trying to make the golden
[46:45.320 --> 46:52.680]  child drink the tainted blood, that's exactly what they're telling you, come, come and drink
[46:52.680 --> 47:02.440]  from the well, join us, come and be one with us forever, but we must first warn them, we
[47:02.440 --> 47:09.840]  must first let them know before they pass the gate, now I said I would get to the economic
[47:09.840 --> 47:15.360]  news and I will start doing that with the graph, we actually start the next hour and
[47:15.360 --> 47:21.720]  I will get into all the other news here that we're going to be breaking down, but it's
[47:21.720 --> 47:26.360]  all about them looking non-threatening and just arbiters, we just want to stop the racism
[47:26.360 --> 47:29.960]  and their internal documents come out and they're funding every form of division they
[47:29.960 --> 47:40.520]  can because they are predators and people are backlashing against it, here's the good
[47:40.520 --> 47:47.640]  news, they expect some backlash and back talk, but then they always press back again hoping
[47:47.640 --> 47:52.000]  you finally submit, but instead we're just getting matter and matter and matter and matter
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.080]  and seeing through it and understanding it because we're becoming spiritually immune
[47:56.080 --> 48:03.960]  to it, now there are some who are done, there are some who you can't help, but those people
[48:03.960 --> 48:12.600]  don't count unfortunately, they have been taken over, coming up, exclusive, US likely
[48:12.600 --> 48:17.040]  to delay, plan closures of two Afghan bases, I said six, seven years ago that Obama would
[48:17.040 --> 48:20.640]  never end the Afghan war, that they would always just claim next year, next year, it's
[48:20.640 --> 48:23.640]  just a tactic, a stalling tactic, I know you already know that, but just become aware of
[48:23.640 --> 48:33.080]  these tactics, become conscious of these tactics, Obama calls for mandatory voting, breastfeeding,
[48:33.080 --> 48:36.040]  I've always talked about this earlier in the studies, but it's in the LA Times now so it
[48:36.040 --> 48:42.320]  exists, babies who nurse earn more as adults studies says, yeah and you know why they do
[48:42.320 --> 48:48.760]  because the brain CC size in some cases is upwards of a third larger and I breastfed
[48:48.760 --> 48:53.520]  until I was 18 months old, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not bragging or anything, but I have
[48:53.520 --> 48:58.920]  a very large CC size brain and my bones are very, very hard and I'm very, very hearty
[48:58.920 --> 49:04.160]  and I'm very, very mean and I don't get sick very often and it's because a woman's milk
[49:04.160 --> 49:09.080]  gives you all of her immunities and all of her different hormones that activate brain
[49:09.080 --> 49:14.920]  development, what a conspiracy theory, women have those to feed the young of this mammal
[49:14.920 --> 49:23.120]  species and that you do better with the milk of your species and of your genetic creator,
[49:23.120 --> 49:25.280]  your mama.
[49:25.280 --> 49:30.400]  This apple don't fall far from the tree and you don't either and I sit there and argue
[49:30.400 --> 49:33.720]  with women and people that I know that are having kids, people that know me, they go
[49:33.720 --> 49:36.840]  yeah I just need to get back to work though, I don't think we're going to breastfeed maybe
[49:36.840 --> 49:41.680]  a week, I just, I go okay so you want your kid to have one third smaller brain, oh come
[49:41.680 --> 49:47.000]  on, oh you know kids, Alex, come on, yeah, come on, that's rude, come on, okay great,
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.560]  do you want to shake your child and have one third of their brain removed, let me put
[49:50.560 --> 49:54.360]  it to you that way, real, they're like you know what, I'm really worried about racism
[49:54.360 --> 50:01.920]  right now, you know what fluoride does to your brain, massively rots holes in it basically,
[50:01.920 --> 50:07.560]  look it up yourself, see there's a plan here, there's a reason people are so stupid, we've
[50:07.560 --> 50:14.880]  been militarily targeted by the globalists for a long, long, long, long time, they couldn't
[50:14.880 --> 50:19.000]  take us in a frontal assault, the scientific technocrats took us down in a chem assault
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.280]  and a bio assault and they've done a really great job and what I'm telling you is the
[50:23.280 --> 50:26.480]  truth, it's not exaggerated, it's much worse than what I'm saying, there's no way to go
[50:26.480 --> 50:31.160]  over the full spectrum of this and yeah it freaks me out, yeah it's crazy, but see I'm
[50:31.160 --> 50:36.760]  not crazy because I'm freaked out by bloated dead DU babies and skulls with satanic lightning
[50:36.760 --> 50:40.840]  bolts all over their heads, showing they have the mark of the beast and we're struck down
[50:40.840 --> 50:48.240]  by Lucifer, I'm not, the ones we're showing aren't even the shock, they show the skulls,
[50:48.240 --> 50:53.240]  the lightning bolts, they show the arm with the pus tools all over it, reaching out for
[50:53.240 --> 50:59.760]  a baby, I mean it's kind of like Jack Kevorkian's art, demon eating babies coming out of women,
[50:59.760 --> 51:00.760]  very loving and liberal.

[54:10.600 --> 54:16.120]  I kind of got wound up folks by all the sick culture destroying garbage, when McDonald
[54:16.120 --> 54:21.840]  shows images of dead rotting babies and skulls and mutated DU babies, they're the most horrible
[54:21.840 --> 54:25.520]  thing you've ever seen in your life, you can see the real thing, they are throwing it in
[54:25.520 --> 54:29.880]  your subconscious face that you're crap when you come in here to get this free food that
[54:29.880 --> 54:32.360]  South by Southwest where they're handing it out.
[54:32.360 --> 54:38.000]  And by the way, this is not my opinion, it has been again declassified hundreds of different
[54:38.000 --> 54:45.440]  ways that the CIA from the 50s on had a plan to put out ugly art to basically scramble
[54:45.440 --> 54:50.720]  people's brains so they would accept degradation in the future.
[54:50.720 --> 54:55.960]  And you can just Google CIA used ugly art as propaganda and they kind of whitewash it
[54:55.960 --> 54:58.280]  but it was in the New York Times last year.
[54:58.280 --> 55:05.000]  This is what they're doing and they're demonizing anything beautiful which isn't part of their
[55:05.000 --> 55:10.120]  system where they only allow select beauty when they control it, just like you can buy
[55:10.120 --> 55:16.080]  video games and murder people all day in simulations if you're a 12 year old, but if you at school
[55:16.080 --> 55:20.920]  draw a gun, you'll be arrested, there's no law, they just do it.
[55:20.920 --> 55:24.920]  So you're being taught that you individually can't create or do anything, only the system
[55:24.920 --> 55:25.920]  can.
[55:25.920 --> 55:30.960]  There it is, open culture, how the CIA secretly funded abstract expressionism during the Cold
[55:30.960 --> 55:35.280]  War and that's a whitewash article, you actually read it, it was ugly art.
[55:35.280 --> 55:38.880]  And again, I get some ugly art is actually beautiful if you understand it, but it was
[55:38.880 --> 55:49.120]  done to subvert and now it's degenerated down to mutated babies at McDonald's advertising
[55:49.120 --> 55:52.800]  the food.
[55:52.800 --> 55:57.040]  Before I go any further, ladies and gentlemen, the system knows what they're doing stopping
[55:57.040 --> 56:02.240]  breastfeeding, they know what they're doing, stopping people getting healthy organic food,
[56:02.240 --> 56:04.720]  they know what they're doing putting fluoride in the water, they know what they're doing
[56:04.720 --> 56:09.960]  giving us vaccines, pull of cancer, viruses and mercury, this is an attack in eco science
[56:09.960 --> 56:14.240]  written by the White House Sciences are talks about it, but that's just one publication.
[56:14.240 --> 56:18.240]  Now I'm going to start the next hour and try to get a little bit more professional.
[56:18.240 --> 56:20.080]  I mean, I think we covered a lot of issues.
[56:20.080 --> 56:24.000]  We had William Benny in studio went out to dinner with him last night, then we interviewed
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.240]  him driving around a car for another 45 minutes after dinner.
[56:27.240 --> 56:35.320]  I mean, you're talking about the head of operations at the NSA.
[56:35.320 --> 56:40.480]  Before that, the head of offensive operations against the Russians and others, an incredibly
[56:40.480 --> 56:47.880]  famous code breaker, a M theory quantum mechanics, physicists, basically, and I mean, the dinner
[56:47.880 --> 56:50.560]  discussions were over the top.
[56:50.560 --> 56:53.840]  And he was telling me about how Nick Cage is going to be playing him in a new big movie
[56:53.840 --> 56:59.800]  with Oliver Stone, he was trying to be not arrogant, humble, but it's not really a,
[56:59.800 --> 57:02.600]  it's a Snowden slash film about him.
[57:02.600 --> 57:05.760]  Another actor played, but the main guy's Nick Cage playing him amazing.
[57:05.760 --> 57:08.600]  So good job for Oliver Stone going in that direction.
[57:08.600 --> 57:12.160]  Other documentaries he's making.
[57:12.160 --> 57:15.600]  It's just so exciting to me that was like hanging around with the biggest rock star
[57:15.600 --> 57:16.600]  ever.
[57:16.600 --> 57:19.400]  And I've hung around with some great rock stars like Dave Mustaine, Billy Corgan and
[57:19.400 --> 57:20.400]  others.
[57:20.400 --> 57:23.400]  But I like them not just because I like their music, but because they're smart people that
[57:23.400 --> 57:27.600]  care about liberty and will speak out against tyranny and get repercussions for it.
[57:27.600 --> 57:29.320]  Well, they're real men.
[57:29.320 --> 57:30.320]  They have honor.
[57:30.320 --> 57:31.320]  They have courage.
[57:31.320 --> 57:38.560]  I know rock stars bigger than those guys, bigger, in fact, as big as it gets.
[57:38.560 --> 57:42.160]  And it's not much bigger than people like Dave Mustaine and Billy Corgan, but bigger.
[57:42.160 --> 57:44.600]  And they're scared to death to speak out.
[57:44.600 --> 57:46.760]  Well, that's why this show's so important.
[57:46.760 --> 57:52.040]  We're not afraid because we know the cost if these evil people take over.
[57:52.040 --> 57:53.040]  Okay?
[57:53.040 --> 57:55.320]  We understand it's all in or nothing.
[57:55.320 --> 57:56.320]  I'm not submitting.
[57:56.320 --> 57:57.720]  I'm not dying on my knees in a ditch.
[57:57.720 --> 57:59.520]  I'm going to stand up fighting.
[57:59.520 --> 58:03.080]  That's why I've extended because people were complaining saying, you know, please extend
[58:03.080 --> 58:06.720]  it or whatever through the weekends, folks that get paid on Fridays or whatever.
[58:06.720 --> 58:07.720]  People just love sales.

[58:50.240 --> 58:53.880]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[58:53.880 --> 58:58.240]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[58:58.240 --> 59:00.240]  Can you put two and two together?
[59:00.240 --> 59:05.840]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds is reasonably
[59:05.840 --> 59:07.880]  priced and fully legal.

[59:28.360 --> 59:31.640]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:10.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.960]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.120]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:18.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:29.160]  All right, here's what's coming up.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.320]  I'm going to go through a bunch of news.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.760]  I've already mentioned the headlines on.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.440]  Hit a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet and then take your phone calls.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.880]  First thing we're going to hit in the next segment, 10 charts which show we are much
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.280]  worse off than just before the last economic crisis.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:48.120]  And that dovetails with Fed opens door water for rate hike, but downgrades economic outlook.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:56.240]  And that ties into Swedish Central Bank cuts key rate further below zero and a new bailout
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.240]  is back.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:03.200]  Fannie and Freddie likely needed additional treasury investment after derivatives losses.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:09.240]  So that's coming up some really serious news showing us that where most of our analysts
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:14.400]  and economists and experts have said, we're going, we are indeed going.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:19.440]  And I also want to get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on the broadcast soon to get into this new
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.720]  Chinese investment, Asian investment bank led by the Chinese communist government.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.880]  He'll be on Friday at 1.30 PM.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.440]  He's on Friday at 1.30 PM.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.440]  Great job, Nico.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.240]  Nico does a great job booking many of our guests in there and kind of quarterbacking
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.920]  the show.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.760]  And so that is exciting that we've got him coming on the transmission.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:42.000]  Do we have the guy that wrote Robo apocalypse coming on?
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  Not yet.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  Okay.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  Good.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  We're working on that top.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  April 3rd is the day we're looking at.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  Okay.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  Good.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  Why not?
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  We're so busy around here.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  We just produced and planned everything right here on there.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.240]  I'm tempted to do a real reality show around the office where we have certain zones in
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.280]  the office that have live cameras and audio.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.960]  And if people go into those areas, they know that's there and I predict it'll become quite
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.960]  popular.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.960]  Yes.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.960]  Well, Joe Jennings is shaking his head, Joe.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:13.000]  Let's cut to Joe a video feed of your radio listener in full wars.com, four slash show.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.480]  Let's cut to that video feed, Joe.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.840]  I want you guys to get, you know, get quick on the draw coming on air.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.040]  Joe, what do you think of that idea?
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.440]  It's okay that you don't have a beard.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.800]  Joe, your, your name Joe, you're here to buy coffee.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.520]  I see it's Joe Jennings on your credit card.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:35.480]  What do you want to say about the fact that you're white and that you is, is Jennings Scottish
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.200]  or is that even worse?
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.200]  Is that English?
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.920]  What's the derivation of that name?
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.920]  I know that's white.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:41.920]  That's, that's bad.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.320]  I'm going to have to, oh my gosh.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.320]  It's opaque.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:48.440]  You actually, you're not white.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.120]  You are kind of pinkish.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:56.720]  That's a, that's the anger of all the different cultures that I have in my bloodline.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.440]  My mind, my mind seems kind of red with little brown spots.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.800]  What does that make me?
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.240]  A McDonald's eater?
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.240]  A McDonald's.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:08.160]  Well, you got to be green with giant blown out puss lips from the D. U. I shouldn't even
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.160]  joke about it.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.120]  I mean, when I saw those dead D. U. babies, I said, those are like dead D. U. babies.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:15.160]  Then we Googled and found that it's from a show about D. U. babies.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.760]  Um, I just can't get over the, no one cares.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.760]  Oh yeah.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.720]  Dead D. U. babies, arms with pustules all over them.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.280]  Can we go to the video or go shoot some high def photos, all that?
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.760]  I mean, what did you think when it turned out, what's the name of that show?
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:32.240]  Your land, uh, CJ.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.040]  It's called adventure.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.040]  Adventure time.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.760]  Tell, tell us all about the, uh, the, uh, D. U. Puss babies, I'm going to come back
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.760]  and get to the news.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:39.760]  No, go ahead.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.760]  Sorry.
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.760]  I'm trying to run a video mixer at the same time.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:44.760]  Well, that's all right.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.760]  We're going to get it going here.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.080]  No, it's just a show about post, uh, mushroom war is what the characters call it.
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:57.560]  And half of them are mutated candy that somehow blended with life forms and it's funny.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.560]  It's a cool show.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.440]  It kind of appeals to preteens and adults at the same time.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.280]  Sounds like a ripoff of, um, cloudy with a chance of meatballs.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.200]  And cloudy with a chance of radiated babies.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.200]  Yeah.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:17.520]  Well, don't you think radiated mutated creatures, humanoids, I mean that, that, that's a great
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.640]  way to advertise McDonald's, isn't it?
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.640]  Yeah.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:26.560]  Diabetes and fat folks and in fact, let's look at some of the McDonald's customers
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.560]  here.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:31.560]  Let's blow up that graphic and just kind of look at some of the folks there.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:35.560]  You guys enjoy coming on air impromptu out of the blue.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.560]  Absolutely.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:41.600]  Well, there you have the McDonald's customers, all different, like a tower of Babel fighting
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.480]  with each other with huge loudspeakers going, don't be racist, don't be racist, don't be
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.480]  racist.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.480]  The only crime is being different.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:50.680]  That's why we all brought you in here and made you different and then pointed out how
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.680]  you were different.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.800]  It's got evil than a cold stuff in it too.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:05:00.160]  Oh yeah, I noticed that the perfect lighting multilocifer told her loving, loving.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:06.360]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges, unlock the energy it takes to
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:12.440]  defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality, specifically designed
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:19.000]  to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.720]  and females.

[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:33.720]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:38.080]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.080]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:45.680]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.720]  priced and fully legal.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:55.800]  For how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L, body armor dot com.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.320]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.320]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.320]  Good, brother.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.320]  Just recently started using your products, everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:08.720]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.720]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:12.720]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I'm going to have the
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.280]  highest quality.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:20.600]  Female vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.600]  synthetic chemicals.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:26.800]  We do the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.760]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, a statement, a ton of money
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.760]  there.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:37.440]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated or
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:38.920]  maximum potency.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:43.080]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:47.520]  while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.440]  going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:57.320]  Visit infowarsalife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.360]  from InfoWars Life.
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:04.080]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation,
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:08.480]  the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.880]  This ultra clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:17.560]  the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.160]  essential nutrients.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:24.480]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.480]  by the body.
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:32.560]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin,
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:37.720]  the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.560]  that has been created with our proprietary process.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.440]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.160]  No needles, no injections.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.440]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.440]  Try it for yourself.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.160]  Discover the secret.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.160]  Secret 12.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.640]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:09.640]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:20.520]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:29.160]  NSA whistleblower in fullwars.com, red-linked story, America is no longer a country with
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:33.480]  a government, we're a government with a country.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:37.640]  The country has been captured by the government, and the special interests have captured that
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.640]  government.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.520]  We are, by every definition, a captured country, but the public is starting to see through
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.960]  it on many, many levels.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.120]  Democratic support for Hillary is plummeting.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.600]  New Hampshire voters have panned Bush.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.280]  Jeb Bush still refuses to nix tax hikes, even though we've already seen huge ones, under
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:03.280]  Obama.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:10.600]  Major magazines are saying both the Clintons and the Bushes are past their expiration dates.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:16.920]  Clinton's in trouble running her own separate intel operation.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.000]  So there's some good news on that front.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:25.280]  Obama plots to bypass Yatn Yahu with UN action on the Palestinians, and again, folks, whether
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.840]  you're for the Palestinians or against them, it's all a big tragedy, and I wish for peace
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:30.840]  there.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.600]  But the UN and the globalists could care less about the Palestinians.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.440]  They use it as a political football.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:42.120]  This is about promoting UN as the great arbiter of liberty and freedom and justice.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.320]  We're going to be breaking that down coming up.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.280]  UN panel is considering, quote, US failure on civil rights.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:53.040]  We might get sanctioned by the UN, too.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.600]  That's where all of this is going.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:01.360]  The new crime is that whole countries are guilty of racism.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:06.040]  But of your China and have forced abortions and forced infanticide at Foxcom factories
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.760]  and suicide nets and forced drugging, and your government kills 80-plus million people,
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.160]  well, they're all Chinese, so it's okay.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.800]  As long as Chinese kill Chinese, it's okay.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:22.440]  As long as black kills black, nine out of 10 times, it's okay, just if white kills black.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:26.000]  That's what this is, is mass mental illness where you don't have common sense.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.040]  Having common sense is like being some sort of superhero now with superpowers.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:37.880]  And seeing through how the system just wants a bunch of confused, dumbed down, can we get
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:43.520]  a promo made cutting out the profanity of the late, great George Carlin?
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:49.080]  Not that I'm against his free speech, we just can't air it here with the FCC.
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:55.200]  I mean, they can teach white privilege conference workshop in federally funded in Kentucky, teaching
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:03.440]  a lesson about genderqueer and transgender folks to five-year-olds, which have no business
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.080]  sexualizing confusing children.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.680]  They're not asking sexual questions at that age.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.880]  Put to you this way, if a man walks up to five-year-olds at a fence in a backyard and
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.240]  says, hey, I want to talk to you about sex, it's called being a pedophile.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.920]  When the government does it, oh, it's no big deal.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.560]  And I told you this was the case.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.360]  Now government's coming out in Australia, the U.S. and England and saying, you know
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:28.720]  what, judges and others are coming out and saying, you know what, pedophilia is not illegal,
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.320]  it's love.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.560]  And children can love too, and they have a right.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.640]  Really, does a 10-year-old have a right to be picked up, whether it's a boy or girl
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.760]  or whatever, by a 25-year-old or a 30-year-old?
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.600]  No, because they don't have the age of consent.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:48.440]  That's why you can't give your neighbor kids whiskey when they're 14, you'll get arrested.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:52.840]  That's why you can't get them to sign a contract signing over their paycheck when they're 16
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.320]  because they're not of the age of consent yet until you're 18.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:00.080]  Because we found historically, you make bad decisions until you're 18, and you still make
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.800]  bad decisions after that.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.640]  That's why cons target young people more than anybody.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.240]  Then they target above-80 senile folks.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:13.800]  And that's why Obama is in the news, and that's coming up as well.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:19.400]  In FullWars.com, we have the video, it would be transformative if everybody voted, he said,
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:25.720]  wants to make it the law for mandatory voting, and San Francisco and other Lib groups want
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.840]  to get voting down to 16, and then down to even younger after that.
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.920]  Most 16-year-olds I talk to are either super-awake and super-cool, and that's probably 10% of
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.280]  them, or they don't know what planet they're on.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.440]  We've got a report about millennials.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:48.080]  All they know about is race now, or sexual gender, and all these weird PC words, and
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:56.080]  they've reduced their language down to hashtag terms, and of course most of them didn't breastfeed.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.720]  Study out breastfeeding page, babies who nurse earn more as adults.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:06.240]  Study finds, yeah, 39% more, and you know why, because their brains are bigger and wired
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.880]  right, and I'm not knocking parents, a lot of parents didn't breastfeed, so now they
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:14.360]  feel guilty, or you had an abortion, so you feel guilty, nobody's judged, so your son
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.800]  or daughter has 120 IQ, that would have been 160, it's okay.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:24.520]  You can warn others now, now if your kid was going to have 100, now they got an 80, or
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.720]  I guess 39% would be lower, now it's going to be 70.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.760]  That's why you talk to a lot of people, they ain't there, they got little shriveled brains
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.800]  at age 20, I mean, I've seen the CAT scan studies, they've had them for decades out
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:45.440]  there on people, brain scans, people that were fed formula, and the formula they give
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:50.000]  third world kids, the brain's even smaller, and so basically you wonder why third world
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.800]  people and others that are, you know, the major cities that are on the free UN formula
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:58.520]  that kills so many kids, remember those scandals, oh the formula killed, you know, 20,000 kids
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.920]  in Nigeria, numbers like that, I mean, I don't remember the exact numbers, it was in the
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:06.480]  tens of thousands, guys look up bad formula kills thousands, I mean, it's always the
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.480]  you in India, in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, oh they come in with all this free
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:16.760]  formula and then oh, it didn't have enough protein, sorry, the baby couldn't tell you
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.320]  till they were two, we wonder why you never got out of the crib, the brain's one half
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:28.040]  the size it should be, you were given a lobotomy by lack of calories and lack of protein and
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:32.800]  lack of fat, and you wonder why there's so many Alzheimer patients now, because they're
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:39.680]  on low fat diets and all the aluminum and the rest of it, you're dead, you're dead already,
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.760]  so I understand a lot of new listeners out there can't even understand a word, I'm saying
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:47.800]  I don't talk real slow, and I use complex words, it sounds like I slipped on a fissurist
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:55.440]  when I grew up, but there it is, China Titans baby formula rules after in-z poisoning scare,
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:00.040]  and that's out of Bloomberg, let's remember some headline years ago, like 20,000 kids
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:08.120]  died over the multi-year period, but I want to get into the economy real quick and then
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:11.360]  I'll get into all that and take your phone calls, the toll-free number to join us on
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:22.000]  this live Thursday worldwide broadcast, first time callers again, is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231,
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:30.720]  and if you disagree, Colin, you go to the headline, maybe I'm being a little extreme
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.480]  here, maybe having kids with satanic symbols and bloated, dead-due babies around McDonald's
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:40.920]  with McDonald's signs on them is no big deal, maybe going to Starbucks to get coffee being
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.920]  lectured about white privilege is normal, and even though they admit it's a re-education
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:48.720]  camp program, maybe the government ruling by executive fiat is normal, maybe the new
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:54.640]  announcement of what I'm about to get to on the derivatives is no big deal, maybe having
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:59.720]  all the major TV companies and car companies and world leaders announcing that we're going
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.720]  to ban humans driving cars soon and everything you're doing is being watched and there's
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:09.200]  cameras in your TV watching you, yes, we're listening to you, yes, ha, ha, ha, yes, we're
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:13.600]  going to stop labeling the GMOs, yes, we're not going to label the drugs and the vaccines
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.880]  anymore and even let you know it's in the insert, ha, ha, ha, and we're going to make
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.560]  it mandatory, ha, ha, ha, everything's fine, ha, ha, ha, the border's wide open, we're
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:24.040]  going to give the illegals everything free and free babies and free, ha, ha, ha, this
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:27.680]  is just more fresh meat for the meat grinder, and yes, we're going to put the troops on
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.560]  secret death list and actually let them die of stuff that's totally tradable, ha, it's
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:37.520]  totally normal, everything's fine, I mean, this is what we're dealing with, Rob Dude
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.520]  just came in.
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.520]  Rob, do you want to talk?
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:44.240]  Yeah, Alex, I just found this article, we get to have nap time, it's on Daily Mail,
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.080]  stressed out adults are paying thousands of dollars to attend the world's first preschool
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:52.640]  for grownups, I mean, it's just, it's just getting, we're degenerating.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:57.440]  They're teaching mental illness, I mean, I met with a top psychiatrist slash psychologist
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:02.880]  who was a multi-millionaire and owned a radio station when I was in Minnesota and he was
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:08.080]  revealing to me 15 years ago with Ted Anderson, he wanted to meet with us that he was there
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.880]  at the corporate level talking about the plan to screw the kids up, and there it is, we
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:17.080]  get to have nap time, stressed out adults are paying thousands of dollars to attend
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.000]  the world's very first preschool for grownups, exactly.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.720]  That's the hottest thing in Japan five years running is to wear diapers and poop on yourself.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:29.040]  Yeah, it's just, they're taking the adult, they're making the age of becoming an adult
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.960]  later and later, it used to be, you know, 12, 13, these kids were adults working, you
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.800]  know, doing stuff, helping out with the family and now it's, now it's 18, you have to be
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.160]  18 before you can do anything.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.040]  Well, actually now it's 35, I saw a headline, 35 is the new adult.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:46.080]  Yeah, it's, and they're making it later and later and later.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.360]  And I run into full grown men everywhere that act like five-year-olds and I want to knock
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.360]  their teeth out.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.360]  Yeah.
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.960]  I mean, when I was 14, man, I was, you know, I'd already had more living than the average,
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:59.760]  you know, I'm not just any matter, I'm sorry, go ahead, they don't know what they're
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:00.760]  missing out on, man.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.640]  The transition generation, now it's just full blown, stay a kid as long as you can until
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.640]  you're 25.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:09.960]  I thought my parents were reckless, just turning me loose and let me do whatever I wanted,
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.080]  but I mean, they just didn't want me to be weak.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.640]  My parents weren't even radical, they just made the decision that I was not going to
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:19.440]  be a, I mean, my dad was not a Mr. Macho tough guy, but I'd come home with black eyes if
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.520]  her bullies beat me up when I was 11, he'd say, you better fight harder next time.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.760]  He didn't call the police and I had loose teeth and black eyes and I'm telling you
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:28.560]  that I'm just, thank God I was brought up like that, dude.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:33.040]  Well, there was a story, the other day, a lady calls the cops to come teach her son
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.280]  about stealing, eight-year-olds stole some money out of the purse.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:40.680]  They ended up, one of the cops got mad and started calling her, you know, you black
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.960]  B-I-T-C-H and arrested her for wasting their time.
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:49.480]  But it's like, you don't call the cops for something stupid like that, the cops are
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.600]  trained now to arrest people, they're trained to bring in revenue.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:55.840]  So they're looking at you as a milk cow and when you call them into, oh, I'm going to
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:58.240]  teach my son a lesson and have the cops, you know.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.120]  What about the lady's Big Mac was called so they called the cops?
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.120]  It's ridiculous.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.560]  You know, people think that the cops are going to solve your problems, they're not there
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:06.560]  to solve your problems.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.080]  Well, notice, don't, don't discipline your kid, but then when they grew up to be delinquent,
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.440]  the cops kill them or taser them.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.440]  Yeah.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.040]  Now it's just a par for the course.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:18.520]  I'm working on a, a, a report right now.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:24.080]  I went and shot some detailed shots of all those, uh, aborted dead babies, DU babies around
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:27.800]  the, uh, McDonald's and, uh, I'm going to, I've found photographs that compare them
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:31.040]  exactly like the one-eyed thing with the, the eye in the middle.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.040]  No, it's clear.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.200]  The show got it from DU Iraq babies.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.200]  Yeah.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.200]  It's disgusting.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.720]  So I'll have a report for that tonight for the, uh, for the nightly news.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.360]  I'm going to take some of what you said today.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:45.840]  I think you just spelled it out really clearly and, uh, people, and then, you know, this,
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:50.000]  this whole, when you walk around South by everybody's walking around looking for free
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  stuff.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.200]  It's just, it's a, it's a, what do we call it a, uh, did Joe Biggs want to comment on
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.200]  something?
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.200]  I see him there.
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.200]  He's got something he's going to talk to you about break, uh, during the break.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.200]  He's got.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.200]  Sorry I'm running late.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.680]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.

[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:16.360]  Boy, we couldn't have a better intro coming in, that wasn't planned, that just auto-played.
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:20.200]  We've got huge breaking news, ladies and gentlemen, it's going to be happening in Austin's back
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:25.760]  door, Joe Biggs, CombatVet, US Army, Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:32.160]  We were sent by one of our insiders, one of my insiders, a very good source in, let's
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:38.400]  just say, in telecoms in the whole NSA area.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:43.800]  This open-source document that no one has seen, but that is buried on the official Special
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:46.960]  Forces Command out of Florida's site.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.720]  And Joe Biggs, when he read it during the last break, we knew exactly what we were seeing.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.880]  This is sensational news.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:58.120]  If we, they want to hide this as a psyop in plain view for the troops, to brainwash them,
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:02.800]  the local police and the citizens, they say this is to gain the hearts and minds of the
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.160]  people of Texas, they're doing these all over the country, and Texas is one of the only
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.600]  states in the US on the map.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.640]  Do they have it to pull up in there?
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:11.640]  This is sensational.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.640]  I want people to see.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.320]  Texas is listed in red as a hostile sector.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:21.320]  I told you I'm deep behind enemy lines, folks, I mean, we are listed as a hostile sector.
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:27.640]  They're having Delta Force Navy SEALs with the Army trained to basically take over.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:30.320]  This is over the top.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.280]  Texas is listed as a hostile sector.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.920]  Now, of course we are.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.360]  We're here defending the Republic and the military's awake.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.120]  This is what's waking them up.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.040]  But my gosh, Joe, we just got this information.
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:47.160]  And they actually admit it's a psyop and it's public, but no one knew about it.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:56.400]  Thank God our, let's just say, intel friends sent us this, US Army Special Operations unclassified.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.280]  And let's give people the code number up there at the top.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.280]  Joe, tell folks about this.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.160]  All right, so this is a request to conduct realistic military training.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.800]  The operation is going to be called Jade Helm 15.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:08.880]  The commander of United States Army Special Operations Command seeks a written invitation
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:13.600]  and approval from local law officials to conduct realistic military training.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:18.100]  So like I said, this is going to be realistic military training conducted outside of federally
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:19.200]  owned property.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.640]  Outside Camp Swift and Bastrop.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:24.000]  This will be in American citizens backyards.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.560]  So it says it'll be conducting all kinds of role playing.
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:32.000]  It is a challenging eight week joint military and interagency unconventional warfare exercise
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.400]  conducted throughout Texas.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:39.120]  Now I said this operation will be running from July 15 to 15 September.
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.880]  And the participants will be US Army Special Forces, US Navy Seals, US Air Force Special
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:48.920]  Operations Command, USMC Marine Special Operations Command, the Marine Expeditionary Unit.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:54.880]  This is a Northcom Joint Forces warfare planning operation.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.880]  Keep going.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.440]  And this is, like you said, it's going to be a complete and total sigh up.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:02.320]  And one of the main things that I saw when I was looking at this, it lists Texas in red.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.680]  And then when you look at the legend, it says red is hostile.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.640]  So for some reason, Texas is red, but then when you go on, it says the hone advanced
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:15.160]  skills and military interagency require large areas of undeveloped land with low population
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.880]  densities with access to towns.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.840]  The opportunity to work with civilians to gain their trust and understanding of the
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:22.840]  issues.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:28.000]  They want to adapt an unfamiliar terrain, social and economic conditions.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.480]  Operations will happen in and around communities where anything out of the ordinary will be
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.440]  spotted and reported.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.520]  Complete and total sigh up through and through all the way.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.640]  And they legalized sigh ups last year.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:40.920]  They admit they're going to have brigade homeland rolling out.
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:46.040]  I did that report where they, the headline was Pentagon admits drudge stopping their
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.720]  propaganda in that video announcement.
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.680]  They admit they're going to be engaging in sigh up and military takeover domestically.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:56.920]  This is in preparation for the financial collapse and maybe even Obama not leaving
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.920]  office.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.920]  I mean, I'm telling you, this is so huge.
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:03.320]  There will be 1200 service members participating in Operation Jade Helm.
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:09.200]  It says increase military presence, increase aircraft in the area at night.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.520]  They may receive noise complaints.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:15.880]  Some individuals may conduct suspicious activities designed to prepare them for complex environments
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:16.880]  overseas.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:17.880]  Did you hear that?
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.720]  They're going to practice breaking into things and stuff.
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.600]  This is going to be hellish personnel.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.600]  Maybe carrying weapons.
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:26.960]  Some participants will be wearing civilian attire and driving civilian vehicles.
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:29.560]  And this is just a cover for deploying the military on the streets.
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:33.920]  You notice Texas is listed as hostile there for their drill.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:34.920]  Yeah.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:38.520]  So I think it's a good thing that we get out there and cover this all.
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:39.520]  We're going to be all over it.
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.520]  Yeah.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:42.840]  Because part of it in the document is out at Camp Swift.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:46.680]  They're in Smithville and other areas, but we have the Army sources and the Texas Guard
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:47.680]  sources.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.680]  We're going to be all over this.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.560]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.760]  I was told about this stuff going on at Fort Hood a few years ago.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.360]  That's what really upset the Psyops people out there.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:58.560]  Well, I mean, the thing for me, though, is just the amount of the participants.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:01.440]  I mean, this is the entire Special Operations Command.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.280]  This isn't just an invasion.
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:04.440]  This isn't just Delta Force.
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.440]  I mean, this is everybody.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:06.440]  And this isn't tabletop.
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:10.280]  I've hardly ever heard of something joint like this unless they're actually planning
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.280]  an invasion.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:14.120]  Yeah, this is a large, large operation on a big scale.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.840]  I mean, this is going to affect a lot of stuff.
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.880]  And like you said, the whole point is, is they want to, if Putin was putting this, one
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:24.200]  half of this on the Ukrainian border, the international news, instead of putting it
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:28.520]  on our border, Joe, I want you to do a detailed report.
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.440]  I mean, this is sensational.
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:32.880]  They hope it just, you know, comes out there like it's no big deal.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:41.000]  The headline is Northcom prepares all military forces or all branches to invade Texas.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.040]  It's listed as hostile enemy by Northcom and Special Forces Command.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.760]  They prepare invasion drill of Texas.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:49.480]  If that's preparing to invade Texas, we'll be back to stay with us.
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.800]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.280]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:57.000]  Ties into the TSA blockade.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.480]  Do you guys remember that, Joe?
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:05.040]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.480]  enhance overall health.

[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:46.080]  powerful and most challenging to acquire.

[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:06.640]  the water.
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:09.040]  Ohio Governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:14.720]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.040]  single day?

[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.920]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:32.840]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.160]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.

[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:20.400]  get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible, Prime Directive, discredit
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:21.400]  Alex Jones.
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.960]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:27.240]  It's a popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:29.440]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin Jail.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:31.440]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.440]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.440]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:39.960]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:49.960]  Imperatives destroy Britain's planet TV.
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.120]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy.
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:54.120]  Worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:55.120]  Get electro-ly.
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:33:24.920]  It's for God you can fail it.
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:38.480]  General's gathered in their masses, just like witches at black masses, evil minds that
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:49.280]  plot destruction, sorcerers of death construction, in the fields the body's burning, in the fields
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:57.440]  the body's burning, as the war machine, as the war machine keeps turning, death and hatred
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:09.680]  to mankind, death and hatred to mankind, poisoning, poisoning their brainwashed minds, I think
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:14.680]  the bass player that wrote this knew what he was talking about.
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:16.160]  Poisoning their brainwashed minds.
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:23.560]  VR being poisoned by psychological, spiritual, chemical, biological and positronic attacks.
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:24.560]  It's all admitted.
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:25.840]  It's all hidden in plain view.
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:27.760]  It's all admitted your TV is watching you.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:32.280]  It's all admitted that it won't be like Maxim Overdrive or Robo Apocalypse where the machines
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.280]  come after us.
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:39.400]  The machines are wired into the globalist hubs to dominate and control us.
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:42.200]  I want to go to Rick, Bailey, Mike, Max, John and others.
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:47.680]  I would have gone to you earlier, but we had breaking news.
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.240]  It says that it's a sigh-up in the document that Joe Beggs was just covering.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:56.200]  It just gets crazier by the minute.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:59.720]  The military's training all over the country for gun confiscation, for coordinating U.S.
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:00.720]  cities.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:02.280]  Of course, they can argue it's for overseas as well.
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:03.760]  This is all to condition us.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:07.120]  They have giant military training bases at Forthood, right up the road.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.880]  They have huge facilities everywhere.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:13.240]  This is about preparing the public, and it says in the document, preparing the public
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.640]  to work with us and be around us.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:20.680]  This is for the Red Dawn occupation, but most importantly, it's to get the military used
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:21.680]  to it.
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:26.960]  Well, let me give U.S. Army Special Operations Command little newsflash if you don't already
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:28.240]  know it.
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.320]  We told everybody this was coming 20 years ago when it was already going on a very small
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:35.480]  scale preparing cadres.
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.360]  That's how cancer grows, very small.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:41.760]  Now it's ready to give birth, nine months pregnant, and we're not flat-footed.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.960]  We know you're coming in.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:45.960]  And so bring it.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:46.960]  Bring your conditioning.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:47.960]  Put troops on the streets.
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.520]  Put your TSA on the streets.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.120]  Tell us the TVs are watching us.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.620]  Put cameras in the cars.
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:56.120]  Just go ahead, show everybody.
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:59.360]  Go ahead and take the vaccine inserts out so we can't show them folks.
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:00.360]  Go ahead.
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.360]  Go ahead.
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.360]  Go ahead.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:06.560]  The veterans know that their uncles and fathers and brothers and sisters have got out of the
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:09.440]  military and are put on do-not-treat list.
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:11.760]  They know they're getting treated like crap.
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:14.320]  They know they're planning to be replaced with machines soon.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.320]  Go ahead.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.320]  Push it all.
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.320]  I want to hit this next group of stories.
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:21.160]  We're going to want to ride back to your calls, but this is who runs the show that we're
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:23.160]  about to cover.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:28.120]  These stories all tie together.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:32.000]  Fed opens door wider for rate hike, but downgrades economic outlook.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  Let's stop right there.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:39.120]  They're giving themselves trillions of QE to the private banks at 0% or lower.
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:42.840]  The general public doesn't get cheap credit because they don't want to cause inflation,
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.080]  plus they want to screw everybody over.
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:47.520]  Because if you're going to do this dollar devaluation, might as well let people run
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:49.040]  the economy and build something up to do it.
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:50.720]  At least you get something out of that.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:51.720]  Not hyper-stag inflation.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.560]  They're trying to cook up.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:56.000]  It's totally unnatural.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.720]  Swedish central bank cuts key rate further below zero.
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.680]  The U.S. globalist system doing this has the world racing the lower interest rates.
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:08.960]  Swedish central bank took its key interest rate further into negative territory Wednesday.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:12.600]  They make you pay to put money in the bank in a surprised move aimed at supporting a
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:17.160]  return to inflation because there's a global depression.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:22.040]  That ties into the big kahuna here from Max Slavo up on infowars.com.
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:27.720]  From the you know what hit the plan site, bailout is back.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:32.880]  Me and Freddie likely need additional treasury investment after derivatives losses.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:33.880]  Derivatives are bigger now.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:34.880]  Look at the graphs.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.800]  We're going to go to some of those.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.480]  Then they were in 2008 now.
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:42.760]  Got to love that reform.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:48.080]  There is trouble again for federal mortgage backers and bailout queens Fannie Mae and
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:49.080]  Freddie Mae.
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:53.000]  Yeah, just six months ago they wouldn't give people jumbo loans.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.360]  Now they're giving the jumbo loans.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:59.800]  They're giving the small loans out to jumbos above 400, 500,000 depending on how they rate
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:00.800]  it.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.480]  And they're starting to let that money flow out there a little bit because it's derivatives.
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:08.360]  They're selling the houses 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 times over to different chump groups that
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:09.360]  buy them.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:12.840]  Mainly they're investing your pension funds in them so they can steal them later.
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.280]  In the name of protecting them.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.880]  We know the exact battle plan because we've seen them shake and bake it in other places.
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:23.240]  Just like we've seen them do their military drills all over the world where incorporation
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:27.160]  wrote handbooks on it in the 50s, how to train folks for military occupation.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:31.000]  We've played Army Psyop drill footage declassified in the 80s here.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:35.960]  In fact, when Joe Biggs cuts that report, guys, pull up the clips we never had in the
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:41.480]  Obama deception too, the Army internal Psyop brainwashing films on how to occupy a country.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:47.440]  I want to show clips of that during Joe Biggs' piece on this, on the military conditioning
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:52.320]  operations where Texas is listed as hostile, one of only a few states in the U.S. and we'll
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:56.120]  show the other ones that they're listing as why they got to run this Psyop.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:01.400]  And yeah, we're hostile to having our five-year-olds taught how to be trannies and we're hostile
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:03.400]  to having our borders wide open, having to pay for it all.
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:06.640]  We're hostile to turning our guns in, we're hostile to having our farms taken, we're hostile
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.040]  to being treated like slaves.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:13.520]  And you notice it's Texas, not perfect, but Texas, the spirit of Texas, Texas is doing
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:17.480]  more fighting than all the other states combined right now.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:21.720]  And just, Ron Paul comes out of Texas, I'm here, you just notice the spirit's here.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:23.880]  Don't start states here and we're not ever giving up.
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:28.080]  And so you can bring all your Navy SEALs and all your Delta Force here you want.
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:31.080]  You think they're going to buy the Psyop, the fighting American people, they're, oh
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:35.840]  I know, I know, you'll use Delta Force units and we know they're involved in dirty work.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:39.400]  To stage the false flags, you really think that's going to float?
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:46.080]  You really think the Navy SEALs refused to do a false flag for Dick Cheney in 2007?
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.920]  That was put out by Psy Hirsch in New Yorker Magazine.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:53.240]  Do you think, if they wouldn't do a false flag to blame the Iranians, do you think they're
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:55.080]  not going to leak it all to us?
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:58.480]  I always have a dinner with William Benny, the former head, director of operations for
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:01.440]  the National Security Agency last night for two hours.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:05.280]  And he was telling me how when they tried to, the feds tried to create fake documents
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.840]  that he was leaking secret data, that the Justice Department leaked to him how they'd
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:12.960]  faked it by people inside risking their lives.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:19.320]  The more you squeeze, the more we're going to wake up and resist.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:25.120]  Go ahead, blow up a truck and say, I did it.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:29.200]  Everybody knows it's not true and I'm done with you people.
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.480]  You want to play chicken?
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.480]  You want to go head on?
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:32.480]  Let's do it.
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:36.800]  It'll be just like the Alamo all over it again.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:40.560]  Strike us down, we become more powerful than you can possibly imagine and the other Star
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:43.920]  Wars analogy you want.
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:50.040]  You just don't mind control everybody, globalist, you got that?
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:53.880]  You want to make things so ugly that the average person gets scared deep down and turns inside
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:54.880]  and gives up.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.160]  Well, we're not giving up.
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:00.840]  And the thing about the spirit of liberty is it's infectious scum.
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:01.840]  Let's go back to the article.
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.960]  So now here's the one I want to get to.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:08.720]  As they sign us on to two point, it's now two point plus quadrillion.
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:09.720]  It's over.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:10.720]  256 years ago.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.640]  Then it was to the Wall Street Journal and it's two point three.
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:16.160]  They're saying you're higher quadrillion.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:23.120]  That's two thousand three hundred trillion dollars.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:27.240]  That's fitting on the numbers 20, 30, 40 times more than all the wealth of the world that
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:33.480]  these bankers created as a black hole to sign all of us on to that we don't owe.
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:36.280]  Why would anyone want to do this to prosperity?
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.880]  Why would anyone want to screw everything over?
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:42.800]  Why would anyone want to feed kids McDonald's food that on record sterilizes rats and then
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:45.680]  put images of dead babies out front?
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:52.800]  It's a freak show, man, and I'm not a freak.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:56.720]  The Pentagon has Texas listed as its enemy.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:00.880]  And I want to add to Joe's report Forbes and others about Pentagon trains to take on the
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:01.880]  Tea Party.
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:02.880]  This is it, folks.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:07.240]  I don't know if it'll be next month or five years from now, but I'm telling you they're
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:11.480]  going to detonate a nuke in a major city and blame it on patriots and have HD video of
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:15.320]  patriots taking responsibility for it.
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:22.400]  HD video is phony as all the rest of the phony CG stuff you see.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:24.120]  John Wayne's back doing commercials.
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:25.120]  No folks.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.520]  John Wayne died 30 something years ago.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:29.000]  Elvis is back making commercials.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  No man.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  He's dead.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.840]  You understand that?
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:38.360]  Dead dog Ben Richards didn't butcher the women in Bakersfield.
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:39.360]  It ain't real.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.360]  You got it?
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.240]  Now, let's go over this.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:49.120]  10 charts which show we are much worse off than just before the last economic crisis.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.120]  Articles on infowars.com.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:55.120]  If you believe that ignorance is bliss, you might not want to read this article.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.880]  And then it goes into all of it.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:58.880]  The national debt.
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:04.800]  And here we have from the federal government the numbers U.S. Department of the Treasury
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.800]  or FREDS, the website.
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:13.200]  And we see from 1970 to now an exponential growth curve in the national debt.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:16.200]  When Obama came in it was 9 trillion.
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.960]  Now it's almost 19 trillion.
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:19.400]  Let's look at number two.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.400]  Total debt.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.400]  Not just national debt.
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:31.960]  Let's look at that graph, exponential hyperbolic numbers on that front, 60 trillion dollars
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:33.600]  in global debt.
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:37.640]  Not counting derivatives, 2.3 quadrille.
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:39.120]  You did hear me say 2.3 quadrille.
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:47.680]  It's hard to say 2.3 quadrille, but it is harder to even say 2,300 trillion only in
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:49.440]  the New World Order.
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:53.360]  Only in America do you have planet fitness with guys in pink outfits saying don't grunt
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.360]  with alarms on the walls when you grunt and they run over and yell at you.
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:02.440]  And Starbucks saying don't, oh, you're white, you're evil, give me a break.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.440]  Number three.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:04.440]  The velocity of money.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:08.240]  When an economy is healthy, money tends to change hands and circulate through the system
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:09.240]  quite rapidly.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:12.640]  So it makes sense that the velocity of money fell dramatically during the last recession.
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:14.720]  But why has it kept going down since?
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:18.080]  Because they're giving themselves free money at the high level to buy everything up while
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:23.680]  cutting it off to us, the hyper-stag rape inflation, the term I coined.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:28.600]  The homeowner rate, oh, as they did the plan of the Democrats to have a chicken or a pot,
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:35.120]  a house in a pot, home ownership has plunged since 2000 to an absolute record low.
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:40.440]  Look at that graph, right there, massive plunge, isn't it loving?
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.440]  Number five.
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:44.560]  The employment rate all time low.
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:49.680]  It did a dead count bounce under Obamacare in the last two years because tens of millions
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:53.400]  of people had to get a second or third job and that was counted as another person employed.
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:56.080]  But there's that graph right there.
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.080]  Number six.
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:01.560]  The labor force participation rate, oh, look at that plunging, 100 plus million people
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:06.120]  on welfare, hundreds of millions not wearing, just a total joke, more illegals pouring in,
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:07.640]  faster than you can shake a stick at it.
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:08.640]  Number seven.
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:14.480]  The inactivity rate for men in their private working years, absolutely exploding right there
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:20.560]  real median household income, let's look at that, plunging massively since 2000 from the
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:21.560]  Fed's own website.
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:26.000]  Oh, here we go, let's look at the number nine now, not trying to be negative here, just
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.160]  telling you the fact, inflation up despite the factors of depression and the real economy.
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:38.840]  And number 10, government dependence, absolutely skyrocketing in the last 30 years to ultra-massive
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.840]  levels.
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:40.840]  Is this an economic recovery?
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:44.400]  Well, yes, two plus two equals five, raising the debt limit, doesn't raise the debt limit.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:47.600]  Maybe you have a business you didn't build that, and dead babies with pus dripping out
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:52.080]  of their eyeballs, and skulls and satanic symbols outside McDonald's in Austin.
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:57.640]  Everything's wonderful, everything is awesome, and see Alex Jones is the crazy man.
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:04.040]  Because I met with the Houston, I'm not going to get into that, I met with the San Antonio
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:08.600]  police chief, the Kingsville police, all of them, I made films about it.
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:14.840]  I met with the former director of operations, the national security agency, last night.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:21.320]  But long before I met with those people, I was told all of this, all of this by military
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:27.280]  veterans and people who'd worked in the CIA and retired FBI agents and current federal
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:29.840]  marshals when I was like 17, 18 years old.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:36.680]  I was told this stuff by FBI agents and people when I was 10 years old in Dallas, Texas,
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:38.040]  all of it.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:43.280]  And American patriots have held this back this long, and now it doesn't matter, the

[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:29.920]  forces we're fighting.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:34.760]  You got 110% commitment on us, and all I ask is you pray for us, spread the word about

[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.720]  I wouldn't push something, I don't 100% believe it, 100%!
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:55.720]  You understand that?
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:59.200]  And we are facing pure evil here, and that's why I get so upset, because I got to deal
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.800]  with these people every day, I got to deal with reality every day, I got to deal with
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:06.680]  knowing what's coming here.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:11.240]  A world without humans, a world of abortion, a world of scum.
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:17.080]  All right, let's go to Rick in Illinois, you're on the air, Rick, go ahead.
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:19.000]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  Good, buddy, welcome.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.200]  Hi, first of all, I want to thank you for everything that you do.
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:27.120]  You're an inspiration to me a few years ago when I created my website, conspiracynews.com.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:31.360]  Awesome, beautiful news site, name, go ahead, brother.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:37.280]  You and I were actually featured together in an article, USNewsandtime.com online a couple
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:42.280]  years back with the Hurricane Sandy, the engineer storm of the century.
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:45.640]  Well, they admit they can engineer them, and a lot of experts said that.
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:48.880]  Right, well, I wanted to talk to you about a couple things today, actually, I was going
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:53.520]  to get into the gun control thing with the ammunition, but in light of this new article
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.920]  that you just revealed from Special Forces Command.
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:04.280]  I want to bring you back to July 22, 2012, where the, this is from the Associated Press,
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:08.240]  the Marine Corps is the first global law enforcement battalions.
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:09.240]  Yes.
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:16.520]  And then there was an article put out, let's see here, July 25, 2012, full spectrum operations
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:19.960]  in the Homeland Division of the Future, the Department of Defense came out.
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:23.560]  That's right, it's all been announced, it's just that now they have Texas listed as a
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.160]  hostile enemy.
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:31.200]  The feds list Texas as the enemy and prepare a full invasion force training drill.
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:33.840]  My God, the treason's getting insane.
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:39.200]  April 12, 2013, there was a Federal Register of Volume 78, number 71, where the DOD came
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:45.680]  out, Department of Defense, Office of the Secretary, 32 CFR Port 182, and it was entitled
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.680]  to...
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:50.360]  Next day there, I love a caller like this, he's just listing all the real official documents
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:54.080]  where they're training to take our guns and put us in forced labor camps.
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.840]  All they said, the military is their main enemy.
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:58.560]  When they're done with the military, they're gonna put them in their weathers, I mean this
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:50:59.560]  is unbelievable.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:05.080]  This hour, brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com, when it hits the fan, don't be left without
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:10.080]  the body armor that will save your life, with prices starting at just $374.99 and ships

[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.360]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:25.960]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:26.960]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:34.960]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:38.560]  Good thing we have the Berkey system, it's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:42.400]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaks
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:44.400]  only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:45.400]  I know, right?
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:46.400]  You love it too!
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:47.900]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:49.200]  Let's go get some.
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:59.480]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653, that's 877-886-3653 or visit goberkey.com.
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:03.080]  Why use dilup when you can use broadband?
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:05.200]  Why travel with this?
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:07.040]  When you can use this?
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:13.520]  And why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when you can use supernatural silver?
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:16.960]  Supernatural silver is state-of-the-art and it's been clinically proven to be several
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:20.280]  hundred times more effective than those other silvers.
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:24.960]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:25.960]  and fungus.
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:30.960]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically and you'll never again deal
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:34.840]  with the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics.
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:39.320]  Hundreds of scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals and research institutions
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:45.760]  have all shown supernatural silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against invading pathogens.
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:48.320]  Supernatural silver is a must-have for your arsenal.

[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:04.040]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood and prevention of disease.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:07.720]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:08.720]  in a toxic colon.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:12.920]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease and
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:16.440]  a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:19.080]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:23.040]  I've taken whey protein products for years and I've never noticed results I have with
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:24.040]  your product.
[01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:27.040]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:31.360]  Within a few days of taking one world away, I noticed a dramatic change.
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:34.960]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:38.480]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:42.120]  But I've noticed in the past week or so I'm not feeling bad anymore and the foot pain
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:43.120]  is gone.
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:46.640]  I'm just finishing up the five pound top I ordered and just got off the phone ordering
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:47.640]  more.
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:48.640]  I love your product.
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:49.640]  Thank you.
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:50.640]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:55.840]  That's 888-988-3325 or visit 1worldway.com.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:56.840]  That's 1world.
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:57.840]  W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:06.840]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central.
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:11.600]  You know, I'm sorry and I'm not really sorry, but I am sorry in a way that I get upset when
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:15.480]  I'm looking at official Pentagon documents that are on their website where they say
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:17.960]  we're preparing to acclimate the public and it's a Psyop.
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:23.320]  It actually says that and it shows Texas' hostile and there's three other states listed
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:24.320]  as enemies.
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:26.320]  And of course, it's all Patriot states.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:30.280]  In fact, as you bring the document back in so I can list those states for people, then
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:35.080]  the caller calls in and he's just listing all the Pentagon admissions, the National Stabilization
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:41.680]  Police Force, the Pentagon preparations, Army Times, Stars and Stripes, North Comm announcements
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:46.120]  and then you learn the training is house-to-house gun confiscations.
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:50.400]  I mean, my God, how are they going to, how do you think they're going to try to trigger
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:53.840]  this, Rick, from conspiracynews.com, right?
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:54.840]  That's your sign.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:58.760]  How do you think that they would trigger it with a false flag, an economic collapse,
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:00.480]  but they got to demonize the Patriots.
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:02.120]  That's what they trained to fight.
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:04.460]  That's woken the military up, though.
[01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:08.280]  How does the establishment think the military is actually, A, going to do something traitorous
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:14.400]  but, B, go up against American gun owners if 1% fight back, you're talking about something
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:21.440]  like 101.5 million serious combatants, most of them veterans and they know the veterans
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.440]  are going to fight back.
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:23.680]  That's why they're being tracked and listed.
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:27.400]  They're trying to deny the veterans health care to get them off the rolls, kill them.
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:28.680]  I don't see this floating.
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:33.080]  I don't see this dog hunting, Rick, unless they totally want to destroy the U.S. by the
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:39.160]  Civil War, and that's the plan, which it actually is, with George Soros funding, rioting against
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:40.160]  the police.
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:41.160]  What do you say, Rick?
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:47.240]  First of all, it's conspiracynews.com, and yeah, I don't know how they're going to do
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:48.240]  it, honestly.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:53.120]  We're being bombarded every day by multiple crises, and every day it's something different.
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:59.160]  You could look at a false flag nuke with Russia, or with Russia to preoccupy the population.
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:01.640]  You've got the racial tensions in Ferguson, other places.
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:05.120]  You've got the police killings, and the citizens going up against the police.
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:08.560]  There's a many wars starting on the streets now with that.
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:14.920]  I can remember back December 5th, 2012, or actually, I'm sorry, it was August 10th, 2012.
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:15.920]  You had a guest.
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:16.920]  She's a friend of mine on Facebook.
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:17.920]  Susan Apostle.
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:18.920]  Proposal.
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:19.920]  Susan Apostle.
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:24.840]  She wrote an article, you guys posted on your website, U.S. Army Tactical Manual describes
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:26.640]  how to control domestic insurrection.
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:27.640]  Absolutely.
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:31.560]  We've covered that for many years, and if you go over these different reports I've
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:32.560]  appreciate your call.
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:34.520]  Good to hear from you.
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:39.560]  You understand that they're moving forward with this plan.
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:46.800]  And when you look at the military involved domestically, again, they're planning to target
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.320]  the liberty movement in this country.
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:53.560]  They'll only get away with that by pulling off some false flag.
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:57.200]  And if you look at how the communists took over in 1917, it took them two or three years
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:00.920]  to take over the whole country in Russia, all they see was Moscow.
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:03.960]  And they got the military to come turn themselves into them, and they killed tens of thousands
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:06.120]  of the officers.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:10.320]  And they ordered the public to turn in their guns, people that were able to own weapons.
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:19.240]  So it's a gamble, but they could take the country over if the military follows the orders.
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:21.000]  It's a very frightening prospect.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Let's go to John in Texas.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.920]  John, you're on the air.
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:25.920]  Welcome.
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:26.920]  Hi, Alex.
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:30.880]  You know, Vladimir Putin was truly a nationalist, a Christian, and he was truly against the
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:31.880]  new old order.
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:37.880]  He'd release all the Soviet era's secret police documents about our POWs from World War II
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:41.720]  and Korea that disappeared into the zoologues and their government that left a finger to
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:42.720]  help them out.
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:47.880]  But what really happened, they're learning McDonnell about the murder of Patton, about
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:49.880]  what really happened on 9-1-1.
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:50.880]  I agree.
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:53.880]  Pulled that whole cabal up abortion and right out of the water.
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:54.880]  I agree.
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:56.880]  Vladimir Putin is just another criminal syndicate.
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:01.880]  I don't think, until he does this, I can't believe that, that he's truly a Christian.
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:02.880]  He changed Russia.
[01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:06.880]  If he don't do that, then he's just part of the whole game plan.
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:11.360]  Well, I mean, there's the Chinese crime block, the Russian crime block, and the Anglo-American
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:12.360]  crime block.
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.480]  They're all battling over Latin America, African areas of Asia, and the Middle East.
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:21.420]  The globalist crime block is a transhumanist eugenicist group who is clearly the most
[01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:24.880]  virulent and has got their act together the best and is the main threat.
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:27.360]  And might as well be the Borg.
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:33.360]  The other groups, the Chinese Crown Access has got a back room deal with the corporate
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:36.480]  Borg, and so that's really the battle space.
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:40.880]  We'll be back with Max and others' calls.
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:44.880]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:49.880]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:55.120]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:59.800]  the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:04.640]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy-powder, available through
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:09.800]  Infowars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:14.880]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:20.000]  ingredients, often times full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:25.200]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:29.600]  Oxy-powder does not require time off work, and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:36.000]  Instead, oxy-powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.720]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:49.600]  Go to infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com to get started with oxy-powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:18.080]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network,
[02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:22.720]  and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:31.840]  It's so fantastical, so bizarre, so over-the-top, but so actually common historically, but it feels
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:37.840]  fantastic. It feels epic to see a scientific, incremental takeover of society, waging war
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:43.520]  against decency, against values, against security, against family, against God,
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:47.760]  against private property, against goodness.
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:56.320]  But that's what's going on, and I just don't see how the globalists think they're going to get away
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:02.960]  with this civil war they're trying to set up. Got false flag written all over the toe to demonize
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:08.240]  the opposition. Max in California, you're on the air. Go ahead. Then we'll go to Julie and others.
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:15.200]  Hello, Alex. Yes, sir. Come on on there. All right, good. You sure are. Welcome.
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:24.720]  Yes, I have two words. Get bomb. It is defined in Barron's financial and investment terms.
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:30.080]  It's been there since the 60s. It's not a mistake. It's a architectural
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:36.880]  demolition term in the financial world, and it's being perpetrated completely
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:42.560]  on purpose. Yeah, that's how the globalists control the third world. They get them into
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:46.800]  debt systems that are basically impossible to pay back, and because we were so wealthy,
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:50.400]  they sign us on the derivatives that aren't even ours, but when we sign on to, quote,
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:54.640]  prop up the banks, it now becomes our debt, and that is the debt bomb to bring us down.
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:02:03.200]  Right. I know that's what it is, finding the clause that signed us on to that quadrillion
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:07.520]  that you keep mentioning. How come that's not front page every day?
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:12.240]  Because it's not front page that the border is wide open and that they're training the
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:17.280]  military to confiscate our firearms during total collapse. But it's all going on. It's
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:22.080]  not front page news that all 10 charts from the federal government's own website show the economy
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:29.600]  in free fall. So what do you think is going to happen first, the financial attacker or buyer or
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:36.640]  like what? And I'm going to do this aggravation. Well, you notice, I mean, it's good to be
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:41.200]  aggravated. That's normal because aggravation is so you figure out a solution. We know they're
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:45.280]  playing. Their number one enemy is preppers. They say that in veterans. It's anybody that
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:49.440]  can stand up for themselves and self-sufficient. They want to collapse to make you shine on,
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:54.000]  to get a national ID card, to go through their systems, to live in a government warehouse,
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:03:01.520]  basically, a major reeducation of society under a collapse. And they're worried about holdouts,
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:05.760]  like in Katrina that were high and dry, that have their own power and their own guns. That's
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.880]  who's going to be targeted. And then everybody's targeted after that. So it's a very diabolical
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:15.040]  plan. Max, good to hear from you. Great point. Julie in Texas, you're on the year. Go ahead.
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:22.560]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Thank you. I'm calling. I'm calling to alert Texas residents
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:27.440]  about a sinister piece of legislation that's pending in the U.S. or not U.S. in the Texas
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:35.040]  Senate. What's the one to ban people from shooting video police? It's the one that would give the
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:40.400]  state broad police towers to force anyone suspected of being exposed or being a carrier
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:45.600]  of an infectious disease to detainment and treatment, including vaccination without their consent.
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:52.160]  It gives the governor and the Department of Health the power by executive order to declare a
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:58.240]  state of infectious disease emergency, which can last for 30 days and be extended at their discretion.
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:01.440]  That's right. I read about that Dr. County and Bill that, of course, won't be applied to the
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:14.160]  illegals, so it's all fake. What's the bill number? 538. So it would be great if everybody in Texas
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:20.160]  would call their legislator and the nine members of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:25.680]  that have sponsored this bill and are preparing to get it out of committee because this is like
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:31.040]  set for abuse right here. Well, of course, and I leave the borders wide open and then
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:35.760]  bring in the Ebola patients, but then say in Texas we'll forcibly inoculate whoever we want.
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:40.480]  They use the crisis they help create to bring in the tyranny. Absolutely. And there's the bill,
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:47.360]  SB 538, the 2015, 2016, 84th legislative session. Thank you so much, Julie. Great job. We need to
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:53.040]  get on this and we will cover this more because it's another forced inoculation bill. That's
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:58.240]  exactly what that is. Stay with us. We'll be right back to talk about medical tyranny and more.
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:03.200]  Hey, how are you doing? Good, brother. Just recently start using your products,
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:07.280]  everything you said about them is correct. Me and my wife both use a lot of them and
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:10.640]  that's made a lot of changes in our lives here. Well, thank you, brother. It's because it also
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:14.320]  funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality. Super

[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:31.040]  energy. We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:37.680]  there. Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:43.120]  or maximum potency. They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff. Just cover that
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:47.440]  up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:53.440]  naturally going goes right to the source. So it's pretty exciting and I love it. Visit infowarslife.com

[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:29.680]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:33.760]  We just talked to a caller about a forced inoculation bill in Texas legislature that's
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:38.560]  moving out of committee. We've seen two of these bills around the nation shot down. The point is
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:43.200]  they're going for them while leaving the borders wide open and bringing Ebola patients into the
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:49.600]  country. We have tuberculosis affecting 27 at Kansas City Area High School, but nobody cares
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:53.360]  about that. They'd rather freak out about stuff that doesn't kill you like the measles and say,
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:58.480]  oh, the unvaccinated are causing it. There's an excellent film that we've been selling for
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:03.360]  several years at infowarsstore.com, one of hundreds of great films we have listed there,
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:09.680]  titled Doctored. The film, the American Medical Association, is on I want you to see. The Los
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:17.360]  Angeles Times said an involving, well-crafted, humane look at the topic that stands to affect us all.
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:23.440]  If you want to expose what big pharma is and what big medicine is, not even so much the doctors,
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:30.400]  but the system and Obamacare and all of it and where that's going, you need to see this film.
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:36.240]  Your food, your medicine, your healthcare has all been doctored, a Jeff Hayes film.
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:42.080]  And Jeff Hayes joins us. Your calls are coming up after the break. He'll be with us about 40
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:48.320]  minutes. Then we'll take calls and hit some final news. Your back pain will require surgery. Without
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:52.720]  these pills, you face long pain. Your child's behavior requires medication. These are the
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:57.760]  questions. This gives any parent or any person the answers they need to counter the fraud.
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:01.120]  So even though our listeners are more informed than the average person, more informed than I
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:05.280]  am on many subjects, this is a film you need to donate to the library. This is a film you
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:12.560]  need to show your PTA, your church. It's available at infoarstore.com. So your purchase supports the
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:17.120]  filmmaker, this radio, TV broadcast and you getting the intel you need. But we're not here to push this
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:21.200]  all day on people. But here's an example of what we're getting at and what the film gets at.
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:25.760]  Extremely professionally produced. He's an award-winning filmmaker. Been in the short list for an academy
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:36.080]  award. Breastfeeding pays babies who nursed earned more as adults. Study says L.A. times 39% more.
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:39.120]  It's funny because the brains on average of children that breastfeed
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:46.240]  weigh more, about 30% more. So you earn more and your brain's bigger. Wow, it actually fills up
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:53.280]  your skull cavity. And if you look at what's in the average formula, it's high fructose corn syrup.
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:58.400]  It's full of toxins. In fact, pull up the Washington Post headline. 90% is the headline.
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:06.880]  Another headline's half. But I'll just type in corn syrup mercury or corn syrup lead.
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:12.720]  See, it's what they're, the fertilizer, the corn, these toxic fertilizer, it's insane people.
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:18.400]  And then this is a larger program. But this article says it pays to breastfeed for babies
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:23.840]  when they grow up. The steady diet of breast milk may boost their monthly income. 39% according to
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:28.080]  new report. Researchers tracked down 3,500 Brazilian adults who enrolled in the study
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:33.600]  with the days of their birth, 1982, back to the 80s. Interviewers had asked the mothers how long
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:37.680]  their children were breastfed and how long they were when they were introduced through foods.
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:43.280]  And it just goes through the fact that they were much higher IQs. And it goes into many studies
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:48.240]  have found a correlation between breastfeeding and IQs. Yeah, and brain size and intelligence test.
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:51.360]  And it goes through a bunch of other studies here in the US and other countries. So
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:56.720]  I've always talked about this and we've had a mainstream establishment liberal publications
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:03.120]  make fun of me. Jones is bashing women who don't breastfeed. Yeah, I kind of am. I mean,
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:06.880]  I don't want to be flipping here, but you might as well just abort the baby. You're already
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:11.600]  aborting the brain. And I don't mean really go abort your baby. But I mean, it's pretty close.
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:16.480]  And if you weren't breastfed, I'm not knocking you. But if you're you're already smart, man,
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:23.600]  you'd have been up there in lights, your IQ. Let me give you a newsflash. Your women have
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:30.480]  breast and the entire mammal species, whether it's a blue whale, or a elephant, or a gazelle,
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:38.640]  or a beaver, or a woman, or the milk is for the baby. I know nowadays they say that milk comes
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:43.120]  from the school lunch program. And the only mama that gives milk is our great mother goddess,
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:50.080]  Michelle Obama, the great, great Kali. But it is. And I know that sounds wild to folks that have
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:53.520]  been told two plus two equals five and raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit. And
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:57.600]  although I'm not being sarcastic here, one day will be a conspiracy that women ever had milk,
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:01.200]  or they ever had babies, half the babies are cesarean now because they make more money.
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:05.360]  And the doctor can run off to what they're doing. So we need to put pressure on this.
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:09.680]  Like we've done the GMO crowd, everybody else to change it. The film is doctored,
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:12.640]  and he's made a lot of other great films as well. And we're going to have him back for a full hour
[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:18.400]  of the near future and on the nightly news as well. But Jeff Hayes, thank you so much,
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:22.720]  jeffhaysfilms.com for coming on with us. I kind of just introd with some of my
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:29.520]  current examples of that. And the FDA wants to stop listing drug interactions on the vaccines.
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:36.160]  I mean, this really is crazy what's going on. Tell us about your film and what drove you to
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:41.040]  make it and some of the things covered in the film. Well, the film that you're talking about,
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:50.400]  they're doctored, it really started in that film, you know, we talked briefly about vaccines,
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:56.960]  we talked briefly about GMOs. But prior to doing that film and meeting the people that
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:02.400]  we interviewed there, I had no clue that there would be any reason not to be vaccinated. I had no
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:11.600]  clue that GMOs were a risk to us. And so those two subjects, you know, as the film doctor,
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:19.200]  we really talk about alternative medicine and how traditional medicine has attacked it and kept it
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:28.560]  down. And really zeroing in on a case of chiropractors. Where in 1962, the AMA formed a committee
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:36.080]  to literally to dismantle the chiropractic profession. And so all through the 60s, you had
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:42.720]  these chiropractors, these wonderful people that kept running into obstacle after obstacle and
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:46.320]  they felt like they were conspiracy theorists. It's like, man, it seems like there's something
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:53.920]  against us. Finally, in 1974, five chiropractors sued the AMA. And the documents that came out in
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:15:00.160]  the course of that case, it took 13 years. But they were vindicated, they were right, the AMA was
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:08.960]  underhandedly, surreptitiously trying to dismantle the profession. In 1987, the AMA was found guilty
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:14.400]  of conspiring to contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession. So that really is just a
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:22.160]  microcosm of what's happened to all alternative therapy, anybody who doesn't really sell drugs.
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:31.120]  As we did that film, the subjects that we ran into about vaccines and GMOs, these were new topics
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:38.160]  to me. And they were radioactive. We had people even in the chiropractic profession who were like,
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:44.480]  you can't cover that in this film. And so we followed that with the film BOT, which... We're
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:48.800]  going to have you back about BOT. We're going to start carrying that as well. But we'll talk about
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:56.640]  BOT right now. But expanding on that, I never went to a chiropractor until I'd thrown my shoulder
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:02.720]  out about 10 years ago. And the police had done it, arresting me. So they said I had to have surgery.
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:07.280]  I went to a chiropractor, popped it right back in, never had another problem. Then I was firing a
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:14.800]  50 cal last year, handheld about 100 rounds, thought it was fine. My spine completely bent
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:19.360]  towards the left. I went to the medical doctor, they said surgery, went to a chiropractor,
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:25.280]  three sessions, totally fixed it, did the x-rays, everything was fine. All I know is I got results.
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:28.400]  But if they had their way, I would have had to have the surgery. Go ahead, sorry.
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:36.960]  This is what's astounding. If you go see a surgeon for a back problem, you're 42,
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:42.400]  you're 42 times more likely to have back surgery than if you go to a chiropractor.
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:49.920]  When you figure over half of all back surgeries fail, the number one cause of a second back
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:55.840]  surgery is a first back surgery. This is horrific. Finally, insurance companies are starting to
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:02.480]  stand up for this and we can't do this. We can't keep paying people. We're creating a nation of
[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:08.800]  drug addicts because of the pain that they endure after having back surgery and so many times this
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:16.000]  can be fixed quickly and simply by a chiropractor and yet surgery is considered conservative care
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  and going to see a chiropractor is considered radical. It blows my mind how we do this.
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:30.160]  Keep breaking it down. What do you mean? I mean, getting into your experiences of the film.
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:38.400]  I'll give you a perfect example. There's a chiropractor in Dallas, Texas named Francis Murphy.
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:47.600]  Francis discovered an adjustment that is really my closest thing to a miracle that I've ever seen.
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:54.880]  He's done it and filmed it 1500 times. People have frozen shoulders. It's a very common
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:18:02.000]  element where literally they can't lift their arm up higher than this and so there's a drug that's
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:07.200]  recently been approved for frozen shoulder. There's surgery that they do for frozen shoulder.
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:14.000]  Francis came up with an adjustment of the occipit but where your brain meets your skull that when
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:19.760]  he does this adjustment, suddenly people that couldn't raise their arm before can now raise
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:25.440]  their arm over their head and he never touches the shoulder, which is what's so bizarre about it,
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:32.880]  which it almost validates the entire chiropractic model in that doing an adjustment to someone's
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:38.400]  neck or occipit suddenly affects their shoulder without them ever touching the shoulder. He's
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:44.800]  done this and filmed it successfully over 1500 times so we filmed him and doctored. I felt horrible
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:49.200]  for the way he calls me. He says, hey, I've got a guy with a frozen shoulder and I'm like Francis,
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:55.600]  I'm sorry, I can't get there for a month and so we made this poor guy with a frozen shoulder,
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:19:01.760]  keep his frozen shoulder for another month so he could wait for us to film him and getting that
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:10.400]  released but what's gone on since then is he noticed lots of different health outcomes to the
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:15.120]  people that were suffering from this that once he did this adjustment so he started measuring
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:22.080]  heart rate variability. He started measuring all these different aspects of it. We brought him here
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:27.920]  to the University of Utah and had him sit with a professor at the University of Utah Medical School
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:35.520]  and they started looking for what could be the mechanism. We know this works and why does it
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:43.200]  work so Francis was thinking, well, I'm adjusting in this area here. We think it's the cranial nerve
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:50.400]  11. The vagus nerve actually shares that same conduit through that part of our anatomy and
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:55.440]  the vagus nerve controls your breathing, your parasympathetic system so all of a sudden this is
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:20:02.000]  why he was seeing so many behavioral changes. My sister is a professor and it has been a professor
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:08.400]  at a medical school for over 25 years. I brought her in and she's looking in and now they're doing
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:15.920]  research on this just finding out why this simple chiropractic adjustment is having such a profound
[02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:22.400]  effect on autism, on MS, on all these other things. Sure, well I didn't have that. I had a pinched nerve
[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:26.960]  and they were telling me that it was a torn rotator cuff. All I know is I went to the chiropractor
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:31.520]  and it was hurting so bad. I'd gone up to an event in Dallas and I just couldn't do it anymore so
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:35.360]  I just pulled over at a place, went in, they said, yeah, come back in two hours. They did it.
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:39.440]  It hurt real bad when it happened. I felt like electricity in my arm for about a day and then
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:44.480]  it was gone so whatever the chiropractor did fixed it and they just fixed me again. I mean,
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:47.920]  I ought to be kissing their feet. I'm not saying there aren't some quacks out there and that it's
[02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:53.200]  not, you know, a panacea. All I know is it's worked really well and that makes sense. You've got
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:58.320]  nerves coming out of your brain in the whole, the bottom of it in your skull and they go down
[02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:02.400]  through your spine and they get pinched. You're going to have problems and a chiropractor can
[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:06.640]  pop it and get it where it's not being squeezed anymore. I mean, I'm not a rocket scientist but
[02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:13.040]  that sounds like it's pretty simple. If you think about it, if we just start with the belief,
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:19.760]  let's do the most conservative thing first. It stuns me when I talk to people. The guy who
[02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:27.680]  lives in that, who built the house that I live in is 33 years old, has had three back surgeries
[02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:33.280]  and has addicted to painkillers and he did all that before he ever went to see a chiropractor.
[02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:39.360]  Good grief. Before you do something radical, go see a chiropractor and see if they can help you.
[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:46.320]  Go see several of them. Well, that's right. I have a friend who plays tennis and she
[02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:49.360]  had gotten the point where she stopped playing tennis. She plays it, you know,
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:54.160]  competitively in leagues and one of the best people in the city and she was going to stop and
[02:21:54.160 --> 02:21:57.920]  she'd been to medical doctors, she'd been everywhere and I said, listen, go to this chiropractor and
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:04.080]  get grassed in with a steel bar and I said, because it got my neck pain out. I started going
[02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:07.760]  to the chiropractor now because I had neck pain and it hurts like hell when they're doing it,
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:11.920]  but it knocked it out. She did about six, seven sessions. It's gone.
[02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:20.240]  Yeah. There's a basic philosophy of chiropractic and they talk about innate and basically,
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:26.800]  you know, if you take a baby and you slice its arm, that baby, its body already knows
[02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:33.120]  how to heal itself. We innately know how to heal and so if we can remove interference, if we can
[02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:41.520]  have the nutrients in our body that we need and are not taking in toxins that affect us,
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:47.920]  our body can heal itself over and over. This respect for the body is unfortunately absent
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:52.800]  in traditional medicine in most cases where we look at it and we say, okay, somebody's
[02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:58.320]  genetically broken. Somebody needs a medical intervention. Well, of course you're genetically
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:03.200]  broken. If you smoke two packs of cigarettes, you have a predistribution, predistribution,
[02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:07.760]  what's the word, predisposition after all that word to get lung cancer with your genetics,
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:11.760]  but it's because you were smoking cigarettes, not because you have bad genetics. Why are all
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:18.560]  these diseases going up? It's because of toxins in the environment, lack of exercise, GMO, vaccines,
[02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:25.520]  not because suddenly our genes are horrible. Yeah. We're going to see this more and more over
[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:32.800]  the next decade that the science is epigenetics, not genetics. It is your genes in the environment
[02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:38.160]  that we put them in, not your genes. Absolutely. Well, they've always known it's nature and nurture.
[02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:44.240]  Now they're trying to say it's just nature. That's not true even in mainline science. They're
[02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:48.960]  just lying to people and saying, you will get cancer early because you have the genes for it
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:56.160]  and these women are going and having their breasts removed. This is such a profound disrespect
[02:23:56.720 --> 02:24:04.560]  for our body and for the miracle that the trillions of things that are happening
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:10.000]  in our body every day and for us that just have the hubris to go, oh no, no, you have depression.
[02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:16.720]  It must be a deficiency of Prozac somehow. Doctors available at infowarstore.com. Everything's
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:22.080]  10% off today, rights of the weekend. I've decided to extend it and I've not seen bought yet,
[02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:25.840]  but I'm told it's very powerful and gets into the vaccines, the GMO and the rest of it.
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:29.520]  And of course, we know that the research is bought now. We know they're trying to shut
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:33.760]  things down as people turn against it. I see we're at a tipping point. A, do you agree with that?
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:41.280]  B, let's break down what's in your other film bought. So the reason for the title bought,
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:50.480]  I am a free enterprise nut. I believe that that's the solution for most of our economic
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:53.200]  problems and a lot of our social problems. I bet you like Ron Paul. That's horrible.
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:25:02.640]  So what's been so discouraging to me as I watch what happens when you mix money and healthcare,
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:07.440]  and I was talking to a friend about, I'm like, this is the almost a betrayal of capitalism. And
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:14.400]  he points out, this is not capitalism. It's crony, crony capitalism. And we really have been
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:22.480]  sold out. Well, crony is the phony. It not only destroys your culture, centralizes power with
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:28.080]  corrupt people that operate in games, but then it discredits capitalism. And then they advertise
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:32.560]  socialism as the way to get rid of it. But then you just get socialized, independent, and the
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:39.120]  globalist are above it is cronies. And now have you domesticated? Exactly, exactly what's happening.
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:45.440]  In the film bought, we show some whistleblowers where we interview, I had to drive out into the
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:52.720]  woods in Pennsylvania, where this whistleblower literally ruined his life for 10 years. He was
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:26:02.480]  an investigator for the state of Pennsylvania. And he went after the head of the pharmaceutical
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:09.360]  board in the state. And there, as he got into it, he found out, that was a picture of him right
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:15.280]  there, he found out that it was the big pharmaceutical companies behind it. And his boss told him to
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:21.360]  back off, they give to both sides of the aisle, we're not going after those guys. And so he continued
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:28.640]  to work the case. Finally, 10 years later, Johnson and Johnson pled guilty to the lies they told about
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:35.040]  the drug, Risperdoll, that we're talking about death. They pled guilty to criminal charges.
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:43.600]  They paid now close to $3 billion in fines. But meanwhile, they made $33 billion. We have the
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:51.920]  GlaxoSmithKline whistleblower that once again, they made $44 billion and they paid a $3 billion
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:58.880]  fine. It's just the cost of doing business. And meanwhile, these people who risk their very
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:05.360]  lives and livelihood to try to bring, they're one in a million. It's happening every day.
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:10.720]  Folks can get your film at JeffHfilms.com or Amazon. We're going to be carrying it. I was like,
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:14.240]  why haven't I seen this? Why aren't we carrying it? I'm told it's even more powerful than doctored.
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:20.960]  And I think every chiropractor in the country should be selling your film to folks that come in.
[02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:25.840]  Everybody has to weaponize against the globalists in the Info War. We're under attack. We have a
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:30.640]  right to defense. We all become our own media operations in one way or another, or we lose
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:36.080]  everything. The First Amendment, the Second, the Fourth, the Tenth, the Ninth, Medical Freedom
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:40.800]  is under attack. The system knows there's an awakening happening, so they're trying to put
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:45.120]  the clamps down right now. That's clearly what's happening. Do you agree with that? Or can you
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:51.360]  speak to the awakening? This is such, I'm telling you, it's people like you that we really do have
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:56.880]  to do this. I took out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal for bought three weeks ago. That's
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:02.720]  right. The next day, there was a story saying you need to get your kids vaccinated that was
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:09.040]  almost the size of my full page ad. There were 10 days in a row in the Wall Street Journal,
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:14.720]  articles about this measles epidemic, you need to get your kids vaccinated, talking about the
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:20.960]  problem of people not getting vaccinated over and over and over. And I thought about it. I passed
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:27.120]  billboards here in Utah that saying, get your kids vaccinated. It's a war. It's a full push.
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:34.400]  And meanwhile, I took out one ad one time. That's all I could afford to do. A full page
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:41.120]  ad in the Wall Street Journal cost a fortune. There's no way for any of us to make a difference
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:47.760]  in fighting with them down that road. It really is exactly what you said. We all have to support,
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:55.280]  to create our own media operation. We all have to be, darkness is no match for light,
[02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:59.680]  if there's light. That's right. And again, if somebody just shows their friends and family
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:04.320]  doctored, or if somebody just tells folks about info wars.com and sends a free link to a podcast
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:09.360]  or a video that they think is important of our great reporters, or if somebody starts their own
[02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:14.080]  blog and writes their own articles and goes down and takes photos and covers things, we'll have
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:18.800]  people everywhere. If you know a neighbor that got brain damage from vaccines, go interview them,
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:24.160]  put it on YouTube. All of you are leaders. Don't thank Jeff. Don't thank me. We're trying to survive
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:28.960]  and help our families and help you. I mean, that's what empathy is all about. You've got empathy,
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:32.720]  not because you're a nice guy, but because it's there, you get what happens to somebody else
[02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:38.560]  could happen to you. We're all one and we've all got to become leaders. And this, this, this, this
[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:45.600]  evil, parasitic, anti-free market corporate mafia will fall. Just as sure as day follows night.
[02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:52.000]  Stay with us. Final segment with Jeff. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.

[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:49.120]  Jeff Hays is our guest. Kudos to drudgereport.com always leading breaking news.
[02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:54.640]  Link top right hand corner drudgereport.com. We'll put it on screen right now an article that
[02:33:54.640 --> 02:34:06.640]  just went live minutes ago at infowars.com. We have a story right there. Troops move off
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:12.880]  bases and if you go ahead and click on it, Feds preparing to invade Texas. Some participants
[02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:19.280]  will be wearing civilian attire and driving civilian vehicles and they list Texas, I want to
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:25.920]  put another sub headline, Feds prepare to invade Texas, list state as hostile. It says in the document,
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:29.120]  I want to get a document cam shot. You guys did this really quick, great job. We just covered
[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:33.440]  this one hour ago. One hour ago it's already on drudge. It's a great job getting up quick,
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:39.840]  just add in their screenshots of the document of Texas in red showing that Texas is seen as hostile.
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:46.000]  People are not going to believe this. Just like six years ago when we got the Secret Mic report
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.800]  from state police in Missouri, then another document from state police in California and
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:56.160]  people didn't believe it and then federal marshals, well a federal marshal, gave us another one,
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:35:02.640]  the master document that was copied at the state level, changed for the state, saying that veterans
[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:08.400]  gun owners, Ron Paul, Aaron Russo, people like that are basically terrorists. Then a week later,
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:12.400]  Ron Paul came out and the fed said, no, that's all real and he shouldn't have restricted documents.
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:18.480]  In fact, I had the FBI get a little upset with me. I said, go ahead, make up whatever you're
[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:24.000]  going to make up. I don't care if it says restricted. You guys are really doing some nasty
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.600]  stuff and do you really want to say the veterans of the terrorist? I mean, come on.
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:33.120]  So that's on drudgerport.com. So that article that blurbs up, let's add to it,
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:37.840]  you know, because I know it was written quickly, screenshots of the document, because a lot of
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:41.920]  folks want to actually click on the document. And there's video there of Biggs and I going
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:47.520]  through the document. So thank you, Matt Drudge, true American media at drudgerport.com,
[02:35:47.520 --> 02:35:53.520]  true muckraker, drudgerport.com. And we'll go through that document as we talk to Jeff Hayes.
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:58.800]  Jeff, just separately, the maker of doctored that we sell it in forestore.com. And the other
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:01.920]  film I haven't seen yet, doctors is so professional. I mean, I wonder you've been
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:06.000]  on the shortlist for Academy Awards. I'd love to work with you sometime on a film.
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:12.240]  But your film bought really from the trailers and things I've seen looks hardcore.
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:17.840]  But just hearing about the military training to basically domestically take over,
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:22.400]  what do you think they're getting ready for financial collapse and why on earth would they
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:30.720]  list Texas as quote hostile? That's astounding to me. And again, this is where what I look at it.
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:37.280]  And like I've been living for the last year and a half in a world of vaccines and GMOs without
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:45.280]  really lifting my head up. And as I was in New Jersey last week for a screening and on Monday
[02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:53.920]  of this week, there were 400 mostly moms that went down to the New Jersey Senate and had their
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:37:01.200]  voice heard. And then the New Jersey, the committee that is looking at the bill for to
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:07.520]  get rid of any personal belief exemption in New Jersey, they listened to them, then they met
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:12.880]  and ignored them. And of course, sent the bill straight to the full Senate.
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:19.280]  But I'm telling you, there is something happening here, a concerted effort that I would not have
[02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:23.600]  believed if I wasn't seeing it with my own eyes. That's right. The tyrants are moving. The power
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:28.880]  grab is on. It's like a gold rush of tyranny. And they're going to have local citizens involved
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:34.640]  in the PsyOp, the document says, to prepare the public to work with the military. I mean,
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:41.280]  what are they getting ready for? Whenever all of a sudden we've got 36 states with vaccine bills,
[02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:47.440]  110 different bills that all appear at the same time, all with much of the same language.
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:56.400]  And you know, the same thing is happening in GMO. I literally, this is when programs like yours
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:04.240]  become profoundly important. I don't know that they can, I've never seen a more professional
[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:09.360]  effort as I watch all the news stories that happened. There's definitely, I wouldn't have
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:15.600]  believed if I hadn't seen it. Thank goodness that we have access to each other to be able to
[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:21.760]  absolutely. And Jeff, it's, I want your reason, your take on why they're pushing so hard. I mean,
[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:25.840]  I think I know why. I mean, in fact, I'm certain the part of it is this, but I want you to augment
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:32.880]  or add to it or disagree with it, whatever you think. McDonald's is multi years imploding.
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:36.800]  I mean, they're basically closing all over the place in the US and other Western areas
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:41.760]  that are expanding and unfortunately dumbed down third world areas. But every other major
[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:47.280]  globalist operation is taking GMO out of their ice cream or bovine growth hormone out or,
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:53.120]  or glyphosate or fluoride and all these scientists in the government are coming out and saying, no,
[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:57.760]  whistleblowers on vaccines, highest level that ran the vaccine program saying, no, we were basically
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:02.080]  ordered to lie about it. It actually hurts people. We covered it up, you know, Merc whistleblowers.
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:06.240]  I think the conscience is rising just like our military two years ago, refusing to strike a
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:11.280]  sod and telling the Pentagon, we're not doing it. That was led by officers and, and enlisted.
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:19.120]  And so on so many fronts, people are waking up. And so the empire is striking back. We've blown
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:23.040]  up the death star, but hey, it doesn't matter. They're still coming with their star destroyers.
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:27.440]  So folks seem to know we're in the battle. We're having victories, but the war ain't over. People,
[02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:31.440]  they're coming. I mean, they are, they are, they are dropping the hammer. What do you say, Jeff?
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:38.160]  I, you're exactly right. This is, there's too much money at stake when, when you, you look at,
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:45.440]  at the, the astounding amount of money and the control that they've had. But again, the, the power
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:51.440]  in this culture and it, everybody in the, on the medical side, they, they, they dismiss these
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:56.320]  mothers by saying, you're just a mom, you're just a mom. I'm not listening to you. Well, now these
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:40:02.560]  moms are being, you mentioned the whistleblower, the whistleblower case for Merck, where we interviewed
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:10.000]  the lawyer for that case. You know, the, and it's, you know, where the media didn't cover at all
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:16.960]  the fact that the CDC whistleblower who said, yes, we lied about, we hid evidence about autism
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:22.720]  and vaccines. This is leaking out. And I don't think they're going to be able to unring this bell,
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:29.520]  but you're right. There is a fight on. I didn't want to be a part of this fight. I, I made the film
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:36.960]  bought for my daughter, who's 32 years old, has three children. And my goal was to have the conversation
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:44.080]  for her that she doesn't want to have with her friends. I literally just wanted to create a place,
[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:49.520]  a safe space to have a conversation to say, wait a minute, there are two sides of the story. We
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:55.680]  need to look at it. Unfortunately, I don't think we get to have that rational, rational conversation.
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:41:00.960]  It really is a battle. You're absolutely right. And up on screen, we can go to infowars.com into
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:06.800]  the headlines fed for pairing to invade Texas, joint military forces to engage in urban warfare
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:12.960]  training with citizens. They list the state as hostile. And this should be big national news.
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:19.680]  They're going to be running it out of the army base camp, Swift, a former prisoner of war camp,
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:28.160]  and down a joint task force six at Fort bless. And they only list Utah as the only other area
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:33.600]  listed as a hostile state. So they're afraid of photo and Utah has been fighting you. Man,
[02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:38.400]  they were really, this is insane. I mean, that they would be this bold and list the entire state.
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:41.840]  But I guess they have had a lot of county judges and others say they're not going to
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:45.040]  be go along with gun confiscation. They've had police departments say they're not going to be part
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:49.840]  of it. And sheriffs, I can't believe we've reached this point, you know, four years ago when the
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:55.680]  legislature was passing a law that you Nancy passed at the house to not let TSA group genitals.
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:00.880]  Obama said, I will have F 16s blockade your state. No commercial aircraft. That was in
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:06.960]  the Austin, American statesmen in AP. I mean, if tyranny came along, Jeff, would we notice it
[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:14.320]  is the question? And that's that's the hard part. It's a seduction where it's just a little bit
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:20.400]  different than yesterday. But I didn't come in a Hitler outfit. It didn't come in, you know,
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:24.080]  the old tyrannies and it's done incrementally. So how do we recognize it and fight it?
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:30.560]  It's fine. I remember after 9 11 when I walked through the airport, how delighted I was to see
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:36.400]  our National Guard there. And, you know, and I love those guys. And I'm glad they were there.
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:42.560]  There comes a point, though, where when something like that happens and then we give away our freedoms
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:49.680]  and willingly and one after the other. It's not the troops that are bad. It's that they're using
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:55.520]  threats as a pretext to take our liberties that aren't even about the threat. Absolutely. And
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:02.320]  getting us to willingly go along with it out of fear. Wow. Well, listen, I want to invite
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:08.720]  you back up soon, Jeff, as soon as we're carrying the other film bought soon as I buy a bunch of
[02:43:08.720 --> 02:43:13.280]  those and sell them in the infowarstore.com area. A doctorate is available there right now.
[02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:18.400]  Bought is available at Jeff facefilms.com or everywhere. It's the best seller. And people
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:22.560]  putting out reality like you, you know, you're successful. Mainstream media is dying. We're
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:26.960]  successful. Mainstream media is dying. We still can vote with our dollars in the free market
[02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:30.480]  while we still have that and maybe turn this around peacefully. Jeff, thank you.
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:34.960]  Thank you so much for having me. Thank you. Well, amazing filmmaker really impressed.
[02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:39.280]  I can't wait to see the other film. Just briefly that I'm going to your calls.
[02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:48.880]  I got up about six a.m. this morning and it was still dark and I was walking down the hall to get
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:56.320]  coffee. And I just sat down in the chair in the dark looking out the window at the mist on the
[02:43:56.320 --> 02:44:05.200]  hills. And I just thought, oh my God, it's all accurate. It's worse than we thought though.
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:15.600]  And it's just insane that the elite are this bad. I mean, folks, liberty and free market
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:21.040]  is an engine of so much wealth it'll make your head spin. They have purposely done the public
[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:25.120]  down made them lazy. They have purposely screwed everything over. They have purposely tried to
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:30.880]  break up families and create mental illness viruses out there. They're openly announcing
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:35.200]  everything's being watched and tracked with AI. They're openly announcing once this is all in
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:38.800]  place, they're going to start exterminating everybody with hard kill, not just soft kill.
[02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:48.800]  They're openly saying that Texas is a hostile force. The Texas is a hostile state to the
[02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:54.800]  North Come and the Joint Special Forces Command. And they're going to have the Navy Seals and the
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:58.960]  Delta Force and the Marines and the Army all training with local police and everybody for
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:04.000]  snatching grabs and taking over county courthouses from governments that don't go along. I mean,
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:07.360]  you know what's going to happen if a civil war starts and they blow stuff up? The Patriots are
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:11.760]  going to get the word out that they didn't do it. The first few courthouses, the first few places,
[02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:16.240]  you're going to successfully go in and kill the local sheriffs and people and the citizens that
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:21.360]  fight you. But then after that, the rest of the military is going to see through it and then the
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:25.440]  officers, everybody knows what's going to happen. I'm not even going to go into it, but the military
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:30.640]  has all had this discussion. So the minute you try to pull this and they call all the enlisted in
[02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:35.920]  with the non-commissioned officers and the colonel comes in and goes, men, they just hit Dallas
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:42.000]  with a low yield. The Patriots working with Al Qaeda. We've got intel, we arrested them,
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:46.000]  they've admitted it. And now we're going to have to go in. Here's a list of 2,000 people
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:49.920]  we think are involved. They're starting to look at the list and it's like Ron Paul and Alex Jones,
[02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:54.560]  all these people. And the military is all going to say, start. And then yeah, they'll go after
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:58.800]  some of the first targets. And then by then they'll go, this is all made up. And then it is going to
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:05.120]  go wild. And they want to wait till their drones and robots are all in place to autonomously take
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:09.360]  people out and then to die later, claim it was a Chinese hack or whatever. I mean, I've war-gamed
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:14.160]  all this in the brain God gave me. It ain't going to work. I mean, let me tell George Soros and all
[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:18.640]  the rest of this is not going to fly. It isn't going to hunt. It ain't going to float.
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:24.960]  And that's not wishful thinking. I mean, my gut, my brain, my intellect.
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:31.600]  Historically, I've studied this. I'm not a lazy person. I'm not bragging, but just about general
[02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:35.120]  concepts. I could sit around talking about quantum mechanics and M theory with people.
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:42.160]  I'm sitting with William Benny and I go, but doesn't a hologram of a mathematical equation
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:47.280]  of something with that much data create mathematically its own mass and create a
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:53.440]  distortion mirror of the sub key, a projection of the dark matter coding. And he was just like,
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:57.120]  I'm not talking about classified stuff. And I said, I don't want to know classified stuff.
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:47:00.720]  And he was, and of course, Buckley's real smart and people were there. They're like,
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:04.800]  but Alex, what are you getting into? And I just suddenly understood what I just started
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:08.080]  sort of spouting the stuff off. I don't even know how I know all this stuff, folks. At the
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:15.840]  time, I just started spewing out of my mouth. And, but I know that in the universe,
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:19.440]  they look at older parts of it and it's distorted and matter moves a different rate.
[02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:23.440]  I know that with the mathematic equations of a French physicist, I forget his name,
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:29.440]  with the hexagon formations on the North and South Pole of Saturn, that he predicted that when
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:32.960]  the probe flew over it, that it would show those patterns because of an interdimensional
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:39.280]  projection of dark matter from the mass of it being so large. And I'm no mathematician. I
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:42.960]  understand the basic concepts. It's like it leaves a ghost image. I don't know why I'm
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:49.600]  going off into all that. I said, I go to your phone calls. It's just that I understand the
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:54.080]  enemy operation. I see it. I see the codes. I see the patterns. I know what they're going to do
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:48:04.000]  before they do it. And, but it's not hard now, ladies and gentlemen, to see what's going on.
[02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:12.240]  Oh, it's just incredible to be alive. The world is so wonderful. The universe is so incredible.
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:17.520]  There's so much good in the world and the globalists want to dominate culture and make us look at them.
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:22.400]  Make our kids go in McDonald's with dead babies and skulls on the door laughing at us like we're
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:33.760]  unconscious baboons. A bunch of boobies. A booby's a stupid pirate before the FCC tries to say I'm
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:44.000]  using bad words here. The level of ignorance. It's like a, oh, it's all too insane. It's all,
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:50.480]  oh, can't make this up. Charlie Sheen calling me how to take this.
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:57.120]  Hey, bro, I'm on air. Can I call you right back in 10 minutes?
[02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:02.880]  Well, listen, you're awesome.
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:12.080]  Yes, they are. Yes, they are. But if you're going to, you know,
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:20.160]  hold on one second, I'm going to tell them, I'm going to tell them play a despotism thing in
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:24.320]  the break. So I can talk to you now and we'll come back. Okay. Okay. No, no, no, no. I got time.
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:33.760]  Go ahead and roll something guys. I'm going to hear this. Okay. Sorry. Go ahead. As a community
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:42.160]  moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people. That's veteran Denver police
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:50.480]  officer Charles Jones, the fourth, smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times. Officers
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:54.320]  accused of using excessive force on a suspect and to try to erase the evidence.
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:05.520]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio and other channels of
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:11.360]  communication are controlled by only a few people. Does it raise ethical questions about the use of
[02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:15.120]  government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:21.840]  disclosure that they were produced by the government? What difference at this point doesn't make?
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:27.360]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in the community, he looks beyond
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:32.960]  fine words and noble phrases. There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:39.360]  that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just. Tonight, I'm announcing those
[02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:48.880]  actions. What I say, go see, I'm the law around here. We came, we saw, we died.
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:55.280]  Yes, a modern warfare. Our military leaders are finding the worst.
[02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:04.480]  The human body is extraordinary. Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it,
[02:51:04.480 --> 02:51:08.080]  it still works hard to stay in balance. Thousands upon thousands of people

[02:54:16.720 --> 02:54:22.400]  Thanks for criticizing Barack Hussein Obama and he made the joke, that Obama says he's Kenyan.
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:26.720]  Obama said last week in a speech that I wouldn't have moved to the U.S. if I didn't love it.
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:31.520]  Okay, so Charlie made a joke too, they're calling him racist. It doesn't matter who you are,
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:35.200]  Charlie Sheiner, whoever, you have a right to make fun of the president, especially when he
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:39.760]  makes fun of himself. So Charlie wants me to put on an official statement, he was ready to give it
[02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:43.600]  to me right then, but I just couldn't get it done before I came back from breaks, so when the show
[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:48.120]  no ends. We're going to go with Charlie, write the response for the media. No big deal. That's
[02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:51.920]  what that's why that was going on. Because, you know, if they were saying I was racist,
[02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:57.720]  I would want to respond to it as well. So is Obama racist for saying he's from Kenya?
[02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:03.040]  In fact, can you guys cue that video up? I mean, I know we have it. He said it last week.
[02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:08.160]  Jim in Texas wants to talk about the Pentagon listing Texas's hostile and practicing invasion
[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:13.560]  takeover drills. That story is now drudgerport.com. Jim in Texas, what's your take on this?
[02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:17.960]  Hello, Alex. How are you today? Good, brother. Go ahead.
[02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:24.000]  Well, I just, I heard that earlier today, and I happen to be a border agent here on the border.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:30.400]  I don't really care if they know or not. But just to let you know, many people down here in
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:36.960]  law enforcement, not just working the border. I'm also a law enforcement officer from here,
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:43.240]  my whole adult life. Many people are aware of what's going on with the country. Not too happy
[02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:48.280]  about it. Obviously, we took an oath to do our job. We'll do the best we can down here.
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:56.000]  But I want to thank you for, you know, doing what you do and waking people up. A lot of these
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:01.280]  things five years ago sounded a little weird. But it's all pretty much falling into place.
[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:06.280]  So I basically just called up to thank you. Well, please don't thank me. Everybody knows
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:11.520]  Border Patrol has probably the roughest job in the country. And just with your hands tied
[02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:15.880]  behind your back in just a wild west crazy town. And so we appreciate you.
[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:22.280]  Well, you know, I just want people to understand that, you know, the people that are working down
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:28.000]  here are good people. A lot of the things that are going on here are out of the control of many
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:32.800]  people working down here. But it doesn't mean that we don't love the people and love the service
[02:56:32.800 --> 02:56:38.480]  that we do. It's pretty sad to see what's taking place here. What do you make of the Pentagon
[02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:45.080]  listing Texas's hostile in drills? I mean, this is bold. Well, I don't I don't understand why
[02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:52.200]  people are doing military exercises off of military property to begin with. But when you look at a
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:56.520]  lot of things that have been going on and I mean, not just on conspiracy theories, but I'm just
[02:56:56.520 --> 02:57:00.760]  looking at government bills, just look at things that have gone through. And you can see that,
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:06.280]  you know, more and more, this is turning over to the, you know, some kind of UN type system that
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:11.600]  our Constitution doesn't allow us to do. And many of us down here, I mean, we took a note to the
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:17.440]  Constitution. Absolutely. And we don't, we don't want violence. We don't, you know, but we're not
[02:57:17.440 --> 02:57:22.360]  gonna, I'm an American. I'm not a North American union guy. I'm an American. Let me ask you this
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:29.200]  question. Plus, the the NAU is unelected a bunch of globalists. Do the globalists know that the
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:33.760]  police and military are more awake than the general public and that this isn't going to go the way
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:38.320]  they think. I don't know what they're thinking. Well, I can tell you right now, it's not going to go
[02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:43.200]  the way they think because, you know, for the majority of us, I mean, when you're taking note,
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:47.120]  you know, to the Constitution, you're not taking a note to a politician. And that's what these
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:52.480]  people don't understand. You know, we took an oath to uphold the law. And, you know, the more
[02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:58.560]  that things follow, in my opinion, out of control and morally, we seem to be aspiring out of control.
[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:03.400]  You know, the worst the situation gets, but when you realize that a lot of these people are
[02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:09.480]  dependent because they've been made dependent. And it's a sad situation to try to take down an
[02:58:09.480 --> 02:58:14.760]  economic machine that has worked and has been prosperous for many people over many, many
[02:58:14.760 --> 02:58:20.120]  generations. And now we're about to just completely divide us and tear us apart. And there's no
[02:58:20.120 --> 02:58:25.320]  reason for all this. Absolutely, Jim. Thank you so much. That's why I'm not anti police and board
[02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:30.000]  patrol and stuff. Because the average person I talk to from those groups is just 10 times more
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:34.480]  awake than the public. So our job is to get the public awake. We're supposedly in charge of the
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:37.920]  government. We're the ones letting the government be out of control. A little bit of overdrive coming
[02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:46.720]  up to talk to Pete, Neil and others. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:55.040]  Alex Jones here. For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and
[02:58:55.040 --> 02:59:00.560]  chemist to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life changing health benefits. So
[02:59:00.560 --> 02:59:05.920]  many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives and even GMOs.
[02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:12.240]  Introducing the all new ancient defense herbal immunity blend crafted with over 14 key ancient
[02:59:12.240 --> 02:59:17.680]  herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most
[02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:22.880]  dangerous season of the year. We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to
[02:59:22.880 --> 02:59:28.000]  bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:33.760]  ever created in the realm of herbal immunity. Experience the benefits of combining over 14
[02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:39.440]  ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science. Now is the
[02:59:39.440 --> 02:59:47.440]  time to secure ancient defense for you and your family. Visit infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:59:47.440 --> 02:59:54.960]  That's infowarslife.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:02.480 --> 03:00:09.040]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:09.040 --> 03:00:15.680]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Final segment.
[03:00:15.680 --> 03:00:22.080]  It's incredible to see all this unfolding. I cannot get over the fact the Pentagon list,
[03:00:23.600 --> 03:00:30.720]  the United States, Texas is a hostile area that in Utah. And where people prepare to know about
[03:00:30.720 --> 03:00:36.640]  the globalist takeover, Texas and Utah. That's preparing to invade Texas is the headline.
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:42.240]  And again, they had a better headline. I told them change it and put list state as hostile.
[03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:47.120]  I was one of that added to the other headline they had. Their old subheadline was excellent about
[03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:52.000]  deploying the military. But then they list the state as hostile. That's the added thing I need
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:56.960]  in the headline to really get the facts out to everybody out there. Okay, writers, thank you.
[03:00:56.960 --> 03:01:00.000]  Another beef headed up right now. I had a bunch of documentation and everything.
[03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.560]  Pete in FEMA region nine, you're on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[03:01:04.800 --> 03:01:08.320]  Alex Jones, you crazy man. I don't know why you can't just turn in your guns,
[03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:11.360]  take your vaccines, speak to McDonald's and be quiet. I don't know why.
[03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:14.160]  Exactly. It's extreme. I mean, you know, so why?
[03:01:15.920 --> 03:01:20.640]  So, and you know what? Just real quick, I'm calling out on a moderate. I listed you on a
[03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:26.800]  1080 and a 1340 KMY, Michael's Whirling Station. And I just want real quick before I get to my point,
[03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:32.800]  if anybody ever questions this guy's ashes, I saw him speak at Coconut Grove. And Alex,
[03:01:32.800 --> 03:01:38.160]  I got to say it was very motivational. And at times it looked to me like you both
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:42.480]  don't have tears in your eyes. So this man believes everything that he is saying.
[03:01:42.480 --> 03:01:46.560]  Oh, I get tears in my eyes all the time, not a fear, but sadness of how bad this is.
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:50.880]  It's passionate sadness. Yes, I know. And I saw that.
[03:01:51.920 --> 03:01:56.960]  So anyways, what I want to get to is Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors. And I kind of
[03:01:56.960 --> 03:02:02.960]  been digging into this while I've been on hold. I sent a link out to your Twitter account. And
[03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:10.720]  I sent a link out to Joe Biggs and I sent a link out to Showtips. Santa Cruz Sentinel had an article
[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:17.440]  about an agenda saying that was brought up to the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors.
[03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:23.360]  I don't know if it's an actual bill or if it's the support of a letter of SB 277,
[03:02:23.360 --> 03:02:26.880]  which is the to get rid of the exemptions in California.
[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:29.200]  That's right. Forced inoculations.
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:36.400]  Right. So like I said, I'm still digging into this as I'm talking to you right now and I'll
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:42.160]  forward the links as I go. But I just got one thing to say, you know, New World Order, Obama,
[03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:45.440]  federal government, state government, local government, there's only one way you're going
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:49.120]  to forcibly inoculate my children. You're going to have to step over my dead body.
[03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:53.840]  Well, that's here's the deal. They're trying to do stuff they know will cause a civil war.
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:03:01.200]  Guns, forced inoculations. And again, putting the enforcers in the middle of this, the enforcers
[03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:04.800]  need to say, no, they're citizens as well, and say, we're going to be peace officers.
[03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:09.920]  We're not going to enforce unconstitutional garbage. I mean, this is totalitarianism 101.
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:13.600]  Good to hear from you, Pete. Pam is the last caller we have time for. Sorry to wrenching,
[03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:16.560]  Justin. Pam, you're our tail gunner today from Tennessee. Welcome.
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:22.880]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing today? I'm telling you, I'm really getting freaked out.
[03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:29.680]  Stuff's moving so fast. It's crazy. Well, I'm with your brother all the way. Listen,
[03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:36.000]  I take the sacred 12 and I do that on my tongue and I wash it with water, but I'm taking the
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:42.080]  survival shield and the civil bullet and I just take one of the civil bullet and about five drops
[03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:49.840]  of the survival shield X2 and I stick that in my coffee. Well, do you like it in the morning?
[03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:56.240]  And it's, you know, you can't really taste it. So, you know, I know you show where you're putting
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:04:01.040]  it in your water, but it's actually good in the coffee. Sure, but you can put it on your tongue
[03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:05.440]  or put it in water, put it in coffee. You know, too much heat can kind of break down vitamins
[03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:08.800]  and nutrients, but a little bit of heat's not going to hurt it from our experience.
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:12.720]  Have you liked it? Have you had anything happen since you've been taking the, the, the nutraceuticals?
[03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:19.520]  No, I love it. And you know, I haven't been sick and since I've been taking this, I haven't gotten
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:24.880]  anything and I just think it's a blessing and I think that people need to support you because
[03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:29.200]  you really need that right now. Well, you sound like a sweetheart, I tell you, a good Tennessee
[03:04:29.200 --> 03:04:34.880]  lady. You're a sweetheart, ma'am. We're out of time. God bless you. I'm going to go get all the
[03:04:34.880 --> 03:04:39.440]  rest of the news out, ladies and gentlemen, and there is a lot of it at infowars.com and prison
[03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:45.040]  planet.com and we're talking about the nightly news tonight, seven o'clock central and all the
[03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:50.960]  south by southwest angles on GMOs, globalization, militarization of police, Joe Beggs, former staff
[03:04:50.960 --> 03:04:55.360]  sergeant. It's working on a big report on this military invasion of Texas. Can't believe I'm
[03:04:55.360 --> 03:05:16.720]  actually saying this is like red dawn.
