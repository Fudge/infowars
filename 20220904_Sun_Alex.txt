[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  Just how much of the Great Reset has already dug its blood-soaked talons into modern civilization?
[00:29.960 --> 00:35.460]  Standing up for our people in Canada, we will have a government under my leadership that works for Canadians
[00:35.460 --> 00:39.460]  and I will ban all blind ministers or any involvement in the world I've not been born in.
[00:39.460 --> 00:44.960]  I've got a message for all illegals. If you don't want to be pushed back, if you don't want to be arrested,
[00:44.960 --> 00:51.960]  if you don't want to be shot, don't come to our borders. Do not come to the Polish border. Then you're safe.
[00:51.960 --> 01:00.960]  It's not us, it's not our police who came up to beat you up, to push you, or to arrest you. It's you who tried to break the law on our land.
[01:00.960 --> 01:07.960]  Even though churches, gyms, schools, weddings, funerals, stay-at-home orders, curfews, mask mandates, vax mandates,
[01:07.960 --> 01:12.960]  and every business closed except big corporate chains like Walmart and Big Tech Thriving and the Biggest Transfer,
[01:12.960 --> 01:19.960]  well, they'll credibly say we would never actually really lock down. Then they're redefining it in real time as we speak.
[01:19.960 --> 01:28.960]  The signs of sabotage are numerous and widespread as the vultures of great reset tyranny circle a sickened and angered populace
[01:28.960 --> 01:33.960]  that is on track for a mass starvation event in the very near future.
[01:33.960 --> 01:41.960]  It was an article on the UN website. On the further UN, about 860 million people could starve to death in the next 24 months, almost a billion.
[01:41.960 --> 01:43.960]  In the next 24 months?
[01:43.960 --> 01:57.960]  Yeah. People depend on you for what's left of the food. You control them. Where food is abundant and cheap, you do not control them.
[01:57.960 --> 02:06.960]  Where energy is cheap and abundant, you do not control them. Scarcity equals dependency, equals control.
[02:06.960 --> 02:12.960]  And that's why they're targeting the food chain, they're targeting them. Energy supply, they're targeting everything.
[02:12.960 --> 02:20.960]  The French President Emmanuel Macron's country has been flooded with the United Nations self-proclaimed replacement migration,
[02:20.960 --> 02:25.960]  regardless of what the propaganda denying its existence would have you believe.
[02:25.960 --> 02:36.960]  Macron is now priming the pump for energy crises and food shortages as the World Economic Forum once again tightens its grip on the neck of the French people.
[02:36.960 --> 02:46.960]  What we are living through is a time of great upheaval. Firstly, because we are witnessing, and not just since this summer,
[02:46.960 --> 02:51.960]  but over the past few years, the end of what we might have seen as abundance.
[02:51.960 --> 03:09.960]  The disgraced California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the quiet part out loud, pushing California towards a goal of zero emissions by 2035, and 30% or 14 million of California's drivers into electric vehicles within four years.
[03:09.960 --> 03:17.960]  Currently, there are roughly just a mere one million driving electric vehicles in the Golden State of liberal lunacy.
[03:17.960 --> 03:24.960]  In the next 15 years, we will eliminate in the state of California the sales of internal combustion engines.
[03:24.960 --> 03:35.960]  Extreme heat will grip much of the state through the Labor Day weekend. This morning, Governor Gavin Newsom is laying out ways you can stay safe and prevent putting a strain on the electrical grid over the upcoming days.
[03:35.960 --> 03:36.960]  Let's listen in.
[03:36.960 --> 04:05.960]  When Biden himself has blazed an unprecedented trail torching our constitutional republic.
[04:05.960 --> 04:13.960]  The task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[04:13.960 --> 04:22.960]  For those brave right-wing Americans to say it's all about keeping America, keeping America as independent and safe.
[04:22.960 --> 04:28.960]  If you want to fight against the country, you need an F-15. You need something a little more than a gun.
[04:28.960 --> 04:37.960]  We are watching right now a very radical and extreme Republican party mirror what we have seen in other places like Nazi Germany, like other places like the Bolsheviks.
[04:37.960 --> 04:57.960]  If we are not able to ask skeptical questions to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then we're up for grabs for the next charlatan, political or religious who comes ambling along.
[04:57.960 --> 04:59.960]  This is John Bown reporting.
[05:27.960 --> 05:32.960]  Regular low-grade fish oil in all the studies does outstanding things.
[05:32.960 --> 05:40.960]  This is the highest grade and it's not been pasteurized, it's not been boiled, so it has its original effects intact.
[05:40.960 --> 05:49.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody should visit mfoldworkstore.com today and get ultimate fish oil finally back at stock for 15% off.
[05:49.960 --> 05:53.960]  For our regular fans, they're big supporters, you're going to love it, you already know how great it is.
[05:53.960 --> 06:00.960]  Just sit on the fence, experience ultimate fish oil for yourself, try taking some before bedtime and see what happens with your dream.
[06:48.960 --> 06:52.960]  We'll be discussing that and more a little bit later in the show.
[06:52.960 --> 07:00.960]  First up, a wide range of topics today to discuss, both Trump's rally in Pennsylvania and what it shows and how it scares the establishment.
[07:00.960 --> 07:10.960]  So much that presidential historian Michael Beschloss was on Twitter demanding during Trump's speech that Trump be jailed and that Trump go to prison.
[07:10.960 --> 07:14.960]  That's the degree of inanity and insanity gripping the deep state establishment.
[07:14.960 --> 07:22.960]  Indeed, one could argue that much of Biden's speech this past week wasn't just so much a speech targeting Trump and Trump supporters,
[07:22.960 --> 07:33.960]  as it was a speech of the deep state's rage at their impotence and incompetence in being able to control and limit the ability of the MAGA movement to continue to grow across the nation
[07:33.960 --> 07:37.960]  and of populism to grow and expand across the globe.
[07:37.960 --> 07:45.960]  Clearly, when whoever designed the set for V for Vendetta thought that it would be a good idea to script it for Biden's speech,
[07:45.960 --> 07:54.960]  the same mindset and mentality previously gripped him as we saw Zelensky give a speech to Congress that looked something like right out of 1984.
[07:54.960 --> 08:05.960]  Apparently, whoever read the Two Minutes of Hate speech represented in the film in the book of George Orwell apparently thought that maybe they should just replicate it in general.
[08:05.960 --> 08:17.960]  They've seen movies like V for Vendetta in 1984 as scripts to follow rather than as something to be a terrified of, to oppose, to try to refuse and reject.
[08:17.960 --> 08:30.960]  It shows the degree to which the deep state has lost its mind and that's what makes the deep state so dangerous is when it gets to the place where it feels its own existence is at risk,
[08:30.960 --> 08:37.960]  then it has been shown to be willing to do anything. Indeed, we could go back to the assassinations of President John Kennedy,
[08:37.960 --> 08:46.960]  presidential candidate Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, the impeachment of President Nixon just in the United States in a 10-year span,
[08:46.960 --> 08:52.960]  where the deep state didn't think its agenda was being sufficiently implemented, or we could look all around the world.
[08:52.960 --> 09:06.960]  People forget that Latin America was replaced with dictators throughout the 1960s to where pretty much the entire continent was aligned with deep state dictators rather than the local indigenous populist movements in many of those nations.
[09:06.960 --> 09:17.960]  Same with Central America. The overthrowing of Arbenias was considered to be a major event that led to the radicalization of peasant and worker and civil rights movements across Central and Latin America,
[09:17.960 --> 09:27.960]  more towards the hard left because of the deep state's unwillingness to accept any form of popular restraint or restriction on its institutional power.
[09:27.960 --> 09:43.960]  Indeed, as we will discuss later on, there is substantial evidence that what the deep state is seeking is a legal imprimatur, a judicial approval and sanction that their power supersedes the president's constitutional power.
[09:43.960 --> 09:53.960]  This is the mindset that they are seeking, and Biden is an effective personality to represent the dementia candidate of these deep state policies,
[09:53.960 --> 10:03.960]  policies that have long been out of step with both the American people, but increasingly just economic, geopolitical, military reality.
[10:03.960 --> 10:16.960]  We're seeing that same thing in Ukraine. For example, while the Western press and the current version of the Drudge report, which is not like the old Drudge report since Matt Drudge sold it some years ago,
[10:16.960 --> 10:25.960]  often will portray the deep state agenda as winning. They'll say Trump's in trouble, just like they say Ukraine is succeeding in the conflict.
[10:25.960 --> 10:35.960]  There was this great counteroffensive that was talked about for almost a month or so, weeks and weeks in advance, that Ukraine was going to launch against the Harrison region,
[10:35.960 --> 10:46.960]  which is a little bit north of Crimea controlled by the Russians since the very beginning of this conflict, in at least this version of the conflict in 2021 and 2022.
[10:46.960 --> 10:59.960]  How did the counteroffensive go? Well, it's such a disaster, such a debacle. They basically just put out their soldiers and many of them conscripts to just be executed en masse by Russian artillery.
[10:59.960 --> 11:10.960]  Because of Russian artillery superiority and Russian air force superiority and air superiority in general, as well as superiority of trained and skilled soldiers,
[11:10.960 --> 11:23.960]  rather than conscripts and recent trainees, indeed the UK report about taking 10,000 or so Ukrainians and training them, the internal report leaked this week that showed these people are just going to die quickly on the battlefield.
[11:23.960 --> 11:30.960]  There's just no means to quickly, capably help them. So what happened with this major so-called counteroffensive?
[11:30.960 --> 11:42.960]  They left him abandoned in the fields in open territory with little protection against the opposing superior air power and artillery and so many deaths that in certain parts of Ukraine,
[11:42.960 --> 11:48.960]  they're creating memorials in honor of the people who died just in this counteroffensive by the Ukrainians.
[11:48.960 --> 11:58.960]  So no great success. A few small towns, they capture, they lose the next day. They end up captured and snared in a certain place and just get taken out en masse.
[11:58.960 --> 12:06.960]  And so what some wonder, would the Russians continually gaining more land in the Donbass, more land in the southern part of Ukraine,
[12:06.960 --> 12:19.960]  more capacity to go over towards Odessa to be in a position to seize all of the farm-rich lands in Ukraine, seize all of the industrial regions, industrial rich regions of Ukraine,
[12:19.960 --> 12:27.960]  seize all the seaside regions of Ukraine, including not only the Sea of Assoff, which they now completely control, the Russians,
[12:27.960 --> 12:37.960]  but also the Black Sea and basically leave Ukraine a landlocked country stripped of its major oil, industrial, mineral and agricultural resources.
[12:37.960 --> 12:48.960]  And large parts of these parts of the country also correspond, not coincidentally given Soviet and Russian history, to the strong Russian ancestral provision of the parts of the nation.
[12:48.960 --> 12:58.960]  So what is likely, what we are on pace for is a complete utter debacle in Ukraine comparable to what we just witnessed in Afghanistan a few months ago,
[12:58.960 --> 13:06.960]  to which we saw glimpses of this week in Iraq with major protests rocking even the green zone at different points in Iraq.
[13:06.960 --> 13:20.960]  These continuous with, in Syria, discussions between Syria's Bashar Assad and Erdogan of Turkey to cut a deal to come to a settlement resolution that would effectively push the U.S. out of Syria.
[13:20.960 --> 13:22.960]  What was that 10-year Civil War for?
[13:22.960 --> 13:34.960]  So one more example of complete deep state disaster all around the globe and their response to it is to try to increase the level of repression here at home.
[13:34.960 --> 13:39.960]  They have almost no choice but to do so and that is why they will continue to do so.
[13:39.960 --> 13:53.960]  But one of their tools of oppression, a tool of surveillance known as Geolocation, discussed in Dinesh D'Souza's movie 2000 mules about the election fornication that took place in 2020,
[13:53.960 --> 14:06.960]  is actually also starting to come out in a wide range of legal action including the FTC's legal action against the company of private suits that are brought against others related to the geolocation issues.
[14:06.960 --> 14:09.960]  And what is being exposed in these cases is two facts.
[14:09.960 --> 14:18.960]  One, Dinesh D'Souza's hypothesis and evidentiary presentation in 2000 mules is being increasingly reaffirmed.
[14:18.960 --> 14:31.960]  What the evidence increasingly shows is that geolocation easily and capably can find you wherever you are at and it can aggregate your personal history to where it knows everything you do.
[14:31.960 --> 14:34.960]  Indeed, this is the part that people didn't fully realize.
[14:34.960 --> 14:47.960]  They started to understand that programs like Nest, programs like the various Apple and Google apps in your home, the smart TVs, the little camera on your computer were all capable of recording you for information.
[14:47.960 --> 15:03.960]  What a lot of people underappreciated is that the reason why you get all those free apps on your cell phone and on your tablets is because they, in exchange for the freedom of that app, you're selling them your tracking and tracing information.
[15:03.960 --> 15:07.960]  And the net effect of that is that they're able to track everywhere you go.
[15:07.960 --> 15:11.960]  And from that have a real detailed pattern about your lifestyle.
[15:11.960 --> 15:22.960]  In fact, one of the issues that we'll be discussing up next is it turns out local police all across the country are some of the key subscribers to these geolocation services.
[15:22.960 --> 15:32.960]  And they've been using it in investigative techniques, even though it's been considered illegal by the US Supreme Court to use these kind of techniques for quite some time.
[15:32.960 --> 15:42.960]  They're following you everywhere you go, church meetings, political meetings, personal activities. Did you visit an addiction recovery facility? You name it.
[15:42.960 --> 15:52.960]  We're going to discuss that on the other side of the break, as well as what the next risk for false flags or deep state strategies may be up next throughout the rest of the program.
[15:52.960 --> 15:58.960]  So come back and we'll be discussing each of those facts and factors and more after the break.
[15:58.960 --> 16:05.960]  Vitamin mineral fusion is your one stop shop for health, for longevity, for a boosted immune system.
[16:05.960 --> 16:12.960]  And the climate we live in today and what the globalists are up to, I think anybody not taking a high quality product like this is insane.
[16:12.960 --> 16:17.960]  And there's other great vitamin, mineral, amino acid, you'll complete products out there.
[16:17.960 --> 16:22.960]  Ours is amongst the very best and it is a lower cost than many of the leading brands.
[16:22.960 --> 16:33.960]  But whatever you do, take a high quality, multi vitamin, mineral, amino acid system like this that's liquid that you put in water because you have a better absorption rate when you do that.
[16:33.960 --> 16:39.960]  Now vitamin mineral fusion is our overall best selling product. It finally came in a month ago and we've almost sold out of the first shipment.
[16:39.960 --> 16:41.960]  Hopefully more is coming in a few months.
[16:41.960 --> 16:47.960]  But if you want to experience vitamin, mineral fusion and its effects for yourself or maybe you already love it, you want to stock up.

[16:59.960 --> 17:05.960]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire.
[17:05.960 --> 17:10.960]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year.
[17:10.960 --> 17:12.960]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[17:12.960 --> 17:20.960]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers. And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[17:20.960 --> 17:25.960]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[17:25.960 --> 17:34.960]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do things tax wise.
[17:34.960 --> 17:41.960]  It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep on your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.

[19:59.960 --> 20:20.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:20.960 --> 20:24.960]  We're going to be discussing a range of issues including what are the greatest risks of red flags
[20:24.960 --> 20:34.960]  or the deep state's next steps in their desperate efforts to continue to maintain and control their monopoly on institutional influence in the United States
[20:34.960 --> 20:39.960]  against the populist resistance, against the MAGA movement, against President Trump,
[20:39.960 --> 20:44.960]  especially as their international adventurism continues to fall apart and collapse,
[20:44.960 --> 20:48.960]  as the attempts to sanction Russia backfire on the West,
[20:48.960 --> 20:53.960]  and as their various efforts at political control continue to slip right through their hands,
[20:53.960 --> 20:59.960]  the resistance continues to grow across the political landscape from left to right, from nation to nation.
[20:59.960 --> 21:08.960]  But up next we're going to be discussing, have you ever heard of something called a certain little program that has a fog reveal?
[21:08.960 --> 21:11.960]  That's the name of it, fog reveal.
[21:11.960 --> 21:16.960]  You might not have, but your local police agency probably has, because what is fog reveal?
[21:16.960 --> 21:26.960]  Well fog reveal is a surveillance program that gathers up all the data from various data brokers and vendors all across the globe,
[21:26.960 --> 21:31.960]  but particularly the United States of America concerning your cell phone activity.
[21:31.960 --> 21:38.960]  What most people don't know is that they effectively sign a secret contract,
[21:38.960 --> 21:51.960]  because it's secret to most of the people that get the free apps on their phone, is that in exchange they give up their rights to not have their information tracked, traced, and then sold.
[21:51.960 --> 21:57.960]  And the net effect of this as a recent substantial report by the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
[21:57.960 --> 22:04.960]  joined with the Associated Press and others, detailed, is local police's agencies are some of the big subscribers to this service.
[22:04.960 --> 22:12.960]  So what happens first is you, on your phone or your tablet, you put an app in it, you don't realize you've given up your private information,
[22:12.960 --> 22:16.960]  and now that phone is going to track every place you go.
[22:16.960 --> 22:23.960]  Not just track, people have understood that you're being spied on through your computer, through your phone can intercept your conversations,
[22:23.960 --> 22:31.960]  of course your texts are being surveilled, they understood those aspects of centralized storage and various usage of smart technology.
[22:31.960 --> 22:39.960]  Most people under-appreciated the significance and consequence of having your, everywhere you go, track.
[22:39.960 --> 22:44.960]  This is like having a personal tracer, rather than on your car, it's on your body.
[22:44.960 --> 22:47.960]  Wherever your phone goes, it goes.
[22:47.960 --> 22:58.960]  Now a lot of people in the press try to push away DeSousa's 2000 Mules movie on the grounds that, hey, you can't really have that precise location,
[22:58.960 --> 23:04.960]  but as a recent Federal Trade Commission lawsuit brought against the company that's engaged in these activities,
[23:04.960 --> 23:10.960]  as these information from these investigative journalistic reports about what police agencies are up to,
[23:10.960 --> 23:19.960]  in fact it creates extraordinarily accurate, precise information, because there's a single device known to your phone and tablet
[23:19.960 --> 23:27.960]  that are then assigned and associated with various residential and other IP address activities of your computer,
[23:27.960 --> 23:31.960]  and they can combine it to create a personal roadmap of everything.
[23:31.960 --> 23:37.960]  They see every place you go online, they can track everywhere you go physically.
[23:37.960 --> 23:42.960]  Between the two, they have a perfect script of who you are, they know what you're about.
[23:42.960 --> 23:45.960]  So if somebody went to an abortion clinic, they know it.
[23:45.960 --> 23:48.960]  If somebody went to a drug rehab facility, they know it.
[23:48.960 --> 23:52.960]  If somebody went to a popular place for the purchase of illegal items, they know it.
[23:52.960 --> 23:54.960]  If somebody went to a gun store, they know it.
[23:54.960 --> 23:56.960]  If somebody went to church, they know it.
[23:56.960 --> 24:02.960]  In fact, the old joke about Facebook used to be that if you've liked five things on Facebook,
[24:02.960 --> 24:05.960]  Facebook knows you as well as a casual friend.
[24:05.960 --> 24:10.960]  If you've liked 10 things on Facebook, Facebook knows you as well as a good friend.
[24:10.960 --> 24:15.960]  If you've liked 20 things on Facebook, Facebook knows you as well as a family member,
[24:15.960 --> 24:20.960]  and if you've liked 50 or more things on Facebook, Facebook knows you better than your spouse.
[24:20.960 --> 24:22.960]  That's the old mantra.
[24:22.960 --> 24:27.960]  Now take all of that social media mind data, combine it with all the internet tracking data,
[24:27.960 --> 24:34.960]  aggregate that to all the purchase tracking data, and now put in your physical location tracking data.
[24:34.960 --> 24:39.960]  And what they have is an eye in the sky on everybody all the time that makes
[24:39.960 --> 24:44.960]  enemy of the state look like a lighthearted romp of a film from 30 years ago.
[24:44.960 --> 24:47.960]  So that's the net effect of what's there.
[24:47.960 --> 24:51.960]  And this has always been there, but the government has tried to keep a lid on it.
[24:51.960 --> 24:56.960]  The good way that information can be used is the way DeSousa was able to show
[24:56.960 --> 25:00.960]  how you could use it in 2,000 mules to track how it made very little sense
[25:00.960 --> 25:06.960]  for people to be making multiple trips to multiple vote drop boxes
[25:06.960 --> 25:12.960]  and multiple trips to NGOs that were organizing the vote, so to speak,
[25:12.960 --> 25:16.960]  during the same compressed time frame in a highly unusual exceptional manner
[25:16.960 --> 25:22.960]  and suggested that these were mules, people carrying ballots that were not constitutionally cast
[25:22.960 --> 25:26.960]  in order to influence and shape the presidential election of 2020.
[25:26.960 --> 25:32.960]  The other side is, of course, police love this, but they love this because it creates minority report type powers.
[25:32.960 --> 25:36.960]  They're able to do a whole tracking and tracing of where anybody has been.
[25:36.960 --> 25:42.960]  In fact, probably the next shoe to drop in all of this is going to be the various
[25:42.960 --> 25:48.960]  outweigh the system is being used with algorithmic data to be able to predict
[25:48.960 --> 25:54.960]  where they think criminal activities may occur or who they think may commit criminal activities.
[25:54.960 --> 25:59.960]  It's simply a logical extension of that old film minority report,
[25:59.960 --> 26:05.960]  where the idea was you could take all of this aggregated data and predict what someone will do.
[26:05.960 --> 26:09.960]  That already happens to some degree in the advertising space,
[26:09.960 --> 26:13.960]  because that's how you search for something and then suddenly it shows up.
[26:13.960 --> 26:19.960]  Or you simply went and visited it. You went to a local mall or a local store
[26:19.960 --> 26:25.960]  where at that store certain things were for sale and all of a sudden those things are being advertised to you by text,
[26:25.960 --> 26:32.960]  by email, whenever you open up your web browser, whenever you pull up an app, etc.
[26:32.960 --> 26:35.960]  What people didn't realize is all of these apps were tricks.
[26:35.960 --> 26:39.960]  They were tricks to get you to say, oh, wouldn't that be cool? Oh, wouldn't that be fun?
[26:39.960 --> 26:41.960]  What a little game to play. I like that.
[26:41.960 --> 26:43.960]  Oh, I really like this extra little information.
[26:43.960 --> 26:48.960]  In exchange, what you were actually doing was giving up your entire life,
[26:48.960 --> 26:51.960]  all of your privacy, all of your individual sovereignty,
[26:51.960 --> 26:55.960]  and privacy and anonymity are essential to political sovereignty.
[26:55.960 --> 26:59.960]  Indeed, so much so that our United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held
[26:59.960 --> 27:04.960]  that you have a constitutional First Amendment right to anonymous speech.
[27:04.960 --> 27:08.960]  You have a constitutional First Amendment right of association.
[27:08.960 --> 27:13.960]  This means that, for example, when the NAACP was raising money in the 1950s,
[27:13.960 --> 27:19.960]  a bunch of the southern governors and governments tried to find out who was helping out the civil rights organizations.
[27:19.960 --> 27:25.960]  So the civil rights organizations refused to give up their donor list and their volunteer list.
[27:25.960 --> 27:29.960]  And so that went up to the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court said
[27:29.960 --> 27:35.960]  there is a right constitutional First Amendment right of association also protected under the First Amendment,
[27:35.960 --> 27:40.960]  political association, political expression, association for religious beliefs, political beliefs,
[27:40.960 --> 27:42.960]  or simply private activities.
[27:42.960 --> 27:47.960]  And those First Amendment rights mean that the state cannot find out who your donors are.
[27:47.960 --> 27:50.960]  The same is true in a political expression context.
[27:50.960 --> 27:53.960]  So in case we went forward where somebody was doing pamphleteering
[27:53.960 --> 27:59.960]  and they were refusing to disclose who produced the pamphlets and who published the pamphlets
[27:59.960 --> 28:03.960]  or who was distributing the pamphlet, the U.S. Supreme Court again recognized
[28:03.960 --> 28:06.960]  that is a First Amendment constitutional right.
[28:06.960 --> 28:12.960]  So this is your right to privacy that has been effectively and is continually being eviscerated
[28:12.960 --> 28:16.960]  by these app programs, by Big Tech collusion.
[28:16.960 --> 28:20.960]  Now you might understand why DARPA was so interested in starting the Internet in the first place.
[28:20.960 --> 28:26.960]  Why Big Tech and Big Security and the Big State have been colluding from the very get-go.
[28:26.960 --> 28:33.960]  When we come back after the break, we'll discuss in part how Big Tech has recently been exposed in that collusion
[28:33.960 --> 28:39.960]  by the good federal lawsuit brought in Louisiana, brought by a range of other good people who are joining the suit,
[28:39.960 --> 28:43.960]  including the Attorney General of Louisiana, Missouri, but also private doctors and scientists and others,
[28:43.960 --> 28:53.960]  which exposed the scale of Big Tech collusion with the state to suppress any independent dissonant information.
[28:53.960 --> 29:20.960]  We'll talk about that and what the deep state is up to after the break.
[29:28.960 --> 29:30.960]  Some areas of the world are up over 100%.

[31:10.960 --> 31:15.960]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with and we said,

[31:21.960 --> 31:27.960]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.
[31:27.960 --> 31:37.960]  But with our new product from X7 Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences
[31:37.960 --> 31:39.960]  that's two amazing things for your body.

[32:35.960 --> 32:39.960]  We are now number nine in the world.

[32:53.960 --> 32:56.960]  Hit the great reset in the war for the world now, it's going to go to number one.
[32:56.960 --> 33:00.960]  What do you make of that?
[33:00.960 --> 33:14.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.960 --> 33:18.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, Robert Barnes guest hosting.
[33:18.960 --> 33:25.960]  We're discussing big tech collusion as part of the deep state desire to control populations and direct its agenda.
[33:25.960 --> 33:31.960]  We'll be talking about a little bit later what the deep state may be up to next against Trump and Trump supporters,
[33:31.960 --> 33:38.960]  or globally as its despairing attempts to seize and continue to control and maintain and sustain power
[33:38.960 --> 33:45.960]  against its continuing debacles in the court of public opinion happen on an unabated level.
[33:45.960 --> 33:50.960]  Will they allow a Donald John Trump to be president once again in 2025?
[33:50.960 --> 33:55.960]  What might they be up to that could preclude or prevent that or try to preclude or prevent that?
[33:55.960 --> 34:03.960]  What risk does the president face from assassination itself as raised recently by the former New York City police commissioner as a real risk for Trump?
[34:03.960 --> 34:06.960]  We'll discuss that more a little bit later in the show.
[34:06.960 --> 34:10.960]  But now back to big tech collusion with big government.
[34:10.960 --> 34:17.960]  What the Louisiana and Missouri lawsuits have detailed is that the scale and scope of big tech collusion
[34:17.960 --> 34:25.960]  was far beyond what was even initially suspected or even alleged by some of the suits that were currently present,
[34:25.960 --> 34:30.960]  including Robert Kennedy's suit against Facebook for their efforts to target children's health defense
[34:30.960 --> 34:34.960]  and he personally for raising distant information about COVID-19.
[34:34.960 --> 34:38.960]  Well, it turns out almost every agency was complicit.
[34:38.960 --> 34:45.960]  The effort to create that national directory that ultimately had to be scrapped at the last minute after it was publicly exposed
[34:45.960 --> 34:51.960]  was due to how broad and big this effort is, how coordinated and organized it is,
[34:51.960 --> 34:55.960]  how much of it was happening under the president's own nose, President Trump,
[34:55.960 --> 35:02.960]  and now of course done with the willing assistance, the aiding and abetting of the Biden administration deliberately and directly.
[35:02.960 --> 35:07.960]  This includes the FBI, the CIA, the human health and services department,
[35:07.960 --> 35:10.960]  every major cabinet department of education.
[35:10.960 --> 35:12.960]  If there's a cabinet department, it's involved.
[35:12.960 --> 35:14.960]  If there's a federal agency, it's involved.
[35:14.960 --> 35:17.960]  If there's a law enforcement agency, it's involved.
[35:17.960 --> 35:19.960]  If there's an investigation agency, it's involved.
[35:19.960 --> 35:21.960]  Parts of the justice department involved.
[35:21.960 --> 35:30.960]  A whole bunch of people whose sole and whole objective was to prevent and preclude the public from finding out the truth about COVID-19.
[35:30.960 --> 35:37.960]  So the people finding out the truth about the 2020 election, from people finding out the truth about what was happening in Ukraine.
[35:37.960 --> 35:40.960]  The topic changes, but the methodology doesn't.
[35:40.960 --> 35:46.960]  And what the details show, in fact, this is the real reason, by the way, people had asked,
[35:46.960 --> 35:59.960]  why did Zuckerberg tell Joe Rogan and admit that the FBI was the one who directed him to suppress information concerning the Hunter Biden laptop story in 2020?
[35:59.960 --> 36:07.960]  Many people had justifiable suspicions of Zuckerberg, given the history of targeting children's health defense and Robert Kennedy on COVID issues,
[36:07.960 --> 36:14.960]  and other aspects that now apparently he is also going to blame that on being directed to do so by Fauci.
[36:14.960 --> 36:18.960]  So why is he suddenly throwing other people under the bus?
[36:18.960 --> 36:24.960]  Is this just a last minute gas to save himself from his illicit actions to influence the 2020 election?
[36:24.960 --> 36:32.960]  Given the huge amounts of money his foundations flooded Wisconsin and other states in order to create this wave,
[36:32.960 --> 36:37.960]  the sea of mail-in ballots that were not constitutionally qualified ballots,
[36:37.960 --> 36:40.960]  often by people who are not even constitutionally qualified to vote,
[36:40.960 --> 36:46.960]  in a method that was not constitutionally qualified in how it was cast and how it was counted and how it was envious,
[36:46.960 --> 36:49.960]  or who it was that casted in the first place?
[36:49.960 --> 36:57.960]  Well, the reason is because Zuckerberg was afraid that the embarrassing information coming out now from the civil lawsuit
[36:57.960 --> 37:05.960]  brought by the states of Missouri and Louisiana and joined by several high-profile members of the Great Barrington Declaration
[37:05.960 --> 37:13.960]  was going to come out, and he wanted to get ahead of the story by looking like he was volunteering the information to Joe Rogan
[37:13.960 --> 37:17.960]  to be able to jump a story that was going to come out anyway.
[37:17.960 --> 37:24.960]  The real reason Zuckerberg disclosed it is because this great lawsuit is disclosing from the discovery
[37:24.960 --> 37:32.960]  the scale and scope to which Big Tech has basically been at the back-and-call of the government and the deep state
[37:32.960 --> 37:35.960]  now for several years in the censorship game.
[37:35.960 --> 37:43.960]  In fact, this goes back even further, but it just accelerated in 2019, 2020, 2021, and now 2022.
[37:43.960 --> 37:50.960]  So the scope of that Big Tech collusion is extraordinary. It will raise new issues about the ability for people to sue
[37:50.960 --> 37:57.960]  on the grounds that what is actually happening is that Facebook, Google, YouTube as part of Google, Twitter,
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.960]  that all of these organizations are acting as agents of the federal government.
[38:02.960 --> 38:10.960]  And to the degree that they are, then they are as subject to the Constitution's rules and restrictions as anybody else.
[38:10.960 --> 38:14.960]  This goes back to the old company town principle.
[38:14.960 --> 38:19.960]  The United States Supreme Court said if a company set up a town and controlled the public streets and the public squares
[38:19.960 --> 38:26.960]  and the public parks and the public places, then they were bound by the same constitutional limitations
[38:26.960 --> 38:33.960]  as any government agency, even though private, the company was in the town itself, was in private hands.
[38:33.960 --> 38:42.960]  So if they are acting as the agent of the government, then a lot more people can seek legal remedy and relief against them
[38:42.960 --> 38:48.960]  and to try to stop them from doing it because the government cannot achieve indirectly what the Constitution precludes
[38:48.960 --> 38:51.960]  and prohibits it from getting directly.
[38:51.960 --> 38:59.960]  Indeed, in this context, this is part of the issues that are related to the Elon Musk Twitter fight that is currently occurring
[38:59.960 --> 39:08.960]  in a court in Delaware where an expert witness is saying that up to 80% of Twitter's traffic is actually driven by bots.
[39:08.960 --> 39:14.960]  This is also, again, part of the same censorship package because there's two ways to censor.
[39:14.960 --> 39:20.960]  One way to censor is to remove the poster or remove the post, remove the content or remove the content creator.
[39:20.960 --> 39:27.960]  But the other way to censor is actually more effective as Robert Epstein and others have detailed,
[39:27.960 --> 39:34.960]  which is that you create a fake story and you push that fake story and you pretend that fake story is popular.
[39:34.960 --> 39:41.960]  So it's the big lie that is often one of the most effective means of censoring stories by promoting the opposite of the truth
[39:41.960 --> 39:49.960]  while you bury the truth through various algorithmic manipulations which critically depend upon a lot of bots.
[39:49.960 --> 39:55.960]  The more bots there are, the more they're able to get a certain message out, the more they're able to promote that message.
[39:55.960 --> 40:02.960]  So the assumption has been that Twitter was lying about its bot presence because it was lying to advertisers saying,
[40:02.960 --> 40:06.960]  hey, if you spend a dollar, you'll reach, say, a thousand people.
[40:06.960 --> 40:11.960]  And it turns out, no, you actually reach, you know, 800 bots and 200 people.
[40:11.960 --> 40:15.960]  Well, in fact, while that may have been their monetary incentive for it,
[40:15.960 --> 40:23.960]  it appears given this discovery information about the collusion data that the more likely explanation or at least an equally powerful explanation
[40:23.960 --> 40:28.960]  is that it helped facilitate the deep state's agenda in manipulating the narrative across the world.
[40:28.960 --> 40:32.960]  The old programs like Operation Mockingbird had sort of faded.
[40:32.960 --> 40:40.960]  The internet could break through their ability to limit and constrain the people's ability to find independent information,
[40:40.960 --> 40:46.960]  to speak their own mind and to share their own perspective was at an extraordinary level.
[40:46.960 --> 40:56.960]  And so they needed to use the people who had such disparate monopoly power over these social media platforms to act as their gatekeeper
[40:56.960 --> 41:05.960]  and to act as their gatekeeper, not only in censoring dissident information, but in promoting information they knew was often false or inaccurate
[41:05.960 --> 41:12.960]  in order to be able to buttress the institutional narrative like we saw throughout the election fornication issues,
[41:12.960 --> 41:18.960]  like we saw throughout COVID and the lockdowns, like we've seen throughout the vaccine mandate issues,
[41:18.960 --> 41:23.960]  as Peter McCullough talking to Alex yesterday detailed in great detail.
[41:23.960 --> 41:32.960]  Robert Malone has also done as well in many others that all of this dissident information was not just excluded from the court of public opinion,
[41:32.960 --> 41:38.960]  but certain people within the public square were given louder microphones and bigger platforms than everybody else,
[41:38.960 --> 41:44.960]  but it didn't come from the people. They made it look like it came from the people, but it was illusory.
[41:44.960 --> 41:47.960]  It was like the matrix. It was like being inside the system.
[41:47.960 --> 41:53.960]  What it is is they use the bots to make somebody look much more popular than they actually were,
[41:53.960 --> 41:58.960]  to make a certain message look much more popular than it actually was,
[41:58.960 --> 42:03.960]  just as they were suppressing the indigenous organic popularity of other components.
[42:03.960 --> 42:11.960]  To give just one recent illustration this week, taglines like red sermon in reference to Biden's horrific authoritarian speech,
[42:11.960 --> 42:17.960]  or talking about the nature of Biden's relationship,
[42:17.960 --> 42:23.960]  Peter Biden and various versions of that as well, were both organically trending on Twitter,
[42:23.960 --> 42:28.960]  but they were arbitrarily and artificially suppressed while other topics were artificially inflated,
[42:28.960 --> 42:33.960]  but they need not only algorithmic manipulation, they need fake bots to achieve it and attain it.
[42:33.960 --> 42:38.960]  That's what the big tech is in operative of the deep state always has been,
[42:38.960 --> 42:45.960]  but now we may be getting enough factual details through Musk's suit and these other suits to expose it and unwind it for good.
[42:45.960 --> 42:48.960]  When we come back, we'll be discussing a range of topics,
[42:48.960 --> 42:57.960]  but including what the deep state's agenda may be up next for Trump, for MAGA, for America in desperate times from their perspective.
[42:57.960 --> 43:04.960]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system,
[43:04.960 --> 43:07.960]  for your brain, for every part of your body,
[43:07.960 --> 43:15.960]  but what I don't see being promoted is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects.
[43:15.960 --> 43:17.960]  It certainly does for me.
[43:17.960 --> 43:23.960]  When I take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[43:23.960 --> 43:29.960]  Now there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain,
[43:29.960 --> 43:32.960]  but I want you to experience it yourself.
[43:32.960 --> 43:35.960]  We know it's good for your heart, we know it's good for your brain,

[45:42.960 --> 45:46.960]  It keeps us on the air and it's going to sell out quick, but despite that,

[45:55.960 --> 45:58.960]  and for new folks to take advantage of it.
[45:58.960 --> 46:05.960]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S. that supplies the highest quality signature
[46:05.960 --> 46:09.960]  reducing faraday cages, the Pentagon and other U.S. government agencies.
[46:09.960 --> 46:17.960]  And now they have produced specifically for us this Made in America onion line at a very affordable price,
[46:17.960 --> 46:23.960]  whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone or big pouches that protect laptops and iPads
[46:23.960 --> 46:28.960]  or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want to put in like desktop computers.
[46:28.960 --> 46:35.960]  It is all exclusively available at InfoWarsTour.com under the Redux name.
[46:35.960 --> 46:41.960]  Redux is InfoWars taking the highest quality products and bringing them directly to you at InfoWarsTour.com.
[46:41.960 --> 46:47.960]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity,
[46:47.960 --> 46:51.960]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[46:51.960 --> 47:07.960]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at InfoWarsTour.com.
[47:39.960 --> 47:43.960]  But first up, talking about big tech collusion and its various constituent components,
[47:43.960 --> 47:48.960]  another example of what big tech is up to showed up in Colorado this past week.
[47:48.960 --> 47:55.960]  As various thermostats were taken over by the power company through its digital control over those thermostats
[47:55.960 --> 48:01.960]  in order to dictate what temperature people could find acceptable and would be okay for the big companies.
[48:01.960 --> 48:09.960]  And now take that capability and combine it and it becomes like one of the more recent last version of the X file season
[48:09.960 --> 48:16.960]  that new season they did a few years ago that had a few episodes in it or a black mirror episode from the Netflix series
[48:16.960 --> 48:22.960]  where what happens in the X file show is that they go, everything is automated.
[48:22.960 --> 48:27.960]  And so they go to a sushi shop where everything is automated and they give a bad review.
[48:27.960 --> 48:32.960]  And because they give a bad review, there's a complete attack on everything concerning them,
[48:32.960 --> 48:39.960]  their ability to get into the automated car to their ability, the automated vacuum that works in their home,
[48:39.960 --> 48:43.960]  the automated security system, the automated weather temperature system.
[48:43.960 --> 48:47.960]  Basically it's 2001 space Odyssey brought to your everyday life.
[48:47.960 --> 48:53.960]  So if they can do that in Colorado where they can just dictate what temperature is now acceptable for your home,
[48:53.960 --> 48:55.960]  imagine what else they can do.
[48:55.960 --> 49:03.960]  The more they have complete digital control where you have a real grid like the cinematic style real grid,
[49:03.960 --> 49:08.960]  then what you're going to have is you're going to be subject to their complete control.
[49:08.960 --> 49:10.960]  That's what a large part of big tech is about.
[49:10.960 --> 49:16.960]  It's about control, controlling information, controlling your activities, controlling your ability to function.
[49:16.960 --> 49:23.960]  That's what increasing talk this week of a central bank digital currency is all about.
[49:23.960 --> 49:30.960]  As people are aware, Biden has required that there be a study made of how quickly the US government itself
[49:30.960 --> 49:34.960]  could shift or transition to a central bank digital currency.
[49:34.960 --> 49:43.960]  We've been warning about this for several years going back to our interviews with George Gammon here on Infowars back during 2020.
[49:43.960 --> 49:45.960]  And we're seeing those escalate more and more talks.
[49:45.960 --> 49:53.960]  In fact, now the International Monetary Fund and other groups are talking about setting up a universal settlement process
[49:53.960 --> 50:00.960]  of recognizing financial transfers and property protocols through a uniform central mechanism.
[50:00.960 --> 50:06.960]  This would be a critical step to a global central bank digital currency.
[50:06.960 --> 50:13.960]  Now the only thing blowing back against them in this capacity is their complete failure at the economic war on Russia
[50:13.960 --> 50:16.960]  that has created troubles around the globe.
[50:16.960 --> 50:19.960]  It's unlikely most of the world will be interested in this.
[50:19.960 --> 50:28.960]  So the initial guinea pigs for the central bank digital currency operation will be those of us here in the United States and in the West.
[50:28.960 --> 50:36.960]  But it is likely coming because imagine if if you're complete access to funds, you no longer could have a means of exchange
[50:36.960 --> 50:43.960]  with just printed dollar bills, which have their own issue, or any other means of exchange through coins or your own choice of barter.
[50:43.960 --> 50:50.960]  But instead you had to use the government's digital currency on available only accessible available on your phone.
[50:50.960 --> 50:53.960]  Well, then you could be like those Chinese protesters recently.
[50:53.960 --> 50:59.960]  So the due to the Chinese real estate problems that go from the real estate bubble they created in China
[50:59.960 --> 51:04.960]  with the facilitation of local governments, developers, bankers and others,
[51:04.960 --> 51:12.960]  they diverted a lot of excess savings from the Chinese developing working in middle classes into excess housing
[51:12.960 --> 51:15.960]  and what was basically a big real estate bubble.
[51:15.960 --> 51:22.960]  As that bubble has begun to pop, it has had ramifications throughout the entire banking industry.
[51:22.960 --> 51:26.960]  The savings policies and then public protest have then followed.
[51:26.960 --> 51:33.960]  However, when somebody went out to try to protest at the bank, they were their means of getting on the train,
[51:33.960 --> 51:39.960]  their means of communicating, their means of even being legally outside without paper, so to speak, was revoked.
[51:39.960 --> 51:42.960]  On the grounds they now had a public health red label.
[51:42.960 --> 51:49.960]  This is the beginning stages of China's social credit system that is going to be exported here soon.
[51:49.960 --> 51:52.960]  That is the goal and objective of global digital currency.
[51:52.960 --> 51:57.960]  Because what it can do is it can prevent you from doing pretty much anything that requires money.
[51:57.960 --> 52:00.960]  And if you think about it, pretty much everything requires money,
[52:00.960 --> 52:06.960]  even the ability to pay for your internet service, your cable service, your phone service, your electric bill,
[52:06.960 --> 52:14.960]  your water bill, your housing bill, your car bill, your gas bill, your food bill, all the bills, all the costs.
[52:14.960 --> 52:16.960]  What happens if the government turns it off?
[52:16.960 --> 52:23.960]  It says, nope, can't do it this week, no food for you, no fuel for you, no water for you, no electric for you, you name it.
[52:23.960 --> 52:25.960]  It's the ultimate method and mechanism of control.
[52:25.960 --> 52:32.960]  And that's why they love the idea of global digital currencies and you're likely to see an expansion of it.
[52:32.960 --> 52:39.960]  But just as that is expanding in the power grab space, they're also moving in the censorship space.
[52:39.960 --> 52:48.960]  So this week, a website known as Kiwi Farms was targeted by Taylor Lorenz, the Washington Post defamer and libeler,
[52:48.960 --> 52:56.960]  who has gone after a range of politically inconvenient individuals at the behest or behalf of either the New York Times or the Washington Post,
[52:56.960 --> 53:02.960]  which has led to a range of suits against her, including one major one pending by Adriana Jacobs,
[53:02.960 --> 53:10.960]  who wasn't even political at all, just posed a threat to certain parts of the Hollywood industry at their ability to control upcoming talent,
[53:10.960 --> 53:13.960]  particularly social media influencer talent.
[53:13.960 --> 53:16.960]  She has now targeted the Kiwi Farm site.
[53:16.960 --> 53:22.960]  And this is because Kiwi Farms outed grooming activities by various trans individuals.
[53:22.960 --> 53:32.960]  And in fact, not only that, the lawyer who discussed this, Nick Raketa, people can find him online, Nick Raketa, Raketa Law,
[53:32.960 --> 53:36.960]  and had a debate with someone about it, also got another YouTube strike.
[53:36.960 --> 53:43.960]  The person who popularly broadcast the Kyle Rittenhouse trial and the Johnny Depp trial,
[53:43.960 --> 53:54.960]  exposing that a lot of woke agendas and media agendas in those cases were false and a lie, and exposed these activities of these various trans groomers.
[53:54.960 --> 53:57.960]  He too suffered a suspension attitude.
[53:57.960 --> 54:01.960]  But the cloud fair went in and took down Kiwi Farms altogether.
[54:01.960 --> 54:08.960]  This was another example where Info Wars was the canary in the coal mine.
[54:08.960 --> 54:13.960]  For those that don't remember, many years ago, several years ago, after the success of the Trump campaign,
[54:13.960 --> 54:16.960]  Alec Jones at Info Wars was target number one.
[54:16.960 --> 54:23.960]  And it wasn't just the law fair, they used the law fair as a means to de-platform Info Wars.
[54:23.960 --> 54:25.960]  And not only that, they went after everything.
[54:25.960 --> 54:27.960]  They went after payment processors.
[54:27.960 --> 54:30.960]  They went after online servers.
[54:30.960 --> 54:37.960]  They went after anybody who simply platformed, broadcast, published, or had any kind of financial transaction with Info Wars.
[54:37.960 --> 54:41.960]  Info Wars survived thanks to the audience, thanks to the people.
[54:41.960 --> 54:43.960]  It wasn't supposed to happen.
[54:43.960 --> 54:45.960]  Info Wars was supposed to be gone.
[54:45.960 --> 54:47.960]  Alec Jones was supposed to be gone.
[54:47.960 --> 54:53.960]  As Peter McCullough said yesterday in his interview with Alex, and as he talked about on social media today,
[54:53.960 --> 55:00.960]  it was great to be on Info Wars because it was great to be on a no censorship platform, a place that did not censor people.
[55:00.960 --> 55:07.960]  And that's why they were obsessed with taking Info Wars out because it was the primary source of independent information.
[55:07.960 --> 55:12.960]  But it failed because you, the people, refused to allow it to fail.
[55:12.960 --> 55:17.960]  This is in fact the key to any popular resistance anywhere in the history of man.
[55:17.960 --> 55:21.960]  It requires broad public support from key parts of the community.
[55:21.960 --> 55:23.960]  It doesn't require a majority.
[55:23.960 --> 55:27.960]  Half the country in any point in time is going to be uninformed.
[55:27.960 --> 55:34.960]  It just requires the informed and educated portion that's passionate about it to hold their ground.
[55:34.960 --> 55:37.960]  And that's what you at Info Wars have done.
[55:37.960 --> 55:38.960]  And how do you do that?
[55:38.960 --> 55:41.960]  You do that by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[55:41.960 --> 55:45.960]  You can go there right now and get a wide range of discounts.
[55:45.960 --> 55:50.960]  You can find something, the way I like to put it is, why do I go to InfoWarsStore.com?
[55:50.960 --> 55:53.960]  Why have I been purchasing products for many years there?
[55:53.960 --> 55:58.960]  Because it makes you healthier, wealthier, and wiser in one clean step.
[55:58.960 --> 56:09.960]  First of all, it makes you healthier because there's a bunch of products that Alex and his crew have personally vouched for, personally vetted, personally reviewed, personally used, and have great confidence in.
[56:09.960 --> 56:14.960]  And you can see that reaffirmed in the wide range of commenters who have reviewed on it over time.
[56:14.960 --> 56:21.960]  You can see it has some of the highest rates of approval, likability, and satisfaction you'll get of any products out there.
[56:21.960 --> 56:34.960]  So it makes you wealthier because these products are being offered at great discounts right now and at a substantial discount compared to many of the competitors for the same quality level of product.
[56:34.960 --> 56:38.960]  Sometimes people compare the product versus something that purports to be the alternative.
[56:38.960 --> 56:43.960]  But if you look at the ingredient list, you find it often is not an effective alternative.
[56:43.960 --> 56:52.960]  So you can get whether it's DNA force, fish oil, the other thing I always recommend is just go on there and see if there's something you can substitute your everyday life for.
[56:52.960 --> 56:57.960]  This is the part that makes you and everyone else wiser is keeps InfoWars online.
[56:57.960 --> 57:00.960]  And the value of that is your value.
[57:00.960 --> 57:04.960]  It's not only your value that you are contributing to others, but is a value that you receive.
[57:04.960 --> 57:13.960]  It is a reciprocal gift of sorts because you make yourself better educated because free speech is about the audience more than it's about the speaker.
[57:13.960 --> 57:17.960]  It's about the right to listen as much as it's about the right to talk.
[57:17.960 --> 57:26.960]  And you keep that alive for everybody by going to InfoWarsStore.com and just find something you already use that is an effective substitute right there.
[57:26.960 --> 57:34.960]  Or maybe it's something as simple as Alex Jones' new book, The Great Reset, simple, short, succinct to the point, well detailed, you can get it.
[57:34.960 --> 57:37.960]  Steve Bannon himself says one of the best books written, period.
[57:37.960 --> 57:48.960]  So you can get one of those, get a t-shirt, get something else, but go to InfoWarsStore.com now to continue to keep freedom and liberty alive in America by keeping information free and alive.
[57:48.960 --> 57:55.960]  The number one selling category in supplements worldwide is fat burners, is weight loss formulas.
[57:55.960 --> 58:02.960]  And listen, there are hundreds of them out there that work, but most of them do it in a toxic way.
[58:02.960 --> 58:18.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research on the safest, healthiest ways to take your overall body's metabolic system and your metabolism and turn that clock back by turning up your metabolism.
[58:18.960 --> 58:27.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, Diet Force does it in a clean, healthy way. It's amazing. I've almost lost 40 pounds the last three months just using the samples of it.

[1:00:03.960 --> 1:00:13.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. This is Robert Barnes' guest hosting. Today we're discussing a range of topics including what might be the next deep state tactics and techniques chosen
[1:00:13.960 --> 1:00:23.960]  to go after Trump and the MAGA movement in light of its slipping hold on power with its dementia candidate in the White House and its debacles and disasters both at home and overseas.
[1:00:23.960 --> 1:00:26.960]  We'll be discussing that a little bit later in the show.
[1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:34.960]  But to give you an example of why the deep state has to go to such great efforts from Operation Mockingbird Forward to suppress and censor independence,
[1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:40.960]  it's because these are just a small sampling of the kind of stories they just this week.
[1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:46.960]  For example, have you heard about the billionaire Eris Kidnap in Memphis? You've heard almost nothing about it.
[1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:50.960]  Something about that story is striking and unusual in its absence of coverage.
[1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:57.960]  Something is going on behind the scenes that's kind of like the shooting that occurred with Dutch Special Forces in Indianapolis.
[1:00:57.960 --> 1:01:02.960]  It's like what are Dutch Special Forces doing in a shootout in Indianapolis in the first place?
[1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:08.960]  The kind of story that warrants further digging. But it's not the kind the media these days tends to do.
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:20.960]  So another version of that is where is Gavin McInnis? Gavin McInnis, the co-founder of Vice, who later left it for a sort of more populist conservative path,
[1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:24.960]  went into the independent media space, the original founder of the Proud Boys.
[1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:32.960]  And once the Proud Boys got infiltrated by some rogue elements, he stepped down from it in order to protect its reputation
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:39.960]  and the good intentions of many of its constituent members, was broadcasting live when it appeared.
[1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:45.960]  It's unclear. Someone off script, someone off the setting, off the stage is interacting with it.
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:51.960]  It appears to be law enforcement and he disappeared and he hasn't been heard from since.
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:58.960]  And it's important to remember that Gavin McInnis, to my understanding, is a citizen of Canada and the UK, but is only on a green card here in the United States.
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:08.960]  And the US government, deep state operators have often taken the position that non-US citizens can be seized and get mowed or any version thereof.
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:17.960]  So where is he? And yet there's very little media interest and media curiosity and media coverage of these kind of extraordinary cases.
[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:25.960]  Another example was a Biden proposal that only got a little bit of coverage, which is, but I heard directly from potential whistleblowers about,
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:33.960]  Biden plans to convert America's VA clinics, Veterans Affairs clinics, places that are supposed to take care of veterans,
[1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:36.960]  but often have failed to adequately and competently do so.
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:44.960]  Going to convert them in his latest scheme, in his latest baby killing scheme, to convert it into an abortion center.
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:52.960]  So apparently what's going to happen is that the very nature of what is taking place in transpiring
[1:02:52.960 --> 1:03:00.960]  is that the federal government is trying to use any place it has power, whether that's offshore, whether that's on federal parks,
[1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:05.960]  whether that's in military facilities, whether that's through their control of Medicare and Medicaid funding,
[1:03:05.960 --> 1:03:13.960]  all of which they've tried to utilize to force and coerce abortions on unwilling medical care providers who don't want to do it,
[1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:20.960]  as they've already tried to do to various religious facilities in cases that they consistently lose, but keep trying anyway.
[1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:30.960]  Now they're going to try to turn Veterans Affairs facilities into abortion clinics in places where abortion is illegal under local and state law.
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:34.960]  This shows what many people warned about the usurping federal power.
[1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:40.960]  But speaking of questionable mechanisms of power, the local school system in Loudoun County, Virginia,
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:48.960]  attempted to try to basically cover up for its trans policies leading to sexual assaults in girls' bathrooms
[1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:54.960]  when a grand jury was formed to investigate this criminal behavior by the Virginia local schools.
[1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:58.960]  The Virginia local schools claim to be above the grand jury, to be beyond it.
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:00.960]  They can't be reached by the law.
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:07.960]  The Virginia Supreme Court said otherwise this week, said the school systems are no more exempted immune from grand jury investigations
[1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:09.960]  and inquiry than anybody else.
[1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:13.960]  What exactly are the schools so afraid of that they're hiding?
[1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:21.960]  Well, in the same capacity, it might be what we talked about BLM, if you go back to our videos years ago, about what BLM really was.
[1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:24.960]  It was not an authentic civil rights organization.
[1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:30.960]  It was a politically driven, motivated organization that was mostly run by for and of grifters.
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:34.960]  Indeed, it was founded literally by several witches, people who believe in witchcraft.
[1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:37.960]  This was not your Martin Luther King civil rights organization.
[1:04:37.960 --> 1:04:42.960]  Well, this week they're all suing each other because of all the different fraud that took place.
[1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:49.960]  If you need to read the name and relabel BLM, better laundering money is what they effectively are and were.
[1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:54.960]  We'll be talking about the deep state and more when we come back right after the break.
[1:04:54.960 --> 1:05:15.960]  Join us then.
[1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:36.960]  Just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the best with our supplements as well.
[1:05:36.960 --> 1:05:38.960]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:40.960]  Folks, this is a joke.
[1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:42.960]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:43.960]  It's 75% off.
[1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:44.960]  By the way, it works for me.
[1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:49.960]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:56.960]  Quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[1:05:56.960 --> 1:05:58.960]  I go and see him quite often now.
[1:05:58.960 --> 1:06:06.960]  Welcome back to The Alice Jones Show.
[1:06:06.960 --> 1:06:08.960]  This is Robert Barnes, guest host.
[1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:11.960]  Discussed a little bit later, what are the deep state's next steps?
[1:06:11.960 --> 1:06:15.960]  What are they going to be up to now that various efforts have failed?
[1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:19.960]  What was their original script? How has reality deviated from that script?
[1:06:19.960 --> 1:06:21.960]  Can they continue to cover up?
[1:06:21.960 --> 1:06:26.960]  Can they continue to engage in dangerous corrupt behavior towards President Trump?
[1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:28.960]  Could they remove him from the ballot?
[1:06:28.960 --> 1:06:30.960]  Could they take him out through other ways?
[1:06:30.960 --> 1:06:33.960]  We'll be discussing that and more a little bit later in the show.
[1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:40.960]  But as to the issue of abortion, one of the popular talking points by no less than the Ben Shapiro's of the world
[1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:46.960]  was that, who is one of the worst political prognosticators, maybe in American political history,
[1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:55.960]  was that the Dobs decision, overturning and reversing Roe, would be and was going to be politically, at least short term,
[1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:57.960]  very damaging to the Republican cause.
[1:06:57.960 --> 1:07:01.960]  This has been the institutional narrative repeated all the way throughout.
[1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:06.960]  The prediction was that this would show up in primary turnout participation rates,
[1:07:06.960 --> 1:07:12.960]  that this would show up in voter registration rates, and it would show up in public opinion polling,
[1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:18.960]  even though the last, of course, is often manipulated by the media at their will and at their best.
[1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:26.960]  So the two most objective metrics and measurements we have for testing whether or not there is really this mass demand
[1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:32.960]  for abortion on demand in America, that there's this mass desire to support baby killing,
[1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:38.960]  that there's mass requirement that this be a nationally decided issue and not a locally decided issue,
[1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:46.960]  got tested and it got tested in a range of primaries and it got tested again in a range of voter registration file.
[1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:52.960]  So now we've had all of July, all of August, to see what happened.
[1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:59.960]  We've had plenty of primaries across the country in geographically diverse regions in various competitive primary election contexts.
[1:07:59.960 --> 1:08:04.960]  We've also had a range of voter registration activity now going on for months.
[1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:06.960]  And what does that data show?
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:11.960]  Well, the data shows what Richard Barris, known as People's Pundit Daily,
[1:08:11.960 --> 1:08:16.960]  or you can find his polling at Big Data or at peoplespundit.locals.com,
[1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:21.960]  who has new data from Pennsylvania up today at his People's Pundit site.
[1:08:21.960 --> 1:08:24.960]  What we predicted is what has in fact come true.
[1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:30.960]  Voter registration trends over the last two months continue to shift dramatically in Republicans' favor.
[1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:38.960]  There was no huge, role-loving perspective out there that was going to lead to a surge of voter registration and it did not.
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:45.960]  In fact, this includes even states like New Jersey, where Republicans picked up net votes that wasn't supposed to happen.
[1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:49.960]  Similarly, what happened in voter primary participation areas?
[1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:57.960]  Well, Democratic voter participation rate prior to the DOBS decision had been down on average around 7% from 2018,
[1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:02.960]  while Republican voter participation rates were generally up.
[1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:04.960]  Well, what happened after DOBS?
[1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:11.960]  Democratic relative voter participation rates in the primaries continue to decline at the same rate over the 2018 level.
[1:09:11.960 --> 1:09:20.960]  Indeed, it was only because there was some lower Republican turnout in some states where Republicans were unhappy with their options, particularly some populist Republican voters,
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:23.960]  that saw a slight dip in Republican turnout.
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:26.960]  But there was no Democratic voter turnout surge.
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:28.960]  So there was no voter turnout surge.
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:30.960]  There was no voter registration surge.
[1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:33.960]  The myth that these things are popular with people is wrong.
[1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:39.960]  And as Richard Barris of People's Pundit reporting, Republicans are back up in the generic congressional vote.
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:47.960]  And in fact, if you want my breakdown of the various House and Senate races out there, the summary and summation is this.
[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:50.960]  Republicans will win the governorship of Pennsylvania.
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:53.960]  Republicans will win the governorship of Wisconsin.
[1:09:53.960 --> 1:10:00.960]  The Republicans may win the governorship of Michigan, even though that will be closer and more competitive.
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:03.960]  Republicans will win the governorship of Arizona.
[1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:06.960]  Republicans will win the Senate seat in Pennsylvania.
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:10.960]  Republicans will win the Senate seat in Wisconsin.
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:13.960]  Republicans will win the Senate seat in Arizona.
[1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:16.960]  Republicans will win the Senate seat in Georgia.
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:19.960]  Republicans will win the Senate seat in Ohio.
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:27.960]  And Republicans might steal a seat, as some polls showed this week, either in a place like Washington or a state like New Hampshire.
[1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:30.960]  By no means are they out of the game.
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:34.960]  Either way, my conclusion is that come January 2023,
[1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:39.960]  you're going to see more than 250 members of the House of Representatives are Republicans.
[1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:45.960]  And you're going to see the highest number of MAGA populist Republicans you have ever witnessed,
[1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:49.960]  thanks in part due to the Biden-Red sermon speech of this past week.
[1:10:49.960 --> 1:10:54.960]  And you're going to see 53 or more Republicans in the United States Senate,
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:59.960]  which will have some of the strongest populist voices on a range of topics, including
[1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:04.960]  Blake Masters, including JD Vance, including Eric Schmidt,
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:11.960]  including Josh Hawley and others who may discover their populist voice with Rand Paul on a range of topics,
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:17.960]  as they see that populism is the direction of the Republican Party in the country.
[1:11:17.960 --> 1:11:20.960]  And there's nothing the deep state can do about it,
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:25.960]  besides trying to do what they are doing, which is mostly backfiring.
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:30.960]  In that same capacity, there was some confusion this week about what happened in Alaska.
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:36.960]  The discussion was, well, maybe Alaska shows that the abortion issues cutting against Republicans,
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:40.960]  maybe it's showing that the Trump issues are cutting against Republicans.
[1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:43.960]  Indeed, that's what Ben Shapiro was out saying.
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:46.960]  He was saying the Republican Party needs to abandon Donald Trump,
[1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:49.960]  needs to abandon populism, abandon MAGA,
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:53.960]  need to just focus on Biden and say negative things about Biden.
[1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:59.960]  Be the party of just opposition, not the party of substantive positive policies and proposals.
[1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:05.960]  That is exactly how Republicans could lose their opportunities to seize big margins in the House of Representatives
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:08.960]  and get back control, majority control of the Senate,
[1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:12.960]  and get key territorial control of the competitive state.
[1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:16.960]  And for those folks out there that undervalue what that means,
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:19.960]  I mean, Arizona and Georgia have already passed election reforms.
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:24.960]  Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have not passed the same kind of election reforms
[1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:27.960]  because they have Democratic governors blocking them.
[1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:30.960]  We need Republican governors in those states.
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:36.960]  Two of the three, for sure, ideally all three, and I think Republicans can run the trifecta.
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:39.960]  The only way they don't is if they run away from Donald Trump.
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:44.960]  The only way they don't is if they abandon criticism of the Justice Department
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:49.960]  of this administration politically weaponizing it to go after its dissidents
[1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:54.960]  as the deep state has used it as a tool to attack anyone that is part of its opposition.
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:56.960]  That's the only way they could fail in that respect.
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:03.960]  What happened in Alaska has nothing to do with either Trump or with abortion.
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:09.960]  It has everything to do with the unique election system there and Republicans handling of it.
[1:13:09.960 --> 1:13:17.960]  So Senator Lisa Murkowski knew she could not win reelection if she had to go through a Republican primary process.
[1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:21.960]  She didn't want to run as an independent again as she had in the past.
[1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:28.960]  So she helped facilitate the change in Alaska's election laws to do something called rank choice voting,
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:31.960]  or sometimes called an instant runoff.
[1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:39.960]  The idea of an instant runoff is that the election should come down to just the top two candidates,
[1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:43.960]  but that you should have a choice of other candidates prior to that.
[1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:51.960]  And so with rank choice voting, you go into the election booth and you get basically as many votes as you have candidate,
[1:13:51.960 --> 1:13:54.960]  but you have to rank those votes.
[1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:59.960]  So your first favorite, your number one favorite, you put a one by or depends on the jurisdiction,
[1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:05.960]  this is the principle, number two by your second favorite, third by your third favorite, so on and so forth.
[1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:13.960]  As the ballots happen, once somebody's not in the top two, they're like, let's say somebody with somebody's number one choice,
[1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:22.960]  but they finish third, then their voters number two choice gets cast instead if it was for one of the other two leading candidate.
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:27.960]  And that keeps going on and on and on throughout the process, creating a little bit of mathematical complexity,
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:31.960]  but nothing too difficult for ordinary voters to understand.
[1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:37.960]  However, a lot of institutional Republicans oppose the idea of rank choice voting in general.
[1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:42.960]  Now, I can tell you in theory, rank choice voting actually can help reformers and outsiders,
[1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:50.960]  because it allows people to get to vote for who they actually like as their favorite candidate without wasting the vote.
[1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:55.960]  Because if their favorite candidate isn't in the top two, they get to then vote for their second favorite candidate.
[1:14:55.960 --> 1:15:01.960]  They don't have to always vote for the lesser of two evils, so it was not too difficult a process.
[1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:04.960]  However, the institutional Republican Party doesn't like that.
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:10.960]  They want rank choice voting for Lisa Murkowski, but they don't want it for everybody else.
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:18.960]  And so what they did is they encouraged local Republicans to not be well educated on how to simply execute a rank choice ballot.
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:25.960]  Now, Sarah Palin didn't help herself by having a bunch of Washington insiders run her campaign, and consequently,
[1:15:25.960 --> 1:15:29.960]  and a bunch of institutional political class types ran her campaign.
[1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:33.960]  But what happened is even though 60% of people in Alaska voted for Republicans,
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:37.960]  many of those 60% didn't have a second favorite after Sarah Palin,
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:44.960]  and consequently, Palin didn't get those second ballots of other Republican candidates, and that's the only reason she lost.
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:48.960]  So it was simply Republican miseducation on rank choice voting.
[1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:51.960]  It has nothing to do with the fundamental election dynamics.
[1:15:51.960 --> 1:15:56.960]  When we come back, we'll talk about what threats the deep state may face, and they may pose to us.
[1:15:56.960 --> 1:16:03.960]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:07.960]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[1:16:07.960 --> 1:16:10.960]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:15.960]  You might not agree with everything, you might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:18.960]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:19.960]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[1:16:19.960 --> 1:16:24.960]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, Infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks,

[1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:39.960]  Folks, this is a joke.
[1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:42.960]  I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75% off.
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:43.960]  By the way, it works for me.
[1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:48.960]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:50.960]  Quite well, I might add.
[1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:54.960]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[1:16:54.960 --> 1:16:56.960]  I go and see them quite often now.

[1:18:14.960 --> 1:18:16.960]  It certainly does for me.
[1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:21.960]  When I take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing.

[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:29.960]  But first let's talk about the verdict is in on COVID.
[1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:33.960]  When many of us were challenging and questioning and contesting the institutional narrative
[1:20:33.960 --> 1:20:37.960]  all the way back in March of 2020, we were often alone.
[1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:40.960]  Many of you out there felt it and experienced it yourself,
[1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:45.960]  called conspiracy theorists, called nuts, called crazies,
[1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:48.960]  called anti-science, anti-doctor.
[1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:52.960]  The story was that COVID presented a unique and extraordinary
[1:20:52.960 --> 1:20:57.960]  and maybe even existential threat to people around the world
[1:20:57.960 --> 1:21:02.960]  at a unique and unusual plague-like level that required reactions and responses
[1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:05.960]  in public policy health interventions, as they're called,
[1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:08.960]  in ways that we didn't even do during the plague.
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:12.960]  And some of us at the time said that COVID did not present that degree of threat
[1:21:12.960 --> 1:21:14.960]  to most healthy people.
[1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:18.960]  Number one, number two, that the methods being chosen
[1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:22.960]  as public health interventions had no history of being successful
[1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:26.960]  and were as likely to backfire and cause more problems than they were good.
[1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:30.960]  Third, that our assertion was that any risk-benefit analysis,
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:34.960]  even if you believe there was a benefit from these public health interventions
[1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:37.960]  and even if you believe the risk was severe from COVID,
[1:21:37.960 --> 1:21:41.960]  that if you compared it to the other collateral consequences
[1:21:41.960 --> 1:21:45.960]  of these public health interventions, shutting down economies,
[1:21:45.960 --> 1:21:48.960]  shutting down societies, shutting down schools,
[1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:50.960]  shutting down people's individual autonomy,
[1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:55.960]  putting people under mass house arrest for days, then weeks, then months,
[1:21:55.960 --> 1:21:57.960]  then years in some cases,
[1:21:57.960 --> 1:22:00.960]  that this would have net negative effect on human development
[1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:05.960]  and human happiness in ways that would be felt in measurable metrics down the road.
[1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:07.960]  What was our prediction?
[1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:13.960]  Our prediction was you would see school test scores and childhood satisfaction decline.
[1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:16.960]  Our prediction was that you would see addiction rise
[1:22:16.960 --> 1:22:20.960]  and that would show up in both treatment and health consequences,
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:25.960]  medical cost and in deaths, including overdose drugs,
[1:22:25.960 --> 1:22:27.960]  overdose deaths for drugs and alcoholism,
[1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:30.960]  that you would see child abuse charges rise,
[1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:35.960]  that you would hear issues of all kinds of violent conflict increase
[1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:38.960]  both within the home and ultimately outside the home
[1:22:38.960 --> 1:22:41.960]  when people were finally released from their home prisons.
[1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:45.960]  We said that in fact you would find out that COVID did not present
[1:22:45.960 --> 1:22:49.960]  much imminent great risk to most people of any degree necessary
[1:22:49.960 --> 1:22:52.960]  that could even plausibly justify this.
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:54.960]  And we said the various public health interventions,
[1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:57.960]  things like masks, things like lockdowns,
[1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:00.960]  things like prohibitions on public travel,
[1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:02.960]  things like shutting down schools,
[1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:07.960]  like having a bunch of plastic everywhere for kids to try to go to class in
[1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:11.960]  or for people to just interact or interface in a wide range of public settings.
[1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:15.960]  Our prediction was that all of these things would not result
[1:23:15.960 --> 1:23:18.960]  in actual successful reduction of COVID
[1:23:18.960 --> 1:23:21.960]  and would definitely and would have negative consequences.
[1:23:21.960 --> 1:23:26.960]  We also said that the vaccines would not produce the public health benefit
[1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:31.960]  and why were Alex and I and just a few others at the time saying this from the very get go.
[1:23:31.960 --> 1:23:33.960]  It is because we knew the history.
[1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:36.960]  We knew the history of public health issues and pandemics.
[1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:40.960]  We knew the history of what worked and did not work in response to those pandemics.
[1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:44.960]  We knew the ulterior agenda of the statist and the globalist
[1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:48.960]  and those who wanted to use this to restructure society as Klaus Schwab
[1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:52.960]  but ultimately publicly and openly admit and acknowledge
[1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:55.960]  saying it was a great opportunity, the pandemic,
[1:23:55.960 --> 1:23:59.960]  to restructure society for his great reset agenda
[1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:03.960]  that has been particularly, particularly by the Bill Gates and George Soros
[1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:06.960]  and the Rockefellers of the world.
[1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:11.960]  But it was also a reflection that nobody had done even the basic testing.
[1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:14.960]  It wasn't just a criticism of the content of what was being proposed.
[1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:19.960]  It was a criticism of the methodology and the process of what was being proposed.
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:26.960]  In other words, they didn't show any signs that they had ever even done a cost benefit analysis.
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:30.960]  And what have we seen over the last several weeks?
[1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:31.960]  Three things.
[1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:36.960]  First, in Canada, it has publicly come out that they never did a cost benefit analysis.
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:41.960]  Just like it was discovered in the lockdown suits that happened with Judge Stickman early on
[1:24:41.960 --> 1:24:45.960]  in the Western District of Pennsylvania that exposed the Pennsylvania government agencies
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:48.960]  weren't even doing a risk benefit analysis.
[1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:50.960]  Is this going to be better or worse?
[1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:52.960]  Because take, for example, the vaccine.
[1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:58.960]  One of the reasons for our criticism was that there had never been a successful vaccine
[1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:00.960]  in the history of coronavirus.
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:01.960]  Why?
[1:25:01.960 --> 1:25:03.960]  Because the virus mutates too quickly.
[1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:08.960]  In order to survive, it has to become less lethal and more transmissible.
[1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:12.960]  And in the process, it's the reason why flu shots often don't work.
[1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:17.960]  It transitions too quickly and what you vaccinate against is no longer the disease.
[1:25:17.960 --> 1:25:20.960]  So the second thing was we just looked at the data.
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:25.960]  We're trying to take an mRNA technology that had never been used before and use it on a
[1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:26.960]  mass scale.
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:31.960]  With mRNA technology, there was a reason it had not been used before.
[1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:33.960]  Major safety concerns.
[1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:38.960]  Then you could just look at how quickly everything was done and you could fairly infer that they
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:41.960]  had not had adequate studies in order to be able to assess.
[1:25:41.960 --> 1:25:46.960]  And if you knew how the FDA really worked in delegating this to big drug companies and
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:51.960]  the drug companies have special immunity, like you do in the public health context under the
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:56.960]  PREP Act, like you do if you're put on a childhoods vaccination list, like you do if you just
[1:25:56.960 --> 1:26:01.960]  relabel your drug vaccine, all of which the FDA helped facilitate and enable, then the
[1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:06.960]  net effect of it is you're going to have a drug that is uniquely dangerous because the
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:10.960]  drug companies' only skin in the game is to enrich themselves and empower themselves.
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:16.960]  So what have we seen in just the last month, just the last week of information?
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:21.960]  Canada did no cost-benefit analysis of all at all for its various vaccine mandates and
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:22.960]  travel bans.
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:25.960]  Coming out of Europe, similar information and data.
[1:26:25.960 --> 1:26:28.960]  Coming out from various U.S. governmental sources, the same thing.
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:32.960]  No risk-benefit analysis was ever even done.
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:37.960]  The United Kingdom, it's being exposed in great detail that all of their lockdown policies,
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:41.960]  whether it was schools, whether it was masks, whether it was vaccines, whether it was the
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:45.960]  economy, whether it was travel, whether it was just being outside of your home, whether
[1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:49.960]  it be indoors or outdoors, whether you could go to a game, all of these things, there was
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:53.960]  no risk-benefit analysis ever even done.
[1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:54.960]  This wasn't science.
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:57.960]  This was politics masquerading as math.
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:03.960]  This was politics masquerading as science, which if you knew how the globalists operate
[1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:08.960]  and you knew how status operate and you knew how governments tend to operate, then you
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:11.960]  could predict and preview this was exactly what was going to happen.
[1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:18.960]  You didn't have to do a separate deep dive into the toxicology of vaccines or the nature
[1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:22.960]  of COVID as a disease or the political and public history of pandemics.
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:25.960]  All you had to know was their methods was bad or bad.
[1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:29.960]  If your way of reasoning is bad, then the outcome is likely to be bad.
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:34.960]  We're now finding that all of us that were called crackpots and criticized by every name
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:36.960]  possible, we were right.
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:38.960]  They were wrong.
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:44.960]  The horrifying thing is I would much rather have been wrong because being right means
[1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:46.960]  a lot of people died who didn't need to die.
[1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:51.960]  A lot of businesses were crushed and killed that didn't need to be crushed and killed.
[1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:54.960]  That's why it's important to continue the fight back.
[1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:58.960]  Those who are continuing to do so on the front lines, on the medical context, the political
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:02.960]  context, the legal context, and every other context, and your context.
[1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:07.960]  You as an ordinary, everyday person, what was the number one voice exposing the dangers
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:08.960]  of what they were doing?
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:13.960]  What was the number one organizational source for protests that started around America and
[1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:15.960]  then traveled around the globe?
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:19.960]  What was the number one source for independent information, whether it was Pierre Corey,
[1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:23.960]  whether it was Dr. Malone, whether it was Peter McCollough, whether it was any of many others
[1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:25.960]  that were exposing what was going on?
[1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:27.960]  Who was the first person to tell you?
[1:28:27.960 --> 1:28:32.960]  What was the first network to tell you about Bill Gates and his special little convention
[1:28:32.960 --> 1:28:34.960]  on coronavirus just a few months before this leak?
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:36.960]  It was InfoWars.

[1:32:59.960 --> 1:33:12.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:12.960 --> 1:33:14.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:16.960]  This is Robert Barnes guest hosting.
[1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:21.960]  We've been talking about the various reasons why the deep state is in a desperate state
[1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:26.960]  and in the next segment we'll break down what some of their next steps might be and what
[1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:31.960]  their script or where their script has already gone AWOL in recent past.
[1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:34.960]  But let's just look at some of the headlines around the world.
[1:33:34.960 --> 1:33:39.960]  We have a labor market that continues to be unable and incapable of giving us back the
[1:33:39.960 --> 1:33:43.960]  same jobs we had just prior to the pandemic.
[1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:47.960]  Now you might have seen various unemployment reports and job reports and payroll reports
[1:33:47.960 --> 1:33:49.960]  that suggest otherwise.
[1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:54.960]  But what they're not telling you is the reason why the payroll is up is because people are
[1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:56.960]  taking more jobs.
[1:33:56.960 --> 1:34:01.960]  The payroll of jobs that were a one earner jobs have actually gone down.
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:06.960]  The best place to measure this is something called the labor force participation rate.
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:11.960]  You can also get a lot more honest data from a site called shadow stats.
[1:34:11.960 --> 1:34:16.960]  Shadow stats tracks the data using the same methods we used to use before we started
[1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:22.960]  politically manipulating them in such great lengths in the 1990s and 2000s before they
[1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:26.960]  will show you what the unemployment rate would look like if we use the same metric that we
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:27.960]  previously used.
[1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:30.960]  Same with inflation, same with money supply and other aspects.
[1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:34.960]  But here the labor force participation rate gives away the story.
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:39.960]  The labor force participation rate looks like the Obama years where it never just could
[1:34:39.960 --> 1:34:44.960]  never recover to its pre-global financial crisis of 2008 levels.
[1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:46.960]  We're seeing the same thing now.
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:52.960]  And not only that, what we're also seeing is dangerous signs in consumer sentiment, dangerous
[1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:55.960]  signs in the stock market and bond market.
[1:34:55.960 --> 1:34:59.960]  Bond market one of its worst years and decades.
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:02.960]  We're seeing increasing problems in the housing market.
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:08.960]  And the housing market matters because what has happened over the years since the 1990s
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:14.960]  but starting heavily in 2000 was people began to use the mere perception of the increased
[1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:18.960]  value of their home to spend more, to invest more.
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:20.960]  That in turn boosted the economy.
[1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:24.960]  When housing falls now, it's not just housing that goes down.
[1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:27.960]  It's not just your net worth that declined.
[1:35:27.960 --> 1:35:31.960]  What happens is people's spending habits substantially decline.
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:34.960]  And that becomes its own problem.
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:39.960]  And at the same time, while you have organizations like BlackRock buying up various residential
[1:35:39.960 --> 1:35:43.960]  homes in mass, you also have the evictions coming back online.
[1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:46.960]  All those moratoriums are gone, finally fading out.
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:50.960]  So you're going to have in the next several months, mass evictions taking place.
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:53.960]  You're going to see rents continue to rise.
[1:35:53.960 --> 1:35:58.960]  You're going to see housing values as finally the housing inventory continues to increase
[1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:03.960]  and the supply problem disappears while the prices continue to collapse.
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:09.960]  Which will be further enhanced by the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates that force
[1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:11.960]  the mortgage rates to go up.
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:15.960]  Indeed, mortgage rates, and you look at the ordinary mortgage, they've more than doubled
[1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:17.960]  in about five years.
[1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:21.960]  And wages haven't, ordinary incomes haven't.
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:25.960]  So that's a kind of economic reality that's going to create more problems.
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:31.960]  Then you compound that with many companies being unhappy with remote working and now trying to demand
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:37.960]  that all the people who got satisfied with remote working come back and work in person.
[1:36:37.960 --> 1:36:39.960]  Which will raise its own issues.
[1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:43.960]  Now some companies are doing that to cover up for the fact that they discriminated against people
[1:36:43.960 --> 1:36:47.960]  in mandating an unnecessary and dangerous vaccine that they take.
[1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:52.960]  But some of it is also their own corporate interest in preserving corporate real estate
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:58.960]  that they have various investments in financial and legal and political ties to.
[1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:02.960]  But some of it may be for legitimate independent economic reasons.
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:05.960]  But either way, what you're going to have is mass rebellion.
[1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:10.960]  Because a lot of people, first of all, they work from home that gives them a certain tax deduction
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:11.960]  that's available to them.
[1:37:11.960 --> 1:37:13.960]  And that might be important.
[1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:18.960]  Let's say you're one of those people that got your student loans forgiven by old Joe Biden,
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:19.960]  by Uncle Joe.
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:24.960]  What you may not know is that that's taxed as forgiveness of income.
[1:37:24.960 --> 1:37:29.960]  Because forgiveness of debt is taxed as ordinary income under most state tax law provisions.
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:34.960]  Consequently, and maybe even potentially under federal law provisions, depending on the circumstances.
[1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:39.960]  So a bunch of people who thought that they, who actually probably weren't in a position to pay back their tax anyway,
[1:37:39.960 --> 1:37:46.960]  now got to turn around and write a check for the privilege, who couldn't pay back their student loan debt anyway.
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:49.960]  Now they're going to have to pay tax that they weren't otherwise going to have to pay.
[1:37:49.960 --> 1:37:52.960]  So all of these issues economically accumulating.
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:56.960]  A low labor force participation rate.
[1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:02.960]  A housing collapse of the main form of wealth and main form of spending boost in the United States.
[1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:10.960]  A stock market decline that may in turn trigger a pension decline, which is another second mechanism and method
[1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:15.960]  by which people hold up their financial contributions to the economy and consumption and investment.
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:22.960]  Not least of which various tax obligations may rise as the various pensions decline and state governments
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:28.960]  have to make up the gap in what is not being provided for in their various pension plans.
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:31.960]  These are all aggregating in a negative cycle.
[1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:39.960]  A dangerous precarious perilous negative cycle that when you put it up against the energy crisis about to rock Europe.
[1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:43.960]  The food crisis about to rock the entire globe.
[1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:48.960]  You can see why the deep state is gibberish and nervous at the moment.
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:50.960]  They are facing unprecedented failure.
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:56.960]  Indeed, when people tell me the deep state must have a sophisticated and smart plan for all of this.
[1:38:56.960 --> 1:39:04.960]  I remind them of history that the in the particular most analogous time in history we face is World War right up to World War One.
[1:39:04.960 --> 1:39:12.960]  In building up to World War One, a bunch of empires thought they could easily and convincingly use martial and military means
[1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:15.960]  to finish their imperial conquest of the globe.
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:21.960]  This included the British Empire, which famously they said an empire where the sun never set.
[1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:23.960]  What do they mean by that?
[1:39:23.960 --> 1:39:27.960]  That they were present in some part of the world where the sun was still rising and up.
[1:39:27.960 --> 1:39:33.960]  So you had the British Empire, one of the most dominant empires in world history leading into World War One.
[1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:36.960]  The dominant pound, the dominant currency in the globe.
[1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:43.960]  You had aspects of the, you had the various, the rising German would be empire.
[1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:48.960]  You had the Austro, which was about a century and a half old that had managed to take out Napoleon.
[1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:56.960]  You had the Russian Empire, which in certain respects dated back over 10 centuries, but at least in just the same family over three centuries.
[1:39:56.960 --> 1:40:02.960]  You had the Ottoman Empire, which had taken over the Middle East in parts of Europe for centuries and centuries.
[1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:12.960]  And the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was so inbred that by that generation number 20 that their mouths could barely open because of the way their jaws formed.
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:21.960]  But that's how old and ancient and powerful and established and just unlimited these various regimes had been.
[1:40:21.960 --> 1:40:25.960]  The British Empire being one of the younger ones, though one of the more powerful ones.
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:39.960]  But the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Turkish Empire, the German Empire and the British Empire would by the end of World War One be mostly gone off the map as empires.
[1:40:39.960 --> 1:40:40.960]  They would politically vanish.
[1:40:40.960 --> 1:40:43.960]  The Brits would take a little bit longer, but not much longer.
[1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:46.960]  Ottoman Empire gone in less than a decade.
[1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:51.960]  The Austro-Hungarian Empire built for centuries would be gone in less than 10 years.
[1:40:51.960 --> 1:41:03.960]  A Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Russian Empire, all of these formed and created and lasted for centuries over wide-ranging disputes and conflicts.
[1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:15.960]  Within less than 10 years would be gone off the face of the planet as political entities, as existing relevant entities, as individuals, as institutions of influence.
[1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:22.960]  That is the same. So how did they get there? They got there because they were no longer just morally misdirected.
[1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:25.960]  It wasn't just their moral compass that was broken.
[1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:34.960]  It was their intellectual capacity that was equally blinded, that was equally misguided, that was equally, equally misdirected.
[1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:46.960]  This is why, in part, Vladimir Putin's speech this week laid out all the problems for the future of the deep state and the West and the globalist and how their days are numbered.
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:51.960]  How their ability to control the world, they thought they could control the world through finance.
[1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:55.960]  They thought they could control the world through little numbers and digits on a computer screen.
[1:41:55.960 --> 1:42:00.960]  They thought they could control the world through their manipulation of currencies and financial markets.
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:10.960]  And his point is that isn't what really runs the world. What runs the world is food, what runs the world is fuel, what runs the world is men with military means,
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:15.960]  and that's what governs and directs the world and, to some degree, the ideas that govern us.
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:19.960]  But what doesn't run us is little pieces of paper and little numbers on a screen.
[1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:26.960]  And that is why Putin was predicting the decline, the fall, the collapse of the Western deep state and the globalist,
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:31.960]  which he identified as such in these various speeches he's been giving over the last several weeks.
[1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:34.960]  Now you know why the deep state is obsessed with taking him out.
[1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:38.960]  And now you also know why the deep state is currently so desperate.
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:46.960]  That's why they're raiding presidents. That's why they're searching, doing an F.J. Edgar Hoover Pane raid of Melania's drawers.
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:49.960]  That's why they're looking at Barron Trump's personal room.
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:55.960]  We're going to be talking about what the deep state might be up to next and ways to resist and where the script has gone off.

[1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:31.960]  All we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare.
[1:45:31.960 --> 1:45:35.960]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.

[1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:02.960]  So many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said,
[1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:06.960]  Super male vitality is incredible. Why does it work so well?
[1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:08.960]  And the answer is very simple.

[1:46:16.960 --> 1:46:19.960]  And it comes from cold pressed herbs.
[1:46:19.960 --> 1:46:25.960]  So they're not boiling or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects.
[1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:29.960]  It's cold pressed. It's been sold out for eight months or more.

[1:46:54.960 --> 1:47:08.960]  It's amazing try today.
[1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:16.960]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. This is Robert Barnes, guest hosting.
[1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:24.960]  We live in interesting times. Just this past week, there was an attempt of an assassination on the Argentinian vice president.
[1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:26.960]  We had protests rock the globe.
[1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:43.960]  Indeed, since all of this has developed, the combination of the COVID lockdowns with the various fuel and food problems triggered by the globalist attempt to wage economic war against Russia over Russian parts of Ukraine, at least ancestrally and often demographically.
[1:47:43.960 --> 1:47:53.960]  We saw protests in Bangladesh. We've seen protests in Pakistan, where Pakistan they're trying to remove by illegal means, the elected president, they did.
[1:47:53.960 --> 1:48:00.960]  And then now they're trying to threaten to imprison him because of his speeches exposing their corruption. Sound familiar?
[1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:05.960]  We're seeing various protests from Sri Lanka and throughout Southeast Asia, throughout Europe.
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:23.960]  Farmer protests arise and not only rise but expand just as the trucker protest of Canada expanded. We're seeing similar reactions and responses in Germany and Italy and France to the Dutch farmer protests that may also glow global as people are tired of the globalist agenda.
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:38.960]  When you have people like the World Economic Forum talking about using artificial intelligence algorithms on their own website in order to shut down entire industries and how to sweet talk them into making that feel comfortable and okay, it gives you a sense of how AWOL things have gone.
[1:48:38.960 --> 1:48:47.960]  When they're doing specialized surveys and studies to figure out how they could improve the narrative, improving the narrative won't stop people from mass public protest.
[1:48:47.960 --> 1:49:04.960]  Indeed, we also had a report this week from a Human Rights Commission on human rights in for the Uighurs in China, exposing the degree of abuses that has taken place, abuses that fit within the pattern of against the people of Tibet, of the people of the Falun Gong,
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:13.960]  of the people in Hong Kong, of people in Taiwan, of labor protesters going back to Harry Wu, Tiananmen Square, etc.
[1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:33.960]  And so it's part of a longstanding extended Chinese tradition. While their real estate economy is collapsing, while their bank bubble is imploding, and while their zero COVID shutdown policies are permanently impairing potentially their economic activities in such a way that it is unlikely and improbable that China can continue to restore
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:48.960]  and keep itself on the same upward trajectory it once was. Doesn't mean it can't stay in a very competitive state, particularly for taking away American jobs, but it means that China is at a unique precarious risk while Premier Xi is up for re-election
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:55.960]  as party secretary this coming year, and possible conflict with Taiwan may serve as a convenient excuse to escape into it.
[1:49:55.960 --> 1:50:04.960]  That's the world that the deep state sees and witnesses and understands. It's a world which the populist resistance and rebellion is growing around the globe.
[1:50:04.960 --> 1:50:14.960]  It is a place where even China is no longer willing to be its complete subservient servant. It's a place where China and G1 assert their own interest and dominate for their own causes.
[1:50:14.960 --> 1:50:28.960]  They were happy to be the experimental place of the deep state for the purposes of pandemic policy and social credit scores and totalitarian government and cheap labor, but now that they've decided they don't want to be just the world's factory worker and want to be something else,
[1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:37.960]  that is unacceptable to the globalists, but it poses a unique and extraordinary threat to their power. They're losing in their war against Russia and Putin.
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:46.960]  They're losing their control over China and the global south, while at the same time seeing populist protest against their control mechanisms here in the United States.
[1:50:46.960 --> 1:51:01.960]  So what was the deep state plan? You can see aspects of the deep state plan planted into the QAnon community, maybe even Q himself, was a computer algorithm designed by deep state operators to see whether they could manipulate people
[1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:12.960]  through digital means that would be much more difficult to achieve, but that they had spent decades trying in the MKUltra space in the Informant Infiltrator FBI space.
[1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:21.960]  And for this, you could probably just go back to Pactcon. For those that don't know, Operation Pactcon was the FBI's attempts to resolve, how are we going to keep power?
[1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:31.960]  How is the deep state going to keep its fat budgets and political influence and control and surveillance now that no longer had anti-communism as its excuse?
[1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:41.960]  Indeed, anti-communism was used as the pretext for opposing every freedom movement around the globe, whether or not that freedom movement had affiliation or association with communism or not.
[1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:52.960]  Indeed, several of those movements were pushed into communism. Indeed, what you'll see is a continuous objective of deep state operatives to try to radicalize their opposition.
[1:51:52.960 --> 1:52:09.960]  They need their opposition to resort to violence. They need their opposition to resort to radical ideologies and the support of radical ideologue in order to embrace and to discredit them in the court of public opinion.
[1:52:09.960 --> 1:52:17.960]  This is what COINTELPRO was all about. Deep Throat, Mark Felt, who took out Nixon. He wasn't a grand whistleblower.
[1:52:17.960 --> 1:52:24.960]  He was part of the architect and administrator of COINTELPRO, Counterintelligence Program of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[1:52:24.960 --> 1:52:31.960]  It's primary obsession, the court of public opinion. Its goal, find ways to get people to self-discredit themselves.
[1:52:31.960 --> 1:52:34.960]  How do you get dissident movements to self-discredit themselves?
[1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:45.960]  You do so by getting them to align with violence. You do so by getting them to align with radical causes or individuals that will be perceived as dangerous to the ordinary person.
[1:52:45.960 --> 1:52:56.960]  This was the whole objective with going after Trump. The goal was through QAnon to build up a movement that would convince people that violence was the answer and that, in fact, the legal system wanted them to do so.
[1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:04.960]  That there were white-hacked actors within the military and the deep state that were really secretly supportive of them. That was step one.
[1:53:04.960 --> 1:53:18.960]  Step two was steal the election. Step three was discredit any challenges to the stealing of the election while inflaming opposition opinion, hoping they would do something dumb and dangerous so that they could be discredited in the court of public opinion to recreate a militia movement.
[1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:26.960]  Go back to October and study QAnon and QAnon movement was saying, you need to take oaths. You need to record yourself taking this oath.
[1:53:26.960 --> 1:53:37.960]  This oath was a trap. This was a huge red flag that QAnon was not an independent populist movement, but in fact a deep state infiltrated and driven and directed movement.
[1:53:37.960 --> 1:53:43.960]  As anyone who understood a lot of what QAnon world was saying was patently false repeatedly.
[1:53:43.960 --> 1:53:57.960]  But it took a lot of sincere, well-intended people wanting to second-guess and question the system to be skeptical of institutional narratives, to be derailed and distracted and detoured into a counterproductive, not just unproductive,
[1:53:57.960 --> 1:54:09.960]  but counterproductive set of ideas and theories that would preclude them from being effective in the court of public opinion where the deep state is often obsessed because it's the fifth pillar of power that holds up the other four pillars of power,
[1:54:09.960 --> 1:54:21.960]  the perception of power, the public belief in that power, the public confidence in that power, is that power. The moment it collapses, power sooner or later collapses with it more often than not.
[1:54:21.960 --> 1:54:29.960]  So that was part stage one. Stage two was to be able to try to encourage people to take violent action.
[1:54:29.960 --> 1:54:41.960]  The hope was that on January 6th, people would set off a bunch of bombs, conduct a bunch of kidnapping, do a bunch of violence, and they believed based on the social media language being used that they would achieve it.
[1:54:41.960 --> 1:54:54.960]  The problem is, and then step three was to get Trump during this stage to think the military was secretly aligned with him through the QAnon movement to try to do something like have the military intervene in the elections or something else.
[1:54:54.960 --> 1:55:03.960]  Remember, there were a lot of calls for that. There are calls for him to declare martial law even, etc. Of course, we now know, as I said at the time, that was a big fact track.
[1:55:03.960 --> 1:55:17.960]  General Milley and the top of the Pentagon are anti-Trump, not pro-Trump, as we now know in full robust detail in the information of treasonous and seditious activities that Milley himself was engaged in throughout 2020 and after.
[1:55:17.960 --> 1:55:27.960]  And so that was the goal. And then the thought process, well, now we have the perfect basis to impeach Trump. He invoked martial law. He tried to get the military to interfere in the election.
[1:55:27.960 --> 1:55:39.960]  Then we're going to prosecute Trump, imprison him. We're going to do mass arrest across the nation of all the key populist leaders, lock him up on the grounds they're all part of a broader, bigger, bolder conspiracy.
[1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:50.960]  And January 6 was supposed to be sort of the culmination of this. That would be the basis for all of the arrests. Problem, Trump never took the bait. He took the advice of some of us who told him not to take that bait.
[1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:58.960]  Second problem, they had to exaggerate all the January 6 charges because Pat Kahn never developed. Nobody went in there and took guns and tried to harm people.
[1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:10.960]  In fact, the limited violence that occurred was often in response to Capitol Police violence or Capitol Police eargassing or Capitol Police attack, not in fact initiated or instigated or originated by them.
[1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:23.960]  And the very few that did take place have unusual ties in many of those cases to informants, infiltrators, instigators, agitators, FBI participants that are on the payroll one way shape or form.
[1:56:23.960 --> 1:56:33.960]  So that tells us where they wanted the script to go. It hasn't worked out. They thought they could lock up Trump. They thought they could lock up Trump's key supporters. They thought they could lock up Trump's most active allies.
[1:56:33.960 --> 1:56:43.960]  They thought the QAnon election strategies would work. They didn't. Now they're stuck with backup plans. Desperation. That's why they're searching and seeking for anything.
[1:56:43.960 --> 1:56:53.960]  And even worse for them, Trump clearly took with him documents that embarrass them. Now legally as President of the United States, he is the only elected person with constitutional executive power.
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:57:00.960]  He has a complete right to declassify anything he wants anytime he wants without going through any formality or protocol period.
[1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:09.960]  He can declare anything he wants a personal record. This has been adjudicated by federal courts so that is not a presidential record, can't be considered governmental record period.
[1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:16.960]  End of story. He can do with it. What do you want? But it's clear he took documents and information that implicate the deep state.
[1:57:16.960 --> 1:57:22.960]  And the goal of the deep state was we're not going to go after Trump clearly. This was their strategic thinking until we got those documents back.
[1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:34.960]  But when they did the raid at Mar-a-Lago, the safe was empty. It turned out that wasn't all. All those folders they were showing photos of of classified information all ended up being empty as well.
[1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:41.960]  They still don't have whatever Trump had. And in the game against Trump, they got deep state, got Trump once again.
