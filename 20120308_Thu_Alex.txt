[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:28.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:28.240 --> 00:42.600]  For the first time in my life, I was unable to speak this morning for about 20 minutes.
[00:42.600 --> 00:46.320]  I don't know how to describe the feeling.
[00:46.320 --> 01:07.040]  Words can't describe it, but I sat there at the computer from about 7 a.m. until about 10 a.m. when I hurried in and got dressed and drove into the office,
[01:07.040 --> 01:19.520]  thinking about everything I've learned and everything I've seen, and watching a video that I saw up at infowars.com.
[01:19.520 --> 01:40.240]  And also this morning, it was the top story on Drudge Report, big headline, Secretary of Defense, authority to launch war comes from international bodies, not Congress.
[01:40.240 --> 01:53.720]  Now, I knew that they were doing this, and I knew this was the plan, and I knew that Obama last year said, I don't need Congress's approval to launch this war in Libya.
[01:53.720 --> 02:11.000]  I get it from the UN, which is as bad as it gets on so many fronts to launch a war without congressional approval is treason.
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.480]  It is despotism.
[02:12.480 --> 02:19.040]  It is the purest textbook form of tyrant.
[02:19.040 --> 02:27.360]  But there is something above tyrant in the escalation of absolute evil.
[02:27.360 --> 02:50.240]  And that is complete and total espionage and the usurpation of our country.
[02:50.240 --> 03:03.400]  Obama is simply not becoming a Julius Caesar in 49 BC, crossing the Rubicon and declaring the Senate vestigial and ceremonial.
[03:03.400 --> 03:12.360]  That's what happened here at one level without a bang, not even with a whimper.
[03:12.360 --> 03:26.120]  Caesar did it for what he believed the greater power of Rome, and it did lead to the eventual destruction of the empire before it swole.
[03:26.120 --> 03:35.920]  This is openly being done by foreign powers, a foreign global corporate power known as the New World Order, the private megabacks.
[03:35.920 --> 03:52.800]  So the president is not just as bad as a Julius Caesar, a tyrant, tyrannous, terrible tyrant, king tyrant, Rex tyrannous, king tyrant.
[03:52.800 --> 04:13.600]  It is beyond this, he is now, Obama and his cohorts and the Pentagon brass are 100% convicted publicly by their own actions of absolute sedition and warfare against the Republic of the United States, and they should all be arrested.
[04:13.600 --> 04:26.920]  Senator Sessions, when the brass and the Secretary of Defense repeatedly said, no, we follow foreign orders, he should have immediately had the sergeant of arms arrest them all on the spot.
[04:26.920 --> 04:33.480]  And the senator's like, I'm breathless, I'm having trouble breathing, because ladies and gentlemen, that is what this is.
[04:33.480 --> 04:40.760]  I mean, this is like out of Star Wars, Emperor Palpatine saying, I am the Senate.
[04:40.760 --> 04:47.800]  I mean, it's beyond crossing the Rubicon, it is just flabbergasting.
[04:47.800 --> 05:01.000]  And of course, I'm the extremist for saying that this is as clear as, as clear as it gets.
[05:01.000 --> 05:18.400]  Folks, Iran and the Middle East nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices, whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Middle East showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand.

[08:01.320 --> 08:08.320]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[08:08.320 --> 08:14.320]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:14.320 --> 08:25.320]  Welcome, my friends. This is a very grave broadcast that we're about to engage in here today.
[08:25.320 --> 08:31.320]  The information we're about to cover is so important that I have cleared the decks. There are no guests today.
[08:31.320 --> 08:43.320]  I hope that you realize the information I'm about to cover is of the absolute greatest importance to not just the United States, but everyone on this planet.
[08:43.320 --> 09:02.320]  This morning as I watched congressional testimony clips from yesterday, I was so blown away that when my wife came in and tried to talk to me, I told her, I cannot talk to you.
[09:02.320 --> 09:12.320]  And it was not drama. She'd never seen me in 14 years act like this. She said, what's wrong? And I said, you see what's on the screen.
[09:12.320 --> 09:18.320]  She went in the other room and Washington came back and said, my God, do we need to get out of here?
[09:18.320 --> 09:24.320]  She said, everything in my gut tells me get out of here.
[09:24.320 --> 09:33.320]  But I've promised to stay in the United States, but just what hit me is that we've been right about it all, except that it's worse than we said.
[09:33.320 --> 09:46.320]  And it's so real. And it's so horrible. And it's so destructive and dangerous.
[09:46.320 --> 09:53.320]  And we know exactly where it leads because humans behave the same over and over again in history.
[09:53.320 --> 10:16.320]  We're forced to either exert ourselves to the maximum extent to reverse this or to run to the hills. And that goes for everybody.
[10:16.320 --> 10:38.320]  What is going to unfold on this planet is by its design constructed to destroy and to pull down and to assault everything good.
[10:38.320 --> 11:00.320]  It is the final revolution of the globalist to talk about against humanity itself, against the nation state, against the individual, against every institution by the globalist, against property rights, the family, everything.
[11:00.320 --> 11:12.320]  Free speech, all of it on fire right now. What do I speak of? And we're going to play the video in its entirety and I'm going to be stopping it and making comments.
[11:12.320 --> 11:22.320]  But here is the headline, Panetta, International Permission for War, Trump's Congressional Permission for Military Actions.
[11:22.320 --> 11:34.320]  Now, that's the headline that the video of Defense Secretary Panetta in Congressional testimony with Dempsey and others said.
[11:34.320 --> 11:44.320]  But it's worse than that. I mean, that's a quote. But they went on to say Congress isn't even in the loop.
[11:44.320 --> 11:52.320]  And the senators begin to breathe heavy and actually flush red in shock.
[11:52.320 --> 12:04.320]  And Senator Sessions starts saying I'm actually losing my breath here.
[12:04.320 --> 12:12.320]  I'm breathless because here are the generals, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others all behind the Secretary of Defense.
[12:12.320 --> 12:24.320]  And while they're saying this to the Armed Services Committee, they're bosses.
[12:24.320 --> 12:31.320]  They all have a belligerent attitude.
[12:31.320 --> 12:45.320]  And Panetta over and over again, because I watched the compilation and then went to C-SPAN and actually found the entire hearing and sat there for an hour watching and it's even worse than the compilation shows.
[12:45.320 --> 12:49.320]  Now, I knew they were already doing this.
[12:49.320 --> 12:56.320]  And I'm going to break down if you're a new listener why this is the biggest deal ever.
[12:56.320 --> 13:13.320]  I already knew they were doing this, but to have them get before Congress that passes the laws and controls the purse string and declares war and that commissions officers, the Congress is the boss of the military.
[13:13.320 --> 13:34.320]  And the Congress then hands a bill of war with direct orders to the top general only in a time of war declared by them and then he becomes the commander in chief only during that prescribed piece of legislation and that mission.
[13:34.320 --> 13:50.320]  Because you don't want the president being able to become a dictator and declare war on their own as we've seen thousands of times in history, hundreds and hundreds of times in the last 200 years in Latin America alone, sometimes three or four times a year per country.
[13:50.320 --> 13:58.320]  Different generals declare themselves El Jefe, the chief, the boss, El Presidente, leader for life.
[13:58.320 --> 14:08.320]  Presidents, prime ministers, Roman senators constantly would declare themselves military dictator.
[14:08.320 --> 14:16.320]  But this goes one further on this day that lives in infamy.
[14:16.320 --> 14:35.320]  Today is Thursday, March 8, 2012, but as they said the times of Caesar beware the Ides of March, let the day of Wednesday, March 7, 2012 be a day that lives in infamy.
[14:35.320 --> 14:46.320]  Just as last year there was another date that I said was a major milestone when Obama put out a public letter from the White House and said, I don't need anything from Congress.
[14:46.320 --> 14:48.320]  Congress has no authority over war.
[14:48.320 --> 14:54.320]  Read the letter, we link to it in our article that we've written, Paul Watson's written on the subject.
[14:54.320 --> 15:01.320]  And he says, I do this through the authority of the UN and for the credibility of the UN.
[15:01.320 --> 15:26.320]  So it's precedent and so in an act of brazen precedent, the Secretary of Defense approved and confirmed by Congress, funded by Congress, came before the Senate and told them you are not in the equation.
[15:26.320 --> 15:35.320]  And they'd say, but the Congress is over war powers. That's the Constitution and the military brass and Panetta said no.
[15:35.320 --> 15:45.320]  The United Nations and NATO and foreign bodies and the senators are all looking at them because they all know this has already happened, but now it's being openly spoken.
[15:45.320 --> 15:56.320]  Now the world is being told, you're a joke Senate.
[15:56.320 --> 16:05.320]  Suddenly all over the United States, their regular army and Marine Corps checkpoints run by TSA on the streets, they call them TSA inspectors.
[16:05.320 --> 16:17.320]  Oh, the TSA inspectors are coming with the army, just feds completely out of their jurisdiction, engaging in a slow motion martial law rollout to acclimate everyone.
[16:17.320 --> 16:27.320]  And now, not as at the Kites Festival, but at other events now, the Army and National Guard and State Guard are at the events, searching and directing people.
[16:27.320 --> 16:38.320]  Where I live now, two weeks ago it was Army and TSA in Dallas. Now it's in Austin and it's in your town. This is it.
[16:38.320 --> 17:06.320]  Now let me explain why this is beyond Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon on January 10th, 49 BC, leading one legion, legio, the 8th of Gemini, Julius Caesar, General Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon River.
[17:06.320 --> 17:30.320]  The boundary between the Gaul province and the main province of Rome, Italy. To the north and Italy proper to the south, a legally prescribed action forbidden to any army leading general.
[17:30.320 --> 17:42.320]  It was designed, and the prohibition was set in place, as the greatest law in Rome to protect the Roman Republic from a coup d'état, internal military threat.
[17:42.320 --> 17:57.320]  Thus Caesar's military action began a civil war. This act of war on the Roman Republic by Julius Caesar led to widespread approval amongst the Roman civilians who believed him to be a hero.
[17:57.320 --> 18:10.320]  The historical records differ about which decisive comment Caesar made on crossing the Rubicon.
[18:10.320 --> 18:32.320]  But the most historically referenced is the die is cast, because he was committing himself at that point now. Was he an enemy of Rome? He believed he wasn't. He wasn't working for a foreign power, but he was killed for it in the Senate.
[18:32.320 --> 18:43.320]  But that idea of having a king, a Caesar, began to degenerate the empire, because if you don't have basic law you have nothing and corruption set in.
[18:43.320 --> 19:01.320]  This is far worse what we face because the generals didn't announce that the president had the power, which is on its face a total fraud and well known to anyone who's read the Constitution or swore an oath to it like these officers have.
[19:01.320 --> 19:11.320]  It's the first thing you're taught in ROTC, first thing you're taught in officer training, first thing you're taught in the military, first thing in your handbook is the chain of command.
[19:11.320 --> 19:21.320]  They know that. They know it's Congress controlled by the American people and the Constitution Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence. Let me state it clearly.
[19:21.320 --> 19:31.320]  This is beyond treason. This is invasion. This is war against America. I'm just reading to you from Encyclopedia Britannica.
[19:31.320 --> 19:49.320]  Caesar's Act was an act of war against the Roman Republic. This is beyond that because Obama and his cohorts openly worked for foreign mega central banks and corporations who have created this international body to cede domestic power to themselves.
[19:49.320 --> 19:59.320]  This is a international corporate coup d'etat against America and all of these people pushing this should be arrested today.
[20:19.320 --> 20:35.320]  This has been incredible. 37 pounds in two months. Our bodies are amazing and God gave us an incredible gift. But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy.

[24:13.320 --> 24:25.320]  Okay. Again, I want to be very, very clear here with everyone who is listening to us on the radio across the United States and worldwide.
[24:25.320 --> 24:31.320]  Everyone watching us at infowarsnews.com.
[24:31.320 --> 24:47.320]  I am giving you 100% common law back to Rome over 2200 years, common law in England, common law here in the US, the Declaration of Independence Constitution, all of it.
[24:47.320 --> 25:00.320]  I'm going to play these clips coming up in the next segment. When you have the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, the Secretary of Defense before the Senate, and they're saying, hey,
[25:00.320 --> 25:10.320]  you haven't come to us to launch the Libya war. You haven't come to us to launch these new operations in Syria.
[25:10.320 --> 25:17.320]  If you want to launch these wars, you've got to come to us. And by the way, the Congress wants these wars, these proxy wars.
[25:17.320 --> 25:30.320]  But you've got to get authority from us. And the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff talking to their bosses, the Congress that control the purse and the war powers.
[25:30.320 --> 25:40.320]  Tell them no. We get it from the President who gets it from international bodies. And they say the UN NATO.
[25:40.320 --> 25:48.320]  Now, see, the same things happen in Europe. If you look at Europe, they're telling them the 25 member states of the EU can't get out of the Europe.
[25:48.320 --> 25:58.320]  And that private megabanks are now appointing the Prime Ministers and Presidents and raising taxes and cutting benefits to pay off debts created by the bankers.
[25:58.320 --> 26:07.320]  And so it's in Forbes, it's in the Economist, it's in the Financial Times. Oh, the technocrats aren't elected and they're setting up a global private corporate government they know best.
[26:07.320 --> 26:20.320]  Open world government out in the open. And it's the same private groups. Those countries over time have had globalist agents put in who've signed more and more authority over to these NATO bodies.
[26:20.320 --> 26:32.320]  IMF, World Bank, OECD, all these groups. And now those groups are saying, okay, you no longer as a country have any authority. Europe is being told this and you can't get out.
[26:32.320 --> 26:40.320]  That's all fraud. It's all been done by fraud. So they're dissolving the nation states and transferring these corporate bodies.
[26:40.320 --> 26:48.320]  I mean, imagine these senators who are haughty and full of themselves on so many fronts, but it's the separation of powers as the founders did.
[26:48.320 --> 26:58.320]  They separated the power so you couldn't get a dictator. And so somebody tried to become one. Other powerful people aren't going to want to have their power taken, even if they're immoral.
[26:58.320 --> 27:07.320]  There's very few moral up there like Ron Paul. Kucinich had a warped value system, but was a moral guy who believed in what he was doing.
[27:07.320 --> 27:16.320]  He's been removed. He just lost. He, of course, was leading 10 Congress people suing Obama over the illegal Libya war.
[27:16.320 --> 27:24.320]  Congress sent him letters and said, you got to at least get authorization, forget award declaration. They said, no, I got the UN giving me authority.
[27:24.320 --> 27:34.320]  So this isn't like Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon and saying, I'll do whatever I want 2000 plus years ago, 2050 something years ago.
[27:34.320 --> 27:45.320]  This is worse. This is Obama financed by the big mega banks by foreign interest. You see, it isn't really new to have foreign corporate interest take over your country.
[27:45.320 --> 27:57.320]  The British East India, the Dutch East India company ran entire areas of the Pacific, entire areas of Asia, China, India, corporations did their own militaries.
[27:57.320 --> 28:09.320]  In fact, it's the, it is the model that came out of Italy from its nation states into England 500 years ago.
[28:09.320 --> 28:19.320]  It is the black nobility model and British troops and others would be landed to serve these private corporations.
[28:19.320 --> 28:30.320]  And that's what the new world order is. That's what Cecil Rhodes said it was, wrote books on it. That's what futurist, he wrote more nonfiction than he did fiction.
[28:30.320 --> 28:40.320]  HD Wells wrote about this is a global corporate socialist combine run by the ultra rich to shut down free market for everybody else, but them.
[28:40.320 --> 28:46.320]  And laws and bureaucracy to shut everybody down, but them, they're all exempt.
[28:46.320 --> 28:53.320]  And so we now have the spectacle of the Senate and the House, the Congress being told, you don't matter.
[28:53.320 --> 29:00.320]  And they're like, yeah, we do. We, the Constitution, you swear an oath to that.
[29:00.320 --> 29:04.320]  And it says the Congress is in charge and they go, no, you're not. And then it goes, no, you're not.
[29:04.320 --> 29:10.320]  And you watch the generals, they're getting off on it. Their body language is, you bet, we're in charge.
[29:10.320 --> 29:15.320]  Folks, this is exactly what happens in Guatemala or Nigeria.
[29:15.320 --> 29:23.320]  I mean, it's here. And it totally freaked the Senate out. There's multiple senators and House members breaking news.
[29:23.320 --> 29:30.320]  Representative Jones puts Obama on notice. Representative Walter Jones, Republican North Carolina, introduced.
[29:30.320 --> 29:39.320]  Eight concurrent resolution 107, which calls on the House and the Senate concurring to the following to put the president on notice of articles of impeachment,
[29:39.320 --> 29:49.320]  for violation of the Constitution and treachery against the Republic. This is, this is not rhetoric. This is an act of war against America.
[29:49.320 --> 30:10.320]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:23.320 --> 33:34.320]  This is an extremely grave time that we're in right now.
[33:34.320 --> 33:49.320]  I am begging you to listen to me carefully because I'm going to have Paul Watson put out another article in the next hour or two on this subject with congressional phone numbers.
[33:49.320 --> 33:55.320]  We have to have a plan of action. You know, when it comes to saying call Congress, tell them get rid of the TSA.
[33:55.320 --> 34:04.320]  When enough Congress people get harassed by TSA, they are having hearings and legislation to point out that they cannot engage in law enforcement activities.
[34:04.320 --> 34:08.320]  They're not bonded sworn officers that they've got to stay within the Constitution.
[34:08.320 --> 34:18.320]  It takes time, but you can force something on Congress when there's enough pressure and when it's morally and defensible.
[34:18.320 --> 34:23.320]  And I could use a lot of other examples, but on this subject, Congress gets it.
[34:23.320 --> 34:31.320]  Congress knows that they are the largest, most diverse body representing the states, the House and the Senate.
[34:31.320 --> 34:42.320]  A lot of them are corrupt, a lot of them are bad, but they understand that when the military comes before them, they've always been the bosses in the chain of command.
[34:42.320 --> 34:51.320]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chairman, all they say, yes, sir, they all, you know, the Secretary of Defense would never.
[34:51.320 --> 35:04.320]  This would be the equivalent, I hate to use gross analogies, of going up to a mega church in front of 5,000 people and pulling your pants down and defecating in front of the altar.
[35:04.320 --> 35:09.320]  I hate to use a gross analogy, but that's what this, I mean, this is so over the top.
[35:09.320 --> 35:15.320]  This is so 100% treason, but beyond treason.
[35:15.320 --> 35:21.320]  This is treachery, this is invasion, this is war against the Republic.
[35:21.320 --> 35:35.320]  I was just reading to you from the Encyclopedia Britannica on Roman law and the 49 BC crossing in the Rubicon by Julius Caesar, which was an act of war against the Roman Republic and ended up destroying it.
[35:35.320 --> 35:40.320]  And he was a popular super general.
[35:40.320 --> 35:42.320]  This is beyond that.
[35:42.320 --> 35:56.320]  This is a group of financial interests that have gotten control of the presidency, gotten control of most of the Governorships, gotten control of many House and Senate members, gotten control, gotten the government to shine on to their 1.5-quadrillion,
[35:56.320 --> 36:05.320]  in fraudulent paper derivatives they created in the last 12, 13 years, since 1999, Glass-Steagall being removed.
[36:05.320 --> 36:07.320]  So we're already in economic fraud.
[36:07.320 --> 36:11.320]  We're already in economic bondage.
[36:11.320 --> 36:15.320]  And these global banks openly fund a Gen. 21 in a post-industrial world.
[36:15.320 --> 36:22.320]  They openly fund the shutdown of the U.S. and tax incentives to move what's left of industry and business offshore.
[36:22.320 --> 36:29.320]  And to raise our taxes while lowering them in zones they control 100% like Communist China.
[36:29.320 --> 36:43.320]  By the way, I've got an article here about China's parliament unveils dissonant detention powers, secret arrest, secret detention, modeled after the NDAA, and it's being decried by Reuters and international groups.
[36:43.320 --> 36:46.320]  But see, there's no moral high ground anymore.
[36:46.320 --> 37:08.320]  America, once the image of liberty and freedom, the example, not perfect, but still the best there was, is now the example in obesity, and cancer, and porn, and death, and illiteracy, and evil, and war, and torture, and secret arrest, and every form of degeneracy you can imagine.
[37:08.320 --> 37:13.320]  Now, continuing here.
[37:13.320 --> 37:17.320]  This is the gauntlet being thrown down. What is the gauntlet?
[37:17.320 --> 37:33.320]  If you go back thousands of years, even to the beginnings of the Byzantine Empire, and then you go through what's Spain and Portugal today and other areas, many times your armies, your city-states, wouldn't want to kill each other,
[37:33.320 --> 37:45.320]  because that would make you internally weak, say in the case, in the true story of El Cid, great film based on real history, suggest everyone watches it with Charlton Heston, and the Moors are invading.
[37:45.320 --> 37:52.320]  And at that weak point, one of the other city-states in Spain, what Spain today comes in, and says, you will give us this city.
[37:52.320 --> 37:56.320]  And the king says, ancestrally, we've had this city for hundreds of years.
[37:56.320 --> 38:02.320]  And he says, fine, I will meet you with our armies on the field of battle here.
[38:02.320 --> 38:05.320]  And the king says, let us not do this while our enemies are invading.
[38:05.320 --> 38:08.320]  I know you've done this thinking, I'll just get into you right now.
[38:08.320 --> 38:14.320]  Let it be decided by champion.
[38:14.320 --> 38:25.320]  And very well, take your glove off, throw it down, boom, the challenge is on, and it cannot be refused.
[38:25.320 --> 38:34.320]  Now, let me tell you what the brass did, lined up behind Panetta, watching this video, it's up at infowars.com in our articles on this subject.
[38:34.320 --> 38:42.320]  They took the gauntlet, and they just threw it down in front of Congress.
[38:42.320 --> 38:54.320]  And I watched over and over again, the body language of those generals, they had slit eyes like wolves staring at those senators with total contempt.
[38:54.320 --> 39:03.320]  And Panetta sat there in a very friendly but mafioso way, just going, no.
[39:03.320 --> 39:10.320]  They'd say, but Congress, officers are commissioned by Congress, we hold the purse, we hold the war powers, it's the Constitution.
[39:10.320 --> 39:13.320]  And Panetta says, no, you in a NATO.
[39:13.320 --> 39:17.320]  And the senators are like, what?
[39:17.320 --> 39:22.320]  But see what happened last year.
[39:22.320 --> 39:26.320]  When Obama said, I'm launching this war against Libya, but it's not a war.
[39:26.320 --> 39:28.320]  They said, but you got to get congressional authorization.
[39:28.320 --> 39:30.320]  He said, no, I don't need it.
[39:30.320 --> 39:32.320]  I get it from the UN.
[39:32.320 --> 39:42.320]  He didn't say the president can do this because the president can't.
[39:42.320 --> 39:47.320]  He said, I can do it because the UN gives me the authority.
[39:47.320 --> 39:54.320]  Paul Watson's article at infowars.com, the most important article we've ever put out.
[39:54.320 --> 39:57.320]  And we're going to have more on this subject.
[39:57.320 --> 40:03.320]  Has the links to the White House press releases where he says, I do this for the credibility of the UN.
[40:03.320 --> 40:08.320]  He does this as a lawyer, as a constitutional lawyer, to say there is no constitution.
[40:08.320 --> 40:17.320]  The UN commands the American president who created the UN, Rockefeller Carnegie Foundation, writer in the U.S., the Pentagon, intimately involved.
[40:17.320 --> 40:20.320]  Not for America even, as some tool of control.
[40:20.320 --> 40:22.320]  That'd be bad enough.
[40:22.320 --> 40:30.320]  But as a thing to transfer the powers of the Republican to and then incrementally build it out and train everybody to accept it.
[40:30.320 --> 40:37.320]  And now they're to the point, they've got blackmail files on all these senators and House members, hit teams ready to kill those they don't control,
[40:37.320 --> 40:39.320]  that they don't have dirt on.
[40:39.320 --> 40:47.320]  And they walk in there and they say, we're going to launch a war in Syria and it doesn't matter what you say or do.
[40:47.320 --> 40:50.320]  And the senators are like, just like they were eight, nine months ago in Libya.
[40:50.320 --> 40:52.320]  They're like, well, we'd like to authorize it.
[40:52.320 --> 40:55.320]  You know, we're military industrial complex funded.
[40:55.320 --> 40:56.320]  We're all for doing this.
[40:56.320 --> 40:58.320]  That's just you got to get authority from us.
[40:58.320 --> 40:59.320]  And they go, no, we don't.
[40:59.320 --> 41:04.320]  We get it from the UN and NATO.
[41:04.320 --> 41:08.320]  And the senators are like, but that's, that's unconstitutional.
[41:08.320 --> 41:10.320]  It's not just unconstitutional.
[41:10.320 --> 41:23.320]  It's treason and treachery and a dictatorial Caesar asked power grab directly out of a textbook, directly out of episode three Star Wars when the when,
[41:23.320 --> 41:29.320]  which is based on the Roman Senate from history when Emperor Palpatine takes over and they come to arresting.
[41:29.320 --> 41:34.320]  They say, you're, you're taking on all the powers of the Senate as a dictator, you're under arrest.
[41:34.320 --> 41:37.320]  And he goes, it's treason then.
[41:37.320 --> 41:39.320]  And they go, but the Senate won't stand for this.
[41:39.320 --> 41:41.320]  I am the Senate.
[41:41.320 --> 41:42.320]  That's what Caesar said.
[41:42.320 --> 41:44.320]  This is beyond.
[41:44.320 --> 41:47.320]  In fact, he said, I am the Senate once he took over.
[41:47.320 --> 41:49.320]  They said, but we're just a rubber stamp now.
[41:49.320 --> 41:53.320]  Well, I'll keep you around as a debating club, but I make the ultimate decisions.
[41:53.320 --> 41:55.320]  I am the Senate.
[41:55.320 --> 41:58.320]  He said other things like I came, I saw, I conquered.
[41:58.320 --> 42:01.320]  Hillary said the same thing about Libya.
[42:01.320 --> 42:03.320]  Laughed about it.
[42:03.320 --> 42:08.320]  A soft little goblin like woman dominating the Republic using us to carry all these crimes.
[42:08.320 --> 42:10.320]  She said, we came, we saw.
[42:10.320 --> 42:16.320]  He died speaking of Gaddafi who made a deal with him and let the West come in and liberalized everything.
[42:16.320 --> 42:17.320]  Oh, you're out.
[42:17.320 --> 42:18.320]  Al-Qaeda's in.
[42:18.320 --> 42:22.320]  Do you understand that there's no Bill of Rights?
[42:22.320 --> 42:24.320]  There's no Constitution.
[42:24.320 --> 42:27.320]  There's no nothing under this.
[42:27.320 --> 42:45.320]  And a foreign power, a foreign power, which is this globalist corporate central bank, global governance consortium commands our president and our military.
[42:45.320 --> 42:48.320]  This is this is the minimum what I'm saying here.
[42:48.320 --> 42:49.320]  Do you understand that?
[42:49.320 --> 42:52.320]  And I had a certain fleshly human level.
[42:52.320 --> 42:54.320]  I don't like throwing the gauntlet right back down.
[42:54.320 --> 42:58.320]  But a challenge of this nature must be responded to.
[42:58.320 --> 43:01.320]  Because every time a country does this, it goes downhill quickly.
[43:01.320 --> 43:07.320]  They will rob and steal and destroy every bedrock, family, private property, religious freedom.
[43:07.320 --> 43:08.320]  Everything's gone, folks.
[43:08.320 --> 43:10.320]  And it's going to happen very quickly.
[43:10.320 --> 43:13.320]  Giant wars, everything.
[43:13.320 --> 43:14.320]  Okay.
[43:14.320 --> 43:16.320]  If they get away with this.
[43:16.320 --> 43:21.320]  Now, the good news is there are a bunch of senators and House members saying start impeachment procedures.
[43:21.320 --> 43:25.320]  You've got a call. In fact, I meant to ask you guys before the show because they got a bunch of numbers.
[43:25.320 --> 43:28.320]  They alternate them to keep the public from knowing what to call.
[43:28.320 --> 43:34.320]  Check the latest toll free and toll switch numbers for the House and Senate.
[43:34.320 --> 43:35.320]  Give them to me.
[43:35.320 --> 43:38.320]  I'm going to test them because they don't change their numbers.
[43:38.320 --> 43:43.320]  They have like four or five variants that they rotate that are being answered whatever day.
[43:43.320 --> 43:45.320]  We've got to put articles out.
[43:45.320 --> 43:47.320]  We've got a call for the military.
[43:47.320 --> 43:50.320]  I'm calling for the military, especially officers.
[43:50.320 --> 43:56.320]  I don't care if you're a master sergeant or if you're a commissioned officer, you know, a colonel.
[43:56.320 --> 44:00.320]  This is the time to write letters to the president and to the editor.
[44:00.320 --> 44:01.320]  This is the time.
[44:01.320 --> 44:12.320]  I mean, you'll charge machine gun nest and flying, you know, unmaintenance helicopters and aircrafts and go and do all this and carry packs 40 miles and live off the land for a month.
[44:12.320 --> 44:14.320]  You know, to be in special forces.
[44:14.320 --> 44:15.320]  And I know you're good people.
[44:15.320 --> 44:16.320]  You'll do all this.
[44:16.320 --> 44:18.320]  Do you have the moral courage that I have?
[44:18.320 --> 44:24.320]  Some soft person to risk your name.
[44:24.320 --> 44:26.320]  Yeah, they may try to court martial you.
[44:26.320 --> 44:27.320]  They may try to arrest you.
[44:27.320 --> 44:31.320]  Probably not have enough of you come out, but I'm risking my life right now calling for this.
[44:31.320 --> 44:32.320]  But it's what's got to be done.
[44:32.320 --> 44:37.320]  All military that are not treasonous traitors to this far and takeover.
[44:37.320 --> 44:43.320]  This war against the Republic and you got Congress people coming out saying this is illegal and Obama should be impeached.
[44:43.320 --> 44:49.320]  Folks, he should be impeached if he said he had the power to wage war and probably arrested.
[44:49.320 --> 45:04.320]  But the fact that he says it's for a foreign consortium, you never give the president the power to launch wars or anything on his own because a foreign group could pay him off or blackmail them or they could have been brought here and raised as agents.
[45:04.320 --> 45:06.320]  Our founders dealt with this.
[45:06.320 --> 45:07.320]  Europe always dealt with this.
[45:07.320 --> 45:11.320]  This is our founders were historians who spoke four or five languages.
[45:11.320 --> 45:13.320]  They wrote this to protect us from this.
[45:13.320 --> 45:14.320]  It's happening.
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.320]  It happens everywhere else.
[45:19.320 --> 45:30.320]  Our criminal illegitimate government now gives aid and comfort to the Communist Chinese as they pass an NDAA identical to what our Congress and Obama signed.
[45:30.320 --> 45:38.320]  And look, they have contempt for the Congress because they know they're a bunch of little traitorous creatures as well.
[45:38.320 --> 45:47.320]  Who would give the president the power to secretly arrest and wage war anywhere in the world, including against citizens domestically.
[45:47.320 --> 45:55.320]  I mean, Congress, you gave him this power, which is illegitimate, but nevertheless you did, which was a conviction of all of you that voted for it.
[45:55.320 --> 46:02.320]  Hundreds didn't and is a conviction by their own hand and their own statements of the executive.
[46:02.320 --> 46:05.320]  This is not the U.S. government.
[46:05.320 --> 46:15.320]  This is Encyclopedia Britannica says the moment Caesar crossed the Rubicon and his forces, he became a traitor and an enemy of the Roman Republic and was waging war against the Republic.
[46:15.320 --> 46:19.320]  The Republic is collapsing right now.
[46:19.320 --> 46:20.320]  This is this.
[46:20.320 --> 46:31.320]  You could mark this as as the New World Order firing 357 rounds directly into the chest of this country.
[46:31.320 --> 46:40.320]  And if we don't put the Republic in the hospital right now and get surgery going right now, this just shows us how sick we already were.
[46:40.320 --> 46:42.320]  And I'm going to put this in an article.
[46:42.320 --> 46:46.320]  It is time for military officers to speak out, which is not even.
[46:46.320 --> 46:47.320]  That's all you can do.
[46:47.320 --> 46:49.320]  Look, read your oath.
[46:49.320 --> 46:51.320]  Read what you were charged with.
[46:51.320 --> 46:59.320]  I mean, it absolutely says that you will follow the Constitution and that you swear enough to the Constitution.
[46:59.320 --> 47:08.320]  And to the Commander-in-Chief in time of war when they declare the war, when the Congress who funds it and runs it and approves the...
[47:08.320 --> 47:10.320]  Why doesn't the President pick his generals?
[47:10.320 --> 47:14.320]  Why does Congress?
[47:14.320 --> 47:20.320]  Why do officers have to be approved and have letters of recommendation that your family's been here a long time?
[47:20.320 --> 47:27.320]  Folks, you couldn't become an officer in the first 150 years of this country once it got started if your family hadn't been here forever.
[47:27.320 --> 47:34.320]  You weren't even trusted to be an officer if your family didn't get here in the first few boatloads.
[47:34.320 --> 47:38.320]  Now look at what we've turned into.
[47:38.320 --> 47:39.320]  Now look what we've become.
[47:39.320 --> 47:42.320]  It's pathetic.
[47:42.320 --> 47:49.320]  You've got these criminal gangsters who've stolen tens of trillions of dollars and all the corruption and shipping guns to Mexico,
[47:49.320 --> 48:00.320]  waddling in, slapping the Congress in the face, going, listen here, Mack, you don't run Jack Squad, and the senators are all like old peacocks fluffing up, getting angry.
[48:00.320 --> 48:07.320]  But I'm sure they're, again, the globalists wouldn't have made this move if they didn't know that they think they have that house in that Senate.
[48:07.320 --> 48:09.320]  Saying, we're going to launch wars.
[48:09.320 --> 48:13.320]  I told you folks that when they got away with that Libya war, the congressional approval of the sky was the limit.
[48:13.320 --> 48:16.320]  And now look at it.
[48:16.320 --> 48:23.320]  The minimum that the military can do, and the police and all of you that claim you sworn an oath to that Constitution,
[48:23.320 --> 48:31.320]  the minimum you can do is put out public letters, shoot YouTube videos.
[48:31.320 --> 48:37.320]  I mean, if I was a military officer, I would have the troops form up in front of me, and I would, and I would read them the Constitution.
[48:37.320 --> 48:45.320]  I'd read them what Congressman Jones has said, and I would play on that video of them and then go, look, the Congress is in charge.
[48:45.320 --> 48:47.320]  If you know this, you see what's happening.
[48:47.320 --> 48:51.320]  I'd read them out of the Encyclopedia Britannica about Julius Caesar.
[48:51.320 --> 48:58.320]  And I would march down to the headquarters and say, why is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the other generals in there,
[48:58.320 --> 49:06.320]  like a bunch of gangsters, telling Congress that they no longer have any authority over military actions and that not the president,
[49:06.320 --> 49:09.320]  again, that would be treason and dictatorship.
[49:09.320 --> 49:18.320]  No, no, no, that's worse than Julius Caesar. Julius Caesar was a patriot compared to this.
[49:18.320 --> 49:22.320]  No, I mean, I am getting chilled after chill right now.
[49:22.320 --> 49:24.320]  Probably because I know I'm risking my life doing this, but whatever.
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.320]  I mean, who somebody's got to stand up to the emperor being butt naked here?
[49:29.320 --> 49:32.320]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[49:32.320 --> 49:33.320]  Wait till I play the clips.
[49:33.320 --> 49:35.320]  I mean, they're up at infowars.com.
[49:35.320 --> 49:39.320]  Pentagon launches desperate damage control over shocking Panetta testimony.
[49:39.320 --> 49:42.320]  The United States is seated in control of its affairs international bureaucrats.
[49:42.320 --> 49:48.320]  And even in their comment, they go, it's misinterpreted, but we do get our authority from firing groups.
[49:48.320 --> 49:49.320]  So it's a Psyop.
[49:49.320 --> 49:51.320]  We want world government, but it doesn't exist.
[49:51.320 --> 50:02.320]  And then we've got all the quotes in the video in the article, but I'm calling on the military officers of conscience to speak out.
[50:02.320 --> 50:10.320]  And if they try to court martial you and call you in and you're saying, look, I have to go public here.
[50:10.320 --> 50:18.320]  Congress is now not even being consulted on war when I swore an oath to this and Congress will get behind you.
[50:18.320 --> 50:20.320]  This is the Achilles Hill of these guys.
[50:20.320 --> 50:21.320]  They've gone too far.
[50:21.320 --> 50:24.320]  There's already a bunch of senators and House members saying begin impeachment.
[50:24.320 --> 50:29.320]  But if we just sit here and kind of get intimidated and, oh, well, the military follows these orders.
[50:29.320 --> 50:38.320]  And listen, military, you heard Colonel Schaefer here two days ago, the guy that ran the hunt bin Laden unit, a real patriot, special forces, everything.
[50:38.320 --> 50:40.320]  Saying, no, this is treason.
[50:40.320 --> 50:42.320]  This is illegal.
[50:42.320 --> 50:43.320]  Treason?
[50:43.320 --> 50:44.320]  It's illegal.
[50:44.320 --> 50:48.320]  Time to start saying, no, I'm here in front of God and everybody.
[50:48.320 --> 50:52.320]  Three million people right now saying, military, speak up.
[50:52.320 --> 50:53.320]  The pen is my ear and the sword.
[50:53.320 --> 50:59.320]  Point out this is illegal and say that you are under Congress except under declaration of war.
[50:59.320 --> 51:25.320]  We'll be right back.
[51:29.320 --> 51:58.320]  We'll be right back.

[54:25.320 --> 54:28.320]  I'm right. I've had endless congressional scholars on.
[54:28.320 --> 54:35.320]  I had congressional scholar and advisor and former federal regulator Bruce Fine on.
[54:35.320 --> 54:39.320]  He said, this is treason. This is takeover, the Libya situation.
[54:39.320 --> 54:43.320]  I've had Colonel Schaefer on saying it's treason. It's illegal.
[54:43.320 --> 54:46.320]  I mean, he's still in the military saying this is treason.
[54:46.320 --> 54:49.320]  But it's worse than treason. It's espionage.
[54:49.320 --> 54:53.320]  It's treason if you're an American and do this to your country.
[54:53.320 --> 54:59.320]  It's beyond treason when you do it for a foreign power, and it is mind blowing.
[54:59.320 --> 55:02.320]  I'm going to play the clips next hour.
[55:02.320 --> 55:07.320]  The video's up at infowars.com. It's a seven and a half minute clip of Senator Sessions going,
[55:07.320 --> 55:12.320]  well, you've got to get approval from us to be involved in military operations against countries.
[55:12.320 --> 55:14.320]  And they go, no, we don't. We get that from NATO and the UN.
[55:14.320 --> 55:17.320]  He goes, but Congress does that. The Constitution says, and they go,
[55:17.320 --> 55:22.320]  we now follow the United Nations.
[55:22.320 --> 55:24.320]  I mean, you can go watch the video, go read the quotes.
[55:24.320 --> 55:27.320]  And it goes on and on. The senators start going, wait a minute.
[55:27.320 --> 55:34.320]  You know, Congress funds you and we commission the officers.
[55:34.320 --> 55:38.320]  And the brass are looking at them like they're the enemy.
[55:38.320 --> 55:41.320]  I've never seen, and I've watched hundreds of these hearings.
[55:41.320 --> 55:46.320]  I've never seen the generals act so criminal.
[55:46.320 --> 55:51.320]  I mean, we had the last joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman saying no to this just a couple of years ago.
[55:51.320 --> 55:56.320]  I mean, I've never seen them behave like this. They have really gotten a crew of crooks.
[55:56.320 --> 56:00.320]  They are arresting journalists by the hundreds. And it's just a minor footnote.
[56:00.320 --> 56:04.320]  Oh, you, you talked to whistleblower on government corruption. You're going to jail.
[56:04.320 --> 56:09.320]  I got Wired Magazine, the feds are announcing they'll take any dot com they want and seize it anytime
[56:09.320 --> 56:12.320]  because they control the register outside of courts.
[56:12.320 --> 56:17.320]  Even political reasons that are racing videos critical the government on YouTube.
[56:17.320 --> 56:24.320]  I'm getting lots of lavish death threats that my time's coming.
[56:24.320 --> 56:29.320]  The state police in Austin are calling up my affiliate trying to get me off the air.
[56:29.320 --> 56:33.320]  Because the green light's been given. It's time to butcher America.
[56:33.320 --> 56:38.320]  Well, I hope all of you that serve evil understand that the horrible country you're going to turn this into,
[56:38.320 --> 56:44.320]  you did it idiots for a bunch of globalists that sit offshore who've always hated this country.
[56:44.320 --> 56:51.320]  Thanks a lot for killing America and wrapping all your trees in the American flag.
[56:51.320 --> 56:53.320]  You make me want to throw up.
[56:53.320 --> 56:58.320]  There are those of us that know this was once a great republic and it will rise again.
[56:58.320 --> 57:02.320]  Just know that they've already killed the country. They've already butchered it.
[57:02.320 --> 57:04.320]  We're dead already.
[57:04.320 --> 57:21.320]  You see a country is a spirit and idea so it can be resurrected but we're walking dead.
[57:21.320 --> 57:26.320]  The republic is basically collapsing right now. It's already hit its knees.
[57:26.320 --> 57:31.320]  There's thousands of cuts but these stabs are so deep.
[57:31.320 --> 57:37.320]  And the contempt before the Senate going, no, we don't come to you for wars anymore.
[57:37.320 --> 57:42.320]  Obama put a letter out last year and launched a war.
[57:42.320 --> 57:47.320]  I'm going to give you the number to the switchboard. Everybody needs to call Congress and say,
[57:47.320 --> 57:51.320]  what is it going to take? Start impeachment now. This is treason.
[57:51.320 --> 57:57.320]  202-224-3121. No one is safe. Nothing is safe.
[57:57.320 --> 58:02.320]  202-224-3121. Due process, our country, everything.
[58:02.320 --> 58:06.320]  This is foreign corporate invaders. This is tyranny by lawyers.
[58:06.320 --> 58:11.320]  Where they come in, set up structures, start transferring power, money and influence.
[58:11.320 --> 58:16.320]  And then now they're just fully transferring and going, not only we don't need a declaration of war
[58:16.320 --> 58:19.320]  or even an authorization, you don't run anything.
[58:19.320 --> 58:22.320]  Kind of like the feds have told the states they have no authority.
[58:22.320 --> 58:26.320]  We'll see now. The federal government is being told it has no authority.
[58:26.320 --> 58:32.320]  It's all the U.N. and NATO run by private central banks. See how that works?
[58:32.320 --> 58:38.320]  202-224-3121. I'll give you the number for the military to call in in just a moment.
[58:43.320 --> 58:47.320]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.320 --> 58:54.320]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[58:54.320 --> 58:57.320]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[58:57.320 --> 59:02.320]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[59:02.320 --> 59:09.320]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[59:09.320 --> 59:12.320]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at InfowarsTeam.com,
[59:12.320 --> 59:20.320]  but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[59:20.320 --> 59:24.320]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[59:24.320 --> 59:28.320]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[59:28.320 --> 59:32.320]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months. Now, that's results.
[59:32.320 --> 59:39.320]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfowarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[59:39.320 --> 59:45.320]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[59:45.320 --> 59:50.320]  Start your journey to health and wellness today. InfowarsTeam.com.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:31.320]  OK, we're at Breitbart.com, and I'm going to cover this more after the break, but here's the article.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.320]  Panetta, International Permission, Trump's Congressional Permission for Military Actions.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:42.320]  Actually, I'm not criticizing Breitbart's site, but that's not even as bad as the quotes are.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.320]  They say Congress has nothing to do with it, and its international permission is where they get the authority.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:51.320]  They said, no bomb is saying I'm a dictator. He says, the UN's my boss.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.320]  Now, there are 850 comments on this, and there are similar comments at Infowars.com,
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.320]  but we're crawling with Cointel Pro and people trying to cause in-fighting.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:07.320]  But here it is. 850 comments. During breaks, I've gone through about 100 of these, almost every one of them.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:12.320]  Let me scroll down a little bit there. He says, Panetta needs to be arrested immediately.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:19.320]  He has breached his responsibility to our Constitution and is a direct threat to the nation as any terrorist.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:27.320]  This man is a criminal, death to tyrants. That's an old saying going back to Rome and the founding fathers.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:32.320]  So are the rest of his administration. The entire administration is a bunch of traitors and enemies of this country.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:41.320]  I'm reading you quotes here. How about our military that just sits there and lets us poor Americans pay and watch our Constitution go up in flames?
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:46.320]  How about you get up and speak out? I guess you are. I cannot believe that I'm reading this for the record.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:52.320]  I'm an active duty officer. Look at this. Number one, Leon Panetta was telling the senior senator,
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:57.320]  a senator that Congress has absolutely no voice. That's right. See, the headline's wrong.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:02.320]  We don't need an article saying, they tell them, you have no voice. That's what they say. This officer gets what they say.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:08.320]  It's unbelievable. They're not even playing patty cake with the little idiot senators anymore who've been arty gays and treason.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:13.320]  They're all involved too. What do they expect is going to happen? Where do they think this road leads?
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:20.320]  Senators were actually having to catch their breath. This is so amazing and it's not even a news issue.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:29.320]  Number one, Leon Panetta was telling the senator that Congress has absolutely no voice and the president's choosing to go to war.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:37.320]  Congress has a voice in sustaining a war, not initiating one. Point being, the Barack Obama can choose just like Bush to go to war without congressional approval.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.320]  See, this poor officer doesn't understand that that wasn't even before. That was how they told them all that.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:50.320]  Congress has to direct it. Now, Congress passed laws that if we were attacked, suddenly the president could respond in those circumstances.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:58.320]  But that's still congressional control. If we were to stay in active combat over a period of time, I believe 90 days Congress has to approve further operations.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.320]  Yeah, that's the War Powers Act. This is important as Leon Panetta is the president's liaison for combat.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:12.320]  If Leon Panetta says we'll need to unilaterally go to war with Syria, Obama could say go. Mr. Sessions doesn't get a say, at least not at first.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:19.320]  And then it goes on. So the military, that person's not fully understanding it.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:25.320]  Congress did give Bush approval for both Iraq and Afghanistan. Look it up. So now they're explaining that. And they did.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:32.320]  But it wasn't a proper declaration. People argued, well, now they won't even get an authorization. Now that's happening.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:43.320]  And then it goes on here with people saying, you know, the Constitution is being shredded before our eyes.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:50.320]  It goes on to say the top brass, the military are just as corrupt as anyone in politics. It's all about power and prestige.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:04:01.320]  And most anyone above the rank of 08 looks only into ensuring their retirement and future in government.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:11.320]  And it just goes on here. So forever they've tried to train people that, oh, you know, the president can launch a war without congressional approval, which is total treason.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:19.320]  Now they're saying, oh, he gets it from the UN. Read the Constitution.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:30.320]  That's why whenever America was attacked in the past, you had to get a declaration of war. But then Korea, Vietnam, right through, it just became Gulf of Tonkin Resolutions.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:43.320]  A resolution of force. And then the power started drifting to the president. And the globalist always wanted that so the president could be a foreign puppet and engaged in puppeteering our military.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:50.320]  And this is it. So now they're going to teach the military, not only does the president launch wars without Congress, well, the Ys are even a Congress.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:05:01.320]  Now it's the president launches it because the UN's our boss. And you're going to see the military come out the brass and say, that's right. We just saw it in Congress.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:29.320]  They so pride in every stage. Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:39.320]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it. Other stone.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:52.320]  We turned jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality. Our defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:25.320]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:39.320]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:35.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, I struggle for the proper words to describe what's happening. If you just joined us, multiple Senators and House members like Representative Jones have come out and said that this is unconstitutional, that it violates the Constitution, and that it's a usurpation of our Republic and an impeachable offense.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:59.320]  It goes beyond an impeachable offense. It is a treacherous war against our Republic. I was reading from the Encyclopedia Britannica earlier on crossing the Rubicon by Julius Caesar that it was an act of war prescribed in Latin as coup d'etat.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:22.320]  When he declared that he was over the military forces of the city-state that ruled the Empire. That was January 10th, 49 BC. Now, last year, and I have the date here in the article by Paul Joseph Watson, Obama sent a letter to Congress when they said you have to get approval.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:44.320]  And he said, you can read it. You can read the letter. Link to it right here. On infowarsteam.com, on whitehouse.gov. He said, I don't need congressional approval. You don't have authority over the presidency. I get my authority from the United Nations and members of the House sued him over to 10 members.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:10:01.320]  This is a coup d'etat. And the brass came in and the Secretary of Defense came in and they said international permission is where we get our authority. They didn't just say the president is a dictator.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:19.320]  They didn't just say that. They said we get it from the United Nations. Now, I want to hear from active duty, National Guard, Marines, Army, but I really want to hear from officers. And by the way, I'm online on big news sites that are starting to report this.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:32.320]  Well, they're like, oh, there's a battle between Congress and the president. It's a political debate about who runs the military. If there's no debate. And I'm seeing the comments going, I'm an army officer. I'm an army captain. I'm a Marine Corps colonel.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:44.320]  And I'm telling you, this is illegal. Let me read to you what Congressman Jones said. And we're going to go to Paul Watson and then the military calling in the toll free number for active duty. What do you think we should do about this?
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:58.320]  This is an open coup against America. Like we're some third world country, but it's a bunch of lawyers going, oh, it's not the military seizing the Congress. They just walk in and say, oh, we now just do whatever the UN says in NATO.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:09.320]  And the senator's like, I'm having trouble catching my breath. I mean, the senators are actually going, huh? Because they know these wars were launched last year without approval. That's illegal and treason.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:26.320]  But now they're being told it's for the UN and they're going, huh? Let me catch my breath here because I was watching this this morning. I didn't see this last night and I had trouble talking.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:37.320]  And I guess for the average America that only cares about whatever football game or basketball games on, I guess I am bad because I'm like, oh, you don't want to UN run the military. It's no big deal.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:55.320]  I've been to so many urban warfare drills where they've got our troops trained with foreign troops for operations here in America. And now they admit they'll use troops from 15 nations here in LA09 and other documents to deal with, quote, civil insurrection and political dissonance.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:06.320]  FEMA is hiring internment specialists for the U.S. for political dissonance. It's all admitted. And this is like a minor footnote. I've got the New York Times today going, there's a little fight between the legislative.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:19.320]  The legislative and executive about who runs wars. No, no, no, no, no. There's not a fight about that. That was settled when the country was founded as Congress. This is beyond that. They're saying the UN and NATO call the shots.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:31.320]  Do you understand? Just like Michael News saying, you know, 15 years ago, why am I under UN command over here? Why is a UN officer commanding me? It was fundamental. People like, oh, whatever, let the UN command you.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:43.320]  Now you see where it leads. And everything they've done is to get us ready for this. Folks, if they can do this, they can do anything. Have you not? That's why courts are ruling. They can come in your house without warrants.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:53.320]  Download your cell phone without warrants. I mean, it's all happening. The toll free number to join us for military personnel out there. I want to hear what you have to say to this.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:13:02.320]  I mean, you've got to speak out. You've got to write letters. You've got to shoot YouTube videos. You've got to go public. You've got to march. Your country is under attack from within. Enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:11.320]  Our republic is openly, they're declaring it. It already happened, but now they're declaring the UN gives the president orders.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:27.320]  Go read the quotes on info wars.com. Go watch the video. I'm going to play it after I take calls. Breaking news. Representative Jones puts Obama on notice.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:35.320]  Walter Jones, Congress, North Carolina, third district in the house of representatives. This is from his website.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:47.320]  Mr. Jones submitted the following concurrent resolution, which was referred to the committee on the judiciary. In fact, guys, dig this bill up for me.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:14:05.320]  Chris has got it and put it on screen for folks. It's the 112th Congress, 2011, 2012, h.con.rez.107ih. This is like defibrillators on the heart of the republic. It's in cardiac arrest. Get them in there.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:14.320]  The military speaking out. That's your duty. The republic, the constitution is being openly stomped and desecrated in front of you.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:26.320]  You've got to say no. This is it. And the reason we speak out now, we've known this has been happening for a while, but now it's so brazen, it's actually got Congress out of their coma for five seconds.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:34.320]  Now, let me read to you what Congressman Walter Jones said. I think he was on a few years ago.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:45.320]  Concurrent resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that the use of offensive military force for the president without prior and clear authorization of an act of Congress constitute an impeachable high crime.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:59.320]  High crime folks. You know what a high crime is? You know what they do with a high crime? You know what they do for treason? This is from the House member. Hope his plane doesn't blow up. Hope he doesn't slip on a banana peel.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:13.320]  We've all got to stand up together. I'm doing it. Jones is doing it. Is it only the Joneses around here and the Pauls around here that are men? Where are you, military? Where are you when the country is going to hell in a handbasket?
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:21.320]  You better believe I'm risking my life right now.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:35.320]  Expressing the sense of the Congress that the use of offensive military force by a president without prior and clear authorization of an act of Congress constitutes an impeachable high crime misdemeanor under Article 2, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:46.320]  Whereas all these military, I see debating on the sites whether or not they can do this. This isn't even about the president launching an attack if we're hit. Congress has given them that authority so they don't have to call Congress in.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:16:01.320]  And people said that was dangerous, see where it leads. This is the president saying, I follow the U.N. and NATO. Okay? In fact, Jones doesn't even get it. It's worse than that. It's a foreign coup d'etat.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:08.320]  That's why the president isn't allowed to do this stuff because they could get an agent in and they have.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:19.320]  Oh, man. Whereas the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congress's exclusive power to declare war, the cornerstone of the Republic. That's right.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:28.320]  The cornerstone of the Republic. I'm going to say that again. The cornerstone founding fathers said that.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:39.320]  And I'm reading military brass debating whether Obama can do this. All you got to do is go read Constitution, dummy, that you swore an oath to.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:46.320]  The good news is most of the military is awake. 9 out of 10 comments from the military I'm reading are just like totally awake.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:54.320]  Whereas the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congress's exclusive power to declare war under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11. Let me say that to the military again.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:01.320]  The cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congress's exclusive power to declare war under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:08.320]  Now, therefore, be it resolved by the House of Representatives, this Senate concurring. The Senate is now concurred with this.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:14.320]  Okay? There's a Senate bill. Senate's on board. This is the sense of Congress that accept in response to an actual or imminent attack.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:33.320]  That's ICBMs coming in against the territory of the United States. The use of offensive military force by a president without prior and clear authorization of an act of Congress violates Congress's exclusive power to declare war under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:48.320]  Whereas constitutes an impeachable high crime in misdemeanor under Article 2, Section 4 of the Constitution. And it goes on. No debating. No debating. No, no, no. There is no discussion. This is high treason and beyond.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:18:02.320]  This is treachery. Because you can argue it's not treason if you're really a foreign agent. It's espionage. Obama, Panetta, the brass that goes along with this are all guilty of espionage by the corporate crime syndicate Mafia known as the New World Order.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:12.320]  And I've had it. I want our republic back. If they get away with this, what do you think's next? Secret arrest of citizens, shutdown of free speech, all of it, and all the bondage that comes with it.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:24.320]  And I've sworn on the altar of God, a total resistance to these people. You're like, why are you getting upset? You men get upset for these times, not for going to some football game and getting angry.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:37.320]  I'm skipping this break because I've got a bunch of military officers and others calling in right now. Current Marine Army, former retired officers, but I want to hear, we're going to go to, I want to bring Watson up here.
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:48.320]  Watson, this is just, same thing in England where you're at. They've signed over your country's control to the EU and now they've signed it over to private banks. This is coup d'etat by banker.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:58.320]  Obama launches banker coup over US. I mean, that's not words. That's what it is, Watson. How incredible is this?
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:18.320]  Well, Alex, I think they're going to use it, even if they have a battle over it and, you know, you win the right to not have the UN and NATO in control of US affairs and they're just going to use that impactful to then attack Syria without the UN. So you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:22.320]  We are, Paul. We must have called. Did we call your cell phone?
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:32.320]  Nice to have you. I want to talk to you about this. I want to get you connected via Skype. I told him to get you on the phone because I wanted to tell you what I want, but your phone's really breaking up.
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:45.320]  Maybe back off of it a bit. Listen, we need to go with the headline and call this what it is. Globalist launch coup over US sees war powers or globalist coup declares Congress dissolved.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:53.320]  I mean, because, you know, they kept the Roman center around for hundreds of years, but it just wasn't there anymore. And that's what this is.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:20:02.320]  The globalist globalist coup d'etat Congress declared completely ceremonial. I mean, we and listen, I want the phone numbers to the house and the Senate.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:09.320]  And I want to call on people to speak out against this. I mean, especially military officers that are.
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:15.320]  I mean, will they follow any order? Will they do anything they're told, Paul?
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:20.320]  It's amazing. I agree.
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:26.320]  Well, the good news is I'm seeing the military comments all over different news sites and they know it's wrong.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:31.320]  But some of them are in there saying I'm military and the president is allowed to do this in the UN. We've signed treaties.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:35.320]  So the UN's above Congress. Congress can't shine away our authority.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:42.320]  I mean, they can't pass a law saying black people are slaves. Again, laws that are fraudulent are null and void.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:52.320]  All these years, Paul, we watched the world government be built. Now they're launching it, but simultaneously we're cooks to talk about it, even as it happens, Paul.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:21:06.320]  The problem is, Alex, they'll be hijacked by all the neocons who will then say, right, now we've established the justification to attack Iran and Syria. We don't need the UN to do it.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:14.320]  Well, I mean, that's the debate there is that, oh, well, you know, the UN has said no to Syria because the Russians vetoed it.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:23.320]  And so now they're saying that Congress is like, well, we don't need the authority. They're like, yeah, but we need the authority from the international community because they signed on to that.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:32.320]  But the lawyer trick is to set the precedent that Congress isn't involved. It's just incredible. It is so massive.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:37.320]  Paul Watson, we need to get, I know you're churning articles out. You've got the article out.
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:50.320]  Pentagon launches desperate damage control over shocking Panetta testimony. It's got all the quotes and the video in there, and it's got Obama coming out and saying he doesn't need Congress anymore with the White House press release.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:22:02.320]  But you notice even in the Pentagon saying that they're clarifying it, they still imply they're getting the authority from the UN, and that's what Obama said in his letter.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:11.320]  Yeah, no, that's what he used to send a letter to a manor, the Speaker of the House, last year saying, I don't need Congress.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:16.320]  I don't even need to think about the constitutional question. That was his paraphrase quote.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:26.320]  And he said, I get my authority from the UN Security Council. So screw you, Congress is basically what he said. And now they're doing it again.
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:36.320]  But now they're marching into Congress with the generals all lined up, with wily looks all telling Congress, no, you have no authority when it's right in the Constitution.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:57.320]  What's amazing is the fact that sessions repeatedly five or six times said, yes, yes, but let's establish that Congress as the authority in Panetta just would not acknowledge it. So then they had to put out this weak report today saying, oh, it was misinterpreted and then just restating the fact that it wasn't misinterpreted.
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:11.320]  Listen to this exactly how he said it. Well, it's total, it's total treason out in the open. And if the military, I mean, I better see the military go public. I better see everybody in the military should shoot YouTube videos.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:19.320]  It's your right in duty to hold up the Constitution and say Congress funds and directs and tells the president what to do. He then becomes commander in chief.
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:30.320]  And you can read what congressmen have said that this is a high crime. You can read and then let them try to go after you. You watch, they'll probably try behind the scenes to threaten you. Let them.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:44.320]  I mean, how do you men and women go into combat and get given deadly shots and run up hills with the machine gun nest and all of this. But then when the country's in trouble, will you morally just say, I'm not going to be part of this treason?
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:56.320]  I mean, it's that simple. Look, I'm and don't say, Oh, no, Alex, we can get in trouble. Folks, what do you think I can happen to me? You just saw him kill Breitbart. My gut tells me they did the evidence is there.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:04.320]  You've seen all the other dirty tricks are trying to, you know, destroy Limbaugh right now. They're trying to arrest Rupert Murdoch. Not that those are even great guys, people like Rupert Murdoch.
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:15.320]  The point is the old guards getting thrown out the new times here. And we got a bunch of globalist revolutionary criminals that are engaged in all sorts of crimes doing everything they can to bring this country down.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:24.320]  And it's now time for people to put up or shut up. If you won't stand up to this, then just get ready, folks, because the sky's the limit. Paul Watson.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:36.320]  When's the next big article coming out on the public coup launched at Congress declared ceremonial Obama and you and declare Congress ceremonial?
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:44.320]  I mean, it's it. I mean, the country's gone. I mean, that this is it. There's no debating and watch. Notice all the censorship starting right now.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:53.320]  Notice all the talk of secret arrest is starting. Notice the drones are in the skies and the armies on checkpoints and TSA is everywhere because they're getting ready to blow up a bunch of stuff.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:25:01.320]  Folks, false flags and blaming on domestic grips. It's here. It's going to happen. Reeducation camps, everything.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.320]  Paul.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.320]  Yeah, it will go as soon as possible.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.320]  All right. Thank you so much.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:10.320]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:13.320]  All right, there goes Paul Watson.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:18.320]  All right, let's go to the military calls here. We've got
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:27.320]  Sergeant in the National Guard, Dante, we've got TJ, retired officer military, got Nathan, North Carolina, current Marine.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:32.320]  We got Zachary, current National Guard.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:41.320]  We've got others coming in military current officers, especially but former officers to give your constitutional fact or statement.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:46.320]  Current people. What are you going to do? I mean, I'm here saying call Congress.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:51.320]  I'm here telling the military stand up and just speak out. I mean, this is brazenly illegal.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:54.320]  Who do we go to first here?
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.320]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:59.320]  Let's go to Nathan, who's a current Marine.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:08.320]  Nathan, what is your take on this? Are you as concerned as I am or is it good to have the UN openly telling Congress it doesn't matter?
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:09.320]  Hello, can you hear me?
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:10.320]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:17.320]  Oh my God, Alex, this is so crazy. I'm totally agreeing with you 100% that I had hope this day wouldn't come.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:21.320]  I've been following you for about a year now and every day it just gets worse.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:25.320]  You know, to the point I'd stop watching every day because it's scary almost.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:31.320]  I've been watching about once a week on the show and stuff like that and it's terrible.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.320]  And I feel really small. It's not much I can do.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.320]  You know, I tell everybody I can, but other than that, there's really not much else I can do.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:45.320]  I hope, like you said, that it turns around or else this is going to get bad really quick.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:54.320]  Why do you think they would have Panetta and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman come in and over and over again say, no, the UN gives us the authority for war?
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.320]  I mean, you could debate the President. Obviously, that's illegal.
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:02.320]  But now they're saying the UN and NATO? I mean, this is incredible.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.320]  This is really scary, Alex.
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:10.320]  Like, wouldn't it be happened? You know, I was all over that. Like, you know, obviously that's illegal.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:16.320]  You know, you've got the NATO Nobel Prize for Peace for that. Can you believe that?
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.320]  Anyways, yeah.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:23.320]  So you're a current Marine or other Marines concerned?
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:30.320]  A few of them, yeah. It's not something you can really talk about unless you're behind closed doors here.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.320]  But yeah, I have a few supporters.
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.320]  I mean, what if the President says, start taking the guns? There's a point you're going to have to speak up.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:44.320]  I mean, look, if the President says he gets his orders from the UN, is your chain of command the United Nations soldier?
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.320]  That's what I'm asking you, Marine.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:53.320]  I will not ever fire American citizens. I will never do that. If he would ever comes, I'm gone.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:28:01.320]  But I mean, that's the point we're at here, where they're saying the UN gives the President his orders when it's the Congress gives him his orders.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:10.320]  I appreciate your call. Look, it's time to start bare minimum blacking out your face, you know, in shadow and doing YouTube's and talking about it.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:17.320]  But I mean, what are they going to do to you if you publicly say the President gets his orders from the UN?
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:25.320]  I mean, you can't follow his orders. He's an open, foreign espionage asset. It's a coup.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:38.320]  Those aren't words, man. This is happening. The senators couldn't breathe. They were having trouble breathing. I mean, this is, this is, this is hardcore.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:45.320]  Let's go to TJ, retired officer, and I'll go to current military. TJ, your take on this.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:55.320]  Alex Emery is TJ and I'm retired Army staff sergeant, not an officer, but I've been an embassy liaison. It doesn't matter. It's what it said on my computer screen. Go ahead, sir.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:29:08.320]  Okay. You're a great signal core. You are the signal core officer, but we can't win this without combat arms. That's armor, infantry, air defense.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:20.320]  When we get these spray planes out of our sky, when we meet at every meeting in bellicose fashion, face to face with the county commissioners, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:31.320]  And remember this, UN says on and they are done and on and I'll be fighting them on the 27th of March in a formal meeting.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:38.320]  And I hope I got friends with me, but you got to have more in the signal core. You got to have combat arms.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:49.320]  People have to be on the ground in the Info War as Paul reveres everywhere pointing out the open traders. The traders are trying to hide it in plain view. More calls straight ahead. Stay with us.
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:30:01.320]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:13.320]  Folks, Iran and the Middle East nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices. Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Middle East showdown explodes,

[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:05.320]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:09.320]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:20.320]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:29.320]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:36.320]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:41.320]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:46.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:52.320]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:06.320]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:15.320]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:19.320]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:31.320]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:35.320]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:40.320]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:45.320]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:53.320]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:33:10.320]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:18.320]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, we're here live and then I got a big incredibly important nightly news this evening.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:24.320]  They're launching a new propaganda effort to launch a full invasion of Central Africa and other areas.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:28.320]  We're going to be breaking that down in some State Department propaganda we've discovered.
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:36.320]  We'll also be going more over this, but we can't get the military calls in because 9 out of 10 are people saying,
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.320]  well, I'm not the military, I'm not current military, but I got a point I want to make.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:46.320]  Folks, I'm going to institute full call screening if people just don't have basic respect here.
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:58.320]  Our country is in a deep crisis. I want to talk to current serving military and ask them if they're going to follow illegal orders
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:04.320]  and if they realize how treasonous this is to have a coup d'etat with the Secretary of Defense, the President,
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.320]  the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying they take their orders from the UN and NATO.
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:11.320]  I need to hear from them. I need to hear what the military is saying.
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:17.320]  And the phone systems, of course, when we give the number out, just blast with literally hundreds of calls a minute.
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:20.320]  And I'm not trying to be mad at people. I'm glad you want to call in and say something.
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:23.320]  We can do that after we talk to the military.
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:28.320]  But don't call right now if you're not active in the military because they can't get into the show.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:33.320]  800-259-9231. Of course, no one will listen to me.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:39.320]  They'll just be hung up on, though, folks. So knock yourselves out.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:44.320]  We've got Sergeant National Guard and another National Guard, Zachary.
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:48.320]  And if anybody can get in, I know I always get calls from troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, and in bases.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:53.320]  I want to hear from you. Let's go to Zachary and then we'll go to Dante.
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:58.320]  Zachary, you're on the air. What's your take on the publicly announced coup d'etat,
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.320]  hidden in plain view of the UN and NATO over America?
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:10.320]  It's a pretty sad day for the Republic there, Mr. Jones, but I have a book that I got from, it's the Soldiers Handbook.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:16.320]  Well, I was at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, trade-off pamphlet 600-4, 1 October 2003.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:23.320]  And it says, loyalty, bare truth, faith, and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, your unit, and other soldiers.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:32.320]  It goes on to say to be loyal is to be unswerving and allegiance to the Constitution and completely faithful to the lawful government.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:37.320]  Our absolute allegiance and faithfulness prevents us from misplacing our loyalties.
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:41.320]  And that was 2-2, the next page, 2-3.
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:47.320]  A loyal individual does the following, respects the Constitution and laws, and it goes on.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:53.320]  But the next page, there's a quote for all military members calling in.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:57.320]  It says, duty, fulfill your obligations. This is page 2-5.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:02.320]  There's a quote from General John A. Wickham, former Army Chief of Staff.
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:12.320]  He says, the essence of duty is acting in the absence of orders or direction from others based on an inner sense of what is morally and professionally right.
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:22.320]  It goes on from that quote, duty delineates the sum total of all laws, rules, et cetera, that make up our organizational, civic, and moral obligations.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:30.320]  Our values originate with duty because, at a minimum, we expect all members of the Army to fulfill their obligations.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:35.320]  We often expect individuals to exceed their duty, especially in ethical matters.
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:39.320]  And this certainly is an ethical matter.
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:43.320]  Back up, you know, that's from eight, nine years ago.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.320]  This was 2003, yes.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:57.320]  I've seen, and read on air, stuff from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, where if a president ever tries to use you domestically, they are a traitor and a tyrant.
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:05.320]  Congress is in control of the military. The president-only commander-in-chief once given a duly, you know, sworn bill of war, declaration of war.
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:11.320]  So even what you're reading is okay, but nothing compared to the Constitution itself.
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:26.320]  Did you hear me earlier when I read from the Constitution where a president launching a military operation without full congressional authorization is engaged in a high crime and misdemeanor?
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:32.320]  I mean, though the Constitution tells you what it is, but look, it's bad enough to have a president saying, I do what I want militarily.
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:37.320]  Again, this is them saying the U.N. is the authority and NATO.
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:52.320]  I mean, the president's saying that in the chain of command, see, until about 50 years ago, they taught, until about the Korean War, actually, they taught Congress is at the top of chain of command, then the president, then down to you.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:55.320]  Since then, well, the president during a war, then they kind of blurred that.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:58.320]  And then now, well, we get authorizations, not declarations.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:03.320]  And then now they're saying, listen, Congress, Congress like, but we are who gives you the authorization, correct?
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:07.320]  And the sec death says, no, the U.N. I'm going to play it here in a minute.
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:09.320]  But I mean, what do you make of that?
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.320]  And that is just, that is off the charts right there.
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:20.320]  I mean, just because it's the U.N. or NATO, how about saying Russia gives them the orders or China or, or, or, you know, Martians for that matter.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.320]  I mean, do you see what I'm saying?
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.320]  This is globalism.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.320]  This is world government.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:27.320]  This is a global government coup in our face, sir.
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.320]  Absolutely.
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:35.320]  And as Mary Amchelle Rothschild said, give me the power to coin a nation's currency and I care not who makes its laws.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:40.320]  And of course, one of the planks of the communist manifesto is for a private central bank.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.320]  The whole system is corrupt.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:47.320]  Knowledge is power, power corrupts an absolute power, power corrupts absolutely.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:56.320]  And if that is true, and I'm certain it is, then the media would never tell us the whole truth to anything because we might start to understand the true nature of our predicament.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:03.320]  And thanks to you and your show and all the guests that you have on, we, we understand that humanity is under attack and the whole bioethicist,
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:05.320]  genesis thing that you're talking about.
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:09.320]  Hey, they've used the troops to test vaccines on us.
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:17.320]  There have been soldiers that were, had the full barrage of vaccinations over in desert, desert storm, you know, that, that never went over.
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:21.320]  But yet they came down with the same golf war syndrome as soldiers who went over.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:27.320]  Oh, it's on record. Listen, and they lie to you and say, you don't have any rights. We're going to test experimental shots on you.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:32.320]  They can only make you take totally approved vaccines.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:36.320]  And there's only about 15 or so that are on the FDA recommended list.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:42.320]  So when they test all this dingy fever and this and that and smallpox anthrax shots, but it killed so many people.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:46.320]  Some of you will drop dead from the shots. They had to suspend both of those.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.320]  But let me ask you this question.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:57.320]  You're a sergeant in the National Guard. Obviously, you've got to know, and you're calling in.
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.320]  Where are you calling in from?
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:01.320]  I'm calling in from Maine.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.320]  Okay, so you're calling in from Maine.
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:07.320]  All I know is around here, they're having National Guard do checkpoints and show up at events to acclimate us.
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:09.320]  I mean, are you guys getting more riot control?
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:13.320]  Are you seeing evidence of them gearing you up for domestic operations?
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:21.320]  Well, I can't really speak too much for that. I've worked crowd control at a naval base for an air show.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:23.320]  Yeah, that's one thing on a base is fine.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:29.320]  But I mean, you see like Army Times saying they're going to use the military domestically against citizens, right?
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:32.320]  Oh, I've read it. I keep up to date with the stuff that you post.
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:38.320]  And certainly it was concerning seeing that kite festival that you posted there.
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:46.320]  Yeah, here in Austin, let me ask you this. Are the people in the military around you in the Army National Guard, are they starting to realize something's not right?
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:49.320]  Well, yeah, there definitely is a vibe there.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:41:00.320]  There's certainly some of us that are more awake than others and certainly have questioned for quite some time now the official myth of September 11th and what went down on that day.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:10.320]  And it's pretty obvious we're being lied to and I commend all the work that you've done and the people that are speaking out to bring justice to what happened.
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:17.320]  And thank you for bringing that Syria blogger on the other day. It was great to listen to her and her perspective.
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:23.320]  Let me ask you this question, Zachary, in closing. We'll go to others and I again appreciate you taking the time out to call.
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:31.320]  What should the military do? I mean, if I was in the military, especially an officer, because you've got more responsibilities as you know, to duty than just enlisted.
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:36.320]  And I've sworn enough to protect the Constitution against enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:43.320]  And the cornerstone of treason is a president declaring he controls the military can do it every once.
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:48.320]  And then it goes beyond that saying foreign powers controlling, which is even worse if it's possible.
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:53.320]  I mean, what country has ever had a president or leader that's an actual foreign agent?
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:42:03.320]  That's it's one thing to have your own dictator, but then the person taking on despotic powers is a foreign agent and says so to their bosses in the Congress.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:11.320]  When it comes to military matters, you know, you don't give the president the power of the military unilaterally because you can't be trusted with it.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:21.320]  You've got to share that and have checks and balances. I mean, it's just, it is, it is the worst case of out in the open treason, I can imagine.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:30.320]  And it's flaunted openly. And the New York Times has a little footnote about, oh, there's a little fight between the legislative and executive about who runs things.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:35.320]  It's like, oh, the, you know, price of tea and China discussion, like it's no big deal.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:41.320]  And then it's, oh, man, it's exhausting me mentally.
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:53.320]  Oh, yeah, it is. It is exhausting. But to answer your question there about, you know, ideally what should be done is the example that was set a couple of weeks ago in Afghanistan with the Karanbort burning.
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:43:00.320]  You had all those people in the streets, you know, protesting and voicing their, you know, concerns over that.
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:15.320]  And it would never happen. But if people dressed in uniform went down to the federal buildings or wherever and had signed in uniforms and said it's treason, you know, have the quotes from, from, from the guy there, Panetta, you know, we don't answer to the UN.
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:20.320]  You know, if we get on the streets in mass and just said, hey, we've had enough, we're not doing it.
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:30.320]  I'll tell you where the digital streets are, YouTube, uh, letters to the editor. And then if they try to go out for somebody, you've got congressman coming out saying it's a high crime.
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:39.320]  And you're like, look, Mike, my so-called commander in chief, who's not your commander in chief because there's no declared war, is telling me he gets orders from the UN.
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:46.320]  The UN and NATO is not in my chain of command. It doesn't command America. God bless you. I appreciate you calling.
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:55.320]  I mean, we've got now that the gauntlets down. I mean, they're not hiding this and they're saying the UN runs America and that Congress doesn't count.
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:07.320]  I mean, come on, Congress in the House and Senate have finally introduced legislation saying we might impeach you. You've got to do that.
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:12.320]  I mean, even that corrupt body knows this. This is, this is incredible.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:28.320]  You imagine the Russians as corrupt as their government is coming out, a Russian president saying to the Duma, to their Congress, uh, I'm going to launch a war in, say, Georgia or Chechnya or Ukraine or against Poland.
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:39.320]  And the Duma says, well, you didn't get authorization from us. And they say, oh, but I got it from the USA or I got it from China or I got it from Bangladesh.
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:52.320]  I mean, it would be instantly that there'd be an outcry from the Russians. They'd be in the streets. The military would outcry. They would, they would arrest Putin like, like that.
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:59.320]  Just boom, he'd be arrested or his helicopter would blow up. That's how the Russians do it. He would die.
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:04.320]  Alexander Lebed was caught sneaking around working with the West and his helicopter blew up.
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:11.320]  But again, we're not dealing with puppet presidents here. Obama is just a little corporate, horrid, new world order lawyer.
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:21.320]  It's a bunch of lawyers, man, and they create these international bodies and have traders sign over like a lawyer stealing your portfolio or you got to trust the lawyer signs your house over themselves.
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:32.320]  That happens all the time. That's what they've done. They just signed America over and sit there arrogantly like the pigs they are in front of Congress.
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:40.320]  And the Congress is like, well, we know we're just a little sellout criminals that you've got blackmailed for insider trading, but don't publicly announce we don't run anything now.
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:44.320]  That's embarrassing. I want to feel powerful at the country club today playing golf.
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:52.320]  But that is like, yeah, you don't run Jack Squat, pal. I haven't even gotten to the video yet. It's at infowars.com.
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:46:01.320]  I'm exhausted. I don't know how I'm into the nightly news. I'm beyond angry. It is just, it's like, it'd be like if you're walking down the street and they had babies out live,
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:09.320]  hanging by their feet and we're saying, hey, you want some fresh meat and they were chopping babies up like fish with big meat cleavers.
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:16.320]  And everybody's just walking by with shopping bags going up and being wrapped in white paper. I mean, it's that crazy.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:21.320]  And everybody just goes along with their business like, oh, it's no big deal.
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:27.320]  Secretary of Defense Obama, all of them say the UN tells us what to do. It's nothing.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:34.320]  And it's like England. 80 plus percent of their laws are now made by foreign EU, which isn't even the EU countries.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:37.320]  That's made by the bureaucracy and the EU countries are being told now.
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:42.320]  Foreign banks run us and you have no national sovereignty.
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:49.320]  And the military and police are following orders and NATO controls Europe and says they're the world army now.
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:53.320]  It's the global government army and our army is part of it.
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:47:02.320]  And those generals sit there getting off on it and showing satisfaction when Panetta tells them we take our orders from NATO and the UN.
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:12.320]  And I'm watching the generals and I'm watching their adjuncts behind them and their minions and they're all look like Cheshire cats so satisfied.
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:15.320]  Oh, man, these people are traitors.
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:19.320]  I mean, and I don't just use that word. These are enemies of our country.
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:28.320]  I'm getting a headache.
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:33.320]  Dante, Sergeant in the National Guard, sir, what is your take on this?
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:38.320]  I mean, am I wrong? Is it good to have the Secretary of Defense and Obama announced we follow the UN?
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:41.320]  They're our boss now.
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:45.320]  Well, I guess if you're following the Communist Manifesto, that'd be a good thing to have.
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:52.320]  But for the rest of us over here that actually value our liberty and our freedoms and actually try to stand up to that type of tyranny.
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.320]  It's not a good thing at all.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:00.320]  I've actually been following the show since I was about 15 years old. I'm 21 now and I've held public screenings.
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:04.320]  I've held public viewings. I've spoken to my soldiers, the people in my direction and command.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:11.320]  And for the most part, outside of the people in my direct community where I rest my head at, it's like a joke to a lot of the people in my unit.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:17.320]  They're just like, okay, haha, I'm going to go home and go to sleep now. You know, it's okay because it's the President.
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:20.320]  He knows what he's doing. If you don't trust him, you should get out of the military.
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:25.320]  Well, I'm not in the military for the commander and the chief. I'm in the military to defend my country.
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:27.320]  That's just why I joined.
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:35.320]  Oh, yeah, the Germans. There was a debate in Germany about, no, you're supposed to follow the Constitution, the Weimar Republic, the Reichstag,
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.320]  and then Hitler had them all change the oath to him.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:43.320]  I guess that's what they, wow, so you're saying they're ready to do it. They're ready to do whatever they're told.
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:52.320]  I mean, here in Jersey, there's different units. My unit in particular, let's say out of 100,000 guys, let's just use that number out of 100,000.
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:59.320]  About 75,000 would probably just stand there and do what they're told because, you know, their mentality is okay, whatever.
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:06.320]  I'm going to do this and I'm going to go home. And I'm looking at these guys like, what are you going to do when the areas that are being targeted and the people that are being groped
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:09.320]  and the weapons that are being taken are yours. What are you going to do then?
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:12.320]  And they're looking at me like, oh, this guy's a nut. It'll never happen.
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:17.320]  And, you know, I'm already under surveillance as it is Alex when my first tour to Iraq was in 1809.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:21.320]  You know, I was under surveillance for listening to the Alex Jones show overseas just because I'm Muslim.
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:23.320]  They thought I was going to do something crazy.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:29.320]  I came back and now I'm about to go over to Afghanistan again to put my life on the line for the bull mass.
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:34.320]  And I'm under surveillance again. I get followed home sometimes. My roommate's been followed home sometimes.
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:39.320]  My girlfriend, you know, it's ridiculous, Alex. And I'm not going to stand for it.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:44.320]  I dare somebody to tell me to turn a weapon on an innocent U.S. citizen to start confiscating weapons,
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:53.320]  especially in a state where you have to go through six to seven months' trials to be able to carry a weapon with a permit or even purchase a rifle or a shotgun to go hunting.
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:56.320]  So I wish somebody would.
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.320]  Well, God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:08.320]  That's that's a sad testament that 70 plus percent think everything's a joke. But remember, it's always the minority, the three to five percent that says no to tyranny.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:18.320]  All I know is that they're not announcing this to the Senate for no reason.
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:21.320]  Everything is thought out by Panetta and the Joint Jesus staff.
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:27.320]  The fact that they would march in there in front of their bosses are representatives that work for them.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:29.320]  Representatives that work for us.
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:37.320]  We're at the top of the pyramid in this country and the Congress and the president and the courts.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:42.320]  The fact that they would do that.
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:48.320]  The fact that they it just shows that they're getting ready to pull the trigger on some big stuff.
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:51:00.320]  There is some good news in the House of Senate legislation has been introduced by Republicans and Democrats to begin the process of impeachment against Barack Hussein, the traitor Obama.
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:24.320]  But take heart for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:29.320]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:33.320]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:36.320]  The globalist are scared they've overreached.
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:39.320]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:26.320]  Now I would just change the song to say, preemptive war, what is it good for? Absolutely nothing.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:34.320]  You lose the moral authority and you become the enemy. Again, this is not our government.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:43.320]  It's illegitimate, but it dresses like us, it acts like us. That's why Cicero, you guys reprint me the full Cicero quote on the trader.
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:50.320]  Cicero, the trader is the plague. That'll bring it up, Roman philosopher, historian.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:58.320]  The trader knows how to dress like you, talk like you, talk like us, and that's all this is, is treason by lawyers.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:08.320]  And again, I'm going to play it in the next hour. The video is up at infowars.com, the audio, the transcript, I've read from it.
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:15.320]  Members of Congress in the House and Senate have introduced legislation, putting them on notice of moves for impeachment.
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:22.320]  If the president won't just say, yes, Congress gives me the authority to launch wars, but Obama wouldn't say it last year.
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:27.320]  And I was like, wow, that's big. And now he's saying it again to their faces.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:36.320]  That's putting them on notice, that's a legal precedent. And it is by every historical measurement a coup against the Republic.
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:46.320]  A coup by a dictator if Obama tried it. But it's a foreign coup.
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:51.320]  Here's the Daily Mail. I won't follow Obama's unlawful orders. Marine could be disciplined over Facebook outbursts.
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:56:02.320]  The Marine Corps is looking into whether Sergeant Gary Stein broke military rules when he declared on Facebook that he would not follow orders from the commander-in-chief, President Obama.
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:10.320]  While Stein sobbed his statement on the Armed Forces Tea Party Patriot page to say that he would not follow unlawful orders, military observers say he may have gone too far.
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:16.320]  It's all part of discipline. And what did he specifically say he wouldn't follow?
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:22.320]  So that they don't even want you to know in here what it is that he said, is he even talking about this?
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:29.320]  Let them start trying to discipline people that say they won't follow orders from the UN.
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:35.320]  He says, Armed Forces Tea Party myself has gone and rubbed some people the wrong way with the Marine Corps.
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:41.320]  Someone is mad because of a comment I stated Obama was a domestic enemy of our oath speaks of.
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:46.320]  It was not meant to be disrespectful towards the President. He's not our President. He is a globalist operative.
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:49.320]  Although we do believe that his policies are crippling this country.
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:53.320]  So this isn't, I'm sure this has to do with energy or something like that.
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:55.320]  Again, that's a complete side issue. Thank you guys.
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:57:00.320]  That's a complete side issue that they brought in here, but I'm glad he did bring it in.
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:03.320]  Obama is a nothing puppet.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:09.320]  All right, I see that we have Martinez, who's a Marine.
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:14.320]  We have Mike in New York, who's US Army. We haven't talked to regular Army yet.
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:22.320]  It's been a bunch of National Guard. Dustin in Texas, who's Army, Private Jay, National Guard, some other Marines and people.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:28.320]  I'm going to get to all of you. I've done one hour and 57 minutes of radio and haven't really plugged anything.
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:37.320]  Lately, you've noticed I'm not even plugging books, videos, infowarsteam.com, because I'm just, the news is so insane.
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:40.320]  And the guys come to me and say, Hey, we're not selling a lot of books and videos.

[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:26.320]  On the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:32.320]  We do have some good news. You know, the video's got about a million views right now.
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:37.320]  Breaking down all the scanners are totally fake. You can carry bombs in them, everything.
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:43.320]  The TSA had the video blocked, but due to outrage, it was unblocked this morning.
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:49.320]  The TSA is making fun of the American citizens on their blog right now.
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:56.320]  TSA mocks viral videos as able to detect threats such as, you know, things that go boom.
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.320]  Talking to us at a three-year-old level, they do that on purpose to dumb the language down.
[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:08.320]  It's all part of their psych warfare attack on for humanity.
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:13.320]  Let's go back to military calls because it's the military. I should ask police.
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:16.320]  I guess you'll follow any order. The feds are federalizing everything.
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:20.320]  I confirm there's now TSA inspectors of all the police departments and on the streets.
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:25.320]  They're the boss. Everyone's like, the federal inspectors coming. They tell us what to do.
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:30.320]  Because they're unbonded, unsworn, not even federal agents.
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:34.320]  And the UN orders are president around now.
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:39.320]  And the president tells Congress they have no authority over war now.
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:44.320]  Just unbelievable treason and a coup d'etat. That's what's really happening.
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:49.320]  Those aren't just words. Martinez in California, welcome and thank you for holding, sir.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:53.320]  You're a Marine. What's your view on what we've been talking about?
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:56.320]  Actually, Alex, I'm a woman.
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:58.320]  Well, it says Marine there.
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:00.320]  Yes, it does. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:05.320]  I started United States Marine Corps work on Camp Pendleton and Del Mar area.
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:08.320]  I don't think that this is right at all. It's wrong.
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:12.320]  It's like everything inside me is screaming what the heck is going on.
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:14.320]  You know, I've been listening to you for a while.
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:18.320]  My brother actually introduced me to your show and, you know, I actually do a lot of research.
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:21.320]  And, you know, I don't think that it's right at all.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:25.320]  I mean, people need to wake up and people need to, you know what?
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:30.320]  Actually, I need to tell you this. People who, you know, they actually swear in,
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:32.320]  they're in the military. They don't even research the Constitution.
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:35.320]  They don't even know that they're supposed to really uphold it.
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:42.320]  They don't know the depth of the responsibility that they have to the people to defend them.
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:45.320]  You know, just in case, like, just something go wrong.
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:51.320]  And, you know, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to educate my troops on the Constitution
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:56.320]  and on the Bill of Rights, the rights that they have, you know, the rights of the people have,
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:03:00.320]  and that, you know, what's going on isn't right.
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:07.320]  I mean, you know, some people tell me I should be careful and not to go around talking about all this stuff.
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:12.320]  Sounds like what happened in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia when the military was being told follow illegal orders.
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:17.320]  Look, it's in the Constitution. As you know, I read the articles earlier.
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:21.320]  You've got a House and Senate bill telling the president, hey, we can impeach you.
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:27.320]  Again, it's the Congress that impeaches the president because the founders knew a bigger body of people
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:30.320]  is harder to take over and they represent the states.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:36.320]  So they've been teaching for 100 years, co-equal, legislative, executive, judicial.
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:39.320]  That was never taught until about 1910 or so.
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:42.320]  And then it didn't become the dominant theme the last 20, 30 years.
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:48.320]  The Congress is above the president. The Congress is above the legislative.
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:54.320]  They're not co-equal. They are the lawmakers and the purse holders, okay?
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:58.320]  The president executes things. That's it.
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:05.320]  And the courts look at laws to see if they're constitutional as a check on the Congress and on the president.
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:12.320]  So I don't know how to explain it. And then the legislative, they approve of the judiciary.
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:15.320]  So it's a check on them. It's all about checks and balances.
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:20.320]  But of the three, the dominant is the Congress because it's the most diverse.
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:22.320]  And I'm going to hold you. I want to come back and talk to you here.
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:27.320]  And we'll try to hurry the others that are patiently holding.
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:31.320]  Oh, no. She's still there, but one of the people just hung up.
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:34.320]  So another person's calling in right now. We'll take that call.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:40.320]  We're going to get to Dustin, Private Jay, talking to Martinez, a lady in the Marine Corps.
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:44.320]  Mike is up next after Martinez. We're going to get to all of you, then Private Jay and others.
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:51.320]  But look, just what she said, they do not read it.
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:57.320]  It's just like, yes, I swear an oath to it. It's there for a reason, okay?
[02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:01.320]  And what the president's done is totally illegal.
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:07.320]  This is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:12.320]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:18.320]  It's true. Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:23.320]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:07.320]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:12.320]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:21.320]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:29.320]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:34.320]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:39.320]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:46.320]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:50.320]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection

[02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:22.320]  Gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:27.320]  I don't need Congress to launch wars, I get my authority from the UN, and I take their orders.
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:29.320]  I've read the quotes here.
[02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:34.320]  When you have the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman agreeing with that and the SEC DEF, Secretary of Defense,
[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:39.320]  telling the Senate Armed Services Committees and others that,
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:42.320]  yeah, no, you have no authority, you don't matter.
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:47.320]  That isn't just the President crossing the Rubicon and taking dictatorial powers to himself
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:52.320]  and having Congress pass laws, the President can secretly arrest citizens and kill them
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:55.320]  and we know Obama asked for that and Congress gave it to him.
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:09:00.320]  So, of course, the President's like, well, I'll start arresting reporters then for whistleblowing.
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:06.320]  Well, I'll just have my Secretary of Defense come in and tell you that you have no authority.
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:10.320]  And those senators are like, but that's not true, that's illegal.
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:14.320]  And then it goes, well, that's the way it is.
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:18.320]  And we're talking to the military, the ones that listen to the show who are good men and women,
[02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:21.320]  they're calling in going, yeah, this sounds pretty bad, this sounds like this isn't right.
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:29.320]  I mean, other people in the military aren't reading the Constitution.
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:35.320]  Folks, the Constitution is the law, it's America.
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:40.320]  I mean, I've never heard of a country that wasn't some little third-world country where a foreign group of corporations
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:45.320]  put a puppet president in and then they do things like this, but that's what the new world order is.
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:48.320]  They've done it, the third-world countries, now they're doing it here.
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:56.320]  Now, I was talking to Martinez, was her name, a Marine Sergeant, and she said people are starting to wake up
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:59.320]  and I wanted to talk to her more, but she hung up and I want to thank her for calling in
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:02.320]  and thank her for listening to the show and please keep spreading the word,
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:07.320]  but I wanted to ask her more questions, but she was on camp bells and so she might have had to go.
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:11.320]  Who's been holding the longest? We're going to go to Mike, who's U.S. Army.
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:14.320]  Then we're going to go to Private Jay, who's National Guard.
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:16.320]  Then we're going to go to Dustin, who's U.S. Army.
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:18.320]  Then John, Joe, and others.
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:20.320]  We got a Lieutenant Colonel there.
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:24.320]  Let me skip to Joe first because I want to hear from an officer that I promise we're going to get to.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:28.320]  We're from a Lieutenant Colonel, Anthony Shaffer, three days ago or two days ago saying it's treason.
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.320]  It's illegal.
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:34.320]  What already happened in Libya is Congress is suing the president.
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:37.320]  Why not just start impeaching him?
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:41.320]  Well, Walter Jones in North Carolina has started a sentence concurred,
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:43.320]  but it'll be the legislation.
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:46.320]  Is it news that the beginning process of impeachment has begun?
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:48.320]  No, it's not even in the news.
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:54.320]  Let's hear from that Lieutenant Colonel Joe in Pennsylvania.
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:57.320]  What's your view on this Lieutenant Colonel?
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:04.320]  Yeah, Alex, I looked at that testimony this morning and Secretary of Defense, Panetta,
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:09.320]  just made me sick with how he was acting towards Senator Sessions.
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:14.320]  When I heard that, I just couldn't even think straight because he openly defied him.
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:16.320]  His actions sort of tortured him right there.
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:20.320]  He says, that's illegal and you come to Congress and that's an order.
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:24.320]  And we want to see Congress get more involved than this.
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:28.320]  Sure, I will do our part in the military, but Congress has to get involved.
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:30.320]  The Supreme Court has to get involved.
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:36.320]  And I know we're doing everything we can to talk to our troops and to see what's going to happen
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:38.320]  if an illegal order is given.
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:43.320]  I myself have already personally defied several illegal orders in my career.
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:48.320]  And nothing happened because it was just a promise thing that I did.
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:55.320]  The other men that go along with you, you know, I do our studying on the partisans back in World War II
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:59.320]  against the Germans and they most of them ended up getting shot in the head.
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:05.320]  So it's just not really a simple thing to just say we're going to defy our orders,
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:10.320]  although I personally would not carry out a illegal order.
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:14.320]  Well, Colonel, if it was done early on, Hitler would have been defeated.
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:21.320]  It was by successive approximation, as you know, incrementally then getting the military to swear it off to him,
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:24.320]  not to the Republic, the Weimar Republic, similar to ours.
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:31.320]  The issue here is it's one thing to say no to a Hitler or a Stalin because as bad as they were,
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:33.320]  they were over their country.
[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:35.320]  They weren't under a foreign power.
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:40.320]  With Obama, as they said, NATO in the UN, as you said, Colonel, they defied.
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:46.320]  Here's the boss, here's the senator, I mean, that's who's got the purse, that's who declares war.
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:53.320]  Here is the chairman of the committee saying you do know under the Constitution
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:56.320]  and under the articles that you're under Congress.
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:01.320]  And they said no, we're under NATO, we're under the UN, that's where we get our authority.
[02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:03.320]  And Sessions is like what?
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:07.320]  And they kept saying it and saying it as you know, he was defying him.
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:11.320]  And Congress has the authority to start arresting these people.
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:15.320]  I mean, they don't just have the authority to start impeachment.
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:17.320]  And I'm sorry, people arrest them.
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:22.320]  What are you supposed to do when they come in and say I take my orders from a foreign group?
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:25.320]  I mean, Colonel, your take on that.
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:33.320]  I'm involved in recruiting and I ask every potential recruit whether they would disobey an unlawful order.
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:39.320]  And every one of them said yes, but they said what is an unlawful order?
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:45.320]  And each service has their own courses they give and their own definition of it, so it's very difficult.
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:50.320]  But the key to me, even during NDA, we follow this closely.
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:55.320]  We watch the vote, we watch the way they put in all of the different amendments.
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:57.320]  And what do Congress do?
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:58.320]  Virtually nothing.
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:07.320]  We need Congress to back us up and not just have us be the only ones that are going to try to defy the president or disobey an order.
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:12.320]  If we could get Congress more fired up, then we'd be even more apt to go along.
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:14.320]  Well, Joe, let me be completely clear.
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:16.320]  You've hit the nail on the head here.
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:17.320]  Okay, you're right.
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:24.320]  I'm asking the military to speak up because the Congress are a bunch of paid off blackmailed crooks.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:28.320]  Now, this is so brazen that they're freaking out and talking about impeachment.
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:30.320]  So I'm saying we've got to really push them.
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:33.320]  And I, quite frankly, I'm looking for sacrificial lambs here.
[02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:39.320]  If it's myself, whatever the case is, politically, whatever, I don't want to be hurt, but this is the way it is.
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:52.320]  Obviously, the only way to supercharge this is for the military to simply, if I was a colonel, I would go to my commanding officer and say,
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:56.320]  well, here's Congressman Walter Jones reading the Constitution.
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:15:08.320]  Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11, that is a high crime and misdemeanor for the president to launch military actions without congressional approval.
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:10.320]  And then they go through all that.
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:16.320]  And then I'd say it goes further, colonel or general, whoever is above you.
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:22.320]  It goes further, as you know, they're saying the authority comes from the UN in these statements.
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.320]  What is your position on that?
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:30.320]  And because we've got to head this off at the past, I mean, there's nothing wrong with reading the Constitution and saying,
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:38.320]  my commander in chief is not under the command of the UN, the president, you know, I mean, it's crazy.
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:39.320]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:49.320]  One of the things that I did early on was I refused to salute the United Nations flag and I also refused to salute Henry Kissinger when he was Secretary of State.
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:16:01.320]  But beside that, I've called my congressman in my own district where my home is, and I've asked for him to put in writing that he supports congressman,
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:09.320]  the Jones Resolution, I've already found out that there's a bipartisan effort to co-sign that.
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:13.320]  They're going to try to move that as quickly and as possible, and I'm giving hundreds of copies of that.
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:17.320]  I'm going to be passing out every member I give a hands on.
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:21.320]  Good. Beautiful. And you're absolutely right that it's their job and the American people's job.
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:33.320]  It's just that in every case, like with the fall of East Germany or any other, it ends up being the military that is going to make the decision if they go into hot tyranny on whether they succeed or not.
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:43.320]  And I mean, in succeeding, launching the Civil War, which the globalists have been making plans for, as you know, we don't want to be in a civil war with the military and police.
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:50.320]  I've seen enough in my life to not be macho and to want to have this fight, but you know the fight is going to come and it's a mindless fight.
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:55.320]  We need to work with the military and police now to overt this.
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:17:03.320]  I mean, I knew, Colonel, when I went to urban warfare drills 14, 15 years ago, that's when the scales came off my eyes.
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:09.320]  And I witnessed mainly the Marines in most cases training to occupy U.S. cities and confiscate firearms of citizens.
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:21.320]  And I will tell the military, if they try widespread gun confiscation, it will result in absolute anarchy and huge casualties on both sides.
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:23.320]  And I know the military is having that discussion.
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:32.320]  I mean, do you have confidence that the military, even with some ridiculous scenario that they push, will say no to gun confiscation?
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:39.320]  I can say to speak for myself that I would not authorize my men to go and to do it.
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:44.320]  But I just hope that there aren't going to be some of these knuckle-draggers as you call them.
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:50.320]  They just enjoy that kind of thing and don't even think of the consequences of it or the constitutionality of it.
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:57.320]  You know, these idiots like Mark Levin, and I used to listen to him until he started every day pounding on Ron Paul.
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:03.320]  And he's just a spokesperson for who knows what in this civil organization.
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:08.320]  They can bring things before Congress, but they're always bringing some stupid bill that means nothing.
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:12.320]  Let's get them behind all of this and let's get to the Supreme Court.
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:17.320]  Why is it so hard to bring a bill to the Supreme Court and decide if something's unconstitutional or not?
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:20.320]  I hear you. God bless you, Colonel. Stay in touch. Really good points.
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:27.320]  I know I talked to a lot of military, including Brass, who's upset and concerned, and I know a bunch of the last joint chiefs of staff and the chairman,
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:32.320]  the last two rounds, they kept saying no to all of this and no to Bush.
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:38.320]  Obama, because he's quote liberal, has gotten so much through arresting reporters,
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:42.320]  charging them, you know, under the Espionage Act for whistleblowers,
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:48.320]  exposing corruption and bid-rigging and crimes and shipping guns into Mexico.
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:51.320]  All right, Mike in New York, get started. We'll come back to you after the break.
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:54.320]  He's U.S. Army. Thanks for holding, Mike. Go ahead.
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:57.320]  How are you doing? How are you doing, Alex? It's great to hear from you and stuff like that.
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:02.320]  I think one of the things, I think Ron Paul could be a great candidate for president of the United States,
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:07.320]  but I think a lot of people in the black communities and Latino communities don't really know who Ron Paul is.
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:11.320]  I think they think he's a racist, which we all know is not true,
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:14.320]  but they don't really know who sticks up for the Constitution, that he helps everyone.
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:18.320]  I think people, because when I talk to other soldiers and stuff like that,
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:20.320]  black people and stuff, they think Ron Paul is a racist,
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:23.320]  because the media in Holly Talks about it, if they do talk about it...
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:28.320]  Sure, sure. Specifically on the Ron Paul front,
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:34.320]  yeah, just because politicians promote and say they care about some racial group or another,
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:37.320]  that's all talk. The Constitution is what everybody gets.
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:40.320]  I mean, we had a call yesterday to point out, I'm not bashing women here,
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:45.320]  but the court systems are geared towards women and against men in family rights.
[02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:49.320]  There's all sorts of discrimination out there that isn't about religion or race.
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:51.320]  Most of it's economic. You know, let's stay there.
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:56.320]  I want to come back to get your take, though, as a military person on this,
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:20:01.320]  because this is the big enchilada. This is a foreign coup. Do you hear me?
[02:20:04.320 --> 02:20:09.320]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:11.320]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:14.320]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with fake TV.
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:19.320]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television,
[02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:22.320]  so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:26.320]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:30.320]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm,
[02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:32.320]  and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:34.320]  Use it anytime you're away from home.

[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:26.320]  Mike in New York is U.S. Army. I understand you're bringing up Ron Paul, but shifting into what we're discussing here,
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:30.320]  what do you think of the president, the sec death, all of him saying,
[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:37.320]  not just that the president is a dictator basically, but that he takes his orders from foreign powers.
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:39.320]  What's your view on that?
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:43.320]  I think it's a shame. I think it's terrible. He's not really our president
[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:51.320]  who used to oppose the Constitution. That's your job. Your job is not to work for the UN or NATO or anybody else
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:56.320]  or JP Morgan or Rothschilds or anybody else. Your job is to uphold and defend the Constitution.
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:03.320]  That's right. And we're so trained to think of a foreign power, you know, some dictator like Mussolini that we're fighting.
[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:08.320]  You know, it's banks. It's these mega corporations that, God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:13.320]  We have got to tell Congress, in fact, this is my message that I'm going to give them today.
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:20.320]  I'm going to call on myself today, not that it's superpower that I call them. It's just that I don't just talk the talk I walk the walk.
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:27.320]  When I call them, I'm going to say, listen, this is treason. It's a foreign coup openly announced.
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:37.320]  It's illegal. And anybody that doesn't sign on to the bill to start the impeachment process is aiding and abetting.
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:44.320]  If somebody robs a bank and they're coming along through your farm and you say, hey, come on in here, stay, stay with me.
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:50.320]  Just give me some of the money. You're now just as guilty of aiding and abetting as the guy that robbed the bank.
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:57.320]  You are guilty. So you better choose what side you're on. This isn't going to go like Germany where the authoritarians win.
[02:25:57.320 --> 02:26:03.320]  Let me tell you something. We're going to stomp the new world order. They're going to go a lot further before it implodes, but we're going to beat them.
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:11.320]  All right, who's been holding the longest next? Let's go to Jay and then Dustin and then John and then Joshua.
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:15.320]  And then that'll be it for calls from the military. Got a major calling in a captain.
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:21.320]  I'm going to go to the folks in order here real fast. Let's go to private Jay, National Guard from Texas. Go ahead.
[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:24.320]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:28.320]  Man, I tell you, I'm just like the colonel earlier. I literally could hardly talk this morning.
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:33.320]  I have a huge headache and I'm having to argue with my wife about not leaving the United States.
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:37.320]  I mean, I'm freaked out. We're in trouble. Okay. We're in trouble.
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:47.320]  After watching that video, I got so upset. I was shaking. I was looking at that thinking, okay, so what's the next step?
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:52.320]  UN is going to start a point in our president. You know, I mean, how far are we going to go?
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:27:00.320]  Every one of these, the president, Congress, everybody takes their oath to the Constitution.
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:12.320]  Some people don't even know what our Constitution entails. I don't know. It just makes me so upset sometimes that people just don't understand what our country was founded on.
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:21.320]  You know, I do not understand why Congress is even deciding they're not doing a dang thing.
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:25.320]  Well, because they're inside our trading. They're playing golf. They're having fun.
[02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:29.320]  But I mean, I think they're starting to get though that you mean we're going to lose our power too.
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:32.320]  Yeah, you can't just rubber stamp and hand it over to the National Security Council.
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:38.320]  That's all a bunch of a vowed globalist and then not expect to totally be turned into a rubber stamp.
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:43.320]  And then they're not even a rubber stamp. They're told you have no bearing on us.
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:51.320]  And not only is the president a dictator, he is a minion of these foreign consortiums.
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:54.320]  So how far is it going to take it? I mean, are they going to go ahead and just go?
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:59.320]  All right, UN president takes the order from UN. Congress is no order.
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:06.320]  80 plus percent of the laws in the UK are now made by the EU bureaucracy and the countries in the EU make no of the laws.
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:10.320]  They have no control and they publicly admit there's no more European countries.
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:15.320]  They've been absorbed through the design collapse of the EU.
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:20.320]  Are you going to spread the word to your associates in the military, sir?
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:29.320]  Roger that. I go ahead and I do what I can when I can. I go ahead and go over what an awful order is to people that are above me.
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:35.320]  I even talk to majors, lieutenant colonels and things like that. Just to go ahead and explain to them sometimes what's going on.
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:43.320]  Someone will be like, oh, DOD isn't that much concerned with it. They won't take it that far. They won't do this with it.
[02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:46.320]  You know, just blatant kind of...
[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:50.320]  Oh, the president wants the power to secretly arrest citizens and put bags over their heads and kill them.
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:56.320]  But he just wants it. He's not going to use it. Oh, billions for 30,000 drones over the US.
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:29:00.320]  Oh, yeah, they're on the news saying they want to put lithium in the water, but it's not going to go that far.
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:03.320]  Yeah, they're announcing world government, but it's not going to go that far.
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:06.320]  Yeah, they're training for gun confiscation, but it's not going to go that far.
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:12.320]  Oh, they're never going to pass socialist healthcare. Oh, they're never going to. Oh, they're exactly. God bless you.
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:23.320]  All right, long segment coming up and I'm going to write to John as a captain and Joshua, who is a major, and then Dustin.
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:29.320]  They got more military calling in, but that's probably all I can get to because...
[02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:34.320]  See, this show isn't an act, folks. I really am concerned. I mean, this is all real.
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:40.320]  I've warned about all this coming because I read globalist documents years ago, and now it's here.
[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:44.320]  It's here, and I realize they don't want to just get rid of the Bill of Rights because they just want to get rid of it.
[02:29:44.320 --> 02:30:00.320]  They want to enslave us. Do you understand that?
[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:26.320]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving, and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:32.320]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:40.320]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:46.320]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.

[02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:05.320]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.320 --> 02:31:20.320]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.320 --> 02:31:29.320]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.320 --> 02:31:36.320]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:46.320]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.

[02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:44.320]  All right, we are back alive here and again we've just become accustomed with them, warrantlessly spying on us, the feds completely out of their jurisdiction.
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:55.320]  All of these horrible things happening that we've seen happen in other nations over and over again, and now it's happening here in our constitutional republic.
[02:33:55.320 --> 02:34:04.320]  And no country would put up with people putting you through body scanners and actually grabbing your genitals. I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:15.320]  And not even horrible third world cess pits will put up with their governments openly being puppets of foreign corporate powers or governmental powers.
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:27.320]  Is there nothing Americans won't put up with? That's why they've had all the USA beauty queens and all the Miss Americas and all these contestants on game shows.
[02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:42.320]  Promote global government, promote the UN. It's just meant to hammer us over and over again. Kids can't even say USA, USA at a basketball game in San Antonio against a local team.
[02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:48.320]  Because I guess that's racist now. It wasn't even meant to be towards a race.
[02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:57.320]  But all these wars were told or launched for America, but they're not. Now I want to go to a couple more calls and move quick because you know I'm long winded.
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:09.320]  But I want to go to John, who is a army captain and then Joshua, who's a major. We got a bunch of other people calling in, but I've got to get to some of this other news.
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:17.320]  I know I spent almost the entire show on this and we should. But there's all this other news that ties into it. I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:23.320]  Police all over the country are pulling people over and grabbing their cell phones and downloading the contents without warrants.
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:35.320]  Police give a direct line to cell phone searches, CBS News. China copies the NDAA. That is secretly arrest people. I mean, it's just...
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:48.320]  Here's a Wired Magazine headline. Uncle Sam, if it ends in calm, it's seasonable. Without warrants, without rulings, just take whatever they want. I mean, it's crazy.
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:59.320]  Obama uses stage cyber attack to sell draconian cybersecurity bill. That's infowars.com. Pentagon launches desperate damage control over shocking, put in a testimony that I want to play some of.
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:10.320]  DHS mission creep. They are now helping arrest prostitutes. Reitbart's death needs to be investigated for the sake and safety of old journalist.
[02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:22.320]  TSA admits $1 million body scanner system is critically flawed. Report chance of catastrophic solar storm is one in eight.
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:33.320]  Panetta International Permission. Trump's Congressional Permission for Military Actions. It doesn't even say that. He said, I don't need... Congress isn't involved anymore.
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:41.320]  Let's go to the captain and then the major. John in Missouri, Army Captain, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:56.320]  Yeah, thanks, Al. It's important that you know the difference. There's huge difference between National Guard soldiers and regular Army soldiers. But more importantly, it's important. You're putting an orange on the wrong person because it's not the Army's job to police the Congress and the president.
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:37:06.320]  The Congress, that's their job. And they're... So they're not doing... They're not having their authority. They're American people's job to elect those Congressmen. They're going to uphold the Constitution.
[02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:17.320]  Well, let me agree but also disagree with you. Listen, I've read the Constitution over and over again. I've read the manuals the military has given on the question of unlawful orders.
[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:28.320]  It is always in the final equation when tyranny comes in, it is people in uniform that are the absolute final check on that along with armed citizens.
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:43.320]  So before the Civil War starts, because that's what happens during these type of deals, I'm saying for the military to speak out and say, I don't take my orders through the president from the UN or NATO as the sect deficit and as Obama has now said.
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:53.320]  I mean, clearly that's a big issue for the military. That's an unlawful order if he says go into Syria and Congress hasn't authorized it. I mean, is that not true?
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:38:05.320]  Well, that's for them to decide. But no one's sending us into Syria, Alex. You're getting people worked up when we don't need to do that because we're such a long ways away from confiscating guns.
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:10.320]  Do you think you're... Oh, wait. Oh, if people get worked up, the guns got to be taken?
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:13.320]  No, I don't think they will though. They won't ever get to that point, Alex.
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:18.320]  Do you have any idea? Have you thought about, Captain, what's going to happen if you actually try to confiscate the guns?
[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:25.320]  Yeah, I mean, I won't do that, but no one's going to order me or my company to go confiscate people's guns.
[02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:29.320]  That didn't happen in New Orleans? They didn't train for that in Arcadia, Iowa?
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:32.320]  That's not regular army. That's in the National Guard.
[02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:36.320]  You're right. Well, they did have some regular army, actually. They had big army in New Orleans.
[02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:40.320]  Right, but the big army in National Guard, they're under two different...
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:48.320]  Record two is that there are huge differences and the National... When the regular army was in New Orleans, we didn't have any weapons.
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:52.320]  That's the National Guard troops. There's a big difference. We just wear the same uniform people think we're the same.
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:59.320]  Well, sir, all I'm trying to say to you is, when the President starts saying and the Secretary of Defense starts saying,
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:05.320]  Congress is like, you get your authority from us. They're like, no, we get it from the UN in NATO.
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:10.320]  And they're like, no, you don't. I mean, look, Congress is moving to start impeachment now.
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:16.320]  And you notice it's not getting any attention. Legislation is now being introduced to the House and Senate to begin impeachment.
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:20.320]  So you're right. It's their job and it's my job, just as much as it's your job.
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:26.320]  But you're a citizen first and then in the military second. And I know you're an officer, so you know all that stuff.
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:30.320]  Maybe you disagree with the current teaching you're being given, but I've looked at the full...
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:35.320]  I mean, have you read the manuals on unlawful orders from 100 years ago?
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:42.320]  I've seen them. We get clasped. But if a soldier... I mean, you're telling soldiers to get on there and do things and they get kicked out of the Army.
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:49.320]  And the reality is, if they get kicked out of the Army, they're going to get a dishonorable discharge and their whole life is going to be ruined.
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:54.320]  So it's just disingenuous to say you're going to go tell the colonel this and this because you're not in the Army.
[02:39:54.320 --> 02:40:00.320]  And yeah, there's huge consequences that are going to go with this. Let me stop you again. I said people should do what they think.
[02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:07.320]  But if, again, the military is supposed to be talking to each other. You're supposed to be discussing all this.
[02:40:07.320 --> 02:40:13.320]  Listen, you say you're going to get thrown out of the Army. You're going to get in trouble. It wasn't disingenuous.
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:19.320]  I said in this tyranny, you could get in trouble. What you don't think, I don't have my butt hanging out over the side here.
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:26.320]  I don't even talk about the chicanery that goes on against us. You think it's safe to get on the air until the military starts?
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:33.320]  Listen, listen, see how we've gotten comfortable with this? It's illegal to have the President launching wars without congressional approval.
[02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:39.320]  Okay, I had Colonel Shaffer on just a few days ago saying, yes, it's illegal. Yes, it's treason.
[02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:47.320]  Because the code says it is. The Constitution says it. I got Walter Jones saying it's a high crime. It is a high crime, Captain.
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:55.320]  It is a high crime. And you know what? At the end of the day, I'm asking the citizens, I'm asking the military, I'm asking the Congress, everybody.
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:05.320]  Listen, do you think I'm blowing this up, that I am saying that this is basically the beginning of a foreign coup to have wars launched under UN orders,
[02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:08.320]  as Obama said last year and as Panetta said yesterday?
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:17.320]  Alex, no one is telling the United States Army. It's not telling me or mine. I'm the commander of my company. We're not confiscating guns.
[02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:22.320]  They're so far from that. And nobody is sending us into Libya or Syria. They're not sending a regular army there.
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:29.320]  You can see where we're on. They have a chart all on army times where every unit in the United States Army is located.
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:33.320]  Oh, really? Oh, they have a public chart where every unit of the U.S. Army is at?
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:38.320]  Yeah, it's in army times. Oh, including clandestine units?
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:41.320]  Well, not the Black Ops guys. They lose their time in regular army.
[02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:44.320]  But you know there's stuff about Black Ops, right? I mean, do you know about?
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:51.320]  There's Black Ops, there's White Ops, there's White Ops. Those aren't regular army people. I don't even know what, no one knows what their rules are.
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:59.320]  There's private corporate groups with national security letter of marks, men associated with special forces. Listen, listen.
[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:09.320]  Just watch what happens in this country. They didn't march in and tell the Senate they have no authority over war because they wanted to play tiddlywinks with them.
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:19.320]  That was a declaration of the new system. Did you read the letter Obama signed last year where he said, I don't need Congress. I have the U.N. for authority?
[02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:23.320]  Yeah, I read that. I was at least to be on time. I think you're great.
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:27.320]  Well, I think you're great, sir. But do you realize that's illegal?
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:35.320]  Yeah, but that's for the common army's job. We don't rule run by civilians. We don't. It's not our job to go to the president or the Congress.
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:36.320]  The Congress needs to do their job.
[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:40.320]  Oh, let me stop. I hear you and I appreciate your call, sir. Let me be clear. If you think that's what you heard.
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:47.320]  I did not say the military should arrest the president. I'm not in love with this thing. I hear about a military coup to stop what's happening.
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:52.320]  You know, some operation valkyrie because the president's just a puppet. Okay.
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:43:03.320]  I'm saying the military needs to make some noise and say, hey, we don't take our orders in the Constitution from the U.N. like Michael do did.
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:14.320]  Joshua and okay. In Oklahoma, it just says major. Thanks for calling and holding Joshua. You're a major in the army Marines. We're your major.
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:16.320]  Major in the army, actually.
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:20.320]  What did you think of the whole discussion we've been having?
[02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:27.320]  Well, to be honest, focusing on that last one, I'm actually very disappointed that captain.
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:36.320]  My personal beliefs are that he's misguided even though he has good intentions. Now, going back on something that was stated earlier.
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:43.320]  He doesn't personally believe that people are going to start confiscating guns or people are going to start arresting citizens whenever they feel like it.
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:55.320]  But I was actually recently assigned to liaison duty where I'm helping people transition from the active military into the reserves National Guard.
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:44:01.320]  But the simple fact that they want to keep their numbers, but they don't want to pay them near as much into this whole budget, that's saying.
[02:44:01.320 --> 02:44:10.320]  One of the key things that they actually did do was they went around and reassured a lot of people saying things like, oh, don't worry, your job secure.
[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:17.320]  Don't worry, we'll give you benefits. Oh, don't worry, we'll give you a bonus. If you just do this, you just have to do what we say.
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:25.320]  Now, going again to something that was stated before about being confiscated.
[02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:32.320]  Oklahoma has never been a state that's had armor until recently, and it's not quite something that they're bringing out to the mainstream.
[02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:50.320]  What is happening that I'm aware of because it's in my department is recently we were given APCs and we were given strikers, usually in the form of things that can be modified, up armored, whatever, bigger guns, things like that.
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:53.320]  But the thing is, it's not focused on like tanks.
[02:44:53.320 --> 02:45:03.320]  It's not focused on things to declare war. It's always on stuff where you can move troops in and out of an area where they're completely protected by a hunting field.
[02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:12.320]  So it's to fight asymmetrical groups of guerrilla warriors. It's for fighting asymmetrical insurrections.
[02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:16.320]  And look, the local police are all militarizing for that duty.
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:23.320]  I mean, there's a full escalation for over a decade for all out war with the American people. And I just hope that this doesn't happen.
[02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:30.320]  But if it does, the public's not going to go out and fight the vehicles when they're driving down the road. They're going to attack the troops when they're in bars.
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:38.320]  I mean, I hope people understand if it goes to a guerrilla war in this country, I don't know how to explain it, but I'm sure you know. Go ahead.
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:47.320]  Well, no, that's what I was trying to point out is that one of the things that went down the pipe is they were making comments along the lines when we had a hearing that said,
[02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:53.320]  OK, well, we have to worry about civil insurrection. We have to worry about this, this and that.
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:57.320]  And guerrilla warfare was brought up almost every conversation.
[02:45:57.320 --> 02:46:01.320]  So let me stop you. You're in charge as I've had family in charge.
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:09.320]  He was sent back overseas. He's regular army merging with the National Guard, beefing it up and the whole clandestine mission.
[02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:17.320]  And I was even told this and I've been told about 100 other sources, literally or more is for riot control and even combat at arms.
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:25.320]  And even in the John Warren Defense Authorization Act 2007 for 08, it says to even suppress states and legislatures and rogue governors.
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:31.320]  So they create the 10 member governor council to say, oh, we're for the states. We have a 10 member council.
[02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:34.320]  This is breaking news here, though, from you. We have brigade homeland articles.
[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:41.320]  I mean, we know that they're training for this, but you're saying you're being told here's the armored vehicles. Here's the strikers.
[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:46.320]  You know, here's these combat vehicles for guerrilla war.
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:52.320]  So I mean, there it is. Why is the government gearing up for guerrilla war in Oklahoma and Texas and everywhere else?
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:55.320]  Why are they acclimating the public for troops on the streets?
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:47:01.320]  Because foreign usurpers have hijacked the presidency and are telling Congress sit down and shut up.
[02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:09.320]  And we have a foreign coup and they plan on using you against us when they fully implode the country and arrest people like me.
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:13.320]  I'm sorry. Go ahead and finish your point on a shut up major.
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:16.320]  Well, I appreciate that. And no, that's okay.
[02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:27.320]  I'm actually 100% on your page. In fact, I had recently been through an ordeal. I say recently it was in 2009 where I refused to obey an order, which I'm not going to go into over the air.
[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:33.320]  But I was incarcerated for 90 days because I refused to obey this order.
[02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:40.320]  However, upon release, I was asked, why was I incarcerated? They never gave me a reason.
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:46.320]  And then I was reassigned as a liaison, I guess, so they don't think I can do a whole lot of damage or whatever.
[02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:53.320]  But one of the biggest weapons that I have is the fact that I do have a no-cleave cluster and I have a voice and I can be heard just like you, sir.
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:48:04.320]  You can do this and so can I. And anybody else who doesn't think, oh, you know, I have no voice or says, oh, I can't say this, this or that, or I can't do this, they're full of it.
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:11.320]  Anybody and everybody has the power to stand up and say whatever they need to say or whatever needs to be said.
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:19.320]  Well, again, if we can't stand up now when the president says, I take my orders from the UN, then when will we stand up?
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:22.320]  I mean, this is open coup d'etat, but just to be specific.
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:30.320]  So they're in these meetings where these armored vehicles are being shipped in and heavier weapons, they're admitting it's for guerrilla warfare in America.
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:36.320]  Oh, no, no, no, they're not being shipped in. They've already been shipped in. They've been shipped into locations all around the country.
[02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:43.320]  Look at YouTube. There's several videos where it shows vehicles being brought in on trains and...
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:52.320]  Yeah, hundreds of tanks and they're being, I know they're being deployed in stockpiles. I know the caches are there and they're training, but I mean, specifically, they just admit this is to fight the guerrillas.
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:55.320]  Oh, no, no, not just that. It's for anything.
[02:48:55.320 --> 02:49:03.320]  Texas said, I think it was Rick Perry who basically made a comment. I can't remember exactly when, but he was talking about Texas secession.
[02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:07.320]  When that happened, our command was like, holy crap, maybe go time.
[02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:13.320]  There was another state that said something about secession not too long ago and then everything started coming down the chain.
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:24.320]  You just heard it. They're telling you get ready to suppress governors that realize we don't have a real federal government and reform the republic from the states up.
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:28.320]  Well, they're trying to do something. They're not supposed to. That's for darn sure.
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:33.320]  Well, no, the John Ward Defense Authorization Act talks about insurrection even by legislatures.
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:39.320]  Well, wait, you got a foreign UN run federal government telling us we're the traders?
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:53.320]  Well, if you have to put it that way, yeah, I guess that would be the case, but I guess that was labeled as a trader a long time ago because I have a brain and a voice and I like to speak.
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:59.320]  Any other tidbits about people being awake around you or specifically? I mean, just ballpark.
[02:49:59.320 --> 02:50:04.320]  How many how many armored vehicles are in Oklahoma for the American people in the legislature?
[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:11.320]  Okay, well, I don't know all the numbers. I do know for my area there was recently brought in six.
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:18.320]  In fact, I have pictures on my cell phone from which they were being brought in there.
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:24.320]  Let's say there were six strikers and about nine Bradley's.
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:27.320]  Which they used at Wakeham.
[02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:29.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:32.320]  But other than that, that's just my area.
[02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:39.320]  There's others that have been brought in and that I don't know about supposedly that are in Fortville right now.
[02:50:39.320 --> 02:50:44.320]  And then there's others that were taken to Oklahoma City.
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:48.320]  And they admit to you that this could be for...
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:56.320]  Wow, I mean, you're saying when states talk about secession, the chain of command says get ready, get ready to go into the states.
[02:50:56.320 --> 02:51:00.320]  Well, remember the feds that they do a blockade over Texas? Stay there, we're going to come back to you and then others.
[02:51:00.320 --> 02:51:09.320]  2012 is finally here and while the government racks up another one trillion in debt, the IRS is hard at work collecting.
[02:51:09.320 --> 02:51:14.320]  In fact, they're even sending agents to some people's homes in place of business.
[02:51:14.320 --> 02:51:20.320]  If you owe back taxes, have years of unfiled tax returns or are receiving threatening letters or phone calls,
[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:27.320]  call the tax division of the law offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-652-6978.
[02:51:27.320 --> 02:51:33.320]  Our tax division is spearheaded by a former IRS agent with over 31 years experience.
[02:51:33.320 --> 02:51:37.320]  He knows the ins and outs of the IRS and how to get them off your back once and for all.
[02:51:37.320 --> 02:51:44.320]  The phone call is free and so is the consultation, so call now 800-652-6978.
[02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:48.320]  That's 800-652-6978.
[02:51:48.320 --> 02:51:54.320]  Don't wait for agents to knock on your door. Call 800-652-6978.

[02:52:01.320 --> 02:52:09.320]  Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid? Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off of your teeth both as a vapor and as particles into your body?
[02:52:09.320 --> 02:52:13.320]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:52:13.320 --> 02:52:17.320]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:22.320]  Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function.
[02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:27.320]  The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione.
[02:52:27.320 --> 02:52:35.320]  The number one superfood that helps turn on all 10 trillion cells of your body to produce glutathione is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:52:35.320 --> 02:52:48.320]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh, raw whey.

[02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:30.320]  All right. Everybody is going to wish they'd done more to say no to corruption, because I wish I knew 15 years ago that I was so accurate and so right,
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:36.320]  and then it was worse than I even thought. I wish I would have done more, because they got really bad plans for this country.
[02:54:36.320 --> 02:54:45.320]  I've broken it down. I've researched it from every angle. They're planning to completely shut the economy off and just arrest people, everything.
[02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:51.320]  And a lot of folks are like, well, I know I'm going to cower. Well, that's how they win. We can't just do this.
[02:54:51.320 --> 02:54:57.320]  And the money's all racing out of the country. The people that help do this, the people that help sell us down the river,
[02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:02.320]  they're all just exiting as fast as they can for years.
[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:07.320]  How about we just wake up? How about we virally spread the news? This is illegitimate.
[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:17.320]  And say no, and call Congress and say yes, impeach Obama. Yes, yes, we're not under the UN. You know, Ron Paul has tried.
[02:55:17.320 --> 02:55:22.320]  And he's educated a lot of people, but I told you there's election fraud, and there's these articles in Politico, like,
[02:55:22.320 --> 02:55:30.320]  Ron Paul's advisors don't know why they're not winning because you're being cheated.
[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:36.320]  But going back to Joshua, and then we'll go to Dustin, and that's it for calls, and I didn't even get to most of the other news,
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:40.320]  because this is just such big stuff. But everything else I had tied into it will be covered in tonight.
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:44.320]  Seven o'clock is going to be a huge news show tonight.
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:49.320]  Going back to Joshua and then to Dustin, who's been holding for like an hour, U.S. Army.
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:53.320]  Joshua was a major in the U.S. Army.
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:56:00.320]  I was jumping in hyperventilating. Specifically, though, tell us about what they do whenever a state talks about secession,
[02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:05.320]  what the, you know, brigade homeland kicks into.
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:11.320]  Well, the last time that somebody said anything about secession, I remember being at home,
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:17.320]  and I got an email, a phone call, a text message, pretty much all at the same time.
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:26.320]  I mean, it's your crap. Get ready to go. We're going to have to meet up with the colonel, and so I did.
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:31.320]  My buddy and I were like, OK, what's going on? It's OK. We're going to have to get ready.
[02:56:31.320 --> 02:56:35.320]  The talk is secession. We need to see what happens because if this happens, it's go time.
[02:56:35.320 --> 02:56:41.320]  And I remember a young lieutenant looking back, actually, who made the comment,
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:47.320]  yeah, it's about time we start showing people who's boss. It's like, are you freaking kidding me?
[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:53.320]  But that's actually now. Now, let's be clear, because this is actually in the John Warren Defense Authorization Act.
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:57.320]  It says insurrection by the population. The states are legislatures.
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:57:04.320]  Well, the states have a right to secede. I mean, that's, I mean, that's on record in many state constitutions,
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:07.320]  but it's also there in the common law. That's what happened with the colonies.
[02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:14.320]  Perry just did that for political effect. And you're saying you're in Oklahoma that immediately they were saying,
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:20.320]  get the get the tanks ready, get on the, you know, get them on the backs of the of the trains were going to Texas.
[02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:24.320]  I mean, right there, that is such an incredible piece of news.
[02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:28.320]  But then, of course, I'm sure the phone call was made and Perry's like, no, it's a total joke.
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:34.320]  But there you are in Oklahoma Army. You guys were ready to invade Texas if it tried to secede.
[02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:43.320]  Bingo. Actually, it's not just me. It was the National Guard was ready to move to the border.
[02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:46.320]  Active duty from Fort Sill was ready to move.
[02:57:46.320 --> 02:57:52.320]  I know that we have Tinker Air Force Base here and their bombers were actually, but are not their bombers,
[02:57:52.320 --> 02:57:58.320]  but their interceptors were actually put on high alert to prepare for actions if anything were to happen.
[02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:05.320]  And again, oh, man, I got to I got to just have days of military callers more often the stuff because, you know what,
[02:58:05.320 --> 02:58:09.320]  I've got all this data. I know what you're saying is true because it's in the Defense Act.
[02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:16.320]  But imagine we've got foreign banks openly overthrowing the country in control.
[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:19.320]  They're the traders. They're telling Congress you have no authority.
[02:58:19.320 --> 02:58:25.320]  And then if the states ever try to pull out of the fake New World Order and reconstitute the Republic,
[02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:31.320]  they're going to bring the military in. And you know what? I say with the TSA, the feds say we'll run blockades with F-16s,
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:36.320]  no aircraft in Texas. If you don't let us grab your genitals. I mean, that was in the news. I say good.
[02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:59.320]  You know what? Make them act like a bully.

[02:59:52.320 --> 03:00:07.320]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:07.320 --> 03:00:22.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:22.320 --> 03:00:31.320]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:37.320]  You know, people hear that liner and they think it's a joke.
[03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:48.320]  Oh, FEMA Region 6, now we're under 10 governors who are federal minions and they say in the John Warren Defense Authorization Act they'll use the military against the states if they try to secede.
[03:00:48.320 --> 03:00:53.320]  They're going to use force. Oh, you don't want the TSA? You're going to kick them out of Texas?
[03:00:53.320 --> 03:00:56.320]  Not going to let them grow up your kids and your state legislators?
[03:00:56.320 --> 03:01:01.320]  They'll run an armed blockade and shoot down aircraft coming into the state.
[03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:05.320]  That's what the feds said, because they're not the feds. They're foreign bankers.
[03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:11.320]  And I've been ranting about this for three hours. We're taking phone calls on it. Obama, I never even got to the clips.
[03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:15.320]  They're all at mfolwars.com. Paul Watts has got another big article coming out on this.
[03:01:15.320 --> 03:01:23.320]  We got to make this the biggest story in America with the sec deaf and others and the joint chiefs and they're telling Congress you have no authority over anything anymore.
[03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:28.320]  They're going to shut down and shut up. The U.N. runs America. The U.N. is the commander of the president.
[03:01:28.320 --> 03:01:32.320]  They're like, no, the Constitution says it's Congress and they just said, nope.
[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:38.320]  And the generals were all looking at the senators going, you don't understand. We're in charge now.
[03:01:38.320 --> 03:01:47.320]  Unbelievable. Dustin in Texas, U.S. Army, what's your view on what you've heard discussed here?
[03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:53.320]  Well, I just want to touch up on what that captain had said earlier, because that kind of struck me the wrong way.
[03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:58.320]  He's probably not even a commander for a combat battalion. He's not even a company commander for a combat battalion.
[03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:06.320]  I'm assuming just by the way he was talking. But if he doesn't think that we, that they're not going to try to use our military to take guns from citizens,
[03:02:06.320 --> 03:02:11.320]  what does he think the Iraq and Afghanistan war was for? It was real life training for martial law in America.
[03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:15.320]  It doesn't take a tactical genius to connect the dots and figure that one out.
[03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:18.320]  Right. It's a laboratory. The Pentagon admits that.
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:24.320]  But anyways, the public respect the military. They respect us a lot. Okay.
[03:02:24.320 --> 03:02:28.320]  And when we speak out about political stuff and stuff that's going on,
[03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:31.320]  that maybe they're not informed because they get all their news from the two.
[03:02:31.320 --> 03:02:37.320]  But if we speak out against that, the public are going to listen to what military has to say because they do respect us.
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:45.320]  And it is our job to protect the citizens, to uphold our constitution and to protect our way of life.
[03:02:45.320 --> 03:02:48.320]  And hopefully now I can only speak from where I'm from.
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:52.320]  There are not a whole lot of people who are awake in my company.
[03:02:52.320 --> 03:02:56.320]  And I'm just going to say that probably because it's infantry. So a lot of them are very bright.
[03:02:56.320 --> 03:03:01.320]  But there are a few that are awake and there are a few that are informed.
[03:03:01.320 --> 03:03:06.320]  And when they start trying to do the crazy stuff, I'm pretty sure a lot of the military are going to snap out of the trend.
[03:03:06.320 --> 03:03:13.320]  What the globalists are going to do is nuke a city or blow something up and then have some militia commander on TV,
[03:03:13.320 --> 03:03:16.320]  who turns out to fed saying they launched the attack.
[03:03:16.320 --> 03:03:19.320]  And then they're going to attack convoys and domestic operations.
[03:03:19.320 --> 03:03:25.320]  It'll be a food convoy helping some town hit by the terrorists.
[03:03:25.320 --> 03:03:30.320]  And then the militia is going to attack the convoy and they'll be footage of it conveniently.
[03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:35.320]  And then they'll try to show the troops on big screen TVs and remember what happened.
[03:03:35.320 --> 03:03:38.320]  And I mean, that's how they run the psyops.
[03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:43.320]  And I just hope the military knows we knew this was all coming and we warned you.
[03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:46.320]  And we don't want to have a war with each other.
[03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:54.320]  We need to recognize the Congress is being told the UN and the foreign banks run America.
[03:03:54.320 --> 03:03:58.320]  And period. I mean, that's treason. That's coup d'etat.
[03:03:58.320 --> 03:04:03.320]  It's very simple. Your take on that.
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:06.320]  You know, I mean, you're definitely right on that.
[03:04:06.320 --> 03:04:08.320]  But I just wanted to say one more thing.
[03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:11.320]  I got a message to the military for all the military listeners.
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:15.320]  I understand that we're brainwashed to take orders and not ask questions,
[03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:18.320]  but it's time that we ask questions and speak out.
[03:04:18.320 --> 03:04:22.320]  I mean, I know where I'm stationed, there are a lot of political activist groups.
[03:04:22.320 --> 03:04:27.320]  You know, of course, they got to meet off post to discuss or, you know, to meet.
[03:04:27.320 --> 03:04:32.320]  But there are groups out there just reach out and get involved because it's time for everybody,
[03:04:32.320 --> 03:04:35.320]  not just the military, but the military to please.
[03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:36.320]  Beautifully said.
[03:04:36.320 --> 03:04:40.320]  Look, look, look, America has been seized by foreign powers.
[03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:42.320]  The traders are running the federal government.
[03:04:42.320 --> 03:04:45.320]  Real Americans better stand up and defend the Republic.
[03:04:45.320 --> 03:04:46.320]  Okay, this is it.
[03:04:46.320 --> 03:04:53.320]  I mean, they're telling Congress foreign powers run America, Congress sit down and shut up.
[03:04:53.320 --> 03:05:03.320]  And Congress says we're going to impeach your hind end.
