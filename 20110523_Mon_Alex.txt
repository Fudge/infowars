[00:00.000 --> 00:14.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.040 --> 00:20.880]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:41.320]  if you go to drudgereport.com you will see a top news story TSA to oversee searches at
[00:41.320 --> 00:52.120]  Santa Fe prom and then under it you'll see the words in oh no TSA backs down from prom night
[00:52.120 --> 00:59.240]  grope here's the deal this is what I've tried to explain to people I've seen mainstream news
[00:59.240 --> 01:05.080]  articles attack me saying Jones claims that the TSA is going to be on the streets of America the
[01:05.080 --> 01:10.960]  TSA have been on the streets of America for nine years in New York and Boston they've been on the
[01:10.960 --> 01:18.120]  streets of Dallas Texas and Miami Florida for at least five years they are now expanding nationwide
[01:18.120 --> 01:22.840]  into every area of our country you're saying how are they going to have a big enough force well
[01:22.840 --> 01:28.800]  what did Obama say during his campaign he said we need a domestic security force just as big and
[01:28.800 --> 01:38.920]  just as strong as our military and I saw Governor Ridge this this transcends parties now almost nine
[01:38.920 --> 01:47.600]  years ago on C-SPAN layout the plan incrementally of the TSA you will not have a job without
[01:47.600 --> 01:52.040]  Homeland Security authorization you will not get health care without Homeland Security
[01:52.040 --> 01:56.920]  authorization you will not be able to travel in a car or get a driver's license without
[01:56.920 --> 02:07.040]  Homeland Security authorization and TSA commanders literal minimum wage people who are not sworn
[02:07.040 --> 02:15.440]  bonded federal or state or local police will command your local police this is what Hitler
[02:15.440 --> 02:22.360]  and Stalin and Mao did they hire pretty much uninformed untrained normally criminal types and
[02:22.360 --> 02:29.040]  that's what a lot of TSA are pedophile thieves trying to rape women because who wants a job
[02:29.040 --> 02:34.280]  grabbing people's genitals but perverts and so that's a job prerequisite they they have them
[02:34.280 --> 02:42.080]  do things that normal good people wouldn't do to build that army then they will command local
[02:42.080 --> 02:57.280]  forces and here it is in New Mexico in Santa Fe and they've already done some of these searches
[02:57.280 --> 03:02.480]  and previously and that's in the young girls describe having their breasts grabbed by the men
[03:02.480 --> 03:09.440]  and women and you're tuning in saying this is the twilight zone it's meant to be the twilight
[03:09.440 --> 03:17.960]  zone it's meant to be over the top in your face and that's just the way it is as I keep
[03:17.960 --> 03:27.880]  explaining it's meant to break your will there was a savage hit piece on me last week in
[03:27.880 --> 03:36.680]  the local Chronicle newspaper by the owner of South by Southwest Lewis Black not the comedian
[03:36.680 --> 03:45.160]  but the creator of South by Southwest and the kingpin owner of it biggest conference in the
[03:45.160 --> 03:53.800]  country now and he has written lies and about me and savaged me with his paper for at least 1213
[03:53.800 --> 03:59.600]  years for no reason I never did anything to him never talked about him and in they did fake
[03:59.600 --> 04:06.600]  investigative reports that were complete and total lies and when I gave them proof that it was lies
[04:06.600 --> 04:12.280]  they just laughed at me they didn't care and he's written a new piece about how basically I'm
[04:12.280 --> 04:18.520]  powerful and I'm dangerous and I'm delusional and that you know how do I think that I'm Sherlock
[04:18.520 --> 04:25.200]  Holmes I don't think I'm Sherlock Holmes I saw the UN documents that are public how they plan
[04:25.200 --> 04:30.080]  to set up a world government break up the family and start killing us in mass I mean it's routine
[04:30.080 --> 04:35.120]  that they kill our troops with nerve gas and in radiologicals and biologicals and test and shoot
[04:35.120 --> 04:43.400]  kids up with syphilis and polio it's in Texas news again that they're putting radioactive
[04:43.400 --> 04:50.440]  isotopes in the water I mean I mean all I'm doing is I told you the TSA was coming to your
[04:50.440 --> 04:55.440]  high school to grow up your daughters I mean they said they were okay I mean these are rape armies
[04:55.440 --> 05:07.480]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[05:07.480 --> 05:12.840]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the
[05:12.840 --> 05:18.920]  Americans at home I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[05:18.920 --> 05:25.040]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention

[09:00.840 --> 09:06.040]  is just some of the news on that front some of the Chinese veils are running with the headlines
[09:06.040 --> 09:16.920]  China asks us to respect Pakistan sovereignty but let me just stop right there Walt Disney
[09:16.920 --> 09:22.520]  world is announcing that when you go on the new Star Wars ride this is from mouse planet
[09:23.560 --> 09:31.160]  put out by Disney that there will be a body scanner and the TSA checkpoint when you go
[09:31.160 --> 09:39.400]  in to the facility and so the children are being taught when you go to Disney world now for close
[09:39.400 --> 09:47.400]  to a decade you were forced to hand scan biometrically to get in the same thing at the Anheuser
[09:47.400 --> 09:52.680]  bush owned sea worlds around the country of course six seven years ago I shot video of
[09:52.680 --> 09:58.520]  myself refusing and they said fine we'll let you in but you've got to basically pay more and I
[09:58.520 --> 10:03.160]  then told them I would never come back and I've not been back but they don't care
[10:05.160 --> 10:09.960]  all of these institutions are about social engineering and conditioning you now
[10:12.600 --> 10:20.040]  that said we have a decision to make there is no doubt that we have social engineers attempting
[10:20.040 --> 10:27.400]  to turn our entire country and through continuity of agenda the entire world into an authoritarian
[10:27.400 --> 10:35.000]  high-tech police state where every basic norm of freedom has been a bridge and overturned
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.640]  where the government whenever it wants sticks its hands down your pants grabs your genitals
[10:39.640 --> 10:44.920]  where you are forcibly inoculated that's all being pushed elementary schools all over the
[10:44.920 --> 10:50.360]  country got caught two years ago giving flu shots to children even when the parents said no
[10:50.360 --> 10:56.520]  it was universally elementary schools because they believe the children were not communicative
[10:56.520 --> 11:01.480]  enough to be able to articulate to their parents what had happened we first got reports for months
[11:01.480 --> 11:07.160]  of this from listeners who were outraged then it came up in local tv stations in california
[11:07.160 --> 11:14.280]  alabama new york texas florida michigan hitting them and hitting them hard mainly poor areas
[11:15.240 --> 11:20.040]  where they think the parents don't know their rights they first beta tested there then move
[11:20.040 --> 11:24.120]  it out against everyone this is about government getting in your comfort zones they're now giving
[11:24.120 --> 11:30.440]  people free driver's license you don't have to pay the registration fee in dc if you give them a
[11:30.440 --> 11:38.440]  dna swab of your cheek tissue they'll also take blood of you allow them that was in an executive
[11:38.440 --> 11:46.840]  order in 1994 by bill clinton not implemented until 2010 this is a long-term strategic program
[11:46.840 --> 11:53.160]  they move forward inch by inch when they get resistance they stop or back off a little as soon
[11:53.160 --> 12:00.520]  as you stop resisting they move forward again now they've gone to a leapfrog mode of leaping
[12:01.640 --> 12:07.720]  leaping with yeah uh five years ago we denied we were listening to you without warrants and in bush
[12:07.720 --> 12:12.440]  got up gave a press conference now we're listening to everything no warrants what's you're gonna do
[12:12.440 --> 12:18.040]  about it governors say don't run illegal military checkpoints at tennessee in other areas homeland
[12:18.040 --> 12:24.120]  security says we'll have 14 different agencies shut down highways and search whoever we want
[12:24.120 --> 12:34.440]  shut up governor now i have the federal ruling i have the local news articles this is so earth
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.960]  shaking that i i i really want to get your attention now i know for long time listeners
[12:39.960 --> 12:45.160]  this is ancient news but the point is they're really doing it and you've got to make a decision
[12:45.160 --> 12:51.480]  do you want to be total slaves two years ago they couldn't pass the carbon tax right when
[12:51.480 --> 12:55.320]  obama got in he said the epa is gonna implement anyways and they're going to the cities and
[12:55.320 --> 13:00.040]  states are getting them to pass laws to do it for home inspections and federal slash
[13:00.040 --> 13:09.240]  agenda 21 un zoning laws for local bureaucrats under federal licensing entering your home
[13:09.240 --> 13:15.400]  repeatedly every year without warrants and putting you under federal zoning which dwarfs
[13:15.400 --> 13:20.520]  anything ever seen and they can take your home in one week without a court if you don't make
[13:20.520 --> 13:26.840]  the changes they say in one week it is guaranteed to be designed to take old people and poor
[13:26.840 --> 13:31.720]  people's homes and then after they're done setting up the swat team brigades that back up this
[13:31.720 --> 13:35.880]  situation they're going to go after everybody i told you they're going to start going after
[13:35.880 --> 13:41.400]  amish and farmers and ranchers and raw milk sellers and raw cheese sellers i can go to whole
[13:41.400 --> 13:47.240]  foods and buy amish natural cheese all day long from raw milk that's going to be shut down
[13:47.240 --> 13:52.120]  i can get drive out and buy peaches watermelons whatever i want that's all being harassed and
[13:52.120 --> 13:59.000]  shut down i mean hell is on us uh in europe they now are banning across the board headlines bbc
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.800]  you name it uh but they're reporting like it's a good thing hundreds of supplements banned
[14:03.800 --> 14:09.800]  vitamin c vitamin d vitamin b12 b6 boom they're hitting them in the u.s even though there's not
[14:09.800 --> 14:13.960]  a law they will run into health food stores with guns they will run into farmers markets
[14:13.960 --> 14:19.160]  with guns getting people on the ground to act like it's illegal and bad and to scare everybody
[14:19.160 --> 14:24.760]  they are unleashing hell upon us this is only the beginning now now why am i so upset
[14:24.760 --> 14:32.520]  because everything the enemy is doing is public and stated and admitted
[14:33.880 --> 14:37.160]  and it's a nightmare and we need to wake up from it and say no
[14:38.360 --> 14:43.080]  psychological warfare chiefs are running this they've written countless white papers admitting it
[14:43.080 --> 14:48.200]  that's what's so frustrating it's all public people ask how does alex jones think he knows all this
[14:48.200 --> 14:52.120]  how do the things he talked about keep coming true because they've written it all down
[14:52.120 --> 14:57.240]  the austin chronicle last week attacked me and said jones you know uh claims he knows all this stuff
[14:57.240 --> 15:03.560]  and if it's true he makes surlock homes look like a barely competent um what was the term they use
[15:03.560 --> 15:11.000]  boy scout no i'm a barely competent boy scout when they tell me what they're going to do
[15:12.760 --> 15:18.280]  and they're calling was in texas tv stations again yesterday the high levels of radioactive
[15:18.280 --> 15:23.240]  isotopes being added with the fluoride into the water and they report it and it says the cover
[15:23.240 --> 15:28.440]  up goes all the way to the governor and nobody gets in trouble they're murdering us i know it's
[15:28.440 --> 15:35.240]  bold i know it's crazy i know it's hard to believe but it's real i read that article yesterday i'm
[15:35.240 --> 15:38.840]  going to get back to it today and we'll even play the newscast for you if we have time but it's up
[15:38.840 --> 15:48.280]  on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com i mean they're killing us the stupid cops that serve them
[15:48.920 --> 15:53.400]  the macho guys that like to hunt men with their machine guns they don't know they're
[15:53.400 --> 15:59.320]  being killed the dumb bureaucrats don't know all the soft public doesn't understand because
[15:59.320 --> 16:04.680]  they hear this show and they can't believe it you can pull it up newspapers two years ago
[16:04.680 --> 16:11.640]  but repeatedly said jones is delusional he says that they're going to have federal
[16:11.640 --> 16:18.760]  security forces at checkpoints everywhere searching you and who would have even thought
[16:18.760 --> 16:23.080]  sticking hands down pants i was just going off of the documents that they're going to
[16:23.080 --> 16:28.120]  shut up harden checkpoints on all the highways checkpoints at the schools checkpoints in all
[16:28.120 --> 16:33.160]  buildings you're going to have to swipe a government car to even get to work now they've announced it
[16:33.160 --> 16:38.440]  all the major unions have to get homeland security clearance to even be part of the union or have
[16:38.440 --> 16:42.840]  their job you notice when they finally got the several what was it twenty something thousand
[16:42.840 --> 16:48.760]  first responders police medical workers finally after myself and others lucradowski we are changed
[16:48.760 --> 16:55.960]  fought for eight nine years to get medical care for the police fireman medical workers others
[16:56.760 --> 17:01.000]  congress and it's in the law this is new york post associated press if you're a new looser
[17:01.000 --> 17:07.160]  don't believe this and i don't blame you this is crazy crazy like a fox that they have to go through
[17:07.160 --> 17:13.880]  an anti-terror database to get their health care after the government knowingly lying saying the
[17:13.880 --> 17:17.960]  air was safe to breathe you don't need to wear a mask they knew it was asbestos the internal
[17:17.960 --> 17:22.280]  epa reports came out christina todd wetman was ordered by the bush white house to lie
[17:23.320 --> 17:28.280]  after all these major medical institutions came out and said the police and others lungs are filled
[17:28.280 --> 17:33.320]  with asbestos they're dying i've been there with the police officers behind the scenes in the
[17:33.320 --> 17:37.480]  green room before they give a speech and they're on a breathing machine and coughing up blood into
[17:37.480 --> 17:42.120]  napkins in front of me and then i've seen articles demonizing them saying they're making it up and
[17:42.120 --> 17:51.160]  it's a conspiracy theory when it's admitted we got the funding and now they have to go through a
[17:51.160 --> 17:55.160]  terrorist database and get a homeland security authorization it's going to be like that for
[17:55.160 --> 18:01.240]  everything this is the beta test i saw governor ridge almost nine years ago on c-span in a two
[18:01.240 --> 18:07.160]  hour symposium i just happened to catch 30 minutes into it and they laid out how it's going to be
[18:07.160 --> 18:14.200]  total control over everything now they're not rolling out tsa on highways and roads and bus
[18:14.200 --> 18:20.920]  stations they already have done it in select beta testing areas for at least nine years
[18:20.920 --> 18:30.280]  in the last six years up until now in other parts now every tsa agent and they say they
[18:30.280 --> 18:35.000]  psychologically warfare select them who like sticking hands down pants who likes setting people up
[18:35.720 --> 18:40.200]  who likes robbing who enjoys it who wouldn't worry about the radiation scanners they've
[18:40.200 --> 18:46.520]  culled down getting their agents to do more and more to this army that is now going to lead
[18:46.520 --> 18:54.280]  private security forces merc forces in america this is the complete battle plan you're being given
[18:55.160 --> 19:00.840]  and they have state guard national guard under tsa command tsa three months ago pull
[19:00.840 --> 19:04.760]  watson wrote articles about it i'm getting it added to curt's article there's no developments i'm

[38:13.000 --> 38:16.360]  have government cameras inside the house they're calling for that in england they're calling for
[38:16.360 --> 38:22.840]  that in houston it's this idea but who watches the watchers it's this tyranny in the name of
[38:22.840 --> 38:31.480]  security it has nothing to do with it now continuing tsa to oversee searches at santa fe prom saturday
[38:31.480 --> 38:37.000]  night a certified tsa official will be at the santa fe high school prom to oversee student
[38:37.000 --> 38:44.680]  searches this all comes after two capital high school students listen to this this is oh you don't
[38:44.680 --> 38:49.400]  like that we grabbed your body parts at the airport we're coming to your school honey
[38:49.400 --> 38:54.600]  now listen to this and they have a link to it this all comes after two high school students
[38:54.600 --> 39:01.640]  sisters followed a lawsuit saying they were grope by a security agent at capital high schools prom
[39:01.640 --> 39:06.680]  last month but there's also another report i have about lawsuits in santa fe separately with with
[39:06.680 --> 39:12.840]  people but i got those two confused this is in the school so the answer is oh you don't like how we
[39:12.840 --> 39:17.960]  have tsa type training to grab your breasts that's what they say in the newscast you don't and the
[39:17.960 --> 39:23.560]  newscast acts like they're bad that they didn't like this the newscast sits there with a straight
[39:23.560 --> 39:33.240]  face and reports this like it's a good thing see they report bizarre crazy things it's like cbs news
[39:33.240 --> 39:37.160]  all over the country sent news packages so the local news reader reads it but it's centrally
[39:37.160 --> 39:41.480]  controlled but it gives it the local look study show you trust local news more it's most of it
[39:41.480 --> 39:47.160]  federally written by the feds up at cbs broadcast center that came out in 2000 there's a huge cia
[39:47.160 --> 39:53.080]  defense department contract and that cbs writes the news for three other major news agencies what was
[39:53.080 --> 40:05.000]  it nbc abc and one other and cbs here locally said mercury is good for your child's brain
[40:06.280 --> 40:12.120]  mercury shots help your child's iq oh you don't believe me and later i'll play that clip since
[40:12.120 --> 40:16.840]  you don't believe me that mercury helps your brain the government says so this all comes
[40:16.840 --> 40:21.560]  up for two capital high school students sisters follow a lawsuit saying they were grope by a
[40:21.560 --> 40:26.760]  security agent at capital high schools prom last month on friday the court ordered santa fe public
[40:26.760 --> 40:32.760]  schools and the security company as i see private security could provide at least one tsa certified
[40:32.760 --> 40:39.720]  person at the santa fe prom and high school graduation oh see they tsa in the last nine years
[40:39.720 --> 40:45.240]  has created this this new system of certification where you go in the pants you go between the
[40:45.240 --> 40:50.280]  legs you grope everyone everyone must be searched they're now announcing they wanted at malls grocery
[40:50.280 --> 40:56.200]  stores turning them into tattletale prison grids with telescreens saying watch your neighbors i mean
[40:56.200 --> 41:04.600]  this is a completely alien atmosphere being created of alien to liberty and so the answer is oh we'll
[41:04.600 --> 41:12.680]  have a fed certified there's no law that the tsa can do this they're just saying we have the precept
[41:12.680 --> 41:17.640]  the fewer precept to do what we want just like the john you memo said the president could do it
[41:17.640 --> 41:22.680]  every once he can order torture secret arrest a suspension of congress did you know under the
[41:22.680 --> 41:28.440]  executive order that bush signed in fact i forget the number um remind me to look it up during the
[41:28.440 --> 41:32.200]  next break so they've got several browsers open right now but stuff i already called for um
[41:35.400 --> 41:41.080]  let me give you the exact headline uh it'll be uh bush executive order allows president to suspend
[41:41.080 --> 41:47.880]  congress for any emergency any emergency they deem including economic or any other at the discretion
[41:47.880 --> 41:53.160]  of the president so see we're under martial law right now they just don't call it that and obama
[41:53.160 --> 41:58.440]  continue that executive order so they're operating and that's how they're doing this so they say
[41:58.440 --> 42:03.320]  we bring a martial law officer the national security force just as big and just as strong
[42:03.320 --> 42:10.280]  as our military that obama called for that bush began to set up an earnest and so now that you have
[42:10.280 --> 42:16.040]  one of these anointed ones now our private security agency can stick their hands down your
[42:16.040 --> 42:23.720]  12 year old daughter's pants continuing on friday the court ordered santa fe public schools and the
[42:23.720 --> 42:29.480]  security company asi to provide at least one tsa certified person at the santa fe high school prom
[42:29.480 --> 42:37.400]  and the capitol high school graduation the restraining order also spells out the specific
[42:37.400 --> 42:44.120]  way security can perform searches see now it's a right oh it's your right we're going to protect
[42:44.120 --> 42:51.080]  your rights by having tsa here see how it's all upside down it says a pat down is only to be used
[42:51.080 --> 42:55.000]  if there's reasonable grounds and the pat down should not be used as a first approach for every
[42:55.000 --> 43:01.320]  student but tsa abridges all of that ko bi witness four talked to one of the sisters suing the
[43:01.320 --> 43:07.720]  district earlier this week kandace herrera said she grabbed my breast and shook the inner part of
[43:07.720 --> 43:13.320]  my bra and shook it and then picked up the front of my dress to mid-high and she was patting down
[43:13.320 --> 43:20.920]  my bare legs who do you think wants that job well criminology go take some criminology courses
[43:20.920 --> 43:26.360]  out of the gates search the part about those that try to join law enforcement those that try to get
[43:26.360 --> 43:34.680]  into uh truancy officers that's the highest group capital principal told us she was standing right
[43:34.680 --> 43:38.280]  there when the students were searched and doesn't remember any students complaining about the pat
[43:38.280 --> 43:44.120]  down so if they say you didn't complain that's consent you let the vampire in meanwhile santa
[43:44.120 --> 43:47.880]  fe public school says it's happy to comply with the federal court's decision saying students safety
[43:47.880 --> 43:55.800]  is a priority borders are wide open mass murder going on all over southern new nexaco south texas
[43:55.800 --> 44:03.960]  nevada lawlessness mass graves being found every week not a problem no the feds put up signs saying
[44:03.960 --> 44:09.720]  just don't go into these areas of arizona and mexico and texas they're not safe we've given it over
[44:09.720 --> 44:22.920]  to mexico but but you complain you file a lawsuit we'll just send the feds in claiming they can
[44:22.920 --> 44:27.320]  wave a magic wand and now it's okay they can wave a magic wand and say do you doesn't hurt the troops
[44:27.320 --> 44:31.560]  they can wave a magic wand and say the dust at ground zero safe to breathe no mask needed
[44:32.200 --> 44:37.400]  but it turned out they knew exactly the opposite they can wave a magic wand and spy on everybody
[44:37.400 --> 44:42.040]  and order all the cell phone manufacturers to spy on you in real time and upload the data to the
[44:42.040 --> 44:47.560]  nsa offices built into every telecommunications hub as i told you years and years more than a decade
[44:47.560 --> 44:52.440]  before mainstream media reported that my point is i'm not making this up all i do is study what
[44:52.440 --> 44:59.080]  they're doing now here is the good news and it's up on drudge report dot com right now it's also
[44:59.080 --> 45:04.600]  red linked on info wars dot com cart nimo last week it was announced that tsa goons would conduct
[45:04.600 --> 45:09.480]  grope downs of students during prom night at santa fe high school the tsa promised to move
[45:09.480 --> 45:16.280]  from airports into new mexico high school after two girls said security personnel groped them
[45:16.280 --> 45:20.440]  and a federal judge ruled that tsa should conduct pat downs at dances and graduations
[45:20.440 --> 45:25.560]  or you're complaining about the tsa doing groping at the airport we'll just move into your schools
[45:25.560 --> 45:28.680]  the judge's ruling indicates the federal government and the tsa believe they should
[45:28.680 --> 45:37.000]  be conducting searches so see where where where are the states saying well since when do the feds
[45:37.000 --> 45:41.160]  just 20 years ago fbi had to get permission to come into your county or city they had to go to
[45:41.160 --> 45:47.480]  the police chief or the liaison for permission now they run the threat fusion centers now they
[45:47.480 --> 45:52.440]  give supplemental pay to the local police and others that are in them now they're federal agents
[45:52.440 --> 45:57.960]  now they're going to be at your high school sticking their hands down your pants the judge's
[45:57.960 --> 46:01.800]  ruling indicates the federal government the tsa believe they should be conducting searches the
[46:01.800 --> 46:09.960]  tsa has moved from airports to train and bus stations tsa boss depolitano mr depolitano has
[46:09.960 --> 46:15.800]  said that uh he believes he envisions i'm sorry she envisions thought it was mr madow the agency
[46:15.800 --> 46:21.160]  ultimately groping citizens at malls and hotels we have a link to that and they're putting out tv ads
[46:21.160 --> 46:25.800]  showing them in the mall searching you but don't worry disney world makes you do it to go into the
[46:25.800 --> 46:30.920]  new rides the hot new ride don't worry the new fancy clothiers have the same body scanner oh this
[46:30.920 --> 46:37.080]  happens to be a biometric reader for a perfect fit as 11 years ago i first reported on the fact that
[46:37.080 --> 46:43.080]  that's what these companies developed it for it's a biometric scanner they're getting your biometric
[46:43.080 --> 46:48.760]  data so they have got passive as why i reported a few months ago cameras that send out radio waves
[46:48.760 --> 46:53.480]  through your clothes even if you're wearing a mask or a fake nose it scans the wet and
[46:53.480 --> 46:59.560]  ripped of your chest does a calculation your legs your walk it can scan the back of your hand and get
[46:59.560 --> 47:05.160]  a hundred percent mark on it these systems are already in worldwide england had them in a decade
[47:05.160 --> 47:13.480]  ago but they got to get the biometric 360 scan that's at the airport that's at the clothier that's at

[47:20.840 --> 47:25.480]  conduct the searches at the santa fe high schools as promised government searching students is now a
[47:25.480 --> 47:30.440]  well-established practice at public schools city of austin tells them stop doing it with the

[47:49.320 --> 47:54.200]  allowed santa fe school to use state police to search students everybody's a prisoner
[47:54.200 --> 48:00.200]  koat does not want the media to share the video we have a link to a youtube of it and this was
[48:00.200 --> 48:04.280]  printed before kurt added all of his new information to the article please print me the new one thank

[48:15.240 --> 48:20.040]  where they're trying to acclimate everyone this is an outrageous newscast exactly what you would
[48:20.040 --> 48:25.240]  expect out of a fallen republic what you would expect out of a futuristic soviet union here
[48:25.240 --> 48:29.640]  they are with a straight face saying why do people mind it's normal to have your breasts grabbed here
[48:29.640 --> 48:36.440]  it is tomorrow night a certified tsa official will be at the santa fe high school prom to oversee
[48:36.440 --> 48:40.520]  student searches heather mills is live in the newsroom with why a federal court
[48:40.520 --> 48:45.640]  ordered the district to make these changes heather well this all comes after two capital
[48:45.640 --> 48:51.480]  high school students sisters filed a lawsuit saying they were groped by a security agent
[48:51.480 --> 48:57.480]  capital high schools prom last month today the court ordered santa fe public schools and the
[48:57.480 --> 49:04.280]  security company asci to provide at least one tsa certified person at the same high school prom
[49:04.280 --> 49:09.240]  and the capital high school graduation the restraining order also spells out the specific
[49:09.240 --> 49:15.720]  ways that security can perform searches it says a pat down is only to be used if there is reasonable
[49:15.720 --> 49:21.960]  ground and that pat down should not be used as a first approach for every student oh we talked to
[49:21.960 --> 49:27.640]  one of the sisters suing the district earlier this week she had grabbed my breast and then
[49:27.640 --> 49:33.240]  grabbed the inner part of my bra and shook it and then she uh picked up the front of my dress to
[49:33.240 --> 49:39.160]  like mid thigh and she was patting down my bare leg capital's principal told us she was standing
[49:39.160 --> 49:44.200]  right there when students were searched and doesn't remember any students complaining about the
[49:44.200 --> 49:49.400]  pat downs meanwhile santa fe public school says it is happy to comply with the federal court's
[49:49.400 --> 49:55.400]  uh let's stop there saying student safety a why are federal courts involved in a school
[49:56.360 --> 50:02.280]  why are they doing pat downs at the school then they're not pat downs she noticed they
[50:02.280 --> 50:06.760]  don't even deny that they're grabbing the legs and the breast it's well nobody's complaining well
[50:06.760 --> 50:13.080]  here she is complaining lady it's all psychological warfare well i didn't see anybody complain if you
[50:13.080 --> 50:16.920]  went up to that principal in a park and stuck your hands between her legs or grabbed a breast
[50:16.920 --> 50:22.360]  you'd spend five years in the state pen but because they're the government they do this total
[50:22.360 --> 50:26.760]  fourth amendment violation training our kids to be slaves and they say well we don't do it in all
[50:26.760 --> 50:30.440]  cases remember at first not everybody had to take their shoes off then everybody did then
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.520]  not everybody had to take their jacket off only if they asked now take it off not everybody got
[50:34.520 --> 50:38.520]  their laptop searched now everybody does not everybody had to go through the body scanner now
[50:38.520 --> 50:44.200]  tsa says they want everybody to and have a grope first it was on the outside of the pants now it's
[50:44.200 --> 50:49.400]  on the inside more more more more more because if they can stick their hands down your six-year-old
[50:49.400 --> 50:54.680]  daughter's pants if they can grab ron paul's genitals if they can put their hand into the
[50:54.680 --> 50:59.640]  anus area that's in the federal filing of jessie ventura then they can do whatever they want to you

[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:16.680]  spells out the specific ways that security can perform searches it says a pat down is only to
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:22.680]  be used if there is reasonable ground and that pat down should not be used as a first approach
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:29.560]  for every student we talked to one of the sisters suing the district earlier this week she had grabbed
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:34.840]  my breast and then grabbed the inner part of my bra and shook it and then she uh picked up the front
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:41.160]  of my dress to like mid thigh and she was patting down my bare leg capitol's principal told us she
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:46.520]  was standing right there when the students were searched and doesn't remember any students complaining

[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:48.920]  the new york times was forced to admit last week has a bigger effect setting the news agenda than
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:54.520]  the new york times does and it's been like that for a decade it's just these people uh are
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:02.360]  delusional and and and and are just now realizing that that people don't trust them

[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:12.520]  presidential decision directive that created the order and it was nspd 51 and the potential
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:18.440]  for a coup d'etat by national emergency well this has already happened and and and that's why
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:24.120]  john u and albert Gonzales said that the president is above the law and he can do things that would
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:34.200]  be illegal for anybody else to do and this of course was signed uh back in may night 2007
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:43.960]  nspd 51 national security presidential directive national security presidential directive 51
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:48.360]  this policy establishes national essential functions prescribes continuity requirements
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:52.520]  for all executive departments and agencies and provides guidance for state local territorial
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.680]  and tribal governments and private sector organizations that's the clergy response teams
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:03.080]  the infraguard spy teams and private industry in order to ensure a comprehensive and integrated
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:08.360]  national continuity program that will enhance the credibility of our national security posture
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:13.080]  and enable a more rapid and effective response to any recovery from a national emergency
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:21.160]  and it goes on to say any emergency including economic and it goes on to say for six months
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:35.720]  in annex a that congress can be suspended the plan shall be submitted to the president for
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:44.280]  approval not later than 90 days after the date of directive oh i remember the other headline to

[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:55.960]  can actually find the mainstream news articles that deal with it i believe it was nbc and ap
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:02.440]  homeland security committee not allowed to see president's emergency plan
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:10.360]  and what was the congressman there's a youtube clip of him saying the head of homeland security
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:15.640]  department in the house that's co-equal to president in the separation of powers is not
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:21.400]  allowed to see it because the synopsis says that they're a dictator now obama has continued this
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:30.440]  and expanded nspd national security presidential directive 51 and you can go read the whole thing
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:36.440]  if you want in fact guys just click through the link on that and print me nspd 51 because folks
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:43.640]  need to understand how is tsa saying there's no rules no regulations on us we can have radiation
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:49.480]  projecting machines and not have them tested when federal and state laws say hospitals you name it
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:55.720]  have to do this why can't fbi agents take their hands down your pants without a warrant but tsa
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:03.160]  can't how can the fed suddenly be in local jurisdiction at at prom night because they're
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:09.400]  operating under war powers act they're operating outside of law and they admit they are
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:18.760]  you notice obama abc news reported friday obama came out to uh senator rand paul and others in
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:24.440]  the senate saying hey we've been in libya for months us advisors bombardments they sunk eight
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.880]  libyan warships last week uh you're gonna need to go to congress and get you know war authorization
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:35.640]  that's the constitution and obama said i don't need that really why do all the other presidents
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:41.080]  need it i have the u n's authorization and this is about the credibility of the u n making them
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:46.520]  the boss that's a quote in the public letter president just puts out a letter now i don't
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:52.440]  need a stinking congress i put a letter out and then when you get a republican in they're going
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:57.000]  to continue this when you get a democrat in it's always just expanding with this huge power grab
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.600]  grab you can search that headline uh homeland security a congress not allowed to see
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:14.200]  bush emergency plan congress not allowed to see continuity of government program i mean i've given
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:20.520]  you the pdd but i want to i want to go over congress itself can't see this because the
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:25.880]  out of control criminal executive is bought and paid for by the offshore banks that give
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:33.960]  of the largest percentage of political contributions to the presidential candidates they own them
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.680]  they stack their entire administrations with these people

[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.120]  going to be at prom's i mean whatever happened to to states rights here is the national security

[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:43.800]  and i appreciate it this is all public that's what's so frustrating well my first question about it
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:49.720]  being so public is i've noticed that it's going after the younger age group and the only question
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:54.920]  i have is how do we get a hold of the younger age group to make them more aware of this group that's
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:26:01.000]  going on to imprison themselves with them not being able to understand how it's being put into place
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:09.960]  well we uh without even trying to target the youth with the message of liberty uh this information
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:16.520]  info wars dot com is huge uh in public schools and private schools all over the country uh and
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:24.840]  many of the young people write articles in their in their history classes in their english classes
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:31.240]  uh on the new world order uh a lot of school papers i see them every few days college and
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.920]  high school write articles just about our work because i have you know the nsa google alerts so
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:41.880]  i get sent literally hundreds of articles no exaggeration hundreds of blogs but then dozens
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:47.720]  of mainstream news articles all over the world every day with the youth were even bigger in eastern
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:54.600]  europe because just 20 years ago they were going under tyranny so they recognize what we're going
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:06.280]  into we're huge in Czechoslovakia the Czech republic uh romania uh wealthy areas of europe
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:13.800]  western europe uh germany switzerland the swiss really are anti-new world order i've got a report
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:18.840]  on that today you know anti-globalism spreads in switzerland the young people love the military
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:25.400]  well yeah because they all have guns citizens by law have to have guns uh swiss refused to give up

[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:41.480]  we said there we're doing this because they're now going to roll out their offensive for tsa on the
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:49.400]  streets and tsa is the marshal law force to command and certify the private security guards
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:57.160]  your local police uh they are the addled untrained idiots that will violate the constitution
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:01.160]  bill of rights wholesale and stick their hands down one-year-old babies diapers so they'll
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:05.800]  they'll follow any order they'll sit there and roast in radiation scanners with the back scatter all

[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:46.280]  globalists that's what's so frustrating they're easy to beat if you believe in the power you have

[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:59.800]  everywhere in the world but the globalists are masters at at hiding in plain view they as dr
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.720]  connet said six months ago in studio and three months ago in studio and last week in studio
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:11.640]  the big achilles heel is the radioactive isotopes that are mined in the float sodium fluoride
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:17.640]  fertilizer mines that by law they can't put this on food crops they put sodium fluoride on it they
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:24.120]  use it as pesticide but they can't put the byproducts which are hundreds of different
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:29.960]  deadly chemicals including radioactive isotopes on the crops so instead of having to store the
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:35.800]  toxic waste they dump it in your water and make you taxpayers pay for it and so everybody's running
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:40.360]  around in texas and other states now that people inside government know about this because our
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:47.560]  show it was admitted in minnesota and texas eight years ago then three years ago in lawsuits in
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:51.720]  minnesota were first and in texas and we contacted the people that sued and won and they were listeners
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:56.040]  of the show and they said yeah i heard your show we've had them on with their lawyers i heard your
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:00.760]  show and i heard you say they take baby's blood at birth and put it in a dna database and i didn't
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:05.880]  believe it so i said don't take my baby's blood at the hospital and they said oh it's the law which
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:09.880]  it isn't and they uh no you're not gonna well it's a mandate they call the doctor in the health
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:14.840]  department demands this then the family finds out it's a federal grant they let them take the blood
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:20.840]  then they do lawsuits and got the documents in minnesota and then texas how it goes to a pentagon
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:29.080]  database started in 1972 is that 39 years ago was it 40 yes 39 years ago 38 years ago point is
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:36.360]  and all over europe and and uh australia new zealand globally so we already have a global
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:43.480]  scientific dictatorship of standardization there it is dh hs turned over hundreds of dna samples to
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:50.280]  feds hundreds kind of love the texas tribune whitewash all children born in hospitals uh since this
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:55.560]  went in in the early 70s from australia to germany the u.s to canada had their blood taken to be put
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:01.560]  in here in the u.s it's stored in san antonio for this region but the samples are then categorized
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:07.080]  into the colesprings harbour idm dna weapon database also you may have heard of colesprings
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:12.760]  harbour that's the u.s head office for the formerly the u.s head eugenics records office

[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:56.360]  tell people all this stuff that you tell me and they discredit me because of my young age and uh
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:02.200]  they're certain i'll scum move on move on from those jellyfish i don't i don't understand how
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:06.200]  many rights we have to lose in the name of national security for people to actually stand up and
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:11.400]  realize that this is going on you know this is all classism this is classism i'm sorry go ahead
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:15.800]  now i'll answer this type of classes and the most folks don't think about go ahead uh my question
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:21.320]  for you is uh when it when when we start taking action man i mean every day i look on the news and
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:25.560]  i see problems in the middle east and our rights being taken away and the people being suppressed
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:30.360]  the only answer this is revolution and i know you don't promote the the violence but it's going to
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:33.960]  get to the point and the problem is when it gets to that point it's going to be too late for these
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:40.040]  people that don't see it well i think it's wrong uh to be angry at people that put poison in your
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:44.520]  water and murder children i mean it's wrong to even talk about defending yourself or some type of
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:51.080]  extremist him and my point exactly that's it's it the society makes it seem like it's wrong
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:54.680]  by the way i know there's cops driving along in their car laughing right now those that haven't
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:59.480]  checked into what i'm saying hey look they are putting radioactive isotopes that are going to
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:04.200]  kill you down in the hammer in your water jack you you may think it's funny boy but i'm your friend
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:08.200]  here warning you you think you want to be a warrior to defend humanity why don't you wake up and
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:11.960]  break your conditioning because the first part of being a warrior is having your head screwed on
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:17.800]  straight and not buying propaganda that too in the cops with as far as the cops go on the side
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:22.360]  of their car that says protect and serve i wonder who they protect and serve because when it comes
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:26.360]  down to it all it seems like they're trying to do is fee me they're not per se protecting and
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:30.600]  serving the people they're protecting and serving the government you know they position the cops where
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:34.200]  they say government's bankrupt you got to raise more money or you're going to lose your jobs the
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:39.800]  cop goes out and does it and that's an artificial situation where they do the austerity cuts and
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.640]  of course it never fixes anything they're just always lying telling them we've got to do more
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:47.880]  we've got it's all part of psychology tim did hear from you i want to break down this whole statement
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:53.400]  about you're young you you can't have a view and then you're 30 well you still can't have a view and
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:57.800]  then while i'm retired i don't care about what's happening in the world they've designed all this

[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:20.040]  this is a horrible road we're going down every other country goes through it and the cops always
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:25.800]  get entitled and get all hyped up into what they're doing and and and and tend to take the bait

[02:00:53.640 --> 02:01:00.520]  to make yeah uh these these officers like you mentioned we knew i knew about the riot officers

[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:12.440]  students and an rotc student and these these punks just let let these idiots tear down the
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:16.680]  south no they're not idiots they work for them and they're setting up liaisons with the threat fusion
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:21.480]  centers and the colleges to hire the provocateurs and i did see that in the press we should do a
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:27.160]  whole report on that i know gary franchi did an excellent one uh but yeah rotc and part of the
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:32.040]  law enforcement school of course that's how they it's fun for them they were caught in seattle
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:38.280]  they were caught a few years ago uh in canada at the uh north american union meeting on record
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:42.760]  the media had to admit yeah it's true the cops dressed up like anarchist and attacked other cops
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:48.760]  so they could then attack old ladies and people with strollers i mean these cops are so evil
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:52.600]  they know the government ships and the drugs they catch you whether they take you to prison

[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:03.560]  from cops planting bombs to blame it on us do you understand julio how evil this is
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:09.000]  oh i mean i mean it's for our safety alex they have to do this because uh you know we could
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.840]  be domestic terrorists but if you're gonna do a report on this alex i have more videos that
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:17.000]  have yet to release i would love to help you on this video because we need to get the word out

[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:26.360]  up releasing that video that went around the world yeah i tried to at least uh but alex really quick
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:30.680]  i could stay on hold i can give you my information but i want to give you a false flag news because
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:36.520]  i believe july 4th 2011 we could have a false flag attack this was from chicago breaking news
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:43.080]  uh this was from may 10 13 days ago us gives uic that's university of illinois at chicago
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:49.960]  14 million dollars for bio warfare counter agents the department of justice just gave uic
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:58.280]  a grant to create uh to create some antibiotics to fight anthrax and a bunch of plague uh diseases
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:04.760]  and who launched the anthrax attack it's admittedly u.s government strain not who they said of course
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:09.720]  it was uh and i predicted that would happen a month before it did on the day of 9 11 because i
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:15.320]  know how they operate i can see the preconditioning and yes they use these drills as the cover to run
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:21.000]  real terror attacks so if they get caught they say it was part of the drill alex i could stay
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.240]  on hold if i can you know talk to whoever to get more of this information out there and what happened
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:31.080]  to us alex literally they went they had l red sound cannon weapons pointed at apartment complexes

[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:52.440]  we're shopping and he just lets the dog go and it's about we'll stick our hands down your pants
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:57.240]  we'll attack old women it's about training us and then they could find no one resisting them the
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:01.720]  city of pittsburgh rolled over to total evil they had private security goons doing snatching
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:07.160]  grabs on video so they went to the university to college students out at eight o'clock at night

[02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:26.600]  it is very sad to have to indict the police and the military to a certain extent but i've
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:30.360]  been to the urban warfare drills i've been to the real events my crew has been to the events

[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:42.440]  uh break a few things set some fires or get the local rotc students to do it and then they
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:47.800]  attack the general crowd and we caught them doing it at the g20 and and and then we had the police
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:53.240]  come after my guys uh and and tell them we hear you're trying to attack a military base and my
[02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:59.160]  guys are like what because we tried to call the military base where they were dispatching the

[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:13.160]  you're a terrorist they're trained you're one meanwhile it's their bosses carrying out the
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:20.840]  terror attacks and the low-level police think it's funny to start fights to burn things to knock
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:27.080]  things over and then blame it on us and oh look you're a terrorist now we can fire rubber bullet
[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:33.880]  sets you like that girl coming out of the red sox game walks out of a bar about to graduate college

[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:06.280]  when everybody cowered in fear they said where can we find they said five miles away there's college
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:10.920]  students out at the college park they said let's hit them and hit them hard and they hit them hard
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:14.680]  and our guys were there and when they said get out of the park they tried to leave and they
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:21.000]  blocked them in and said you don't understand we're getting ready to take america down we work
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:26.280]  for offshore banks that have robbed the entire country blind and we're gonna hurt you bad and we've
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:31.480]  got women on bicycles trying to get away and the cops just wait till they drive by with that belly
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:36.840]  club and they just knock those people's daughter off that bike and they just get down over her and

[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:49.960]  and they ran in fear and got to the dorms and the cops said nothing's gonna stop us from tasting
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:55.880]  your blood and they went into those dorms and they just broke their heads in and they took
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:11:01.400]  them and rob dude and also lucradowski got arrested and they described just these cops and black

[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:39.240]  but it doesn't matter you get to dress up in a black uniform and beat girls up
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:43.800]  up and now at the universities everywhere
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:52.600]  the main government funding is for these homeland security schools and it's how to be spies and
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:57.640]  how to tattle tail and how to data mine and that's the new jobs that's what america is and then the
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:01.960]  homeland security which works for the military industrial complex they take over what's left

[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:23.160]  those redcoats were law enforcement agents so what if they were taking guns and burning houses down
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:28.360]  he should have liked them they were law enforcement they're you know in mexico when the when the when
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:35.160]  the mexican police murder families uh it's okay because they're cops okay in germany people you
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:40.760]  know i think that nazi germany was bad but according to the mindset today uh those were police
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:44.840]  officers that were killing people and so they were doing their job just following orders i'm
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:52.600]  sorry go ahead scott well i'd like to say i have to agree with uh uh the last call is that there's
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:58.040]  uh a red flag uh didn't happen in chicago here i called you a few weeks ago and said that i've been
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:03.800]  seeing a lot of FEMA fusing prisoner cars and no these aren't the car ron is going to teach you to
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:08.280]  love him just like the white house memos say terror attacks are great they get to grandstand and
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:12.920]  promise they're going to protect you he's going to teach you to love him that was part of what i
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:17.160]  was going to say you know his daddy was the head of the ear gun uh who admittedly that's how they
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:21.880]  drove the british and the palestinians out was bombing what's wrong with an ear gun commander
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:26.280]  and and i mean what's wrong with that don't you trust the don't you trust the ear gun commander
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:32.440]  well it wasn't especially blown up hotels uh yeah that was daddy's specialty and when we went to the
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:38.040]  gulf war rami went and joined the israeli military but he uh but look just trust the ear gun they're
[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:43.400]  going to take good care of you well and silverstein owns a willow center now so well if you don't
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:49.400]  think about that now that was the search tower but everything's fine um i just i just here's not no
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:56.360]  talks ron elix maybe on a friday when you have open line you can um have police officers in
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:01.560]  military and people in the know that know things we're not supposed to know about coming down
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:07.400]  maybe call in and give some inside information so in the world order can know that their stuff
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:15.400]  isn't really in secrecy well that's a great point scott let me point this out state police federal
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:21.640]  marshals fbi we've gotten the training manuals the training videos we put them out everything
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:27.800]  they're doing is already public it's just not in the sunlight and everything they're doing is
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:33.000]  manifest the real intelligence isn't even picked up out of documents mainly because documents are
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:42.360]  normally uh internal propaganda it's the physical manifestation that's that's how you really understand
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:48.920]  the intelligence and they think we're so dumb they don't even do fake drills that is drills like put
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:53.960]  down fake army tanks to confuse the enemy they don't even do that level of propaganda so almost
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:15:00.200]  everything they do that's under the radar use a total manifestation of their program and i mean
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:05.640]  they didn't lie eight years nine years ago about the planned ftsa and the grocery stores and malls
[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:10.040]  and high schools that they said they were going to do this but yes it is good to hear from police
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:15.560]  and military mainly to hear if they're starting to wake up and a lot of them are uh anything else
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:21.160]  there scott yeah it's kind of irritating to watch people watch what's happening in these foreign
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:26.680]  countries as our government goes in a sovereign nation and kills sovereign citizens and they're
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:31.800]  told to do nothing to stop what we're doing to them and it's happening in this country they're
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:37.000]  kicking doors and saying don't resist and the people are just way too asleep in this country
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:41.720]  well that look when they got rid of glass steel they knew that that it meant total
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:46.600]  depression total destruction of the economy and as they position us into deeper depression they'll
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:52.520]  always pose as the savior saying do what we say and we'll make the economy better and we've just
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:56.520]  got to have an awakening that crooks have taken over the government there are a lot of high-level
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:00.840]  people mid-level and low-level in government who are good people they don't like what's happening
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:06.600]  and that's the big reason that i'm still on air is that the globalists aren't old powerful they
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:11.720]  put out narratives or stories and try to get us to buy into them but when we don't buy into their
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:18.120]  stories when we resist them we look we've got 20 plus states passing on the verge of passing laws
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:22.360]  against the tsa groping and the scanners we're we're going to win i appreciate your call good to
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:27.560]  hear from you scott uh james just hung up he was next but let's go to joel in florida then

[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:39.640]  but it's forcing obama out in the open great point joel absolutely no patriot act extension
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:47.240]  which they just admitted last week is used thousands and thousands of times a year in non-terror
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:52.600]  related cases well of course it is including sneak and peaks where they sneak in your house

[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:15.640]  they're oh man oh man oh man uh let's talk to uh chris in florida chrisher on the air
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:23.240]  well a new angle for attacking the water fluoridation issue i just did some research on
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:28.200]  and uh i'll come to find out it's against the nuremberg principles the hay convention the
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:34.280]  juneva convention that uh the water fluoridation or or toxifying the water with this industrial
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:40.120]  slag uh committed under the guise of fluoridation or even though grossly overcharging for the water
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:47.240]  as the privatized water uh occurs uh now it is one of the first stages of genocide under the
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:54.600]  international convention uh is to manipulate uh essential items like water and energy uh and
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:19:01.480]  but i mean yes to to to forcibly medicate is one of the high crimes uh under the nuremberg convention
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:08.680]  yes the ban on employing poison or poisoning weapons uh the ban on employing um are the
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:13.960]  prohibition on destroying objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:20.920]  and uh these are references you can find uh on a document uh just do a web search uh
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:28.120]  uh for war crimes against humanity uh reflections on the legal regime of water during armed conflicts

[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:21.720]  i'm totally calm when i'm researching at home or at work focused and then i get on air and i have
[02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:27.240]  all this news in front of me and i get angry because these crooks are doing all of this to us
[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:32.680]  i know exactly what they're doing i understand their psychological warfare operation their tyranny
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:38.280]  is not debatable it's out in the open and it's getting worse and and and and then i realize
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:43.080]  why i get really mad because i don't like having to risk my life to go up against these people my
[02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:50.680]  name my treasure these are dangerous crooks but that's what our ancestors always had to do the
[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:55.720]  level of tyranny you will live under is the exact amount you put up with if you give into corruption
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:05.720]  no matter how they package it it's over things only get worse and we've got to turn the tide
[02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:12.920]  against these people they're trying to rush us so fast and get so much done that we're just basically
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:21.160]  our heads are spinning but i i say to kind of the dumbed down narcissistic disconnected public
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:27.320]  that goes along with this new listeners people that think this is funny folks tyranny is not funny
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:33.560]  all right i said uh go to your calls and i got a bunch of news i'm gonna hit before
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:40.040]  this hour ends coming up um let's go to uh kelly in north carolina kelly you're on the year
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:46.440]  hey alex um you actually are the first um person i've actually heard that is able to express their
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:54.760]  views and and really draw in a crowd um saying that um i actually was a friend of a reverend manning
[02:25:54.760 --> 02:26:00.840]  and i found your youtube videos on there talking about the birther certificate and of obama and
[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:07.720]  this and that yada yada well i'm not into this conspiracy theory type mess um that's just not
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:12.200]  me but i start to kind of look at the little things and i'm starting to pick up stuff i don't
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:17.720]  know if you know there's been new videos that have just come out over the weekend about a gentleman
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:23.000]  who apparently works for a collection agency and he started to do a little bit of research
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:30.120]  and has now found that obama is has used michelle obama's um social security number that belongs
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:36.520]  to her dead grandfather back in 1816 and this is starting to unravel and it's getting even
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:41.080]  thicker and thicker and thicker and people are not i mean people are kind of passing this by like
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:45.400]  oh it's another one of these donald trump things it's another one of these yeah you know they use
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:51.320]  donald trump to bring it to a head well i haven't seen this new info but uh well uh give me the
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:56.520]  headline on one of the videos or articles give me the headline and i'll look it up uh let me let me
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:02.280]  i'm actually sitting in front of my computer as i'm speaking to you uh one of the articles is um
[02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:08.760]  hold on one second it's it actually shows a clipping of an actual video of this collector
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:17.320]  it's called update the plot thickens debt collector obama's can a connecticut social security number
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:22.840]  also tied to a and then that's it i think it's based off of the birther but you can find a lot
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:30.040]  of this stuff on james uh david manning's um postings and i will also post on your facebook
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:35.320]  page for your for your viewers so they too can have a chance to look at this but this is all
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:40.440]  looking at let me let me just say this though uh kelly and i appreciate you calling you preface
[02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:46.520]  this with i'm not into these conspiracies if richard nixon got up and told you i'm not a crook
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:53.640]  and i didn't order them to break into any hotel uh the watergate and he lied questioning is now
[02:27:53.640 --> 02:28:03.800]  called the conspiracy theory okay uh uh questioning these liars is not a conspiracy theory that's a
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:09.160]  term they use to just move along move along sure there's basically what i call fiction writers online
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:16.840]  who do make up wild conspiracies and and and and basically it's like uh tabloids you're talking
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:21.080]  about bat boy in front of the white house and i've noticed in news of the world and stuff they'll
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:25.800]  have bat boy on the cover and mexican attorney general makes employees get implantable chip
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:32.040]  they'll take you know two-thirds baloney and mix in one-third reality to discredit it at all uh so

[02:36:54.920 --> 02:37:00.520]  kho you've got a bunch of others where there's radioactive isotopes added with the fluoride
[02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:07.160]  now they may try to laugh at you about fluoride still but listen you got them on the lead mercury
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:12.440]  arsenic and radioactive isotopes that are in this toxic waste they call fluoride we have
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:17.000]  these people if you'll just go out and engage them i mean you just heard tim had a victory there
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:25.800]  good job tim man that's exciting oh that makes my day let's talk to ron and california ron you're
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:33.640]  on the air hey alex uh two things uh i don't know if you're aware did you see um on on youtube
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:40.200]  there's a video going around about students who support free speech but uh actually were provided
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:48.200]  a fake petition to sign uh to ban conservative top radio and tv yeah a bunch of people have done that
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:53.000]  a bunch of different activist groups have gone out and gotten uh adults and environmental
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:59.400]  meetings over 90% will vote to ban water because the name is scary dihydrogen monoxide over 90%
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:05.320]  in studies will vote to ban sodium chloride because it sounds scary table salt uh yes and i have
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:09.800]  seen different videos put out by different organizations uh i think mark dice even did
[02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:14.120]  one a few months ago where uh the majority do want to ban free speech and then they are for
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:20.040]  arresting anybody that has free speech yes second second thing was um i did you see that on drudger
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:26.520]  where they the supreme court ruled that's california it now has to release about 140 thousand prisoners
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:32.040]  out of their out of the system i heard about that coming up a few weeks ago before the ruling uh what
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:39.400]  happened uh what was that over police they voted on it today five four and they approved it uh they
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:45.000]  they they approved it and that was because they were framing them correct no i they say that it's
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:49.800]  overgrow my understanding was is that because the prisons are overcrowded now they need to release the
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:54.600]  nonviolent what they do is they release the violent and the government's been caught admitting this
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:59.320]  before to menace people show that folks will then vote for the military industrial complex to have
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:03.560]  more prisons we have more prisons than any other country in the world one of the highest crime rates
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:07.800]  so because of their their colleges that teach people how to be criminals you put a nonviolent
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:12.520]  person in they come out in five years you know with hiv and then nothing to lose and and know
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:17.480]  how to rob houses now supreme court orders california release it to 46 000 prisoners
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:22.840]  justice calia terrible things are sure to happen uh interesting i anything else sir
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:27.720]  yeah well i was just gonna say my take on that is what they want to do they want to put
[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:31.880]  absolutely more police on the streets they take them out they take the prisoners out and then
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:37.160]  they put more police on the streets problem reaction solution appreciate the call you can pull up the
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:41.560]  major studies just search studies nonviolent prisoners kept longer than violent because
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:47.640]  a nonviolent is a good slave worker for 25 cents an hour uh good slave workers good and they
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:52.280]  drive down wages even better than illegal aliens 25 cents an hour that'll bring america down quick
[02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:58.840]  let's go ahead and uh take another call here let's talk to jerry in new mexico where the tsa
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:03.000]  the federal judge is ordered will now be coming in the school sticking their hands down your
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:09.400]  daughter's pants hey alex what i'm trying to find is the judge's name so that we can barrage the
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:14.200]  judicial disciplary board and complain for bad behavior to get that judge removed but i can't
[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:19.480]  find his name who this judge was by the way uh they're spinning it that because the school was
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:24.920]  groping kids the tsa will show them how to do it so it's the feds saving us oh you don't like
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:28.920]  being on the uh oven top well we're gonna put you in the fire how's that sound
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:35.080]  anyway if you could or i'm trying to find out but if that's what i need to do is we just start
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:40.200]  basically barraging these judges disciplary board uh committees and basically complain about what
[02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:45.240]  judges and the police or anybody else that's uh administrative we can maybe get them thrown
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:50.040]  out of you know they have on the news story dealing with if you follow the links uh the judge's name
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:54.600]  is in one of the reports i know i heard it and saw it there's a bunch of links and uh video is posted
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:59.080]  in our article that's a red linked on info wars dot com good to hear from you moving quick now here
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:06.200]  uh let's go ahead and talk to denis just hung up so let's talk to shon in new york shon you're on
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:13.960]  the air hi alex yes hi i wanted to call you know you were talking about tyranny the tsa and things
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:19.320]  that had nature i'm here in new york and i've been screaming at the top of my lungs for about 11
[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:24.280]  years oh they have warrantless checkpoints they have hands down the pants on the streets the cops
[02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:29.160]  talk to the citizens like you are the lowest crud on earth and the citizens just lick their boots
[02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:35.480]  yes i've been there i've seen it everything that's happening with our government and with the tsa
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:41.480]  has been mastered and accomplished in the family courts here in new york oh it's all beta tested
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:49.560]  absolutely no new york is 100 mafia run you know in in a lot of situations what's happening is parents
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:55.000]  are being forced into debt which child support orders they can't meet and then if they push back
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:00.600]  on the system and they fight the orders and they fight the judge's rulings they'll just throw them
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:06.040]  in jail well it's all part of it and that's good because then it only bankrupts the country more
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:09.640]  because the bankers are making this money out of nothing and then we go into debt that's the whole
[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:16.120]  game plan and like you said the thing is that the jails are privatized so it's a win-win for
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:22.120]  everybody yeah the children well that's how the system likes it we have official government plans
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:27.480]  on record charlotte isabee's book breaks it down it's free on her website uh over a thousand pages
[02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:33.320]  she was there had a policy and they are there to wreck the family and destroy any cohesion
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:40.280]  so they can set up a global government and then kill us it's it's you know it's really scary because
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:45.880]  people are going into the system and they believe in that they're going to reveal the truth
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:51.240]  and they're going to show that the law is being broken and what they don't realize is it's corrupt
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:58.520]  all the way from the top down and it's just a lesson in futility it is absolutely uh and and
[02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:02.280]  that's why they want a global government because people then run from the tyranny everybody's
[02:43:02.280 --> 02:43:07.080]  emptying out of new york city and so now that's why bloomberg's involved all over the country trying
[02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:11.880]  to get similar laws passed and they and they they admit this so there's nowhere to run from them
[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:16.520]  there's i mean they it's it's it's just halish i appreciate your call really really great points
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:22.280]  is pastor butch paul uh the hillbilly pastor in in studio yeah john going to him in a moment

[02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:26.920]  that people bring the facts of their city council every look it's outrageous of course it's wrong
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:30.680]  to have them stick their hands down little kids pants and say to keep us safe from al qaeda even
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:36.920]  if al qaeda was real they can't keep us safe it's a power grab uh it's the same on the borders the
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:41.960]  states are moving to protect them the states are moving to in sanctuary cities evil people
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:46.520]  have trained us to lay down that's how they get away with everything all that evil men and tires
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:52.120]  need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing brother don't give your life the only
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:57.800]  time you give your life is if they're trying to take you to a fema camp and long before they do
[02:44:57.800 --> 02:45:02.680]  that they'll stage terror attacks and blaming on domestic groups they'll have lots of police arrest
[02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:07.720]  and then releases to train you to go ahead and be arrested it'll ratchet up and ratchet up you don't
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:13.640]  even want to think you want to reach out to those cops and military a lot of them are good men and
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:20.840]  women are in a trance like everybody else they buy the lies you want to get past the comfort zone
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:32.440]  and be a leader long before long but i'm ready i don't want to die and i love life and all but but
[02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:36.840]  at the same time i'm ready for them to set me up i'm ready for them to arrest me i'm ready for them
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:44.200]  to torture me okay because because because that's what it takes to defeat tyranny and i'm not going
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:50.520]  to miscalculate and let them manipulate me into uh even with a primitive level i understand what
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:56.280]  you're saying about violence that's what comes to mind we're not 10 000 bc here we've got to be

[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:15.160]  republic but it's it's it's it's it's in defense so so speak out against them now say no to them
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:21.640]  now before you feel like you're cornered and you pull up to a checkpoint uh okay jeff thank you

[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:51.000]  and just getting your friends together get a posse together for the republic sons of liberty
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:56.600]  i want to bring up pastor butch paul he's the guy that first broke uh with another pastor
[02:47:56.600 --> 02:48:02.200]  the secret clergy response team documents i know six seven years ago then we got even more documents
[02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:05.960]  and now it's been proven that pastors all over america over a hundred thousand now have been
[02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:10.280]  secretly trained by homeland security to tell their flocks to submit to tyranny and he's up in
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:14.840]  minnesota from west virginia visiting so the hillbilly preacher joins the hillbilly radio host
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:20.680]  alex jones uh both certified hillbillies from hillbilly stock i guess butch is more of a hillbilly
[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:25.720]  than i am he actually grew up in a holler uh but uh butch it's good to have you here with us well
[02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:29.160]  thank you alex just good to join you thanks for having me on day appreciate it we're in a great
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:34.840]  time here in minnesota i'd say that ted is a good griller ted ted he likes to grill outside the studio
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:40.440]  for everybody a couple times a week those juicy hamburgers and steaks now um very al-qaeda-ish
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:44.600]  what do you think of everything that's happening in america how far we've come isn't it really because
[02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:49.160]  the whore churches have been bought and paid for by the new world order and and i think that's given
[02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:53.720]  too much credit i don't even like to add the word church to it i say whore corporations because they're
[02:48:53.720 --> 02:48:59.720]  not a church they are 501c3 corporations and i can prove that i wouldn't say it i myself was a part
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:03.880]  of one for years but when i started figuring this out and tried to explain to the people what was
[02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:10.920]  going on to ask me to leave so i did but the 501c3 churches of the corporations cannot legally stand
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:17.080]  up and do anything and let's face alex the money's coming into them uh pretty well they have nice padded
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:20.840]  pews and they have nice gymnasiums and they don't they don't rock the boat besides they're waiting
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:25.320]  for the raptures but their birthright of freedom has been sold for a ball of porridge absolutely it
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:30.600]  has been and the pastors in 1700s as you as you know were the ones who led the wars i mean the one
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:34.520]  that started revolution war they were the ones who put the fire into people's heart for liberty
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:38.680]  they were the ones who told them that there's only one king and his name is not georgia obama
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:43.960]  this is what we have today but we have a church today that is complacent because well the bible
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:49.800]  warned us many places space in hosea 4 6 and 7 as the people increased as they prospered they
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:53.480]  forgot their god and that's what's happened in america we have prospered herself right yet right
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:59.560]  into another tyranny and boy this tyranny has scientifically covered every angle the only thing
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:03.880]  they're not counting on is people have encouraged and standing up and saying i'm not backing down
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:08.920]  well they yes you're right they covered all the bases i mean hitler been proud to see what we
[02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:13.640]  come up to in this country there's never been a time in history at all that people could be so
[02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:18.680]  so monitored tracked and traced and probed and and controlled never in history this ever happened
[02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:25.000]  like this in america it's really a phenomenon itself had the ability because of prosperity and
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:29.800]  smart people to build the technology to enslave itself now that isn't kind of a sad statement
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:34.600]  it's true well think about all the reports come out now it's not even a big deal when somebody
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:38.920]  dies from a taser now so they up the power not a big deal now when swat teams go to the wrong
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:44.760]  house and kill somebody i mean it's just it's pure evil pastor well within the indiana now
[02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:49.080]  say they go house to house without a warrant yeah why not yeah and now i'm so conditioned i need
[02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:52.840]  to make a big deal out of that the sheriff one of the head sheriffs said we will now do house to
[02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:57.960]  house gun sweeps because there's no fourth amendment now instead of defending and he's there just i

[02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:35.960]  pouring in and it's going to kill you if you don't find the lever to get out of the you know the
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:39.960]  the chamber and that's really what's happening so of course i'm yelling and screaming and running
[02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:44.200]  around like a chicken with my head cut off you know going back back back we've got to do something
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:48.840]  here and then everything we've warned folks just keeps happening because the globalist blueprint
[02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:55.960]  is public butch uh where do you see this country going right now well alex i have to say it from
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:57:01.880]  being on the radio for almost going on 19 years being a pastor for over 30 years studying scripture
[02:57:01.880 --> 02:57:08.520]  history and current events i'll say this is clearly and slowly as a possible can that if we do not do
[02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:13.560]  something now we don't have another year we don't have another six months i don't believe economically
[02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:18.040]  this country is going to collapse probably within six months if we don't do something now there's no
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:23.320]  hope turned around and what i can see happening is is overwhelming but we have to remember alex that
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:28.360]  the god we serve is far greater than the god this world and we must keep that faith in our eyes on
[02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:33.080]  him and do what's right always do the next right thing and don't worry about the consequences
[02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:37.720]  whatever it is is in the hands of a holy god and so that's why i don't get scared i don't get too
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:43.640]  excited i i'm concerned i have six grandchildren in this world i love deeply and i want to change it
[02:57:43.640 --> 02:57:49.320]  for their good but i tell the people to prepare for the worst prepare for the worst and so whatever
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:54.760]  happens you're gonna be okay just just thank you way through it pray you way through it don't panic
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:58:00.920]  because panic leads a lot of bad decisions i agree with you who would have ever imagined that they
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:06.840]  would now try to send the tsa to high school proms to stick their hands down kids pants when the tsa

[03:00:15.240 --> 03:00:32.200]  the gcm radio network okay ladies and gentlemen we are back live uh into the fourth hour pastor
[03:00:32.200 --> 03:00:37.880]  butch paul popped into my ear a few hours ago he's up there visiting the genesis uh studios
[03:00:37.880 --> 03:00:43.240]  in minneapolis st paul minnesota that's actually a suburb and i wanted to get a butch to pop in
[03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:49.800]  with us and talk about what's happening butch what do you think of these christian groups so
[03:00:49.800 --> 03:00:56.120]  called christian groups the same group that on their christian radio network uh 60 plus stations
[03:00:56.120 --> 03:01:01.400]  back in 94 said the world would end in 94 that the rapture would start on a set day and it didn't
[03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:05.640]  and now they've done it again and the media has tried to use that to discredit christians
[03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:11.080]  but in my bible correct me if i'm wrong it talks about after christ comes back the dead in christ
[03:01:11.080 --> 03:01:16.840]  being raptured to meet christ in the air and be given their heavenly bodies i don't see a rapture
[03:01:16.840 --> 03:01:22.280]  anywhere in there but but regardless uh i i've i've read the bible verses where no man know
[03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:27.160]  it's the time of christ's return no not even the the son but only the father you know the angels
[03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:33.400]  don't know uh and but but but these guys say they do uh what do you think's going on there
[03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:38.520]  well i don't want to speak of the modis i'm i would like to thank the modis are pure but i
[03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:44.280]  say this kindly but i have to say straight up and down they're purely stupid uh you're right
[03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:49.240]  no one knows that day and i in my lifetime i know of back in 88 that somebody wrote a book
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:54.120]  entitled 88 reasons why christ will return in 1988 then he changed it to another day another year
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:02:00.360]  you should never do that that does discredit the church uh the world uh the world people worldly
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:05.080]  people get get a real kick out of that where the people make fools out of christians so to speak
[03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:09.640]  well christ will come like a thief in the night no man i mean the bible's full of that why won't
[03:02:09.640 --> 03:02:14.200]  they follow the bible because it's just too much fun i don't know i simply don't know i've never
[03:02:14.200 --> 03:02:19.240]  been on understand the people do such things i've ignored them uh and went on because i knew it wasn't
[03:02:19.240 --> 03:02:24.360]  true i mean we were traveling we were here yesterday in minnesota when it's uh and we're still here
[03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:30.520]  today and you know briefly what about romans 13 they really love to use that romans 13 is one
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:36.280]  of the probably one of the most misunderstood misquoted books in the bible and it would if people
[03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:41.640]  would simply take time to read beyond the first verse and go on through down to least six seven
[03:02:41.640 --> 03:02:47.080]  verses that they would understand that romans 13 is telling christians now i'm talking about people
[03:02:47.080 --> 03:02:53.560]  that really believe in christ that we cannot and should not obey unjust authority because it says
[03:02:53.560 --> 03:02:58.600]  romans 13 that the almighty god has ordained authority he never ordained authority wants to
[03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:02.680]  murder children or solemnize their sons and daughters he didn't ordain that he ordains
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:06.920]  righteous government when the government becomes unrighteous and returns into tyranny
[03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:13.080]  it ceases being an authority period and people should not obey it well if you believe that
[03:03:13.080 --> 03:03:17.400]  romans 13 means submit to any government and people should have loved mal Stalin hitler
[03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:23.000]  julius caesar but expanding on that it's we the people here in america we don't have a king
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:27.960]  and so we should follow the people's uh law uh which is the bill of rights and constitution
[03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:32.840]  exactly and you know the same scripture was was in the bible when the when our forefathers were
[03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:37.320]  here also they apparently did not believe it the way a lot passed today interpreted because
[03:03:37.320 --> 03:03:41.560]  they had a revolution to overthrow a tyrant and i might say this too the tyranny that they were
[03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:50.200]  living under back in 1776 was very very mild compared to what we have today well you're right
[03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:56.840]  and and and they've just marinated us in this tyranny until a lot of people just become acclimated
[03:03:56.840 --> 03:04:06.360]  to it but we have so much food we have baubles entertainment people take that as as their
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:11.640]  rights but but but but your rights are property rights and and rights over your family and and
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:15.880]  so all the things that really have value and the things that created the wealth in this country
[03:04:15.880 --> 03:04:20.600]  they're being removed right now and you notice as the liberties are removed the money the wealth
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:26.600]  is being removed as well i mean i mean the the the two go together you know you and one thing i i have
[03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:32.280]  i'm known for years and try to explain to people that we as a society well i want to say the majority
[03:04:32.280 --> 03:04:36.600]  of people in this country either work forward directly for some form of government local
[03:04:36.600 --> 03:04:42.200]  you know county state or federal or they get some kind of government assistance and this is very
[03:04:42.200 --> 03:04:48.120]  clearly i think seen you cannot be a ward of the state and be a free man it's impossible and they've
[03:04:48.120 --> 03:04:51.720]  set up the economy now where most people can't survive without government contracts for being
[03:04:51.720 --> 03:04:57.160]  on welfare that's right now 45 million people now on food stamps their mission is near completion
[03:04:57.160 --> 03:05:21.080]  folks they're coming after the rest of us free transmission coming up now stay with us
