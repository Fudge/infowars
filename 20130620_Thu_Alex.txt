[00:00.000 --> 00:11.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.360 --> 00:18.920]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.920 --> 00:40.200]  Texas Alex Jones this is going to be another incredibly important jam-pack
[00:40.200 --> 00:47.360]  transmission so please strap yourselves in it is Thursday the 20th day of June
[00:47.360 --> 00:54.320]  2013 now tomorrow I was gonna take off on the radio broadcast and have David
[00:54.320 --> 00:57.800]  Knight sit in because he does a great job with a bunch of important informative
[00:57.800 --> 01:02.160]  guests and he's still doing that tomorrow because I'm having to take off
[01:02.160 --> 01:07.080]  some days quite frankly just to get Obama deception to codified and rolling
[01:07.080 --> 01:12.620]  and done it's gonna blow away the first installment of it the film seen over 40
[01:12.620 --> 01:17.800]  million times online for free I mean I really want to go after the establishment
[01:17.800 --> 01:25.360]  with this one and then right in our lap falls a huge huge movie star who's not
[01:25.360 --> 01:31.320]  normally politically outspoken I'll just leave it at that bigger than Charlie
[01:31.320 --> 01:34.880]  Sheen just to put it to you that way so that's either gonna happen today or
[01:34.880 --> 01:38.400]  tomorrow and if they want it tomorrow I'm just gonna stay like it is and let
[01:38.400 --> 01:42.720]  night to the interview but again we don't really chase movie stars around here
[01:42.720 --> 01:46.240]  it's just that when they you know are politically exposing things things that
[01:46.240 --> 01:49.840]  are important especially when they don't do a lot of that it is it is
[01:49.840 --> 01:55.840]  certainly something that it peaks the interest a bit I get a couple of
[01:55.840 --> 01:59.720]  butterflies thinking about it of course I get butterflies when I see one of our
[01:59.720 --> 02:05.240]  articles linked up on drudgereport.com and drudge has linked this is
[02:05.240 --> 02:09.120]  obviously very important to one of the main Russian ministers calling for a UN
[02:09.120 --> 02:14.840]  run internet kill switch so that is all coming up today speaking of David Knight
[02:14.840 --> 02:26.200]  in the next segment he's going to be in studio with us on Michael Hastings the
[02:26.200 --> 02:32.240]  award-winning associate editor over at Rolling Stone magazine who's broken a
[02:32.240 --> 02:40.840]  bunch of big Pentagon stories muckraking stories his car blew up two days
[02:40.840 --> 02:47.480]  ago and it it blew up Tuesday it wasn't the news till Wednesday and the police
[02:47.480 --> 02:51.280]  instantly said no foul play which is always suspicious the engine got blown
[02:51.280 --> 02:56.840]  down the road witnesses said the car caught on fire and blew up driving down
[02:56.840 --> 03:02.200]  the street and the police are saying the opposite of course I mean they can gun
[03:02.200 --> 03:05.000]  you down now where they have assassins and they'll say you fell and hit your
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.920]  head like Benazir Budo on tape being machine gun and they said she hit her
[03:08.920 --> 03:12.360]  head and there's footage of her was in the front just being sprayed with bullets
[03:12.360 --> 03:19.480]  and I go oh she bumped her head I guess Kennedy bumped his head 50 years ago in
[03:19.480 --> 03:25.480]  Dealey Plaza or a NAT a NAT flew over it was a convertible and hit him in the
[03:25.480 --> 03:28.840]  head and blew his head off and if you don't believe that you're a conspiracy
[03:28.840 --> 03:32.680]  theorist I mean nowadays they would just say the president hit his head today
[03:32.680 --> 03:40.800]  boom head blows off the car boom blows up and so before it was in the main news
[03:40.800 --> 03:47.720]  I was reading okay his car ran into a tree he's dead and I thought on air
[03:47.720 --> 03:52.560]  she had to dig you know the fact you had to dig I image like his car blowing up
[03:52.560 --> 03:56.240]  thinking you know if the car blew up or something they might have killed him but
[03:56.240 --> 03:59.760]  I go people dying car wrecks it's the number one cause of death under the age
[03:59.760 --> 04:08.320]  of about 55 so I said you know maybe maybe you maybe he just did die and then
[04:08.320 --> 04:13.400]  sure enough he had a big story on CIA corruption coming out he had he was in
[04:13.400 --> 04:16.360]  contact with WikiLeaks it was about to do a big data dump and the official
[04:16.360 --> 04:21.000]  WikiLeaks has come out and said they talked to him one hour before his car
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.480]  blew up and he said the FBI's after me that they're investigating me we've got
[04:26.480 --> 04:30.840]  to hurry up and get this done well they got you done the FBI should have just
[04:30.840 --> 04:33.920]  brought him in for questioning and shot him in the top of the head like they
[04:33.920 --> 04:39.320]  did the guy that knew the Zarnab brothers I mean that's the new thing no
[04:39.320 --> 04:43.560]  judge no jury no it just the FBI comes to talk to you you shoot yourself in the
[04:43.560 --> 04:49.760]  top of the head by the beat by the boop you know oh what happened to Michael
[04:49.760 --> 04:55.880]  Hastings oh you won't see him no more his car blew up but the police say no
[04:55.880 --> 05:01.320]  foul play kind of like when they torched Dorner's cabin are we choosing our own
[05:01.320 --> 05:05.560]  destiny or has it been pre-selected for us as we've moved through history every
[05:05.560 --> 05:10.200]  great leader has had to understand the potential of information billions of

[08:51.000 --> 08:54.200]  minutes in the third hour getting into some political issues that should be
[08:54.200 --> 08:57.960]  quite interesting I'll just leave it at that see if it happens it fell in our
[08:57.960 --> 09:02.960]  lap this morning so we'll see what unfolds on that front always surprises
[09:02.960 --> 09:07.440]  here on the broadcast the gang of eight to the L half a's say they have a
[09:07.440 --> 09:12.880]  senate agreement to bolster border security the border is wide open ladies
[09:12.880 --> 09:16.680]  and gentlemen wide open i've been down there i've been all over it i've been
[09:16.680 --> 09:21.320]  the border in california arizona texas new mexico you name it it is wide open
[09:21.320 --> 09:26.320]  the illegals walk right by the board patrol will just arrest a few a day for
[09:26.320 --> 09:29.440]  pr purposes they're ordered not to stop the illegals
[09:29.440 --> 09:33.280]  obama has already legalized all the illegals by fiat because that's what the
[09:33.280 --> 09:36.880]  establishment wants to drive down wages and create a new voting block that's pro
[09:36.880 --> 09:39.560]  tyranny so we're gonna be getting into that
[09:39.560 --> 09:42.880]  uh... situation i think it's newsworthy that ron paul's on yesterday and said he
[09:42.880 --> 09:44.440]  would not vote for this bill
[09:44.440 --> 09:48.680]  but rand paul's and making noises like he is and
[09:48.680 --> 09:51.720]  i understand rand paul's a hardcore libertarian i respect a lot of that but
[09:51.720 --> 09:54.840]  you can't if they're all getting free welfare like ron paul said
[09:54.840 --> 09:56.600]  it just doesn't work
[09:56.600 --> 09:59.480]  i can't go to mexico and get all this free stuff so we're gonna be
[09:59.480 --> 10:01.560]  uh... getting into that
[10:01.560 --> 10:06.960]  huge nsa developments huge police state developments huge google developments
[10:06.960 --> 10:08.800]  it's all coming up
[10:08.800 --> 10:12.800]  today
[10:12.800 --> 10:14.800]  and we're going to be uh...
[10:14.800 --> 10:18.680]  taking your phone calls as well coming up in the second hour
[10:18.680 --> 10:21.880]  but right now i want to talk about the n d a a
[10:21.880 --> 10:25.560]  and the fact that the pentagon is on record in israel other countries are on
[10:25.560 --> 10:29.760]  record saying they'll kill any foreign national in their own country
[10:29.760 --> 10:31.800]  anytime they want anywhere
[10:31.800 --> 10:34.880]  our so-called government
[10:34.880 --> 10:36.520]  goes around the world
[10:36.520 --> 10:41.200]  by letting the janeva convention international law and i wrote
[10:41.200 --> 10:43.920]  bombing
[10:43.920 --> 10:46.680]  sometimes entire buildings are whole villages
[10:46.680 --> 10:50.000]  justice supposedly get one guy that claims a terrorist
[10:50.000 --> 10:51.560]  while they publicly run
[10:51.560 --> 10:58.120]  the majority of al-qaeda worldwide so it's a complete oxymoron
[10:58.120 --> 11:01.760]  our lives are seen not as cheap but actually is garbage to be taken to the
[11:01.760 --> 11:02.640]  curb
[11:02.640 --> 11:05.480]  and there's always been political assassination throughout history and the
[11:05.480 --> 11:07.240]  more corrupt a nation is
[11:07.240 --> 11:09.760]  the more assassination
[11:09.760 --> 11:12.280]  type garbage are going to have going on
[11:12.280 --> 11:16.240]  and the naivete of the public is what is allowing us to go on
[11:16.240 --> 11:17.080]  remember
[11:17.080 --> 11:20.440]  uh... dorner these supposed cop
[11:20.440 --> 11:23.440]  who was running around shooting people in southern california who knows if
[11:23.440 --> 11:25.440]  that's even true
[11:25.440 --> 11:27.920]  i don't know if it's true because they lie so much
[11:27.920 --> 11:30.480]  and they were shooting up innocent people's cars that didn't even
[11:30.480 --> 11:34.920]  you know look like him white women and he's a black guy
[11:34.920 --> 11:38.600]  this is the type of craziness and in the police say on six different radios
[11:38.600 --> 11:39.840]  we're gonna burn him down
[11:39.840 --> 11:42.800]  okay burn that cabin down bring in the fire got it set
[11:42.800 --> 11:45.400]  it's burning good job we burning down
[11:45.400 --> 11:49.320]  and they said all we didn't say that all we did but we didn't mean burning down
[11:49.320 --> 11:51.120]  and that sets the precedent
[11:51.120 --> 11:54.200]  to sit there and burn somebody up in a house
[11:54.200 --> 11:57.080]  and say we're gonna burn it down and then burn it down
[11:57.080 --> 11:59.440]  and then stand back while it burns down
[11:59.440 --> 12:04.000]  and then say we didn't burn it down
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.160]  and there's so many cases pat tillman says i'm gonna come home and talk about
[12:07.160 --> 12:10.040]  how we're growing opium over here and actually run al-qaeda in the Taliban
[12:10.040 --> 12:11.720]  it's all fake
[12:11.720 --> 12:15.000]  i can over to help my brother i gave up a seven million dollar contract
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.920]  uh... he wrote these letters back to family i've talked to his brother he
[12:17.920 --> 12:20.520]  goes i'm coming back on public and they're like no you're not
[12:20.520 --> 12:23.480]  well how do we recycle this guy well he's claiming charge the hill fighting
[12:23.480 --> 12:25.240]  al-qaeda and we kill him
[12:25.240 --> 12:28.240]  and they shot him and he fell down behind a rock and they came over and in
[12:28.240 --> 12:30.680]  front of some of the rest of the squad
[12:30.680 --> 12:33.840]  pentagon hit men inserted that they were able to then
[12:33.840 --> 12:35.160]  testify
[12:35.160 --> 12:40.240]  and the coroner came out and said that pat tillman was murdered
[12:40.240 --> 12:43.600]  the the the army colonel would not lie he said he was shot
[12:43.600 --> 12:47.160]  at a few feet away with a triple burst
[12:47.160 --> 12:48.280]  right across
[12:48.280 --> 12:50.880]  the forehead
[12:50.880 --> 12:54.200]  and they shot him and then from a hundred yards away that they came up he
[12:54.200 --> 12:57.480]  got it said i'm pat tillman they shot him again
[12:57.480 --> 13:00.880]  he fell down he said what are you doing and they came up and they executed him
[13:00.880 --> 13:04.120]  and that all came out
[13:04.120 --> 13:08.240]  they executed him but then said he died battling al-qaeda they blew up twenty
[13:08.240 --> 13:12.280]  three navy seals of seal team six that were in on the fake raid
[13:12.280 --> 13:15.880]  no one on the ship they've now testified shaw the body of the lot and thrown in
[13:15.880 --> 13:17.440]  it's all fake folks
[13:17.440 --> 13:21.320]  now two of the fb agents that arrested
[13:21.320 --> 13:24.880]  the younger of the uh... boston bombing patsy's
[13:24.880 --> 13:26.840]  they fall out of a helicopter and i
[13:26.840 --> 13:29.520]  more seal team six fall out of a helicopter and i they're killing them
[13:29.520 --> 13:30.040]  all
[13:30.040 --> 13:32.880]  then the friend of the brothers who's telling people it was all fake and
[13:32.880 --> 13:34.520]  staged
[13:34.520 --> 13:37.360]  the fb i goes to question him he says they're coming to kill me
[13:37.360 --> 13:40.320]  and then they shoot him in the top of the head
[13:40.320 --> 13:43.200]  and it's a oh we were injured it turns out they weren't injured
[13:43.200 --> 13:46.880]  the yelled at them so they shot him in the top of that they don't even hide it
[13:46.880 --> 13:48.680]  now they could come here
[13:48.680 --> 13:52.360]  say i yelled at him i probably will yell at him and shoot me in the top of
[13:52.360 --> 13:56.360]  the head and folks if they do they murdered me okay
[13:56.360 --> 13:59.880]  and most of you know this you know when i was at the bbc
[13:59.880 --> 14:03.040]  a few weeks ago uh... the
[14:03.040 --> 14:04.880]  times of london rider
[14:04.880 --> 14:09.520]  after i had debated him on air

[14:58.280 --> 15:01.920]  and i'm not saying that people would ask why are even conscious of that of the
[15:01.920 --> 15:05.320]  guy with the times of london it's just that the attitude is there with the
[15:05.320 --> 15:09.840]  system and i'm a scary guy so you know whatever happens happens because the
[15:09.840 --> 15:14.400]  government's building a better world doing this good thing

[15:48.880 --> 15:53.120]  the official wiki leaks one hour before his car blew up driving down the road
[15:53.120 --> 15:56.920]  and he said the fbis investigating me we get we've got to get this story going
[15:56.920 --> 15:58.520]  quick here
[15:58.520 --> 16:01.160]  he was getting info from wiki leaks
[16:01.160 --> 16:04.000]  and then his car the witnesses multiple witnesses said
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.440]  was driving along and caught on fire and blew up
[16:06.440 --> 16:09.720]  and the engines down the street folks you don't hit and have the engine go
[16:09.720 --> 16:12.000]  past the tree down the street
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.920]  and you have the police immediately saying no foul play and then it didn't
[16:14.920 --> 16:16.280]  get any coverage in the media
[16:16.280 --> 16:17.480]  buried
[16:17.480 --> 16:19.720]  took a day for them to bury all by the way the car
[16:19.720 --> 16:23.360]  burn up
[16:23.360 --> 16:28.000]  and then you think about
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.840]  the
[16:29.840 --> 16:31.120]  most
[16:31.120 --> 16:34.120]  you know decorated uh...

[16:38.360 --> 16:41.560]  for what's clearly a sigh up against ventura
[16:41.560 --> 16:45.120]  and then some of some wind up toy comes in guns and down
[16:45.120 --> 16:48.040]  at a shooting range a private shooting range
[16:48.040 --> 16:49.720]  sexy a resort

[16:57.480 --> 16:59.080]  for his dark alliance
[16:59.080 --> 17:03.120]  book exposing cia drug trafficking they try to discredit him said he'd been
[17:03.120 --> 17:06.120]  exposed and it was true he had a new book coming out
[17:06.120 --> 17:08.600]  and he was going to come on my show i talked to him a few months before he
[17:08.600 --> 17:09.480]  died
[17:09.480 --> 17:11.840]  and i've talked to his friends that talked to weeks before
[17:11.840 --> 17:15.320]  he moved his kids out of his house because special forces
[17:15.320 --> 17:18.840]  would break into it he pulled home pull into home they want him to see it and
[17:18.840 --> 17:21.240]  they'd be sliding down the drainage pipes
[17:21.240 --> 17:22.560]  on his two-story house
[17:22.560 --> 17:23.760]  digging through his house
[17:23.760 --> 17:26.080]  so he moved his kids out with his ex-wife
[17:26.080 --> 17:28.600]  moved into another place and they came and shot him
[17:28.600 --> 17:31.320]  twice in the back of the head
[17:31.320 --> 17:33.760]  and the police again instantly said
[17:33.760 --> 17:35.600]  that it was a suicide
[17:35.600 --> 17:37.000]  that's what the telltale sign
[17:37.000 --> 17:37.800]  instantly
[17:37.800 --> 17:41.800]  bright barred all bright barred had health issues they they always tailor it
[17:41.800 --> 17:43.080]  to look like
[17:43.080 --> 17:44.080]  what happened
[17:44.080 --> 17:46.520]  was at a bar with a bunch of people folks
[17:46.520 --> 17:48.520]  the police instantly said before
[17:48.520 --> 17:51.880]  one hour forty five minutes after he was announced dead
[17:51.880 --> 17:56.240]  dead on arrival basically at the hospital the police said no foul play
[17:56.240 --> 18:00.080]  that's always the telltale sign they're in on it they've been given the order
[18:00.080 --> 18:02.760]  shut this down same things with Hastings
[18:02.760 --> 18:06.320]  we're gonna come back for the next couple segments with an in-depth expose on
[18:06.320 --> 18:08.320]  this with the
[18:08.320 --> 18:10.440]  actual femum
[18:10.440 --> 18:14.960]  department of transportation numbers on two percent of people die
[18:14.960 --> 18:17.520]  in a car fire
[18:17.520 --> 18:18.520]  two percent
[18:18.520 --> 18:23.400]  my dad was in a car fire with my sister had a volts wagon that the uh...
[18:23.400 --> 18:25.360]  gasoline hose came off
[18:25.360 --> 18:27.280]  when i was in high school
[18:27.280 --> 18:30.280]  big fire in the back they got out car burnt completely down for the fire
[18:30.280 --> 18:33.480]  department got there
[18:33.480 --> 18:34.440]  two percent
[18:34.440 --> 18:36.440]  ninety eight percent of people
[18:36.440 --> 18:39.040]  don't get killed in a car fire
[18:39.040 --> 18:42.360]  and his car again they said hit a tree in the car fire the witnesses say
[18:42.360 --> 18:46.640]  drive down the road and explodes into flames
[18:46.640 --> 18:49.680]  when you really want to get rid of evidence ladies and gentlemen
[18:49.680 --> 18:53.240]  they've got little chip computer programs they can slap right on a car that
[18:53.240 --> 18:56.840]  will then remote control them with their electronic system with the cars made in
[18:56.840 --> 18:58.000]  the last decade
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.920]  this is how to see how he does it this has been declassified they put you in a
[19:00.920 --> 19:02.240]  car
[19:02.240 --> 19:05.800]  and then remote control it and then blow it up to get rid of the fact they
[19:05.800 --> 19:07.960]  already killed you
[19:07.960 --> 19:10.920]  because people survive car bombs sometimes
[19:10.920 --> 19:11.960]  as well
[19:11.960 --> 19:15.080]  and it's not shaped just right that's why they also even if he was alive
[19:15.080 --> 19:17.480]  like to go with explosive fire bombs
[19:17.480 --> 19:19.640]  because they also tend to
[19:19.640 --> 19:23.200]  uh... burn the person up
[19:23.200 --> 19:25.280]  and i would give it
[19:25.280 --> 19:28.600]  my god is ninety eight percent chance they killed him
[19:28.600 --> 19:30.720]  ninety eight percent chance
[19:30.720 --> 19:34.040]  and again yesterday i said we don't know made his time to car right
[19:34.040 --> 19:35.360]  and then sure enough
[19:35.360 --> 19:38.080]  he's coming out of the big story on the CIA he tells wiki leaks the base of the
[19:38.080 --> 19:39.680]  FBI is after him
[19:39.680 --> 19:41.980]  why didn't the FBI just go to his house
[19:41.980 --> 19:44.440]  time up shoot him on top of the head like they normally do
[19:44.440 --> 19:45.920]  that's all it is is the mafia
[19:45.920 --> 19:47.320]  we have a mafia
[19:47.320 --> 19:49.960]  government in this country right now
[19:49.960 --> 19:53.000]  and you better be praying for info wars and yours truly

[24:11.840 --> 24:17.800]  evidence that Michael Hastings was killed and now the media will go along
[24:17.800 --> 24:20.680]  when they burn down a cabin with somebody in it when they shit somebody in
[24:20.680 --> 24:24.160]  the top of the head during questioning at their house it's not being questioned
[24:24.160 --> 24:28.160]  and that's when you go into a real tyranny they'll start killing thousands
[24:28.160 --> 24:31.880]  of people they'll start arresting people and at that point media and
[24:31.880 --> 24:36.400]  journalists have to start taking precautions to protect ourselves and
[24:36.400 --> 24:42.240]  then if it goes too far things go on the offense that's the only way to stop
[24:42.240 --> 24:45.080]  things like this and they want to start a war they want to have a secret war
[24:45.080 --> 24:50.320]  against journalists they've been having one with the whistleblowers all of it I
[24:50.320 --> 24:56.200]  mean if they kill me folks you know who did it and you know what to do it's
[24:56.200 --> 25:03.800]  gonna leave it at that now David Knight you're here with us one main reason they
[25:03.800 --> 25:06.360]  haven't killed me yet and they've beat me up and threatened to kill me plenty of
[25:06.360 --> 25:09.160]  times is they know if they kill us I have a media organization left behind
[25:09.160 --> 25:13.400]  that's why you're here buddy I've told the crew that privately you're here so
[25:13.400 --> 25:17.320]  they kill me it continues on and I want justice I want reporters there if they
[25:17.320 --> 25:20.840]  blow me up they put me in a room with a hooker you guys work with me you know I
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.440]  don't do that stuff that's right they killed me they killed me period I don't
[25:25.440 --> 25:29.800]  do drugs none of it so bottom line if this happens they killed me this is so
[25:29.800 --> 25:33.560]  obvious we've got newscast they're local but not on the national news where
[25:33.560 --> 25:36.960]  explosion engine fly down the road I mean this is incredible we're gonna get to
[25:36.960 --> 25:40.240]  that this is a short segment we're gonna have you in the long segment coming up
[25:40.240 --> 25:44.440]  this is a larger subject a political assassination but I mean this thing
[25:44.440 --> 25:48.480]  absolutely stinks to high heaven you know last night when I was getting ready
[25:48.480 --> 25:52.560]  to the nightly news I started looking at this and I didn't even get into why
[25:52.560 --> 25:56.280]  this might happen I mean didn't even get into the conspiracy theory aspect of it
[25:56.280 --> 26:01.000]  I'm just looking at this as an accident and it made absolutely no sense to me
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.600]  you know first you hear what's a fiery crash high-speed crash he hits into a
[26:04.600 --> 26:09.560]  tree and the car catches on fire and burns that's the way people typically die
[26:09.560 --> 26:15.200]  in a fiery crash they they get pinned in a car that then is somehow
[26:15.200 --> 26:19.640]  compromised mechanically a fire starts they can't get out and they die that's
[26:19.640 --> 26:24.000]  not what happened here if you look at the eyewitness report the only one they've
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.800]  got is a guy named Louise Cortez and he says he's driving on the road sees a
[26:27.800 --> 26:31.440]  car coming at him at high speed and it jackknifes now I don't know exactly what
[26:31.440 --> 26:34.280]  that means because jackknifing is typically what you're talking about a
[26:34.280 --> 26:38.240]  truck doing this articulated semi-trailer but he said jackknife and
[26:38.240 --> 26:43.760]  pieces flew everywhere then you look at the report that's an explosion yes an
[26:43.760 --> 26:49.160]  explosion if you look at the report from the people that were there they said
[26:49.160 --> 26:52.480]  that it was an it sounded like a bomb shook the whole house rattled their
[26:52.480 --> 26:56.320]  windows and then another guy points to the engine that he said flew 50 to 60
[26:56.320 --> 27:01.520]  yards down from the point that it had stopped and it makes absolutely no sense
[27:01.520 --> 27:06.120]  that an engine is going to fly out of a car at a right angle to the point that
[27:06.120 --> 27:09.760]  it's going when it hits a tree then if you look carefully at the pictures you
[27:09.760 --> 27:13.480]  see that the car is not really crashed it's came to rest up against the tree
[27:13.480 --> 27:16.400]  yeah it's not even really running to the tree it's up against it yeah it's up
[27:16.400 --> 27:19.320]  against it it's kind of a sight that you can actually see the cars exploded the
[27:19.320 --> 27:22.440]  engines flown down the road and you can see the nose what's left of the frame of
[27:22.440 --> 27:25.920]  the car sticking out beyond the tree so it's kind of like it's beside the tree
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.200]  after the fire is out you can see this in this picture from the LA Times and the
[27:30.200 --> 27:33.680]  the nose of the car appears to be sticking out from beyond the tree the
[27:33.680 --> 27:37.960]  fire seems to be concentrated around the passenger area but there's absolutely
[27:37.960 --> 27:42.000]  no way that the car is going to veer off to the left or to the right and well I've
[27:42.000 --> 27:45.440]  seen a hundred photos of car bombs that's what they look like right
[27:45.440 --> 27:48.920]  absolutely absolutely there's a tremendous impact there but the car was
[27:48.920 --> 27:52.480]  not compromised as you would expect when hits a tree and the fact that the
[27:52.480 --> 27:57.280]  engine flew down the road and the fact of this this one person who saw it said
[27:57.280 --> 28:00.680]  the pieces went everywhere I mean that tells you that it blew up all it was
[28:00.680 --> 28:05.120]  going down the road it did not it did not hit a tree catch on fire and then
[28:05.120 --> 28:08.200]  we're gonna get more into this and get into the statistics but tell people
[28:08.200 --> 28:12.760]  about this clip this clip that was this is from the nightly news so we had this
[28:12.760 --> 28:16.360]  last night it was a local news story that had this on there and you'll hear
[28:16.360 --> 28:20.440]  the people the eyewitnesses reports on here let's take a look at that clip
[28:20.440 --> 28:24.440]  Rolling Stone magazine called Michael Hastings a fearless journalist who
[28:24.440 --> 28:29.720]  refused to cozy up to power his death 33 came by way of a fire-fueled and
[28:29.720 --> 28:34.520]  explosive crash it sounded like a bomb went off in the middle of the night my
[28:34.520 --> 28:39.440]  house shook the windows were rattling oh never seen like this for a movie where
[28:39.440 --> 28:45.480]  the engine flies from the car which was about I don't know 50 60 yards up right
[28:45.480 --> 28:50.240]  down here to this telephone pole unbelievable and in the national news
[28:50.240 --> 28:55.720]  it's no foul play ran into a tree they blew that car up maybe we should say a
[28:55.720 --> 28:59.800]  car crashed in the Oklahoma City building yeah a car did well and when you
[28:59.800 --> 29:04.640]  look at that picture the car the engine doesn't look like it's on fire right no
[29:04.640 --> 29:07.840]  it's been blown out it's been blown out and it looks like it's going back part
[29:07.840 --> 29:10.200]  of the transmission there you see the alternator you're an engineer but you
[29:10.200 --> 29:13.600]  notice it's all aiming back from his trajectory being blown out well you're
[29:13.600 --> 29:17.120]  not gonna you're not gonna send the engine down the road at a right angle to
[29:17.120 --> 29:19.760]  the point at which it hits a tree even if it hit the tree but when you look at
[29:19.760 --> 29:23.600]  the pictures again you don't see the body being smashed up against a tree and
[29:23.600 --> 29:27.320]  so we looked at this last night puts a bomb in the dash you can see it right
[29:27.320 --> 29:30.400]  there so it blew back towards him and blew the engine out the front that's
[29:30.400 --> 29:33.160]  right then the car flipped down the road up against the tree that's right
[29:33.160 --> 29:36.520]  absolutely man I tell you folks they could just blow me up and just say oh
[29:36.520 --> 29:41.040]  fire everybody can be like I blew off you know there's an engine 50 yards down
[29:41.040 --> 29:44.760]  the road and no big deal nothing to worry about mr. Gover just the plastic
[29:44.760 --> 29:49.080]  explosives will be you're a little caddy check there this is really scary folks

[33:01.200 --> 33:28.200]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[33:28.200 --> 33:32.400]  David Knight is our guest in studio I'm Alex Jones again David's an info wars
[33:32.400 --> 33:36.960]  nightly news reporter an engineer and he's also an investigative reporting in
[33:36.960 --> 33:41.680]  North Carolina and now of course he's been here with the info wars team what
[33:41.680 --> 33:44.480]  is it six seven eight months now about eight yeah you're doing doing a great
[33:44.480 --> 33:49.320]  job man thank you seriously when I talk about people know what to do if they
[33:49.320 --> 33:53.360]  start rounding us up disappearing us I have worked as hard as I can to be
[33:53.360 --> 33:59.760]  nonviolent I have done everything I can and I if they kill me I don't want
[33:59.760 --> 34:04.320]  people to just go out and randomly you know be violent I want you to
[34:04.320 --> 34:07.960]  aggressively get the word out because I'm not afraid to die I'm afraid of these
[34:07.960 --> 34:11.960]  people run in the world because once you give into a mafia culture it just
[34:11.960 --> 34:16.880]  starts taking over and expanding until there's no society and you collapse like
[34:16.880 --> 34:20.840]  all those third world countries then the argument is well even if you're not a
[34:20.840 --> 34:24.320]  bad person work with the evil because you'll have a better lot in life it's
[34:24.320 --> 34:32.040]  it's it's it's the disease of our civilization and obviously if they
[34:32.040 --> 34:34.840]  start disappearing people in the night Alexander Schultz and Eatzen talked
[34:34.840 --> 34:37.520]  about it how they burned in the camps later wishing they would have done
[34:37.520 --> 34:40.760]  something I don't think we've gotten to that point yet but we need to have a
[34:40.760 --> 34:46.240]  real debate not just about NSA spying and persecuting the Tea Party with the
[34:46.240 --> 34:52.480]  IRS and persecuting pro-life groups who stand up for little babies look how evil
[34:52.480 --> 34:56.720]  these mafia people are that's all it is we're being muscled
[34:57.160 --> 35:03.280]  they are killing people and I David Knight covered it last night a authors
[35:03.280 --> 35:06.360]  come out we know with the history and the New American magazine wrote about it
[35:06.360 --> 35:11.440]  about the Pentagon admits their main tool now is assassination well it's been
[35:11.440 --> 35:18.680]  like that for at least 67 years I mean I know a lot of Army officers Texans who
[35:18.680 --> 35:25.840]  were in a secret assassination groups here in the US and it's not like the
[35:25.840 --> 35:30.320]  people I know or something special ladies and gentlemen it's giant do you
[35:30.320 --> 35:36.680]  understand that and they have got let's be conservative more than 10,000 I would
[35:36.680 --> 35:41.800]  guesstimate current domestic assassins that are that are army and Navy you
[35:41.800 --> 35:46.120]  name it when you become a Navy SEAL or Green Beret or any of the stuff or even
[35:46.120 --> 35:51.160]  Delta Force then there's levels above that okay and and those levels are called
[35:51.160 --> 35:56.920]  the dark side and it's the narcotics it's the it's all of it going on and
[35:56.920 --> 35:59.760]  these are like made men I don't know if you can tell the story about your Navy
[35:59.760 --> 36:02.440]  SEAL friend you were just telling me oh you don't want to tell it no but I mean
[36:02.440 --> 36:08.800]  these guys you know it's just it's disgusting it's not cool it's not tough
[36:08.800 --> 36:13.400]  and they kill each other too I mean no doubt they did a hit on Chris Kyle no
[36:13.400 --> 36:16.280]  doubt all this stuff's going on they will flush you down the toilet in a
[36:16.280 --> 36:19.640]  minute remember hundreds of thousands of Gulf War troops got the Gulf War
[36:19.640 --> 36:22.920]  illness at least 50,000 have died in the 20 years since they knew when they
[36:22.920 --> 36:27.640]  detonated those 200 plus chemical dumps that it was all gonna rain down and
[36:27.640 --> 36:31.400]  soft kill people and that's now confirmed for 20 years the brain stems
[36:31.400 --> 36:36.120]  it's back on the New York Times last Friday again you do not want it there's
[36:36.120 --> 36:41.280]  no honor in this and it's cowardly to blow up this journalist I know he lied
[36:41.280 --> 36:44.680]  to McChrystal and said it was gonna be a puff piece and in their mafia rules I
[36:44.680 --> 36:48.040]  would not be led in by the Pentagon to something and lie to them if I told
[36:48.040 --> 36:51.160]  somebody I'm not gonna you know expose any of your confidences because
[36:51.160 --> 36:55.920]  reportedly that's what he did because I mean it's not just that I don't tell
[36:55.920 --> 36:59.920]  people I'm gonna do something and then not do it I'll tell the globalists I'm
[36:59.920 --> 37:03.320]  gonna try to bring them down I'll tell them I'm coming for them in these mafia
[37:03.320 --> 37:07.840]  rules this is how they operate I'm telling you you mess with their families
[37:07.840 --> 37:11.440]  or you work with them and then lie to them that's what Hastings did your free
[37:11.440 --> 37:16.440]  game now I'm not saying it's good they blew him up but it's another issue here
[37:16.440 --> 37:19.640]  if they can burn down somebody in a cabin say they did it and they're not
[37:19.640 --> 37:24.440]  getting trouble and they can say that they're you know gonna kill people and
[37:24.440 --> 37:29.120]  blow them up and people see a bomb go off and kill Pat Tillman and kill and then
[37:29.120 --> 37:33.080]  kill five members of private Lynch's unit who said that she was cowering in
[37:33.080 --> 37:37.560]  fear they went out and killed them and I told Lynch through channels I said you
[37:37.560 --> 37:41.080]  better go public and say it was all I they'll kill you next like Pat Tillman
[37:41.080 --> 37:44.840]  she went public and said it was all I that's the only reason she's still alive
[37:44.840 --> 37:51.160]  folks this is how they operate you mean nothing to them okay now you've got the
[37:51.160 --> 37:55.080]  floor break all this down go over the history of it what we're facing and then
[37:55.080 --> 37:58.640]  that well Alex like you were just talking about the LA police what they
[37:58.640 --> 38:03.000]  said in the case of Chris Doerner and how they were caught even you could hear
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.640]  the transcripts the audio of the police talking to each other saying burn it
[38:06.640 --> 38:10.760]  down they still denied that they burned it down in this particular incident we've
[38:10.760 --> 38:14.320]  got the LA police department same police department saying the engine's location
[38:14.320 --> 38:18.240]  is evidence that the driver was quote hauling Irish ass and lost control
[38:18.240 --> 38:21.400]  unquote and with the engine torn off the gas lines would rupture and it would
[38:21.400 --> 38:25.840]  start a fire now the engine's not going to go how fast you go in a
[38:25.840 --> 38:29.560]  new Mercedes the engine isn't in parts are not going to go flying it's bolted in
[38:29.560 --> 38:33.600]  right it's that yeah I mean this is not some old rusting Hulk with the engine
[38:33.600 --> 38:38.040]  mounts about to come off this is a new Mercedes and look I flipped a truck doing
[38:38.040 --> 38:41.160]  80 before and the engine didn't come out right rolled it three times right and
[38:41.160 --> 38:44.320]  and so the but they want to say you know they've got a couple of different
[38:44.320 --> 38:48.480]  narratives here one of them is that it crashes into the tree catches fire but
[38:48.480 --> 38:51.840]  then you've got this engine hurled down the road and they say oh yeah well the
[38:51.840 --> 38:54.320]  engine hurled down the road is evidence that that's how the fire would have
[38:54.320 --> 38:57.920]  started but you can't hurl the engine down at a right angle to the point of
[38:57.920 --> 39:01.680]  impact and if the engine hurls down the road as he's going down the road it's
[39:01.680 --> 39:06.000]  an explosion so you have the witness is saying boom it won't come up shook their
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.760]  houses right right this is a very rare occurrence to as we're pointing out and
[39:09.760 --> 39:15.000]  FEMA Department of Homeland Security they were talking about highway vehicle
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.680]  fires and there's about a quarter of a million of them a year typically nothing
[39:18.680 --> 39:22.800]  happens only and about 2% of these do you have a fatality actually the actual
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.680]  number is 2.6% out of every can we document cam that guys sorry not 2.6%
[39:27.680 --> 39:35.520]  it's 2.6 out of every 1000 so it's 0.26 so I was wrong when I said 2% it's 0.2
[39:35.520 --> 39:41.640]  0.26 yeah so that's a less than 1% less than 1% exactly course the as
[39:41.640 --> 39:44.720]  Darren McBrain point out the probability goes up if you're a journalist
[39:44.720 --> 39:49.000]  that they don't like now you're oh yeah they've done those studies on politicians
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.280]  and not just that they fly more they do it with other frequent flyers I saw the
[39:52.280 --> 39:56.640]  statistic like 15 years ago it's probably changed either less or more I
[39:56.640 --> 40:00.440]  don't know where you were something like eight times more likely to die in a
[40:00.440 --> 40:04.200]  plane crash if you were a politician per capita than other frequent flyers that
[40:04.200 --> 40:07.640]  fly the same amount that's right now we covered this on the nightly news last
[40:07.640 --> 40:10.880]  night we didn't go into speculating as to who might this be you know because
[40:10.880 --> 40:14.880]  he's really you know picked off a lot of people from the crystal to he was
[40:14.880 --> 40:17.840]  investigating that he had done investigative reports on the CIA was
[40:17.840 --> 40:22.640]  working on one for the CIA and as you pointed out he had tweeted to wicked
[40:22.640 --> 40:27.360]  leaks that he was being followed by the FBI just hours before he died so there
[40:27.360 --> 40:31.200]  were a lot of people out of it you know as as just like cop of the year Terrence
[40:31.200 --> 40:34.840]  Yankee in Oklahoma City said I got the feds behind me and they tortured him and
[40:34.840 --> 40:38.960]  killed him last phone call his partner and as you're talking about this this
[40:38.960 --> 40:44.360]  assassination government that we've got going on this book is Mark Mazzetti's
[40:44.360 --> 40:47.280]  Pulitzer Prize winning author the name of the book is way of the knife
[40:47.280 --> 40:52.560]  and what he's talking about in this is the fact that Obama is using not just the
[40:52.560 --> 40:56.720]  CIA but he's using the military now for assassination operations that is
[40:56.720 --> 41:01.960]  becoming pervasive and McChrystal was part of running that McChrystal was
[41:01.960 --> 41:05.320]  part of it was head of the special operations forces there right and
[41:05.320 --> 41:08.680]  McChrystal was also involved in the Pat Tillman cover-up you know he was the
[41:08.680 --> 41:13.200]  one yeah they're giving the awards and oh yeah he's trying he's the main
[41:13.200 --> 41:17.560]  suspect he strikes again I forgot McChrystal ran the op and the cover-up
[41:17.560 --> 41:21.720]  of Tillman that's right oh boy so you know you've got this situation where
[41:21.720 --> 41:25.000]  you've got this mass as you pointed out a massive amount of people not just in
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.440]  the CIA but now in special operations in the military and you've got another
[41:29.440 --> 41:33.480]  author who has written an entire book about how assassination and it's not
[41:33.480 --> 41:36.240]  just drone assassination that's something that we look at and we say wow
[41:36.240 --> 41:40.840]  that's that's really cold that's amazing that they're just raining death down on
[41:40.840 --> 41:44.880]  people from the air that's just more visible the invisible things that they're
[41:44.880 --> 41:49.480]  doing with his with all of these special operation forces and with the CIA that
[41:49.480 --> 41:52.520]  as you said has been going on for a long time they just expanded it they've
[41:52.520 --> 41:56.720]  expanded it and they don't even try to cover it up much anymore and you get
[41:56.720 --> 42:01.080]  these ridiculous statements from the LA Police Department with situations like
[42:01.080 --> 42:04.880]  Chris Dornor and again now with this car accident it just doesn't make any well
[42:04.880 --> 42:08.920]  you know the LA system was the beta test Darryl Gates before he died gave
[42:08.920 --> 42:13.240]  interviews that the CIA and the 60s came in as a beta test put them in black
[42:13.240 --> 42:17.080]  uniforms militarized them make it sexy spree to core all the other cops will
[42:17.080 --> 42:21.120]  want to be federalized started the SWAT teams is an all teams all of it they
[42:21.120 --> 42:25.440]  started in LA then in New York and Dallas of all places than Houston taking
[42:25.440 --> 42:30.200]  special ops hit men and putting them into police departments so that when they
[42:30.200 --> 42:34.320]  need to kill a CIA guy like they did in a Houston a few years ago they pull him
[42:34.320 --> 42:39.680]  over the CIA section guy gets down what Carney was his name and they shoot him
[42:39.680 --> 42:44.040]  right in the head under the helicopter the guy's hands are at his side boom
[42:44.040 --> 42:49.040]  execution and then he tracked back that cop he was in black ops so every major
[42:49.040 --> 42:52.720]  department has these federal hit men on it now man this and they're not even
[42:52.720 --> 42:56.040]  feds they work for foreign banks I mean this country is just in so much trouble
[42:56.040 --> 42:59.160]  and what's amazing about it is like you said you can get a video of it you can
[42:59.160 --> 43:02.680]  get audio recordings of it you can look at where the engine is where the car is
[43:02.680 --> 43:06.760]  the condition of the car no witness is saying and blew up yeah and it's because
[43:06.760 --> 43:09.760]  I've seen cars crash outside my house running the tree people been hurt
[43:09.760 --> 43:14.960]  killed everybody's seen that you hear it's a big noise yes but it doesn't
[43:14.960 --> 43:20.360]  shake your house only the explosive wave by high explosive sends that that's
[43:20.360 --> 43:24.320]  right but even if it had been an explosion because of gas lines the engine
[43:24.320 --> 43:28.480]  was ejected down the road the engine is not a fine gasoline doesn't send those
[43:28.480 --> 43:32.200]  explosive waves though right you talk about a smoking gun I mean there's no
[43:32.200 --> 43:37.160]  smoking engine you know I mean that that car was just really engulfed in
[43:37.160 --> 43:41.480]  flames but the engine is down the road not touched so I mean that that and the
[43:41.480 --> 43:44.920]  witnesses you're saying it's driving down the road I saw one where there it's
[43:44.920 --> 43:47.960]  driving in bursts into flames yeah that's what the witness says he says I
[43:47.960 --> 43:51.840]  was just coming northbound on Highland and I saw a car going really fast all
[43:51.840 --> 43:56.080]  of a sudden I seen it jackknife I just seen parts fly everywhere and I slammed
[43:56.080 --> 44:00.440]  on my brakes and stopped and tried to call 9-11 as Louise Cortez that's the
[44:00.440 --> 44:03.920]  eyewitness report the only eyewitness report because this happened at 4 30 in
[44:03.920 --> 44:08.400]  the morning now statistically at being LA it was probably the police that loaded
[44:08.400 --> 44:12.440]  the bomb that's usually it's kind of like a turf deal and they get their
[44:12.440 --> 44:16.880]  payment and that's how it works well I tell you what I mean the LA police
[44:16.880 --> 44:20.880]  department especially after the door in case they just don't they don't have
[44:20.880 --> 44:24.760]  any credibility and they're the Gambino's yeah yeah absolutely I have had
[44:24.760 --> 44:31.320]  dinner with retired detectives and and and people that are basically with the
[44:31.320 --> 44:34.680]  Vikings you know they made movies about that it's a lot it's real and they're
[44:34.680 --> 44:38.000]  just like of course 9-11's an inside job of course they blew it up I mean they're
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.720]  like what do you do every everything's a mafia I mean I've been to a bunch of
[44:41.720 --> 44:45.400]  parties with them I know some are famous cops I mean it's like of course it's all
[44:45.400 --> 44:48.720]  a big joke I don't think this is cute I don't want my kids growing up in a
[44:48.720 --> 44:53.000]  country like this no no and it is really frightening that they can just do
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.400]  this out in the open and deny it and no matter how ridiculous it is another story
[44:57.400 --> 45:01.600]  that broke yesterday was the TWA flight 800 the new documentary coming out
[45:01.600 --> 45:05.840]  where they've got six investigators who were shut down by the FBI when this
[45:05.840 --> 45:09.280]  happens they arrested journalists we need to get them on who snuck in and got
[45:09.280 --> 45:13.200]  the samples in the hangar it was it was an explosive continuous rod warhead
[45:13.200 --> 45:17.080]  that's right and in that case you see the FBI is going out and interviewing
[45:17.080 --> 45:20.520]  people and just not putting down official transcript putting down a summary
[45:20.520 --> 45:23.880]  not showing the summary even to the witnesses to say did we get it right I
[45:23.880 --> 45:27.120]  mean they just went through a perfunctory there were 700 army and navy
[45:27.120 --> 45:31.000]  witnesses to the missile yeah they were having a drill then yeah exactly and you
[45:31.000 --> 45:34.800]  got you got air you got transcriptions of airline pilots of course you know the
[45:34.800 --> 45:37.760]  plane was loaded with Egyptian our military officers now I didn't know
[45:37.760 --> 45:43.600]  that yeah gonna show you this the rise of the killer drones how America goes to
[45:43.600 --> 45:47.840]  war and secret Michael Hastings an inside look at how killing our remote
[45:47.840 --> 45:51.200]  control has changed the way of flight and he's in the article there's a drone
[45:51.200 --> 45:56.320]  strike from above see the wheels are still intact she's your netted just
[45:56.320 --> 45:59.960]  pointed that out is it possible this guy could have been hit by a drone as sort
[45:59.960 --> 46:03.880]  of a you're right about drones now we're gonna hit you yeah my crystals out
[46:03.880 --> 46:09.400]  there yeah that drone strike does look like that but but generally I know it
[46:09.400 --> 46:14.400]  looks similar but that wouldn't that would hammer the engine down or or
[46:14.400 --> 46:18.840]  maybe out depends on where the missile hit right I mean it's much easier and
[46:18.840 --> 46:23.360]  and and easier to hide why would they go with something exotic or maybe they'll
[46:23.360 --> 46:27.280]  start having drones out in public and kill people I mean it's really a
[46:27.280 --> 46:33.280]  flaunting now of the psychopaths it could be but seeing other car bombs the
[46:33.280 --> 46:37.160]  professionals put plastic explosives and a lot of times with an accelerant and
[46:37.160 --> 46:41.000]  with something that's flammable to burn up the evidence it looks like a
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.720]  dashboard bomb to me right yeah because that was a very intense fire like that
[46:44.720 --> 46:48.240]  looks even more intense than that would have been I mean that that car was
[46:48.240 --> 46:53.320]  completely fragmentation yeah I mean that jeez you're netted brought that to
[46:53.320 --> 46:56.400]  my attention and I'm like we got to go you guys are talking about this right
[46:56.400 --> 47:00.640]  now and it's just so he's writing about drones yeah and I don't know that
[47:00.640 --> 47:03.880]  drone strut I mean that does yeah that's a drill yeah let me show people on
[47:03.880 --> 47:08.840]  document cam that are watching on TV go ahead and also I sent the guys a link
[47:08.840 --> 47:13.000]  my crystal was on that billboard a while back that we yeah that we took
[47:13.000 --> 47:18.440]  covered and it was when Colin Powell and a bunch of those guys came here to
[47:18.440 --> 47:24.120]  speak Rudy Giuliani was the other guy and somebody put put up their Pat
[47:24.120 --> 47:28.520]  Tillman and the numbers on it it was pretty crazy they put a star on the
[47:28.520 --> 47:31.520]  guys forehead and I don't know it was pretty and I just thought that was
[47:31.520 --> 47:34.280]  interesting some bad person climbed up on there and did that here in Austin I
[47:34.280 --> 47:39.120]  know I wonder who that was I can't believe it but I was disrespectful you
[47:39.120 --> 47:42.040]  know people already know the truth about this guy and people have known it for
[47:42.040 --> 47:45.640]  years you know and he's just he's still walking around Scott free at that point
[47:45.640 --> 47:49.400]  you know how dare someone climb up on the billboard and do that I hate when
[47:49.400 --> 47:53.160]  people do that you should we should just let these people kill everybody yeah
[47:53.160 --> 47:57.320]  exactly no we should all we should all be scared of them too you know that this
[47:57.320 --> 48:00.480]  Hastings things gonna get a lot deeper definitely well I don't even think they
[48:00.480 --> 48:04.400]  care now I mean maybe they didn't I'm surprised they didn't have a drone flyer over
[48:04.400 --> 48:07.120]  and broad daylight announced we're now going to blow it up kind of like
[48:07.120 --> 48:10.560]  Dorner we're gonna burn it down all right bring the fire burn it down yeah one
[48:10.560 --> 48:13.520]  the guy said it suddenly jackknife I mean that could be from a bomb or it could
[48:13.520 --> 48:16.920]  be from a drone strike you know how do these things happen actually when they
[48:16.920 --> 48:20.320]  hit one they do kind of fly up and do that wow it depends on how kind of
[48:20.320 --> 48:24.120]  missile they used I mean are they that was a bomb from underneath that had
[48:24.120 --> 48:28.800]  enough forcing it to sever the engine and send it down 150 feet down the road
[48:28.800 --> 48:32.080]  I mean it would it would go up looked up in the air yeah that sounds like that
[48:32.080 --> 48:37.640]  sounds like eight ten pounds of plastic yeah I don't know I don't know but it
[48:37.640 --> 48:42.400]  doesn't it's not a situation where it did not crash into the tree no hand him
[48:42.400 --> 48:45.960]  in there and then catch fire that is not what happens but that's what the LSA
[48:45.960 --> 48:50.600]  right here's the deal if my car blows up they killed me okay right all right
[48:50.600 --> 48:54.160]  good job dude all right we'll be covering this more well one other thing
[48:54.160 --> 48:58.560]  from a crystal is you may remember he was also a big proponent of the universal
[48:58.560 --> 49:02.400]  service you know so in spite of his criticisms of Obama that were reported
[49:02.400 --> 49:06.280]  by Michael Hastings that caused him to get fired he really loves Obama's
[49:06.280 --> 49:11.280]  programs right he loves national service and he hates citizens having weapons
[49:11.280 --> 49:14.320]  you know he made the rounds of all the talk show an anti-gunner he's a real
[49:14.320 --> 49:17.640]  authoritarian yeah and he was talking about better not talk too bad about him
[49:17.640 --> 49:21.360]  on the black Pat Tillman so why do you why do you want to have to have military
[49:21.360 --> 49:24.920]  weapons and what he would talk about would be the velocity of the bullet we
[49:24.920 --> 49:27.600]  wasn't talking about the fact that Homeland Security is getting hollow point
[49:27.600 --> 49:31.320]  bullets which are far more destructive to people you know but he was talking
[49:31.320 --> 49:34.120]  about oh these military bullets they travel this speed you don't need that
[49:34.120 --> 49:37.120]  and it's like the speed of the bullet doesn't have but these guys are such
[49:37.120 --> 49:43.560]  gangsters illegally spying on us and and Alexander the head of the NSA says
[49:43.560 --> 49:47.360]  hey I'm gonna meet with the FBI director and I'm a frickin beer I mean it's all
[49:47.360 --> 49:53.640]  just there's just such a bunch of goons yeah yeah but they will destroy this
[49:53.640 --> 49:58.080]  country if they're able to yeah it's just amazing to me as I said when I look
[49:58.080 --> 50:02.640]  at this how the media is just falling on lockstep with this official narrative
[50:02.640 --> 50:06.720]  and you can see the pictures even at the media puts there that contradict what
[50:06.720 --> 50:11.040]  they're saying and they still go well that's always the evidence is there
[50:11.040 --> 50:14.760]  immediately no foul play run into a tree yeah and then witnesses all say the
[50:14.760 --> 50:19.480]  opposite yeah yeah and again he tells WikiLeaks I mean followed by the FBI I
[50:19.480 --> 50:23.680]  gotta I gotta get this out quick I mean to be like the government's following me
[50:23.680 --> 50:27.360]  on my car blows up it's like oh nothing to see here go on to sleep and I mean
[50:27.360 --> 50:31.080]  will the media stand up you prostitutes of the globalist shelling out your
[50:31.080 --> 50:35.800]  families even as they kill you do you have any spines do you have anything I
[50:35.800 --> 50:39.400]  just don't get it and I guess the system doesn't even care if we're out here
[50:39.400 --> 50:42.080]  talking about this because they think the general public's cowards and we'll
[50:42.080 --> 50:47.080]  just roll over that much more to this gangster government that's right yeah if
[50:47.080 --> 50:50.360]  you look at him going at a high speed it could be that they made sure that you
[50:50.360 --> 50:53.200]  knew that they were following him you know they could have been chasing him
[50:53.200 --> 50:56.520]  then blown the car up who knows I mean we can speculate about that but what we
[50:56.520 --> 51:00.840]  know is it did not blow up and catch fire because hit the tree yeah we all
[51:00.840 --> 51:04.680]  know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in

[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.880]  half before his car blew up so unbelievable we're gonna be covering
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.400]  that recapping that coming up in the hour we just had David night in about 30
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.720]  minutes breaking down the different angles of that and then we've got a lot
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:36.880]  of other news the UN is calling for a global kill switch and Russia agrees
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.880]  with them that story is up in the middle column at drudgereport.com and also if
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.720]  you click on the top stories tab of info wars.com it's already rolled off the
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.720]  main page that's the only problem with info wars so many of our top stories
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.360]  we're not long like drudge we're more can be up there on the front page it
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.160]  rolls off and then it's all just so incredibly so it's also super creepy
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.960]  it's like man I better hurry up expose these people and somehow have a
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.240]  breakthrough and back things off before they come from me you know they've
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.600]  already come from a name telling wilder and wilder lies you said a level I've
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.000]  never seen before they're so angry we've got reporters that go and take up with
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.400]  their press conferences if they kill me for anything it'll be sending Dan
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:24.680]  Badandi they might whack him too is a message but probably not they probably
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:28.440]  come after me if they go out to anybody for going to take it over those press
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.920]  conferences there's a reason hundreds of reporters were at those and the FBI
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.640]  said you do not look at his photos and you do not listen to him they all said
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.040]  yes sir and then privately came over said we agree with you but we're all
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.040]  scared because they know I'll just take you around back and blow your head off I
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:49.520]  mean this this country is mafia run government runs al-qaeda and again you
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.800]  got FBI that investigate child kidnappings in bank robberies they're the
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.800]  light side of the FBI Joel Scalzen can break that down for you she's had family
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:02.720]  in the FBI and studied it and you've got the the real operators that sick there
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.200]  and basically let the regular FBI do their paperwork for him that's the same
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.920]  thing at the ATF same thing at the CIA same thing at the NSA you have the
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.640]  compartmentalized criminal group that now has gotten to be about half or more
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.800]  Scalzen estimates the last few years it's past the 50-50 mark I mean they've
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.160]  killed hundreds of army investigators and dozens of marine investigators who
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:28.320]  would go expose you know stealing and thieving going on and they'll just shoot
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.400]  them three times in the chest and then have the army coroner say oh they shot
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.920]  himself three times in the chest and if a general tries to stand up they just
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:44.400]  killed him congressman stands up like high tower did that time and blow up his
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:50.040]  airplane I met his son at Charlie Sheen's house that was pretty interesting
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.400]  he said he'd come on the show then I think I brought his card back we ever
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:59.280]  call him oh I just can't handle it anymore it's just so insane why why do we
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.920]  let the worst people run everything don't people get it's not sexy and cool
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:09.440]  like the movie say and that corruption grows corruptions like
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.240]  locking up 20 dogs in your house with all the food they can eat for a month
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:17.160]  and coming back what do you think it looks like they'll be knee-deep and you
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:24.840]  know what and they try to dress it up gangsterism and all this is cool it just
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.840]  makes me want to throw up it makes me want to throw up as the system shakes
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:34.560]  down farmers and hard-working people and takes poor people's paycheck to give it
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:38.280]  to foreign banks and that's media propaganda tell them in social envy
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:44.440]  class envy oh we're taxing to get the rich people it's so sick as they work
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:48.400]  overtime the globalist think of us as scum because we put up with all this
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:54.800]  maybe we are maybe humanity deserves be ruled by a bunch of murderers because
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:05:01.400]  we don't put up with it that that's the attitude of the globalist now is the

[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:16.760]  Jones and the GCN radio network ladies and gentlemen I want to give out the
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:23.120]  phone number and get your take on the amnesty plan they're preparing evidence
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.760]  indicating Michael Hastings of Rolling Stone that had a big story coming out
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:32.280]  that was posing on a shake the CIA so his car blew up driving down the street
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:35.600]  witnesses said it was an explosion the engine went over 50 yards down the
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:41.520]  street with no fire looks like classic car bomb in the dashboard or under the
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.320]  car bare minimum type explosion he said the FBI's after me the FBI's following
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:53.280]  me an hour and a half before in a tweet and two WikiLeaks so I mean you're being
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.800]  followed the feds are after your car blows up and you've got all these other
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:02.360]  people like the Zarnab brother friend who was speaking out and the FBI comes
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:06.120]  to his house shoots him in the top of the head he's unarmed Pat Tillman the
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.360]  list goes on and on Aaron Schwartz said I'm gonna beat this these fake
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:16.200]  Justice Department charges I'm getting married they come to his house and
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:23.960]  hanging and then say we drove him to suicide the DC madam said on this show
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.320]  a month before they hung her in her mother's shed I will never commit
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.600]  suicide I will never commit suicide and then some guy that was proven she
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.760]  didn't even know on the other side of the country comes out and says she told me
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.480]  she was with no proof so if they killed me like that they'll have someone pop up
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:46.120]  and say Alex said he was gonna do it whoever says that is a liar is a liar
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.720]  they could have a gun to my head saying they'd come after my children if I
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:54.040]  didn't write a suicide note I'm not writing nothing you understand and I'm
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:59.360]  never committing suicide I want that on record and again they also haven't killed
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.400]  me yet because they know my media organization is going to come after this

[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:13.640]  News local in LA talking about Michael Hastings and talking to witnesses about
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:19.640]  what they saw and what they heard here it is Rolling Stone magazine called Michael
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:24.280]  Hastings a fearless journalist who refused to cozy up to power his death at
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.160]  33 came by way of a fire-fueled and explosive crash it sounded like a bomb
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:34.240]  went off in the middle of the night my house shook the windows were rattling
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.480]  couldn't have written a scene like this for a movie where the engine flies from
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:43.720]  the car which was about I don't know 50 60 yards up right down here to this
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:49.440]  telephone pole. Ladies and gentlemen he could be going 150 miles an hour I've
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.480]  seen a lot of wrecks especially in a Mercedes weather bill you're not gonna
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:13:00.640]  have the engine fly down the road and they could blow up anybody and people
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.400]  are just told oh it just ran into a tree and you look it's been blown off the
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:10.040]  road and it's up against a tree not not sandwiched up against it not not an
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:21.040]  indent from it it's just setting up against a tree unbelievable unbelievable
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:27.320]  I'd say 95 98% chance they killed this guy and he says I'm being followed by the
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.280]  FBI I've got a big thing coming out that could blow the CIA wide open and they
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.600]  said really think so bud I got something that's gonna blow you wide open and he
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:40.920]  founded the CIA OSS British intelligence and skull and bones at Yale
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:47.120]  which was set up by the British East India Company in 1832 under the Russell
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:54.000]  Trusts who had the world monopoly on opium into the West and who then lobbied
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.120]  to get may opium made illegal so they could shut down all their competition
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:04.560]  in the 1930s the CIA has always been there to bring the drugs in the CIA has
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:08.480]  always been there for the robber barons people started fighting the robber
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:13.360]  barons in the 1850 60 70s 80s 90s right through the 20s the robber barons was a
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.240]  show up of the railroad train full of Pinkerton security and others and they
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:23.600]  it's just like in what movie is that with Clint Eastwood toll-free number to
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:30.680]  join us folks 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 will we'll start going to your phone
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:36.720]  calls here in a moment my point is is that it's on high planes drifter but it's
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:41.280]  kind of a remake of it where Eastwood goes to the mining town and they want
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.520]  the people to give up their claim where they found gold the railroad does with
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:49.480]  the big minor company and they send in the detectives to start killing people
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.560]  folks those are true stories there were hundreds of events like that in
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:59.200]  Colorado you name it but also in New Jersey in places where they would show
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.280]  up with the army or they would show up with hundreds of Pinkerton or other
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:10.000]  security guys and just start gatling gunning towns just taking property
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.200]  that wasn't even theirs and people started arming they called him sage
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:18.040]  brass rebellion sort of killing them people started beating the army beating
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:21.320]  Pinkerton it will start organizing going you want to start killing let's start
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:26.160]  killing and people would also find out who the Pinkerton people's family were
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:30.160]  and other groups and they'd go to another state and kill them not their
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.640]  family but the people that ran it frontier people started you know going
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:38.960]  you want to hit us we'll get you right back so it all went underground in
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:44.960]  national security and then we say America doesn't kill people second the
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:54.840]  godfather where K says to Michael Corleone Corleone says to him you know
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:16:00.520]  okay my dad has people killed sometimes you know that's what presidents and
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.800]  senators do and she was Michael presidents and senators don't have people
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:12.360]  killed he goes who's being naive now okay and see the argument is and it's
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.160]  really true because the godfather is based on real mafia families real names
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:19.720]  they just changed them that's on record Mario Puzza it's it's got all the main
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:31.600]  characters and who are who are real people and when you expand on all of
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:38.440]  this the argument is is well the old mafia just stood up when the police were
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:43.920]  their own mafia they would stand up for you but then notice how that mafia
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:48.040]  turned into something just as bad or worse and that's how this gang society
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:59.200]  operates and pretty soon that's all you've got left pretty soon all you've
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:05.560]  got left is gangs and then what gang are you in and then gangs tend to stop
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:11.560]  working and everybody joins a gang and then society collapses or they go out
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.240]  and grab the peasants and put them in slave camps to produce for them but then
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:19.840]  slave camps aren't very productive so it gets to the point where even the heads
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:25.920]  of the countries can't even get good food or good clothing like North Korea and
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:29.640]  and they will wreck everything if they have their way they will wreck
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:33.680]  everything because why shouldn't big corporations that they have a mafia
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:38.720]  government why shouldn't general electric give every year on average over
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.600]  a hundred million dollars to the Democratic Party they also give the
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.360]  Republican to have them come in and shut down every power plant they don't
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:51.440]  own and then double and triple your prices why shouldn't they why shouldn't
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.960]  we have rolling blackouts now all over the country we don't have enough
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.360]  infrastructure why shouldn't they shut down our factories and and pay 20 plus
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.960]  billion dollars of taxpayer money to move General Motors Volt Cadillac you
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:09.320]  name it to China so they can have robots replace the people and have the
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:13.640]  people go die in the streets starving to death not even helping with Chinese I
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:20.040]  mean why not we'll put up with it why not because they have disdain for us you
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:25.320]  look at Rahm Emanuel who was the real president till he got it got kicked out
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.920]  by some other insiders because he was so arrogant and so mentally ill
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.560]  reportedly and sent to be the mob boss in Chicago where I'm sure he can listen
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:35.920]  on 1530 he routinely Democratic Party events grabs butcher knives and starts
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:40.360]  going stabbing the table and foaming at the mouth like murder everyone murder
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:45.160]  murder the Republicans murder murder and he'll be in meetings low bomb and just
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:53.360]  go shut up and literally you just slap Obama on the arm to start stumbling
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:19:00.080]  around a power trip I mean I mean this is what runs America and then he gets up
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:03.040]  on TV and goes we're gonna have nationals conscription your kids are
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.520]  gonna serve in a domestic armed force in America working for us I mean just

[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.840]  to then illustrate that you know he has x-ray vision he's looking through the
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.080]  looking through the building there at the lady in the shower it's it's not a
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:19.120]  risque photo it just illustrates that actually with connect systems and
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:22.840]  smart meters a connect can look through your walls and see you in the shower
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.960]  you should probably add that to the right up there but Don Salazar heard me
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:30.160]  talk about this yesterday and put it out in our great graphics crew came up with
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:34.200]  that graphic they did some others I guess they put on the cutting room floor
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.480]  but they ought to add those to it I'm gonna send that out on Twitter at real
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:43.240]  Alex Jones as well right now but right now speaking of right now let's go to
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:50.240]  truth raider in Oregon you're on the air good afternoon Alex Jones and all the
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.200]  info wars up on the world this is the truth raider get it in your face with
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.920]  the facts you're talking about amnesty and talking about the boards being wide
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:03.080]  open I have an issue with the next door neighbor I completely don't want to you
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.280]  know have any contact with them I leave them alone I go out my back door to
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:11.440]  avoid avoid them completely I went out last night to go up to the store get
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.760]  something to eat guys on the other side of the street heckling me and he's
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:19.840]  whistling at me so I ignore him I come back go around the other side of the
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.920]  other building on the other side of the street he's on the other side of the
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.600]  street ready to confront me they say hey what's up what's up I you know I don't
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:32.920]  want to talk to you oh and then he starts he starts cussing at me well
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:37.080]  that's what you're doing to me and doing to all of us I told my paid four
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:41.080]  thousand dollars and moved a thousand miles to get away from you I went to one
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.720]  of my Alex Jones rants with him oh I'll call the police I call the police
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:50.120]  well you're talking about it any legal alien that you think doesn't like you
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:56.320]  because you're a different skin color well I think that he knows that I'm
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.240]  trying to avoid them when I first moved into my apartment here I try to be
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:05.480]  friendly I said hello how are you and he and he just gave me a dirty look well
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:09.680]  I mean I haven't had problems with with the illegals whether they be from
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:13.400]  Mexico or Eastern Europe or whatever my issue is is that they tend to vote
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:18.640]  anti-gun pro government pro corrupt government pro mafia because that's the
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:21.960]  cultures they're coming from most countries are mafia driven America's
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:25.600]  been mafia driven gang driven we're trying to get away from that and not
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.960]  supercharge it but I you know I think that I haven't had the experiences you're
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:35.360]  talking about my experiences with the illegals that make me mad is they're
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:38.560]  like above the law we have you know crew that live in apartments some of them and
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:41.400]  the illegals are allowed to do whatever they want but citizens whether you be
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:46.120]  white black Hispanic whatever get the book thrown at you so I think being in
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:51.320]  the system we're seen as chumps by the mafia government the mafia police and my
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:56.600]  issue is but some of you're saying you've had experiences xenophobic
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:00.920]  experiences towards you because you're you're not the same as an immigrant group
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.200]  or what I'm an American I've been in the military and former retired military
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:08.960]  you know I fought for the sovereignty and the freedom of this country and it's
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:12.280]  being eviscerated the the Constitution and all the due process is being
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:16.760]  eviscerated I'm not happy about that I left California to get away from what's
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:21.520]  all that's going on down there I mean you know all the host of all the issues
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:25.680]  concerning illegal aliens the gangsters the gang cultures all the crime along
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:31.960]  the border all that stuff trouble with a relative of mine and elderly my step
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.760]  mother who had lots of troubles with him for years that they did damage to her
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:39.600]  property broken to her place for years now there's no doubt that there's a
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.240]  crime wave coming out of Mexico and you know you're supposed to be politically
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:50.560]  correct now talk about it I mean Mexico is a collapsed failed state and obviously
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:53.760]  then people think they're not liked and then you think you're not like in the
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:59.120]  body language intensifies that and I have run into the whole gang culture and
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.120]  and again you find the gang culture everywhere you know I've got family in
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:05.480]  East Texas and I've worked there and been there in the summer and you know
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:08.880]  people come over at the community pool and say get out of here you Yankee
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:13.560]  because anybody from Dallas must be a Yankee but I hear you and it's just
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:17.440]  exactly the gang mentality I'm talking about and the gang mentality has a way
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:21.960]  of putting you into it even if you don't want to be what they call racist
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:26.400]  it's really gang or tribal and if you look at Latin America Africa Europe
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.000]  whatever you'd have one group of Scots killing the other group of Scots until
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.680]  the English invaders and then they'd unify and in Africa you'll have animus
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:38.200]  killing Christians or Muslims killing Christians or vice versa and it's just
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:42.480]  what humans do and the globalist manipulate and play that I'd rather
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:46.640]  have a gang that's into science and liberty and freedom and justice and
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:54.120]  unify around those ideals we're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex

[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:44.720]  the question is is the establishment flaunting it on purpose that the
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:48.240]  private federal reserves collection agency the irs is targeting liberty
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:52.040]  lovers are they throwing it in our face that they're assassinating american

[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:04.240]  is told to sit down and shut up and not ask who's getting it I think the
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:08.400]  answer is yes the globalists just can't help but steal everything nobody's
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:13.680]  stopping them and so they have a method of the madness of just tempest break our
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:18.840]  will teach us to accept it as we convert to a society of just groveling
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:24.240]  idiots who worship nothing but hype and foolishness and any reporters that
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:28.640]  expose them or you actually show the criminality they're engaged in you just
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:38.400]  kill them and that's the future we leave our children not a very good society not

[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.920]  today we kind of got back with him late just because they're in a country where

[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:15.360]  is going to be a serious candidate if he decides to run and I was wondering I
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.840]  had heard you mentioned something about the about the electronic voting and
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:29.320]  maybe you know have their hands in that possibly and if it came down to the wire
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:34.880]  and Rand Paul hypothetically if Rand Paul was in the running for the
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:44.320]  presidency and and it was close and do you think that that that they could play
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.600]  around with the with the electronic voting and if he did make it in what do
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:51.440]  you think that it's possible that someone would try to take him out because
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:55.760]  he doesn't have a globalist agenda well just to be clear and I appreciate your
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:04.360]  call it's a great question just to be clear we get 60% turnouts are close to
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:09.200]  it like 57% the average I think last four elections I saw that a few months
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:14.360]  back in the newspaper but it's around 60% turnout in national presidential
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:20.520]  elections and about 45 50% off your elections and then on average you get
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:25.160]  about 8% turnout locally in the country Travis County happens to be right at the
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:29.880]  national average like 8.4% last time I saw the numbers where I live and in
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:33.760]  places like Travis County I've been to the election board at the state they've
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.560]  certified election fraud but they still rubber stamp it there is no voting in
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:44.000]  Austin and that's why it's so fraudulent and socialist and communist and
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.240]  globalist and insiders robbing everybody and taking people's private
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:53.360]  property and out of control zoning boards and and just hell on earth because
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:57.400]  they have been proven over and over again to steal elections they've had
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:00.680]  county commissioner elections where somebody's 20-something points ahead and
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:04.240]  then the county commissioner who's friends with the county clerk this is in
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:08.360]  the paper throws fits and collapses and then the county clerk says it's okay
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:13.200]  huh and I'll make it better and then the suddenly they win I mean it's just they
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:17.920]  don't even hide it it's it's kind of like you know the CIA publicly brings in
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:21.320]  the drugs or they publicly killed Pat Tillman and it comes out and they don't
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:27.400]  get in trouble I mean it is just lawless evil 35 40% of the country's got
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.680]  certified fraud systems in and if you're voting the way they want they'll they'll
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:35.800]  let you actually have it they've been caught all over the country diable all
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:40.040]  of them they have pre-programmed algorithms they have live feeds in the
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:44.440]  programs to go in change the votes and then have it covered up for them and
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:48.840]  that's on record that's been testified in Florida legislature Ohio Texas it's
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:53.560]  well-known just like it's well-known the NSA spies on you without warrants just
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:56.040]  like it's well-known they put cancer viruses and all the major vaccines like
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:59.560]  it's well-known sodium fluoride lowers your IQ around 20 points give you seven
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:02.880]  fold increase in bone cancer I keep going for a couple hours it's just all
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.680]  well-known to well-known people to know how to tie the shoelaces and so if from
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:11.880]  the experts we've talked to like Bev Harris and many others I knew the
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:14.800]  Collier brothers before they died and their daughter and all of them who
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:23.080]  first really exposed it 30 40 years ago they have trouble fixing big massive
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:28.600]  landslides but they could still do that so that's why they're so airing that's
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:35.640]  why they passed the NDA and say we'll kill you if we want that's why they run
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:41.040]  the narcotics why they take over a million kids every year why state and
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:44.200]  federal courts are ruling they can take your kids for no reason that was in the
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:47.840]  news yesterday this is how tyranny works they've got a group an army of
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:50.960]  criminals an army of scum an army of control freaks who will do whatever
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:54.160]  they're told or they'll be replaced and they're marching against us and they're
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:57.640]  stealing and robbing and destroying everything and they will accelerate it
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:01.680]  until everything is destroyed and sewage is running down the streets and you are
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:05.160]  completely poor they will destroy health care they will destroy our borders they
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:08.640]  will rob everything it's what they do unless we stand up to them and just
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:13.640]  basically we've eaten poison we're gonna get very sick if we don't vomit the
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:18.280]  poison out and we may not make it even if we were to vomit it all out now so
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:22.280]  much of it's in the bloodstream and and this is how society dies and people
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:26.280]  want to die and you know and in a way we've killed 53 million babies in
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:31.120]  America and say they're not humans well you're not human either and you let them
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:33.560]  go kill Iraqis and take everything they've got so the bankers will take
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:38.480]  everything you got that's how it works it's a spiritual law of the universe it's
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:45.600]  a law of quantum mechanics it's a law of physics that what comes around goes
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:50.600]  around that's why you have empathy I don't need to cold-bloodily say I'm
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.280]  against killing Iraqis you know over a million of them just so globalists make
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:58.320]  money because it'll come back on me I have empathy I'm hard-wired to not like
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:06.840]  it in my gut in my spirit but that hard-wiring is also there as a survival
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:13.960]  mechanism and people think not caring is tough they're gonna find out no one is
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:19.240]  immune no one is immune everyone will drink from this cup and there's not
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:23.400]  gonna be a big fake rapture the Bible doesn't say that upfront to get us out
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:30.040]  all this we're gonna go through it so I hope everybody gets that through their
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:35.440]  heads okay you want excitement folks you're gonna get it but people are so
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:39.320]  brainwashed they won't even know people think they're bored you're bored you're
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:43.040]  living in the middle of a science fiction movie they're blowing up Rolling
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:48.520]  Stones reporters on the streets of LA in car bombs they burned down police
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:52.640]  officers in cabins who knows if Dorner even did what they said and then say we
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:59.080]  burned him up but we didn't burn him up they just do whatever they want
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:06.920]  let's go to I don't know about Rand Paul Rand Paul's good because he puts out
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:11.120]  liberty-based ideas and criticizes tyranny Scott and Vermont you're on the
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:15.960]  year yeah hi Alex yeah you won't you won't see I don't think you see Matt
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:20.280]  Ty Evey of Rolling Stone talking about conspiracies regarding Hastings but
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.840]  anyways I want to bring up because everybody knows the US government
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:28.560]  doesn't kill anybody I won't bring up general Ben Parton he was so great on
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:33.040]  the Oklahoma bombing years ago exposing the truth about that he was a bomb
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:39.320]  expert and at flight 800 and but the thing is and he's on the film a noble
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:43.720]  lie which is great I don't know if you've had him on your show but and you've
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:47.360]  probably been asked this before but I've had part on many times get Ben
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:49.680]  Parton on if you guys don't have his number in the computer he's been on
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:53.720]  20 times over the years had been on about five years former head of Air Force
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:59.360]  weapons development former head of harp I want him on and you can call the noble
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:02.920]  lie guys to get his number if you don't have it yeah I'm going the very missile
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:05.960]  that he said the continuous rod warhead missile that he says took down flight
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:10.200]  800 no I know I mean they they have to and reporters hurting they they get they
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:14.600]  broke in got the samples it was US government explosive using that missile
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:18.480]  so they arrested them and and where was the media when that happened no they
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:21.120]  blew that up because it was full of Egyptian military officers
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:26.480]  why has he never talked about 9-11 you know I talked to him after 9-11 he just
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:33.480]  said I'm not going there well maybe some time before you maybe you know worried
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.840]  about about I wish you would but you know the media said yesterday that
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:40.280]  conspiracy and they brought out this new story about these researchers on the
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:44.040]  original investigators now coming out now that they're retired I got their
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.640]  pensions coming out and saying that there's a cover-up they said you know
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:52.400]  conspiracy theories have long thought there was a sinister plot there no we
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:55.920]  were talking about they were they were talking about an accident and the Navy
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:59.400]  and it's come out for the people that were on the inside told their family I
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:03.160]  know somebody who knows it wasn't an accident they they routed the aircraft
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:07.520]  over the drill to get rid of the Egyptians they blew it up and had a bunch
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:12.840]  of the military officers on it as well and they blow up aircraft full of
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:18.120]  military all the time and I don't know why these governments fly a bunch of top
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:21.480]  generals together on the same aircraft
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:25.040]  in Pennsylvania that we're learning French and going over to France there
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:30.960]  may die too well that's too bad Alex but we got it we got to expose that and
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.000]  everything else too and and don't worry about them calling us conspiracy
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.240]  theorists or whatever because they say a lot of it's true notice this is all
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:42.600]  coming out now though all these scandals that were already there yeah it's not
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:47.040]  that Snowden isn't a hero and I think he's a real person it's that they knew
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:53.640]  months before and Washington Post and Guardian were sitting on it and then
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.440]  they got the green light to go with it because Benghazi will bring them down
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:03.000]  they had two drones and other aircraft with high-deaf video of the six plus
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.240]  hour stand down and they they had those people murdered using the al-Qaeda
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:13.560]  security force over Benghazi and this wakes up the mafia who themselves are I
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:19.360]  mean these guys shut around I have I have shot around with old army black ops
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:25.200]  operators and people and they're all the same they've got they've got literal
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:37.560]  paintings of you know Western characters on the wall they read Louie Lamour books
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:44.680]  John Wayne's on the wall and they just absolutely think we're America we're the
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:48.520]  tough guys we kill everybody and we use evil tactics because we're protecting
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:55.360]  the good and this whole thing of publicly running al-Qaeda is really
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:00.040]  freaked the military out I mean like it's like half the military 40 to 50% now
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:03.960]  of the of the non-commissioned officers and below are my listeners that freaks
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:06.920]  out the system to the point of they're saying the military is the enemy and
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:10.240]  you've got all these guys that have done all this bad stuff but they believe in
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:14.040]  justifies the means they're now all getting it something like Benghazi could
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:20.240]  bring them down because their own hitmen believe me folks the army doesn't just go
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:24.320]  fight battles they go around killing people 24-7 all over the world and it's
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:28.160]  mainly the army that's why whenever Pachina comes in goes the seals like
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:32.880]  to bring about what they do that's kind of a public unit for PR for the Navy the
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.000]  army doesn't talk about what they do and the army doesn't like to being talked
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.400]  about either Alex because it is the army is just from my research is just
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:47.920]  giant giant I mean just huge secret armies of hitmen and and saboteurs and
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:53.400]  just everything else is just mind-blowing and the army's like you sat there and
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.080]  killed all these people and they all know and hundreds of people were in
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.240]  situation rooms watching this show Benghazi's what they're really afraid of
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:06.960]  ladies and gentlemen Benghazi is what they're afraid of because you've got
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:11.040]  all these guys that think they've done all this stuff for John Wayne and for
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:14.880]  to fight the commies and all this stuff and now they see the country being
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:18.240]  destroyed everything being devalued they're being told they're the new
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:22.240]  enemy yeah because they're done with you guys now they're done they're gonna
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:26.400]  bring in the drones the robots they're gonna bring in inner pole they're gonna
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:30.840]  bring in foreign hit teams now they're done with you not of the long knives and
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:34.080]  if you guys don't know what that is you better look it up they're done with you
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:38.760]  you you're the essay that helped bring Hitler to power and now you're gonna get

[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:32.280]  uncovering surveillance state the journalist Michael Hastings who died
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:36.040]  and what authorities have described as a high-speed car crash was an active
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:40.440]  member of Project PM a crowdsourcing research effort to suppose government
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:45.440]  intelligence creators yeah the big anonymous group has come out and said
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:49.320]  that they're going to investigate him being murdered so anonymous knows what's
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:55.560]  going on and we've got that article up on info wars.com the login screen for
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:59.200]  trap wire software used for intelligence gathered on US and global
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:05.560]  citizens and made public and WikiLeaks data stamp data dump and they've gone
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:09.000]  public with the fact that he was working on trap wire with him and he did have the
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:14.280]  FBI quote following him when his car blew up just how much more obvious does this
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:18.360]  get and we told you they killed Pat Tillman and it came out that old
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:22.920]  McCrystal was over that cover-up and I'm sure over more than that and it did
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:30.040]  turn out he was murdered and who did Michael Hastings burn McCrystal the
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:40.240]  head of Army special operations that that's as gangster as it gets by the way
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:43.240]  we have another former head of special operations who said he wanted to come on
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:46.480]  the show and I just got so busy I never even called him up that's how pathetic I
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:53.400]  am and a lot of security concerns though that the person has to go through
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:57:00.480]  every day I mean these guys are living in presence basically what a what a
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:05.080]  horrible world I mean the most insecure thing you could ever be part of as a
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:11.040]  tyranny we've taken a free open society that wasn't perfect but that was not one
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:19.120]  tenth as corrupt and we have just absolutely burn up our Republic we have
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:23.640]  pitted it out we have erected and what is the establishment doing they're
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:29.520]  accelerating down the black hole I studied history folks I mean the road
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:35.520]  we're going down is horrible horrible it will destroy productivity it will
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:43.200]  destroy our society and it's going the way it always does it's accelerating now
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:47.400]  like you've seen the corruption last 50 years intensify it's going to get more
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:51.080]  corrupt in the next five and has the last 50 then it'll get corrupt in the
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:55.320]  next year after that then in the previous five it's like a singularity of
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:58:01.400]  evil a singularity of just orgies of corruption as psychopaths try to get
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:05.640]  caught and just act out and dominate more and more this is the criminology
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:09.400]  this is the psychology of them they will destroy themselves because even though
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:13.520]  they're evil and corrupt their subconscious mind and their human
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:19.240]  hard-wiring wants them to be destroyed and they're going to destroy themselves

[01:59:53.000 --> 02:00:00.800]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:16.600]  it began with the forging of the great rings three were given to the elves
[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:25.200]  immortal wisest and fairest of all beings seven to the dwarf lords great
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:32.920]  miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls and nine nine rings were gifted to
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:40.760]  the race of men who above all else desire power for within these rings was
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:47.400]  bound the strength and will to govern each race but they were all of them
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:55.360]  deceived for another ring was made in the land of Mordor in the fires of
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:01:02.120]  mount doom the dark lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring to control all
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:08.680]  others and into this ring he poured his cruelty his malice and his will to
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:12.080]  dominate all life
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:30.960]  one ring to rule them all the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:37.520]  your mind we've got a guest coming up in studio on the second amendment I want
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:41.200]  to continue with your calls we have another surprise guest that wanted to
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:45.240]  come on at one today but I don't know if we got in contact with them sooner
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:47.800]  enough to make sure it happens now it may happen overdrive or it'll happen
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:51.880]  tomorrow but I'm excited about that as well so who knows what's coming up in
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:56.200]  the shower mouse link in New York you want to talk about Ray Kurzweil welcome
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:01.120]  to the airwaves hi Alex how are you today I'm alright brother hey you know
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:05.560]  I listen to you a lot and I think that there's a lot of different ways that you
[02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:10.080]  could be described as a libertarian as a constitutionalist a lot of different
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:15.400]  ways that you analyze reality but the way that I've never heard you described
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:18.600]  in the way that I'm really starting to come to think of you is as a futurist
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:25.480]  maybe the dark futurist but if you're following futurism news and people like
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:29.120]  Kurzweil I've seen Kurzweil speak I attended the singularity summit down
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:35.480]  New York City and I read his book fantasy voyage there's this
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:42.720]  futurism is very much kind of rosy you know it's kind of saccharine rainbows
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:46.520]  and when people get together and they talk about futurism I don't feel like
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:53.640]  there's a lot of realistic discussion no they sell a dystopic transhumanist
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:57.800]  system that's really eugenics that's a prison they're on record in their more
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:02.120]  internal documents as a wonderful new thing and they're going to be gods and
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:05.840]  if you don't get with the program you'll be left behind and he's kind of the
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:11.520]  high priest of this new religion that they're selling to make it trendy I'm
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:16.520]  not even so much a futurist as I'm chronicling what the globalist social
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:21.040]  engineers are trying to build you understand I'm warning people I sound
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:24.320]  like a futurist because what I talked about 18 years ago a lot of us come
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:28.960]  through because they're building it their blueprints are public they change
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:33.240]  things a little bit as they try to accentuate it over time and they tweak
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:38.680]  things but I'm here watching an admitted program that they're trying to build
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:46.000]  and it's basically an Elysium type world and and so and there's a lot of
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:51.160]  people in the system warning the public I've talked to some of these directors
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:53.760]  you know off record some of these big films and they're you know say hey look
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:58.200]  we're awake we're trying to warm people this is not propaganda and then I see it
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:03.320]  come out and some of these films and it's not these people are awake but but
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:10.600]  they're only allowed to do it in a fiction form which then the the higher
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:14.520]  level social engineers believe is just preparing everyone's mind but yes I
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:19.480]  think that people say oh Jones has a dystopic futurist view they're they're
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:24.560]  building this I don't want to have them set my destiny in your destiny we
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:30.880]  should have a debate about what we want our destiny to be mouse link well I
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:35.640]  totally agree with you and I don't I think that the fact that you hammer this
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:41.160]  idea of normalcy bias a lot I find that to be really useful when I'm talking to
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:47.000]  people about futurism stuff we the world is changing it's changing so rapidly but
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:54.440]  we all keep acting like it isn't you want to say more are you done I got
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:57.560]  one of the question stay there we're gonna come back to you then more people
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:03.360]  we'll see if our surprise guest calls us Oklahoma reminds us there are many
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:07.880]  kinds of storms in our lives nature regularly sends us destructive storms
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:12.920]  24 hours before a storm strikes people panic it would be wise to prepare a head
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:17.840]  of the panic curve the food price storm from drought and livestock problems is
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:21.800]  forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer wonder if there'll

[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:46.820]  foreign banks eighty five billion of our taxpayer money a month and just in
[02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:51.480]  are involved in every form of crime we're desperately trying to get humanity
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:56.360]  off its knees and to stop worshiping illegitimate authority the authority in
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:59.840]  this country is the Bill of Rights the Constitution the Declaration of
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:03.920]  Independence that's what made this country great what made all the other
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:08.000]  countries a bunch of knuckle dragon third-world cess pits is the people were
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:16.000]  slaves and never had any freedom now we have a big guest that again just fell
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:23.640]  in our lap who's in another country shooting a big movie and the shooting
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:26.640]  went a little bit over so they're gonna be calling in the next ten minutes is
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:29.960]  what I've been told we'll see if that happens and I had another guest who was
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:32.760]  already scheduled in studio will do an hour overdrive with them because it's so
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:37.240]  important Annie's on the nightly news with jacari Jackson we just had a caller
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:41.240]  if you just tuned in a mouse link who's been to the Ray Kurzweil events we
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:44.280]  asked thousands of people futurists they're pushing this rosy view of
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:48.800]  transhumanism and I'm not saying machines couldn't augment humanity and
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:53.200]  actually impoverished you know for the blind to see to live longer whatever I
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:58.360]  like technology the problem is is that the ghost in the machine that the
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:02.800]  globalist are programming in anything we're given is not to augment but to
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:08.680]  enslave and to shudder reality Google Glass is all of it that is the direction
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:22.240]  that this whole system is going so at a fundamental level we need to have a
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:25.240]  discussion about this you see the new Matt Damon movie by the great director
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:30.640]  who grew up the middle of tyranny in South Africa of district 8 is got a Matt
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:34.280]  Damon movie coming out and I don't like Matt Damon's anti-liberty politics but
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:39.440]  I like him as an actor so it's a paradox and we you know we now know the
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:44.440]  script it's it's he's a slave worker basically building robots that are used
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:49.400]  by the globalist that live in compact cities and space stations who basically
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:55.520]  have eternal life and everybody else is dying of toxic waste and cancer and when
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:59.720]  he gets radiated in an accident in the factory they just tell him okay here's
[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:04.480]  your pills your pain pills go home and die and that's actually what they do with
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:07.760]  the troops that's what they do with the with people that are exposed to this
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:11.360]  stuff this is how we're seeing it's not going to be in the year 1,000 you know
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:17.160]  2,154 that all of this is going to happen this is going to happen in the
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:25.000]  next 25 30 40 years everywhere in China the three major companies Foxcom and two
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:31.360]  others are now putting in orders with robot factories in China and North
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:36.880]  America to build 15 million the first 5 million just got delivered last month
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:42.840]  look it up 15 million robots are being delivered that are worked on by robots
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:48.880]  that are built by robots and the goal is get us out of the equation why are we
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:53.880]  allowing the engineering of a future where we're not needed and it's not that
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:58.880]  things come out so the horse is obsolete because the automobile this is where
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:03.800]  things are being designed to where humans will fight for less and less
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:10.080]  resources and then the economy will be slowly imploded and then they'll use the
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:15.760]  fact that we're poor to social engineer us to get us in line socially for mass
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:23.120]  extermination via bio weapons so one of the future it's it's 12 monkeys meets
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:33.160]  Elysium meets the running man meets Brave New World meets 1984 and you ask
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:37.240]  why is all the stuff written in the 30s like Brave New World why is that what
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:41.920]  they've now built because the writer of that was part of a government genetic
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:50.240]  engineering program that failed from 1860 until then most the children died
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:54.320]  or were totally insane a few had super high accused like Aldous Huxley and his
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:58.480]  brother Julian Huxley went on to run the UN and he gave speeches saying this is
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:06.080]  the real plan you go read 1984 that's what it as a British MI6 agent and
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:11.320]  before that OSS that's what George Arwell was told was gonna be built and
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:18.320]  he gave speeches and on his deathbed confessed to all this and you better
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:23.080]  find out folks that all the stuff I talk about isn't coming true because I am
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:29.600]  psychic even though we've all got a little of the touch it's that this
[02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:36.680]  information is all admitted the decision has been made to build this utopia for
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:41.400]  the establishment that is a dystopia for us and we need to get involved and get
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:46.840]  informed and change society for the better of everybody and I have no doubt
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:50.720]  they didn't assassinate this Rolling Stone reporter who we now learn was
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:55.920]  about to break how bad the NSA spying was Michael Hastings car blew up in front
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:14:01.560]  of everybody in Los Angeles it did not run into a tree and with that
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:07.080]  incredibly heavy issue we are joined by someone who's actually on set and we
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:12.280]  appreciate him taking time off to come on for some humanitarian purposes in a
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:17.080]  film that he's promoting dealing with just unbelievable horse slaughter but
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:22.200]  he's also dealing with a lot of other social issues and that's Vigo of of
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:27.240]  course Lord of the Rings Vigo Mortensen of so many a huge films I am a giant fan
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:33.160]  my wife is a huge fan everybody I know is a huge fan and he joins us where do
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:37.520]  you join us from sir I am back in California
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:42.440]  first time and in many months I'm actually at a photo lab I'm looking on I
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:47.480]  have a publishing company too and I'm fine doing some images for a new
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:51.000]  publication of ours yeah I knew that you'd just been on a plane recently and
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.320]  we're doing some shoots well it's great to have you with us thank you thank you
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:58.440]  for coming on there's so much to so much to talk about I know that you just
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:04.360]  were given the Dennis Hopper Award at the AMFM festival yeah that was a that
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:10.760]  was a big honor and it was a lot of fun the AMFM inaugural festival down in
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:16.200]  Cathedral City by Palm Springs it was a good event a lot of really interesting
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:21.840]  artists and thoughtful people and people know I have a good time too it was
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:27.680]  probably the most unpretentious film festival or award ceremony I've ever
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:34.320]  been to I think it has a great future I think it's real real artists are gonna
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:39.240]  go more and more to that festival I think well I appreciate you coming on the
[02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:44.080]  broadcast to talk about independent festivals independent film music I know
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:48.680]  you're a huge supporter of that what is your view on the growth of independent
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:54.400]  culture well it's always been there and it's always gonna be there just how much
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:58.240]  attention they get you know when people don't hear about it very much I think it's
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:03.120]  dead or they think you know artists have told out or something that there's
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:08.280]  people making you know original art all the time interacting with each other the
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:15.440]  great thing about something like the AMFM festival down there is that it wasn't
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:19.120]  just about movies it was about photographers and painters sculptors
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:25.080]  writers and there were these gatherings where people would be on stage or
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:31.440]  different venues talking about their artwork and a lot of getting a lot of
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:35.400]  ideas from other people working different you know in a different medium
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:40.560]  that can inspire you a lot I mean I'm I'm someone who I think that the reason
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:48.120]  that they that they offered me was just because I was a friend of Dennis Hoppers
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:52.840]  and had worked with him in a couple of movies but but because we had a life you
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:58.360]  know the long friendship where we shared a lot of ideas about painting and art
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:04.960]  work together and that not just acting and you know Dennis was always curious
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:08.760]  even towards the end of his life he would always want to go see a new artist show
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:13.400]  or a new independent movie he was curious you know and curiosity is
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:18.760]  something that we all have as kids it's something that either gets beaten out of
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:24.800]  you or you somehow become ashamed or led to be ashamed of the way you draw or
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:29.080]  your ideas are dressing up or playing make-believe and all that sort of stuff
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:35.440]  and and I think the function that artists have is to keep people childlike in a
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:40.720]  positive way you know to keep open to the world and I think that apart from
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:44.920]  traveling to different countries or different communities different parts
[02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:53.880]  of your city I think that art is one of the greatest anti-war and anti-poverty
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:58.880]  weapons there are once your eyes are open and you see how other people live
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.400]  and how other people think and create it's a lot less likely that you're
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:11.560]  going to be convinced by your your army captain or your president or your
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:17.120]  politicians that it's a good idea to go bomb this or that country it's a good idea
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:21.680]  to forget about this or that community or this group of people in your own
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:26.640]  country I think that that's I mean the kids kids play together they don't look
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:31.200]  at what color the other kid is they don't they don't judge you kids drawing
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:34.440]  you know they thought oh you do that let me draw this let me show you what you
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:39.040]  could add to that drawing or you know look at this thing I found what do you
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:43.080]  think of this you know and comparing in a positive way I think that's something
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:48.000]  kids naturally do when we get older you know I can speak for myself as an artist
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.600]  or as an actor even you know they make believe kids when they're playing when
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:56.640]  they're five six seven years old and they and they believe that they're cowboys
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:01.600]  or princesses or Robin Hood or you know Lakota chiefs or whatever they're doing
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:06.280]  or Superman or Iron Man you don't have to direct them you don't have to say
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:11.520]  let's do another take because I didn't really believe that you were convinced
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:17.040]  yourself it's that joy of discovery and yeah and but as actors when you're
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:21.040]  adult you didn't even direct once I want to say I didn't believe that did you
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:25.960]  believe that yeah well you can do better come on and it's because we get we get
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:30.200]  stiff just like I'm not so good this you have to exercise your creative muscles
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:35.160]  just like you have to wow well Vigo Mortensen international a superstar
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:38.840]  joins us you know I know a few people out in Hollywood and they've all told me
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:42.200]  you are the most down-to-earth cool person they know you speak what is it
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:47.240]  six seven languages you're a writer painter musician I've seen some of the
[02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:50.320]  amazing YouTube interviews you've done and there's so much I want to ask you in
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:53.960]  the limited time I want to get into the sequel rise of the renegades dealing
[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:57.480]  with the insanity of what's happening with wild horses with you but but
[02:19:57.480 --> 02:20:03.320]  shifting gears the NSA what do you make of the fact that just a few years ago
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:07.080]  people would say oh it's a conspiracy theory that they're listening to us and
[02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:11.440]  now we learned they're targeting political dissidents Aaron Swartz was
[02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:15.560]  being harassed we're learning that they're using the IRS against political
[02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:20.200]  groups do you think there's an awakening happening or do you think that now
[02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:25.480]  the system just doesn't care if we know that we're slaves basically Vigo there
[02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:28.920]  is an awakening because all these things have been talked about right now
[02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:35.320]  today but you know people people have very short attention spans nowadays you
[02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:41.320]  know the more gadgets we have the more phones and apps and then you started with
[02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:48.360]  the on-spot of cable TV way back when and then the internet and the more access
[02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:50.960]  we have you would think the more informed we're going to be and the more
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:55.160]  connected we're going to be with each other but people tend to go to the
[02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:58.800]  information that supports what they already believe yes you know and so
[02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:05.760]  people seem to get more disunited and more united unfortunately and when I say
[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:11.000]  short attention span yeah the whole stuff about the NSA or about you know the
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:15.680]  IRS about the drone strikes I mean how much are they talking about drone strikes
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:20.000]  right now not really at all but like another fabric just went away and I'm
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:25.520]  in cycle and I think it's the problem man and I think the politicians count on
[02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:31.640]  it as the people can be you know swayed it's like here's a piece of cheese all
[02:21:31.640 --> 02:21:35.760]  of this cheese go over there it just left a while while I take care of this
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:40.240]  other business the problem with Obama and I support a lot of things about him I
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:44.880]  think he's a very intelligent man I supported him more times there wasn't
[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:51.360]  much of another option obviously but the thing is that the people that he appointed
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:55.680]  right to start at the beginning with a 2009 people in now that we're going to be
[02:21:55.680 --> 02:22:02.320]  part of fixing the you know economic disaster that push left or the same
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:05.320]  people that have caused the problem on Wall Street for example so I didn't
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:11.680]  expect much there is his behavior in foreign policy whether it be Iraq
[02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:17.040]  Guantanamo Afghanistan you know people still think that Afghanistan is a good
[02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:22.600]  war but it's not any more of a good war than Iraq what it's not any more of a
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:30.800]  sensible use of our resources and our you know young people's lives and the
[02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:34.880]  even the murder not to mention that sure what about Obama getting a peace prize
[02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:40.160]  and then now putting al-Qaeda in Syria that's ridiculous I mean his I
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:47.920]  unfortunately Obama's government has not really been much different than
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:52.760]  pushes in a lot of areas and not just in foreign policy foreign policy is the
[02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:58.920]  most egregious you know like if we go into we go in Syria now to try to help
[02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:04.480]  get rid of Assad people in the Arab world aren't going to say oh isn't that
[02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:08.400]  great US is doing something good because the way they have seen the United
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:11.760]  States the way they judge the United States is based on how they behave in
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:18.720]  the Israel Palestine situation the way they have behaved since 1948 and every
[02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:23.120]  single president including Obama has given special treatment to Israel and
[02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:28.800]  that's obvious to Arab people so it's going to be hard for us to be considered
[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:32.080]  the good guy who's just something that our government and I think our people
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:35.920]  we all want people to like us and think oh we're the good guys we're the guys
[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:39.960]  from World War two they handed out candy bars on the street
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:44.960]  and and Rome you know we're the guys with the Marshall plan and people don't see
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:49.240]  us that way unfortunately we're they see us as the bullies it's not these
[02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:54.280]  Americans there are any nicer or less nice than other people in the world
[02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:59.600]  which is people but our government which represents it absolutely not has not
[02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:03.640]  been a good player very rarely has been a good player overseas
[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:10.360]  Vigo Mortensen is our is our guest going back to the NSA here Peter King Dick
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:15.480]  Cheney others have called for his arrest there's been news in the Daily Mail
[02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:21.920]  where they're talking about killing him I think that Snowden is a hero leaking the
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:28.960]  NSA info Vigo Mortensen what would you like to say on that subject I think he's
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:35.320]  definitely a very brave person I also think it's ironic that all the the Bush
[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:41.400]  team you know attack Obama and Ernest Obama for doing exactly the same thing
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:48.320]  they were doing you know I mean pretty hypocritical that that behavior I want
[02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:53.400]  to I know this seems like you know a small thing but it starts locally you
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:59.240]  know activism and oh I agree common common sense community activity I have to
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:02.960]  think about that additionally but the AMF festival yeah let's talk about that
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:15.000]  which is that the mayor of Cathedral City Kathleen de Rosa she did something
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:19.480]  very clever the government down there our city council wherever they allowed a
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:25.640]  lot of buildings and you know would be as a consequence of what happened in
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:31.240]  2008 with the economy and the real estate all over the country there was a
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:38.400]  lot of retail space that had been built that you know business is just less
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:42.360]  there and there's always the empty space and a lot of communities and what they
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:48.040]  did in Cathedral City is that they all they donated or gave very low rent the
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:53.680]  people who want to open gallery and art spaces and those spaces down there
[02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:57.600]  being used in a really good way and it's not just that it's nice to look at or
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:02.080]  it's good to take the kids to see artwork well that's what made New York the head
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:07.000]  of culture worldwide was in the 30s them doing that exactly and that that
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:12.600]  proactive stance from the local government down in Cathedral City has not
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:17.760]  just made life richer for people but it's also improved economy there's people
[02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:22.560]  opening you know places to eat there's a lot of activity down there rather than
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:27.840]  just being another urban wasteland you know that's what's great about what you
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:32.040]  do Vigo is if you're so down to earth and you use your mind you're obviously a
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:35.840]  really smart guy and also your celebrity to all over the world you just go
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:40.080]  around actually trying to help people instead of just going to a photo op and
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:45.480]  doing it and and it's so exciting speaking of the a new film Rise of the
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:49.280]  Renegades a sequel to Wild Horses and Renegades you know these beautiful
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:53.600]  horses out there and I and I saw them in write-ups of the film I want to see it
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:57.200]  and you're out there obviously promoting it trying to bring attention to this
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:01.960]  that they gave the horses who to a guy who was going to take care of them and
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:07.840]  get them homes who was a known horse meat guy it's just ridiculous how how
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:12.960]  transparent the government is your take on that well that's a long story and
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:17.680]  probably not time for it but I do recommend you see this movie by James
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:26.880]  Kleiner the Bureau of Land Management and you know government in Washington in
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:35.160]  general has not had a very good history with wild horses and burrows and you know
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:40.080]  it's it's a lot of attention is being brought to the subject by this film but
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:45.680]  also by a lot of other activists not at the man in denial is the woman who is
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:52.720]  tireless probably done more than anyone else on the subject and it's connected
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:56.800]  to a lot of other things you know a lot of one other reason that they want to
[02:27:56.800 --> 02:28:01.160]  get rid of these horses or what happened during the bush years when Cheney was
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:05.800]  in charge of that was handing out free passes to corporations whether it was
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:12.040]  illegal or not to go into protected areas where these horses are to to extract
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:17.120]  resources and building roads when you weren't allowed to build roads and the
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:22.680]  judicial system was so clogged up with all these violations that they these
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:27.480]  people knew that they could go in there and we have it on our public land which
[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:32.040]  belonged to all Americans and that it would take years for them to be
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:36.360]  processed and they could extract the resources room the place and move on and
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:40.640]  probably later settle out of court or something no it's a big problem there's
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:45.040]  a lot of issues involved it's not just about protecting wild horses which is
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:50.360]  a great thing in itself so folks need to see the film you know we're going to
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:55.560]  see I encourage people to see the film and just put Google put wild horses or
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:29:00.520]  wild horses preservation you know do a little homework you know that's the
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:03.640]  great thing about the internet if you use it wisely you can learn a lot of things
[02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:08.200]  I mean I learned things every day from it but you know as far as the news the
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:11.840]  things that you talk about on your program all the time you know your
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:15.920]  listeners will often I'm sure be surprised that really that's what's going on
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:19.520]  and then I'll go look it up when I say that people tend to go to what they
[02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:22.920]  already know it's what they do you know you go look at the news about your
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:35.760]  sports well Vigo my broadcast you're listening to CNN or the Fox or you'll listen to that and watch MSNBC here or whatever you listen to your show only I think it's to I try to

[02:33:13.400 --> 02:33:18.000]  by the way I've never talked to Vigo before I was told that he heard the show
[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.040]  sometimes and I was talking to him during the break that that is the case I'm
[02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:25.360]  very flattered I am a huge fan of his work and the rumor was out there last
[02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:29.520]  year I just asked him during the break Vigo you were offered the part of Zod
[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:35.840]  and didn't take it I wasn't available at the time I'm unfortunately it probably
[02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:39.800]  would have been a lot of fun to play that part although I have a lot of respect
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:45.600]  for Taryn Sampson trail I gotta say oh yeah I saw him in the Iceman chilling
[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:51.640]  he's an incredible actor he's very good yeah you can do everything you know you
[02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:58.200]  just try to follow your instincts and and you know my philosophy is prepare the
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:03.120]  best you can for accidents to happen because they always will and something
[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:08.000]  good can come out of an obstacle always oh who knows absolutely but but I would
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:12.280]  love to see you see you play a villain I mean I've seen you play like mobsters
[02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:17.680]  trying to be reformed and things have I missed a film where you're a villain
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:22.440]  well I played Lucifer once in a movie called The Prophecy that's right that's
[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:28.600]  all that Chris Walken yeah that's a good movie you never know I mean just I
[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:35.640]  just try to follow my nose you know if I like a story I'll go do it I don't
[02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:40.840]  really think about the budget or or where it's being shot or anything and you
[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:44.200]  know fortunately the second thing more than one line which has been able to
[02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:49.560]  work last couple years I did two really interesting movies down in Argentina one
[02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:53.400]  that came out recently here called everyone has a plan or play twin brothers
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:35:00.360]  who don't like each other very much kind of thriller and you know I might go do
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:03.520]  a movie that's been in a very interesting you ever seen a movie called
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:08.400]  battle about Gears by Punta Corvo I love that movie it's almost like a
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:12.800]  documentary you're watching it and you think it's real yeah unbelievable
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:17.120]  that during the fight for independence in Algeria from from France which has
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:23.120]  been a colonial occupier for 130 years and imagine if the United States had been
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:28.480]  in Iraq for 130 years straight that's how set up the people were there but it
[02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:33.120]  was a it was a complicated subject anyway there's a movie that's being shot
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:40.800]  that takes place during that period late 50s in North Africa this fall and
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:47.240]  back in that one but I got a bone up a little bit I can't I can't wait to see
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:51.360]  that well I hope it gets over your problem is those little movies have a
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:56.480]  hard time getting this over here but you know I figure you do your best you do
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:00.240]  good job eventually it'll get things done well we're seeing a re-insurgence of
[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:04.560]  art house films because of more of the smaller theaters I just love it moving
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:09.120]  quickly because I know you've got to go Bob Anderson the the greatest sword
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:13.840]  master ever who died last year said you were the greatest swordsman he ever
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:18.600]  trained and I think he said not just in movies I mean how good are you with a
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:23.040]  sword Vega well I'm probably a little rusty now but that was that's high praise
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:28.960]  coming from father Anderson he said he's a legend and in sword master circle he
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:34.760]  was something else he was you know he was he's been in movies he was in the
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:39.720]  Olympics until he started out as a you know he was a fencing champion and a
[02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:44.600]  great person he was he was an incredible teacher very strict sometimes but he had
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:49.160]  a good sense of humor and he was tough but he was fair and I learned a lot from
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:53.240]  him he's the one who who taught me to do all the fighting for Lord of the Rings
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:56.840]  that's where I met him and then I subsequently did a period movie at
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:37:03.600]  the Spanish epic 17th century where we fought with with two blades you know with
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:08.480]  rapier and dagger so bottom line don't don't get in a knife fight with Vega
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:13.320]  Mortensen I want to give out the name of your publishing company where you also
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:17.000]  publish a lot of photos articles videos things you're doing I've been at the
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:22.080]  site before so many great things on there it's a Percival press dot com and
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:26.360]  we'll email that out at the real Alex Jones on Twitter going back to what you
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:28.840]  said right before the break and then I've got one other question I'll let you
[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:32.440]  get out of here Vega your sweetheart to come on with us your busy schedule you
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:36.120]  were talking about getting outside the box Google admits they now in YouTube
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:41.400]  tries to keep you in what they think you're you like and they admit to
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:45.960]  balkanize the population out of and I agree with you the greatest solution
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:52.200]  they do that they take what you're surfing history already is and they
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:56.200]  admit then if you're searching or on YouTube or anything they own then they
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:02.080]  try to keep you on a digital plantation of only what you're already into
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:06.040]  yeah you gotta it's true that you have to push yourself you know I mean it's
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:10.040]  the same as getting off the couch and at least going for a walk you know it's
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:14.120]  not it's not always the first thing you want to do you'd maybe rather stand the
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:18.720]  couch and use another bag of chips but but it you know it's good for you to get
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:22.440]  out and go for a run or go for a walk or go talk to somebody you know get off the
[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:27.440]  phone get a get away from the TV and so forth once in a while or regularly and
[02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:30.960]  at the same was looking for if you're curious about what's going on in your
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:36.080]  community and what's going on in the world you gotta make an extra effort
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:42.240]  you know go listen to people and read people that you probably you know you
[02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:45.960]  probably want to read with just to get the other side of it make up your own
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:54.000]  mind because the left the right all all all journalists all commentators have
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:58.960]  their span have their motivation get out of the run get out of the run expand
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:03.480]  and make up your own mind but you gotta make an effort it's not just gonna be
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:07.800]  handed to you by a computer without you making an effort to go look elsewhere
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:13.640]  well Vigo amazing in closing most horror movies I'm not a horror fan I like
[02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:16.240]  science fiction that has some you know violence in it or whatever just because
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:23.160]  that makes it more real but since I was a child no movies have scared me and I've
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:26.080]  seen movies before that are you know we're action adventure and I want to
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:32.520]  watch them again the road touched me like no other film I've ever seen and
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:37.000]  because I've studied history and things and had some experiences it's so real
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:41.400]  and and I know within 10 days most people become cannibals in Pentagon
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:51.000]  studies oh in closing that's a film that I am physically afraid to watch again
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:55.840]  because of almost the ancestral fears that it rises and what if there's a
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:40:00.840]  nuclear war what of our atmosphere what if what if the road what can you say
[02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:05.800]  about that well it's true it's a harrowing experience to watch it but it's
[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:10.920]  also beautifully made and John it is directed directed that movie and John
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:16.080]  did a great job with a tough subject matter and the boy in it Cody's
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:21.800]  magnificent he's now he's over six feet tall he's a man now but he was he was
[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:26.160]  fantastic in that in that movie and it's unfortunate that at the last minute
[02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:30.360]  that I'm not to distribute it as widely as they were going to but like I say
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:37.280]  good work eventually get seen and a lot of people on the street as many people
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:42.480]  comment on that movie as they do any other movie they really really touched
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:48.440]  the nerve and it's kind of like you say it's it's a good warning in a way like
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:55.880]  if we don't want to do that well the most touching part is in closing is when
[02:40:55.880 --> 02:41:03.160]  Robert DeVall you and your son are there and he explains that boy's a god in
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:06.640]  this ugly destroyed world he doesn't say that but that's what I got in the
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:11.920]  poetry of it is that this youth this energy the creativity the green shoots
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:18.080]  in a dead world if children are our future and I mean what does you take
[02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:24.080]  away by that writing yeah beautiful I mean it I would paraphrase in the way
[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:30.600]  what he was saying or how I would put it is the children are God pay attention
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:36.200]  that doesn't mean or your kid or doesn't mean you're talking about the kids but
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:40.760]  remember what you felt when you are kids remember your creative instincts
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:45.920]  remember your instincts for peace remember your instincts for fellowship and
[02:41:45.920 --> 02:41:51.840]  for making something beautiful out of life not destroying the world and not
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:58.000]  destroying the lives of others you know as adults often do unfortunately so
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:02.080]  remember kid remember yourself with the kid and you're gonna be on the right
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:05.760]  track well Viggo Mortensen you are a beautiful person and I hope to meet you
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:09.200]  someday in person God bless you for sharing your time with us and we're
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:12.480]  trying to help humanity you're an example to us all and I look forward to

[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:24.280]  that was a powerful interview that is really amazing and and it's it's amazing
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:29.200]  to know that we've touched Viggo that he listens to the show and it's just another
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:32.800]  example of you know how many amazing people there are out there that know
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:36.320]  what's happening I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen I've read too many accounts
[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:44.120]  of war and collab society seeing something like The Road that movie is it's
[02:42:44.120 --> 02:42:49.200]  like Godfather 1 where it's like it's real or or the Battle for Algiers he
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:55.360]  mentioned you watch that and you think it's a documentary it's done so good and
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:43:01.400]  there's parts of Godfather where it's not magic like that the road is magic from
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:08.360]  the start to the end and Viggo is a artist oh man I'm having a good day
[02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:14.680]  right now talking to Viggo off air too man that is awesome that is awesome and
[02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:18.800]  we're influencing him he's influencing us and he explained we guys bring the
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:21.560]  chair and bring the next guest in who I apologize to is he here or is he doing
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:25.560]  the interview with Yukari he's here let's let's bring in our guests who I
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:31.360]  apologize moving him so Viggo could come on I heard last week that Viggo would be
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:34.920]  happy to come on but then he had to go down to Argentina and he was coming back
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:41.080]  and then and so he couldn't do the video interview and he has all those new
[02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:46.480]  interviews when he's in character shooting a film and then I said whatever
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:49.240]  if he wants to come on we'll hear from him and we heard from him this morning
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:54.000]  and so that happened and I next time I'm out in LA and he's out there I've been
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:57.200]  I'm invited out to LA a lot of some of time to go out there I need to get out
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:01.160]  to LA there's a lot of unfinished business the Joe Rogan podcast a bunch of
[02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:05.200]  TV interviews I got to do a couple people I got to meet with and people like
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:09.880]  Viggo Mortensen that is just unbelievable because I could care less
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:14.080]  about getting some Hollywood star on that I don't admire and I don't admire
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:18.360]  many of them but that's the guy that turned down the roll for Zod I mean
[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:23.160]  think about that and I got to tell you ladies and gentlemen I need to get my
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:27.560]  folder on our next guest we're gonna go into overdrive with and who I want to
[02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:30.600]  apologize to but but I think you understand getting moved for Viggo
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:36.440]  Mortensen this guy I'm a fan of I I see him do these open-carry demonstrations I
[02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:40.240]  see him on the news I see him in town hall debates nationally and locally and
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:44.640]  this is a guy who is a leader Michael Cargill and he lives here in Austin I'll
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:47.200]  just do it right here on air but you're gonna have to kind of chase us because we
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:50.600]  get so busy we forget I'd like to invite you once a week to come in and do a gun
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:56.680]  report for us hell of a way to meet you I'm like get in here come work for us
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:45:01.840]  right now Michael Cargill and of course he's one of the haunches over there at
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:07.760]  Central Texas gunworks.com and he spent 12 years in the U.S. Army study
[02:45:07.760 --> 02:45:11.400]  criminal justice at Detroit State University and while he was in the Army
[02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:15.120]  he was awarded the Army commendations medals eight Army achievement medals and
[02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:18.000]  four Army good conduct medals not gonna go through his whole viral run out of
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:22.200]  time with him he's a qualified expert marksman both in rifle and hand grenades
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:27.080]  and as an airborne qualified parachutist and hope you don't send to assassinate me
[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:30.120]  I'm joking we're talking about the Army earlier and after his honorable discharge
[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:32.800]  he works in telecommunications and now works in the Second Amendment and
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:37.920]  everything else and he's just does a lot of amazing work I'm managing huge
[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:41.040]  accounts I'm not gonna get into your whole bio it's a very interesting bio
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:45.560]  and we're just excited to have you here you're an NRA certified safety range
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:50.640]  instructor officer and just defend the Second Amendment while we've got you
[02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:55.680]  here and it's very exciting to you know to see us defeating their last raft of
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:45:59.240]  gun grabbing but I'm concerned after the next event they're gonna come after us
[02:45:59.240 --> 02:46:02.600]  yet again so Michael Cargill good to have you here sir thank you sir thank
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:05.000]  you for having me I really appreciate that you bet we're having on the nightly
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:10.480]  news with Jakari Jackson and I too as well so again wow so much going on well
[02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:14.720]  what what would you say is the state of our Second Amendment I tell you well we
[02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:19.200]  have a serious problem here especially after the midterm elections I actually
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:23.880]  expect this current administration to come after our Second Amendments again
[02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:29.200]  for sure oh yeah they've said I mean that's what she don't pause or I'll talk
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:36.120]  over the whole time man the Gargoyle up there Senator Feinstein said there will
[02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:40.320]  be other events and work and since she smiled right right and see the reason I
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:43.560]  got into this business in the first place is back when I was in the military
[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:47.720]  my grandmother at 70 years old decided that she was gonna travel back to college
[02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:51.520]  you get a college degree my grandmother only got a high school education so at
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:55.000]  70 she wanted to become a nurse and while my grandmother was traveling back
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:58.560]  from a college library sitting at a bus stop waiting for a bus to come a guy
[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:02.600]  came along mugged her and raped her oh my gosh and I decided that point that I
[02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:05.880]  would make sure that every female in my family had a tool had the tools they
[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:09.280]  need to protect themselves is that scumbag in prison no he's not
[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:13.880]  unfortunately you know but we I think he's not gonna fall down his head is he
[02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:19.240]  my ribs my grandmother yeah right right I know and I just want to empower
[02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:23.320]  women to defend themselves because they can't have a police officer on their
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:27.400]  backs 24 exactly these feminists are against women having guns they're not
[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:32.560]  feminist they're scum exactly exactly 100% and so that's why I support the
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:35.520]  second minute I support all our constitutional rights but I really you
[02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:37.760]  know I'm pushing for the second amendment well there's also this thing with
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:40.480]  women that they go oh I wouldn't be good with guns women as you know
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:45.080]  statistically are as good or better than men with guns right and I'm totally
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:50.080]  have you found that as an instructor oh yeah oh yes we get it takes me about two
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:54.880]  minutes to get I sit there and talk to a lady and culture into what to do what
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:58.800]  to look for and then bam she hits it you know hits it right of the park and
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:02.160]  it will do a lot better than the men in our class well that's what we see an
[02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:06.120]  Olympic shooting they're as good as the best men at shooting and just generally
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:11.720]  women are easier to train in firearms right right I agree 100% yeah I tell
[02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:16.520]  you we had that doesn't matter we had a we had a rock stars daughter out with a
[02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:20.160]  shooting out of stoner ranch the real stoner ranch and she was like shooting
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:24.440]  bulls I had 300 yards with a Lapua that we hadn't even cited in properly and like
[02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:28.120]  it immediately we were all shooting around it till we got it cited in it's
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:31.440]  like instinct she was shooting even though it wasn't cited in properly right
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:35.720]  we were like how are you doing this that's yeah I tell people you know it
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:40.480]  takes me about I don't know nine hours and 45 minutes to actually sit there and
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:44.160]  talk to a person and teach them how not to pull that gun out but it takes me all
[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:48.680]  of good five minutes to actually teach them the action specifics of exactly a
[02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:52.720]  good gun trainer will teach you when to use the gun that's the key right it's
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:56.920]  not even about they've mystified guns right like in these movies we issue a
[02:48:56.920 --> 02:49:01.280]  357 and it blows you back I mean I can shoot 250 cows standing up it's hard to
[02:49:01.280 --> 02:49:04.000]  pick them up but if I can pick them up I can shoot them both correct and they
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:07.120]  always focus on the wrong things you know they're focusing on you know
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:10.800]  targeting lawful gun owners rather than just the criminals you know and it's
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:14.040]  about you know getting rid of these criminals and empowering the people you
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:17.440]  know it's not like where the president is from you know Chicago Illinois you
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:21.400]  know and they call it land of Lincoln I like to call land of the lawless those
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:25.680]  fell gun laws in Connecticut didn't work for them in Connecticut the fell gun
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:28.840]  laws in Chicago Illinois not working for them there and they're not going to
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:32.960]  work for us here in Texas man I don't know who these guys are that they go
[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:36.400]  around like raping women I mean who he doesn't even come in your mind to want
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:39.920]  to do that and I just want to see them all get killed right I mean let me tell
[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:44.160]  you somebody does something to my wife they're gonna get a snub nose 357 pulled
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:48.880]  out jammed in their chest and they're dead right right you know it and it's
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:53.240]  important that we educate you know our community and how to empower themselves
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:57.120]  to protect themselves because we should need law enforcement you know to to
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:00.500]  hover over us and protect us you know it's not about I want government to get
[02:50:00.500 --> 02:50:03.200]  out of our business get out of the people's business and government should
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:06.200]  be transparent so we can see what's going on with government but then the
[02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:09.920]  people's business should be private absolutely well listen I want you to
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:13.800]  reenact what I saw you in like a town hall that was local but then it went

[02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:38.200]  gun store very popular one of the most successful people in central texas and
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:45.200]  you can go to central texas gunworks dot com and also a cargill for constable
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:49.040]  dot com what's going on with that we're actually not running the constable race
[02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:53.080]  anymore that was something that we did last year to educate people right we're
[02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:57.800]  we were actually running against a don balster's aka the cocaine constable and
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:02.720]  he actually when he used to work for DPS he allowed 4,000 kilograms of cocaine
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:07.360]  across over Mexico to the United States so DPS actually fired him and then he
[02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:12.880]  actually got a job for the constable and then eventually ran for constable and
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:17.600]  so we actually ran against him in that election but since I was a I ran as a
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:24.480]  democrat and since I was a second amendment supporter and the the local
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:27.480]  leadership in the democratic party decided that they were not going to
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:31.120]  support me in that race because of my disgusting right my second amendment
[02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:34.880]  stand doesn't matter though you got to expose them right so yes so we expose
[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:38.560]  them and that's what it's about I mean a lot of times running is about getting on
[02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:42.280]  the news and fighting the new world order right what is your view on politics
[02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:47.880]  worldwide well I think we need to get out we need the president promised that
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:51.960]  our people would actually you know our troops will return home he would bring
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:55.840]  the troops home and he is not held up to that promise and they're still in Iraq
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:55:59.080]  and they say they withdrew they didn't yes and we need to return our troops
[02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:01.720]  back to the United States we need to take care of the United States take care
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:05.640]  of our people here you're like a rhombol type guy right oh yes sir I've heard
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:08.280]  you on the radio and stuff I just don't want to speak for you oh yes sir you're
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:13.380]  like in the extremist club basically well you know you love freedom mom and
[02:56:13.380 --> 02:56:16.560]  apple pie your bad guy well my motto is you know when they come for your guns
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:20.840]  give them your bullets absolutely and that's why we're fighting so hard you
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:25.200]  know for me it's the line in the sand it's it's it's it's slavery I mean I I'm
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:27.600]  not bringing this up because you're black I bring it up all the time the first
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:30.920]  gun laws as you know we're against black people in the south yes after the civil
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:34.520]  war on record and then they have all these commentators on BET and CNN and
[02:56:34.520 --> 02:56:41.540]  Fox black and white and Hispanic saying the NRAs the Klan and I mean where do
[02:56:41.540 --> 02:56:46.080]  they that's that's the opposite of the reality oh no exactly the exact opposite
[02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:50.640]  the National Rifle Association focuses on training they may not be as extreme as
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:53.880]  some people would like them to be because they're you know trying to work
[02:56:53.880 --> 02:56:58.160]  that political process they're sure not the Klan exactly they're not the KKK
[02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:02.560]  but I mean that's obvious I don't know why they don't I'm not a shoe guy but at
[02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:05.680]  a certain point you got to sue people right I mean I'm surprised Fox hadn't
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:09.600]  been sued for them having their people on there saying the NRA is the Klan and
[02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:13.440]  wants to kill black people how do you come up with that the people they need
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:16.520]  to focus on is the current administration because this administration
[02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:19.680]  wants to come up with universal background checks when you do universal
[02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:23.480]  background checks what that's gonna do is first of all we have over a million
[02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:27.040]  people that are locked up in jail right now in this country out of that million
[02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:30.440]  people the majority of them are African-Americans so when you come up with
[02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:34.720]  any new laws new gun laws those laws are gonna focus on that community oh you
[02:57:34.720 --> 02:57:37.680]  know they are exactly you're gonna give the police more power to come out of
[02:57:37.680 --> 02:57:41.520]  those people and put more blacks in jail so need the guns to protect themselves
[02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:44.360]  that's correct so this president will actually be the person that more
[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:48.040]  responsible for putting more black people in jail instead of doing the exact
[02:57:48.040 --> 02:57:50.600]  opposite look what he's doing with Africa and they didn't Africa they're not
[02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:54.680]  there to help I'll tell you that yeah you absolutely right it's unbelievable what
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:58.120]  they get away with I tell you it is unbelievable and not that I like John
[02:57:58.120 --> 02:58:01.480]  McCain or you know the other guys that he ran against Mitt Romney it's that
[02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:05.600]  there's no choice it just gets worse and worse but with Obama this is a guy
[02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:10.040]  raised by the weathermen I mean it's just creepy right and you got to be
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:13.760]  careful because one of his big supporters is a gun guy you know he's
[02:58:13.760 --> 02:58:18.480]  being supported by a gun manufacturer so you got to be careful with that too who
[02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:23.320]  is the president is one of his big support who is that oh man I can't even
[02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:26.000]  think of the name right now I apologize but you know I forgot I remember
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:30.360]  reading that's why I forgot you forgot why I was asking you Michael Cargill is

[03:00:55.800 --> 03:01:00.920]  amendment points with our guests but Michael I was riveted by the town hall
[03:01:00.920 --> 03:01:03.720]  meeting I saw you and you were really tearing those people up and I love how
[03:01:03.720 --> 03:01:08.360]  they take a few anti-gun politicians and call them moms against guns like moms
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:12.400]  are against guns they're not against of the government having guns no and the
[03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:16.840]  main goal of these people were is actually to strip us of our gun rights
[03:01:16.840 --> 03:01:20.280]  you know the we asked a young lady that was sitting next to me you know what
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:23.840]  were some of the things that she wanted to do and she said her main thing is she
[03:01:23.840 --> 03:01:28.560]  didn't believe that anyone should be able to have access to firearms so yeah
[03:01:28.560 --> 03:01:34.040]  there's you know and what do you say to a person like that you know and I told
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:38.800]  her that some of the things that we need to focus on as far as Travis County in
[03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:43.240]  the state of Texas we need to focus on you know I get a person that will walk
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:48.160]  into my gun store and that person would want to sell me a gun and then do you
[03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:52.560]  know that there's no way for a gun store to verify if that gun stolen or not you
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:55.480]  know so those are some of the things they need to focus on they're always
[03:01:55.480 --> 03:01:58.920]  focusing on the wrong things they're always focusing on individuals and and
[03:01:58.920 --> 03:02:01.840]  probably that's because they're all getting kickbacks out of it that's what
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:05.920]  the pawn shops are for right and I can drive down to a mile from here and show
[03:02:05.920 --> 03:02:11.360]  you drugs being sold cops drive right by it right right and it's funny you say
[03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:15.040]  that because I actually you know contacted you know the local law
[03:02:15.040 --> 03:02:19.640]  enforcement also contacted the mayor's office and said hey you know what can we
[03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:24.080]  do about this problem with someone walking into the gun store and wanted to
[03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:27.800]  sell a gun and me a gun store owner being able to verify that gun is stolen or
[03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:32.080]  not why that person stand standing right there at the counter actually I can
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:36.920]  actually call the they don't want to make citizens proactive no then call and
[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:40.920]  check and see if it's stolen to shut down the stolen gun market exactly they
[03:02:40.920 --> 03:02:43.880]  don't want real solutions exactly know why do they want us to live like in
[03:02:43.880 --> 03:02:48.160]  Chicago I honestly I do not know and and you know next thing they're gonna do is
[03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:50.760]  again I said what's in National Guard into Chicago and yeah though they're
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:54.180]  saying that now right but I'm sorry I never have to jump out about that what
[03:02:54.180 --> 03:02:57.680]  did the city council do when you wanted a real plan why I let them you know I
[03:02:57.680 --> 03:03:01.200]  told them here here's that situation here's what's going on you know a pawn
[03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:04.880]  shop they have rules they do certain things but a gun store you walk into a
[03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:08.800]  gun store you try to sell a gun the gun store you know can't dial you know the
[03:03:08.800 --> 03:03:12.040]  local law enforcement and verify that serial number to see if that comes using
[03:03:12.040 --> 03:03:17.000]  a crime or reported stolen or anything like that and the you know the response
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:20.520]  I got was I'm sorry I know you're trying to run an honest business but there's
[03:03:20.520 --> 03:03:24.560]  nothing that we can do about it and again they should just have a program
[03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:29.200]  where stolen guns people can tell the police put it in a database right it and
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:32.560]  you ever have what you know look like meth heads or crack heads come in that
[03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:36.680]  are obviously super seedy have a weird story and you refuse to buy a gun yes
[03:03:36.680 --> 03:03:40.120]  we've had that situation happen probably about a month ago young man walked
[03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:43.760]  into the store and he was really high strong and wanted to buy a gun he actually
[03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:48.280]  wanted by gun to kill somebody and he actually told that to someone down the
[03:03:48.280 --> 03:03:52.960]  street there in a sporting goods store and they sent him to us and so when he
[03:03:52.960 --> 03:03:58.360]  walked into the shop my my staff actually contacted me and I hit the sound alarm
[03:03:58.360 --> 03:04:01.320]  we had to please show up and they actually pulled him out and sent him to
[03:04:01.320 --> 03:04:06.520]  do a medical medical eval done but that does happen you know and it's up to it's
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:12.440]  it's our responsibility as citizens to you know protect us you know from things
[03:04:12.440 --> 03:04:15.800]  like that obviously out of his mind right right walking in I'm gonna go I need
[03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:19.000]  a gun to kill somebody right and the other stores didn't send him to you right
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:23.760]  oh no don't do go to him right cowards see right that's another thing most
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:27.440]  people are such cowards now are not all everybody but a large segment that they
[03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:32.400]  just never stand up to bad guys so they just run rampant yes sir I agree with
[03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:37.080]  you 100% so that's why it's up to the people you know to protect ourselves we
[03:04:37.080 --> 03:04:42.360]  need to arm the people in and it's like I said when they come for your guns I say
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:45.800]  give them your bullets what did the guy do when I want to hear when the cop
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:48.640]  showed up what did you do well they showed up they actually pulled them
[03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:52.440]  outside when they pulled them outside about 10 you know officers showed up
[03:04:52.440 --> 03:04:55.480]  yeah someone else in his family showed up there's a big fight outside in the
[03:04:55.480 --> 03:04:59.400]  parking lot not in my shop it's up to me to make sure that the people in my shop

[03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:42.200]  former instructors in there and all I hear is great stuff in fact he's like
[03:08:42.200 --> 03:08:45.800]  yeah we cleaned a couple year 50 cows we're a big gunsmith too and I never
[03:08:45.800 --> 03:08:48.520]  have time to mess with this stuff Weldon took him in there those are some
[03:08:48.520 --> 03:08:55.320]  pretty rifles huh they want to they want to test them for you so you liked them
[03:08:55.320 --> 03:08:58.800]  oh yes sir yes all right well it's good to have you here with us we've got
[03:08:58.800 --> 03:09:01.840]  callers calling in that are all over the map and I want to go to some of them
[03:09:01.840 --> 03:09:07.000]  but more about that town hall I saw you on TV with last week and and how they
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:10.080]  use this playbook I mean this is all about disarming us did you see the
[03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:16.000]  video we got of the mayor pro team at the Capitol where people had signs
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:19.720]  saying no gun ban he said listen after we get them registered you're gonna need
[03:09:19.720 --> 03:09:22.960]  that sign then we will confiscate them but we're not doing that now that's
[03:09:22.960 --> 03:09:27.800]  next Feinstein all of them are on record they want our guns and they're so
[03:09:27.800 --> 03:09:32.520]  disingenuous when they're on CNN going we don't want your guns I mean it should
[03:09:32.520 --> 03:09:36.560]  be game over they're disingenuous and I think that's why they're losing their
[03:09:36.560 --> 03:09:39.760]  gun control debate because people know they're a pack of scum right they're
[03:09:39.760 --> 03:09:42.600]  actually traveling around the country trying to find out different ways to
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:47.880]  come after individual firearms and I tell them focus on the things that you can
[03:09:47.880 --> 03:09:51.040]  actually control you know those little things you know why don't you go after
[03:09:51.040 --> 03:09:54.000]  the where the criminals located you know we don't need gun control we actually
[03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:57.120]  need criminal control you know and I'm not because I'm not giving you my
[03:09:57.120 --> 03:10:00.360]  farms you're not gonna get them you come out to my farms you knock on my door
[03:10:00.360 --> 03:10:04.560]  and I'm just I'm giving you my bullets first what's 50 cows you like the the
[03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:10.160]  Navy version or the army standard I like the Navy version that was actually
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:14.280]  pretty nice we got to take you out shooting sometime man yes I'm just so
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:18.480]  busy I want to do the gun show I shot like three shoots with the Steiner's
[03:10:18.480 --> 03:10:21.960]  three great videos coming out soon but it's gonna be about us out there with
[03:10:21.960 --> 03:10:26.280]  50 cows around to figure them out never shooting those particular ones had them
[03:10:26.280 --> 03:10:29.160]  for a long time now the price has gone up so much thank God I got him a while
[03:10:29.160 --> 03:10:35.680]  back but if Obama has done anything they have certainly woken people up and I
[03:10:35.680 --> 03:10:39.760]  think it's backfired on yes because they're not focusing on safety they're
[03:10:39.760 --> 03:10:43.160]  actually focusing on you know taking people's second amendment rights it's
[03:10:43.160 --> 03:10:48.320]  about control and not about safety at all they focus on the safety aspects of
[03:10:48.320 --> 03:10:54.400]  it they focus on the things that they can do within the ATF and the FBI in that
[03:10:54.400 --> 03:10:58.000]  system focus on mental health those are the things that they can actually
[03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:01.120]  control but they're not focusing on that they actually want to just go after
[03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:05.160]  individuals guns and like a person gets deployed overseas you know we're you
[03:11:05.160 --> 03:11:08.600]  know instead of sending troops home you know we've got police I'm sorry troops
[03:11:08.600 --> 03:11:12.880]  deployed around this world and when when our troops come back they're actually
[03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:17.240]  labeling them with PTSD and then once they label them with PTSD then they
[03:11:17.240 --> 03:11:20.600]  want to take the farms away from them and then all of a sudden go back and
[03:11:20.600 --> 03:11:24.640]  redeploy them again but take a firearm away from you while you're at home but
[03:11:24.640 --> 03:11:28.760]  you're okay to fight when you're overseas that is unbelievable I've seen
[03:11:28.760 --> 03:11:33.320]  that yes well look I mean any corrupt regime wants to go after the veterans
[03:11:33.320 --> 03:11:36.680]  Hitler did it yes he had neither long knives we went after hundreds of
[03:11:36.680 --> 03:11:41.200]  thousands of soldiers and people and this is what Stalin did that Lenin did
[03:11:41.200 --> 03:11:45.880]  that Mao did that I mean the police and military better be the first ones to
[03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:49.440]  figure out that they better get on board with the people and just say no to
[03:11:49.440 --> 03:11:53.840]  tyranny and I see that happening between 40 and 50 percent of the troops I run
[03:11:53.840 --> 03:11:58.120]  into are our listeners and they say most of the people in their units are awake
[03:11:58.120 --> 03:12:01.920]  to the New World Order what are you hearing I'm here the exact same thing
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:05.680]  we need to bring our troops home we need to pay attention to what's going on
[03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:10.480]  going on in our federal government listen to what you know your your
[03:12:10.480 --> 03:12:14.400]  commanding chief is saying bring our troops home bring them home that's all
[03:12:14.400 --> 03:12:18.280]  I can stress enough bring them home but the globalists have a problem the
[03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:22.200]  military is awake and and how is it going to fly saying the troops are the
[03:12:22.200 --> 03:12:26.080]  number one terror threat with no evidence of that in these new training
[03:12:26.080 --> 03:12:31.840]  manuals no I disagree with that but it's asinine it's like saying Mary Poppins is
[03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:36.800]  the terror threat right no no how about the crooks in government saying that
[03:12:36.800 --> 03:12:40.880]  are the problem yes government is definitely definitely going to be the
[03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:43.480]  problem like I said government should be transparent we need to be able to see
[03:12:43.480 --> 03:12:48.720]  what government is doing and the people's business should be private amazing what
[03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:51.960]  is your concern because I know you're really on this issue at the Capitol I
[03:12:51.960 --> 03:12:55.480]  mean that's why I like it always see popping up you're at the lead fighting
[03:12:55.480 --> 03:13:00.720]  this tyranny and they're trying to now just label people to take our rights
[03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:05.080]  away how do you think they're going to come at us next time well just like we're
[03:13:05.080 --> 03:13:08.960]  talking about with the Tau Hall meeting you have a situation where a young man
[03:13:08.960 --> 03:13:13.960]  was at the Virginia Tech shooting and the guy walks in you know the madman
[03:13:13.960 --> 03:13:20.520]  walks into the room and starts shooting well he didn't get shot so he picks up
[03:13:20.520 --> 03:13:25.280]  the only weapon that he had which was his cell phone he dials 911 on his cell
[03:13:25.280 --> 03:13:29.200]  phone the shooter leaves the room goes into a different room shoots people in
[03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:34.800]  that room and he's on the phone for about 20 minutes with the 911 operator
[03:13:34.800 --> 03:13:39.080]  the shooter comes back into the room starts shooting again only thing he could
[03:13:39.080 --> 03:13:43.320]  do is turn around and run so he gets shot in the rear trying to run from the
[03:13:43.320 --> 03:13:48.800]  shooter as he goes down a girl next to him grabs a grab his phone and talk to
[03:13:48.800 --> 03:13:52.480]  the 911 operator for quite a while shooting leaves the room goes out the
[03:13:52.480 --> 03:13:57.360]  room shooter comes back to the back to the room continues shooting and they
[03:13:57.360 --> 03:14:00.160]  will sit here and they will tell you that they don't think that a concealed
[03:14:00.160 --> 03:14:03.040]  hang-on license holder would have you know been able to do anything about that
[03:14:03.040 --> 03:14:06.120]  situation well I just grimaced involuntarily when you were telling
[03:14:06.120 --> 03:14:09.280]  that story I remember covering at the time and I I'm not just saying this
[03:14:09.280 --> 03:14:12.760]  because I've been situation people have knives and stuff and I went after them
[03:14:12.760 --> 03:14:17.160]  it but it's actually a fear thing I like a tack instead of run it just it's
[03:14:17.160 --> 03:14:21.520]  what I do and because that feels a lot better that I can't do the other thing
[03:14:21.520 --> 03:14:26.720]  it's actually a problem I have and I was imagining if I was that guy I know and
[03:14:26.720 --> 03:14:30.160]  I because I know about guns if I see the guy turn his back or he's around the
[03:14:30.160 --> 03:14:34.240]  corner I would have gone and hidden there I would have grabbed a desk and you
[03:14:34.240 --> 03:14:37.880]  know ran towards even and that happens a lot of times now where people do tackle
[03:14:37.880 --> 03:14:42.280]  shooters correct and I just can't imagine people getting in fetal positions to be
[03:14:42.280 --> 03:14:45.800]  killed I mean if you're gonna kill me anyways I'm gonna fight you right I mean
[03:14:45.800 --> 03:14:48.000]  what would you have done if you were there I mean I know you're not trying
[03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:51.680]  to say your macho guy your pear tripper and stuff I mean I think most Texans I
[03:14:51.680 --> 03:14:55.640]  know well even when you see if somebody pulls a gun out people try to stomp them
[03:14:55.640 --> 03:14:59.240]  right Susanna Hupp's dad tried to go stop the guy and rushed him and got shot
[03:14:59.240 --> 03:15:03.880]  exactly at the loopies why not have them have guns exactly we need to empower
[03:15:03.880 --> 03:15:07.440]  the people the people need to be empowered the people in Chicago need to
[03:15:07.440 --> 03:15:10.240]  be empowered they don't need law enforcement because law enforcement's
[03:15:10.240 --> 03:15:13.280]  not doing it the more they hire it doesn't do anything exactly empower the
[03:15:13.280 --> 03:15:16.320]  people and return that power back to the people so the people can protect
[03:15:16.320 --> 03:15:21.840]  themselves let me look at Chicago where only the government has guns and the
[03:15:21.840 --> 03:15:25.520]  criminals it's it's it's a it's hellish and it's one mile from the
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:29.760]  president's residence one mile that's where the majority of that crime takes
[03:15:29.760 --> 03:15:34.640]  place was it 530 something people a year shot there right killed killed killed
[03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:38.360]  killed and that's something like 3,000 shot I mean that is so what you have a
[03:15:38.360 --> 03:15:42.240]  situation of the criminals having the guns and your law-abiding citizens are
[03:15:42.240 --> 03:15:46.040]  at home cowering down hiding because they can't go and purchase that for that
[03:15:46.040 --> 03:15:49.240]  firearm to protect themselves and I think of Chicago I've been there a lot of
[03:15:49.240 --> 03:15:53.560]  family lives up there it's a nice city right I mean it's a famous city why have
[03:15:53.560 --> 03:15:56.640]  they allowed this and that is the last state that does not have a concealed
[03:15:56.640 --> 03:15:59.280]  hanging license program I know they're working on something right now and
[03:15:59.280 --> 03:16:02.400]  hopefully they will come up with something Dallas I mean I remember when
[03:16:02.400 --> 03:16:06.320]  they first put the concealed carry and it was two days after it had gone in
[03:16:06.320 --> 03:16:10.480]  people that had been able to do the the the program in the first you know we're
[03:16:10.480 --> 03:16:14.200]  issued a few months into it there was a carjacking that were happening all the
[03:16:14.200 --> 03:16:16.960]  time I grew up in Dallas it was dangerous right there was a carjacking on
[03:16:16.960 --> 03:16:20.960]  Central Expressway during stop-and-go traffic and a guy was dragging a car
[03:16:20.960 --> 03:16:25.680]  and a guy stepped out behind and shot the guy dead and and then immediately the
[03:16:25.680 --> 03:16:29.120]  carjackings just stopped because now there were guns right and we need to
[03:16:29.120 --> 03:16:31.840]  learn something from Texas the rest of the country can actually take this
[03:16:31.840 --> 03:16:35.240]  message where you know we started our concealed hanging license program here
[03:16:35.240 --> 03:16:40.200]  in Texas back in 1995 our crime actually dropped dramatically here in the
[03:16:40.200 --> 03:16:46.080]  state of 20 25% yes and you have your stats for the year of 2011 you have
[03:16:46.080 --> 03:16:51.720]  over 63,000 people were convicted of crimes in the year 2011 out of that
[03:16:51.720 --> 03:16:56.640]  63,000 only 120 were CHO holders you know so the program that we have here
[03:16:56.640 --> 03:17:00.840]  actually works for us our CHO holders are law-abiding citizens they're not the
[03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:03.440]  people that are gonna well let's just say it statistically they're even better
[03:17:03.440 --> 03:17:07.000]  than the police because you've got psychos and criminals not all of them the
[03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:11.120]  20% or so they estimate criminology that's a fact we want to become cops they
[03:17:11.120 --> 03:17:14.160]  want to do it so they can get away with crime be a better criminal you don't
[03:17:14.160 --> 03:17:17.360]  have that with CHL because the criminals is carrying on anyways they like
[03:17:17.360 --> 03:17:20.680]  committing the crime right why go all through that trouble of getting a
[03:17:20.680 --> 03:17:23.520]  license doing the background check paying all the fees just to commit a
[03:17:23.520 --> 03:17:26.680]  crime when you can just go and grab the gun and commit the crime show the CHL
[03:17:26.680 --> 03:17:30.440]  are the best people yes and they've they've been looking for problems and
[03:17:30.440 --> 03:17:33.480]  they just can't find hands because CHO holders have been vetted and these
[03:17:33.480 --> 03:17:36.480]  people want to do the right thing and in and protect themselves and their
[03:17:36.480 --> 03:17:42.960]  family well it just shows their people common sense right absolutely
[03:17:42.960 --> 03:17:47.760]  absolutely what is for people that don't know in Texas but also another is
[03:17:47.760 --> 03:17:51.840]  what is the current law on carrying loaded firearms in your vehicle well in
[03:17:51.840 --> 03:17:55.160]  the state of Texas you can have a loaded handgun in your vehicle without a
[03:17:55.160 --> 03:17:59.840]  license it must be concealed in a vehicle now prior to 2007 you had to be
[03:17:59.840 --> 03:18:05.720]  traveling from one county to another well after that 2007 everyone became you
[03:18:05.720 --> 03:18:09.480]  everyone's traveling so it became legal to have a loaded handgun in your
[03:18:09.480 --> 03:18:11.880]  vehicle it must be concealed in the vehicle as long as you're not committing
[03:18:11.880 --> 03:18:15.800]  a crime anything greater than a class C misdemeanor that's a ordinance really
[03:18:15.800 --> 03:18:21.440]  regulating traffic or if the gun is not openly it's not open the problem is you
[03:18:21.440 --> 03:18:24.960]  got to get out of your car correct once you get out of that vehicle unless you're
[03:18:24.960 --> 03:18:31.200]  traveling to and from your home then you must have a CHL I tell you it's just
[03:18:31.200 --> 03:18:33.960]  even pointless even have laws on this the criminals aren't gonna fall in anything
[03:18:33.960 --> 03:18:38.600]  anyways I mean it's just pointless sign well me personally I've never had time
[03:18:38.600 --> 03:18:41.800]  to go to the concealed carry but I think I'm gonna take it from you and and it's
[03:18:41.800 --> 03:18:46.320]  and you know my wife obviously knows the law she's a good shot able to do it she
[03:18:46.320 --> 03:18:49.920]  hasn't had time to go do it we've got to go do it myself of all people back
[03:18:49.920 --> 03:18:53.920]  before that law I just carried a rifle in my car but then with children when
[03:18:53.920 --> 03:18:56.920]  you're putting them in the car I put it in the trunk or if I was getting death
[03:18:56.920 --> 03:19:00.080]  threats you know then I put the shotgun up the front with me but that was only a
[03:19:00.080 --> 03:19:03.200]  few times when I had people actually after me I want to get into those whole
[03:19:03.200 --> 03:19:06.880]  stories here on air but the point is I go to like places don't even have
[03:19:06.880 --> 03:19:09.760]  security I kind of don't worry about it but it's almost like I have a
[03:19:09.760 --> 03:19:13.600]  responsibility to go get a concealed carry just to be there in case I see a
[03:19:13.600 --> 03:19:17.720]  crime being committed it's almost like a dereliction of a citizen's duty to not
[03:19:17.720 --> 03:19:21.400]  be armed right you need to be armed you need to know what the laws are know what
[03:19:21.400 --> 03:19:25.280]  you can what you can you cannot do to keep yourself and your family out of
[03:19:25.280 --> 03:19:29.240]  trouble and to keep them safe I want to come back and take phone calls all over

[03:24:35.720 --> 03:24:37.920]  everybody I'm going to you right now that we're gonna get more into the second
[03:24:37.920 --> 03:24:42.000]  amendment the second amendment calls on the balance of the hour with the
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:46.720]  proprietor of central texasgunworks.com he owns a gun shop a gun range a
[03:24:46.720 --> 03:24:50.760]  gunsmith's shop it's it's very popular everybody I know tends to use it here in
[03:24:50.760 --> 03:24:54.240]  South Austin and then he's out there politically fighting for your freedom
[03:24:54.240 --> 03:24:58.760]  that's what we need to see from gun shop owners not oh I'm not political the ATF
[03:24:58.760 --> 03:25:01.480]  will come harass me I'm gonna talk to you about that coming up but right now
[03:25:01.480 --> 03:25:05.800]  let's talk to mouse link there's been a real trooper holding mouse like you you
[03:25:05.800 --> 03:25:11.000]  had a question go ahead well given the current conversation you guys are
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:14.440]  having about guns the second amendment I thought we could segue from the
[03:25:14.440 --> 03:25:19.920]  features of stuff that we were talking about earlier into 3d printing I think
[03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:23.160]  I was the first guy to bring up this issue on your program talking to Mike
[03:25:23.160 --> 03:25:28.080]  Adams a few some months ago and I just wondered if your guest had anything to
[03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:32.880]  say on that subject oh yes absolutely I know Cody Wilson really well I've
[03:25:32.880 --> 03:25:37.280]  actually I've gone to eat lunch and dinner with Cody quite a few times and
[03:25:37.280 --> 03:25:43.600]  we sit back and we talk about the 3d printing and how it's not it's not just
[03:25:43.600 --> 03:25:48.120]  about the 3d printer gun it's about the access to that machine and for the
[03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:52.800]  people being able to do whatever they want in their home because that is your
[03:25:52.800 --> 03:25:56.440]  home and that is your property the federal government the government needs
[03:25:56.440 --> 03:26:00.960]  to keep up with technology well they're using the international lines but he's
[03:26:00.960 --> 03:26:05.680]  in Texas he's be able to do whatever he wants with a liberator gun a 380 that
[03:26:05.680 --> 03:26:10.800]  they dropped over France to resist I mean what people can't have in their own
[03:26:10.800 --> 03:26:14.400]  home and build a 380 single shot so if you want to sit at home and build
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:17.960]  whatever you know if you want to build something to but anybody could build a
[03:26:17.960 --> 03:26:21.840]  gun that knows basic metallurgy yeah yeah and then their concern is about it
[03:26:21.840 --> 03:26:25.360]  getting through the metal detectors well you know what I guess they need to step
[03:26:25.360 --> 03:26:30.200]  up their efforts on technology to keep up with you know just like you know you
[03:26:30.200 --> 03:26:33.200]  have your Facebook you have your online things that the government's got to keep
[03:26:33.200 --> 03:26:35.840]  up with what's going on and so they're gonna have to keep up with the 3d
[03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:39.640]  printing as well well the answer is if somebody sticks one through the pilots
[03:26:39.640 --> 03:26:43.320]  are armed you're gonna trust them to fly this plane but not have a gun right
[03:26:43.320 --> 03:26:47.480]  right well you know there's there's no way you can legislate crazy absolutely
[03:26:47.480 --> 03:26:51.520]  a mouse link thank you for calling good to hear from you Melinda in Florida
[03:26:51.520 --> 03:26:56.400]  thank you for holding you're a trooper welcome oh thank you so much Alex for
[03:26:56.400 --> 03:26:58.760]  taking my call I had called on a different subject but I'm gonna talk
[03:26:58.760 --> 03:27:01.680]  about what you're talking now no bring up your immigration thing you're polite
[03:27:01.680 --> 03:27:05.960]  you get into the gun thing after bring up the immigration well I called about an
[03:27:05.960 --> 03:27:09.660]  hour or so ago about the immigration thing in terms of the illegal
[03:27:09.660 --> 03:27:13.920]  immigrants that come into Southern California I'm originally from Southern
[03:27:13.920 --> 03:27:17.080]  California born and raised the neighborhoods that I was raised in were
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:22.720]  you know American mostly ethically black because that's what I am over the
[03:27:22.720 --> 03:27:26.920]  course of 20 30 years those neighborhoods are now gone we've been
[03:27:26.920 --> 03:27:33.040]  chased out and now we are getting racist attacks by certain Latino Americans who
[03:27:33.040 --> 03:27:37.120]  do not like African Americans and they're killing us and that actually came
[03:27:37.120 --> 03:27:41.360]  out that actually came out even in mainstream news that you're having like
[03:27:41.360 --> 03:27:48.320]  15 20 30 to 1 the Hispanic gangs killing blackbirds or my otters is the term and
[03:27:48.320 --> 03:27:52.400]  again all the Hispanics I know aren't like that but it is an issue that that
[03:27:52.400 --> 03:27:56.200]  that in Latin America things are based on gangs killing each other Latin
[03:27:56.200 --> 03:28:00.320]  killing Latin and and if America doesn't have a gang culture on liberty and
[03:28:00.320 --> 03:28:04.280]  freedom and justice it's like we don't have an immune system politically and
[03:28:04.280 --> 03:28:08.000]  then groups come in that are gang oriented and it's politically incorrect
[03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:12.980]  to say anything about it that is a big issue and so and and then government
[03:28:12.980 --> 03:28:17.040]  also coming in and put everybody on welfare has destroyed congruent
[03:28:17.040 --> 03:28:20.720]  communities I mean what was it like to see this happen in Southern California
[03:28:20.720 --> 03:28:26.640]  it's a huge issue Alex I've been speaking talking to people in my area to
[03:28:26.640 --> 03:28:30.440]  the point where I went to college graduated trained actually to be a
[03:28:30.440 --> 03:28:34.280]  teacher I decided not to be a teacher because I saw what was going to be the
[03:28:34.280 --> 03:28:38.760]  blueprint on the wall and I had my own children to take care of I'm a homeschool
[03:28:38.760 --> 03:28:44.360]  mom and homeschooling for well over 20 20 years and I have educated and talked
[03:28:44.360 --> 03:28:48.440]  to other moms I don't care what race they are Hispanic whoever they are to get
[03:28:48.440 --> 03:28:52.640]  their children out of the the indoctrinated schools here that want to
[03:28:52.640 --> 03:28:56.720]  dumb them down and don't want to teach them anything and pertains to how to
[03:28:56.720 --> 03:29:02.080]  just live and be human and pertains to which our guess is talking about my
[03:29:02.080 --> 03:29:06.640]  sons have been raised because they're homeschooled to protect humanity you are
[03:29:06.640 --> 03:29:11.440]  you my sons are out for the good they are out for the good guy if someone is
[03:29:11.440 --> 03:29:15.160]  being assaulted somebody's being hurted in their bad they're the bad guy it's
[03:29:15.160 --> 03:29:19.320]  not about race it's not about color it's not about anything if you are a human
[03:29:19.320 --> 03:29:24.200]  being exactly but the system the system does use it from every angle and it
[03:29:24.200 --> 03:29:29.200]  it's a nightmare situation what was your comment on guns my comment on guns is
[03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:34.680]  that as a female who is a very small-sized female and afford to be
[03:29:34.680 --> 03:29:38.400]  tussling with men and other people yeah stay there I want to come back to you

[03:34:09.360 --> 03:34:12.320]  works dot com and find out about what he's doing it's a great website a lot of
[03:34:12.320 --> 03:34:16.240]  pro second women for there and if you're in central Texas he's not a sponsor but
[03:34:16.240 --> 03:34:21.360]  I'm plugging it go in there we're gonna go back to this lady I'm all into to
[03:34:21.360 --> 03:34:24.960]  finish her story and get your take on that in a moment but you were telling me
[03:34:24.960 --> 03:34:30.960]  during the break your real passion is getting women armed and trained so they
[03:34:30.960 --> 03:34:34.880]  can protect themselves and equalize and that is an incredible thing think about
[03:34:34.880 --> 03:34:39.440]  the civil rights the human rights the God-given right of self-defense and
[03:34:39.440 --> 03:34:46.240]  empowering women who for thousands of years have been dominated by bad men
[03:34:46.240 --> 03:34:49.920]  now you're empowering them I would think Gloria Steinem and all these so-called
[03:34:49.920 --> 03:34:54.000]  liberals would be screaming from the rooftops to arm women yeah I applaud
[03:34:54.000 --> 03:34:58.280]  Melinda because it's about empowering women to protect themselves and making
[03:34:58.280 --> 03:35:03.880]  it that equalizer when you're walking from that building going to your vehicle
[03:35:03.880 --> 03:35:09.200]  or whatever it is you have tools within your means to protect yourself because
[03:35:09.200 --> 03:35:14.360]  you cannot have that law enforcement officer there to help you at all yeah
[03:35:14.360 --> 03:35:19.360]  and it's just common sense isn't it yes sir yes sir and and and I tell you I
[03:35:19.360 --> 03:35:23.560]  love having the women come to our class at Central Texas gun works because the
[03:35:23.560 --> 03:35:28.160]  women they actually they listen and they want to do the right thing and they
[03:35:28.160 --> 03:35:32.400]  actually come out shooting a lot better than the men what do you think's going
[03:35:32.400 --> 03:35:36.840]  to end up happening long term because you're you seem like a pretty smart
[03:35:36.840 --> 03:35:40.840]  guy who's got his ear to the ground what's your gut on whether they'll be
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:44.200]  successful or not because when they wanted to get our guns they were
[03:35:44.200 --> 03:35:46.920]  demonizing the second amendment now that they've lost for now they're like we
[03:35:46.920 --> 03:35:50.000]  never wanted your guns so we all go back to sleep but I don't see that
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:54.200]  happening but I don't see them stopping so it's like two freight trains speeding
[03:35:54.200 --> 03:35:57.440]  down the track towards each other what do you think's gonna happen I think after
[03:35:57.440 --> 03:36:02.000]  the midterm elections and they're gonna actually come back again a second time
[03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:05.120]  a second win because this president you know the current administration is not
[03:36:05.120 --> 03:36:11.000]  gonna let this go they took a big hit and he's he made a promise that to the
[03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:15.200]  Democratic Party that he was gonna do something about you know guns and so
[03:36:15.200 --> 03:36:19.040]  he's gonna he's gonna come after them he's definitely gonna come out why do
[03:36:19.040 --> 03:36:23.840]  you think they want our guns it's about control it's about control and
[03:36:23.840 --> 03:36:28.040]  controlling individuals it really needs to be about safety and they've lost that
[03:36:28.040 --> 03:36:33.400]  that that target you know that I on on the picture there plug central texas
[03:36:33.400 --> 03:36:37.460]  gunworks.com if you know let's say you're a woman out there or a man or
[03:36:37.460 --> 03:36:41.960]  somebody who hasn't been around guns you believe all the stuff from Hollywood
[03:36:41.960 --> 03:36:46.640]  and mystifying it how do you demystify it how does somebody come in and take a
[03:36:46.640 --> 03:36:50.480]  basic gun safety class from you well we actually focus on training you know we
[03:36:50.480 --> 03:36:55.280]  don't focus on you know mainly selling the guns themselves I want a person to
[03:36:55.280 --> 03:36:58.440]  come in they want to learn safety they want to have learn how to keep their
[03:36:58.440 --> 03:37:02.880]  family safe they want to learn that you know we have a penal code 46.13 that
[03:37:02.880 --> 03:37:06.680]  says that if you allow your your child to get access to a firearm you know in
[03:37:06.680 --> 03:37:09.200]  the state of Texas they're gonna come after you and charge you with the crime
[03:37:09.200 --> 03:37:13.760]  so we focus on that training and teaching them about the laws making sure
[03:37:13.760 --> 03:37:17.240]  they're safe making sure their kids safe because you don't want your son
[03:37:17.240 --> 03:37:21.000]  actually going and and sitting with your neighbor son you know we don't want
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:24.200]  dumb and dumber getting together learning gun safety I want them learning
[03:37:24.200 --> 03:37:27.120]  that in the concealed in in our beginning hang-on course or I can still
[03:37:27.120 --> 03:37:30.560]  hang-on course or advanced pistol core and then once you get that concealed
[03:37:30.560 --> 03:37:33.960]  hang-on license and you're ready to carry to protect yourself and your family
[03:37:33.960 --> 03:37:36.880]  it's about how are you gonna deploy that firearm how are you gonna get out your
[03:37:36.880 --> 03:37:40.760]  concealed carry position where you're a lady and you're carrying inside your
[03:37:40.760 --> 03:37:44.480]  purse you know how are you gonna get that gun out to protect yourself if needs
[03:37:44.480 --> 03:37:48.400]  be because you may only have four seconds to draw that firearm and so those
[03:37:48.400 --> 03:37:52.240]  are some of the things that we you know we go over and we we teach you as you
[03:37:52.240 --> 03:37:55.280]  can always tell when women are carrying one because they'll put their purse
[03:37:55.280 --> 03:38:00.000]  around kind on the front and they walk with confidence and you don't want to
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:02.920]  mess with that person you know and I give him some pepper spray I make sure
[03:38:02.920 --> 03:38:06.880]  that every female that attends our course get some free pepper spray so I'll
[03:38:06.880 --> 03:38:10.360]  give him that because I say you know if something happens you have some pepper
[03:38:10.360 --> 03:38:13.000]  spray you get a stun gun or something like that and something happens you're
[03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:15.520]  getting a good shot in the face of that pepper spray that gives you a couple
[03:38:15.520 --> 03:38:18.880]  seconds to get to your gun that gives you a couple seconds to run away you
[03:38:18.880 --> 03:38:22.480]  know and protect yourself well it's that threat continuum right where you
[03:38:22.480 --> 03:38:25.200]  don't want to just cuz somebody runs up and says something you shoot them right
[03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:28.520]  no it's like once they start coming at you then it's the pepper spray and they
[03:38:28.520 --> 03:38:31.880]  keep coming that's right getting a good shot of pepper spray in the face like I
[03:38:31.880 --> 03:38:34.440]  said it gives you a couple seconds to run away or gives you a couple seconds to
[03:38:34.440 --> 03:38:37.560]  get to your gun well what's amazed me is I've heard you on local radio seen you
[03:38:37.560 --> 03:38:41.680]  on TV some of our reporters out the gun rallies have interviewed you a jacari
[03:38:41.680 --> 03:38:45.880]  and others but I just keep hearing people talk about central Texas gunworks
[03:38:45.880 --> 03:38:49.360]  it's like Weldon goes yeah you know you don't think you're really cleaning these
[03:38:49.360 --> 03:38:52.480]  guns good boss let me take them to a great gunsmith I know and then I didn't
[03:38:52.480 --> 03:38:55.960]  even realize that was you till you told me and then I heard other people talking
[03:38:55.960 --> 03:39:02.160]  about central Texas gunworks you guys must be pretty busy yes we stay pretty
[03:39:02.160 --> 03:39:07.320]  busy because we focus on training and customer service you know you you know
[03:39:07.320 --> 03:39:10.960]  people are tied a walk into that gun store and they act arrogant like you
[03:39:10.960 --> 03:39:14.040]  don't know anything correct and feeling uncomfortable we actually you know I
[03:39:14.040 --> 03:39:17.840]  have females that work for us I what is it about service places that are selling
[03:39:17.840 --> 03:39:21.440]  things that don't know how to give people hospitality I don't know what that is
[03:39:21.440 --> 03:39:25.640]  yeah and so you know want to give them that good customer service I have a
[03:39:25.640 --> 03:39:29.440]  wide range of people that work for me you know like I said I've military
[03:39:29.440 --> 03:39:34.960]  veterans I have females you know and then we were nice good and close knit
[03:39:34.960 --> 03:39:38.680]  family and we believe in taking care of people and actually teaching them safety
[03:39:38.680 --> 03:39:43.600]  and the laws well well said very exciting let's go back to Melinda in
[03:39:43.600 --> 03:39:48.640]  Florida again we commend you for you know having firearms protecting yourself
[03:39:48.640 --> 03:39:51.680]  that's awesome did you have anything else you wanted to add on that subject
[03:39:51.680 --> 03:39:55.960]  well absolutely I just want to commend what your guest has said and I would love
[03:39:55.960 --> 03:39:59.400]  to train under him just to know what to do the right thing to protect my family
[03:39:59.400 --> 03:40:05.080]  and not only my family but my neighbors I believe that as a female being with our
[03:40:05.080 --> 03:40:08.600]  small factor and our small size and the fact that we have groceries and kids and
[03:40:08.600 --> 03:40:11.720]  babies we really don't have a lot of time to be fighting other men and other
[03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:16.160]  bad guys and we need to be able to have the drop or any type of sort of
[03:40:16.160 --> 03:40:20.760]  advantage that we have to be able to get the bad guys off of us exactly they
[03:40:20.760 --> 03:40:25.880]  may be private citizen or government tearing absolutely I also train my
[03:40:25.880 --> 03:40:30.240]  daughters to you know you got to do what you got to do the females of the
[03:40:30.240 --> 03:40:35.360]  females no matter what tend to get raped and to have that happen to even one of
[03:40:35.360 --> 03:40:39.440]  my daughters would kill me certainly Alex with your with your daughters you
[03:40:39.440 --> 03:40:43.080]  would feel the same that I feel that it was absolutely ripped my heart out I
[03:40:43.080 --> 03:40:47.920]  can't take it so I tell my daughters you know you you got to do what you got to
[03:40:47.920 --> 03:40:51.640]  do to protect yourself absolutely well it's key to go out and take a gun safety
[03:40:51.640 --> 03:40:55.240]  course and then get demystified and then store it properly and that's just the
[03:40:55.240 --> 03:41:00.200]  way to go I appreciate you calling in you know my issue is this I'm so busy that
[03:41:00.200 --> 03:41:05.440]  I grew up around guns grew up around basic safety four years old you you put
[03:41:05.440 --> 03:41:10.800]  some and there's different ways to do it but you go out to grandpa's house out
[03:41:10.800 --> 03:41:14.960]  at the farm and they shoot a watermelon and say now you see this gun in the toy
[03:41:14.960 --> 03:41:19.840]  you see what it just did and then they take you out and bird season and shoot
[03:41:19.840 --> 03:41:23.400]  some birds it's quail dove and say you see what that did to a bird is when
[03:41:23.400 --> 03:41:26.960]  you're four years old and then they set you down with a Folgers coffee can I
[03:41:26.960 --> 03:41:30.720]  can't tell you how many people been trying the same way with a 410 and you
[03:41:30.720 --> 03:41:35.800]  shoot it and then you're taught now you don't touch this unless you're told you
[03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:38.880]  can touch it and then you're taught the basic safety and you're taken out five
[03:41:38.880 --> 03:41:42.240]  six seven times a year because I lived in the city I always love to go shooting
[03:41:42.240 --> 03:41:47.320]  and by the time you're 11 or 12 years old I was shooting bullseye free hand
[03:41:47.320 --> 03:41:53.360]  with a 243 at 300 yards and that's an example of just basic marksman training
[03:41:53.360 --> 03:41:57.160]  that made Americans in warfare feared all over the world and it's good to see
[03:41:57.160 --> 03:42:01.840]  that culture coming back but I'll be honest with you I keep my guns locked up
[03:42:01.840 --> 03:42:06.680]  in a gun safe and I've got some instant access pistol safes and my nine-year-old
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:10.600]  and ten-year-old are good shots now and they know you just don't touch guns and
[03:42:10.600 --> 03:42:13.560]  even the BB guns you know we're in the garage in a locked up area they get
[03:42:13.560 --> 03:42:16.240]  permission to get those out and then they're not allowed to really use them
[03:42:16.240 --> 03:42:18.680]  where other kids come over because I don't know how they're gonna act around
[03:42:18.680 --> 03:42:24.320]  them and that's my basic safety but I should probably even do a better job of
[03:42:24.320 --> 03:42:29.400]  that and explain to me the penal code on children and guns yeah you have a penal
[03:42:29.400 --> 03:42:33.520]  code section 46 dot 13 that's in Texas but it varies right it does vary from
[03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:37.560]  state to state but the way it works is if your child is access to a firearm
[03:42:37.560 --> 03:42:40.640]  the ones injured is not discharged you're gonna get off easy you get charged
[03:42:40.640 --> 03:42:45.000]  with a class C misdemeanor but if your child gets access to a firearm is
[03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:48.760]  discharged someone's injured you're gonna get charged with a class a misdemeanor
[03:42:48.760 --> 03:42:53.440]  if your child gets access to your firearm and kills himself shoots himself
[03:42:53.440 --> 03:42:57.520]  or kills another one of your kids we would give you the state of Texas will
[03:42:57.520 --> 03:43:00.400]  give you seven days to go and bury your child before they come in arrest you and
[03:43:00.400 --> 03:43:04.000]  charge you with the class a and what you just touched on right now is parenting
[03:43:04.000 --> 03:43:07.280]  you know what a concept you know raising your kids I remember when I was a
[03:43:07.280 --> 03:43:11.760]  little kid my mother would say to me I you better be in the house before the
[03:43:11.760 --> 03:43:16.040]  the the Sun goes down don't let you know don't let your shadow catch you in it
[03:43:16.040 --> 03:43:20.680]  and she's not talking about the the street lights it's about parenting right
[03:43:20.680 --> 03:43:26.000]  now you have your babies raising babies and that's gonna be a part of the
[03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:31.240]  problem if we people focus on parent parenting and raising their children then
[03:43:31.240 --> 03:43:35.200]  we're gonna have some of these other issues that take place and now the
[03:43:35.200 --> 03:43:38.360]  state's coming in saying don't worry about parenting we'll do it they do an
[03:43:38.360 --> 03:43:41.760]  even worse job right I mean I'm really worried about society
[03:43:41.760 --> 03:43:46.520]  degenerating and government wants us all to live like in New York or Chicago in
[03:43:46.520 --> 03:43:52.960]  these crime capitals it's so sad also they can dominate us and use the crime
[03:43:52.960 --> 03:43:57.880]  wave as an excuse to take over even more let's talk to Teresa in North
[03:43:57.880 --> 03:44:00.800]  Carolina you're on the air
[03:44:00.800 --> 03:44:13.800]  Hi I just have a simple question for you I saw on a news feed today on Facebook and I looked at the article but I had to get on the road really fast it didn't seem to be a stoof article or anything
[03:44:13.800 --> 03:44:19.360]  they said that the government had ordered 30,000 guillotine is that true and why
[03:44:19.360 --> 03:44:23.600]  would the government order 30,000 guillotine well the United States is not
[03:44:23.600 --> 03:44:28.400]  really historically used the guillotine an execution they've used hanging the
[03:44:28.400 --> 03:44:33.160]  gas chamber lethal injection electric chair things like that this is a and I'm
[03:44:33.160 --> 03:44:36.680]  glad you called in about this this is a perennial thing I've heard for 18 years
[03:44:36.680 --> 03:44:41.560]  on air it's a rumor that got out that a truck dumped over it's always in Kansas
[03:44:41.560 --> 03:44:45.920]  or Texas or New York and it was it was martial law signs and guillotines and
[03:44:45.920 --> 03:44:50.320]  it's this whole thing of the anti-crisis gonna use guillotines to chop
[03:44:50.320 --> 03:44:55.360]  Christians heads off and I'm maybe that's gonna happen someday my point is
[03:44:55.360 --> 03:44:59.680]  is it's an urban legend just like this national stabilization the Sarah act
[03:44:59.680 --> 03:45:04.320]  that's another made-up thing I mean there are good people in government and
[03:45:04.320 --> 03:45:08.200]  there are white hats as they call them but still that doesn't it's just one of
[03:45:08.200 --> 03:45:12.560]  these urban legends that is a true urban legend what they're buying is 2
[03:45:12.560 --> 03:45:16.520]  billion hollow point rounds and other rounds and 7,000 armored vehicles and
[03:45:16.520 --> 03:45:19.760]  anti-mine vehicles and they're trained to take on gun owners conservatives
[03:45:19.760 --> 03:45:23.000]  libertarians and they're trying as best they can to divide us along race
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:26.000]  religion and everything else so the government can play the part of the
[03:45:26.000 --> 03:45:30.800]  referee and they're trying to get all sorts of just religious war race war
[03:45:30.800 --> 03:45:36.880]  social economic infighting while these big megabanks drain the country offshore
[03:45:36.880 --> 03:45:43.360]  so that's their goal does it answer your question Teresa yeah that answer my
[03:45:43.360 --> 03:45:46.880]  question thank you very much thank you God bless and don't feel bad that you
[03:45:46.880 --> 03:45:50.360]  called in about an urban legend okay and it doesn't mean I'm the final say on
[03:45:50.360 --> 03:45:55.920]  that but that's something I can officially say to be clear I'm saying
[03:45:55.920 --> 03:46:00.360]  I'm not the final say on everything okay so don't just believe me but on that I
[03:46:00.360 --> 03:46:04.160]  can say that's definitive this whole guillotine thing and people are like
[03:46:04.160 --> 03:46:09.200]  you're covering up the guillotines show me the proof Frank in New York you're
[03:46:09.200 --> 03:46:13.880]  on the air thanks for holding hi Alex there's actually interesting c-span
[03:46:13.880 --> 03:46:19.480]  video which aired on c-span 1991 there was Jay Rockefeller's at a roast of
[03:46:19.480 --> 03:46:23.200]  Pappy Ken actually I'm looking at it actually in the audience in the crowd
[03:46:23.200 --> 03:46:27.980]  and and Jay Rockefeller was joking about the trial commission and
[03:46:27.980 --> 03:46:32.000]  Bilderberg and the videos on YouTube just type Rockefeller roast into YouTube
[03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:35.120]  and it comes up like a seven-minute I want to play that Rockefeller roast or
[03:46:35.120 --> 03:46:38.920]  is it Buchanan roast just a Rockefeller roast comes up to six me you'll find it
[03:46:38.920 --> 03:46:43.400]  it's a six-minute video I'll play like a little bit right now here it's
[03:46:43.400 --> 03:46:48.040]  pretty bizarre it's been very bizarre he says the most bizarre he confesses the
[03:46:48.040 --> 03:46:51.680]  New World Order he says about the night did not if you looked up to
[03:46:51.680 --> 03:46:55.720]  Bilderberg in 1991 you could hardly find anything back in the day it was very
[03:46:55.720 --> 03:46:59.680]  difficult very few people on it and so what does mainstream feel like a little
[03:46:59.680 --> 03:47:06.120]  video right now while a playing with blocks Pat you're ten and I both had
[03:47:06.120 --> 03:47:11.320]  that experience together kids were like the ones you saw in the movie a little
[03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:17.840]  round the square blocks colored ABC line tended to be called 48th Street 49th
[03:47:17.840 --> 03:47:26.560]  Street Avenue using c-span video which aired on well they talked about that
[03:47:26.560 --> 03:47:31.120]  running for president and if he did that I would be very supportive
[03:47:31.120 --> 03:47:36.080]  hello yes very funny and I heard you turn up your computer so it was it was
[03:47:36.080 --> 03:47:39.640]  if you were delayed 30 seconds but yeah we'll find that clip went on outly news
[03:47:39.640 --> 03:47:42.000]  tonight sounds very interesting I was unaware of that
[03:47:42.000 --> 03:47:46.600]  she also says we own the politicians a presidency has a bad reputation and we
[03:47:46.600 --> 03:47:49.360]  because we all because of the elite own the pop on the presidency you know the
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:52.920]  politicians you actually said that and the in the roast of a pappy cannon in
[03:47:52.920 --> 03:47:56.920]  1991 it's so bizarre like you said it's always a see what you come in front of
[03:47:56.920 --> 03:48:00.960]  when she joined join us new order have total power he says it's very strange
[03:48:00.960 --> 03:48:04.240]  well we're gonna play that tonight that's big so much stuff's being dug up
[03:48:04.240 --> 03:48:07.920]  now and put on the web how do you think the establishment Michael's gonna get
[03:48:07.920 --> 03:48:11.760]  away with all this corruption as more and more stuff comes out hopefully the
[03:48:11.760 --> 03:48:15.840]  people will you know stay educated and actually hold them you know hold their
[03:48:15.840 --> 03:48:19.920]  feet to the fire and say hey we're not gonna take this anymore we want like I
[03:48:19.920 --> 03:48:23.440]  said the federal government to be transparent sure the federal government
[03:48:23.440 --> 03:48:28.320]  is not designed to always take care of all our problems sure you know that we
[03:48:28.320 --> 03:48:31.240]  we don't always need the federal government to we don't need big brother to
[03:48:31.240 --> 03:48:34.400]  always take care of us we need the folk you know take care of what we can take
[03:48:34.400 --> 03:48:37.960]  care of us we're gonna go to more calls sounds like an American idea how extreme
[03:48:37.960 --> 03:48:41.760]  we're gonna go to more calls here before the show ends in about 15 minutes or
[03:48:41.760 --> 03:48:46.040]  14 minutes or so but I wanted to ask you because I always intend to do this and
[03:48:46.040 --> 03:48:49.360]  I don't do it but but you're actually on my way to work in things you're actually
[03:48:49.360 --> 03:48:56.040]  in South Austin closer to where I live I live south of Austin how how fast
[03:48:56.040 --> 03:48:59.040]  could I come do the concealed carry class because I've sent off to the DPS
[03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:03.320]  before got in my packet like twice in the last decade but never went and did it
[03:49:03.320 --> 03:49:06.640]  and I've had other people up that are friends of mine that are concealed carry
[03:49:06.640 --> 03:49:09.920]  saying I'll give you a private class I'll accelerate it all whatever but I
[03:49:09.920 --> 03:49:13.600]  almost don't even want that I I want to go get the course because it's always
[03:49:13.600 --> 03:49:16.920]  good to learn if you wait until September the law is gonna change where
[03:49:16.920 --> 03:49:21.240]  it's only gonna be four hours instead of the ten hours like it is now so if you
[03:49:21.240 --> 03:49:24.200]  wait until then you'll be able to take a four-hour course do your shooting
[03:49:24.200 --> 03:49:28.920]  portion and then right now you can do it online you go online to DPS website fill
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:33.240]  out the application and pay the fee and then we'll turn in your paperwork for you
[03:49:33.240 --> 03:49:39.120]  who has the best concealed carry law in the country I think well I like Vermont
[03:49:39.120 --> 03:49:42.080]  I actually like Vermont you know why that's what I thought was the best because
[03:49:42.080 --> 03:49:44.720]  in the state of Vermont everyone can carry open your concealed without a
[03:49:44.720 --> 03:49:47.600]  license it's constitutional carry so Vermont is going to be the best state
[03:49:47.600 --> 03:49:51.760]  and again I'm not you know liking the fact that it's a law you go do this
[03:49:51.760 --> 03:49:55.440]  for concealed carry because it kind of hurts the right into a privilege but I
[03:49:55.440 --> 03:49:59.360]  also do kind of like that this much training is going in because my dad's
[03:49:59.360 --> 03:50:04.360]  done it I've read the course online it's really good I mean I think it instills
[03:50:04.360 --> 03:50:08.840]  gun culture in people and common law in people well put your trust in people
[03:50:08.840 --> 03:50:11.880]  because if you give them what you offered them a class then they will
[03:50:11.880 --> 03:50:14.680]  actually come and take a class rather than saying the government says it's
[03:50:14.680 --> 03:50:17.640]  mandatory and it's something that you have to do no I agree with that I mean I
[03:50:17.640 --> 03:50:22.520]  disagree with making you do it but it then at least it's it's good to make
[03:50:22.520 --> 03:50:25.640]  the government do something good right and it's not perfect but at least
[03:50:25.640 --> 03:50:28.360]  something good is happening out right right and people are actually learning
[03:50:28.360 --> 03:50:33.160]  the laws they actually are willing to take more classes to learn safety and
[03:50:33.160 --> 03:50:36.880]  and I've also been told that the police treat concealed carry people more
[03:50:36.880 --> 03:50:40.440]  respect oh yeah yeah you pulled that your driver's license and your concealed
[03:50:40.440 --> 03:50:43.120]  hang on license out and show it to the officer and officer knows that you've
[03:50:43.120 --> 03:50:48.720]  gone through a thorough background check absolutely I just wish the police on
[03:50:48.720 --> 03:50:51.720]  average were as good I know a lot of them really are good but I wish they were
[03:50:51.720 --> 03:50:54.760]  as good as concealed carry people on average because there's definitely bad
[03:50:54.760 --> 03:50:58.120]  ones hiding in there just ask Serpico who we're getting on soon more calls
[03:50:58.120 --> 03:51:00.720]  coming up

[03:52:01.040 --> 03:52:05.000]  hi my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:09.120]  years I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all
[03:52:09.120 --> 03:52:13.560]  night it was so hard to work because it continued all day to have the hot flashes
[03:52:13.560 --> 03:52:18.480]  from hell I was exhausted and depleted after only three weeks on one world
[03:52:18.480 --> 03:52:22.840]  weight I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again I feel energized
[03:52:22.840 --> 03:52:27.480]  and strong this is an amazing product it is a little known fact that every single
[03:52:27.480 --> 03:52:31.200]  cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its protein content as
[03:52:31.200 --> 03:52:36.000]  glutathione but due to toxicity and aging it does not could glutathione be a
[03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:40.240]  missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body if you restore the
[03:52:40.240 --> 03:52:44.040]  optimal glutathione levels in your cells especially your glands and organs then
[03:52:44.040 --> 03:52:48.000]  as a result your glands and organs work better imagine the quality of life

[03:54:22.640 --> 03:54:29.840]  Viggo Mortensen a listener of the show on the show amazing interview on a bunch
[03:54:29.840 --> 03:54:34.520]  of subjects I want to jam in a few final calls here but I think I asked a
[03:54:34.520 --> 03:54:38.080]  question before we went to break and we're gonna come back and talk about it
[03:54:38.080 --> 03:54:42.200]  and now I don't remember Michael let me ask you this briefly what is the best
[03:54:42.200 --> 03:54:46.640]  thing ever since I was a kid my dad would say you know the old pump shot gun
[03:54:46.640 --> 03:54:52.120]  just cuz for every scene by a semi-auto with like bird shot in it it was his
[03:54:52.120 --> 03:54:55.640]  idea that that was something that wouldn't wouldn't kill neighbors
[03:54:55.640 --> 03:55:00.280]  necessarily as easily if he shot at somebody in and it went out the wall
[03:55:00.280 --> 03:55:04.080]  or it wouldn't kill somebody on the other side of the wall and then he would
[03:55:04.080 --> 03:55:07.200]  also have a handgun with those what shear safety slugs the air marshals
[03:55:07.200 --> 03:55:10.840]  would use man I think it's important people to also know when you're doing
[03:55:10.840 --> 03:55:14.880]  stuff in your house and you've got a gun for self-defense what is that issue if
[03:55:14.880 --> 03:55:18.320]  there's a burglar with a gun and your kids bedrooms are down there what do you
[03:55:18.320 --> 03:55:22.400]  do anything that you're proficient in would be good to have for home
[03:55:22.400 --> 03:55:26.400]  protection but I tell people to have a plan you know just like taking a trip on
[03:55:26.400 --> 03:55:29.120]  an airplane you take a trip on an airplane they go to security plan and
[03:55:29.120 --> 03:55:31.920]  event there's an emergency we lose cabin pressure this is gonna drop down from
[03:55:31.920 --> 03:55:35.040]  the ceiling prove your mouth assist a person sitting next to you and event
[03:55:35.040 --> 03:55:38.080]  there's a water landing your seat cuz you be used to the flotation device but
[03:55:38.080 --> 03:55:40.920]  you don't want to use a 50 cow on your house no you do not but you want to have
[03:55:40.920 --> 03:55:45.560]  a plan and in my house we actually have a safe room a room that I want everyone
[03:55:45.560 --> 03:55:49.040]  to make it inside if something was to happen inside my home if the alarm goes
[03:55:49.040 --> 03:55:52.760]  off something that you know alerts us that someone's inside the home I want
[03:55:52.760 --> 03:55:55.040]  everyone to make it into the safe room because I don't want to accidentally
[03:55:55.040 --> 03:55:58.720]  shoot one of my loved ones so whatever that you're proficient with that is what
[03:55:58.720 --> 03:56:02.200]  you use if you know that's totally smart and people say we're living in fear
[03:56:02.200 --> 03:56:06.240]  no we're living in power right we're living informed we're not we're not here
[03:56:06.240 --> 03:56:10.520]  just gonna roll over right you don't want to be like those people in a
[03:56:10.520 --> 03:56:14.880]  certain part of town where someone knocked on the door at 737 45 in the
[03:56:14.880 --> 03:56:19.040]  evening and then someone opened the door and two guys went inside and robbed them
[03:56:19.040 --> 03:56:22.520]  with that with tasers and stun guns you don't want to be like that person you
[03:56:22.520 --> 03:56:27.480]  don't be like the person that worked at home at 12 noon in the afternoon on the
[03:56:27.480 --> 03:56:31.280]  second floor of his house he has his bedroom he has his office at 12 noon he
[03:56:31.280 --> 03:56:35.360]  stepped out of his in the hallway out of his office and looked to his left and
[03:56:35.360 --> 03:56:38.440]  the guy stepped out of his bedroom you don't want to be like that person you
[03:56:38.440 --> 03:56:41.440]  know and then you you know looked at the guy said what are you doing in my house
[03:56:41.440 --> 03:56:45.520]  and the guy ran to get his gun came back outside came back out on the stairwell
[03:56:45.520 --> 03:56:49.320]  there in the hallway looked downstairs and a separate guy came out of his
[03:56:49.320 --> 03:56:52.320]  kitchen you want to be that guy you want to have a plan of what you're gonna do
[03:56:52.320 --> 03:56:56.320]  to protect yourself I just I just I would have to be starving to death to
[03:56:56.320 --> 03:57:00.280]  break in somebody's house I just do not now just come knock on the door and beg
[03:57:00.280 --> 03:57:03.800]  for the food I do not get this breaking in people's houses these are these are
[03:57:03.800 --> 03:57:06.680]  the stories that we get in in my class people tell me you know some of the
[03:57:06.680 --> 03:57:10.080]  things that they've experienced so we go over security plan I give them a plan
[03:57:10.080 --> 03:57:12.280]  of what they're going to do I want to make sure they protect them and their
[03:57:12.280 --> 03:57:15.720]  family they have a safe room so that way everyone in their family is accounted
