[00:25.520 --> 00:39.520]  You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:39.520 --> 00:44.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:44.320 --> 00:45.320]  You want answers?
[00:45.320 --> 00:47.320]  Well, so does he.
[00:47.320 --> 00:51.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51.680 --> 00:59.080]  You now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59.080 --> 01:07.960]  The Mexican government for three years has been giving survival hacks, backpacks to their
[01:07.960 --> 01:13.560]  citizens to come into the United States and then act as dual citizens to undermine the
[01:13.560 --> 01:15.720]  Republic.
[01:15.720 --> 01:20.040]  Now the federal government of Mexico has announced, we'll be covering the article later
[01:20.040 --> 01:29.000]  in this hour, that they're going to be issuing GPS systems to the immigrants coming across
[01:29.000 --> 01:30.000]  the border.
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.640]  I mean this is a military invasion by every yardstick.
[01:36.640 --> 01:41.680]  And please folks, I love you to death and I appreciate everybody out there.
[01:41.680 --> 01:44.720]  Please don't call me with lots of get well remedies.
[01:44.720 --> 01:49.160]  I am announcing this obviously so you don't think I've come in here with a whole new voice.
[01:49.160 --> 01:55.320]  I had thought I had allergies the last three days, but now I got one whopper of a fever
[01:55.320 --> 02:00.600]  and I planned to go on vacation a few days, not this week but the next week, so I don't
[02:00.600 --> 02:03.240]  want to miss any more shows.
[02:03.240 --> 02:08.000]  And so I'm here today, plus I have a very important guest coming on in the second hour.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.400]  But I'm going to take, I always say this, but today you watch it's going to happen.
[02:13.400 --> 02:17.920]  I'm going to take a lot of calls in the first hour and we have a guest on in the second
[02:17.920 --> 02:24.680]  hour and I'll have wide open phones in the third hour as well.
[02:24.680 --> 02:26.280]  So that is coming up.
[02:26.280 --> 02:30.840]  The toll free number to join us, you can talk about anything you want, the Saddam execution,
[02:30.840 --> 02:37.120]  the dollar plunging, talk of attacking Iran, the police state, good things that are happening
[02:37.120 --> 02:45.760]  of the Democrats being heckled yesterday by anti-war protesters.
[02:45.760 --> 02:48.760]  The Democrats, of course, are doing the opposite of what they said they do, they're going
[02:48.760 --> 02:51.200]  to escalate the war, not de-escalate.
[02:51.200 --> 02:58.600]  In fact, I meant to send you John a clip that's up on PrisonPlanet.com, a news clip of them
[02:58.600 --> 03:05.840]  protesting and taking over the disgusting Nancy Pelosi press conference where she shot
[03:05.840 --> 03:09.480]  her mouth off about how she's the most powerful woman in America.
[03:09.480 --> 03:10.480]  I have power.
[03:10.480 --> 03:16.160]  But we don't care if women have power, folks, it's just that she's a total puppet and runs
[03:16.160 --> 03:17.320]  absolutely nothing.
[03:17.320 --> 03:23.400]  I mean, and there are a lot of powerful women, don't get me wrong, did you know over 75 percent
[03:23.400 --> 03:26.840]  of the wealth in the U.S. is held by women?
[03:26.840 --> 03:32.480]  And it goes for royalty too, because women, Taipei men tend to die at about 55 or 60.
[03:32.480 --> 03:36.600]  And women usually live six years longer than an average male, but Taipei males usually
[03:36.600 --> 03:43.200]  die about 20 years before, and these Taipei women tend to live even longer, 80, 90.
[03:43.200 --> 03:48.040]  So women do run the world, I just want to let you know, some of the top blood thirsty
[03:48.040 --> 03:53.920]  killers in the New World Order, some of their top lords are these great queen bees.
[03:53.920 --> 04:00.840]  I'm not here saying women are powerful, but Pelosi, I am the most powerful woman in America.
[04:00.840 --> 04:04.680]  Yeah, sure you are.
[04:04.680 --> 04:07.760]  You and George Bush are nothing but puppets.
[04:07.760 --> 04:15.040]  Negra Ponte, Condoleezza Rice, Jeb Bush, all of them snot-nosed, un-American trash, in
[04:15.040 --> 04:20.240]  the collusion working together against the people of the world.
[04:20.240 --> 04:22.680]  I literally have giant stacks of news here.
[04:22.680 --> 04:28.320]  Cameras going in, school bathrooms coast to coast, feds putting in microphones with cameras
[04:28.320 --> 04:34.200]  coast to coast, FEMA command centers with the CIA running them in the mainstream news,
[04:34.200 --> 04:42.560]  mainly FEMA camp articles everywhere, from Indiana to Texas to California.
[04:42.560 --> 04:46.240]  I want to talk about Saddam because it's really, the story is getting bigger and bigger
[04:46.240 --> 04:50.560]  and bigger and bigger, but I can't really do justice to it I think today with my, I
[04:50.560 --> 05:00.880]  don't know why, I just, I, I mean everybody's sick in Austin it seems, and I'm also having
[05:00.880 --> 05:05.880]  an abominable crick in my neck, I don't know why I'm saying that on air, I just, it's
[05:05.880 --> 05:12.080]  going to be an interesting broadcast today, I guess having 101.7 fever will be the truth
[05:12.080 --> 05:19.480]  serum here on here, Lord knows what I'll be saying, I may tell you what I really think
[05:19.480 --> 05:27.920]  on a few issues, the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231, huge broadcast, tell
[05:27.920 --> 05:34.440]  me about the guests that's coming up as well on the other side.
[05:34.440 --> 05:43.160]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, mighty film terror storm
[05:43.160 --> 05:47.400]  is complete, shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are
[05:47.400 --> 05:52.800]  orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[05:52.800 --> 05:57.600]  Terror storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in
[05:57.600 --> 06:00.400]  London were carried out by British intelligence.
[06:00.400 --> 06:04.120]  Terror storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program
[06:04.120 --> 06:10.480]  to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information
[06:10.480 --> 06:11.960]  and much, much more.
[06:11.960 --> 06:15.680]  Terror storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorists,
[06:15.680 --> 06:18.160]  it's an anthology of government crimes.
[06:18.160 --> 06:22.440]  Terror storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[06:34.880 --> 06:40.520]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger,
[06:40.520 --> 06:42.800]  your source for free solar electricity.
[06:42.800 --> 06:47.160]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a
[06:47.160 --> 06:49.960]  briefcase, handbag or glove compartment.
[06:49.960 --> 06:54.760]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey Lights, LED lamps as well
[06:54.760 --> 07:00.720]  as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras and PDAs when electricity
[07:00.720 --> 07:01.720]  is unavailable.
[07:01.720 --> 07:06.160]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters and rechargeable batteries provide
[07:06.160 --> 07:09.480]  for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[07:09.480 --> 07:13.960]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application and you have
[07:13.960 --> 07:14.960]  power.
[07:14.960 --> 07:19.920]  Disconnect your application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[07:19.920 --> 07:28.560]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438
[07:28.560 --> 07:35.040]  and tell them Alex Jones sent you, that's toll 3-888-803-4438.
[07:35.040 --> 07:39.480]  It's a fact, you can legally eliminate credit card debt which has been fraudulently created
[07:39.480 --> 07:40.760]  by the banks.
[07:40.760 --> 07:45.640]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own
[07:45.640 --> 07:49.680]  debt, so why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[07:49.680 --> 07:53.040]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt and unlike the
[07:53.040 --> 07:57.120]  Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[07:57.120 --> 08:02.040]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing
[08:02.040 --> 08:04.740]  calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[08:04.740 --> 08:10.520]  We also do credit restoration, join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief
[08:10.520 --> 08:13.640]  because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[08:13.640 --> 08:17.880]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[08:17.880 --> 08:26.360]  All day of Jubilee, open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[08:26.360 --> 08:31.520]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert.
[08:31.520 --> 08:34.720]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[08:34.720 --> 08:38.080]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[08:38.080 --> 08:41.720]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:41.720 --> 08:46.200]  All right, let's get it straight.
[08:46.200 --> 08:49.600]  There are checkpoints being run federally funded at the state level.
[08:49.600 --> 08:54.760]  We'll put the process of becoming federalized, centralized, colonized.
[08:54.760 --> 09:00.040]  There are checkpoints going every night in every major county of the country where the
[09:00.040 --> 09:04.680]  police just randomly want your driver's license, your registration, they snoop, they ask you
[09:04.680 --> 09:05.680]  questions.
[09:05.680 --> 09:06.680]  Where are you going?
[09:06.680 --> 09:07.680]  That's freedom.
[09:07.680 --> 09:11.920]  A free country just lights the airport, just answer their questions.
[09:11.920 --> 09:22.520]  We posted a video last night of a 19-year-old, very polite young man in Missouri and it's
[09:22.520 --> 09:23.520]  a checkpoint.
[09:23.520 --> 09:24.520]  He's sick of being stopped at the checkpoints.
[09:24.520 --> 09:25.920]  They're having a whole bunch there.
[09:25.920 --> 09:32.640]  I guess it was Kansas City and so he gives an officer the license, the ID card, the national
[09:32.640 --> 09:36.920]  ID card and he gives him the registration and the officer says, where are you going
[09:36.920 --> 09:37.920]  tonight?
[09:37.920 --> 09:38.920]  What are you doing?
[09:38.920 --> 09:39.920]  He said, you know what?
[09:39.920 --> 09:41.920]  Life with you.
[09:41.920 --> 09:43.480]  All right, get out of the car.
[09:43.480 --> 09:47.920]  It's like a 15-minute tape but I watched it last night and the cops are getting in the
[09:47.920 --> 09:52.840]  car because they don't know the young man has a camera and they're laughing about him
[09:52.840 --> 09:59.280]  and it's not like the video we put up on Jones' report a few weeks ago that I forgot to play
[09:59.280 --> 10:02.200]  on the radio.
[10:02.200 --> 10:07.880]  Maybe we'll go dig that up today and play it where one of my personal friends had a
[10:07.880 --> 10:14.480]  hidden camera in this car and the police come up and they want to search it and he says
[10:14.480 --> 10:20.040]  no and then they say get out of the car and then one of the officers talks about how he'd
[10:20.040 --> 10:27.400]  like to kill him and I think, you know, Big Brother wants to put cameras on the cars watching
[10:27.400 --> 10:28.400]  us.
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.400]  I think everybody should be hiding cameras in their cars to watch them.
[10:32.400 --> 10:33.600]  I mean that's the mentality.
[10:33.600 --> 10:35.720]  Our lives are so worthless.
[10:35.720 --> 10:39.920]  When people say, I don't want you searching my car, cops talk about how they'd like to
[10:39.920 --> 10:48.040]  kill you when they're in the squad car together or in your car searching it.
[10:48.040 --> 10:51.760]  I mean I know I'm supposed to love that and thank you for the way you behave and the way
[10:51.760 --> 10:54.760]  you treat us like third world slaves.
[10:54.760 --> 10:56.600]  I mean I understand that.
[10:56.600 --> 11:00.920]  I understand I need to learn how to roll over and just totally flush down the toilet everything
[11:00.920 --> 11:09.080]  this country's ever been or ever will be but I'm mad about it.
[11:09.080 --> 11:14.840]  The country itself is degenerated so the police of course have degenerated by and large.
[11:14.840 --> 11:21.400]  The training by design is to separate the people from the police as we spiral down this rat
[11:21.400 --> 11:29.320]  hole but I start the broadcast talking about that issue because you think about all the
[11:29.320 --> 11:31.120]  scrutiny we go through.
[11:31.120 --> 11:36.600]  Now the feds show up with Viper teams and Dallas and Houston and Miami and they just
[11:36.600 --> 11:41.120]  randomly search people in shopping malls, just federal police in black uniforms, just
[11:41.120 --> 11:42.120]  lying up.
[11:42.120 --> 11:47.280]  We're randomly searching people and they search people on trains and they search everybody's
[11:47.280 --> 11:53.240]  bags in New York getting on the subway and they're listening to our cell phone calls
[11:53.240 --> 11:57.360]  and tracking when you order a pizza with any of the big pizza chains.
[11:57.360 --> 12:01.280]  They are uploading your data instantly to run it for warrants and they get a percentage
[12:01.280 --> 12:02.280]  of a bounty.
[12:02.280 --> 12:07.760]  Again guilty until proven innocent because they know you're giving a real location and
[12:07.760 --> 12:11.000]  generally a real name with a credit card to get that pizza.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.320]  I remember that was in the USA today.
[12:12.320 --> 12:21.480]  I mean we are just a completely surveilled pathetic country.
[12:21.480 --> 12:28.240]  I mean it's sad and then I see a story like this.
[12:28.240 --> 12:31.720]  This is out of the sunny telegraph, it was also in the Associated Press, I couldn't find
[12:31.720 --> 12:36.720]  my AP article I had yesterday, I never got to.
[12:36.720 --> 12:41.960]  Sat nav for Mexicans illegally entering US.
[12:41.960 --> 12:46.520]  Now the US they're more politically correct, the AP has some headline like immigrants being
[12:46.520 --> 12:54.440]  given satellite navigation systems, you're not even allowed to call them illegals.
[12:54.440 --> 12:58.000]  It's so precious to the corporate elite, so precious to the New World Order, they're
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.120]  so close to completely ending any future this nation has by flooding us with illegal
[13:03.120 --> 13:09.320]  aliens to balkanize and have sectarian violence in the future like they've done in Iraq.
[13:09.320 --> 13:15.200]  They're so close to their global Balkans as Brzezinski calls it that they're just pulling
[13:15.200 --> 13:19.000]  on every stop.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.320]  Sat nav for Mexicans illegally entering US, illegal immigrants planning to cross the desert
[13:24.320 --> 13:29.680]  and enter the US on foot are being given hand held satellite devices by the Mexican authorities
[13:29.680 --> 13:32.200]  to ensure they arrive safely.
[13:32.200 --> 13:38.200]  And in past reports the Mexican troops surveil the border patrol, surveil the few hundred
[13:38.200 --> 13:44.200]  national guard that are down there for show, and drive by truck the illegal aliens.
[13:44.200 --> 13:48.600]  And of course they're shaking their people down, they prod them, they poke them, I mean
[13:48.600 --> 13:51.680]  I've seen Mexican troops all over Mexico.
[13:51.680 --> 13:55.920]  The people just bow down and lick their boots like we'll do as Americans here, it just makes
[13:55.920 --> 14:01.440]  me so angry to watch them point their machine guns at people and to watch people in a uniform
[14:01.440 --> 14:03.480]  grovel.
[14:03.480 --> 14:08.280]  We'll be like that soon, we're already almost there, see the journey from being free and
[14:08.280 --> 14:12.200]  upright and land of the free home of the brave, feared by everybody in the world when Americans
[14:12.200 --> 14:22.800]  went to war, to just, to just mindless, you know, oiled yuppies, all talking about their
[14:22.800 --> 14:29.160]  double lattes and their skin creams, I guess in a way it's kind of good, you get to be
[14:29.160 --> 14:36.360]  slaves you scum, and wipe that sick smile off your little faces.
[14:36.360 --> 14:41.960]  I am right, they're taking my property, I am right, they're taking my guns, I've loved
[14:41.960 --> 14:47.760]  George Bush, I have rights, they're drafting my children.
[14:47.760 --> 14:50.800]  But again when you give your kids the shots full of the mercury and they go autistic, you're
[14:50.800 --> 14:54.960]  so weak minded you never even admit to yourself, see a lot of you I warned or others warned
[14:54.960 --> 14:58.840]  but even after, after you brain damage your kids you never admit it to yourself, hell
[14:58.840 --> 15:06.240]  you have more kids and you give them the shots, most of you, because you love death, you love
[15:06.240 --> 15:07.240]  being a slave.
[15:07.240 --> 15:12.120]  Alright, I gotta watch it, for those who just tuned in to my sound different, I'm not drunk
[15:12.120 --> 15:17.040]  or something, I have a fever, but I have a big guest coming on today and I don't want
[15:17.040 --> 15:21.560]  to miss the show so I'm here, I have a horrible neck ache, I'm like an invalid or something
[15:21.560 --> 15:27.120]  today, I took a lot of energy to get out of the bed but I am here and so please put up
[15:27.120 --> 15:29.640]  with me.
[15:29.640 --> 15:37.160]  Batman for Mexicans illegally entering the US, illegal immigrants planning to cross the
[15:37.160 --> 15:44.320]  desert and enter the US on foot are to be given handheld satellite devices by the Mexican
[15:44.320 --> 15:51.680]  authorities, the officials, see we're the civilians, see we don't have that term, I
[15:51.680 --> 15:57.600]  mean they call them officials and authorities, in Chichescu's, Romania and Mexico 50 years
[15:57.600 --> 16:04.720]  ago, see, we have just adopted the nomenclature of slaves ourselves as of late, the journey
[16:04.720 --> 16:12.720]  into bondage continuing, illegal immigrants planning to cross the desert and enter the
[16:12.720 --> 16:22.240]  US on foot are to be given handheld satellite devices by Mexican authorities to ensure they
[16:22.240 --> 16:29.960]  arrive safely, those who get lost or fall sick during the dangerous four-day crossing will
[16:29.960 --> 16:37.640]  be able to activate the device to alert frontier police on both sides of the border, the satellite
[16:37.640 --> 16:43.440]  tracking service will require, would be illegal to register their intentions before setting
[16:43.440 --> 16:52.840]  off a paradoxical move given the security is necessary for success, but Mexican authorities
[16:52.840 --> 16:57.880]  are predicting that about 200,000 devices will be handed out when the project is launched
[16:57.880 --> 17:04.440]  formally in the coming year, our intention is to save lives said Jamie Orbegaan, the
[17:04.440 --> 17:11.400]  coordinator for the state commission for migrants in Puebla, the Mexican state which is behind
[17:11.400 --> 17:16.960]  the project, there are lots of people looking to cross and we are working with the US authorities
[17:16.960 --> 17:22.080]  to make sure they do not die on the way and I got them to put in water stations there
[17:22.080 --> 17:30.120]  too, of course, I've seen the numbers, 60 plus percent of those dying are not dying of
[17:30.120 --> 17:38.200]  snake bite or heat exhaustion, they're being robbed by the Mexican coyotes on both sides
[17:38.200 --> 17:46.200]  of the border and no one's there to protect them and no one's going to protect them, it's
[17:46.200 --> 17:52.160]  in the local Arizona, New Mexico and South Texas news, but never nationally, the grenade
[17:52.160 --> 17:59.280]  attacks, the rocket attacks, the 800 deaths in 2005 alone, I haven't seen those six numbers
[17:59.280 --> 18:03.680]  they always come out months after the year ends, just in Texas alone the truck bombs
[18:03.680 --> 18:11.240]  going off in Dallas, people being machine gunned here in Austin, it's all kept very
[18:11.240 --> 18:21.760]  quiet, like three cases of leprosy in the 50 years before 2000, from 2000 to 2003, seven
[18:21.760 --> 18:29.640]  plus thousand cases and a new leper colony started outside Palestine, Texas, I have reports
[18:29.640 --> 18:35.960]  today of tuberculosis spreading in pandemics all over schools around the nation but still
[18:35.960 --> 18:44.800]  kept very quiet, a few articles, spinal meningitis spreading, no, we don't try to treat the
[18:44.800 --> 18:50.080]  illegals coming in, they're allowed to do whatever they want because they serve a purpose
[18:50.080 --> 18:55.880]  of destroying the middle class and bringing us into the new world order, I have articles
[18:55.880 --> 19:03.800]  today about the drug resistant and immune TB epidemics, some schools, public schools
[19:03.800 --> 19:09.960]  are closed because parents are freaking out, they're having trouble keeping it quiet, 30
[19:09.960 --> 19:18.280]  plus percent of the students in some schools are testing positive for tuberculosis and
[19:18.280 --> 19:24.800]  it won't stop, it will intensify and when your child gets leprosy or when your child
[19:24.800 --> 19:31.240]  gets tuberculosis, it won't be in the newspaper, it won't be discussed, when your child goes
[19:31.240 --> 19:37.720]  to a sanitarium which they've now been reopening across the nation, nothing will be done, this
[19:37.720 --> 19:48.080]  is the new America, it is a military attack on our dollar, on our industries, on our families
[19:48.080 --> 19:54.960]  whether you're Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, the U.S. is being broken right
[19:54.960 --> 20:03.040]  now, its back is being broken, I saw some posting on my MySpace account last night,
[20:03.040 --> 20:11.120]  oh Alex, I used to like him but I don't now, look at all the alarmist headlines, if you
[20:11.120 --> 20:20.440]  aren't alarmed by what's happening, there's something wrong with you fundamentally, open
[20:20.440 --> 20:25.600]  discussions of attacking Iran, the fact they're announcing that half our ground forces will
[20:25.600 --> 20:38.440]  be illegal aliens by the end of the decade is a crisis.
[20:38.440 --> 20:42.720]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer, do you realize that the race for the cure
[20:42.720 --> 20:48.160]  is over, the best kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer
[20:48.160 --> 20:53.760]  without personal suffering, mutilation and poisoning of your entire system, now it's
[20:53.760 --> 20:59.960]  cancer's turn to die with laser that incorporate its patented methodology, without cutting,
[20:59.960 --> 21:04.960]  bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors
[21:04.960 --> 21:11.000]  of any size, without adverse side effects at a physician's office, star war technology
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.640]  at its best.

[21:35.880 --> 21:41.840]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine, have you ever been told that communism has collapsed
[21:41.840 --> 21:48.040]  and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty, if so why are communists overthrowing African
[21:48.040 --> 21:53.880]  and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime, if so why has
[21:53.880 --> 21:58.640]  Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in
[21:58.640 --> 22:04.920]  preparation for an attack to end capitalism, we'd like to help you understand why these
[22:04.920 --> 22:12.400]  things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[22:35.560 --> 22:40.800]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy but would you be prepared during an accident?
[22:40.800 --> 22:46.160]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere
[22:46.160 --> 22:49.200]  which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[22:49.200 --> 22:53.760]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most
[22:53.760 --> 22:58.000]  severe consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.640]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good
[23:02.640 --> 23:03.720]  iodine.
[23:03.720 --> 23:09.240]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[23:09.240 --> 23:13.600]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause
[23:13.600 --> 23:18.080]  upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[23:18.080 --> 23:24.640]  Consider the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling new millennium

[23:35.080 --> 23:39.280]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt but
[23:39.280 --> 23:44.280]  the truth be told public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999 reaching
[23:44.280 --> 23:51.880]  a peak of $14.8 trillion marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[23:51.880 --> 23:56.440]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution
[23:56.440 --> 23:58.320]  called the Federal Reserve System.
[23:58.320 --> 24:03.840]  In the year 2000 debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%, it's bad enough that the U.S. citizens
[24:03.840 --> 24:08.520]  is bound by debt in order to have commerce, however shocking the economy with the reduction
[24:08.520 --> 24:13.120]  of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[24:13.120 --> 24:19.280]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts, call 1-800-686-2237
[24:19.280 --> 24:23.240]  for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[24:23.240 --> 24:27.400]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[24:27.400 --> 24:51.480]  Call 1-800-686-2237, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[24:51.480 --> 24:57.640]  Welcome back, I'm going to go to Bill and Jerry and Joe and Jim and Bill, coming up in the
[24:57.640 --> 24:58.640]  next hour.
[24:58.640 --> 25:03.080]  We had him on a few weeks ago in his interview with us, got a lot of attention.
[25:03.080 --> 25:08.680]  He wrote to the U.S. Biological Weapons Treaty, helped write the UN Treaty and he went to
[25:08.680 --> 25:19.120]  school with the neocons at Chicago Business School with Leon Strauss, kind of a big brood
[25:19.120 --> 25:21.720]  mother of these Trotskyites.
[25:21.720 --> 25:27.320]  He was a supporter of fascism and any totalitarian system, communism as well, and he taught them
[25:27.320 --> 25:33.200]  how to set up a dictatorship, so he witnessed a lot of this, kind of like Stanley Hilton
[25:33.200 --> 25:34.200]  did.
[25:34.200 --> 25:37.040]  He'll be coming on, he'll be putting a book called, Destroying World Order, U.S. Imperialism
[25:37.040 --> 25:40.680]  in the Middle East, before and after 9-11, he'll be on with us in the second hour.
[25:40.680 --> 25:44.400]  We had him on where he laid out the fact that our government had to launch the anthrax attacks,
[25:44.400 --> 25:46.960]  and he went through the evidence with us.
[25:46.960 --> 25:54.320]  So Francis, Dr. Francis A. Boyle will be joining us coming up.
[25:54.320 --> 25:57.800]  I have a bunch of issues, but let's just go to the calls and I said I would.
[25:57.800 --> 25:59.720]  Bill and Arizona, you're on the air, go ahead.
[25:59.720 --> 26:02.520]  Hey Alex, hey, you hang in there, you're gonna get better.
[26:02.520 --> 26:06.520]  Oh, and I'm only telling books I'm sick, so I don't think it's a new host doing the show.
[26:06.520 --> 26:07.520]  Yeah, that's right.
[26:07.520 --> 26:13.200]  I got the, whatever this stuff is, everybody's got an earache, sore throat, sweaty nose, but
[26:13.200 --> 26:15.120]  well, this is not fun stuff.
[26:15.120 --> 26:19.000]  Yeah, I thought you were a new host when I turned on the radio this morning.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.600]  Yeah, I'm crazy, I don't know if my wife is saying it's staying bad, but I feel worse
[26:22.600 --> 26:23.600]  doing that.
[26:23.600 --> 26:29.680]  Yeah, I don't know if you're aware of this Proposition 300 here in Arizona, about the
[26:29.680 --> 26:32.680]  illegal aliens having to pay more tuition.
[26:32.680 --> 26:33.680]  Yes.
[26:33.680 --> 26:36.280]  Well, they're having a big rally in Glendale, Arizona.
[26:36.280 --> 26:38.480]  I wish you were up here Monday night.
[26:38.480 --> 26:42.800]  It's gonna be before the bowl game, and it's gonna be on national TV.
[26:42.800 --> 26:46.360]  Well, we need a lot of people out there just to shut these people up.
[26:46.360 --> 26:50.000]  You know, a lot of Mexicans are gonna be out there protesting against this.
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.800]  Well, that's what happens.
[26:51.800 --> 26:57.360]  The media, the police, the system always accommodates the protest, gives it total massive coverage.
[26:57.360 --> 27:01.960]  Again, I'm not even against the people of Mexico, okay?
[27:01.960 --> 27:05.720]  The fact is, the elite wants this, it's destroying our country.
[27:05.720 --> 27:09.720]  They treat American citizens like slaves everywhere, but our borders are completely
[27:09.720 --> 27:13.600]  wide open, and the Mexican government with our government is gonna give them GPS.
[27:13.600 --> 27:14.600]  Right.
[27:14.600 --> 27:17.400]  I mean, look, under the guest working program, they're all legal to begin with.
[27:17.400 --> 27:21.080]  The Democrats are about to kick off the first session of the new Congress.
[27:21.080 --> 27:22.400]  I mean, we're in trouble.
[27:22.400 --> 27:23.400]  Yeah.
[27:23.400 --> 27:28.040]  I mean, you know, 90% of Americans want to control our borders, including 67% of Hispanic
[27:28.040 --> 27:29.040]  Americans.
[27:29.040 --> 27:30.040]  Yeah.
[27:30.040 --> 27:31.040]  What's the government's answer?
[27:31.040 --> 27:32.040]  We're gonna legalize them.
[27:32.040 --> 27:34.520]  78% of Americans want us out of Iraq.
[27:34.520 --> 27:35.920]  The Democrats answer, we're gonna increase.
[27:35.920 --> 27:37.800]  I mean, they're just a bunch of scum.
[27:37.800 --> 27:38.800]  Yeah.
[27:38.800 --> 27:40.880]  They're killing this country, period.
[27:40.880 --> 27:42.680]  They're killing its good name.
[27:42.680 --> 27:43.760]  They're killing its borders.
[27:43.760 --> 27:46.440]  They're killing its industry at every level.
[27:46.440 --> 27:47.440]  Yeah.
[27:47.440 --> 27:48.680]  We're going down the tubes, you're right.
[27:48.680 --> 27:53.240]  Did you know that Arizona ranks 49th in education now?
[27:53.240 --> 27:57.920]  And that's because all these illegal aliens are in our schools and they can't speak English?
[27:57.920 --> 28:00.800]  No, no, I thought Texas, I haven't seen the number in a couple years.
[28:00.800 --> 28:01.800]  It changes.
[28:01.800 --> 28:08.000]  But I guess you took the pole position away from Texas, because Texas was 49th in education.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  I think West Virginia or something was the worst.
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.600]  But Texas is usually the worst.
[28:12.600 --> 28:14.440]  It's going down the tube now.
[28:14.440 --> 28:17.920]  How dare you steal our mental.
[28:17.920 --> 28:20.760]  We're just going down the tube real fast.
[28:20.760 --> 28:22.760]  Hey, but that's how the elite likes it.
[28:22.760 --> 28:26.280]  You know, manageable peon slaves that have nothing, thanks for the call.
[28:26.280 --> 28:33.400]  I wish you'd have got more details, but I'm sure folks can do a search and find out about
[28:33.400 --> 28:35.520]  the illegal alien demonstration.
[28:35.520 --> 28:41.640]  Yeah, California, Utah, places like that give more to issue to illegal aliens.
[28:41.640 --> 28:47.560]  This is a minute than US citizens get.
[28:47.560 --> 28:51.240]  I mean, it's every incentive you can.
[28:51.240 --> 28:58.280]  Again, let's just separate this out of, I mean, this is a foreign country that is a police
[28:58.280 --> 29:04.000]  state that has more billionaires per capita than any other nation in the world.
[29:04.000 --> 29:07.240]  Because you've got just a few families in their minions that own it.
[29:07.240 --> 29:16.360]  They have triple the resources, oil, nickel, just on average, you can look it up, but Mexico
[29:16.360 --> 29:27.480]  has triple the resources that the United States has triple, but their people are total slaves.
[29:27.480 --> 29:30.200]  And they're running them all off their property in the south of Mexico.
[29:30.200 --> 29:38.520]  That's how Mexico City's gone from 15 million 10 years ago to 33 million last time I checked.
[29:38.520 --> 29:42.920]  Half of them living in cardboard boxes, the most dangerous city in the world, the most
[29:42.920 --> 29:49.760]  toxic city in the world, over a third of the newborn babies that are born in the shacks
[29:49.760 --> 29:53.640]  that drink out of those water systems where all of our batteries and toxic waste gets
[29:53.640 --> 29:58.800]  dumped by, say, a lot of it, have a syndrome where they don't have a brain.
[29:58.800 --> 30:04.040]  They literally only have the brainstem operating, so I'm against that.
[30:04.040 --> 30:05.040]  I'm against globalism.
[30:05.040 --> 30:11.240]  I understand why these Mexicans want to come up here, but it's a battering ram of the new
[30:11.240 --> 30:12.600]  world order.
[30:12.600 --> 30:17.560]  We need to help get a revolution in our country, get our nation back, go down there and kick
[30:17.560 --> 30:19.960]  their lead out and help their revolution.
[30:19.960 --> 30:25.600]  Instead our government gives them the weapons to kill their people.
[30:25.600 --> 30:33.120]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:33.120 --> 30:40.320]  Have you ever wondered about what the mark of the beast is in Chapter 13 of Revelation?
[30:40.320 --> 30:42.760]  What does 666 really mean?
[30:42.760 --> 30:45.440]  Or about the Harlech Church of Revelation 17?
[30:45.440 --> 30:48.080]  Or about the Beast of Daniel in Revelation?
[30:48.080 --> 30:51.480]  Speculation abounds about these ancient prophecies and what they might mean today.
[30:51.480 --> 30:56.720]  Now one of the foremost scholars on geopolitics and popular talk show guest, Dr. Michael Kaufman
[30:56.720 --> 31:00.080]  has just released a DVD called World Events and Prophecy.
[31:00.080 --> 31:04.680]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is recognized for his penetrating analyses of global events and
[31:04.680 --> 31:09.760]  has used his information to almost single-handedly stop the United Nations Convention on Biological
[31:09.760 --> 31:14.720]  Diversity from being ratified by the U.S. Senate one hour before the Senate was to vote
[31:14.720 --> 31:15.720]  to ratify it.
[31:15.720 --> 31:19.760]  Order World Events and Prophecy now and see why those who have seen it say it is one of
[31:19.760 --> 31:21.920]  the best DVDs on the subject.

[31:33.080 --> 31:37.200]  Don't be caught off guard.
[31:37.200 --> 31:42.080]  Hi this is Ted Anderson here for the 2007 Red Book.
[31:42.080 --> 31:46.600]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last
[31:46.600 --> 31:47.600]  year.
[31:47.600 --> 31:52.480]  It is a learning testimony of how quickly the U.S. dollar can be devalued.
[31:52.480 --> 31:56.360]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential
[31:56.360 --> 31:57.360]  profits.
[31:57.360 --> 32:01.880]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth,
[32:01.880 --> 32:06.240]  it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[32:06.240 --> 32:11.360]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[32:11.360 --> 32:15.920]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[32:15.920 --> 32:20.560]  Call for your copy today, it's 800-686-2237.
[32:20.560 --> 32:24.440]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply
[32:24.440 --> 32:27.240]  must have the Red Book in your library.
[32:27.240 --> 32:35.400]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[32:35.400 --> 32:40.440]  It's no secret, aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable
[32:40.440 --> 32:42.400]  of causing DNA damage.
[32:42.400 --> 32:47.240]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[32:47.240 --> 32:49.320]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[32:49.320 --> 32:52.840]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called nobio.
[32:52.840 --> 32:57.760]  Nobio eliminates the bacterial growth, which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration,
[32:57.760 --> 33:00.960]  which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[33:00.960 --> 33:05.560]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in nobio.
[33:05.560 --> 33:10.640]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree
[33:10.640 --> 33:12.160]  oil, and uranium.
[33:12.160 --> 33:16.160]  Nobio's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[33:16.160 --> 33:20.960]  You can use nobio under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[33:20.960 --> 33:25.040]  Nobio is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.

[34:26.640 --> 34:28.640]  Welcome back, my friends.
[34:28.640 --> 34:45.640]  While you were dreaming, this little island disappears
[34:45.640 --> 34:52.640]  While you were dreaming, while you were looking the other way
[34:52.640 --> 35:00.640]  They'll take your rights to own your own ideas
[35:00.640 --> 35:05.640]  You know, to the Japanese, to the trendies, to the bling-blings out there and those things
[35:05.640 --> 35:11.640]  It's so alien, it's so bizarre to care about your country
[35:11.640 --> 35:14.640]  To care about the future destiny of your children
[35:14.640 --> 35:17.640]  To care about liberty
[35:17.640 --> 35:19.640]  And that's why we've gotten this position
[35:19.640 --> 35:23.640]  For a lot of people, I'd have to say 20-30% of the population, maybe more
[35:23.640 --> 35:26.640]  They just don't care about anybody but themselves
[35:26.640 --> 35:31.640]  Then you probably got another 30 or 40% who care about others
[35:31.640 --> 35:34.640]  But only the fad that the corporate media puts out
[35:34.640 --> 35:38.640]  Then they take their well-meaning energies and use it towards evil
[35:38.640 --> 35:42.640]  Towards tattling on their neighbors, warrantless checkpoints
[35:42.640 --> 35:46.640]  Getting rid of the borders, oh let's be sweet to the dear little immigrants
[35:46.640 --> 35:51.640]  You want to be like Blade Runner folks because there's 6.5 billion people
[35:51.640 --> 35:55.640]  There's going to be 8 billion in 10 years or less
[35:55.640 --> 35:58.640]  They all want to come here
[35:58.640 --> 36:04.640]  And if you're going to have them come here, you might as well test them for drug, immune, TB, and leprosy
[36:04.640 --> 36:10.640]  And 100 other horrible things that are spreading all over
[36:10.640 --> 36:16.640]  I mean, I got several articles today of kids dying all over the country from meningitis
[36:16.640 --> 36:20.640]  And in one article at Footnotes, well, yeah, it was brought in by the immigrant community
[36:20.640 --> 36:23.640]  I mean, there's some scary stuff coming in here folks
[36:23.640 --> 36:26.640]  We've gotten rid of all the big diseases and weren't
[36:26.640 --> 36:28.640]  You know, when you go to the third world, you've got to be careful
[36:28.640 --> 36:31.640]  You've got to watch where you eat, you've got to drink filtered water
[36:31.640 --> 36:37.640]  There's a reason, they never got real sanitation, it's disease filled
[36:37.640 --> 36:42.640]  In the third world, they also sell antibiotics like candy on the store shelves
[36:42.640 --> 36:46.640]  And so that's a lot of the superbugs come from there because of that as well
[36:46.640 --> 36:50.640]  And I just look at an article like
[36:50.640 --> 36:56.640]  The Mexican US government are teamed up together to give 200,000 devices
[36:56.640 --> 37:04.640]  To border crossers, GPS, alarms
[37:04.640 --> 37:06.640]  I mean, it's amazing
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.640]  Again, I, when I go to the bank, have to show an ID card
[37:11.640 --> 37:14.640]  Three forms of ID to get a bank account or cash a check
[37:14.640 --> 37:20.640]  It is in the Associated Press what we already reported to you that what we couldn't believe
[37:20.640 --> 37:23.640]  We were getting the reports of it and they confirmed it
[37:23.640 --> 37:27.640]  We've been telling you for two years, they don't have to show
[37:27.640 --> 37:30.640]  It doesn't matter where they're from
[37:30.640 --> 37:36.640]  You just walk up and you tell them I'm an immigrant and they say, what's your name
[37:36.640 --> 37:40.640]  And they just give you a whole new identity
[37:40.640 --> 37:44.640]  Home loans, car loans, everything
[37:44.640 --> 37:46.640]  I mean, how?
[37:46.640 --> 37:50.640]  And again, when you come to some checkpoint and these cops walk up and want to search your car
[37:50.640 --> 37:52.640]  You ought to just laugh at them
[37:52.640 --> 37:56.640]  The government ships the narcotics in, controls the licenses who can bring them in
[37:56.640 --> 38:01.640]  That's where it's admitted, up one side and down the other, from every angle you can imagine
[38:01.640 --> 38:04.640]  Hundreds of whistleblowers going public
[38:04.640 --> 38:09.640]  Hundreds of times, the CIA and others have been caught shipping it in by the DEA and others
[38:09.640 --> 38:15.640]  They got the nerve to bust your door down, looking for the trash their bosses brought in
[38:15.640 --> 38:21.640]  They got the nerve to arrest you because you forgot your driver's license when you drove to the store to get some milk
[38:21.640 --> 38:26.640]  That people I know, oh, you should have had your driver's license
[38:26.640 --> 38:29.640]  Well, if you're an illegal alien, you can do whatever you want
[38:29.640 --> 38:33.640]  It just shows how it's all selectively enforced
[38:33.640 --> 38:35.640]  I'm going to go to your calls quickly now
[38:35.640 --> 38:41.640]  I say I'm under the weather today with sore throat and stuff and I'm going to go to calls and I don't
[38:41.640 --> 38:45.640]  It's just, it's so over the top, everything that's happening
[38:45.640 --> 38:49.640]  By the way, I started a few months ago carrying world events and prophecy
[38:49.640 --> 38:53.640]  And it just looks at the world government, the documents, what is admitted in comparison to the Bible
[38:53.640 --> 38:54.640]  It's pretty scary
[38:54.640 --> 38:59.640]  Dr. Michael Kaufman started carrying that
[38:59.640 --> 39:04.640]  And we carry that on the online video and bookstore at infowars.com
[39:04.640 --> 39:07.640]  If you want to support us and get a great video, you should go do that
[39:07.640 --> 39:12.640]  Or 9-Eleven Mysteries Demolitions
[39:12.640 --> 39:14.640]  We have that
[39:14.640 --> 39:19.640]  Or you can also get Aaron Russo's America Freedom to Fascism
[39:19.640 --> 39:23.640]  About the Federal Reserve and the private IRS and how it operates
[39:23.640 --> 39:26.640]  Great film, incredible, much stronger than what you saw in theaters
[39:26.640 --> 39:30.640]  It's even better, what was in theaters look great
[39:30.640 --> 39:34.640]  We've got Loose Change 2nd Edition, we've got Mighty Film Terror Storm
[39:34.640 --> 39:37.640]  The history of government-sponsored terror, such an important film
[39:37.640 --> 39:43.640]  The 68 minutes of extras on it from the 9-Eleven Neoconagenda Symposium last June in Los Angeles
[39:43.640 --> 39:49.640]  With top experts exposing all the highlights of a two-day conference in 68 minutes
[39:49.640 --> 39:52.640]  It's worth 19 bucks just for that
[39:52.640 --> 39:59.640]  You can get Terror Storm as low as 9.95 on infowars.com when you get it with America Freedom to Fascism
[39:59.640 --> 40:03.640]  We've got 20-something specials up there, we just keep adding more and more
[40:03.640 --> 40:06.640]  We're going to take some downs soon because it's getting confusing
[40:06.640 --> 40:08.640]  So I take advantage of those
[40:08.640 --> 40:11.640]  And that's, by the way, how we fund this operation
[40:11.640 --> 40:15.640]  A lot of days now I come in and I don't even plug the videos, which I should
[40:15.640 --> 40:19.640]  That's how we make the films, do the video reports
[40:19.640 --> 40:25.640]  I mean, I sent two guys out to the FEMA camp in north of Austin two days ago
[40:25.640 --> 40:28.640]  Paid two people all day to go out there and do that
[40:28.640 --> 40:32.640]  Then paid Aaron Dykes for two days' work, a day and a half of work
[40:32.640 --> 40:37.640]  Editing the piece to upload to Google Video for free
[40:37.640 --> 40:40.640]  That's the type of service we provide
[40:40.640 --> 40:42.640]  When you buy Terror Storm
[40:42.640 --> 40:45.640]  When you buy America Freedom to Fascism
[40:45.640 --> 40:49.640]  When you buy videos like World Events and Prophecy
[40:49.640 --> 40:58.640]  When you get these materials, see, this is not some business where our goal is to stick more money in a bank account
[40:58.640 --> 41:03.640]  It means nothing, it's being devalued, it's like toilet paper, folks
[41:03.640 --> 41:05.640]  Alright
[41:05.640 --> 41:08.640]  But you can take that toilet paper and get powerful videos
[41:08.640 --> 41:12.640]  And then we will use that to put it in our tank
[41:12.640 --> 41:17.640]  And that's what we are, is a tank to run over new loader operations
[41:17.640 --> 41:21.640]  Run over their soldiers and drive down the ditches and run them over
[41:21.640 --> 41:26.640]  That's what we do in the Info War, that's the analogy or analogous
[41:26.640 --> 41:30.640]  And we are hard working, we get a lot done
[41:30.640 --> 41:35.640]  And if I have more support, I will hire more people, I will get a bigger office
[41:35.640 --> 41:40.640]  And I will do a lot more than what we are currently doing
[41:40.640 --> 41:46.640]  So it's also important to support us and to go to infowars.com
[41:46.640 --> 41:53.640]  And to get the everything special or get my DVD specials or get the book specials
[41:53.640 --> 41:56.640]  And give them as gifts, even if you know about the new World War
[41:56.640 --> 41:59.640]  Get them, make copies, give them to your friends and family
[41:59.640 --> 42:02.640]  That's how we've come this far in this fight
[42:02.640 --> 42:07.640]  And my passion in life is to fight the globalist
[42:07.640 --> 42:11.640]  I mean these are bad people folks, this is about survival for me
[42:11.640 --> 42:16.640]  That's why I'm here today when I've got a fever and I'm sick
[42:16.640 --> 42:20.640]  Because I have a passion
[42:20.640 --> 42:23.640]  I mean why would you not have a passion?
[42:23.640 --> 42:26.640]  These are really bad people
[42:26.640 --> 42:30.640]  I've got BBC, London Telegraph, you name it today
[42:30.640 --> 42:36.640]  Where the UN's running child slavery and child bordellos, pedophile rings
[42:36.640 --> 42:40.640]  I mean every day there's articles, I mean every day, that's all they do
[42:40.640 --> 42:45.640]  I mean how could we not want to expose them, I mean this is bad
[42:45.640 --> 42:48.640]  I have empathy folks
[42:48.640 --> 42:52.640]  And see in the yuppie world, empathy is seen as weakness
[42:52.640 --> 42:57.640]  In the trendy world, you just care about yourself, you just make a lot of money
[42:57.640 --> 43:02.640]  You have lots of fancy shoes and computers and you go on the best trips
[43:02.640 --> 43:07.640]  I just want to beat your brains out when I see you out there
[43:07.640 --> 43:09.640]  You don't care about this country
[43:09.640 --> 43:12.640]  I do, I just want to knock your teeth out
[43:12.640 --> 43:16.640]  I mean that's really how I feel about you
[43:16.640 --> 43:19.640]  I do, I want to hurt you
[43:19.640 --> 43:24.640]  Because if you people cared and you stood up we could save this country
[43:24.640 --> 43:27.640]  I know that their old order is evil, I know what they're all about
[43:27.640 --> 43:30.640]  And I respect them, I hate them, I love them
[43:30.640 --> 43:34.640]  But in a way it's even more nauseating
[43:34.640 --> 43:38.640]  The Bible says that you're either hot or cold, I spit you out of my mouth
[43:38.640 --> 43:43.640]  These fence sitters and people that sit around and send me little emails making jokes
[43:43.640 --> 43:46.640]  You're making this stuff up or you're a cook or you're nuts
[43:46.640 --> 43:49.640]  You know what, I wish I was a cook
[43:49.640 --> 43:55.640]  I wish God this wasn't real
[43:55.640 --> 43:59.640]  I wish I was making all this up
[43:59.640 --> 44:05.640]  Because we don't have a future, we don't, these are bad people
[44:05.640 --> 44:13.640]  And I happen to care about Mexican children down in Mexico City
[44:13.640 --> 44:24.640]  There's nothing in that hell that makes the jungle, the book written about the U.S. in the Industrial Revolution
[44:24.640 --> 44:29.640]  Late 1800s, early 1900s, looked like a tea party
[44:29.640 --> 44:35.640]  I happen to care deeply about all the families
[44:35.640 --> 44:39.640]  From Austin to Chicago, from LA to New York right now
[44:39.640 --> 44:44.640]  That have CPS grabbing women around the throat with police telling them to sign documents, sign their children over
[44:44.640 --> 44:50.640]  I've seen it, I've wept when I've left the hospital covering these things
[44:50.640 --> 44:55.640]  I have empathy, and you know why I have empathy?
[44:55.640 --> 45:01.640]  Because mammals have empathy so we don't tear each other apart
[45:01.640 --> 45:07.640]  We are predators, we are intelligent, we are dynamic, we are powerful
[45:07.640 --> 45:12.640]  And if we don't have love, we tear each other apart
[45:12.640 --> 45:21.640]  And if we don't have empathy, we wouldn't have souls
[45:21.640 --> 45:30.640]  And I don't know how people can say, I'm just living my life, the world has always been a bad place
[45:30.640 --> 45:33.640]  That's just the way it is
[45:33.640 --> 45:39.640]  I'm getting mine, what are you getting? Plates of food? Sex?
[45:39.640 --> 45:46.640]  I'm not against people that like cars, I'm not saying owning things is bad, but if that's your God it's bad
[45:46.640 --> 45:54.640]  People who care and just constantly care what everybody thinks about them, I just don't understand it
[45:54.640 --> 45:59.640]  I don't want to get off on some preachers binge here
[45:59.640 --> 46:05.640]  I mean, take what's happening with the Democrats
[46:05.640 --> 46:11.640]  I mean, is there any illustration that could be better of what trash they are?
[46:11.640 --> 46:19.640]  I mean, a bunch of festooned women dressed up in their $3,000 dresses with their broaches
[46:19.640 --> 46:24.640]  On power trips running around scheming to get more control
[46:24.640 --> 46:31.640]  That political prostitute Nancy Pelosi with her restaurant chains and all the rest of it
[46:31.640 --> 46:36.640]  Running around and you've got all of those Republicans
[46:36.640 --> 46:39.640]  I mean, you ought to watch the Texas legislature when it's on TV
[46:39.640 --> 46:44.640]  They even look worse than Congress, it's like all these people in these fancy suits with these fake smiles
[46:44.640 --> 46:51.640]  You see them, they're all posturing, the men are trying to look manly, but they all look real effeminate
[46:51.640 --> 47:01.640]  And you just want to, you just, oh yeah, I'm just sick of them, I'm sick of scum
[47:01.640 --> 47:03.640]  I'm sick of you
[47:03.640 --> 47:08.640]  A bunch of scum, paid off, selling everything out, looting everything
[47:08.640 --> 47:13.640]  With their pinky rings and their cuff links and their, just everything there
[47:13.640 --> 47:16.640]  They're not even real people, their whole lives are just make believe
[47:16.640 --> 47:23.640]  It's just this image of themselves, it's like when you're five and you dress up like a policeman and play the part of a policeman
[47:23.640 --> 47:32.640]  They just play the part of, oh, powerful people, oh, yes, oh, oh, they're so powerful
[47:32.640 --> 47:38.640]  And you see the Democrats come into office saying they get us out of Iraq
[47:38.640 --> 47:41.640]  And I told you folks they weren't going to do anything
[47:41.640 --> 47:50.640]  But it's good they came in, because now that idol, that idol can be thrown down to in front of you
[47:50.640 --> 47:56.640]  All those Democrats that were sitting on the fence and criticizing me, oh, don't say they're going to be traitors when they get in
[47:56.640 --> 48:02.640]  JR, you want to tell impeaching, they're just strategizing right now to get elected
[48:02.640 --> 48:07.640]  Oh, you wait, once they get in, they're going to get us out of Iraq, huh, huh
[48:07.640 --> 48:12.640]  I'm not going to listen to you anymore, and I'm not going to visit your website anymore
[48:12.640 --> 48:16.640]  Well, now you're emailing back apologizing, and I don't care about you apologizing to me
[48:16.640 --> 48:20.640]  I don't need the ego trip of you being wrong, I wish you would be right
[48:20.640 --> 48:32.640]  We have to admit how bad things are first before we can set about fixing them, okay
[48:32.640 --> 48:39.640]  We are bought and paid for by international crime syndicates, period
[48:39.640 --> 48:47.640]  And they don't care about you and your children and your future, in fact, it's the opposite
[48:47.640 --> 48:54.640]  They want to extinct anyone who can stand on their own two feet, they want to destroy a middle class
[48:54.640 --> 49:00.640]  They openly want to destroy the family, and they've done one hell of a job
[49:00.640 --> 49:06.640]  What was illegitimacy? It was like five, six percent, sixty something years ago
[49:06.640 --> 49:17.640]  Now, illegitimacy has passed over the halfway point in the white population, and it's 90 plus percent in the black population
[49:17.640 --> 49:23.640]  They're even cracking the Hispanics who had very low illegitimacy, families very important
[49:23.640 --> 49:28.640]  They're even busting them up right now, what do you say, like twenty-some percent illegitimacy?
[49:28.640 --> 49:33.640]  I mean, this is systematic, this is ruining children's lives
[49:33.640 --> 49:39.640]  And I just can't watch George Bush, he was involved in 9-11 attacks, who killed all those people
[49:39.640 --> 49:45.640]  I can't watch them up there on TV posing as our savior anymore
[49:45.640 --> 49:49.640]  I don't want to watch George Bush senior, I don't want to see David Rockefeller
[49:49.640 --> 49:56.640]  I don't want to look at any of the Henry Kissinger, John Negra Ponte, just all these people
[49:56.640 --> 50:06.640]  These are bad people, these are very, very, very bad people
[50:06.640 --> 50:22.640]  They like what they do, they like the fact that the UN in the third world is really a giant global prostitution trade worth hundreds of millions a year
[50:22.640 --> 50:32.640]  They go to bed and like the power of knowing that they own and control the stuff film industry
[50:32.640 --> 50:38.640]  They like blowing children's heads off with handguns
[50:38.640 --> 50:42.640]  Okay, that's who we're talking about here
[50:42.640 --> 50:48.640]  Do you understand people, much more evil than Jeffrey Dahmer run our country
[50:48.640 --> 50:57.640]  They're so powerful, they're so bored, they're so decadent that they do evil because it's their sacrament
[50:57.640 --> 51:01.640]  I promise, our guest is actually on the third hour
[51:01.640 --> 51:07.640]  And I will go to Jerry and Joe and Jim and Bill and Joe and everybody else
[51:07.640 --> 51:11.640]  When we get back, I'm done
[51:11.640 --> 51:15.640]  And it's not negative what I'm doing here, I'm being positive
[51:15.640 --> 51:22.640]  It's positive to admit just how evil these people are
[51:22.640 --> 51:26.640]  It's positive to face the truth
[51:26.640 --> 51:34.640]  And I want all the government workers to know you work for a system that runs the evil
[51:34.640 --> 51:43.640]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete
[51:43.640 --> 51:51.640]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them
[51:51.640 --> 51:59.640]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence
[51:59.640 --> 52:11.640]  Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more
[52:11.640 --> 52:15.640]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorists
[52:15.640 --> 52:17.640]  It's an anthology of government crimes
[52:17.640 --> 52:21.640]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see

[55:37.640 --> 55:39.640]  I mean she put a letter to the editor

[55:43.640 --> 55:46.640]  You know they told me they put it up that I was having a trouble
[55:46.640 --> 55:49.640]  Oh your signal letter is up but you couldn't see the number

[56:05.640 --> 56:08.640]  I have an attorney and I'll tell you something that's funny
[56:08.640 --> 56:12.640]  This attorney I spoke with the police officer that brutalized her
[56:12.640 --> 56:17.640]  This attorney knows of this man his name is Scott arms a police officer
[56:17.640 --> 56:22.640]  This attorney knows of him he does have a reputation of being not a good man
[56:22.640 --> 56:26.640]  Really so so you contacted a local lawyer for her
[56:26.640 --> 56:27.640]  Yes

[56:39.640 --> 56:40.640]  Thank you
[56:40.640 --> 56:45.640]  Yeah she wrote a letter to the editor and then tried to give them some terror storm and other videos
[56:45.640 --> 56:48.640]  At the library and they decided that was illegal
[56:49.640 --> 56:55.640]  So they came and knocked down her door without a warrant beat her up and are charging her with assaulting them
[56:56.640 --> 56:59.640]  I tell you good old USSR a
[56:59.640 --> 57:02.640]  Let's talk to Joe
[57:03.640 --> 57:05.640]  And Joe what are you calling us from
[57:09.640 --> 57:11.640]  Okay we'll let him go
[57:11.640 --> 57:15.640]  Let's talk to Jim and DC Jim you're on the air go ahead
[57:15.640 --> 57:16.640]  Hey how you doing
[57:16.640 --> 57:17.640]  Good sir
[57:17.640 --> 57:25.640]  Actually I just like to know I'm a kind of a new listener to your program actually Charlie Sheen thing kind of brought me over
[57:25.640 --> 57:31.640]  But I was wanting to know what exactly you think will happen once they issue these ID cards
[57:31.640 --> 57:35.640]  Will you have to give up your driver license or or what
[57:36.640 --> 57:39.640]  I don't know sir they're very slick okay
[57:39.640 --> 57:43.640]  You know how in the Coca-Cola bottling company say if you live in a popular state
[57:44.640 --> 57:48.640]  The the the cans might say Texas or New York on them
[57:49.640 --> 57:51.640]  So it's brand specific to your region
[57:52.640 --> 57:56.640]  Under the National ID card your drivers license is the National ID card
[57:56.640 --> 57:59.640]  It's federally standardized and hooked into a federal database
[58:01.640 --> 58:03.640]  So five years from now when we you know
[58:03.640 --> 58:10.640]  Many years after it's implemented it's already been implemented you'll still be having an arguments with people about I ain't got no National ID card
[58:13.640 --> 58:15.640]  So do you see what I'm saying
[58:15.640 --> 58:16.640]  Yeah
[58:16.640 --> 58:22.640]  If you're looking for them in 2008 with a real ID act that was passed in 2005 that all 50 states have it implemented
[58:23.640 --> 58:30.640]  Number one they pass laws and then put a two or three year number on it to make everybody think oh it's not that bad it's coming
[58:30.640 --> 58:35.640]  We every state has had this implemented for at least two years
[58:35.640 --> 58:36.640]  Okay
[58:36.640 --> 58:40.640]  Then what's this March 2008 vote a law that's coming into
[58:40.640 --> 58:48.640]  That's just some wording they put in saying that the states have to be standardized when when Texas already had been standardized in 1993
[58:54.640 --> 58:55.640]  Wow
[58:55.640 --> 59:00.640]  Look I mean you can I mean I could maybe I'm not being clear. Do you see what I'm saying? Yeah, I understand
[59:00.640 --> 59:05.640]  It's like they say oh a North American Union might be coming. We're already in it
[59:05.640 --> 59:09.640]  Or we may put cameras up the cameras are already been up

[59:27.640 --> 59:32.640]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their spark perky water bottles
[59:32.640 --> 59:33.640]  Why did you do that?
[59:33.640 --> 59:38.640]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing
[59:38.640 --> 59:40.640]  Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
[59:40.640 --> 59:42.640]  For the entire trip
[59:42.640 --> 59:44.640]  Hmm. I didn't think about that
[59:44.640 --> 59:49.640]  Great idea. Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids
[59:49.640 --> 59:53.640]  Bottled water cost around 75 cents above two and a half cents per refill
[59:53.640 --> 59:56.640]  Honey, you're terrific
[59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.640]  Oh, honey, so are you you're the one that bought the family our sport perky water bottles

[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.640]  Big Brother
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.640]  Mainstream media
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.640]  Government cover-ups
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.640]  You want answers?
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.640]  Well, so does he
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.640]  Alex Jones
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:54.640]  Really corrupt global corporations have gotten together and bought off our governments
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:01.640]  And now they're passing laws to take everything you've got from your pension funds to your children
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:06.640]  From the National Graph to the end of our sovereignty as a nation
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.640]  Wide open phones in this second hour. I've also got a bunch of news I will go over
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.640]  We have a big guest destroying world order as his book
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:19.640]  And he's Francis A. Boyle. We had him on a few weeks ago
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.640]  He wrote our biological weapons treaty. He's a big muckity muck, Dr. Boyle
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:29.640]  He'll be talking about how we need to impeach Bush and destroy the new world order
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.640]  But folks at your PTA meeting will tell you there's no new world order
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.640]  They're just announcing it on television, but again, it doesn't exist
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.640]  Your church will say it's of the devil
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.640]  Lay down to it. The world leader is Jesus
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.640]  Take the markets of the Lord
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:49.640]  They've basically gotten to that point now. Pat Robinson and others
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:56.640]  Oh, I think the microchips are fine. I think a thumbprint to do this or that's just wonderful
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.640]  The last caller was asking me a question about, well, wait
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.640]  I hear they're going to issue National ID cards in 2008. How's this going to happen?
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.640]  We have to turn in your license and get one and I was explaining
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.640]  They've already implemented it. It's already in place. It's your driver
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:17.640]  license. It's federally standardized, hooked into the federal data mix
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:23.640]  It is a National ID card. It just has your local state as its brand
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.640]  It's its sector
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.640]  A lot of people are having trouble grasping this. I don't know how to understand why
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.640]  They go, okay, well, then what's the law that's in the way?
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:39.640]  It just says it's the law in the way and that you've got to have one of these
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:44.640]  But for all the purposes you already have to, they've already put it in place
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:49.640]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Bill
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.640]  Bill, what are you calling us from today?
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.640]  Hey Alex, I'm calling from Southern, beautiful Southern Wisconsin. How are you doing?
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.640]  Well, good sir, welcome
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:03.640]  Hey, I just wondered if you had to show your National ID card to get Sudafed for your cold
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:09.640]  Yes, first it started as the corporations were doing it to work with police
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.640]  And then now it's not just Sudafed, it's hundreds of different things
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:19.640]  And now things that don't even have the stuff that could be turned into methamphetamine
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.640]  Now it's just everything they want your ID card
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.640]  And then now they're carting 70-year-old women for cigarettes
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:30.640]  It's all about getting you ready to swipe that driver's license, that National ID card
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.640]  with the National Cell Stocks
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.640]  Yeah, they're just kind of starting to do that with cigarette purchases here in Wisconsin
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:43.640]  I had a couple of comments, first I wanted to thank you for providing DVD copies
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.640]  Or making them freely available to copy
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:52.640]  I've been working locally to go against globally here and making copies of Terrorstorm
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:57.640]  I'd like to also thank your network GCN for streaming on the internet
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:04.640]  Because we don't have any affiliates nearby within your shot on AM Band
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.640]  I think the closest one is your new affiliate in Chicago, we can't pick them up
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:15.640]  So GCN is providing a great service to streaming you all day and all night and all weekend long
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.640]  So people should check that out
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.640]  I use a program on the PC to record your show
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.640]  I know you offer an iPod link on your website
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:30.640]  Windows program called Screamer Radio that I can record your streams and play them on my MP3 player
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.640]  The other thing, I just made some quick notes and I'll be quick
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:39.640]  I wonder, you had your video team out there at that FEMA camp
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.640]  I wonder if we can get a press kit
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.640]  If you have the largest website bigger than Rush Limbaugh as an alternative media
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.640]  I wonder if we could all become media press members
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:58.640]  I have cameras in their faces if you offer some kind of press pass that we could flash at these creeps
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:02.640]  I actually did that about 5, 6, 7 years ago
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:09.640]  The problem is that there's a certain liability associated with it for me
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:14.640]  All the infiltrator would have to do is get a press pass for me and then claim they were working for me
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:19.640]  And then do something that could then cause a litigious action
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:23.640]  There, let's splash this out on the other side
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.640]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.640]  Mighty Film Terror Storm is complete
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:45.640]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.640]  Against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.640]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.640]  But the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.640]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.640]  A White House program to disseminate fake news
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:08.640]  NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.640]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.640]  It's an anthology of government crimes
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:18.640]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see

[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.640]  The statistics are hard-wrenching
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.640]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:42.640]  From the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.640]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.640]  Or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.640]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:56.640]  Who spend their lives protecting our freedom and to those who have lost their lives doing so
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:01.640]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag

[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.640]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.640]  Because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:52.640]  It's a really great idea that the caller was raising and had brought forward before
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.640]  We've done it
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.640]  Yeah folks, if you want to go out and shoot video
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.640]  And you want to go out and do news reports
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.640]  And you want to send them to us, we'll upload them
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:06.640]  To christenplina.com and infowars.com
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.640]  And in the future I'm going to have a system
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.640]  We're working on it now
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.640]  It should be ready in about 10,000 years, I'm joking
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.640]  To really bring all the alternative media
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:25.640]  Not so much together, but just a platform
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:31.640]  To get information out to people in one place
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.640]  To mirror a lot of things that are already out there
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.640]  But bring it all together in one place
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.640]  So basically duplicate, but then accentuate
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.640]  Well you'll see in the next few months what we're talking about
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.640]  But real quick, anything else you wanted to add there?
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.640]  Yes sir, I have a few more items
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.640]  Okay, go ahead because we've got to move quick
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:57.640]  Okay, I would suggest you call your vision terror tube
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:01.640]  You could offer bandwidth and space for people to upload
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.640]  These rogue cops pulling people over
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.640]  Terror tube
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.640]  You could patent that from Bill in Wisconsin
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.640]  People will grab it all up right now
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.640]  And I probably wouldn't use that term
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.640]  We've got a name
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.640]  I've got a couple of quick more things
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:21.640]  I would suggest also that maybe he could be the frontman
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:25.640]  For perhaps funding with his book revenues
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.640]  A legal fund that you would provide to people
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.640]  That are getting scarp sued by CPS
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.640]  Who won't have you come
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.640]  We could have billions of dollars
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.640]  It would be exhausted in a matter of years
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.640]  You can't do it all man
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.640]  You can't run a giant news system
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.640]  And you can't protect everybody from the CPS
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.640]  And I appreciate your call
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.640]  I mean I understand you want to help people
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.640]  But everybody thinks that I somehow
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.640]  I mean I can barely do this show today
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.640]  I'm sick but I'm in here doing it
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.640]  Because I don't want to miss a show
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.640]  My wife just called earlier and said
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.640]  You need to go to rebroadcast
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:05.640]  You sound like garbage
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.640]  I got an important guest on the next hour
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.640]  And I want you to be able to hear him
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.640]  Let's go ahead and
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.640]  Listen I'm not poo pooing what you were saying caller
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.640]  I'm just saying man
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.640]  Judge Napolitano from his book sales
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.640]  Could fund a...
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.640]  That guy probably makes maybe a few hundred thousand dollars
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.640]  Off a hit book
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.640]  And that doesn't buy very much
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.640]  Again, it's all of us
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.640]  Individually outdoing things
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.640]  Like more important than you know
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.640]  Alex Jones building some amperature
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.640]  To post everybody's videos
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.640]  When that already exists
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.640]  I go out and we shoot the video
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.640]  And we make productions for you
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.640]  Productions we sell
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.640]  Productions we give away
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.640]  We try to balance it to catch twenty-two
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:01.640]  But let's say I had some YouTube website
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.640]  It wouldn't be anything without you
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.640]  Going on and getting content
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:13.640]  Alright, let's go ahead and
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.640]  Talk to Joe in New York
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.640]  Here on the air, welcome
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.640]  Thanks Alex, what a great guy I am
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.640]  The reason I'm calling is I have a little method I use
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:23.640]  To help spread the word
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.640]  And I'm thinking if everybody else does this
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.640]  We can reach tons of people
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.640]  I have a lot of family and friends
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.640]  That don't want to hear about the New World Order
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:31.640]  They think I'm crazy
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.640]  But they spend all the time sending out these little
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.640]  Email stories
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.640]  The government's corrupt
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.640]  They think I'm crazy
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.640]  The government wouldn't do that to us
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.640]  So they send out these little cute stories
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.640]  And little poems and things on the email
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:44.640]  And I just used to delete them
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.640]  Because it was a waste of time
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.640]  But now I use them to my advantage
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.640]  For instance, the last one that came across
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.640]  Was a little poem about this girl
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.640]  Her daddy died in a roadside bomb
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.640]  It was just pure propaganda for the war
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.640]  But it was Brigadier's school day
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.640]  And she showed up alone
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.640]  And she went and stood up in front of the class
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.640]  And told why her daddy wasn't there
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.640]  So I changed it to say that her daddy died
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.640]  For his office in the New World Trade Center
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.640]  On 9-11
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.640]  And then at the end of the email
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.640]  It says pass the sign to 10 people
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.640]  And get good luck and all this
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.640]  So I changed the ending to say
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.640]  Go visit infowars.com
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.640]  And receive good luck
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.640]  Or go to Google Video
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.640]  And watch it
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:24.640]  A lot of that pro-war stuff is sitcom
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.640]  Oh, here's a great story
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.640]  Of how the great warriors die
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.640]  And how it's a great sacrifice
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.640]  Pass it on and get good luck
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.640]  Now pass it on and be part of propaganda
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.640]  I mean, and they admit folks,
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.640]  Simcom is all over the web
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:40.640]  And they spent billions of dollars
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.640]  With fake news
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.640]  I mean, most of the people attacking us
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.640]  On blogs and posts
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.640]  You'll see the same guys
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.640]  Under different names
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.640]  Seeing the exact same thing
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.640]  On thousands, literally
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.640]  Of posts and blogs
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.640]  And people now see right through it
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.640]  It's almost, in fact
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.640]  It's almost like it's been bad
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.640]  Because, I mean, obviously
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.640]  It's bad they're out doing it
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.640]  But people waking up completely to it
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.640]  Is almost bad
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.640]  Because now they think
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.640]  Anybody criticizing those of us
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.640]  That fight the New World Order is a shell
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.640]  And they're not all
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.640]  And I want to be able to have real debates
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:14.640]  And we get things wrong
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.640]  And we deserve to be attacked sometimes
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.640]  And that's fine, I don't care
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.640]  The point is now
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.640]  Anybody that attacks me is instantly
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.640]  Or anybody else is instantly a fad
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.640]  Because when you got 1.8 billion
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.640]  In just a two-year period of fake news
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.640]  Large portions of it to buy reporters
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.640]  And buy fake blogs
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.640]  And Walmart and Microsoft have got
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.640]  A piece, thousands of fake blogs
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.640]  That was in the news yesterday again
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.640]  You know, it gets to the point of
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:44.640]  I mean, I don't think this government
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.640]  Realizes how discredited they are
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.640]  Go ahead, Colin
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.640]  Well, I just want to say
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.640]  Everyone did this
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.640]  Every single email they got
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:52.640]  Even if at the very end
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.640]  They just say go to Google Video
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.640]  And watch Terror Storm
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.640]  Or go to Google Video
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:57.640]  And watch Freedom the Fascism
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.640]  Or just put infowars.com
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.640]  At the end of every email
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.640]  It's just going to start to sink in
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.640]  I've had people coming back later
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.640]  And say, you know, after a month of this
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.640]  They got fed up
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.640]  And I checked it out
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.640]  And, you know, now they're believing
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.640]  A little bit, you know
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:08.640]  They say, I can't believe it
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.640]  Good job
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.640]  So if everyone did that
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.640]  And everyone's saying, Alex, do this
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.640]  Alex, do that
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.640]  Well, what if we all do something
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.640]  If every single email you send out
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.640]  You put Visit Terror Storm
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.640]  Or I'm sorry
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:18.640]  Visit infowars.com at the end of it
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.640]  It just helps spread the word
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.640]  Thank you, I appreciate that
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.640]  You know, I do this show
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.640]  Excuse me
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.640]  Again, for stations
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.640]  I apologize
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:30.640]  I probably shouldn't have done the show
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.640]  I'm sick
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:32.640]  I didn't want to stand up
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:33.640]  Our big guests
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:34.640]  We've got the next hour
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.640]  And I am
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.640]  And the reason I'm announcing each hour
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.640]  That I'm sick on air
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.640]  Is in case people think
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.640]  I've had my brain sucked out
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.640]  Or something
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:44.640]  I'm just, you know
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.640]  A whole stifling coughing fit here
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.640]  And I don't know
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.640]  I might punch out 30 minutes
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:52.640]  Into the next hour
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:53.640]  Or just have the guests on 30 minutes
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:56.640]  Because I'm earrakes kicking up
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640]  A bit here
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.640]  Hard to think
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:04.640]  But hold on
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:12.640]  Going back to what the caller was just saying
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.640]  I've described this to my wife
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:14.640]  I've never really described this on air
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.640]  But it's like this
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.640]  It's like we're climbing a mountain range
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.640]  In the fight against the New World Order
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.640]  And years ago
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.640]  We were in the foothills
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.640]  And it was just gentle little slopes
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:33.640]  And it was a picturesque, you could say
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:37.640]  And really a lot of people weren't listening to us
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.640]  But now we've gotten the point
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.640]  The alternative media movement
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.640]  The truth movement
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:44.640]  The patriot movement
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.640]  It's all an amalgamation
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.640]  People who don't buy the fraud
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.640]  We've gotten now to where we're on
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.640]  The next to the biggest peak
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.640]  And we've just got to go down
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:57.640]  This peak a little bit
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.640]  And then back up
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.640]  And we'll be at the summit
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.640]  Of the tallest mountain in this range
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:09.640]  I mean, in my own info war
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:14.640]  In my own gauge of things
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.640]  Financially, I'm a failure
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.640]  What they tell you is valuable
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:23.640]  What they tell you is a measure of success
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.640]  The zeros and ones you've got in a bank account
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.640]  I mean, for the size my websites are
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.640]  They should be making tens of millions of dollars a year
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:32.640]  But they don't
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:35.640]  Because they're going to make a fraction of a million
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:40.640]  Because they aren't geared to that
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.640]  And whatever does come in
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.640]  Is just put back into the business
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:47.640]  But if you measure it as a success
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:50.640]  Of reaching people in an information war
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.640]  What the government would call propaganda
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:58.640]  It is wildly successful
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.640]  I mean, one would think that it would be hard
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.640]  To start out with an access TV show
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.640]  Do a radio show
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.640]  Get a syndicated radio show
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.640]  Do thousands of radio interviews
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.640]  Go to every hill and mountain basically
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:11.640]  And try to warn the people
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.640]  And just in my little life
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:20.640]  I've had a huge effect
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:23.640]  Now, it's an incredible growth rate
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.640]  And so if you look at where we're at
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.640]  We're at the next to highest peak
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.640]  I mean, if we go up one more level
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:34.640]  In the scale of media
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:39.640]  It'll be the biggest thing there is
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.640]  And I'm just one ship
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.640]  Out here engaging the New World Order
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:48.640]  In a naval battle basically
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.640]  If you can picture it like that
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.640]  We need you to realize that
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.640]  If you put your bass boat in the Mara
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.640]  A year from now it might be a battleship
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.640]  Or an aircraft carrier
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.640]  There are people smarter than I am
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.640]  A lot more well spoken
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.640]  Who should be out fighting the New World Order
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.640]  Than you know about it
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.640]  But you're afraid
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.640]  Or you don't see that as your position
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:12.640]  You know, we've all been taught
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.640]  Oh, it's for the hero to do
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.640]  It's for somebody else to do
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.640]  It's for that guy to do
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.640]  And we're not going to win
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:24.640]  In a fight where it's just a few of us
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:25.640]  Out there doing it
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.640]  And you know, the 12 years or so
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:29.640]  I've been on air
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.640]  If you compare it to the effect that
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:36.640]  A film like Luciane's Second Edition had
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:39.640]  That is conservatively
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:42.640]  Then downloaded over 40 million times
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.640]  Everybody stuck with a number
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.640]  From eight, nine months ago
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.640]  You're on 10 million or whatever
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.640]  I mean, that just shows
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.640]  What the alternative media can do
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.640]  And it shows what Dylan Avery
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.640]  When he was 22, what is he, 23 now?
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.640]  Can do
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:07.640]  And it shows what you can do
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:11.640]  And it shows what you need to do
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.640]  Look, you need to believe that we can beat them
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.640]  You need to know
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.640]  They're scared of us
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.640]  They can't control the truth
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.640]  And they're not going to control the truth
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:26.640]  We're going to get them
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:31.640]  They're going to hang
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:34.640]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.640]  Dirty bombs, fallout, biological attacks
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.640]  Anthrax and the top of the all off
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.640]  Duct tape and plastic
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.640]  Alarming words for our time
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.640]  How do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.640]  The video sheltering in place
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.640]  Surviving acts of terrorism
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.640]  From biological, chemical and radioactive fallout
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.640]  Was developed by Wayne LaBeurin
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.640]  A health physicist who has served as a specialist
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.640]  In environmental health, communicable diseases
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:58.640]  And has worked as a nuclear specialist
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.640]  For the U.S. government
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.640]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:03.640]  It's presented by a housewife

[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.640]  The United States seems to be celebrating
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.640]  Over its triumph of reducing government debt
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.640]  But the truth be told, public and private debt
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:41.640]  Increased to a record high in 1999
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.640]  Reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:46.640]  Marking 10.57% annual increase
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.640]  Outpacing its previous 10 years
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.640]  The economy receives its currency
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.640]  By taking on debt through private banking
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.640]  Institution called the Federal Reserve System
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:57.640]  In the year 2000, debt growth
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.640]  Collapsed to only 4.5%
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.640]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.640]  Is bound by debt in order to have commerce
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:05.640]  However, shocking the economy
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.640]  With the reduction of this magnitude
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.640]  Could wipe out years of growth

[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.640]  And depression are driven by outstanding debt

[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:49.640]  Made the way to fly
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:26:14.640]  They wait again and that's you
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:39.640]  Some folks are born
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:43.640]  Made the way to fly
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:45.640]  Okay, I'm going to go to your calls
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.640]  In the next seconds we have plenty of time
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:49.640]  To get to everybody
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.640]  Tim and Kim and Joe and Paul and Ron
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.640]  And everybody else told for a number to join us
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:56.640]  On this already fourth day of the new year
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.640]  January 4th 2006
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.640]  On the Saddam story
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.640]  Everything about the New World Order
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.640]  Is done in a gangsterish way
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.640]  You know the Nazis for their fancy black uniforms
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.640]  And gangsterish air
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.640]  And Stalin just radiated gangsterishness
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.640]  And Mao to a certain extent
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.640]  But there is no Iraqi government folks
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.640]  The Iraqi government doesn't exist
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.640]  It runs absolutely nothing
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:31.640]  They don't even have one brigade
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.640]  Of Iraqi National Guard
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.640]  Not one that can operate
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.640]  Okay, trash is not picked up
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.640]  They get power now in Baghdad
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.640]  About three hours a day
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.640]  Most of the cities in the country
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.640]  Have no power
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:51.640]  No power unless it is a local government building
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:54.640]  That runs off generators
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:57.640]  And it's been carried out flawlessly
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.640]  George Bush and his controllers
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:03.640]  Have executed exactly as they said they would
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:06.640]  And 650 plus thousand are dead
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:09.640]  That number is three or four months old
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:14.640]  Just in the last three and a half years
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:18.640]  And so you look at Saddam Hussein
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.640]  I've read two books on Saddam Hussein
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.640]  One book against him, one book for him
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:27.640]  One was neutral and the other was a hit piece
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.640]  I should say
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:34.640]  And I've read the different university papers on him
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:35.640]  I read a couple the other night
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:38.640]  I wanted to make sure I really had refreshed myself
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.640]  So I knew what I was talking about
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.640]  And my memory did serve me
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.640]  He was an orphan
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:50.640]  And he got scooped up by the intelligence services
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:52.640]  Within weeks
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.640]  Because he had high test scores
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.640]  And was very smart
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.640]  And as many politicians have said
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:02.640]  He projected a zen calmness
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.640]  He was, this is an alpha male
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.640]  You know you're around those type of people
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.640]  This person just radiates confidence
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:12.640]  Not false confidence
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:16.640]  And so the CIA recruited him
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.640]  And they led him to the path to power
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.640]  In 79 he became the dictator
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:22.640]  And he followed orders
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:24.640]  He attacked Iran and everything he was supposed to
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.640]  But he wanted to be seen as a leader
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.640]  He was a real leader
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.640]  Certainly a butcher compared to our leaders
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.640]  He was a choir boy
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:35.640]  And of course our government helped him do the butchering
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.640]  And helped orchestrate all of it
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.640]  Until 91 and stuff after that he did
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:47.640]  But it's just so hypocritical and sick
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.640]  To watch our government crance around
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.640]  How about how they killed somebody who was really bad
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:54.640]  When the guy was doing it
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.640]  And when the guy was set up
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.640]  But what separated Saddam Hussein
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:00.640]  From the elite we have
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.640]  This is how they set him up
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:04.640]  Well I'll tell you
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:06.640]  My check on it
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.640]  Briefly we'll get back
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:10.640]  And we'll go straight to your calls
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.640]  I'm Alex Jones
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.640]  We're on the march
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.640]  The Empire's on the run
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:32.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:33.640]  I found this company online
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:35.640]  And they had this really unique variety
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:36.640]  Of salt wellness products
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:37.640]  I read some of the articles
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.640]  And ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:41.640]  According to the company
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:42.640]  They said that the salt crystal lamps
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.640]  Gently purify indoor air
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:45.640]  I was so amazed
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.640]  I put it in the baby's room
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:48.640]  And it made a perfect night light
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.640]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:55.640]  Solay Wellness.com is a unique company
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:56.640]  That offers salt wellness products
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:57.640]  From around the world
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:58.640]  So I went back to the site
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.640]  And ordered their Solay simple
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.640]  Natural cleaning products
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:02.640]  Also made with Himalayan salt
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:04.640]  I figured it would clean really well
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:05.640]  The natural cleaning products
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:08.640]  Worked wonderfully and there was no scent
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:09.640]  This company has so many products
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:10.640]  My whole family can enjoy
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.640]  And feel better with
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:14.640]  Plus the service was great
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:15.640]  If you're interested in natural
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:17.640]  Homeopathic time-tested remedies
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.640]  Visit Solay Wellness.com
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.640]  That's S-O-L-A-Y-WELNESS.COM
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:26.640]  Or call 312-224-2710
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:31.640]  312-224-2710
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.640]  Shelly, you're like a...
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.640]  Oh wait, why did you turn that down?
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:37.640]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.640]  I'm sure the bed fan works
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.640]  But that squeaky voice
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:42.640]  Well, what's the bed fan?
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.640]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:45.640]  Stay cool at night
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:46.640]  I think it's something like that
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:48.640]  This menopause thing is really getting
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:49.640]  To me at night
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:50.640]  And you know how I am
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.640]  About doing that hormone therapy thing
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.640]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:55.640]  You're always throwing the covers off
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:56.640]  In the middle of the night
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:57.640]  I guess you're right
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:58.640]  Why don't we try it?
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:31:59.640]  Just think how nice it'll be
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:00.640]  To sleep through the night
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.640]  Yeah, just think how nice it'll be
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:03.640]  This summer
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:04.640]  And all the money we can save
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:05.640]  On air conditioning
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:06.640]  I know where we can get
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:07.640]  Some more information

[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.640]  Recommend that you must stay cool
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:11.640]  To get a good night's sleep

[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:22.640]  The bed fan is the answer

[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:32.640]  Hello, Ted Anderson
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.640]  Listeners of the network are familiar
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.640]  With the Federal Reserve note
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:37.640]  And understand the risks of deficit spending
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.640]  Therefore, with catastrophic events
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:41.640]  It comes as no surprise that some banks
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:42.640]  Have currently placed limits
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.640]  On the amount of cash depositors
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:45.640]  Can remove from their accounts
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.640]  A fractional reserve system means
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.640]  Only a small portion of your deposit
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.640]  Is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.640]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:55.640]  If the government is forced to
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:57.640]  Ensure deposits during a bank run
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:58.640]  Followed by a depressed economy
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.640]  A current effort is underway by the Fed
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:02.640]  Along with other central banks
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:04.640]  To increase liquidity for depositors
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.640]  However, an increase in money supply
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.640]  Without equal expansion and productivity
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:09.640]  Can cause inflation
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:11.640]  In order to achieve strength and stability
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:13.640]  I recommend a conservative portion
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.640]  Of all investments to be calmly
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:17.640]  Repositioned into gold and silver
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:18.640]  While paper investments
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:20.640]  Currently have been driven by debt
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.640]  Gold on its own has held value
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:24.640]  For over 6,000 years
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:25.640]  For more information call
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.640]  1-800-686-2237
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:54.640]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:59.640]  Alright
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:03.640]  Welcome back
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:05.640]  Alright, to understand what happened
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.640]  With Saddam Hussein
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:09.640]  We need to go back to the fact
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:12.640]  That in the early 1920s
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:15.640]  What is Iraq today
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:19.640]  Was really three different tribal regions
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:22.640]  The Sunni in the central areas
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:24.640]  Chiite in the south
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:29.640]  And in the north, the Kurds
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:33.640]  And they always warned with each other
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:36.640]  But it was almost ritualistic
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.640]  It happened every few decades
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.640]  I've actually done a brief study of that
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.640]  History's so big and you can't be
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.640]  An expert on history folks
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.640]  You're always a student
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:51.640]  And basically what happened was
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:54.640]  The British came in
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:56.640]  Anglo-American oil
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.640]  Standard oil
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.640]  And I forget the name of the
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:02.640]  We have trouble pronouncing it
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.640]  The French oil company
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:07.640]  And they divided the country
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.640]  Well they created the country
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.640]  But then still along sectarian lines
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.640]  And racial lines
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.640]  You call it ethnic or tribal lines
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:17.640]  Really the same genetics, same people
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.640]  Kept the original borders
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.640]  That had been in the region
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:25.640]  But drew a line around Iraq
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.640]  And it made it one country
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:32.640]  And they put a Saudi king
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:38.640]  In over them
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.640]  And there was unbelievable slaughter
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:47.640]  That kicked off through that period
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:50.640]  Then in the late 50s
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.640]  Some socialists got control
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:55.640]  And kind of restored order
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:57.640]  And there was sectarian killing going on then
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:00.640]  Nothing on the scale you're seeing now
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:05.640]  And then they decided to send in Saddam
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:07.640]  And a bunch of other assassins at the U.S. train
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:10.640]  This is on record and we're talking UPI AP
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.640]  In the 80s this was all in the news
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.640]  Oh Saddam's a great guy, we trained him, he's good
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.640]  And he did go in
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.640]  And they did take over
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:22.640]  And of course he really did do things like
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.640]  He'd have 65 people in a big conference room
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.640]  When he's the head of Baptist security
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.640]  In 79
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.640]  And he says 25 of you are traitors
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:37.640]  And take them out and have them shot
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.640]  And the rest of you aren't traitors
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.640]  But historians have looked at it
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:44.640]  And it looks like they really were
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:46.640]  Working for the West
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.640]  And they really were
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:50.640]  What you could call traitors
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.640]  I'm not defending having them all taken out and shot
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.640]  I mean Saddam
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.640]  Saddam was a quote bad guy
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:00.640]  It's just compared to Hosni Mubarak today
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.640]  See all his slaughtering and killing
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.640]  And torture camps have kept real quiet
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:06.640]  His persecution of Christians has kept quiet
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:09.640]  All the things these puppets that have been installed
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:11.640]  That's all kept quiet and it's all Saddam
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:13.640]  And he's a new Adolf Hitler
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:16.640]  And he is no Adolf Hitler
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.640]  Saddam tried to get everybody to get along with each other
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:26.640]  And he took that country from a backward third world nation
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.640]  To a first world nation with 60%
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:33.640]  Of their graduates being women
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:37.640]  No more burkas
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.640]  No more having to cover their faces
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:45.640]  He was modernizing it had become a tourist destination
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:50.640]  And he was obsessed with giving people land and property
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.640]  And I mean not putting people on welfare
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:55.640]  Actually setting them up
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:59.640]  He thought the state could infuse a free market
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:02.640]  And then make them a dynamo
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:05.640]  Now he was still very friendly with the West
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.640]  And they were encouraging him
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:09.640]  And plus he didn't like the Persians
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:15.640]  And so he was encouraged to attack him and he did
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:18.640]  And it's on record that our government gave him the satellite
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:20.640]  The weather reports, the advice told him
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.640]  Go ahead and nerve gas him
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:25.640]  He was starting to lose the war with the Iranians
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:27.640]  They had three times the troops he had
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.640]  And they were better equipped
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.640]  And the globalists were playing with two off against each other
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:38.640]  Trying to make both nations weak
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:45.640]  And that's why the new old order didn't like Saddam
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:47.640]  At the end of the Iran-Iraq war
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:49.640]  Because he was seen as a strong Arab leader
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:51.640]  He was admired
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.640]  And he kind of stabbed them in the back for putting him in
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.640]  And said now I'm not buddies with Israel
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.640]  I'm going to be a leader and we're going to be first world
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:02.640]  And then the West came back and said
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.640]  Okay we'll be friends with you
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:06.640]  And by the way go ahead and invade Kuwait if you want to
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.640]  Because they were slant-drilling
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.640]  He was trying to pay off the debts
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:14.640]  And so that's why they took him out
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:18.640]  Same reason they took out Suleyman Molozovic
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:20.640]  Who certainly wasn't perfect
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.640]  But compared to what the Muslims and Croats did
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:25.640]  And please folks, I know Croats are nice people in the US
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:27.640]  So are Muslims, I'm not trying to get in fights with you
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:31.640]  I'm not a Croat, I'm not a Muslim, I'm not a Serb
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:33.640]  I really looked at the history
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:37.640]  And the Serbs did about a third of the killing
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:40.640]  That the Croats and the Muslims who teamed up
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:42.640]  By the way with the Nazis in World War II
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:44.640]  Against the Serbs who helped us
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:47.640]  That's what they get for helping us and saving our airmen
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:50.640]  They didn't like the fact they had big minds all over the country
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.640]  They were making high quality aircraft and trains and engines
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.640]  It was becoming first world, a big holiday destination for Europeans
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:01.640]  Europe!
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:05.640]  So the EU did not like the modernization programs
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.640]  Of Suleyman Molozovic
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:10.640]  Trying I guess to be a new Tito
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:15.640]  Who certainly wasn't perfect but compared to
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.640]  The point is the globalists want to remove these people
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:22.640]  They want to remove anybody who's a nationalistic
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.640]  And who really wants to
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:26.640]  Saddam really wanted
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:28.640]  Suleyman Molozovic really wanted
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:32.640]  To modernize their countries and to be liked by the population
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.640]  It's the same thing with Jack Kennedy
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:36.640]  Cut taxes by half, he was a hawk
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:38.640]  He woke up to the fact they were scaring him
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.640]  They blew his head off
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:42.640]  He gave speeches about a conspiracy
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:45.640]  To take over America, great evil, we played it here
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:47.640]  They killed him
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:49.640]  I mean there are people who get into the positions of power
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:52.640]  Who really want to try to help their people
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:54.640]  And Saddam to do that
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:57.640]  He would say I'm not going to allow sectarian violence to break out again
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:01.640]  That we've had for 60-something years there
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:05.640]  I'm talking about the 80s now, 60 years back
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:07.640]  That was his excuse to do it
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.640]  That's always the road to tyranny
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.640]  When you're doing these evil things for the betterment down the road
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:17.640]  But it turned out that overall it did make Iraq a better place
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:21.640]  And it did reduce the numbers of killings and things that happened
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:24.640]  That's why the court proceedings that were totally run by our military
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:27.640]  And the US government, they fired judges and killed
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:30.640]  Four of Saddam's lawyers, remember all that?
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:33.640]  That's why they didn't want to prosecute him for the nerve-gassing
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:37.640]  And then they made him put a 20-minute delay
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:40.640]  On all the Saddam court transmissions
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:43.640]  Because he kept bringing all that up
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:46.640]  And court observers would see him talk about that
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.640]  And then they'd walk out the street and get gunned down
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:50.640]  So they wouldn't talk to the media
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:52.640]  I mean that's your fair trial
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:53.640]  That's why you have fair trials
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:55.640]  Sure, Saddam's a bad guy
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.640]  And did some bad things
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:03.640]  But you always have a trial so other people are involved with
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:06.640]  And so the full facts of the case come out
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:09.640]  So the people can be informed
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:13.640]  And boy, the public learned what was really done to Saddam
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:15.640]  What was really done to the Iraqi people
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.640]  And how hypocritical it was
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:23.640]  Then you wouldn't see people cheering him hanging from the neck until dead
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:28.640]  But a picture tells a thousand words
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:32.640]  And that two-minute video of them hanging him tells a million
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:36.640]  I mean you have just mafia style thugs directly
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.640]  Saddam directly handed over to them
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:42.640]  And they were trying to get a rise out of him
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:44.640]  And he knew exactly what they were doing
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:47.640]  And in the end he beat them
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:52.640]  In the end, he was dignified
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.640]  And to everyone, everybody saw really the spirit of this
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:02.640]  The spirit of this whole thing was a bunch of thugs in black masks
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:07.640]  Hanging a U.S. government agent
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:10.640]  Who had broken away from the New World Order
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:13.640]  And who really tried to bring stability and free market
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:19.640]  And education for Sunni, Shiite, and Kurd
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:24.640]  And that's why they killed him
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:28.640]  And that's why they went in and took him down
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:32.640]  But there's always going to be that lasting image
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:36.640]  That really showed the mafioso thuggishness
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:41.640]  And it showed everybody in a room full of killers
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:47.640]  Who the gutterschnipes were
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.640]  And it showed who the cowards were
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:53.640]  They were freaking out like a bunch of brain dogs
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:57.640]  They were, you know, they were pleasuring themselves
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:01.640]  At the prospect of murdering, of killing
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:06.640]  And it just illustrated
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:12.640]  I mean, Iraq is hundreds of times worse
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:16.640]  Than it was in 1990
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.640]  This is an extermination program
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:22.640]  Going on as they wreck Iraq
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:26.640]  And basically leave no stone unturned
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.640]  In taking that place back to Cavemanville
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:34.640]  And that is the state of Israeli
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:44.640]  And U.S. policy is the global Balkans
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:47.640]  Balkanization, divide and conquer
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:49.640]  And the U.S. is being Balkanized
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:53.640]  The same people that pulled the strings
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:56.640]  To drop Saddam through that trapdoor
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:59.640]  And break his neck
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:02.640]  Are the same people that have devalued your dollar
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:04.640]  Premeditatedly
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:06.640]  They're the same people dissolving your border
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:08.640]  They're the same people that want to shoot you up
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.640]  With flu vaccine
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:13.640]  With five times the safe levels of mercury in it
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:16.640]  They're the same people that are spraying
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:18.640]  Our food and water with poison
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:22.640]  They're the same people putting poison into our bodies
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.640]  They're the same people and then they're in control
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.640]  Because they are the most evil, they brag about it
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:31.640]  They're the most far-looking, they're the most maniacal
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:35.640]  And we as a people need to understand
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.640]  The threat is not in Iran
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.640]  The threat is not in Iraq
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:43.640]  The threat is in London, in New York
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:47.640]  And in Berlin, and in Paris
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:50.640]  And in Moscow, and in Tel Aviv
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.640]  And in Beijing, and in Tokyo
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:46:02.640]  The threat is this elite working together
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:08.640]  To weaken the people and make it more easy to manage
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:12.640]  And so all these good old boys cheered
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:15.640]  And got just excited about the killing of Saddam
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:17.640]  It was like a personal power for them
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.640]  And again, I could...
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:22.640]  Saddam Hussein deserved to die
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:24.640]  But he's like...
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:27.640]  There's like a million people in front of him who were worse
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:29.640]  Who also deserve to die
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.640]  And that's why I'm for the death penalty
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:34.640]  I believe in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:40.640]  But I don't believe that it should be in effect today
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:44.640]  Because we know that around a third of the people in the prisons are innocent
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:47.640]  And we know this government's so criminal
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:52.640]  That they're not even...
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:57.640]  Qualified to clean toilets
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.640]  To be a toilet attendant
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:02.640]  And so...
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:04.640]  Ah, let's go to your calls
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:06.640]  I'll quit babbling
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.640]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.640]  Who's up first, Tim?
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.640]  Tim, Kim, and those...
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:13.640]  Okay, Tim, go ahead
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:14.640]  Hello, Alex
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:15.640]  Hi
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:17.640]  First of all, I'll have a green mile
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:19.640]  I'm trying to pull that sickness out of you
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:21.640]  I got sick myself
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:23.640]  I was watching this congress coordination
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:26.640]  I got to call Alex and tell him about this article
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:30.640]  I found in the purveyor of Propaganda Time Magazine
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:31.640]  December issue
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:32.640]  Building...
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.640]  How to build the 21st century
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.640]  Just, you know...
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:41.640]  It's about the public brainwashing system, of course
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:43.640]  And they actually mentioned loose change in there
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:44.640]  And I wanted to call and tell you about it
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:46.640]  But a couple of other...
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:49.640]  What were they saying concerning loose change
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.640]  In education?
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:52.640]  I'll read you the paragraph about it
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:54.640]  They're talking about these pilot schools
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.640]  That they have to get these...
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:58.640]  It's mentioned in this one paragraph
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:47:59.640]  Let me read it to you
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.640]  The juniors in Bill Stout's class
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.640]  Are riveted by a documentary called
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:06.640]  Loose Change
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:08.640]  Unspooling on a small TV screen
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:12.640]  At the Baccalaureate School for Global Education
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.640]  In urban Australia, New York
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:16.640]  The film uses 9-11 footage
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:18.640]  And interviews with building engineers
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:20.640]  And Twin Tower supervisors
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:23.640]  To make an oddly compelling, if paranoid case
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:25.640]  That the interior explosions unrelated
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:27.640]  To the impact of the airplanes
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:29.640]  Brought down the World Trade Center
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:30.640]  Oh, really?
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:32.640]  Nist, nist, nist now admits
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:34.640]  That there may have been bombs
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:35.640]  But it's interesting
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:36.640]  They also...
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:37.640]  The authors of this thing
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:39.640]  Who I'm not going to mention
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:43.640]  They have to throw some double-think in there
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:44.640]  And it says
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.640]  Some person finds the video
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:48.640]  More convincing than the official version
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:49.640]  Of the facts
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:51.640]  Another student objected
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:52.640]  Because of a movie
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:54.640]  You are going to change your beliefs
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:55.640]  She demands
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:57.640]  Just because people heard explosions
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:00.640]  Doesn't mean they were explosions
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:02.640]  Now...
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:04.640]  More direct, direct double-think
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:06.640]  Yeah, just because we got fire captains on tape
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.640]  Saying, did you see the...
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:10.640]  A foundry molten steel flowing
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:12.640]  Like a volcano
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:15.640]  That gets back to the theory of cognitive dissonance
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:17.640]  By the way, pull that clip, John
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:19.640]  Go ahead, keep going, Tim
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:21.640]  Oh, it's okay
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.640]  And it says there's this interesting little, little sentence
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.640]  This public elementary school
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:27.640]  Has taken the idea of global education
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:29.640]  And run with it
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:31.640]  Stanford International
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:33.640]  That's the name of the school
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:36.640]  Shows what's possible for a public elementary school
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.640]  But you see the message
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.640]  Globalism is rebellious
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.640]  And showing loose change
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.640]  So see, oh, we can trust the good liberal globalists
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.640]  They let us know the truth
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:48.640]  And then, oh, it's all America's fault
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:49.640]  America was involved
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.640]  America did 9-11
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.640]  And they have support with corporations from...
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:54.640]  You've been listening a long time, Tim
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:56.640]  How long did I say they're going to allow 9-11
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:57.640]  To come out?
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:49:59.640]  They're just going to blame it on the U.S.
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:02.640]  And not explain that the globalists are using the U.S.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:04.640]  Oh, again, we'll have another fake trial
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:06.640]  And hanging here and that will further...
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:08.640]  You know, I think that many times I've asked you
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:09.640]  That same question
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:11.640]  What's going to happen?
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.640]  They're holding off on that
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.640]  And then, yeah, just like you said
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:17.640]  They're going to come out and say, oh, yeah
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.640]  Everybody's right
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:20.640]  They were in on it
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:21.640]  Now we're going to hang on
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:24.640]  We're going to totally take over the rest of what's left of your country
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:27.640]  I hear you and I appreciate your call
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:28.640]  Take care
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:29.640]  Let's play that clip
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:31.640]  Here's New York television
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:33.640]  A firefighter is talking about how it was like
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:37.640]  A foundry of molten steel flowing
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:40.640]  But it wouldn't melt people standing near the hottest fires
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.640]  They could stand there for 20 minutes in the holes
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:46.640]  It was localized heat sources that generated it
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:47.640]  Here it is
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:51.640]  I think he just did it to...
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:52.640]  Who knew?
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:55.640]  To be honest with you, I think he might have thought that was it
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:56.640]  For us, Phil
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:59.640]  You'd get down below and you'd see molten steel
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:01.640]  Molten steel running down the channel
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:03.640]  It's like you're in a foundry
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:04.640]  Yeah
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:07.640]  Like, well, I think it was like a lot from a volcano
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:10.640]  There wasn't a lot of screaming, there wasn't a lot of yelling
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:12.640]  Obviously, there was no machinery
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:13.640]  All right
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:16.640]  It was like a foundry
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:19.640]  Like a volcano
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:24.640]  Oh, yeah, jet fuel melts, giant forfeit around steel
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:27.640]  And turns it into molten steel
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:31.640]  Running down the channel rails
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:38.640]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to different lands
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:40.640]  My new film Terror Storm is complete
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.640]  Shocking, declassified government documents
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:45.640]  Prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:48.640]  Against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:52.640]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:56.640]  But the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:59.640]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:02.640]  A White House program to disseminate fake news
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:05.640]  NSA spy, secret police torture
[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:08.640]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:12.640]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.640]  It's an anthology of government crimes
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:18.640]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see

[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:36.640]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:38.640]  Deep behind enemy lines
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:40.640]  The information war continues
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:44.640]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:48.640]  And I mean, we're behind enemy lines
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:51.640]  The US has been seized as an engine of the world government
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:54.640]  While we take the blame for everything the globalists do
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:56.640]  Using us, we're occupied
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:54:58.640]  Let's continue with your calls
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:00.640]  I got a big guest coming up in the third hour
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:03.640]  Kim in Texas, thanks for holding her on the ear
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:06.640]  Hi Alex, and you were not babbling
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:08.640]  You were teaching
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:11.640]  Everything you said brought back to mind when they
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:13.640]  Attacked Noyager
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.640]  They went after him
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.640]  And this conquer and divide system
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:19.640]  They've been using it since slavery
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.640]  Whether it's religion or a ready
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:24.640]  Or injustices, period
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:26.640]  That's what they're doing in America now
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:28.640]  And we have to look past that
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:31.640]  And I don't understand why in 2007
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:34.640]  We cannot look past these divisions
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:36.640]  That they could put up in front of us
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:38.640]  Barack Obama
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:41.640]  This guy is going to be the worst person
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:43.640]  You could put in as a president
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:45.640]  Barack Obama, I don't trust
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:47.640]  He's for amnesty
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:48.640]  He's for the patriot act
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:50.640]  I spoke to his people
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.640]  Because I have not spoken with him
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:54.640]  I have not
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:55.640]  I've seen his voting record
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.640]  He voted for HR 61662
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:00.640]  Yeah?
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:01.640]  I asked Benny Thomas
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:02.640]  Is he going to get rid of the patriot act?
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:04.640]  One, two and three
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:06.640]  His people said
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:08.640]  Well, he doesn't have a power yet
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:10.640]  Maybe he'll think about it
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:12.640]  No, that's not what he's been
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:13.640]  It's like policy
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:15.640]  Maybe, you know, the people want it
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:17.640]  The CIA's own assessment says
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:18.640]  We'll make you Iraq worse
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:20.640]  And once the Democrats answer
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.640]  We're going to increase the troops
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:24.640]  Yeah, we're going to look at his plan
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:26.640]  What plan he never had
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:28.640]  When there was your campaign slogan
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:30.640]  This man never had a plan
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:32.640]  But all of a sudden you're going to look at it
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:34.640]  That just behooves me
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:36.640]  That the country
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:38.640]  Anybody that's hearing about it
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:40.640]  Anybody there, Hillary, Obama
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.640]  Jeb Bush
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:44.640]  I mean, give me a break
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:47.640]  He's running around the country
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:49.640]  Newt Gennrich said
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.640]  Get rid of the First Amendment
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:51.640]  He's going to run for president
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:52.640]  I mean, they're all bad
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:53.640]  Whoever they stick out in front of us
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:55.640]  Is going to be bad
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:57.640]  I didn't, Governor Perry went again
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:59.640]  I did not understand that election
[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:01.640]  Well, they had so many people
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:05.780]  running and there was a lot of election fraud and the guy was wildly unpopular.
[01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:10.280]  He would have lost if it had been a straight up, you know, if he was running against just
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:11.280]  one candidate.
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:12.280]  Okay.
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:23.320]  I wanted to ask you about, oh, did you really think that was Saddam being hung?
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:26.000]  Well, that's a complex question.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.920]  A lot of people look at the image of the Saddam we saw during the invasion, which obviously
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:36.280]  was one of his many doubles, and he admittedly had eight or nine of them at any one time.
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:40.720]  But I've watched a lot of old videos of Saddam when he was younger and skinnier.
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:46.640]  And the eyes and the nose and a lot of it, it did look like Saddam Hussein.
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:51.200]  And I really don't think they'd want to keep somebody like him around and stage his death.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:58.640]  We know he broke with the New World Order with the globalist in 1991.
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:00.760]  But, you know, that's the problem.
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:04.400]  When the government and the media lies so much in stages, so many things in the past
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:07.600]  we've caught, I don't know, Kim.
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:08.600]  That's a problem.
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:11.200]  You know, we know the government's run by a pack of criminal liars, but a lot of times
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:14.040]  we don't know what the truth is.
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:17.880]  And so, but my gut tells me that was real.
[01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:23.200]  And my gut tells me that was Saddam Hussein and my gut's never been wrong.
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:28.960]  But Alex, let people know, no matter how much insurgency we put out there, no matter how
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:33.120]  many more people, American people die, nothing's going to change.
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:38.240]  It's not going to change our act, whether it's their religious belief or just their
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:40.760]  culture, you're not going to change it.
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:44.240]  Well, look, Kim and I appreciate your call.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:46.520]  The globalists knew the strategy.
[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:51.600]  They knew how to punch the buttons and how to get everybody killing each other.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:55.880]  And that's why they went in and disbanded the military and disbanded the internal security
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:56.880]  apparatus.
[01:58:56.880 --> 01:59:02.320]  Day one, and every expert on the outside said, why are you doing this?
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:03.840]  It's going to make it blow up.
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:06.440]  That's why they had to fire so many generals.
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:09.440]  The generals wanted to do the right thing, too.
[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:11.920]  It's designed to be a climb on it.

[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:48.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:18.200]  I'm Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:42.200]  But that's what I'm after.
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:43.200]  That's what I love.
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:44.200]  And I'm committed.
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:50.080]  I mean, I'm not doing this and working this hard to lose.
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:57.920]  I'm doing everything I'm doing here today because I know that with God's help, we can
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:01.560]  bring these evil people to justice, and I'm so angry at the phony churches telling everybody
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:05.760]  to go to sleep or all going to be raptured, even if that was the case.
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:08.760]  We have a duty to stand up against evil.
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:14.800]  And I'm tired of people standing by and letting the weak and the meek, the women and children,
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:17.680]  especially of this world, be abused by the New World Order.
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:22.560]  They're doing really bad things, and we can change it.
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:29.360]  With slavery in around 1800, in England, people started speaking out against the transatlantic
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:30.360]  slave trade.
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:31.960]  And they were called demons.
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:32.960]  They were called kooks.
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:33.960]  They were laughed at.
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:34.960]  You'll never defeat it.
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:35.960]  You'll never stop it.
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:41.760]  And within just a few decades, they were the majority view, and everyone agreed that it
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:42.760]  should be outlawed.
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:49.560]  And then it took another 50-something years for it to be attacked here.
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:55.640]  The problem is that you already had indentured white servants, you already had sharecroppers,
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:03:01.240]  you already had an underclass system, and that's what power wants, it wants slaves.
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:02.760]  And we're going back into slavery.
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:06.800]  It's just a softer form of slavery.
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:10.720]  It's a more subtle, refined system.
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:21.680]  And in my breast beats a desire to see justice done, beats a desire to see bad people punished.
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:26.680]  And I know that none of us are safe in this current climate.
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:29.760]  My whole family is in grave danger.
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:32.680]  Your family is in grave danger.
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:37.000]  With the people running the planet that we have in control right now, we're all in danger.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.200]  And that's why I'm here.
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:42.160]  So I do want to thank all of our AM and FM affiliates.
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:44.680]  I want to thank the Shorway Affiliate, WWCR.
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:47.520]  I want to thank the Fine Folks, the Genesis Network.
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:50.360]  I want to thank you, the listeners, the sponsors.
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.760]  I want to thank everyone.
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:58.960]  And my great regret in life is that I'm not the best at this job, and I've got plenty
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:02.160]  of problems in foibles.
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:05.680]  And I do plenty of things that are wrong to people.
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:11.200]  But I know you listen because in your gut, we have a connection.
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:14.880]  And you know that I'm sincere.
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:19.480]  And you've checked out a lot of my claims, and you've found out they're true.
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:26.040]  And I want you all to know that I see you as my brothers and sisters.
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:35.720]  And I am humbled every day to think about the fact that in all the paths I could have
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:39.640]  taken in my life growing up, and the experiences I had, the bad things that happened to me
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:46.640]  growing up, the evil things I saw, and some of the bad things I was involved in, that
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:55.560]  that was really God preparing me to not be a fool, and to not be naive, and to be able
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:05:01.920]  to recognize the world we live in, and the things that are happening around us.
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:09.240]  You do count, you do matter, you can affect change.
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:19.040]  You're only alive once, and I want to encourage you to take that first step in that journey
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:21.560]  towards standing up against corruption and evil.
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:28.280]  We'll be right back with our esteemed guests.
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:37.040]  It's year after year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:38.040]  is complete.
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:41.760]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:46.320]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:51.800]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:53.880]  were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:58.160]  Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program that
[02:05:58.160 --> 02:06:04.520]  disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and
[02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:05.520]  much, much more.
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:09.560]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorists.
[02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:11.840]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:16.280]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:34.920]  The war on terrorism, will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:38.640]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:39.640]  shelter.
[02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:40.640]  So what do you do?
[02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:44.360]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or
[02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:45.760]  chemical attacks?
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:48.680]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:52.880]  Sheltering in place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:57.920]  fallout, developed by Wayne LaBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:02.600]  environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for

[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:10.600]  through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:33.760]  Attention, attention everyone, a brand new invention just released.
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:39.160]  It's called RIST Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:44.440]  RIST Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:46.400]  mouse or adding machine.
[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:51.320]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat
[02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:57.720]  in front of your keyboard, RIST Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians
[02:07:57.720 --> 02:08:00.080]  who are constantly on the go.

[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:37.720]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:45.720]  I've got a New York Times report from a couple days ago concerning the new, quote, fringe
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:47.360]  economy.
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:51.840]  I would call it the predatory economy.
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:56.960]  Growth in the economy is in prisons, is in homeland security, is in law enforcement, is
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:04.080]  in short-term loans, pawn shops, check cashing places, you know, loans on your tax return.
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:06.680]  The country's unraveling.
[02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:11.120]  And the system is getting hungrier and hungrier.
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:17.240]  State tuitions and state colleges that I've looked at the ballot sheet some, like UT,
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:22.280]  has 36 billion, I kept saying 24 billion, that was like a 10-year-old number, I've got the
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:26.720]  new ones, 36 billion in cream assets.
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:31.040]  That's not in pension funds, that's not even an investment, it's just in liquid cash accounts,
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:32.920]  but they're boosting tuition again.
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:37.280]  And I don't even know why I'm going off on this rant, it's just another thing I was thinking
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:42.400]  about this morning before I came in to do the show.
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:48.160]  Just how predatory it is, I mean, we've always had organizing forces in government and humanity,
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:52.880]  but a lot of times they've, you know, turned out to at least be for the better.
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:57.960]  Now it's just, every indicator, folks, I have like 10 articles in my stack, okay?
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:04.000]  But I put it last night, this morning, where, again, a four-year-old hugs their teacher,
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:09.160]  they're arrested, it's called sexual harassment, or somebody brings a plastic knife in their
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:14.920]  lunchbox to put cream cheese on a bagel, they're arrested.
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:20.240]  Look at this, folks, this is AP today, and we're going to go to our esteemed guest.
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:26.720]  Young girl facing charges after wedding pants, folks, I have 10 of these today.
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:30.560]  I'm not going to even read them on air.
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:35.560]  I'm scared for my children, they're good children, but they may get in a fist fight
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:42.600]  sometime, they may be sick or wet their pants sometime, something might happen with them.
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:45.600]  And then they're gone, folks, they're in the system.
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:50.320]  Look at this, this is out of Danville, PA, a 12-year-old special education student,
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:55.080]  and it goes on, or mildly retarded, so now 12-year-old retarded children are charged.
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:58.800]  Really it's a system, hungry to fill more beds, to get more people in.
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:02.920]  See, citizens are worth more now in prison than they are outside.
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:07.960]  A 12-year-old special education student in Monitor County was charged with this wordly
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:12.240]  conductive authority, said she deliberately wet her pants at school.
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:15.560]  Her mother told the press enterprise it happens because her daughter was frightened by the
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:16.560]  principal.
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:24.280]  I've had a lot of mammals do that, little puppies when they grovel, they do that, I
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:27.400]  guess when your puppy doesn't send it to prison.
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:30.360]  Her mother told the press enterprise it happened because her daughter was scared.
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:33.840]  The girl had been preparing a holiday lunch with her classmates and teachers at Danville
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.840]  Middle School on December 20th.
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:39.160]  Her mother said when her daughter refused to go to the kitchen to wash her pots and
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:43.760]  pans, teachers summoned Principal Kevin Duckworth, who confronted the girl.
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:48.560]  Then she wet her pants, and she's retarded.
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:50.760]  So now they're going to criminally charge retarded children.
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:57.920]  All right, I'm going to shut up, and I've got literally nine more just like it.
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:03.840]  Children who get off school buses and go to the store to get something to drink instead
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:06.360]  of going right home, get arrested.
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:10.520]  I mean, it's just destroying world order.
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:14.720]  I could talk for hours about our guest biob.
[02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:22.560]  He drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terror Act of 89 and helped draft the UN's Anti-Biological
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:28.760]  Weapons Treaties, and he has worked and advised on the highest levels of the Congress and
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:29.920]  basically done it all.
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:35.640]  He's a doctor, professor, law expert, Francis A. Boyle.
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:36.640]  He's written a bunch of books.
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:39.840]  We have links to websites with his publisher and how you can get them.
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:41.480]  I've read Destroying World Order.
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:42.680]  It's an excellent book.
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:47.680]  If any of us are going to be free human beings, we've got to destroy World Order.
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:50.760]  Dr. Boyle, thanks for coming on with us today.
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:56.160]  Well, thanks for having me on again, and happy new year to all your listeners.
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:57.160]  Just a side issue.
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:02.480]  Do you want to comment on what I was saying about a predatory system, how it's just getting
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:03.480]  crazier and crazier?
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:04.480]  Sure.
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:13.320]  We have 2.2 million Americans in prison, which is the highest rate of incarceration
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:16.000]  per capita basis in the world.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:25.360]  So in other words, as far as the power elite who run this country are concerned, we Americans
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:30.040]  are the most criminal race of people in the world.
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:41.120]  I don't really believe that is true at all, but basically you see a power elite one while
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:51.000]  that instead of giving their people adequate jobs, health care, education, food, clothing,
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:58.880]  housing, prefers to criminalize them and stick them away because it's cheaper that way as
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:01.600]  they say it, and they just don't care.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:10.040]  So you're right, this is business and industry, warehousing, human beings.
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:19.720]  As for children, yes, I started teaching criminal law here, University of Illinois in 1978, when
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:29.560]  we used to have a criminal justice system that was designed for the purpose, not of
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:40.560]  criminalizing children, but trying to reform them, guide and supervise them.
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:45.760]  Starting with the Reagan administration and the DO conservatives who worked for Reagan,
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:51.760]  including Meese, many of the people we see in Washington today, and by the way, Meese
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:15:00.320]  was the legal mentor to Roberts and Alito who were on the Supreme Court, many of the
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:03.440]  other federal judges we see.
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:08.440]  They began to criminalize children, and instead of treating them as children, treating them
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:16.760]  as adults and proceeded to prosecute them, stick them away, rather than guide and help
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:19.280]  them if necessary reform them.
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:23.520]  And they sold it on things that sounded reasonable at first, the litmus test, oh we're just taking
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:28.960]  the Nazis free speech, well it's the same thing here, oh a 14 year old shot his parents,
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:35.280]  he deserves, well yes, that person does deserve if they've got mental faculties, that is a
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:37.040]  serious crime, that is an adult crime.
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:44.640]  But now it's having a plastic Dixie knife for your cream cheese, and you know it doesn't
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:48.400]  matter if you're on the honor roll, we're going to take it, I mean it's just, again,
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:53.680]  this is the, and it's seven plus million in the system, millions behind bars, I'm sorry
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:55.680]  I made you digress there, but it ties in.
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:16:04.160]  Well now there is the international convention on the rights of the child, rights of children.
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:10.680]  Every government, country in the world is a party to it, except the United States and
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:15.200]  Somalia, and Somalia doesn't have a government, of course we don't have a government either
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:21.160]  that is in the interest of the American people, but if you read that convention it sets out
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:26.640]  what everyone in the world believes are the basic human rights of children, and one of
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:34.760]  the basic human rights is not to be subjected to the adult system of criminal justice, and
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:41.200]  their children are defined as human beings under the age of 18.
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:48.200]  So if you really want to see what is the standard for the entire rest of the world except the
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:54.240]  United States and Somalia, you can access that convention online.
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:59.440]  All right, let's shift back into, but I mean I think it's important to set the table of
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:04.400]  the type of atmosphere we're in, the scoring world order, U.S. imperialism in the Middle
[02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:08.680]  East before ever September 11, and then I want to, well you know what, let's start out
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:14.040]  with Saddam, because this is really blown up in their face, give us your analysis on
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:15.040]  it, Dr.
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:24.640]  Yes, we have to understand that this entire show trial was organized directly out of the
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:30.280]  White House, and it had already been reported even in the New York Times, that there was
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:35.120]  a lawyer on the White House staff who was in charge of running the whole thing.
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:41.440]  I can't recall the guy's name, but it's there in the database, Nexus and Nexus, somewhere.
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:51.880]  So for example, the death penalty for him came down just before the November elections.
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:59.040]  The execution itself, the hanging, blinching, I don't know what else you'd call it, was
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:03.080]  designed for political reasons.
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:12.240]  His execution under these circumstances violated the Third Geneva Convention of 1949.
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:20.880]  We had originally designated him as a prisoner of war, which the convention prohibited setting
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:25.240]  up this kangaroo court proceeding that was run out of the White House.
[02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:29.360]  I mean, even the state appointed judges kept quitting and they killed a bunch of Saddam's
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:30.680]  lawyers out in the street.
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:35.400]  I mean, this was a complete joke, people said, well, he doesn't deserve a fair trial.
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:39.720]  The point is, the facts come out, and it would have come out how our government helped him
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:42.880]  and advised him in many of the quote crimes he committed.
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:46.000]  Well, that's right, and that's why it was set up this way.
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:54.520]  The first trial of Dujial, this massacre of Chia's 140 or so, back in 1982, before we
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:19:00.160]  really were involved in many of his major atrocities, although we did encourage him
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:02.680]  to invade Iran.
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:06.040]  They did that in a little one because that was something that was compartmentalized and
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:07.840]  didn't touch the White House.
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:08.840]  That's correct.
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:14.840]  He was now on trial for his atrocities against the Kurds, including the Gassing, and that
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:21.840]  clearly did get into our complicity in helping provide him with both chemical and biological
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:22.840]  weapons.
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:30.440]  So, it was in our interest to kill him off before that trial went forward or any of the
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:31.440]  other trials.
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:39.000]  But, we have to look at it from a broader perspective, I said there was a lawyer directly
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:43.040]  out of the White House running this whole show, was all paid for by the United States
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:47.160]  government, all the investigators, they had an army of 20 lawyers over there running
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:48.160]  this thing.
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:54.240]  And it was basically a combination of a kangaroo court and a Stalinist show trial and it clearly
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:20:01.360]  was going to lead to this execution at a time that was propitious for the Bush people.
[02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:03.760]  Now, let's look at the timing here.
[02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:11.400]  First, we had coming up to 3,000 dead U.S. soldiers in Iraq.
[02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:16.880]  And executing Saddam Hussein was a good way to try to get that out of the press.
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:23.760]  After Dr. Francis Boyle, a global legal expert advisor to Congress, a writer of different
[02:20:23.760 --> 02:20:29.400]  conventions, will come right back to him after the break, please stay with us.

[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:36.360]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all powerful
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:40.720]  one world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority
[02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:45.760]  in Washington, D.C. and therefore bypass the state governments?
[02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:49.720]  That way they would have only one battle to win Washington, D.C.
[02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:55.120]  Have we witnessed the accumulation of power in Washington and bypassing the states over
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:56.120]  the last 50 years?

[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:51.040]  a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:37.400]  Dr. Francis A. Boyle, author of Destroying World Order, U.S. imperialism in the Middle
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:41.720]  East before and after September 11, joins us, we'll tell you more about his books and
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:45.240]  how to get him before he leaves us, we'll take a few calls before the show ends in about
[02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:46.240]  36 minutes.
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:52.440]  Dr. Boyle, please continue with where you left off with the lynching, the getting rid
[02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:56.000]  of the guy who knew too many secrets over the weekend.
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:03.720]  Right, we also have to look at the timing then, obviously the death of the 3,000 US
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:07.920]  soldier in Iraq was coming up late at that time.
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:15.680]  So I believe that this was orchestrated to distract public attention and focus from
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:24.000]  that 3,000's death and let me say, these US soldiers in Iraq, there are mothers and
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:31.520]  our fathers, our brothers and our sisters, our sons and our daughters and they are being
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:42.960]  beatlessly murdered by Bush and his neoconservative criminal cabal and it is up to each and every
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:49.600]  one of us as US citizens to get them home as soon as possible.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:58.720]  Now that being said, there is the additional factor here of the animosity, deliberately
[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:08.360]  throwing up animosity between the Shia and the Sunni, which this lynching was also designed
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:09.360]  to do.
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:13.480]  Do you think they intended for Saddam to like blow up and respond to the taunts, I mean
[02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:17.680]  obviously that was all carefully choreographed and staged, could it have blown up in the
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:20.560]  White House's face any bigger?
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:26.200]  Well, I think this is what they wanted to happen, I don't think it has blown up in
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:27.200]  their face.
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:34.680]  They wanted to understand the neoconservative mentality, as I said, this is all run right
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:40.520]  out of the White House, Hedley is a neoconservative graduate of Yale Law School.
[02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:43.520]  By the way, you went to school with these people, you know them.
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:50.880]  That's correct, I was trained at the University of Chicago, sort of this neoconservative cesspool
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:57.160]  as an undergrad, I was there with Wolfwood, Shostky, all these people and then his death
[02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:02.400]  was Deputy Elliot Abrams, Hedley's Deputy Elliot Abrams, another neoconservative.
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:10.040]  I went to Harvard Law School with him, Abrams had murdered 35,000 people down in Nicaragua
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:16.120]  back in the 1980s and I'd say murder and I was down there to see what he did.
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:24.880]  And Bush hired him on, he's now the Deputy National Security Advisor, Abrams is a neoconservative
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:33.160]  affiliated with the liquid party in Israel, Aero Sharon and all these racist and genocidal
[02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:34.160]  fanatics.
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:45.680]  So, my assessment was that Abrams and Hedley gave the green light deliberately to stir
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:54.360]  up sectarian tensions, not only in Iraq, between the Shia and the Sunni, but also in
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:55.360]  the Muslim world.
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:08.960]  So, they picked the holiest day, Eid al-Adha, which commemorates the Feast of the Sacrifice
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:20.360]  where God told Abraham that he did not have to sacrifice Isaac, but gave him a goat instead.
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:29.720]  So, this is probably the holiest day on the Muslim calendar and I'm sure a guy like Abrams
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:36.160]  who knows a lot about the Middle East knew that so well and they gave the goat ahead
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:44.640]  to lynch him on the holiest day in the Muslim world, knowing for well it would stir up
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:51.800]  tensions between the Shia and the Muslim Sunni and also worldwide, and if you look at the
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:59.760]  wire services today, you'll see that they have now turned Saddam Hussein into a martyr.
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:06.040]  Now, I've done a lot of work in the Arab and Muslim world and prior to this, everyone
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:12.320]  I knew just thought Saddam Hussein was pretty much a butcher, but now they've turned him
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:21.800]  into a martyr and this is fine as far as the neo-conservative mentality is concerned.
[02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:28.200]  It was the same philosophy the United States had in the Iraq-Rand War, as Henry Kissinger
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:33.480]  said, we want them all to kill each other off and that's the policy.
[02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:37.440]  Zabrigny Bresensi is now calling it the global Balkans, the strategy of tension.
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:46.960]  Well that's right and at Harvard I went through the same PhD program that produced both Kissinger
[02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:53.640]  and Breshinsky and indeed they gave me Kissinger's old office at the Center for International
[02:29:53.640 --> 02:30:01.680]  Affairs and in fact we had the same international relations teacher Hans Morgenthau and when
[02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:09.000]  I was 21 years old Morgenthau offered to call up Kissinger and get me a job on his White
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.840]  House staff, which I declined.
[02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:16.640]  Amazing, I want to hear the back story, you know these guys and I want to see what their
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:19.520]  final ingame is.
[02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:31.240]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:34.880]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine
[02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:35.880]  glass?
[02:30:35.880 --> 02:30:39.480]  Well the glass has a natural resonance, if the resonant frequency force making the glass
[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:44.280]  vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:48.640]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Reif discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed
[02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:50.520]  using different resonant frequencies.
[02:30:50.520 --> 02:30:55.120]  The biosolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination
[02:30:55.120 --> 02:30:58.200]  of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[02:30:58.200 --> 02:31:03.400]  The 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:31:03.400 --> 02:31:07.440]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[02:31:07.440 --> 02:31:12.080]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow, customer satisfaction
[02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:16.320]  is guaranteed or your money back, don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:30.960]  For more information call Biosolutions toll-free 1-866-885-6625 that's 1-866-885-6625, 1-866-885-6625.
[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:35.840]  Hi this is Ted Anderson here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:40.320]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last
[02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:41.320]  year.
[02:31:41.320 --> 02:31:46.200]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the US dollar can be devalued.
[02:31:46.200 --> 02:31:50.080]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential
[02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:51.080]  profits.
[02:31:51.080 --> 02:31:56.160]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth,
[02:31:56.160 --> 02:31:59.920]  it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:31:59.920 --> 02:32:05.080]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:09.640]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:32:09.640 --> 02:32:10.880]  Call for your copy today.
[02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:14.280]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:18.160]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply
[02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:21.000]  must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:28.760]  Call 800-686-2237 that's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:33.920]  Attention, attention everyone, a brand new invention just released.
[02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:39.360]  It's called RIST Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:44.560]  RIST Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a
[02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:46.600]  mouse or adding machine.
[02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:51.480]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat
[02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:57.880]  in front of your keyboard, RIST Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians
[02:32:57.880 --> 02:32:59.960]  who are constantly on the go.
[02:32:59.960 --> 02:33:04.400]  RIST Ease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:10.040]  RIST Ease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and RIST Ease provides
[02:33:10.040 --> 02:33:14.880]  comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[02:33:14.880 --> 02:33:18.400]  You can order RIST Ease now at RIST EASE.com.
[02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:25.040]  That's RIST EASE, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, RIST EASE.com.
[02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:42.480]  Once again, RIST EASE.com.
[02:33:42.480 --> 02:34:11.920]  Hey, we just had somebody run a hack of infowars.com, RIST EASE.com.
[02:34:11.920 --> 02:34:17.160]  They went in and took our big sponsor for fish oil at the top and turned it into a huge
[02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:18.800]  banner for Jones Report.
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:23.400]  I guess it's better than a couple years ago when they posted some naked lady on a motorcycle
[02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:25.080]  on our main page.
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:29.920]  Very funny guys, and you must really know what you're doing to be able to get through all
[02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:32.160]  of our defenses and do that.
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:33.160]  That's it.
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:34.160]  I'll launch a whole other website because you did that.
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:36.280]  Boy, I tell you, it's crazy.
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:41.200]  I know that we have callers for our guests, and I tell you, I really appreciate him spending
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:46.080]  time with us today destroying World Order is the one book he's written that I've read.
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:50.200]  I've scanned through the other one on the anthrax attacks.
[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:54.440]  Of course, we had him on about three, four weeks ago, and the story went supernova on
[02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:59.400]  the web concerning the clear evidence of government involvement in the anthrax attacks.
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:01.200]  It's an orgy of evidence.
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:02.720]  Before he leaves us, we'll tell you how to get these books.
[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:09.000]  We have links to his publisher and the websites up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com right
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:10.000]  now.
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.600]  Let me elaborate.
[02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:16.520]  I tell the listeners, because I'm going off the 83 Israeli plan, the 2002 US plan, I'm
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:17.520]  not that smart.
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:20.640]  They admit in policy paper what they're really going to do, and then they have their public
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:21.640]  propaganda.
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:25.240]  As you know, Doctor, they said we're going to go in, break Iraq in three parts, and spread
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:29.000]  revolution and civil war into the rest of the region.
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.840]  We can all these countries not let them become First World.
[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:35.000]  We may even overthrow Saudi Arabia, blah, blah, blah.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:38.120]  I understand that they did this to make everybody get mad.
[02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:40.240]  I know the military was running the whole execution.
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:41.240]  That's admitted.
[02:35:41.240 --> 02:35:42.920]  Now they're out lying about it.
[02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:47.880]  But when I say blow up in their face, it seems like they're overcooking it.
[02:35:47.880 --> 02:35:51.440]  It's like they're baking a cake in the Middle East, but like they've burned the cake.
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:53.760]  The violence is so bad.
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:55.160]  The troops are barely hanging on.
[02:35:55.160 --> 02:35:59.640]  I guess they see it as shooting the moon, as a guest said on the show yesterday, kind
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:05.240]  of going for it all with a Hail Mary, trying to escalate us into something even bigger.
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:09.480]  But it just seems like they're humorous, has got to get the best of them sometime.
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:14.920]  I mean, 78% of Americans now in major polls want out, 70% of the troops.
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:17.920]  There are people protesting with Democrats every time they have a press conference.
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:19.320]  We have a clip of that.
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:23.320]  I mean, it's just how far, how much are they going to get away with, Doctor?
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:27.440]  Well, first they don't care about our troops at all.
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:31.280]  They're just throwaway people as far as they are concerned.
[02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:41.920]  And yes, they are still going forward with their plans to re-carve up the Middle East
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:46.480]  and remake it in the Neal conservative image.
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:52.800]  They encourage the Israel war massacre, call it what you want against Lebanon.
[02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:57.400]  Israel's war massacre against Palestinians both this summer.
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:05.040]  And now they're planning for a war against Iran, a bombing campaign, that very well could
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:08.080]  turn into World War III.
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:12.240]  And that would not bother them at all, these Neal conservatives, indeed.
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:17.240]  From their perspective, how else are they going to retrieve the situation?
[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:22.080]  Well, Neal cons are on talk radio saying there's going to be World War III, and then they're
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:27.280]  going to start arresting all the, quote, American al-Qaeda, that's you and I, who are against
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:31.880]  this war, when they're really al-Qaeda, they're the ones behind it all.
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:36.120]  I'm sure you're aware of the fact that Genners is calling for shutting down the First Amendment.
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:39.440]  I mean, they are going for broke, I guess.
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:40.440]  They are.
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:43.440]  And you have to understand the Neal con mentality.
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:48.920]  As I was saying, I went to the University of Chicago, the home of the Neal cons.
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:53.960]  I entered there in 1968 as an undergraduate.
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:38:00.600]  Their founder, Leo Strauss, had just retired from the political science department, but
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:11.000]  I was trained by his foremost student, Protégé, co-author and later literary executor, Joseph
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.000]  Propsey.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:18.200]  So, I went right through the entire Neal con program there at the University of Chicago.
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:26.320]  Wilfruits was there getting his PhD in international relations, which I studied, as I said, under
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:27.320]  Hans Brugenthal.
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:33.560]  Ashcroft was there getting his law degree.
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:39.000]  Many of the other Neal cons, Caluz, Todd, was there, Schulsky, they were all there.
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.200]  And we have to understand the Neal con mentality.
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:52.320]  I briefly discussed it in exploring world order, but basically point, Leo Strauss'
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:39:00.320]  mentor in Germany, before he immigrated to the United States, was Carl Schmidt.
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:09.600]  And Carl Schmidt went on to become the most notorious Nazi law professor of that United
[02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:10.600]  era.
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:18.120]  So, Carl Schmidt justified every hideous atrocity, the Nazis inflicted on anyone.
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:22.800]  Well, the parallels to the Bush administration and the Nazis are legion.
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:25.160]  And that's not an accident, is it?
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:34.080]  No, I'm suggesting it isn't, that the Neal cons, through Strauss, and there is a book
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:38.360]  if you're interested here, Professor Shadia Drury, D-R-U-R-Y.
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:44.800]  He teaches up in Canada and he's had no contact with the University of Chicago that I'm aware
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:45.800]  of.
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:54.920]  The Neal cons have been thoroughly schooled in Straussian and Schmidtian theory, which
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:57.760]  is basically Nazi.
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:01.840]  And these people really are neo-Nazis.
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:03.160]  And we have to understand that.
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:09.320]  I think people have a difficult time coming to grips with it because it seems so alien
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:10.320]  to our tradition.
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:18.160]  But it's second nature for the Trotskyites, who kind of formed up with the Bushes, who
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:22.760]  Prescott Bush was a high-level Nazi agent in the U.S. and helped fence a lot of them
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:24.080]  into the U.S. in their money.
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:27.480]  So it just seems like they're just continuing with the tradition.
[02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:31.840]  Now, what about the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi and all these others saying, hey, yeah, we're
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:32.840]  going to increase troops?
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:33.840]  Yeah, we're never going to leave.
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:34.840]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:37.840]  What do you say about those guys?
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:45.040]  Well, you know, when I was young, it was the Democrats who gave us the Vietnam War under
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:51.520]  John Kennedy, the best of the brightest in the state of Palestine and the rest of the
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:52.520]  Democrats.
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:54.080]  So it doesn't surprise me at all.
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:58.120]  I mean, basically, the current Democratic Party, I'm a political independent.
[02:40:58.120 --> 02:41:03.280]  These are the sons and the daughters of the best of the brightest that gave us the Vietnam
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:04.280]  War.
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:11.360]  And indeed, Halberstam, writing on the best of the brightest, was talking about Harvard,
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:16.560]  where I spent seven years at Harvard getting three degrees after the University of Chicago.
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:22.440]  And again, going through this exact same program that produced Kissinger and Brzezinski, but
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:28.560]  especially Kissinger, because I wanted to be trained exactly like these people and think
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:34.600]  like them and know what they're up to, and then hopefully come out and turn it against
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:35.600]  them.
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:41.600]  This, what we're seeing now, and I guess you had mentioned a previous speaker, this is
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:50.360]  go for both, that these neo-Nazis, the neocons from Chicago and President Bush at one point
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:57.080]  publicly bragged that he had appointed at least 20 or 25 Straussians, neo-cons, to his
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:41:58.080]  administration.
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:05.800]  And the whole White House and Chinese office are occupied by neo-cons.
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:09.880]  They are going for rule domination and control.
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:10.880]  The whole shebang here.
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:11.880]  And they realize that...
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:12.880]  They realize that...
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:13.880]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:20.040]  The wars against Afghanistan and Iraq had been planned for quite some time.
[02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:27.480]  As you've correctly pointed out, by the Israelis and also even by our own Pentagon, they have
[02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:36.000]  been executed to seize and steal at least two-thirds of the world's energy resources.
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.040]  And they plan to hold on to it.
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:42.200]  This is the future of the world economy right there.
[02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:43.200]  Now, Dr. Boyle...
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:44.200]  They're not going to give it up.
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:48.040]  Dr. Boyle, going back, you know, we know there's the online oil company.
[02:42:48.040 --> 02:42:49.720]  There's the big central banks.
[02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:56.400]  They certainly are funding and fostering the neo-cons and the Israelis and the British
[02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:58.400]  and others.
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:02.200]  Is there no concern by the old line elite that basically already own the world that
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:04.640]  this could get out of hand?
[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:10.440]  And I mean, are you seeing any fissures in the power structure, or is it just basically
[02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:12.720]  we're going over the edge of the cliff?
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:16.600]  Well, I think they're moving towards World War III.
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:23.240]  And that, unfortunately, it seems the power elite have signed onto this indeed.
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:30.040]  Today, if you read the New York Times, Matt Scoproft, who was a work for Kissinger and
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:38.080]  then became national security advisor to both Ford and then Bush Sr., who had originally
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:45.920]  opposed Bush Jr.'s war against Iraq, if you read today's New York Times, there's a big
[02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:54.440]  op-ed piece where he's basically supporting the Bush Jr. strategy of escalation in Iraq,
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:44:01.920]  where the neo-cons are going to send over another 20,000 to 30,000 of our brothers and
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:07.720]  sisters to be massacred in Iraq.
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:12.840]  And then that will escalate it even again, and then more troops, more troops.
[02:44:12.840 --> 02:44:16.360]  But if the American people don't want to go along with it, I guess the domestic police
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:21.200]  state and all this talk about restricting the First Amendment, I guess that comes into
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:22.200]  play.
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:23.200]  That's correct.
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:27.560]  And that's why you're seeing the police state Gestapo tactics that we talked about the last
[02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:28.560]  time.
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:37.760]  For example, Gonzalez Harper Blass School, I went there, another neo-con nest, the Head
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:45.000]  of Homeland Security, Chertoff, a certified neo-con himself, and it's no accident that
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:50.800]  they put Chertoff in charge of the police state, he's running a thing right there.
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:58.920]  So they understood that if they made this major grab for world power by launching brutal
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:06.000]  aggression against Iraq and Afghanistan, and perhaps now Iran, if we don't stop them
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:12.680]  in Syria, that there would be massive resistance by the American people as we saw opposition
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:13.920]  to the Vietnam War.
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:18.800]  But magically, 9-11 happened as the pretext to push it all.
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:19.800]  That's correct.
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:26.200]  One, they needed a pretext, and then two, they need a police state to stop the predictable
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:27.680]  resistance.
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:29.360]  How do we stop them, Dr. Boyle?
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:33.560]  I mean, you've advised Congress, you've written international and national legislation, you've
[02:45:33.560 --> 02:45:35.360]  been to all the same schools.
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:39.240]  I mean, how do we stop these people from doing this?
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:41.440]  How do we stop World War III?
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:48.040]  Well, you saw Mrs. Cindy Shee in the other day, right?
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:52.000]  And they engaged in peaceful, nonviolent, civil resistance.
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:57.200]  They disrupted that press conference by Raymond Rahm Emanuel.
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:04.640]  He took the podium in front of the press, and he demanded troops out of Iraq.
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:07.880]  And we went through this before in the Vietnam War.
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:12.080]  But isn't this an illustration for everybody that it's unconstitutional, the people don't
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:17.240]  want to be there, they lied to us to get this there, but still, we see the Democrats and
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:21.640]  Republicans circling the wagons against the people, but I agree, everywhere they go, they
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:22.640]  should be shut down.
[02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:24.560]  They should be completely shut down.
[02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:31.840]  I'm not advocating violence here, but peaceful, nonviolent, civil resistance that Cindy Sheehan
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:35.600]  has been doing now for quite some time.
[02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:43.040]  And pretty much what we did to end the Vietnam War, pretty much what African-Americans courageously
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:47.920]  did to produce civil rights in this country, to a very high cost.
[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:49.760]  What about the National Draft?
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:53.280]  They've got all these big, the head of the selective service and everybody out pushing
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:57.480]  how important a draft is, they've set up the draft boards again, do you think they'll
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:02.480]  try to pull a draft after another stage terror attack?
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:06.000]  I'm sure they're moving in that direction.
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:12.360]  It's very similar to what President Johnson did in December of 1964.
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:16.560]  We had about 140,000 troops in Vietnam.
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:22.520]  His advisors were telling him the war was lost and instead of pulling out, he decided
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:29.880]  to escalate, creating a total disaster, 58,000 men of my generation were needlessly killed.
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:33.880]  But not a disaster, not a disaster for the defense contractors though.
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:35.840]  Oh no, they made money, sure.
[02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:38.240]  And they're all making money today.
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:43.480]  If you read the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, I read them every day.
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:49.360]  They're making enormous profits on all these weapons systems, the oil companies are making
[02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:50.360]  enormous profits.
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:56.040]  I just remember the Bush family is heavily invested in oil, whatever oil prices go up,
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:57.040]  they make more money.
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:47:58.040]  Sure.
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:00.720]  Do you ever run into these neocons at events or functions?
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:04.320]  I debate them, sure.
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:12.040]  I was once speaking at the National Press Club several years ago and we went up for
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:19.480]  lunch and right ahead is a line waiting for a seat with Elliot Abrams, my classmate from
[02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:20.480]  Harvard Law School.
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:26.320]  They sat him and the Mater D came back and said, where would you like to sit?
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:34.840]  And I said in a very loud tone of voice, I don't want to be anywhere near that man because
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:38.320]  the odor of blood is too great.
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:44.400]  He had killed 35,000 down in Nicaragua and yet here he is, the deputy national security
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:52.960]  advisor and he is not orchestrating what can only be said to be a clash of civilization.
[02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:53.960]  They don't care.
[02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:54.960]  They don't care.
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:48:55.960]  That is correct.
[02:48:55.960 --> 02:48:56.960]  They enjoy killing people.
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:48:57.960]  Don't they?
[02:48:57.960 --> 02:48:58.960]  It's like a power trip.
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:48:59.960]  Right.
[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:04.040]  As Henry Kissinger said about the Iraq-Rand War, our strategy is to have them kill each
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:05.040]  other off.
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:09.840]  Well, he also called, I'll paraphrase it, I forget the exact quote, he called our military
[02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:12.680]  men in Vietnam like dumb animals.
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:13.680]  That's correct.
[02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:18.400]  I went through the same program at Harvard that produced Kissinger and that's exactly
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:24.520]  the way they think and Harvard has learned nothing from the Vietnam War.
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:34.680]  They still train major war criminals and war mongers such as Kissinger at Harvard today
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:35.680]  as we speak.
[02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:41.440]  Let's be clear though, let's say there's a father listening, Alan Austin, whose son
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:46.720]  is in Iraq and he would say to me, and these are real people I'm talking about, well, I
[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:50.360]  know it's bad but we can't leave without victory, it's some ego thing.
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:54.440]  They don't understand victory was never meant.
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:57.440]  The victory you've been told about, you're putting in a government in and beating the
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:01.560]  insurgency and leaving, they are there to create the insurgency.
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:02.560]  What do you say to-
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:09.160]  Right, and also, Alex, let me point out, you see, the strategy here all along was to destroy
[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:11.840]  Iraq as a viable nation state.
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:18.440]  If you read Huntington's Clash of Civilization, and again, I went through the same PhD program
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:20.680]  at Harvard that produced Huntington.
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:26.560]  He was their enemy and was on the fact that I wouldn't study with him because it is support
[02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:29.000]  for the Vietnam War.
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:37.760]  They wanted to destroy Iraq as a viable nation state because as Huntington pointed out, Iraq
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:46.560]  was probably the only Arab nation state that could have provided leadership to the Arab
[02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:52.320]  world in a confrontation with the West over the energy supply.
[02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:59.880]  So, Iraq had to be destroyed and this is a policy going back to Bush Sr. as I point
[02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:06.280]  out in my book, the First Iraq War, where he just obliterated it and then there was
[02:51:06.280 --> 02:51:11.160]  a defacto carve-up of Iraq into three pieces, the Kurds of the North, the Shia of the South.
[02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:12.160]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:51:12.160 --> 02:51:13.160]  We've got to break.
[02:51:13.160 --> 02:51:18.280]  Final segment, we're going to come back and talk to Paul in New Orleans and two other
[02:51:18.280 --> 02:51:21.440]  callers quickly in the final segment, tell folks about your books.
[02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:22.440]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:23.440]  Stay with us.
[02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:35.600]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:37.980]  And I do film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:37.980 --> 02:51:41.640]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating
[02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:46.360]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:46.360 --> 02:51:51.320]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in
[02:51:51.320 --> 02:51:53.880]  London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:53.880 --> 02:51:58.040]  Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House probe to
[02:51:58.040 --> 02:52:04.200]  disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information
[02:52:04.200 --> 02:52:05.520]  and much, much more.
[02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:09.440]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrors.
[02:52:09.440 --> 02:52:11.640]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:11.640 --> 02:52:16.200]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:38.680 --> 02:52:39.680]  shelter.

[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:52.680]  Destroying World Order, U.S. Imperialism of the Middle East before ever September 11th.
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:57.200]  Let's talk to Paul in New Orleans, been holding patiently.
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:54:58.200]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:54:59.200]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:00.200]  How are you doing?
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:01.200]  Good, sir.
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:05.200]  You opened my mind up with your program.
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:07.360]  I'm going to spread the word.
[02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:13.240]  Thomas Jefferson said, the accused heel of any nation is when he goes outside of its
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:15.920]  boundaries and we're there.
[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:19.240]  April Gatsby back in with George was Daddy Bush.
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:21.320]  Hey, Paul Gillespie, yeah.
[02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:25.960]  She was talking about, I'm just the average show, I'm just working hard, I'm a truck
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:26.960]  driver.
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:32.680]  I remember when she was ex-permission from our government for Saddam to Cross Drill,
[02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:36.840]  and they said, yeah, and then about two, maybe two, three months later, she came back
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:43.280]  on C-SPAN and she says that she was wrong and it was all part of the New World Order,
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:46.480]  which was a clue back in the 90s, what was going on.
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:51.640]  Is there any way that George Bush can be tried for war crimes?
[02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:58.560]  I read an article where a Hawaiian American is not going to go back into service because
[02:55:58.560 --> 02:56:00.640]  he said that the war was illegal.
[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:02.560]  This is not our military and it is illegal.
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:05.560]  Dr. Boyle, you want to comment on what he's saying?
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:08.960]  Yes, I'm currently working on that case.
[02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:13.400]  Lieutenant Aaron Tata, a very courageous young man.
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:21.600]  I was out there for his Article 32 hearing and hopefully I'll be going back for the full
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:23.000]  court martial.
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:26.920]  I would encourage all of you to support Lieutenant Tata.
[02:56:26.920 --> 02:56:31.520]  He refuses to have anything to do with this criminal war against Iraq.
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:32.960]  I need to get his dad on the show.
[02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:34.480]  I've been meaning to do that.
[02:56:34.480 --> 02:56:37.040]  Bob Tata is his mate, right.
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:43.160]  The family is very, he's got to be careful what he says now because he's being a court
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:50.920]  martial for comments he made to the press that are perfectly lawful and valid and an
[02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:53.400]  exercise of his First Amendment rights.
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:54.400]  Absolutely.
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:55.400]  His right to refuse illegal orders.
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:57.000]  Let's talk to Kevin and Boston.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:58.000]  Thank you, Paul.
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  Good points.
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:00.000]  Kevin, go ahead.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:06.040]  And thank you, Dr. Francis Boyle, for putting yourself in the line for truth and the right
[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:07.040]  way of things.
[02:57:07.040 --> 02:57:08.440]  You know, being a doctor and everything.
[02:57:08.440 --> 02:57:09.440]  We appreciate it.
[02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:14.280]  I had some quick points on Saddam Hussein I believe was not the real Saddam executed.
[02:57:14.280 --> 02:57:20.240]  I know, I respect what you're saying, Alex, and I just had some points for you to consider.
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:26.520]  It was on April 5th, 2003 that a clean shaven appeared in the streets when they thought he
[02:57:26.520 --> 02:57:29.280]  was dead and they were trying to celebrate, always probably dead, he's gone and he appeared
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:33.440]  in the streets clean shaven in his fatigues with the crowds cheering him.
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:35.360]  That was what I believe was the real Saddam.
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:40.640]  Let me get a call from Dr. Boyle, what do you know about the people who would say this?
[02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:46.440]  Well, I would say whether it's the real Saddam or not is somewhat beside the point.
[02:57:46.440 --> 02:57:49.600]  This winching, it was clearly designed to be a winching.
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:58.840]  As I point out, was set up by the neo-conservatives in the White House, first to distract public
[02:57:58.840 --> 02:58:06.360]  attention from the 3,000 dead soldier, and then second to stir up hostilities between
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:16.080]  Shia and Sunnis in Iraq, and also in the Muslim world itself to inspire more terrorism against
[02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:17.080]  Americans.
[02:58:17.080 --> 02:58:24.440]  Because the neo-cons need terrorism against Americans to justify what they're doing.
[02:58:24.440 --> 02:58:25.440]  We're out of time.
[02:58:25.440 --> 02:58:26.440]  That's P2OG.
[02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:29.720]  These guys are hyper Machiavellian, are they not?
[02:58:29.720 --> 02:58:32.920]  That's exactly what we were trained at the University of Chicago.
[02:58:32.920 --> 02:58:40.520]  We had to know Machiavelli up and down and in our sleep, yes, completely, and the same
[02:58:40.520 --> 02:58:41.520]  at Harvard.
[02:58:41.520 --> 02:58:48.320]  To get a PhD in political science at Harvard, like Kissinger, Brzezinski, Huntington and
[02:58:48.320 --> 02:58:54.120]  me, you had to know your Machiavelli up and down and in your sleep and by your road.
[02:58:54.120 --> 02:58:55.120]  That is exactly correct.
[02:58:55.120 --> 02:59:01.040]  Ultra Machiavellian system, sorry to Robert and Texas, I don't have time to get your
[02:59:01.040 --> 02:59:02.040]  calls.
[02:59:02.040 --> 02:59:03.040]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:59:03.040 --> 02:59:04.040]  I'll be live.
[02:59:04.040 --> 02:59:05.040]  Dr. Boyle, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:08.040]  Well, thanks for having me on, and again, happy new year to everyone out there.
[02:59:08.040 --> 02:59:09.040]  You too.
[02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:10.040]  You too.
[02:59:10.040 --> 02:59:19.520]  This broadcast is available on MP3CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll 3877-37645.
[02:59:19.520 --> 02:59:24.240]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration
[02:59:24.240 --> 02:59:25.240]  model.
[02:59:25.240 --> 02:59:29.400]  Ideal for sporting games, capping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in
[02:59:29.400 --> 02:59:30.400]  your glove box.
[02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:34.960]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:59:34.960 --> 02:59:38.240]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:59:38.240 --> 02:59:41.920]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:59:41.920 --> 02:59:46.360]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful
[02:59:46.360 --> 02:59:54.360]  it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria and chemicals like herbicides.
