[00:00.000 --> 00:29.480]  The election in six days is a referendum on national sovereignty versus globalism.
[00:29.480 --> 00:37.480]  And we have a president who is a champion who is fighting against this hostile takeover,
[00:37.480 --> 00:39.720]  not just our country, but every individual in it.
[00:39.720 --> 00:43.360]  Here's what President Trump had to say last night.
[00:43.360 --> 00:49.560]  Joe Biden is a diehard globalist who wiped out your still mills, closed down your factories,
[00:49.560 --> 00:58.200]  killed your call jobs, outsourced your industries, and supported every horrible, terrible, ridiculous
[00:58.200 --> 01:00.920]  trade deal for over a half a century.
[01:00.920 --> 01:01.920]  Think of it.
[01:01.920 --> 01:08.080]  47 years plus, he was a cheerleader for NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made.
[01:08.080 --> 01:09.080]  And I ended it.
[01:09.080 --> 01:12.680]  Remember I used to say, we're going to end it, everyone smiled, they said, hey, look,
[01:12.680 --> 01:13.680]  give it a shot.
[01:13.680 --> 01:14.680]  I got it done.
[01:14.680 --> 01:21.400]  Nobody thought I could get that done.
[01:21.400 --> 01:25.840]  And USMCA just kicked in and it's incredible for our country, less for their countries,
[01:25.840 --> 01:26.840]  but that's okay.
[01:26.840 --> 01:28.520]  Not too happy.
[01:28.520 --> 01:29.520]  Not too happy.
[01:29.520 --> 01:34.160]  He enthusiastically voted for China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
[01:34.160 --> 01:37.480]  That was the beginning of the China rise.
[01:37.480 --> 01:38.480]  That was a disaster.
[01:38.480 --> 01:42.360]  They were flat lined for years and years and then boom.
[01:42.360 --> 01:43.360]  Thank you very much, Joe.
[01:43.360 --> 01:50.600]  I appreciated Joe and others, decimating your manufacturing and enriching China at your
[01:50.600 --> 01:53.000]  expense, you know that.
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.360]  And that is absolutely true, except for one thing.
[01:55.360 --> 01:57.360]  He calls it incompetence.
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.320]  Globalism is a scientific plan to deindustrialize the West so we can be totally controlled and
[02:02.320 --> 02:04.920]  capitulate and surrender.
[02:04.920 --> 02:10.400]  That's why all of globalism is about getting rid of farms, getting rid of factories, getting
[02:10.400 --> 02:15.960]  rid of mom and pop shops, getting rid of the service economy, having food deserts everywhere,
[02:15.960 --> 02:22.080]  but then China can have all the new mega trains and all the big skyscrapers and all the new
[02:22.080 --> 02:28.360]  fighter planes and all the new CAT scans, but we get nothing because we're being taught
[02:28.360 --> 02:30.800]  to be slaves.
[02:30.800 --> 02:36.960]  And so that's been the plan and that's why China's been open for six months, but we are
[02:36.960 --> 02:40.920]  to never open because that's the blue city, blue state agenda.
[02:40.920 --> 02:43.560]  They're globalists that work for the collapse of this country.
[02:43.560 --> 02:48.000]  My God, it's in the Cloward and Piven strategy and I sit there and I tell very prominent
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.280]  people this and try to show them the documentation when it's all public and they just won't listen
[02:53.280 --> 02:57.760]  because they can't believe that things are that predatory and that someone else would
[02:57.760 --> 03:02.560]  want poverty, but the system of feudalism has been the most common political system
[03:02.560 --> 03:08.040]  in history and that's where you keep 99% of people poor to control them.
[03:08.040 --> 03:13.080]  It's the Renaissance, only 550 years old that comes out of Christianity that was the first
[03:13.080 --> 03:14.480]  to actually challenge that.
[03:14.480 --> 03:21.160]  So this is a war against prosperity and a war against you and I and all of us being independent.
[03:21.160 --> 03:28.960]  Trump talked more about Biden and the fact that they'll never let the lockdown end if
[03:28.960 --> 03:30.640]  he is elected, which is totally true.
[03:30.640 --> 03:35.080]  This is bigger than anything now a referendum on reopening the country and reversing what's
[03:35.080 --> 03:36.480]  they now say is permanent.
[03:36.480 --> 03:41.120]  There's two weeks ago they said 10 years, first it was a couple of months, then 10 years.
[03:41.120 --> 03:46.400]  Now they say it's permanent for ever, here it is.
[03:46.400 --> 03:52.000]  If Joe Biden and the Democrat Socialists are elected, they will delay the vaccine, delay
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.840]  the therapies, prolong the pandemic and close your schools and shut down your country.
[03:56.840 --> 04:00.000]  I hate to say it, you are shut down anyway, Pennsylvania.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.160]  By the way, I've been proven right.
[04:02.160 --> 04:06.120]  It wasn't a hard analysis that when Trump came out and said, oh, we'll have the vaccine
[04:06.120 --> 04:11.120]  this year, that was to get ahead of gates that wanted to keep us closed for a few years,
[04:11.120 --> 04:16.240]  have all the apps in place, the contact tracing, the tracker apps to then make you accept up
[04:16.240 --> 04:20.880]  to five vaccines a year that are mRNA vaccines before you can buy and sell or leave your
[04:20.880 --> 04:21.880]  house.
[04:21.880 --> 04:24.760]  Trump's like, no, you don't have to take it, but we're going to have an old fashioned
[04:24.760 --> 04:28.480]  vaccine for learned immunity if you want it.
[04:28.480 --> 04:32.320]  And that's the way to get the fear to go away so people take the mask off and stop living
[04:32.320 --> 04:33.320]  in hysteria.
[04:33.320 --> 04:36.000]  And everything he does is to end that chicken little phenomenon.
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.000]  So that's what he did.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.320]  He was not endorsing vaccines.
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.320]  He was taking control away from gates and the UN and the chai comms with optimism.
[04:42.320 --> 04:44.320]  It's still a very dangerous game.
[04:44.320 --> 04:45.320]  That's what the president's doing.
[04:45.320 --> 04:46.320]  All right.
[04:46.320 --> 04:50.680]  I'm going to open the phones up throughout the three hours than Paul Watson's coming
[04:50.680 --> 04:51.680]  up.
[04:51.680 --> 04:53.960]  If Stuart Rose joining us, I'll give the number out when we come back.
[04:53.960 --> 04:54.960]  Get ready.
[04:54.960 --> 04:55.960]  Six days to election.
[04:55.960 --> 05:02.560]  CNN and the rest of the corporate media are running with the false headline that Trump
[05:02.560 --> 05:04.960]  is surrendered to the coronavirus.
[05:04.960 --> 05:05.960]  It's the opposite.
[05:05.960 --> 05:11.360]  He's not surrendering to the endless drumbeat of fear and false science that it's incredibly
[05:11.360 --> 05:15.080]  deadly and that we have a chance of eradicating it.
[05:15.080 --> 05:18.840]  Bill Gates, Fauci and the UN have said, we will always wear masks.
[05:18.840 --> 05:24.880]  We will never shake hands and even the vaccines won't protect us forever until the civilization
[05:24.880 --> 05:31.640]  as we know is over until every coronavirus in the world is eradicated.
[05:31.640 --> 05:32.640]  That's impossible.
[05:32.640 --> 05:33.640]  That's right.
[05:33.640 --> 05:36.600]  They're trying to say they have to have a cure to the common cold.
[05:36.600 --> 05:40.840]  That's what COVID-19 false positives for on the test.
[05:40.840 --> 05:45.440]  They created a problem that can never be defeated, but of course they're the ones in charge of
[05:45.440 --> 05:46.440]  the problem.
[05:46.440 --> 05:51.360]  And so they stay in power forever and take control of society with contact tracers now
[05:51.360 --> 05:57.000]  going with the police to people's doors in Texas at gunpoint and taking four samples.
[05:57.000 --> 06:04.000]  You must say no.
[06:04.000 --> 06:19.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:19.000 --> 06:31.800]  Here's what I've decided to do.
[06:31.800 --> 06:35.000]  We already have seven to nine election countdown.
[06:35.000 --> 06:38.760]  We only have six minutes and an hour for local TV and radio stations, so it's commercial
[06:38.760 --> 06:39.760]  free on our end.
[06:39.760 --> 06:42.600]  So we can take your calls as a special guest throughout the election.
[06:42.600 --> 06:46.560]  And of course we have Sunday now, where I do four to six.
[06:46.560 --> 06:51.200]  I've been doing that for 15, 16 years, but the last month, we added Sunday live with
[06:51.200 --> 06:56.700]  myself, Owen Schreuer, Harrison Smith and others six to eight, and that too only has
[06:56.700 --> 06:58.200]  six minutes of ads an hour.
[06:58.200 --> 07:01.280]  A lot of radio stations are picking it up, so we're excited to see that happen during
[07:01.280 --> 07:02.280]  the election.
[07:02.280 --> 07:09.320]  And of course, obviously on election night, we're going to be here and we're going to
[07:09.320 --> 07:10.320]  have live coverage.
[07:10.320 --> 07:15.080]  I'm also going to be popping in on some other local podcast that are going to be doing live
[07:15.080 --> 07:16.440]  coverage that evening.
[07:16.440 --> 07:18.200]  I'll just leave it at that.
[07:18.200 --> 07:23.280]  And there'll be big news either breaking tonight or tomorrow here on this show that'll be national
[07:23.280 --> 07:24.280]  news.
[07:24.280 --> 07:25.280]  I'll just leave it at that.
[07:25.280 --> 07:29.400]  You'll definitely want to keep your eyes on the ball in full wars.com and band on video
[07:29.400 --> 07:37.320]  because we are fighting hard for the Republic.
[07:37.320 --> 07:44.320]  As I say, as many of you say, you could cut the energy that's in the air, the tension
[07:44.320 --> 07:48.080]  with a knife, palpable.
[07:48.080 --> 07:51.160]  And I personally have just been praying for a global awakening and for humanity to come
[07:51.160 --> 07:54.720]  back to its senses against this scientific evil we're facing.
[07:54.720 --> 07:58.240]  And I've also prayed to God to give me calm.
[07:58.240 --> 08:02.480]  And I'll just tell you my own personal story and then get into all the news.
[08:02.480 --> 08:06.000]  I have always been blessed, even though my dad was a dentist, to have basically perfect
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.840]  teeth, never a cavity, never a broken tooth, nothing.
[08:09.840 --> 08:16.160]  But at about 44, I started clenching from stress in my sleep and breaking my teeth off,
[08:16.160 --> 08:17.160]  my molars off.
[08:17.160 --> 08:20.680]  And I actually had my wisdom teeth.
[08:20.680 --> 08:27.400]  And one of those three days ago cracked in my sleep down into the roots, screw shadingly
[08:27.400 --> 08:28.400]  painful.
[08:28.400 --> 08:32.080]  And I'm finally going to go get it pulled today right after I got off air.
[08:32.080 --> 08:34.200]  I already had a checkup to look at it.
[08:34.200 --> 08:39.400]  My dad's retired now, but he looked at it to the same thing, that the teeth are like
[08:39.400 --> 08:42.360]  polarized where the bone is polarized around them.
[08:42.360 --> 08:47.840]  I've clenched so hard and that as the ligaments tighten back up around the teeth.
[08:47.840 --> 08:51.040]  That's what causes the excruciating pain.
[08:51.040 --> 08:53.800]  And so just like your neck tightens up, people can see me on TV.
[08:53.800 --> 08:55.920]  I have like chipmunk size.
[08:55.920 --> 08:56.920]  That's not fat.
[08:56.920 --> 08:57.920]  That's muscle.
[08:57.920 --> 08:58.920]  Psydes muscles from the stress.
[08:58.920 --> 09:02.520]  That's where a lot of people carry their stresses either in their neck, their shoulders
[09:02.520 --> 09:05.120]  and their jaw.
[09:05.120 --> 09:09.840]  And I literally had to pray to God just to not clench my teeth in the bloody pulps.
[09:09.840 --> 09:12.280]  I have to wear a mouth guard at night if I forget.
[09:12.280 --> 09:16.120]  It's like goodbye the next day to my teeth.
[09:16.120 --> 09:23.200]  And it was really hurting bad about two hours ago when I was in a meeting, one of my friends
[09:23.200 --> 09:24.800]  who works here was telling the funny jokes.
[09:24.800 --> 09:26.880]  I started laughing really hard.
[09:26.880 --> 09:30.880]  And I noticed that what my dad had told me was really hurting a few days ago is true.
[09:30.880 --> 09:33.280]  He's a dentist.
[09:33.280 --> 09:35.320]  It's just like TMJ and your jaw is what it's called.
[09:35.320 --> 09:41.280]  You've got to relax and have fun or it's going to tighten up the ligament around that broken
[09:41.280 --> 09:42.280]  tooth.
[09:42.280 --> 09:43.280]  That's what's causing the pain.
[09:43.280 --> 09:47.880]  And so just as my neck tenses up and my shoulders tenses up when I'm worried, my jaw tenses
[09:47.880 --> 09:53.280]  up and then immediately it causes excruciating pain.
[09:53.280 --> 09:58.000]  And that is such an incredible example of what stress does to us, what the globalists
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  are trying to do to us.
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.360]  And what's amazing, the learning experience from this is I can just think about how I
[10:03.360 --> 10:07.560]  love God and my family and know we're going to make it through this and that it's not
[10:07.560 --> 10:08.560]  all on my shoulders.
[10:08.560 --> 10:10.440]  It's not all on your shoulders.
[10:10.440 --> 10:15.320]  We just have to be steadfast and faithful and strong and God will take us through it.
[10:15.320 --> 10:21.200]  And I can literally feel the ligament release off of my wisdom tooth and the pain stop.
[10:21.200 --> 10:25.280]  So what a way to make me not get stressed and take all the weight on myself and feel
[10:25.280 --> 10:28.480]  really angry at myself that I'm not strong enough to defeat the globalist.
[10:28.480 --> 10:32.080]  Look what we've all done with Info Wars and what you've done in your own life exposing
[10:32.080 --> 10:33.080]  evil.
[10:33.080 --> 10:35.920]  And look how far we've come and now the new world order is exposed and they're fighting
[10:35.920 --> 10:36.920]  back.
[10:36.920 --> 10:39.760]  But at least, at least we're fighting back at least we're aware of them now.
[10:39.760 --> 10:46.880]  And so we really do have to celebrate our victories.
[10:46.880 --> 10:54.200]  We really do have to celebrate our victories instead of letting the enemy demoralize us,
[10:54.200 --> 10:56.440]  letting the enemy get us down.
[10:56.440 --> 10:58.960]  You have to be more thankful.
[10:58.960 --> 11:05.240]  That's just a physiological interesting thing because this tooth is cracked and will have
[11:05.240 --> 11:06.240]  to be pulled.
[11:06.240 --> 11:07.240]  I'll put an implant in there.
[11:07.240 --> 11:10.800]  Thank God for modern technology.
[11:10.800 --> 11:14.800]  But if I left it in there, it's kind of a learning tool.
[11:14.800 --> 11:19.720]  Maybe I'll leave it in there for a couple of months so that every time I get upset because
[11:19.720 --> 11:20.720]  here's the secret.
[11:20.720 --> 11:27.040]  It's not just your muscles that tighten up in your jaw, it's your heart.
[11:27.040 --> 11:29.800]  And that's why people that are alpha males and people that are really concerned and people
[11:29.800 --> 11:34.120]  that are first responders, you name it, have a lot of heart attacks is because we take
[11:34.120 --> 11:35.120]  on the way of the world.
[11:35.120 --> 11:36.920]  And it has to be a balance is what I'm saying.
[11:36.920 --> 11:44.000]  We have to take on the way of the world but still be conscious of what it's doing to
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.320]  us personally and make sure we win the marathon and not just the sprint because life is a
[11:50.320 --> 11:51.320]  marathon.
[11:51.320 --> 11:52.320]  It's not a sprint.
[11:52.320 --> 11:53.320]  All right.
[11:53.320 --> 11:54.320]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[11:54.320 --> 11:58.720]  I want to open the phones up throughout the full show today because I was thinking people
[11:58.720 --> 12:00.160]  want to talk.
[12:00.160 --> 12:01.760]  People want to discuss what's going on.
[12:01.760 --> 12:04.400]  Folks want to be able to engage.
[12:04.400 --> 12:06.600]  They want to be able to talk about what they see.
[12:06.600 --> 12:11.200]  So first-time callers, longtime callers agree, disagree.
[12:11.200 --> 12:12.240]  What do you think of the election?
[12:12.240 --> 12:13.680]  What do you think of the ongoing riots?
[12:13.680 --> 12:17.800]  What do you think of the left pledging to drive Trump from office when he wins?
[12:17.800 --> 12:20.960]  That's mainstream news, told you that was coming.
[12:20.960 --> 12:22.240]  What's the tricks up their sleeves?
[12:22.240 --> 12:23.760]  What are they going to pull next?
[12:23.760 --> 12:28.680]  What do you think of Amy Comey Barrett getting confirmed so fast because they know they can't
[12:28.680 --> 12:29.800]  stop her?
[12:29.800 --> 12:31.760]  They're planning something big.
[12:31.760 --> 12:43.160]  It's whatever you want to discuss a free-for-all wildcard, 877-789-2539, 877-789, Alex, 877-789-2539.
[12:43.160 --> 12:45.240]  And boy, do we have a lot to cover.
[12:45.240 --> 12:50.720]  There's new Biden corruption coming out, more eyewitnesses, more emails, more confirmations
[12:50.720 --> 12:56.520]  of just total corruption with Ukraine and China, incredible bizarre behavior with children,
[12:56.520 --> 13:00.120]  Hunter talking about sex with family members.
[13:00.120 --> 13:01.120]  It's all there.
[13:01.120 --> 13:04.760]  These are just out of control individuals.
[13:04.760 --> 13:07.320]  That is all coming up.
[13:07.320 --> 13:12.080]  Chinese group, Hunter Biden sex tape says, Biden's are CIA assets.
[13:12.080 --> 13:16.120]  When you say CIA, you mean globalist assets.
[13:16.120 --> 13:19.480]  And again, I went ahead and told the story on a big podcast yesterday that's going to
[13:19.480 --> 13:20.480]  air in the next 24 hours.
[13:20.480 --> 13:24.280]  I'm not going to say which podcast, but my uncle was a great guy.
[13:24.280 --> 13:30.440]  He was an army helicopter pilot, did stuff with them in those Latin America.
[13:30.440 --> 13:37.360]  He was never involved in any of that stuff, but he got out of government work because
[13:37.360 --> 13:41.880]  of child trafficking that was going on connected to the CIA.
[13:41.880 --> 13:45.600]  So I don't need to hear it from Ted Gunnerson, former head of the FBI and LA, who's improving
[13:45.600 --> 13:46.600]  right.
[13:46.600 --> 13:48.920]  I don't need to hear it from a government document.
[13:48.920 --> 13:53.720]  I mean, my own family told me about it before he died.
[13:53.720 --> 13:59.200]  And just confirming the information we already know, this is widespread.
[13:59.200 --> 14:00.200]  This is rampant.
[14:00.200 --> 14:01.200]  This is evil.
[14:01.200 --> 14:02.200]  This is wrong.
[14:02.200 --> 14:03.200]  It's got to stop.
[14:03.200 --> 14:07.560]  So that is all coming up as well.
[14:07.560 --> 14:14.360]  Please remember that we are only here on air facing the globalist onslaught, the DNC funded
[14:14.360 --> 14:16.960]  lawsuits and everything that's happening because of you.
[14:16.960 --> 14:24.840]  We built the only truly multimedia independent radio TV print film organization in the world
[14:24.840 --> 14:26.640]  that promotes the truth against the globalist.
[14:26.640 --> 14:27.920]  We've had a devastating effect.
[14:27.920 --> 14:29.480]  We're a national treasure.

[14:56.800 --> 14:58.520]  It just naturally tastes really good.

[15:52.640 --> 16:07.840]  You couldn't be supporting our important organization, the Fiverr Freedom.
[16:07.840 --> 16:12.320]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone.
[16:12.320 --> 16:15.680]  Simply go to band.video with your Safari browser.
[16:15.680 --> 16:18.920]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[16:18.920 --> 16:22.400]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[16:22.400 --> 16:24.520]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[16:24.520 --> 16:26.800]  I suggest band.video.
[16:26.800 --> 16:31.400]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[16:31.400 --> 16:32.400]  to stop it.
[16:32.400 --> 16:36.520]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[16:36.520 --> 16:40.720]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[16:40.720 --> 16:44.720]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech, and click the share buttons below
[16:44.720 --> 16:47.400]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[16:47.400 --> 16:58.400]  However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[16:58.400 --> 17:03.760]  China is open, America is closed, and in the European Union, where the people are revolting
[17:03.760 --> 17:08.520]  trying to get out of the authoritarian tyranny, they're also under even greater levels of
[17:08.520 --> 17:09.520]  lockdown.
[17:09.520 --> 17:10.840]  It's very simple.
[17:10.840 --> 17:15.160]  Where authoritarians already have complete control of commerce, China, oh, there's no
[17:15.160 --> 17:20.280]  more lockdowns, and there are heroes, and the UN says, for example, for assault, after
[17:20.280 --> 17:24.080]  all, that's where the virus came from, after all, that's where the fear mongering came
[17:24.080 --> 17:25.080]  from.
[17:25.080 --> 17:30.760]  The lockdown came from, but that was a weapon, a psychological hysteria, a chicken little
[17:30.760 --> 17:38.680]  syndrome being created that was to then be aimed at us and used to invoke our fear and
[17:38.680 --> 17:41.920]  have us go into a stampede of mass hysteria.
[17:41.920 --> 17:47.920]  And so far it's been incredibly successful, until just the last few weeks, as across the
[17:47.920 --> 17:53.960]  world, humanity awakens in the fact that COVID-19 is a giant UN, communist Chinese, world government
[17:53.960 --> 17:59.840]  power graph.
[17:59.840 --> 18:18.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:18.720 --> 18:23.200]  What an incredible time to be alive, and there isn't anywhere I'd rather be but here
[18:23.200 --> 18:27.680]  right now, fighting against this evil with all of you.
[18:27.680 --> 18:38.280]  We're opening the phones up 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex on this live, October 27th, Tuesday, global
[18:38.280 --> 18:39.280]  transmission.
[18:39.280 --> 18:45.160]  Now, I was not out yesterday playing hooky, I was on an important mission that you'll
[18:45.160 --> 18:49.200]  hear about in the next 24 hours, I'll just leave it at that, but big news, coming to
[18:49.200 --> 18:50.200]  InfoWars.
[18:50.200 --> 18:55.000]  I want to go to Eric and Pennsylvania first in a moment, because that's where I'm going
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.000]  first.
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.680]  First Alex Jones, thank you for joining us, only six days out from the election, and then
[18:59.680 --> 19:06.560]  the 79 days of hell that kicks in once there's an election, because they're going to contest,
[19:06.560 --> 19:10.560]  they've said they're going to contest, that's their official battle plan.
[19:10.560 --> 19:15.880]  They are going to go all out in desperate attempt to try to stop Trump from declaring
[19:15.880 --> 19:17.480]  victory.
[19:17.480 --> 19:20.520]  Big article on InfoWars.com.
[19:20.520 --> 19:25.000]  We are on the verge of widespread civil unrest.
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.720]  Well, actually, we've already been seeing widespread civil unrest.
[19:29.720 --> 19:35.200]  We're going to make sure Trump leaves leftist plan to storm D.C. after election.
[19:35.200 --> 19:37.880]  And again, how much have we told you that?
[19:37.880 --> 19:40.280]  How much of the media attack is saying we're crazy?
[19:40.280 --> 19:41.960]  It's not going to happen.
[19:41.960 --> 19:46.160]  Now they've gone from denying it to the media saying it's a good thing.
[19:46.160 --> 19:52.320]  The media is far and owned, it is enemies of the American people.
[19:52.320 --> 19:58.400]  Six days to the election, and the start of 79 days of hell, watch live.
[19:58.400 --> 20:04.360]  They are planning to block the inauguration of the president.
[20:04.360 --> 20:10.480]  And here's just an example, Philadelphia, another black man with a knife, charges the
[20:10.480 --> 20:16.680]  cops, gets shot, is death by cop, and so people start rioting.
[20:16.680 --> 20:19.720]  We'll go ahead and play that video in a moment.
[20:19.720 --> 20:24.720]  And so, days later, you have ongoing rioting, and a female cop getting run over, and the
[20:24.720 --> 20:26.720]  police running from the rioters.
[20:26.720 --> 20:28.320]  This is the collapse of civilization.
[20:28.320 --> 20:30.720]  Let's go ahead and roll it with how it all started.
[20:30.720 --> 20:32.720]  Yo, watch the world, don't shoot the world.
[20:32.720 --> 20:33.720]  Yo, this is crazy.
[20:33.720 --> 20:34.720]  You're going to smoke.
[20:34.720 --> 20:35.720]  Yo!
[20:35.720 --> 20:36.720]  Yo, watch my world.
[20:36.720 --> 20:37.720]  Yo, this is crazy.
[20:37.720 --> 20:55.720]  So you have the police running from a man with a knife.
[20:55.720 --> 21:04.720]  Oh my gosh, you chased him with a knife.
[21:04.720 --> 21:05.720]  Oh my gosh.
[21:05.720 --> 21:06.720]  Oh my gosh.
[21:06.720 --> 21:09.720]  Bro, they just killed them in front of me.
[21:09.720 --> 21:10.720]  Yo!
[21:10.720 --> 21:15.720]  Meanwhile, 2,000 black men are killed a year by their black men in Chicago.
[21:15.720 --> 21:16.720]  Yo!
[21:16.720 --> 21:17.720]  500 in, mostly Philadelphia.
[21:17.720 --> 21:18.720]  Look at the numbers.
[21:18.720 --> 21:19.720]  Don't let them give them that many shots.
[21:19.720 --> 21:29.120]  But it's only when the cops, it's only when the cops called there, who have to be white,
[21:29.120 --> 21:30.720]  shoot somebody, then they're back.
[21:30.720 --> 21:32.720]  This is crazy, huh?
[21:32.720 --> 21:44.720]  Now, let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[21:44.720 --> 21:47.720]  That's what you call the Darwin Award.
[21:47.720 --> 21:58.720]  This is where the female officer gets run over by a car as a response.
[21:58.720 --> 22:08.720]  Oh, they're coming.
[22:08.720 --> 22:09.720]  Oh!
[22:09.720 --> 22:10.720]  He hit a cop.
[22:10.720 --> 22:11.720]  Oh my god, he hit a cop.
[22:11.720 --> 22:12.720]  He hit a cop.
[22:12.720 --> 22:13.720]  They won't care if they die.
[22:13.720 --> 22:18.720]  They won't ever hear their name when they get shot in the head, any of it.
[22:18.720 --> 22:21.720]  And again, this is all very simple.
[22:21.720 --> 22:26.720]  The globalists didn't just ship our jobs over to China.
[22:26.720 --> 22:30.720]  The globalists didn't just divide our families.
[22:30.720 --> 22:32.720]  Everything is to bring us down.
[22:32.720 --> 22:34.720]  This is an admitted plan.
[22:34.720 --> 22:38.720]  The Communist Chinese, I was reading an article about G.G.
[22:38.720 --> 22:40.720]  Ping and the L.A. Times last week.
[22:40.720 --> 22:43.720]  I think the headline was something like The Rise of the Red Emperor.
[22:43.720 --> 22:46.720]  Just type in L.A. Times does profile on G.G.
[22:46.720 --> 22:47.720]  Ping.
[22:47.720 --> 22:50.720]  And I meant to cover it.
[22:50.720 --> 22:52.720]  Maybe I will next segment.
[22:52.720 --> 22:55.720]  It's actually out there in my briefcase.
[22:55.720 --> 22:59.720]  And it says, we're going to overthrow America.
[22:59.720 --> 23:02.720]  We're going to overthrow the idea of Western democracy.
[23:02.720 --> 23:04.720]  We're going to repudiate it.
[23:04.720 --> 23:09.720]  And I'm reading the L.A. Times in a glowing review of G.G.
[23:09.720 --> 23:10.720]  Ping.
[23:10.720 --> 23:15.720]  The cover of the article, it's a big long article, is him putting a golden crown on.
[23:15.720 --> 23:19.720]  And this is actually an article in the L.A. Times that the pro G.G.
[23:19.720 --> 23:22.720]  Ping, like the Washington Post saying, G.G.
[23:22.720 --> 23:24.720]  Ping must crush Trump.
[23:24.720 --> 23:28.720]  These people are sick.
[23:28.720 --> 23:31.720]  Now, let's show the next video for TV viewers, radio listeners.
[23:31.720 --> 23:38.720]  There's video on infowars.com of the police last night in Philadelphia running from the looters.
[23:38.720 --> 23:43.720]  This is exactly what the system wants so that when they attack the White House,
[23:43.720 --> 23:48.720]  or capitals, or government buildings in the future, just like happening in Ukraine seven years ago,
[23:48.720 --> 23:51.720]  or in other areas of the Middle East,
[23:51.720 --> 23:55.720]  in these color revolutions, the governments will fall,
[23:55.720 --> 23:57.720]  because the media attacks police when they defend themselves.
[23:57.720 --> 24:01.720]  As soon as the global is in control, cops can line people up and shoot them.
[24:01.720 --> 24:02.720]  The media won't cover it.
[24:02.720 --> 24:04.720]  They don't want to get rid of the cops.
[24:04.720 --> 24:09.720]  They want to get control of the cops and get them out from under the Constitution.
[24:09.720 --> 24:13.720]  If you think there's some bad cops now, you wait till the leftist are cops.
[24:13.720 --> 24:18.720]  Go ahead and roll with audio of the police running from the looters.
[24:18.720 --> 24:20.720]  Oh, s***.
[24:20.720 --> 24:23.720]  This is what the collapse of civilization looks like.
[24:26.720 --> 24:29.720]  Because the police have been told to stand down.
[24:43.720 --> 24:44.720]  That's what you like.
[24:44.720 --> 24:48.720]  No law and order, no electricity, no food.
[24:48.720 --> 24:51.720]  You should really go to the Congo.
[24:51.720 --> 24:53.720]  If you think it's so bad here.
[24:53.720 --> 24:56.720]  And now looting stores, which won't come back.
[24:56.720 --> 25:00.720]  Now they'll order everything off Amazon.
[25:00.720 --> 25:03.720]  This is all targeted takedown.
[25:03.720 --> 25:07.720]  Anti-folk for ten years has been training folks how to do this.
[25:07.720 --> 25:11.720]  With the whole, put it on the news, people see people do it, so they go out and do it.
[25:11.720 --> 25:15.720]  All conditioning.
[25:15.720 --> 25:20.720]  So let's take a call when we come back from break from Eric in Pennsylvania.
[25:20.720 --> 25:23.720]  Let's talk about masks in current situation in colleges.
[25:23.720 --> 25:26.720]  Marcus in Texas, we have to start non-compliance.
[25:26.720 --> 25:27.720]  Public with Marcus.
[25:27.720 --> 25:31.720]  Eric in Michigan has intentions for, has inventions for info wars.
[25:31.720 --> 25:32.720]  Also regrets not voting.
[25:32.720 --> 25:35.720]  John in Massachusetts, Hunter Biden wanted to get caught.
[25:35.720 --> 25:36.720]  Yeah, I think so.
[25:36.720 --> 25:40.720]  Psychotics and crazies get so out of control in criminology.
[25:40.720 --> 25:41.720]  They always get more and more reckless.
[25:41.720 --> 25:43.720]  I actually agree with that statement.
[25:43.720 --> 25:46.720]  Scott in Texas, Walt Alex and many, many others.
[25:46.720 --> 25:52.720]  We're going to go right to your phone calls when we start the next segment.
[25:52.720 --> 26:02.720]  But brace yourselves because we're not in a normal situation anymore where we have a government that wants stability and where we have a social contract.
[26:02.720 --> 26:17.720]  Globally, the UN and the WTO, the Communist China, the WHO, the Democratic Party, all of them admit they want the collapse of western civilization because they'll take control of it.
[26:17.720 --> 26:29.720]  So this is a radical form of modern warfare and the mask and keeping the small businesses to social distancing are designed to bankrupt them.
[26:29.720 --> 26:30.720]  And then they're not going to come back.
[26:30.720 --> 26:33.720]  This is the end of our civilization.
[26:33.720 --> 26:40.720]  This is destroying generations of wealth and the AP's got a big article out saying, oh my God, we're going to have a depression.
[26:40.720 --> 26:42.720]  People will be poor forever because of COVID.
[26:42.720 --> 26:44.720]  No, because of the lockdown you implemented.
[26:44.720 --> 26:52.720]  The globalists did it and people's cowardice and ignorance about the economy and the structure of the supply chain is what has allowed this.
[26:52.720 --> 26:54.720]  We are in deep trouble.
[26:54.720 --> 27:07.720]  It was 30 months ago that Info Wars and, of course, it was truly Alex Jones was banned on more than 60 major platforms in one day led by the CEO of Apple Tim Cook who helps China run giant death camps.
[27:07.720 --> 27:10.720]  Always just let that be in the back of your mind.
[27:10.720 --> 27:13.720]  We talk about these monsters and where they're taking us.
[27:13.720 --> 27:15.720]  They have no bottom.
[27:15.720 --> 27:17.720]  And people said, Jones, how are you taking it?
[27:17.720 --> 27:18.720]  And I said, I'm taking it just fine.
[27:18.720 --> 27:19.720]  They're coming for you next.
[27:19.720 --> 27:20.720]  This is a technocracy.
[27:20.720 --> 27:22.720]  They're emerging with big pharma.
[27:22.720 --> 27:24.720]  They're taking over the media.
[27:24.720 --> 27:27.720]  This is a digital psychological dictatorship in their own words.
[27:27.720 --> 27:29.720]  This is a planetary takeover.
[27:29.720 --> 27:33.720]  They're then going to start locking us in our houses using supposed plague threats.
[27:33.720 --> 27:39.720]  That's so the wireless system can come into place with the driverless cars and the robot takeover.
[27:39.720 --> 27:41.720]  How did I know all this would happen?
[27:41.720 --> 27:43.720]  Because they've been saying they're going to do it.
[27:43.720 --> 27:45.720]  You see, it's not that I'm psychic.
[27:45.720 --> 27:48.720]  I know how to read what these monsters are saying.
[27:48.720 --> 27:51.720]  So you have to understand, as crazy as all this sounds, it doesn't come from me.
[27:51.720 --> 27:54.720]  It comes from them.
[27:54.720 --> 27:56.720]  I admire President Trump.
[27:56.720 --> 27:59.720]  He's really proven himself to be unmatched.
[27:59.720 --> 28:02.720]  His wit, his focus, his commitment, his energy.
[28:02.720 --> 28:05.720]  And I just want to affirm my admiration for President Trump.
[28:05.720 --> 28:06.720]  He's not God.
[28:06.720 --> 28:07.720]  He's not an angel.
[28:07.720 --> 28:08.720]  He's not perfect.
[28:08.720 --> 28:15.720]  But the way he has used judo on the forces of the New World Order has been really incredible.
[28:15.720 --> 28:21.720]  The way he's pragmatically stood up for prosperity and basic freedom.
[28:21.720 --> 28:27.720]  And the way he stood up against these America-hating, God-hating, family-hating trash is beautiful.
[28:27.720 --> 28:28.720]  And I'm serious.
[28:28.720 --> 28:32.720]  I was just bringing tears to my eyes, driving to work this morning thinking about President Trump.
[28:32.720 --> 28:35.720]  I just want to say I admire the President so much.
[28:35.720 --> 28:40.720]  And I appreciate you, the listeners, and everybody for which you've done.
[28:40.720 --> 28:41.720]  I admire you.
[28:41.720 --> 28:43.720]  That's what you call it, thank me, folks.
[28:43.720 --> 28:45.720]  I admire you. I admire Trump.
[28:45.720 --> 28:48.720]  I admire all of you that are involved in this fight.
[28:48.720 --> 28:49.720]  And I just wish I could do more.
[28:49.720 --> 28:51.720]  We're going to win this fight together.
[28:51.720 --> 28:52.720]  This election's so important.
[28:52.720 --> 29:21.720]  Please pray for President Trump.
[29:22.720 --> 29:48.720]  Thank you.
[29:48.720 --> 29:55.720]  Thank you.
[30:18.720 --> 30:43.720]  Thank you.
[30:43.720 --> 31:00.720]  What you're seeing happen is how once free nations and republics fall, when it falls,
[31:00.720 --> 31:05.720]  they're going to loot every bit of wealth you've ever produced and make you a total financial slave.
[31:05.720 --> 31:08.720]  You and your family are under globalist attack.
[31:08.720 --> 31:10.720]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[31:10.720 --> 31:15.720]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday transmission.
[31:15.720 --> 31:23.720]  Now, I'm going to your phone calls, but I have a very important announcement that I need to make right now that we knew was going to be coming.
[31:23.720 --> 31:26.720]  This is a war.
[31:26.720 --> 31:38.720]  And building up to the election in six days, we knew and predicted that they would accelerate censorship to as close to 100% as big tech could,
[31:38.720 --> 31:47.720]  meaning hundreds of millions of people who have profiles as pro-Trump nationalist or conservatives will be shadow banned or completely blocked or completely banned.
[31:47.720 --> 31:51.720]  Big tech has announced that's exactly what they're doing.
[31:51.720 --> 31:57.720]  All of this was incremental to set the precedent to censor and to surveil you and totally control you.
[31:57.720 --> 31:59.720]  It's organized crime.
[31:59.720 --> 32:00.720]  They're bigger than the government.
[32:00.720 --> 32:02.720]  They're surveilling you more than government.
[32:02.720 --> 32:03.720]  They're working in tandem.
[32:03.720 --> 32:06.720]  These are cartel operations.
[32:06.720 --> 32:20.720]  So we built Bandod video a year and a half ago so that we have a place to shoot video reports and host videos that are censored and show you what was going on and have live streams of the TV show and the radio shows.
[32:20.720 --> 32:27.720]  And it's literally gotten Bandod video.
[32:27.720 --> 32:28.720]  I don't know.
[32:28.720 --> 32:30.720]  10 million views just the last few days.
[32:30.720 --> 32:32.720]  It's really exploded.
[32:32.720 --> 32:34.720]  Thanks to you sharing Bandod video.
[32:34.720 --> 32:40.720]  Now, starting as you know, about two months ago, they banned the URL Bandod video on Twitter.
[32:40.720 --> 32:43.720]  And they began banning other URLs.
[32:43.720 --> 32:46.720]  When Jack Dorsey was asked about it, he says, oh, we don't ban URLs.
[32:46.720 --> 32:47.720]  That's an accident.
[32:47.720 --> 32:49.720]  He lied to Congress again.
[32:49.720 --> 32:50.720]  Never gets in trouble.
[32:50.720 --> 32:51.720]  Why shouldn't he?
[32:51.720 --> 33:00.720]  So we created a system that mirrors Bandod video with 2020 election center.com.
[33:00.720 --> 33:05.720]  We're going to go ahead and show the band by Jack URL on screen, please.
[33:05.720 --> 33:16.720]  So now we have another URL that is a link that will copy over all the information at Bandod video.
[33:16.720 --> 33:18.720]  And I believe it's censored by Jack.
[33:18.720 --> 33:21.720]  I was talking to him during the break.
[33:21.720 --> 33:23.720]  And I said, when we came back, we were going to show that.
[33:23.720 --> 33:26.720]  So can we show that?
[33:26.720 --> 33:31.720]  There it is censored by Jack.com.
[33:31.720 --> 33:36.720]  And that is the same side as Bandod video, the same side as 2020 election center.com.
[33:36.720 --> 33:44.720]  And when you go there, it's the same URLs, it's the same hits, the same video views, the same comments, your profiles are on there.
[33:44.720 --> 33:48.720]  It took millions of dollars to build this infrastructure, millions to put it up.
[33:48.720 --> 33:49.720]  It's money you spent.
[33:49.720 --> 33:55.720]  It's a weapon you built that was designed to be standing during this period.
[33:55.720 --> 33:59.720]  So that when there's evidence of election fraud.
[33:59.720 --> 34:03.720]  And so that when there's evidence of election officials engaging in corruption.
[34:03.720 --> 34:11.720]  And so when there's evidence of all of this, there will be a place for it to be hosted and for it to be game changing.
[34:11.720 --> 34:16.720]  So that other citizens and law enforcement and the president can even be made aware of it.
[34:16.720 --> 34:22.720]  So many times it's info wars or it's project Veritas that makes the president aware of what's happening.
[34:22.720 --> 34:28.720]  And it's always you sharing the links that gets it past the censors and into the president's hands.
[34:28.720 --> 34:36.720]  So I cannot tell you how critical it is to go to censored by Jack one word censored by Jack.com.
[34:36.720 --> 34:40.720]  They'll probably restrict that today or so we've got a new URL after that.
[34:40.720 --> 34:46.720]  But this is war gaming now you've got to be in the fight censored by Jack.com.
[34:46.720 --> 34:54.720]  And then go find at that URL what it is you want to share, what it is you want to link, what it is you want to promote.
[34:54.720 --> 34:57.720]  And so in a live time, why are they doing this?
[34:57.720 --> 35:01.720]  Well, in Detroit, Michigan.
[35:01.720 --> 35:03.720]  And we're hosting the video as well.
[35:03.720 --> 35:09.720]  Gateway pundit got the footage of the election officials talking about how to lie to voters.
[35:09.720 --> 35:15.720]  How to keep them from discovering that they are using ballots that have been falsified.
[35:15.720 --> 35:19.720]  It's all on video. We'll be playing that next hour.
[35:19.720 --> 35:24.720]  But that's the type of stuff that's an info wars.com, but we can't just have a YouTube or a Facebook or Twitter.
[35:24.720 --> 35:26.720]  We're not allowed to have that. We're blocked.
[35:26.720 --> 35:34.720]  So we built our own thing so that we can go out and get all the videos that are being banned by other people and others.
[35:34.720 --> 35:36.720]  And our own reports and fight back.
[35:36.720 --> 35:42.720]  We're Americans fighting for our country in these desperate straits.
[35:42.720 --> 35:50.720]  So all I'm saying is for your own good, for my own good, for all of us collectively, your email list.
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.720]  Your private messengers on Twitter, on Facebook, they're going to ban you anyways.
[35:55.720 --> 36:00.720]  Promote it on there while you still can in word of mouth, censoredbyjack.com.
[36:00.720 --> 36:02.720]  And it's obviously not just Twitter.
[36:02.720 --> 36:05.720]  It's other platforms now trying to block 2020electioncenter.com.
[36:05.720 --> 36:11.720]  But censoredbyjack.com is the one, I want one that sounds more election-y.
[36:11.720 --> 36:16.720]  I want another URL by tomorrow that again has an election sound to it because that's what this is.
[36:16.720 --> 36:22.720]  Like censoredelection.com, censoredelection.com.
[36:22.720 --> 36:28.720]  And we can get that maybe or censored2020.com, something like that.
[36:28.720 --> 36:33.720]  And then people will be able to see that liveelection.com, whatever.
[36:33.720 --> 36:35.720]  We'll have something for you by tomorrow.
[36:35.720 --> 36:38.720]  But right now it's censoredbyjack.com.
[36:38.720 --> 36:42.720]  And don't let them win. This is literally a boxing match.
[36:42.720 --> 36:44.720]  This is a fight.
[36:44.720 --> 36:46.720]  And they want a post-industrial world.
[36:46.720 --> 36:47.720]  That's what Bill Gates has said.
[36:47.720 --> 36:51.720]  Oh, if something's not essential, like a football game or a restaurant, you're never reopening.
[36:51.720 --> 36:54.720]  We have to say no, the UN and Bill Gates aren't the boss.
[36:54.720 --> 36:57.720]  And Big Tech goes, well, if you don't agree with them, you can't communicate.
[36:57.720 --> 36:58.720]  Well, that's racketeering.
[36:58.720 --> 37:04.720]  That's organized crime by Big Tech who's already gotten double the wealth the last year under the lockdown to shut that other damn competition.
[37:04.720 --> 37:06.720]  This is outrageously obvious.
[37:06.720 --> 37:09.720]  And that's why they've got to silence you and I and everyone.
[37:09.720 --> 37:16.720]  Because they can't have us on air without outrageous criminal crap like this going on if we have a voice.
[37:16.720 --> 37:21.720]  But you're going to have to be your own voice now.
[37:21.720 --> 37:24.720]  These people are sick.
[37:24.720 --> 37:26.720]  They're not just one monopoly of information for themselves.
[37:26.720 --> 37:33.720]  They want power over elections, power over medical choices, power to cover up what's happening.
[37:33.720 --> 37:38.720]  Twitter says President Trump again, then spammed users with our well-earned messages saying,
[37:38.720 --> 37:40.720]  there is no problem with mail-in ballots.
[37:40.720 --> 37:41.720]  There is no fraud.
[37:41.720 --> 37:46.720]  Trump is wrong.
[37:46.720 --> 37:48.720]  Oh, but Jack comes out and says, oh, we don't block straight URLs.
[37:48.720 --> 37:53.720]  He's a lying criminal.
[37:53.720 --> 37:58.720]  But this is what they're doing ahead of the election because they're going to say when Trump announces victory that he lost
[37:58.720 --> 38:00.720]  and they're going to try to burn the country down.
[38:00.720 --> 38:02.720]  We're here.
[38:02.720 --> 38:06.720]  And it's Trump's biggest failure that he's not acted against the racketeering.
[38:06.720 --> 38:07.720]  Now they're suing Google.
[38:07.720 --> 38:09.720]  Now they're having emergency meetings with Twitter.
[38:09.720 --> 38:10.720]  It's not enough.
[38:10.720 --> 38:15.720]  It's a dollar short and 10 days late.
[38:15.720 --> 38:18.720]  It's a six months late, a year late, two years late.
[38:18.720 --> 38:19.720]  All right, I'm going to go to break this.
[38:19.720 --> 38:20.720]  This happened.
[38:20.720 --> 38:23.720]  I'm going to go quickly to Eric and Pennsylvania.
[38:23.720 --> 38:33.720]  I'm going to break this.
[38:33.720 --> 38:35.720]  We knew this was coming.
[38:35.720 --> 38:37.720]  We knew that all this was unfolding.
[38:37.720 --> 38:45.720]  And this is multinational corporations allied with communist China and a bunch of traders in the media making a good run at us.
[38:45.720 --> 38:50.720]  They're making a real run at the country and admitting this is what they want.
[38:50.720 --> 38:53.720]  And you look at the corporate control media, most of it far and owned.
[38:53.720 --> 38:55.720]  There's such criminals in lockstep.
[38:55.720 --> 39:07.720]  They've covered up Hunter Biden and the pedophilia and the and the barisma and the smoking guns of smoking guns of paper play and bribery and his daughter's diary and all of it.
[39:07.720 --> 39:09.720]  They all lockstep cover it up.
[39:09.720 --> 39:12.720]  And now they're trying to stop the communication of you.
[39:12.720 --> 39:20.720]  Of info wars.com and news wars.com and band video videos on all these platforms.
[39:20.720 --> 39:26.720]  And now they're moving towards the private messengers and now Google has been caught blocking emails that have not just us but Jordan Peterson videos.
[39:26.720 --> 39:31.720]  That's why you've got to override them because the truth will set us free.
[39:31.720 --> 39:36.720]  As Christ said, you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.
[39:36.720 --> 39:38.720]  But you must carry the light in the dark of the night.
[39:38.720 --> 39:43.720]  You must be the modern Paul Revere's to carry the gospel of freedom to every corner of the world.
[39:43.720 --> 39:44.720]  And you're doing it.
[39:44.720 --> 39:49.720]  I salute you and the enemy is scared of their going to lose if you push hard in the next six days.
[39:49.720 --> 39:51.720]  Then they'll be the 79 days of hell.
[39:51.720 --> 40:09.720]  It's on record. It's not disputed. It was rolled out more than eight months ago in common China. Now it's in Europe. Now it's the United States, Canada and most other industrial parts of the planet.
[40:09.720 --> 40:23.720]  And they really get upset if you ask for a paper menu, but of course they have them. Now what are they saying there? Well, you've got to have a cell phone to come in their establishment and that you can't have a piece of paper because everybody's diseased and we're spreading germs.
[40:23.720 --> 40:28.720]  It's absolutely asinine. They can throw away the little one sheet papers if they actually believe that.
[40:28.720 --> 40:39.720]  Now what this really is, is a contact tracing database. Again, this is admitted that everyone's being habituated in the scan to be part of. So in the future, everywhere you go is tracked officially.
[40:39.720 --> 40:43.720]  Now your cell phone's already tracking. You already have home assistants watching and listening to you in your house.
[40:43.720 --> 40:52.720]  But now this is officially rolling the sound where you won't buy or sell, have a job, get an airplane without it. And Bill Gates even admits it. So think about that folks and look out.
[40:52.720 --> 41:02.720]  As I taped this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out from the election. And the globalist controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to them and turned against them.
[41:02.720 --> 41:15.720]  But the whole planet is a huge populist realignment. And so they've openly said, we need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship, but physically attacking and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda.
[41:15.720 --> 41:24.720]  And they're on record saying that once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's base and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison.
[41:24.720 --> 41:33.720]  This is what all the old Clintons are saying. It's what the Obama bots are saying. It's what Keith Overman's saying. It's what Nancy Pelosi saying.
[41:33.720 --> 41:42.720]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent. And they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and force denoculations.
[41:42.720 --> 41:46.720]  Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and the sick vaccines will be voluntary.
[41:46.720 --> 41:53.720]  Donald Trump or die. We've got to get Trump in. Everybody get out there and vote and tell your family to vote now.
[41:53.720 --> 42:03.720]  Finally, the stagnant Republican establishment understands what info wars understand, what our listeners understand, what Donald Trump understands.
[42:03.720 --> 42:13.720]  We're in a digital civil war. There are giant filters filtering out 99% of communication going on on every major tech platform.
[42:13.720 --> 42:19.720]  And now they're doing it to the private apps. They're doing it to text messages. They're doing it to email.
[42:19.720 --> 42:23.720]  This is mafia organized crime election meddling.
[42:23.720 --> 42:35.720]  But finally, when they blocked the Hunter Biden and the Burisma information and the Chinese information and the photos and the crack pipes and all the rest of it has been confirmed to be real, Biden hasn't denied it.
[42:35.720 --> 42:44.720]  Finally, Congress got pissed and said, this is out of control. You've got to stop it now. We're taking action. Oh, and Jack Dorsey went, oh, what's the mistake? It's an accident. It's an accident.
[42:44.720 --> 42:50.720]  But they keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff. Well, info wars is calling their bluff.
[42:50.720 --> 42:53.720]  And I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[43:21.720 --> 43:25.720]  But you have to keep social distancing and wearing masks. They're now saying forever.
[43:25.720 --> 43:29.720]  Last week, it was 10 years. Now it's forever. See how the power grab works?
[43:29.720 --> 43:42.720]  So when you hear them saying Trump is surrendering and his chief of staff is surrendering to coronavirus, when they say we just have to learn to live with it and boost our immunity with things like vitamin D, C, and of course, sink, that's the reality.
[43:42.720 --> 43:48.720]  That's not fear mongering. That's not giving in to the power grab and the endless fear of the new world order.
[43:48.720 --> 43:53.720]  They create a problem to which there is no solution. But they are again the people that say they've got to be in charge.
[43:57.720 --> 44:00.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:00.720 --> 44:25.720]  Everyone I talked to is like on my Facebook, on my Twitter. I used to get thousands of responses for hundreds. And now it's like two or three or zero.
[44:25.720 --> 44:35.720]  You're all being shadow banned. And, you know, if you're a smart out there and aren't on Twitter and Facebook over the years, you're smart enough not to have a cell phone or, you know, doing that.
[44:35.720 --> 44:40.720]  You're like, I don't care. Let's just talk radio. Well, they're trying to phase that out, too.
[44:40.720 --> 44:46.720]  And so there is a total takeover here, election meddling at a scale never before seen as they try to suppress.
[44:46.720 --> 44:57.720]  Info wars videos project veritas videos videos of the president videos of election officials admitting that they're running scams because they can't have this come out or it's over for them.
[44:57.720 --> 45:06.720]  All these people that sold America out the Democratic Party and others, they've gotten billions of dollars a piece in many cases hundreds of millions and millions low level.
[45:06.720 --> 45:21.720]  China bought this country. And so they believe they own it. And China is threatened to bring out all the dirt. It's not just the Patriots bringing out dirt up front to get the deep state.
[45:21.720 --> 45:39.720]  China is like if you don't keep this country under our control, along with their globalist collaborators, globalists are saying this to their minions, we're going to bring out this information. You think it's bad what Trump's got on you. Wait till we release this.
[45:39.720 --> 45:51.720]  So this is a very explosive, dangerous time. I don't need to tell you that. Give it to God, pray to God for justice and an awakening, but then take action. And the best way to do it is I cannot tell you again.
[45:51.720 --> 45:58.720]  Local radio stations are listening to member back when TV didn't watch you. You watched it. There was no connection.
[45:58.720 --> 46:10.720]  Remember, radio, you listen to it as it listened to you. This two way stuff is all designed to control us. So tell folks about those local stations and support them. It's so incredibly important. All right, let's go to your calls.
[46:10.720 --> 46:13.720]  Eric and Pennsylvania. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[46:13.720 --> 46:14.720]  Can you hear me?
[46:14.720 --> 46:18.720]  Yes, I can. Go ahead.
[46:18.720 --> 46:29.720]  I'm going to put you on hold, brother. Your phone's bad now. We're going to check it. Make sure it's all right. I want to be able to go to you, but I couldn't hear you once we went there.
[46:29.720 --> 46:35.720]  All right, I'm going to go to another caller here in just a moment.
[46:35.720 --> 46:41.720]  Just get ready because I'm going to go to you. All right. Let's go to John in Massachusetts. John, you're on the air.
[46:41.720 --> 47:01.720]  Alex, it's great to be with you. I've been really looking at this Hunter Biden situation and there's some dots to connect here. First of all, with his drug problems, he's self-medicating for some reason, whether it's something that he's been through with a kid based on the text messages and the way that the rest of the family has been treated.
[47:01.720 --> 47:16.720]  It's not out of the realm of possibility that he's been abused himself. Looks like he's been forced into this job. You know, we're all accountable for our own actions, but it looks like he was forced into being the bag man doing daddy's dirty work.
[47:16.720 --> 47:25.720]  Oh, there's no doubt. There's no doubt. I mean, his sister talks about her dad abusing her, probably sexually, and now she's on hard drugs because of it.
[47:25.720 --> 47:36.720]  Yeah, and either he feels guilty for what he's done or he's trying to save the world from his daddy, but I believe that he brought those laptops and knowing that he would get caught.
[47:36.720 --> 47:51.720]  I agree with you. Whether he did it to save people or at a subconscious level, the subconscious will do things different than the conscience, and a lot of bad people have a bad conscious mind, but part of the subconscious is good, and that's why serial killers and others always are trying to get caught.
[47:51.720 --> 48:03.720]  And that's 100% what I think happened here, because you know all these DC staffers have their own IT people. They don't go to a run of the mill, you know, max store with all this incriminating evidence on a hard drive.
[48:03.720 --> 48:06.720]  You know, so I feel like he did this intentionally.
[48:06.720 --> 48:17.720]  By the way, that's what the max store owner thought. He's like, who would give me this? Are they trying to set us up? Or does he use this as blackmail against a different group saying this is being held by somebody?
[48:17.720 --> 48:22.720]  He just couldn't, they couldn't, and so he called the FBI for protection and they wouldn't do anything.
[48:22.720 --> 48:40.720]  It's unbelievable. Ray needs to go, Haskell needs to go. We need to clean out these intelligence agencies. You know, I believe Donald Trump is going to win landslide victory, and I pray that, you know, more people show up that, you know, any type of attempt by the left to try to steal this is obvious to anyone who's there.
[48:40.720 --> 48:52.720]  And I mean, you look at the crowd sizes and it's already pretty obvious who's in the lead. But you know, we just need to pray and we need to rebuke the enemy and, you know, just have the hand to God on this election.
[48:52.720 --> 48:56.720]  We have to turn it over to God. That doesn't mean we don't take action, but I'm talking to myself.
[48:56.720 --> 49:13.720]  When I've got one finger pointed at you, I got three back at me. I've got to give it to God. And I've got to not stress myself out or I'll let the enemy destroy me through my own pressure. We've just got to give it to God and just be absolutely calm and focused about our job.
[49:13.720 --> 49:14.720]  God bless you.
[49:14.720 --> 49:24.720]  I agree with Alex in Florida. Trump missed out on a big opportunity. Trump should have been talking about election meddling and about big tech censorship more.
[49:24.720 --> 49:32.720]  He's not been talking about that a lot in the last few weeks, though it's all really peak and it's really obvious this is going on.
[49:32.720 --> 49:44.720]  He should be warning people about the Internet kill switch. They've basically already implemented that they're slowly dialing up right now against conservatives, nationalists, populists and patriots. Alex, give us your take on this.
[49:44.720 --> 50:03.720]  Yeah, that was the biggest letdown for me. I mean, granted, he still won that debate in a landslide because Sleepy Joe, but when that moderator asked, oh, I ran in Russia meddling, I would have literally taken that opportunity to say, no, it's Google, it's YouTube, it's Facebook, it's everybody within our own country.
[50:03.720 --> 50:06.720]  It's domestic interfering. It's not overseas.
[50:06.720 --> 50:16.720]  And if you start doing that, they'd have more respect for him because, again, Google, Facebook, all this was set up by US national security. It's privately owned. It works for the globalist now.
[50:16.720 --> 50:24.720]  But the CIA and others started it all. Trump's been told all that they say, sir, it'll hurt the stock market. It will hurt our infrastructure. Don't don't damage big tech too much.
[50:24.720 --> 50:33.720]  We needed to defeat China later, but it's already in China's hands. He needs to have the leadership removed. They're part of critical national security infrastructure.
[50:33.720 --> 50:44.720]  You don't see the telecom heads acting like this because they got trust busted. They're on very short leashes. How the hell did big tech become God? How did Bill Gates, how did I fall asleep and wake up and he's my damn doctor?
[50:44.720 --> 50:59.720]  Get off my back, you little piece of filth. It pisses me off. He's on TV like 10 years until the restrictions are up, and by then they'll never get rid of them. It's a cult. The globalists are a control freak cult.
[50:59.720 --> 51:09.720]  And that's why I wanted to get to the next point, which is why I called in, you know, about moving forward because I remember years ago when I watched that movie you were a part of, American.
[51:09.720 --> 51:19.720]  And that just stuck with me because I watched it. I was a lot younger than, you know, moving forward. It's like our lives you can take our integrity never for them to think we're going to roll over and not fight back.
[51:19.720 --> 51:25.720]  They must be out of their mind. So then moving forward, how do we do this in the best way possible? Because of course things are going to get ugly before they get better.
[51:25.720 --> 51:30.720]  I actually had a dream with you not too long ago of us literally holding back a dam.
[51:30.720 --> 51:37.720]  And then months later you created the communism dam, you know, picture and I was like, oh, gee, all the hairs in my, on my body.
[51:37.720 --> 51:47.720]  Well, brother, that's because there is a group collective, the scientists have proven it. They don't believe in a spirit, but now they're having to admit there's an electrochemical transmission and there's an energy force in all the universe.
[51:47.720 --> 51:59.720]  Oh, that's Star Wars. No, the establishment knows about it and puts it in movies and then turns it into some mumbo jumbo. But there's an energy field and we're energy beings, like beings that are interconnected to each other.
[51:59.720 --> 52:08.720]  We're individuals, but we're, we're collective and they're trying to suppress that great truth. So we are in the zeitgeist brother and I really appreciate you.
[52:08.720 --> 52:11.720]  Let's jam in another call here.
[52:11.720 --> 52:16.720]  Who's up next? That would be, that would be Marcos in Texas.
[52:16.720 --> 52:18.720]  Thank you, Marcos. Go ahead.
[52:18.720 --> 52:25.720]  Yeah, um, Alex, I just wanted to say you got a little mad earlier and you need to just be nicer. You need to be nicer.
[52:25.720 --> 52:31.720]  Or else we're going to start, we're going to pass out Play-Doh to everybody because you're going to start hurting people's feelings.
[52:31.720 --> 52:44.720]  Well, hold on. When I said earlier that I need to learn to not take on the weight mad at myself that we're not beating this and beating my brains out psychologically and grinding my teeth off to the point of absolute pain.
[52:44.720 --> 52:49.720]  I'm just saying there has to be a balance. Other folks are in comas and just don't even give a damn. They're like zombies.
[52:49.720 --> 52:54.720]  I'm so super awake. It's killing me. We've got to find a medium in there is what I'm saying.
[52:54.720 --> 53:08.720]  We do have to find the medium, but I guess I'm just here to express the, the, the side of, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's like, it's like every day for like a whole year, your dad's putting arsenic in your Cheerios and then you tell everybody about it.
[53:08.720 --> 53:13.720]  And they're like, well, we don't believe you that that happened and you get mad at them and they're like, well, you need to be nice.
[53:13.720 --> 53:19.720]  It's like, okay, I'm going to hold you over. Marcos, you are. Hold on. Thank you. Put them on hold. We got to go to break.
[53:19.720 --> 53:27.720]  You're reading my mind. That's what I was going to come on air this morning and say first is I'm just so pissed that they're trying to warn people.
[53:27.720 --> 53:35.720]  And they're laughing at me because they think I'm making it up. I was talking to a very prominent national talk show host, probably the biggest yesterday at length.
[53:35.720 --> 53:43.720]  And I was telling them stuff and they were, they were fact checking everything I said, but there was so much I was telling them they couldn't fact check it all.
[53:43.720 --> 53:52.720]  And they're just like, I don't believe you. That's too crazy. I mean, it's all there. It's all admitted. It's real world government, the new world order, the pedophile rings, the post human era.
[53:52.720 --> 54:04.720]  This is insane. And people damn well better figure this out. And then to be trapped in purgatory or in this phantom zone where I'm able to get to you and we got a lot of radio stations, but it's not enough, man.
[54:04.720 --> 54:11.720]  I want to turn this around. I want to beat these people. And now I watched the censorship hitting everybody and I just dread what happens if Trump doesn't win.
[54:11.720 --> 54:19.720]  I mean, we are just we're in so much trouble and they're this close to taking the police departments over and the police are going to be agents of the globalist.
[54:19.720 --> 54:23.720]  And then it's just absolute physical war and that pisses me off.
[54:23.720 --> 54:30.720]  So we're going to go to break. Please don't forget only a few days left in the Black Friday comes in October sale at 60% off.
[54:30.720 --> 54:40.720]  Stored free shipping and triple patriot points, the triple patriot points and the free shipping will end next week. Great products like X to great products like vitamin refusion.
[54:40.720 --> 54:41.720]  Get it while you still can.
[54:43.720 --> 54:49.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[54:49.720 --> 55:11.720]  Info wars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[55:11.720 --> 55:19.720]  The great awakening is here. Go to band.video, download the videos and share.
[55:19.720 --> 55:30.720]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[55:30.720 --> 55:51.720]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read if you want your children to listen to you whisper and it's true.
[55:51.720 --> 55:58.720]  A lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling, even if what they're talking about is important, people tend to tune it out.
[55:58.720 --> 56:06.720]  You know why I know that? Because I'm Alex Jones and I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried about the new world order.
[56:06.720 --> 56:13.720]  And I read about all their plans to lock down civilization, start the third world and then enslave the first world.
[56:13.720 --> 56:18.720]  So I've been really, really loud and really, really aggressive and we've had a big effect.
[56:18.720 --> 56:27.720]  But now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way we can get people to think for themselves before it's too late.
[56:27.720 --> 56:32.720]  The lockdown, social distancing, the mask is meant to end human civilization.
[56:32.720 --> 56:36.720]  We are under a civilization collapse weapon.
[56:36.720 --> 56:53.720]  So this is live and death. Please share infowarstore.com and band our video and watch our live election coverage.
[57:06.720 --> 57:33.720]  Alright, I'm not complaining. I'm just saying. There is so much big news breaking.
[57:33.720 --> 57:39.720]  The voting judge manager in Detroit telling them how to a lot of people and how to change ballots illegally.
[57:39.720 --> 57:49.720]  Other videos breaking. I could go to jail. Texas ballot chaser illegally pressures voters to change votes to Democrats.
[57:49.720 --> 57:54.720]  This article just went live by Jamie White on infowars.com. I hadn't seen it.
[57:54.720 --> 58:03.720]  They literally during the two minute break can me this right when James O'Keefe calls me and says, have you seen this and then text it to me.
[58:03.720 --> 58:09.720]  So I'm busy processing that. This is just beyond bombshell and we'll keep going to your calls.
[58:09.720 --> 58:12.720]  I'm going to play part of this project Veritas thing and then I've got the Michigan thing.
[58:12.720 --> 58:20.720]  But any of this you try to promote on Twitter, Facebook or YouTube, boom, they're just blocking it because there is no election fraud.
[58:20.720 --> 58:25.720]  Why the FBI director said so. He also said white people are bad.
[58:25.720 --> 58:33.720]  It's a foreign takeover. And Trump is going to fire Ray when he gets reelected, but if he's reelected.
[58:33.720 --> 58:39.720]  And this is so sick. These people are so bad. Marcos, you were getting into how frustrating it is.
[58:39.720 --> 58:46.720]  It's like catching your dad put an arsenic hypothetically as you said for folks that just joined us in your cereal for a few months.
[58:46.720 --> 58:52.720]  You finally catch him and nobody believes you. But we've caught them and it's so obvious and it's crazy.
[58:52.720 --> 58:58.720]  Because if they if they win, they admit they're going to arrest all of us because they know that they're close to being defeated.
[58:58.720 --> 59:06.720]  I mean, I don't think people realize how much danger they're in or how this lockdown is going to cause generations of poverty and it's already killed millions via starvation.
[59:06.720 --> 59:08.720]  And it's so sick brother.
[59:08.720 --> 59:15.720]  No, and how many people have told me, you know, I agree with your message, but it's the way you're saying it.
[59:15.720 --> 59:21.720]  How come you haven't said it one time at all in your life, but you want to tell me to not yell about it?
[59:21.720 --> 59:24.720]  And it's just like, you're going to get what you want and it's going to be there.
[59:24.720 --> 59:28.720]  They're in a comfort zone. They're not leaders and they and they're not informed.
[59:28.720 --> 59:33.720]  So they think you being informed is showing off. They're threatened by it. They think you're making it up.
[59:33.720 --> 59:34.720]  Why?
[59:34.720 --> 59:46.720]  I think they're and tell people that the minimum maximum of the main sun mass of coronal ejections is the main driver of 99.7% according to large spectrometer NASA analysis of the overall climate of Earth.
[59:46.720 --> 59:54.720]  And the negligent cause and CO2 equations can also be offset by the volcanic potash interaction with the calculus over squared frequency.
[59:54.720 --> 59:59.720]  And they just they just think you're making it up because they don't know anything. They don't know anything.
[59:59.720 --> 1:00:02.720]  And they love being conned. Sorry, go ahead.
[1:00:02.720 --> 1:00:11.720]  No, you're you're you're and this is this is why I called in is because there's there's there's a we're at that point where Trump is fighting for us so hard.
[1:00:11.720 --> 1:00:17.720]  If you're not going to sit here and take your mask off at a damn chilly excuse me, then you're not you're not going to.
[1:00:17.720 --> 1:00:22.720]  And that's why he's doing it. He's taking the mask off. He's having events. He's not social distancing.
[1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:29.720]  I mean, I even saw Amy Comey Barrett and Clarence Thomas Trump tried to tell him get together.
[1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:33.720]  They're like, oh, no, have the husband do it because even the judges want to follow this crap.
[1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:36.720]  They love it because it's a virtue signal.
[1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:43.720]  Totally. If you if you were to go up to a church in the 1700s and straight painted you, I mean, you'd be savagely beaten in the streets.
[1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:49.720]  These people are raping raping kids on TV, basically that with their genitals out, glitter on.
[1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:53.720]  And Islam has exactly and Islam has announced that it's conquered Europe.
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:59.720]  France has announced it's now Islamic. I mean, because because France has no soul, they gave up their Christian soul.
[1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:02.720]  We have to stand for something or we'll fall for anything, brother.
[1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:06.720]  They were black. What are we doing?
[1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:09.720]  Your phone cut up. They worship the black. What?
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:13.720]  They worship the black cubes. They worship a black cube.
[1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:23.720]  You're talking about Islam. You know, it's it's it's it's wild. You got some meteorite black cube.
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:31.720]  All right, brother, I appreciate your call. I'm going to try to go quicker to Tamara, Jason, Scott, Walt, Joe, beefy and the order your calls are received.
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:35.720]  We're going to go to Scott and Walt next and so much more.
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:37.720]  And then I've got just there's so much news.
[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:44.720]  It's all in info wars.com and news wars.com. We got the James O'Keefe info as well info wars.com.
[1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:52.720]  Tomorrow's news today, today, today, spread the wide leagues while you still can.
[1:01:52.720 --> 1:02:00.720]  I admire President Trump. He's really proven himself to be unmatched in his wit, his focus, his commitment, his energy.
[1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:04.720]  And I just want to affirm my admiration for President Trump. He's not God.
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:13.720]  He's not an angel. He's not perfect. But the way he has used judo on the forces of the New World Order has been really incredible.
[1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:18.720]  The way he's pragmatically stood up for prosperity and basic freedom.
[1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:25.720]  And the way he stood up against these America hating, God hating, family hating trash is beautiful.
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:28.720]  And I'm serious. I was just bringing tears to my eyes.
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:34.720]  Driving to work this morning thinking about President Trump. I just want to say I admire the President so much.
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:41.720]  And I appreciate you, the listeners and everybody for what you've done. I admire you. That's what you call it, thank me.
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:48.720]  Folks, I admire you. I admire Trump. I admire all of you that are involved in this fight and I just wish I could do more.
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:59.720]  I admire this fight together. This election is so important. Please pray for President Trump.
[1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:23.720]  We have massive breaking election fraud news in Texas and Michigan coming up next segment.
[1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:27.720]  I'm going to continue with calls throughout this hour. Huge news.
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:36.720]  As Bill Gates announces himself, doctor of the world and says the lockdown will never end. That is all coming up.
[1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:42.720]  I'm sitting there talking to a major businessman yesterday about businesses in Texas.
[1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:47.720]  And he said, I remember talking to him six months ago and I said the lockdown is not going to end for many years.
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:52.720]  He said, oh, it'll be open. And then last night I'm talking to him here say afternoon.
[1:03:52.720 --> 1:03:57.720]  He's like, yeah, I bet they actually won't open things up with all the separation and things for a couple more years.
[1:03:57.720 --> 1:04:07.720]  I'm like, yeah, it's never going to end. Only the big box stores will stay open. Everything else will be delivered by Amazon Robot.
[1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:12.720]  We've lost in most cities 50% of the businesses and most are never coming back.
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:17.720]  Iconic New York City barber shop closed up for 73 years in business due to lockdown.
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:20.720]  My dad looked like Einstein lately, not getting a haircut.
[1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:26.720]  Finally, his local barber reopened after eight months and they make him wear a mask, trimming his beard.
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:34.720]  He has to move side to side while he does it all. And again, a neurotic virtue signal.
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:40.720]  I said, dad, find a barber that comes to your house or that doesn't do that.
[1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:43.720]  But this is the medical tyranny. Oh, you're good.
[1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:49.720]  Some businesses do rapid reaction COVID tests every week on all their employees and they get false positives.
[1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:56.720]  Meatpacking plants have 3,000 people. In one example, half of them say they have COVID, none of them are sick, asymptomatic.
[1:04:56.720 --> 1:05:02.720]  Oh, but it's so moral. It's so good.
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:05.720]  This is the lockdown of society. This is the control grid.
[1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:12.720]  This is the end of mobility, the end of the open road, the takeover of the robot cars, all the little scientific testing systems.
[1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:19.720]  This is the 21st century and we have to reject it, not just have it thrust upon us and then we rapidly adopt it.
[1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:26.720]  Remember just eight months ago, the UN and China told us, oh, just a 15 days and not overwhelm the hospitals.
[1:05:26.720 --> 1:05:29.720]  And oh, it'll just be a month of masks. Oh, two months, three months, six months.
[1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:35.720]  And the governor of Texas and all the other governors said, oh, into December.
[1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:38.720]  And you know in December, it'll be the peak of the flu in the pneumonia.
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:46.720]  It'll be thousands of deaths a day. They'll call them all COVID and say, oh, it's now extended into the spring.
[1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:53.720]  It's never going to stop. It's never going to end.
[1:05:53.720 --> 1:05:57.720]  Let's go to Scott in Texas. Scott, you're on here. Go ahead.
[1:05:57.720 --> 1:05:59.720]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:05:59.720 --> 1:06:03.720]  I'm just watching the world government take over. We're down in the middle of it.
[1:06:03.720 --> 1:06:06.720]  It's crazy watching the world go to hell.
[1:06:06.720 --> 1:06:16.720]  Just wanted to let everyone know that hashtag exposed Bill Gates is doing something on all platforms every second Saturday of each month.
[1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:21.720]  So, I mean, more people are waking up, but it's just, I don't know how we can get to these masses.
[1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:26.720]  That's who we need to wake up.
[1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:32.720]  Well, Bill Gates has gone on all these big TV shows on establishment media that he pays for.
[1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:34.720]  By the way, he underwrites them to have him on.
[1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:37.720]  People ask how he's the doctor running everybody's lives.
[1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:46.720]  And he says on those shows over and over again, why the top hashtags are that I'm bad and the top search, no matter what we do.
[1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:50.720]  And because it's a sick joke, he needs to be demonized. He needs to be exposed.
[1:06:50.720 --> 1:06:59.720]  He's a guy who literally owns and controls all these big companies set to make trillions who says he wants to sterilize us and depopulate us saying we're going to stay locked down.
[1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:02.720]  And we're going to have to live in our houses and starve to death.
[1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:04.720]  We're not essential as he kills the third world.
[1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:08.720]  He's a damn monster. He's the living Stalin wrapped inside Hitler.
[1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:13.720]  He's a true Duncan and he's got to be exposed.
[1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:16.720]  It's so extreme that no one can believe it.
[1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:23.720]  But he says it constantly. He says it. It drives me crazy trying to tell friends and family.
[1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:27.720]  They just cannot believe it by show videos and they're just in denial.
[1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:33.720]  It's everything there and just strict denial. It's unbelievable. The lie he told.
[1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:37.720]  Well, brother, it's just an incredible time to be alive.
[1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:40.720]  You know, we can put up pictures of Bill Gates with red eyes all day long. Thanks for the call.
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:48.720]  We can put up images of him with red eyes all day long, but that's not that's that makes it kind of Halloweeny and fun.
[1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:51.720]  It's deadly, deadly, deadly serious.
[1:07:51.720 --> 1:07:53.720]  Let me show you a real picture of Bill Gates.
[1:07:53.720 --> 1:08:00.720]  Meet the world's most powerful doctor, Bill Gates, smug sitting back staring at you with those predator eyes,
[1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:07.720]  building a total scientific computer grid based on tracking everywhere you go, everywhere you do, robots delivering your food, cooking your food,
[1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:14.720]  driverless cars making you obsolete, non-essential. They're telling you in your face.
[1:08:14.720 --> 1:08:20.720]  Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda said many times.
[1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:27.720]  If you try to hide a truth, people will figure it out because they like riddles and they'll say no because you tried to hide it.
[1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:34.720]  You got to put it out in plain view, but then sugarcoated claiming it's for the greater good and then everyone wants to be good.
[1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:39.720]  And so they'll go along with it. So the Mayans said, there's going to be a full moon.
[1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:43.720]  We got to sacrifice five children and mothers felt good bringing their baby up.
[1:08:43.720 --> 1:08:48.720]  They would help prepare them and help, you know, have their heart chopped out.
[1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:50.720]  And the other cultures would bring their little boy up.
[1:08:50.720 --> 1:08:53.720]  The Druids, five-year-old boy, you know, for the goddess or whatever.
[1:08:53.720 --> 1:09:00.720]  And they'd bind their hands, slit their throat and kick them into the peat bog.
[1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:08.720]  And they find all over Europe, thousands of children mummified in the peat with their little throat slit.
[1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:12.720]  And the mommy comes up and says, I love you to a five-year-old. I'm a good moral person.
[1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:15.720]  I'm a virtue signaler. He goes, thank you, mommy.
[1:09:15.720 --> 1:09:20.720]  I'm glad that we're going to have a good harvest because I gave my life to the goddess.
[1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:28.720]  And then they set them down. The priest walks up and slits that throat because really he works for a dark force that wants that energy.
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:31.720]  And that's who these people are. They're going to give their children inoculations.
[1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:35.720]  They're going to go mute. They're going to have convulsions. They're going to die in many cases.
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:43.720]  The mothers will love it because they're followers.
[1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:47.720]  Yep, there's an example of someone found bound in peat.
[1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:52.720]  That guy, that's a National Geographic. That was a nobleman.
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:10:00.720]  I've never seen that picture. And that was a rare sacrifice that actually would demand the leaders be killed on special occasions.
[1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:05.720]  And then the peat would mummify their skin. That's why they're so interesting looking.
[1:10:05.720 --> 1:10:12.720]  But that's how this operates. And again, if they start saying human sacrifice is good.
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:19.720]  In fact, let me give you a human sacrifice clip. We'll go to break them back with calls to Walt and Wendy and Cameron, Jason and Jerome and Beefy.
[1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:25.720]  In fact, Beefy's up next. Let me play Chuck E. Schumer. Remember, he got mad once, actually turned red.
[1:10:25.720 --> 1:10:31.720]  He never gets mad. We talked about if you get rid of abortion, we will destroy you, Trump. You will be annihilated because that's his blood.
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:36.720]  That's his, to his, his God Satan. He needs that blood. He needs that death. He needs that power.
[1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:45.720]  And as a Satanist, what Chuck E. Schumer is, he runs a large part of the operation of New York, brought in Wiener, brought in the Clintons, you know, all of it up in New York.
[1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:55.720]  He's definitely a dark, a dark magician, as they call him. He came out and he said generations of children.
[1:10:55.720 --> 1:11:03.720]  Unborn will suffer if Amy Cody Barrett is confirmed.
[1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:08.720]  Before she was confirmed and then sworn in on the White House steps last night. Now, let me say that again.
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:24.720]  This is pure Satanism. The ultimate inversion. Generations of children will suffer if we don't suck their brains out or spray salts on them and burn their skin off, or if we don't chop them up and suck them out with a vacuum cleaner.
[1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:32.720]  So babies will suffer if we don't dismember them or keep them alive and sell them for baby parts.
[1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:40.720]  Keep them comfortable, though, not only keep them comfortable, baby, comfortable, the skin.
[1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:49.720]  So this is a true demon. Here he is talking about you got to kill the babies to stop their suffering. Here it is.
[1:11:49.720 --> 1:12:07.720]  Then they think. Here, at this late hour, at the end of this sordid chapter in the history of the Senate, the history of the Supreme Court, my deepest and greatest sadness is for the American people.
[1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:13.720]  Generations yet unborn will suffer the consequences of this nomination.
[1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:30.720]  As the globe gets warmer, as workers continue to fall behind, as unlimited dark money floods our politics, as reactionary state legislatures curtail a woman's right to choose gerrymandered districts and limit the rights of minorities to vote,
[1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:46.720]  my deepest, greatest, and most abiding sadness tonight is for the American people. Oh, you love us so much. What this nomination will mean for their lives, dirty, hunchback, parasite, burn in hell.
[1:12:46.720 --> 1:13:02.720]  Burn in hell, maggot, burn in hell, maggot, burn in hell, maggot. In January and February of the year 2020, the communist superstate China, working through the United Nations, told the world how we are now supposed to live our lives after COVID.
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:14.720]  Permanent social distancing, permanent mask, apps that track everywhere we go, and what we do, contact tracers come into our doors with the police and dragging us away.
[1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:22.720]  This is the authoritarian medical tyranny takeover, and it's never going to end until we start standing up and saying no.
[1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:30.720]  Already Fauci and the WHO and the communist Chinese are all over the news saying the lockdowns are permanent.
[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:35.720]  Bill Gates said at least 10 years last week until restrictions are raised.
[1:13:35.720 --> 1:13:49.720]  By then we'll all be totally and completely trained to live under slavery, and it will never end. This is the authoritarian takeover. Everyone must resist, everyone must speak up, everyone must say no now.
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:23.720]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:43.720]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:53.720]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:25.720]  I'm going to say it again.
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:40.720]  The reason Infowars is so important, it's a lot bigger than yours truly Alex Jones. It is about the talk show host and the callers and the intel and the no filter and the fact that we can't be bought, we can't be controlled.
[1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:49.720]  And as the censorship accelerates, there's fewer and fewer groups that have any speech, including the president, being blocked. This is a takeover.
[1:15:49.720 --> 1:16:05.720]  That's why having our own audio and video streams, having our own platform, our own crew, our own editors, our own investigative journalists, our own legal teams, our own satellite uplinks for TV and radio, our own internet security, all of this costs millions of dollars a month.
[1:16:05.720 --> 1:16:24.720]  You ever read about little local newspaper in a mid-sized town, cost 10 million to run a year? That doesn't even reach, but maybe 100,000 people. Folks, we reach millions every day, and it cost a good 25, 30 million dollars a year to run this operation.
[1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:38.720]  Now think about that. If I've got to sell product, if I sold 40 million dollars worth of product, then that gets me enough money to fund this operation.
[1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:46.720]  And so that's why you buying the product is so important. And the enemy has worked so hard to shut us down, they're so angry they haven't been able to do it.
[1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:56.720]  Go get a t-shirt. Go get a historic t-shirt. We've got a funny one that's the Biden groping a woman. It's a woman's design shirt. My wife really likes it.
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:17:06.720]  You know, I'd actually ask graphics to do an ad with it because it's funny, but I don't think that's going to happen. But you know what I can do, though? I can actually have a victory here right on here.
[1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:17.720]  I can just pull up my wife's photo. She sent me a photo. She sent me a photo of it, and it's pretty cute. So I thought I'd do that.
[1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:30.720]  But yeah, she sent me this. She sent me this gift. Here it is. Overhead shot please. Yeah, I asked a couple times. Not a big deal, but I noticed I do it on air sometimes I get it.
[1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:42.720]  To turn that into an ad. There's also a photo of it. It's pretty funny. And it's a little historic thing. I think Trump's going to win, but if Biden's able to steal it, we'll be probably shut down pretty quick.
[1:17:42.720 --> 1:17:59.720]  So it'll be a historic thing to have. You'll only be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti, with handbills you hand out, and with non-compliance, not paying taxes, and pulling your kids out of the schools, and just making it a full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal far and takeover of America.
[1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:09.720]  We've gotten to that point. Biden for nursing home. I hope to retire Biden. That'd be a collector's item. Get it while you still can. We're not ordering more.
[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:24.720]  And separately, Friday and October only has four days left. Four days left. Four days left, ladies and gentlemen. And then that's it.
[1:18:24.720 --> 1:18:32.720]  And it is the biggest sales. We might have a sale this good around Christmas, but here's what happened. The supply chain's broke now, and I told you a lot of stuff's not coming back in.
[1:18:32.720 --> 1:18:41.720]  A lot of items have had to discontinue. So everything we say we have, we have in stock, ready to ship to you out the door within a day at m4store.com.
[1:18:41.720 --> 1:18:49.720]  But Rain Force Plus is the last run of that. We're going to reformulate it and make it even better. But people love it. Last run of that. Discounted free shipping.
[1:18:49.720 --> 1:18:58.720]  Ultra 12. So good if you're immune system. 50% off. Free shipping. Triple Patriot points. Vitamineral fusion. Free shipping. 25% off because it's about to sell out.
[1:18:58.720 --> 1:19:06.720]  We want 25% off. It's got the vitamins, the minerals, the zinc for adults and children. All T-shirts, 1776. All SRL products. Those are one of a kind.
[1:19:06.720 --> 1:19:14.720]  60% off free shipping. SRL products. New nascent iodine spray for surfaces over the top strong. 50% off free shipping.
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:21.720]  And more at m4store.com. Okay, I'm going to go to your calls now. I need to plug here. We won't be on air though.
[1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:28.720]  I'm just saying now is the time to get in the game. Now is the time to spread the word. Now is the time to share the URLs.
[1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:32.720]  I'll tell you about a new URL when we start the next segment.
[1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:38.720]  Because they're blocking 2020ElectionCenter.com. That was the URL that would get out banned out video.
[1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:46.720]  But now Twitter's blocked that to election metal. They've now blocked 2020ElectionCenter.com. And notice, we've gotten punch drunk here at InfoWars.
[1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:56.720]  Myself included. We can attack so much now that when we get attacked, it's just taken for granted. We won't even have an article out about how 2020ElectionCenter.com got blocked.
[1:19:56.720 --> 1:20:07.720]  Totally violating what Jack said when he said we will not block URLs. That's wrong. Just last week and how that ties into him blocking the president and blocking Republicans and blocking the House and Senate committees that were exposing it.
[1:20:07.720 --> 1:20:13.720]  See, you have to not adapt to being censored and get to where it's no big deal.
[1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:26.720]  Hell, I bet if I was, say, on Joe Rogan next week, no one here would even care. Because we're so long in the zeitgeist, so long in the fulcrum, so long at the front lines of the fight, that it's all taken for granted.
[1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:36.720]  The crew works hard. I work hard, but we still kind of take it for granted that there's nothing else like this out there and they're so close to shutting it down.
[1:20:36.720 --> 1:20:45.720]  They're so close to shutting the country down permanently against you and your family. You let them do that? It takes energy. It takes focus. It takes stamina. And it takes will.
[1:20:45.720 --> 1:20:56.720]  And if you just simply do it, we will win. If not, it's over. Do you have a memory from one task to the next? Can you remember the last thing you were supposed to do?
[1:20:56.720 --> 1:21:06.720]  Or are we all so habituated by the TVs and the smart phones destroying our attention spans that we don't even understand what's happening to us?
[1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:10.720]  Tamara in Ohio, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:21:10.720 --> 1:21:15.720]  Hi, Alex. I'll keep it quick and short because I know you have a.
[1:21:15.720 --> 1:21:24.720]  But basically at my job and I bartend, you know, they make us wear the mask, but I'm grateful because it's more of a conservative restaurant.
[1:21:24.720 --> 1:21:30.720]  Most of the people that come in are Trump supporters and the county I live in, you know, it's all red.
[1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:40.720]  But then, you know, you flip it and the health department can still come in and find us and potentially shut down our business.
[1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:53.720]  And so how like, what do you think the best way to go about trying to get people to stop wearing these masks and stop being so afraid and also just complaining to
[1:21:53.720 --> 1:22:03.720]  us, the waitresses, the owners, you know, coming into the restaurant, not or wearing a mask and taking it off and are, you know, our restaurants pretty much full.
[1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:08.720]  And they have a problem with they don't have a problem with that.
[1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:14.720]  But as soon as we pull our masks down and touch our faces and serve them food, you know, it's a problem.
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:25.720]  So well, that's the psychological war chiefs created this as a way to get petty nobodies and all these neurotic, hateful, envious, jealous, lazy people want an excuse to impact somebody.
[1:22:25.720 --> 1:22:27.720]  So it's a class thing.
[1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:29.720]  They get to take their mask off.
[1:22:29.720 --> 1:22:31.720]  You don't get to take yours off.
[1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:41.720]  And again, it's all been psychologically algorithmed at Harvard at Yale at Princeton at Stanford at Oxford and at Cambridge.
[1:22:41.720 --> 1:22:44.720]  You can pull up every one of the articles.
[1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:47.720]  And so again, it's all just moronic idiocy.
[1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:55.720]  Like, like when I've sat there in restaurants and watch women in Austin in full burkas, pull forward their burka and eat spaghetti under it.
[1:22:55.720 --> 1:22:57.720]  Okay, because they're a cult.
[1:22:57.720 --> 1:23:01.720]  And now we're in the damn cult because we're compliant, soft idiots.
[1:23:01.720 --> 1:23:04.720]  And so I'm so sad to hear that happen to you.
[1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:06.720]  And you know, I'm just sick of it.
[1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:07.720]  And you know, I don't need to complain.
[1:23:07.720 --> 1:23:08.720]  I really don't.
[1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:11.720]  So you need to be, you need to not complain.
[1:23:11.720 --> 1:23:12.720]  You're not complaining.
[1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:13.720]  You're reporting it.
[1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:14.720]  You're exposing it.
[1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:15.720]  And you need to say no to it.
[1:23:15.720 --> 1:23:16.720]  And we need rest.
[1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:17.720]  Listen, here's the deal.
[1:23:17.720 --> 1:23:18.720]  The most important thing all day.
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:20.720]  You just said it.
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:21.720]  Stay there.
[1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:22.720]  I'm going to come back to you.
[1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:23.720]  Please don't hang up.
[1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:24.720]  Tamer at it.
[1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:26.720]  And when I get mad and angry, I got plenty of time for everybody.
[1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:29.720]  I'm just pissed off about how obvious all this is.
[1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:35.720]  We want to hear everything you have to say and more everybody next segment.
[1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:38.720]  We've had federal and state courts rule the mask.
[1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:41.720]  The social distancing is all illegal and constitutional,
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:44.720]  but it continues to happen because we enforce it on ourselves.
[1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:46.720]  We build our own damn presence.
[1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:50.720]  So it's time for all of us to break out of the walls in our minds.
[1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:51.720]  I want us to sink in.
[1:23:51.720 --> 1:23:53.720]  I want to sink in real good.
[1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:56.720]  And to everybody listening, including my own brain,
[1:23:56.720 --> 1:23:59.720]  this lockdown is incredibly sinister and has already started
[1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:01.720]  over 2 million people to death.
[1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:04.720]  It is designed to incrementally be slowly tightened down around our necks.
[1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:08.720]  They are never going to release it.
[1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:10.720]  That's why Trump coming out and saying,
[1:24:10.720 --> 1:24:13.720]  we cannot, quote, beat the virus by staying locked up.
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:15.720]  We have to get herd immunity.
[1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:17.720]  It's not as deadly as they said it's so important.
[1:24:17.720 --> 1:24:19.720]  Because this is a UN, Bill Gates,
[1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:21.720]  globalist deployed corporate takeover.
[1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:24.720]  Where there are businesses are all essential,
[1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:26.720]  but our businesses aren't.
[1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:29.720]  This is destroying the world economy by design.
[1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:31.720]  This is economic warfare.
[1:24:31.720 --> 1:24:33.720]  This is war crime.
[1:24:33.720 --> 1:24:35.720]  And now they're coming with the attempted force.
[1:24:35.720 --> 1:24:37.720]  The modulation is the Gates pushing.
[1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:38.720]  Well, you know what that is.
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:41.720]  That violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code,
[1:24:41.720 --> 1:24:43.720]  and so much more.
[1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:44.720]  Please spread the words.
[1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:47.720]  Please tell folks about Band-Aught Video
[1:24:47.720 --> 1:25:14.720]  and the facts that are posted there.
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:22.720]  Until every coronavirus in the world is eradicated,
[1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:23.720]  that's impossible.
[1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:24.720]  That's right.
[1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:27.720]  They're trying to say they have to have a cure to the common cold.
[1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:31.720]  That's what COVID-19 falls positives for on the test.
[1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:34.720]  They created a problem that can never be defeated,
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:36.720]  but of course they're the ones in charge of the problem.
[1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:40.720]  And so they stay in power forever and take control of society
[1:25:40.720 --> 1:25:42.720]  with contact tracers.
[1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:45.720]  Now going with the police to people's doors in Texas
[1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:48.720]  to get a gun point and taking four samples.
[1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:49.720]  We must say no.
[1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:54.720]  Introducing InfoWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:56.720]  This is taken under the tongue.
[1:25:56.720 --> 1:25:58.720]  It is pure turmeric.
[1:25:58.720 --> 1:26:03.720]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:05.720]  that is taken as a powdered capsule
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:08.720]  and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:11.720]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:14.720]  and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:16.720]  This is an intense delivery system.
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:19.720]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrated
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:21.720]  and our first product got rave reviews.
[1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:23.720]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:25.720]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[1:26:25.720 --> 1:26:27.720]  Some like bodies better.
[1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:30.720]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action
[1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:32.720]  and so much more, and they fund the InfoWars.
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:35.720]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively.

[1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:46.720]  for inflammation and so much more.
[1:26:46.720 --> 1:27:15.720]  Get yours today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:16.720]  All right, folks.
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:21.720]  The walls are collapsing in on the globalist.
[1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:24.720]  I have massive election fraud news,
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:29.720]  Hunter Biden audio, admitting corruption, admitting payoffs.
[1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:33.720]  I have Project Veritas news.
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:35.720]  This is just like absolutely insane
[1:27:35.720 --> 1:27:38.720]  how much stuff is coming out and how fast right now.
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:40.720]  So that's all coming up.
[1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:44.720]  Next segment, we're going to back your calls right now.
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:46.720]  I know that a lot of you have been promoting
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:48.720]  2020electioncenter.com.
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:52.720]  That is the URL for Band.video of the exact same videos,
[1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:55.720]  the exact same URLs, but when Twitter banned Band.video
[1:27:55.720 --> 1:28:00.720]  a few months ago for being able to promote the URL,
[1:28:00.720 --> 1:28:02.720]  it got around that.
[1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:04.720]  And so the URL exploded.
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:06.720]  We were getting millions of new viewers a day
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:08.720]  because of you taking action.
[1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:10.720]  The truth was getting out.
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:12.720]  Well, we have a new URL they have at Band.
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:14.720]  They banned this in an hour.
[1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:15.720]  We got a new one for you.
[1:28:15.720 --> 1:28:16.720]  We're going to just keep fighting.
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:17.720]  We never give up.
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:18.720]  You don't give up.
[1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:19.720]  Election night.news.
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:21.720]  So let's start showing that for folks.
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:24.720]  Election night.news.
[1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:27.720]  I like the one that has a little red flash and light, too.
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:28.720]  That looks really good.
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:30.720]  But let's promote that on all the shows.
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:32.720]  I hope the listeners will promote it.
[1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:35.720]  Election night.news, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:28:35.720 --> 1:28:37.720]  And that takes you right to Band.video
[1:28:37.720 --> 1:28:39.720]  and all the live coverage and all the shows
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:41.720]  and everything else that Big Tech is fighting so hard.
[1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:44.720]  It's fighting so hard to make sure that nobody's able to get.
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:46.720]  All right.
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:48.720]  Temera.
[1:28:48.720 --> 1:28:49.720]  Is it Temera or Tamera?
[1:28:49.720 --> 1:28:51.720]  How do you pronounce your name?
[1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:52.720]  It's Tamera.
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:53.720]  Oh, Tamera.
[1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:54.720]  Okay, sorry.
[1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:55.720]  I'm brand new today.
[1:28:55.720 --> 1:28:56.720]  No, that's okay.
[1:28:56.720 --> 1:28:57.720]  I had a rough day yesterday and a rough day today.
[1:28:57.720 --> 1:28:58.720]  Sorry.
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:00.720]  So finishing up your point about,
[1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:04.720]  they're trying to make sure you wear your mask perfectly
[1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:06.720]  because, oh, you're a service person,
[1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:08.720]  but then the royals that come to the restaurants,
[1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:09.720]  they don't have to.
[1:29:09.720 --> 1:29:11.720]  Again, this has all been psychologically war-gamed.
[1:29:11.720 --> 1:29:13.720]  How do you think this should be stood up against?
[1:29:13.720 --> 1:29:15.720]  Because I was just pointing out that federal courts
[1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:18.720]  and Supreme Courts have ruled this is all unconstitutional.
[1:29:18.720 --> 1:29:22.720]  But again, it's the restaurants themselves all enforcing this.
[1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:24.720]  We need restaurants to stop enforcing it
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:27.720]  and make you sign a form waving any liability when you come in.
[1:29:27.720 --> 1:29:28.720]  And then it's over.
[1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:29.720]  But see, it's lawyers.
[1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:33.720]  It's just like lawyers banned diving boards and jungle gyms.
[1:29:33.720 --> 1:29:35.720]  They're not going to ban going on in public
[1:29:35.720 --> 1:29:36.720]  because you can catch a cold.
[1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:39.720]  Don't you see their seizing control of society through hysteria
[1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:40.720]  and chicken little fear?
[1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:41.720]  Sorry.
[1:29:41.720 --> 1:29:42.720]  Exactly.
[1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:44.720]  And that's, you know, I'm grateful because my boss, you know,
[1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:47.720]  he really, I mean, he puts up with it as much as he has to,
[1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:49.720]  you know, because he's trying to make money.
[1:29:49.720 --> 1:29:51.720]  Like, you know, that's his livelihood.
[1:29:51.720 --> 1:29:54.720]  But so, you know, everyone's kind of compromising
[1:29:54.720 --> 1:29:57.720]  in different areas where this is concerned.
[1:29:57.720 --> 1:30:01.720]  And, you know, and it's ridiculous when I go up to a department
[1:30:01.720 --> 1:30:04.720]  store where there's three people and a woman comes up to me
[1:30:04.720 --> 1:30:07.720]  and points her finger and says, you need to put on a mask.
[1:30:07.720 --> 1:30:08.720]  Are you serious?
[1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:11.720]  People are making a lot of assumptions about my health
[1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:13.720]  and my mental state.
[1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:18.720]  And, you know, I would assume that if you are too sick to go out
[1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:22.720]  or you're really that scared, you're just not going to go out.
[1:30:22.720 --> 1:30:24.720]  The rest of us can't put our lives on hold.
[1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:25.720]  I have money to make.
[1:30:25.720 --> 1:30:26.720]  My boss has money to make.
[1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:29.720]  All the people I work with have money to make.
[1:30:29.720 --> 1:30:32.720]  And there's obviously people who want to go out to eat,
[1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:34.720]  because like I said, pretty much every weekend,
[1:30:34.720 --> 1:30:37.720]  our restaurant is every table is full.
[1:30:37.720 --> 1:30:39.720]  Every table is full.
[1:30:39.720 --> 1:30:43.720]  So, you know, and maybe in these Democrat run places where,
[1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:47.720]  you know, no one's going out because they literally cannot.
[1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:50.720]  It's a problem, but, you know, in places like Florida
[1:30:50.720 --> 1:30:54.720]  and more southern states and places in Ohio where pretty much
[1:30:54.720 --> 1:30:57.720]  everyone is our Republicans, you know,
[1:30:57.720 --> 1:31:00.720]  the rest of us are just going on about our lives.
[1:31:00.720 --> 1:31:03.720]  Well, that's another thing Republicans can't get tricked
[1:31:03.720 --> 1:31:08.720]  into enforcing when Democrats don't do it, playing their game.
[1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:09.720]  We've got to expose the whole fraud.
[1:31:09.720 --> 1:31:12.720]  They're now rolling out in Japan, China, and the U.S.,
[1:31:12.720 --> 1:31:14.720]  not just drones that surveil you,
[1:31:14.720 --> 1:31:17.720]  but they're also having robots come up and stick a thing up your nose
[1:31:17.720 --> 1:31:19.720]  because, oh, a human can't come up to you.
[1:31:19.720 --> 1:31:20.720]  They might catch COVID.
[1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:21.720]  This is total hysteria.
[1:31:21.720 --> 1:31:22.720]  That's the thing.
[1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:25.720]  People need to stop wearing the mask and stop taking COVID tests
[1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:26.720]  for no reason.
[1:31:26.720 --> 1:31:30.720]  If you have to take it to even know you have it, why even take the test?
[1:31:30.720 --> 1:31:32.720]  If you're asymptomatic all the time,
[1:31:32.720 --> 1:31:36.720]  if we all carry around these different diseases and different viruses
[1:31:36.720 --> 1:31:40.720]  with our immunities to them, then why are we compromising that?
[1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:44.720]  Well, it's big tech telling us that we're not healthy enough to live without them,
[1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:47.720]  and they've got to, it's why all the births are cesarean now.
[1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:49.720]  It's why they tell mothers don't breastfeed.
[1:31:49.720 --> 1:31:51.720]  They're taking us out of our natural environment.
[1:31:51.720 --> 1:31:52.720]  They're domesticating us.
[1:31:52.720 --> 1:31:53.720]  Thank you so much.
[1:31:53.720 --> 1:31:56.720]  All right, let's talk to Walt in New York.
[1:31:56.720 --> 1:31:58.720]  Walt, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:31:58.720 --> 1:32:00.720]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[1:32:00.720 --> 1:32:03.720]  Man, I am just watching the takeover take place.
[1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:06.720]  Alex, I'm going to help you relax your jawbone.
[1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:11.720]  Alex, we have to reach the most people on the most basic level.
[1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:14.720]  Earlier, you mentioned Albert Einstein,
[1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:19.720]  so I'm going to give you the E equals MC squared for this election.
[1:32:19.720 --> 1:32:21.720]  Here it is, the meme.
[1:32:21.720 --> 1:32:25.720]  $2 a gallon regular gas under Trump.
[1:32:25.720 --> 1:32:29.720]  $8 a gallon regular gas under Biden.
[1:32:29.720 --> 1:32:33.720]  How does a $400 Phillips sound?
[1:32:33.720 --> 1:32:37.720]  Well, what's happening is they are turning us into a surf state.
[1:32:37.720 --> 1:32:40.720]  It's how you conquer America is turn our energy off when China and India
[1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:43.720]  and Mexico and 160 other countries make zero cuts.
[1:32:43.720 --> 1:32:46.720]  I mean, this is all outrageous war against us.
[1:32:46.720 --> 1:32:53.720]  We have to spread this meme on billboards, on the rooftops, tell your friends,
[1:32:53.720 --> 1:32:56.720]  this is what's going to reach people, the $2 gas under Trump,
[1:32:56.720 --> 1:32:59.720]  $8 a gallon gas under Biden.
[1:32:59.720 --> 1:33:05.720]  That's what's going to make the decision in this election if you spread the word.
[1:33:05.720 --> 1:33:07.720]  It's a really good idea, sir, and you're absolutely right.
[1:33:07.720 --> 1:33:10.720]  I mean, Biden's saying he will get rid of fossil fuels.
[1:33:10.720 --> 1:33:14.720]  That would cause the total collapse of civilization.
[1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:16.720]  And fracking is necessary.
[1:33:16.720 --> 1:33:20.720]  That's why we have a lot of the gas and fuel and stuff we have is from fracking.
[1:33:20.720 --> 1:33:23.720]  People don't get it. It's from fracking.
[1:33:23.720 --> 1:33:26.720]  We have new ways of developing oil and gas.
[1:33:26.720 --> 1:33:29.720]  These are super deep wells, a lot of them, and they're clean.
[1:33:29.720 --> 1:33:33.720]  Some aren't, and when companies do wrong, they should get in trouble, but here's the deal.
[1:33:33.720 --> 1:33:35.720]  Everybody should be filtering their water anyways.
[1:33:35.720 --> 1:33:42.720]  For folks that don't know, most aquifer water has a bunch of different radioactive isotopes in it.
[1:33:42.720 --> 1:33:45.720]  Okay? And so that's another reason you want to filter your water.
[1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:49.720]  Tap water, well water, everything needs to be filtered, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:33:49.720 --> 1:33:51.720]  that's one of the number one things you can do.
[1:33:51.720 --> 1:33:52.720]  Thank you so much, Walt.
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:53.720]  All right, let's take another call.
[1:33:53.720 --> 1:33:57.720]  Wendy in Pennsylvania, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:33:57.720 --> 1:33:59.720]  Hi, Alex. How are you?
[1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:03.720]  I'm all right. I'm just watching science fiction become reality.
[1:34:03.720 --> 1:34:11.720]  I want to thank you for speaking the truth, even sometimes to your own heart.
[1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:18.720]  It's really been refreshing to me, and sometimes I listen to you just to be refreshed with someone
[1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:20.720]  that is going to speak the truth.
[1:34:20.720 --> 1:34:29.720]  And I have not been involved in politics or Facebook in about eight years.
[1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:32.720]  I've been raising my children by myself.
[1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:38.720]  I have seven, and so I decided that I was going to just, you know, focus on them.
[1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:48.720]  And last December, when I heard about COVID and how it was only, you know,
[1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:54.720]  killing old people, I just, in my spirit, I felt there was an evil about this.
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:35:02.720]  And I had heard about you from a friend in Mexico, and so I started to listen to you
[1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:09.720]  and then I would watch Fox News and I would compare the information.
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:16.720]  And you were always a couple of days ahead of Fox, and Fox still seems to, you know,
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:21.720]  care about, you know, not offending and saying things a certain way.
[1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:26.720]  And I really appreciate how you are just very straightforward.
[1:35:26.720 --> 1:35:32.720]  Anyway, when I started to see all that was going on,
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:35.720]  I decided that I needed to pass the information out.
[1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:41.720]  And so I tested Facebook, and I put Dr. Richard Bartlett,
[1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:52.720]  Ed Edson, I'd inhaled steroid information that you had put on into the ward.
[1:35:52.720 --> 1:35:56.720]  I put that on Facebook and it was answered.
[1:35:56.720 --> 1:36:00.720]  And I was like, wow, this is, you know, this is real.
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:05.720]  Yeah, this is big tech not wanting a major medical doctor that heads up the emergency room
[1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:10.720]  who has treated hundreds of people that had COVID within hours they're cured with a steroid
[1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:12.720]  because it's an autoimmune response.
[1:36:12.720 --> 1:36:16.720]  And again, and now, of course, Trump got treated with the same steroids
[1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:18.720]  and why do you think he was so good?
[1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:22.720]  So exactly, I think of the evil that medical doctors in America,
[1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:26.720]  you can't share a video of a local newscast of a medical doctor in Texas.
[1:36:26.720 --> 1:36:29.720]  That is premeditated organized crime to keep us in fear,
[1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:32.720]  keep the lockdown going, keep us hysterical.
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:35.720]  Just like they don't want you to know about vitamin C, vitamin D.
[1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:38.720]  Or think, God bless you, Wendy, keep spreading the word.
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:41.720]  That's how we circumvent them, keep fighting hard, six days from election.
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:49.720]  All right, we're going to come right back with Joe and others in these big revelations.
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:51.720]  China is open.
[1:36:51.720 --> 1:36:53.720]  America is closed.
[1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:58.720]  And in the European Union, where the people are revolting trying to get out of the authoritarian tyranny,
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:01.720]  they're also under even greater levels of lockdown.
[1:37:01.720 --> 1:37:02.720]  It's very simple.
[1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:06.720]  Where authoritarians are, you have complete control of Communist China.
[1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:11.720]  Oh, there's no more lockdowns and they're heroes and the UN says they're the example for assault.
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:13.720]  After all, that's where the virus came from.
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:16.720]  After all, that's where the fear monster came from.
[1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:21.720]  The lockdown came from, but that was a weapon, a psychological hysteria,
[1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:30.720]  a chicken little syndrome being created that was to be aimed at us and used to invoke our fear
[1:37:30.720 --> 1:37:33.720]  and have us go into a stampede of mass hysteria.
[1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:37.720]  And so far, it's been incredibly successful.
[1:37:37.720 --> 1:37:42.720]  Until just the last few weeks, as across the world, humanity awakens in the fact that COVID-19
[1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:48.720]  is a giant UN Communist Chinese world government power graph.
[1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:53.720]  As I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out from the election.
[1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:58.720]  And the globalist-controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to them and turned against them.
[1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:01.720]  The whole planet is in a huge populace for alignment.
[1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:06.720]  And so they've openly said, we need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship,
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:11.720]  but physically attacking and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda.
[1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:17.720]  And they're on record saying that once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's base
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:20.720]  and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison.
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:23.720]  This is what all the old Clintonistas are saying.
[1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:25.720]  It's what the Obama bots are saying.
[1:38:25.720 --> 1:38:27.720]  It's what Keith Overman's saying.
[1:38:27.720 --> 1:38:29.720]  It's what Nancy Pelosi's saying.
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:33.720]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent.
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:37.720]  And they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and force denoculations.
[1:38:37.720 --> 1:38:41.720]  Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and is saying vaccines will be voluntary.
[1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:43.720]  Donald Trump or die.
[1:38:43.720 --> 1:38:46.720]  We've got to get Trump in. Everybody get out there and vote.
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:48.720]  Tell your family to vote now.
[1:38:49.720 --> 1:38:51.720]  I admire President Trump.
[1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:54.720]  He's really proven himself to be unmatched.
[1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:57.720]  His wit, his focus, his commitment, his energy.
[1:38:57.720 --> 1:39:00.720]  And I just want to affirm my admiration for President Trump.
[1:39:00.720 --> 1:39:04.720]  He's not God. He's not an angel. He's not perfect.
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:11.720]  But the way he has used judo on the forces of the New World Order has been really incredible.
[1:39:11.720 --> 1:39:16.720]  The way he's pragmatically stood up for prosperity and basic freedom.
[1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:23.720]  And the way he stood up against these America-hating, God-hating, family-hating trash is beautiful.
[1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:28.720]  And I'm serious. I was just bringing tears to my eyes. Driving to work this morning thinking about President Trump.
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:31.720]  I just want to say I admire the President so much.
[1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:35.720]  And I appreciate you, the listeners, and everybody for what you've done.
[1:39:35.720 --> 1:39:38.720]  I admire you. That's what you call it, thank me.
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:40.720]  Folks, I admire you. I admire Trump.
[1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:43.720]  I admire all of you that are involved in this fight.
[1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:45.720]  And I just wish I could do more.
[1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:47.720]  We're going to win this fight together. This election is so important.
[1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:54.720]  Please pray for President Trump.
[1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:19.720]  I suggest Band.Video.
[1:40:19.720 --> 1:40:24.720]  You will now have Band.Video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:26.720]  The globalists think you're lazy.
[1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:33.720]  But by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:37.720]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below.
[1:40:37.720 --> 1:40:48.720]  On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure to share Band.Video.
[1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:23.720]  We're six days out from the election, and the dam is breaking of all the different corrupt intel.
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:27.720]  On Hunter Biden, a big national pulse article exclusive.
[1:41:27.720 --> 1:41:38.720]  Hunter Biden audio confesses partnership with China's spy chief Joe Biden named as criminal case witness in the southern district of New York.
[1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:45.720]  An audio recording exclusively obtained by the national pulse reveals Hunter Biden discussing business involvement with a spy chief of China.
[1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:54.720]  And how his business partner Devon Archer named him and his father as a witness in a southern district of New York criminal case.
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:41:58.720]  It's got to be clear now that Biden is not viable.
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:05.720]  And even if they try to steal the election and try to say that Trump lost, the system has to stand out and have Trump in.
[1:42:05.720 --> 1:42:09.720]  Because he's going to win and we're going to beat them.
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:12.720]  And there's dirt a lot worse than this ready to come out.
[1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:17.720]  If this scumbag family that sold us out to China doesn't step aside.
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:22.720]  Move, bitch. Get out the way. Get out the way, bitch. Get out the way.
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:25.720]  Get out the way.
[1:42:25.720 --> 1:42:27.720]  Let's go ahead and play some of that audio.
[1:42:27.720 --> 1:42:31.720]  Full audio is on infoworks.com. Here it is.
[1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:36.720]  I get calls from my father to tell me that the New York Times is calling.
[1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:47.720]  But my old partner Eric, who literally has done me harm for, I don't know how long is the one taking the calls because my father will not stop sending the calls to Eric.
[1:42:47.720 --> 1:43:00.720]  Another New York Times reporter calling about my representation of the, literally, Dr. Patrick Coe, the spy chief of China,
[1:43:00.720 --> 1:43:09.720]  who started the company that my partner, who was worth $323 billion, found it.
[1:43:09.720 --> 1:43:16.720]  It is now missing. The richest man in the world is missing. Who was my partner?
[1:43:16.720 --> 1:43:29.720]  He was missing since I last saw him in his $58 million apartment and signed a $4 billion deal to build the largest LNG port in the world.
[1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:36.720]  And I am receiving calls from the Southern District of New York, from the U.S. Attorney himself.
[1:43:36.720 --> 1:43:49.720]  My best friend in business, Devin, has named me as a witness without telling me. In a criminal case, and my father without telling me.
[1:43:49.720 --> 1:43:55.720]  I get calls from my father to tell me that the New York Times...
[1:43:55.720 --> 1:44:03.720]  So there you go. Yes, it's being called the smoking gun across the Internet. It's been confirmed. Hunter Biden's not denying it.
[1:44:03.720 --> 1:44:09.720]  It's Hunter Biden talking about how he's working under the chief of Communist China's spy system.
[1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:14.720]  So the Hunter Biden smoking gun released.
[1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:23.720]  Biden's smoking gun released. Hunter worked directly under head of Chinese Communist spy system.
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:35.720]  There it is. Smoking gun. Hunter Biden admits that he worked under head of Chinese spy system. That's who they are, folks.
[1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:47.720]  We're sold out to China. What do you think Biden's saying, Joe Biden, when he says we're going to kill all natural gas, all fossil fuels, all fracking, all oil?
[1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:56.720]  Well, no one can do business here. We'll be even worse off. You militarily blow up somebody's energy supply.
[1:44:56.720 --> 1:45:02.720]  Well, how do you do it? You regulate it and dumb leftists that are brought up to hate their country and to be morons, and I don't know how things work.
[1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:09.720]  Who fetishize hating their country? They get on board. These people are a damn plague.
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:22.720]  James O'Keefe's got two bombshell videos breaking Texas Republican consultant and ballot chaser illegally pressures voter to change vote to dim candidate with gift Republicans.
[1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:29.720]  Republicans like this who needs Democrats. If I go to prison, I do not look cute in stripes. I will hate you forever.
[1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:39.720]  You know, on here you choose representative not dim, right? You know, on here you chose Republican not dim, right? You told him to change it.
[1:45:39.720 --> 1:45:46.720]  This is what James O'Keefe is catching in San Antonio. The fix is in. Here it is.
[1:45:46.720 --> 1:45:52.720]  We have Raquel on tape coercing voters to vote the right way as well as bribing these voters with gifts.
[1:45:52.720 --> 1:46:02.720]  Now, you know, on here you chose a Republican not a Democrat, right? You can do, you can go to whatever you want.
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:10.720]  But our conversation that we have, you said you were voting for a hanker because you were going straight Democrat. So now we're voting for the straight Democrat.
[1:46:10.720 --> 1:46:15.720]  Is that what you want to do, correct?
[1:46:15.720 --> 1:46:29.720]  You're going to, you're going to dot that in and the line goes like this and then your initials are going to put right there.
[1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:32.720]  So that way they know it was done accidental.
[1:46:32.720 --> 1:46:40.720]  She didn't vote for who wanted her to vote. That right there is against the law for me to tell her like you realize you voted for her.
[1:46:40.720 --> 1:46:42.720]  You're not supposed to say nothing.
[1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:48.720]  Look at the show. Look at my show. Oh, that's good.
[1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:56.720]  And she's just saying, man, motto sent you this badass show. You know what? I couldn't vote for him, but you're in this area, you vote for him.
[1:46:56.720 --> 1:47:00.720]  This is what you call flipping people.
[1:47:00.720 --> 1:47:05.720]  What I do in picking up the balance when he was with me, that's illegal. I can go to jail.
[1:47:05.720 --> 1:47:15.720]  I'm a little apprehensive to tell somebody, you know what I'm doing, you know what I'm saying. And again, once he works with me once, he's going to say she's...
[1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:21.720]  I guess Trump was right. I'm sorry.
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:22.720]  About doing something illegal?
[1:47:22.720 --> 1:47:23.720]  I'm sorry?
[1:47:23.720 --> 1:47:24.720]  About doing something illegal?
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:28.720]  Yeah. They all said he was full of shit.
[1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:33.720]  Oh hell no, he's not. It's true, because you're not supposed to do that.
[1:47:33.720 --> 1:47:38.720]  If I have a bunch of them, I'll take 20 here, 30 here, 40 here.
[1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:40.720]  That makes it about the same post office.
[1:47:40.720 --> 1:47:41.720]  Of course not.
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:44.720]  So because I told him about the paper, so I'm going to take a picture of her.
[1:47:44.720 --> 1:47:47.720]  Take a picture of the ballot when it says them two on there.
[1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:51.720]  Take a picture of you in the background so they know that you're freaking there.
[1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:54.720]  Take a picture of us all together, and then I'm going to send it to you.
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:48:01.720]  And you do not let anybody else know this is what I'm doing, because if I'm in a prison, I do not look cute in stripes.
[1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:03.720]  And I will hate you forever.
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:09.720]  We have Raquel on tape coercing voters to vote the right way, as well as bribing these voters.
[1:48:09.720 --> 1:48:18.720]  Okay, so who trained her to do all that? All of this is a Republican flipping voters to be Democrat,
[1:48:18.720 --> 1:48:24.720]  and then giving them a dress as a present to old senile people.
[1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:25.720]  And this is who we're run by, folks.
[1:48:25.720 --> 1:48:30.720]  We're run by people that didn't fight for the country, don't even know what it stands for,
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:32.720]  who just take money.
[1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:37.720]  And they're willing to commit crimes en masse, and that's what they're doing, to try to get Joe Biden in.
[1:48:37.720 --> 1:48:40.720]  I mean, he can't get crowds, no one's there, everybody hates him.
[1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:41.720]  Let's play some more audio.
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:47.720]  There's a bunch of this the Gateway Pundit got of the election official over a major precinct in Detroit,
[1:48:47.720 --> 1:48:53.720]  explaining how to lie to people, how to not follow the state law, to allow poll watching,
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:57.720]  how to kick people out using the COVID restrictions.
[1:48:57.720 --> 1:49:02.720]  Oh, yeah, COVID lock, can you kill the old folks, the nursing homes, you can steal the elections,
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:06.720]  it's all the perfect, selectively enforced thing, and folks love it.
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:10.720]  So this is how America is being conquered by China and multinational corporations.
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:12.720]  It's through the fear, through the hysteria.
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:17.720]  I talked to so many men, prominent men, they go, Alex, it's too complex, it couldn't be happening,
[1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:21.720]  because they're not criminals, they project that onto the rest of the world.
[1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:25.720]  No, you're not criminals, you're chumps.
[1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:29.720]  But here's the thing, there's a lot of us know what's going on, and this huge audience of activists know,
[1:49:29.720 --> 1:49:30.720]  we're going to get this out.
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:32.720]  This video and audio is on infowars.com.
[1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:34.720]  Spread it from Gateway Pundit.
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:36.720]  Here it is.
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:40.720]  Your chairperson can issue him what type of ballot?
[1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:41.720]  A provisional.
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:43.720]  A provisional envelope.
[1:49:43.720 --> 1:49:44.720]  Why?
[1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:46.720]  Where is it going?
[1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:49.720]  Not in the tabulator.
[1:49:49.720 --> 1:49:53.720]  It's going in that envelope, right?
[1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:55.720]  We have how many days?
[1:49:55.720 --> 1:49:57.720]  Six.
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:00.720]  So what is the Department of Elections going to do with it?
[1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:02.720]  Destroy it.
[1:50:11.720 --> 1:50:16.720]  They explain how to commit crimes on this tape to get ballots and fill them in themselves.
[1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:20.720]  Step one, kick out the poll challengers.
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:23.720]  It's like 30 minutes of this.
[1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:26.720]  Challengers and poll watchers.
[1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:30.720]  They have to wear a mask, and they have to stay six feet.
[1:50:30.720 --> 1:50:34.720]  That's important because they can come behind your table.
[1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:38.720]  But if you don't have six feet, they can't come back there.
[1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:39.720]  Any questions?
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:41.720]  By the way, hit pause and back that up.
[1:50:41.720 --> 1:50:43.720]  We're going to come back with more of this.
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:44.720]  There's an 11-minute clip.
[1:50:44.720 --> 1:50:47.720]  I saw a 30-minute clip of this.
[1:50:47.720 --> 1:50:51.720]  She says, they can't come check what you're doing and they can't go back there and look
[1:50:51.720 --> 1:50:55.720]  because the six-feet rule, which has been overturned by the Supreme Court of Michigan
[1:50:55.720 --> 1:50:57.720]  and federal courts, but they don't care.
[1:50:57.720 --> 1:50:59.720]  With Whitmer Hill, she don't kill old people all day.
[1:50:59.720 --> 1:51:00.720]  She doesn't care.
[1:51:00.720 --> 1:51:02.720]  She's a monster.
[1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:06.720]  And by the way, they've been given standard stuff by the Democrats to say,
[1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:08.720]  you don't let poll watchers be in there.
[1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:11.720]  You don't do any of it.
[1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:13.720]  We're going to come back and play this for you.
[1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:16.720]  Did you just hear COVID's the cover for everything?
[1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:17.720]  They actuary.
[1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:19.720]  They war-gamed it.
[1:51:19.720 --> 1:51:27.720]  All they did to feed it is to admit it's a fraud, know the scam, and reject it everywhere.
[1:51:27.720 --> 1:51:28.720]  Run your mouth everywhere.
[1:51:28.720 --> 1:51:29.720]  Don't comply.
[1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:32.720]  Businesses, be the businesses that say no to all this.
[1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:34.720]  You're going to win in court.
[1:51:34.720 --> 1:51:35.720]  People are going to support you.
[1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:38.720]  If you don't, you have no clue until you'll be destroyed.
[1:51:38.720 --> 1:51:39.720]  It's on record.
[1:51:39.720 --> 1:51:40.720]  It's not dispute.
[1:51:40.720 --> 1:51:42.720]  It was rolled out more than eight months ago in Congress, China.
[1:51:42.720 --> 1:51:47.720]  Now it's in Europe, now it's the United States, Canada, and the most other industrial parts of the planet.
[1:51:47.720 --> 1:51:54.720]  Every restaurant you go into, even small mom and pops, have QR codes for you to supposedly check their menu.
[1:51:54.720 --> 1:51:58.720]  And they really get upset if you ask for a paper menu, but of course they have them.
[1:51:58.720 --> 1:52:00.720]  Now, what are they saying there?
[1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:02.720]  Well, you've got to have a cell phone to come in their establishment,
[1:52:02.720 --> 1:52:08.720]  and that you can't have a piece of paper because, oh, everybody's diseased and we're spreading germs.
[1:52:08.720 --> 1:52:13.720]  It's absolutely asinine. They can throw away the little one sheet papers if they actually believe that.
[1:52:13.720 --> 1:52:16.720]  Now, what this really is, is a contact tracing database.
[1:52:16.720 --> 1:52:21.720]  Again, this is admitted that everyone's being habituated in the scan to be part of.
[1:52:21.720 --> 1:52:24.720]  So in the future, everywhere you go is tracked officially.
[1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:26.720]  Now, your cell phone's already tracking.
[1:52:26.720 --> 1:52:28.720]  You already have home assistants watching and listening to you in your house.
[1:52:28.720 --> 1:52:34.720]  But now, this is officially rolling the sound where you won't buy or sell, have a job, do an airplane without it.
[1:52:34.720 --> 1:52:35.720]  And Bill Gates even admits it.
[1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:39.720]  So think about that, folks, and we'll look out.
[1:52:39.720 --> 1:52:42.720]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read,
[1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:45.720]  if you want your children to listen to you, whisper.
[1:52:45.720 --> 1:52:47.720]  And it's true.
[1:52:47.720 --> 1:52:50.720]  A lot of times, if somebody's shouting and yelling,
[1:52:50.720 --> 1:52:54.720]  even if what they're talking about is important, people tend to tune it out.
[1:52:54.720 --> 1:52:55.720]  You know why I know that?
[1:52:55.720 --> 1:52:57.720]  Because I'm Alex Jones.
[1:52:57.720 --> 1:53:02.720]  And I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried about the New World Order.
[1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:06.720]  And I read about all their plans to lockdown civilization, start of the third world,
[1:53:06.720 --> 1:53:09.720]  and then enslave the first world.
[1:53:09.720 --> 1:53:12.720]  So I've been really, really loud and really, really aggressive.
[1:53:12.720 --> 1:53:14.720]  And we've had a big effect.
[1:53:14.720 --> 1:53:18.720]  But now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way
[1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:22.720]  where you can get people to think for themselves before it's too late.
[1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:28.720]  The lockdown, social distancing, the mask is meant to end human civilization.
[1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:32.720]  We are under a civilization collapse weapon.
[1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:34.720]  So this is live and death.
[1:53:34.720 --> 1:53:59.720]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:53:59.720 --> 1:54:17.720]  All right, so let's get back to this huge audio and video out of Detroit, Michigan,
[1:54:17.720 --> 1:54:24.720]  of the local precinct head training other people for election night.
[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:25.720]  How to engage in fraud.
[1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:30.720]  Here it is.
[1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:34.720]  Challengers and poll watchers.
[1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:38.720]  They have to wear a mask and they have to stay six feet.
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:41.720]  That's important because they can come behind your table.
[1:54:41.720 --> 1:54:46.720]  But if you don't have six feet, they can't come back there.
[1:54:46.720 --> 1:54:47.720]  Any questions?
[1:54:47.720 --> 1:54:57.720]  Six feet back was a really good vision.
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:54:58.720]  That's the rule, right?
[1:54:58.720 --> 1:55:05.720]  You hear that old room of people laugh.
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:11.720]  Joe Biden's about to get a lot of votes in Detroit and have to cancel out the rest of the state.
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:14.720]  Well, I bet more people vote in Detroit than live in Detroit.
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:15.720]  That's safe.
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:17.720]  That's the rule, right?
[1:55:17.720 --> 1:55:20.720]  And you are entitled to your six feet.
[1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:21.720]  Is that common?
[1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:22.720]  I mean, we expect that.
[1:55:22.720 --> 1:55:23.720]  Yep.
[1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:24.720]  It's common.
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:25.720]  You are entitled.
[1:55:25.720 --> 1:55:26.720]  It's the new.
[1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:27.720]  It's part of life forever.
[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:30.720]  Like Bill Gates said, it's never going back.
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:31.720]  Repudiate these frauds.
[1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:32.720]  Continue.
[1:55:32.720 --> 1:55:33.720]  They come.
[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:36.720]  I don't know if they're coming at every cruising, but they're coming to many of them in the city.
[1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:37.720]  Yes.
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:46.720]  We have already gotten word the state has already seen it.
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:47.720]  They are coming.
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:51.720]  And the basic thing they're going to challenge is what?
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:53.720]  The absentee battle.
[1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:55.720]  That is correct.
[1:55:55.720 --> 1:55:56.720]  Yes.
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:56:03.720]  What if they're like challenging when they start yelling, you're kind of making a scene?
[1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:04.720]  9-1-1.
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:05.720]  They got standards.
[1:56:05.720 --> 1:56:07.720]  They got conduct standards.
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:08.720]  Okay.
[1:56:08.720 --> 1:56:09.720]  They make a scene.
[1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:10.720]  Get them out of here.
[1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:13.720]  I don't call the police, though.
[1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:19.720]  So the Democrats don't want police, except when they're taking you to jail for not taking
[1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:20.720]  shots.
[1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:23.720]  The Board of Legislative Supervisors won't let you know about the state code, though, and
[1:56:23.720 --> 1:56:26.720]  the law that you're supposed to let them observe no matter what.
[1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:27.720]  Let's see.
[1:56:27.720 --> 1:56:28.720]  They got the COVID.
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:29.720]  It doesn't matter if it's not a law.
[1:56:29.720 --> 1:56:31.720]  It doesn't matter if it's been overthrown.
[1:56:31.720 --> 1:56:35.720]  Because these are globalists we're dealing with.
[1:56:35.720 --> 1:56:36.720]  All right.
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:38.720]  Who's been holding the longest now?
[1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:40.720]  That would be Joe in South Carolina.
[1:56:40.720 --> 1:56:41.720]  Thanks for holding Joe.
[1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:44.720]  You're on the air.
[1:56:44.720 --> 1:56:53.720]  You'd win the power ball before you or the person next to you could commit voter fraud.
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:58.720]  That's just Barry Obama.
[1:56:58.720 --> 1:56:59.720]  Last election.
[1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:00.720]  That's right.
[1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:01.720]  All right.
[1:57:01.720 --> 1:57:02.720]  They tell us that election fraud doesn't exist.
[1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:04.720]  So does the FBI Director.
[1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:05.720]  Yeah.
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:06.720]  I'm really worried about this.
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:12.520]  You know, we got so far they're saying last number I heard was 60,000 people already voted
[1:57:12.520 --> 1:57:13.520]  by mail.
[1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:20.080]  I think they're just going to keep on bringing in these ballots until they can hold up the
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:27.720]  election and just never announce a winner and then try to get him out in the court.
[1:57:27.720 --> 1:57:28.720]  That's what they're going to try.
[1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:30.720]  What do you think we can do about it?
[1:57:30.720 --> 1:57:31.720]  I don't know.
[1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:35.720]  Just tell everybody you know to get to the polls and vote in person on November 3rd.
[1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:37.720]  I agree, brother.
[1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:39.720]  What else do you think is going to happen?
[1:57:39.720 --> 1:57:41.720]  I don't know.
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:42.720]  Don't know.
[1:57:42.720 --> 1:57:48.220]  Just watching and waiting, doing whatever I can, telling everybody about this program
[1:57:48.220 --> 1:57:51.720]  and others and just spreading the word, brother.
[1:57:51.720 --> 1:57:53.720]  That's all we could do.
[1:57:53.720 --> 1:57:56.720]  Well, 16 million people have already voted by mail.
[1:57:56.720 --> 1:58:00.720]  And once the Democrats who are known for their fraud get ahold of those.
[1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:01.720]  Here's an example.
[1:58:01.720 --> 1:58:06.720]  The FBI couldn't get one Republican to take money from Russia and they went over 5,000
[1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:07.720]  people.
[1:58:07.720 --> 1:58:11.220]  But they could get basically every Democrat they went to would take money.
[1:58:11.220 --> 1:58:12.720]  I mean, what is wrong with these people?
[1:58:12.720 --> 1:58:13.720]  What is wrong with Democrats?
[1:58:13.720 --> 1:58:16.720]  I didn't grow up thinking Democrats were that bad.
[1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:17.720]  Was I ignorant, Joe?
[1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:20.720]  Or have they always been this bad?
[1:58:20.720 --> 1:58:21.720]  I don't know.
[1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:26.720]  Another thing I want to bring up was I haven't lived at my parents' house for over a decade
[1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:28.720]  and they got a ballot for me.
[1:58:28.720 --> 1:58:29.720]  14 years.
[1:58:29.720 --> 1:58:31.720]  14 years I haven't lived in that house.
[1:58:31.720 --> 1:58:34.720]  They got a ballot for me and a registered Democrat.
[1:58:34.720 --> 1:58:37.720]  But I voted Republican in the last two elections.
[1:58:37.720 --> 1:58:39.720]  They're bombing everybody with those, my friend.
[1:58:39.720 --> 1:58:40.720]  Tell the story.
[1:58:40.720 --> 1:58:41.720]  Get it out there.
[1:58:41.720 --> 1:58:42.720]  You just did it here.
[1:58:42.720 --> 1:58:44.720]  Thank you so much, Joe, for holding me love you.
[1:58:44.720 --> 1:58:45.720]  All right.
[1:58:45.720 --> 1:58:47.720]  Coming up.
[1:58:47.720 --> 1:58:50.720]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[1:58:50.720 --> 1:58:52.720]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[1:58:52.720 --> 1:58:54.720]  Is your city too safe?
[1:58:56.720 --> 1:58:58.720]  Well, not anymore.
[1:58:58.720 --> 1:59:00.720]  Introducing Democrats.
[1:59:00.720 --> 1:59:04.720]  Politicians so incompetent they'll fill your neighborhood with liars,
[1:59:04.720 --> 1:59:09.720]  looting, rampant violence, and even homelessness.
[1:59:09.720 --> 1:59:14.720]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity.
[1:59:14.720 --> 1:59:16.720]  No more pesky law and order.
[1:59:16.720 --> 1:59:20.720]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[1:59:20.720 --> 1:59:25.720]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[1:59:25.720 --> 1:59:26.720]  But wait.
[1:59:26.720 --> 1:59:31.720]  Vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud,
[1:59:31.720 --> 1:59:35.720]  cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes.
[1:59:35.720 --> 1:59:47.720]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[1:59:55.720 --> 1:59:59.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:59:59.720 --> 2:00:07.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:07.720 --> 2:00:10.720]  Well, he's a great guy and he's a smart fella.
[2:00:10.720 --> 2:00:12.720]  He formerly was a lawyer until he quit doing that.
[2:00:12.720 --> 2:00:14.720]  He's also an army veteran.
[2:00:14.720 --> 2:00:19.720]  And he won a big award at Yale for his article dealing with martial law,
[2:00:19.720 --> 2:00:22.720]  Posse Comintatus at the law school.
[2:00:22.720 --> 2:00:24.720]  And now here we are all these years later.
[2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:26.720]  He was also one of the top stabbers for Ron Paul.
[2:00:26.720 --> 2:00:31.720]  Here we are all these years later with Stuart Rhodes, six days from the election,
[2:00:31.720 --> 2:00:34.720]  total censorship online, all hell breaking loose.
[2:00:34.720 --> 2:00:39.720]  Official Democrats saying they're going to arrest the leadership of the Liberty Movement,
[2:00:39.720 --> 2:00:41.720]  even when they can remove Trump.
[2:00:41.720 --> 2:00:47.720]  Democrats saying that they're going to rush the White House November 4th and 5th.
[2:00:47.720 --> 2:00:51.720]  The lefts claiming they're going to try to attack M4s as well.
[2:00:51.720 --> 2:00:53.720]  Not going to get into that too much on air.
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:01:00.720]  Meanwhile, a virus resurges, so does fear of more economic pain ahead, AP.
[2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:03.720]  Well, yeah, it's not the virus causing the collapse and the suicide.
[2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:05.720]  It's the shutdown doing it.
[2:01:05.720 --> 2:01:08.720]  And then all the Project Veritas video, you talk about smoking gun,
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:13.720]  a Republican consultant going around getting people to flip their votes to Democrat,
[2:01:13.720 --> 2:01:16.720]  admitting she's committing a crime on video.
[2:01:16.720 --> 2:01:18.720]  That's Project Veritas.
[2:01:18.720 --> 2:01:21.720]  And that's just where we are six days out from the elections.
[2:01:21.720 --> 2:01:24.720]  So Stuart Rhodes is the founder of Oathkeepers.
[2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:28.720]  And, man, I saw a piece on him just a few weeks ago in a major publication.
[2:01:28.720 --> 2:01:31.720]  It's like, Rhodes claims the Democrats want to overthrow the country.
[2:01:31.720 --> 2:01:34.720]  Rhodes claims they're going to try to cause a civil war.
[2:01:34.720 --> 2:01:38.720]  Rhodes claims they want to have states to see during a contested election.
[2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:42.720]  But they never point out that Rhodes said it was in the New York Times three months ago
[2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:44.720]  and Podesta said that's the plan, John Podesta.
[2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:48.720]  So this is psychological warfare where they admit they're doing all this.
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:52.720]  We say it's a bad idea and they go, oh, you're crazy.
[2:01:52.720 --> 2:01:56.720]  That doesn't exist.
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:57.720]  Simply amazing.
[2:01:57.720 --> 2:02:02.720]  So Stuart Rhodes, thank you so much for coming on with us to cover the waterfront here.
[2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:07.720]  How would you describe the battle space we're in and what we're headed for right now?
[2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:13.720]  It's both mass gaslighting, like you were just talking about, but also mass projection.
[2:02:13.720 --> 2:02:17.720]  They're accusing us of doing everything that they're actually trying to do.
[2:02:17.720 --> 2:02:22.720]  For example, you have terrorists in the streets, coercing Trump supporters trying to stop them
[2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:28.720]  from getting into Trump rallies, beating them for even just walking around with a Trump t-shirt on.
[2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:31.720]  And of course, you expect them to do that on election day.
[2:02:31.720 --> 2:02:36.720]  And so when those of us who are tasked with defending your rights announced we're going to stand up
[2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:42.720]  and protect people on election day, they immediately spin that as though that we're the ones going to be going out there.
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:47.720]  We're going to be out on the streets on election day outside of polls to intimidate voters.
[2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:49.720]  And that's what they're going to do.
[2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:53.720]  They're going to be stealing the election while accusing Trump and his followers of stealing it.
[2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:57.720]  They'll be out there coercing and threatening people while accusing us of doing it.
[2:02:57.720 --> 2:02:58.720]  And let's be clear.
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:05.720]  These are all classic fascist and communist tactics on record with the media saying Antifa doesn't exist.
[2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:07.720]  They're really making a run at this country.
[2:03:07.720 --> 2:03:10.720]  How do you think the globalist chai-com run is going?
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:11.720]  How's their attack going?
[2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:14.720]  I think it's going pretty well.
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:22.720]  The problem is they still have this massive pool of Americans out there who are dug in and are not going to recognize their fraud as being legitimate.
[2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:23.720]  That's the problem.
[2:03:23.720 --> 2:03:27.720]  But I think that if you're the Chinese, you're the communist Chinese, what would you want?
[2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:28.720]  What would you not want?
[2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:33.720]  A nation that's your major rival to have an internal battle, to have a civil war going on?
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:37.720]  So I think either way, the bad guys still win.
[2:03:37.720 --> 2:03:46.720]  Even if their side loses in the coming civil war, they still win by destabilizing the United States and knocking us down.
[2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:49.720]  And you just said something that is so profound.
[2:03:49.720 --> 2:03:50.720]  We asked, why are the chai-coms?
[2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:51.720]  Why is Hollywood?
[2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:53.720]  Why are the big tech companies all allied doing this?
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:55.720]  Because there's never retribution.
[2:03:55.720 --> 2:03:56.720]  If they get Biden in, they win.
[2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:59.720]  If they can divide the country, they win.
[2:03:59.720 --> 2:04:03.720]  Because Americans are too stupid and too lazy and too decadent to understand it.
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:08.720]  And so China's been threatening to physically attack the U.S. or Japan if we ship defensive weapons to Taiwan.
[2:04:08.720 --> 2:04:11.720]  They've been threatening to invade Taiwan and Hong Kong.
[2:04:11.720 --> 2:04:17.720]  Why doesn't the U.S. threaten retaliation against China if they don't stop meddling in our internal affairs?
[2:04:17.720 --> 2:04:21.720]  I think Trump needs to take it directly to them and not just say China runs the Democrats,
[2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:24.720]  but take it right to them and say, we hold you responsible for this,
[2:04:24.720 --> 2:04:26.720]  because I think that's what the American people need to understand.
[2:04:26.720 --> 2:04:30.720]  If they get that, they'll fully line up behind the president.
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:33.720]  Well, I think you should do a massive data dump.
[2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:36.720]  He has the authority as commander-in-chief to classify anything.
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:37.720]  You should start.
[2:04:37.720 --> 2:04:39.720]  You should start declassifying all the files.
[2:04:39.720 --> 2:04:45.720]  All the swamp water is a secret that are being held over the heads of all these corrupt politicians,
[2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:47.720]  not just Hunter Biden and his father.
[2:04:47.720 --> 2:04:48.720]  That's the tip of the iceberg.
[2:04:48.720 --> 2:04:50.720]  But Trump should do a data dump.
[2:04:50.720 --> 2:04:51.720]  That's right.
[2:04:51.720 --> 2:04:54.720]  Releasing it all gives the Chinese no more power.
[2:04:54.720 --> 2:04:55.720]  Right.
[2:04:55.720 --> 2:04:57.720]  You expose who's been bought out by them.
[2:04:57.720 --> 2:04:59.720]  You expose all their tentacles in the United States.
[2:04:59.720 --> 2:05:00.720]  It's our deep state.
[2:05:00.720 --> 2:05:03.720]  The only way to ever really drain the swamp is to declassify all the secrets.
[2:05:03.720 --> 2:05:04.720]  That's what he should do.
[2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:06.720]  I think he should do that right now.
[2:05:06.720 --> 2:05:08.720]  He should do that as his nuclear option.
[2:05:08.720 --> 2:05:11.720]  They're trying to sell him and remove him from office illegitimately.
[2:05:11.720 --> 2:05:12.720]  I agree.
[2:05:12.720 --> 2:05:15.720]  Trump needs to launch nuclear options now and not just roll the dice,
[2:05:15.720 --> 2:05:18.720]  because the enemies we face are too powerful.
[2:05:18.720 --> 2:05:20.720]  He needs to launch nuclear options.
[2:05:20.720 --> 2:05:21.720]  What are those?
[2:05:21.720 --> 2:05:23.720]  Data dump, all the CIA and FBI files.
[2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:24.720]  What else?
[2:05:24.720 --> 2:05:25.720]  Absolutely.
[2:05:25.720 --> 2:05:26.720]  That's a big one.
[2:05:26.720 --> 2:05:27.720]  That is the swamp water.
[2:05:27.720 --> 2:05:30.720]  The swamp water and all the swamp creatures swim in are the secrets.
[2:05:30.720 --> 2:05:32.720]  They both protect them and control them.
[2:05:32.720 --> 2:05:37.720]  All that Epsom was doing, all the other pedophile rings, the blackmail politicians,
[2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:39.720]  all of that is about control.
[2:05:39.720 --> 2:05:41.720]  You throw the skeletons out in the streets.
[2:05:41.720 --> 2:05:43.720]  They no longer have any power or control over those politicians.
[2:05:43.720 --> 2:05:48.720]  And all of us will know who the crooks are and who the few good ones are.
[2:05:48.720 --> 2:05:50.720]  And then after that, leave it to us.
[2:05:50.720 --> 2:05:55.720]  The veterans of this country will go in and put it to them and take them into custody
[2:05:55.720 --> 2:05:56.720]  and do what we have to do.
[2:05:56.720 --> 2:05:57.720]  Do not trust the FBI.
[2:05:57.720 --> 2:06:00.720]  I mean, obviously the FBI is neck deep in us themselves.
[2:06:00.720 --> 2:06:04.720]  Well, that's because they're blackmailing compromise as well.
[2:06:04.720 --> 2:06:05.720]  Sure.
[2:06:05.720 --> 2:06:08.720]  All of them, all the major players, I would say, all the way up to the very top,
[2:06:08.720 --> 2:06:11.720]  including Chief Justice Roberts are probably compromised.
[2:06:11.720 --> 2:06:12.720]  And we all know this.
[2:06:12.720 --> 2:06:14.720]  You've been talking about this for years.
[2:06:14.720 --> 2:06:17.720]  But I think Trump has the one last chance as a massive data dump
[2:06:17.720 --> 2:06:18.720]  and start declassifying.
[2:06:18.720 --> 2:06:21.720]  If Trump doesn't do that the next three days,
[2:06:21.720 --> 2:06:24.720]  what do you expect to happen and what are the other options?
[2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:27.720]  I mean, doesn't launch the nuclear option?
[2:06:27.720 --> 2:06:30.720]  How do we fight conventionally?
[2:06:30.720 --> 2:06:31.720]  Well, it's a problem.
[2:06:31.720 --> 2:06:33.720]  If he then declares an insurrection to be an effect,
[2:06:33.720 --> 2:06:36.720]  which is what's going to happen after Election Day, as we already know,
[2:06:36.720 --> 2:06:37.720]  the left is going to go nuts.
[2:06:37.720 --> 2:06:42.720]  They're going to accuse the right of stealing the election of suppressing voters of not counting ballots
[2:06:42.720 --> 2:06:45.720]  and they're going to riot in the streets and try to do a color revolution.
[2:06:45.720 --> 2:06:47.720]  The only way to really stop that is the data dump.
[2:06:47.720 --> 2:06:51.720]  Expose, you know, the real bad guys throw a lot of skills down the street,
[2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:53.720]  get them out of the closet, throw them in the streets.
[2:06:53.720 --> 2:06:56.720]  And then the average American seeing that will know exactly who's dirty.
[2:06:56.720 --> 2:07:01.720]  But sort of that, they're going to accuse him of trying to stay in power illegitimately
[2:07:01.720 --> 2:07:04.720]  by evoking the Insurrection Act after Election Day.
[2:07:04.720 --> 2:07:05.720]  That's why he should have done it, in my opinion,
[2:07:05.720 --> 2:07:09.720]  he should have done it before Election Day when he was the clear undisputed president of the United States.
[2:07:09.720 --> 2:07:11.720]  Now they're going to wait until afterwards.
[2:07:11.720 --> 2:07:12.720]  They're going to declare him illegitimate.
[2:07:12.720 --> 2:07:15.720]  And then he'll try to suppress the insurrection.
[2:07:15.720 --> 2:07:17.720]  And they'll point to that and say, see, he's a dictator,
[2:07:17.720 --> 2:07:18.720]  and which will justify-
[2:07:18.720 --> 2:07:20.720]  That's exactly what Podesta war games.
[2:07:20.720 --> 2:07:22.720]  So he even had the little bastards war game.
[2:07:22.720 --> 2:07:27.720]  Think about the arrogance of him letting the New York Times into a Democrat war game over Zoom.
[2:07:27.720 --> 2:07:29.720]  I mean, why the hell are they even telegraphing it?
[2:07:29.720 --> 2:07:32.720]  Is that a confidence game or what is it?
[2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:34.720]  Well, I think it's instructions to their people.
[2:07:34.720 --> 2:07:36.720]  This is what's going to happen is how we're going to do this.
[2:07:36.720 --> 2:07:40.720]  And they're so confident that they control media and a legal system
[2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:46.720]  if they believe that they put enough pressure and at least the color of this being legitimate
[2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:50.720]  that they'll be able to press through in the courts a decision that goes their way.
[2:07:50.720 --> 2:07:53.720]  Because don't forget, they have compromised justices as well.
[2:07:53.720 --> 2:07:55.720]  I think Roberts is one of them.
[2:07:55.720 --> 2:07:58.720]  And that's why they're so pissed about Amy Coney Barrett,
[2:07:58.720 --> 2:08:03.720]  is they think she will vote for Trump and finally breaks the fact that at least one or two are compromised.
[2:08:03.720 --> 2:08:05.720]  You think that's accurate?
[2:08:05.720 --> 2:08:07.720]  Well, yeah, that's why there's this sort of demonized the court now.
[2:08:07.720 --> 2:08:11.720]  They're trying to say, well, this is illegitimate because she was confirmed and she shouldn't have been.
[2:08:11.720 --> 2:08:14.720]  Even though it was perfectly constitutional and perfectly legal,
[2:08:14.720 --> 2:08:17.720]  they're going to now attack the credibility of the court.
[2:08:17.720 --> 2:08:24.720]  So no matter what.
[2:08:24.720 --> 2:08:26.720]  All right, Stuart Rhodes, Skype froze.
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:29.720]  We will go back to him as soon as it comes back on.
[2:08:29.720 --> 2:08:33.720]  Folks, you notice everything we said a year ago, six months ago is all happening.
[2:08:33.720 --> 2:08:34.720]  People thought I was fair mongering.
[2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:35.720]  I'm not fair mongering.
[2:08:35.720 --> 2:08:37.720]  The Democrats are public about this.
[2:08:37.720 --> 2:08:42.720]  As Stuart Rhodes said, they do it because it's their battle plan.
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:44.720]  And they want to legitimize it.
[2:08:44.720 --> 2:08:49.720]  So again, as soon as we get a Skype reconnect, we will, they're going to do this.
[2:08:49.720 --> 2:08:55.720]  And they already have this control grid of big tech censoring everybody where you can't get medical news,
[2:08:55.720 --> 2:09:00.720]  where you can't get political news, where only what official news says is allowed.
[2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:02.720]  This is an electronic straight jacket.
[2:09:02.720 --> 2:09:12.720]  Stuart, we're going to break, but what are the other topics you want to hit when we come back?
[2:09:12.720 --> 2:09:14.720]  Still working on his Skype.
[2:09:14.720 --> 2:09:17.720]  We'll just come back to Stuart here in just a moment.
[2:09:17.720 --> 2:09:23.720]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host info wars.com and news wars.com are the websites.
[2:09:23.720 --> 2:09:31.720]  And we have the new site because Twitter has now banned another URL, not banned on video, not 2020 election center.
[2:09:31.720 --> 2:09:36.720]  But now we have election night.news election night.news.
[2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:41.720]  One word, big brother, big tech hopes you do not share election night.news.
[2:09:41.720 --> 2:09:45.720]  If you want the track arms to win, do not spread election night.news.
[2:09:45.720 --> 2:09:51.720]  In January and February of the year 2020, the communist super state, China,
[2:09:51.720 --> 2:09:57.720]  working through the United Nations told the world how we are now supposed to live our lives after COVID.
[2:09:57.720 --> 2:10:03.720]  Permanent social distancing, permanent mask, apps to track everywhere we go,
[2:10:03.720 --> 2:10:09.720]  and what we do contact tracers coming to our doors with the police and dragging us away.
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:14.720]  This is the authoritarian medical tyranny takeover.
[2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:18.720]  And it's never going to end until we start standing up and saying no.
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:25.720]  Already Fauci and the WHO and the communist Chinese are all over the news saying the lockdowns are permanent.
[2:10:25.720 --> 2:10:30.720]  Bill Gates said at least 10 years last week until restrictions are raised.
[2:10:30.720 --> 2:10:37.720]  By then we'll all be totally and completely trained to live under slavery and it will never end.
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:42.720]  This is the authoritarian takeover. Everyone must resist. Everyone must speak up.
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:45.720]  Everyone must say no now.
[2:10:46.720 --> 2:10:50.720]  China is open. America is closed.
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:55.720]  And in the European Union where the people are revolting trying to get out of the authoritarian tyranny,
[2:10:55.720 --> 2:10:58.720]  they're also under even greater levels of lockdown.
[2:10:58.720 --> 2:11:02.720]  It's very simple. Where authoritarians are, you have complete control.
[2:11:02.720 --> 2:11:08.720]  China, oh, there's no more lockdowns and there are heroes and the UN says they're the example for assault.
[2:11:08.720 --> 2:11:13.720]  After all, that's where the virus came from. After all, that's where the fear monster came from.
[2:11:13.720 --> 2:11:18.720]  The lockdown came from, but that was a weapon, a psychological hysteria,
[2:11:18.720 --> 2:11:27.720]  a chicken little syndrome being created that was to be aimed at us and used to invoke our fear
[2:11:27.720 --> 2:11:30.720]  and have us go into a stampede of mass hysteria.
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:33.720]  And so far it's been incredibly successful.
[2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:39.720]  Until just the last few weeks as across the world, humanity awakens in the fact that COVID-19
[2:11:39.720 --> 2:12:01.720]  is a giant UN Communist Chinese World Government power graph.
[2:12:09.720 --> 2:12:11.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:42.720]  That's really got the system so concerned.
[2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:50.720]  Oathkeepers, but looking at the censorship, how it's across the board now and how Congress failed to act.
[2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:54.720]  Now Congress is filing lawsuits against Google and things a day later, dollar short.
[2:12:54.720 --> 2:12:55.720]  What should have been the action?
[2:12:55.720 --> 2:12:59.720]  I mean, is it this racketeering, organized crime, collusion by big tech
[2:12:59.720 --> 2:13:03.720]  when they admit they're going out for certain classes of people?
[2:13:03.720 --> 2:13:10.720]  Yeah, absolutely. They lied to Congress in their face what last year and what they should have done
[2:13:10.720 --> 2:13:14.720]  is the DOJ should have investigated them and should have been prosecuting them already
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:19.720]  for everything you just said, for racketeering or conspiracy to violate civil rights.
[2:13:19.720 --> 2:13:23.720]  I mean, for fraud, fraud of the inducement and fraud of the delivery.
[2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:27.720]  When you sign up for Facebook, you agree to terms of service,
[2:13:27.720 --> 2:13:29.720]  but they don't comply with their own terms of service.
[2:13:29.720 --> 2:13:32.720]  They will shout a ban you or outright ban you.
[2:13:32.720 --> 2:13:34.720]  We had a half a million followers on our Facebook page.
[2:13:34.720 --> 2:13:38.720]  It took down our Facebook page and all of our state pages in one day
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:41.720]  and all of our personal accounts were deleted as well.
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:43.720]  No due process whatsoever.
[2:13:43.720 --> 2:13:46.720]  And how it works is mainstream media will tattle on you and say,
[2:13:46.720 --> 2:13:51.720]  oh, look, they've got followers and then big tech responds and bans.
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:54.720]  Yeah, so it's now obvious what they're doing.
[2:13:54.720 --> 2:13:58.720]  But no, the Trump administration, frankly, has been asleep with a switch
[2:13:58.720 --> 2:14:02.720]  when it comes to prosecuting any of these people under federal law,
[2:14:02.720 --> 2:14:04.720]  under existing federal law, and it's long overdue.
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:06.720]  They should have been through a long time ago.
[2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:12.720]  That's the problem, though, is that they all have a feeling of...
[2:14:12.720 --> 2:14:14.720]  A feeling of invincibility, a feeling that they're not gonna...
[2:14:14.720 --> 2:14:16.720]  They're all the way down to the antifa industry.
[2:14:16.720 --> 2:14:17.720]  They can beat people with impunity.
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:18.720]  They get bailed out.
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:20.720]  So they all feel like a total carte blanche.
[2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:21.720]  And I don't blame them.
[2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:24.720]  I mean, the Trump DOJ has done nothing.
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:25.720]  Reality.
[2:14:25.720 --> 2:14:27.720]  That's why they're so scared of Trump getting in.
[2:14:27.720 --> 2:14:30.720]  He's already said he may get rid of Barr and Ray if re-elected.
[2:14:30.720 --> 2:14:33.720]  So what do you expect Trump to do if he is able to get re-elected,
[2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:35.720]  is able to get in?
[2:14:35.720 --> 2:14:37.720]  Well, I hope he does what he says he's gonna do.
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:40.720]  But, you know, I mean, he should have been doing that already.
[2:14:40.720 --> 2:14:41.720]  There's no point in waiting.
[2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:42.720]  That's the problem.
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:44.720]  They're always told, well, you gotta wait until you're re-elected
[2:14:44.720 --> 2:14:46.720]  or you can do any of these things.
[2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:48.720]  And there's no guarantee that he'll be re-elected.
[2:14:48.720 --> 2:14:50.720]  No guarantee he won't be assassinated.
[2:14:50.720 --> 2:14:52.720]  He should just do what's right from moment to moment
[2:14:52.720 --> 2:14:54.720]  and do what's right now and stop screwing around.
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:14:55.720]  That's what I think.
[2:14:55.720 --> 2:15:00.720]  And that's what the system fears most is direct action.
[2:15:00.720 --> 2:15:01.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:15:01.720 --> 2:15:04.720]  And that's the problem is they did what I knew they were going to do.
[2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:08.720]  Something they did with Reagan is they surrounded with establishment loyalists
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:12.720]  who will contain him and run the clock out until they've done the Trump.
[2:15:12.720 --> 2:15:14.720]  And now they convinced him, don't drop the hammer.
[2:15:14.720 --> 2:15:16.720]  Don't, you know, invoke the Insurrection Act.
[2:15:16.720 --> 2:15:18.720]  Don't put the troops on the border.
[2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:21.720]  Don't do all the things that he should have done to secure our Constitution
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:22.720]  and secure our public.
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:23.720]  Wait until you're re-elected.
[2:15:23.720 --> 2:15:24.720]  Then he can do these things.
[2:15:24.720 --> 2:15:25.720]  So now they got it here.
[2:15:25.720 --> 2:15:29.720]  But now he's going to be re-elected under what's going to be considered questionable
[2:15:29.720 --> 2:15:31.720]  circumstances that they've created.
[2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:34.720]  And they're going to have all these never Trumpers stabbing him in the back.
[2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:37.720]  Don't take it for granted that he'll win in the Supreme Court.
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:38.720]  Let's go to the Supreme Court.
[2:15:38.720 --> 2:15:41.720]  Don't take it for granted that all the deals have been made up.
[2:15:41.720 --> 2:15:42.720]  Stewart, I'll be honest with you.
[2:15:42.720 --> 2:15:43.720]  I have a bad feeling.
[2:15:43.720 --> 2:15:46.720]  And my gut was right last time that Trump was going to win.
[2:15:46.720 --> 2:15:48.720]  My analysis says he's going to win.
[2:15:48.720 --> 2:15:52.720]  But because of the fraud, they may just say he lost, have the media announce it.
[2:15:52.720 --> 2:15:55.720]  And then when he challenges it, they're calling him a dictator.
[2:15:55.720 --> 2:15:56.720]  They're the ones that are going to challenge.
[2:15:56.720 --> 2:15:59.720]  But if he challenges back, they've already defined that as dictatorship behavior.
[2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:04.720]  And he's going to be driven from power by these armies of methods.
[2:16:04.720 --> 2:16:06.720]  They've already got cranked up and ready to go in DC.
[2:16:06.720 --> 2:16:07.720]  Exactly.
[2:16:07.720 --> 2:16:11.720]  And frankly, we're concerned about a Benghazi style attack.
[2:16:11.720 --> 2:16:14.720]  That's why oath keepers will be posted outside of DC.
[2:16:14.720 --> 2:16:18.720]  We've got some of our best men working on the plan right now for where we're going to be.
[2:16:18.720 --> 2:16:21.720]  But we'll make sure that we're within range because I don't trust the Pentagon.
[2:16:21.720 --> 2:16:23.720]  I don't trust the brass.
[2:16:23.720 --> 2:16:27.720]  I don't trust even the Secretary of Defense to stand behind the president.
[2:16:27.720 --> 2:16:31.720]  And don't be surprised if you don't get the same kind of stand down order you saw with Benghazi.
[2:16:31.720 --> 2:16:33.720]  You had, you know, you had willing men.
[2:16:33.720 --> 2:16:36.720]  Well, the Joint Chiefs already told the Democrats two months ago and they said,
[2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:37.720]  will you help us overthrow Trump?
[2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:38.720]  They said, we will not get involved.
[2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:42.720]  Well, that's the same thing as helping them if they're going to have a stand down.
[2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:43.720]  Right.
[2:16:43.720 --> 2:16:44.720]  Exactly.
[2:16:44.720 --> 2:16:45.720]  That's the risk.
[2:16:45.720 --> 2:16:49.720]  As a stand down order last minute, you expect the military to save the White House.
[2:16:49.720 --> 2:16:53.720]  But if it's a stand down order given and they kept on post, then what happens?
[2:16:53.720 --> 2:16:56.720]  The same thing that happened in Benghazi, but intentionally done.
[2:16:56.720 --> 2:16:57.720]  That's what we're concerned about.
[2:16:57.720 --> 2:17:00.720]  So that's why people are on about and do what we can.
[2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:04.720]  And they're not in Cleveland like they were four and a half years ago when the state police and local police
[2:17:04.720 --> 2:17:05.720]  do what was going on.
[2:17:05.720 --> 2:17:07.720]  They knew there was a truck bomb plan.
[2:17:07.720 --> 2:17:12.720]  They for several blocks around it surrounded with dump trucks, thousands of police with their guns already
[2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:15.720]  so that no roads could get in there to actually do that.
[2:17:15.720 --> 2:17:19.720]  In the middle of DC, in the middle of a swamp surrounded by enemies.
[2:17:19.720 --> 2:17:22.720]  And certainly the president would probably be whisked away by Secret Service.
[2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:28.720]  But the problem is, is meanwhile you have the, you know, the victory for the radical left of the antifa flag
[2:17:28.720 --> 2:17:31.720]  or a communist flag flying over the White House.
[2:17:31.720 --> 2:17:32.720]  They would love to have that.
[2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:33.720]  And let's be clear.
[2:17:33.720 --> 2:17:36.720]  The Democrats already say, we're going to have our own inauguration.
[2:17:36.720 --> 2:17:38.720]  Geography doesn't matter if he's bunkered into the White House.
[2:17:38.720 --> 2:17:40.720]  And then Clinton talks about him in there with sandbags.
[2:17:40.720 --> 2:17:43.720]  They're obsessed with physically getting the White House.
[2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:45.720]  They told us.
[2:17:45.720 --> 2:17:46.720]  Yeah.
[2:17:46.720 --> 2:17:49.720]  So I think it'd be foolish not to expect that and not to plan for it.
[2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:50.720]  So that's what we're doing.
[2:17:50.720 --> 2:17:51.720]  Those keepers is planning for that.
[2:17:51.720 --> 2:17:55.720]  Because if 10,000 antifa try to climb over and don't care if they're getting shot,
[2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:58.720]  then the Secret Service are bad if they're mowing people down.
[2:17:58.720 --> 2:18:04.720]  Even 500 Secret Service are going to run out of bullets if 10,000, 20,000 people attack.
[2:18:04.720 --> 2:18:05.720]  Right.
[2:18:05.720 --> 2:18:06.720]  So that's what we're concerned about.
[2:18:06.720 --> 2:18:10.720]  I mean, I know it sounds outlandish and sounds kind of crazy, but given the trajectory of the left
[2:18:10.720 --> 2:18:13.720]  and how far they've gone into weather, underground terrorism already,
[2:18:13.720 --> 2:18:16.720]  I think it'd be foolish not to plan for that as a possibility.
[2:18:16.720 --> 2:18:21.720]  Also, the left are decoys for the real international multinational mercenary groups
[2:18:21.720 --> 2:18:25.720]  that literally could drive it in armored dump trucks with explosives
[2:18:25.720 --> 2:18:27.720]  and roll one in there and blow up the White House.
[2:18:27.720 --> 2:18:29.720]  I mean, this is real.
[2:18:29.720 --> 2:18:30.720]  Sure.
[2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:31.720]  There's that red-green alliance.
[2:18:31.720 --> 2:18:34.720]  They have a lot of jihadists who are well-trained and experienced in warfare.
[2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:36.720]  And of course, you have the PLA advisors.
[2:18:36.720 --> 2:18:39.720]  Wherever there's going to be material, you can expect there to be advisors as well.
[2:18:39.720 --> 2:18:41.720]  So they'll be surprised, we don't find out later,
[2:18:41.720 --> 2:18:47.720]  that there were PLA advisors directly involved in the plans surrounding Election Day.
[2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:49.720]  What about executive action?
[2:18:49.720 --> 2:18:51.720]  You know, that's a term usually used for killing a president.
[2:18:51.720 --> 2:18:52.720]  What about the other way around?
[2:18:52.720 --> 2:18:55.720]  I'm not an authoritarian guy, but when you're faced with Chinese operatives
[2:18:55.720 --> 2:19:01.720]  funding Democrats, that makes them literally enemy combatants in the truest sort.
[2:19:01.720 --> 2:19:05.720]  I know you wrote papers on enemy combatant status, but what do you call this
[2:19:05.720 --> 2:19:06.720]  when you've got these enemies?
[2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:07.720]  We know they're pulling this.
[2:19:07.720 --> 2:19:09.720]  We know they're foreign agents.
[2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:10.720]  We just let them keep pulling it.
[2:19:10.720 --> 2:19:12.720]  I mean, because if the Justice Department won't do its job,
[2:19:12.720 --> 2:19:17.720]  then constitutionally, where does it fall, the president, to the army?
[2:19:17.720 --> 2:19:20.720]  Well, it's treason is what it is.
[2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:24.720]  So what Trump should do is he should fire a bar and put in an aggressive prosecutor
[2:19:24.720 --> 2:19:26.720]  that will actually enforce the law.
[2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:28.720]  That's what he should do right away.
[2:19:28.720 --> 2:19:31.720]  And then have the hostage rescue team and the FBI go arrest a few hundred globalists.
[2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:33.720]  They'll roll over and quit.
[2:19:33.720 --> 2:19:35.720]  Well, that's why he should do the declassification.
[2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:38.720]  If he does a declassification of the dirty secrets that control them,
[2:19:38.720 --> 2:19:41.720]  they will expose not only them, but it will expose the deep state itself,
[2:19:41.720 --> 2:19:45.720]  the actual deep state, the ones that are the ones that are blackmailing everybody else.
[2:19:45.720 --> 2:19:47.720]  So he should use that nuclear option.
[2:19:47.720 --> 2:19:48.720]  He has the ability to do it.
[2:19:48.720 --> 2:19:52.720]  I'm sure he's being advised somehow he can't do it, but he has absolute authority
[2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:53.720]  to declassify anything he wants.
[2:19:53.720 --> 2:19:57.720]  Well, what we're seeing is the nuclear option by Chinese water torture.
[2:19:57.720 --> 2:20:00.720]  I mean, you know, it wasn't just the average Joe's got a lot of this stuff.
[2:20:00.720 --> 2:20:02.720]  I think Trump is dribbling it out, but not fast enough.
[2:20:02.720 --> 2:20:05.720]  I think you should flood it out now.
[2:20:05.720 --> 2:20:06.720]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:20:06.720 --> 2:20:07.720]  Don't flood it out completely.
[2:20:07.720 --> 2:20:12.720]  You should just order the Marine Corps to go seize the databases at the NSA and the FBI
[2:20:12.720 --> 2:20:17.720]  and just sit on it and let the military intelligence guys sift through it all
[2:20:17.720 --> 2:20:18.720]  and help them declassify it.
[2:20:18.720 --> 2:20:19.720]  Get it done.
[2:20:19.720 --> 2:20:23.720]  Let's talk about the historic time we're in with Stuart Rhodes,
[2:20:23.720 --> 2:20:26.720]  author, researcher, head of the Oath Keepers, an amazing patriot.
[2:20:26.720 --> 2:20:29.720]  Don't forget our new website is electionnight.news.
[2:20:29.720 --> 2:20:31.720]  That URL is not being censored right now.
[2:20:31.720 --> 2:20:33.720]  It's how you share a banned video and all the live feeds.
[2:20:33.720 --> 2:20:35.720]  It's how you defeat the new world order.
[2:20:35.720 --> 2:20:36.720]  Do you want to defeat them?
[2:20:36.720 --> 2:20:37.720]  Do you want to fight back?
[2:20:37.720 --> 2:20:38.720]  Then spread that leak.
[2:20:38.720 --> 2:20:40.720]  Electionnight.news.
[2:20:40.720 --> 2:20:41.720]  Stay with us.
[2:20:41.720 --> 2:21:10.720]  And OathKeepers.org.
[2:21:11.720 --> 2:21:16.720]  Because this is a UN Bill Gates globalist deployed corporate takeover
[2:21:16.720 --> 2:21:20.720]  where their businesses are all essential but our businesses aren't.
[2:21:20.720 --> 2:21:23.720]  This is destroying the world economy by design.
[2:21:23.720 --> 2:21:25.720]  This is economic warfare.
[2:21:25.720 --> 2:21:27.720]  This is war crime.
[2:21:27.720 --> 2:21:31.720]  And now they're coming with the attempted forced inoculations that Gates is pushing.
[2:21:31.720 --> 2:21:32.720]  Well, you know what that is.
[2:21:32.720 --> 2:21:37.720]  That violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, and so much more.
[2:21:37.720 --> 2:21:38.720]  Please spread the words.
[2:21:38.720 --> 2:21:43.720]  Please tell folks about banned.video and the facts that are posted there.
[2:21:43.720 --> 2:21:46.720]  CNN and the rest of the corporate media are running with the false headline
[2:21:46.720 --> 2:21:49.720]  that Trump has surrendered to the coronavirus.
[2:21:49.720 --> 2:21:50.720]  It's the opposite.
[2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:54.720]  He's not surrendering to the endless drumbeat of fear and false science
[2:21:54.720 --> 2:21:59.720]  that it's incredibly deadly and that we have a chance of eradicating it.
[2:21:59.720 --> 2:22:03.720]  Bill Gates, Fauci, and the UN have said, we will always wear masks.
[2:22:03.720 --> 2:22:04.720]  We will never shake hands.
[2:22:04.720 --> 2:22:08.720]  And even the vaccines won't protect us forever.
[2:22:08.720 --> 2:22:15.720]  And so the civilization as we know is over until every coronavirus in the world is eradicated.
[2:22:15.720 --> 2:22:17.720]  That's impossible.
[2:22:17.720 --> 2:22:18.720]  That's right.
[2:22:18.720 --> 2:22:20.720]  They're trying to say they have to have a cure to the common cold.
[2:22:20.720 --> 2:22:25.720]  That's what COVID-19 false positives for on the test.
[2:22:25.720 --> 2:22:28.720]  They created a problem that can never be defeated.
[2:22:28.720 --> 2:22:30.720]  But of course, they're the ones in charge of the problem.
[2:22:30.720 --> 2:22:35.720]  And so they stay in power forever and take control of society with contact tracers
[2:22:35.720 --> 2:22:39.720]  and now going with the police to people's doors in Texas at gunpoint
[2:22:39.720 --> 2:22:41.720]  and taking four samples.
[2:22:41.720 --> 2:22:43.720]  We must say no.
[2:22:43.720 --> 2:22:48.720]  Six months ago, the highly respected former head of the Rockefeller Hospital
[2:22:48.720 --> 2:22:55.720]  virology department went public and said the mainline science on virology is
[2:22:55.720 --> 2:22:58.720]  you cannot protect somebody from a virus like this.
[2:22:58.720 --> 2:23:00.720]  You have to wait till there's herd immunity.
[2:23:00.720 --> 2:23:04.720]  And there's never been a vaccine for any of the coronavirus family of viruses.
[2:23:04.720 --> 2:23:06.720]  They do not work.
[2:23:06.720 --> 2:23:10.720]  Well, even Bill Gates now admits, oh, the vaccine will really never work.
[2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:12.720]  But you have to keep social distancing and wearing masks.
[2:23:12.720 --> 2:23:14.720]  They're now saying forever.
[2:23:14.720 --> 2:23:15.720]  Last week, it was 10 years.
[2:23:15.720 --> 2:23:16.720]  Now it's forever.
[2:23:16.720 --> 2:23:18.720]  See how the power grab works?
[2:23:18.720 --> 2:23:23.720]  So when you hear them saying Trump is surrendering and his chief of staff is surrendering to coronavirus,
[2:23:23.720 --> 2:23:30.720]  when they say we just have to learn to live with it and boost our immunity with things like vitamin D, C, and, of course, zinc,
[2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:31.720]  that's the reality.
[2:23:31.720 --> 2:23:33.720]  That's not fear mongering.
[2:23:33.720 --> 2:23:37.720]  That's not giving in to the power grab and the endless fear of the new world order.
[2:23:37.720 --> 2:23:40.720]  They've created a problem to which there is no solution,
[2:23:40.720 --> 2:23:54.720]  but they are again the people that said they've got to be in charge.
[2:24:11.720 --> 2:24:16.720]  We talked before and you were saying that they had you on medication,
[2:24:16.720 --> 2:24:21.720]  but the medication with your creativity is with all kinds of things.
[2:24:21.720 --> 2:24:25.720]  It blocked my ability to channel what God wanted me to do.
[2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:28.720]  But we're all we're all on medication right now.
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:30.720]  Did you use toothpaste with fluoride today?
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:35.720]  It blocks your pineal gland and they put children on it and we put we put our kids on it.
[2:24:35.720 --> 2:24:44.720]  You know, we it's inside the the deodorants that we use is all these things to create like a disconnect to God to serve that.
[2:24:44.720 --> 2:24:46.720]  It's like, are you serving man?
[2:24:46.720 --> 2:24:50.720]  Are you serving the one and only master?
[2:24:50.720 --> 2:24:59.720]  The last figure I saw is there were 210,000 deaths due to COVID in America and everywhere you go,
[2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:09.720]  you see someone with a mask on with a they were a culture.
[2:25:09.720 --> 2:25:13.720]  I'll say it one time with abortion culture.
[2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:23.720]  There are 1000 black children aborted a day daily.
[2:25:23.720 --> 2:25:25.720]  We are in genocide.
[2:25:25.720 --> 2:25:34.720]  We so more black children have died in the past since February.
[2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:39.720]  Then people have died of COVID and everyone wears a mask.
[2:25:39.720 --> 2:25:48.720]  So it's a matter of where are we turning a blinds eye to like the media can control a lot of times it has control what we care about.
[2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:51.720]  I even heard somebody say at one point.
[2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:57.720]  Yep, that's Kanye West is a couple days ago down the street from my studios are with Joe Rogan.
[2:25:57.720 --> 2:25:59.720]  And I like Joe's show.
[2:25:59.720 --> 2:26:02.720]  But you know he has Jamie everything I say fact check it.
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:04.720]  He's like Kanye roll.
[2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:06.720]  Of course, what Connie was saying is all true.
[2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:07.720]  But here's the good news.
[2:26:07.720 --> 2:26:09.720]  I'm proud of this.
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:13.720]  Info Wars was instrumental in waking up Kanye West.
[2:26:13.720 --> 2:26:14.720]  He's talking about.
[2:26:14.720 --> 2:26:16.720]  And so see how that works.
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:20.720]  Even though Alex Jones isn't on the Joe Rogan show.
[2:26:20.720 --> 2:26:26.720]  I am on the Joe Rogan show because you're on the Joe Rogan show fluoride in the water brain damaging us on record.
[2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:28.720]  The targeting of the children for abortion.
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:30.720]  Oh, but they love you so much.
[2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:31.720]  Oh, they want to save you.
[2:26:31.720 --> 2:26:33.720]  Oh, 14 black guys got killed by the cops wrongly.
[2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:34.720]  Let's riot.
[2:26:34.720 --> 2:26:35.720]  But oh, millions of black kids died.
[2:26:35.720 --> 2:26:36.720]  Nobody cares.
[2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:37.720]  Kanye is exposing it.
[2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:38.720]  It's beautiful.
[2:26:38.720 --> 2:26:42.720]  Stuart Rhodes only a few phone calls with you because it's all on the same side of the election.
[2:26:42.720 --> 2:26:43.720]  What's coming up.
[2:26:43.720 --> 2:26:46.720]  But talk about the great awakening.
[2:26:46.720 --> 2:26:48.720]  The globalists have got to be scared.
[2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:56.720]  They've got to see how they get away with putting Biden in with all this Chinese propaganda and espionage coming out.
[2:26:56.720 --> 2:27:01.720]  Unless they're going to try to bring in a total tearing to suppress all of us once they get in.
[2:27:01.720 --> 2:27:07.720]  But lo and behold, the Democrats, as you know, not just, you know, disgraced former MSNBC host like Eve Overman,
[2:27:07.720 --> 2:27:10.720]  but but but Democrat leaders are saying they're going to punish us.
[2:27:10.720 --> 2:27:11.720]  They're going to arrest us.
[2:27:11.720 --> 2:27:13.720]  They're going to get the leadership.
[2:27:13.720 --> 2:27:14.720]  We're terrorists.
[2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:18.720]  They're going to take over if Biden is able to get in or they're able to assassinate Trump.
[2:27:18.720 --> 2:27:21.720]  We really should be thank our lucky stars and pray for the president.
[2:27:21.720 --> 2:27:26.720]  You're a smart war game, you know, military background, also former lawyer, all of it.
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:28.720]  You've had a good crystal ball.
[2:27:28.720 --> 2:27:29.720]  What happens?
[2:27:29.720 --> 2:27:32.720]  God forbid if Biden gets in.
[2:27:32.720 --> 2:27:33.720]  It's it.
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:38.720]  I think I think at least about a third of this country will not recognize him as being legitimate.
[2:27:38.720 --> 2:27:39.720]  And I'm one of them.
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:41.720]  I don't trust the electoral system any longer.
[2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:42.720]  It's the problem.
[2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:44.720]  It's it's been so so many times.
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:47.720]  Project Various, you know, multiple videos exposing and doing awesome work.
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:49.720]  They do exposing all the fraud.
[2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:50.720]  It's already admitted.
[2:27:50.720 --> 2:27:51.720]  It's already been going on.
[2:27:51.720 --> 2:27:52.720]  And so that's the problem.
[2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:57.720]  And that's what that's what happens when you're trying to attack a country and destroy it from within you.
[2:27:57.720 --> 2:28:03.720]  You make sure that everyone questions the legitimacy of their government and the system.
[2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:08.720]  And so they win in a way they win, even with us not trusting the results.
[2:28:08.720 --> 2:28:12.720]  So either way, you want to be the stabilized country, but no, I can't.
[2:28:12.720 --> 2:28:13.720]  I can't concede that to Biden.
[2:28:13.720 --> 2:28:14.720]  I think I think it's going to be stolen.
[2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:17.720]  I think I think Trump will beat him soundly unless it's stolen.
[2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:22.720]  And so you're going to have you don't wind up very much like 1861 with with the after country, not trusting results.
[2:28:22.720 --> 2:28:23.720]  Either way it goes.
[2:28:23.720 --> 2:28:24.720]  That's where we're at.
[2:28:24.720 --> 2:28:28.720]  But the big picture behind that is this massive ideological division in this country.
[2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:31.720]  You know, the the left has gone full Marxist.
[2:28:31.720 --> 2:28:36.720]  The Democratic Party is now the party of communism that they are.
[2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:39.720]  And it's probably a totalitarianism.
[2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:43.720]  Someone like Biden, of course, is an old school corrupt Democrat.
[2:28:43.720 --> 2:28:48.720]  He's not, you know, same same category as some of the new true believer leftist, but he'll be controlled by them.
[2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:49.720]  He's only a puppet.
[2:28:49.720 --> 2:28:54.720]  And so we're going to see a full court press to lock down this country and impose.
[2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:55.720]  That's right.
[2:28:55.720 --> 2:29:00.720]  He's fully endorsed Bernie Sanders and AOC and all these other pieces of filth.
[2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:02.720]  Sure, because he's riding their way.
[2:29:02.720 --> 2:29:07.720]  It's a wave of communism on the left and a wave of populism and nationalism on the right.
[2:29:07.720 --> 2:29:11.720]  Those are two competing clashing visions for this country and irreconcilable.
[2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:13.720]  What about retribution against China?
[2:29:13.720 --> 2:29:15.720]  I mean, I've Trump hit him with massive tariffs.
[2:29:15.720 --> 2:29:17.720]  We cut off a lot of their operatives.
[2:29:17.720 --> 2:29:19.720]  We've cut off the money to the Democrats.
[2:29:19.720 --> 2:29:21.720]  But this is a military attack.
[2:29:21.720 --> 2:29:25.720]  I mean, I'm not I love the Trumps, the big peacemaker and get this out of these wars.
[2:29:25.720 --> 2:29:26.720]  But now we're actually under attack story.
[2:29:26.720 --> 2:29:28.720]  Now I want some I mean, I want some pushback.
[2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:31.720]  But how do you do that with the nuclear power?
[2:29:31.720 --> 2:29:36.720]  Well, what you do is proxy warfare, the Democrats and all the leftists that are that are part
[2:29:36.720 --> 2:29:37.720]  of their proxy warfare.
[2:29:37.720 --> 2:29:40.720]  So we're fighting right now in the streets, which you got to go.
[2:29:40.720 --> 2:29:45.720]  You got to root out the leadership, the ones that have turned the turncoats, the traders
[2:29:45.720 --> 2:29:48.720]  who have turned over and are bought up by the Chinese.
[2:29:48.720 --> 2:29:49.720]  That's why you can't can see the left coast.
[2:29:49.720 --> 2:29:53.720]  I've heard many painters say, well, you let California go and Washington State, Oregon.
[2:29:53.720 --> 2:29:55.720]  That's a that's a massive mistake.
[2:29:55.720 --> 2:29:56.720]  You can't do that.
[2:29:56.720 --> 2:29:59.720]  Or you have a communist Chinese foothold on US soil.
[2:29:59.720 --> 2:30:00.720]  No, no, I agree.
[2:30:00.720 --> 2:30:03.720]  We have to ideologically retake those areas.
[2:30:03.720 --> 2:30:07.720]  You're going to have to just it's going to wind up being a war going to defeat them
[2:30:07.720 --> 2:30:08.720]  in warfare.
[2:30:08.720 --> 2:30:11.720]  And then you got to figure out, you know, it's kind of like with the founding fathers dealing
[2:30:11.720 --> 2:30:12.720]  with the loyalists.
[2:30:12.720 --> 2:30:13.720]  What do you do with these people?
[2:30:13.720 --> 2:30:16.720]  And by the way, you just said that the left sees the West Coast with all the Chinese
[2:30:16.720 --> 2:30:18.720]  investment has already broken away.
[2:30:18.720 --> 2:30:22.720]  That's why Podesta in that war game with the New York Times said, we're going to have the
[2:30:22.720 --> 2:30:24.720]  Western states secede the West Coast.
[2:30:24.720 --> 2:30:27.720]  We don't want to give them what they already want.
[2:30:27.720 --> 2:30:28.720]  Yeah.
[2:30:28.720 --> 2:30:29.720]  Why do why give it up?
[2:30:29.720 --> 2:30:30.720]  Don't you can't can't do that.
[2:30:30.720 --> 2:30:31.720]  And it's a it's a thing.
[2:30:31.720 --> 2:30:33.720]  You're not going to make peace with communists.
[2:30:33.720 --> 2:30:37.720]  You're not going to say, OK, you can keep those three states and that'll be common land
[2:30:37.720 --> 2:30:38.720]  on US soil.
[2:30:38.720 --> 2:30:42.720]  But you can have that and then we'll get along after they always explode the territory they
[2:30:42.720 --> 2:30:46.720]  had to take over the bordering territory.
[2:30:46.720 --> 2:30:47.720]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:30:47.720 --> 2:30:51.720]  All you do then is give communist China a legit foothold on US soil.
[2:30:51.720 --> 2:30:52.720]  But they're already doing it.
[2:30:52.720 --> 2:30:55.720]  I mean, there's a Ho Chi Minh trail coming right through Mexico.
[2:30:55.720 --> 2:30:57.720]  They're bringing explosives and they're bringing RPGs.
[2:30:57.720 --> 2:30:59.720]  They're bringing all kinds of weapons.
[2:30:59.720 --> 2:31:01.720]  They're bringing in advisors as well.
[2:31:01.720 --> 2:31:03.720]  It's the same thing we saw is in Vietnam.
[2:31:03.720 --> 2:31:06.720]  It's just that goes through Mexico this time as we're going through Laos or Cambodia.
[2:31:06.720 --> 2:31:08.720]  Well, let's talk about military rules of engagement.
[2:31:08.720 --> 2:31:09.720]  I'm not going to do it.
[2:31:09.720 --> 2:31:14.720]  You know, you're there defensively, bringing resources into defend their president.
[2:31:14.720 --> 2:31:16.720]  That's the point we've gotten to.
[2:31:16.720 --> 2:31:21.720]  But if they have terror groups with RPGs attacking governor's mansions and capitals to create
[2:31:21.720 --> 2:31:26.720]  fear, obviously law enforcement needs to just take matters in their own hands.
[2:31:26.720 --> 2:31:29.720]  The citizens at a certain point are going to have to talk about this for only six days
[2:31:29.720 --> 2:31:30.720]  out from this.
[2:31:30.720 --> 2:31:34.720]  If, let's say, antifold, take credit, it'll be some globalist operatives.
[2:31:34.720 --> 2:31:38.720]  You know, kill some governors, blow up some stuff, blow up some conservative news publications
[2:31:38.720 --> 2:31:39.720]  that scare by the submission.
[2:31:39.720 --> 2:31:43.720]  You don't actually go out and try to find the people with the RPGs and attack that disappeared.
[2:31:43.720 --> 2:31:48.720]  No, you go after their commanders who are the Democrats that have openly aligned themselves
[2:31:48.720 --> 2:31:49.720]  with the Chai comms.
[2:31:49.720 --> 2:31:50.720]  Now, I'm not calling for that.
[2:31:50.720 --> 2:31:54.720]  I'm just saying militarily chasing the terrorists around is not what you do.
[2:31:54.720 --> 2:31:56.720]  You go after their commanders.
[2:31:56.720 --> 2:31:59.720]  But again, we don't have any command and control to go after their commanders.
[2:31:59.720 --> 2:32:01.720]  Well, you do both.
[2:32:01.720 --> 2:32:04.720]  You have to have a stability program where you defend your communities.
[2:32:04.720 --> 2:32:06.720]  That can be done by the average Joe.
[2:32:06.720 --> 2:32:10.720]  And then the more well-trained veterans, like your special warfare trained veterans, it
[2:32:10.720 --> 2:32:11.720]  should be there.
[2:32:11.720 --> 2:32:14.720]  That should be their tasks, go after the command and control of the bad guys.
[2:32:14.720 --> 2:32:16.720]  And that goes way up a ladder.
[2:32:16.720 --> 2:32:21.720]  So that's, if this blows up into a civil war, you will bet that our side will not just go
[2:32:21.720 --> 2:32:23.720]  and fight their street soldiers.
[2:32:23.720 --> 2:32:26.720]  We will go for their command and control also.
[2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:28.720]  That's a smart thing to do in warfare.
[2:32:28.720 --> 2:32:29.720]  That's just going to happen.
[2:32:29.720 --> 2:32:31.720]  And I think you're going to see that.
[2:32:31.720 --> 2:32:35.720]  We've had recent discussions with guys that are special warfare veterans and also current
[2:32:35.720 --> 2:32:36.720]  serving.
[2:32:36.720 --> 2:32:38.720]  They're paying very much attention to what's going on.
[2:32:38.720 --> 2:32:39.720]  And quite a few of them are waking up.
[2:32:39.720 --> 2:32:42.720]  And so it's not going to be an easy fight for the radical left.
[2:32:42.720 --> 2:32:47.720]  They're going to get swamped with very competent, battle-hardened veterans on our side.
[2:32:47.720 --> 2:32:50.720]  But again, the left are just cannon fodder.
[2:32:50.720 --> 2:32:53.720]  And so I'm not getting into the war planning or any of these things.
[2:32:53.720 --> 2:32:56.720]  But if you have Chai Khan back to attempt to overthrow the country, the Democrats admit
[2:32:56.720 --> 2:32:58.720]  they're overthrowing the country and they're trying to do it.
[2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:02.720]  I just simply don't want them to be able to model the battle space where Americans kill
[2:33:02.720 --> 2:33:03.720]  each other.
[2:33:03.720 --> 2:33:07.720]  I just want to have a discussion about how the traders are going to be treated, the collaborators
[2:33:07.720 --> 2:33:09.720]  that were part of this.
[2:33:09.720 --> 2:33:11.720]  Well, that's what trips should do the data dump.
[2:33:11.720 --> 2:33:17.720]  I mean, no one, unless they're completely insane, is going to turn a blind eye to very
[2:33:17.720 --> 2:33:20.720]  clear evidence that some of the pedophile, for example, is sitting senator.
[2:33:20.720 --> 2:33:21.720]  That's right.
[2:33:21.720 --> 2:33:25.720]  So you identify who the targets are by putting the dirt out on them?
[2:33:25.720 --> 2:33:26.720]  Sure.
[2:33:26.720 --> 2:33:27.720]  You put it out there WikiLeaks style.
[2:33:27.720 --> 2:33:32.720]  That's why a song is so dangerous to the deep state, you put it out there for everyone
[2:33:32.720 --> 2:33:33.720]  to see.
[2:33:33.720 --> 2:33:34.720]  Do the exact same thing.
[2:33:34.720 --> 2:33:35.720]  All right.
[2:33:35.720 --> 2:33:36.720]  Stay right there, Stuart Rhodes.
[2:33:36.720 --> 2:33:37.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:33:37.720 --> 2:33:38.720]  It's the Battle for the Republic 2020.
[2:33:38.720 --> 2:33:49.720]  It's on record, it's not disputed, it was rolled out more than eight months ago in
[2:33:49.720 --> 2:34:17.720]  the United States.
[2:34:17.720 --> 2:34:46.720]  It's on record, it's on record.
[2:34:46.720 --> 2:35:15.720]  It's on record, it's on record.
[2:35:15.720 --> 2:35:44.720]  It's on record, it's on record.
