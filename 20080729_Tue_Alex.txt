[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:22.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:28.000]  Very important broadcast lined up for you on this July 29th, 2008 worldwide broadcast
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  against tyranny in defense of liberty.
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  Steve Watson is joining us in 30 minutes.
[00:39.000 --> 00:45.000]  British kids encourage to become climate cops and to quote, report on their parents.
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  It is now also being set up here in the United States.
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.000]  We have incredible video that the New York Times is reporting on where a police officer runs
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  15 feet at least, full power, knocks a cyclist off, who busted his head open on the concrete
[01:03.000 --> 01:11.000]  and was in serious condition, and the police charged the cyclist for assaulting the officer.
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  The video is on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  This is the evil.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  This is the wickedness of the government, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19.000 --> 01:21.000]  Video of the cop.
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.000]  You have hundreds of bicyclers going down the road.
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.000]  He's trying to shove and push other bikes.
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  They're swerving out of his way.
[01:29.000 --> 01:36.000]  He becomes enraged and runs like an NFL linebacker, and full power.
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.000]  Guy had to have played football in high school, hits the cyclist on the side,
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.000]  knocking him with full leverage power, head first, slamming into the curb.
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.000]  What did they do?
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  They booked him.
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  That's how America works, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  You sickos on the message board and the comment areas and commenting on the YouTube
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  that the cyclist deserved it.
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.000]  The IRS is going to take everything you got.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  Your children are going to be drafted to fight it in less wars.
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  You're going to be abused, too.
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  And I want the evil police that are part of this to know something,
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  not the good one, but the bad ones that are backed up by the city halls and the governors and the feds.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  Bad stuff is going to happen to you at the hands of this new world order.
[02:18.000 --> 02:23.000]  The tyranny goes around, ladies and gentlemen, and you think you're going to escape this wickedness,
[02:23.000 --> 02:26.000]  and that isn't bad enough.
[02:26.000 --> 02:34.000]  Headline, here I have in the stack, Missouri police taser injured boy 19 times.
[02:34.000 --> 02:42.000]  The Tattletale Society, the young man was 16-year-old, no criminal record.
[02:42.000 --> 02:53.000]  His blood, no drugs, walking home after his late night job over a highway overpass.
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  Someone said it was suspicious to have someone walking down the highway.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  This was in the Ozarks.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  And then the next we hear, he's fallen off the bridge.
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  This is what the police are saying, but they won't release the squad car video.
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.000]  His back is broken.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  It knocked his foot off.
[03:09.000 --> 03:19.000]  He is bleeding and broke back.
[03:19.000 --> 03:20.000]  He has a broken back.
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  He is paralyzed from the neck down.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  The police then pound him in the face because he wouldn't get up, double black eyes,
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  and then taser him 19 times for not getting up.
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  Oh, yes, we have the local newscast where they don't even report that till the end.
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.000]  It's kind of like, oh, he fell and broke his back and then got, by the way, taser 19 times.
[03:43.000 --> 03:55.000]  This is the savage evil of hardcore felons and criminals and thugs joining the police force and being chosen for this.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  It is off the charts evil.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  The video that's up on PrisonPlanet.com of this happening.
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  In fact, it was posted on the main page yesterday. It's already rotated into the police state archive.
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  I want to get that posted back on the main page of prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  Just absolutely incredible.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  And we get videos like this now every day.
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.000]  You'll have skateboarders in San Diego, just happily skateboarding peacefully,
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  and a cop just pulls up and runs up screaming, tackling them and hitting them and stealing their skateboards and laughing.
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.000]  Video of children playing with toy cars. Cops come up and just go, ah, stomp them.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  You couldn't make this up.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  Savage evil exploding everywhere.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  Massive death camps are built.
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  The government's hired their death force. They're moving against us now.
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  They're Pentagon control grids in place.
[04:53.000 --> 05:00.000]  And they've been told they can have their way with us and let the slaves know that they're nothing but pathetic slaves.
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.000]  Now from the makers of Loose Change.
[05:03.000 --> 05:09.000]  The most downloaded film in internet history comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut,
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.

[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,

[06:58.000 --> 07:01.000]  The world's best air purifiers.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients,
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  most of which are synthetic.
[07:11.000 --> 07:12.000]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calvin pure soaps?

[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  Marty Schachter founded Calvin's Soap Company in 1947
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  and provided products for health institutions.
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  Now, Calvin soaps are available to you and me.

[08:00.000 --> 08:06.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones show
[08:06.000 --> 08:22.000]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  You know what makes me angry?
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  But more than making me angry makes me sad for this country.
[08:29.000 --> 08:36.000]  We now have institutionalized corruption in the United States.
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  We've always had problems, there's always been bad apples in government,
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  but when it becomes institutionalized, you have tyranny.
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  And that's exactly what we've gotten nationwide,
[08:47.000 --> 08:53.000]  is a corruption that is nothing like we've ever seen in our history.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  We've had cities like New York that have gone bad with big city.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  We've had mob bosses basically running the city.
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  We've had Chicago do the same for a long, long time.
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  But now it's most small towns.
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  Now it's almost every major city.
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  Some are better than others.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  Some are worse than others.
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  Austin, Texas, despite the massive violations of the Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[09:18.000 --> 09:25.000]  is nothing compared to many other cities that we've tracked and analyzed and assessed.
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  And so I'm very blessed to live in this city as bad as it is.
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  New York City and Chicago are unbelievably corrupt.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  The police swagger, like something out of Clockwork Orange,
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.000]  openly screaming at the citizenry like there's scum and trash.
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  They are encouraged to let the population know that it is the same in Washington, D.C.
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  to personally experience that versus the police being very professional,
[09:55.000 --> 10:03.000]  say, in Chantilly, Virginia, or what is Fairfax, Virginia, at Bilderberg.
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.000]  And I would love to praise the police.
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  I would love to hold up good officers because when they do an honorable job as peace officers,
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  and when they have courage and are brave and polite and upright,
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  and gentlemenly, they're real men and women and are to be respected.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  But when they become tools of corrupt systems, whether federal, state, or local,
[10:25.000 --> 10:33.000]  they are the greatest threat to our individual lives, liberty, property, and our country's name.
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  And for the last two decades, they've had shows like COPS,
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  where they always show the public as white trash scum,
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  all they ever show you is the guilty people, the drunks, the trash,
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  and the police are always shown in a good light.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  And so that created a type of mindless brainwashing of the police and the public,
[10:53.000 --> 11:00.000]  the police themselves, a haughty attitude that they could do no wrong and could behave however they wished.
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.000]  Now, because of internet videos, that is all changing, ladies and gentlemen,
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.000]  institutionalized frameups and corruption and persecution of innocent citizens
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  is now becoming evident to the world.
[11:16.000 --> 11:23.000]  When a young man asks a question, lines up to ask a question in Florida,
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.000]  and asks his question, the security guards believe in America that you're not supposed to ask questions.
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  Then the college police get there and grab them around the neck,
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  even though Kerry was saying, let him finish his question.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  He came to the microphone, they drug him out, and on video he put his hands out
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  with three people sitting on top of him and looked up, looked at his head and said,
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.000]  don't taser me, bro, as the officer pulled out the taser, relish the moment, and then taser him.
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  There's the famous video in San Diego there at the State College,
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  where they come into the library, he doesn't have his ID, he tells them I don't have an ID,
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  he was a straight A student there, what a junior,
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  and then we interviewed him, that was a year and a half ago now, these are just some of the famous cases,
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  and he says, show me your ID, and he says, I don't have one,
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  and the guy pulls the taser out and says, you will show it to me, you will comply,
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  it uses a torture device, paying compliance, and he said, look, I'm leaving,
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  and the officers started tazering him and tazered him eight times in the back,
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.000]  and then would say, get up, only five seconds after each taser, which was impossible,
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  and the tazering went on, and on, and on, and on, and on.
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  There's many famous cases of where, on video from the jails,
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  where you've got a drunk in there,
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  and the officer says, stand on the line, and the guy stands on the line and then sits back down,
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  and he says, stand on the line again, and the guy says, look, I don't want to,
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  so the officer comes over and starts choking him out up against the wall,
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  and the guy's just begging, not even putting his hands up, because if he touched the jail guard's hands,
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  he'd have been probably killed.
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  That's a little game in there, hung in the cell, as they say, is what normally happens,
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  and the guy just says, come on, man, come on, that hurt.
[13:12.000 --> 13:18.000]  So the officer then tasers him, the guy begs and pleads, and then crawls and gets up and submits,
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  and the officer then starts gyrating with his hips, you can see him having a little pleasure event.
[13:23.000 --> 13:31.000]  There's now the famous case on NBC News of the TSA thumping their chest like King Kong going,
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.000]  we have power, we have power, we have power as they beat up a Korean war vet,
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  or a woman saying, why are you yelling at me just politely, so they just grab her and slam her up against the wall
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  and start pumbling her, or jumping on people's heads with full force, breaking their necks in Canada,
[13:48.000 --> 13:55.000]  or, quote, TSA taking people behind closed doors who then kill themselves with handcuffs behind their back by choking themselves.
[13:55.000 --> 13:56.000]  Yeah, right.
[13:56.000 --> 14:03.000]  No, you jump on people's heads, and they're vertebrate snap, you kill them.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  You know, I found this out the hard way a few times when people started fights with me,
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  and it was always in a fight where things were going bad for me,
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  and so I had to really turn on the good old boy guts, and you know, you punch somebody right,
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  they go into a coma for a few months, and you get sued, even if they started the fight with you and you have witnesses,
[14:20.000 --> 14:27.000]  you got to go to court and defeat those charges and call in the witnesses as I had to do when I was a teenager.
[14:27.000 --> 14:33.000]  You pop somebody up the head, they'll die a lot of times, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  You go swing into somebody's face, you'll tear their nose right off their face.
[14:38.000 --> 14:45.000]  You know, cops, a lot of you joined us to have power and be on power trips, but you grew up watching WWF wrestling,
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  and you think you can jump on people's heads and they're going to get back up.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  That's not how the real world works, officers.
[14:52.000 --> 15:02.000]  So stop using excess force, stop killing us and breaking our necks.
[15:02.000 --> 15:11.000]  Now, the video I've got is so incredible of this young man, his neck is broken, his eyes are black,
[15:11.000 --> 15:21.000]  he's got a cut on his head, half of his foot literally broke off of his body, compound fracture was so bad,
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  we're going to get his family on, and the tattletail eyewitnesses, this happens everywhere.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  You walk around in broad daylight in Austin now, the cops will pull up and ask you what you're doing, because everything's al-Qaeda,
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  unless it's an illegal alien, they're selectively left alone.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  They can drunk drive, not have IDs, that's admitted.
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.000]  I've had awesome police admit it to my face, there's been all of the news where sheriffs do their job and arrest van loads of illegals
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  and are ordered to release them by their mayors, by the judges.
[15:47.000 --> 15:55.000]  So I don't want to hear it, all this massive zero tolerance in our face policing constantly.
[15:55.000 --> 16:03.000]  And then you say, oh, that's to keep you safe from al-Qaeda, while 30 million illegal aliens can run around and go to post offices
[16:03.000 --> 16:09.000]  and pull down American flags and burn them and stomp on them, and if citizens try to run the flags back up, they're arrested.
[16:09.000 --> 16:18.000]  I got video in, in game in the extras, where this guy, there's thousands of illegals blocking the highway in an unpermitted demonstration,
[16:18.000 --> 16:25.000]  which citizens can't have, and the guy is screaming back at him, so the cops come over, pull him out, bust his head open on the ground
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  and let the illegals taunt and yell at him and laugh at him.
[16:28.000 --> 16:35.000]  That's what America is, ladies and gentlemen, that's who we are.
[16:35.000 --> 16:45.000]  And I want to come back from break and play this newscast, Missouri police taser injured boy 19 times, KY3 news.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  This is in the Ozark, Missouri mountains, right on the Arkansas border.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  He was tasered 19 times.
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.000]  Police admit this, but won't release the squad car video.
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  Now, a tattletale citizen said they were worried about the 16-year-old.
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  Why was he out late at night?
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  Well, he was walking home from work.
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  How dare some people be hardworking in America?
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  And so he's, he's walking home.
[17:07.000 --> 17:08.000]  We have several reports on this.
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  You can go read them all and get all the details.
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  And he's walking home.
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  He's done nothing wrong.
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.000]  He's clean cut.
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  They tested his blood, hoping they could say he was on drugs.
[17:17.000 --> 17:18.000]  No alcohol, no drugs.
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  Just a hard work in America that doesn't exist anymore.
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  Okay, gotta be eradicated.
[17:23.000 --> 17:29.000]  And then suddenly they call 911 and then next they see he is thrown off the bridge.
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.000]  Cops won't release the squad car video.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  Must have smarted off.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  And then at the bottom of the bridge, I guess they wanted to cover up what they'd done,
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  he's tasered with a broken neck.
[17:41.000 --> 17:44.000]  The media's saying back, it's neck.
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  It's broken into shoulder blades.
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  So he's paralyzed from the top of the shoulders down.
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  His foot is bleeding everywhere, knocked part of his foot off.
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  The bone's sticking out.
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  Falls off a huge bridge.
[17:58.000 --> 17:59.000]  You can see video of it.
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  It was about 40 feet, 35, 40 feet on a concrete.
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  And then the cops spit and say, we felt threatened by him.
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  We felt like, and he was saying, I want to kill cops.
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  He's totally made up.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  Release the squad car video scum.
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  I bet you've already erased it, haven't you?
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  Doesn't matter. The town now knows.
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.000]  What just happened because someone called 911 on him,
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  you don't walk down the road during the day much less at night, folks.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  You don't do that in America.
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  You go home and you turn the TV on and you shut up.
[18:33.000 --> 18:38.000]  And if you go in your backyard, the neighbor's going to be up against the fence listening to you.
[18:38.000 --> 18:45.000]  They train every junior high school student in America to spy on your parents.
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  I have video of the police training them in road to tyranny.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  I have a new information.
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.000]  I have the handouts today that school children are being taught that says,
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  let me give you the exact quote.
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  Let me find it here.
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  Train to become a climate cop.
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  And I couldn't believe it.
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  I went to the website and it says here,
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  keep your parents in line.
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  Stop them from climate crimes.
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.000]  There's a particular quote in here that's just unbelievable, disgusting,
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  where it says, you know, you're in charge of your parents now.
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  I mean, this is classic tyranny.
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.000]  And then I have other articles. Look at this.
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  Here in my stack.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  Moles wanted.
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  This is out of the city pages.
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  This is in Denver.
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.000]  It says in preparation.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  And there's also another one here out of they also want them for Minnesota.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  And it just says moles wanted moles everywhere.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  Everyone spy everyone.
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  It's just totally evil.
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  Meanwhile, 30 million people are above the law.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[19:54.000 --> 20:00.000]  Yeah.
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  And I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.000]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor,
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  I have run across a company called SFR,
[20:11.000 --> 20:14.000]  who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[20:14.000 --> 20:18.000]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system,
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.000]  protect a complete fuel system treatment,
[20:20.000 --> 20:25.000]  cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage, and only one tank full.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction,
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  but it extends the life of your engine.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  Let's face it.
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95,
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.000]  and receive a free engine treatment, which is a $12.95 value free.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  Call triple eight, use SFR one.
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  That number again is triple eight, use SFR one,
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[20:54.000 --> 20:57.000]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back,
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  and it's safe for all cars. Act now.
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  9-11 was an inside job.
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.000]  You like being a puppet, sir?
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  You like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  a global awakening has taken place.
[21:27.000 --> 21:32.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  Well, hell is it.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  I don't know.
[21:39.000 --> 21:44.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  Well, hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  Please rise.

[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[22:01.000 --> 22:04.000]  Ted Anderson from Midas, July 28, 2008,
[22:04.000 --> 22:10.000]  gold 9, 29, 40 ounce gold coins could be purchased for 9, 56, 15, 4, 70, 90 for half,
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  2, 35, 45 for quarter.
[22:12.000 --> 22:17.000]  That's 9, 56, 15, 4, 70, 90, and 2, 30, 45.
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  Hedge fund is cut in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  The bond market continues to slump.
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.000]  J.P. Morgan gets caught in a 10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  Mortgage giant countrywide told mortgage payment was
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  spreading to the middle and upper class. Investors cast out on investment banks.
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  The U.S. dollar is free falling against foreign currencies,
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  and countries that previously financed the U.S. are now seeking safer alternatives.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  Economist Rody Boyd published the report,
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  Bubble Leaking, call for the report today,
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  800-686-2237.
[22:51.000 --> 22:54.000]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  That's 800-686-2237.

[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  Call today.
[24:07.000 --> 24:11.000]  At the end of the show today, I am going to go ahead and announce
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  whether we're having the Willie Nelson concert or not early,
[24:15.000 --> 24:22.000]  because he just contacted us during the break.
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.000]  So we'll go ahead and announce that later.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  Got all the thugs and all the punks that want to beat up and kill innocent people.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  We're watching you.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  You know, before I get back into this young man,
[24:46.000 --> 24:49.000]  falling mysteriously off the bridge after police were called,
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  being tasered 19 times with a broken back from the shoulders down,
[24:55.000 --> 25:00.000]  and, quote, part of his foot off from hitting the ground.
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  I want to cover this first.
[25:04.000 --> 25:12.000]  Now, the bicyclist and critical mass were peacefully riding down a New York street,
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  and the cop is running around trying to knock them off their bicycles,
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  and they're dodging going around him, so he throws a fit, sees another one coming,
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  runs 15, 20 feet.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  You can watch the video at prisonplanet.com.
[25:25.000 --> 25:32.000]  And with full force, like a NFL blocker,
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  hits him with open palms in the shoulder,
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  leveraging with full power off the bike and the bicyclist's head slams in to the ground.
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  After he got out of the hospital, he was charged,
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  and that's in the New York Times, and then something happened.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  The video was released.
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  In fact, multiple videos from multiple angles with tourists.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  And now the cop is in trouble.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  He's had his badge and gun taken.
[25:58.000 --> 26:07.000]  He needs to be criminally charged for filing a false report and attempted murder.
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  Officer investigated and toppling of cyclist New York Times today,
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  a New York City police officer we posted this yesterday, was stripped of his gun and badge on Monday
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  after an amateur video service on the Internet showing him pushing a bicyclist to the ground
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  in Times Square as a group ride on Friday evening.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  The cyclist identified in court papers.
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  Christopher Long, 29.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  You know, they wouldn't have charged this guy.
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  It would never even have come out, but then it became an issue because it was in court papers.
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  He'd been charged so they could find out the name and the officer.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  The officer hung himself.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  That's what I'm tired of. Cops beating people up.
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.000]  I've seen so many videos here in Austin of it where they'll just beat people up and then charge them.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  It's not enough. You knock our teeth out if we smart offer.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  You feel like it or your wife was mad at you that day.
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  She got a chip on your shoulder.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  I mean, you want to be a tough guy.
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  Go take kickboxing. Go take boxing.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  I mean, there's some mean gyms in every city.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  Go take jiu-jitsu.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  There's some people who want to fight with you in the ring.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  You know, I think of myself as a tough guy,
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  but you don't see me going and trying to join these clubs.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  I got friends that do and they're constantly got bones broken.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  Their eyes are completely bloody.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  I mean, you really want to be a tough guy.
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  Why don't you go fight tough people instead of almost killing 16-year-old kids
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  and knocking cyclists off their bikes?
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  I mean, if you're so tough,
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  me, I'm not that tough.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  I don't want to go fight real men and I know this.
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.000]  I sure don't want to go beat up kids.
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  The cyclist identified in court papers as Christopher Long, 29,
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.000]  was taking part in a monthly ride called Critical Mass,
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  that often draws hundreds of riders
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  in a criminal complaint against Mr. Long.
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  The officer identified in court documents as Patrick Pogan
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  of the Middleton South Precinct
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  said that his cyclist rode straight at him.
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  But the video posted on YouTube on the blog,
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  Gothmist, shows the officer lunging towards Mr. Long.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  It shows him running
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  and then lunging because the bicycler tries to go around him
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  and then he knocks him down.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  The police officer said,
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  the police said the officer had been assigned a death suit
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  depending on police department investigation.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  The police did not give the officer's name or age
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.000]  or say how long he had been with the department.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  Now we've got all these YouTube videos.
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  The cops will be beating somebody up and they'll be somebody 100 yards away.
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  They'll run across the street and physically attack them.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  The monthly rides have been the sorts of tension for police
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  shortly before the Republican National Convention in 2004.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  We got video in martial law of the police
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  running over people with motorcycles.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  They would just run into crowds of people with motorcycles
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  and then charge them for being run over by motorcycles.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  And there's all the instances where they torture people
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.000]  with toilet plungers for two hours.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  I mean, you know how sick of that is?
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  The police that blew the whistle on the guy said
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  that he was their commander ordered them to hold him down
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  and he argued and said for two hours
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.000]  raping him with a plunger with blood pouring everywhere.
[29:05.000 --> 29:08.000]  The guy had holes in his guts.
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.000]  A broken plunger two and a half feet long
[29:11.000 --> 29:14.000]  for two plus hours.
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  Can you imagine having that much evil will to sit there?
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  I'm sorry to talk about these type issues,
[29:19.000 --> 29:22.000]  raping someone with a broken-ended wooden plunger
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  for over two hours?
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  It said for two hours the commander just sat there
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  cramming a bloody plunger into the guy
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.000]  because he smarted off to him.
[29:34.000 --> 29:38.000]  Two hours! You know how long that is?
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  Two hours!
[29:40.000 --> 29:45.000]  That is incredible dark force.
[29:45.000 --> 29:48.000]  To be able to keep that up,
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.000]  we'll be right back.
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  We're on the march.
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:55.000 --> 29:58.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[30:03.000 --> 30:06.000]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide,
[30:06.000 --> 30:09.000]  but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[30:14.000 --> 30:18.000]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[30:18.000 --> 30:22.000]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[33:04.000 --> 33:07.000]  Steve Watson joins us in about five minutes.
[33:07.000 --> 33:11.000]  The whole point of this latest officer investigated
[33:11.000 --> 33:13.000]  in toppling of cyclists.
[33:22.000 --> 33:25.000]  It turns out that this was even part
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.000]  of a permitted protest bike ride, Topstone Care.
[33:32.000 --> 33:35.000]  Just like you'll see in Truth Rising,
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  you got Luke Redalski
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.000]  and others out there
[33:43.000 --> 33:47.000]  peacefully standing in front of Larry Silverstein's property
[33:47.000 --> 33:50.000]  across the street on a city sidewalk with a sign.
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.000]  Him and Tom Foting, really brave guys.
[33:53.000 --> 33:56.000]  And they are there and the police
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  men didn't have to hang themselves as police.
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  Turn out they're retired New York police
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  that work for Silverstein. Come over and say,
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  we are going to say you have bombs,
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  and Luke goes, I don't have bombs, and they go,
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  we know you're not a terrorist, but we're going to say you are
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  and you're going to get 30 days in the hole
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  while that's being figured out. That's a quote.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  Then the cops show up and say, grab his camera,
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  but luckily we had a camera down the street and say,
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  and it's on video of them grabbing the camera and say,
[34:19.000 --> 34:22.000]  oh look, he's got a gun, armed and dangerous.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  He was threatening me with a gun.
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  Then the police turn the camera off and they say, listen,
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  we're going to take you to jail for having a gun
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  if you don't leave, and they said, yes sir,
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  we are out of here.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  Now, what's incredible about this from a criminology
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  and psychology view is that police
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  think it's so normal and that they're so protected
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  in New York City, I'm not saying they're this bad everywhere,
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  that uniform police will say that
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  video cameras are guns and say,
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.000]  we're going to put you in jail for a gun if you don't leave.
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  This is all on tape.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  This is what America has turned.
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  I mean, it's one thing, there were always bad cops
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  who would do things like this, but to do it on video.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  And now in this case of the cyclist,
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  the cop runs 15 feet at least.
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  He runs from one side of the street to the other.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  The cyclist starts swerving to get away,
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  obviously trying to get around him,
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  and the cop knocks him down, then charges him.
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  He's charged after he gets out of the hospital.
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  With being assaulted and the police
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  and all the other cops that are on the scene
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  go along with that false charging.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  And it's the same thing with Mr. German when we are changed.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  The police try to block the cameras
[35:42.000 --> 35:45.000]  being released by the local businesses.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  Somebody runs over and assaults him,
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  and then the New York Post reports,
[35:49.000 --> 35:53.000]  oh no, we are changed, assaulted a girl in a wheelchair.
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.000]  Total lie.
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  This is how they operate.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  And they could have just as well said he had a bomb
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  and Luke would be in prison right now.
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  It would be on the news, American Al Qaeda,
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  Luke Radowski by the grace of God, they got out of there,
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  and there would be all the neoconsights and newspapers saying,
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  send him to Guantanamo Bay.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  Don't give him a trial, execute him.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  He tried to bomb the new building 7.
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.000]  He's a terrorist.
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.000]  I mean, when you see video of them assault somebody,
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  go out of their way, go running across the street
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  to knock somebody's head into the concrete and blood splatter,
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  and then that's not enough for them.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  It's not enough to split somebody's head open.
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  It's not enough to break somebody's back.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  It's not enough to taser them 19 times.
[36:39.000 --> 36:46.000]  It's not enough.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  I'll never forget who was the man.
[36:48.000 --> 36:53.000]  I interviewed him.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  Big band, big mixed band.
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  It's like a Spanish band here in town.
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[36:58.000 --> 37:05.000]  They were downtown, packed show,
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  and the police come in and say this place is too full
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  so people start leaving as they're told.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  And on videotape, the police just start beating
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  and attacking the band with billy clubs.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  And then the police on the news say they assaulted us
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  and all these different videos get released.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  Everybody thought I was there and shot the video
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  because a statesman videographer, you know,
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  newspapers now do videos two years ago,
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  named Alex Jones,
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  was also a prominent, award-winning photographer.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  He says he likes the show, but man, he's sick of me,
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  because he says everybody thinks he's Alex Jones.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  They'll be at this Alex Jones.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  But he got some professional video from the start.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  They come out, they got their hands out.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  What's wrong, officer? Wham!
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  And then you charge them?
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  What was that band?
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  I can't remember. It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  But let's go ahead and play this clip out of Arkansas.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  Now, listen to how it's whitewashed.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  They just call me a reporter.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  We fell over a bridge, broke his back.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  Then later in other reports, they admit in newspapers,
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  oh, well, the cops were called and saw him on the bridge,
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  but they won't say how he fell off
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  or won't release the squad car video.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  And then he's on the ground with a broken back
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  and his foot knocked off,
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  and they tazer him 19 times.
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  Now, police chief comes out and gives this line a bull.
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  Here it is.
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  Good evening, and thanks for joining us. I'm Steve Grant.
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  And I'm Lisa Rose, an Ozarks family
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  once answers about what happened to their son
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  that left him hospitalized.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  Early Saturday morning, police found 16-year-old
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  Mace Hutchinson underneath the 65
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  and Highway F overpass in Ozark.
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  KY3's Sarah Sheffield joined us live
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  to explain why the teenager's parents
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  believe what police did put him in intensive care.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  This is a story that you'll only see here on KY3.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  Sarah?
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  According to the teen's family,
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  they believe that Mace Hutchinson somehow
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  went from walking along this bridge
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  to 30 feet below lying on the pavement
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  severely injured.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  Like I said, we called the police.
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  My wife was afraid he was going to get run over
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  or hit.
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  Doug Mezzersmith and his wife were the last known people
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  to see 16-year-old Mace Hutchinson walking
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  shortly before their phone call to 911.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  He looked a little agitated,
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  but other than that, he didn't look to be
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  falling down drunk or anything like that.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  By the time officers arrived,
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  the teen was off the overpass,
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  lying on the shoulder below along Highway 65
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  with no good explanation
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  as to how he got there.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  According to the doctors, all injuries are consistent
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  with the fall.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  And Mace's dad, Don Hutchinson, believes it was just that.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  A fall, not a jump.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  The question is why.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  They tested his system.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  He was clean of drugs and alcohol,
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  so we don't know why unless just
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  being in shock and the whole thing
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  caused him to forget everything.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  Mace's aunt tells us he's undergoing major surgery
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  for a broken back and a broke-off
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  heel.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  But while he was lying on the ground,
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  she wonders why Ozark police tased him
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  up to 19 times.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  I'm not an officer, but I don't see the reason
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  for tasing.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  Some made it slay and they're broken back.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  I don't consider that a threat.
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  His dad says the tasing delayed what would have been
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  immediate surgery by two days.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  The tazering has increased
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  and the blood cell count
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  caused him to have a temperature
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  so they could not go into operation.
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  He refused to comply
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  with the officers and so the officers
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  had to deploy their tasers
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  in order to subdue him.
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  He's making incoherent statements.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  He's also making
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  statements such as shoot cops,
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  kill cops,
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  things like that.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  So there was cause
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  for concern to the officers.
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  Although there are several unanswered questions,
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  the use of a stun gun
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  is not one of them.
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  So it was a big concern for the
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  officers to keep this guy out of traffic
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  to keep him from getting hurt.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  Mace is still in intensive care
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  tonight. Listed in fair condition.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  He has surgery again tomorrow.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  The family along with the Ozark police
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  department is hoping someone will see the
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  story and come forward with some information.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  You can call 417-699-4789
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  with information
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  or call the Ozark police department.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  It's a case we'll be watching.
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  Sarah Sheffield live tonight.
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  Let's see those
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  dash cam tapes. I hope the family
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  is smart enough to immediately subpoena those
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  and when they're erased,
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  which 90% chance they will be,
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  we will know exactly what happened.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  I would bet
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  if he didn't jump himself, which is doubtful,
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  these are former Iraqi vets
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  completely out of their minds.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  Probably serve 3-4 tours a piece.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  It's a sport in Iraq.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  Throw small children off of bridges.
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  That's been all over the nose.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  God help us. Just God help this country.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  We're going to try to get the family on.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  They need to be guarding him
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  in intensive care.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  Because if he was indeed thrown off,
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  they need to 24 hours a day
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  be guarding him
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  and look at everything he's injected with.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  24 hours a day
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  they need to guard him.
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  Because again, he's unable to talk
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  at this time.
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  He needs to be guarded
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  right now.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  I'm fighting as hard as I can
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  to get a hold of the family. I don't think they have
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  any idea what they're facing.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  And they need to move out of that town
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  as soon as he's better.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  Because he will never be safe if he survives
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  in that town.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  Just like the guy that got attacked
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  and knocked off his bicycle, having his head split open
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  got charged. And the cop lied
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  and said the guy tried to run him over
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  and tries to run around him and the cop runs
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  15 feet and knocks him off.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  You got to leave. You got to leave the town.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  Your life in Ozark
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  is over.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  You may even have
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  aggravated felons hired on that department.
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  Mainstream news, they're hiring them everywhere.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  They're hiring foreigners
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  for the military and aggravated felons.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  I want to shift gears for the rest of the hour
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  with Steve Watson.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  This story is yesterday's top news on infoawards.net
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  It's also on prisonplanet.com
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  This came out last night.
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  Big story.
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  Do you think I get up on the air
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  and say that they're going to have youth brigades?
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  Because I just grabbed that out of the sky.
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  I just made that up.
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  Everything I say ends up happening.
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  People don't know why.
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  Because you don't go to sports documents.
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  My 1999 produced film
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  Police State 2000 says
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  there will be youth brigades
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  with large sectors of each high school
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  trained in junior high
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  with M16s in grey uniforms
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  running checkpoints in America.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  Three years later
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  in 2002
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  it was reported by the Philadelphia Daily News
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.000]  and other major newspapers
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  they're training junior high
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  and high school students with M16s
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  in warrants service
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  in house clearing
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  in fugitive apprehension.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  Those are exact quotes from the news articles.
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  It's called Secure Corps
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  set up by Bill Clinton
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  radically expanded by George Bush
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  they're converting in Chicago
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  in Detroit, in Los Angeles
[43:56.000 --> 43:58.000]  and other major cities
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  large intercity schools
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  to quote military
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  schools
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  they are converting them
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  into hardcore
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  Eugen
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  of course people think that it was just Wrangel
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  who just announced this a few years ago
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  with the national civilian
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  about it for me
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  it's called the National Compulsory Service Act
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  there you go
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  18-49 you're all going to have to serve
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  upwards of 10 hours a week as federal slaves
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  tabling, spying, checkpoints
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  they're phasing this in
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  I just gave you the name of the bill
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  it's been reintroduced this session
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  the National Compulsory Service Act
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  now they're going to have
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  10 million
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  youth police
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  they're going to be called
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  environmental
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  community officers
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  and they're going to be Eugen
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  starting at age 12
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  Al Gore has announced this
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  so you're going to have 10 million
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  in viral cops
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  more than 10 million auxiliary
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  community police
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  these young people are going to love power
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  and it's all happening
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  now it's also being announced in England
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  and Steve Watson happened to see this in the newspaper
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  went to the major website
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  and couldn't believe it
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  I'm going to send off for the CD-ROM
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  they have a CD-ROM training video
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  for this in fact you're in England Steve
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  you should probably order that today before they clamp down on this
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  so we actually have the video of the training
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  Steve Watson incredible story
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  British kids encouraged to become climate cops
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  full page adverts in weekend newspapers
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  ask kids to rat on their friends and family
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  in order to prevent climate crimes
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  and it says report on your parents
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  Steve this is amazing
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  yeah I couldn't believe it myself
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  basically the ads were run
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  by a
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  leading British energy company called N Power
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  which is one of the biggest
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  in the country
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  and basically they've set up
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  this micro site
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  aimed at children
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  oh by the way the children
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  are in uniforms
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  red and khaki uniforms
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  I mean over here it's going to be grey uniforms
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  according to the original federal plans
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  in England you're going to be facing red uniforms
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  go ahead and utility belts
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  looks like with tasers
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  yeah the whole website
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  is laid out in that fashion
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  in those colors
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  which somebody quite usefully pointed out
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  are the black, red and white
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  are exactly the same colors that the Nazis used
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  anyway
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  that's right the badges are red, black and white
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  yeah I feel mean if you just look
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  with a thunderbolt
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  with an SS thunderbolt
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  exactly it
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  yeah it's run by N Power
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  basically they ran full page color
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  adverts in
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  many of the weekend newspapers over here
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  encouraging children to
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  basically sign up to this website
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  to become climate cops
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  and
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  and report and keep
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  crime, climate crime
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  case files
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  on their families and friends
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  now it says that you're not
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  you can't believe this
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  it's directly from them
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  okay this is exactly what it says on the website
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  use your skills of investigation
[47:12.000 --> 47:14.000]  to help the climate cops
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  cut down on the climate crimes that are taking place
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  in your home
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  download the climate
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  crime cards and use them to
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  search your home
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  to make sure that none are happening under your own roof
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  then build your climate crime case
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  file and report back to your family
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  to make sure they don't commit those crimes again
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  or else
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  oh my god you may need to keep
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  a watchful eye over them
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  by revisiting the case
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  every week or two
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  to make sure they don't slip back into any of their old habits
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  oh that's right out of 1984
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  let me stop you
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  now once they're training climate taddling
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  it's going to immediately be rolled over
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  it's already happened here and in England
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  it will immediately be rolled over into
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  fighting crime looking in the medicine cabinet
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  go ahead
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  he referred to as crime it's climate crime
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  and
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  I'll just carry on reading what it says
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  it says you can spread your search
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  even wider by adding even more case files
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  to your notes
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  what about the homes of your uncles and
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  friends from school
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  and then it's got all these things
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  that the kids can download which highlight
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  specific climate crimes
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  including
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  the use of a tumble dryer
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  um
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  leaving doors open
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  in your house
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  on a you know on a
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  cool day
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  things like this are
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  obviously completely evil
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  not using energy saving light bulbs
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  which require
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  as we've reported before
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  require total refit throughout
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  the whole house
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  and basically don't save as much energy because
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  they require being on all the time
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  in order to be efficient
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  and like you said it's
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  and they're filled with mercury and lead
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  and they say call a hazmat team of one breaks
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  yeah
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  I think the EU banned
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  the materials that actually used in them
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  but like you said it's
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  again using 1984
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  by George Orwell as the
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  instruction manual because
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  in that book
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  children are encouraged by authorities
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  to spy on the
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  families and parents and turn them in
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  if they transgress against the state
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  the minor things
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  you have to teach your children now
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  the state is predatory
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  not to trust
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  government not to trust uniforms
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  explain to them
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  that mommy and daddy are going to go away to a work camp
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  if they ever
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  talk bad about the family
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  period, we're now in the Soviet Union
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  Steve
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  yeah
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  I mean
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  I had a hard time
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  writing this article to be honest because it was
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  really just sickening
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  but
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  you know you can imagine
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  parents having to explain to their children why
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  they haven't
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  spent all their savings on
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  energy saving light bulbs
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  well it puts the children above the parents
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  it's meant to break up the family
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  and remember you just got detained
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  by thought police in London
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  yourself everyone's being
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  stopped by
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  new citizen courts
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  so it isn't like we're just reporting on something
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  it's happened to me in England
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  it's happened to Steve
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  I want to come back and break down more of this
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  unbelievable important
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  story it's happening everywhere
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  they're not going to stop
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  they want labor camps that's in all the executive orders
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  they're going to implode
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  the economies completely
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  have your children reporting on you
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  they're about they're talking
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  about trying to ban more than one child now
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  they're moving against us now
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  do you still think that
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  $4 a gallon at the gas pump is your
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  worst problem in this country
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  bank failures, rising food prices
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  and an ever-weakening dollar are only
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  the beginning of a much larger crisis
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  why have America's politicians
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  abandon the rule of law
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  in favor of the rule of men
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  the majority of this nation's elected officials
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  have become drunk on the power
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  and illusion of authority that only
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  lawless men and women seek
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  they no longer strive to protect American ideals
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  but rather they have abandoned
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  the very rule book that they have sworn an oath
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  to defend will the American people
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  let these crimes go unpunished
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  do the American people even understand
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  the crimes that have been committed
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  where does it stop

[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  I went to grounds here and we knew
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  what to do or at least we thought we did
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  truth rising is a breakthrough
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  on the 9-11 film that finally
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  gives first responders a platform
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  to tell their story
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  Whitman, EVA
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  director on the 18
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  made a statement
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  that the air was safe to breathe
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  this film follows the growing momentum

[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  I'm Alex Jones
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.000]  we're talking to Steve Watson
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  music playing
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  this is classical tyranny you're witnessing
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  I told you this is about taxes
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  all this funny environmentalism
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  it's about diverting you from real environmental issues
[54:49.000 --> 54:52.000]  onto secret police taxes total control
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  they get you dependent
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  on fossil fuels they keep you from getting alternatives
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  and then now they start squeezing you
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  and if they can make marijuana illegal
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  and swat team you for it
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  why not make the wrong kind of washing machine illegal
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  and swat team you for it
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  and you will see that
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  people are already being arrested for growing aloe vera
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  it isn't illegal the police don't care
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  we are entering the vortex of evil
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  you understand Steve Watson please continue sir
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  I am climate change really
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  it's a really good way for them to do this kind of thing
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.000]  because it's easy to
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  you know
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  class people are second class citizens
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  if they don't submit to the
[55:34.000 --> 55:38.000]  sort of consensus on the climate change
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  and we've seen it
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  we've seen many examples of it
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  there was an article a week ago
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  or a couple of weeks ago where
[55:46.000 --> 55:52.000]  SUV drivers were made to park at the back of stores
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  in a sort of 1950 style segregation
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  no that's in Austin
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  they saw this depot in other stores
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  and they have little environmentalists that work there
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  who come out and call tow trucks on you
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  it's just again
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  and by the way you can't park your SUV at zelker
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  every time I'm down there they're slashing tires
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  yeah so it's
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  you know
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  akin to sort of
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  not allowing black people on buses
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  it's the kind of
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  malfusing control of
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  our lifestyles in the name of climate change
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  but
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  it's now
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  we're not only seeing the government doing this
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  we're seeing companies jump on the bandwagon as well
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  so you've got them both
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  in bed together on this sort of
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  attack
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  well if you google this British company
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  it is dominant in the carbon trading
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  agreements so they're going to
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  this is who you're going to pay your taxes to
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  use the private banks and the private companies
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  that's what globalism is
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  is the top 20 corporations
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  and banks are going to become the government
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  well it's always the same isn't it
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  the ones that push in the
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  climate change agenda are the ones that
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  have got so much
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  invested in these carbon credits
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  I mean here's an example
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  TXU is being bought out by a foreign
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  European consortium a head builder
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  guy who's under indictments running it all
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  with Rick Perry they
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  got the law changed where you
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  can't have clean burning coal or good scrubbers
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  and so they do pump out mercury which is
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  deadly I mean actually they hurt
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  the environment it's a sick joke
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  yeah
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  today I posted a
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  a youtube clip of Penn and Teller
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  who break it down quite well
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  and the whole carbon credits scam
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  thing and they got
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  you know they've got fake people going out into
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  parking lot saying how about you offset
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  your carbon footprint
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  by giving me a dollar
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  and they say oh now I'll write you a check for 20 dollars
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  and it's completely fake it's just off
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  and guilt and this is what they're playing on
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  Steve I want to hold you over five minutes and
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  Lindsay Williams is coming back on with his huge news
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  for everybody but
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  explain to people you just got stopped by
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  the secret police in England putting a terror database
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  mm-hmm
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  yeah well I was
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  I was just walking along the street going home
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  waiting for the bus
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  and yeah
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  some police helper came up
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  and accosted me and stopped me
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  because they told me that I put my hand in
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  my pocket in a suspicious way
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  and that's the way it's going
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  and then you were put
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  in a terror database as I was in London

[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  check it out they're already using sound warfare weapons
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  from new york to london
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  to quote keep young people off the street because they quote shouldn't be on the street
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  they should stay indoors
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  i mean we're already under mega laboratory
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  testing i mean they're they're moving out of
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  beta into the main operation
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  right now and i want to explain something
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  i was peacefully in england
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  talking to people on the side of the street and police
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  came over and said i'm putting you in a terror database
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  turn your camera off you don't talk to people
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  on the streets of london
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  i was in moscow 30 years ago
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  uh... that would happen to you
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  beijing they don't even do that to you
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  we are worse than beijing
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  and steve refused to give him his idea
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  for a while that they threatened to attack him
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  and then he gave it to them and they said you are now in a database
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  and it's admitted millions of britains a year
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  putting the database
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  steve watson finish up just your thoughts
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  i remember that day when you were in london
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  we were filming with you that was the day
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  we were in parliament square
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  that was the day before they
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  banned organized protest within
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  a certain distance of parliament square
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  and i remember the cops came over to you
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  and they said
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  i told you to stop filming etc
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  and then i said to them
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  you know what's he doing he's not done anything wrong
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  he hasn't broken any laws
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  it's not illegal to do this is it
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  and they said it will be tomorrow
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  and they said it was such satisfaction
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  it really sent sort of chills up and down my spine
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  and we've seen since then
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  people in that area
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  arrested for
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  reading out the names of
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  dead soldiers from newspapers
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  but it wasn't just there
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  remember in another part of london
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  we were just out by shops
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  and people remember the lady with the oranges
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  it was a vegetable shop a fruit shop
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  and she's the one that says give up your liberty for freedom
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  and then the cops
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  just come over and say turn your camera off
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  you can't videotape in london
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  it was just after the london bombings
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  since then that the visible police presence
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  has declined slightly
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  but the attitude
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  and the mood
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  really hasn't changed at all in fact
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  it's probably got more insidious
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  well it's time for people in england
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  to stop putting up with this
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  and everybody needs to get this for their children
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  and use this article as an example
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  of the state's not your friend
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  the state puts poison in your water and food
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  son daughter
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  all we have is the family
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  children will start behaving better
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  and you know people you do what my dad did
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  when i was growing up he took me to the Salvation Army
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  at christmas to feed people with soup lines
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  to see what getting on drugs
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  or not listening to your parents does
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  people you need to take your children
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  to volunteer at hospitals
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  to volunteer at Salvation Armies and soup kitchens
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  as i did christmas after christmas
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  and many other times
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  and you know take
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  you can also go visit people in government wards
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  automobile accident victims
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  and others
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  and you know that will really get your children straight
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  and let them know the government is your enemy
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  now our founding fathers taught that
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  and all the good old boys i knew
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  are all dead all the old world war two vets
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  and older all they did was sit around
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  talking about the government many of them were in the government
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  so that's what america's about
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  is distrusting and disliking the government
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  greedily guarding your liberty and freedom
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  bottom line steven anything else
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  now that's about it really going back to the climate
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  cops it is
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  it is classic tyranny really
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  because it's turning the
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  traditional role of the family on its head
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  and it's turning the kids into the
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  polices of the parents
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  and anyone will tell you
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  that it's tyranny
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  or even dystopia in literature
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  that that theme is in every single
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  example
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  it is the art type
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  the creme dala creme to the hill
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  the ultimate the penultimate
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  the most hardcore manifestation

[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  of the next level
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  when i learned that the accumulation of acidic waste
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  was the likely cause of my painful joints
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  lack of energy and weight gain
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  i knew i would have to change to a more alkaline diet
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  but it just seems so difficult
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  then a friend suggested
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  i try a jupiter water ionizer from
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  sniderhealth.com
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  and detox my body even before i changed my diet

[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  drinking water

[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  pass them around
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  give them to folks who don't know how long the web
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  and its current form will be there
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  canadian government and others are announcing
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  they plan to start shutting down what is known as web 1
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  and going to the controlled web 2.0 system
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  as we've warned you for years
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  now manifesting
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  so the internet streams restream every day
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  for 20 hours
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  after the 4 hour show ends
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  for the next 20 hours until we're back live
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  20 hours later
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  it restreams back to back
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  at infowars.com
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  prismplanet.com
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  prismplanet.com
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  why we have so many sites
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  because our sites get attacked routinely
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  and sometimes they go down
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  we always have auxiliaries there for you
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  that mirror info wars
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  but also have a lot of their own
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  original content videos
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  articles, documents, audios
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  daily like infowars.net
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  its our third largest site
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  fourth largest is prismplanet.tv
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  then we have truthnews.us
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  johnsreport.com
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  info wars of course
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  is the biggest now
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  it has supplanted prismplanet
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  now
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  I want to go back to
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  lindsay williams because
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  he's been bringing out a so important
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  I rarely have guests in a row but this is important
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  information and people are rightfully
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  very interested and also dr stan
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  monty who has a show
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  weeknights in the afternoon
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  right here on the gc n radio network as well
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  radio liberty.com is his website
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  and I want to
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  give both of them in the floor
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  for the rest of this segment
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  to first recap
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  the incredible information both at the same time
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  you guys mediate between each other
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  um
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  on the basic info
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  of what you said in the past lindsay williams
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  in a nutshell again who you are
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  abbreviated what you've been told
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  and then why this is so important
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  from dr stan monty
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  and then for the balance of the hour
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  at the bottom of the hour in about 20 minutes
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  I want to open the phones up for anybody
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  who wants to call in specifically
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  for issues of energy
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  and the geopolitical ramifications
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  of what mr williams is saying
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  if it is indeed is true
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  is a very credible track record
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  he did tell dr monty
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  six seven weeks before he then publicly
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  broke this news what he said
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  started unfolding some of the announcements
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  and so trust but verify
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  we've already gotten a few green lights verifying
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  what he's saying so we're taking a very close
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  look
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  and a closer look today
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  at this so lindsay williams
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  and dr monty if you're both
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  are hosting the show right now and i don't want to
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  see and hear what you guys
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  have to say but let's do this let's throw it to dr monty
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  and let him conduct the interview
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  for 20 minutes with our guest
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  go ahead dr monty
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  all right fine well
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  lindsay has the important part of the story
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  so lindsay you go ahead and tell the story
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  and the information you want to get out
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  good morning alex and also
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  dr stan and thank you
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  for allowing me the privilege I feel
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  honored to be back here two days
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  straight in a row
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  so yes it all began
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  35 years ago with me
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  I had the privilege by the grace of god
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  and it couldn't have been anything but the
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  prophet of god of literally living
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  with the elite of the world
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  for three years time
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  now I won't go back into that story at all
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  I will come directly up to what happened
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  to me about nine weeks ago now
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  to be exact
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  had the most dawdling phone call
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  I ever had in my life
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  and believe you me
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  when you get a phone call from people
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  such as this status
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  you don't take it lightly
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  and on the other end of the line
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  they said lindsay
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  sorry to have to call you but he said
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  you've stepped over the line you've said too much
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  you're going to have to not say this this this
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  this anymore
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  and he said if you do we're going to do this this this
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  and this those things I will not
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  tell on the air what they were that doesn't matter
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  the important part of all of this
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  is that
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  after I agreed not to
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  talk about a few things and let me say to this point
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  so that you I can't tell you what they told me
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  not to say but I'll put it this way
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  they positively are not going to open up
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  any more oil fields in America
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  the Alaska oil field the one in
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  Montana the one in Utah
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  you are not going to see America
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  as self sufficient on energy
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  it I know that they'll pass
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  this kind of bill through Congress they'll pass
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  that kind of bill through Congress they'll pretend to do
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  this and that
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  and everything else imaginable it's only
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  a charade it's a forefront
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  picture just so that they can make
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  themselves look good but they know all
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  the time they have no intentions in doing
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  this whatsoever so after this gentleman
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  finished with what he had told me I
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  could not say anymore
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  I said okay
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  by the way how's your family doing
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  we've been living since I saw you
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  20-25 years ago
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  he became rather polite and at that
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  point I began to ask him some questions
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  such as
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  what's this energy
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  crisis the oil
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  the price of the gas pump
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  is really affecting the American economy
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  where's it going now I know it's going down
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  a little bit lately I actually
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  expect from what he said that you're
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  going to go back up a little bit and then
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  plummet
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  so don't get your hopes up too much yet
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  but I couldn't guarantee that because
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  he wouldn't give me a date and then he said
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  the one startling thing that I think is
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  the crux of it all he said
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  Chaplain Williams
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  the price of crude oil is going
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  to $50 a barrel that
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  is what you can expect
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  well you can imagine my
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  dismay understand
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  something the year was
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  1984 I was sitting
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  in the living room of my house in
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  Kaseeloff Alaska where I was living at the time
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  and the phone rang on the other
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  end of the line was a man of the same status
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  as this gentleman that I'm talking
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  about they called me a few weeks ago
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  and he said Chaplain
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  the price of crude oil is going from $32
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  a barrel to $10 a barrel
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  now you you think back you'll remember
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  it gold was about $800 an ounce
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  and it plummeted oil plummeted
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  from $32 a barrel to 10
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  and he said would you like
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  people in your audiences for the next few
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  few weeks where you're speaking to think
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  you're a prophet
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  they knew me they knew I was
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  a chaplain I had been with
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  these people on the trans
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  Alaska oil pipeline I lived in the same dorms
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  would they even come to my services
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  and so he knew who I was
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  and he said
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  I said okay what do you mean
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  he said it's going to $10 a barrel
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  I knew what it would do I knew it would decimate
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  the Arab economy that was even back
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  in those days from $32 a barrel
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  to $10 a barrel they didn't make it quite to
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  $10 they made it to $11
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  and if you'll remember that's exactly
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  what happened well this same gentleman
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  should say a similar
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  gentleman they called me on the phone
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  here a few weeks ago said it's going to
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  $50 a barrel they may make it to
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  $55 but it's going to go down there
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  pretty close and so I asked him I said
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  how are you going to do this
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  this was my first intuition to ask
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  it's off the top of my head
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  he said we're going to open up two major oil fields
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  in the world now Dr.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  I'm so glad that you're here today
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  and Alex this is
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  positively a confirmation of the fact
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  that this man was not misleading me
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  and if he wasn't misleading me about
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  these things then he probably
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  is not misleading me about the other things
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  he said either because
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  he said we're going to open up an oil field
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  in Indonesia and one north
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  of Russia and Dr. Stan on
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  Thursday of last week you had me on your
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  program on Friday and it had just
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  come out on Fox News that
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  USGS
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  actually announced
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  this huge oil field
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  north of Russia Dr. Stan is that true
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  that's absolutely true and
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  of course there was 90
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  million 90 billion barrels of oil
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  which is about a third of
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  what they have in Saudi Arabia but
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  there's to be another oil field is what he told you
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  this is what Linda told me
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  of a number of weeks ago
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  seven or eight weeks ago when we talked
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  and he told me exactly what
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  happened and he wasn't going to go public
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  with this but
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  well he's
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  able to go public with it I think it's important
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  that people understand that there are going to be
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  some dramatic changes
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  as far as the oil production
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  the price of oil but we're not going to
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  open up of the
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  the oil fields here in America
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  there are lots of oil fields
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  there's lots of things you could do to become
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  energy self-sufficient and they have
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  no intention of doing that
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  and one reason I believe is because they want
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  to transfer the wealth of this country
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  to other countries for spending
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  at least three hundred
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  billion dollars maybe four hundred billion dollars
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  a year for foreign oil is the
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  greatest part of our trade deficit at present
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  time and of course this is simply
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  a means by which you transfer
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  the wealth of America and the
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  American people to other nations
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  that the people elsewhere in the world and
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  I think this is at least one of the factors
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  but you pick up the story there Lindsay
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  for what we're talking about today
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  is not a conspiracy
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  I just want to stress this because I live with
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  these people I know they
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  literally exist everything that you
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  have heard Alex Jones say
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  everything that you have heard Dr.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  Stan Monty say over the years
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  listening audience I know you
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  haven't had the experiences that
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  I've had and you didn't live with these people as
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  I did because very few people
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  ever had that privilege
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  I consider it a privilege because
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  I could analyze them on their own
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  turf but believe everything
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  you hear Alex Jones say every word
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  of it I know sometimes it sounds
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  outlandish but Alex
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  I've got to impress on your audiences
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  this morning if they positively must
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  believe everything that you're telling
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  them over these years and they've got
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  to listen to your program every day
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  thank you Lindsay because
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  it's the truth these people do exist
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  it is not a conspiracy
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  it is an agenda
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  so now let me go through the other things
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  this man told me very quickly because I know
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  we've got a lot of other material to cover
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  he said we'll open up these two oil fields
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  we will flood the world with crude
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  oil then he said
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  John McCain is our man
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  now I'm just taking a few of the highlights
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  of what this man said in about an hour and 15
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  minute conversation and I was
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  amazed that he would even take that much time
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  with me I don't know what they're going to
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  do just prior to the election
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  but it's under my impression even though
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  he did not tell me what they're going to do
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  he did not say it was going to $50
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  a barrel just before the election
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  he didn't he wouldn't commit himself
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  to that but he did say
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  that I get
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  that with reading between the lines
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  something major will happen
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  so that they can get their man in
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  if they have anywhere about it they will
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  then he said some other things
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  it was all amazing we'll hear that on the other
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  side of this quick break
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  Dr. Monteef and Lindsay Williams
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  will it be an attack on I ran
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  we're going to find out in the next few months
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  this is a key time ladies and gentlemen
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  get the word out about the globalist and the
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  new old orders master plan
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  like you never have because
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  people are open to the truth now
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  and we're going into very dark times
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  we need to alert as many people as we can

[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  Webster Griffin Tarbley
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  was basically out there saying Obama's the
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  unicrised
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  I say it doesn't matter either way

[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  fresh back from Europe

[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  because he happened to be in town I just learned
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  this late last night
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  in the evening

[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  of the main show and then for about 20 minutes
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  into overdrive I'd go longer but I've got
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  a bunch of meetings and events I have to do
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  I will also

[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  we'll let Tarbley go
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  I'll let Tarbley on for an hour and 20 minutes
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  and then I'll let you know what's happening
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  in this show
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  coming up at 240
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  Central Standard Time
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  or 40 minutes towards the end of the regular
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  broadcast hour
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  though today we're going into overdrive some
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  so that's important that is
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  coming up
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  I'll let you know whether that's happening or not
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  going back to
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  Lindsay Williams and
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  of course Dr. Sam Monteef
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  in a short segment we're going to come back and take your phone calls at
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  800-259-9231
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  Lindsay you were
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  saying he told you more go ahead
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  it is literally
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  going to decimate the Arab world
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  when the price of crude oil goes
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  to $50 a barrel
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  from 143
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  where the height was to $50 a barrel
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  can you imagine
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  what it will do to the economies of the Middle East
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  then they'll turn around
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  and build
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  new economies
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  and the frightening part of them is that
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  there's a very nation that we had the Cold War with
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  but you see they're no different
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  than Communists anyway
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  because they have a Communist mentality
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  now folks every bit of this
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  is happening
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  not, okay for instance
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  the real estate debacle
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  of today the real estate problem
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  you think it just started today
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  no this was organized
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  bought off hatched up
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  10 to 15 years ago
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  when they started the option arms
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  the interest only
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  teaser loans
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  outsourcing of America
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  this didn't just happen
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  within the past year or two's time
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  well the last administration
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  this was bought off many many years ago
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  the North American Union
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  now
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  they have to bankrupt
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  our economy to fully
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  get control of it go ahead
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  you have to bankrupt the bank
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  before you take it over
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  put the bank in bankruptcy
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  put the airlines in bankruptcy
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  with fuel
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  put the banks in bankruptcy with the teaser loans
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  and the real estate problem of today
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  then the Federal Reserve comes in and takes them over
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  for nothing they literally get them
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  for
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  not all not pennies on the dollar they get them literally for nothing
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  so you see when American corporations
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  fit 59.2
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  billion dollars in China last year
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  it wasn't by chance
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  it's all by design the United States
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  has three textile jobs
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  three million manufacturing jobs
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  to free trade and outsourcing
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  152,000 companies
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  have left the United States of America
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  and one million manufacturing jobs have been lost
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  in the U.S.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  since President Bush took office
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  the federal government gave
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  tax incentives
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  for companies to move offshore
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  and the United States
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  goes into debt
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  the other nations at the rate of one trillion dollars
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  a year America must attract 17%
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  of the world's capital
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  in any given day just to service the national economy
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  and folks some of these things
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  I heard them talk about
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  the beginning stages of it
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  back 35 years ago
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  when I sat in their board meetings
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  and then they have
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  streamlined their programs ever since then
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  and then seven weeks ago
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  when this gentleman called me and told me what he did
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  and on Thursday of this past week
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  I saw the first phase of this actually
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  the Fox News
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  I realized these people are right on track
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  they know exactly what they're doing
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  things like this are planned
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  20, 30 years in advance
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  the North American Union
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  secretive meetings were being held a long time
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  before it ever happened
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  and when the price of crude oil goes
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  to $50 a barrel
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  the Arab world is decimated
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  they no longer can buy our T-bills and securities
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  and they have to
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  dump their reserve currency
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  you know what this is going to do to the dollar
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  everything they won't
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  done to the dollar is going to happen
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  right there in one sweep
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  it will take the value
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  of the dollar to practically zero
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  you say oh we'd never accept anything
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  but the greenback yes you will
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  when you have to take a wheelbarrow load
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  of paper to the grocery store
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  to buy a loaf of bread you'll beg the Federal Reserve
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  for a new currency
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  and they'll be right there to give you the North American Union
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  and a new currency and then my last
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  question to this gentleman I'm always coming up on the
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  end of the story
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  we'll come back cover that give Dr. Mon
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  Teef's analysis of what we're talking about

[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  and someday you'll be the leader of a big old
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  band
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  we're back live ladies and gentlemen
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  thank you so much for joining us today
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  yeah we're in dark times but
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  liberty and the spirit of freedom
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  God's energizing spirit
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  fills all of us that love these to see an honor
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  and the forces of evil are making
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  their move on every front right now
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  but a lot of people are waking up to evil
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  a lot of people are waking up to the world
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  and a lot of people are standing up
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  with us and it's a great time
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  to be alive
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  I got to hear this last part
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  yeah
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  love it
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  we're back live ladies and gentlemen
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  all right back to the serious issue
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  I want to spend five minutes with both of you
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  so I want to get the calls here
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  calls from Canada, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  you name it
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  because the callers always bring up issues
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  that we may have forgotten to cover
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  different angles that bring out some key info
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  so I love the spinning the wheel there
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  and seeing what they'll have to say or ask
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  but finishing up what this big exec told you
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  and again
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  we don't normally have people on who say
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  I had somebody secretly told me and I can't tell you
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  he talked like this, he's always put out good info
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  we know the pastor has really got key information
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  we know his
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  one of his speeches has been number one
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  off and on on Google for six, eight months
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  tens of millions watching it
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  we know it was freaking him out
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  and we know he was threatened and so I believe
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  the story is telling us I don't know if this is going to happen
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  the way that this exec thinks
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  because there are fissures and separations
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  even in the elite but finishing up and then any key points
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  Dr. Monteef wants to make
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  well I would simply say that
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  what Lindsay has said
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  that he was told was that there were
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  terrible times coming to America
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  and everything of course that Lindsay suggested
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  are things that you and I have talked about
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  for a long time Alex
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  I think a terrible time is why I head for America
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  and as horrible as it is
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  to contemplate what's going to happen
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  it may be the only thing that's going to save this country
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  we've got to get people who are so affluent
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  and so indifferent and apathetic
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  to realize there's a real problem
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  and I think we could be asking before very long
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  how did this happen
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  and I hope your listeners and my listeners
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  will be there to tell them
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  absolutely
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  Lindsay just in like three minutes
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  four minutes
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  one more to come back from Dr. Monteef
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  and we'll go to the calls other key things this individual told you
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  I ran
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  the subject did come up
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  now I have been under the impression for a long time
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  and I think probably others of you have too
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  that we were going to have an invasion
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  on Iran or Israel would invade Iran
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  Israel may invade Iran
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  but according to this gentleman
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  the best thing to do with Iran is to
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  bankrupt them
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  you heard me correctly take it to $50 a barrel
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  and literal to destroy the economy
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  of Iran thirdly
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  the last question I said what
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  in light of all of this is going to happen to the United States
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  of America and I'll put it in his words
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  he said we
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  are going to see a financial collapse
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  in America that is so great
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  that it will take years to come out
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  I am so concerned
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  because you see
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  for 35 years I've known that these people
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  know in advance what they're going to do
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  please I beg of you
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  my new dvd entitled
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  the next 12 months
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  I've tried to give all the background
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  I've said everything I could
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  I'll say more things than I could
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  I'll say more things than I could
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  I'll say more things than I could
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  I'll say more things than I could
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  I'll say more things than I could
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  I'll say more things than what I've said on the air today
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  I beg of you the number is
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  800 321
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  2900
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  I've had to close down my website
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  now Alex
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  people don't fool around when websites mean so much to them
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  I had no choice when they gave me this
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  they ultimately made them
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  800 321
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  2900
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  the only place you'll get it
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  I beg of you give them a call and find out the details
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  Alex
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  Alex
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  Alex, are you there?
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  Yes, I'm right here
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  I wanted you to come back Dr. Monteef
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  and comment on what you just said about Iran
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  well, we're just going to have to wait
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  and see what's going to happen
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  I'm getting a lot of information from these places
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  at least
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  Israel will attack Iran
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  and of course it'll be
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  it'll really draw us into the war
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  it won't be an invasion at all
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  it's going to be an airstrike on Iran
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  pray that information is false
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  because this would be a disaster
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  it would inflame the entire Muslim world
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  and of course
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  that should happen
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  I really fear that we're going to have a war
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  with the Muslim world
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  I think they've been working on it for a long time
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  they're working with the Christians to get us to hate the Muslims
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  they're working with the Muslims
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  to get them to hate us
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  what better way to have a terrible, terrible war
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  and of course
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  if we had time we could talk about civil admins
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  and other revelations
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  and how this suggests to me that
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  we're going to be moving towards a nuclear war
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  because of course civil admins story
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  was that there is a secret spy ring
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  working at the highest level
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  levels of our government
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  shipping nuclear secrets
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  and nuclear technology
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  to Pakistan so that they can
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  certainly get the
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  nuclear bomb which they have
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  and they can get it to the other Muslim nations
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  why would our State Department
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  be allowing that to go on
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  why has not only the local
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  federal courts but even the Supreme Court
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  of the United States said
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  the American people cannot here with civil admins
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  as to say
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  and I think it's because the last thing in the world
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  that our leaders wanted for
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  the American people to realize that we are building up
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  the best enemy money could buy
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  in the Muslim world in Pakistan
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  and supplying the nuclear weapons
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  thank God
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  I just hope to God that I'm wrong
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  and for those who don't know
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  civil admins was
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  working with the Pentagon and FBI
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  decoding transmissions
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  she discovered that the highest levels of the US
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  government black ops
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  were of course working
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  with Pakistan and other
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  nations and it's all come out mainstream news
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  separate from the classified things
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  she was gagged on but she has leaked out
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  some info but it's admitted that
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  Britain, the US and Israel helped arm
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  with nukes Pakistan while they're freaking
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  out over Iran that is nowhere near it
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  seven years away we know
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  that they've been shipping all sorts of nukes
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  and
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  small tacticals around
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  frogs as they're known
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  and so
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  they can have plausible deniability
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  we know that George Bush Sr.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  shipped in 3,500 Iraqi
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  republican guard trained by the CIA
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  put into Saddam's government he was CIA
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  then Clinton brought in
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  another thousand
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  or so to make it
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  above 5,000 I know was the final number
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  LA Times reported on this ladies and gentlemen
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  so to other major publications
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  Washington Times and those Iraqis
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  work for the shadow government
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  and can be used as patsies
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  or be used as commandos
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  to stage attacks and if any of them get caught or killed
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  people will say oh look it's Iraqis
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  so there is a huge
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  very dangerous operation
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  going on here that we keep warning people about
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  and civil admins of course decoded stuff
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  with our government shipping and narcotics
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  small arms, heavy arms
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  anti-tank weapons
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  nukes, nuke parts
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  this is the black ops
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  and then America is the target
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  homeland security is to bring down America
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  and make sure the population
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  can never get back in control of the government
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  and stop the wrecking ball being brought
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  to the nation will then be reforged
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  as a military
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  mercenary ground
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  to recruit the forces
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  to empower the world government
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  and we will be a third world despotic system
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  for then on
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  forevermore according to their plan
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  utter monty if you can curb that analysis
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  well I think you're absolutely right
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  I think that it's the same pattern
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  that has been used over and over again
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  you go into the real background of the Second World War
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  it was American corporations
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  and banks and even
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  our own government it was building up Adolf Hitler
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  and not only supplied
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  with military material
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  they needed before the Second World War
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  but even during the Second World War
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  this is covered in the books
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  of Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  by Professor Sutton
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  which we do carry and then in a book
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  by Charles Hingham
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  trading with the enemy
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  they supplied Adolf Hitler not only before the war
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  but during the war
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  but those terms aren't enough
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  they built him
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  the British intelligence made him
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  just like they funded the red brigades
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  of the Tsarist Russia
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  in 1917 all declassified
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  all admitted the globalist of the most dark hearted
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  duplicitous individuals
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  you can imagine to all the police and military
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  this is the final takedown of the US
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  be aware of it
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  their plan is not going well I would add
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  and they're behind schedule and having some problems
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  so
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  you've got to be with us who can be against this
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  but this is serving this will lead to your destruction
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  you better serve liberty and freedom
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  I want to now go to
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  no calls
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  Bronco in Canada you're on the air
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  hello
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  yes Bronco
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  hey Alex how's it going
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  good
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  my question was this with the rise
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  in oil prices in the US
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  we've been listening to your guest
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  talking about oil prices falling
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  why doesn't the US
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  which its economy and
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  cars are basically the major
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  contributor
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  why don't the social engineers
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  give up all their power
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  and convert to an energy that they don't control
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  why would they give their power
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  if they don't the government doesn't want
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  what's good for you
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  they want to transfer wealth and power to the elite
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  and dumb the population down
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  I was reading right here up in Canada
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  we have an auto manufacture
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  that's been working on creating an electric car
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  I was reading an article that they created
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  a battery or something that could
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  power a car, an electric car
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  to close to the same
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  kind of sparks as a regular car
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  so I was thinking to myself
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  why not just do that
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  and end oil dependency right there
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  you're being logical
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  none of this is logical
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  they don't want a solution to the problem
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  they want the problem
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  and they want to be able to
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  keep us dependent upon
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  oil because they control the oil
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  you're looking at this thing logically
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  you don't look at that
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  but then they know
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  you call for real environmental reforms
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  and things that work nobody's saying oil is good
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  and then they bring in
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  okay we'll have your kids as spies
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  tattling on you for your light bulbs
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  and we'll say you shouldn't eat as much food
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  to save the environment and we'll create new regulations
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  and social workers involved in all your lives
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  look they've built the United States
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  and Canada in urban sprawl
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  it's designed around the car
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  you can't reverse that you can
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  make cars that are electric or solar
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  they're going to try to frustrate
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  block that regulatory
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  buy it up, shelve it, control it
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  hybridize it so it's not as good
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  or economical slow down its implementation
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  this is about raping you
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  now that they've got you dependent on fossil fuels
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  understand Bronco?
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  my second question is also
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  like I know
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  that oil companies have colluded
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  to shut down refining capacity
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  over the past
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  to the 70s
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  if I remember correctly
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  even if they could flood the
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  world market with oil
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  how are they going to get it to market?
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  you know what I mean?
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  it's kind of like a bottleneck at the
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  Lindsay Williams comments on that
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  the name of the game is
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  control
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  always remember that as long as you live
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  don't try to analyze it, just understand
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:31.000]  what they're doing
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  when they bring it down to $50 a barrel
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  it's not necessarily for the purpose
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  of what you're thinking about in refineries
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  they're doing this for the purpose of
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  decimating one economy and one culture
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  in the Middle East
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  and making another culture
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  and over a period of time they'll do this
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  so it's not the matter of refineries
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  of
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  I know we haven't had a refineries built in
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  50 years
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  but this is not the issue
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  you understand Bronco?
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:01.000]  it's about shutting the oil off
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  to the Arab nations
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  and then imploding the US
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  and then the bankers, after they've sucked the country drive
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  they move on to a new area
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  to start the Ponzi scheme over again
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  it makes sense
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  you'd often think that
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  these guys use their
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  it's ingenious really the plan
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  if they'd use their powers for good
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  but that would empower you
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  and then you would have freedom
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  and they wouldn't have a monopoly of power
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Boston
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  you're on the air worldwide
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  a couple of quick comments
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  as far as the long-term energy
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  plans, Colonel Fletcher Proudy
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  who died back in June of 2001
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  had written about how
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  they've been attending meetings
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  and they're planning for this fake peak oil
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  crisis that we're seeing
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  and try to implement now
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  they have their paid off geochemists
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  call it fossil fuel
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  the idea being that it comes from
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  formerly living organisms and therefore
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  it's limited quantity
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  so it has been believed by the general public
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  up until now but we're now drilling
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  and finding massive amounts of oil
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  far deeper than any organic material
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  has ever lived
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  some of those Russian wells
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  are 42, 43,000 feet
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  and you know who built them
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  who drilled them, we did
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  our companies went over there
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  and drilled it
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  we have made Russia the second largest oil exporter
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  in the world and the largest natural gas exporter
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  thanks to American money
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  World Bank money, eastern
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  Asian development
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  we're not allowed to drill for ours because those are government lands
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  out west and up in Alaska
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  only the planned
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  economies get to grow because then
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  all the wealth goes to the elites
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  thank you for the call, Kevin
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  great points that you make
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  Jason and Matt, you're on the air
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  Hi
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  this is Jason Robel
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  I'm a student at Humboldt State University
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  in Northern California
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  and I'm a science and econ double major
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  with a history minor and we're supposed to be
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  the social environmental justice institution
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  but our alternative energy program called SHAT
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  is infected by Chevron
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  which has an inherent interest of course
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  in preventing viable energy sources
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  or alternatives
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  so I was going to bring up how our environmentalism
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  is a joke and these environments
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  not to use silence us
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  they get everybody concerned about the environment
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  which is legitimate
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  they give you false solutions, false crises
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  and so on
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  they silence you for talking about the actual root causes
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  so I was curious if you could speak for a moment
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  about the GM streetcar conspiracy
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  how these energy shackles were imposed
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  in the first place
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  that's all admitted back in the 30s into the 40s
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  they got us off streetcars
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  built the society around cars and roads
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  which people liked
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  I'm not saying that was bad but they did it for control
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  and they went in and bought up the streetcar companies
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  and the railroad companies
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  and shut it down
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  and they would commute
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  to get her master's degree in Houston
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  she would commute like 90 miles
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  every day from east Texas
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  on the weekdays to college
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  she got her first degree
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  I guess at Baylor
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  same time with my other grandmother
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  they went to school together
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  what a small time it was
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  what a small state it was then population wise
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  but then there's all these photos
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  even when my dad was about 3-4 years old
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  they're great photos
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  jumping out of the big bullet train
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  from Houston being picked up by my grandfather
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  those are great black and white photos
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  and then they just got rid of the bullet train
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  it was almost nothing
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  for her to ride a bullet train down
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  that went 120 miles an hour down to Houston every day
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  it's amazing
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  I'm glad to see your articles
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  like the one on alcohol recently
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  and prohibition and how that was an inside job
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  for special interest
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  it's outrageous that nobody understands these things
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  and let alone know about Katzbuss
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  who found great ways that we could power our devices
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  absolutely, we'll be right back with the final segment
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  with our guests and it's Webster Griffin Tarpoli
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  and then Mark Kornke in studio
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  right here deep in the heart of Texas
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  stay with us
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  hey Bonnie, no more pickpocket
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  and for us, I have an easy way
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  we can steal people's credit cards
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  without even knowing they've been robbed
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  how so Clyde?
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  just by waving it near you
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  there's no credit card information while your cards are still in your purse
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  just watch
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  hey look, that's my info on the screen
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  you gotta be kidding me
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  nope, with 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  I figure we'll make a fortune
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  as long as people don't hear about identity stronghold
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  why? what's identity stronghold?
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  they make the secure sleeve
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  when people keep their credit cards
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  in the shielded secure sleeve, I can't read them
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  no way
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  most people don't realize they even have chips
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  in the credit cards and passports
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  I already got some
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  I also got some to fit our passports
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet

[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  question
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  is the world getting better
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  or vastly worse?
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  worse, worse, worse
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  the world economic collapse could come any day
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  day, day, day
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  question, are you prepared?
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  or are you ignoring the signs?
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  the signs, the signs, the signs
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  question, do you have 7 years of healthy food
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  for your family?
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  the signs, the signs, the signs

[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  Good afternoon gentlemen
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  I've been listening for a long time
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  over the last couple of days
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  I listened to Mr. Williams there
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  and I watched his video
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  and I'm fully enlightened
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  and all I can say to all of you
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  is thank you all so much
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  last night I had an opportunity
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  to tell my family
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  I told him exactly what he said
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  oil is going to go down to $50 a barrel
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  and the economy is going to implode
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  and all they could think of was
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  we're going to get cheap gas
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  and I'm just thinking to myself
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  don't you see
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  what's happening
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  but anyway
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  I'm enlightened
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  there's people that when I talk to
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  some of them shake their head
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  like I'm a nut and then other people
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  their jaws drop and they're going out
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  and they're spreading the word
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  I have a funny feeling that
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  what's going to happen is
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  because everything's going so fast
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  like you said many times
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  they might have bitten off more than they could chew
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  that the people are going to wake up and revolt
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  and it just
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  kind of
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  made me think of a scripture and a bible
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  that many are the plans of a man's heart
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  but it's God's purpose that's going to prevail
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  but I didn't know if you guys
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  saw this in the asian times
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  a couple days ago
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  there was a thing where
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  prime minister maliki wanted
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  the us troops out of iraq
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  with a certain time
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  and the bush administration and the military said
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  we're not leaving
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  we thought about how when
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  supposedly when we went over there to liberate them
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  to give them freedom
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  and we were going to leave when it was all done
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  now we don't want to go
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  and today
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  there was another piece
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  it was just in there today in the asian times
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  where it said
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  back in 2006 prime minister maliki
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  was not as strong or confident as he was
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  back in 2008
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  and the bush administration
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  might have more problems than
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  it's all staged over there
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  and anybody that tries to actually
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  lead their people they will try to kill
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  it's clear the globalists are trying to kill muhammad qarzai now
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  in afghanistan as well
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  so they're just constantly stabbing
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  each other in the bank thank you for the call
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  I want to thank pastor
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  lindsay williams for coming on

[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  I told him I said you know our family

[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  50 years and this gentleman
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  I told him I said we're giving some very definite
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  consideration to his family going back into the ministry
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:57:59.000]  you love this alex
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:01.000]  he said well chaplain he said you did a great
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  job for us up there and pruto he said I
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  wish you the very best he said I think that would
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  definitely be a wise decision
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  but you and for us
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  he said it's a great idea and he said god bless

[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  by you david bockefeller
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:09.000]  that's for a lateral commission to see far
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  we sit down and shout out
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  the day that we stop asking questions
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:15.000]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds
[1:59:15.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  of just criticism to grow at our own door
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  seven years after the
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  attacks of september 11
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  a global awakening has taken place

[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  20 minutes after the break
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  we're going to have webster griffin tarbly fresh back
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  from a tour in europe
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  he has put a book out
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  that we are selling by the way
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  at infowars.com on the online
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  video bookstore
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  about barack obama
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  we're also going to be having
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  dr. Jerome coursey on
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  next week when his new book comes out
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  he says some original new stuff he's dug up
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  and i'm not for john mccain
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  i want to make that clear
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  i am not for john mccain
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  i am not for a barack obama
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  i am simply going to have guests on
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  exposing both of them
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  so that people out there listening
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  at least have a chance to understand that both are bought and paid for
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  both are compromised
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  they run nothing they do nothing i think obsessing over obama
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  itself is a distraction
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  we have to spend all our time discrediting the system
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  where they'll stage new attacks new wars
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  and then they get the public to stampede
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  to empower their new world order
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  they start world war one
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  world war two, korea, vietnam
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  the other wars
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  we get all their declassified documents how they stage them
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  they've had other events like trying to sink the liberty
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  to start war with russia that failed
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  other events that succeeded
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  like gulf of tongan
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:01:59.000]  9-11 but in the hindsight is now failing
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  we have to have a revelation
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  and understanding of government sponsored terror
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  we have to take that mechanism
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  the new world order uses over and over again
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  and fully expose it to light
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  it's like a piece of film
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  if you expose it to even a
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:15.000]  tiny bit of light
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  in a dark room it's going to be ruined
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  well we need to expose it to the broad
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  sunlight
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  and the 9-11 fraud is now
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  a piece of film that has been partially exposed
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  it has spots all over it
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  it's fading and soon
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  it'll be completely worthless to them
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  and every time there's a terror attack stage
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  people will look at who stands to gain
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  hence the term ladies and gentlemen
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  kibono
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  who benefits in latin
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  so we're going to have tarply on about that
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  and several issues you know i've always liked tarply
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  i exposed tarply to a lot of people
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  brought him out to a lot of people
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  put him on c-span
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  i'm going to bring up the tarply fact that
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  he viciously attacked ron paul and said some things about him that are
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  manifestly untrue and i'm going to ask
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  you know tarply it's why he hadn't been on here in a year
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  really hurt my feelings but i thought you know why
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  not have tarply on i mean i like
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  the guy i don't think he means bad
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  i think a lot of his info is very good
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  he's a very intelligent person
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  but i'm going to bring all these issues up with him today because
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  because it's
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  what he's saying about obama is important
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  and we respect his opinion
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  but i don't like
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  you know key people in our movement
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  attacking each other so i'm also going to mention that
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  it's not going to be some type of brawl or anything
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  i don't want people to be aware of that
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  and it heads up to everyone
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  in an hour and twenty minutes i will be announcing
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  whether we're going to have the willy nelson concert or not
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  so you want to tune in for that as well
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  the biggest thing we need to do is wake everybody
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  and our friends family neighborhoods workplaces
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  up and the best tools we have for that are my films
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  like police state to the takeover

[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  so they have uh... kicked uh...
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  is a big number zensky off of
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  his foreign policy advisory panel
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  brock obama's but doesn't matter the whole
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  same crew is directly points out
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  uh... that wants to attack russia
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  that wants to attack uh... other
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  countries in central asia
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  that wants to move nuclear weapons back into
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  europe and point them and uh... the russians
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  i mean everything he's saying is true my only
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  difference is perspective on this
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  it almost lends credibility
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  to the whole election process
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  uh... when you're
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  talking about brock obama versus hillary
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  and now it's brock obama
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  and uh... versus john mccain
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  i mean it's a foregone conclusion
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  it's like a don king fight
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  where he owns both the fighters and you just
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  you know it's going to be read
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  either way and then you've got all these neocons
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  on fox uh... saying
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  oh israel
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  uh... is going to attack
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  uh...
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  before the election to get
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:39.000]  john mccain elected
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  i don't know if that's the case i want to get
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  tarpoli's uh... take on that uh... tarpoli
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  is quite a uh...
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  you know geopolitical expert is his research
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  is very good i constantly
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  study and read and research and and find
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  that tarpoli's information is again
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  very accurate i only
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  differ with you webster
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  on the inferences you draw
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  on the the uh...
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  i mean here's an example two years ago i was saying
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  we weren't going to attack iran then
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  you were saying guaranteed with dates
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  and so i think we can argue about
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  what how we analyze
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  that data and and and and what
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  we come up with
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  uh... and so uh...
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  i think you get the points on making your webster
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  yes alex first of all let me thank you
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  for inviting me thank you for for stocking
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  my book and and i'm i'm delighted
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  to have this uh... this discussion
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  uh... i would say first of all
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  we have to look at ourselves like an able battle
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  we're confronting a hostile fleet
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  and you've got to concentrate your fire
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  on the flagship of the hostile fleet
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  rather than just scattering fire
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  in every direction and i think
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  if you turn on the television for ten minutes
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  there is no doubt
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  that obama is the candidate favored
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  by the controlled corporate media
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  yes he is anointed it is an endless
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  worship fest and
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  i watched him in europe quite a bit
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  over the weekend on c-span raw footage
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  he is a uh...
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  he is bumbling
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  he doesn't know what he's talking about
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  i know a lot of uh... high school seniors
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  in government class that could speak
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  more eloquently than him and that is upsetting to me
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  you're exactly right but
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  the choice that's being made is of course
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  being made by wall street and it's being made
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  by our old friends the trilateral
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  rocker feller builder burger
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  council on farm relations
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  rand corporation chicago
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  school skull and bones up up up and there's
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  order and one for two thousands
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  now there's a great right and there's a
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  reason for this though why do they support
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  obama what's the reason
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  yes uh... maybe even more so than bush
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  he's somebody who's been raised literally
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  up out of nothing
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  by these trilateral people my personal
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  hypothesis is most recruited
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  by his big new bridge into the eighty one
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  and nineteen eighty three
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  they had just finished up with carter
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  you'll remember that uh...
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  his big new bridge in ski and valker ran the
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  catastrophic carter administrator and then
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  and then printed all on him when he was well
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  meaning uh... yes and that's also an aspect
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  of why they've chosen obama because obama
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  is not well-meaning obama is a boiling
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  cauldron of hate but back there in columbia
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  in eighty one to eighty three
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  they were looking around for a
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  puppet a manchurian candidate
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  assets and of course they had a broad choice
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  didn't have to be just obama they picked
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  others uh... to to deploy
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  into a uh... political
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  upsurge in this country
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  uh... approximately now two thousand
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  and a two thousand and ten
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  two thousand and twenty and obama
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  was one of the political properties
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  that they picked up so they have been
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  grooming him and indoctrinating him
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  by the way i'm backing you up dot it is
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  cut he has done a whole book on
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  all these famous people when they're in college
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  they'll be in the lunch line and david
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  rockerfeller will be there or is a big
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  new brisinski will be there henry kissinger
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  they go pick who they want
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  and that i think that is my my thesis is
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  that that's what happened with obama and
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  therefore all the wonderful coincidences
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  and magic events of his life
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  are guided by that fine
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  trilateral hand behind the scenes
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  but ultimately why do they need him today
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  basically two things
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  the entire phase of islamo
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  fascism war on terror post nine eleven
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  i believe is exhausted
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  i think they're gone into a new phase
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  the fake environmental malphusian
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  the russians are a threat
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  yes it's russia china malphusian
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  unabomber kind of stuff
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  but then it's also human rights
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  humanitarian concerns
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  and left cover we're going from a phase
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  of right-wing cover imperialism
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  to a phase of left-wing cover
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  imperialism this is why so many of our
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  left liberal friends have not been able to understand
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  this because they they regard all of this
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  as progress they think that it's
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  getting or something going in the right direction
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  and of course it's not by the way the romans
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  would do this in a different protectorate
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  and new places they taken over
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  they would put a thug in for five ten years
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  to murder, kill, stab
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  then they would publicly flog him
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  execute him, apologize
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  and then rise up somebody from that
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  local area in germania
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  or gall
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  or there
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  in areas of austria
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  or it could be in more asian areas
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  and then they would raise up a local
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  who on the surface would act like
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  he was friendly to the people but he would actually intensify
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  taxation and control
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  excellent and in the case of
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  bryzinski you can say this is the hegelian
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  dialectic this is one of those cases where
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  you can actually see the hegelian dialectic
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  at work bryzinski's
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  teacher is a guy called Carl Friedrichs
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  and so he has a degree
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  in hegelian dialectic
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  yes and Friedrichs is a historian
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  he wrote the age of the baroque
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  he's a historian of the 30 years war
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  as a professor of the hegelian dialectic
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  yeah and bryzinski is a student at
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  McGill University with this guy
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  and of course with others
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  and essentially what they've said is
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  you can't keep going with the right wing stuff
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  you can't do bush cheney neocons
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  right now here in washington bush cheney
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  neocons are finished they're out
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  they have no influence they're a laughing stock
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  they're going to jail
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  they're done and their policies are
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  out too and we could go through that in
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  some detail but the idea is now what's
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:05.000]  the new policy the bryzinski argument is
[2:16:05.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  stop wasting time in the middle east
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  stop mucking around in the
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  persian gulf remember that on a
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  world scale the main opposition
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  to u.s. imperialism is
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  russia and china it's the shanghai
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  cooperation organization
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  you smash those you've
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  guaranteed u.s. british world
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  domination for another century
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  and so get busy doing that
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  and forget forget the attack on iran
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  i believe there will be no attack on iran
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  there have been ultimatums delivered to
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  the israelis well why did you previously
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  believe that there would be i think
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  that we we came very close and the closest
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  we came was last august
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  with the road b-52 there was an attempt
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  by the cheney gang last august
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  to actually hijack a
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  b-52 intercontinental bomber they
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  flew it from north dakota to
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  louisiana they were going to fly that
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  to the middle east and i had six cruise
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  missiles on it load of notes and this
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  was going to take part in the attack on
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  israel that took place on september 6
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  however it was stopped on the ground and
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  as that question went up the chain of command
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  and began to interest the intelligence
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  agencies the word came down
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:11.000]  no no no no
[2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  no and that i believe that was the last
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  gas pollution change then we see a string
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  of reports by the cia and defense
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  intelligence saying it's all lies iran's
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:21.000]  not a threat but
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  you're saying you don't think israel's
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  going to wildcard because they're certainly
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  setting up the propaganda front i think
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  i think a lot of that is disinformation
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:31.000]  the attack that you have to worry about that's going
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  on right now there's another country
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  three times bigger than iran with nuclear
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  weapons that is being attacked back
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:39.000]  and it's pakistan and i believe
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  there will be a u.s. of nato and afghan
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  land invasion of northwest pakistan
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:45.000]  now the difference though is that
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  they're different and they've been outlining
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  they've been preparing the ground on that
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  the the difference is that now
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  the target list is how do you
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  weaken russia how do you weaken china
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  how do you strip away chinese allies
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:17:59.000]  and chinese strategic
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  partners that means pakistan
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  is at the top of the list
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  not for this idiotic al qaeda
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  bin laden fairy tale that we've already
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  refuted and you've refuted so many
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  times but now it's the question
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  now that's just a rubric
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  bogeyman cover i agree
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  but the real reason is
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  that pakistan is an ally of china
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  and that's what they've got to go after the
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  gold of the operations out of afghanistan
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  right now chinese encirclement
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  yeah it's to encircle china by
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  by destroying pakistan and with by dividing
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  pakistan into four five six
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  countries be it balochistan push tunistan
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  was iristan
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  or whatever you have
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  they're going to shatter pakistan
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  they want to break it in three parts that's why they won't
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  let maliki kick him out do you agree with that
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  uh... yes that's the bernard lewis plan
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  and that of course goes on and on but now the bernard lewis plan
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  stay there stay there yeah the great game

[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:09.000]  at least we thought we did truth rising
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:11.000]  is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  that finally gives first responders a

[2:20:57.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  martial law
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  did you know the accumulation
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  of acidic waste in the body
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  is the single largest cause of disease such as
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  cancer or diabetes
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  what we drink, the environment
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  and our high stress lifestyles
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  it's these choices that cause decreased energy
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  and eventually disease
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  the easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  is by drinking alkaline ionized water

[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  on my block
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:27.000]  she'll just sit there
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  as a night girl still
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  she'll say who
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  gonna take away his life
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  son's to kill
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  Obama the post-modern coup
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  now they take it
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  and they teach him
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  look the reason I saw the elite
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  the Fox News type people
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  having fun raises for her quietly
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  Rush Limbaugh trying to make sure that she won
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  really pushing for that
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  as
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  the major power structure
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  of the neocons being behind Hillary
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  and I said that she was going to be
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  the person that won and I said five years ago
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  you'd hear Limbaugh endorse her
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  I was right about them endorsing her
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  I was wrong about her winning
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  just like Tarpley was wrong about them
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  attacking Iran a year and a half ago two years ago
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  but none of us are perfect
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  the point here is I don't claim to have all the answers
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  I just know this to hold Hillary out
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  and to say well we're attacking the main
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  capital ship here in the Info War
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  I just say it's all a latrine
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  they're all different things floating around in there
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  and I'm not going to say go for either one of them
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  because it's that lesser of evils thing
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  it just doesn't matter just credit the whole process
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:39.000]  that's what brings them down
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  just credit them all is what we've got to do
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  but now we've got Obama
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  we've got McCain so we're analyzing that
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  we are looking at that
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  I mean you're not denying Webster
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  that Hillary would have been a
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  willing servant of the very elite running Obama today
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  are you?
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  willing but not as willing as Obama
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  not a hundred percent a slave
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  maybe fifty percent, seventy percent a slave
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  after all she's got a two term president
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  in the house
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  she does not owe her entire existence
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  to this big new Brzezinski
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  in the way that Obama does
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  Obama is one thousand percent
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  a puppet, a total abject slave
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  what do you say to Brzezinski's people being in the McCain campaign now?
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  yeah that's it
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  Brzezinski's a clever fellow
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  and Mark, who's on the Obama side
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  and by the way
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  Brzezinski continues to run Obama
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  this is just window dressing
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  Brzezinski learned under Carter
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  that he's Dr. Strange Levin
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  he better stay out of the TV
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  Brzezinski was hated under Carter
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  he was booed at the Democratic convention that year
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  so he's got one son Mark
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  who helps to run Obama
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  and he's got Ian Brzezinski as a fallback option
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  on the McCain side
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  but the reason why Obama
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  the greatest evil if you will
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  basically two sides
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  one is a policy side
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  one is that you're going to do this global showdown
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  against China and Russia
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  the first thing you need to do is to kick the Chinese
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  out of Africa
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  you've got to cut off oil, minerals
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  strategic raw materials from Africa
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  to China
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  because the ultimate goal of this
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  is to drive the Chinese in on eastern Siberia
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  and you've got to get the left
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  in America behind war
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  and just like under Clinton
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  they were happy to blow the daylights out of Serbia
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  the irony is that today
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  you have the peace movement
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  they say we're against the war in Iraq
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  how about Afghanistan, a lot of them are for it
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  how about Sudan
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  they say we're in favor of attacking Sudan
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  the goal of that of course is to cut off 7%
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  of the Chinese oil
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  they're in favor of attacking Burma, a Chinese ally
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  they think it's fine to go after Pakistan
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  because they don't like Mushara
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  and we saw the classic preparation
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  for the US in tax
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  and global taxation paid directly to the private banks
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  making them truly governmental for the first time
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  with their own armies, intelligence agencies
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  and mercenaries
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  they say oh Bush is against the global warming tax
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  so the left all gets behind it
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  and now oh Bush is against attacking North Africa
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  which he's been gearing up and wanting to do
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  but because he publicly says he's against it
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  now the left supports it
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  I mean this is please don't throw me in the briar patch
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  base psychology
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:15.000]  the problem here is you can get the left liberals
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  the one side of it is Obama is the face
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  of imperialism
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  Obama represents a facelift
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  for US-British imperialism
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  in places like Africa
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  the second thing is in terms of potential for
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  strike-breaking austerity
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  cutting the living standard
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  and this kind of thing on the internal front
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  he has left cover
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  he can say I'm going to break your strike
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  and he's been saying that we have to lower our standards
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  and quote sacrifice
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  for the new world order
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  I totally agree with you on all of this
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  how that particular quotation
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  the stuff about you can't have SUVs
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  you can't eat as much as you want
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  you can't have the temperature set where you want
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  that comes directly out of Brzezinski's
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  book second chance
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  that's a translation into slogans of about two pages
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  in there where Brzezinski argues
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  against the US way of life
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  it's not attractive to other countries
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  but now here's the biggest consideration of all
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  fascism
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  postmodern fascism what is it
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  really a top-down phenomenon
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  we have a bush cheney police state
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  where it gets more and more oppressive
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  and more and more wiretaps
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  and more and more snooping and opening the mail
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  or isn't fascism something else
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  isn't fascism a
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  grassroots mass movement
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  with left cover radical cover
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  a movement of fanatics
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  devoted to a personality cult
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  if you look at it from that point of view
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  Obama has it nobody else has it
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  we're not going to take this break
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  stream listeners go to those streams
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  everybody else will be back in three minutes
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  infowars.com that's where you hear the behind the scenes
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  right now
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  okay
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  Webster continue
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  and certainly
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  it's cynical they put a
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  guy who's half black
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:28:59.000]  up there oh everything's fine there's this
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  pride things have changed
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  and then now it fools a large sector
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  of the left they keep the wiretaps
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  the police state but
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:09.000]  it's like the bush administration was saying torture children
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:11.000]  all overtly now it's
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  smoothed over it's now
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  institutionalized refined
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  they bring in the fake green revolution
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  to regulate control tax
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  in the US and England they're announcing
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  children cops called
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  climate cops says report on your parents
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  Obama wants a million
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  to start with
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  high schoolers with guns quote
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  spying on people bigger than the armed forces
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  keep talking about that
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  yet that's the essence of fascism in other words
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  when you look at things like al gore's
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  green army obama's
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  green core obama's
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  homeland security core
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:47.000]  obama's volunteer programs
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  all of this gives you the idea
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  of a private army in other words
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  an extra legal
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:55.000]  force of goons
[2:29:55.000 --> 2:29:57.000]  thugs criminals
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:29:59.000]  but also fervently idealist
[2:29:59.000 --> 2:30:01.000]  allah hitler allah
[2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:03.000]  Stalin allah
[2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:05.000]  and his youth brigades i would urge
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:07.000]  people to look at the young musulini
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:09.000]  i think that's that's a good
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:11.000]  clear-cut
[2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  example well it was a was the
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:15.000]  was the ground breaker the trailblazer
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:17.000]  he invented what we're seeing today
[2:30:17.000 --> 2:30:19.000]  pretty much if between nineteen nineteen
[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  and nineteen twenty two the idea of
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  having a movement now remember and the march
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:25.000]  on Rome and musulini
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  and so they come
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  in with obama and then capture the popular rage
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  in a false revolution
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  against tyranny truly bringing in official
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  tyranny yes i think basically
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:37.000]  you go to fascism as
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  a ruling elite you go to fascism when
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  police repression doesn't
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:43.000]  work anymore when the army is unreliable
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:45.000]  you've got to organize the
[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:47.000]  population to crush itself
[2:30:47.000 --> 2:30:49.000]  and for that you need a plausible
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:51.000]  demagogue you need somebody
[2:30:51.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  with this messianic utopian
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:55.000]  rhetoric by biber
[2:30:55.000 --> 2:30:57.000]  pardon me pied piper
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:30:59.000]  a pied piper yeah and again it's musulini
[2:30:59.000 --> 2:31:01.000]  look at musulini he was a radical
[2:31:01.000 --> 2:31:03.000]  socialist he was a revolutionary
[2:31:03.000 --> 2:31:05.000]  so are formidable that
[2:31:05.000 --> 2:31:07.000]  lenin praised him
[2:31:07.000 --> 2:31:09.000]  and when you look at the foundation of italian
[2:31:09.000 --> 2:31:11.000]  fascism you've got people like
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:13.000]  trade union militants
[2:31:13.000 --> 2:31:15.000]  disgruntled war veterans
[2:31:15.000 --> 2:31:17.000]  artists and intellectuals
[2:31:17.000 --> 2:31:19.000]  and these socialist and
[2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  leftists who have been outraged by bush
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:23.000]  are now driven into the arms
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:25.000]  of this corporate crafted
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  uh... monster
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:29.000]  right and and again
[2:31:29.000 --> 2:31:31.000]  nobody else has it bush does not
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:33.000]  have a fascist mass movement you can
[2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:35.000]  imagine bush making a balcony
[2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:37.000]  speech ala musulini or bush
[2:31:37.000 --> 2:31:39.000]  making a nuremberg
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  rally speech in the stadium
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:43.000]  he can't do it mccain can't do
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:45.000]  it missus clinton has a strong
[2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  following among among normal democrats
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:49.000]  but it's not a fanatical
[2:31:49.000 --> 2:31:51.000]  mass movement people collapsing
[2:31:51.000 --> 2:31:53.000]  worshipping
[2:31:53.000 --> 2:31:55.000]  this is why obama is the greatest
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:31:57.000]  evil in other words
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:31:59.000]  let's recap that right now back on the main show
[2:31:59.000 --> 2:32:01.000]  okay
[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  everybody knows
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:09.000]  everybody knows that the days
[2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  are loaded
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  everybody rolls
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  with their fingers crossed
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:17.000]  everybody knows
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:19.000]  the war is over
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:21.000]  everybody knows
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  the good guys lost
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:25.000]  everybody knows
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  the fight was fixed
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:29.000]  the poor stay poor
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  the rich get rich
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  that's how it goes
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  everybody
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:41.000]  if obama was a jfk
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:43.000]  or a bobby
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  they would have whacked him
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  or will whacked him
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:49.000]  she looked at his advisors
[2:32:49.000 --> 2:32:51.000]  his policies his plans
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  and armed youth brigades
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:55.000]  environmental brigades
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:32:57.000]  flesh that out
[2:32:57.000 --> 2:32:59.000]  expand that
[2:32:59.000 --> 2:33:01.000]  tattletale squads youth brigades
[2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:03.000]  the war on terror will continue but overlaid
[2:33:03.000 --> 2:33:05.000]  with a new quote environmentalism
[2:33:05.000 --> 2:33:07.000]  people slashing suv tires
[2:33:07.000 --> 2:33:09.000]  it's all intensifying right now
[2:33:09.000 --> 2:33:11.000]  towards the movement of barack obama
[2:33:13.000 --> 2:33:15.000]  the essence of a top down dictatorship
[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:17.000]  is what you've seen
[2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:19.000]  the fbi comes and harasses you
[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:21.000]  fascism is different fascism is a gang of
[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:23.000]  goons
[2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:25.000]  who are probably environmentalists at this point
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:27.000]  decide that you're a polluter
[2:33:27.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  and they come and burn you out and beat you up
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:31.000]  or kill you and this is the difference
[2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:33.000]  see there's a lot of stuff on the internet
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:35.000]  there's this book by jonah goldberg
[2:33:35.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  there are these things by naomi
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  wolf i think her name is
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  there's a guy called brit who tells
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  the ten ways you can tell if you're in fascism
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  what they all leave out
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:47.000]  is the mass movement
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  the grass roots bottom up
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  left cover radical cover
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  anti-establishment
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  anti-authoritarian movement
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  which is the essence of fascism
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  otherwise you don't need a new term
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  for fascism why you have to coin this
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  in the 1920s
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  dictatorships of course had been around
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  for a long time
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  between 1919 and 1922
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  put together a movement of
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  radical revolutionary socialists
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  who were interventionists in world war one
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  that's one possible difference
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  although it's not as big a difference
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  as you might think artists intellectuals
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  people who were
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  disgruntled war veterans
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  people who were coming out of the labor
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  movement extremely militant
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  trade union activists
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  and you put that all together under
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  breakdown crisis conditions of depression
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  and of course that's what we've got now
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  this then becomes
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  a messianic fascist style
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  movement because you need a demagogue
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  now the way in which they've done it
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  today is according
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  to a cookbook the cookbook is the
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  Brzezinski Soros
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  national endowment for democracy
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  it's what they did in Georgia
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  in the roses revolution in Tiflis
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  or in Kiev in the Ukraine
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  with the orange revolution at the end of
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  2004 you get a telegenic
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  demagogue you get lots of money
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  lots of narcotics you get
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  rent a mobs and duper mobs
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  of fervently idealistic
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  swarming adolescent students
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  and other people who just don't know
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  what they're doing you get
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  a media swoon you get media whores
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  all over the place bought and paid for
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  you get fake polling
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  and then you get
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  slogans colors
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  a process of branding
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  this stuff typically comes out of the
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  national endowment for democracy
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  the Albert Einstein Institute
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  and a guy called Jean Sharp
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  in Cambridge Massachusetts
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  along with an army colonel who works
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  with him so they've perfected this
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  for use in the former Soviet
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  space now what happened at the beginning
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  of this year was the model of the people
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  power coup or CIA
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  color revolution was brought home
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  into the United States and that is what allowed
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  Obama to get this insurmountable
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  lead by gaming the crazy
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  rules of the Democratic
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  party but again focus on
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  the mass movement fascism
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  is worse than a reactionary
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  government people who lived through 1922
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  in Italy the seizure of power
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  by Mussolini or the 1933
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  seizure of power by Hitler
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  will say there is just no comparison
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  between some bourgeois
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  government no matter how
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  corrupt how repressive
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  how bellicose because it runs out
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  of gas very soon and then collapses
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  back and then you get fascism
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  but a fascist system
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  is like a wildfire with
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  50 mile an hour winds when things
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  is a tenor box it just feeds itself
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  and exponentially grows
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  yes and of course ultimately after
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  the fascist seized power
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  they then proceed to destroy all the
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  resistance institutions in the society
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  they go around and again
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  smash you if they decide you're a polluter
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:53.000]  or if you're a you know you don't
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  know that you know you're not appreciating
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  barky Obama enough they come after
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:36:59.000]  you they beat you up they harass you
[2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:01.000]  it's it's going on on the internet right now
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  I mean you have these Obama trolls
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  some of them are apparently
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  in Gaza some of them are in
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  Bangalore India or other places
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  he's got a storm up Thailand
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  he's got stormtroopers on the internet
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  who go around trying to wipe
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  out resistance on the internet now
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  they'll be a they'll come at a time when
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  that goes into the streets and these
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  these well they've also announced in
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  Canada England Australia
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  France that they're now going
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  directly to shutting off the old web
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  and just not these are the ISPs
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  major ones not letting
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  you get on the web anymore and only letting
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  you go to sites they want a few thousand
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  I mean it's all happening now everything
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  is coming down and I agree with you
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  Barack Obama's bought and paid for by the same
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  people and he does have that mass appeal
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  which is very dangerous
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  but again I just want to be clear
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  you have the Zbigniew Brzezinski people also
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  running the McCain camp
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  but let's look at the difference
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  I'm just saying I'm not voting for either one
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  we need to expose both of them because if you
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:01.000]  say Barack Obama's bad and lay all this
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  stuff out that you're saying that's true
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  I'm talking about psychology here then
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  they're going to go oh my god you're for
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  John McCain you have to first go to them
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  and say John McCain's new world order
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  John McCain represents the neocons
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  and Israel and hold on and hold on
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  and then you got the Rockefeller power axis
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  the Brzezinski with this
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  demagogue Barack Obama
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  and then as long as you explain that both
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  of them are bad then they go oh I see
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  but if you aggress
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  and attack their demagogue
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  just on the face and say McCain's better
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  you have just actually energized
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  through the left right paradigm mechanism
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  what's been ingrained in people
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  Barack Obama I want you to address that
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  well let's look at it first of all if you get Obama
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  you're going to get Obama
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  as a 1000% puppet of trilateral
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  Bilderberg Rockefeller Soros
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  plus
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  a fanatical democratic congress
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  this will give you the fascist corporate state
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  and in very very short order
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  it'll be like Carter but a 1000%
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  worse
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  now suppose you get McCain here's my analysis on McCain
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  you will get
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  a tired old lame duck
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  the transition will begin
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  on January 20th
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  he'll be a transitional figure in some ways
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  like Ratzinger in the Vatican
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  somebody who's so old
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  that he won't be there he'll be a one-termer
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:19.000]  and he'll be a lame duck as soon as he gets into office
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  and he will face
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  a ferociously hostile democratic congress
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  and that will give you gridlock
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  now that I think is
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  that's under that scenario
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  gridlock separation of power
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  being accentuated is good
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  but wait a minute I think there's something better
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  I'm part of the Puma movement here
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  we have the Puma movement
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  you can go to Puma 08
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  we're holding a convention here in Washington
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  on August 8th
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  Hillary will save us starbly
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  no it's basically stop Obama
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  and how do you stop Obama
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  it would be nice to be able to stop Obama
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  in some ideal way
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  but in the real world that we have now
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  you've got to say the only way to do it
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  is a hundred and seventy five delegates
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  shift out of the Obama column
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  and into the Hillary Clinton
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  but Hillary politically doesn't have the will to do that
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  and would be destroyed by the media if she tries
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  could be, I mean we'll soon find out
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  that's perfectly plausible but I think this is worth a try
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  because if you've got a lame duck
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  Hillary and a lame duck
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  I mean obviously 9% of
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  the Congress, the elite knows the system is discredited
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  both parties are discredited
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  they've got to give you a new brown face
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  to confuse everybody
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  oh look it's changed, he's a black guy
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  and I certainly see what they're doing
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  and they've even said, pundits have said
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  this will bring people back into government
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  back to the table, back believing in the system
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  then there'll be another
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  revolution in the next four years
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  against his socialism as it'll be built
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  then you'll get a new right wing government
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  which I think is their real final plan
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  I think ultimately and this is that you're right
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  because that's what Samuel Lentington has been
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  writing over the years
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  eventually what you'll get after that is a right wing
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  fascism that will look much more like
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  what people think of as the Hitler regime
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  but in the meantime look
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  the thing with Mrs. Clinton is simply this
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  she has now been
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  royally betrayed
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:09.000]  she has been stabbed in the back by the entire
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  Wall Street group
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  the media have turned against her
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  she's nursing tremendous grudges
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  she would actually be
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  more independent than any of the three
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  McCain is somebody who can be controlled
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  through rage states
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  this is how they controlled Harry Truman
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  Obama, we've seen it, he's a complete puppet
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  Mrs. Clinton was already
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  less of a puppet to begin with
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  because of a sense of personal identity
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  drawn from the years in the White House
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  and the things that she's done
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  she is part of the establishment of course
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  but that means she's established
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  she's not somebody from nowhere
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  or Jimmy who, that the trilateral commissioners
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  has brought forward
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  you could argue that when Clinton got to Washington
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  in 1992, he was a puppet
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  of Pamela Churchill Harriman
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  and her group, the Democrats for the 1980s
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  but she's long dead
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  so these people have taken on something of a life of their own
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  by winning elections and so forth
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  the thing with Mrs. Clinton is
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  I mean come on, Clinton towards CIA
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  being handled, going back to the London office
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  by Cord Meyer in the 60s
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  sure, but again, that
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  neither here nor there, right now
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  these are people who have made their own way
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  and you know, Cord Meyer is also long gone
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  so those control
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  no, I'm just saying where they came from
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  is directly out of the military industrial complex
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  dropping as a false left
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  little black hole to suck everybody into
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  partly here's the deal
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  everything you're saying I believe
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  I've already checked myself
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  I respect you, I brought you on my radio show
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  tried to build your job
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  took you and put you on C-Span
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  and so I'm not attacking you here
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  but I have to bring this up to you
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  and I can play the clips, I don't really want to dig them up
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  and play them, it's too painful for me to watch
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  but I haven't really talked to you in about a year
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  after those speeches you gave in Canada
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  what was on Calgary
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  and some other ones saying Ron Paul is a fascist
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  run by fascist, they're planning on
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:42:59.000]  no, no, no, I got the clips
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:01.000]  I don't think fascist, no
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  I'm going to actually
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  I didn't take the time to dig those out
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:07.000]  are you saying, Webster, that you didn't give a speech
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  in Canada where you said
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  racist, fascist
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:13.000]  are behind Ron Paul
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:15.000]  and the elite? I don't think so
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  my critique of Ron Paul, I think so
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  this is ancient history now
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  but here's the thing, Ron Paul was useful
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  in the sense of having a Republican
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  saying that he was against the Iraq war
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  in other words having a wrecking ball
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  inside the Republican debates was a good thing
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  however, now we have
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  a world economic breakdown crisis
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  the kind of economics that Ron Paul represents
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  is straight, Milton Friedman
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  Chicago School
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:41.000]  I would call it
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  Herbert Hoover Economics
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  what it is
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  is classical economics we've had
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  and it's the Austrian
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  School of Economics
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  it's a foreign entity
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  this guy from Hayek who founded the school
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:43:57.000]  was a paid apologist
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  for rent gouges
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  stop, stop, stop
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  I want to skip over this in a minute
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  no, no, no, I don't think I said that
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  you're not stupid, you speak three or four languages
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  you're a smart guy, you know what you said
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  in Canada and on your own radio show
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  on this network, so I'm going to ask you again
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  do you remember saying racist and fascist
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  and are behind Ron Paul
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  I doubt it, but again
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  I'd be happy to stand corrected if I did it
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  anyway, but the politics
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  we're going to take these comments, listeners will
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  they're going to take those videos, they're going to put it together
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  I mean right now I'm asking you why you said that
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  instead of ducking it
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  because I think that Ron
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  if Ron Paul ever got into power this would be a disaster
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  I think on the other hand
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  Ron Paul as a protest vote is a fine thing
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  wait a minute, you said it was anti-Mexican
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  racist
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  and that that too was supporting him
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  and a bunch of others
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:49.000]  he went very far into mexophobia certainly
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  and I think that's
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  what are you talking about, Brzezinski and all of them want
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:55.000]  30 million illegals here
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:44:57.000]  blowing out the social welfare net
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  we're not against the Mexicans, there's a hundred
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:01.000]  million of them coming into the country
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  they've been nationalized
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:05.000]  they're very nationalistic, we're like a country that doesn't have
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:07.000]  any of its white blood cells
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  like we have AIDS or something
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  and then they come in with incredibly strong nationalistic
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:13.000]  immune systems
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:15.000]  politically and it's overtaking our country
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:17.000]  and bankrupting it
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:19.000]  and I'm sick of seeing 12 towns in Texas
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  fly Mexican flags at their courthouses
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  and saying whites aren't allowed here
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  and I'm tired of the special treatment
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  the government gives the illegals
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:29.000]  I guess that's because I don't like Mexicans
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  and that's not what it is, it's very painful
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  to have to expose
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  you speak Spanish, pal, so does my wife
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  she lived in Spain for six years
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  and let me tell you, she hears what's on the Mexican radio
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:41.000]  and our government's behind that
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  look, here's the thing
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  let's compare this to Jeremiah Wright
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  everybody saw Jeremiah Wright
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:49.000]  right, Obama's preacher
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:51.000]  now the theology
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  of Jeremiah Wright
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:55.000]  and his entire mindset
[2:45:55.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  is a foundation
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:45:59.000]  funded counterinsurgency
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:01.000]  strategy, in this case it's the Ford Foundation
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  they wanted to radicalize blacks
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  to make them violent so that they couldn't do
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  what Gandhi did, I agree
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  but Ron Paul, hold on
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  I want you to answer Ron Paul's stuff
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:13.000]  because repeat what you said in Canada
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:15.000]  about Ron Paul here on my show
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:17.000]  I don't know, I'd have to look at you
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:19.000]  partly you said it on your radio show
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  on this network, everyone tearing their hair out
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  and letting you, leaving you alone to do it
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  and you know full well, just don't insult my intelligence
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  I like you Tarbley, but don't insult my intelligence
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  I want you to answer
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:31.000]  for what you said about Dr. Paul
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:33.000]  because I know he's a good man
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:35.000]  as an individual I suppose
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:37.000]  he's a good man, but
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  obviously there was a great disappointment with 9-11 truth
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  for example, he said that he was in favor
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:43.000]  of 9-11 truth and he went on television
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  and he repudiated 9-11 truth
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  and he said it was preposterous
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:49.000]  and he told us to stop doing it
[2:46:49.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  because it was an embarrassment to him
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  and I agree, that was a betrayal
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:55.000]  okay, so you know
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:46:57.000]  good man, but a human being
[2:46:57.000 --> 2:46:59.000]  but that doesn't mean the fascists are behind him
[2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:01.000]  it doesn't mean he wants to throw Mexicans
[2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:03.000]  into wells
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:05.000]  fascists, but I don't know
[2:47:05.000 --> 2:47:07.000]  why this comes in
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:09.000]  but the point is
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:11.000]  the Ford Foundation
[2:47:11.000 --> 2:47:13.000]  in addition to creating organizations
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:15.000]  in the black community like Jeremiah Wright
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:17.000]  in addition to creating similar organizations
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:19.000]  in every ethnic group
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:21.000]  the foundation has created
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:23.000]  these crazy Mexican groups
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  the group that puts out the map
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  that all the Southwest is going to be
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  annexed to Mexico
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:31.000]  that is a pure foundation
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:33.000]  funded provocation
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  and instead of responding
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  to that at that level
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  it would be important first of all
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  to continuously denounce the fact
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  that this is the Ford Foundation
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:45.000]  and it's associated foundations
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  and secondly try to organize
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  in other words try to offer them
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  some kind of a united front
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  where they'd be fighting for something worthwhile
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  because what they don't get out of this
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  excellent nonsense is they don't get a minimum wage
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  they don't get decent
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  no, they get to turn the U.S. into Mexico City
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  and exactly
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  and the U.S. uses a steam valve
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  to stop true revolution
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  reform in Mexico
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:11.000]  all I want is to understand why you were saying these things
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  because I agree with everything you just said right there
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  if you want to have me
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  send me a transcript or send me a recording
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  of what I said and I'll be glad to
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  pull it up here in just a minute but go ahead
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  but I don't have it at the top of my head
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  anyway the point was
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  that that kind of Herbert Hoover economics
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  is exactly what you don't need
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  and if you say today under this condition
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  we have a dollar crisis
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  we have the death agony of a dollar
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  we have a banking panic going on
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  we have dollar hyperinflation
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  we have a systemic breakdown crisis of the entire system
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  if you say under these conditions
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  I want the market
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  this means death on a huge scale
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  the only possible policy
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  under these conditions is
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  to try to get control of the federal government
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  and use it against Wall Street
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  because if you don't do that Wall Street
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  will take control of the federal government
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  they're going to suck your eye they're going to give us no quarter
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  so I would say to Ron Paul
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  stop attacking the government
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:07.000]  start attacking Wall Street attack Goldman Sachs
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  they're responsible for about 40%
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  he's always attacking them
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  he does whenever
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  what do you think he does when the Fed chairman is in there every month
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  yeah I saw the ads he put on television
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  the ad was attacking the Mexicans
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  he showed that people swimming across the Rio Grande
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  and this was his first TV ad
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  and I thought that was just
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:27.000]  that was not his first TV ad
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  and it's a major issue
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  to energize this campaign
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  and it's a good issue
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  well I don't think it's a good issue
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  and I think it didn't prove to be a good issue
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  people thought it would be a good issue
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  the TV ad that's for Barack Obama
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  was against Ron Paul
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  and so that's more proof he was the man
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  stay there we're going to skip this break for infowars.com
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  there's a list on the web for everybody else
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  we're going to be right back
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  for all our fine AM and FM affiliates
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  in just three minutes I'm Alex Jones
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  prisonplanet.com infowars.com
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  we have author Webster Tarpley with us
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  okay let's keep going Tarpley
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:03.000]  keep going
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  so on what?
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  I want to finish up on Ron Paul
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  okay you want more Ron Paul?
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  yeah I mean I want to hear you defend that stuff
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  you were saying oh by the way let me ask you
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  where was it a year ago
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  where you threw down the gauntlet on Paul
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:19.000]  was it in Calgary because I'm trying to google the term
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  I'm sorry I don't know
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  you were in Canada where were you a year ago in Canada
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  I don't know there was Vancouver British Columbia
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  Vancouver there we go
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  that was it I'm going to find it right now go ahead Tarpley
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  alright wonderful
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  the point is what you need now is basically
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  a version of New Deal economics
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  and this I think is
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  something that would revolve for example around foreclosures
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  Ron Paul went on Larry Kudlow
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  on CNBC
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  and he said he didn't believe in bailing out
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  people who had bought too much house
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  well
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  what you've got to do under these circumstances is
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  a uniform federal law that says simply
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:55.000]  no foreclosures
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  stop all foreclosures
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  and take it from there
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  so Ron Paul I don't think would support that
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  because that would be big government from his point of view
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  you should outlaw foreclosures
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  for five years of the duration of the crisis
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  of homes, farms, businesses
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  and everything else that's useful
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  economically
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  you should outlaw adjustable rate mortgages
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:17.000]  you should outlaw derivatives
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:19.000]  the current crisis that's going on
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  is a crisis of
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  one quadrillion dollars of derivatives
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  and there is no way out of that
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  unless you simply wipe them out
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  you've got to shred them
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  you've got to delete them
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  out of the world because you cannot bail out
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  a capital structure that is that huge
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  so
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  I never heard Ron Paul
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  talking about any of this stuff
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:43.000]  another thing you'd need to do
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  is to begin to shift the tax burden
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  it is unrealistic in the extreme
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  to talk about abolishing the federal income tax
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:51.000]  the only thing you can do
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  is to shift the tax burden
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:55.000]  off the individual taxpayer
[2:51:55.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  and onto Wall Street
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  how about a Tobin tax
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:01.000]  transfer tax
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:03.000]  one percent on the entire turnover
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  of Wall Street financial
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  security
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  money transfer tax
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  securities transfer tax
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  with every transaction
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  sales tax for Wall Street
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  what's the sales tax in Texas Alex?
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  seven percent
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  if you can pay seven percent how come Wall Street
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  can't pay one percent
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  make that a demand and that's on everything that goes through
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  well that would slow down a lot of
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  the blind pudding and all the rest of it
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  absolutely and you'd apply that in Chicago too
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  and one if it's a quadrillion
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  quadrillion dollars of derivatives
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  and maybe two thirds of that in the U.S.
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  say 650 trillion
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:41.000]  if you take one percent of that you get
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  6.5 trillion of tax revenue
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  that would go a long way
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:47.000]  towards guaranteeing the permanent future
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  of social security, Medicare,
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:51.000]  Medicaid and the entire
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  social safety net which I think are absolutely
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  indispensable Ron Paul thinks that
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:57.000]  these are things to get rid of
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  we're coming back live right now
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  here we go
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  I just want a free country
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  to raise my family
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  but now we go into
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  waters
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:35.000]  very dangerous
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  crises
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  we're headed into
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  Dwarf World War II and World War I
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:43.000]  combined
[2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  we do agree with that statement and now expanding
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  where do you see things going
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  how do you see the election turning out
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:51.000]  currently with the trends
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  we see Barack Obama going and kneeling
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  before Bernanke in little secret meetings
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:53:57.000]  that's in the news today
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  we hear he's going for this particular governor
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  what do you know about him
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:03.000]  well, that's Governor Kane here in Virginia
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  he's not distinguished
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  I think the main thing of course is Obama
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:09.000]  the point about the election
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  is this is not yet determined
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:13.000]  this is open-ended and we better
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  seize the time
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  the big thing is the scandal dossiers
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  Obama does not run on issues
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  Obama runs on the fact that he's a messiah
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  therefore if you try to fight him on issues
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  you've got to tear down the messiah
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  that means ad hominem attacks, scandals
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  and all the rest
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  here are the scandals that I see
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  one is the Chicago corruption
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  Rezco, Alchi, Al Samari
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  the three Levantines
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  the three Syrian or Iraqi Arabs
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  that are behind him
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  and these are all three convicted felons
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  all three embezzlers on a grand scale
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  millions and millions, hundreds of millions
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  of dollars in some cases
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  that's part of his financial machine
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  the weathermen terrorists
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  the bombers, Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dorn
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  and a whole clique of other
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:54:59.000]  unreconstructed, unrepentant
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  weathermen who are part of his machine
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  and his personal advisors
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  Ayers is probably the guy who gave Obama
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:07.000]  the biggest break he ever got
[2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  in his career, that's the second level
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  third level is this
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  what I call the Ford Foundation church
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  of the final counter-insurgency
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  in other words Trinity United Church of Christ
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  Jeremiah Wright, Dwight Hopkins
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  the fellow, Otis Moss
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:23.000]  the third and the Ford Foundation
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  Grant recipient, James Cohn
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  that is this black liberation theology
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  which is essentially a doctrine
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  of hatred and
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  to perpetuate racial conflict rather than
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  to get rid of it
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  another level, Larry Sinclair
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  and Donald Young
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  the choir master of that church
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  found dead
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  right before Christmas of last year
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  he was the gay choir master in Wright's church
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  Larry Sinclair
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  is a gay man who said that he had a homosexual encounter
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  twice
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  with Obama in 1999
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  with Obama using crack cocaine
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  I would urge people to look into Larry Sinclair
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  his allegations
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  it's been up on the internet since
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  the middle of January
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  millions and millions of hits on that
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  he gave a press conference here at the National Press Club
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  and was then arrested
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  arrested on a warrant signed by Beau Biden
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  the attorney general of Delaware
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  son of Joe Biden
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  the senator who's trying to become
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  the vice president
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  it's trumped up charges
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  but they're continuing to persecute him
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  Larry Sinclair is in danger
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  and he deserves the support of people
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  who don't want to have a presidential campaign
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  under Gestapo conditions
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  another layer, Ilya Sakhmadoff
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  is a Chechen ambassador
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  of the Chechen terrorist group
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  they've killed more than a thousand people
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  Ilya Sakhmadoff is living here in Washington
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  at US government expense
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  taxpayer expense
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  he gets an apartment, a secretary
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  an office, a travel budget
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:53.000]  a PR budget and a nice stipend
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  that most people could not afford
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  and the reason he's here is because Big New Brzezinski lobbied
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  because Big New Brzezinski is so consumed
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  by hatred of Russia that he wants Akhmadoff here
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  and others
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  and then we have this Get Whitey tape
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  the famous Hate Whitey tape by
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  Michelle Obama
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  which is clearly in the air
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  and is likely to be brought out
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  after the Democratic Convention is over
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  I would just say to the people on the Republican side
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:19.000]  don't be like that Japanese admiral
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  at the Battle of Midway
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:23.000]  trying to get everything perfect before you launch the attack
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  because you might get hit first
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  as the Elliott Spitzer case shows
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  so that tape is in the background
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  so we've got at least six or seven layers
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  Webster, stay there, we just got 20 minutes left
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  we're going to open the phones up
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  and we'll start at 9.25 at 9, 9231

[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:44.000]  Hey Tarpley.
[2:59:44.000 --> 2:59:47.000]  Have you seen my new film Endgame yet?
[2:59:47.000 --> 2:59:48.000]  I'm afraid I haven't.
[2:59:48.000 --> 2:59:50.000]  I've been just doing Obama World of World Obama.
[2:59:50.000 --> 2:59:52.000]  Let me tell you one thing though Alex.
[2:59:52.000 --> 2:59:53.000]  In Amsterdam.
[2:59:53.000 --> 2:59:58.000]  I was just in Amsterdam Holland last Tuesday to give a talk in the series.
[2:59:58.000 --> 3:00:00.000]  They had their docs at the docs.
[3:00:00.000 --> 3:00:02.000]  They had it every couple of months.
[3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:03.000]  They had Cynthia McKinney.
[3:00:03.000 --> 3:00:04.000]  They had a few others.
[3:00:04.000 --> 3:00:06.000]  Eventually they got to me.
[3:00:06.000 --> 3:00:13.000]  The main anti-Bilderberg publisher in the Netherlands is a guy called Rene van Pracht.
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  He gave me an idea that I wanted to share with you.
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:19.000]  That you should write a book.
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:21.000]  In addition to everything else you've done.
[3:00:21.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  You should somehow boil down your approach to things into a book.
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:30.000]  And he would be interested in looking into it with you.
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:32.000]  He's put out a tremendous thing.
[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  It's a comic book called Agent Orange.
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  It's an attack on Prince Bernard, the founder of the Bilderberger group.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:46.000]  Showing Bernard as an SA Stormtrooper and otherwise Nazi back in the 1920s and 30s.
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:50.000]  The guy's got some pretty good things going in his publishing house.
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:54.000]  Maybe you need to get into the book dimension in addition to everything else.
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:58.000]  I did put Descent and Detering out.
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:00.000]  We are working on a book right now.
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:02.000]  1974 to 1776 is the name of it.
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  It's basically an overview of everything we do and what our philosophy is.
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  That's a good idea.
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  Let's cover any other issues you think are important before we take calls.
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  Just one more. People can keep on top of it.
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  The face of false flag terrorism in the future.
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:22.000]  I don't think it's going to be Islamic fundamentalists anymore.
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  The only place they use Islamic fundamentalism now is to invade northwest Pakistan.
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  Let me just take off a bunch of faces and then you can put together a composite of the next false flag.
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  One of the reasons the ruling elite wants Obama is they think with Obama you could do false flag again.
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  Because Obama could say it and then they would believe it.
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:48.000]  Whereas if McCain or Hillary said it, they wouldn't believe it.
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  That was in the Atlantic Monthly from Andrew Sullivan.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  The new face. The unabomber. Ecological terrorism.
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  Earth first. This kind of stuff.
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  Secondly, the guy that I just mentioned.
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  Elias Ahmadov as a figure for Chechen terrorism.
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:06.000]  And of course it's not just Chechen terrorism against the Russians.
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  But it's every little group. The Basques. The Kurds.
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  It's every group that wants dignity. This is Brzezinski's slogan.
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:21.000]  Is that everybody deserves a mini-state or a microstate according to their own personal characteristics.
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  That of course means the Balkanization of the world.
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  So that J.P. Morgan Chase and the Exxon Mobil can run wild.
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  That's the Roman management system.
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  Yes. And again, the Bernard Lewis plan of course. Just Balkanization. Right. Divide and conquer.
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:40.000]  Kazmirchak. Remember him? The northern Illinois shooter.
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  The guy who was a student who had left wing social concerns.
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:48.000]  He was concerned about social justice.
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  And of course Cho. The shooter at Virginia Tech.
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  A psychotic student. But of course look at him.
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  He looks like he's Chinese. He's Korean but close enough.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  He's not a Manchurian shooter. He's a Korean shooter right next door.
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  So a Chinese who's crazy and who's shooting.
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:10.000]  Another one. Litvinenko. Litvinenko of the KGB.
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:14.000]  Remember him? The Radiological Terrorism case in London.
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  So a Russian with nuclear terrorism.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  And then finally this FARC. The Betancourt.
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  They did the whole media circus around this guerrilla movement supported to some degree by Venezuela.
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:30.000]  Or at least verbally. That operates inside Colombia.
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  The goal there is typical Brzezinski. When a neocon looks at Venezuela.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:37.000]  The neocon says, bomb them right away. Invade them.
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  Brzezinski says, you can't do that. You're too weak. You're too bankrupt. You're too isolated. Don't do it.
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  All right, Webster. We're going to take this break and come back with you in the final segment.
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:48.000]  And take phone calls. Everybody stay with us.
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  We're interviewing the author of Obama. The Postmodern Coup. Webster Riventarmely.

[3:04:58.000 --> 3:05:05.000]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us. I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without even knowing they've been robbed.
[3:05:05.000 --> 3:05:06.000]  How so, Clyde?
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:15.000]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet. Just by waving it near you, I can skin your credit card information while your card is still in your purse. Just watch.
[3:05:15.000 --> 3:05:19.000]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen. You gotta be kidding me.
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:26.000]  Nope. With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune. As long as people don't hear about identity stronghold.
[3:05:26.000 --> 3:05:28.000]  Why? What's identity stronghold?
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:34.000]  They make the secure sleeve. When people keep their credit cards in the shielded secure sleeve, I can't read them.
[3:05:34.000 --> 3:05:37.000]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:41.000]  No way. Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:44.000]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[3:05:44.000 --> 3:05:47.000]  I already got some. I also got some to fit our passports.
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:52.000]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:05:54.000]  idstronghold.com?
[3:05:54.000 --> 3:05:59.000]  Right. Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[3:05:59.000 --> 3:06:08.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do. At least we thought we did.
[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:15.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:06:15.000 --> 3:06:24.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the AG made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:49.000]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[3:06:49.000 --> 3:06:52.000]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:06:58.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:06:58.000 --> 3:07:06.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:10.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:07:10.000 --> 3:07:23.000]  Final segment with Webster Griffin Tarbley.
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  I did find his Canada speech.
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:33.000]  Very interesting to say the least.
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:37.000]  You just type into Google v911truth.org and you can watch it.
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:41.000]  It's very interesting watching some clips during the breaks, but I did identify and find that.
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:49.000]  But I can understand his fears and looking for the establishment trying to find some popular movement to hijack.
[3:07:49.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  But that certainly wasn't Ron Paul.
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:55.000]  That certainly wasn't what we saw there and that was clear to me.
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:08:02.000]  And I think he's been very, very healthy for the planet and for people out there to think and understand the Federal Reserve.
[3:08:02.000 --> 3:08:03.000]  It's not their friend.
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:05.000]  The inflation tax, everything that's happening.
[3:08:05.000 --> 3:08:09.000]  Peggy Lynn, Don, Nina and others here in a moment Webster in the 15 minutes or so we have left.
[3:08:09.000 --> 3:08:11.000]  14 minutes we have left with you.
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:18.000]  But in closing, what do you think is going to happen with the economy?
[3:08:18.000 --> 3:08:21.000]  What are the bankers that own the planet planning to do with that?
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:26.000]  We know it's a carbon tax paid directly to them and some other things, but I want Webster Tarbley's take on that.
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:35.000]  Well, the Obama program, as he suggested in that no SUVs, no eating as much as you want, no setting the temperature where you want,
[3:08:35.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  is going to be extreme austerity, but with left cover for the polar bears to save the planet.
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  Global warming this entire demagogic package of Al Gore and Prince Charles.
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:53.000]  So he'll be demanding global austerity for global warming.
[3:08:53.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  By the way, let me just show people this. This is infowars.net story.
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  British kids encourage you to become climate cops, ads on all the major newspapers saying report on your parents,
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:04.000]  create a dossier on them, watch them, report on them.
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  They wear red, black and white uniforms with khaki Nazi outfits and there's a polar bear there behind them.
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:13.000]  Who's their buddy?
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  Or a panda, of course.
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:26.000]  So anyway, it's going to be killer austerity, crushing austerity. My calculation is the U.S. living standard is already down 60% from the LBJ period approximately.
[3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  And now they'd like to cut that in half again under the auspices now of left cover.
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:39.000]  If there's a strike wave, they want Obama in the White House to be able to break a nationwide strike wave or general strike,
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:43.000]  which might well emerge and on the global scale it's the same thing.
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  Now none of this will make any difference because remember what's coming down is 1,000 trillion of derivatives.
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:53.000]  One quadrillion of derivatives have gone into reverse leverage.
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:10:03.000]  And the total crisis, according to other economics economists we talked to, is 6,000 trillion.
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  6,000 trillion.
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  Well, that's an interesting figure.
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  I'm just going, if I'm going by derivatives and I think the best estimate I could get is about one quadrillion.
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  So it's 1,000 trillion.
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:22.000]  But I would perfectly, I was assuming to me that it would probably be up to 1.2, 1.5 if we're up to 6.
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  Who says 6, Alex?
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  Well, I've had a lot of different guests on saying the total amount of debt packages, credit cards, mortgages,
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  all the different types of derivatives and leveraging out there, they say it's around 6,000 trillion.
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  So we're talking 6 quadrillion.
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  Well, that of course makes it even worse.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  You can see the value of the...
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  No, you're right. I mean, you're right. They say with just derivatives alone, certain types were at 1,000.
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  Well, this obviously is a black hole that can consume the earth because the total value of the planet earth and everything in it
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:58.000]  at current rates is about 100 trillion at the very most.
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  So 6,000 trillion, you can see you're just out of the ballpark.
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:07.000]  There is no way to use austerity to prop up these bankrupt structures.
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:10.000]  No, they're just preparing us to be slaves.
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  But they're going to try and it will fail.
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  So you'll have basically the decline of civilization unless somebody stops it.
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:22.000]  Now, in the middle of all that though, I would say, remember, defeat the number one option of Wall Street.
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:27.000]  It's clearly Obama. Obama is the facelift for imperialism. He's the credibility for false flag.
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  He's the ability to carry out austerity and strike breaking on the home front.
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  If you defeat Obama, you will have defeated the entire banking establishment and the controlled corporate media.
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  That would then lead to an open field period.
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  Again, if it were McCain, it would be a period of intense fighting and gridlock between the Congress and the president,
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  which would be ideal for radicalizing things, in my view, in a new deal direction
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:59.000]  so that you'd get powerful measures for economic recovery that cannot be this free market stuff,
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  but have to be powerful state interventions to get things going again.
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:08.000]  In other words, what worked in the 1930s and what would work again is distinct from,
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:10.000]  well, Bush is a reincarnation.
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:14.000]  Yeah, we'll see. I disagree with you on the web, but I agree with everything you've said about the world,
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  you know, geopolitical landscape, what's happening, who's behind what.
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  And just like Ron Paul disagrees with you, I disagree with your solution of more government.
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:28.000]  Now, I understand, you know, the magical plan of angels in government
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:31.000]  that would direct the largesse towards the people and redistribute it.
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  It isn't going to work.
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  You know, the Neural Water Crowd controlled the left and the right.
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:40.000]  They controlled the attempted fascist coup with the Bush's grandfather behind it,
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  and they controlled FDR.
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  And so that's where we really differ, Webster.
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  I want to go. I think it's a mistake to say they controlled FDR. They tried to kill him
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  even before we got into office with that attempted assassination in Miami,
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:56.000]  and then they tried to organize the Morgan coup to overthrow him.
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  As the McCormick-Dickstein committee showed, let's go ahead and talk to Peggy in Pennsylvania.
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:05.000]  Peggy, you're on the air.
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  Alex, sometimes lately I'm beginning to think that this show is just another disinformation show,
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:15.000]  and I'll tell you why. It's much to do about nothing.
[3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:19.000]  Ron Paul came along, and he seemed to be the perfect candidate for the typical American,
[3:13:19.000 --> 3:13:23.000]  intelligent as well as just a normal type of guy.
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:28.000]  But all of a sudden, he steps down with no, and it was a surprise to all of us.
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:29.000]  Mr. Tarpley...
[3:13:29.000 --> 3:13:32.000]  Hold on, hold on, man. You made quite a claim here.
[3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  Ron Paul lost, and you asked...
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:39.000]  We all asked him to run, so we can't be mad at him for not, quote, winning,
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  but he did win tens of millions of hearts and minds,
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:45.000]  and people did find out about the New World Order and the North American Union
[3:13:45.000 --> 3:13:47.000]  and the trans-Texas corridor that's in trouble now.
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:49.000]  I mean, that's just an amazing...
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  We have all different types of guests and ideas here,
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:56.000]  and this is a place for you to think, a place for you to find information and check what we say.
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  I mean, I'm doing the best I can. I'm working 18 hours a day here.
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  Alex, he lost because of the corruption in the government.
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  I'm not going to mention any previous...
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:09.000]  How are we bad right now? I want to hear it from you.
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  All right, I'll tell you. I saw the takeover of Ohio from my own perspective,
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  and I know who did it. I won't mention any names or anything like that.
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:23.000]  But there is a force behind this that is not being mentioned.
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  And Mr. Tarpley, for instance, claims that he wants...
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:28.000]  Hillary is a substitute because she's easier...
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:31.000]  Wait a minute, ma'am. Let me ask you a question, Peggy.
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:33.000]  Did we screen your phone call?
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  Ah, yeah. He knew it was me, if that's what you're asking.
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:37.000]  Pardon me?
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  The guy that answered me knows my voice, and he knew it was me.
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:43.000]  Let's bring John in here right now, ma'am. We don't screen phone calls.
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:45.000]  Alex, please don't do this.
[3:14:45.000 --> 3:14:47.000]  Are you a schizophrenic? Let me guess.
[3:14:47.000 --> 3:14:51.000]  I bet you think the world revolves around you, and we all know who you are, ma'am.
[3:14:51.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  I don't know you from Adam.
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  Alex, shame on you. Shame on your life.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:55.000]  Are you a schizophrenic?
[3:14:55.000 --> 3:14:57.000]  I never thought that you would do this.
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  You are a schizophrenic, aren't you, you nutcase?
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  How dare you, Alex?
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:03.000]  All right, let her go. Bring John Harmon in here.
[3:15:03.000 --> 3:15:05.000]  You know, I'm tired of these schizophrenics on the Internet.
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:10.000]  I am really sick of them, and they're craziness, and the fact that people will believe them.
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  They call in here. One yesterday called and said the Earth orbits around her,
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:17.000]  and basically they're the Queen of England, and that's the end of it.
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  And they call in here, and then we don't screen your calls, and they lie and say we do.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:23.000]  John Harmon, come in here.
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:25.000]  Yeah, the question was, do we screen calls?
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  And she answered yes. I did recognize her voice because she calls in every day,
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  but that doesn't mean we screen calls.
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:34.000]  We put her on air. I don't know who she is.
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  Yeah, exactly. We put her on air. I asked for her name and where she's called from,
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  and that's it, and she volunteered. She said she disagreed with you and Tarpley,
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  so she went to the head of the line, and that was it.
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  Okay, well, that's a rarity, because I don't recognize her as a routine call that you did know who she was.
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:53.000]  Ma'am, we put her on air for her to then accuse us of being bad,
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:15:55.000]  and it's just a diversion.
[3:15:55.000 --> 3:15:59.000]  The dollar's imploding, everything's falling apart, and a bunch of people out there
[3:15:59.000 --> 3:16:01.000]  can't stay focused on real issues.
[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:02.000]  Yeah, Webster, go ahead.
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  Alex, we have one, we have Schizophrenia, of course, but then we have the most dangerous form of Schizophrenia
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:11.000]  is Megalomania, right, the emperor, Nero, Napoleon, people like this.
[3:16:11.000 --> 3:16:12.000]  And that's what Obama has.
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:14.000]  That's Obama, absolutely.
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:22.000]  Yeah, my whole issue is that, you know, this is a show, a platform for you, the listeners, and our guest,
[3:16:22.000 --> 3:16:27.000]  and I take a call, and it's, you know, we know who she is.
[3:16:27.000 --> 3:16:31.000]  I don't know who you are, ma'am, and that you're saying that we won't say who really runs things,
[3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  but then you won't.
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:35.000]  You could have said whatever you wanted here, but you chose to do that,
[3:16:35.000 --> 3:16:37.000]  and that's part of the meltdown of our society.
[3:16:37.000 --> 3:16:38.000]  Let's talk to Len in Toronto.
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:40.000]  Len, you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:43.000]  Go ahead, Len.
[3:16:43.000 --> 3:16:46.000]  Hi, I'm not an ex-queen at all, I'm just a little...
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:47.000]  Len, did we screen your phone call?
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:51.000]  Nope, you just said, thank you, please hold, I'll put you through.
[3:16:51.000 --> 3:16:53.000]  I'm tired of being accused of this, go ahead.
[3:16:53.000 --> 3:16:57.000]  At no point have you screened my numbers, you know, and that woman, she seems to me,
[3:16:57.000 --> 3:17:02.000]  she could not be specific about anything, you know, and I find the people I'm fighting with up here,
[3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:06.000]  same thing, they hit you with a bunch of things, and I think just trying to make the difference.
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:09.000]  What's happening is some of the zombies are being woken up,
[3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:11.000]  and I'm not trying to be mean to this lady, but I mean others,
[3:17:11.000 --> 3:17:15.000]  and they know the government's bad now, but then they can't tell what else is going on.
[3:17:15.000 --> 3:17:17.000]  Tarpley, you ever run into that?
[3:17:17.000 --> 3:17:19.000]  Well, you have these Obama trolls, right?
[3:17:19.000 --> 3:17:21.000]  That's what I find.
[3:17:21.000 --> 3:17:23.000]  Oh, you think that might be it? She doesn't like it?
[3:17:23.000 --> 3:17:27.000]  Yeah, sure, as soon as you're wrapping Obama, a bunch of trolls come out of the woodwork.
[3:17:27.000 --> 3:17:29.000]  Oh, he didn't win in Ohio, did he?
[3:17:29.000 --> 3:17:35.000]  I'd love to know who took over Ohio, I would have liked to name the names, but maybe another time.
[3:17:35.000 --> 3:17:37.000]  Yeah, but we're censoring here.
[3:17:37.000 --> 3:17:38.000]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[3:17:38.000 --> 3:17:39.000]  Len, anything else?
[3:17:39.000 --> 3:17:42.000]  Yeah, I'm just going to say, you know, you're always talking about the police,
[3:17:42.000 --> 3:17:46.000]  and the fact they're not educated properly, and dangers here, and dangers there,
[3:17:46.000 --> 3:17:50.000]  and no one ever talks about a group of people, like up here in Canada,
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:55.000]  we've got them at the private corporation, and they now have police powers,
[3:17:55.000 --> 3:18:01.000]  and they're very, very anti-public, like very, very anti-the people, and totally unaccountable.
[3:18:01.000 --> 3:18:04.000]  Yeah, they're setting up these citizens' squads, even in England now.
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:07.000]  Oh, well, this comes in the form of what they call a humane society.
[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:13.000]  The Toronto group operated legally for many years, and the government here in Ontario totally sucks up to them.
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:17.000]  Totally, and I'm sitting back and saying why, they don't give a damn about animals.
[3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:19.000]  Why are they supporting groups who couldn't care less?
[3:18:19.000 --> 3:18:21.000]  They've devastated people here in Ontario.
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:23.000]  Well, they'll use something that sounds reasonable, like animals,
[3:18:23.000 --> 3:18:27.000]  to get you in the process of tattling and spying, then they move it over into regular spying.
[3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:29.000]  Do you agree, Webster?
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:33.000]  Again, I think that the big danger right now is this idea of grassroots movements
[3:18:33.000 --> 3:18:37.000]  around extreme ecology, animal rights, anything like this.
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:40.000]  This can become the breeding ground for the next generation of false flesh.
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:44.000]  Folks, the book is Obama, the Post-Modern Coup, Webster Griffin Tartley.
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  Webster, you're doing a great job.
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:49.000]  Let me have you up again in the next few weeks for another interview so we can finish up, okay?
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:51.000]  I'd be delighted, Alex. Thank you very much.
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:53.000]  We're going to call you today and set you back up. Thank you, Webster.
[3:18:53.000 --> 3:18:58.000]  All right, we'll be back. I've got a key Willie Nelson announcement, and then Mark Hornke.
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:19:03.000]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history
[3:19:03.000 --> 3:19:09.000]  comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:12.000]  that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[3:19:12.000 --> 3:19:16.000]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:19.000]  in which family members receive answers to their questions,
[3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:23.000]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[3:19:23.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:30.000]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:34.000]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:50.000]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[3:19:50.000 --> 3:19:53.000]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[3:19:53.000 --> 3:19:58.000]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[3:20:00.000 --> 3:20:02.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[3:20:02.000 --> 3:20:08.000]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, and investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[3:20:08.000 --> 3:20:12.000]  That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[3:20:12.000 --> 3:20:19.000]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:23.000]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments
[3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:27.000]  like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:31.000]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:33.000]  by keeping you in paper.
[3:20:33.000 --> 3:20:38.000]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:43.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[3:20:43.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:48.000]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[3:20:48.000 --> 3:20:52.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[3:20:52.000 --> 3:20:56.000]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:20:56.000 --> 3:21:01.000]  Here I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business.
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:04.000]  When one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me, very concerned.
[3:21:04.000 --> 3:21:07.000]  He says, wow, have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:08.000]  And I said, oh, of course.
[3:21:08.000 --> 3:21:09.000]  Whoo, they're high.
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:11.000]  He says, yeah, he says, what am I going to do?
[3:21:11.000 --> 3:21:12.000]  I've got a truck.
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:14.000]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:16.000]  I really need the truck for my job.
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:18.000]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:20.000]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:22.000]  I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:23.000]  I don't know what to do.
[3:21:23.000 --> 3:21:24.000]  I said, Bob, relax.
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:25.000]  I know what to do.
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:29.000]  Call efoodsdirect.com or go up on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[3:21:29.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  They will deliver food, really good, high quality, nutritional, delicious food to your door,
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:37.000]  your door now, right there in front of your house,
[3:21:37.000 --> 3:21:40.000]  for about half the price that you were paying for groceries last year.
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:43.000]  You can take the savings from that, offset the cost of your fuel,
[3:21:43.000 --> 3:21:48.000]  and use it to buy more inexpensive food to hedge against tomorrow's increasing food prices.
[3:21:48.000 --> 3:21:49.000]  Why don't you do that, Bob?
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:21:51.000]  He said, efoodsdirect.com.
[3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:55.000]  I said, yep, call them at 1-800-409-5633.
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:21:57.000]  That's 800-409-5633.
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:21:58.000]  Do it now.
[3:21:58.000 --> 3:22:04.000]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[3:22:04.000 --> 3:22:09.000]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:14.000]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  This product is a one of a kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:23.000]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:36.000]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:39.000]  and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[3:22:39.000 --> 3:22:44.000]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:50.000]  Order your bottle of Alkavision Plasma pH drops now by going directly to Alkavision.com.
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:23:15.000]  That's Alkavision.com or call 269-344-3420 today.
[3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:42.000]  We're going to be putting out more information by the end of the week, more specifics.
[3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:47.000]  They'll probably hear Willie Nelson back on Friday
[3:23:47.000 --> 3:23:53.000]  or maybe even on the Sunday show to announce it in his own words.
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:24:00.000]  You know, he was here in studio with us last Wednesday.
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:02.000]  We had him on air last Wednesday.
[3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:07.000]  And I had been wanting to have him on about the impeachment hearings about, you know, pushing to not attack Iran.
[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:10.000]  I called him up that Wednesday and said, well, I'll just come on today.
[3:24:10.000 --> 3:24:12.000]  So we had him on and a caller called in.
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  I thought about this privately, but subconsciously didn't want all the work
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:17.000]  and the craziness of a big event.
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:20.000]  Plus, I don't like asking celebrities for things very often.
[3:24:20.000 --> 3:24:25.000]  And the caller says, why don't you have some type of anti-war slash 9-11 truth event?
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  And Willie Nelson said, I do that in a minute.
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:29.000]  So I said, well, let's do it.
[3:24:29.000 --> 3:24:32.000]  And on air he said, OK, let's look at seeing if we can do it.
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:39.000]  And Willie isn't somebody who, I mean, everything you've heard about him is really the way he is.
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:41.000]  I mean, somebody can drive by and flip him off and throw something in his car
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:43.000]  and he'll say, well, that fellow's having a bad day.
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:46.000]  I mean, he's really just a smooth, great guy.
[3:24:46.000 --> 3:24:51.000]  And he's been anti-establishment for a long time, but I've now learned for 10 years.
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:54.000]  He's been listening to the show, watching the TV show in Austin.
[3:24:54.000 --> 3:24:57.000]  He lives here most of the year in Hawaii, the rest of it.
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:24:59.000]  And really woke up to the New World Order.
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:05.000]  And then I was having an event a few, I guess about eight months ago when Endgame came out.
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:07.000]  And all of a sudden people said, Willie Nelson's here.
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:08.000]  And I was like, yeah, right.
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:13.000]  And all of a sudden, Willie Nelson walked around the back counter where I was signing DVDs and shook my hand and said,
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:15.000]  I really appreciate the great job you're doing.
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:18.000]  And I gave him my info, gave me his, and he said, I'll be talking to you.
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  A few months later he called me and there was a guy on the show and the rest is history.
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  But to make a long story short, I started talking to him Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  We are doing an event.
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:33.000]  It's locked in.
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:37.000]  And it is going to be a free event.
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:39.000]  It is going to be free.
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:41.000]  A free Willie Nelson event.
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:45.000]  And he is basically, I said, hey, you're the boss.
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  You tell me what to do or you have somebody else do it and I'll try to raise the money for the free event or whatever.
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:50.000]  He said, no.
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:25:52.000]  He said, you know, you just basically run it.
[3:25:52.000 --> 3:25:54.000]  Invite a bunch of big bands.
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:25:56.000]  I'll invite some friends of mine.
[3:25:56.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  Once they hear I'm involved, a lot of big groups are going to want to come.
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:01.000]  He's got Firemade coming up with Neil Young and a bunch of other people.
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  September 20th.
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:04.000]  This is going to be in October.
[3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:07.000]  I'll tell you that it is going to be in October.
[3:26:07.000 --> 3:26:10.000]  That is when you're going to have this event.
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:14.000]  I was going to announce it tomorrow, but things got nailed down today.
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  But still for reasons of espionage and other things, I'm not going to get into specifics.
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  Probably till Friday or maybe even next week.
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:26.000]  But this is kind of emails I get from Willie.
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:29.000]  I've talked to him, of course, personally over the phone, but emails as well back and forth.
[3:26:29.000 --> 3:26:34.000]  Why don't you put out the word that we are looking for other acts and let's see who wants to play.
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:35.000]  I think there'll be a lot.
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  Thanks, Willie.
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:38.000]  And that's in response to my email.
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:40.000]  I'm glad that we've nailed down the date.
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:43.000]  I'm going to call Ventura tomorrow to give him the date.
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:45.000]  I got to do that when I get off air today.
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:49.000]  The bleep of 11 is only two and a half months away.
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  So I don't want to wait too long getting the details on how you want this to go down.
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:55.000]  And that was the response to this that he sent me here.
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:26:59.000]  And also he said he wants it to be a free event and another email yesterday.
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:01.000]  I'm supposed to call him the last two days.
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:03.000]  I'm so busy I can't even call Willie Nelson.
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:06.000]  I'm going to be doing that after the show today.
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:08.000]  And I got to call Ventura.
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:10.000]  He already said he would come in September, October.
[3:27:10.000 --> 3:27:12.000]  He leaves back to Mexico in November.
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:15.000]  Ventura going public for 9-Eleven Truth here.
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:18.000]  You may see some other big people go public for 9-Eleven Truth at this.
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:21.000]  It's going to be about 80% don't attack Iran.
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:24.000]  Don't take us into World War III, but it's also going to be 9-Eleven Truth.
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:28.000]  When you got a Ventura and some other surprise guest that are going to be coming.
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:30.000]  And this stuff falls right in my lap.
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:32.000]  I mean, it is Providence, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:38.000]  It is Providence and we could have a paid event for 10 bucks or whatever.
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:40.000]  Guaranteed 30, 40,000 will show up.
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:45.000]  The place we've got can take 60,000, but there's not parking for 60,000.
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:47.000]  There's parking for about 35,000.
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  So folks, you better understand that you're going to have to get bused in or something to this.
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  Because this sucker gets his capacity is exactly 60,000.
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:27:58.000]  And I think we're going to fill it.
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:01.000]  So, I mean, this is going to be absolutely incredible.
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  Alejandro Jones, you know, Willie's coming in with his whole band.
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  Some other big people are probably going to be coming in.
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:11.000]  That's a big donation for them.
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:14.000]  I mean, their crews are costing them 20, 30 grand per event.
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:16.000]  So they're already giving huge amounts.
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  Willie is and everybody else through that.
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:22.000]  I'm just going to spend my kids' college money on this.
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  Now, we're probably going to have t-shirt sales there.
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:26.000]  Hopefully that will pay for it.
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:27.000]  No, I'm going to pay for it.
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:29.000]  I'm not going to ask for donations for it at this time.
[3:28:29.000 --> 3:28:30.000]  It's just we're doing it.
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  It's free, baby.
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:33.000]  And that's the way it goes.
[3:28:33.000 --> 3:28:36.000]  And I'm not going to let anybody in on exactly the date yet.
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:39.000]  But you're probably here in Nelson Poppin in the near future.
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  What a show today.
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:41.000]  Webster Tarpley.
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:44.000]  We've had Stan Monteef and Lindsay Williams on.
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:47.000]  We've got Webster Tarpley coming on again next week.
[3:28:47.000 --> 3:28:49.000]  And we've got Mark Cornkey in studio.
[3:28:49.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  We're on the march.
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:52.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:56.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:28:58.000]  Come in with that.
[3:28:58.000 --> 3:29:00.000]  I'm not going to ask for donations for it at this time.
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:01.000]  It's just we're doing it.
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:02.000]  It's free, baby.
[3:29:02.000 --> 3:29:05.000]  And that's the way it goes.
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:08.000]  And I'm not going to let anybody in on exactly the date yet.
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:11.000]  But you're probably here in Nelson Poppin in the near future.
[3:29:11.000 --> 3:29:12.000]  What a show today.
[3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:13.000]  Webster Tarpley.
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:16.000]  We've had Stan Monteef and Lindsay Williams on.
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:19.000]  We've got Webster Tarpley coming on again next week.
[3:29:19.000 --> 3:29:21.000]  And we've got Mark Cornkey in studio.
[3:29:21.000 --> 3:29:22.000]  We're on the march.
[3:29:22.000 --> 3:29:24.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:28.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:31.000 --> 3:29:34.000]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  Matthew 24 states four times.
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:42.000]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[3:29:42.000 --> 3:29:44.000]  What do you know about the beast?
[3:29:44.000 --> 3:29:46.000]  It's Mark and the antichrist.
[3:29:46.000 --> 3:29:50.000]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[3:29:50.000 --> 3:29:55.000]  Is it's Mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the National ID card or 666?
[3:29:55.000 --> 3:29:58.000]  Is the antichrist a person, title or both?
[3:29:58.000 --> 3:30:00.000]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[3:30:00.000 --> 3:30:02.000]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[3:30:02.000 --> 3:30:05.000]  First, John states the antichrist is already in the world.
[3:30:05.000 --> 3:30:07.000]  What is the truth and what is a lie?
[3:30:07.000 --> 3:30:10.000]  Are you willing to search God's word for the truth?
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:13.000]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible for free books,
[3:30:13.000 --> 3:30:17.000]  DVDs and Bible studies exposing the antichrist, the beast and its mark
[3:30:17.000 --> 3:30:19.000]  right to the Bible says,
[3:30:19.000 --> 3:30:21.000]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee.
[3:30:21.000 --> 3:30:27.000]  37771 or call 888-211-1715.
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:31.000]  That's 888-211-1715.
[3:30:31.000 --> 3:30:33.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[3:30:33.000 --> 3:30:36.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[3:30:36.000 --> 3:30:38.000]  9-11 was an inside job.
[3:30:38.000 --> 3:30:39.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[3:30:39.000 --> 3:30:41.000]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:30:41.000 --> 3:30:44.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:46.000]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[3:30:46.000 --> 3:30:49.000]  the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.?
[3:30:49.000 --> 3:30:53.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day
[3:30:53.000 --> 3:30:57.000]  that we have allowed the seeds of just criticism to grow at our own door.
[3:30:57.000 --> 3:31:00.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[3:31:00.000 --> 3:31:03.000]  a global awakening has taken place.
[3:31:03.000 --> 3:31:05.000]  An inside job?
[3:31:05.000 --> 3:31:07.000]  How dare you?
[3:31:07.000 --> 3:31:09.000]  I don't think about the comments just in the show.
[3:31:09.000 --> 3:31:11.000]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[3:31:11.000 --> 3:31:13.000]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:16.000]  Oh, hell, it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:31:16.000 --> 3:31:19.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[3:31:19.000 --> 3:31:21.000]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[3:31:21.000 --> 3:31:22.000]  Police rising.
[3:31:22.000 --> 3:31:25.000]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now
[3:31:25.000 --> 3:31:27.000]  or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:31:27.000 --> 3:31:30.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[3:31:30.000 --> 3:31:34.000]  Do you ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[3:31:34.000 --> 3:31:36.000]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[3:31:36.000 --> 3:31:39.000]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel
[3:31:39.000 --> 3:31:42.000]  and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[3:31:42.000 --> 3:31:44.000]  Finalized the contract in London
[3:31:44.000 --> 3:31:46.000]  and demoed our new product in Boston.
[3:31:46.000 --> 3:31:49.000]  Online from my desk with Webex.
[3:31:49.000 --> 3:31:52.000]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[3:31:52.000 --> 3:31:54.000]  I just talked to clients on the phone
[3:31:54.000 --> 3:31:57.000]  and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop
[3:31:57.000 --> 3:31:59.000]  so I can travel the world and still...
[3:32:00.000 --> 3:32:02.000]  He's going the distance
[3:32:02.000 --> 3:32:05.000]  He's going for speed
[3:32:05.000 --> 3:32:07.000]  She's all alone
[3:32:07.000 --> 3:32:10.000]  All alone in a time of need
[3:32:10.000 --> 3:32:15.000]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques
[3:32:15.000 --> 3:32:20.000]  which will enable the controlling oligarchy
[3:32:20.000 --> 3:32:24.000]  to get people actually to love their servitude.
[3:32:24.000 --> 3:32:29.000]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs
[3:32:29.000 --> 3:32:34.000]  which by any decent standard they ought not to enjoy.
[3:32:34.000 --> 3:32:39.000]  Perhaps you would better stop from the beginning.
[3:32:39.000 --> 3:32:45.000]  Perhaps you would better stop from the beginning.
[3:32:45.000 --> 3:32:50.000]  Perhaps you would better stop from the beginning.
[3:32:50.000 --> 3:32:53.000]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[3:32:53.000 --> 3:32:56.000]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[3:32:56.000 --> 3:33:00.000]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[3:33:00.000 --> 3:33:04.000]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids
[3:33:04.000 --> 3:33:07.000]  according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[3:33:07.000 --> 3:33:09.000]  These new studies suggest that the opposite,
[3:33:09.000 --> 3:33:13.000]  that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior
[3:33:13.000 --> 3:33:14.000]  and mental performance.
[3:33:14.000 --> 3:33:17.000]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay
[3:33:17.000 --> 3:33:19.000]  but could it also cause cancer?
[3:33:19.000 --> 3:33:22.000]  For example, the government had the right under U.S. law
[3:33:22.000 --> 3:33:26.000]  to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[3:33:26.000 --> 3:33:30.000]  They have to work with dark side while they spend time in the shadows.
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:34.000]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[3:33:34.000 --> 3:33:38.000]  Well, join me and I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see.
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:41.000]  There's a need for a new world order.
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:34:10.000]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:17.000]  Willie Nelson was saying in an email last night to go ahead and announce it.
[3:34:17.000 --> 3:34:21.000]  Then I got another one from him about 10 minutes ago
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:25.000]  that I just read during the break about another location.
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:28.000]  So, you know what?
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  It might be a place with 20,000, a place with 60,000.
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:31.000]  We're trying to nail this down.
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:33.000]  So whoever puts a YouTube together,
[3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  Merley announcement, make sure that it's on there.
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:37.000]  That's why this stuff makes me pull my hair out
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:39.000]  because that's why I don't even subconsciously want to do things like this
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:43.000]  because I have to worry about making sure it comes off right.
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  We were just playing Walter Cronkite calling for world government
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:48.000]  and saying he sits at the right hand of Satan.
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:52.000]  These people are in your face under Bohemian Grove, remember?
[3:34:52.000 --> 3:34:54.000]  What a wild day.
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:58.000]  I found out last night because one of my engineers went down to the event.
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:01.000]  He called me and said, oh, I was just down at Brave New Books.
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:02.000]  Mark Corky was in town.
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:04.000]  I said, oh, is it still going?
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:05.000]  He said, no, it's about to end.
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:07.000]  I don't have time to go down there, but I want to meet him in person.
[3:35:07.000 --> 3:35:10.000]  I feel like I know him, interviewing him so many times of the years,
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:12.000]  going back into the mid-90s,
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  and then when he got back out of prison, being set up now,
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:17.000]  and I said, try to set him up for tomorrow.
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:19.000]  Well, they were able to get him before he left town.
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:20.000]  He's with us for the rest of this hour.
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:22.000]  I'm going to go into overdrive today.
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:24.000]  We're on AM&FM right now, but about 25 minutes,
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:26.000]  the main transmission will end,
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  but we'll do about 20 minutes of overdrive.
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:30.000]  I'd do five hours overdrive if Corky could do it.
[3:35:30.000 --> 3:35:32.000]  Also, I have to deal with this concert
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  and about 10 other insane things
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:38.000]  that are going on right now.
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  So as we try to finally nail down this concert
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:45.000]  that's going on, and I want it to be free.
[3:35:45.000 --> 3:35:47.000]  They want it to be free, too, but who knows what's going to happen here
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:49.000]  when you're dealing with superstars like this.
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:51.000]  But getting into the whole geopolitical realm,
[3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:55.000]  Mark Corky in studio with us, Mark, good to have you here.
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:35:57.000]  Hey, thanks to have you, Alex.
[3:35:57.000 --> 3:35:59.000]  It's always fun to be down here because down here in Texas,
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:01.000]  we know it's the big state, and it's got big hearts,
[3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  and we've got big hospitality.
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:05.000]  That's exactly what we've seen all the while we've been here.
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:06.000]  We're down here going crazy, man.
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:08.000]  And getting hot, too, because, guys,
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:10.000]  you can fry out on the pavement right now.
[3:36:10.000 --> 3:36:12.000]  Not quite as much as Arizona, but it's getting close there.
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:15.000]  So we brought eggs, bacon, and if it's a little warmer here after one,
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:17.000]  we'll do just fine.
[3:36:17.000 --> 3:36:18.000]  But yeah, it's been a great time.
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:19.000]  We've been here. Appreciate it.
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  And I want to say thank you to all the people who have been here possible
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:24.000]  because we've been flying on the cuff.
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:25.000]  We haven't really set a schedule.
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:28.000]  Everybody that's needed us here, we've taken care of it.
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  Mark, you're here in person.
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:32.000]  What has it been like in your life
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:34.000]  when you woke up to the New World Order in the late 80s
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:39.000]  and now being one of the leaders of the refounding
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:41.000]  and the Patriot community exploding in the 90s,
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:43.000]  being sent to prison on trumped-up charges
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:45.000]  with the police on their own squad car running off the road?
[3:36:45.000 --> 3:36:47.000]  I mean, it's been quite a saga for you,
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:49.000]  and I think it's just beginning.
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  Well, we've actually been very, very busy, as you know.
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:55.000]  And as you get into this, you find out there's so much more to do,
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:36:57.000]  and that's exciting of itself,
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  because you get a chance to meet all the people that are out there.
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  And there's a lot of people, like you said, that have been in this before us
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  that passed the torch on,
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:07.000]  and we're now doing the job that they did at one time.
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  In fact, they didn't have the tools we have.
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  Look at the great trinkets we have to work with
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:13.000]  that get the word out.
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  In the past, remember, it used to be,
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:17.000]  would you like to see a mimeograph?
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  I've got a UN document, State Department document 7277.
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:21.000]  Right, exactly.
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:23.000]  And it would be the one thing that they had to work with.
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:26.000]  Today, we have virtually every media tool at our disposal
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:29.000]  that our enemy hoped to manipulate and control.
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:30.000]  And our enemy was in the old mindset
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  where they could go to a world governance conference
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:34.000]  and where all these world leaders and Walter Cronkite
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:36.000]  could call for world government.
[3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:38.000]  Now we can go get those old tapes and string 20 of them together
[3:37:38.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  with prime ministers and leaders calling for it
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:42.000]  and say, oh, that doesn't exist.
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  Or we can, through Judicial Watch,
[3:37:44.000 --> 3:37:46.000]  go sue and get North American Union documents.
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:49.000]  In the past, we did that, but used to hand them out.
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:50.000]  Now we give them to millions.
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:52.000]  Right, and the other fascinating thing is don't forget that
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:54.000]  while Walter was telling you all about certain things from One Direction,
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:57.000]  he's also the right hand of Satan in his own words.
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:37:59.000]  Can you believe he said that?
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  Well, again, you know, we remember it wasn't with Bohemian Grove, as I recall.
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  Who was the voice in the background for so many years?
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:08.000]  Walter Cronkite.
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:09.000]  So let's see.
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:10.000]  Don't care.
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:13.000]  So do you think when people use certain words,
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:15.000]  especially when you see a statement made like that,
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  even if he was trying to work off the cuff,
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:22.000]  that inventory, that process that he used to became a public statement
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:25.000]  was sitting somewhere in his subconscious in some way.
[3:38:25.000 --> 3:38:28.000]  He didn't just pull that out of his, you know, out of his back pocket.
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  Usually that represents or demonstrates a mindset,
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:36.000]  a track, an ideology, a school of thought.
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:39.000]  And when you capture it like that, they figure it's an animal moment
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:41.000]  that will never be captured and brought back again.
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:43.000]  After all, it's feudal resistance that was done.
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:44.000]  Because that was done before the Internet Age.
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:45.000]  That's right.
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  So now we brought it back from the future, you know, back from then to the future.
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:50.000]  And that's one of the things for a lot of your listeners right now.
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:53.000]  There's a lot of new people that are out there listening maybe for the first time.
[3:38:53.000 --> 3:38:57.000]  But let's say that they've gotten to the Internet because they're retired.
[3:38:57.000 --> 3:39:02.000]  Now you're listening out there right now and you have a collection of beta tapes
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  or VHS tapes, or you were in an industry where you even saved part of what you did real to real.
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  There are old satellite feeds.
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  That's right.
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:13.000]  There are old files sitting there where people are listening.
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  And when you hear what you hear on the programming like this during the breaks
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:17.000]  or when we come back.
[3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  It hits a tumbler.
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:23.000]  That's right. We need your help too because you may have the rest of what we don't have.
[3:39:23.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  And remember that if you can access and work together with us, we're going to get it out.
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:32.000]  And now it won't just that nanobite back in 1964.
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:35.000]  Now it's the truth brought forward to the year 2008.
[3:39:35.000 --> 3:39:37.000]  Think of what a tool that is.
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:39.000]  And it's happening more and more.
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  That's right.
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:43.000]  So it's changing the dynamics of the battlefield, which is what we've been doing.
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:45.000]  The other side, well, let's put it this way.
[3:39:45.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  I walk all over the place.
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:47.000]  I go all over the place.
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:48.000]  I also make a point of something.
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:50.000]  Doing something everybody listening should do.
[3:39:50.000 --> 3:39:53.000]  Do not hesitate to speak.
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:56.000]  Silence and inaction is concerned.
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  That's right.
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:39:58.000]  It is action.
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:39:59.000]  That's the best way to describe it.
[3:39:59.000 --> 3:40:02.000]  Remember, the lack of motion is not an inaction.
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:05.000]  The lack of motion is one of many choices.
[3:40:05.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  If you fail to move, your enemy can either...
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:09.000]  There are two situations.
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:10.000]  You can fail.
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:14.000]  You can stop moving the motion so that you allow your enemy to move into a position where you can attack them better.
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:20.000]  Or if you fail to move and they're on the offensive, you simply become enveloped and overrun.
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:22.000]  Well, in this case, the whole idea...
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:25.000]  There's a lot of people out there with all this cool technology that they may have used in the past.
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  They're thinking, well, it's obsolete.
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:27.000]  I've got MP3.
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:28.000]  I've got...
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:29.000]  No.
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:35.000]  You have sound bites and you have bits of information and evidence that incriminate and demonstrate over and over again
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:40.000]  the true culpability of an enemy that we've been facing off and successfully working against.
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:42.000]  Think about what we've done in the last 20 years.
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:44.000]  Think about what we've done in the last 10 years.
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:49.000]  And again, look at the personalities that are coming forward, just like you've described in the program here,
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  that are actually able to lever many, many other people.
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:55.000]  Now, I'm going to say this.
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:40:56.000]  Alex, you've got a lot of people.
[3:40:56.000 --> 3:40:59.000]  If you have one personality that comes forward, consider this.
[3:40:59.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  It's kind of like when government says, well, I've got four letters in the mail.
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:04.000]  People say, well, that's not significant.
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:05.000]  Wrong.
[3:41:05.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  The old formula was if they got four letters in a subject,
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:12.000]  they knew that so many hundred thousand people were actually thinking the same thoughts.
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  In every situation, just like with these personalities,
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  if you're affecting one or two people that will more than willingly come forward and express their position,
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:24.000]  that means that there are hundreds, if not thousands of others,
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:29.000]  that given that final push become part of the wave that supports your effort.
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:30.000]  And that's what's happening right now.
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:32.000]  That's what you're on the edge of.
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  Most everybody can see this.
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  They sense it.
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:35.000]  They feel it.
[3:41:35.000 --> 3:41:36.000]  They smell it.
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:37.000]  They touch it.
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  They know why everybody must speak out.
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:43.000]  Don't worry about the character that was ridiculing you a year and a half ago.
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:44.000]  You know what he does now?
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:45.000]  He does this, Alex.
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  He looks down at the ground.
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:48.000]  He'll look over anywhere.
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:51.000]  But he will not look at you when you're speaking about it.
[3:41:51.000 --> 3:41:53.000]  Well, that is the phenomenon now.
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  Yes.
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  But not just looking down.
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:57.000]  So many people where we planted those seeds, you know, in farming,
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  you might have seeds from two years ago, 10 years ago,
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  six years ago that are called volunteers.
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  They sprout up later.
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:08.000]  Or they wash up underneath something and then wash back out.
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:09.000]  And that's the same thing.
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:11.000]  We've planted billions of seeds.
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  Millions sprouted before.
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  Now millions more are sprouting.
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  And it's almost like we're putting in the infall or landmines out.
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:18.000]  But these landmines don't kill people.
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:20.000]  They unlock mine.
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:21.000]  Knock down walls.
[3:42:21.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  Exactly.
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  In people's minds.
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:26.000]  And so now we have littered everything with these landmines.
[3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  And it is unlocking people's minds.
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:30.000]  It is, you know, the tumblers are unlocking.
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  And they're remembering everything we told them, everything we said.
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:33.000]  And it's all happening.
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:34.000]  Exactly.
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:37.000]  And the most important thing is this is part of what is the first phase.
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:41.000]  For years I've argued, it's not like you just walk up a series of steps.
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  Each tier.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  First of all, you got to acknowledge the idea something's different.
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  Something's wrong with your environment.
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:49.000]  And so that's like pulling yourself up to the next step with virtually
[3:42:49.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  every ounce of energy you have in your body.
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  You think, ah, now I'm at the plateau where I can see everything.
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:57.000]  And what you see first is the next step.
[3:42:57.000 --> 3:43:01.000]  You realize as you've now opened your eyes, there's something else going on.
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:04.000]  Mark, what do you think we're going to see happen in the next six months,
[3:43:04.000 --> 3:43:06.000]  next year, next two years unfolding?
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:07.000]  I mean, give us your projection.
[3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:09.000]  Well, actually, again, we have the sliding timeline.
[3:43:09.000 --> 3:43:13.000]  Number one is we have Jorge Bush, the second,
[3:43:13.000 --> 3:43:16.000]  the best president Mexico's probably ever had.
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:20.000]  And we'll, we have perhaps a person who's looking to create a duchy out of Texas,
[3:43:20.000 --> 3:43:22.000]  the, and the Southwestern United States,
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:25.000]  if you were just let the timeline go the way it is.
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:28.000]  However, as again, we're seeing there are obviously enough people involving
[3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:32.000]  government that are concerned with the idea that somebody wants to be expeditionary
[3:43:32.000 --> 3:43:34.000]  before he leaves office.
[3:43:34.000 --> 3:43:35.000]  Not of his own accord.
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:39.000]  George Bush, if he starts a war with Iran, isn't doing it on his own accord.
[3:43:39.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  He's being told by somebody else to do this.
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:45.000]  As is traditionally the case, if he gets us into a conflict overseas,
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:43:46.000]  what's the argument?
[3:43:46.000 --> 3:43:47.000]  Well, we're already in it.
[3:43:47.000 --> 3:43:49.000]  What did we hear with Iraq?
[3:43:49.000 --> 3:43:51.000]  Well, now that we're in it, we can't back out.
[3:43:51.000 --> 3:43:56.000]  Now getting us into Iran, especially being, isn't he a lame duck?
[3:43:56.000 --> 3:43:59.000]  That would be one option, but here's the problem.
[3:43:59.000 --> 3:44:03.000]  What if instead of being a lame duck, he becomes a lion
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:06.000]  and decides to grab hold of the meat and stick.
[3:44:06.000 --> 3:44:11.000]  And that's the most realistic scenario between a combination of an attack inside the United States,
[3:44:11.000 --> 3:44:14.000]  a 9-11 type scenario, which everybody's been talking about,
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:18.000]  and an attack on Iran, which of course would be an aggressive,
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:22.000]  on a war of aggression, just like the first war of aggression we've been in, you know, with Iraq,
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:25.000]  you're going to see a situation where there would be greater and greater response
[3:44:25.000 --> 3:44:28.000]  from outside the United States and the international community.
[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:31.000]  Now there's two attitudes, and we've already heard this, and you're seeing this.
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:34.000]  We need to take Americans to the international court.
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:36.000]  Now, I understand that that sounds good.
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:37.000]  And that sets the precedent for it.
[3:44:37.000 --> 3:44:39.000]  Well, it's the same thing in England.
[3:44:39.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  They have all this tyranny, and then the EU keeps ruling for liberty.
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:44.000]  But inside the EU, it's total tyranny.
[3:44:44.000 --> 3:44:47.000]  They're only setting the precedent in people's minds that that's the court of justice.
[3:44:47.000 --> 3:44:51.000]  And then all of a sudden, we go to a higher tier alien to the United States,
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:53.000]  outside American jurisprudence.
[3:44:53.000 --> 3:44:57.000]  And so it's, for them, their perception is one way or another, they can make this a win-win.
[3:44:57.000 --> 3:45:03.000]  In other words, how do you take and turn a, you know, a mud pie into a, you know, something edible?
[3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:07.000]  You have to, you know, one way or another, even though it looks bad for us, for them,
[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:12.000]  they're directing the actions in such a way that if we decided that we're going to,
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:15.000]  well, we can't really deal with this in the American system, we'll take him to the world court.
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:20.000]  Taking them to the world court means that we then have no, I mean, what's the appeals process with this?
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:25.000]  How do you go? And how do you control or regulate a process that is so far away from the people
[3:45:25.000 --> 3:45:32.000]  that there is no control or regulation that once, as we've already seen with centralized American government,
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:36.000]  if you let all the power gravitate to a position so far away you can't see what's going on,
[3:45:36.000 --> 3:45:42.000]  the scallywags gravitate there, how can anybody with any intelligence argue that the United Nations,
[3:45:42.000 --> 3:45:47.000]  the world court, and all of these other structures, who would answer now to no one,
[3:45:47.000 --> 3:45:52.000]  wouldn't gravitate to the exact same policy that we were already complaining about with Washington.
[3:45:52.000 --> 3:45:56.000]  Well, they constantly do this, you know, Clinton's so evil, Bush is going to come in and save us.
[3:45:56.000 --> 3:46:00.000]  Clinton's been so, you know, bad now, Bush is the savior.
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:06.000]  And then, okay, we get George Bush, and now he's been really bad, so Barack Obama is going to save us.
[3:46:06.000 --> 3:46:11.000]  And it's the same left-right paradigm, or Tory versus Labor, where they control both sides.
[3:46:11.000 --> 3:46:15.000]  And I know this is simple to the listeners, but the general public doesn't understand this,
[3:46:15.000 --> 3:46:20.000]  and it's literally just a new sheet of paper for the birdcage liner, and then after four to eight years
[3:46:20.000 --> 3:46:25.000]  they remove that piece, or maybe it's six years in England or whatever, and they just remove it.
[3:46:25.000 --> 3:46:27.000]  Same thing in Israel, same thing in Germany.
[3:46:27.000 --> 3:46:33.000]  We have to get back to basic issues to try to explain this to the public, issues of liberty.
[3:46:33.000 --> 3:46:36.000]  But, you know, a lot of people thought Bill Clinton was going to go from martial law
[3:46:36.000 --> 3:46:41.000]  because we saw the plans, executive orders, the gear up, but then that started before even Reagan.
[3:46:41.000 --> 3:46:46.000]  It's just gotten bigger and bigger and bigger now where they could try it, but it may be a Barack Obama that does it.
[3:46:46.000 --> 3:46:51.000]  It may be a John McCain, but you're saying you think there's a lot of evidence that it may happen now?
[3:46:51.000 --> 3:46:53.000]  Well, that's the first window is there's a sliding scale.
[3:46:53.000 --> 3:47:00.000]  If Bush decides to make the effort to do this, the problem that we have is how many people, for instance, in the military would actually go along with it?
[3:47:00.000 --> 3:47:06.000]  Well, if there's a terror attack, even if people are awake, it tends to make a lot of people who are on the fence go ahead and get in line.
[3:47:06.000 --> 3:47:11.000]  Right. The way that this has to be done is from the military perspective and other people who are in agencies,
[3:47:11.000 --> 3:47:21.000]  even who do not go along with or agree with what's happening, there would have to be a very quick containment bubble to restrict it from expanding into the crisis mode, which is what they want.
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:23.000]  And by the way, this isn't a radical thing we're saying.
[3:47:23.000 --> 3:47:31.000]  Under Nixon, you know, the military and others, it was publicly said in Congress said do not launch any military operations, do not stage any events.
[3:47:31.000 --> 3:47:32.000]  Right, exactly.
[3:47:32.000 --> 3:47:36.000]  However, however, go back before that, just exactly something that everybody has disclosed.
[3:47:36.000 --> 3:47:41.000]  You've had it in your videos, Operation Northwood, which goes back before Nixon.
[3:47:41.000 --> 3:47:43.000]  And Kennedy said no and they killed him.
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:47.000]  And that's where, again, now when people ask, well, why would they have said that to Nixon?
[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:55.000]  Inside the system, they already understood because of the documents that have now been declassified, they knew within the system that that was a possibility.
[3:47:55.000 --> 3:47:57.000]  In fact, it was a probability.
[3:47:57.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  On September 12th in the Washington Post, they had a Pentagon report put out from the Navy.
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:10.000]  Remember that saying Israel is capable of staging false flag, staged terror events as a pretext to launch a war in the Middle East.
[3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:11.000]  Exactly.
[3:48:11.000 --> 3:48:14.000]  Now, again, we had those warnings, those leaks slipping out there.
[3:48:14.000 --> 3:48:19.000]  Somebody declassified Operation Northwood when it wasn't supposed to be declassified, slipping things out.
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:22.000]  So we have a lot of friends inside the government.
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:33.000]  The system understands that this scenario, if it's played out, if you're an analyst of any kind, if you're a person working within the system in any way with authority or with responsibility,
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:36.000]  that you can walk through step by step to see the end result.
[3:48:36.000 --> 3:48:48.000]  And it's so obvious now that it goes back to H.G. Wells, what he stated in the open conspiracy, said at a given point, it would become so obvious that it would be impossible to hide the agenda.
[3:48:48.000 --> 3:48:55.000]  And that at that point, it would be the most dangerous for the ring knockers, for the, you know, the counseling for relations, the Bilderbergers, whoever, the Bilderbergs.
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:49:01.000]  And that what would happen is all of their actions could be seen by even the most naive of individuals, or at least they would ask questions.
[3:49:01.000 --> 3:49:04.000]  The problem is that they're not all powerful.
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:05.000]  This is what people make a mistake on.
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:07.000]  They want everybody to believe that.
[3:49:07.000 --> 3:49:15.000]  But that goes back to the basic rules of warfare, be it European, philosophy, or Asian, that the basic rule is to convince your enemy that the war is lost before the first...
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:25.000]  But we're going to go right and come back with a final main transmission and then do 20 minutes if you can do it in overdrive, just for Internet audience alone.

[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:28.000]  We're going to have him on with us for 20 minutes.
[3:53:28.000 --> 3:53:31.000]  That's the 320 central standard time.

[3:53:46.000 --> 3:53:54.000]  With Lindsey Williams, we head back on today to understand Monteev, Webster Griffith, and of course Steve Watson as well.
[3:53:54.000 --> 3:53:56.000]  And that's the issues I wanted to bring up to you, Mark.
[3:53:56.000 --> 3:54:01.000]  He opens up the Sunday paper in England. Steve Watson lives in London.
[3:54:01.000 --> 3:54:03.000]  British kids encouraged to become climate cops.
[3:54:03.000 --> 3:54:06.000]  You go to the website, they wear uniforms.
[3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:08.000]  It says report on your parents.
[3:54:08.000 --> 3:54:10.000]  It's climatecops.com.
[3:54:10.000 --> 3:54:12.000]  They build a dossier on your parents.
[3:54:12.000 --> 3:54:14.000]  You spy on them and report back to the government.
[3:54:14.000 --> 3:54:16.000]  This is what Barack Obama is calling for.
[3:54:16.000 --> 3:54:19.000]  Everything we've said, but they're really announcing it right now.
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:20.000]  Your take.
[3:54:20.000 --> 3:54:29.000]  Well, interesting that's exactly where I'd go is, isn't it fascinating? See, for everybody, most people say, well, this is a unique idea by this dynamic individual who just pulled this out of his hind end.
[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:31.000]  It was a plastic bag, okay?
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:38.000]  It was very messy, very stinky, but he took the plastic bag off and look what he discovered when in reality what we see is, and they don't expect this to happen,
[3:54:38.000 --> 3:54:45.000]  is for everybody to be able to demonstrate a coordinated effort by a series of individuals who supposedly are disassociated.
[3:54:45.000 --> 3:54:47.000]  Remember, they'll claim, oh, I don't know who that guy is.
[3:54:47.000 --> 3:54:49.000]  Well, wait a minute, okay?
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:56.000]  The exact same thing that you just proposed here in the United States, this shyster over in England just dropped in everybody's lap.
[3:54:56.000 --> 3:54:59.000]  And in Australia, they're telling him a new law, four-minute showers.
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:02.000]  I mean, it's just all about, we control the resources.
[3:55:02.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  Except, you know, and there again, what's fascinating about that is, and again, purely control.
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:08.000]  It's just the idea of control.
[3:55:08.000 --> 3:55:17.000]  When you look at the changing technologies, when you have all the conservation and recycling systems in place, why would you have to take a four-minute shower?
[3:55:17.000 --> 3:55:19.000]  You know, for instance, understanding.
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  But they're not doing any of the real good environmental stuff.
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:26.000]  Oh, no, no, it's purely designed to get you into the nutcase scenario of being a plebe, you know, being a slave, being a peon.
[3:55:26.000 --> 3:55:31.000]  Otherwise, think about it, with closed system technologies, I got into this years ago back in the 70s.
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:34.000]  Well, I told us it's going to be a rationing car, but everything you buy is on that.
[3:55:34.000 --> 3:55:35.000]  It also surveils you.
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:37.000]  Well, that goes right back to the Soviets.
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:40.000]  Remember, people used to stand in line for toilet paper every day.
[3:55:40.000 --> 3:55:43.000]  People used to stand in line for toothbrushes every day.
[3:55:43.000 --> 3:55:45.000]  Making you dependent on the state.
[3:55:45.000 --> 3:55:48.000]  Again, for everybody to say, well, if they just gave it a chance, it had a chance.
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:49.000]  It killed 100 million people.
[3:55:49.000 --> 3:55:50.000]  It lasted 70-plus years.
[3:55:50.000 --> 3:55:53.000]  It fogged off into history only so it could be changed.
[3:55:53.000 --> 3:56:00.000]  The amoeba could shift over and drop itself right in the middle of the United States and the unfortunates in England.
[3:56:00.000 --> 3:56:06.000]  And the fun and the comical part about it is, I'm sorry, guys, but I would guess that George Orwell was right.
[3:56:06.000 --> 3:56:08.000]  1984, guys, come on.
[3:56:08.000 --> 3:56:10.000]  Oh, this is directly out of that.
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:12.000]  It's a playbook when you read the website.
[3:56:12.000 --> 3:56:16.000]  Except an interesting thing, years ago, my father had to take some additional college classes.
[3:56:16.000 --> 3:56:23.000]  He worked as an apparatus supervisor in designing equipment for the fire department that he worked for.
[3:56:23.000 --> 3:56:31.000]  And one of the things back in the 70s that came up with these honest college professors who were talking about engineering and also economics,
[3:56:31.000 --> 3:56:35.000]  they said, chances are, and this was said, I had a class of Eastern Michigan.
[3:56:35.000 --> 3:56:38.000]  He took a class of Eastern Michigan with a totally different professor.
[3:56:38.000 --> 3:56:43.000]  And both of them said the same thing. They said, chances are, within a very short period of time here,
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:47.000]  we're going to be waging, we're going to have a war waged against us and we're going to have to fight
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:51.000]  and we're going to have to kill the ecologists, the eco-freaks, because what's going to happen is,
[3:56:51.000 --> 3:56:54.000]  they're going to deem, and he said, watch how this works.
[3:56:54.000 --> 3:56:58.000]  They understand it's about getting control of resources and killing people.
[3:56:58.000 --> 3:57:00.000]  The bottom line is, what's the agenda you keep hearing?
[3:57:00.000 --> 3:57:01.000]  We've got to kill off 80%.
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:04.000]  Well, you know what I say, as I've said before, them first.
[3:57:04.000 --> 3:57:06.000]  You go jump off the cliff like the lemming and let me watch.
[3:57:06.000 --> 3:57:08.000]  Oh, that doesn't look good, Alex. I don't think we'll do that.
[3:57:08.000 --> 3:57:10.000]  We'll stay here and let the next lemming.
[3:57:10.000 --> 3:57:13.000]  Oh, hey, those ecologists don't bounce very well.
[3:57:13.000 --> 3:57:17.000]  But again, it's about co-opting real environmental and conservation.
[3:57:17.000 --> 3:57:20.000]  That's right. In other words, we have good projects and policies we can implement.
[3:57:20.000 --> 3:57:22.000]  They're just not being implemented.
[3:57:22.000 --> 3:57:24.000]  Or if they are, the idea is to still keep you in a narrow track
[3:57:24.000 --> 3:57:26.000]  that puts you in a time lock, 20 years old.
[3:57:26.000 --> 3:57:29.000]  Okay, we're going to be right back in Overdrive, one place to listen,
[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:34.000]  on the streams at infowars.com or prisonplanet.tv.
[3:57:34.000 --> 3:57:37.000]  In fact, we're just going to continue rolling right now
[3:57:37.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  for everybody at infowars.com.
[3:57:39.000 --> 3:57:43.000]  You are listening to GCN.
[3:57:43.000 --> 3:57:48.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:57:48.000 --> 3:57:50.000]  Oh, I need to give the phone number.
[3:57:50.000 --> 3:57:52.000]  On September 11th, 2001.
[3:57:52.000 --> 3:57:53.000]  Thank you, John.
[3:57:53.000 --> 3:57:55.000]  Any time, Jones, we'll see you again tomorrow.
[3:57:55.000 --> 3:57:57.000]  Take care, my friend. We appreciate you.
[3:57:57.000 --> 3:57:58.000]  We'll see you.
[3:57:58.000 --> 3:57:59.000]  Any time.
[3:57:59.000 --> 3:58:00.000]  Okay, folks.
[3:58:00.000 --> 3:58:01.000]  Rising is a breakthrough.
[3:58:01.000 --> 3:58:03.000]  Let me give you the final...
[3:58:03.000 --> 3:58:06.000]  Let me give you the toll free number to call in.
[3:58:06.000 --> 3:58:08.000]  We'll take some calls for 20 minutes, and that's it
[3:58:08.000 --> 3:58:11.000]  because Mark's got to go and I got things piled up in the rafters.
[3:58:11.000 --> 3:58:18.000]  The toll free number to join us is 888-201-2244-888-2012-244
[3:58:18.000 --> 3:58:27.000]  or 512-646-5400-512-646-5400 or 888-2012-244.
[3:58:27.000 --> 3:58:29.000]  And I guess we've got to go ahead and activate the phone system
[3:58:29.000 --> 3:58:30.000]  to be able to do that.
[3:58:30.000 --> 3:58:32.000]  So call in about 60 seconds.
[3:58:32.000 --> 3:58:34.000]  Mark, continue with whatever you think is important
[3:58:34.000 --> 3:58:36.000]  while we have you here in studio.
[3:58:36.000 --> 3:58:38.000]  Well, again, you hit on the right direction.
[3:58:38.000 --> 3:58:40.000]  You're seeing this in publications,
[3:58:40.000 --> 3:58:43.000]  just like this brief from England,
[3:58:43.000 --> 3:58:46.000]  that it's a totally different age
[3:58:46.000 --> 3:58:48.000]  and that in the past they could have waited.
[3:58:48.000 --> 3:58:50.000]  We wouldn't have known for two or three months, maybe a year
[3:58:50.000 --> 3:58:53.000]  before we found out that, hey, somewhere in an English paper,
[3:58:53.000 --> 3:58:55.000]  the London Times or whatever,
[3:58:55.000 --> 3:58:57.000]  somebody finally looked in a page C14
[3:58:57.000 --> 3:58:59.000]  and lo and behold, here's the exact same thing
[3:58:59.000 --> 3:59:01.000]  that was being talked about in the exact same day,
[3:59:01.000 --> 3:59:03.000]  somewhere in the United States.
[3:59:03.000 --> 3:59:05.000]  The advantage that we have right now
[3:59:05.000 --> 3:59:08.000]  is that the information base and the data systems involved
[3:59:08.000 --> 3:59:11.000]  are just as much in our command as it is with the enemy.
[3:59:11.000 --> 3:59:13.000]  In fact, more so because their assumption,
[3:59:13.000 --> 3:59:15.000]  and for whatever reason, remember,
[3:59:15.000 --> 3:59:17.000]  we got the thinkers, they got the stinkers,
[3:59:17.000 --> 3:59:19.000]  we're in a situation where we're able to cross-colate
[3:59:19.000 --> 3:59:20.000]  in reference.
[3:59:20.000 --> 3:59:22.000]  The other side seems to assume,
[3:59:22.000 --> 3:59:24.000]  and because of the people they chose,
[3:59:24.000 --> 3:59:25.000]  they're in a very narrow band.
[3:59:25.000 --> 3:59:27.000]  These people are not the swiftest,
[3:59:27.000 --> 3:59:29.000]  they're not the sharpest knives in the drawer.
[3:59:29.000 --> 3:59:31.000]  They're all specialized,
[3:59:31.000 --> 3:59:33.000]  they're all specialized in departmentalization.
[3:59:33.000 --> 3:59:35.000]  The very thing that they're trying to foist upon everybody else
[3:59:35.000 --> 3:59:37.000]  is actually becoming their demise.
[3:59:37.000 --> 3:59:39.000]  And the people carrying this out at this level,
[3:59:39.000 --> 3:59:40.000]  they think it's good.
[3:59:40.000 --> 3:59:42.000]  Well, again, that's a matter of what Google,
[3:59:42.000 --> 3:59:43.000]  if, when you create a...
[3:59:43.000 --> 3:59:44.000]  I mean the low level.
[3:59:44.000 --> 3:59:45.000]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[3:59:45.000 --> 3:59:47.000]  When you create a police state,
[3:59:47.000 --> 3:59:49.000]  just like big government,
[3:59:49.000 --> 3:59:51.000]  specific criminal minds will gravitate
[3:59:51.000 --> 3:59:53.000]  to those positions or...
[3:59:53.000 --> 3:59:55.000]  Control freaks.
[3:59:55.000 --> 3:59:56.000]  Control freaks.
[3:59:56.000 --> 3:59:58.000]  And what happens is they may give them another...
[3:59:58.000 --> 4:00:00.000]  One are the zealots who don't care
[4:00:00.000 --> 4:00:01.000]  about who they hurt,
[4:00:01.000 --> 4:00:02.000]  what's going to happen whenever,
[4:00:02.000 --> 4:00:04.000]  because they're into the groove with that.
[4:00:04.000 --> 4:00:06.000]  On the other side, you have
[4:00:06.000 --> 4:00:09.000]  those who literally just would like to hurt people
[4:00:09.000 --> 4:00:11.000]  or are into the power factor,
[4:00:11.000 --> 4:00:13.000]  and they're the ones from the other direction
[4:00:13.000 --> 4:00:15.000]  that know they can manipulate the first group
[4:00:15.000 --> 4:00:16.000]  and utilize them completely.
[4:00:16.000 --> 4:00:18.000]  So they're the minority in both cases.
[4:00:18.000 --> 4:00:20.000]  This is the comical part about this.
[4:00:20.000 --> 4:00:22.000]  They are not the majority.
[4:00:22.000 --> 4:00:24.000]  They could be neutralized very quickly.
[4:00:24.000 --> 4:00:26.000]  If moose season were to open up tomorrow,
[4:00:26.000 --> 4:00:29.000]  there aren't enough moose to go around.
[4:00:29.000 --> 4:00:31.000]  That's why Canada has a moose restricted system,
[4:00:31.000 --> 4:00:33.000]  by the way, for hunting.
[4:00:33.000 --> 4:00:35.000]  So that's what we're seeing here.
[4:00:35.000 --> 4:00:36.000]  Everybody goes,
[4:00:36.000 --> 4:00:37.000]  well, they've got spiffy uniforms.
[4:00:37.000 --> 4:00:39.000]  They get really cool boots.
[4:00:39.000 --> 4:00:40.000]  Oh, and it's black.
[4:00:40.000 --> 4:00:41.000]  Oh, my goodness.
[4:00:41.000 --> 4:00:42.000]  Yeah, it'll look good on my wall.
[4:00:42.000 --> 4:00:43.000]  Right next to the stuff my dad brought back
[4:00:43.000 --> 4:00:44.000]  from World War II,
[4:00:44.000 --> 4:00:45.000]  Japanese uniforms, Japanese swords.
[4:00:45.000 --> 4:00:46.000]  You know, it's really cool.
[4:00:46.000 --> 4:00:48.000]  Black uniform, MP5, HK 91.
[4:00:48.000 --> 4:00:50.000]  Hey, they really look great.
[4:00:50.000 --> 4:00:51.000]  They're mine now.
[4:00:51.000 --> 4:00:52.000]  Well, Mark, I want to say,
[4:00:52.000 --> 4:00:53.000]  I mean, you and I are both trying to have
[4:00:53.000 --> 4:00:54.000]  a peaceful solution to this
[4:00:54.000 --> 4:00:55.000]  and not have World War III.
[4:00:55.000 --> 4:00:58.000]  The point is, is that the public has been trained,
[4:00:58.000 --> 4:01:00.000]  and I've gotten a chance to meet people in business,
[4:01:00.000 --> 4:01:01.000]  high level, Hollywood people.
[4:01:01.000 --> 4:01:03.000]  They're just regular folks, too.
[4:01:03.000 --> 4:01:05.000]  A lot of them are awake, too.
[4:01:05.000 --> 4:01:07.000]  People think that I walk on water,
[4:01:07.000 --> 4:01:08.000]  or you walk on water,
[4:01:08.000 --> 4:01:10.000]  or we're somehow magical, too.
[4:01:10.000 --> 4:01:12.000]  Well, the same goes for people in government.
[4:01:12.000 --> 4:01:14.000]  They think that these elitists are perfect,
[4:01:14.000 --> 4:01:16.000]  or invincible, or magic, or different.
[4:01:16.000 --> 4:01:18.000]  No, they're human beings, too.
[4:01:18.000 --> 4:01:19.000]  They just like everybody else.
[4:01:19.000 --> 4:01:20.000]  And I never, I mean,
[4:01:20.000 --> 4:01:22.000]  I kind of somewhat thought this myself,
[4:01:22.000 --> 4:01:23.000]  that people who were in Hollywood
[4:01:23.000 --> 4:01:25.000]  floated on clouds, or that elites were
[4:01:25.000 --> 4:01:26.000]  smarter than I was.
[4:01:26.000 --> 4:01:28.000]  Only now, as I, you know, got more prominent
[4:01:28.000 --> 4:01:29.000]  and got involved and learned more,
[4:01:29.000 --> 4:01:30.000]  I realized, you know,
[4:01:30.000 --> 4:01:31.000]  that a lot of the people aren't as smart as I am,
[4:01:31.000 --> 4:01:32.000]  and I don't think I'm that smart.
[4:01:32.000 --> 4:01:33.000]  So you're absolutely right.
[4:01:33.000 --> 4:01:36.000]  People need to get past this inferiority complex.
[4:01:36.000 --> 4:01:37.000]  Right.
[4:01:37.000 --> 4:01:38.000]  It's not futile to resist.
[4:01:38.000 --> 4:01:39.000]  It is not futile.
[4:01:39.000 --> 4:01:40.000]  You will not be absorbed.
[4:01:40.000 --> 4:01:41.000]  Just the reverse.
[4:01:41.000 --> 4:01:42.000]  The biggest problem that they've got is...
[4:01:42.000 --> 4:01:43.000]  Yeah, people, our movement,
[4:01:43.000 --> 4:01:44.000]  so many people have it in our minds
[4:01:44.000 --> 4:01:45.000]  that we're beautiful losers,
[4:01:45.000 --> 4:01:46.000]  and that we can't win,
[4:01:46.000 --> 4:01:48.000]  and they freak out when we start winning,
[4:01:48.000 --> 4:01:50.000]  thinking it's some type of sell-out.
[4:01:50.000 --> 4:01:51.000]  No, no, we're prominent.
[4:01:51.000 --> 4:01:53.000]  We're going to wake those people up.
[4:01:53.000 --> 4:01:55.000]  We're going to take the culture over.
[4:01:55.000 --> 4:01:56.000]  That's right.
[4:01:56.000 --> 4:01:57.000]  And one of the things to remember
[4:01:57.000 --> 4:01:58.000]  is the other side is not going to.
[4:01:58.000 --> 4:01:59.000]  This is what...
[4:01:59.000 --> 4:02:00.000]  Well, let's put it this way.
[4:02:00.000 --> 4:02:01.000]  We talked about this before.
[4:02:01.000 --> 4:02:02.000]  Have you ever heard of your enemy
[4:02:02.000 --> 4:02:04.000]  apologize for anything that they say?
[4:02:04.000 --> 4:02:05.000]  No.
[4:02:05.000 --> 4:02:07.000]  Yet we're supposed to bend over backwards,
[4:02:07.000 --> 4:02:09.000]  and they ever apologize for every aspect of our life.
[4:02:09.000 --> 4:02:11.000]  We're supposed to compromise and get in and...
[4:02:11.000 --> 4:02:12.000]  You know what?
[4:02:12.000 --> 4:02:13.000]  Like I said, them first.
[4:02:13.000 --> 4:02:14.000]  Everybody has to have that.
[4:02:14.000 --> 4:02:15.000]  Them first.
[4:02:15.000 --> 4:02:16.000]  You know what?
[4:02:16.000 --> 4:02:18.000]  I've got a number ten-and-a-half-sized military boot here.
[4:02:18.000 --> 4:02:20.000]  I'm going to stick it between the slats of,
[4:02:20.000 --> 4:02:22.000]  you know, the stupid of trying to push us around.
[4:02:22.000 --> 4:02:24.000]  I'm going to run his hind end back on down the road,
[4:02:24.000 --> 4:02:26.000]  give him a backpack full of rocks,
[4:02:26.000 --> 4:02:28.000]  and let him swim halfway back to the spiders.
[4:02:28.000 --> 4:02:30.000]  And that's not that I don't need a peaceful solution,
[4:02:30.000 --> 4:02:31.000]  but my problem is this.
[4:02:31.000 --> 4:02:33.000]  Do you talk to a backed-up toilet?
[4:02:33.000 --> 4:02:35.000]  Do you negotiate with a backed-up toilet?
[4:02:35.000 --> 4:02:36.000]  Have you ever done that?
[4:02:36.000 --> 4:02:38.000]  Has anybody out there listening ever done that?
[4:02:38.000 --> 4:02:39.000]  You know how stupid that sounds?
[4:02:39.000 --> 4:02:40.000]  At a given point,
[4:02:40.000 --> 4:02:42.000]  you're going to have to go in and get dirty.
[4:02:42.000 --> 4:02:44.000]  In order to make that toilet work again,
[4:02:44.000 --> 4:02:45.000]  you're going to have to go in.
[4:02:45.000 --> 4:02:46.000]  Somebody is going to have to go in
[4:02:46.000 --> 4:02:48.000]  and clean things up
[4:02:48.000 --> 4:02:50.000]  so that the toilet works again.
[4:02:50.000 --> 4:02:53.000]  Now, you can either, you know, turn your nose to it
[4:02:53.000 --> 4:02:55.000]  and start using a five-gallon bucket out behind the house
[4:02:55.000 --> 4:02:57.000]  and figure, well, we'll just shut the door in that bathroom.
[4:02:57.000 --> 4:03:00.000]  Or you can enjoy indoor plumbing and civilization
[4:03:00.000 --> 4:03:05.000]  by cleaning up the mess.
[4:03:05.000 --> 4:03:08.000]  And that means you don't negotiate with a backed-up toilet.
[4:03:08.000 --> 4:03:10.000]  That means that basically you get the plunger
[4:03:10.000 --> 4:03:12.000]  and you stomp its hind end.
[4:03:12.000 --> 4:03:13.000]  No, no, I agree with you.
[4:03:13.000 --> 4:03:15.000]  My old point is a lot of people in the mid-90s
[4:03:15.000 --> 4:03:17.000]  and late-90s wanted to go to war.
[4:03:17.000 --> 4:03:19.000]  It is still a solution.
[4:03:19.000 --> 4:03:21.000]  I mean, you have a conflict, but my point is
[4:03:21.000 --> 4:03:22.000]  we have exposed them.
[4:03:22.000 --> 4:03:24.000]  We have politically damaged them.
[4:03:24.000 --> 4:03:27.000]  And I think God hadn't turned into a shooting war.
[4:03:27.000 --> 4:03:29.000]  Well, in a way, to a degree, the problem with that
[4:03:29.000 --> 4:03:32.000]  is we have been successful and we must acknowledge our successes,
[4:03:32.000 --> 4:03:35.000]  but we probably would have been better off in a war in 1995.
[4:03:35.000 --> 4:03:37.000]  Because with each step,
[4:03:37.000 --> 4:03:38.000]  we're going to have a deeper conflict.
[4:03:38.000 --> 4:03:40.000]  I've argued this for years.
[4:03:40.000 --> 4:03:42.000]  If you wait both sides,
[4:03:42.000 --> 4:03:44.000]  in fact, our side is we're not going anywhere.
[4:03:44.000 --> 4:03:45.000]  We're right here where we've been.
[4:03:45.000 --> 4:03:47.000]  We live here.
[4:03:47.000 --> 4:03:49.000]  But your enemy has brought more and more resource to bear,
[4:03:49.000 --> 4:03:51.000]  so it will cost you more to win.
[4:03:51.000 --> 4:03:53.000]  But our numbers have...
[4:03:53.000 --> 4:03:56.000]  I think we have more resources now than they do.
[4:03:56.000 --> 4:03:58.000]  Exactly, but that's where we get down to the whole argument
[4:03:58.000 --> 4:04:01.000]  for years of what's called a battlefield on gimbals.
[4:04:01.000 --> 4:04:06.000]  In other words, both sides are moving towards each other.
[4:04:06.000 --> 4:04:09.000]  The battlefield changes depending upon the amount of weight
[4:04:09.000 --> 4:04:11.000]  that moves the pivoting gimbled wall,
[4:04:11.000 --> 4:04:14.000]  but at a given point, somebody is going to make contact
[4:04:14.000 --> 4:04:15.000]  and come head to head.
[4:04:15.000 --> 4:04:17.000]  It's not an if, it is just a win.
[4:04:17.000 --> 4:04:19.000]  Well, it took more than 15 years for it to start
[4:04:19.000 --> 4:04:21.000]  in our Revolutionary War.
[4:04:21.000 --> 4:04:22.000]  That's right.
[4:04:22.000 --> 4:04:24.000]  And again, here, if you look at what we're seeing right now,
[4:04:24.000 --> 4:04:26.000]  let me point this out.
[4:04:26.000 --> 4:04:27.000]  How...
[4:04:27.000 --> 4:04:29.000]  Well, of course, in England, my personal attitude with them
[4:04:29.000 --> 4:04:31.000]  is that unless they turn around and basically ban it
[4:04:31.000 --> 4:04:33.000]  whoever is there right now pushing this program,
[4:04:33.000 --> 4:04:35.000]  how are you going to get rid of a bunch of sycophants
[4:04:35.000 --> 4:04:37.000]  that are raised as nutcases from youth?
[4:04:37.000 --> 4:04:39.000]  A bunch of little spies on power trips.
[4:04:39.000 --> 4:04:42.000]  In fact, what this is, is these are the interior police.
[4:04:42.000 --> 4:04:44.000]  What I've argued for years, and I will do it again...
[4:04:44.000 --> 4:04:45.000]  NKVD.
[4:04:45.000 --> 4:04:47.000]  Yes, in Russia, you don't see Hollywood
[4:04:47.000 --> 4:04:49.000]  doing any movies about communist Russia.
[4:04:49.000 --> 4:04:52.000]  You can talk about Germany till you're blue in the face.
[4:04:52.000 --> 4:04:54.000]  Before World War II, during World War II
[4:04:54.000 --> 4:04:56.000]  and after World War II, Joseph Stalin killed
[4:04:56.000 --> 4:04:59.000]  approximately 100 million people between Georgia, the Ukraine,
[4:04:59.000 --> 4:05:01.000]  the Stans, and God knows how many other places
[4:05:01.000 --> 4:05:03.000]  we can go right on down the shopping list.
[4:05:03.000 --> 4:05:05.000]  Hollywood won't make movies about that
[4:05:05.000 --> 4:05:09.000]  because Hollywood liked that.
[4:05:09.000 --> 4:05:14.000]  And because Hollywood was part of that.
[4:05:14.000 --> 4:05:15.000]  No illusion.
[4:05:15.000 --> 4:05:16.000]  You can talk about Germany.
[4:05:16.000 --> 4:05:20.000]  Germany in 1945, while Hitler was dust in Berlin,
[4:05:20.000 --> 4:05:22.000]  10 years later, Joseph Stalin was still butchering people
[4:05:22.000 --> 4:05:25.000]  with reckless abandon, and Hollywood and...
[4:05:25.000 --> 4:05:27.000]  Now it's come out, well, we always told people,
[4:05:27.000 --> 4:05:30.000]  the CIA sections, you'll never forget about it,
[4:05:30.000 --> 4:05:32.000]  seven or eight years ago on History Channel,
[4:05:32.000 --> 4:05:34.000]  and it's now been declassified.
[4:05:34.000 --> 4:05:36.000]  David Rockefeller's written about it in the New York Times
[4:05:36.000 --> 4:05:37.000]  and in his books.
[4:05:37.000 --> 4:05:39.000]  They put Mao in and he killed...
[4:05:39.000 --> 4:05:42.000]  Their government says 60 million in official Chinese records.
[4:05:42.000 --> 4:05:43.000]  And we know it's more.
[4:05:43.000 --> 4:05:44.000]  And we know it's more like 85.
[4:05:44.000 --> 4:05:46.000]  Even the Cultural Revolution in the first year
[4:05:46.000 --> 4:05:48.000]  killed 15.5 million acknowledged
[4:05:48.000 --> 4:05:50.000]  through intelligence sources in the day.
[4:05:50.000 --> 4:05:53.000]  And this was the starvation of China now.
[4:05:53.000 --> 4:05:55.000]  And I've had former White House historians and analysts
[4:05:55.000 --> 4:05:58.000]  on, like Richard C. Cook, I have had Ray McGovern on,
[4:05:58.000 --> 4:06:00.000]  former CIA, I have had all these analysts on.
[4:06:00.000 --> 4:06:02.000]  They say the government is gearing up
[4:06:02.000 --> 4:06:04.000]  for a mass culling in the U.S.
[4:06:04.000 --> 4:06:06.000]  They want to fully do that.
[4:06:06.000 --> 4:06:08.000]  Well, let me ask you something, guys.
[4:06:08.000 --> 4:06:09.000]  What does that mean?
[4:06:09.000 --> 4:06:11.000]  Because, you see, when you give these numbers,
[4:06:11.000 --> 4:06:13.000]  I'll give you an example of how that works.
[4:06:13.000 --> 4:06:15.000]  How many people live in Austin, Texas?
[4:06:15.000 --> 4:06:18.000]  Metro, about a million in the city, about 800,000.
[4:06:18.000 --> 4:06:21.000]  Okay, so we're looking at 1.5 million to 1.8 million.
[4:06:21.000 --> 4:06:22.000]  We'll use a number here.
[4:06:22.000 --> 4:06:24.000]  No, no, in total, it's only about...
[4:06:24.000 --> 4:06:25.000]  It's about a million.
[4:06:25.000 --> 4:06:27.000]  I'm going to say, with the urban.
[4:06:27.000 --> 4:06:28.000]  We're talking about...
[4:06:28.000 --> 4:06:30.000]  And within a reasonable walking distance,
[4:06:30.000 --> 4:06:32.000]  there's about 1.5 million people, plus or minus.
[4:06:32.000 --> 4:06:34.000]  It's a little more, but we're going to use that number.
[4:06:34.000 --> 4:06:38.000]  We just gave a number of 15 million people killed in one year.
[4:06:38.000 --> 4:06:40.000]  In one year, that's 10 Austins.
[4:06:40.000 --> 4:06:42.000]  Yeah, now here's the way for people to understand
[4:06:42.000 --> 4:06:44.000]  that I want you to go to the west side of this city,
[4:06:44.000 --> 4:06:46.000]  and I want you to imagine walking
[4:06:46.000 --> 4:06:48.000]  from one side of this city to the next,
[4:06:48.000 --> 4:06:51.000]  and everywhere you go where a person was standing,
[4:06:51.000 --> 4:06:54.000]  they are now laying dead.
[4:06:54.000 --> 4:06:59.000]  Every man, every woman, every child, the cats, the dogs,
[4:06:59.000 --> 4:07:01.000]  they'd kill everything and anything
[4:07:01.000 --> 4:07:04.000]  if they felt it would empower them in some way.
[4:07:04.000 --> 4:07:06.000]  Now, you're not talking one-time Austin.
[4:07:06.000 --> 4:07:08.000]  You're talking in Michigan, for instance,
[4:07:08.000 --> 4:07:11.000]  walking from the upper peninsula to the bottom of the state
[4:07:11.000 --> 4:07:15.000]  with nothing but death before you.
[4:07:15.000 --> 4:07:16.000]  Now, I better...
[4:07:16.000 --> 4:07:19.000]  You better all ask this real quick of every American out there
[4:07:19.000 --> 4:07:22.000]  is, what do you want of this country?
[4:07:22.000 --> 4:07:23.000]  And here's the thing.
[4:07:23.000 --> 4:07:26.000]  Do you think you're going to ride this storm out and duck this?
[4:07:26.000 --> 4:07:28.000]  The agenda that's being presented...
[4:07:28.000 --> 4:07:31.000]  Oh, by the way, a lot of you are serving it,
[4:07:31.000 --> 4:07:33.000]  mainline conservatives giggling and laughing.
[4:07:33.000 --> 4:07:36.000]  I saw an ad on Drudge saying...
[4:07:36.000 --> 4:07:38.000]  a T-shirt saying, I love waterboarding.
[4:07:38.000 --> 4:07:39.000]  I'd rather be waterboarding.
[4:07:39.000 --> 4:07:41.000]  If they can do that to somebody else, that's a set of precedent.
[4:07:41.000 --> 4:07:43.000]  They want to do that to you, you little fools.
[4:07:43.000 --> 4:07:45.000]  You own some property, you own some land,
[4:07:45.000 --> 4:07:46.000]  you've licked their boots well.
[4:07:46.000 --> 4:07:48.000]  You're going to be the first going in the ground.
[4:07:48.000 --> 4:07:49.000]  Yeah, in fact, you're the first on the menu
[4:07:49.000 --> 4:07:51.000]  because you're the easiest one to grab.
[4:07:51.000 --> 4:07:52.000]  That's one of the things that happened
[4:07:52.000 --> 4:07:54.000]  with the Cultural Revolution in China.
[4:07:54.000 --> 4:07:55.000]  First on the menu.
[4:07:55.000 --> 4:07:56.000]  It happened in Russia.
[4:07:56.000 --> 4:07:57.000]  That's right.
[4:07:57.000 --> 4:07:58.000]  In Russia.
[4:07:58.000 --> 4:07:59.000]  Here's a situation where you have a lot of...
[4:07:59.000 --> 4:08:01.000]  Anybody who had glasses or had fillings
[4:08:01.000 --> 4:08:03.000]  was deemed to be middle class.
[4:08:03.000 --> 4:08:04.000]  You were killed.
[4:08:04.000 --> 4:08:05.000]  That's right.
[4:08:05.000 --> 4:08:06.000]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski engineered that
[4:08:06.000 --> 4:08:07.000]  and brags about it.
[4:08:07.000 --> 4:08:08.000]  And in fact, the very voice you hear here
[4:08:08.000 --> 4:08:09.000]  with Henry Kissinger,
[4:08:09.000 --> 4:08:12.000]  that is one of the demons who absolutely helped to engineer it
[4:08:12.000 --> 4:08:15.000]  because he empowered Zbigniew Brzezinski
[4:08:15.000 --> 4:08:16.000]  and many others.
[4:08:16.000 --> 4:08:17.000]  That's his brother, Jen.
[4:08:17.000 --> 4:08:18.000]  And conduit.
[4:08:18.000 --> 4:08:19.000]  He created the conduit of resources
[4:08:19.000 --> 4:08:21.000]  that allowed them to be able to do it.
[4:08:21.000 --> 4:08:23.000]  Now, they're not working in a vacuum.
[4:08:23.000 --> 4:08:24.000]  And here's the problem, people.
[4:08:24.000 --> 4:08:26.000]  We're not talking over there.
[4:08:26.000 --> 4:08:28.000]  We're talking inside the United States
[4:08:28.000 --> 4:08:30.000]  on a scale that most people...
[4:08:30.000 --> 4:08:32.000]  That's what bends their mind,
[4:08:32.000 --> 4:08:35.000]  is the idea that they have to look at this realistically.
[4:08:35.000 --> 4:08:36.000]  The numbers.
[4:08:36.000 --> 4:08:39.000]  If we go by the litmus test of history,
[4:08:39.000 --> 4:08:41.000]  the scale of history,
[4:08:41.000 --> 4:08:43.000]  we have demonstrations over and over again
[4:08:43.000 --> 4:08:45.000]  of what socialism does.
[4:08:45.000 --> 4:08:48.000]  And if you look at Chinese model versus Russian model
[4:08:48.000 --> 4:08:51.000]  versus Ukraine, other places,
[4:08:51.000 --> 4:08:52.000]  we're talking...
[4:08:52.000 --> 4:08:54.000]  They're probably planning on killing
[4:08:54.000 --> 4:08:57.000]  in the entire multi-phase program,
[4:08:57.000 --> 4:08:59.000]  what, 60, 70 million?
[4:08:59.000 --> 4:09:00.000]  If they were to have their way.
[4:09:00.000 --> 4:09:02.000]  But the difference is, unlike Russia and unlike the...
[4:09:02.000 --> 4:09:03.000]  We have guns.
[4:09:03.000 --> 4:09:04.000]  Yeah, we have...
[4:09:04.000 --> 4:09:05.000]  We are very well armed.
[4:09:05.000 --> 4:09:06.000]  And if 1% of 100 million gun owners
[4:09:06.000 --> 4:09:08.000]  decide to fight, that's 1 million people.
[4:09:08.000 --> 4:09:09.000]  I'd be happy if just...
[4:09:09.000 --> 4:09:10.000]  Here's the problem.
[4:09:10.000 --> 4:09:11.000]  And they don't want anybody to think about this.
[4:09:11.000 --> 4:09:14.000]  Everybody listening has one firearm.
[4:09:14.000 --> 4:09:17.000]  Everybody listening walks out and takes their moose
[4:09:17.000 --> 4:09:19.000]  and just walks away from the war.
[4:09:19.000 --> 4:09:23.000]  There are not enough moose to go around.
[4:09:23.000 --> 4:09:26.000]  The black uniformed or blue beret moose
[4:09:26.000 --> 4:09:30.000]  are simply not insufficient numbers.
[4:09:30.000 --> 4:09:32.000]  You don't have to even fight the whole war.
[4:09:32.000 --> 4:09:34.000]  If you went out and just plugged one
[4:09:34.000 --> 4:09:36.000]  and let it sit there and twitch
[4:09:36.000 --> 4:09:38.000]  and strip it for whatever's there,
[4:09:38.000 --> 4:09:40.000]  what would they do?
[4:09:40.000 --> 4:09:43.000]  See, what Alexander Solzhenitsyn said.
[4:09:43.000 --> 4:09:46.000]  Oh, how we burned in the camps,
[4:09:46.000 --> 4:09:49.000]  knowing full well that we had had nothing to lose.
[4:09:49.000 --> 4:09:52.000]  And if we had waited when the mass arrests began,
[4:09:52.000 --> 4:09:55.000]  with cudgels and sharp objects,
[4:09:55.000 --> 4:09:58.000]  the wretched machine for lack of operatives
[4:09:58.000 --> 4:10:01.000]  would have ground to a halt.
[4:10:01.000 --> 4:10:03.000]  In a week.
[4:10:03.000 --> 4:10:04.000]  So here again, people.
[4:10:04.000 --> 4:10:05.000]  What have you got to lose?
[4:10:05.000 --> 4:10:06.000]  Nothing.
[4:10:06.000 --> 4:10:07.000]  What have you got to gain?
[4:10:07.000 --> 4:10:08.000]  Absolutely everything.
[4:10:08.000 --> 4:10:09.000]  You know what?
[4:10:09.000 --> 4:10:10.000]  The only thing I'll say is this.
[4:10:10.000 --> 4:10:12.000]  There's this war, and it is going to be a war,
[4:10:12.000 --> 4:10:14.000]  and it'd be nice to say that it'd be peaceable,
[4:10:14.000 --> 4:10:16.000]  but it's not going to be because you're dealing with an animal
[4:10:16.000 --> 4:10:18.000]  that is a vicious legbiter.
[4:10:18.000 --> 4:10:21.000]  You ever tried to argue with a dog that's a biter?
[4:10:21.000 --> 4:10:23.000]  There isn't a whole lot of arguing you can do.
[4:10:23.000 --> 4:10:26.000]  You either, A, shoot it, or have a really good two by four
[4:10:26.000 --> 4:10:28.000]  and smack it side the head and keep her down.
[4:10:28.000 --> 4:10:31.000]  Of course, you can cage it, which would be really good.
[4:10:31.000 --> 4:10:33.000]  First containment is a nice idea.
[4:10:33.000 --> 4:10:36.000]  Usually the owner does that, by the way, if he's smart.
[4:10:36.000 --> 4:10:39.000]  But in this case, you're the owner of these dogs.
[4:10:39.000 --> 4:10:41.000]  They plan on just simply letting them run the town.
[4:10:41.000 --> 4:10:43.000]  Well, that's already happening.
[4:10:43.000 --> 4:10:46.000]  Every day, cops just run up to a guy on a bicycle,
[4:10:46.000 --> 4:10:48.000]  no reason, and slam his head in the concrete,
[4:10:48.000 --> 4:10:50.000]  and then charge him, and it's on video,
[4:10:50.000 --> 4:10:53.000]  and they don't care, or throwing a guy off a bridge
[4:10:53.000 --> 4:10:55.000]  and tasering him 19 times and laughing.
[4:10:55.000 --> 4:10:58.000]  My whole issue is, you say a lot of police,
[4:10:58.000 --> 4:11:00.000]  a lot of people in your family.
[4:11:00.000 --> 4:11:01.000]  Call them peace officers.
[4:11:01.000 --> 4:11:02.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[4:11:02.000 --> 4:11:04.000]  Peace officers, they are good.
[4:11:04.000 --> 4:11:05.000]  They're on our side.
[4:11:05.000 --> 4:11:06.000]  They're not doing all of this.
[4:11:06.000 --> 4:11:09.000]  So it's certainly not time for going out after moose.
[4:11:09.000 --> 4:11:11.000]  It's a minority issue, first of all.
[4:11:11.000 --> 4:11:12.000]  But here's the problem.
[4:11:12.000 --> 4:11:13.000]  There's going to be a given point
[4:11:13.000 --> 4:11:15.000]  when you're going to reach the limit, period.
[4:11:15.000 --> 4:11:17.000]  There's just simply, that's all there is to it.
[4:11:17.000 --> 4:11:19.000]  And those men, I've had men walk right up to me and say,
[4:11:19.000 --> 4:11:20.000]  Mark, you don't know who I am.
[4:11:20.000 --> 4:11:21.000]  I'm deputy so-and-so.
[4:11:21.000 --> 4:11:24.000]  I just want you to look at my face, remember who I am,
[4:11:24.000 --> 4:11:26.000]  because if I'm in uniform when this starts,
[4:11:26.000 --> 4:11:28.000]  the first thing that's disappearing is a uniform,
[4:11:28.000 --> 4:11:30.000]  and I'm going to be with my family,
[4:11:30.000 --> 4:11:32.000]  and we're already armed, and we're with you.
[4:11:32.000 --> 4:11:35.000]  And the reason they say that is because their perception is
[4:11:35.000 --> 4:11:37.000]  that they would like everybody to understand
[4:11:37.000 --> 4:11:41.000]  they're not part of this, and they won't participate.
[4:11:41.000 --> 4:11:43.000]  And I can say this, but I cannot mention names.
[4:11:43.000 --> 4:11:46.000]  I have watched this happen in the last year.
[4:11:46.000 --> 4:11:48.000]  They've already tried to orchestrate something else.
[4:11:48.000 --> 4:11:49.000]  With you.
[4:11:49.000 --> 4:11:51.000]  It already failed.
[4:11:51.000 --> 4:11:54.000]  Yeah, you just spent seven years on video for doing nothing.
[4:11:54.000 --> 4:11:55.000]  They ran you off the road.
[4:11:55.000 --> 4:11:56.000]  Exactly.
[4:11:56.000 --> 4:11:58.000]  Just like they run 15 feet over the side of the street
[4:11:58.000 --> 4:12:00.000]  and knock a guy off a bicycle and then charge him.
[4:12:00.000 --> 4:12:01.000]  Right, exactly.
[4:12:01.000 --> 4:12:03.000]  And the point is that they're pressing the envelope,
[4:12:03.000 --> 4:12:04.000]  but here's the thing.
[4:12:04.000 --> 4:12:06.000]  There are many people, and they will tell you the same thing,
[4:12:06.000 --> 4:12:08.000]  that they are expecting to fight,
[4:12:08.000 --> 4:12:11.000]  because the rabid ones that are chosen for authority
[4:12:11.000 --> 4:12:14.000]  are not the thinking ones.
[4:12:14.000 --> 4:12:16.000]  You have to get outside this box
[4:12:16.000 --> 4:12:18.000]  that you're going to negotiate with a backed-up toilet.
[4:12:18.000 --> 4:12:21.000]  The backed-up toilet, in fact, this one has wheels.
[4:12:21.000 --> 4:12:23.000]  It plans them being rolled down through your neighborhood.
[4:12:23.000 --> 4:12:24.000]  Okay?
[4:12:24.000 --> 4:12:26.000]  And that's the problem.
[4:12:26.000 --> 4:12:28.000]  Looking at them is nothing more than a backed-up toilet.
[4:12:28.000 --> 4:12:29.000]  How would you fix it?
[4:12:29.000 --> 4:12:31.000]  Break out the plunger and get rid of the problem.
[4:12:31.000 --> 4:12:34.000]  Now, we are going to, we do get to choose.
[4:12:34.000 --> 4:12:36.000]  One of the mistakes made here is I will ask again,
[4:12:36.000 --> 4:12:39.000]  I want somebody to go to the National Archives,
[4:12:39.000 --> 4:12:41.000]  and I want them to show me the vote
[4:12:41.000 --> 4:12:43.000]  that took us into the American Revolution.
[4:12:43.000 --> 4:12:46.000]  The American Revolution started on April 19, 1775.
[4:12:46.000 --> 4:12:48.000]  I want you to show me the ballot box,
[4:12:48.000 --> 4:12:50.000]  and I want you to show me the counting of the votes.
[4:12:50.000 --> 4:12:51.000]  Where is it?
[4:12:51.000 --> 4:12:53.000]  No, it started when they started shooting at each other.
[4:12:53.000 --> 4:12:55.000]  It started when one man said,
[4:12:55.000 --> 4:12:57.000]  you know what, I've been out here seven times.
[4:12:57.000 --> 4:12:58.000]  Paul made his ride.
[4:12:58.000 --> 4:12:59.000]  He told everybody, get up.
[4:12:59.000 --> 4:13:00.000]  We all got up.
[4:13:00.000 --> 4:13:01.000]  The British came out.
[4:13:01.000 --> 4:13:02.000]  The cowards ran.
[4:13:02.000 --> 4:13:04.000]  They came out, and eventually,
[4:13:04.000 --> 4:13:06.000]  remember, when the American Revolution started,
[4:13:06.000 --> 4:13:08.000]  the British had to sneak out of Boston.
[4:13:08.000 --> 4:13:11.000]  The Patriot movement was watching everything that they were doing.
[4:13:11.000 --> 4:13:13.000]  The counties knew that when they moved,
[4:13:13.000 --> 4:13:15.000]  they had to mobilize the militias,
[4:13:15.000 --> 4:13:17.000]  and it was made up of all of the people.
[4:13:17.000 --> 4:13:19.000]  And each time they went out, and they stopped,
[4:13:19.000 --> 4:13:20.000]  and they went back.
[4:13:20.000 --> 4:13:21.000]  And each time they went out, they stopped.
[4:13:21.000 --> 4:13:23.000]  And this is part of history that they have to try
[4:13:23.000 --> 4:13:25.000]  and eliminate because, wait a minute,
[4:13:25.000 --> 4:13:27.000]  they're the most powerful army on the planet.
[4:13:27.000 --> 4:13:28.000]  What were they afraid of?
[4:13:28.000 --> 4:13:30.000]  They were afraid of the people
[4:13:30.000 --> 4:13:32.000]  because there weren't enough moose.
[4:13:32.000 --> 4:13:34.000]  Finally, on April 19th, somebody got stupid.
[4:13:34.000 --> 4:13:36.000]  They figured, well, we just got to press the envelope.
[4:13:36.000 --> 4:13:38.000]  One man, probably on our side,
[4:13:38.000 --> 4:13:42.000]  probably a 20-year veteran of the French and Indian wars,
[4:13:42.000 --> 4:13:43.000]  said, I'm 62 years old.
[4:13:43.000 --> 4:13:44.000]  I ain't getting any younger,
[4:13:44.000 --> 4:13:46.000]  and I'm not going to do this anymore. Boom!
[4:13:46.000 --> 4:13:49.000]  And he voted with a one-ounce chunk of lead.
[4:13:49.000 --> 4:13:53.000]  The lead was cast as a residing vote or resounding vote.
[4:13:53.000 --> 4:13:56.000]  It was placed in the red coat ballot box.
[4:13:56.000 --> 4:13:59.000]  And then the red coat ballot box,
[4:13:59.000 --> 4:14:01.000]  the red coats cast a whole bunch of ballots,
[4:14:01.000 --> 4:14:03.000]  the Patriots cast a whole bunch of ballots,
[4:14:03.000 --> 4:14:05.000]  and the militia withdrew from the election,
[4:14:05.000 --> 4:14:07.000]  so to speak, for a little bit of time,
[4:14:07.000 --> 4:14:10.000]  in the fields out of Lexington proper.
[4:14:10.000 --> 4:14:12.000]  The British collected themselves,
[4:14:12.000 --> 4:14:14.000]  went to look for another voting process at Concord,
[4:14:14.000 --> 4:14:16.000]  and they found out that they were on the losing side,
[4:14:16.000 --> 4:14:18.000]  and the number of votes cast
[4:14:18.000 --> 4:14:20.000]  were in favor of the Patriot effort,
[4:14:20.000 --> 4:14:22.000]  and the largest military force on the planet,
[4:14:22.000 --> 4:14:23.000]  backed by a name...
[4:14:23.000 --> 4:14:25.000]  And that's the problem with this lawless government
[4:14:25.000 --> 4:14:26.000]  and all of its crimes,
[4:14:26.000 --> 4:14:30.000]  is it is pushing everyone into a law of the jungle scenario
[4:14:30.000 --> 4:14:34.000]  where the cartridge box is now the ballot box.
[4:14:34.000 --> 4:14:36.000]  They're hoping for a reaction.
[4:14:36.000 --> 4:14:38.000]  Notice that I'm not shouting.
[4:14:38.000 --> 4:14:41.000]  I'm responding.
[4:14:41.000 --> 4:14:43.000]  I have a plan.
[4:14:43.000 --> 4:14:46.000]  There are millions of soldiers and former soldiers out there
[4:14:46.000 --> 4:14:49.000]  that don't want to fight,
[4:14:49.000 --> 4:14:51.000]  but they have a plan, too.
[4:14:51.000 --> 4:14:54.000]  And we all understand how to wage war.
[4:14:54.000 --> 4:14:56.000]  It is what we did.
[4:14:56.000 --> 4:14:57.000]  I was a trainer.
[4:14:57.000 --> 4:14:59.000]  I was an opt-for training commander.
[4:14:59.000 --> 4:15:02.000]  I have managed virtually tens of thousands of men.
[4:15:02.000 --> 4:15:04.000]  That job hasn't changed,
[4:15:04.000 --> 4:15:06.000]  and my experience hasn't changed.
[4:15:06.000 --> 4:15:08.000]  And a lot of other men, just like me,
[4:15:08.000 --> 4:15:10.000]  and men with far more experience
[4:15:10.000 --> 4:15:12.000]  with two and three wars under their belt,
[4:15:12.000 --> 4:15:15.000]  are on our side simply asking the question,
[4:15:15.000 --> 4:15:17.000]  how could the American people be so stupid
[4:15:17.000 --> 4:15:19.000]  as to let this happen or put up with it?
[4:15:19.000 --> 4:15:21.000]  At a given point, those men are going to...
[4:15:21.000 --> 4:15:23.000]  Well, let me just list some of the things.
[4:15:23.000 --> 4:15:25.000]  We have illegal aliens who are felons.
[4:15:25.000 --> 4:15:27.000]  The mainstream news admits that's the prize.
[4:15:27.000 --> 4:15:28.000]  A felon who is a foreigner.
[4:15:28.000 --> 4:15:30.000]  They're filling the military up with that.
[4:15:30.000 --> 4:15:32.000]  Mercenaries, foreign troops.
[4:15:32.000 --> 4:15:35.000]  I played Bill Moyers yesterday with Israeli troops in the U.S.
[4:15:35.000 --> 4:15:38.000]  I mean, this is now on PBS saying it, you know.
[4:15:38.000 --> 4:15:40.000]  So all of this is going on.
[4:15:40.000 --> 4:15:44.000]  My only point is, I don't want to start a hot war
[4:15:44.000 --> 4:15:48.000]  when we are in the Info War destroying them right now.
[4:15:48.000 --> 4:15:50.000]  We are going to have to be ready to do both.
[4:15:50.000 --> 4:15:52.000]  We must be prepared as the militia
[4:15:52.000 --> 4:15:55.000]  to, if need be, defend any element of the patriot movement.
[4:15:55.000 --> 4:15:57.000]  So for you, Mark, and we've got to take a few calls,
[4:15:57.000 --> 4:15:58.000]  because I've got to go.
[4:15:58.000 --> 4:15:59.000]  Yeah, you've got to go.
[4:15:59.000 --> 4:16:03.000]  So what is the line of the sand for you?
[4:16:03.000 --> 4:16:05.000]  I think that if there's a...
[4:16:05.000 --> 4:16:07.000]  And again, this was planned on for...
[4:16:07.000 --> 4:16:08.000]  Let's see.
[4:16:08.000 --> 4:16:11.000]  We knew as of November of 1994 that in March...
[4:16:11.000 --> 4:16:14.000]  But from March 21st to March 23rd of 1995,
[4:16:14.000 --> 4:16:17.000]  they were planning mass arrests of patriots across the United States.
[4:16:17.000 --> 4:16:20.000]  So you got on air and said they were planning to stage a terror attack?
[4:16:20.000 --> 4:16:21.000]  We told everybody about it.
[4:16:21.000 --> 4:16:23.000]  So this is before Oklahoma City.
[4:16:23.000 --> 4:16:25.000]  Remember, that would have been the premise for the government
[4:16:25.000 --> 4:16:27.000]  doing the bombing and saying the patriots did it.
[4:16:27.000 --> 4:16:29.000]  So Oklahoma City happened in a vacuum,
[4:16:29.000 --> 4:16:31.000]  because we flat out said, here's how it's going to work.
[4:16:31.000 --> 4:16:33.000]  If anybody is picked up,
[4:16:33.000 --> 4:16:36.000]  if you try to grab a whole bunch of people, you will die.
[4:16:36.000 --> 4:16:38.000]  I looked right at one person and said,
[4:16:38.000 --> 4:16:39.000]  what do you think is going to happen?
[4:16:39.000 --> 4:16:41.000]  I said, the only thing you need to bring is a whole hell of a lot of body bags,
[4:16:41.000 --> 4:16:43.000]  because ain't nobody going to put up with it,
[4:16:43.000 --> 4:16:45.000]  and you're going to end up with a whole lot of dead people.
[4:16:45.000 --> 4:16:47.000]  So you are the ones who are going to be at fault for starting this thing,
[4:16:47.000 --> 4:16:49.000]  not us, because nobody's going to put up with this anymore.
[4:16:49.000 --> 4:16:51.000]  And that did not happen in a vacuum.
[4:16:51.000 --> 4:16:53.000]  That started in 1988 with the ATF,
[4:16:53.000 --> 4:16:56.000]  a series of abuses that went on for five years before Ruby Ridge.
[4:16:56.000 --> 4:16:59.000]  Where they killed women, they killed men, they attacked people.
[4:16:59.000 --> 4:17:00.000]  Ruby Ridge did not happen.
[4:17:00.000 --> 4:17:01.000]  Setting precedence, trial balloons.
[4:17:01.000 --> 4:17:04.000]  Progressively moving forward so that by the time they're done,
[4:17:04.000 --> 4:17:08.000]  in the year 1993, everybody saw Waco on national television.
[4:17:08.000 --> 4:17:11.000]  And Waco was a progressive, cascading,
[4:17:11.000 --> 4:17:16.000]  it was the culmination of five to six years of ongoing abuses.
[4:17:16.000 --> 4:17:18.000]  Now their logic was, I'll keep pressing, I'll keep pressing.
[4:17:18.000 --> 4:17:21.000]  After all, you'll have to acquiesce, you'll have to acquiesce.
[4:17:21.000 --> 4:17:23.000]  And they weren't, they were looking to show them.
[4:17:23.000 --> 4:17:25.000]  I think they were looking to start a fight.
[4:17:25.000 --> 4:17:28.000]  No, they were looking to show you that they could kick at,
[4:17:28.000 --> 4:17:30.000]  excuse me, kick Rumpus and take names.
[4:17:30.000 --> 4:17:33.000]  And the logic there was to also puff up the infantry that are doing the job.
[4:17:33.000 --> 4:17:35.000]  Give them a few victory shooting up churches.
[4:17:35.000 --> 4:17:37.000]  Secret police have to, I mean, they have no...
[4:17:37.000 --> 4:17:38.000]  They've got to have blood.
[4:17:38.000 --> 4:17:39.000]  They have no spine.
[4:17:39.000 --> 4:17:40.000]  They're cowards.
[4:17:40.000 --> 4:17:41.000]  Okay, just like you see here,
[4:17:41.000 --> 4:17:44.000]  popping a guy on a bike with three guys with a car
[4:17:44.000 --> 4:17:46.000]  or two guys with a car is nothing to me.
[4:17:46.000 --> 4:17:49.000]  That shows me that you're dealing with a pea brain and a thug.
[4:17:49.000 --> 4:17:50.000]  Okay.
[4:17:50.000 --> 4:17:53.000]  When you attack a church with grandmas, grandpas, women and children
[4:17:53.000 --> 4:17:55.000]  and all the working men away, that's what savages do.
[4:17:55.000 --> 4:17:57.000]  They wait till the men were in the field and then they attack the fortress
[4:17:57.000 --> 4:17:58.000]  or they attack the town.
[4:17:58.000 --> 4:18:01.000]  The Indians would always attack when the men were in the fields
[4:18:01.000 --> 4:18:04.000]  or working because they'd be away from the treasure.
[4:18:04.000 --> 4:18:07.000]  That's exactly what the savages did at Waco, the exact same way.
[4:18:07.000 --> 4:18:09.000]  And everybody saw it on national television,
[4:18:09.000 --> 4:18:12.000]  and it still failed because what it did
[4:18:12.000 --> 4:18:16.000]  is it demonstrated what we tried to explain to everybody behind the scenes
[4:18:16.000 --> 4:18:18.000]  long before I did American Parallel.
[4:18:18.000 --> 4:18:19.000]  Now, the same thing is true now.
[4:18:19.000 --> 4:18:21.000]  It's going to be the same scenario.
[4:18:21.000 --> 4:18:22.000]  At some point, they're going to be stupid.
[4:18:22.000 --> 4:18:25.000]  Now, if they're smart, they're going to back off
[4:18:25.000 --> 4:18:28.000]  and they're going to sit down and maybe do the right thing.
[4:18:28.000 --> 4:18:30.000]  What's going to change that is all these people that are listening
[4:18:30.000 --> 4:18:33.000]  saying, I saw what you did and I know who you are.
[4:18:33.000 --> 4:18:35.000]  You're not doing it in a vacuum.
[4:18:35.000 --> 4:18:36.000]  You're not doing it in isolation.
[4:18:36.000 --> 4:18:37.000]  Millions of people know.
[4:18:37.000 --> 4:18:39.000]  Tens of millions of people know.
[4:18:39.000 --> 4:18:40.000]  Here's the thing.
[4:18:40.000 --> 4:18:41.000]  What do you have in your hand?
[4:18:41.000 --> 4:18:42.000]  It's from England.
[4:18:42.000 --> 4:18:44.000]  Not just Americans, no.
[4:18:44.000 --> 4:18:46.000]  All of the thinking world knows.
[4:18:46.000 --> 4:18:48.000]  The enemy is in trouble because of that,
[4:18:48.000 --> 4:18:51.000]  because it's not, first not aligned.
[4:18:51.000 --> 4:18:53.000]  All of this puffing and blustering and black uniforms
[4:18:53.000 --> 4:18:57.000]  and festoon with medals is an attempt to intimidate
[4:18:57.000 --> 4:18:59.000]  like a beaten wife back into submission.
[4:18:59.000 --> 4:19:01.000]  One of the things I have is a pair of scissors
[4:19:01.000 --> 4:19:02.000]  like carrying my combat equipment.
[4:19:02.000 --> 4:19:03.000]  You know what it's for?
[4:19:03.000 --> 4:19:05.000]  I'm looking to try and get at least one of every one
[4:19:05.000 --> 4:19:08.000]  of the three-letter alphabet suit patches off each uniform
[4:19:08.000 --> 4:19:10.000]  with the ones we've shot because it looks really good
[4:19:10.000 --> 4:19:12.000]  on the wall next to the rifles and the hatch you've taken,
[4:19:12.000 --> 4:19:14.000]  especially the ones with the blood stains.
[4:19:14.000 --> 4:19:16.000]  War trophies are a fun thing.
[4:19:16.000 --> 4:19:18.000]  Americans are notorious for that.
[4:19:18.000 --> 4:19:20.000]  That's the attitude everybody has to have,
[4:19:20.000 --> 4:19:22.000]  not this,
[4:19:22.000 --> 4:19:23.000]  no, I'm not.
[4:19:23.000 --> 4:19:24.000]  I know what, look at that.
[4:19:24.000 --> 4:19:25.000]  See that one there?
[4:19:25.000 --> 4:19:26.000]  Do you know what Alex?
[4:19:26.000 --> 4:19:27.000]  I think he's wearing a 10 and a half size boot.
[4:19:27.000 --> 4:19:29.000]  Mine are getting kind of tired.
[4:19:29.000 --> 4:19:31.000]  I'll beat you to him.
[4:19:31.000 --> 4:19:33.000]  A corn key or something else.
[4:19:33.000 --> 4:19:34.000]  That's the attitude everybody's got to have.
[4:19:34.000 --> 4:19:35.000]  And then again, the other side will think
[4:19:35.000 --> 4:19:36.000]  because they're cowards.
[4:19:36.000 --> 4:19:37.000]  They are not brave people.
[4:19:37.000 --> 4:19:41.000]  To beat up on Alex by himself on a road in a dark alley
[4:19:41.000 --> 4:19:43.000]  or anybody that we know,
[4:19:43.000 --> 4:19:46.000]  that's not an act of a man, one-on-one.
[4:19:46.000 --> 4:19:49.000]  That's the act of cowards who of course work in packs.
[4:19:49.000 --> 4:19:52.000]  When they have to deal with free men and women
[4:19:52.000 --> 4:19:55.000]  who stand the line and in the light of day.
[4:19:55.000 --> 4:19:57.000]  Well, I don't want people to know they have
[4:19:57.000 --> 4:19:58.000]  strength and power and the enemy is weak.
[4:19:58.000 --> 4:19:59.000]  That's right.
[4:19:59.000 --> 4:20:00.000]  That's what they do.
[4:20:00.000 --> 4:20:02.000]  And we need to pray for peace, prepare for war,
[4:20:02.000 --> 4:20:04.000]  and we need to prepare to protect our families
[4:20:04.000 --> 4:20:06.000]  because there's no doubt this government
[4:20:06.000 --> 4:20:08.000]  is completely illegitimate and completely criminal.
[4:20:08.000 --> 4:20:10.000]  At least be ready to feed yourself and take care of yourself.
[4:20:10.000 --> 4:20:12.000]  Mark, I have a lot of courage to say the things you say.
[4:20:12.000 --> 4:20:15.000]  I truly have weighed things and I try.
[4:20:15.000 --> 4:20:17.000]  My job is to wake up as many as I can
[4:20:17.000 --> 4:20:20.000]  to energize as many people as I can
[4:20:20.000 --> 4:20:23.000]  just as you have done and been successful at
[4:20:23.000 --> 4:20:26.000]  and to just let people know the nature of their enemies
[4:20:26.000 --> 4:20:28.000]  so they can make the decisions about what they're going to do
[4:20:28.000 --> 4:20:30.000]  and then I can point people at you.
[4:20:30.000 --> 4:20:31.000]  Give folks your website and only have time
[4:20:31.000 --> 4:20:32.000]  to take two or three phone calls.
[4:20:32.000 --> 4:20:33.000]  Okay, real quick here.
[4:20:33.000 --> 4:20:39.000]  Go to www.LibertyTreeRadio.4MG.com.
[4:20:39.000 --> 4:20:45.000]  That's www.LibertyTreeRadio.4MG.com.
[4:20:45.000 --> 4:20:47.000]  And we're also on We The People Radio Network, by the way,
[4:20:47.000 --> 4:20:49.000]  www.TPRN.com.
[4:20:49.000 --> 4:20:51.000]  You'll also find us, if you want to go to YouTube,
[4:20:51.000 --> 4:20:52.000]  have some fun, guys.
[4:20:52.000 --> 4:20:58.000]  Go to YouTube and punch in LibertyTreeRadio.
[4:20:58.000 --> 4:21:00.000]  That's LibertyTreeRadio.
[4:21:00.000 --> 4:21:02.000]  Go to YouTube, punch in LibertyTreeRadio.
[4:21:02.000 --> 4:21:04.000]  You've got some great training videos.
[4:21:04.000 --> 4:21:05.000]  All the videos, both of our music videos.
[4:21:05.000 --> 4:21:06.000]  Take a look.
[4:21:06.000 --> 4:21:07.000]  This will give you a chance to see what troops
[4:21:07.000 --> 4:21:09.000]  are doing all around the country, a lot of the training.
[4:21:09.000 --> 4:21:12.000]  And by the way, you will see our new dog, Bruce.
[4:21:12.000 --> 4:21:15.000]  He was 220 pounds when we got him.
[4:21:15.000 --> 4:21:16.000]  He's a black and white dog.
[4:21:16.000 --> 4:21:18.000]  We had the world two of them together.
[4:21:18.000 --> 4:21:20.000]  One white, one black, and we went schnook.
[4:21:20.000 --> 4:21:21.000]  And now we have this.
[4:21:21.000 --> 4:21:23.000]  No squeezing, only tickle.
[4:21:23.000 --> 4:21:25.000]  All right, listen, I got to give you some calls here.
[4:21:25.000 --> 4:21:27.000]  Eric and Philly, you are on the air.
[4:21:27.000 --> 4:21:28.000]  Go ahead.
[4:21:28.000 --> 4:21:30.000]  Hey, wonderful.
[4:21:30.000 --> 4:21:33.000]  Alex, Mark Kornke.
[4:21:33.000 --> 4:21:36.000]  You were incarcerated for seven years, Mark.
[4:21:36.000 --> 4:21:40.000]  And I believe the main reason you were able to get through that
[4:21:40.000 --> 4:21:44.000]  was because you had the unbelievable support of your wife.
[4:21:44.000 --> 4:21:47.000]  Yes, as a matter of fact, both Nancy and many friends
[4:21:47.000 --> 4:21:49.000]  that we had out there across the country.
[4:21:49.000 --> 4:21:50.000]  And your sons.
[4:21:50.000 --> 4:21:51.000]  Yes.
[4:21:51.000 --> 4:21:54.000]  And all three of the sons of my daughter, too, by the way.
[4:21:54.000 --> 4:21:58.000]  Yeah, because I was actually charged with aggravated assault
[4:21:58.000 --> 4:22:01.000]  because the cops said I hit him with my car.
[4:22:01.000 --> 4:22:04.000]  And I had to do three months, and that was very hard.
[4:22:04.000 --> 4:22:06.000]  But the thing that got me through was my family.
[4:22:06.000 --> 4:22:10.000]  And that's one of their favorite deals is the cops.
[4:22:10.000 --> 4:22:12.000]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[4:22:12.000 --> 4:22:14.000]  It was unbelievable.
[4:22:14.000 --> 4:22:16.000]  I would actually like to send you the info, Mark.
[4:22:16.000 --> 4:22:18.000]  Maybe you could help me out with that.
[4:22:18.000 --> 4:22:20.000]  By the way, you can go to type Mark Kornke on YouTube.
[4:22:20.000 --> 4:22:22.000]  It's one of the hundreds of videos that you can find it quick.
[4:22:22.000 --> 4:22:25.000]  Where you can see the squad car video, back before YouTube,
[4:22:25.000 --> 4:22:28.000]  we aired it on Access TV when they were setting you up.
[4:22:28.000 --> 4:22:29.000]  And it was the cops were chasing you.
[4:22:29.000 --> 4:22:30.000]  They run you off the road and charge you.
[4:22:30.000 --> 4:22:31.000]  Plus also the video.
[4:22:31.000 --> 4:22:32.000]  I mean, I mean, it's incredible.
[4:22:32.000 --> 4:22:35.000]  Also, we have the dispatch tapes that they didn't think we had
[4:22:35.000 --> 4:22:37.000]  because several of the officers recording their own dispatch.
[4:22:37.000 --> 4:22:39.000]  I'll tell the story now, the rest of the way.
[4:22:39.000 --> 4:22:43.000]  We had the police officers who did not, who knew this was wrong,
[4:22:43.000 --> 4:22:44.000]  did not want to be part of it.
[4:22:44.000 --> 4:22:46.000]  What they did is they had recorded everything.
[4:22:46.000 --> 4:22:48.000]  Well, the sheriff's deputy, the first one following you,
[4:22:48.000 --> 4:22:49.000]  he says, why are we following Mark Kornke?
[4:22:49.000 --> 4:22:51.000]  Yeah, we're looking for a bank robber.
[4:22:51.000 --> 4:22:53.000]  What are we following Mark Kornke for?
[4:22:53.000 --> 4:22:55.000]  And immediately they said, go to cell phone.
[4:22:55.000 --> 4:22:56.000]  Go to cell phone.
[4:22:56.000 --> 4:22:58.000]  And they were on what is called the command frequency,
[4:22:58.000 --> 4:23:00.000]  which is isolated from the dispatch frequency.
[4:23:00.000 --> 4:23:01.000]  So command can talk.
[4:23:01.000 --> 4:23:04.000]  And these people ask, why didn't you stop the car?
[4:23:04.000 --> 4:23:06.000]  I had two of my sons with me.
[4:23:06.000 --> 4:23:07.000]  I got them out of the cars.
[4:23:07.000 --> 4:23:09.000]  What I did because it was obvious at a given point,
[4:23:09.000 --> 4:23:11.000]  it became very obvious that they were going to try.
[4:23:11.000 --> 4:23:13.000]  In fact, it was said later in the courtroom.
[4:23:13.000 --> 4:23:15.000]  You noticed that morning you were being followed and things.
[4:23:15.000 --> 4:23:16.000]  You didn't know what they were planning with your sons.
[4:23:16.000 --> 4:23:17.000]  Right.
[4:23:17.000 --> 4:23:18.000]  There was something else going on.
[4:23:18.000 --> 4:23:21.000]  The whole thing in a nutshell is the incident itself was orchestrated
[4:23:21.000 --> 4:23:22.000]  from beginning to end.
[4:23:22.000 --> 4:23:26.000]  One of the things that came on the 911 tape is the call from the bank.
[4:23:26.000 --> 4:23:27.000]  Hello, 911.
[4:23:27.000 --> 4:23:29.000]  Yes, we've just been robbed.
[4:23:29.000 --> 4:23:31.000]  Is he right there?
[4:23:31.000 --> 4:23:32.000]  No, he isn't.
[4:23:32.000 --> 4:23:33.000]  Well, where is he?
[4:23:33.000 --> 4:23:36.000]  Well, he just walked out of the front door of the bank
[4:23:36.000 --> 4:23:39.000]  across the street and over to the sheriff's department.
[4:23:39.000 --> 4:23:41.000]  And she goes, what?
[4:23:41.000 --> 4:23:42.000]  Would you repeat that?
[4:23:42.000 --> 4:23:44.000]  Well, we're right here standing in the bank window
[4:23:44.000 --> 4:23:47.000]  and he went right out the front door and across the street
[4:23:47.000 --> 4:23:50.000]  and over to the sheriff's department.
[4:23:50.000 --> 4:23:52.000]  And it goes dead quiet on the other end.
[4:23:52.000 --> 4:23:55.000]  Now he then walked across the street, goes to the Dairy Queen,
[4:23:55.000 --> 4:23:57.000]  which is only from the distance here to that store across the street
[4:23:57.000 --> 4:23:59.000]  from your office here,
[4:23:59.000 --> 4:24:03.000]  and meets with the duty sergeant for the sheriff's department.
[4:24:03.000 --> 4:24:05.000]  And then suddenly everybody's after Mark Kornke.
[4:24:05.000 --> 4:24:09.000]  And this is the actual bank robber who absconded with,
[4:24:09.000 --> 4:24:10.000]  went into the bank and...
[4:24:10.000 --> 4:24:12.000]  And this guy, by the way, looks nothing like you.
[4:24:12.000 --> 4:24:13.000]  Nothing like me.
[4:24:13.000 --> 4:24:14.000]  Isn't he tall and gray hair?
[4:24:14.000 --> 4:24:17.000]  No, lean and very thin.
[4:24:17.000 --> 4:24:19.000]  Lean and very thin.
[4:24:19.000 --> 4:24:21.000]  I mean, lean, very thin, very thin face.
[4:24:21.000 --> 4:24:23.000]  In fact, they had him on camera.
[4:24:23.000 --> 4:24:24.000]  They knew because they had the cameras.
[4:24:24.000 --> 4:24:26.000]  The bank is all camera'd up.
[4:24:26.000 --> 4:24:28.000]  They had the feeds right there even as they were...
[4:24:28.000 --> 4:24:29.000]  The sheriff's department is on tape.
[4:24:29.000 --> 4:24:30.000]  Why are we following Mark Kornke?
[4:24:30.000 --> 4:24:31.000]  Exactly.
[4:24:31.000 --> 4:24:32.000]  And the other thing about...
[4:24:32.000 --> 4:24:34.000]  But then other cops show up and run you off the road.
[4:24:34.000 --> 4:24:35.000]  Right.
[4:24:35.000 --> 4:24:37.000]  Real quick here, if you'd like to send something to me,
[4:24:37.000 --> 4:24:43.000]  PBN, P.O. Box 194, Dexter, Michigan, 4-8-1-3-0.
[4:24:43.000 --> 4:24:45.000]  That way if you need to send any packets or anything,
[4:24:45.000 --> 4:24:49.000]  PBN, P.O. Box 194, Dexter, Michigan, 4-8-1-3-0.
[4:24:49.000 --> 4:24:50.000]  All right.
[4:24:50.000 --> 4:24:51.000]  You've got to take it.
[4:24:51.000 --> 4:24:52.000]  Yeah.
[4:24:52.000 --> 4:24:53.000]  We'll call it a minute.
[4:24:53.000 --> 4:24:54.000]  Jay and Florida, quickly go ahead.
[4:24:54.000 --> 4:24:55.000]  Hey, Alex.
[4:24:55.000 --> 4:24:56.000]  Hey, Mark.
[4:24:56.000 --> 4:24:57.000]  How you guys doing?
[4:24:57.000 --> 4:24:58.000]  Yeah.
[4:24:58.000 --> 4:24:59.000]  Okay.
[4:24:59.000 --> 4:25:01.000]  My question is, I'm sure I know that I'm a Ron Paul supporter.
[4:25:01.000 --> 4:25:03.000]  I know Alex is, and maybe you are too.
[4:25:03.000 --> 4:25:04.000]  Of course.
[4:25:04.000 --> 4:25:08.000]  But since Ron's now out, we have one other alternative,
[4:25:08.000 --> 4:25:11.000]  which is the Green Party and since McKinney.
[4:25:11.000 --> 4:25:13.000]  She stands for truth and the 9-11 truth.
[4:25:13.000 --> 4:25:15.000]  I was just wondering if you guys could take a brief moment to...
[4:25:15.000 --> 4:25:17.000]  I like Cynthia McKinney.
[4:25:17.000 --> 4:25:19.000]  I like Cynthia McKinney, but she's anti-gun,
[4:25:19.000 --> 4:25:20.000]  so I'm not going to be voting for her.
[4:25:20.000 --> 4:25:23.000]  I think she's a well-meaning lady, but she's mainline liberal.
[4:25:23.000 --> 4:25:24.000]  We are going...
[4:25:24.000 --> 4:25:26.000]  We have been supporting the Constitution Party.
[4:25:26.000 --> 4:25:27.000]  Right.
[4:25:27.000 --> 4:25:30.000]  And they're candidates, and you've heard him here.
[4:25:30.000 --> 4:25:31.000]  Okay, fantastic.
[4:25:31.000 --> 4:25:32.000]  Let's move on.
[4:25:32.000 --> 4:25:33.000]  Thanks, guys.
[4:25:33.000 --> 4:25:34.000]  Thank you.
[4:25:34.000 --> 4:25:35.000]  Let's talk to Mike in Ohio.
[4:25:35.000 --> 4:25:36.000]  You're on the air.
[4:25:36.000 --> 4:25:37.000]  Go ahead, Mike.
[4:25:37.000 --> 4:25:38.000]  Hi, Alex.
[4:25:38.000 --> 4:25:39.000]  Mark.
[4:25:39.000 --> 4:25:40.000]  Hey.
[4:25:40.000 --> 4:25:46.000]  Mark, I just want to let you know I've got your old tapes that you put out,
[4:25:46.000 --> 4:25:51.000]  and I was saying that my father told me a long time ago,
[4:25:51.000 --> 4:25:55.000]  like back in the 70s, he asked me,
[4:25:55.000 --> 4:25:57.000]  you know, do you believe everything the government tells you?
[4:25:57.000 --> 4:26:02.000]  And I just, you know, said, oh, 75% bull.
[4:26:02.000 --> 4:26:05.000]  And that's when he told me, he goes, you know, son,
[4:26:05.000 --> 4:26:10.000]  that you always going to have to fight for your freedom.
[4:26:10.000 --> 4:26:14.000]  And then that's when he told me that one day you might have to.
[4:26:14.000 --> 4:26:17.000]  So I think you're right that people should be getting ready
[4:26:17.000 --> 4:26:19.000]  because they've been at this a long time.
[4:26:19.000 --> 4:26:22.000]  I mean, when they're openly recording the kids to be sacred police,
[4:26:22.000 --> 4:26:25.000]  I mean, and they won't be just watching their parents.
[4:26:25.000 --> 4:26:26.000]  See, here's the thing.
[4:26:26.000 --> 4:26:28.000]  Just like they try to depict in that remake, there's a color version.
[4:26:28.000 --> 4:26:29.000]  There's black and white.
[4:26:29.000 --> 4:26:33.000]  And by the way, there's a BBC version of 1984.
[4:26:33.000 --> 4:26:35.000]  If you get a chance, watch the BBC version.
[4:26:35.000 --> 4:26:37.000]  Yeah, that's the best for the kids, the spies.
[4:26:37.000 --> 4:26:38.000]  Yeah.
[4:26:38.000 --> 4:26:39.000]  And they're right there.
[4:26:39.000 --> 4:26:40.000]  They're right there.
[4:26:40.000 --> 4:26:41.000]  He's working on the sync.
[4:26:41.000 --> 4:26:42.000]  They're right there.
[4:26:42.000 --> 4:26:43.000]  He's whatever they're doing.
[4:26:43.000 --> 4:26:44.000]  They're right around the corner.
[4:26:44.000 --> 4:26:45.000]  They're listening from around the corner.
[4:26:45.000 --> 4:26:51.000]  You don't need cameras everywhere if you have organic cameras walking everywhere.
[4:26:51.000 --> 4:26:52.000]  Think about it.
[4:26:52.000 --> 4:26:54.000]  And it's the state taking the children away,
[4:26:54.000 --> 4:26:56.000]  and it turns the order of the universe completely on its head.
[4:26:56.000 --> 4:26:57.000]  Gotta jump, Mike.
[4:26:57.000 --> 4:26:58.000]  Thanks, Jeff and Michigan.
[4:26:58.000 --> 4:26:59.000]  Last transmission.
[4:26:59.000 --> 4:27:00.000]  Thank you.
[4:27:00.000 --> 4:27:01.000]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[4:27:01.000 --> 4:27:02.000]  Hi, Alex and Mark.
[4:27:02.000 --> 4:27:05.000]  Glad that I got through, and I want to say thank you, Alex,
[4:27:05.000 --> 4:27:07.000]  for your efforts and your enlightenment.
[4:27:07.000 --> 4:27:10.000]  We try to bring you the best people as possible on the show.
[4:27:10.000 --> 4:27:11.000]  Good deal.
[4:27:11.000 --> 4:27:16.000]  And to Mark, I'd like to say that a familiar name I hadn't heard in a while,
[4:27:16.000 --> 4:27:21.000]  I worked for the city in which you did for 18 or 19 years,
[4:27:21.000 --> 4:27:26.000]  and we followed the things that were happening to you.
[4:27:26.000 --> 4:27:34.000]  And I consequently had become a whistleblower for the place in which I worked
[4:27:34.000 --> 4:27:40.000]  and took on the government and accused them of fraud and corruption
[4:27:40.000 --> 4:27:44.000]  and other things publicly in front of council being on tape.
[4:27:44.000 --> 4:27:49.000]  And I'm sorry to say they got me because I'm not as tough as you guys are,
[4:27:49.000 --> 4:27:53.000]  but they rode me out and gave me a medical disability
[4:27:53.000 --> 4:27:56.000]  and are now voting to take it away and leave me high and dry.
[4:27:56.000 --> 4:28:02.000]  So I just want to applaud you guys who continue to fight despite the...
[4:28:02.000 --> 4:28:03.000]  Well, we need you.
[4:28:03.000 --> 4:28:07.000]  We can't let them kill 70, 80 million of us, and I appreciate your call.
[4:28:07.000 --> 4:28:10.000]  We need you, all of you, at least in the Info War, copies of films,
[4:28:10.000 --> 4:28:12.000]  telling people about the radio show, other radio shows.
[4:28:12.000 --> 4:28:15.000]  This is how it all happens. Mark Kornke, we are out of time.
[4:28:15.000 --> 4:28:18.000]  This was a real pleasure getting to meet you in person after all these years.
[4:28:18.000 --> 4:28:19.000]  Thank you, I like to appreciate it.
[4:28:19.000 --> 4:28:23.000]  And just go ahead and take us out of here, my friends in there.
[4:28:23.000 --> 4:28:31.000]  We just really appreciate you coming on the show and spending time with us.
[4:28:31.000 --> 4:28:32.000]  And I wish we had more time.
[4:28:32.000 --> 4:28:34.000]  I've got stuff stacked to the rafters.
[4:28:34.000 --> 4:28:36.000]  I appreciate you spending time with us, Mark.
[4:28:36.000 --> 4:28:37.000]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[4:28:37.000 --> 4:28:41.000]  And by the way, remember your training and you will come back alive.
[4:28:41.000 --> 4:28:44.000]  God, sometimes I think of the...
[4:28:44.000 --> 4:28:48.000]  I'm so focused fighting these people, I don't even think about it much.
[4:28:48.000 --> 4:28:51.000]  I'm trying to do everything I can to set bushfires in the minds of men.
[4:28:51.000 --> 4:28:54.000]  Excellent. We're going to continue to do so, and we'll help you in any way we can.
[4:28:54.000 --> 4:28:59.000]  All it takes is an irate, focused minority to bring down tyranny, and we are going to do it.
[4:28:59.000 --> 4:29:01.000]  Mark Kornke, again, great having you here.
[4:29:01.000 --> 4:29:02.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[4:29:02.000 --> 4:29:05.000]  Man, a lot is happening. The quickening is upon us.
