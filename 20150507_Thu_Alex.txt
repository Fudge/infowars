[00:00.000 --> 00:10.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:10.280 --> 00:18.760]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:18.760 --> 00:24.240]  jones welcome my friends welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this
[00:24.240 --> 00:34.920]  live worldwide Thursday the seventh day of May 2015 global transmission if you
[00:34.920 --> 00:39.880]  just tuned in you're watching us on television you'll notice that the lights
[00:39.880 --> 00:45.200]  are basically off here in the studio and I got into the studio about I don't
[00:45.200 --> 00:49.680]  know an hour ago or so and sat down here with the lights off and I kind of like
[00:49.680 --> 00:56.560]  the way it looks and then I was thinking what's an allegory for what's
[00:56.560 --> 01:01.520]  happening in our world because here I am in the shadows kind of like the
[01:01.520 --> 01:07.880]  globalist program for corporate world government has been in the shadows but as
[01:07.880 --> 01:12.600]  more and more people understand the globalist system the philosophy the
[01:12.600 --> 01:17.080]  program what makes them tick what they're building what they believe in and as
[01:17.080 --> 01:24.040]  more of us investigate it sheds more and more light like slowly turning up the
[01:24.040 --> 01:28.960]  lights in a room now we could slowly fade up the lights but historically
[01:28.960 --> 01:36.360]  sometimes in fact a lot of the time the light slowly barely fades up and then all
[01:36.360 --> 01:42.880]  the sudden explosively the lights come on and the roaches try to scatter and
[01:42.880 --> 01:48.480]  that's the point we've reached I've had George Stephanopoulos's office call me
[01:48.480 --> 01:57.040]  to supposedly go on this week on ABC they want to fly me out there but in my
[01:57.040 --> 02:00.040]  experience with mainstream media they fly you somewhere as a joke to make you
[02:00.040 --> 02:04.400]  sit there ABC hasn't done that not with Nightline not with the view and other
[02:04.400 --> 02:09.040]  shows I've been on but CNN and Fox I just will not do it I don't know I'm gonna
[02:09.040 --> 02:12.200]  fly out to DC to be in the room with Stephanopoulos I'm seeing about trying to
[02:12.200 --> 02:20.000]  do it via the satellite or via fiber as they do most of it now I'm not gonna do
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.320]  it tape so they could edit it all up like CNN did that we have that clip
[02:24.320 --> 02:27.440]  coming up we played part of it with David Dewhurst yesterday dealing with the
[02:27.440 --> 02:31.760]  military drills and Jade Helm and the huge firestorm and political awakening
[02:31.760 --> 02:36.680]  to that that's now taking place but we didn't get to the part where they
[02:36.680 --> 02:42.120]  intro the piece and edit me down to like three seconds saying looks like an invasion
[02:42.120 --> 02:46.640]  when I never said there's an imminent real invasion happening this summer and
[02:46.640 --> 02:50.920]  I know I kept you know hammering on that it's just this is how they deceive
[02:50.920 --> 02:54.880]  their audience there is an amazing article on info wars.com that we
[02:54.880 --> 02:58.320]  republished in full for the New American magazine we normally just publish
[02:58.320 --> 03:02.520]  snippets and linked to them by Alex Newman who really breaks down the
[03:02.520 --> 03:08.200]  mainstream media deception on Jade Helm and it's the best article out there
[03:08.200 --> 03:12.200]  Barnon established but pressed his credits itself with Jade Helm deceit
[03:12.200 --> 03:16.760]  and I just want to commend Alex Newman for his scholarly research because he
[03:16.760 --> 03:23.800]  just goes over their lies blow-by-blow he mentions a NPR piece that I happened to
[03:23.800 --> 03:30.720]  read a transcript of and mentioned on air I think on Monday that was so
[03:30.720 --> 03:34.960]  cartoonish it's like Alex Jones believes they're killing people at Walmart and
[03:34.960 --> 03:39.280]  and and and and he also believes in this crazy thing and just all this stuff I
[03:39.280 --> 03:44.400]  never said and never even mentioning Jade Helm itself I mean it's getting
[03:44.400 --> 03:49.480]  crazy where they just go tinfoil tinfoil tinfoil everybody knows we've got
[03:49.480 --> 03:53.720]  illegal acid formative seizure going on and illegal that's they spying of course
[03:53.720 --> 03:56.920]  back when I talked about 20 years ago everybody didn't know I'm not bragging I'm
[03:56.920 --> 04:03.560]  just saying how many times we have to be right over and over again and now they're
[04:03.560 --> 04:09.080]  just involved in desperate damage control everybody knows who's half awake
[04:09.080 --> 04:13.280]  that there's militarization of police that there's a federalization a
[04:13.280 --> 04:17.600]  globalization of police no one is saying the military individually are bad
[04:17.600 --> 04:21.960]  though the media keeps saying we've said that it's the military that doesn't
[04:21.960 --> 04:27.760]  want this civilian inmate labor camp civil unrest mass roundup gun
[04:27.760 --> 04:33.480]  confiscation plan and it's in hundreds of documents that we source and video of
[04:33.480 --> 04:38.520]  it happening not just in Katrina but areas of California you name it knock
[04:38.520 --> 04:43.440]  and talk I mean people know they're being lied to our folks overreacting to
[04:43.440 --> 04:51.440]  Jade Helm no not really because it's just a flashpoint it's a spark it's a
[04:51.440 --> 04:59.360]  wake-up point Fox News calls it a firestorm and it is a firestorm Texas
[04:59.360 --> 05:03.680]  rep Louie Gohmert is joining a long list of congressmen who are actually doing
[05:03.680 --> 05:08.000]  their job and addressing the concerns of their citizens Gohmert says he
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.400]  understands the concerns Texans have about the upcoming Jade Helm exercise
[05:12.400 --> 05:16.920]  the congressman took particular issue with the maps labeling of Republican
[05:16.920 --> 05:22.520]  majority states as hostile Gohmert called on the Pentagon to change the map the
[05:22.520 --> 05:26.960]  names on the map and said the tone of the exercise needs to be completely
[05:26.960 --> 05:31.960]  revamped so the federal government is not intentionally practicing war against

[08:26.880 --> 08:30.200]  your host Alex Jones we're going to be here Lord willing for the next three
[08:30.200 --> 08:35.280]  hours live thank you so much for joining us the globalist the private
[08:35.280 --> 08:38.240]  corporate interest that control the issuance of currency and credit through
[08:38.240 --> 08:42.480]  private central banks like our Federal Reserve want to keep things in the dark
[08:42.480 --> 08:49.000]  well info wars is here bringing light to the situation and as the light begins
[08:49.000 --> 08:55.160]  to incrementally get turned up the roaches are starting to scatter and
[08:55.160 --> 09:01.880]  their monopoly of media is imploding again thank you so much for joining us
[09:01.880 --> 09:12.460]  today where to begin Jade Helm is being called by Fox News ABC News the
[09:12.460 --> 09:20.960]  New York Times and others a firestorm an explosive political battle it is now
[09:20.960 --> 09:28.120]  probably the top story in the country and it's a huge victory for liberty
[09:28.120 --> 09:31.960]  because even though the mainstream media the the the the the globalist
[09:31.960 --> 09:39.880]  sympathizer media has framed all this in fraud and made it all about an imminent
[09:39.880 --> 09:43.840]  takeover and martial law this summer when we've talked about it being
[09:43.840 --> 09:49.380]  conditioning for incremental globalization and federalization and the
[09:49.380 --> 09:53.560]  military's own legions of documents and training manuals admitting it's for the
[09:53.560 --> 09:59.680]  American people for future paramilitary civil unrest gun confiscation I mean
[09:59.680 --> 10:06.520]  that's in the Washington Times Forbes AP Reuters the Army War College we've made
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.320]  countless videos about it showing anybody can search those terms how the
[10:11.320 --> 10:15.520]  Pentagon would crush a tea party rebellion you'll get the headlines and
[10:15.520 --> 10:22.840]  then you'll get the actual Army manuals that's why the military is so awake now
[10:22.840 --> 10:27.960]  because they're there the non-commissioned officers and up are being given
[10:27.960 --> 10:38.000]  treasonous training it was in the news two weeks ago again Army and armed
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.680]  services wide but the leak was out of the Army wasn't even a leak it was just
[10:43.680 --> 10:47.800]  public but the folks in the military are the ones that leaked it onto the web and
[10:47.800 --> 10:52.080]  said look what we're being taught where they said the founding fathers were bad
[10:52.080 --> 10:57.920]  and that free markets bad and racist and sexist and the founders are evil
[10:57.920 --> 11:03.120]  a federal judge ruled a month ago that you can't wear an American flag if people
[11:03.120 --> 11:07.840]  think it's offensive this is twilight zone behavior they're blaming the
[11:07.840 --> 11:13.800]  victims of the terrorist attack in garland in the media for their speech
[11:13.800 --> 11:18.080]  eliciting these folks and then some of the Twitter accounts criticizing the
[11:18.080 --> 11:25.480]  dead terrorist are getting censored for being insensitive and then on Fox News
[11:25.480 --> 11:29.160]  they've got an email on saying that basically the people that put on this
[11:29.160 --> 11:33.880]  show deserve to be killed and Sean Hannity says well you know we don't
[11:33.880 --> 11:37.400]  follow your laws here if I just get that clip ready you know we've got the
[11:37.400 --> 11:42.840]  Constitution he says not for long and I'm not in some class of civilizations is
[11:42.840 --> 11:47.280]  lomaphobic hatred of Muslims period everybody knows I'm against destabilizing
[11:47.280 --> 11:51.440]  the Middle East what happened in Iraq aiding al-Qaeda destabilized Syria
[11:51.440 --> 11:55.280]  overthrowing Egypt I want prosperity and freedom for the Middle East and there
[11:55.280 --> 12:01.120]  are a lot of moderate Muslims and good people but our government our media
[12:01.120 --> 12:06.120]  allows and the same thing in England radicals to operate in fact here's the
[12:06.120 --> 12:11.320]  shock video radical Imam tells Pamela Geller on live TV she should be killed
[12:11.320 --> 12:20.600]  here's that clip and then we'll continue on with one her to die you know what she
[12:20.600 --> 12:27.880]  should be put before sure a court and tried she's not a Muslim and Jim she's
[12:27.880 --> 12:32.440]  not a mother she doesn't believe what you believe before you know freedom and freedom
[12:32.440 --> 12:36.760]  freedom of speech you want to work for fear van Gogh and Saman Rushdie and
[12:36.760 --> 12:40.480]  her say Ali you cannot continue to go down this road and I spent the Muslims
[12:40.480 --> 12:44.640]  to stand back you know I would retaliate if someone insulted my own mother let
[12:44.640 --> 12:48.600]  alone the Prophet who I adhere and you know I love a hundred times
[12:48.600 --> 12:55.360]  you know if you don't know if somebody says something about your
[12:55.360 --> 13:01.160]  Prophet that you don't like you want them dead any Prophet and see how this is
[13:01.160 --> 13:07.720]  gonna work with political correctness is you can't have speech if it inflames
[13:07.720 --> 13:13.560]  this extremist and by the way the Wahhabist are running around blowing up
[13:13.560 --> 13:20.120]  every Christian shrine they can find the shrine of Jonah the shrine of Christ
[13:20.120 --> 13:26.840]  it's just pure bull and it's like gang culture the worst radical Muslims with
[13:26.840 --> 13:32.520]  Saudi Arabian funding bully everyone else into following their sick brand of
[13:32.520 --> 13:38.040]  cultic oppression and I'm against the Talbotarianism I don't care where it
[13:38.040 --> 13:46.240]  comes from communist Nazi radical jihadi I'm sick of it and I'm sick of the
[13:46.240 --> 13:56.040]  left's bizarre alliance with radical Islam we're gonna get into that and ISIS
[13:56.040 --> 13:59.920]  claims that has seven D1 trained soldiers in 15 different states ready to
[13:59.920 --> 14:04.680]  attack that's on info wars.com ISIS targeting states with strict gun
[14:04.680 --> 14:10.720]  control laws info wars.com we're gonna break that down ISIS says more attacks
[14:10.720 --> 14:16.400]  imminent in US says the two killed in Dallas by an afternoon police officer
[14:16.400 --> 14:21.880]  where their soldiers Obama set to begin training jihadists in Syria actual ISIS
[14:21.880 --> 14:26.600]  are being trained now in Syria as we predict they would do to launch phase
[14:26.600 --> 14:32.640]  two with them now resupplied out of Iraq with US weapons and all this had to be
[14:32.640 --> 14:35.240]  done because the military caught on what was happening two years ago and said
[14:35.240 --> 14:39.640]  no so now they just let them resupply by invading Iraq and having our military
[14:39.640 --> 14:47.520]  stand down can't make that up ISIS opens a 262 room luxury hotel in Mosul and
[14:47.520 --> 14:52.960]  Iraq's second largest city and of course no one's gonna bomb it because it's a
[14:52.960 --> 14:56.600]  shadow army Huckabee slams Obama for stripping grandmothers while known
[14:56.600 --> 15:01.880]  terrorist tweet they're going to attack he calls for scrapping the TSA actually
[15:01.880 --> 15:06.760]  like that that makes sense what Huckabee saying the New York Times loves
[15:06.760 --> 15:12.600]  blasphemy except when it targets Muslims now I want to be clear about this I'm
[15:12.600 --> 15:17.840]  the guy that is most credited with exposing the fact that 9-11 as we were
[15:17.840 --> 15:22.920]  told it happened was a fable and that our government basically stood down bare
[15:22.920 --> 15:28.160]  minimum and that most of the Al Qaeda force was Western intelligence cutouts
[15:28.160 --> 15:31.640]  corporate cutouts as a pretext to invade countries that were innocent like
[15:31.640 --> 15:35.520]  Iraq and take control of opium in Afghanistan that's all been born out
[15:35.520 --> 15:41.600]  and proven accurate I get a lot of criticism from people explain to me what
[15:41.600 --> 15:45.280]  false flags are and what provocateurs are and things like that that's like
[15:45.280 --> 15:49.600]  explain to Babe Ruth how to hit a home run okay fine or it's like telling me
[15:49.600 --> 15:53.440]  the federal reserve's private ID I didn't know that or you know that Barack
[15:53.440 --> 15:58.840]  Obama's a big fat liar and so Hillary I mean the ISIS is a completely different
[15:58.840 --> 16:04.060]  operation Hitler wasn't under the control of some of the
[16:04.060 --> 16:09.840]  robber barons in England in the United States he was funded and wound up and
[16:09.840 --> 16:13.360]  had peace treaties with England that have been declassified and was told he
[16:13.360 --> 16:16.240]  was going to be allowed to invade Europe and take over and then later that he
[16:16.240 --> 16:21.440]  would link up with the US in England that's why I allowed the British to
[16:21.440 --> 16:28.940]  evacuate France when he first invaded France this is all mainline history you
[16:28.940 --> 16:35.240]  gotta dig a little deeper but it's there it's the same thing here ISIS is the
[16:35.240 --> 16:40.280]  Syrian Free Syrian Army funded for five years six billion dollars at least we
[16:40.280 --> 16:44.360]  know about from Congress they are Wahhabis they are Saudi Arabia funded
[16:44.360 --> 16:48.600]  they're recruiting all over the world the West allows them to fly in and out of
[16:48.600 --> 16:54.680]  our countries and then they march around with it with people at Mayday
[16:54.680 --> 17:00.600]  Parade in Austin and other areas I see the ISIS signs I see it online I
[17:00.600 --> 17:07.800]  recognize genuine grassroots recruiting versus projections and fake garbage so
[17:07.800 --> 17:12.480]  this is two different animals does that mean that some agency or group in an
[17:12.480 --> 17:16.520]  agency rogue group might not stage terror attacks and women on ISIS does that
[17:16.520 --> 17:21.800]  mean that there aren't ISIS leaders being basically run by Western globalist
[17:21.800 --> 17:28.320]  organizations no that's come out but the grassroots and their camp followers and
[17:28.320 --> 17:39.920]  their bots as Colonel Schaefer called them are real they're real and the
[17:39.920 --> 17:45.920]  border is wide open and so undoubtedly there are going to be some attacks and
[17:45.920 --> 17:50.440]  they've been picking up thousands a month of other than Mexicans is what
[17:50.440 --> 17:54.920]  it's called in the sheets the forms fell out by the border patrol at one border
[17:54.920 --> 18:00.120]  air sector in Texas alone I mean look it up we've done whole stories on it so
[18:00.120 --> 18:03.880]  there are people pouring across like the guy who's allowed to broadcast in
[18:03.880 --> 18:07.080]  England and call for people's death and the government leaves him on air because
[18:07.080 --> 18:11.240]  you know Michael Savage can't go to England but e-moms can get on TV and
[18:11.240 --> 18:16.000]  call for killing people basically because this is how they're bringing in
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.600]  political correctness saying oh all these minority groups can say whatever
[18:19.600 --> 18:26.160]  they want you just can't and so if people like this are out there preaching at
[18:26.160 --> 18:29.640]  Madras is all over the Western world and then they can come into the United
[18:29.640 --> 18:39.920]  States you better believe that we're going to see things like this unfold
[18:39.920 --> 18:43.720]  there's our report from last year with John bound he legals from all over the
[18:43.720 --> 18:48.840]  world crossing the border and bound was out there talking to retired board
[18:48.840 --> 18:55.080]  patrol agents and ranchers and others about the situation so what we're
[18:55.080 --> 19:00.480]  pointing out is this whole war on terror is a hoax it is a fraud we had a 15 year
[19:00.480 --> 19:04.720]  war that cost trillions of dollars and now we're told that the al-qaeda slash
[19:04.720 --> 19:09.040]  ISIS threat is ten times bigger than it ever was and prepare for imminent attack
[19:09.040 --> 19:14.640]  now I'm not going to get into that more until later I I want to come back and
[19:14.640 --> 19:20.520]  give you the good news on Jane Helm this is a firestorm of awakening and no
[19:20.520 --> 19:24.280]  matter how they misphrase things and put words in our mouths that we hate the
[19:24.280 --> 19:28.720]  military or that we say Obama's gonna you know occupy the state house and all
[19:28.720 --> 19:32.920]  the rest of it this is part of an incremental globalization through the
[19:32.920 --> 19:36.840]  federal government and that's why we said it should be looked at because in
[19:36.840 --> 19:41.200]  many other military training drills they prepare we have the video of the
[19:41.200 --> 19:44.400]  training drills and the police admitting working with them that they're
[19:44.400 --> 19:49.080]  preparing for war with veterans gun owners Christians and that's what this is
[19:49.080 --> 19:52.960]  all about and the fact that people are so upset shows they've reached their
[19:52.960 --> 19:56.840]  political breaking point and they don't have any faith in the corrupt people
[19:56.840 --> 20:00.360]  that have hijacked the government as if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough
[20:00.360 --> 20:04.840]  now they're adding ammonia it's true some municipalities are now adding

[24:52.760 --> 24:56.600]  not stakeholders to quote David Knight yesterday quoting what they have to say
[24:56.600 --> 25:01.040]  sorry Congress you can't see it not a stakeholder you're just the elected
[25:01.040 --> 25:05.600]  representatives of the people oh everything's fine nothing's going on
[25:05.600 --> 25:12.080]  nothing's wrong you know what the good news is before I get into Jade Helm and
[25:12.080 --> 25:17.240]  epic information NSA phoned out a collection illegal appeals court rules
[25:17.240 --> 25:23.600]  the New York Times and I love these two shooters up in Garland I love how they
[25:23.600 --> 25:28.960]  tweeted six hours before they were gonna go kill people and talked about this
[25:28.960 --> 25:34.680]  event and other tweets any moron could the FBI was watching them and had
[25:34.680 --> 25:46.960]  arrested them but were ordered to release them just like 9-11 and the NSA
[25:46.960 --> 25:53.720]  didn't protect us did it no a off-duty cop who knew there was a SWAT team inside
[25:53.720 --> 25:57.280]  guarding the people was supportive of the First Amendment was a smart guy and
[25:57.280 --> 26:01.560]  thought gee they keep attacking these almost every time they have one in
[26:01.560 --> 26:09.040]  Europe maybe I should go stake it out he didn't go hunting white-tailed deer he
[26:09.040 --> 26:15.840]  went and was hunting prison scum and my most everybody in prison scum a lot of
[26:15.840 --> 26:23.560]  people are innocent or in there for but I mean these guys are worse come we're
[26:23.560 --> 26:27.240]  gonna get into that NSA situation though but I thought the NSA wasn't spying with
[26:27.240 --> 26:31.560]  keywords yesterday I saw a time magazine article explaining how they record
[26:31.560 --> 26:35.200]  everything and then use keywords oh my gosh that's only been known for like 30
[26:35.200 --> 26:42.720]  years since James Bamford the producer of Nightline exposed it I used to go on
[26:42.720 --> 26:46.960]  the radio and play clips of Nightline episodes like 25 30 years ago and people
[26:46.960 --> 26:51.240]  thought they were fake when go there's no NSA it doesn't even exist it's this
[26:51.240 --> 26:57.960]  culture of total denial I tell you what's exciting people now don't deny
[26:57.960 --> 27:01.640]  this stuff mainstream media tries to deny it dying dinosaur media tries to
[27:01.640 --> 27:07.240]  but Chut Norris has come out with a very powerful article yesterday in World
[27:07.240 --> 27:14.480]  Net Daily and he's Mr. Military military just loves Chuck Norris
[27:14.480 --> 27:19.160]  fact I'm not bragging it's just true fact it's a great responsibility it
[27:19.160 --> 27:24.080]  makes me feel incredibly humble empathetic that we are the number one show
[27:24.080 --> 27:28.040]  now by every metric listened to by the US Armed Services because they know I
[27:28.040 --> 27:31.760]  know what I'm talking about they want to be decompartmentalized I was talking to
[27:31.760 --> 27:35.760]  a media analyst last night he said Alex you know not just for the military but
[27:35.760 --> 27:41.640]  for the establishment itself your show is like porn to them they're sick of
[27:41.640 --> 27:45.160]  watching all the lies and twisting and mainstream media even when people in the
[27:45.160 --> 27:50.360]  system are for something they love to hear about it from your perspective so
[27:50.360 --> 27:53.880]  it's not that I'm even that special it's just that nobody else will just tell it
[27:53.880 --> 27:59.760]  like it is and it's not my perspective I've been reading what the globalists
[27:59.760 --> 28:03.400]  have to say forever I've been watching their program progress I've watched them
[28:03.400 --> 28:08.600]  do it faster and slower and in different ways in other countries I'm obsessed
[28:08.600 --> 28:15.920]  with it and I didn't have to steal their playbooks like the New England Patriots
[28:15.920 --> 28:19.760]  are known to do their playbooks are public because they have disdain and
[28:19.760 --> 28:26.640]  arrogance for the people so you can differ with me on my interpretations of
[28:26.640 --> 28:30.360]  things but you can't differ with me that the Pentagon says their main mission is
[28:30.360 --> 28:36.320]  gun owners and veterans I mean that is so legendarily evil and such a giant red
[28:36.320 --> 28:41.080]  flag that it should have everyone completely freaking out and the good
[28:41.080 --> 28:44.520]  news is we finally are getting out of the trance we're finally getting upset
[28:44.520 --> 28:47.400]  doesn't mean people know everything about Jade Helm doesn't mean it's a
[28:47.400 --> 28:53.720]  takeover probably not 98% it's part of an incremental takeover and is the
[28:53.720 --> 28:58.400]  public overreacting in some ways yeah but they've been underreacting to all
[28:58.400 --> 29:03.080]  the incredible off-the-chart gun confiscation in Katrina an asset for
[29:03.080 --> 29:08.200]  officer seizure and executive open borders and a hundred other insane
[29:08.200 --> 29:14.680]  things Google watching people with their cameras and Samsung saying we're
[29:14.680 --> 29:22.760]  listening to you over the TV I mean this is all cuckoo level so if people are
[29:22.760 --> 29:26.840]  now freaking out and the media is trying to spin it like oh we're nuts no
[29:26.840 --> 29:31.640]  we're finally acting like normal humans when we come back incredible quotes from
[29:31.640 --> 29:36.960]  Chuck Norris amazing quotes from Texas Louie Gomer congressman I'm really
[29:36.960 --> 29:41.520]  proud of Texas Texans don't want to be slaves we've got a lot of faults but at
[29:41.520 --> 29:45.400]  the end of the day we're free people and we will never submit to the globalist
[29:45.400 --> 29:48.800]  and they know that that's what they're training to take over we're on the March
[29:48.800 --> 29:56.600]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[29:56.600 --> 30:02.920]  the big problem with renewable energy like solar and wind is that it varies
[30:02.920 --> 30:06.640]  widely in output and there's no effective way to store the energy for
[30:06.640 --> 30:11.120]  ready availability that's why Elon Musk's Tesla has generated so much buzz
[30:11.120 --> 30:15.360]  about their powerwall battery system while the total cost of powerwall is
[30:15.360 --> 30:18.960]  still about three times the cost of power from the grid if it can achieve an
[30:18.960 --> 30:23.760]  economy of scale with large commercial users it could radically change power and
[30:23.760 --> 30:27.760]  allow people to get off the grid but another technology from Audi may be
[30:27.760 --> 30:32.120]  even far more disruptive Audi has refined a process from the 1920s that
[30:32.120 --> 30:36.360]  allows them to use renewable energy like solar to create a clean synthetic
[30:36.360 --> 30:42.240]  diesel fuel from water and CO2 they say it has no sulfur and burns cleanly but
[30:42.240 --> 30:46.760]  what I like most about it is that it consumes CO2 the boogeyman of the
[30:46.760 --> 30:52.360]  climate alarmists and at short circuits the schemes of carbon pimps like Al Gore

[33:58.040 --> 34:01.880]  spaces like on the side of the highway and stuff because there's no bigger crime
[34:01.880 --> 34:08.280]  than actually doing things like that outside of the big mega box stores you're
[34:08.280 --> 34:11.880]  not you're not supposed to do that and teach communities how to produce their

[34:41.160 --> 34:45.960]  mansions and the other half goes to buy political influence in countries
[34:45.960 --> 34:48.760]  basically almost none of the money goes to little Haitians and things like that
[34:48.760 --> 34:53.080]  little little starving kids but let's just get to it now and then
[34:53.080 --> 34:56.840]  Bill Clinton has a little flippant comments about oh there's a big
[34:56.840 --> 35:00.760]  conspiracy see anytime you point out that he's got foreign donors giving him
[35:00.760 --> 35:04.120]  illegal money according to federal law or that they're keeping the money
[35:04.120 --> 35:09.880]  I mean these are facts it's like Bono part of the UN charity it turned out was
[35:09.880 --> 35:14.520]  giving two percent of the proceeds of the millions he was raising at every
[35:14.520 --> 35:21.320]  event he was keeping the money for himself I mean if you have a
[35:21.320 --> 35:25.720]  charity and give 70 percent that's fine because you got overhead there's nothing
[35:25.720 --> 35:29.320]  wrong with being able to you know travel and get your work done and I don't have
[35:29.320 --> 35:32.040]  a charity but if I did I mean that's not bad
[35:32.040 --> 35:35.320]  Salvation Army gives about 90 percent it's one of the best ones out there from
[35:35.320 --> 35:38.680]  the research I've been I I give a Salvation Army I have no affiliation
[35:38.680 --> 35:43.400]  with it but I do give some money to it but when you get up to like 50 percent
[35:43.400 --> 35:48.280]  just on the jets and everything and then there's foreign donors and you're
[35:48.280 --> 35:52.920]  mixing political donations with your foundation it's just illegal on every
[35:52.920 --> 35:55.880]  front but of course like Al Sharpton those millions
[35:55.880 --> 35:59.480]  doesn't have to pay taxes if I if I didn't pay two million dollars in
[35:59.480 --> 36:03.960]  federal reserve taxes they would arrest me you could believe it
[36:03.960 --> 36:08.040]  but again there above law so let's go to this Bill Clinton clip
[36:08.040 --> 36:12.360]  I mean think about that there's this big nefarious strategy
[36:12.360 --> 36:15.800]  to exercise terrible influence over the American government
[36:15.800 --> 36:19.400]  by talking wealthy people in countries aiming to give them money to help poor
[36:19.400 --> 36:22.920]  people that's the theory of the case and I just
[36:22.920 --> 36:27.400]  don't believe over the long run the American people won't figure that out
[36:27.400 --> 36:32.040]  oh yeah let me talk like a regular guy to you
[36:32.040 --> 36:39.320]  and Obama does the same little fake thing where he bites his lip and pauses
[36:39.320 --> 36:42.920]  and goes um let me uh like he's actually
[36:42.920 --> 36:46.520]  thinking and he's even got uh uh uh on the teleprompter
[36:46.520 --> 36:51.080]  it's all fake there's no teleprompter here
[36:51.080 --> 36:55.880]  ladies and gentlemen because I'm speaking from intellect and my heart
[36:55.880 --> 36:59.800]  and passion these people set up there to pacify everyone
[36:59.800 --> 37:05.000]  there's no NSA spying he didn't have sex with that woman
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.600]  hundreds of millions in foreign political donations
[37:10.600 --> 37:13.960]  when his wife was secretary of state and she's getting the money and living
[37:13.960 --> 37:17.080]  in houses and flying in helicopters and jets
[37:17.080 --> 37:20.920]  we're talking the most expensive 75 million dollar jets is what they're
[37:20.920 --> 37:25.320]  flying on the most expensive private jets
[37:27.560 --> 37:31.800]  and it's Saudi princes oh there's no influence there
[37:31.800 --> 37:35.720]  how about I start a foundation and then just have
[37:35.720 --> 37:39.080]  jets and stuff and then you give none of the money to the poor basically and
[37:39.080 --> 37:44.280]  then sit in political office
[37:44.840 --> 37:47.960]  people go oh who cares about the Bilderberg group and and Hilary violating
[37:47.960 --> 37:51.560]  the Logan Act you know she got fined for that back in the 90s
[37:51.560 --> 37:57.800]  now they don't even get fined world leaders and us leaders go to Bilderberg
[37:57.800 --> 38:02.040]  they drive in in secret service motorcades
[38:02.520 --> 38:05.240]  and they point guns at us we have footage of this in virginia
[38:05.240 --> 38:09.640]  because we're there showing the illegal meeting and the secret service
[38:09.640 --> 38:14.760]  held up mp5s at us and looked at us like we were evil
[38:14.760 --> 38:17.960]  like we were intimidated we've done nothing wrong
[38:17.960 --> 38:21.160]  we're the good guys
[38:26.760 --> 38:30.920]  I mean what media wouldn't want to cover Hilary and Obama meeting in secret
[38:30.920 --> 38:34.280]  in 2008 when for a day and a half the media is like where are they where are
[38:34.280 --> 38:36.200]  they where are they they've disappeared in virginia
[38:36.200 --> 38:41.720]  we knew where they were and then they'd have these marines
[38:41.720 --> 38:45.000]  flipping us off in uniform and out of uniform
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.360]  just search marines flip the bird at Bilderberg
[38:48.360 --> 38:53.000]  there's video of it and photos and that was because
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.400]  the marines didn't know who we were at that time
[38:55.400 --> 38:59.320]  and they told them we later learned from marines that apologized to me
[38:59.320 --> 39:05.480]  through a back channel that we were an anti-military group that hated veterans
[39:05.480 --> 39:08.680]  groups I mean this whole government is about
[39:08.680 --> 39:12.280]  lying to people just like they're on the news
[39:12.280 --> 39:15.640]  saying that governor Abbott doesn't like the military
[39:15.640 --> 39:19.640]  and louis gomert doesn't like the military and alex jones doesn't like the
[39:19.640 --> 39:22.920]  military and chuck norris now you know we thought you
[39:22.920 --> 39:27.880]  liked the military as if liking the military has
[39:27.880 --> 39:32.920]  anything to do because our friends and family are in it
[39:32.920 --> 39:37.080]  and it was founded in 1776 and that's such a great history
[39:37.080 --> 39:43.560]  it's been hijacked and overtaken it's not ours anymore the only way to get it
[39:43.560 --> 39:48.040]  back is to admit the country has been stolen
[39:48.040 --> 39:51.800]  and they're busy stealing the final little pieces
[39:51.800 --> 39:58.360]  of the puzzle right now and finally praise the lord
[39:58.360 --> 40:04.120]  and pass the ammunition in the info wharf the sleeping giant that is texas
[40:04.120 --> 40:07.240]  i'm so proud of my state
[40:07.640 --> 40:11.640]  a long history of independence a long history of wanting to be productive and
[40:11.640 --> 40:15.000]  free and and and of and of low taxes and second
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.880]  amendment and all these people evacuating california
[40:19.880 --> 40:23.480]  and a good point was made to me about a lot of californians and emails and calls
[40:23.480 --> 40:26.040]  they said it was pretty much the same sentiment when i've been bashing
[40:26.040 --> 40:29.160]  california california is beautiful state a lot of great people
[40:29.160 --> 40:33.560]  they said alex we heard you say that california used to be a lot like texas
[40:33.560 --> 40:36.120]  which it was
[40:36.440 --> 40:41.160]  50 60 years ago don't you understand everybody moved here looking for a
[40:41.160 --> 40:45.000]  quick buck and to be stars they aren't californians
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.280]  so they've now just failed here and they're coming to your state
[40:48.280 --> 40:54.600]  those rude horrible demonic backstabbing manipulative people
[40:54.600 --> 40:59.400]  that you're talking about are not californians and i think that's a
[40:59.400 --> 41:03.560]  fair statement because you meet real californians laid back cool
[41:03.560 --> 41:08.680]  awesome uh they're like liberal in ways but conservative and others
[41:08.680 --> 41:12.600]  they defy the stereotypes they're more classical liberal
[41:12.600 --> 41:18.280]  so it's true uh you're you're correct i am corrected
[41:18.280 --> 41:21.400]  a lot of people come to texas now and you know half the state's not from texas
[41:21.400 --> 41:24.760]  and then they think that's who we are
[41:27.400 --> 41:31.480]  but really it's just a bunch of drifters now there are a lot of people that have
[41:31.480 --> 41:33.480]  moved from states that are collapsing that are great
[41:33.480 --> 41:38.040]  hard-working folks and we love them but when you run into
[41:38.040 --> 41:41.640]  failed drifters they've always got a new scan they've always got something new to
[41:41.640 --> 41:45.080]  be famous they've always got some new flim flam
[41:45.080 --> 41:49.240]  and they are narcissistic mental patients that travel around like
[41:49.240 --> 41:59.080]  bands of 21st century thuggies just overthrowing your laws overthrowing
[41:59.080 --> 42:03.000]  your freedoms fedding the nest like they do everywhere
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.240]  else it's amazing now let's get to the over the top incredibly important jade
[42:07.240 --> 42:14.520]  helm news first off do we have the clip from
[42:14.520 --> 42:19.320]  cnn that i sent you yesterday that we only played part of that has do first
[42:22.760 --> 42:26.840]  yeah well what i want is the intro piece that i sent nico
[42:26.840 --> 42:31.720]  another were a couple cnn pieces but the one i want is where they edit me and
[42:31.720 --> 42:34.120]  and and and we've got that and come right in with me and joe that's what i
[42:34.120 --> 42:37.640]  want to play so we're gonna we're gonna play that today in fact cue that up
[42:37.640 --> 42:42.040]  because i want to play this first so we can detail again how the deception
[42:42.040 --> 42:44.440]  works we've got it ready go yours comes on and
[42:44.440 --> 42:47.720]  says we hate the military and he's trying to defend our poor military
[42:47.720 --> 42:52.680]  while they got spit on in vietnam and now now people are spitting on them again
[42:52.680 --> 42:56.760]  and i don't appreciate that he told abc news that he told a bunch of other
[42:56.760 --> 43:02.520]  publications that the same old story why it's just so sad they want to spit on
[43:02.520 --> 43:05.960]  the troops praying on the audience
[43:05.960 --> 43:10.120]  but before they go to that they have another piece where
[43:10.120 --> 43:13.800]  they're running the same story well the military is confused why they're not
[43:13.800 --> 43:17.880]  liked they thought texas liked them making it about how the military feels
[43:17.880 --> 43:21.400]  bad see using the uniform using its history like when
[43:21.400 --> 43:25.320]  that colonel was saying in bashrap a week and a half ago you see my uniform
[43:25.320 --> 43:28.440]  trust this trust me
[43:28.520 --> 43:32.280]  what to follow orders like a trainer and take guns you mean no no we're gonna
[43:32.280 --> 43:35.080]  try to get control of this government that's been hijacked this is in control
[43:35.080 --> 43:38.200]  of our military that's what this is about to be like saying are you against
[43:38.200 --> 43:42.200]  the german military in 1937 no but i'm against the
[43:42.200 --> 43:46.600]  furor who runs it i mean this is so elementary
[43:46.600 --> 43:51.800]  kurtis lemay back in the 60s wanted to launch a premeditated nuclear attack on
[43:51.800 --> 43:57.080]  russia that was declassified they made a movie about it doctor strange love
[43:57.080 --> 44:01.640]  these general jack t ripper that's based on a real character that wanted to launch
[44:01.640 --> 44:06.600]  a plan like plan r to launch first
[44:08.840 --> 44:12.440]  is it anti-air force to not want to have world war three and stop
[44:12.440 --> 44:17.080]  a rogue general launching an attack see that's the bizarre mindset
[44:17.080 --> 44:20.440]  that they say you do not question if it's military you do what you're told
[44:20.440 --> 44:24.200]  well who runs the military well now they tell congress that congress doesn't
[44:24.200 --> 44:27.480]  we're we're told it's nato
[44:28.680 --> 44:32.200]  well now chuck norris has come out louis gohmert's come out and they're all
[44:32.200 --> 44:35.080]  saying no we're tired of being lied to we don't trust the government
[44:35.080 --> 44:41.320]  senator ted cruz we know the military is taking part in operations to go after
[44:41.320 --> 44:44.360]  the tea party so anytime there's a giant operation
[44:44.360 --> 44:48.520]  we don't believe a word obama says in all the new generals he's put in
[44:48.520 --> 44:52.360]  the thousands of officers he's purged we're gonna watch it we don't know this
[44:52.360 --> 44:56.520]  is nefarious but they keep changing their story
[44:56.520 --> 45:01.080]  let's go ahead and go to the cnn club by directing the state guard to monitor
[45:01.080 --> 45:05.000]  the operations will allow don't mess with texas is republican governor
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.640]  greg abbott's message to the panagon abbott called out his state guard to
[45:09.640 --> 45:13.640]  keep an eye on us special operate his letter said we respect the
[45:13.640 --> 45:17.240]  military and totally trust the troops themselves but the federal government as
[45:17.240 --> 45:21.240]  we know has been power grabbing a lot lately and texas are concerned so the
[45:21.240 --> 45:24.760]  state's going to follow its separation of powers i'm paraphrasing the letter
[45:24.760 --> 45:28.040]  you can go read it it's on info wars dot com and we're going to monitor it and
[45:28.040 --> 45:30.760]  work with them by the way the state guard was already working with them
[45:30.760 --> 45:34.360]  we're the whole thing's based out of by bass drop and in smithville and camp
[45:34.360 --> 45:39.080]  swift a former largest prisoner of war camp for
[45:39.080 --> 45:42.200]  germans in world war two
[45:42.840 --> 45:46.280]  and the state guards leaked some stuff look look i told you a month ago
[45:46.280 --> 45:50.520]  that greg abbott's awake and knows what's going on i told you check norris was
[45:50.520 --> 45:53.800]  aware of this and concerned you notice they're in the news
[45:53.800 --> 46:00.280]  we're gonna have some chuck norris world news uh next tuesday i'll just leave
[46:00.280 --> 46:04.360]  that as it may but chuck norris is a listener his son's a listener
[46:04.360 --> 46:08.840]  accomplished filmmaker and i was told about some of these
[46:08.840 --> 46:14.280]  things before they were even named two and a half months ago on a movie shoot
[46:14.280 --> 46:18.200]  in north texas and i'm going to leave it at that until next week but i told you
[46:18.200 --> 46:22.280]  the news was so amazing that i wouldn't even cover it on air
[46:22.280 --> 46:25.960]  even though i was given authorization to talk about it
[46:25.960 --> 46:31.320]  i just my gut was don't talk about it yet wait till all this stuff starts to
[46:31.320 --> 46:35.160]  come out and then let it peak
[46:35.960 --> 46:39.880]  because i didn't know the name of jade helm then i just knew this stuff was
[46:39.880 --> 46:42.600]  coming and believe me the governor knows stuff the public
[46:42.600 --> 46:47.400]  doesn't know so this is america starting to
[46:47.400 --> 46:49.720]  wake up
[46:51.560 --> 46:55.800]  read the john warren defense authorization act
[46:56.760 --> 47:01.480]  of 2007 and it says to prepare for insurrection in the states
[47:01.480 --> 47:06.360]  and in the legislatures or governments they're preparing the military to take
[47:06.360 --> 47:09.560]  over states obama three years ago said they'd
[47:09.560 --> 47:14.760]  invade texas with f-16s and run an air blockade
[47:14.760 --> 47:22.440]  if the texas voted to block the tsa groping genitals
[47:22.680 --> 47:26.440]  like i forget the exact headline it was
[47:27.320 --> 47:33.000]  feds to block air travel to texas if legislature restricts tsa
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.840]  and you'll get newspapers all over the state you can't make this stuff up
[47:36.840 --> 47:40.680]  folks and then i've got louis gomer
[47:40.680 --> 47:44.040]  with just incredible quotes he's been on the broadcast before
[47:44.040 --> 47:47.720]  he of course was an army officer himself
[47:47.720 --> 47:52.920]  they're now claiming he's anti-military louis gomer gets why some texans are
[47:52.920 --> 47:56.600]  worried about a military takeover national journal
[47:56.600 --> 48:00.520]  the texas congressman is joining others in his state calling for the pentagon to
[48:00.520 --> 48:05.560]  alter jade helm 15 military exercises and he goes on to say
[48:05.560 --> 48:09.960]  and he's on the different committees he's never seen in a drill
[48:09.960 --> 48:15.080]  a state listed as hostile it's unprecedented okay
[48:15.720 --> 48:19.400]  and by the way the they keep saying we've had drills in texas before yeah
[48:19.400 --> 48:22.760]  out in the desert tank busting if they had a patchy
[48:22.760 --> 48:26.520]  helicopters practicing to blow up russian tanks we would expect that
[48:26.520 --> 48:30.360]  this that's not what this is look we've done it before
[48:30.360 --> 48:33.960]  yeah of course you've done it before it's not this
[48:33.960 --> 48:37.960]  us special operations command preparing to launch a month-long multi-state
[48:37.960 --> 48:41.960]  exercise across private and public to prepare army special forces for threats
[48:41.960 --> 48:45.480]  anywhere in the world that's an accurate statement or at least that's what the
[48:45.480 --> 48:48.920]  pentagon would have you believe officials and citizens in texas one of
[48:48.920 --> 48:51.960]  the states involved see something potentially more nefarious in the
[48:51.960 --> 48:55.480]  exercise dub jade helm and now representative louis gomer is
[48:55.480 --> 48:58.360]  joining them over the past few weeks my office has been
[48:58.360 --> 49:02.200]  inundated with calls from jade helm 15 military exercise scheduled to take
[49:02.200 --> 49:06.680]  place between july 15th september 15th gomer said in a statement
[49:06.680 --> 49:11.000]  tuesday the military practice has some concern that the u.s army is preparing
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.840]  for modern day martial law certainly i can understand these concerns
[49:14.840 --> 49:19.000]  he can understand the concerns yeah
[49:19.080 --> 49:22.520]  because louis gomer knows what comes across his desk
[49:22.520 --> 49:26.120]  the pentagon's mission is to take on the patriots and no one knows how to
[49:26.120 --> 49:28.440]  broach this because you'll get attacked when you bring it up
[49:28.440 --> 49:32.280]  so these politicians these statesmen like the fact that we've brought it out
[49:32.280 --> 49:35.080]  i'm gonna skip this network break this is so important
[49:35.080 --> 49:37.960]  they like the fact that we brought all this out because now it makes it safer
[49:37.960 --> 49:42.520]  for them to talk about it and now everybody's
[49:42.520 --> 49:45.640]  passing around the hundreds of news articles where with a straight face
[49:45.640 --> 49:48.840]  trying to sell it see when we say it's bad they go it doesn't exist
[49:48.840 --> 49:52.680]  but when they go yeah thank god the army's trained to take on tea parties
[49:52.680 --> 49:55.480]  and take the guns and they you know those veterans are
[49:55.480 --> 49:58.440]  going to attack the police departments yeah those horrible veterans see they
[49:58.440 --> 50:02.520]  have the nerve to claim we don't like the veterans
[50:02.520 --> 50:06.120]  when they got them on stinkin don't treat list and are trained to take them
[50:06.120 --> 50:09.320]  on as a number one enemy what do you think the globalists have got planned
[50:09.320 --> 50:12.520]  that's so horrible in this country that they know the
[50:12.520 --> 50:20.040]  veterans are going to come out and fight it makes me shake to my bones
[50:20.040 --> 50:23.960]  and not in a fearful way just in a shocked bracing way
[50:23.960 --> 50:28.600]  when i think about what we've put up with and and what it must be they've got
[50:28.600 --> 50:31.480]  planned that they know the veterans are going to
[50:31.480 --> 50:35.000]  stand up and they're actually teaching every police
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.960]  department in the country to prepare for a war with the vets
[50:37.960 --> 50:43.320]  can you imagine the police departments as able as many of them are
[50:43.320 --> 50:47.880]  taking on unidentified vets once you start going at your vets and
[50:47.880 --> 50:50.680]  persecuting them and stuff man the gloves are going to come off and
[50:50.680 --> 50:55.080]  that's the plan have the vets devastate the local governments
[50:55.080 --> 50:58.440]  just like al sharp and said we're going to use all this to federalize
[50:58.440 --> 51:03.480]  everything it's a takedown plan by the globalists with their
[51:03.480 --> 51:06.120]  socialistic communist followers to get us at each other's
[51:06.120 --> 51:10.040]  throats as i've been warning for six seven years and now it's clear
[51:10.040 --> 51:13.560]  that's what they're doing
[51:14.840 --> 51:17.880]  and i told you this will all kick off as an info war first
[51:17.880 --> 51:21.560]  where they say we hate the vets we hate the police when it's not true
[51:21.560 --> 51:26.120]  ahead of staging terror attacks they're going to blame on us
[51:26.120 --> 51:31.720]  this is the only play they've got left now folks
[51:33.400 --> 51:37.720]  look at cnn pentagon no texas takeover new york times la times there was
[51:37.720 --> 51:43.720]  over 400 new articles today go to google type in jade helm click
[51:43.720 --> 51:47.240]  news and you'll see it was over 400 this morning
[51:47.240 --> 52:00.040]  in the last 24 hours 400 articles tv shows you name it
[52:00.760 --> 52:04.200]  now i sent you guys and maybe it's that clip but the one i sent you was right
[52:04.200 --> 52:07.160]  from the start you may have trimmed it where where it's us right up front
[52:07.160 --> 52:12.600]  during the break i'll bring it to you or it's right here in my phone
[52:12.600 --> 52:16.120]  so that we can get that clip because i
[52:16.120 --> 52:19.240]  okay well the clip i had just started there we're gonna play it here in just
[52:19.240 --> 52:21.480]  a moment but but let's just go back to what
[52:21.480 --> 52:25.800]  gaumert's saying here so he says he can understand the concerns of
[52:25.800 --> 52:28.280]  martial law i mean they're shutting our power
[52:28.280 --> 52:31.240]  plants off outside law and opening the borders up that
[52:31.240 --> 52:36.360]  that is martial law it's an increment of it
[52:36.440 --> 52:38.920]  when leaders quote in the congress from within the current administration
[52:38.920 --> 52:41.720]  believe that major threats to the country include those who support the
[52:41.720 --> 52:45.640]  constitution and military veterans are even clinging to guns or religion
[52:45.640 --> 52:48.360]  patriotic americans have reason to be concerned
[52:48.360 --> 52:51.320]  everything gaumert quoted is public there
[52:51.320 --> 52:56.360]  bitter clingers veterans gun owners number one enemy
[52:57.240 --> 53:00.200]  the congress from to particular issue with the layout of the labels the
[53:00.200 --> 53:04.600]  pentagon map of the exercise once i observe the map depicting hostile
[53:04.600 --> 53:09.240]  permissive and uncertain states and locations i was rather appalled
[53:09.240 --> 53:13.720]  that the hostile areas amazingly have a republican majority
[53:13.720 --> 53:16.280]  cling to their guns and religion and believe in the sanctity of the united
[53:16.280 --> 53:20.120]  states constitution gaumert called on the pentagon to change the map
[53:20.120 --> 53:23.320]  the names on the map and said the tone of the exercise needs to be completely
[53:23.320 --> 53:25.800]  revamped so the federal government is not intentionally
[53:25.800 --> 53:30.440]  practicing war against its own states and that's what this is about
[53:30.440 --> 53:34.520]  getting the military use to being deployed so they can then give them a
[53:34.520 --> 53:37.640]  new mission that is go after the people which they admit is going on behind the
[53:37.640 --> 53:42.680]  scenes with smaller groups to then roll it up and scale it up
[53:42.680 --> 53:46.360]  but we're taking their attack like weights and making our muscles for
[53:46.360 --> 53:49.880]  freedom stronger set a laying down we're pushing the weight back
[53:49.880 --> 53:53.320]  educating people about posse common taught us educating people about
[53:53.320 --> 53:57.080]  federalism educating people about the roles the military
[53:57.080 --> 54:01.080]  and civilian leadership and pushing back to have a national debate
[54:01.080 --> 54:04.120]  about why are there drills all over the country
[54:04.120 --> 54:07.720]  why is this happening and so many times we go put a camera on it
[54:07.720 --> 54:12.200]  and they're trained to take on the american people here's that cnn clip
[54:12.200 --> 54:15.400]  the site info wars has led the internet buzz
[54:15.400 --> 54:20.360]  insisting it's all a plan for the army to wage war on americans
[54:20.360 --> 54:24.200]  publishing a military powerpoint slide showing texas
[54:24.200 --> 54:27.720]  as red enemy territory i've hardly ever heard
[54:27.720 --> 54:30.520]  of something joint like this unless they're actually planning an invasion
[54:30.520 --> 54:35.160]  republican president back it up notice they didn't say
[54:35.160 --> 54:40.040]  that it was admitted to be real they went with earlier propaganda that it was
[54:40.040 --> 54:43.320]  fake remember the army times and stuff said well
[54:43.320 --> 54:46.360]  this probably isn't real uh we don't trust the
[54:46.360 --> 54:50.440]  they knew full well it was on army dot mill
[54:50.440 --> 54:53.240]  then they said that we said it was secret and that we had something secret
[54:53.240 --> 54:57.640]  that wasn't now they revert back to the old lie
[54:57.640 --> 55:02.120]  see every five seconds is a lie this is psych warfare written
[55:02.120 --> 55:05.080]  and when you know how to identify it it's disgusting that they would pray
[55:05.080 --> 55:08.840]  that's the word feed on the ignorance of the public
[55:08.840 --> 55:12.280]  implying we made that up but again that's almost subliminal it's just
[55:12.280 --> 55:16.280]  yeah they published this map claiming uh texas
[55:16.280 --> 55:20.760]  no there is no claim lady gosh you're dishonorable just
[55:20.760 --> 55:24.200]  looking at you makes me feel dishonorable thank god i'm not you
[55:24.200 --> 55:27.960]  let's go back to the club right i've hardly ever heard
[55:27.960 --> 55:30.840]  of something joint like this unless they're actually planning an invasion
[55:30.840 --> 55:34.520]  republican presidential candidate senator ted cruz says
[55:34.520 --> 55:39.240]  he understands texan's worries i think part of the reason is
[55:39.240 --> 55:43.480]  we have seen for six years a federal government disrespecting the liberty of
[55:43.480 --> 55:44.920]  the citizens i'm not going to play any more
[55:44.920 --> 55:49.160]  and then that's a good job guys thank you and then there's the washington post
[55:49.160 --> 55:51.880]  and i don't know you type in the name chuck norris i saw
[55:51.880 --> 55:57.080]  over 400 articles basically uh they got more careful with chuck norris
[55:57.080 --> 56:02.520]  because he's so universally liked uh across the board
[56:02.520 --> 56:06.280]  that they just quoting chuck norris joins ted cruz and others in operation
[56:06.280 --> 56:11.560]  jade helm conspiracy watch but they still use the word conspiracy
[56:11.560 --> 56:14.600]  and he just goes on to say listen we've seen the government do so much bad
[56:14.600 --> 56:19.080]  stuff it's good to have a state watch things that's all the governor's doing
[56:19.080 --> 56:22.040]  i mean you can just go read the quote yourself i'm paraphrasing him
[56:22.040 --> 56:25.800]  there's a world net daily article jade helm 15 crime stoppers
[56:25.800 --> 56:28.760]  and ksk
[56:28.760 --> 56:32.920]  he says i have an idea of the government insist on running expanded
[56:32.920 --> 56:37.320]  military ops across seven southwest states the cost of billions i would add
[56:37.320 --> 56:40.280]  why doesn't move all the military training south and protect our borders
[56:40.280 --> 56:43.800]  at the same time yeah that's actually constitutional duty
[56:43.800 --> 56:47.880]  whatever jade helm 15 actually is i think it's more than coincidental
[56:47.880 --> 56:52.040]  the FBI director just confessed in february that the presence of ices
[56:52.040 --> 56:55.560]  can be felt in 50 states and it goes on from there and then they misrepresent
[56:55.560 --> 57:01.800]  what he says he goes on to say trust but verify
[57:01.800 --> 57:05.640]  friends when it comes to freedom we must question verify and vet
[57:05.640 --> 57:09.480]  everyone and everything as thomas jefferson told his nephew peter
[57:09.480 --> 57:15.000]  in 1787 question with boldness even the existence of a god
[57:15.000 --> 57:22.200]  because if there is be one he must more approve the homage of reason
[57:22.200 --> 57:26.680]  than that of a blindfolded fear we must never check our brains
[57:26.680 --> 57:29.960]  or blindly trust especially the government rather we must fight until
[57:29.960 --> 57:33.000]  our dying breath for liberty especially when it appears
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.200]  those in power are trying to knock down old glory
[57:36.200 --> 57:43.400]  yeah they're obama care open borders outside of law of fast and furious
[57:43.400 --> 57:48.200]  Benghazi i mean we'd be crazy and he goes on to quote benjamin
[57:48.200 --> 57:53.160]  franklin in here as well i'm gonna find that and come back and cover
[57:53.160 --> 57:56.360]  that uh briefly you fund this operation with your

[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.360]  the enemy is showing itself more and more
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:37.480]  globalism is out in the open and it is
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:44.360]  legendary it is epic it is biblical that texas
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.320]  is resisting
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:55.080]  the way it is my uncle that died last year this is total sweetheart
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:01.560]  vietnam helicopter veteran pilot with special operations
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.000]  taught me so much of what i know my dad taught me probably more but
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.280]  my uncle was a close second
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.800]  he listened to pastor david j smith which i think is still around every time
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:18.040]  listen to him i've been walks of hatching and smith wasn't the type
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.960]  it was constantly saying he had visions about this and visions about that
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.480]  but he was kind of a mainline preacher i think it was up in oklahoma
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.840]  like 30 something years ago when he had a vision that a world government was
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:34.200]  going to take over and that texas would be a stronghold
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.120]  against it and my uncle said that with his
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.640]  discernment and prayer that he knew that was true
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:47.560]  and that this is what i was already on the air
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:52.440]  and that basically i should tell people that and try to help folks make
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:56.600]  preparation for it of course i never did i've never spoken of this until now
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.400]  and then now i just see texas across the board resisting
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:07.240]  and the first place to start with a giant a sleeping giant is
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.400]  starting to wake up as world government and
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:16.520]  smart dust and in tv's watching everybody i mean my god
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.680]  global abortion uh just like i said the
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.840]  none of us are safe when the veterans can be put on don't treat list and they
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.640]  just spend the whole thing like oh the va screwed up
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.600]  that'd be like saying jeffrey domers screwed up no he didn't screw up man it
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.560]  was premeditated john wane gasey was premeditated
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.480]  ted bondy was premeditated i'm tired of it
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:43.560]  and i'll be honest with you i don't like messing with these dangerous people
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.040]  but if you're gonna mess with them because they're not gonna quit messing
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.960]  with us you better go all the way and that's just all i can tell you is
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:57.960]  man i wish every day i'd been wrong about all this stuff
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.800]  i mean i wish every day
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.560]  that i was wrong and you know what i wasn't wrong about any of it don't tell
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:09.000]  you why i wasn't wrong about any of it because i
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.280]  i just began studying this and getting on the trail of it
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:17.000]  after all these great people john burcher's
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.720]  fbi agents cops people like my uncle scholars like my dad
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.040]  countless other people when i was a kid talked about all this and my
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:33.560]  heavenly father i cannot believe how right they
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:37.320]  were and how they were fighting so hard back then when nobody knew the
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.080]  federal reserve was private and nobody knew what was going on
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.880]  to warn people so we'd have a defense down the road
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.240]  when all of this came down
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.880]  because once the shields fall and real tyranny comes in
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:54.760]  they're coming after everybody folks and i don't mean people that just fought
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.440]  evil they hate anyone who is upright and beautiful and
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.400]  strong and who has built something these people
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.240]  have a will to dominate the next guy we got coming up
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.560]  gets persecuted for planting city gardens
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.920]  they just hate normal human life men and women
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:19.240]  loving each other families gardening farmers
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:26.360]  ranching metallurgy physical fitness uh wholesomeness they just
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.240]  and it doesn't mean those of us that want wholesomeness are on some high horse
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.360]  are perfect it just means we want to gravitate
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:37.480]  towards that and and there look there's not room for both groups of
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.840]  evil and good you understand that the evil wants to extinct good
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.640]  and to see the amazing awakening happening
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.080]  is buoying and invigorating but also horrifying
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.280]  because man the enemy is freaked out right now
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.440]  and they're gonna attack like a ton of bricks

[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.840]  by attaching a tiny computer to a drone robot experts were able to show how
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.640]  the device could be used for nefarious purposes
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.720]  while in the sky the drone poses as an open wi-fi network
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.480]  and tricks other devices to connect to it once that connection has been made
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:21.400]  any information that passes through like credit card information or home
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:25.080]  addresses can be obtained because drones are inexpensive
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:29.560]  small and hard to detect when they're high in the sky bad guys can operate
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.240]  illegally and anonymously but there are some simple steps you can take to
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:37.160]  protect yourself avoiding open wi-fi networks is the first step
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.760]  and if you must connect to a public wi-fi network make sure the web address you
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:44.920]  visit is correct and not a dummy site only open websites that have
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.640]  https in the address and when accessing a banking website

[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.120]  both apply to what i want to share with you today
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:53.000]  in my culture warrior column that's chuck norris
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.280]  and to be a little blasphemous but not intentionally i mean it's a joke
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.400]  if chuck norris be with us and for us who be against us
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:07.240]  all right that's a little too far on the chuck norris jokes uh but
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.400]  i first heard about all this
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:16.040]  from the whole norris combine about jade helm and stuff
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.560]  several months ago and i talked about it i said huge military news with the
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.000]  governor with stuff is going on the feds the state knows what's going on
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.760]  well of course the state knows i mean we've had half our power plants seized
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:33.720]  outside of law and just shut off and that all ties in to the war on
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.080]  lemonade stands that forbes asked a few years ago why is there a war on lemonade
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:41.800]  stands why is there a war on amish why is there a war on backyard gardens and
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.880]  you know they said in tulsa we want inspections you might be growing pie
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.000]  because there's nothing worse than a backyard garden folks or or
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.600]  zone people harassing folks for tomatoes growing in their windows or whatever
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.480]  yeah there's the headline the inexplicable war on lemonade stands no
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.640]  it's big mega box stores that want to end normal human activity and have
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.720]  giant food deserts everywhere let me tell you one of the most
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:09.640]  enjoyable things i don't have time to do it anymore my kids do it
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.640]  it's so much fun to go out until the soil we got nine acres out in the country
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:18.120]  outside austin's the little plot on in fruit trees on it and stuff
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.440]  it's so much fun to pick the plums and pick the apples and pick the
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.560]  you know different things that are out there it's so much fun to pick the
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:33.800]  spinach and pick the squash and to even grow our own pumpkins and things like
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:37.720]  that and and it's just so simple you plant it you take care of it it grows
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:41.160]  my favorite is hot peppers i mean you're talking about for a couple dollars you
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.600]  could have a whole field of pepper plants growing
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:48.360]  you could take them to a farmer's market and sell them but there's a war against
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.520]  that and i remember reading about johnny apple
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.880]  seed three years ago and i remember reading about him in school but
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.640]  i reread about johnny apple seed in seven states
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:04.760]  it's estimated planting over a million apple trees and other fruit trees and
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:06.840]  teaching people how to take care of themselves
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:11.000]  well germany forever plants stuff in the highway
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.600]  rideaways and local community groups just go and they just pick an area and
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.400]  they just plant fruit trees and stuff and they go and pick them and they eat them
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.880]  and they can them and they sell them or whatever
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.320]  well here though that's the new crime and i didn't even know this guy was doing
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.640]  this i separately you can watch the video at the info or seed center
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.600]  and info or store dot com we have eight different companies
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:35.880]  the best low-cost high quality non-gmo heirloom seeds because monsanto is an
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.480]  award to buy up all the seeds and with two other gmo companies and just
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.600]  basically ban their sale but these are groups still doing it
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:47.880]  everything you need to survive and i've explained that even in
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.920]  urban areas we've gone out and shown this on video you can go to the middle of a
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:56.280]  you know the highway in the middle of the woods with some
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.040]  little 200 square foot open area of the sun dig it up plant tomatoes
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.920]  and get more tomatoes that you can ever even harvest
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:08.920]  this is nature's bounty ron finley has had a rest warrants issued for him
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:13.400]  out in LA trying to get this going and the studies show you get young people
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.560]  growing things or you get young people even with a fish tank or a dog to take
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:21.240]  care of but especially plants we release
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.480]  hormones it's been shown that calm us when we're out in the garden with the
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:29.480]  bees and the sunflowers and the and the
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.640]  watermelons and just everything it's so much fun
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:37.080]  to do this it's a normal human agrarian activity
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:41.480]  and there's the ron finley project here i was saying copy johnny apple seed and
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.800]  then nico a few months ago said if you're about this guy in the only
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.920]  times places who they've tried to arrest and find and
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:50.440]  fee because he dares to go into these you know
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.760]  government lots with weeds everywhere and plant stuff and then other people get
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.560]  involved and they start planting and then they start demanding
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:01.320]  hey we want part of this city park that nobody uses for a city
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:05.400]  city garden and next they're gonna want chickens in their
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:08.360]  backyards next they're gonna want to be independent humans
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:12.760]  see the globalists don't want us to be self-sufficient this is the essence
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:17.080]  of the plantation the essence of the reservation is you can't be
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:23.560]  self-sufficient and that's the plan ron finley dot com
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.200]  very very uh crowd rise dot com ron finley hq
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.760]  very exciting what ron's doing i mean this guy

[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.000]  is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the federal
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.480]  reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:53.400]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes these questions and more can be answered

[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.080]  if you owe back taxes it's a fact that the government has the power to take

[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:10.920]  don't know much about history don't know much biology
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:18.440]  don't know much about a science book don't know much about the french I took
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:25.560]  what I have to learn that I love you and I know that if you love me too follow
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:29.880]  wonderful world this is for you I have good will towards people and the system
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:33.000]  wants to eradicate that because free will gets in the way of the
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.880]  corporatist program don't know much trigonometry
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:40.120]  the reason I get so excited about city gardening but also rural gardening
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:44.200]  truck farms you name it is that everything the social
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:47.560]  engineers are doing as our guest said is about ending that
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.760]  he's agreed to do this for the whole hour so at about 40 after I'm going to
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.600]  give the number out we're going to take some calls
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.040]  about your stories of city gardening or articles you want to talk about where
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:59.640]  people get in trouble for gardening in their front yard or their backyard
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.880]  this is a real attempt to intimidate people but if we start doing this
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:07.640]  it can circumvent the monsanto tyranny all of it remember they just cut the
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.440]  fluoride in the water in half this week
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.880]  we're having major victories mcdonald's is starting to take the gmo out
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:17.640]  we're having victories with our actions and
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:22.440]  plants seeds are so magic that you can plant a little seed and a whole mustard
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.080]  tree grows you can have mustard for 20 years from it
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:29.880]  or you can plant a seed in a pecan tree grows or an apple tree
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:33.240]  or strawberries I mean this is this is nano tech
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:36.280]  god's nano tech I'm gonna shut up because this is a short segment long
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:39.720]  segment coming up with Ron Finley Ronfinley.com I know you don't like
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.720]  talking about yourself during the break you're like I don't want to brag about
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.600]  myself talk about your story what you've done in LA
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.280]  the thousands you've inspired but also the persecution you went through
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:52.360]  so you see this tomato with shellac that begins the wheels going tell people your
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.640]  story. Well I mean it was the tomato with
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:59.400]  shellac alex but it was also I mean that was just like
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.720]  almost a tipping point for the you know the straw
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:08.120]  and you you just look around and all of a sudden you realize that all you see is
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:12.040]  asphalt and concrete and my whole thing like you was like I want
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.200]  I don't want my food loco I want my food hyper loco
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:20.680]  you know why in this desert that we live in in california why are we
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:24.920]  watering grass when you can use the less water
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:31.560]  and water and grow food which is what we need here and why aren't yards full
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.560]  all this beautiful food all this beautiful food
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:37.640]  right exactly well I mean and what happened what happened with my story
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:42.600]  you know after I got persecuted you know had to go to court the first time I
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:47.320]  decided years later and I thought they forgot about and I did it again
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:51.080]  and so basically got thrown under the bus again
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:55.400]  and tell us what you did though I mean it's it's amazing
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:27:00.600]  where you planted what they did the plant there we have these these um in front
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.360]  of the they're called parkways it's like right before you get to the
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.800]  street that strip of land you know strip of grass
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:11.000]  and like in these pictures I'm standing in the street so
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.400]  I decided to just remove my grass by I sheet moched it with cardboard a lot of
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:21.560]  it and I planted food but first Alex it started only for
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.320]  beautification of my of my block of my neighborhood
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.840]  I mean I wanted to be kissed by hummingbirds every day I wanted to see
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:35.000]  my butterfly I wanted I wanted to smell lavender and jasmine and rosemary so
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.520]  that's where that's where it started and so then I started
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:45.080]  and then it came down again long story short I took 150 feet
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:50.120]  by 10 by about nine 10 feet and I made a food force
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:53.880]  that I wanted to feed my I wanted my neighbors basically to see
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:57.160]  look you can design your own life and you can start here
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:01.240]  I use it as a canvas like I use the soil Alex that that's
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.520]  that's my that's this is my street art this is my graffiti
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.640]  and that's how I treat it but also it beautifies
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:11.960]  it purifies and it's all you're cleaning the air you're bringing in pollinators
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:16.040]  you're bringing in all kinds of insects and you're feeding people
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:20.680]  but also the the it's it's it's multi-layered because people pass by
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:23.960]  and like he was saying they see these flowers they see this it's color
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:28.200]  therapy Alex you know it helps the value of the neighborhood too
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:33.000]  exactly exactly but it in it and in that it changes people's perspective it
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.760]  changes their mind people are smiling I mean
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:40.280]  and you're having conversations that you would never have had
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:42.760]  you know just because you're also a really good gardener I've looked at

[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:38.920]  it's not it's not bit tearing it down you know it's it's it's educating

[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:44.920]  you know i said i got a hashtag real gangsters grow
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:48.120]  grow food you know real jeez grow flowers
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:51.720]  you know and that and that that's that's that's that's true to me man it's like
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:56.680]  is all the lessons are in the soil you know i don't i don't good i don't grow
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:00.280]  food i grow soil you know because you are
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:03.880]  people they tell us you are what you eat that's kind of not true
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:07.400]  because you are what you eat eats you know now if your
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:11.400]  soil is deficient of any kind of nutrients what do you think your plant's
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.280]  going to be what do you think your lettuce is in your tomatoes
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:17.240]  they're not going to they're not going to grow they're not going to prosper but
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:21.800]  the same thing like you was saying everything starts from a seed
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:26.200]  and we started from a seed out and people people get away from that concept
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.640]  man that that look at what we turned into in the same thing this
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:33.560]  little tiny seed can give you you know a 50 foot tree
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:37.000]  that gives you fruit year after year after year after year
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.480]  you know we we we have to we have to look at things different we have to look
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:45.080]  even our so-called waste alex we have to look at different
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.520]  you know i tell people you know people think leaves are debris and it's a
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:53.400]  it's a pain in its trash i'm like no no leaves are a resource
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.680]  you know a leaf falls for a reason in a particular season
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:00.280]  that's by design you know and we need to stop trying to change
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:05.640]  mother earth's design and and do biomimicry and mimic what she's doing
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:12.280]  because who guards in a forest alex if nobody so how the hell do we have 350
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:15.720]  foot trees you know because that's because it's a it's a
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:20.600]  divine plan it's an incredible it's it's magic and all the
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.560]  synergy and the harmony and absolutely
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:27.080]  you know when i had children my brain clicked and i
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:31.480]  opened up a lot but when you garden it really is spiritual
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:35.960]  and that's why they don't want people doing it because you zone out when
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:40.600]  you're doing it you just it's just programmed into us
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:46.920]  to be life givers life builders to work with the earth to be positive
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:53.560]  imagine you need a garden you know it becomes your solace
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:57.560]  and that's what i tell people man is this the soil seduces you
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:01.240]  i mean period and you got to think that that's where we come from that's what
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:05.080]  we are man and i'm trying to just get people back and
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:09.320]  and to where you can design your own life i talk to kids i was they don't
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:12.360]  dream you know and then that bothers me
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:16.040]  because a dream is free but you got people's mind to the point that they
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:19.240]  don't even dream that's control and i'm trying to break
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:22.920]  sure everybody's inside in these in these food prisons
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:26.600]  in these in these neighborhoods with no plants and they're in there watching
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:30.040]  tv watching these incredibly unhappy rich people
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:32.840]  because i know a bunch of them thinking that they
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:36.040]  aren't adequate and they've got to follow what this is saying
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.680]  we're being farmed by the corporatist it's time to get out of that system get
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:44.520]  outside and start doing this and it i mean it
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.320]  really is in my gut but also intellectually i know this is one of the
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.480]  keys to really overturning this system peacefully
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:54.120]  because they sell us on violent revolutions the way to go well that's
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:58.360]  because they can win that every day but a velvet revolution of culture of art
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:01.800]  of food of literature of gardening that's
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.320]  something the system can't beat because it's so innately human
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:08.600]  you just do it as you were saying and everybody comes
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:13.000]  you don't have to sell anything no and but you know i i had some folks here
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.360]  they did a march against my nasanto and i'm like
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:20.280]  and people like ron we everyone was expecting you to be at the march and i'm
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:23.480]  like why were they expecting me to be there i'm like i didn't
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:28.120]  i mean hey that my son so don't really care about you guys marching
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.720]  you know what i'm saying i all the thousand and how many people
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:36.680]  was there i said you know what i did i had that day i had 60 people putting in a
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:40.600]  garden so now imagine if you had all those people
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:44.440]  that were marching and doing that which is cool i mean people need to mark but
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:48.440]  just imagine alex if that energy went into all those people putting in
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:51.400]  gardens i mean there's your fight against my
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:54.360]  exactly that's what i always say vote with your dollars vote with your action
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.600]  if the 10 000 great people that marched in almost every city like 10 000 austin
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:03.160]  even more i know in other areas if they all went and put in a garden or a plant
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:08.200]  that would overturn monsanto in a year i mean it'd be there'd be so much fresh
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:12.360]  non-gmo food everywhere it'd be crazy and what are they going to swat team us for
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:17.800]  growing tomatoes i mean we're that close if people just get into this
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.960]  no that i i that's one of the jokes i tell about my garden you know
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:26.520]  i said uh if all of a sudden you know i planted tomato next thing i know you
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:30.760]  know uh we got a black guy planting a tomato okay we want to need backup you
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:33.800]  know that you know it was like that you know they call
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:38.120]  swat because you know hey he's got cabbage out on his street you know we we got to
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:43.160]  do something about that it's ridiculous man and and we got to break these
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.680]  change these slave chains and i ain't talking i'm talking about everybody
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:52.040]  because they own our food they control our food so therefore they control us
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:55.960]  and well looking at it and waging war against the american farmer for 70 80
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:59.400]  years these robber barons know what they're doing
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:03.160]  yeah and the thing about it they're depleting all the resources from the
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:07.400]  soil to the water while they're doing it and they're creating all these super
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:12.200]  bugs and super weeds you know because of the toxic sprays and
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:16.280]  everything is a new rare cancer now you every day you let oh she has a rare
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:20.760]  cancer i'm about to say i've studied this architecture of this evil
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:25.960]  it's so hard to be as evil as they are i mean how did they come up with something
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:31.080]  you're so good doing Alex how did they do it so well then
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.920]  yeah no i'm saying if they're just so i mean they are so evil i mean when you
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:37.320]  really study them they know what they're doing i mean they
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:41.000]  these are some smooth operators that's one of those don't hate the player hate
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.960]  the game kind of thing because they know that if we could do what they do as good
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.440]  as they do i mean oh man the world would be a beautiful place but
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:55.480]  my word has spread literally Alex around the world i mean from
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:02.200]  from north korea to africa man i i i've i've spoken at cutter and oman and

[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:31.720]  of what will defeat the system and i mean the thing about with my

[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:31.640]  and good afternoon gentlemen pleasure to meet you uh ron and alec uh ron i got a
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:35.240]  question for you what do you think about the geoengineering that's going on with
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:39.640]  the california drought alex had a guest on some time ago from
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:45.240]  stopthecrime.net and she discusses different things about uh the
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:50.120]  onesanto grew purposely putting things into the clouds to prevent the rain
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:53.880]  while causing more rain and more devastation on the in the midwest with
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:57.400]  their snowstorms and depriving us of well we know
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:01.320]  geoengineering is going on but they classify what they're doing
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:04.680]  just like you mentioned superweeds antibiotic resistant stuff from the
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:08.760]  chickens and everything else are you aware of the larger
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:12.040]  program of manipulating the weather
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:16.600]  no i mean i know i mean you you see it though i mean
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:20.920]  it's funny because even guys that fly the planes they oh those are
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:25.000]  those are com trails that's every yeah why are they in this pattern dude
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.280]  well all of a sudden do they dissipate and they join together and all of a
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:35.320]  sudden we have this cloud cover um it's it's um
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:39.000]  i don't know i see here it doesn't benefit
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.760]  california which was one of the biggest agriculture states in
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:47.080]  in the united states of america they want to bankrupt the whole thing
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:51.400]  well who's that gonna that's not gonna benefit the the the
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:55.640]  the powers that be the biggest land owners in this in this state though alex
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:59.880]  i mean if their whole thing is about money alex how
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:03.320]  why would they want to bankrupt it because you just brought the key point
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:06.440]  because it's beyond that they got the ultra rich but there's people above
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:09.640]  that that are long term once they bankrupt it for a decade
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:13.400]  they can come in and buy it all up and be the bread basket for the next 200 years
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.080]  for all of north america it's long-term players
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:22.520]  terrence great question renee in south dakota you're on the air welcome
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:27.240]  well i just want to say that in the 1920s there were no grocery stores so where
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.240]  was the groceries it was in the gardens it was in the homes it was on the farms
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:34.600]  it was all local you know you didn't have to go to
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.960]  the grocery store now they got us they know that
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:41.960]  and i've been planting my plants i've been buying just straight seeds
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:44.920]  and i've been putting them in plastic containers
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:49.880]  and i've got about i've got a whole garden full of seeds for one person i'm
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:53.560]  probably going to be giving away everything by the end of my season
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:58.600]  and i mean my tomatoes are already two feet high i planted them two weeks ago
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:03.880]  i just drew some seeds and it's amazing to watch the seeds come up
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:11.080]  you got magic soil renee two feet you know in two weeks that's crazy
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:14.520]  well no maybe it's been about three weeks but i mean
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:17.800]  really i mean i've been blessing my plants every day
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:21.640]  and i mean you know uh you know they they do
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.400]  respond it's amazing to seeing the watermelon seeds come up and
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:30.040]  then sprouting out of the soil and you know it's you know i throw a little cup
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:32.920]  of water on them each day in my windowsill
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:36.280]  what ron said though i love how you're out in your garden and
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:39.880]  that little hummingbird flies up right by your face and then winks that you
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:43.080]  flies off i mean that's it i would say gardens are a lot
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:46.520]  better than watching tv i mean i'm here to tell you
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:51.480]  no literally you get seduced i mean i you know i've known i've gone out in the
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:54.360]  morning to watch to watch stuff and all of a sudden it's four
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:57.640]  hours later when you were only supposed to be out there 20 minutes
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:01.800]  you know no i it's like it becomes your solace
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:08.520]  literally in your meditation i on my parkway i've actually have
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:12.520]  seeding that i made out of logs man and you can come and people
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:17.240]  are sitting out there having coffee and i mean the bottom line if you build it
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:21.160]  it's gonna people well it's been said that make art make culture that will
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:25.000]  defeat the globalist oh totally totally totally and that's
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.520]  and that's that's that's what it's all about is showing people
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:33.000]  how creative they can be and and giving them giving them the ideas man
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.280]  because we have to show a lot of people
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:39.960]  that they have the ability to dream you know we have to show look
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:43.560]  look at this you can dream about this a lot of times people need help with that
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:46.360]  and i mean that's what i think in a garden something you can do you can
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:49.400]  dream it you can grow it you can have success you can get better
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:52.840]  it can build competency this whole systems is about making you think you
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:55.800]  have no power except in the system renee thank you

[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:36.200]  of our bodies are made of water good thing we have the burkey system it's
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:39.400]  the cleanest best water ever mom says it's because the burkeys
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:43.080]  filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure delicious
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:47.400]  water i know right you love it too yeah i'm thirsty too

[01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:03.560]  dot com and it's that type of behavior
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:06.840]  that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:10.920]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:13.720]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:16.760]  control television music fast food gmo's
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:20.680]  sugars you name it young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:24.040]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:28.040]  it's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:30.920]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:34.040]  find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:36.440]  would actually like and take we worked with the lean

[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:41.480]  it's not over simplistic to say going back to the soapbox going back to the
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:45.080]  community going back to having your neighbors over for a barbecue going
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:48.360]  back to having a garden going back to disconnecting the
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:51.800]  television a few hours a day and taking your kids off the video games
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:56.520]  going fishing uh going playing a softball game

[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:06.760]  that's not in this big globalist combine and nothing like micro agriculture
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:10.120]  is more powerful that's why they're targeting amish it's why they're going
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:14.440]  after like i said earlier the any type of farmers markets
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:18.680]  raw milk it's why i've seen an LA where they go after these co-op
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:22.120]  pleasure people are coming and selling their produce
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:25.880]  it's all done in the name of safety but it's done to dominate and control
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:29.240]  people prisoners can't grow their own food
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:32.360]  and that's what it comes down to ronfinley i want to take some more
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:35.720]  phone calls here of anything else you'd like to have before we go to joseph
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:39.640]  and others no just i mean you hit it on the head
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:43.000]  with the the whole prisoner things i mean people think because they can get
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.040]  into their swanky cars and drive around that they're
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:50.360]  that they're not in prison i mean and that's why i call these food prisons
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:53.880]  you know like you said you can't grow your own food in prison and that's
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:57.480]  there the fact that they have outlaw you know this is this is
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:02.120]  you get in you become a criminal because you plan a carrot it's it's
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:07.240]  ridiculous man and um uh it has to change and like you said
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:11.240]  earlier in the in the segment um we're we're seeing the farm and we're
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:14.840]  seeing you know mcdonald's some of those are closing we're seeing them
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:19.400]  coming oh they're slowly changing natural chicken
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:22.920]  um a lot of the stuff they're cutting out you know um
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:26.600]  and that's because people vote with the dollars dollars exactly and they see
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:30.520]  they had they see they have to their their their their sales are down and
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:34.360]  they're like okay now we it's terrible that we have to take it to
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:37.240]  this point for them to do the right thing why are you
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:40.520]  why are you selling me toxic food in the first place
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:43.720]  you know like with the thing with dunk and donuts where they had the powder
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:47.720]  sugar was supposed to be not powdered sugar was supposed to be some chemical
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:50.680]  or something that you know that looked like powdered sugar on the
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:53.640]  dunk why are you you know why are you doing this first
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:57.720]  i mean why would you do something that somebody wouldn't want done to you
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:01.400]  it's just it's just it's just a fundamental predatory nature
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:04.440]  and as you said the warmest turning very exciting times
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:08.280]  joseph in california you're on the air go ahead
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:12.520]  hey i have a question a pleasure to be on yourself but i have a question um
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:16.760]  with for friendly uh what do you think is the state's uh the state's
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:20.280]  government role in agriculture and for john's uh
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:24.360]  you just mentioned co-ops you have like do you think there should be a balance
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:27.480]  between socialism and crony capitalism because
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:30.920]  you know i'm i'm what i used to be kooky cutter liberal but now i'm a
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:33.640]  libertarian and i just think there should be a balance between the two
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:36.360]  sure listen when you hear the term co-op that has a communist
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:41.160]  competition they had co-ops for that all that means is people kind of come in
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:44.440]  as a group share some of their profits to pay for the facility
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:48.200]  and for upkeep but then people make profits so i'm talking about
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:52.840]  co-ops based on but but again co-ops only work on the micro
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:56.280]  okay that's why small is beautiful and that's what i've seen work in my own
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:01.240]  life but but that's my view what what's your take on that ron
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:04.680]  well i mean that that's what i that's what i want
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:08.600]  has you well know that you cannot eat all the food that you grow
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:12.200]  it's impossible that's all you would be doing when it's eating we're so productive
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:15.400]  we got to share it we got to shoot
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:18.920]  you had a block that was like a co-op where
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:23.400]  you grow carrots and onions and i grow lettuce and tomatoes and sally grows
[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:26.360]  cucumbers so now you don't have to grow all your
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:30.200]  food because you can trade between your uh between your
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:34.520]  exactly that's not communism that's human activity interaction stay there do

[02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:02.200]  civilization was founded by agrarian societies it is the key

[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:15.240]  uh yes um i wanted to mention i live up here in northeast iowa
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:19.080]  and it's the in my opinion the garden belt
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:24.280]  the god belt of the world and i am very fortunate to live in an area that people
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:27.800]  grow their gardens in their front yard my city loves it
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:31.240]  and i see a lot of this but i did want to mention i have a
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:37.000]  comment for ron finley he's absolutely spot on the dot because
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.960]  i was with my wife and we drove up to strawberry point probably 45 miles away
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:46.600]  from where i'm at and the incredible amount of wasted land on both sides of
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:51.480]  the interstate is just mind-numbing you can't believe the amount of food that
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:56.520]  could be grown for people and they pay to trim it and they pay to upkeep it
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:00.280]  it's just a complete joke sometimes even water the interstate
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:04.680]  is completely insane that's i mean in germany
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:08.760]  and europe you go there they still plant on the highways
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:14.920]  your take on that ron it's it's lamb people worried about like even on the
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:18.520]  parkways they're like well what about cars exhaust what about
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:21.880]  you know tired us and i'm like it's not that much traffic on these kind of
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:26.120]  streets and plus do you realize the diesel fuel that is
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:30.840]  that is exhausted when you the food that you're getting at the store
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:34.840]  how does this food as you know as when you when i pick ahead of lettuce
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:38.520]  out of my garden i better eat it within a couple hours
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:43.400]  how the hell is this food organic and all even regular food in these stores out
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:47.880]  how does it stay that fresh that long that's right you walk 20 feet into your
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:50.600]  kitchen and cut it up and make a wedge salad in my
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:53.960]  mouse watering and then meanwhile you might be eating lettuce from like
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:56.760]  guatemala that got shipped up here on trucks
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:00.200]  then they spray chemicals on it to keep it green
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:03.400]  yeah i don't i don't i don't get that um
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:06.920]  the that's why i want my food hyper local not just local
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:10.360]  you know and i think why shouldn't food everywhere they have a tree why shouldn't
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:13.400]  it be a a tree to feed you like you were saying when
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:17.800]  when people homestead when when they when they decided
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:21.320]  okay that this place was fit to live they check
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:25.400]  was this soil fertile can i grow food here
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:29.480]  and that's that's how uh a lot most places were developed

[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:27.960]  was to the uk as if it was offensive
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:32.600]  because the baby the new royal baby was named charlotte i mean this is
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:36.280]  ridiculous the incredible butt kissing there's the

[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.160]  it's truly sick and we had a revolution against this very family
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:53.800]  and then now whether it's here in japan it's just worship of the royals
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:57.720]  but oh my gosh you're making 125 000 a year you're a rich pig

[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:49.880]  here's an article man is raped at gunpoint by three women so they could
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:56.360]  collect a semen in a cooler box and steal it in south africa a man was kid
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:13:00.280]  up at gunpoint right by three women who collected his semen in a cool box and
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:04.040]  stealing it before abandoning their victim and the method is part of a
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:08.120]  growing trend the third of their old man gave the women directions when they
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:10.760]  pulled up in a black bmw is suddenly one of the women
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:14.520]  aimed at gun out and forced him to the back of the car at gunpoint
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:18.200]  the trio then drove 50 500 kilometers away
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:23.240]  or 300 miles and fondled him in the back of the car until he became aroused
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:27.640]  so they forced him to drink an unknown substance from a bottle to aid him
[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:31.720]  yeah uh uh something tells me i wouldn't get to arouse when i was kidnapped
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:38.920]  unless it was a group of marilman rose probably still not i just
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:45.720]  you can't make this up they then raped the man repeatedly and collected a
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:50.440]  semen in plastic bags placing them in a cooler box the man was kicked out of
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:54.200]  the car 500 kilometers away from where they picked him up in
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:14:02.440]  quazaeli township port elizabeth and made off with a stolen sperm the exact same
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:07.160]  method is being used by women in gothing who are also forcing men to drink from
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:12.280]  a bottle and stealing their semen but no arrests were made
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:16.920]  let me guess these women probably weren't too attractive
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:20.680]  what are women going to do though there's a major trend where men don't want to
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:23.880]  date women not because they're gay but just because women are so
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:28.760]  entitled on average so spoiled either women are amazing or they're horrible
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:31.800]  men are horrible too bunch of slobs i mean we all know that it's a modern culture but
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:37.240]  the nicer you treat a woman a lot of times the worse they behave
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:44.040]  you know my dad's a sweetheart i remember going on hunting trips and he'd look over
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:46.680]  and tell me about the ways of the world i was like 10 11 years old and
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:52.280]  he just said you know most women want you to be a little mean to him and he goes
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:54.440]  but we don't want to do that so just be quiet
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:00.040]  and then it makes them uneasy and then they're happy and he goes we don't want
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:05.960]  to be mean to him but it's what they want i just don't understand it
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:10.840]  but that's not all women that's not my grandmothers or my mother literally they're
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:17.160]  they're exceptional women but um there really are a lot of screwed up people in this world
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:23.080]  so that's just some of those there's probably 300 more articles here i just don't even know
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:30.360]  where to start uh let's talk to uh stefan in new york city the home of pace pecanisauce
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:36.760]  go ahead you're on the air hey how you doing i was listening to that van story how they had
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:40.360]  they raped that guy i imagined him trying to go and tell his friends what happened they probably
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:43.960]  didn't even believe him they're probably like i'll get out of here man that's an apple
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:46.760]  imagine they look like the women on the supreme court then
[02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:52.360]  oh god right imagine they were all a bunch of hillary cling but uh further what i really
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:57.960]  wanted to tell you was um uh i wanted to answer on real fast how we felt about hunting but that's
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:05.000]  that's long gone and now what i really want to talk about is uh i mean i don't want to have this
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:10.600]  attitude like i told you so because i really don't but um but i remember the first time i called you
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:14.600]  i told you how they want to take you texting them i was like that's what they want to do they want
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:19.240]  to take you texting them because you guys are really the last hope they're really putting a fight to
[02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:25.720]  this and i mean at the time i believe like the answer you gave me was like oh you have to understand
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:31.560]  a lot of us are already taken out a lot of us are like obese and you know sitting home and you
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:36.200]  know in trailers like we might as well i mean not not saying all that no i said most people in
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:41.960]  rural areas work at the power plant or work at walmart and they go on and watch dish tv all day
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:47.560]  but but no they look at the demographics they know texans on average will not turn their guns in
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:53.400]  and believe in low taxes and so culturally they want to mop us up you're right exactly exactly
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:59.480]  and the other thing is about with jade helm i mean you might you might have to drop on a whole new
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:05.800]  9 11 feet if you were to look at 9 11 and then you were to start telling people prior to 9 11
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:12.680]  happening the story would be oh bs you're telling me that americans are going to bring down an american
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:17.560]  tower bs show me show me so then look what happens but ends up being a terrorist bringing down this
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:21.800]  tower and then they were helping so when you see jade helm going around and then saying oh you believe
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:27.880]  americans are going to fight other american no it can very well be a terrorist attack and then boom
[02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:33.320]  there is the jade helm squad and they're ready to go so that's why i feel they might be trying to
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:39.240]  discredit you so fast and so much because you're you're really flying not only over the flag but
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:44.840]  you're probably in the flag and in its own bubble you know what i mean so right now you're you're
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:48.440]  going to be getting well we're all doing this together brother my guests my callers all of us
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:52.520]  were i mean i'm just one guy here but thank you so much for the call good to hear from you stefan
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:18:00.040]  it's it's it's really one of two things either it's a psi op test which they admit it's a psi op
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:08.200]  because they know it's really just a drill for mainly overseas they can project it and act like
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:13.480]  we're saying that you know the military hates america to demonize groups that are against
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:19.160]  paramilitarization and the incremental occupation of the country with the tsa and the rest of it
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:26.760]  or we head on something that they were planning to be big and they were going to use the major
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:32.840]  operations as a smoke screen that 99.9 percent of people weren't involved in as the cover to bootleg
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:39.240]  the real operation just like they run giant drills and operations that cover then the terror attacks
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:43.640]  at the london bombing 9 11 the list goes on and on where they run the exact same attack the exact

[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:40.360]  you're on the air thanks for holding welcome thank you alex for taking my call um i was calling
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:46.280]  because our town is in the middle of one of these fights going on right now with um having a uh with
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:52.760]  having dwarf goats and it started with the family the freeman family in visella california
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:59.400]  and she has two children a seven week old and a 19 month old and she's due to a congenital abnormality
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:06.440]  she can't produce breast milk um and so now the city has come down and they want to find her a
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:12.920]  thousand dollars a day now again we're in the agricultural heart of central california which
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:18.680]  i think is this is the craziest thing and she doesn't want to feed her baby gmo you know formula
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:24.360]  why is she being racist against gmo's i mean so what if gmo's mutate uh other mammals and
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:28.760]  studies why not give her children over to the mutation and just prove that she's loving
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:35.880]  right exactly exactly now i guess i want more high fructose corn syrup you know i mean it just
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:41.080]  don't get it and well they're losing right now they're losing momentum people are waking up that's
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:45.480]  why they're panicking it's shattering the left right paradigm but you know i've heard about the
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:51.880]  moves to ban dwarf goats ban chickens even in areas that historically have grandfather clauses
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:55.880]  to allow that tell me specifically about what's happening they're not that they don't want to
[02:26:55.880 --> 02:27:01.720]  have goats in the backyard no not in the backyard she just has two and it's to feed her infant children
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:08.120]  and um and the city has come in and said you know that can't happen yeah i see it you know i see it
[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:13.080]  in the times delta yeah those evil little goats that are given the children milk how dare them
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:20.040]  yes so she has a petition on um change.org and she also if i could throw out her plug just for
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:27.880]  the to keep up on this goat battle we have in california here it's domesticgeekgirl.com and
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:34.680]  we can use all the help because again we are in agricultural the bread basket of california i mean
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:41.800]  this and for them to say two tiny dwarf goats this isn't a full-sized goat and it's feeding
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:48.920]  her baby oh so racist oh it's just it just this one tugs it in my heart strings personally it really
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:56.600]  does really does well it's sick and again there is a pre-meditated war on this normally she has
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:28:01.480]  goats in an apartment complex where it's a private company saying this but i've now see the story
[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:06.120]  there are two little goats that she feeds her baby with and i guess she's just supposed to give
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:11.160]  them the formula that's like half corn syrup this is just crazy and you know they say those
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:15.880]  miniature goats make good pets as well and then teaches the kids how to milk their own food feed
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:21.240]  the animals just normal human activity it's got to be outlawed got to be outlawed susan thank you
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:26.680]  so much for the call oh look at the child learning how to milk the goat that is so evil he's learning

[02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:46.680]  since you mentioned john pole jones man these guys were all such characters
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:55.320]  characters real characters but uh one could spend all day just studying them that's why
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:59.640]  i just have a cursory understanding of each person but that's better than most i mean most people
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:06.200]  out there have no grasp of anything except the image of how to look successful or act powerful
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:11.320]  it's like our last guest said i thought was a very poignant intelligent guest had a great spirit you
[02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:21.000]  could feel it people thinking rolling around in fancy cars that they're free no if you got a fancy car
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:24.440]  and you're promoting liberty and freedom and got a big garden and healthy happy kids and everything
[02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:29.320]  you like a car that runs well nothing wrong with it but the car itself does not make the man
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:36.760]  like there's nothing more manly than a guy with a big beard men have beards it's an affected greechian
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:40.680]  or roman thing to not have a beard i don't like it as cradges i don't put men down who have beards
[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:45.320]  it's following me that beards are back in style it's men trying to i guess reclaim there's been
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:49.240]  a lot of sociology written on it reclaim their manhood they felt they've been gilded
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:56.760]  but the beard does not make the man just like the cowboy hat does not make a cattleman
[02:36:57.960 --> 02:37:04.040]  like i could call myself a cowboy i could say i own cows i do i could call myself a rancher
[02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:12.360]  but you notice i don't wear a cowboy hat i'm all cattle no hat but you see for a man who's been
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:22.760]  around real cowboys i am not a cowboy and when you sit there and you look at these fake liberals
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:25.800]  these piles of human manipulating trash
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:35.080]  to call themselves liberal liberal just means well read liberal means you're into freedom well
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:41.560]  man i'm the biggest liberal around but your freedom ends when it crosses my threshold
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:46.600]  and tells me what to do and you look at what these politicians are pushing and what they're doing
[02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:52.600]  they are sick people and good men and women i don't care what color you are where you came
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:57.160]  from we all do the same thing we're all the same in our heart in our dna at the end of the day
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:38:05.560]  we're all humans we act the same different races of the human race are just different sub groups
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:13.080]  of the overall race and i don't mean subgroup and a bad connotation
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:21.480]  different derivation it's like a rock squirrel in central texas a little bit bigger
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:23.400]  a little bit more aggressive
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.760]  and they're black and gray and then you got the classic squirrel it's brown
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:34.760]  well they can still breed together but they don't it's a it's a funny thing
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:42.520]  because it's two different clans it's two different two different groups two different tribes
[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:48.280]  but then you can go to enchanted rock and see rock squirrels that have read
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:53.320]  bred with two other different subspecies of squirrels and it's cool looking spotted squirrels so
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:58.760]  in some areas they do but it's whatever the environment pressure drives them to do
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:04.040]  is what it then produces and the average person never even thinks of things like this they just
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:09.800]  sit back and let other men and women engineer the planet and engineer the culture the way they
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:16.440]  see fit and then guess what these are a bunch of greedy hateful people that have engineered
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:18.200]  the culture
[02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:27.800]  so that it's easy for them to run and makes them feel big because we're dumbed down and poor and
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:34.840]  stupid well that's no elite right there a real elite wants to raise people up a real elite is so
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:45.240]  cool that they don't need to dominate they're going to be followed a real elite revels in
[02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:50.760]  seeing other people become greater than they because there's a shared kinsmanship and a strength
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:55.800]  in the species i want to hit a bunch of news but let's go through the next five six callers daniel

[02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:33.160]  wasn't for Canada during the great depression our people would have died out i mean we hunted
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:36.840]  the turkey and the deer promise extinction extinction because we were starving to death
[02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:42.520]  but no i hear you i mean i mean my family in east texas was upper middle class a lot of them but
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:48.760]  they still shot deer out of season and uh people make fun of it but they eat possums and stuff
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:54.120]  and especially the poor blacks whatever they could get just to survive people make jokes about
[02:41:54.120 --> 02:42:00.360]  poor people eating possum and stuff i mean you eat a possum or you die and can you imagine when the
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:06.600]  society collapses which they're designing this is genin 21 collapse program and selling the idea
[02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:11.560]  what it's going to be like when the average yuppie i mean i don't know how to fix a car or
[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:16.440]  roof a house or fix the plumbing like my dad does and he doesn't know how to do it like his
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:22.760]  daddy did but compared to the general public i'm like a handyman can you imagine when the when the
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:28.920]  crap hits the oscillating cylinder what's going to happen oh definitely and it's like you were
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:32.840]  staying during the great depression people don't believe it but our ancestors yours too because
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:39.160]  you know you're from this area originally we people got so hungry um alex that people even bold
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:43.960]  bold the souls of their boots and shoes you know they eat them that's how hungry people were during
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:49.080]  the great depression people don't realize how you know how serious that was well they're going to
[02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:55.400]  find out this whole artificial systems coming down by design and the government's bunkering and huge
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:02.680]  stockpiles of food and medicine and water and i just we're i look at this i appreciate your
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:07.960]  call and i mean it's like aliens are running it and i want to be clear i'm not saying aliens
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:14.360]  are running and i don't get into all that but the more i look at it it's like the bible says it is
[02:43:14.360 --> 02:43:22.680]  not of this world what governs this world the god of this world is not of this world because
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:31.480]  elites do things that are even against their own self-interest to hurt the earth to hurt fellow humans
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:35.000]  and it's beyond just enjoying hurting people
[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:43.160]  but it's also just a bunch of spoiled rotten people i mean there's just so many spoiled rotten
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:47.800]  people out there that think it's their right to do whatever they want dominate other people
[02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:53.160]  it and good people have laid down and created a climate that's allowed all this bo tea thanks for
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:59.880]  holding from texas here on the air with gardening ideas go ahead hey what's up go ahead my friend
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:06.040]  hey uh you know how to use the niggas to ask you don't write yes sir well i've
[02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:12.360]  chosen an idea to turn that some bitch into the world's largest greenhouse now i think that's a
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:19.080]  beautiful idea to have a use that the taxpayers are paid for that i don't want no fat cat getting
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:24.840]  all of it used for a gambling consumer or anything like that what do you think about that idea well
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:30.680]  aren't they using the astrodome for like conventions and stuff not astrodome is decrepit
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:35.880]  it's vacant they don't know what to do it i'll show you my ignorance it's coming to pyramid
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:42.440]  Memphis they finally turned into the biggest indoor swamp or whatever for a bass pro shop or whatever uh
[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:49.560]  listen i i was ignorant about that but yes that would be a great idea to turn that into a greenhouse
[02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:55.160]  and let people go register get signed up and then have their plot to grow stuff in there but that's
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:45:00.760]  the last thing governments want is to teach people to be self-sufficient i follow sports so little
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:06.040]  that i apologize that i wasn't aware of what was going on in the astro down where do they play
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:11.480]  baseball now well they've got a place called a minute made park and then the football team
[02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:17.080]  got a brand new stadium right by the astrodome and the astrodome's been vacant for years and
[02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:21.160]  they don't know what to do if they can't tear it down because it costs millions of dollars to tear
[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:28.120]  it down so it's just sitting there infested with rats and stuff like that well maybe hillard
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:32.600]  can store all the stolen money in there or something good to hear you appreciate those points
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:40.440]  lewis in texas go ahead welcome well hi elix pleasure to be on um i just started listening
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:45.240]  to your show about six months ago uh amazingly in california but um i'm here in texas and it's a
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:51.320]  great state but uh pertaining to my question i i have a question pertaining uh with texas and
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:55.880]  its state powers i believe in equal opportunity i believe in the right to bear arms i believe in
[02:45:55.880 --> 02:46:02.520]  the right to uh for every american student to have uh equal educational opportunities but i don't
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:07.080]  think i don't think that's socialism and you know that's that's a government investment but i think
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:12.120]  the government should be utilized by the people to invest into infrastructure and education and
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:18.040]  all these uh great um things but you know i i always hear you um criticizing liberals and
[02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:25.800]  and sometimes it kind of irritates fake liberals uh back of what fake liberals fake liberals
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:31.480]  yeah fake liberals yeah i i remember because my dad protested against the iraq wars he's kind of a
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:35.960]  hippie and you know i was against the iraq war because it wasn't the country that was involved
[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:41.800]  in the attacks yeah well yeah of course and and like you know and i see a lot of stuff like
[02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:45.480]  because there's a bunch of liberal propaganda out there but there's also a lot of republican
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:51.160]  propaganda out there absolutely here's the deal here's the deal the democrats are in power right
[02:46:51.160 --> 02:46:55.800]  now and they're going a million miles an hour into tyranny when the republicans are in power
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:01.720]  i'll support the ones that tell the truth and i'll go after the ones that are tyrants it's like
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:06.920]  elizabeth warren i don't trust her like her she's anti-gun in the probe and border but at least she
[02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:12.600]  says we should see the tpp treaty that's being rammed through right now for the pacific union
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:17.960]  and so i say she's better than hillary i mean i just uh all i could do is take each case like
[02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:22.200]  is a cop wrong in this case is he right in this case or you know as a citizen right here are they
[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:28.040]  wrong i mean i don't just blanketly choose one group of the other and then i look at the bigger
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:35.880]  picture uh but listen i get the gi bill and things like that the problem is when you get government
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:40.840]  control of education when isanhower warned of you get the undue influence of the military
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:45.960]  industrial complex to basically give people the scholarships and stuff because they owe fealty
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:51.080]  to the system and then they worship the government that gave them the the discounted education
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:57.880]  not the citizens that pay taxes to do it so you know how many people lose their houses because the
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:02.440]  irs claims they didn't pay enough tax when they don't make enough money to pay for it or how many
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:08.120]  people get their wages garnished with no judge or jury and then down the road oh but we're gonna
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:13.000]  you know give some poor immigrant you know free hospital let them have their baby for 30 grand and
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:20.440]  it's robbery and long term socialism works up front when you've got a big prosperous country
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:25.720]  if part of the economy's mixed socialism but it always creates special interest it always creates a
[02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:31.320]  new imperium that hands out the largesse to the different subgroups and it creates a
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:40.520]  oh what's the term where you hire your family members uh it creates a nepotism a corporatism
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:48.120]  writ large it just doesn't work go ahead but like you know oh yeah and i was going to say
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:52.440]  on top of that you know there's uh republicans capitalized on christians and in the bible it
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:55.800]  says there'll be a bunch of false prophets but you know well sure i mean the republican
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:49:02.600]  leaderships for open borders they're for obama care they're for the tpp uh the i mean they tell
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:07.800]  obama what to do i mean we know that we're not talking about john bainer we're talking about
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:16.520]  about people like governor abbott people like louis gummer people like rand paul and i know
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:20.520]  all these people i know all these people they make a big deal about in the media oh my god
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:25.480]  they know the demon the unspoken ones name alex jones the straight shooter they just hate me
[02:49:25.480 --> 02:49:32.440]  because i just straight shoot okay and and these are real men who are aware of the global takeover
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:36.040]  you can disagree with them on abortion or disagree with them on this or that they
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:42.040]  are bucking the system and no there's a planetary takeover i mean listen we can fight with each
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:50.280]  other all day about little issues they're all little compared to the eugenicist planetary
[02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:55.480]  movement financed by the rothschilds and royalty of the netherlands in england these people have
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:50:03.560]  a master plan and guess what they're carrying it out my friend so how we can all kill each other
[02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:09.080]  later if we want to but the racism and all of this stuff has got to stop at least until we
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:12.760]  defeated the globalists then we can all hate each other you know if that's so much fun do you see
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:19.800]  what i'm saying yes i see what you're saying but you know i think that i since i was a liberal i
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:24.280]  tell liberals all these other things about like nine eleven's the insight job at george soros
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:27.880]  and you know i was a college student i think that we need to really invest into the education
[02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:31.640]  though because man i'm struggling you know i see well sir sir listen i appreciate your call
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:36.200]  i gotta break your very sincere caller do you understand that our health care was the best

[03:00:28.600 --> 03:00:32.360]  here listening if you want to volunteer it but i have a problem i don't tend to read what people
[03:00:32.360 --> 03:00:37.800]  are volunteering until i look up on the screen joshua disagrees should have gone to joshua
[03:00:37.800 --> 03:00:42.760]  all back because you know i put disagreeers that have the line normally if i have time uh joshua
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:48.600]  you're on the air thank you for holding uh tell me how you disagree go ahead okay for the second
[03:00:48.600 --> 03:00:54.360]  amendment the first part of it has to do with the states basically organizing and uh training the
[03:00:54.360 --> 03:00:58.920]  militias but that's already basically been repealed because the national guard which that
[03:00:58.920 --> 03:01:03.800]  essentially was has been merged with the department of the army that's already effectively been repealed
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:08.120]  the second part of the second amendment which is the rights to keep and bear arms shall not be
[03:01:08.120 --> 03:01:15.880]  infringed basically that the right of the people to keep a bear arm shall not be infringed it's
[03:01:15.880 --> 03:01:21.720]  already infringed when the courts with the constitutional republic can then decide on the
[03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:27.160]  law that's written when they can decide whether something is being infringed or not they've
[03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:32.120]  already sure sure well there's always an argument that you know the swivers have been going on a
[03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:36.760]  long time so it's okay here's the deal do you agree with the fundamental right of a human
[03:01:36.760 --> 03:01:43.800]  or any other creature to defend itself yes so your problem your problem isn't with the second
[03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:52.920]  amendment your problem is it's not strong enough i think it the problem is the way that it is
[03:01:52.920 --> 03:01:59.240]  presented it's allowing the courts to then say well no you can't have this no you can't have that
[03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:03.320]  and that is well that's our problem because the founders were all clear it's an individual right
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:08.920]  for the security of a free people the right to keep their arms shall not be infringed so
[03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:14.600]  i mean it's not debated by people that know how to tie the shoelaces but i mean i hear what you're
[03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:19.800]  saying is that you know the old english or whatever or the quasi-old english the trends
[03:02:19.800 --> 03:02:24.920]  you know that that that that that mid-level english in between old and new english gets confusing for
[03:02:24.920 --> 03:02:28.280]  people but it's like the first amendment congress shall make no law respecting and
[03:02:28.280 --> 03:02:33.960]  establish a religion or bring a free exercise there of or the press or the people to petition
[03:02:33.960 --> 03:02:38.120]  the government free doesn't grievances it's all in there there's a militia clause there's an
[03:02:38.120 --> 03:02:43.640]  individual clause it's all there the first amendment's the better battle for the second
[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:49.640]  amendment to be honest with you and i think it has to do with the uh the free practice basically
[03:02:49.640 --> 03:02:54.840]  of religion and it goes back to the bible at the whole point of tell your tunic and buy a sword
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:58.840]  and two should be enough because basically it doesn't explicitly say this but i understand
[03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:02.920]  what it's talking about you've got two hands of course you should have two swords you should
[03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:07.960]  always be armed kind of a thing like that now the the other side of that is not that you should
[03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:12.200]  be armed so that you can go around and act like some of these crazy shooters that go and shoot
[03:03:12.200 --> 03:03:16.280]  up places well they're crazy so that doesn't affect other people that haven't done anything
[03:03:16.280 --> 03:03:20.200]  wrong it's like saying somebody kills somebody with a car drunk driving some other driver has
[03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:25.000]  to be guilty for what they've done it's asinine i gotta jump i hear your points um
[03:03:27.480 --> 03:03:32.360]  there's nothing perfect in this world the elite are coming after the guns to dominate in slavis
[03:03:32.360 --> 03:03:38.280]  it's that simple it's a fact america is getting that the world is getting that we're winning the
[03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:42.600]  info war in every metric that's why they're launching a counter offensive to shut us up

[03:03:50.760 --> 03:03:55.480]  maybe the the cyber operation aspect i've been reading some news articles where they're finding
