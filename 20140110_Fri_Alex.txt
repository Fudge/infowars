[00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.231]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:08.011]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:09.752]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:11.352]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:12.892]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.892 --> 00:00:17.094]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:21.195]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:39.355]  I woke up at about 6 a.m.
[00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:59.233]  this morning and I went and made some coffee and I got in the shower and I walked out on the back porch in my robe and it just absolutely hit me like a ton of bricks how we defeat the New World Order.
[00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:00.835]  How we turn the tide against these people.
[00:01:02.472 --> 00:01:06.414]  And it's so incredibly simple and hiding in everyone's face.
[00:01:06.414 --> 00:01:17.161]  And I made the determination to come in here this morning and to put out this basic idea.
[00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:23.585]  And it's an idea you've heard before, but it hit me how essential it is.
[00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:27.788]  And it's so simple, but so also powerful at the same time.
[00:01:29.213 --> 00:01:35.578]  That it's hard to even properly describe it.
[00:01:35.578 --> 00:01:42.464]  And so what I'm going to do is I'm just not even going to say it right now.
[00:01:42.464 --> 00:01:57.417]  Because when you're having a clear thought, there's just thousands of data points condensed into that clarion understanding.
[00:02:00.097 --> 00:02:16.683]  But then how do you communicate that and express that in a way that is simply put, but also carries the great depth of palette and bouquet?
[00:02:16.683 --> 00:02:28.227]  And then I walked in here and began going over the giant stacks of news the guys had printed off from every major news source out there, alternative and dinosaur, governmental and corporate.
[00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:32.306]  Grassroots and establishment.
[00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:48.855]  And staring down at the page I saw being said by Ted Cruz, exactly what I was going to come on air and say to you today.
[00:02:48.855 --> 00:02:50.216]  That it's here.
[00:02:50.216 --> 00:02:53.638]  We're being prepared for total martial law.
[00:02:54.773 --> 00:03:06.020]  Total surveillance, total taxation, total control, a revolution of criminality, and the only answer is to not become acclimated by it.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.305]  We're at that key point where it's emerged, it's out in the open, before it goes to the next level of open takeover.
[00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:15.166]  And this is really happening.
[00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:17.047]  It's now here.
[00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:22.210]  And we're only seeing a few prominent people tell it like it is,
[00:03:23.314 --> 00:03:31.741]  And even though it's simple and it's true, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:36.284]  And when we come back, I'll quantify what I'm getting at here, but here's the CBS News article.
[00:03:36.284 --> 00:03:38.146]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:03:38.146 --> 00:03:40.067]  It's on the right-hand side of DrugsReport.com.
[00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:42.269]  It's the easiest place to find it.
[00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.353]  Cruz calls President dangerous and terrifying.
[00:03:47.353 --> 00:03:51.176]  You see, people say, oh, don't use flowery, dark rhetoric
[00:03:52.284 --> 00:03:53.885]  Tyrannical rhetoric.
[00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:55.947]  You know, everybody does that to demonize politicians.
[00:03:55.947 --> 00:03:56.667]  No.
[00:03:56.667 --> 00:04:02.472]  When the shoe fits, when it's true, it's true.
[00:04:02.472 --> 00:04:09.478]  And we've all, even myself, gotten comfortable living in the beginnings of serious tyranny.
[00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:12.160]  And we need to struggle and freak out.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.461]  And we need to call the President out.
[00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:15.382]  And let me just tell you something.
[00:04:15.382 --> 00:04:18.345]  This is the type of stuff they blow your airplane up over?
[00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:21.207]  When you're a leader and well-spoken and intellectual?
[00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:26.777]  The establishment, I can guarantee you, is scared of Ted Cruz.
[00:04:26.777 --> 00:04:33.483]  Even if they think he's part of the establishment, he's gonna double-cross libertarians down the road, and I have no proof of that happening.
[00:04:33.483 --> 00:04:37.586]  But, you know, you can't put your faith in man.
[00:04:37.586 --> 00:04:38.707]  Gotta put it in God.
[00:04:38.707 --> 00:04:45.213]  The point is, just the way he's challenging them is the way another rival group would take over from this elite.
[00:04:45.213 --> 00:04:47.775]  I mean, this is leadership right here.
[00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:50.237]  This is how you talk to bring down tyrants.
[00:04:50.237 --> 00:04:51.178]  This is the answer.
[00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:54.236]  Telling it like it is.
[00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:56.142]  Getting hardcore serious.
[00:04:56.142 --> 00:04:56.784]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.921]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:05.583]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.

[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.943]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:06:02.943 --> 00:06:07.967]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:15.133]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:06:15.253 --> 00:06:20.898]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:06:20.898 --> 00:06:24.921]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:29.645]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:34.869]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:06:35.109 --> 00:06:38.350]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Scalzin.
[00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.851]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.

[00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:48.494]  Hand cranked shortwave AM FM radios.

[00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:17.164]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:17.164 --> 00:07:21.826]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:07:35.994 --> 00:07:43.038]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:07:43.038 --> 00:07:47.381]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:07:57.186 --> 00:08:08.411]  Available at Infowarslife.com Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:08.411 --> 00:08:09.991]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:08:33.584 --> 00:08:42.229]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday.
[00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:51.394]  Already, it's hard to believe, already the 10th day of January 2014.
[00:08:51.394 --> 00:08:56.877]  I am your host Alex Jones and we're going to be here, Lord willing, live for the next three hours.
[00:08:56.877 --> 00:09:00.619]  And then I will return this Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:02.540]  Central Standard Time.
[00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:08.989]  for the Sunday abbreviated News Update Transmission.
[00:09:08.989 --> 00:09:18.712]  We have the Infowars Nightly News, five nights a week, seven o'clock central at InfowarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:18.712 --> 00:09:26.955]  Okay, we have obviously an incredible amount of news on the economy, on the NSA, on surveillance, on
[00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:37.397]  What's happening with the military, Governor Christie, so much is going on, and we will cover it all today.
[00:09:37.397 --> 00:09:44.322]  And we have two guests, including one of my favorite guests in studio, Dr. Group.
[00:09:44.322 --> 00:09:56.632]  And then we have a constitutional lawyer popping in in the third hour, and Jakari Jackson and crew have got a lot of radiation findings, a lot of the news good, some of it bad, in Northern California into Oregon.
[00:09:57.947 --> 00:10:03.611]  The good news is most of Oregon and California does not have higher levels of radiation.
[00:10:03.611 --> 00:10:15.940]  The bad news is, and we've talked to physicists and others, the levels that are 1,000 times, 1,400 times higher than what is safe in the background
[00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:18.212]  Is
[00:10:38.925 --> 00:10:42.326]  Halfway whitewashes what's going on, but does state some of the facts.
[00:10:42.326 --> 00:10:48.029]  It's a pretty good article out of Dinosaur Media from Half Moon Bay, where we did find the highest readings.
[00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:49.909]  We found a thousand times.
[00:10:49.909 --> 00:10:51.710]  Others found 1,400 times.
[00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:56.392]  And the County Health Department confirmed 500 times where they went and looked.
[00:10:56.392 --> 00:11:00.133]  And we have four different professional Geiger counters, and you can read the settings.
[00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:05.415]  And we've had radiologists and physicists and nuclear cleanup specialists look at our videos, look at it.
[00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.356]  They say, no, that's all
[00:11:07.136 --> 00:11:09.757]  That's all just dead on, like reading a clock.
[00:11:09.757 --> 00:11:11.338]  That's what's going on there.
[00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:23.083]  And that just 30 years ago or 25 years ago, they would tell folks, don't be anywhere around that period in case you ingest any of where that radiation is coming from.
[00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:24.863]  It's one thing to have the background.
[00:11:24.863 --> 00:11:27.224]  That's a thousand times what it should be.
[00:11:27.224 --> 00:11:31.286]  And your body can handle it unless you sat there by it for a year.
[00:11:31.286 --> 00:11:33.027]  But if you ingest any of that,
[00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:41.858]  Then it goes into the tissues and just sits there at point-blank range, radiating your body, even at a low level, and you get cancer.
[00:11:41.858 --> 00:11:43.179]  And that's just a fact.
[00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:53.388]  That's why DU, even though it's low-level radiation, is highly toxic, and at point-blank range, goes into the cells, and you're toast.
[00:11:53.388 --> 00:11:58.713]  And our troops are breathing this stuff that's a death sentence, and they knew that when they authorized it.
[00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:03.970]  And the reason this radiation story is so big is it's not even about the radiation.
[00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.892]  That's secondary.
[00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:17.523]  It's that it's weird, according to the mainstream media and radio talk show hosts out in California and others that have been critical of us, to want to go and investigate and look.
[00:12:17.523 --> 00:12:18.585]  Investigation
[00:12:20.103 --> 00:12:21.284]  Is a bad thing.
[00:12:21.284 --> 00:12:36.210]  Being informed is like having leprosy or something with yuppies and establishment trendies who really just want to think everything's fine when all the metrics, all the gauges, all the indicators show things are not fine.
[00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:40.151]  If we're on the deck of the Titanic, it's listing over about to basically break in two.
[00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:41.212]  I don't want that to happen.
[00:12:41.212 --> 00:12:42.752]  I live here.
[00:12:42.752 --> 00:12:43.653]  My family lives here.
[00:12:43.653 --> 00:12:44.413]  Your family lives here.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:51.024]  I don't want there to be a stock market crash even though it's valued, many of the top companies, 100 to 1 price earnings ratio.
[00:12:51.024 --> 00:12:52.645]  It was 25, 30 to 1 in 1929 in the big crash.
[00:12:58.547 --> 00:13:07.795]  I mean, this is like a big rotten heart that's had 20 heart attacks, and half the heart's dead, and it's got 20 stents in it, and the guy's taking Viagra and snorting cocaine.
[00:13:07.795 --> 00:13:09.416]  I mean, is that a good idea?
[00:13:09.416 --> 00:13:11.738]  That heart is gonna blow wide open.
[00:13:11.738 --> 00:13:13.499]  That's what hearts do when they're all rotten.
[00:13:13.499 --> 00:13:17.603]  They just blow in different directions, and you die instantly.
[00:13:17.603 --> 00:13:20.385]  And that's what all the armored vehicles and the riot training is for.
[00:13:20.385 --> 00:13:21.886]  They admit it.
[00:13:21.886 --> 00:13:25.109]  But it's not like they did all this to counter something that was an accident.
[00:13:26.206 --> 00:13:39.707]  This was all engineered, it's been done in other countries over and over again, and it's going to end this country as we know it, and Homeland Security is meant to absorb the nation as it collapses into this dark tyranny.
[00:13:39.707 --> 00:13:40.949]  That is called Agenda 21.
[00:13:45.529 --> 00:13:47.610]  Designed to impoverish this nation.
[00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:52.272]  Designed to break the back of rural communities especially and farmers.
[00:13:52.272 --> 00:13:54.653]  Designed to make us dependent on the system.
[00:13:54.653 --> 00:13:57.915]  Designed to totally domesticate us.
[00:13:57.915 --> 00:14:12.222]  We are truly going into the nastiest, most scientific, most control freak, autocratic, authoritarian oppression the world has ever seen.
[00:14:12.222 --> 00:14:14.503]  This is certified
[00:14:15.845 --> 00:14:20.086]  Certified cultural death.
[00:14:20.086 --> 00:14:21.007]  Political death.
[00:14:21.007 --> 00:14:29.009]  This is certified 24 karat evil.
[00:14:29.009 --> 00:14:29.589]  24 karats.
[00:14:29.589 --> 00:14:31.130]  Pure gold, folks.
[00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:32.950]  This is pure tyranny.
[00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.131]  If you judge it on that scale, it is 24 karat pure.
[00:14:35.131 --> 00:14:35.271]  Pure.
[00:14:40.493 --> 00:14:52.299]  And that is the one thing you cannot admire, but at least marvel at, is the people at the top of this are committed and consciously premeditatedly doing this.
[00:14:52.299 --> 00:15:02.325]  Now they use all the nihilists and the mercenaries and the psychos and the pervs and the control freaks and the people that have got scores to settle and the mentally ill leftists
[00:15:03.353 --> 00:15:11.596]  We're really just authoritarian control freaks calling themselves the establishment, calling themselves the answer, calling themselves the high ground, calling themselves the authority.
[00:15:11.596 --> 00:15:20.759]  That's why they always lecture down as if they're the boss, and most people respond to it as if they're the boss and have the moral authority.
[00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:28.422]  When they are part of a locust swarm, historically, that takes over civilizations.
[00:15:28.422 --> 00:15:32.203]  Now, all of that said, I want to talk about
[00:15:34.454 --> 00:15:48.583]  A really strong realization that I had this morning at about 630 looking out into the fog over the Texas Hill Country.
[00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:52.625]  And it was this.
[00:15:52.625 --> 00:16:01.971]  Though the landscape was shrouded in fog, my mind was completely clear that we can beat these people.
[00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:02.752]  And the answer
[00:16:04.349 --> 00:16:29.200]  To defeating them is withdrawing our political, cultural, economic consent at every level we can, and criticizing the system, exposing the system as alien, fraudulent, anti-liberty, exposing that the system is the author of our present collapsing system, that they are to blame.
[00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:40.700]  And when you're faced with real tyranny, and when you're faced historically with something so premeditatedly evil, it's hard to believe you're living in that historical time.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:47.142]  But that's what happens over and over again, is people respond like deer in the headlights.
[00:16:47.142 --> 00:16:49.062]  I've studied history deeply.
[00:16:49.062 --> 00:16:53.323]  And if you respond like a deer in the headlights, even though now you know the car's oncoming,
[00:16:54.266 --> 00:17:02.070]  You know the tyranny's real, the NSA spying, the open borders, the plan to shut the country down to bankrupt everybody for control, the globalism, all of it.
[00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:08.733]  The plan to take over families, put us in 200 square foot coffin apartments with total taxation, total surveillance.
[00:17:08.733 --> 00:17:16.757]  You know, I saw the car as it rounded a mountain 20 miles away and I said, that's tyranny coming historically.
[00:17:16.757 --> 00:17:19.958]  And then a lot of people woke up as the car came down the road a mile away.
[00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:23.280]  And then now the car's 200 yards away going about 80 miles an hour.
[00:17:24.437 --> 00:17:43.414]  And we're standing here in the middle of the road and it's going to hit us unless we simply recognize it's happening and step out of the road and let the tyranny basically pass.
[00:17:43.414 --> 00:17:45.435]  All we've got to do is withdraw our consent.
[00:17:45.435 --> 00:17:46.336]  It's that easy.
[00:17:46.336 --> 00:17:49.279]  We step aside, the car basically disappears.
[00:17:50.461 --> 00:17:53.282]  We don't give it support, moral support, any of it.
[00:17:53.282 --> 00:18:04.685]  We realize that it's a fraud and that we've been under literally a political spell of high-tech mind control and you break that spell in yourself and in others.
[00:18:04.685 --> 00:18:09.847]  Even if you're awake to what's happening, you've got to realize that you
[00:18:11.698 --> 00:18:28.263]  ...are a leader, and that you can affect change, and that simply criticizing the system, and supporting alternative systems, and withdrawing your consent, and speaking out against the system, and declaring it the enemy, declaring it the fraud, declaring it the criminal institution it is, will defeat it.
[00:18:28.263 --> 00:18:29.663]  It will take its authority away.
[00:18:30.942 --> 00:18:36.165]  It will show it to be the fraud it is, no matter how many guns and bullets and how much surveillance it's got.
[00:18:36.165 --> 00:18:39.727]  The people will see the emperor is butt naked and wearing no clothes.
[00:18:39.727 --> 00:18:42.209]  We're going to skip this network break because this is so important what I'm about to say.
[00:18:44.483 --> 00:18:45.743]  And it hit me this morning.
[00:18:45.743 --> 00:18:57.447]  We've got to call out Obama and the entire system as gangster thug certified criminals who have conned the public and been caught and discredited because the polls show that.
[00:18:57.447 --> 00:19:04.669]  And we have to declare victory and declare them impeached by the public in the court of public opinion.
[00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:20.069]  And we have to go after corrupt officials in counties, cities, states, you name it, when the system has been trying to bully us and intimidate us and dominate us and break our will like a pimp breaks a woman's will that he's turning into a sex slave.
[00:19:20.069 --> 00:19:21.810]  They have tried to break our will.
[00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.992]  We have to find our fighting spirit again and understand resistance is victory.
[00:19:27.705 --> 00:19:35.470]  And you tend to not want to call it out as evil as it is because you don't want to alarm people, or you don't want them to disagree with you, or you don't want to stand out.
[00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.712]  But once you start standing out, it's going to feel good.
[00:19:38.712 --> 00:19:40.633]  You're going to know you're turning the tide.
[00:19:40.633 --> 00:19:47.517]  You're going to know that no matter what comes, you're now in forward motion, engaging the enemy that's attacking us.
[00:19:47.517 --> 00:19:52.360]  We are defensive, but we're already under attack, so that is an offensive move.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.843]  We didn't draw first blood, or the billionth blood, and we're not going to draw physical blood.
[00:19:57.583 --> 00:20:00.985]  But we're moving towards the point where they're going to lose politically.
[00:20:00.985 --> 00:20:06.308]  They're going to come in with physical force, ladies and gentlemen, and persecution.
[00:20:06.308 --> 00:20:09.050]  They've already been doing it with the IRS and the FBI.
[00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:15.134]  The FBI has announced they're not going to do white-collar fraud anymore because the government runs that.
[00:20:15.134 --> 00:20:20.517]  They're going to go after political people as a new commissariat.
[00:20:20.517 --> 00:20:23.259]  As commissars.
[00:20:23.259 --> 00:20:26.341]  This is historical what's happening.
[00:20:27.714 --> 00:20:32.697]  And it's vital that people in the government across the board do not comply.
[00:20:32.697 --> 00:20:34.419]  Drag your feet.
[00:20:34.419 --> 00:20:35.860]  Leak information.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:43.284]  You don't have to even be a hero and say no and get fired or leave like one of the top Secret Service agents, Bongino.
[00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:48.188]  But look how he left, exposed the system, and now he's running for Congress to get in and fight it.
[00:20:48.188 --> 00:20:49.449]  I can tell you that's a genuine real guy.
[00:20:50.188 --> 00:21:06.058]  That's what we need, and we need school teachers and auto mechanics and cattle folks and shopkeepers and folks that own car repair shops, everybody, police officers, you name it.
[00:21:06.058 --> 00:21:07.539]  We're all in this together.
[00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:11.341]  We have to clearly state the choice of historical tyranny and bondage.
[00:21:12.844 --> 00:21:20.852]  That the television and the movies and the sitcoms push as acceptable the system's trying to acclimate this revolution against basic freedom.
[00:21:20.852 --> 00:21:22.194]  They're the revolutionaries.
[00:21:22.194 --> 00:21:23.675]  They're the attackers.
[00:21:23.675 --> 00:21:24.976]  They are the radicals.
[00:21:24.976 --> 00:21:32.724]  We have to realize that and have absolute courage and stand up against it and we can defeat them.
[00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:35.047]  Now to quantify it, we have to call the criminals out.
[00:21:36.189 --> 00:21:37.230]  We have to get aggressive.
[00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:42.898]  You have to go to every public event you can when Congress people come to speak and shout them down.
[00:21:42.898 --> 00:21:45.923]  And others will join you when you take the step of leadership.
[00:21:45.923 --> 00:21:47.485]  You have to go to every city council meeting.
[00:21:48.917 --> 00:21:57.143]  Every week, you know, forget going to the bar, forget going to the baseball game, forget going and having your glitterbug preacher tell you give him money or whatever on Wednesday night.
[00:21:57.143 --> 00:22:01.806]  Get down to the city council meeting and bring up citizens communication, whatever topics you want.
[00:22:01.806 --> 00:22:06.289]  Get the buzz intensifying all over grassroots.
[00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:07.469]  We have the majority.
[00:22:07.469 --> 00:22:09.811]  We have to let the majority know we are the majority.
[00:22:09.811 --> 00:22:18.357]  The last domino to fall is that those of us that love liberty are loners or are by ourselves or small numbers.
[00:22:19.417 --> 00:22:22.299]  Congress has a 6% approval rating, the lowest in history.
[00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:28.844]  I've never known of a dictatorship that had less support than that.
[00:22:28.844 --> 00:22:40.092]  Obama, even though it's a cult of personality where you buy into the brand, has like a 30% approval rating with only the most dependent type people that think in a cultish way.
[00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:46.997]  This system is absolutely weak and it's alien and it wants to destroy our prosperity in America.
[00:22:47.876 --> 00:22:57.762]  To bring the system down, you've got to bring the false system that's been projected over our republic and that is parasitically draining it.
[00:22:57.762 --> 00:22:59.703]  We want to restore the republic.
[00:22:59.703 --> 00:23:10.689]  We want to remove the false state, Homeland Security, NORTHCOM, that has integrated itself in, like the Vichy French Nazi occupying government, over France.
[00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:14.531]  We need to identify it's an occupying collaborator government, literally.
[00:23:15.091 --> 00:23:16.673]  That's not, that's not rhetoric.
[00:23:16.673 --> 00:23:24.081]  We have a literal, corporate, globalist, eugenicist, technocratic, scientific takeover in their own words.
[00:23:24.081 --> 00:23:25.823]  They all brag about it, think you're dumb.
[00:23:25.823 --> 00:23:31.128]  The enemy criminals always brag on their power trips to each other and books and white papers and C-SPAN.
[00:23:31.989 --> 00:23:35.732]  I'm telling you 100% their certified game plan is public.
[00:23:35.732 --> 00:23:36.993]  You're not hearing my opinion.
[00:23:36.993 --> 00:23:41.276]  That's why everything we told you about continues to come true in different permutations.
[00:23:41.276 --> 00:23:44.678]  We don't know exactly how it's going to unfold, but we know their goal.
[00:23:44.678 --> 00:23:45.599]  We know history.
[00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:46.720]  We know how things work.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.061]  We know how they never quit.
[00:23:48.061 --> 00:23:49.302]  They only regroup.
[00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:51.263]  Well, we don't ever quit.
[00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:52.684]  And we always regroup.
[00:23:52.684 --> 00:23:53.565]  We adapt.
[00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:54.565]  We improvise.
[00:23:54.565 --> 00:23:55.646]  We overcome.
[00:23:55.646 --> 00:23:57.688]  Because that's the animating contest of liberty.
[00:23:57.688 --> 00:23:58.849]  That's what it is to be alive.
[00:23:58.849 --> 00:24:00.250]  It's not work to fight tyranny.
[00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:01.831]  It's like breathing!
[00:24:01.831 --> 00:24:05.154]  You're going to quit breathing because it's so much work?
[00:24:05.154 --> 00:24:08.017]  No, it's part of living.
[00:24:08.017 --> 00:24:09.539]  So we've all got to up our game.
[00:24:09.539 --> 00:24:11.161]  We've all got to take it up another notch.
[00:24:11.161 --> 00:24:14.264]  That's how we're going to beat them.
[00:24:14.264 --> 00:24:19.069]  And I said to myself at about 630, I said, I'm going to come in and call for Obama to be arrested.
[00:24:20.071 --> 00:24:22.454]  I'm going to call for Christy to be arrested.
[00:24:22.454 --> 00:24:23.816]  He's been caught lying.
[00:24:23.816 --> 00:24:25.178]  Of course he ordered this.
[00:24:25.178 --> 00:24:27.281]  He got caught lying about who knew earlier.
[00:24:27.281 --> 00:24:34.191]  Claims he has thousands of employees so you never know when it's his number one henchman, his underling, his head of his staff.
[00:24:35.342 --> 00:24:37.523]  And stuff like this is what can bring things down.
[00:24:37.523 --> 00:24:39.443]  Something simple the public can get.
[00:24:39.443 --> 00:24:40.464]  Shutting a road down.
[00:24:40.464 --> 00:24:45.345]  When people already gotta pay 15-something dollars to go across it on a toll road both ways.
[00:24:45.345 --> 00:24:49.667]  Being shut down to pick their kids up, live their lives, is some political war.
[00:24:49.667 --> 00:24:51.307]  This is why they want control.
[00:24:51.307 --> 00:24:54.308]  No normal person would think to do something like that.
[00:24:54.308 --> 00:24:56.169]  Inconveniencing hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:24:56.989 --> 00:24:57.930]  For hours?
[00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.753]  Causing giant economic warfare terrorism?
[00:25:01.753 --> 00:25:02.954]  This is terrorism!
[00:25:02.954 --> 00:25:05.916]  But this is nothing compared to the real terrorism they engage in.
[00:25:05.916 --> 00:25:08.538]  Releasing the deadly flu bugs on record, getting caught.
[00:25:08.538 --> 00:25:10.819]  Putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, getting caught.
[00:25:10.819 --> 00:25:12.020]  Think I'm just saying that?
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:12.461]  Look it up!
[00:25:13.322 --> 00:25:15.524]  These people are murderers!
[00:25:15.524 --> 00:25:25.355]  Bayer Pharmaceuticals, knowingly for 11 years, had HIV and Hepatitis and all their hemophiliac drug, Factor VIII, and knowingly shipped it out.
[00:25:25.355 --> 00:25:27.598]  And it was above just wanting the profit.
[00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:30.881]  A death sentence to every person that got it.
[00:25:30.881 --> 00:25:34.724]  Hundreds of thousands died in the last 20 years from this.
[00:25:34.724 --> 00:25:37.286]  This broke 10 years ago, went back 11 years before that.
[00:25:37.286 --> 00:25:38.708]  Bill Clinton was involved.
[00:25:38.708 --> 00:25:40.209]  The Canadian government was involved.
[00:25:40.209 --> 00:25:45.253]  They firebombed doctors' offices and robbed the Hemophiliac Society the same night in the U.S.
[00:25:45.253 --> 00:25:48.356]  and Canada when all this came out.
[00:25:48.356 --> 00:25:50.798]  Do you understand that?
[00:25:50.798 --> 00:25:51.679]  Do you understand that?
[00:25:51.679 --> 00:25:53.640]  Do you understand that?
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.302]  Do you understand who these people are?
[00:25:56.365 --> 00:26:00.847]  They don't just not care about you, they like hurting people.
[00:26:00.847 --> 00:26:04.228]  They're bad, bad people.
[00:26:04.228 --> 00:26:07.469]  And you don't get into their clubs unless you're a sick crook.
[00:26:07.469 --> 00:26:12.471]  You can look at Bill Clinton, look at Obama, look at Chris Christie, look at those people.
[00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:14.731]  They are evil.
[00:26:14.731 --> 00:26:18.973]  You can look at Rand Paul and also look at his fruits, he's real.
[00:26:18.973 --> 00:26:21.854]  Will he get intimidated, threatened, bent sometimes?
[00:26:21.854 --> 00:26:22.294]  I'm sure.
[00:26:24.226 --> 00:26:29.029]  Confucius said that if the grass bends, but it comes right back.
[00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:31.350]  The difference is he's not consciously evil.
[00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:38.635]  And if it wasn't for Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and us and the Drudge Report and the real media, they would have passed their gun bans.
[00:26:38.635 --> 00:26:41.997]  They would have gotten it rammed through.
[00:26:41.997 --> 00:26:43.498]  They would have gotten everything else they're doing.
[00:26:43.498 --> 00:26:46.160]  Now they're doing it by executive order and by executive action.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.101]  So we call them out as dictators.
[00:26:48.101 --> 00:26:50.462]  We call them out as the frauds they are.
[00:26:50.462 --> 00:26:51.583]  We tell it like it is.
[00:26:51.583 --> 00:26:52.724]  And that's the simple action.
[00:26:54.079 --> 00:27:08.709]  It hit me at 6.30 this morning that we've got to come out and call them dangerous, would-be dictators who are overthrowing the country and who are occupiers and who are collaborators with foreign corporate interests.
[00:27:08.709 --> 00:27:15.074]  And then I walked in here and AP reports Cruz calls President dangerous and terrifying.
[00:27:15.074 --> 00:27:20.237]  And the media is going to try to punish him, but all that does is make him more popular.
[00:27:20.237 --> 00:27:22.559]  Cruz calls President dangerous and terrifying.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.481]  And it's true.
[00:27:26.481 --> 00:27:29.922]  We have to have leadership that will call it like it is.
[00:27:29.922 --> 00:27:33.183]  Let me tell you something.
[00:27:33.183 --> 00:27:42.787]  You have to have no dirt on you, and you've got to have huevos, the size of watermelons, to do that in his leadership role from a credible position.
[00:27:42.787 --> 00:27:45.168]  This is the kind of person they fear, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:45.168 --> 00:27:49.170]  Ted Cruz, look at him.
[00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:52.431]  Coming out at his level, it's one thing to be Alex Jones and talk like this.
[00:27:53.459 --> 00:27:56.740]  And it's another thing to be a news reporter and say things like that.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.680]  They'll come after you.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.201]  But when you start talking like that, that's what can bring them down.
[00:28:02.201 --> 00:28:04.381]  That's what scares them right there.
[00:28:04.381 --> 00:28:05.401]  We need mayors.
[00:28:05.401 --> 00:28:06.961]  We need police chiefs.
[00:28:06.961 --> 00:28:10.242]  We need grand jury heads.
[00:28:10.242 --> 00:28:15.943]  We need people that are in leadership positions, preachers that are listening right now, who are afraid to lose their 501c3.
[00:28:15.943 --> 00:28:18.163]  You don't need a 501c3, idiot.
[00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:19.204]  You have the First Amendment.
[00:28:19.204 --> 00:28:20.564]  You're not a government institution.
[00:28:21.414 --> 00:28:26.638]  We need you to stop sitting there claiming you're just trying to save souls all day.
[00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:30.842]  You're gonna save souls by exposing the huge demonic system around people.
[00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:36.867]  Not sitting up there acting authoritative and acting like a father figure to your so-called flock.
[00:28:36.867 --> 00:28:40.410]  You preachers need to speak out against what's going on.
[00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:48.337]  We need men and women who have hearts that love goodness to call the system out
[00:28:49.246 --> 00:28:51.229]  To tell it like it is now.
[00:28:51.229 --> 00:28:53.492]  And that's really the epiphany.
[00:28:53.492 --> 00:29:01.063]  And it's really the same thing I say every day, but it just hit me so hard, because I get really upset and not even so much down, but just distraught.
[00:29:02.834 --> 00:29:05.455]  Over how real this is.
[00:29:05.455 --> 00:29:07.796]  And if we could just wake people up to see it and understand it.
[00:29:07.796 --> 00:29:09.677]  The truth is the public is awake.
[00:29:09.677 --> 00:29:14.979]  Everything we talked about, the NSA, the checkpoints, the spying, the secret police, the death squads.
[00:29:14.979 --> 00:29:21.222]  They're trying to set all that up, but they can't admit it exists because then there'll be a debate about what they've set up.
[00:29:21.222 --> 00:29:23.403]  We forced them now to debate all this.
[00:29:23.403 --> 00:29:25.043]  We're forcing them into the light.
[00:29:25.043 --> 00:29:26.344]  We're identifying them.
[00:29:27.708 --> 00:29:31.309]  We're tracking them like fighter pilots locking on target.
[00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:33.350]  We're now locked on.
[00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:41.332]  And now we've just got to pull the trigger, punch the button, fire away, and take down the enemy.
[00:29:41.332 --> 00:29:42.913]  Politically.
[00:29:42.913 --> 00:29:46.774]  Good people have to take action and stand up and speak out.
[00:29:46.774 --> 00:29:49.295]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.295 --> 00:29:50.695]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.695 --> 00:29:53.216]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.216 --> 00:29:55.917]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.247 --> 00:30:10.931]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:30:10.931 --> 00:30:12.992]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:30:12.992 --> 00:30:13.893]  Fluoride.
[00:30:13.893 --> 00:30:15.813]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:22.116]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:30:22.376 --> 00:30:27.301]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:30:27.301 --> 00:30:33.627]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:30:33.627 --> 00:30:36.049]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:38.972]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:30:38.972 --> 00:30:42.355]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:30:42.475 --> 00:30:47.537]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:47.537 --> 00:30:53.000]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[00:31:00.203 --> 00:31:04.927]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:31:04.927 --> 00:31:08.049]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:31:08.049 --> 00:31:13.613]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:31:13.613 --> 00:31:15.554]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:31:15.554 --> 00:31:17.176]  We are what we eat.
[00:31:17.176 --> 00:31:21.859]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:31:21.859 --> 00:31:26.082]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:31:26.082 --> 00:31:28.344]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:31:28.624 --> 00:31:34.852]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.141]  The facts are in.
[00:32:01.141 --> 00:32:02.561]  The studies are legion.
[00:32:02.561 --> 00:32:10.065]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:32:10.065 --> 00:32:13.887]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:32:13.887 --> 00:32:14.467]  Simple.
[00:32:14.467 --> 00:32:19.189]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:32:19.189 --> 00:32:22.411]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[00:32:22.591 --> 00:32:24.894]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:32:24.894 --> 00:32:30.441]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[00:32:30.441 --> 00:32:40.915]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:32:41.215 --> 00:32:45.800]  Let's take a stand against the Globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.963]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[00:32:57.935 --> 00:32:59.216]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:10.273 --> 00:33:12.414]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:12.414 --> 00:33:23.776]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:23.776 --> 00:33:28.658]  So there's three keys to victory.
[00:33:28.658 --> 00:33:29.998]  Getting your heart right with God.
[00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.291]  Deciding which side you're on.
[00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:35.473]  Because there is good and evil in this world.
[00:33:35.473 --> 00:33:42.317]  Whether you believe in a spiritual realm or not, there is the physical manifestation of things that we know are bad.
[00:33:42.317 --> 00:33:44.879]  Starving children.
[00:33:44.879 --> 00:33:45.900]  Poverty.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:46.600]  Lies.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.200]  Fraud.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.882]  Systems based on coercion, not on free will.
[00:33:49.882 --> 00:33:51.944]  We need to decide.
[00:33:51.944 --> 00:33:53.625]  Especially people that work in the system.
[00:33:54.417 --> 00:33:56.518]  We're not indicting you for being part of the system.
[00:33:56.518 --> 00:33:57.858]  This happened incrementally.
[00:33:57.858 --> 00:34:01.059]  We're all part of the system at one level or another.
[00:34:01.059 --> 00:34:07.641]  But now you've got to make a decision about what you're going to do and where you're going to stand.
[00:34:07.641 --> 00:34:14.043]  Because going along with the system will not keep things going because this is a system designed to implode.
[00:34:14.043 --> 00:34:20.685]  A system designed to be more oppressive and destructive over time, not a better society.
[00:34:20.685 --> 00:34:21.626]  And that's exactly
[00:34:24.588 --> 00:34:39.175]  What O'Brien in 1984, as he's finally breaking him after months in a torture dungeon, explains to him, he says, Winston, we're not building a society that's gonna be better and that goes to the stars.
[00:34:39.175 --> 00:34:43.096]  We're building a society that tramples and where you're trampled upon.
[00:34:43.096 --> 00:34:44.697]  Will you guys print me the text?
[00:34:44.697 --> 00:34:47.338]  It's, 1984 is online everywhere.
[00:34:47.338 --> 00:34:50.980]  Just type in O'Brien, trampling and being trampled on.
[00:34:53.717 --> 00:34:56.399]  And then that'll pull up the paragraphs.
[00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:58.921]  Trampling and being trampled on.
[00:34:58.921 --> 00:35:04.426]  Because... Winston was ready to sell out immediately being tortured.
[00:35:04.426 --> 00:35:05.867]  Within a day, and he said, no, no, no.
[00:35:05.867 --> 00:35:09.510]  We're going to break your mind where you don't even know who you are anymore.
[00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:13.873]  And then we're going to put you back together again.
[00:35:13.873 --> 00:35:17.316]  Believing, whatever we tell you, that there's no gravity or there is gravity.
[00:35:17.316 --> 00:35:19.038]  That 2 plus 2 equals 7, or it equals 4, or it equals 18.
[00:35:22.642 --> 00:35:41.568]  We're going to make you delusional like we are, and then we're going to let you go drink synthetic gin for a few months, and then we're going to come and shoot you in the back of the head, and throw you into a furnace, and your ashes will be dumped out into the atmosphere, and you will have never have existed.
[00:35:41.568 --> 00:35:50.911]  That was written by a MI6 high-level psych warfare technician, George Arwell, Eric Blair.
[00:35:52.185 --> 00:36:04.253]  And when you read that book, it is literally like the book O'Brien gives Winston when he's making him think that he's recruiting him into a secret liberty society.
[00:36:04.253 --> 00:36:20.363]  That book, 1984, is actually the Stalinistic Ingsoc program of Stalinistic systems integrated with English socialism to destroy the family, destroy words, and reduce people down to animals that grunt.
[00:36:22.745 --> 00:36:30.072]  Who served the state.
[00:36:30.072 --> 00:36:32.875]  This is their actual plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:32.875 --> 00:36:39.942]  So, number one, number one, you have to understand you have to make a choice.
[00:36:39.942 --> 00:36:40.883]  You have to make a choice.
[00:36:40.883 --> 00:36:44.026]  And a lot of you are scared of this system, and you should be.
[00:36:44.026 --> 00:36:46.028]  But you should be scared of not fighting back.
[00:36:48.786 --> 00:36:51.448]  We can stop this.
[00:36:51.448 --> 00:36:58.815]  We can get a reprieve like none of us, but we're going to have to really admit we're in deep you-know-what.
[00:36:58.815 --> 00:37:01.097]  We're going to have to really get real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:02.278 --> 00:37:04.179]  A lot of people around us aren't going to be able to handle this.
[00:37:04.179 --> 00:37:06.420]  A lot of people are cracking up out there.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.881]  The numbers are there.
[00:37:07.881 --> 00:37:09.442]  Record suicide across the country.
[00:37:09.442 --> 00:37:10.762]  Not just in the military.
[00:37:10.762 --> 00:37:13.764]  Because the system's a fraud and people know that.
[00:37:13.764 --> 00:37:15.224]  And they can't deal with it.
[00:37:15.224 --> 00:37:19.006]  Well, I don't give the military people permission to kill themselves.
[00:37:19.006 --> 00:37:20.627]  And God doesn't want you to either.
[00:37:20.627 --> 00:37:27.891]  You should dedicate your life to helping others and to standing against the tyranny and to stopping abortions
[00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:30.710]  That's what you're going to do.
[00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:41.014]  You don't get the easy way out because you're depressed and know that you were part of a fraud or a lie or you're sick now because they put binary weapons into your bloodstream.
[00:37:41.014 --> 00:37:42.294]  You're going to have to fight.
[00:37:42.294 --> 00:37:46.455]  That's where you're going to find the answer to this and find your salvation.
[00:37:46.455 --> 00:37:55.338]  And that's what I say to the police and the bureaucrats and the technicians and the advertisement people and all the brains out there and all the muscle and all of it.
[00:37:55.338 --> 00:37:57.099]  We don't want to go down this road.
[00:37:57.099 --> 00:37:58.039]  Your gut knows that.
[00:37:59.858 --> 00:38:07.986]  If you've got any good left in you out there, in any consciousness, you know we're in red-level crisis.
[00:38:07.986 --> 00:38:10.829]  And it's only gonna get more insane.
[00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:14.833]  And as for me, I'm not turning tail, I'm not running, I'm going head-on into this 110%.
[00:38:14.833 --> 00:38:15.494]  So number one.
[00:38:23.064 --> 00:38:27.526]  Admit we're facing evil, pure synthesized evil, because that's how it works.
[00:38:27.526 --> 00:38:36.629]  It's a survival of the fittest, social Darwinism of psychopaths and other forms of criminality under them.
[00:38:36.629 --> 00:38:43.872]  A literal legion of doom that competes with itself so it synthesizes the most nasty traits.
[00:38:46.371 --> 00:38:52.253]  We have to stand against that at every level and have faith and have a will to resist.
[00:38:52.253 --> 00:38:57.055]  You have to set your will against the enemy.
[00:38:57.055 --> 00:39:00.277]  You have to set your will against them.
[00:39:00.277 --> 00:39:05.499]  You have to make the decision that you're not going to lose the arm wrestling match.
[00:39:05.499 --> 00:39:09.960]  You've got to make the decision that you're going to raise your kids right and be a good person.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.241]  You've got to make the decision
[00:39:12.674 --> 00:39:15.177]  That you're going to bench press 400 pounds.
[00:39:15.177 --> 00:39:18.221]  You've got to make the decision you're going to work hard and make the right decisions.
[00:39:18.221 --> 00:39:20.003]  And it doesn't mean any of us are perfect.
[00:39:20.003 --> 00:39:24.468]  You have to make the decision to get up out of bed in the morning.
[00:39:24.468 --> 00:39:25.550]  We have to make the decision.
[00:39:26.837 --> 00:39:31.103]  That we got poison in our stomach, we ate bad food, we gotta vomit the New World Order out.
[00:39:31.103 --> 00:39:34.788]  We gotta stick our fingers down our throats and get this poison out of us.
[00:39:34.788 --> 00:39:37.432]  We've gotta make the decision we wanted out.
[00:39:37.432 --> 00:39:41.978]  And then that decision, from that free will, everything else flows.
[00:39:41.978 --> 00:39:42.980]  So you gotta make the decision.
[00:39:44.909 --> 00:40:10.977]  You gotta decide which side you're on, and then you've got to call out the enemy, and say, I set myself against you, and then speak out, and discredit them, and then physically begin withdrawing your consent, and it won't be at every level, it won't be in every way, it won't be perfect, but the thought, the intention, to remove your support at every level, and to challenge the system, and to fight the system at every level, and to build your own systems,
[00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:15.052]  And to support other alternative systems.
[00:40:15.052 --> 00:40:16.734]  This is the essence of Renaissance.
[00:40:16.734 --> 00:40:18.615]  This is the essence of the Enlightenment.
[00:40:18.615 --> 00:40:20.657]  This is the essence of common law.
[00:40:20.657 --> 00:40:22.198]  It is the essence of freedom.
[00:40:22.198 --> 00:40:26.802]  It is Veritas.
[00:40:26.802 --> 00:40:28.464]  You have to decide to wake up.
[00:40:28.464 --> 00:40:33.748]  You have to decide to then face the enemy.
[00:40:33.748 --> 00:40:36.951]  Let me read to you from 1984.
[00:40:36.951 --> 00:40:40.594]  As he's been torturing him on the rack and just pulled one of his rotten teeth out.
[00:40:42.619 --> 00:40:47.582]  Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating?
[00:40:47.582 --> 00:40:55.406]  It is the exact opposite of the stupid, hedonistic utopia that the old reformers imagined.
[00:40:55.406 --> 00:40:58.967]  A world of fear and treachery is torment.
[00:40:58.967 --> 00:41:01.469]  A world of trampling and being trampled upon.
[00:41:01.469 --> 00:41:07.412]  A world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself.
[00:41:07.412 --> 00:41:11.254]  Progress, progressives, in our world,
[00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:17.227]  Will be the progress towards more pain.
[00:41:17.227 --> 00:41:24.075]  The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice.
[00:41:24.075 --> 00:41:25.397]  Ours is founded upon hatred.
[00:41:26.857 --> 00:41:33.941]  In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement.
[00:41:33.941 --> 00:41:36.223]  Everything else we shall destroy.
[00:41:36.223 --> 00:41:37.443]  Everything.
[00:41:37.443 --> 00:41:43.107]  Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the revolution.
[00:41:43.107 --> 00:41:48.550]  We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman.
[00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:52.072]  No one dares trust his wife or his child or a friend any longer.
[00:41:53.271 --> 00:41:56.314]  But in the future, there will be no wives and no friends.
[00:41:56.314 --> 00:42:01.419]  Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen.
[00:42:01.419 --> 00:42:04.161]  The sex instinct will be eradicated.
[00:42:04.161 --> 00:42:09.606]  Procreation will be an annual formality, like a renewal of a ration card.
[00:42:09.606 --> 00:42:12.069]  We shall abolish the orgasm.
[00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:15.072]  This has actually been done in North Korea, by the way, with about half the population.
[00:42:16.013 --> 00:42:18.855]  Our neurologists are working upon it now.
[00:42:18.855 --> 00:42:21.697]  There will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party.
[00:42:21.697 --> 00:42:27.000]  There will be no love except the love of Big Brother.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.682]  Chapter 3, page 334.
[00:42:30.682 --> 00:42:37.927]  Read it.
[00:42:37.927 --> 00:42:40.709]  He was brought in to the major
[00:42:42.116 --> 00:42:43.998]  BBC Psych Warfare Facilities.
[00:42:43.998 --> 00:42:45.038]  He wrote about this before he died.
[00:42:45.038 --> 00:42:47.661]  He died right after this book came out, by the way.
[00:42:47.661 --> 00:42:50.783]  And it probably wasn't tuberculosis, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:50.783 --> 00:42:54.286]  Arsenic poisoning is the word from the inside sources.
[00:42:54.286 --> 00:42:56.187]  He was high-level.
[00:42:56.187 --> 00:42:58.609]  Fabian socialist.
[00:42:58.609 --> 00:43:00.071]  Fought with the communists in Spain.
[00:43:00.071 --> 00:43:03.473]  He was secret police in India.
[00:43:03.473 --> 00:43:06.075]  Came from an elite eugenics family.
[00:43:06.075 --> 00:43:09.018]  Tied into the Wedgwoods, the Galtons, Darwins, all of them.
[00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:14.353]  He came from a high-level technocrat family.
[00:43:14.353 --> 00:43:17.256]  And he wrote this book to warn people, okay?
[00:43:17.256 --> 00:43:18.997]  Eric Blair.
[00:43:18.997 --> 00:43:21.259]  Now, I hope you understand this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:21.259 --> 00:43:22.861]  This is what they're going to do.
[00:43:22.861 --> 00:43:25.483]  This is what they write in their real publications.
[00:43:25.483 --> 00:43:27.345]  This is what they've got planned.
[00:43:27.345 --> 00:43:31.088]  Total dishonor.
[00:43:31.088 --> 00:43:32.749]  Total evil.
[00:43:32.749 --> 00:43:34.110]  Total fraud.
[00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:35.612]  Total emptiness.
[00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:36.753]  Now, do you like this plan?
[00:43:38.018 --> 00:43:45.602]  Because you hear that, you read that from 1984, and you realize today this is what's happening.
[00:43:45.602 --> 00:43:48.203]  You realize today this is the world they're building openly.
[00:43:48.203 --> 00:43:51.605]  Now I'm going to ask you all again.
[00:43:51.605 --> 00:43:53.746]  Do you want to openly serve this?
[00:43:53.746 --> 00:43:55.407]  Who likes this out there?
[00:43:55.407 --> 00:43:57.347]  A very small percentage of people.
[00:43:57.347 --> 00:44:04.211]  The most of you do it because the economy's been set up to where you can't live unless you work in this self-destroying system, killing yourself to live.
[00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:13.417]  Killing your soul, your honor, everything your ancestors stood for, in this total dishonor.
[00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:17.200]  Well, I'll say this, death before dishonor.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.043]  What's the Green Beret Special Forces motto?
[00:44:21.043 --> 00:44:22.184]  Overthrow oppressors?
[00:44:22.184 --> 00:44:23.705]  Look it up for me, I forget the exact motto.
[00:44:24.705 --> 00:44:25.826]  Overthrow tyrants?
[00:44:25.826 --> 00:44:26.826]  Death to tyrants?
[00:44:26.826 --> 00:44:31.008]  I mean, where are those creeds out there of honorable people?
[00:44:31.008 --> 00:44:38.292]  Why have the best soldiers always been people who actually were honorable and believed they were fighting for a good cause and were battling against overwhelming odds?
[00:44:38.292 --> 00:44:46.736]  Why could men like that, who were desperate for freedom, desperate for justice, one man could take out ten men?
[00:44:46.736 --> 00:44:48.277]  The samurai wrote about that.
[00:44:48.277 --> 00:44:50.638]  The way of the samurai is desperateness.
[00:44:52.588 --> 00:44:54.649]  Ten men cannot kill such a man.
[00:44:54.649 --> 00:44:57.411]  Where is that spirit?
[00:44:57.411 --> 00:44:58.392]  I'm asking you now.
[00:44:58.392 --> 00:45:00.653]  This is total dishonor.
[00:45:00.653 --> 00:45:10.839]  Worshipping a bunch of stunted, gibbering, spiritually and physically ugly elite who produce nothing but ugliness and hate those of us that are virtuous.
[00:45:10.839 --> 00:45:14.582]  These people are an abomination.
[00:45:14.582 --> 00:45:18.664]  It is an incredible honor and a pleasure to set myself against them.
[00:45:18.664 --> 00:45:19.985]  I am no hero.
[00:45:19.985 --> 00:45:21.426]  I am red-blooded man.
[00:45:23.885 --> 00:45:29.987]  To define someone who stands against this evil as a hero is an abomination.
[00:45:29.987 --> 00:45:32.448]  Sucking air into my lungs, I'm not a hero.
[00:45:32.448 --> 00:45:33.648]  I'm alive.
[00:45:33.648 --> 00:45:38.049]  And it oxygenates my red blood.
[00:45:38.049 --> 00:45:39.850]  I'm alive.
[00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:41.250]  I'm a human.
[00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.191]  I like good things.
[00:45:43.191 --> 00:45:45.872]  That's not heroic.
[00:45:45.872 --> 00:45:47.212]  I stand against evil.
[00:45:47.212 --> 00:45:49.433]  That's not heroic.
[00:45:49.433 --> 00:45:52.774]  I burn with a desire for liberty and to see others empowered.
[00:45:55.242 --> 00:46:02.067]  I burn for humanity to work together and build incredible systems and structures and colonize space.
[00:46:02.067 --> 00:46:05.449]  I dream of our potential being reached.
[00:46:05.449 --> 00:46:08.531]  That's not heroic!
[00:46:08.531 --> 00:46:15.416]  My body will die, but I want my children to go on, and their children to go on, and their children to go on, and to be honorable men and women.
[00:46:15.416 --> 00:46:22.621]  I want to maintain the human species, not let it be mutated and destroyed, vandalized by these demons for their own power trips.
[00:46:24.687 --> 00:46:34.295]  They had a satanist a few decades ago that went and killed the treaty oak, where the Texas Constitution Declaration of Independence was filled out.
[00:46:34.295 --> 00:46:41.841]  And he buried several hundred pounds of weed killer into the roots of it in a satanic ritual, believing he'd get power out of killing the tree.
[00:46:41.841 --> 00:46:46.185]  Just like they think they'd get power out of torturing a little baby for 10 hours.
[00:46:49.232 --> 00:46:50.933]  And in that, you understand who they are.
[00:46:50.933 --> 00:46:56.956]  They want to kill this planet in a disgusting sacrifice to Bath-O-Met.
[00:46:56.956 --> 00:47:00.278]  Well, I'll tell Bath-O-Met and all his followers this.
[00:47:00.278 --> 00:47:03.760]  You were losers from the beginning, and you'll always be losers.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.942]  And you'll never extinguish the Creator's creations.
[00:47:07.942 --> 00:47:09.703]  Only the Creator can do that.
[00:47:09.703 --> 00:47:12.244]  And you can't get my soul.
[00:47:12.244 --> 00:47:17.567]  And I'm gonna do my best to warn other people so that their souls can't be sucked out by you people.
[00:47:18.339 --> 00:47:19.680]  You're disgusting!
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:25.464]  Make me want to throw up!
[00:47:25.464 --> 00:47:28.226]  To liberate the oppressed is the U.S.
[00:47:28.226 --> 00:47:31.489]  Army Special Forces slogan.
[00:47:31.489 --> 00:47:37.473]  Well, are you liberating the oppressed, or are you supporting Al-Qaeda to oppress all over the Middle East?
[00:47:37.473 --> 00:47:41.156]  That's why our military said, we're not going to do it, and there's going to be a military coup.
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:47.643]  We're going to start shooting people if you do an air raid and back Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:47:47.643 --> 00:47:50.625]  I mean, that's basically what was relayed.
[00:47:50.625 --> 00:47:54.327]  And the establishment blinked, ladies and gentlemen, and they can blink all the way.
[00:47:54.327 --> 00:48:00.491]  If we just stand against these people and commit, it's over for the new world order.
[00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:02.412]  Doesn't mean evil won't keep coming back.
[00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:05.014]  Doesn't mean we might not blow the earth up five years from now.
[00:48:05.014 --> 00:48:07.936]  The point is you have to make the spiritual decision
[00:48:09.764 --> 00:48:19.351]  Or the decision in your core, whatever is at your heart, that you do not want to be part of this 1984 scenario.
[00:48:19.351 --> 00:48:20.251]  And look at it!
[00:48:20.251 --> 00:48:21.612]  It's all manifesting!
[00:48:21.612 --> 00:48:30.138]  Because 1984 is a historical, futurist allegory of what the world would look like, and Eric Blair
[00:48:30.967 --> 00:48:53.765]  George Orwell, pen name, and Julian Huxley, and Aldous Huxley, because the Huxleys wrote books about this, would have debates about whether it be a 1984 system or a Brave New World system, and Huxley said the Brave New World system is the dominant one being adopted with an integration with your 1984 Stalinistic scenario.
[00:48:56.164 --> 00:49:13.310]  And both those books, one written in 1948, 1984, and the other written in 1932, Brave New World, if you read both those books, they've now, both of them come about 75, 80% true, and you can see the decks of cards being shuffled in together.
[00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:22.373]  And then you can go read where they wrote countless non-fiction books, where this is the plan to build this.
[00:49:22.373 --> 00:49:24.894]  So understand, ladies and gentlemen, you're under attack.
[00:49:26.778 --> 00:49:30.379]  And the family is under attack.
[00:49:30.379 --> 00:49:32.180]  And everything good is under attack.
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:36.962]  And we are seeing the beginnings of a societal level collapse.
[00:49:36.962 --> 00:49:43.024]  And mass mental illness and artificially induced self-righteous narcissism events.
[00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:52.013]  Where people care about being the top parrot on the tree instead of being a human who's conscious and awake.
[00:49:52.013 --> 00:49:56.615]  Everything is going into basically low-level simian drive.
[00:49:56.615 --> 00:50:01.357]  And the society is becoming very base.
[00:50:01.357 --> 00:50:04.359]  And dishonorable and empty.
[00:50:04.359 --> 00:50:06.620]  And I don't want to be part of that.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:10.522]  And believe me, I know it's hard with your family, my family, all of us.
[00:50:12.446 --> 00:50:17.409]  Even when you know this knowledge at a great level, your flesh is still strong, and none of us are perfect.
[00:50:17.409 --> 00:50:20.130]  But you just have to make the decision in your heart.
[00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:24.713]  And you have to do what Ted Cruz has done, coming out saying the President is dangerous and terrifying.
[00:50:24.713 --> 00:50:30.536]  Because even if he's just a figurehead, Obama, for the corrupt system, that's what the public archetypally sees.
[00:50:30.536 --> 00:50:36.980]  We must expose the fraud of the system by exposing Obama.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.382]  And notice Cruz is being catapulted to world renown
[00:50:42.785 --> 00:50:52.637]  Voted the most important political person in the world, even before the Pope last week, in a major poll, because he has some courage and tells it like it is.
[00:50:52.637 --> 00:50:54.179]  And that's the other answer.
[00:50:54.179 --> 00:50:55.781]  People are looking for leadership.
[00:50:55.781 --> 00:50:56.582]  Face the facts.
[00:50:56.582 --> 00:50:57.963]  Speak out against the system.
[00:50:57.963 --> 00:50:58.964]  Become a leader now.
[00:51:04.798 --> 00:51:09.880]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.961]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[00:51:11.961 --> 00:51:14.162]  Police call it robbery.
[00:51:14.162 --> 00:51:16.063]  We call it avoidable.
[00:51:16.063 --> 00:51:22.086]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.

[00:56:17.832 --> 00:56:22.296]  I wish that that was still the creed of our military.
[00:56:22.296 --> 00:56:28.922]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, there is so much to discuss and so much to talk about.
[00:56:28.922 --> 00:56:33.906]  Let me just give you a little foretaste of what's going to be breaking down in the next hour.
[00:56:33.906 --> 00:56:40.933]  We'll spend about 45 minutes with Dr. Edward Group in studio to talk about the
[00:56:42.805 --> 00:56:51.893]  Estrogen Conspiracy, as he calls it, that's on record, as the White House science art bragged about it in the 70s, to feminize men.
[00:56:51.893 --> 00:56:53.955]  And it also then gives women breast cancer and so much more.
[00:56:53.955 --> 00:57:01.542]  We're going to look at that, but first we're going to cover some news with him, some of the world events and get his take on that because he's an interesting fellow.
[00:57:02.594 --> 00:57:04.255]  And he was in the Army Special Forces.
[00:57:04.255 --> 00:57:05.436]  I didn't even know that.
[00:57:05.436 --> 00:57:07.357]  One day we had some guns back there for the gun show.
[00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:09.879]  We were locking and loading and looking at them and cleaning them.
[00:57:09.879 --> 00:57:20.287]  And he walked in and Weldon was in the Air Force in Korea and they were having quite a talk about stuff along the DMZ and Special Forces missions and stuff.
[00:57:20.287 --> 00:57:21.167]  Group's an interesting guy.
[00:57:21.167 --> 00:57:23.149]  He's going to be in here with us.
[00:57:23.149 --> 00:57:24.430]  A fellow Texan and patriot.
[00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:27.110]  But we're going to get into this article.
[00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:28.071]  I didn't cover enough last week.
[00:57:28.071 --> 00:57:28.791]  I want to get back into it.
[00:57:28.791 --> 00:57:32.692]  The primary function of the FBI is national security.
[00:57:32.692 --> 00:57:37.094]  Agency drops law enforcement as top priority from its mission statement.
[00:57:37.094 --> 00:57:38.594]  I'm going to tell you what that really means, folks.
[00:57:38.594 --> 00:57:40.755]  I mean, that is a big, big deal.
[00:57:40.755 --> 00:57:43.896]  Suicides of young vets top those of active duty troops.
[00:57:43.896 --> 00:57:48.717]  Congresswoman urges welfare, a name change, calling it traditional living fund.
[00:57:48.717 --> 00:57:53.739]  Or conditional, transitional.
[00:57:55.766 --> 00:58:04.208]  Sometimes they pop in my ear, folks, that kind of pause, and for whatever reason, that mic doesn't really pick it up, so I'm always kind of straining to hear what you guys are saying.
[00:58:04.208 --> 00:58:06.869]  But I appreciate you helping me out with that headline.
[00:58:06.869 --> 00:58:12.070]  Congresswoman urges welfare name change, transitional living fund.
[00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:13.011]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:58:13.011 --> 00:58:20.653]  And then the really big news coming up, Ford exec apologizes for saying company tracks customers with GPS.
[00:58:20.653 --> 00:58:21.613]  Of course they do, but
[00:58:22.714 --> 00:58:29.335]  He was there to acclimate it and throw it in your face, and now that you know, you're a little upset, so he'll tell you that it isn't true.
[00:58:29.335 --> 00:58:31.736]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:58:31.736 --> 00:58:37.717]  And Global Warming labels proposed for California gas pumps, getting you ready for the carbon tax.
[00:58:37.717 --> 00:58:41.038]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.038 --> 00:58:44.918]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.918 --> 00:58:46.579]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.347 --> 00:58:59.436]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:58:59.436 --> 00:59:07.844]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:12.508]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:59:12.708 --> 00:59:19.493]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:19.493 --> 00:59:26.678]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:59:26.678 --> 00:59:33.703]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:38.046]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:59:38.166 --> 00:59:41.547]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:59:41.547 --> 00:59:43.448]  You will be supporting a free press.
[00:59:43.448 --> 00:59:47.849]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:59:47.849 --> 00:59:53.391]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:53.391 --> 00:59:55.772]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.772 --> 00:59:58.553]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.322 --> 01:00:10.164]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.164 --> 01:00:11.744]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.744 --> 01:00:13.285]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.285 --> 01:00:17.487]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.487 --> 01:00:21.568]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.972 --> 01:00:36.775]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two.
[01:00:36.775 --> 01:00:39.137]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:39.137 --> 01:00:44.381]  Edward Group's going to be joining us coming up in the next segment for the balance of the hour.
[01:00:44.381 --> 01:00:47.464]  There is a ton of news we're going to be getting to as well.
[01:00:47.464 --> 01:00:50.587]  And we have a... Just grab my guest folder here.
[01:00:51.325 --> 01:01:04.449]  We also have a scholar coming on, Elizabeth Price Foley, getting into Obama's classical, tyrannical abuses that are out in the open.
[01:01:04.449 --> 01:01:14.591]  Professor Foley is a founding member of the FIU College of Law, Constitutional Law, and she's practiced law before the US Supreme Court, you name it.
[01:01:14.591 --> 01:01:18.392]  She's a big fish with the Cato Supreme Court Review.
[01:01:18.392 --> 01:01:19.513]  We're going to get her on.
[01:01:20.793 --> 01:01:28.860]  To, from a legal perspective, break down what Ted Cruz, also a constitutional lawyer, is saying.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.962]  Cruz calls President dangerous and terrifying.
[01:01:31.962 --> 01:01:34.304]  I mean, that's what it is.
[01:01:34.304 --> 01:01:43.131]  I mean, I'd call jumping into an African river with 25-foot crocodiles in it dangerous and terrifying.
[01:01:43.131 --> 01:01:45.913]  I mean, that's basically what this is.
[01:01:45.913 --> 01:01:46.794]  But it's even more deadly.
[01:01:47.924 --> 01:01:52.825]  And believe me, folks, Ted Cruz, I would not fly on small private planes.
[01:01:52.825 --> 01:01:54.646]  They tend to blow those up.
[01:01:54.646 --> 01:01:57.006]  And I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:01:57.006 --> 01:01:57.847]  Serious courage.
[01:01:57.847 --> 01:01:58.987]  You've got to admire it.
[01:01:58.987 --> 01:02:00.747]  Because believe me, this is not what they want.
[01:02:00.747 --> 01:02:02.288]  They're coming after him for it.
[01:02:02.288 --> 01:02:03.288]  He knows it.
[01:02:03.288 --> 01:02:05.469]  That's a big deal.
[01:02:05.469 --> 01:02:11.470]  Now, in other news, we're going to cover this more when Group gets on with us, some about radiation.
[01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:14.091]  I've told the crew that when I get stuff wrong, to correct me.
[01:02:15.623 --> 01:02:22.087]  Which I do a lot because you get on air and you're talking and there's cameras and lights and all these articles and you're thinking about so much, you get stuff wrong.
[01:02:22.087 --> 01:02:27.751]  So, a key correction, because once I get stuff stuck in my head, I just keep saying it wrong.
[01:02:27.751 --> 01:02:34.656]  They found 1,400% increase in radiation on San Francisco beaches, not 1,400 times.
[01:02:34.656 --> 01:02:35.056]  1,400% increase.
[01:02:44.758 --> 01:03:10.400]  I mean it was like last week I did something where I misread an article about gun control stuff in Canada and then saw another article about a university that sounded like Quebec but was Quinebec I think and then later I like conflated the two articles together because I didn't have them in front of me and just I heard the rebroadcast and it was just it was it was it was basically a brain fart and I mean look I don't script what I say I just do the research and then put it out there
[01:03:11.551 --> 01:03:22.561]  My brain still works pretty good, but I'm not as young as I used to be, and I don't have a photographic memory like I did in the past, so I've got to be more careful about stuff because it gets jumbled together.
[01:03:22.561 --> 01:03:24.542]  Plus, I work a lot harder than I ever have in my life.
[01:03:24.542 --> 01:03:36.733]  I've learned how to work on a lot of days, 15, 16 hours straight with no breaks except for brushing my teeth or eating.
[01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:37.133]  I don't know.
[01:03:37.133 --> 01:03:39.035]  It's turned me into a different person.
[01:03:40.482 --> 01:03:53.510]  Because I know a lot more, I'm more seasoned, I'm older, and I get more stuff done, but my brain has been rewired, and it's really weird.
[01:03:53.510 --> 01:04:00.634]  And of course, changes in the mind, changes in the body, it's part of life, it's all part of this experience.
[01:04:01.816 --> 01:04:12.584]  That is the incredible gift of consciousness that our Creator has given us, out here on a planet, hurtling through the deep void of space, surrounded by so much wonderment.
[01:04:12.584 --> 01:04:13.645]  I mean, wow!
[01:04:13.645 --> 01:04:15.847]  What an incredible thing!
[01:04:15.847 --> 01:04:20.490]  I think that's why I'm saddest, you know, for my uncle passing, because I know he goes on.
[01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:29.898]  But, you know, in this plane of existence, knowing him and that experience, and never being able to talk to him in this life,
[01:04:31.024 --> 01:04:33.266]  I was talking to one of my friends last night.
[01:04:33.266 --> 01:04:41.431]  He was talking about his grandfather, who he lived with when he was a kid, and he said three times a week, at least, he has dreams where he has dinner with him and talks to him and says, in the dream, I thought you were dead.
[01:04:41.431 --> 01:04:43.253]  And he's like, no, no, partner.
[01:04:43.253 --> 01:04:44.854]  I'm no part.
[01:04:44.854 --> 01:04:46.595]  I'm still here with you.
[01:04:46.595 --> 01:04:49.517]  And it's like almost like real conversations.
[01:04:49.517 --> 01:04:56.882]  And I've had those kind of conversations with one of my grandfathers who died when I was about, I guess, 22, 23, and my mother's father.
[01:05:00.399 --> 01:05:03.421]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:05:03.421 --> 01:05:08.424]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:05:08.424 --> 01:05:15.608]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:05:15.748 --> 01:05:21.375]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:25.400]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:30.126]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:35.352]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:05:35.592 --> 01:05:38.836]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:05:38.836 --> 01:05:41.339]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:05:41.339 --> 01:05:46.104]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:05:46.104 --> 01:05:48.987]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:55.995]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[01:05:56.175 --> 01:05:57.436]  We're getting prepared.
[01:05:57.436 --> 01:05:58.116]  Are you?
[01:05:58.116 --> 01:06:00.157]  InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:10.823]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:06:10.823 --> 01:06:12.684]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:06:12.884 --> 01:06:13.764]  Fluoride.
[01:06:13.764 --> 01:06:15.685]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:06:15.685 --> 01:06:22.267]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:06:22.267 --> 01:06:27.188]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:06:27.188 --> 01:06:33.510]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:35.930]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:38.871]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:06:38.871 --> 01:06:42.252]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:06:42.372 --> 01:06:47.798]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:47.798 --> 01:06:52.904]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[01:07:10.157 --> 01:07:16.280]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:27.045]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.

[01:08:11.693 --> 01:08:13.234]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.234 --> 01:08:17.416]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.416 --> 01:08:21.518]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:29.366 --> 01:08:34.550]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen, on this Friday, 10th day of January 2014.
[01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:38.474]  In studio, Dr. Edward Grubb, coming up here in just a moment.
[01:08:38.474 --> 01:08:44.539]  And we've got a constitutional lawyer joining us coming up in the next hour and more news as well.
[01:08:44.539 --> 01:08:47.681]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:08:47.681 --> 01:08:52.165]  Some of the news that we need to break down right now.
[01:08:52.165 --> 01:08:57.230]  The firestorm around Governor Christie in New Jersey is intensifying as it becomes clearer.
[01:08:57.910 --> 01:09:05.037]  That he lied earlier when he said he didn't know anything about it and has been involved in a cover-up and obviously gave the orders for the shutdown of the bridge.
[01:09:05.037 --> 01:09:08.840]  There's no way that his number two in command would do that on their own.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:13.344]  Wall Street Journal compared to using IRS against political opponents.
[01:09:13.344 --> 01:09:16.167]  Closing traffic lanes is jaywalking.
[01:09:16.167 --> 01:09:22.813]  No, it's all acts of terrorism against the population by people that use their control as a way to strangle the population.
[01:09:22.813 --> 01:09:24.455]  This is the acts of tyrants.
[01:09:26.952 --> 01:09:33.695]  And this is just some of the garbage that we're going to live under when they have a technocracy that tracks and traces everything that we do.
[01:09:33.695 --> 01:09:43.999]  Just like the head spokesman for Ford came out and said, hey, we track everything you do and give it to the cops with GPS that's in the new boxes.
[01:09:43.999 --> 01:09:46.600]  It's in almost all the new cars, folks, the last four or five years.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.981]  I warned you about this a long time ago, but it just shows the arrogance.
[01:09:50.981 --> 01:09:55.442]  Well, now Ford executive apologizes for saying company tracks customers with GPS.
[01:09:55.442 --> 01:10:05.705]  Ford motor company marketing chief Jim Farley on Thursday apologized for the remark he made Wednesday saying the Dearborn automaker tracks customers through in-car navigation devices.
[01:10:06.425 --> 01:10:17.150]  Farley, the headliner at this week's customer electronics show in Las Vegas, said Ford knows where and when customers drive their vehicles, but does not sell that information to third parties.
[01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:22.373]  And of course, if you believe that, I'll sell you the Golden Gate Bridge and throw in the moon for free.
[01:10:22.373 --> 01:10:26.675]  I mean, look, folks, you don't have to believe him or not believe this piece of trash.
[01:10:27.535 --> 01:10:32.841]  You have to go look at what the black boxes do globally mandated.
[01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:35.464]  These have gone in England, Australia, Germany.
[01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:38.847]  This is the globalist and they make you pay for it.
[01:10:38.847 --> 01:10:47.596]  I was seeing numbers that Dr. Stallman put out a few years ago of where something like 30% of a smartphone is all the spy tech they put in it and tracker systems to track you.
[01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:59.369]  Same thing with a television set's got all this stuff now to track what you're watching and what you're doing and to not let you plug in other devices and play things and to quote stop piracy.
[01:10:59.369 --> 01:11:03.053]  Thousands of dollars of cost in a car are these surveillance systems.
[01:11:03.053 --> 01:11:06.497]  That's why the feds came out last year and said we're going to start taxing you by the mile.
[01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:13.413]  And now they're coming out with global warming warning labels proposed for California gas pumps.
[01:11:13.413 --> 01:11:24.520]  And that, again, out of CBS San Francisco, is to prepare you for the carbon tax that they're going to implement for global warming.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.762]  Even though they're totally discredited, they don't care.
[01:11:26.762 --> 01:11:33.446]  They just need the illusion that they have an excuse so you feel like they have the moral authority, and then even debate these fraudsters.
[01:11:33.446 --> 01:11:36.088]  Even if carbon dioxide is bad, which obviously it isn't,
[01:11:37.099 --> 01:11:44.065]  In the atmosphere compared to all the other stuff that's happening and we're at a low level historically in that plants grow faster and more oxygen is put out.
[01:11:44.065 --> 01:11:48.389]  This is just part of the carbon cycle.
[01:11:48.389 --> 01:11:50.491]  They're not doing this to stop it.
[01:11:50.491 --> 01:11:51.552]  They're not misguided.
[01:11:51.552 --> 01:11:59.158]  They're doing it to control and surveil the entire carbon cycle on the planet to control everything you do under Agenda 21 to shut down the civilization on record.
[01:12:04.892 --> 01:12:06.452]  So there you go, it makes my head spin.
[01:12:06.452 --> 01:12:11.734]  Meanwhile, McClatchy reports Obama works to craft response to surveillance uproar.
[01:12:11.734 --> 01:12:13.534]  And we've already seen the response.
[01:12:13.534 --> 01:12:23.997]  A White House report three weeks ago admitting that certain corporations use it for financial gain, that everybody's surveilling everybody, and that he said it's terrible and horrible when he's helped supercharge it.
[01:12:23.997 --> 01:12:25.297]  That's what Obama does.
[01:12:25.297 --> 01:12:27.357]  The NDAA is just terrible.
[01:12:27.357 --> 01:12:30.058]  That's why I signed it and wrote it.
[01:12:30.058 --> 01:12:33.239]  It's just terrible that Al-Qaeda's murdering all the Christians in Syria.
[01:12:33.239 --> 01:12:34.379]  That's why we're funding them to do it.
[01:12:36.368 --> 01:12:39.030]  Again, because the public doesn't know where Syria is.
[01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:41.551]  The public doesn't know Shiite versus Sunni.
[01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:44.133]  They don't know the basic players.
[01:12:44.133 --> 01:12:45.574]  They know the football players.
[01:12:45.574 --> 01:12:48.896]  They know who the supermodels are.
[01:12:48.896 --> 01:12:52.098]  They know all this stuff that doesn't matter.
[01:12:52.098 --> 01:12:54.499]  People aren't actually stupid.
[01:12:54.499 --> 01:13:00.683]  Their minds and their systems of understanding complexity is in baseball scores.
[01:13:00.683 --> 01:13:01.904]  Men will walk up to me.
[01:13:03.467 --> 01:13:11.674]  Anywhere, the gym, the street, anywhere, and just go, hey, you know, Sunset's broke the record of the 1942 streak of blah, blah, blah.
[01:13:11.674 --> 01:13:18.580]  See if I respond back and I'm just like, man, I tell you, I mainly focus on business and politics for factoids and stuff.
[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:21.622]  I used to like baseball, but I just, you know,
[01:13:23.772 --> 01:13:28.136]  And they're always people that don't care about anything else themselves.
[01:13:28.136 --> 01:13:30.098]  Like the whole country's going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:13:30.098 --> 01:13:36.344]  They have no self-preservation because they're arrested development children, whose whole world is about spectating.
[01:13:36.344 --> 01:13:46.453]  So all my favorite movies, my favorite shows, my favorite books, fiction, and all my favorite sports teams, and knowing all the male soap opera info.
[01:13:46.453 --> 01:13:48.335]  That's all sports is, is male soap opera.
[01:13:50.183 --> 01:14:00.748]  Simulated combat, simulated war with the generals on the sidelines and then the quarterbacks, the war chief, the platoon leader, the centurion leader out there leading the forces.
[01:14:00.748 --> 01:14:09.032]  I mean, they've got the armor on and it's literally been sold and pushed for hundreds of years, thousands going back to Rome to steal your entire future.
[01:14:10.752 --> 01:14:12.953]  And I'm not even indicting you for liking it.
[01:14:12.953 --> 01:14:15.074]  I'm just saying be aware of that.
[01:14:15.074 --> 01:14:22.856]  Do you know how much success you can have just in life with this data, separately just in business?
[01:14:22.856 --> 01:14:25.057]  The system doesn't want you to be informed.
[01:14:25.057 --> 01:14:29.419]  I actually listened to Karl Rove years ago during the Super Bowl.
[01:14:29.419 --> 01:14:33.620]  We went one Sunday during the Super Bowl to a steakhouse with the crew.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:35.721]  The guys were in there, Wes and others.
[01:14:37.074 --> 01:14:42.126]  And we listened to them and actually heard Rove making fun of idiots watching the NFL game.
[01:14:44.005 --> 01:14:54.029]  Cause one of the oil men he was with, with their wives, brought up the game and Karl Rove was laughing about it and basically saying, you know, I focus on how the world works.
[01:14:54.029 --> 01:14:54.729]  And yeah, that's the thing.
[01:14:54.729 --> 01:14:56.810]  The evil people, that's how he was laughing.
[01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:58.210]  I had to leave after 20 minutes.
[01:14:58.210 --> 01:14:59.391]  I couldn't listen to it anymore.
[01:14:59.391 --> 01:15:04.533]  I was going to confront him after we, we, we got there and looked over Karl Rove's there, ordered our, started to order our food.
[01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:05.473]  I just said, no, no, no.
[01:15:05.473 --> 01:15:07.134]  After 20 minutes, we're not ordering food.
[01:15:07.134 --> 01:15:07.794]  We're out of here.
[01:15:08.499 --> 01:15:23.613]  Because I wanted to confront him, I should have confronted him with a video camera and left, but I literally was tired, already done a show that day, and I didn't want to sit there until our meal was done listening to the demonic gerbiling, is the word I would use out of turd blossom.
[01:15:23.613 --> 01:15:25.395]  That's his nickname, Bush Head, for him.
[01:15:25.395 --> 01:15:28.979]  And that's the thing, is you're victims.
[01:15:28.979 --> 01:15:32.282]  They're laughing at you, and I want you to learn how the real world works.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.842]  Fed moves to block discovery of NSA lawsuits.
[01:15:36.842 --> 01:15:40.926]  NSA spying sends data clients north of the border.
[01:15:40.926 --> 01:15:44.248]  A chunky, cheerful tracking device to keep tabs on your child.
[01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:48.371]  All this stuff is coming out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:48.371 --> 01:15:50.413]  So we're going to be getting more into that coming up.
[01:15:50.413 --> 01:15:54.236]  Russian celebrity claims she was stripped naked by TSA.
[01:15:54.236 --> 01:15:59.100]  Russian TV model and TV star said that the TSA agent took her clothes off.
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.520]  This is now a big scandal.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:12.364]  I mean, people from other countries, India, Russia, they freak out when they come here because no authoritarians like Miss USA actually go in the pants, in the line, into the woman's body.
[01:16:12.364 --> 01:16:14.165]  That happened to Miss USA in Dallas.
[01:16:14.165 --> 01:16:16.306]  She was crying and witnesses saw it.
[01:16:16.306 --> 01:16:17.526]  I mean, you know, that's normal.
[01:16:17.526 --> 01:16:18.807]  People say, oh, we'll get tough.
[01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:19.647]  Let me tell you something.
[01:16:22.352 --> 01:16:29.215]  I mean, when you're in bed with your wife and you're having relations at first, it's electric and a little uncomfortable at first until you get going.
[01:16:29.215 --> 01:16:31.656]  I mean, I don't want to get into details here, but everybody knows that.
[01:16:31.656 --> 01:16:34.977]  Imagine, this is outsiders putting their hands on your body.
[01:16:34.977 --> 01:16:36.578]  This is rape, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:36.578 --> 01:16:41.400]  But see, the state has taken the unreal and made it real.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.982]  The pedophilia training of the children in the schools and then with the TSA.
[01:16:44.982 --> 01:16:47.763]  All in the name of stopping Al-Qaeda, the government openly runs.
[01:16:49.005 --> 01:17:01.310]  And now they're saying, oh, it's not for Al-Qaeda, it's for domestic groups, and the FBI's main mission is terrorism, and the Tea Party, and domestic groups, labeling us, the real Americans that know what's happening, as the enemy.
[01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:05.112]  Also, report, freed Guantanamo detainee involved in Benghazi attack.
[01:17:05.112 --> 01:17:13.015]  I told you, it's come out, they train real terrorists there, to be Al-Qaeda forces, to lead attacks in Syria, in Libya, in Iraq.
[01:17:13.015 --> 01:17:14.016]  Our government does.
[01:17:14.016 --> 01:17:15.616]  It's an actual training base.
[01:17:15.616 --> 01:17:16.517]  That came out years ago.
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.482]  They take people that aren't terrorists and turn them into terrorists.
[01:17:20.482 --> 01:17:22.263]  Double, triple agents.
[01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:26.747]  Now, we're going to have Dr. Group with us about 10 minutes to the next hour.
[01:17:26.747 --> 01:17:28.588]  I appreciate him coming to Austin, Texas.
[01:17:28.588 --> 01:17:33.352]  He's also going to be on the TV show today as well, The Nightly News.
[01:17:33.352 --> 01:17:43.280]  We're going to talk a little bit about Fukushima, a little bit about radiation, but then we're going to get into the conspiracy using estrogens in everything
[01:17:44.611 --> 01:17:51.715]  It's on record to control us, but here is the Santa Cruz Sentinel state rebuffs radiation concerns at beach.
[01:17:51.715 --> 01:17:59.739]  A YouTube video titled by radio host Alex Jones shows elevated radioactivity at Half Moon Bay, which prompted San Mateo County health officials to alert the state.
[01:17:59.739 --> 01:18:06.723]  But the state said this week that the radiation is naturally occurring and seen often along California's eroding coastline, but admitted that it was 500% higher than normal.
[01:18:08.888 --> 01:18:14.595]  And they go on to break down, you know, the fact that the public doesn't trust the media and thinks there's a cover-up.
[01:18:14.595 --> 01:18:21.963]  And our reporters are coming up the last 20 minutes from the ground there where they found a lot of low levels along the coast and some high levels.
[01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:25.628]  But the good news is most areas are not radioactive on the coastline.
[01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:31.275]  Places like Santa Cruz, you name it, we're on the radio, do not have a radiation level.
[01:18:31.275 --> 01:18:32.416]  So that's some good news.
[01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:35.960]  Dr. Group, thanks for coming in with us just briefly on the Fukushima issue.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:42.168]  Then we're going to break and coming back with this detailed breakdown you've got on the situation with the estrogen.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.021]  Well, thanks for having me on.
[01:18:44.021 --> 01:18:45.321]  It's always good to be on your show.
[01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:47.122]  I mean, everybody's talking about Fukushima.
[01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:53.766]  It's been in the news everywhere, and you're doing a good job of, you know, educating people out there and how they can protect themselves.
[01:18:53.766 --> 01:19:05.112]  I mean, there's no better time right now than for people to start looking at their environment, looking at their health, starting to clean their bodies, starting to looking at the type of foods that they eat, drinking clean water, breathing clean air.
[01:19:05.832 --> 01:19:15.578]  So, uh, I'm constantly recommending to people, you know, you really have to take a look because there's already been reports of birth defects around California, up into Washington, Oregon.
[01:19:15.578 --> 01:19:19.661]  I mean, our phone is ringing off the hook with people saying, what can I do?
[01:19:19.661 --> 01:19:21.662]  People all over the world are saying, what can I do?
[01:19:21.662 --> 01:19:23.504]  Well, the radiation levels are going up.
[01:19:23.504 --> 01:19:28.727]  It's just that they're not, they're only, you know, 20, 30, 40% what they should be in other areas.
[01:19:28.727 --> 01:19:33.190]  So when I say good news, you know, it's not good news if you absorb one of the hot particles.
[01:19:33.632 --> 01:19:34.233]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:34.233 --> 01:19:37.116]  The good news is there's always a solution for every situation.
[01:19:37.116 --> 01:19:44.043]  I mean, regardless of how bad it gets, if you know the right people, you know where to go, you take responsibility for your own health, you can protect your own self.
[01:19:44.043 --> 01:19:46.906]  Filter your water, take nasoniodine.
[01:19:46.906 --> 01:19:51.231]  We'll talk about later, after we get into the issue of the estrogen, back into the radiation.
[01:19:51.231 --> 01:19:52.832]  With Dr. Edward Group, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:52.832 --> 01:19:53.193]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.693 --> 01:20:03.534]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:20:03.534 --> 01:20:08.656]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:20:08.656 --> 01:20:16.779]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:20:16.779 --> 01:20:21.301]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:20:21.301 --> 01:20:25.122]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:20:25.262 --> 01:20:31.226]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:34.388]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:20:34.388 --> 01:20:39.772]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:20:39.772 --> 01:20:47.957]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:20:47.957 --> 01:20:48.137]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:21:00.664 --> 01:21:07.366]  By now you may know that a bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that's easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[01:21:07.366 --> 01:21:08.506]  No bank needed.
[01:21:08.506 --> 01:21:12.388]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[01:21:12.388 --> 01:21:19.390]  Plus, a large number of businesses and merchants already accept bitcoins and bitcoins are easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.

[01:24:08.081 --> 01:24:14.247]  All right, we got Dr. Group up here from South Texas to cover this stuff, so I'm not going to get into any more news now except this one.
[01:24:14.247 --> 01:24:19.632]  When I tell you they trained the Benghazi attack force at Guantanamo Bay, that's really what it is.
[01:24:19.632 --> 01:24:23.595]  They take innocent people there mainly and literally torture them, brainwash them.
[01:24:23.595 --> 01:24:26.198]  They have a CIA mind control base on the base.
[01:24:26.198 --> 01:24:28.400]  That's on record.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.681]  This is Breitbart Report.
[01:24:29.681 --> 01:24:32.544]  Freed Guantanamo detainee involved in Benghazi attack.
[01:24:32.544 --> 01:24:33.525]  Well, here's the rest of the story.
[01:24:34.414 --> 01:24:37.862]  Here's AP from last year.
[01:24:37.862 --> 01:24:42.332]  Secret CIA Guantanamo facility trained prisoners to be double agents.
[01:24:42.332 --> 01:24:42.613]  You see?
[01:24:43.604 --> 01:24:44.564]  I got a whole stack.
[01:24:44.564 --> 01:24:49.607]  Guantanamo Bay prisoners worked as double agents for CIA, New York Daily News.
[01:24:49.607 --> 01:24:56.170]  Okay, so I'm telling you folks, they trained the current Al-Qaeda commanders at this base as the next generation.
[01:24:56.170 --> 01:24:58.811]  Now, going back to Dr. Ed Group here.
[01:24:58.811 --> 01:25:00.252]  Doc, you've got the floor.
[01:25:00.252 --> 01:25:02.133]  This short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:25:02.133 --> 01:25:04.354]  Get into, people know about Bistrí Malé and
[01:25:05.154 --> 01:25:07.579]  All this other stuff, but what about the estrogen mimickers?
[01:25:07.579 --> 01:25:14.430]  I know your dad was a famous chemist and all the rest of it, so you're very well versed on this and expose it.
[01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:17.916]  Break down where it's at, what they're doing, what it's done to society.
[01:25:18.581 --> 01:25:37.636]  Well, over the last 10 years, I've been getting increased calls from estrogen dominance in males, especially feminism and women that have decreased testosterone levels, you know, increases in ovarian cancer, increases in prostate cancer, men getting man boobs, children being born with smaller penises.
[01:25:37.636 --> 01:25:39.237]  I mean, all this stuff has been going on.
[01:25:39.237 --> 01:25:45.142]  So I took the time and did the research and tried to figure it out and put it all together on what's really happened.
[01:25:45.202 --> 01:25:50.766]  You know, I like to figure out the root cause of the problem so we can come around and try to fix the problem.
[01:25:50.766 --> 01:25:55.930]  And what it led me to find out is a lot of different things that we've talked about in this conspiracy.
[01:25:55.930 --> 01:25:57.992]  It's not a conspiracy because it's really happening.
[01:25:57.992 --> 01:26:02.315]  It's a literal eugenics and depopulation scheme that's going on.
[01:26:02.315 --> 01:26:04.257]  And there's two points to this scheme.
[01:26:04.257 --> 01:26:14.245]  And one is, well, with population control, you're going to either increase the death rate, which they're doing already through chemicals and everything, or you're going to decrease the birth rate.
[01:26:14.745 --> 01:26:26.801]  So what I want to talk about is how they're actually decreasing the birth rate and how they're doing it is they're using a multitude of chemicals and it's lowering the testosterone levels.
[01:26:26.801 --> 01:26:29.325]  I mean this is even happening in the wombs because
[01:26:30.498 --> 01:26:51.752]  In the womb, the fetus, everybody is actually in the fetal state a female and the brain is a female and it doesn't, the fetus changes to a male with the introduction of testosterone and that's what causes the ovary to form into testicles and it also causes the brain of the fetus to become either male or female.
[01:26:51.752 --> 01:26:59.858]  So what happens with all these endocrine disruptors and endocrine glands or just anything... And that's happening to the fish and amphibians now too.
[01:27:00.859 --> 01:27:03.322]  They're becoming, they're becoming bisexual.
[01:27:03.322 --> 01:27:07.007]  Well because of all the chemicals, the endocrine disrupting chemicals.
[01:27:07.007 --> 01:27:09.049]  And I don't mean bisexual in sexual activity.
[01:27:09.049 --> 01:27:10.491]  They're becoming hermaphrodites.
[01:27:11.124 --> 01:27:12.864]  This is what they're doing to us.
[01:27:12.864 --> 01:27:15.765]  This is what they said they would do in Brave New World.
[01:27:15.765 --> 01:27:16.365]  Exactly.
[01:27:16.365 --> 01:27:17.226]  And that's what's happening.
[01:27:17.226 --> 01:27:21.267]  There's being like in Peru, there's eight women being born to every one male.
[01:27:21.267 --> 01:27:24.807]  When the woman is under stress, there's more miscarriages as males too.
[01:27:24.807 --> 01:27:29.188]  Because basically, the number one reason that we're dealing with this is pesticides.
[01:27:29.188 --> 01:27:34.770]  I've identified seven ways and seven things that they're using to reduce our testosterone levels.
[01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:37.091]  The first thing is pesticides.
[01:27:37.091 --> 01:27:39.573]  Look at Roundup, which is being sprayed all over the place.
[01:27:39.573 --> 01:27:41.094]  It's the number one pesticide in the world.
[01:27:41.094 --> 01:27:44.816]  It's an estrogen mimicker and it also blocks testosterone.
[01:27:44.816 --> 01:27:45.677]  That's the glyphosate.
[01:27:45.677 --> 01:27:47.138]  That's the glyphosate.
[01:27:47.138 --> 01:27:54.803]  Also, you have Atrazine, which is being sprayed on all the corn, genetically modified corn, which is a company, Syngenta, which produces that.
[01:27:55.163 --> 01:28:07.633]  So you have PCBs, you have bisphenols, you have all different types of endocrine disruptors, and it's happening in males where now where we used to see low testosterone around 30 years old, we're starting to see it much sooner.
[01:28:07.633 --> 01:28:17.402]  And what you were saying about the frogs even, there's male frogs that are actually disrupted because what nobody's talking about really is the disruption.
[01:28:17.402 --> 01:28:20.865]  You can be born a male but have a female brain because it
[01:28:21.525 --> 01:28:26.667]  During gestation or when you're in the womb, there's certain... They found that with chickens and chemicals too.
[01:28:26.667 --> 01:28:30.908]  And that's why a male chicken, if it needs to, can convert to a female.
[01:28:30.908 --> 01:28:31.388]  Exactly.
[01:28:31.388 --> 01:28:41.492]  And that's my whole point is that that's why we need to identify these sources so people can avoid them and also increase the testosterone naturally in women and men.
[01:28:42.572 --> 01:28:45.935]  Because, you know, we're coming into a society where men are lazy.
[01:28:45.935 --> 01:28:47.517]  They're not masculine anymore.
[01:28:47.517 --> 01:28:48.518]  They look pregnant.
[01:28:48.518 --> 01:28:53.062]  I mean, just walk around and you see men with these bellies and these man boobs walking around.
[01:28:53.062 --> 01:28:57.026]  It's because they have high estrogen levels and low testosterone levels.
[01:28:57.026 --> 01:29:00.630]  So, and this is going, you know, from the 1940s is when this started.
[01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:05.574]  And it all started with the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds because... And you're going to talk about how we counter this coming up.
[01:29:05.574 --> 01:29:07.036]  But I mean, this is the real deal.
[01:29:07.356 --> 01:29:08.438]  This is the real deal.
[01:29:08.438 --> 01:29:15.786]  It's scary because with the Rockefellers owning Standard Oil and Exxon Mobil and all that, these are all petroleum-based products, right?
[01:29:15.786 --> 01:29:17.608]  So they have to profit from these things.
[01:29:17.608 --> 01:29:21.854]  So why not profit by selling all these plasticizers and everything else?
[01:29:21.854 --> 01:29:22.234]  Stay there.
[01:29:22.234 --> 01:29:22.494]  Stay there.
[01:29:22.494 --> 01:29:22.935]  This is incredible.
[01:29:22.935 --> 01:29:24.437]  You're going to have a floor when we come back.
[01:29:24.437 --> 01:29:26.139]  And I want to say something to everybody out there.
[01:29:26.559 --> 01:29:33.385]  You know when I cover this, all the big establishment liberal publications that are really authoritarian come out and say, Alex is anti-gay.
[01:29:33.385 --> 01:29:36.548]  He's saying the chemicals are making people gay.
[01:29:36.548 --> 01:29:39.250]  Folks, it's making the frogs gay.
[01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:40.811]  Nothing against people.
[01:29:40.811 --> 01:29:42.713]  Folks did stuff back in Rome or whatever.
[01:29:42.713 --> 01:29:45.996]  I'm not saying there aren't people that aren't like this naturally.
[01:29:45.996 --> 01:29:49.058]  The point is, this is being done artificially on purpose.
[01:29:49.058 --> 01:29:49.859]  You should know.
[01:29:49.859 --> 01:29:51.260]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.761]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:56.438]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.683 --> 01:30:03.505]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:30:03.505 --> 01:30:08.649]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:30:08.649 --> 01:30:16.755]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:30:16.755 --> 01:30:21.299]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:30:21.299 --> 01:30:25.102]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:30:25.242 --> 01:30:31.209]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:30:31.209 --> 01:30:34.372]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:30:34.372 --> 01:30:39.518]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high quality storable foods from my Patriot Supply.

[01:31:03.433 --> 01:31:08.440]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:15.631]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:31:15.751 --> 01:31:21.395]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:17.726]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:32:17.726 --> 01:32:22.369]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:32:43.584 --> 01:32:47.927]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:33:13.114 --> 01:33:17.883]  For an InfoWars.com Frontline Report, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.497 --> 01:33:39.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, the information we're about to break down is of the highest import.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.822]  I'm going to give Dr. Group the floor now to walk through this.
[01:33:42.822 --> 01:33:47.345]  But the crew, while he's talking, is searching the terms he's putting out.
[01:33:47.345 --> 01:33:48.405]  Here's the BBC.
[01:33:48.405 --> 01:33:48.706]  U.S.
[01:33:48.706 --> 01:33:51.948]  military pondered Love Not War, a gay bomb.
[01:33:52.668 --> 01:34:02.536]  Chemicals to be sprayed on the men to make them basically have female type reactions to war, to everything.
[01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:11.944]  And again, females have three times the connections on average between left and right hemisphere, which makes them more intuitive, actually smarter in many ways, but not able to focus
[01:34:12.905 --> 01:34:18.668]  And not able to deal with warfare and death and other things or mathematics on average as much as men.
[01:34:18.668 --> 01:34:22.730]  And of course, they just had big studies come out last month on that subject with brain scans.
[01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:24.311]  It's a fact, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:24.311 --> 01:34:24.591]  Okay?
[01:34:24.591 --> 01:34:28.373]  I mean, you don't see world champions that are women at chess ever.
[01:34:28.373 --> 01:34:29.954]  Just like you don't see men having babies.
[01:34:29.954 --> 01:34:32.635]  It's because it's two different deals.
[01:34:32.635 --> 01:34:33.616]  But here it is.
[01:34:33.616 --> 01:34:33.756]  U.S.
[01:34:33.756 --> 01:34:35.457]  military pondered love, not war.
[01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:47.421]  Here's another one, WebMD, that BPA causes in the fetuses of babies hormone levels to create hermaphroditic responses.
[01:34:47.421 --> 01:34:55.584]  And it can actually physically make you have both genitalia, but more often it simply has the brain develop as a quasi-female brain.
[01:34:55.584 --> 01:34:57.024]  This is mainline science!
[01:34:57.024 --> 01:34:58.545]  So these people should not be hated!
[01:34:59.065 --> 01:35:03.808]  I don't get mad because, you know, like I'm some, you know, person all obsessed and uptight.
[01:35:03.808 --> 01:35:06.710]  Oh my gosh, you know, women like women or men like men.
[01:35:06.710 --> 01:35:08.651]  My issue is this has been chemically done.
[01:35:08.651 --> 01:35:09.792]  That's why it's exploding.
[01:35:09.792 --> 01:35:12.253]  That's why women look different now and look like men.
[01:35:12.253 --> 01:35:14.314]  That's why men act like women.
[01:35:14.314 --> 01:35:16.255]  They are women.
[01:35:16.255 --> 01:35:18.297]  They're attracted to men because they're a woman.
[01:35:19.181 --> 01:35:21.342]  And I don't dislike them because of that.
[01:35:21.342 --> 01:35:29.126]  The fact is, though, this is meant, as they said in Brave New World, and as they said in Brave New World Revisited, which is non-fiction, this is the plan.
[01:35:29.126 --> 01:35:32.908]  This is the chemical warfare plan, and this is what these chemicals do.
[01:35:32.908 --> 01:35:34.409]  And folks, this is their plan.
[01:35:34.409 --> 01:35:38.551]  When I talk about this, the establishment media goes completely ape.
[01:35:40.097 --> 01:35:53.017]  When I tell you that if your children drink out of Bisphenol A juice line boxes, the male genitals won't drop as early, they won't develop, they'll have problems, it will rewire the brain and cause sexual responses that are feminine.
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:59.501]  But if you do this to the babies, you will end up with a hybrid male-female.
[01:35:59.501 --> 01:36:08.404]  And that's why that's becoming so incredibly popular, is because this has been chemically done, but it's happening to the other mammals, to the other amphibians, it's happening to fish.
[01:36:08.404 --> 01:36:11.185]  This is the real deal.
[01:36:11.185 --> 01:36:15.126]  They're having fish now that are both sexes, that it's not in that species.
[01:36:15.126 --> 01:36:20.007]  This is happening to, in some cases, two-thirds of the frogs down in Houston are bisexual.
[01:36:21.223 --> 01:36:23.925]  And then the media makes a joke and go, he's making fun of gay people.
[01:36:23.925 --> 01:36:25.346]  Folks, this is being done.
[01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:27.228]  And then that's just the sexualization.
[01:36:27.228 --> 01:36:28.569]  What about the cancer rates?
[01:36:28.569 --> 01:36:34.293]  What about the other problems in the organs?
[01:36:34.293 --> 01:36:36.134]  Dr. Grip, you've got the floor.
[01:36:36.134 --> 01:36:38.096]  Break it down for people.
[01:36:38.096 --> 01:36:44.040]  This eugenics conspiracy against our hormones and what you call Operation Testosterone.
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:44.341]  Go ahead.
[01:36:45.126 --> 01:36:46.488]  Well, there's three points to it.
[01:36:46.488 --> 01:36:48.531]  Number one is they want sterility.
[01:36:48.531 --> 01:36:52.596]  Number two, they want a separation of males and females.
[01:36:52.596 --> 01:36:55.460]  And number three, they want gender manipulation.
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:59.706]  And they're doing gender manipulation by putting these chemicals in while you're in the fetus because
[01:37:00.246 --> 01:37:20.920]  When the brains develop, even if it's a male, let's say, and the hormones aren't correct in the female, if you have all these hormone blockers and endocrine disruptors, and that brain doesn't get what it needs to become masculine, and the children end up, the males end up with genitalia, but they end up with a female brain.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.141]  The genitals are smaller.
[01:37:22.141 --> 01:37:23.422]  The genitals are smaller.
[01:37:23.422 --> 01:37:25.483]  The penis is usually smaller.
[01:37:25.483 --> 01:37:27.684]  They think like a female.
[01:37:30.846 --> 01:37:33.548]  They want to put on dresses and stuff like that.
[01:37:33.548 --> 01:37:37.090]  I mean, this has been proven to happen.
[01:37:37.090 --> 01:37:41.672]  And this is happening on a large scale right now.
[01:37:41.672 --> 01:37:44.233]  There's so many different endocrine disruptors out there.
[01:37:44.233 --> 01:37:50.197]  And that's why California says we've got to let the boys go in whatever bathroom they want because they're being chemically hit.
[01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:51.757]  And the higher level people know this.
[01:37:51.757 --> 01:37:52.398]  It's a program.
[01:37:53.078 --> 01:37:59.600]  I mean, the American Chemical Association came out with the whole plan to ban BPA in baby bottles.
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:04.181]  But it was a diversion technique, because baby bottles was the only thing.
[01:38:04.181 --> 01:38:06.561]  It never really had BPA in it to begin with.
[01:38:06.561 --> 01:38:12.343]  It was a cover-up so they could still use BPA in all the other plastics in everything else.
[01:38:12.343 --> 01:38:14.363]  Lining cans.
[01:38:14.363 --> 01:38:21.665]  I mean, this separation, this feminism, masculinism thing, goes back a long time, even to the fact when they introduced microwaves.
[01:38:22.205 --> 01:38:31.128]  Because phthalates are a toxic endocrine disruptor which makes plastics, it all goes back to plastics too, it makes plastics flexible.
[01:38:31.128 --> 01:38:50.355]  So they come out with microwave ovens so that, you know, and canned foods a long time ago which was planned so women wouldn't have to cook anymore because women were getting, they wanted to get women in the... And on record, the White House Science Center admits this, they then put it into the water, put it into the food chain, put it into the plastics to then reduce the fertility and engage in social engineering.
[01:38:50.655 --> 01:39:00.378]  Yeah, and at the same time, what they're trying to do is separate the family because another part of this whole situation with Operation Testosterone is to separate the family.
[01:39:00.378 --> 01:39:02.399]  They know strong core family values.
[01:39:02.399 --> 01:39:05.900]  When the husband and wife are together, they're having children.
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:08.761]  But whenever you can create disruptions in hormones,
[01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:17.342]  They have higher divorce rates, higher separation rates, when they can say, oh, it's easy to cook now, just throw your canned foods in and the whole thing.
[01:39:17.342 --> 01:39:20.383]  And the woman and the man are activated by the olfactory.
[01:39:20.383 --> 01:39:28.965]  When the men don't have the right chemicals, the woman is not attracted and does not want to merge with the male on a team level.
[01:39:28.965 --> 01:39:35.846]  She's not picking up the things that trigger the ganglia in the brain that then activates the instincts.
[01:39:35.846 --> 01:39:36.886]  This is chemical warfare.
[01:39:36.966 --> 01:39:46.115]  Well, that's exactly right because when they introduced birth control pills, by the way, birth control pills were introduced by the woman that was heading the eugenics program.
[01:39:46.115 --> 01:39:52.341]  When they introduced birth control pills, they knew for a fact that it would alter the way a woman picked the male.
[01:39:52.341 --> 01:39:55.284]  So what happens is you have the women on birth control pills and they
[01:39:55.664 --> 01:39:56.245]  Let's explain.
[01:40:10.666 --> 01:40:15.051]  They're in a pregnant phase, artificially pregnant, the brain believes, on the pills.
[01:40:15.051 --> 01:40:20.096]  They're looking for a male that is more feminine, when actually a woman's on the hunt.
[01:40:20.096 --> 01:40:26.383]  She's looking for a hyper male, but they put him into an artificial system, so they pick a male incorrectly.
[01:40:26.383 --> 01:40:26.964]  That's right.
[01:40:26.964 --> 01:40:30.147]  Which then breeds weak people who are subservient.
[01:40:30.387 --> 01:40:31.968]  Exactly, and they know that too.
[01:40:31.968 --> 01:40:33.669]  So they don't want those strong relationships.
[01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:35.731]  They don't want people, you know, strong families.
[01:40:35.731 --> 01:40:46.758]  They don't want people, you know, having a lot of kids anymore because they know, especially when they can break the family values up, then that's going to alter and affect the children as well.
[01:40:46.758 --> 01:40:50.420]  So the way that they're doing it is they're doing it through birth control pills.
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:52.182]  They're doing it through chemicals in the food.
[01:40:52.182 --> 01:40:54.383]  They're doing it through chemicals in the air.
[01:40:54.383 --> 01:41:00.007]  All of these things that we talk about, heavy metals or endocrine disruptors, aluminum, mercury, lead, cadmium.
[01:41:00.967 --> 01:41:14.134]  All of your cleaning supplies out there, I mean DDT, look at DDT that was used, Agent Orange, all of the pesticides that continually cause endocrine disruption, and all of them really block testosterone and alter the amount of estrogen.
[01:41:14.134 --> 01:41:16.836]  Which I noticed, it's a similar chemical in birds.
[01:41:16.836 --> 01:41:18.917]  I'm not an ornithologist, I forget the name of it.
[01:41:18.917 --> 01:41:26.341]  That's why DDT would actually not just cause thinner shells, but it would also end up making most of the chicks female.
[01:41:27.509 --> 01:41:34.531]  So again, because I guess they're going through a similar hormonal programming once that egg gets fertilized.
[01:41:34.531 --> 01:41:36.232]  Yeah, it's really a sad situation.
[01:41:36.232 --> 01:41:39.633]  I mean, one of the newest things... Why are you against gay birds?
[01:41:39.633 --> 01:41:42.274]  I'm not against... Shouldn't we have everything be sterilized?
[01:41:42.274 --> 01:41:52.317]  I'm against the government trying to control the population and the government trying... I'm just here to try to report my findings just like you so everybody can wake up... Continue going through this because you've got the studies, all of it right there.
[01:41:52.557 --> 01:41:56.581]  Yeah, I mean, one of the latest things, and you know this, is the push for hand sanitizers.
[01:41:56.581 --> 01:41:59.523]  I mean, look at how many hand sanitizers are out there right now.
[01:41:59.523 --> 01:42:00.424]  Guys, search that.
[01:42:00.424 --> 01:42:02.626]  Hand sanitizer sterilizes you.
[01:42:02.626 --> 01:42:03.147]  That's CNN.
[01:42:03.147 --> 01:42:08.432]  Hand sanitizers are alcohol-based and alcohol in itself.
[01:42:08.432 --> 01:42:11.474]  Beer, wine, general alcohol is an endocrine disruptor.
[01:42:11.474 --> 01:42:13.456]  It lowers your testosterone levels.
[01:42:13.456 --> 01:42:15.118]  We've gone to a sedentary lifestyle.
[01:42:15.118 --> 01:42:16.779]  People aren't exercising as much.
[01:42:16.779 --> 01:42:18.281]  That lowers testosterone levels.
[01:42:18.701 --> 01:42:20.802]  Every single thing is part of this plan.
[01:42:20.802 --> 01:42:23.083]  The Rockefellers are the ones that created porn.
[01:42:23.083 --> 01:42:35.830]  If you look at guys now, they want to take guys, these guys that are born with low testosterone levels or they're low testosterone in the fetuses, they're growing up more feminine and they're scared of women.
[01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:37.791]  They're not as masculine enough.
[01:42:37.791 --> 01:42:47.295]  They're just as happy, which is a diversion technique, they're just as happy watching porn and masturbating to porn than they would be if they were going out there and getting women.
[01:42:47.295 --> 01:42:48.296]  And by the way, this is it.
[01:42:48.336 --> 01:42:48.676]  Admit it.
[01:42:48.676 --> 01:43:03.956]  Everything you're saying is in all the studies and they broke that down saying they would popularize porn not to make it fun, you know, as they sell it, but to literally give people a simulator so the real thing doesn't happen and then to also screw up relationships.
[01:43:04.537 --> 01:43:12.541]  And listen to this, it even goes as far as condoms and dildos, because dildos are made... Let's not get too much with the... No, but seriously, it's... Let's just say sexual aids.
[01:43:12.541 --> 01:43:14.582]  Because they can take... Family audience.
[01:43:14.582 --> 01:43:15.923]  Dioxins!
[01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:28.009]  And, I mean, you're putting that inside the woman, so that alone is causing massive disruption of the vaginal canal, massive disruption of the production, natural production of testosterone and estrogen by the ovaries.
[01:43:28.009 --> 01:43:32.271]  And you have the spermicides, which are in condoms, which are also made of plastics, by the way.
[01:43:32.711 --> 01:43:54.080]  And the spermicides nonoxal 9 cause inside the vaginal canal high levels of toxic endocrine disruptors or estrogen testosterone disruptors as well as the male when it soaks into you know the genitalia and then nonoxal 9 turns into endocrine disrupting and hormonal disrupting compounds in the water.
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:44:01.883]  You know all these birth control pills see our tap water is contaminated with all this stuff because all the birth control pills when the women go to the bathroom ends up in our water
[01:44:02.123 --> 01:44:05.286]  And that is just annihilating the aquatic life.
[01:44:05.286 --> 01:44:05.746]  That's right.
[01:44:05.746 --> 01:44:07.647]  So it's annihilating aquatic life.
[01:44:07.647 --> 01:44:11.791]  I mean, there's polar, even as far as the Antarctic up there, they're seeing signs.
[01:44:11.791 --> 01:44:13.672]  And you think, well, they don't eat all this processed food.
[01:44:13.672 --> 01:44:15.013]  They don't have all this up there.
[01:44:15.013 --> 01:44:20.578]  But the water is so contaminated up there that polar bears, actually female polar bears, are growing penises.
[01:44:21.238 --> 01:44:22.119]  I saw that.
[01:44:22.119 --> 01:44:29.045]  In fact, guys, did you find the hand sanitizer article to show folks that that's causing... Okay, show the female polar bears.
[01:44:29.045 --> 01:44:33.048]  And again, you're homophobic because you don't want the female polar bears to grow genitalia.
[01:44:33.048 --> 01:44:34.129]  Male genitalia.
[01:44:34.129 --> 01:44:40.455]  Because that's how... What do you want to say to the so-called progressive media that's going to attack this?
[01:44:40.455 --> 01:44:42.597]  Well, they just don't know what they're talking about.
[01:44:42.597 --> 01:44:43.998]  No, no, science is now homophobic.
[01:44:44.554 --> 01:44:50.217]  Well, of course it's homophobic, but the truth is, I mean, you know, they don't want the truth out there because it's a money thing, okay?
[01:44:50.217 --> 01:45:11.749]  Let's say they have to figure out what to do with all the byproducts of petroleum and everything, so they make money by making people sick by putting all these plasticizers and everything and these petroleum-based products in all your stuff to work through this eugenics program to where you're not going to be able to have kids, you're going to have low testosterone levels, you're going to feel depressed, your hair is going to start falling out, you're not going to have fat around
[01:45:11.749 --> 01:45:12.089]  We're good to go.
[01:45:32.387 --> 01:45:39.473]  So they have every single angle figured out so they can come around and make money and sell you prescription medications, put you on testosterone.
[01:45:39.473 --> 01:45:46.279]  And Viagra, in Viagra itself, Viagra contains phthalates, which are testosterone disruptors.
[01:45:46.279 --> 01:45:50.522]  So they give you Viagra and it disrupts and blocks your testosterone production.
[01:45:50.522 --> 01:45:53.705]  They found the articles about the polar bears' genitals are shrinking.
[01:45:53.705 --> 01:45:54.626]  Well, I mean, what's wrong with that?
[01:45:54.626 --> 01:45:55.647]  We need gay polar bears.
[01:45:57.025 --> 01:46:23.669]  Well, we have a situation where we're just dealing with more, you know, the... No, but I'm saying if you don't like Obamacare, you're a racist, and if you point out that the Pentagon and the globalists are on record adding all this to the food and water to reduce fertility, to screw up society, they're waging war on men and women in natural human relationships, and literally now saying the mere act of being heterosexual is hateful and must be eradicated, and that's the culture
[01:46:24.349 --> 01:46:43.027]  level so it's accepted by the new culture but it's being pushed by those on top who are actually hyper male hyper female to destroy their competition this is an exterminist ultra hitlerian program and uh... it's here now we talk about how we counter this and respond to it because uh... you have developed with us
[01:46:43.667 --> 01:46:46.728]  Super male vitality and we just it had been sold out.
[01:46:46.728 --> 01:46:51.950]  We just got more of this in and compared to its leading competitor that isn't even as good a product.
[01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:59.553]  It is about 40% off and it's also helps fund the operation and because I want to get into talking about super male vitality and the two ounce.
[01:47:00.493 --> 01:47:01.933]  We're good to go.
[01:47:24.779 --> 01:47:32.524]  Quite frankly, I don't even take the regular doses because my brain is wired extremely male, so I don't need that much of it.
[01:47:32.524 --> 01:47:33.524]  But I do like it.
[01:47:33.524 --> 01:47:34.565]  It helps me work out more.
[01:47:34.565 --> 01:47:35.806]  But tell folks about this.
[01:47:36.877 --> 01:47:42.079]  Well, Super Male Vitality was developed because of this situation that we're talking about now.
[01:47:42.079 --> 01:47:46.560]  I mean, every single person needs to help regulate their hormones.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:48:03.586]  I don't want people running out to the doctor's office and getting on all these testosterone patches, all this hormone replacement therapy, which all of it is mixed, you know, the stuff that's mixed in with it is toxic fillers and binders that actually keep your testosterone and keep your estrogen levels out of whack anyway.
[01:48:04.306 --> 01:48:08.869]  So, you know, here you are running and getting all this stuff and it's never fixing the problem.
[01:48:08.869 --> 01:48:12.731]  I'm always about addressing the root cause of the situation and doing it naturally.
[01:48:12.731 --> 01:48:15.893]  I believe everybody has a self-healing mechanism within their body.
[01:48:15.893 --> 01:48:29.841]  My job is to teach you how to avoid these things and how to reactivate your body's own self-healing mechanism, so... And listen, listen, if you like your female brain and you like not being male, then don't take this.
[01:48:29.841 --> 01:48:31.682]  But how does it end up helping women as well?
[01:48:31.682 --> 01:48:33.343]  Because it's the women that really go crazy on this.
[01:48:33.886 --> 01:48:34.667]  Right.
[01:48:34.667 --> 01:48:36.848]  I don't want to tell folks that it has an aphrodisiac effect.
[01:48:36.848 --> 01:48:51.920]  Well, what it does is it stimulates the body's own production of testosterone, growth hormone, DHEA, all the hormone precursors, and it does it by using high-quality therapeutic doses of herbs, and it doesn't shut anything down.
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:55.763]  It doesn't have testosterone in it, you know, because
[01:48:56.664 --> 01:49:09.150]  Let's say if you give a woman estrogen or you give a woman testosterone, well, if you're externally giving them that, then their own body's production over a period of time can shut down because it's in the blood.
[01:49:09.150 --> 01:49:14.552]  So the body says, well, I don't need to produce it because it's already coming in the blood and I can sense it in the blood.
[01:49:15.012 --> 01:49:24.316]  So what this is designed to do is to balance out your hormones naturally and let your body start slowly producing the levels that you need.
[01:49:24.316 --> 01:49:29.058]  Steiner said in just a week he can focus better and he was kind of bummed out, you know, with the winter blues.
[01:49:29.058 --> 01:49:30.158]  He said it's made him happier.
[01:49:30.158 --> 01:49:34.560]  What's the difference between his brain, because, you know, those guys are like all world champion, you know.
[01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:39.175]  Like his brother, uh, steer wrestlers and bull riders and stuff.
[01:49:39.175 --> 01:49:41.998]  So they're already super male, but it's making him happy.
[01:49:41.998 --> 01:49:45.443]  And what's the difference between him being happy and me getting even more aggressive on it?
[01:49:47.014 --> 01:49:53.679]  Well, you know, there have been studies that show that low testosterone can cause aggressiveness.
[01:49:53.679 --> 01:50:00.304]  So, basically what I would say is maybe you need to take it or have your testosterone tested because maybe you don't have enough.
[01:50:00.304 --> 01:50:07.329]  Even though, you know, there's a lot of controversy as whether high testosterone levels really make you aggressive.
[01:50:07.329 --> 01:50:10.772]  I mean, they... Well, I mean, my hair is falling out and I've got hair on my back.
[01:50:12.006 --> 01:50:12.967]  Right, so I don't know.
[01:50:12.967 --> 01:50:15.668]  I don't have any problems either.
[01:50:15.668 --> 01:50:32.976]  I would have to look at your testosterone levels, but another thing that we didn't talk about real fast, and this just bothers me, and for parents out there that have kids that are drinking all the Coca-Colas and stuff, high fructose corn syrup, by the way, which is in everything, there's high levels of atrazine usually in that because the pesticides that spray the corn.
[01:50:32.976 --> 01:50:34.477]  Oh, they admit it's full of pesticides.
[01:50:34.497 --> 01:50:41.503]  High fructose corn syrup will block your kids and your own production and regulation of hormones.
[01:50:41.503 --> 01:50:54.175]  And women out there that are using bleach tampons, get off of those because the tampons are genetically modified cotton and those are also designed to alter your hormone levels when you wear tampons.
[01:50:54.175 --> 01:50:54.855]  Amazing.
[01:50:54.855 --> 01:50:56.937]  It's all social engineering hidden everywhere.
[01:50:56.937 --> 01:50:58.699]  We're going to decode it all on the other side.
[01:51:01.343 --> 01:51:05.146]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.

[01:51:07.227 --> 01:51:13.932]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[01:51:13.932 --> 01:51:19.516]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[01:51:19.516 --> 01:51:22.058]  It's true, and he can email you the test results.

[01:51:49.549 --> 01:51:50.550]  GoBerkey.com, home of the Berkey Guy.
[01:52:00.578 --> 01:52:08.943]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.
[01:52:08.943 --> 01:52:13.465]  It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.
[01:52:13.465 --> 01:52:15.887]  I was exhausted and depleted.
[01:52:15.887 --> 01:52:20.770]  After only three weeks on One World Way, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again.
[01:52:20.770 --> 01:52:23.011]  I feel energized and strong.
[01:52:23.491 --> 01:52:24.972]  This is an amazing product.
[01:52:24.972 --> 01:52:31.454]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its protein content as glutathione.
[01:52:31.454 --> 01:52:34.174]  But due to toxicity and aging, it does not.
[01:52:34.174 --> 01:52:38.456]  Could glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body?
[01:52:38.456 --> 01:52:45.678]  If you restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs, then as a result, your glands and organs work better.
[01:52:45.678 --> 01:52:48.219]  Imagine the quality of life improvement you might have.

[01:54:06.425 --> 01:54:14.337]  We've got to take like an hour-long talk with you to actually go over all the documents all the news articles and really expose the
[01:54:16.730 --> 01:54:17.971]  Estrogen Conspiracy.
[01:54:17.971 --> 01:54:18.932]  It's just incredible.
[01:54:18.932 --> 01:54:35.745]  But Dr. Grube, getting into the other points about what they're bombarding us with and why the Super Mill Vitality Formulation Dietary Supplement that you developed for us is so special for folks and their purchases of it also helped fund the broadcast and everything that we do.
[01:54:35.745 --> 01:54:39.949]  But break down what's in it and what it does and then get into your other scientific facts for people.
[01:54:40.615 --> 01:54:46.618]  Well, you know, the main purpose of it, I didn't even know it was going to work so good for women, really.
[01:54:46.618 --> 01:54:52.301]  I was doing it because of testosterone, but then I realized that women need testosterone, too.
[01:54:52.301 --> 01:55:07.350]  What I did was I just chose the rare herbs that had been scientifically proven to naturally boost your testosterone, like tribulus terrestris, maca, ashwagandha, and a few other things, and put it together in a concentrated formula using a high technology
[01:55:08.391 --> 01:55:11.053]  High Energy Sound Pulse Extraction Technique.
[01:55:11.053 --> 01:55:16.397]  See, because most of the time when you go get tinctures or herbal formulas from the store, they're in alcohol.
[01:55:16.397 --> 01:55:17.759]  Okay?
[01:55:17.759 --> 01:55:20.061]  Well, alcohol is an endocrine disruptor.
[01:55:20.061 --> 01:55:21.962]  You know, why do you want to take herbs and alcohol?
[01:55:21.962 --> 01:55:23.063]  No one's reinvented the wheel.
[01:55:23.063 --> 01:55:29.168]  That's why we started doing stuff in organic vegetable glycerin or USP, you know, kosher certified vegetable glycerin.
[01:55:29.168 --> 01:55:35.454]  And we developed a technique where with alcohol extractions, you're only able to get about 40% of the plant's material.
[01:55:35.914 --> 01:55:42.439]  No, and that leaves out essential oils, that leaves out like real powerful oleoresins and other components of the plant.
[01:55:42.439 --> 01:55:49.624]  And you were saying then it meshes with the glycerin and the alcohol actually kills those key ring structures that are needed for absorption.
[01:55:49.624 --> 01:55:54.247]  Absolutely, and that's why I think more people are going to start going towards glycerin-based compounds.
[01:55:54.247 --> 01:55:56.349]  That's why we have a two-year waiting list for people for
[01:55:56.789 --> 01:56:13.312]  It's for us to do extractions for him because we pioneered this technology on how to actually extract in a cold process and in all glass and pull all these components out into the mixture and do it in a real good therapeutic method that's actually going to make a difference.
[01:56:13.312 --> 01:56:24.934]  I mean you could get an alcohol formula with these same herbs in there and it's not going to be as impotent and it's probably not going to work as good and why would you even get an alcohol you know tincture for you know testosterone when actually that
[01:56:26.354 --> 01:56:39.237]  That's what I want to do, because when I started unraveling this whole eugenics and population control system, starting with pregnant mothers and starting with these generations, and you know what?
[01:56:39.237 --> 01:56:42.118]  We didn't even talk about genetically modified organisms, GMOs.
[01:56:42.118 --> 01:56:48.439]  I mean, they've proven that for four generations after rats have been fed GMOs, that they're sterile.
[01:56:48.439 --> 01:56:50.760]  I mean, they're completely sterile after four generations.
[01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:58.023]  This, what we're going through now, is not something that we need to deal with now, but it's something that's going to affect the future generation.
[01:56:58.023 --> 01:57:00.464]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse.
[01:57:00.464 --> 01:57:03.206]  People think we're unhealthy now, just get ready.
[01:57:03.206 --> 01:57:09.889]  Does filtering your water, taking the proper iodine supplements, getting exercise, and taking Supramel Vitality...
[01:57:10.956 --> 01:57:12.837]  I mean, will that protect you from a lot of this?
[01:57:12.837 --> 01:57:15.638]  Or how else do you mitigate this?
[01:57:15.638 --> 01:57:20.921]  Well, the main thing is you want to avoid the things that are going to cause estrogen dominance, like soy.
[01:57:20.921 --> 01:57:22.562]  You want to avoid any of the plastics.
[01:57:22.562 --> 01:57:24.063]  You want to avoid the pesticides.
[01:57:24.063 --> 01:57:25.403]  Throw away your Roundup, everything.
[01:57:25.403 --> 01:57:27.324]  Wash your fruits and vegetables.
[01:57:27.324 --> 01:57:28.045]  You want to...
[01:57:29.286 --> 01:57:31.208]  Avoid any chemicals and heavy metals.
[01:57:31.208 --> 01:57:32.290]  I mean, it's very easy.
[01:57:32.290 --> 01:57:41.623]  You can take any chemical off of a label and just type it in in Google and put this chemical endocrine disruptor and you'll see if that's an endocrine disruptor.
[01:57:41.623 --> 01:57:43.105]  If it is, don't do it.
[01:57:43.105 --> 01:57:44.927]  This is all part of the soft kill agenda.
[01:57:44.927 --> 01:57:45.528]  Folks, go to...
[01:57:46.209 --> 01:57:54.675]  Infowarslife.com if you want to get the survival shield, the fluoride shield, or the super metal vitality dietary supplement.

[01:58:14.269 --> 01:58:16.511]  He works with some of the other best ones in the country.
[01:58:16.511 --> 01:58:17.591]  He does have his own stuff.
[01:58:17.591 --> 01:58:18.852]  It's some of the top stuff in the country.
[01:58:18.852 --> 01:58:27.419]  I mean, we're blessed to be able to work with Dr. Group and have him develop these proprietary systems for folks and to be able to fund our operations at the same time.
[01:58:27.419 --> 01:58:29.020]  So, super male vitality.
[01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:32.022]  This will really help them with boosting testosterone naturally?
[01:58:32.022 --> 01:58:38.427]  Yeah, right now, 50% of men have low sperm counts and 80% of the sperm... Hold on.
[01:58:38.427 --> 01:58:39.548]  Tell us about that in one minute.
[01:58:39.548 --> 01:58:40.229]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:43.427 --> 01:58:47.398]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.652 --> 01:58:51.673]  The facts are in.
[01:58:51.673 --> 01:58:53.073]  The studies are legion.
[01:58:53.073 --> 01:59:00.597]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:59:00.597 --> 01:59:04.419]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:59:04.419 --> 01:59:04.980]  Simple.
[01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:09.722]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:59:09.722 --> 01:59:15.145]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:59:15.425 --> 01:59:20.972]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[01:59:20.972 --> 01:59:31.424]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:59:31.744 --> 01:59:36.326]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:59:36.326 --> 01:59:38.487]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[01:59:48.452 --> 01:59:53.714]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:53.714 --> 01:59:56.095]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.095 --> 01:59:58.877]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.646 --> 02:00:10.469]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.469 --> 02:00:12.069]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.069 --> 02:00:13.610]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.610 --> 02:00:17.793]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.793 --> 02:00:21.855]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.436 --> 02:00:37.845]  So we've really in the last 45 minutes broken down a lot of informational stuff you can do every day to protect you and your family from the exposure of these endocrine disruptors and these estrogen mimicers that the globalists on record have been putting in the food chain for 60, 70 years.
[02:00:37.845 --> 02:00:42.588]  And now we're just totally bombarded with it by design as a depopulation program.
[02:00:43.410 --> 02:00:45.771]  And it's in the GMO, it's in the fluoride, it's in all of it.
[02:00:45.771 --> 02:00:53.314]  But so much of it is your body, if it doesn't have the good hormones, will then absorb all the fake ones.
[02:00:53.314 --> 02:00:58.696]  So it's just like you take nascent iodine to block the thyroid from getting the radioactive isotopes.
[02:00:58.696 --> 02:01:01.857]  In layman's terms, Dr. Gripp's finishing up some of the key points you've got.
[02:01:02.937 --> 02:01:06.220]  What does this do, super male vitality, to help folks?
[02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:07.161]  Because it certainly works.
[02:01:07.161 --> 02:01:08.582]  I want to promote what works.
[02:01:08.582 --> 02:01:09.542]  We've heard the right reviews.
[02:01:09.542 --> 02:01:10.503]  This is amazing stuff.
[02:01:10.503 --> 02:01:12.284]  And then your other points.
[02:01:12.284 --> 02:01:19.050]  Well, the endocrine glands, talking about what you're talking about, is first of all, hormones regulate practically every reaction in the body.
[02:01:19.050 --> 02:01:22.012]  And your endocrine glands produce hormones.
[02:01:22.012 --> 02:01:25.775]  And that's your thyroid gland, your pituitary gland, your hypothalamus.
[02:01:26.375 --> 02:01:26.836]  I'm good.
[02:01:42.475 --> 02:01:45.338]  All of those glands, so they start working together.
[02:01:45.338 --> 02:01:47.119]  For example, take fluoride.
[02:01:47.119 --> 02:01:49.001]  Fluoride knocks out the thyroid gland.
[02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:52.364]  Thyroid regulates your metabolism.
[02:01:52.364 --> 02:01:55.787]  Fluoride also calcifies the pineal gland.
[02:01:55.787 --> 02:01:59.530]  The pineal gland is another gland that regulates hormones.
[02:01:59.530 --> 02:02:04.315]  So if your complete hormone system in your body is thrown off,
[02:02:04.975 --> 02:02:09.518]  Then you're going to have all kinds of symptoms and you're going to be setting yourself up.
[02:02:09.518 --> 02:02:11.039]  Your immune system's going to be depressed.
[02:02:11.039 --> 02:02:14.902]  You're going to have all these symptoms and then you're going to go to the doctor's office and say, I have all these symptoms.
[02:02:14.902 --> 02:02:19.005]  Your doctor's not going to say, oh well, it's all these hormone disruptors and all these chemicals.
[02:02:19.005 --> 02:02:22.107]  They're going to say, oh no, let's put you on statins and you're high cholesterol.
[02:02:22.107 --> 02:02:26.010]  Listen, I have the news articles where you know, three, four year olds in England and the U.S.
[02:02:26.010 --> 02:02:27.411]  are going into puberty, girls and boys.
[02:02:27.771 --> 02:02:28.151]  Yes.
[02:02:28.151 --> 02:02:33.814]  And when they bring a little girl in, they don't say get them off all this GMO, get them off the processed stuff, get them off the microwave things.
[02:02:33.814 --> 02:02:35.135]  The doctors aren't even taught that.
[02:02:35.135 --> 02:02:43.160]  They give them hormones to then suppress that, and then the children end up getting all these other diseases where their glands never develop.
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:44.941]  What's that disease where your glands just shut down?
[02:02:47.099 --> 02:02:49.341]  I forget the name, but the point is, that's what it's giving them.
[02:02:49.341 --> 02:02:50.802]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:02:50.802 --> 02:02:51.123]  Yeah.
[02:02:51.123 --> 02:02:54.025]  The doctor doesn't go, why is a four-year-old having a period?
[02:02:54.025 --> 02:02:56.107]  They just go, here, here's hormones to stop that.
[02:02:56.107 --> 02:02:56.327]  Right.
[02:02:56.327 --> 02:02:57.729]  Well, obviously, it's hormones doing it.
[02:02:57.729 --> 02:03:02.093]  I mean, the fish, the birds, they're going into puberty early.
[02:03:02.093 --> 02:03:06.677]  It's a really, really big issue, and that's why, that's why I actually... This is the biggest issue.
[02:03:06.677 --> 02:03:07.838]  It's a giant conspiracy.
[02:03:07.878 --> 02:03:16.700]  I mean, and they're even doing artificial sperm now over in Europe because they think that in the next 10 to 15 years, look at all the interim, look at, nobody can get pregnant anymore.
[02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:19.501]  I mean, there's so many miscarriages because of the chemicals.
[02:03:19.501 --> 02:03:23.362]  There's, you know, these fertility clinics popping up everywhere.
[02:03:23.362 --> 02:03:30.563]  You know, there might be in the future the point where you have to have artificial sperm and, you know, they might, it's going to all go.
[02:03:30.563 --> 02:03:31.344]  No, no, no, no.
[02:03:31.344 --> 02:03:32.964]  The globalists admit that's the plan.
[02:03:32.964 --> 02:03:36.745]  They said this Huxley before he died said the plan is wreck everybody where they can.
[02:03:37.265 --> 02:03:41.869]  Have children, then they're going to come in and have designer babies where they can build in what they want.
[02:03:41.869 --> 02:03:45.371]  You know, they put Trojan horses in the Ford truck to track you.
[02:03:45.371 --> 02:03:47.113]  They put Trojan horses in the cell phone.
[02:03:47.113 --> 02:03:51.136]  These are Trojan horses in these babies already being created with three parents.
[02:03:52.091 --> 02:03:54.593]  It's epigenetics, and it's going on right now.
[02:03:54.593 --> 02:03:59.515]  I mean, they're doing it in a secret way just by utilizing all these chemicals to change our codes.
[02:03:59.515 --> 02:04:06.039]  When we eat genetically modified foods, that messes with our... Let's call the special on the news tonight.
[02:04:06.039 --> 02:04:06.900]  I may even do the interview.
[02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:07.680]  This is too important.
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:11.623]  I wish... I've got a great guest coming up on the Obama dictatorship, but I mean, I...
[02:04:12.803 --> 02:04:14.424]  I want to do an hour special with you.
[02:04:14.424 --> 02:04:23.308]  We can print off all the articles, show it, and show their quotes and stuff, because if we tape it maybe today, maybe we can have it for a week and go back and find all the quotes, even more documents.
[02:04:23.308 --> 02:04:28.150]  Almost make a documentary to just hammer everyone with this, because this is the big issue.
[02:04:28.150 --> 02:04:32.211]  It's a secret chemical biological warfare program altering humans.
[02:04:32.211 --> 02:04:33.132]  It's Brave New World.
[02:04:33.132 --> 02:04:40.035]  We need to come out with a list and say, okay, these are the top 20 things that you need to avoid, and this is what you need to do to reverse this.
[02:04:40.815 --> 02:04:44.097]  But first, exactly, let them know there's a program to do this.
[02:04:44.097 --> 02:04:44.717]  They have to know.
[02:04:44.717 --> 02:04:46.358]  This is real, folks.
[02:04:46.358 --> 02:04:49.820]  I mean, the globalists are social engineers to the max.
[02:04:49.820 --> 02:04:51.841]  They're already on TV saying your kids belong to them.
[02:04:51.841 --> 02:04:54.222]  Well, they're 50 light years ahead of that, folks.
[02:04:54.222 --> 02:04:56.723]  They are jacking with everything.
[02:04:56.723 --> 02:04:58.664]  We told you about the NSA and it all came out.
[02:04:58.664 --> 02:04:59.745]  This is a real deal.
[02:05:00.703 --> 02:05:05.427]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:05:05.427 --> 02:05:08.529]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:05:08.529 --> 02:05:14.093]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:05:14.093 --> 02:05:16.035]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:05:16.035 --> 02:05:17.676]  We are what we eat.
[02:05:17.676 --> 02:05:22.340]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:26.563]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:05:26.563 --> 02:05:28.825]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:05:29.105 --> 02:05:35.328]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:07:03.317 --> 02:07:08.320]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:15.506]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:07:15.646 --> 02:07:21.271]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[02:07:57.364 --> 02:07:58.024]  Are you?
[02:07:58.024 --> 02:07:59.165]  InfoWarshop.com
[02:08:11.602 --> 02:08:17.829]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.831 --> 02:08:39.220]  Everything our rogue government is doing is part of a larger global corporate standardization away from checks and balances and liberty and towards a global autocratic neo-feudalistic state.
[02:08:39.220 --> 02:08:46.004]  And almost all historians, political scientists, constitutional lawyers agree.
[02:08:46.004 --> 02:08:53.449]  They just had the head of a large international bank, we covered this a few days ago, go public and said we're collapsing into authoritarianism in the West.
[02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:57.183]  And the rest of the world's already been under it forever.
[02:08:57.183 --> 02:09:03.490]  It's only the Renaissance and things the last 500 years that has given any semblance to the idea of freedom.
[02:09:03.490 --> 02:09:07.013]  It's not that our Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights gives us rights.
[02:09:07.013 --> 02:09:12.900]  It states eloquently the rights of organic freedom that is already there for all humans.
[02:09:14.898 --> 02:09:23.709]  And so, it never delivered the utopia, but it came further than any other system, and is the best model out there in my humble view.
[02:09:23.709 --> 02:09:27.574]  Senator Ted Cruz has come out and called the president dangerous and terrifying.
[02:09:27.574 --> 02:09:32.140]  And the media is like, oh my gosh, that's so mean, that type of rhetoric.
[02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:33.321]  Well, it is what it is.
[02:09:33.962 --> 02:09:39.805]  There is total autocratic authoritarian rule by executive order, the likes of which we've never seen.
[02:09:39.805 --> 02:09:48.450]  And if there isn't a pushback and a reversal, it will set the precedent on guns, on borders, on the IRS persecuting political enemies.
[02:09:48.450 --> 02:09:51.792]  The FBI has come out and said that their primary mission
[02:09:52.612 --> 02:09:53.853]  Here's the article from last week.
[02:09:53.853 --> 02:10:00.059]  The FBI is a national security agency, drops law enforcement as top priority from its mission.
[02:10:00.059 --> 02:10:12.772]  And that is a political commissar position targeting the Tea Party, gun owners, libertarians, saying it's not Al-Qaeda now in their national security mission, it's gun owners.
[02:10:12.772 --> 02:10:16.936]  This is a criminal foreign corporate takeover that's anti-free market.
[02:10:18.277 --> 02:10:22.178]  It's crony capitalism using socialism to domesticate the population.
[02:10:22.178 --> 02:10:30.780]  And if that idea is not understood and adopted by the opposition to the tyranny, and if we don't get that message out, we'll never win.
[02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:37.722]  The mainline right-wing says all corporations are great, get rid of the borders, blah blah blah, corporate welfare is wonderful.
[02:10:37.722 --> 02:10:43.404]  The left says government's wonderful, Stalin we love you, parents are bad, and then we see that as the opposition.
[02:10:43.404 --> 02:10:46.965]  When the truth is the Republicans, like the governor of New Jersey, are placeholders
[02:10:47.952 --> 02:10:51.134]  To make it look like there's opposition to this authoritarian takeover.
[02:10:51.134 --> 02:10:55.057]  And then they take the moral high ground that they are the authorities.
[02:10:55.057 --> 02:10:56.838]  That they are the progressives.
[02:10:56.838 --> 02:10:58.419]  They are the ones that care.
[02:10:58.419 --> 02:11:04.563]  They are the civil rights activists when they teach your five-year-old how to have sex.
[02:11:04.563 --> 02:11:08.066]  No, these are power-grabbing, megalomaniacal control freaks.
[02:11:08.971 --> 02:11:18.214]  Who are not successful in culture with their ideas, their writings, their music, their art, their courage, their trailblazing, their innovation.
[02:11:18.214 --> 02:11:20.955]  They innovate in gang fraud.
[02:11:20.955 --> 02:11:27.798]  They innovate in kleptocratic, king rat societies of groups.
[02:11:27.798 --> 02:11:29.438]  They are the plague.
[02:11:29.438 --> 02:11:31.279]  They are the cancer.
[02:11:31.279 --> 02:11:35.740]  They are the anathema threat to all that is good.
[02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:36.841]  I mean, there's no way to describe it.
[02:11:37.577 --> 02:11:41.522]  And what Ted Cruz has said is, you are evil, you are dangerous, you are a tyrant.
[02:11:41.522 --> 02:11:43.425]  People are like, man, that's really radical.
[02:11:43.425 --> 02:11:46.289]  Yeah, it's radical and it's true.
[02:11:46.289 --> 02:11:48.111]  Him saying it isn't what did it.
[02:11:48.111 --> 02:11:49.513]  It's already there.
[02:11:49.513 --> 02:11:51.015]  It's already going on.
[02:11:51.015 --> 02:11:52.558]  It's already happening.
[02:11:52.558 --> 02:11:53.799]  You just have to admit it.
[02:11:54.639 --> 02:12:02.122]  And then decide if you want to live in a progressively worse, progressively more authoritarian, progressively oppressive system.
[02:12:02.122 --> 02:12:03.983]  You're like, well I haven't done anything wrong.
[02:12:03.983 --> 02:12:05.464]  That's not how tyrannies work.
[02:12:05.464 --> 02:12:06.644]  They come after you.
[02:12:06.644 --> 02:12:11.506]  Has a gazelle done anything wrong when a lion grabs it and eats it?
[02:12:11.506 --> 02:12:16.308]  Did those kids that Jeffrey Dahmer grabbed and tortured, did they do anything wrong?
[02:12:16.308 --> 02:12:19.150]  Did the people killed by the Nazi Germans, did they do anything wrong?
[02:12:19.150 --> 02:12:20.030]  No, most of them didn't do anything.
[02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:24.893]  Did the tens of millions killed by the Russians under communism, did anything wrong?
[02:12:24.893 --> 02:12:27.535]  No!
[02:12:27.535 --> 02:12:30.858]  It's like in Goldfinger, he says, you expect me to talk?
[02:12:30.858 --> 02:12:34.722]  James Bond does, and he goes, no Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!
[02:12:36.826 --> 02:12:39.529]  You're being culturally overwritten.
[02:12:39.529 --> 02:12:40.871]  The family's being broken up.
[02:12:40.871 --> 02:12:50.123]  Joining us for the balance of the hour, for the last 15 minutes or so, I may even do some overdrive, with Jakari Jackson and others out there on the radiation in California increasing.
[02:12:50.123 --> 02:12:51.364]  They've got some good news.
[02:12:51.364 --> 02:12:53.887]  In most areas, it's only increased slightly from Fukushima.
[02:12:54.915 --> 02:12:56.856]  But Elizabeth Price Foley joins us.
[02:12:56.856 --> 02:12:59.896]  She is a founding member of FIU College of Law.
[02:12:59.896 --> 02:13:02.957]  She teaches constitutional law, civil procedure, and health care law.
[02:13:02.957 --> 02:13:05.838]  She's admitted to practice in Florida, Texas, and before the U.S.
[02:13:05.838 --> 02:13:07.018]  Supreme Court.
[02:13:07.018 --> 02:13:14.320]  The professor is an author of Liberty for All, excellent book, reclaiming individual privacy in the era of public morality.
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:19.262]  The Law and Life and Death, the Tea Party, Three Principles.
[02:13:19.262 --> 02:13:21.863]  And we appreciate her joining us.
[02:13:21.863 --> 02:13:24.945]  ElizabethPriceFoley.com is her website.
[02:13:24.945 --> 02:13:33.008]  And she's going to break down Obama's power grab and how would she, a law professor, constitutional lawyer, how would she define it?
[02:13:33.008 --> 02:13:38.851]  And then what are the remedies when we are faced with a true tyrannous?
[02:13:38.851 --> 02:13:41.012]  Thank you so much for coming on, Professor.
[02:13:41.012 --> 02:13:41.792]  Oh, thanks, Alex.
[02:13:41.792 --> 02:13:43.253]  I appreciate you having me today.
[02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:46.901]  Well, what are we facing as a culture, as a society?
[02:13:46.901 --> 02:13:47.542]  What do we do?
[02:13:47.542 --> 02:13:50.583]  Go over the laundry list and then how we counter this.
[02:13:50.583 --> 02:13:55.765]  Yeah, you know, I mean, this president seems sort of hell-bent on violating the Constitution.
[02:13:55.765 --> 02:14:13.272]  I will say this, you know, we all learn sort of in grade school, right, the basic idea of separation of powers, that we have a legislative branch that makes the laws, and then we learn that the president has a duty under the Constitution, an Article 2, to faithfully execute.
[02:14:14.032 --> 02:14:27.236]  I think he missed that week in school because he's been doing a lot of things that other presidents simply have not had the boldness to do or the audacity to do.
[02:14:27.236 --> 02:14:30.157]  So let's take some of the big ones.
[02:14:30.157 --> 02:14:33.298]  His big signature legislative achievement, Obamacare, right?
[02:14:33.948 --> 02:14:43.571]  There's at least five major things that the President has done to effect essentially a unilateral amendment of those laws.
[02:14:43.571 --> 02:14:47.392]  He's not faithfully executing Obamacare as written.
[02:14:47.392 --> 02:14:51.273]  He's changing it with sort of the swipe of a magisterial pen.
[02:14:51.273 --> 02:14:56.535]  So, you know, one thing he did, he delayed these out-of-pocket caps.
[02:14:57.162 --> 02:14:57.623]  That's great.
[02:15:18.145 --> 02:15:26.568]  Um, then he's got this, uh, this recent thing about a month ago where he decides, you know, he told everybody, if you like your insurance, you can keep it.
[02:15:26.568 --> 02:15:31.150]  Well, it turns out that that's not true and about six million Americans are losing their coverage.
[02:15:31.150 --> 02:15:33.391]  So in the political, he got turned up on that one.
[02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:35.011]  He said, well, you know what I'll do?
[02:15:35.011 --> 02:15:41.153]  I'll just say that a lot of people whose health insurance gets canceled don't have to buy health insurance.
[02:15:41.153 --> 02:15:43.814]  They don't have to abide by the individual mandate.
[02:15:43.814 --> 02:15:45.935]  I'm going to, I'm going to give them a hardship exception.
[02:15:46.872 --> 02:15:48.914]  So he changed that.
[02:15:48.914 --> 02:16:02.544]  And then he's got this thing that the law is crystal clear, for example, that the only employers who have to pay the tax penalty and the only people who are entitled to the tax credit are people who buy their health insurance through state exchanges.
[02:16:02.544 --> 02:16:04.085]  And that was purposeful by Congress.
[02:16:04.085 --> 02:16:13.392]  They did that because they wanted to, you know, incentivize states to run their own exchanges rather than relying on some monolithic, horrible healthcare.gov, which we ended up with.
[02:16:14.293 --> 02:16:17.976]  And he said, well, you know, I'm going to change that unilaterally too by regulation.
[02:16:17.976 --> 02:16:25.202]  I'm going to say you're going to, all of the requirements of law are going to apply whether you buy your health insurance through the state exchanges or our horrible federal exchange.
[02:16:25.751 --> 02:16:33.998]  And so what is that when he shuts down the power plants without congressional approval and he sends in military without congressional approval and puts them under NATO command and on and on and on?
[02:16:33.998 --> 02:16:37.721]  I mean, is that not the office becoming dictatorial?
[02:16:37.721 --> 02:16:40.903]  And isn't Ted Cruz right, calling it dangerous and terrifying?
[02:16:40.903 --> 02:16:43.205]  Yeah, I think Ted Cruz is 100% right.
[02:16:43.205 --> 02:16:47.028]  I mean, this is, if it's not dictatorial, it's darn close to it.
[02:16:47.028 --> 02:16:49.010]  It's the closest I think we've ever seen in this country.
[02:16:49.851 --> 02:17:00.738]  Well sure, and it stops the political will to take the wind out of ourselves to repeal the whole stinking thing by him selectively backing off so that we don't get upset and get the will.
[02:17:00.738 --> 02:17:05.562]  I mean this is a very crafty, whispering in the ear way of strangling this country.
[02:17:06.317 --> 02:17:15.801]  Yeah, I mean, it's his way of saying, you know, especially to the Democrats who are going to be facing tough elections in a couple of years, you know, I'm going to throw you a bone.
[02:17:15.801 --> 02:17:18.361]  I'm going to unilaterally change this law.
[02:17:18.361 --> 02:17:25.884]  I know I'm not enforcing it as written like I'm constitutionally supposed to do, but I want to try to help you in your elections by sort of alleviating the harshness of the law.
[02:17:25.884 --> 02:17:28.965]  The President doesn't have the power constitutionally to do this.
[02:17:28.965 --> 02:17:33.247]  I mean, frankly, this is an impeachable offense, but nobody has the courage to say that.
[02:17:34.005 --> 02:17:37.788]  Well Julius Caesar acted like a dictator for a while before he officially came one.
[02:17:37.788 --> 02:17:41.750]  And again, I believe the establishment wants dictatorial centralized power.
[02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:43.131]  They want that all over the world.
[02:17:43.131 --> 02:17:47.194]  It's easier to buy off one group than a whole Congress and the states and the rest of it.
[02:17:47.194 --> 02:17:50.276]  So I'm not saying Obama is going to be a dictator.
[02:17:50.276 --> 02:17:59.742]  I'm saying he is setting the precedent for future presidents to really actually become a physical dictator and a dictatorship of the bureaucracy.
[02:17:59.742 --> 02:18:01.023]  Do you agree with that statement, Professor?
[02:18:01.681 --> 02:18:02.322]  Absolutely.
[02:18:02.322 --> 02:18:07.447]  I mean, I think that the problem here, for example, is that Democrats like what the President is doing.
[02:18:07.447 --> 02:18:12.251]  It is in accord with their policy preferences and their own political hides.
[02:18:12.251 --> 02:18:22.921]  And so, not only do they like what he's doing and they aren't complaining about it, so we'll never get any, you know, the Senate, for example, to ever impeach him or even seriously consider it, but they're actually encouraging the President to do more of it.
[02:18:22.921 --> 02:18:28.026]  I mean, there was a recent group of Democratic members of Congress who wrote a letter to the President
[02:18:32.028 --> 02:18:35.049]  Well, Professor, that's a new drumbeat.
[02:18:35.049 --> 02:18:38.951]  As you said, he set it up where I can't just act outside the Constitution.
[02:18:38.951 --> 02:18:40.132]  Then it's like, well, I may have to.
[02:18:40.132 --> 02:18:42.593]  And now he's like, I'm going to do whatever I need to.
[02:18:42.593 --> 02:18:48.176]  And they've got pundits on MSNBC and CNN every week now saying he needs to just do whatever he wants.
[02:18:48.669 --> 02:19:02.500]  Yeah, they're applauding, and what they don't realize is that it's so short-sighted because, you know, frankly, I don't want Republican presidents to disregard the Constitution either, so I don't want to set a precedent where a future Republican president behaves in the same unconstitutional way.
[02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:05.022]  This is a very dangerous precedent to be setting.
[02:19:05.731 --> 02:19:09.316]  We're going to go to Brighton and come back, and I want to talk about solutions and other key points you want to make.
[02:19:09.316 --> 02:19:14.243]  I mean, I've got a lot of questions to ask you, but what are some of the other areas you're going to cover when we come back, Professor?
[02:19:14.243 --> 02:19:21.773]  Yeah, I'll talk a little bit about what he's been doing, you know, gutting the Welfare Reform Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, our controlled substances law.
[02:19:21.773 --> 02:19:22.534]  There's a whole slew of
[02:19:24.019 --> 02:19:30.505]  So he's literally legislating from the executive by re-comboing these huge laws any way he wants.
[02:19:30.505 --> 02:19:37.471]  I mean, it's like having a set of Legos and the law is the map of how they're supposed to be put together.
[02:19:37.471 --> 02:19:40.633]  He throws the directions away and just builds whatever he wants.
[02:19:40.633 --> 02:19:40.814]  That's...
[02:19:41.474 --> 02:19:44.895]  That is a very sophisticated dictator 2.0 is what it is.
[02:19:44.895 --> 02:19:48.617]  We'll be right back with our guest on the other side, Elizabeth Price Foley.
[02:19:48.617 --> 02:19:51.898]  She is a law professor, constitutional lawyer.
[02:19:51.898 --> 02:19:57.860]  Straight ahead as we examine our dictatorial, autocratic, imperial state.

[02:23:56.798 --> 02:24:02.043]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:24:02.043 --> 02:24:04.845]  Our sites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:24:24.804 --> 02:24:31.188]  We're going to get into solutions with her in the next segment, but continuing with the so-called abuse of power, it's much worse than that.
[02:24:31.188 --> 02:24:45.877]  Everything they've been doing is systematic to set the precedent that he can serve as a UN Security Council head that violates Article 1, Section 9, that he can launch military operations and fund Al-Qaeda and say that he got the authority from NATO.
[02:24:45.877 --> 02:24:46.978]  Not even from himself!
[02:24:46.978 --> 02:24:47.859]  That's even worse!
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:53.062]  On the treason scale, saying a foreign group gave him authority.
[02:24:53.062 --> 02:24:56.024]  So we've really entered into some crazy times.
[02:24:56.024 --> 02:24:58.605]  MSNBC pundit calls on Obama to govern by decree.
[02:24:58.605 --> 02:25:04.609]  A few weeks ago there was testimony in Congress by constitutional lawyers on the left and the right.
[02:25:05.563 --> 02:25:18.309]  And they, we played the clip, said there isn't much further to sink here, and that we were in danger of the form of government failing, and then they talked about only an armed revolution to counter it.
[02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:22.971]  I want to talk about some of the other abuses, but how do you counter something like this, Professor?
[02:25:23.939 --> 02:25:25.822]  Well, it's a very good question.
[02:25:25.822 --> 02:25:39.280]  I mean, the first and most obvious one would be impeachment, but with a Democrat-controlled Senate and Democrats seeming to like what the President is doing and blessing it, that seems the near impossibility because it would take two-thirds of the Senate to convict.
[02:25:40.295 --> 02:25:41.556]  So that's not going to happen.
[02:25:41.556 --> 02:25:47.761]  If you take that check and balance off the table, really the only other thing we can do is litigate potentially in court.
[02:25:47.761 --> 02:25:56.789]  But there are major impediments to lawsuits going forward against the President to challenge some of these abuses.
[02:25:56.789 --> 02:25:58.030]  So what does that leave us?
[02:25:58.030 --> 02:26:01.653]  You've got Homeland Security gearing up to crush political opposition.
[02:26:01.653 --> 02:26:05.716]  This looks like a premeditated authoritarian takeover.
[02:26:06.676 --> 02:26:07.777]  Yeah, it could be.
[02:26:07.777 --> 02:26:14.082]  I mean, you know, one of the big problems, people ask me all the time, well, why can't we just sue the President for violating the Constitution?
[02:26:14.082 --> 02:26:20.286]  It sounds so simple, but unfortunately the law, as the Supreme Court's developed it over the years, has become very complex on this.
[02:26:20.286 --> 02:26:28.332]  And one of the big, sort of geeky, technical things that is demanded now to bring a lawsuit is this thing called standing.
[02:26:28.332 --> 02:26:31.634]  And it sounds very obscure, but standing is pretty simple.
[02:26:31.634 --> 02:26:34.877]  It says that if you're the plaintiff, that you're initiating the lawsuit,
[02:26:35.277 --> 02:26:43.042]  You have to prove to the court that you've got a very particularized, very individual injury that you're suffering.
[02:26:43.042 --> 02:26:46.184]  So think about what some of these things that President Obama is doing.
[02:26:46.184 --> 02:26:50.086]  He's delaying various portions of Obamacare.
[02:26:50.086 --> 02:26:55.570]  He is deciding not to deport certain young people.
[02:26:55.570 --> 02:27:00.353]  He's giving waivers to the states so they don't have to comply with the No Child Left Behind law.
[02:27:00.353 --> 02:27:04.155]  All of these types of actions by the President, remember he styles them
[02:27:04.275 --> 02:27:09.036]  But they create the acts and then come and shield you selectively from their own operation.
[02:27:09.036 --> 02:27:09.717]  Isn't that the essence?
[02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:38.357]  of discrimination and authoritarianism when they bring in oppressive laws and then the dictator selectively enforces it so you're now under a basic new royalty where if you have a letter of mark you're allowed to operate but if you're not given the grace of the license the licensure now you're a slave.
[02:27:38.882 --> 02:27:40.444]  That's precisely it, you see.
[02:27:40.444 --> 02:27:54.102]  So by taking all of these benevolent acts and sort of waiving, you know, the law and exempting and granting privileges to certain people that they don't have to abide by the law, or at least they don't have to abide by it for another year or two or however many years he decides,
[02:27:54.802 --> 02:28:00.470]  Then he is not injuring anyone in the way that someone would have standing to sue him.
[02:28:00.470 --> 02:28:11.785]  So you cannot get the courts to open up their doors to hear these lawsuits because he's basically acting like the King of England used to act in granting privileges or exemptions from law.
[02:28:12.901 --> 02:28:28.068]  So it's a very difficult technical legal problem that is really going to, if the court doesn't find a way to open up the standing rules to allow some of these lawsuits to go forward, then the president could really take advantage of it.
[02:28:28.068 --> 02:28:30.709]  Not just President Obama, but future presidents as well.
[02:28:30.709 --> 02:28:34.011]  And that's really going to threaten the separation of powers.
[02:28:34.531 --> 02:28:40.514]  Well professor, even with a corrupt establishment, do they really want to get rid of all the checks and balances in their power grab?
[02:28:40.514 --> 02:28:45.276]  Because historically that will destroy the very elite that is eroding checks and balances.
[02:28:45.276 --> 02:29:00.502]  They're creating a centralized system that's going to cause huge dictatorial governmental turnover and then the whole mission of the country or the empire will then be about the king's court and capturing that instead of actually having commerce.
[02:29:01.420 --> 02:29:05.703]  Yeah, well, I mean, that is kind of what crony capitalism is all about, if you think about it.
[02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:26.076]  I mean, if you get to the point where the president isn't just a guy who faithfully executes the law the way he's supposed to, but in fact he has sort of near-dictatorial power to waive the law when he thinks it's okay, or when you have political connections to him and you can get such a privilege or a waiver, then that works in favor of the people who have power.
[02:29:26.076 --> 02:29:30.259]  And I think that they see, at least right at the moment, with their perhaps nearsightedness,
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:33.241]  That would be an advantageous system to them.
[02:29:33.241 --> 02:29:33.642]  You're right.
[02:29:33.642 --> 02:29:39.045]  Let's talk about more of the abuses and solutions with the amazing Professor Elizabeth Price Foley that joins us.
[02:29:39.045 --> 02:29:47.431]  But ladies and gentlemen, the system we're going into is 180 degrees the polar opposite of what this country was founded on.
[02:29:47.431 --> 02:29:48.572]  So let's just get that straight.
[02:29:48.572 --> 02:29:50.293]  This is totally un-American.
[02:29:50.293 --> 02:29:51.674]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.674 --> 02:29:54.216]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.216 --> 02:29:56.918]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.947 --> 02:30:11.632]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:30:11.632 --> 02:30:13.693]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:30:13.693 --> 02:30:14.574]  Fluoride!
[02:30:14.574 --> 02:30:16.495]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:30:16.495 --> 02:30:22.798]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:30:23.058 --> 02:30:27.983]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:30:27.983 --> 02:30:34.309]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:36.731]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:30:36.731 --> 02:30:39.674]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:30:39.674 --> 02:30:43.037]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:30:43.157 --> 02:30:48.599]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:48.599 --> 02:30:53.700]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:31:00.902 --> 02:31:09.993]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:31:09.993 --> 02:31:18.103]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:18.383 --> 02:31:23.245]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:23.245 --> 02:31:30.047]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:30.047 --> 02:31:37.129]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:37.449 --> 02:31:37.869]  I don't know.
[02:31:54.167 --> 02:32:01.949]  The facts are in.
[02:32:01.949 --> 02:32:03.350]  The studies are legion.
[02:32:03.350 --> 02:32:10.872]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:32:10.872 --> 02:32:14.693]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:32:14.693 --> 02:32:15.253]  Simple.
[02:32:15.253 --> 02:32:19.635]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:32:19.975 --> 02:32:25.698]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:32:25.698 --> 02:32:42.027]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:32:42.027 --> 02:32:43.848]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[02:32:44.008 --> 02:32:46.589]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[02:32:46.589 --> 02:32:48.750]  I use Fluoride Shield everyday.
[02:32:48.750 --> 02:32:54.313]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:32:54.313 --> 02:32:58.715]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[02:32:58.715 --> 02:32:59.996]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[02:33:11.015 --> 02:33:17.096]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[02:33:17.096 --> 02:33:22.077]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[02:33:22.077 --> 02:33:26.938]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[02:33:26.938 --> 02:33:28.919]  It's not about food.
[02:33:28.919 --> 02:33:31.559]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:33:38.188 --> 02:33:40.329]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:40.329 --> 02:33:44.870]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:46.790]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:49.911]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:49.911 --> 02:33:51.971]  We've got to break out of this comfort zone.
[02:33:51.971 --> 02:33:54.912]  We've got to break out of the trance.
[02:33:54.912 --> 02:34:00.273]  Like Ted Cruz has done and said that Obama is dangerous and terrifying on his power grabs.
[02:34:00.273 --> 02:34:03.154]  Yes, it is dangerous and terrifying.
[02:34:03.154 --> 02:34:07.475]  Especially when you know how evil this political class has gotten and how decadent and disconnected from reality.
[02:34:08.410 --> 02:34:09.811]  And I agree with what Martin Levin said.
[02:34:09.811 --> 02:34:12.914]  He said Obama preparing country for a coup against Constitution.
[02:34:12.914 --> 02:34:13.975]  I don't think he's preparing it.
[02:34:13.975 --> 02:34:15.976]  They're doing it.
[02:34:15.976 --> 02:34:18.018]  And we get too fixated on Obama, folks.
[02:34:18.018 --> 02:34:23.883]  He's just a front man for some very corrupt Chicago Mafia-type people.
[02:34:23.883 --> 02:34:28.106]  And there's a lot of other corporations and power structures that want a power grab.
[02:34:28.106 --> 02:34:30.948]  Look at how Holder got away lying to Congress on Fast and Furious.
[02:34:30.948 --> 02:34:35.933]  Look at, for me, not just the NSA illegal spying and getting caught lying bipartisanly,
[02:34:36.775 --> 02:34:54.120]  But the targeting mainline Tea Party, mainline Christian groups, pro-life groups with criminal IRS probes and harassment and denial of 501c3 and things, selectively, I mean, that is the very ether of tyranny.
[02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:55.601]  That's how Nazi Germany started.
[02:34:55.601 --> 02:34:57.521]  I mean, this is amazing.
[02:34:57.521 --> 02:35:02.023]  And I think the liberal mantle, their fake high ground, is the big problem here.
[02:35:03.157 --> 02:35:05.258]  And I oppose Bush and those power grabs.
[02:35:05.258 --> 02:35:06.138]  We're just rotting.
[02:35:06.138 --> 02:35:07.038]  It's degenerating.
[02:35:07.038 --> 02:35:17.361]  But it has, I've got to say, and most constitutional law scholars I've talked to agree, Obama's probably power grabbed three times more than Bush.
[02:35:17.361 --> 02:35:19.762]  Huge critics of Bush have been on the show and said that.
[02:35:20.489 --> 02:35:22.530]  Huge ones.
[02:35:22.530 --> 02:35:26.131]  Chris Hedges, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the list goes on and on.
[02:35:26.131 --> 02:35:34.795]  And when you realize it only gets worse historically from here, let me ask you that, Professor, and then get into other points and talk about your books and any solutions in the seven or eight minutes we have left.
[02:35:34.795 --> 02:35:39.117]  And I appreciate your time, but we're here marveling at this tyranny.
[02:35:39.117 --> 02:35:42.138]  I mean, how much worse has it been under Obama?
[02:35:42.138 --> 02:35:49.561]  And if it continues to go, I mean, have you seen any historical examples where it reverses itself without some really serious things happening?
[02:35:50.615 --> 02:36:03.908]  Well, I think that with the latter question, it's really hard, you know, once power is taken by government, it's incredibly hard for the people to get it back, sort of, some sort of, you know, revolutionary-type behavior.
[02:36:03.908 --> 02:36:10.675]  I mean, that's just what history has shown, not just in this country, but, you know, throughout history of the civilized world.
[02:36:11.836 --> 02:36:14.679]  So I think that that is a little depressing around the margins.
[02:36:14.679 --> 02:36:19.944]  The important thing is for Americans to stop it before it spins out of control somehow.
[02:36:19.944 --> 02:36:23.887]  And I do believe that President Obama has amplified the pattern.
[02:36:23.887 --> 02:36:31.495]  I mean, it's not as though other presidents haven't taken, you know, constitutionally shady actions before.
[02:36:31.495 --> 02:36:35.539]  Certainly President Lincoln, when he suspended habeas corpus back in the Civil War.
[02:36:36.299 --> 02:36:38.661]  Uh, probably acted unconstitutionally.
[02:36:38.661 --> 02:36:51.191]  Uh, you know, FDR, uh, with his court packing plan in the 1930s, uh, really put pressure on the Supreme Court to entirely change its interpretation of the Constitution so he could get his political way.
[02:36:51.191 --> 02:36:54.774]  Uh, and that was, uh, you know, marginal behavior at best.
[02:36:55.514 --> 02:37:02.280]  Uh, but I do think what President Obama is doing is very calculated, uh, in a way that I've never seen before.
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:09.205]  I mean, President Bush, say what you will about him, I actually can't identify any constitutional violations by President Bush.
[02:37:09.205 --> 02:37:21.234]  A lot of people don't like what he did with spending, but every, you know, for example, uh, uh, approving a Part D of Medicare, which is the prescription drug benefit, very expensive benefit, big expansion of Medicare.
[02:37:21.234 --> 02:37:23.376]  Uh, he championed that, but you know what?
[02:37:23.376 --> 02:37:24.957]  That was an exercise of the spending power.
[02:37:25.037 --> 02:37:25.297]  I think so.
[02:37:41.958 --> 02:37:48.542]  Uh, the Patriot Act, uh, and the FISA Act, and so those are, again, are laws that the President was simply executing.
[02:37:48.542 --> 02:37:53.004]  Uh, President Obama's doing something totally different that we've never seen before.
[02:37:53.004 --> 02:38:06.252]  He's taking laws that have been passed by Congress that say, thou shalt do X, like, you know, implement various provisions of Obamacare, but on January 1, 2014, the statute says that specifically, and he says, no.
[02:38:07.012 --> 02:38:08.795]  I don't think so.
[02:38:08.795 --> 02:38:14.822]  And so, what he's doing is much more bold, and he's doing it at a much faster pace.
[02:38:14.822 --> 02:38:18.187]  And the question is now, legally, how do we fight back?
[02:38:20.233 --> 02:38:29.261]  Well, there is the Court of Public Opinion, and I think it's essential to start referring to the executive branch as the rogue government.
[02:38:29.261 --> 02:38:33.125]  Obviously, Congress has got a 6% approval rating themselves.
[02:38:33.125 --> 02:38:37.448]  I mean, I think we have to really come to the fact that we have a broken political class that are criminals on average.
[02:38:38.449 --> 02:38:44.692]  Uh, and we need to withdraw consent from the entire system and basically let it collapse like the Soviet Union.
[02:38:44.692 --> 02:38:48.074]  I think that's probably the most bloodless way to go.
[02:38:48.074 --> 02:38:56.337]  Homeland Security intends to just have a Tea Party rebellion that they stir up or stage and then have some type of decisive victory against domestic groups.
[02:38:56.337 --> 02:39:04.061]  It's a nightmare scenario, but that seems to be what they're preparing for at the Pentagon, which is totally waking up the military because they're training to take on patriots.
[02:39:05.242 --> 02:39:17.533]  This is just a mess with a bunch of autocratic communists and socialists with corporate paymasters running things and you have the Marxist instinctive need to attack anything decent at the core of the liberal ideology.
[02:39:17.533 --> 02:39:22.899]  We are just in a mess and I just wish all these camp followers of collectivism
[02:39:24.096 --> 02:39:31.903]  Would not use Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged as an instruction manual or 1984 as an instruction manual.
[02:39:31.903 --> 02:39:36.928]  And I hope that when they do put a Republican in as the backlash to this, that we don't let them turn into a tyrant.
[02:39:36.928 --> 02:39:39.190]  I mean, this is just a mess.
[02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:43.975]  And I think, Professor Foley, it's key to just expose historically what brought us to this point.
[02:39:45.669 --> 02:40:00.108]  Yeah, I agree with you completely and I would tell you if there's one thing that we can do to stem this tide before things do spin out of control in an Ayn Rand or a 1984 scenario is to, you know, take back the Senate.
[02:40:01.209 --> 02:40:07.193]  In 2014, that would be the quickest, most efficient way to handle this.
[02:40:07.193 --> 02:40:14.578]  Then if we needed to impeach, we would possibly get some brethren on the Democrat side to help us and get the two-thirds.
[02:40:14.578 --> 02:40:20.602]  But at a minimum, we might be able to push back legislatively and unroll some of these laws.
[02:40:21.257 --> 02:40:28.221]  Well, I was talking to somebody who actually knew the real character that the Wolf of Wall Street's about, and they were telling me how that's nothing.
[02:40:28.221 --> 02:40:30.402]  I mean, look at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.
[02:40:30.402 --> 02:40:35.785]  Look at JPMorgan and these deals, you know, with these Bernie Madoff-type scams.
[02:40:35.785 --> 02:40:37.706]  And you look at how they act in that movie.
[02:40:37.706 --> 02:40:38.647]  That's real.
[02:40:38.647 --> 02:40:45.751]  The crazy, wild, arrogant, con artist streak that has infected not just the good old boys, but the whole power structure.
[02:40:46.607 --> 02:40:49.269]  And they're now trying to start wars with Russia and everything else.
[02:40:49.269 --> 02:40:51.931]  I mean, these people are going to destroy us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:51.931 --> 02:40:54.674]  And they have a rational exuberance.
[02:40:54.674 --> 02:41:00.018]  They've taken the American people's lethargy as a green light to go crazy.
[02:41:00.018 --> 02:41:02.620]  But what about the power structure itself?
[02:41:02.620 --> 02:41:05.322]  Believing their own propaganda.
[02:41:05.322 --> 02:41:07.024]  Being arrogant about all this.
[02:41:07.024 --> 02:41:08.224]  Laughing about all this.
[02:41:09.365 --> 02:41:13.710]  Uh, bragging about, you know, how all Ford's watching everything you do with the police.
[02:41:13.710 --> 02:41:15.872]  Ha ha ha with the black boxes in your car.
[02:41:15.872 --> 02:41:20.516]  And then you look at the photo and the image of that executive and he just looks like a power crazed nut.
[02:41:20.516 --> 02:41:24.200]  These people are destroying their own futures.
[02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:30.426]  They are, they are, they are releasing evil into the world that we know is, is incredibly destructive.
[02:41:30.426 --> 02:41:33.309]  And they believe because they buy into it, it gives them power over it.
[02:41:34.153 --> 02:41:42.200]  And they are energized with criminal energy, if you study criminology, and they're getting off on the bad deeds.
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:44.261]  And that is incredibly destructive.
[02:41:44.261 --> 02:41:48.725]  We need to have a major reform, and we need smarter members of the establishment.
[02:41:48.725 --> 02:41:49.926]  We need grassroots change.
[02:41:49.926 --> 02:41:59.654]  But I believe the revolution can also happen within the power structure, coming to their senses and realizing that they're going to destroy their own futures as well.
[02:42:01.448 --> 02:42:04.050]  Yeah, you know, and we're starting to see some hope here.
[02:42:04.050 --> 02:42:05.891]  I mean, there is some optimism.
[02:42:05.891 --> 02:42:06.972]  I believe in this country.
[02:42:06.972 --> 02:42:09.634]  I believe in the intelligence of the American people.
[02:42:09.634 --> 02:42:17.920]  One of the reasons why I wrote my Tea Party book, for example, was that even though I first held the view of the mainstream media that they were a bunch of kooks,
[02:42:18.660 --> 02:42:25.766]  I decided to go to some of their meetings and decide for myself, and what I found out is that they're ordinary Americans who actually care about the Constitution.
[02:42:25.766 --> 02:42:26.707]  They want to read about it.
[02:42:26.707 --> 02:42:27.788]  They want to learn it.
[02:42:27.788 --> 02:42:28.949]  I think that's encouraging.
[02:42:28.949 --> 02:42:43.902]  They've elected great people like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and I think that those young sort of Turks in the Senate are having an impact and shaking things up, and I think if the American people kind of can stay on top of it, you know, we have a chance.
[02:42:44.562 --> 02:42:45.383]  That's right.
[02:42:45.383 --> 02:42:54.694]  I mean, the power structure wouldn't be demonizing the real Libertarian Constitutional Tea Party and saying it's the main threat in the Republican Democratic leadership.
[02:42:54.694 --> 02:43:00.861]  All the different associations, all the different fake business associations, all the crony groups are absolutely
[02:43:01.341 --> 02:43:06.084]  Scared to death of a libertarian constitutional takeover, because we have a chance.
[02:43:06.084 --> 02:43:07.505]  We have the answers.
[02:43:07.505 --> 02:43:08.966]  We have the prosperity.
[02:43:08.966 --> 02:43:12.047]  Socialism, cronyism, fascism doesn't work.
[02:43:12.047 --> 02:43:13.128]  Freedom works.
[02:43:13.128 --> 02:43:14.389]  Legalize freedom.
[02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:15.870]  God bless you, Professor Foley.
[02:43:15.870 --> 02:43:17.010]  Thank you for the time.
[02:43:17.010 --> 02:43:17.811]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[02:43:17.811 --> 02:43:18.992]  I enjoy your show very much.
[02:43:18.992 --> 02:43:19.472]  Thank you.
[02:43:19.472 --> 02:43:20.492]  Wow, that's a great lady.
[02:43:20.492 --> 02:43:22.894]  Check out her books at ElizabethPriceFoley.com.
[02:43:24.417 --> 02:43:34.446]  And that's what this broadcast is, is a platform for great political minds, constitutional minds, to try to educate the public and have a larger discussion.
[02:43:35.461 --> 02:43:40.864]  And to be able to have reporters like our great Jakari Jackson and others who will go to California and check out the radiation.
[02:43:40.864 --> 02:43:42.825]  We got some good news and some bad news in a moment.
[02:43:42.825 --> 02:43:49.208]  In fact, they've got whole reports here that are going to be put into an article later of the readings they got up and down the coast from Northern California up into Oregon.
[02:43:49.208 --> 02:43:51.269]  I'm now going to have them go south.
[02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:55.991]  We're going to skip Seattle because I want to go check out the reactors and things down in Southern California.
[02:43:55.991 --> 02:43:57.452]  So we're going to go to them in a moment.
[02:43:57.452 --> 02:43:59.353]  Please don't forget we are listener supported.
[02:44:00.526 --> 02:44:08.671]  Not like NPR that gets 400-500 million dollars a year of taxpayer money and then begs for money every day on their stations and then Rockefeller funded.
[02:44:08.671 --> 02:44:15.456]  We are funded by the great products we sell like the Pro-Pure, Pro-One water filters that cut out the fluoride, the glyphosates, blows away all the competition.
[02:44:17.091 --> 02:44:21.276]  10% off with promo code WATER at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:21.276 --> 02:44:31.089]  You can also go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com will also take you there, but InfoWarsLife.com takes you directly to the incredible super male vitality that women can take as well.
[02:44:31.650 --> 02:44:31.810]  I think?
[02:44:51.730 --> 02:44:52.390]  We're good to go.
[02:45:08.507 --> 02:45:14.631]  Mexico, High Mountain, Chiapas, organic volcanic soil grown coffee.
[02:45:14.631 --> 02:45:16.932]  Wake Up America, we have it in two different blends.
[02:45:16.932 --> 02:45:18.213]  It's my favorite coffee.
[02:45:18.213 --> 02:45:25.558]  I've drunk for over 10 years and I was able to get the connection right down to the actual co-ops, the actual farmers down there in Chiapas.
[02:45:25.558 --> 02:45:28.720]  We have that as well at Infowarslife.com.
[02:45:30.947 --> 02:45:36.709]  You can also go to InfoWarsTore.com to find all the libertarian constitutional-based apparel, you name it.
[02:45:36.709 --> 02:45:40.491]  And your purchases is what funds this operation via free association.
[02:45:40.491 --> 02:45:50.675]  Now, joining us from Oregon, joining us from Charleston, Oregon,
[02:45:52.128 --> 02:45:52.568]  I don't
[02:46:16.181 --> 02:46:41.381]  Radiation reading where you deal with the micro rads and we found an area with 1,000 percent higher than it should be and they've now had local newspaper articles come out and report on our reporting so our goal is now happening where people are becoming more aware of radiation in and around them in their environment.
[02:46:41.381 --> 02:46:44.184]  They've gone into seafood stores, markets,
[02:46:44.844 --> 02:46:46.366]  They found a lot of different data.
[02:46:46.366 --> 02:46:48.708]  We're going to go over in the next segment with you.
[02:46:48.708 --> 02:46:58.638]  But the good news is most of the coastline of California and Oregon only has 50% to 100% increased radiation levels from what it was just a few years ago.
[02:46:58.638 --> 02:47:02.241]  And that can sound bad, but that's still pretty low.
[02:47:02.241 --> 02:47:04.404]  But we are forcing the media to cover it, obviously.
[02:47:04.904 --> 02:47:08.166]  There are the hot particles coming over, and Jakari joins us.
[02:47:08.166 --> 02:47:17.071]  Jakari Jackson from Charleston, Oregon, with a report they did find double the radiation levels in the Redwoods, only a small increase at the Golden Gate Bridge.
[02:47:17.071 --> 02:47:21.894]  And there's Jakari right there with the boats in the background for folks watching at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:47:21.894 --> 02:47:24.496]  Jakari, tell us about your findings.
[02:47:24.496 --> 02:47:28.038]  Well, Alex, we're here at Fishman's Wharf in Charleston, Oregon.
[02:47:28.038 --> 02:47:29.939]  Now, we've been running around this area out here.
[02:47:29.939 --> 02:47:30.980]  We went to the local
[02:47:34.304 --> 02:47:39.395]  Alright, we've had really good Skype, but now we're having some issues with the technology.
[02:47:39.395 --> 02:47:43.583]  But we'll work on that and see if we can get Jakari back.
[02:47:43.583 --> 02:47:44.765]  Jakari, go ahead and start again.
[02:47:47.205 --> 02:47:54.891]  Yeah, we've lost their audio, so what we're going to do is we're going to work on those technicals and then come back to those guys.
[02:47:54.891 --> 02:47:58.254]  Again, great technology with Skype, but we do run into some hiccups.
[02:47:58.254 --> 02:48:02.877]  They've been filing reports on the InfoWars Nightly News seven o'clock every night.
[02:48:02.877 --> 02:48:09.722]  They're condensed reports out there on the West Coast, and then those later then rotate over to the YouTube channel so the general public can see everything.
[02:48:09.722 --> 02:48:15.346]  Our goal with the subscription site is to be able to have the platform, have our own platform they can't censor, and then launch info
[02:48:16.547 --> 02:48:20.468]  Okay, Alex, we're here at Fishman's Wharf.
[02:48:20.468 --> 02:48:21.749]  This is Charleston, Oregon.
[02:48:21.749 --> 02:48:27.810]  We've been going around to some of the local beaches, also going to some of the local fish markets.
[02:48:27.810 --> 02:48:30.511]  We encountered a gentleman at a beach not too far from here, and he told us about
[02:48:46.848 --> 02:48:47.889]  Well, USA Today is.
[02:49:08.837 --> 02:49:10.799]  And that's a USA Today situation.
[02:49:10.799 --> 02:49:13.483]  They're dying all over the place, the majority of them are.
[02:49:13.483 --> 02:49:17.087]  They're having bifurcated Siamese twin whales, never before seen.
[02:49:17.087 --> 02:49:22.834]  There's undoubtedly major studies out on huge die-off in that area of the Pacific.
[02:49:22.834 --> 02:49:27.680]  And a lot of scientists, like Dr. Buzz, we do believe it's bioaccumulation of the radiation, Jakari.
[02:49:28.410 --> 02:49:30.011]  Yeah, that's exactly right, Alex.
[02:49:30.011 --> 02:49:41.635]  If you see these high concentrations between Monterey and other areas of California where the fish are dying off in droves, not just what you'd consider just normal fish, but also jellyfish.
[02:49:41.635 --> 02:49:43.655]  All kinds of sea life is dying out here.
[02:49:43.655 --> 02:49:45.536]  And like you said, the conjoined whales.
[02:49:45.536 --> 02:49:50.878]  Also, Paul Joseph Watson has reported on the bald eagles as far as Utah, getting brain tumors and other things like that.
[02:49:51.843 --> 02:49:54.705]  Now, Jakari, we're going to come back and talk about some radiation numbers.
[02:49:54.705 --> 02:49:58.088]  You found about double what it should be in the Redwoods.
[02:49:58.088 --> 02:50:02.552]  You guys found 1,000% higher there outside San Francisco.
[02:50:02.552 --> 02:50:06.235]  At the beach.
[02:50:06.235 --> 02:50:07.155]  What else have you found?
[02:50:07.155 --> 02:50:09.958]  Well, we've been traveling up and down the coast.
[02:50:09.958 --> 02:50:14.221]  The highest numbers were definitely at Surfers Beach where the viral YouTube video was shot.
[02:50:14.221 --> 02:50:17.083]  But going up and down, we found maybe around double or so.
[02:50:17.083 --> 02:50:21.247]  We haven't spoken 100 since we left Surfers Beach southwest of San Francisco.
[02:50:22.188 --> 02:50:24.470]  Wow, when we come back I want to go over some of these numbers.
[02:50:24.470 --> 02:50:27.512]  Now we're going to send you guys back south.
[02:50:27.512 --> 02:50:29.194]  Tell us before we go to break where you're going to be next.
[02:50:30.276 --> 02:50:34.419]  Well, we're going to go to Portland, do some things up there, then we're going to head back down south.
[02:50:34.419 --> 02:50:43.305]  We're going to go to L.A., we're going to go to San Diego, some of the power plants around those locations, and also just cruise the coast like we've been doing since we began this mission.
[02:50:43.305 --> 02:50:51.850]  Alright, well we found increased radiation levels basically everywhere, but they're only slightly increased, so it's good news and bad news, but we're continuing to monitor the situation.
[02:50:51.850 --> 02:50:59.796]  We'll come back from Oregon, there in Charleston, Oregon, with the InfoWars crew reporting as the radiation waves come in from
[02:51:00.396 --> 02:51:01.316]  Next, from Japan.
[02:51:01.316 --> 02:51:06.638]  Do you know how much the dollar has lost in its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[02:51:06.638 --> 02:51:11.840]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[02:51:11.840 --> 02:51:15.661]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[02:51:15.661 --> 02:51:21.984]  Put another way, who cares if your investments go up 10%, but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[02:51:21.984 --> 02:51:25.485]  Gold is the only monetary asset that is no one else's liability.
[02:51:25.805 --> 02:51:28.688]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[02:51:28.688 --> 02:51:31.291]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[02:51:31.291 --> 02:51:32.913]  You can possess it in your hand.
[02:51:32.913 --> 02:51:34.175]  You can take it with you.
[02:51:34.175 --> 02:51:35.336]  Gold is real money.
[02:51:35.336 --> 02:51:36.838]  Gold is honest money.
[02:51:36.838 --> 02:51:39.141]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[02:51:39.141 --> 02:51:41.003]  To find out how you can protect your savings,
[02:51:41.483 --> 02:51:42.104]  We're good to go.
[02:52:00.803 --> 02:52:04.445]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:52:04.445 --> 02:52:08.266]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:52:08.266 --> 02:52:14.449]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:52:14.449 --> 02:52:24.673]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[02:52:24.673 --> 02:52:29.115]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 probiotic from Terraganics.
[02:52:29.315 --> 02:52:39.483]  Pro-EM1 probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes, the common cold, and much more.
[02:52:39.483 --> 02:52:50.992]  And including a powerful probiotic like Pro-EM1 as part of your daily routine puts you back in control and prevents you from becoming a mindless zombie manipulated by the pharmaceutical and GMO agendas.
[02:52:51.192 --> 02:52:57.355]  Call Terragonics at 866-369-3678 or visit Terragonics.com.
[02:52:57.355 --> 02:53:00.356]  T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X dot com.
[02:53:00.356 --> 02:53:10.980]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:53:10.980 --> 02:53:12.801]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:53:13.021 --> 02:53:13.902]  Fluoride.
[02:53:13.902 --> 02:53:15.803]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:53:15.803 --> 02:53:22.347]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:53:22.347 --> 02:53:25.289]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[02:53:25.289 --> 02:53:27.251]  And the results are on record.
[02:53:27.251 --> 02:53:33.535]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:53:33.535 --> 02:53:35.937]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:53:35.937 --> 02:53:38.859]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:53:38.859 --> 02:53:42.221]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:53:42.321 --> 02:53:47.724]  You'll find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:53:47.724 --> 02:53:52.806]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[02:53:52.806 --> 02:53:53.987]  I take it every day.
[02:53:53.987 --> 02:53:56.828]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:54:17.944 --> 02:54:19.484]  All right, it's the final segment.
[02:54:19.484 --> 02:54:27.286]  We'll have more on the InfoWars Nightly News and High Def as the crew posts their reports from the road.
[02:54:27.286 --> 02:54:28.806]  And they're out there at the Fisherman's Wharf.
[02:54:28.806 --> 02:54:30.966]  They've been talking to fishermen that have seen glowing jellyfish.
[02:54:30.966 --> 02:54:33.867]  They've never seen other things, but they don't want to go on camera.
[02:54:33.867 --> 02:54:39.048]  A man just walked up there at Fisherman's Wharf, who I guess is a listener and has been watching, and came out there.
[02:54:39.048 --> 02:54:39.728]  He's a fisherman.
[02:54:39.728 --> 02:54:45.249]  We'll see if we got a good audio connection out there to Oregon with Jakari Jackson.
[02:54:45.249 --> 02:54:45.609]  Jakari?
[02:54:46.755 --> 02:54:47.215]  Yes, Alex.
[02:54:47.215 --> 02:54:47.996]  We're out here in Lancaster.
[02:54:47.996 --> 02:54:49.776]  We just encountered a fan, a viewer.
[02:54:49.776 --> 02:54:51.337]  He's also a local fisherman.
[02:54:51.337 --> 02:54:55.038]  He says he's been traveling these waters and also has some concerns of his own.
[02:54:55.038 --> 02:54:56.639]  Well, let's talk to him and he'll talk to us.
[02:54:56.639 --> 02:54:57.899]  Come on in, sir.
[02:54:57.899 --> 02:55:00.160]  Your name is Tyler, sir?
[02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:01.601]  Okay, come on in, Tyler.
[02:55:01.601 --> 02:55:03.722]  Okay, so Tyler, how long have you been fishing?
[02:55:03.722 --> 02:55:04.342]  About 12 years.
[02:55:04.342 --> 02:55:05.723]  12 years.
[02:55:05.723 --> 02:55:06.763]  And what do you fish for?
[02:55:06.763 --> 02:55:08.244]  Where do you fish?
[02:55:08.244 --> 02:55:13.906]  We fish here mostly Central Oregon for Dungeons Crab and Albacore Tunas.
[02:55:15.748 --> 02:55:16.728]  The bread and butter.
[02:55:16.728 --> 02:55:17.289]  Okay.
[02:55:17.289 --> 02:55:19.689]  And you know about the radiation and so forth.
[02:55:19.689 --> 02:55:22.110]  Do you have any concerns about that?
[02:55:22.110 --> 02:55:24.471]  Absolutely concerns.
[02:55:24.471 --> 02:55:26.752]  Especially with the albacore tuna.
[02:55:26.752 --> 02:55:28.652]  What's going on with the tuna?
[02:55:28.652 --> 02:55:42.277]  Well, they're a migratory species and we get a lot of questions on our website, OceanHarvest.com, about people just being concerned and we don't really have any good answers for them.
[02:55:42.277 --> 02:55:44.678]  So I really appreciate what you guys are doing here.
[02:55:46.328 --> 02:55:49.310]  I don't trust the other sources that are saying everything's okay.
[02:55:49.310 --> 02:55:50.531]  That's right.
[02:55:50.531 --> 02:55:51.532]  We definitely appreciate you.
[02:55:51.532 --> 02:55:52.472]  Go ahead, Alex.
[02:55:52.472 --> 02:56:05.762]  Well, just asking if he's seen anything abnormal like USA Today reported the massive starfish die-offs or has he heard about the whale that washed up there on the coast nearby that was a Siamese and never before seen?
[02:56:05.762 --> 02:56:07.283]  Have you found any anomalies?
[02:56:07.283 --> 02:56:11.426]  Did you hear about the starfish or also the Siamese gray whales?
[02:56:11.426 --> 02:56:12.487]  Yeah, I've heard about that.
[02:56:12.487 --> 02:56:13.708]  Have you personally witnessed?
[02:56:13.708 --> 02:56:15.369]  No, I haven't witnessed anything.
[02:56:16.098 --> 02:56:17.579]  Anything different?
[02:56:17.579 --> 02:56:18.600]  Any kind of anomalies?
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:20.681]  Just anything that's different on the water since Fukushima?
[02:56:20.681 --> 02:56:27.746]  We were talking to a guy, one of the fishermen right here in the dock, and he said he saw some debris come in from Japan and I asked him how he knew it was Japanese.
[02:56:27.746 --> 02:56:30.448]  He said it had Japanese writing on it.
[02:56:30.448 --> 02:56:36.933]  That's always been, there's always been debris from overseas.
[02:56:36.933 --> 02:56:39.014]  We've been finding the glass balls here for years.
[02:56:39.014 --> 02:56:42.877]  It's one of our prizes that we look for on the beach and the ocean.
[02:56:45.168 --> 02:56:46.629]  But yeah, there's always been debris.
[02:56:46.629 --> 02:56:47.650]  Fishing been since Fukushima.
[02:56:47.650 --> 02:56:48.951]  What's the catch level?
[02:56:48.951 --> 02:56:49.931]  Has it gone up?
[02:56:49.931 --> 02:56:50.172]  Down?
[02:56:50.172 --> 02:56:50.272]  Same?
[02:56:50.272 --> 02:56:50.472]  Really?
[02:56:50.472 --> 02:56:50.812]  Yeah, I haven't.
[02:57:01.275 --> 02:57:08.578]  So, the levels in San Francisco, a little southwest of San Francisco at Surfers Beach, you heard about those, you heard that they're several times higher.
[02:57:08.578 --> 02:57:16.561]  We ourselves went down there and found in excess of ten times what the normal radiation is, or at least what the local news reports as a normal level of radiation.
[02:57:16.561 --> 02:57:18.442]  Are you concerned about that reaching up here?
[02:57:18.442 --> 02:57:19.483]  Yeah, I'm very concerned about it.
[02:57:19.483 --> 02:57:25.745]  I've been on your guys' website several times a day, following you guys up the coast, seeing what you found.
[02:57:25.745 --> 02:57:27.446]  And that's why I stopped here today.
[02:57:27.446 --> 02:57:29.047]  I was down checking my boat and saw you standing here.
[02:57:30.526 --> 02:57:35.210]  Pulled the brakes on and came to say hi, so I haven't noticed anything different.
[02:57:35.210 --> 02:57:36.892]  Definitely very concerned.
[02:57:36.892 --> 02:57:39.154]  Ask him if there's anything else he'd like to add.
[02:57:39.154 --> 02:57:45.319]  It's in the... This is our... This is our livelihood, so... Yeah, this is your livelihood.
[02:57:45.319 --> 02:57:52.145]  So what... If you could tell the viewers, anybody out there who may be skeptical of this, you know, what would you say to somebody?
[02:57:52.145 --> 02:57:52.686]  I'd say to...
[02:57:57.182 --> 02:57:59.184]  Get yourself knowledgeable.
[02:57:59.184 --> 02:58:02.607]  Pay attention to what's going on in the world.
[02:58:02.607 --> 02:58:07.752]  There's a lot of deception out there, so check all your sources.
[02:58:08.914 --> 02:58:09.675]  That's right.
[02:58:09.675 --> 02:58:12.096]  Be a light in this darkness of deception.
[02:58:12.096 --> 02:58:13.897]  Well, Tyler, I definitely appreciate your time.
[02:58:13.897 --> 02:58:14.718]  Thank you for coming out.
[02:58:14.718 --> 02:58:15.738]  All right, good job, Jakar.
[02:58:15.738 --> 02:58:16.979]  We did a little bit of overdrive there.
[02:58:16.979 --> 02:58:19.661]  I want to come back and go over some of these radiation numbers with you.
[02:58:19.661 --> 02:58:24.304]  But again, the good news is we are not finding super high levels in most areas.
[02:58:24.304 --> 02:58:26.665]  Only a few areas had the 1,000 percent, 49 percent increase.
[02:58:29.046 --> 02:58:33.049]  The Redwoods were only double, and at those levels, it's not very life-threatening.
[02:58:33.049 --> 02:58:36.690]  The problem is if you get hot particles, but I'm glad we sent our crew out there.
[02:58:36.690 --> 02:58:38.812]  Now we're going to investigate Southern California.
[02:58:38.812 --> 02:58:43.394]  Stay with us at OverdriveInfoWars.com forward slash show for the free feeds.
[02:58:43.394 --> 02:58:45.655]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:45.655 --> 02:58:46.596]  Central.
[02:58:46.596 --> 02:58:48.036]  The Sunday Transmissions.
[02:58:48.036 --> 02:58:49.037]  Spread the word, folks!
[02:58:51.038 --> 02:58:53.880]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:58:53.880 --> 02:58:59.005]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:58:59.005 --> 02:59:07.131]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:59:07.131 --> 02:59:11.655]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:59:11.655 --> 02:59:15.478]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:59:15.618 --> 02:59:21.565]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:59:21.565 --> 02:59:24.728]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:59:24.728 --> 02:59:29.874]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from my Patriot Supply.

[02:59:51.922 --> 02:59:53.462]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.462 --> 02:59:55.523]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.523 --> 02:59:58.724]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.851 --> 03:00:10.695]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.695 --> 03:00:12.276]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.276 --> 03:00:13.817]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.817 --> 03:00:18.020]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.020 --> 03:00:22.724]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.724 --> 03:00:27.928]  On the Sunday transmission, we're going to have Jakari Jackson pop in with reports.
[03:00:27.928 --> 03:00:30.730]  For us as well, from Southern California.
[03:00:30.730 --> 03:00:33.272]  We're going to go ahead and send them down there now and investigate that area.
[03:00:34.898 --> 03:00:40.382]  I'll also cover 92 million Americans not in labor force.
[03:00:40.382 --> 03:00:42.623]  That's simply amazing.
[03:00:42.623 --> 03:00:47.627]  For every one job added, nearly five people left the workforce.
[03:00:47.627 --> 03:00:49.468]  I mean, this is agenda 21.
[03:00:49.468 --> 03:00:51.549]  This is the depression by design.
[03:00:51.549 --> 03:00:54.892]  Jakari, we're going to post these in an article soon, but...
[03:00:55.805 --> 03:01:03.150]  The good news here is you only found double the normal level of background radiation at the Redwoods.
[03:01:03.150 --> 03:01:03.970]  That's still not good.
[03:01:03.970 --> 03:01:09.154]  You only found a 20-30% increase in what it should have been at the Golden Gate Bridge.
[03:01:09.154 --> 03:01:13.457]  And you only... I mean everywhere it's higher than it should be.
[03:01:13.457 --> 03:01:18.640]  It's 58 CPM at Laguna Creek, Klamath, California.
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:20.121]  Falls, Klamath, 56.
[03:01:20.121 --> 03:01:25.245]  54 at Crab Shack, Anchor Way, California.
[03:01:27.026 --> 03:01:45.324]  60% CPM, that's a little over double what it should be, there at Pistol River State Scenic Viewpoint, Blue Star Memorial Highway marker, Brookings, Oregon 40 CPM, Humboldt Bay Generating Station, that's a reactor and it's only 44 CPM, but the thing is, it is higher
[03:01:45.985 --> 03:01:52.713]  It is higher than it's supposed to be, but these levels aren't that big of a deal unless you get one of the particles that's obviously creating this.
[03:01:52.713 --> 03:01:57.718]  Jakari, in the three minutes we've got left, other key points about your observations, what you think of this?
[03:01:57.718 --> 03:01:59.580]  I think this is good news overall.
[03:01:59.580 --> 03:02:04.706]  I mean, it's a lot better than it being a thousand, you know, percent everywhere or something.
[03:02:04.706 --> 03:02:05.707]  That would be panic level.
[03:02:06.514 --> 03:02:11.197]  Exactly, because I told David Knight our first day, our first broadcast, we went out to the beach.
[03:02:11.197 --> 03:02:14.239]  I was concerned to be standing in such high levels of radiation.
[03:02:14.239 --> 03:02:23.725]  The CPMs, the counts per minute, were hit registering well over 300, close to 372, which the normal there is supposed to be about 30 CPMs.
[03:02:23.725 --> 03:02:25.887]  So that was very concerning to me.
[03:02:25.887 --> 03:02:30.350]  But as we traveled up and down the coast, as you mentioned, we didn't find anything that was that hot.
[03:02:30.350 --> 03:02:32.231]  So I was happy about that.
[03:02:32.231 --> 03:02:34.993]  Definitely happy for the locals, and we talked to various people.
[03:02:35.393 --> 03:02:38.416]  Some people were knowledgeable about the situation at Surfers Beach.
[03:02:38.416 --> 03:02:39.436]  Some people weren't.
[03:02:39.436 --> 03:02:45.101]  But regardless, everybody we talked to, it's been a pretty... A little bit of break up there.
[03:02:45.101 --> 03:02:46.462]  Let him hold that thought for a moment.
[03:02:46.462 --> 03:02:49.264]  While we get a connection back, I'm going to just say this.
[03:02:49.264 --> 03:02:52.286]  There needs to be an investigation in and around San Francisco.
[03:02:53.391 --> 03:03:03.637]  Of why all over that beach and all over the bluffs and the woods, I mean, 500%, 1,400%, 1,000%, and we've talked to radiologists and nuclear plant workers.
[03:03:03.637 --> 03:03:08.079]  They say just 25, 30 years ago, they'd all be wearing lead suits around that.
[03:03:08.079 --> 03:03:11.481]  And, you know, if you had to work around that, I mean, that is a big deal.
[03:03:11.481 --> 03:03:18.825]  It's not a big deal to be around it for an hour or two or whatever, but, you know, them saying, oh, 50,000 hours is safe at the health department, that is pure bull.
[03:03:18.825 --> 03:03:19.626]  Jakari, are you back?
[03:03:23.854 --> 03:03:26.081]  Okay, let's go back.
[03:03:26.081 --> 03:03:27.987]  You're breaking up some, but you're still there.
[03:03:27.987 --> 03:03:29.050]  Jakari, any other points?
[03:03:30.250 --> 03:03:32.171]  No, you said it pretty much there, Alex.
[03:03:32.171 --> 03:03:48.217]  I'm very happy that we didn't encounter the high levels going up north on the coast, but I am very knowledgeable and concerned about these people, about these people who have knowledge about these areas like Tyler we just talked to, and also other people we've talked to, like the gentleman who saw the melting starfish.
[03:03:48.217 --> 03:03:53.720]  People who've been out here say they find strange anomalies going on with the jellyfish and other things like that.
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:58.382]  People have to know about this, just like Tyler said, to educate you.
[03:03:58.382 --> 03:03:58.942]  Alright!
[03:03:59.722 --> 03:04:02.166]  Alright, where are you going next, Jakari?
[03:04:02.166 --> 03:04:07.516]  Next, we're going to go up to the coast to Portland, do some research down south.
[03:04:08.499 --> 03:04:10.341]  All right, great job with the crew.
[03:04:10.341 --> 03:04:12.623]  A little bit of technical stuff, but that's what makes it fun.
[03:04:12.623 --> 03:04:14.605]  It's live, it's real, it's unscripted.
[03:04:14.605 --> 03:04:18.808]  Go with the God, be safe there in the West Coast.
[03:04:18.808 --> 03:04:19.249]  Beautiful.
[03:04:19.249 --> 03:04:22.532]  I love Oregon, love Northern California, love Seattle.
[03:04:22.532 --> 03:04:23.633]  I like San Diego, too.
[03:04:23.633 --> 03:04:25.795]  It's just Los Angeles that I avoid, like the plague.
[03:04:25.795 --> 03:04:29.178]  I physically feel sick when I'm in L.A., that smog.
[03:04:29.178 --> 03:04:31.780]  I mean, I go to New York, London.
[03:04:31.780 --> 03:04:33.642]  You know, I've been to big cities in Mexico, I haven't felt sick.
[03:04:34.912 --> 03:04:36.273]  Los Angeles, man.
[03:04:36.273 --> 03:04:38.273]  I just will not go out there anymore.
[03:04:38.273 --> 03:04:39.814]  And I've got a lot of great opportunities to go out to L.A.
[03:04:39.814 --> 03:04:40.775]  and see really cool people.
[03:04:40.775 --> 03:04:48.858]  I just physically, spiritually, it's like entering Satan's toilet bowl or something.
[03:04:48.858 --> 03:04:50.339]  It's something else.
[03:04:50.339 --> 03:04:53.720]  All right, great job to the entire crew here at InfoWars Center.
[03:04:53.720 --> 03:04:55.681]  All you, the listeners, our sponsors, everybody.
[03:04:55.681 --> 03:04:58.062]  I'll see you this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., Lord willing.
[03:04:58.062 --> 03:05:00.263]  And tonight, 7 o'clock, InfoWars Nightly News.
