[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:34.220]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.220 --> 00:43.220]  I woke up at about 6 a.m. this morning and I went and made some coffee and I
[00:43.220 --> 00:53.180]  got in the shower and I walked out on the back porch in my robe and it just
[00:53.180 --> 00:59.460]  absolutely hit me like a ton of bricks how we defeat the New World Order how we
[00:59.460 --> 01:04.820]  turn the tide against these people and it's so incredibly simple and hiding in
[01:04.820 --> 01:09.900]  everyone's face and I made the determination to come in here this
[01:09.900 --> 01:19.260]  morning and to put out this basic idea and it's an idea you've heard before but
[01:19.260 --> 01:27.060]  it hit me how essential it is and it's so simple but so also powerful at the
[01:27.060 --> 01:36.540]  same time that it's hard to even properly describe it and so what I'm going to do
[01:36.540 --> 01:45.420]  is I'm just not even going to say it right now because when you're having a
[01:45.420 --> 01:56.220]  clear thought there's just thousands of data points condensed into that clarion
[01:56.220 --> 02:04.860]  understanding but then how do you communicate that and express that in a
[02:04.860 --> 02:16.700]  way that is simply put but also carries the great depth of palette and bouquet and
[02:16.700 --> 02:21.580]  then I walked in here and began going over the giant stacks of news the guys
[02:21.580 --> 02:25.100]  had printed off from every major news source out there alternative and
[02:25.100 --> 02:31.700]  dinosaur governmental and corporate grassroots and establishment and
[02:31.700 --> 02:44.020]  staring down at the page I saw being said by Ted Cruz exactly what I was
[02:44.020 --> 02:52.500]  going to come on air and say to you today that it's here we're being prepared
[02:52.500 --> 02:59.140]  for total martial law total surveillance total taxation total control a
[02:59.140 --> 03:05.860]  revolution of criminality and the only answer is to not become acclimated by
[03:05.860 --> 03:09.180]  it we're at that key point where it's a merge it's out in the open before it goes
[03:09.180 --> 03:15.900]  to the next level of open takeover and this is really happening it's now here
[03:15.900 --> 03:23.860]  and we're only seeing a few prominent people tell it like it is and even though
[03:23.860 --> 03:30.100]  it's simple and it's true in a world of universal deceit telling the truth is a
[03:30.100 --> 03:34.220]  revolutionary act and when we come back I'll quantify what I'm getting at here
[03:34.220 --> 03:38.740]  but here's the CBS news article it's up on info wars.com it's on the right hand
[03:38.740 --> 03:44.060]  side of drugs report.com is the easiest place to find it Cruz calls president
[03:44.060 --> 03:51.700]  dangerous and terrifying you see people say oh don't use flowery dark rhetoric
[03:51.700 --> 03:56.020]  tyrannical rhetoric you know everybody does that to demonize politicians no
[03:56.020 --> 04:04.780]  when the shoe fits when it's true it's true and we've all even myself gotten
[04:04.780 --> 04:10.700]  comfortable living in the beginnings of serious tyranny and we need to struggle
[04:10.700 --> 04:15.020]  and freak out and we need to call the president out and let me just tell you
[04:15.020 --> 04:18.580]  something this is the type of stuff they blow your airplane up over when you're a
[04:18.580 --> 04:25.260]  leader and well-spoken and intellectual the establishment I can guarantee you
[04:25.260 --> 04:28.780]  was scared of Ted Cruz even if they think he's part of the establishment is
[04:28.780 --> 04:31.860]  gonna double cross libertarians down the road and I have no proof of that
[04:31.860 --> 04:38.220]  happening but you know you can't put your faith in man got to put it in God
[04:38.220 --> 04:42.180]  the point is just the way he's challenging them is the way another
[04:42.180 --> 04:46.420]  rival group would take over from this elite I mean this is leadership right
[04:46.420 --> 04:53.060]  here this is how you talk to bring down tyrants this is the answer telling it
[04:53.060 --> 04:58.820]  like it is getting hardcore serious we'll be right back

[09:11.620 --> 09:19.740]  o'clock central at info wars news dot com or prison planet dot TV okay we have
[09:19.740 --> 09:26.460]  obviously an incredible amount of news on the economy on the NSA on surveillance
[09:26.460 --> 09:34.980]  on what's happening with the military Governor Christie so much is going on and
[09:34.980 --> 09:40.500]  we will cover it all today and we have two guests including one of my favorite
[09:40.500 --> 09:46.180]  guests in studio Dr. Group and then we have a constitutional lawyer popping in
[09:46.180 --> 09:50.860]  in the third hour and Jacari Jackson and crew I've got a lot of radiation
[09:50.860 --> 09:56.180]  findings a lot of the news good some of it bad in northern California into
[09:56.180 --> 10:00.820]  Oregon the good news is is most of Oregon and California does not have
[10:00.820 --> 10:05.900]  higher levels of radiation the bad news is and we've talked to physicists and
[10:05.900 --> 10:14.380]  others the levels that are a thousand times 1400 times higher than what is
[10:14.380 --> 10:20.940]  safe in the background is very serious and the fact that the media poop is it
[10:20.940 --> 10:24.420]  the fact that government says yeah the health department confirmed that in
[10:24.420 --> 10:27.900]  San Francisco but we're not worried about it and they've got a new article
[10:27.900 --> 10:34.740]  out of the Santa Cruz Sentinel state rebuffs radiation concerns at beach and
[10:34.740 --> 10:41.860]  basically halfway whitewash is what's going on but does state some of the facts
[10:41.860 --> 10:46.260]  but the pretty good article out of dinosaur media from half moon Bay where
[10:46.260 --> 10:50.820]  we did find the highest readings we found a thousand times others found 1400
[10:50.820 --> 10:55.660]  times and the county health department confirmed 500 times where they went and
[10:55.660 --> 10:58.900]  looked and we have four different professional Geiger counters and you
[10:58.900 --> 11:02.580]  can read the settings and we've had radiologists and physicists and nuclear
[11:02.580 --> 11:07.260]  cleanup specialists look at our videos look at it they say no that's all that's
[11:07.260 --> 11:10.700]  all you know just dead on like reading the clock that's what's going on there
[11:10.700 --> 11:16.980]  and that just 30 years ago or 25 years ago they would tell folks don't be
[11:16.980 --> 11:22.380]  anywhere around that period in case you ingest any of where that radiation is
[11:22.380 --> 11:25.940]  coming from it's one thing to have the background that's a thousand times what
[11:25.940 --> 11:30.620]  it should be and your body can handle it unless you you know sat there by it for
[11:30.620 --> 11:36.660]  a year but if you ingest any of that then it goes into the tissues and just
[11:36.660 --> 11:40.900]  sits there at point-blank range radiating your body even at a low level and
[11:40.900 --> 11:44.740]  you get cancer and that's just a fact that's why do you even though it's low
[11:44.740 --> 11:50.580]  level radiation is highly toxic and at point-blank range goes into the cells
[11:50.580 --> 11:56.100]  and you're you're toast and our troops are breathing this stuff that's a death
[11:56.100 --> 12:00.340]  sentence and they knew that when they authorized it and the reason this
[12:00.340 --> 12:04.660]  radiation story so big is it's not even about the radiation that's secondary
[12:04.660 --> 12:10.380]  it's that it's weird according to mainstream media and radio talk show
[12:10.380 --> 12:14.500]  host out in California and others that have been critical of us to want to go
[12:14.500 --> 12:22.900]  and investigate and look investigation is a bad thing being informed is like
[12:22.900 --> 12:27.980]  having leprosy or something with yuppies and establishment trendies who
[12:27.980 --> 12:31.220]  really just want to think everything's fine when all the metrics all the
[12:31.220 --> 12:36.900]  gauges all the indicators show things are not fine if we're on the deck of the
[12:36.900 --> 12:40.580]  Titanic it's listing over about to basically break in two I don't want
[12:40.580 --> 12:44.620]  that to happen I live here my family lives here your family lives here I
[12:44.620 --> 12:49.100]  don't want there to be a stock market crash even though it's valued many of
[12:49.100 --> 12:53.980]  the top companies a hundred to one price earnings ratio it was 25 30 to one in
[12:53.980 --> 13:00.740]  1929 in the big crash I mean this is like a big rotten heart that's had 20
[13:00.740 --> 13:05.420]  heart attacks and half the heart's dead and it's got 20 stent Senate and and the
[13:05.420 --> 13:09.980]  guy's taking Viagra and snorting cocaine I mean is that a good idea that heart is
[13:09.980 --> 13:13.580]  going to blow wide open that's what hearts do when they're all rotten they
[13:13.580 --> 13:18.220]  just blow in different directions and you die instantly that's what all the
[13:18.220 --> 13:22.420]  armored vehicles in the riot training is for they admit it but it's not like
[13:22.420 --> 13:26.660]  they did all this to counter something that was an accident this was all
[13:26.660 --> 13:29.340]  engineered it's been done in other countries over and over again and it's
[13:29.340 --> 13:33.620]  going to end this country as we know it and homeland security is meant to
[13:33.620 --> 13:40.900]  absorb the nation as it collapses into this dark tyranny that is called agenda
[13:40.900 --> 13:43.420]  21
[13:44.820 --> 13:49.900]  designed to impoverish this nation designed to break the back of rural
[13:49.900 --> 13:53.980]  communities especially and farmers designed to make us dependent on the
[13:53.980 --> 14:01.060]  system designed to totally domesticate us we are truly going into the nastiest
[14:01.060 --> 14:06.700]  most scientific most control freak
[14:06.700 --> 14:15.100]  autocratic authoritarian oppression the world has ever seen this is certified
[14:15.100 --> 14:29.180]  certified cultural death political death this is certified 24 carat evil 24
[14:29.180 --> 14:34.020]  carats pure gold folks this is pure tyranny if you judge it on that scale
[14:34.020 --> 14:43.100]  it is 24 carat pure pure and that is the one thing you cannot admire but at
[14:43.100 --> 14:50.060]  least marvel at is the people at the top of this are committed and consciously
[14:50.060 --> 14:55.140]  premeditatedly doing this now they use all the nihilist and the mercenaries and
[14:55.140 --> 14:59.420]  the psychos and the pervs and the control freaks and the people that have got
[14:59.420 --> 15:04.420]  scores to settle and the mentally ill leftists who really just authoritarian
[15:04.420 --> 15:07.900]  control freaks calling themselves the establishment calling themselves the
[15:07.900 --> 15:11.580]  answer calling themselves the high ground calling themselves the authority
[15:11.580 --> 15:15.300]  that's why they always lecture down as if they're the boss and most people
[15:15.300 --> 15:21.500]  respond to it as if they're the boss and have the moral authority when they are
[15:21.500 --> 15:28.940]  part of a locust swarm historically that takes over civilizations now all of
[15:28.940 --> 15:38.580]  that said I want to talk about a really strong realization that I had this
[15:38.580 --> 15:48.780]  morning at about 630 looking out into the fog over the Texas hill country and it
[15:48.780 --> 15:57.500]  was this though the landscape was shrouded in fog my mind was completely
[15:57.500 --> 16:05.740]  clear that we can beat these people and the answer to defeating them is
[16:05.740 --> 16:11.060]  withdrawing our political cultural economic consent at every level we can
[16:11.060 --> 16:18.140]  and criticizing the system exposing the system as alien fraudulent anti-liberty
[16:18.140 --> 16:27.980]  exposing that the system is the author of our present collapsing system that
[16:27.980 --> 16:34.260]  they are to blame and when you're faced with real tyranny and when you're faced
[16:34.260 --> 16:38.820]  historically with something so premeditatedly evil it's hard to
[16:38.820 --> 16:41.980]  believe you're living in that historical time but that's what happens over and
[16:41.980 --> 16:47.820]  over again is people respond like deer in the headlights I've studied history
[16:47.820 --> 16:52.380]  deeply and if you respond like a deer in the headlights even though now you know
[16:52.380 --> 16:56.740]  the cars on coming you know the tyrannies real the NSA spying the open
[16:56.740 --> 16:59.940]  borders the plan to shut the country down to bankrupt everybody for control
[16:59.940 --> 17:05.060]  the globalism all of it the plan to take over families put us into 200 square
[17:05.060 --> 17:10.140]  foot coffin apartments with total taxation total surveillance you know I
[17:10.140 --> 17:14.900]  saw the car as it rounded a mountain 20 miles away and I said that's tyranny
[17:14.900 --> 17:19.220]  coming historically and then a lot of people woke up as the car came down the
[17:19.220 --> 17:23.180]  road a mile away and then now the cars 200 yards away going about 80 miles an
[17:23.180 --> 17:27.740]  hour and we're standing here in the middle of the road and it's gonna hit
[17:27.740 --> 17:38.540]  us unless we simply recognize it's happening and step out of the road and
[17:38.540 --> 17:45.500]  let the tyranny basically pass all we've got to do is withdraw our consent it's
[17:45.500 --> 17:51.180]  that easy we step aside the car basically disappears we don't give it
[17:51.180 --> 17:55.340]  support moral support any of it we realize that it's a fraud and we've
[17:55.340 --> 18:01.420]  been under literally a political spell of high-tech mind control and you break
[18:01.420 --> 18:05.980]  that spell in yourself and in others even if you're awake to what's happening
[18:05.980 --> 18:13.540]  you've got to realize that you are a leader and that you can affect change
[18:13.540 --> 18:17.780]  and that simply criticizing the system and supporting alternative systems and
[18:17.780 --> 18:22.060]  withdrawing your consent and speaking out against the system and declaring it
[18:22.060 --> 18:26.340]  the enemy declaring it the fraud declaring at the criminal institution it
[18:26.340 --> 18:31.980]  is will defeat it it will take its authority away it will show it to be
[18:31.980 --> 18:35.500]  the fraud it is no matter how many guns and bullets and how much surveillance
[18:35.500 --> 18:39.540]  it's got the people will see the emperor is butt naked and wearing no clothes
[18:39.540 --> 18:44.680]  we're gonna skip this network break this is so important I'm about to say and it
[18:44.680 --> 18:49.060]  hit me this morning we've got to call out Obama and the entire system as
[18:49.060 --> 18:54.060]  gangster thug certified criminals who have conned the public and been caught
[18:54.060 --> 18:59.460]  and discredited because the polls show that and we have to declare victory and
[18:59.460 --> 19:06.580]  declare them impeached by the public in the court of public opinion and we have
[19:06.580 --> 19:10.740]  to go after corrupt officials in counties cities states you name it when
[19:10.740 --> 19:14.580]  the system it's been trying to bully us and intimidate us and dominate us and
[19:14.580 --> 19:18.700]  break our will like a pimp breaks a woman's will that he's turning into a
[19:18.700 --> 19:23.700]  sex slave they have tried to break our will we have to find our fighting spirit
[19:23.700 --> 19:28.900]  again and understand resistance is victory and you tend to not want to call
[19:28.900 --> 19:32.660]  it out as evil as it is because you don't want to alarm people or you don't
[19:32.660 --> 19:36.340]  want to disagree with you or you don't want to stand out but once you start
[19:36.340 --> 19:40.100]  standing out it's going to feel good you're going to know you're turning the
[19:40.100 --> 19:43.820]  tide you're going to know that no matter what comes you're now in forward
[19:43.820 --> 19:48.740]  motion engaging the enemy that's attacking us we are defensive but we're
[19:48.740 --> 19:53.220]  already under attack so that is an offensive move we didn't draw first
[19:53.220 --> 19:57.820]  blood or the billions blood and we're not gonna draw physical blood but we're
[19:57.820 --> 20:01.540]  moving towards the point where they're going to lose politically they're going
[20:01.540 --> 20:06.420]  to come in with physical force ladies and gentlemen and persecution they've
[20:06.420 --> 20:10.180]  already been doing it with the IRS and the FBI the FBI is announced they're
[20:10.180 --> 20:14.460]  not going to do white collar fraud anymore because the government runs that
[20:14.460 --> 20:22.540]  they're going to go after political people as a new commissariat as commissars
[20:22.540 --> 20:29.020]  this is this is historical what's happening and it's vital that people in
[20:29.020 --> 20:35.460]  the government across the board do not comply drag your feet leak information
[20:35.460 --> 20:40.140]  you don't have to even be a hero and say no and get fired or leave like one of
[20:40.140 --> 20:45.220]  the top Secret Service agents Bongino but look how he left exposed the system
[20:45.220 --> 20:48.700]  and now he's running for Congress to get in and fight it I can tell you that's a
[20:48.700 --> 20:53.260]  genuine real guy that's what we need and we need school teachers and auto
[20:53.260 --> 21:03.420]  mechanics and cattle folks and shopkeepers and and folks that own car repair
[21:03.420 --> 21:07.940]  shops everybody police officers you name it we're all in this together we have to
[21:07.940 --> 21:13.740]  clearly state the choice of historical tyranny and bondage that the television
[21:13.740 --> 21:17.940]  and the movies and the sitcoms push as acceptable the system is trying to
[21:17.940 --> 21:21.900]  acclimate this revolution against basic freedom they're the revolutionaries
[21:21.900 --> 21:28.380]  they're the attackers they are the radicals we have to realize that and have
[21:28.380 --> 21:33.460]  absolute courage and stand up against it and we can defeat them now to quantify
[21:33.460 --> 21:37.700]  it we have to call the criminals out we have to get aggressive you have to go
[21:37.700 --> 21:41.660]  to every public event you can when Congress people come to speak and shout
[21:41.660 --> 21:46.100]  them down and others will join you when you take the step of leadership you have
[21:46.100 --> 21:50.900]  to go to every city council meeting every week you know forget going to the
[21:50.900 --> 21:54.380]  bar forget going to the baseball game forget going and having your glitter
[21:54.380 --> 21:57.580]  bug preacher tell you give him money or whatever on Wednesday night get down to
[21:57.580 --> 22:00.940]  the city council meeting and bring up citizens communication whatever topic
[22:00.940 --> 22:07.580]  she want get the buzz intensifying all over grassroots we have the majority we
[22:07.580 --> 22:12.380]  have to let the majority know we are the majority the last domino fall is that
[22:12.380 --> 22:17.980]  those of us that love liberty are loners or are by ourselves or small
[22:17.980 --> 22:21.940]  numbers Congress has a six percent approval rating the lowest in history
[22:21.940 --> 22:29.540]  I've never known of a dictatorship that had less support than that Obama even
[22:29.540 --> 22:32.460]  though it's a cult of personality where you buy into the brand has like a 30
[22:32.460 --> 22:37.220]  percent approval rating with only the most dependent type people that think
[22:37.220 --> 22:44.740]  in a cultish way this system is absolutely weak and it's alien and it
[22:44.740 --> 22:49.300]  wants to destroy our prosperity in America to bring the system down you've
[22:49.300 --> 22:55.340]  got to bring the false system that's been projected over our republic and that
[22:55.340 --> 23:00.460]  is parasitically draining it we want to restore the republic we want to remove
[23:00.460 --> 23:05.940]  the false state homeland security north com that is integrated itself in like
[23:05.940 --> 23:11.060]  like the Vichy French Nazi occupying government over France we need to
[23:11.060 --> 23:15.860]  identify it's an occupying collaborator government literally that's not that's
[23:15.860 --> 23:20.620]  not rhetoric we have a literal corporate globalist eugenicist
[23:20.620 --> 23:24.780]  technocratic scientific takeover in their own words they all brag about it
[23:24.780 --> 23:28.780]  think you're dumb the enemy criminals always brag on their power trips to
[23:28.780 --> 23:33.700]  each other in books and white papers and c-span I'm telling you 100% their
[23:33.700 --> 23:37.220]  certified game plan is public you're not hearing my opinion that's why
[23:37.220 --> 23:41.380]  everything we told you about continues to come true in different permutations we
[23:41.380 --> 23:44.940]  don't know exactly how it's going to unfold but we know their goal we know
[23:44.940 --> 23:48.820]  history we know how things work we know how they never quit they only regroup
[23:48.820 --> 23:55.420]  well we don't ever quit and we always regroup we adapt we improvise we overcome
[23:55.420 --> 23:58.540]  because that's the animating contest of liberty that's where it is to be alive
[23:58.540 --> 24:03.580]  it's not work to fight tyranny it's like breathing you're gonna quit breathing
[24:03.580 --> 24:09.460]  because it's so much work no it's part of living so we've all got to up our game
[24:09.460 --> 24:14.460]  we've all got to take it up another notch that's how we're gonna beat them and I
[24:14.460 --> 24:18.620]  said to myself at about 630 I said I'm gonna come in and call for Obama to be
[24:18.620 --> 24:23.500]  arrested I'm gonna call for Christie to be arrested he's been caught lying of
[24:23.500 --> 24:27.660]  course he ordered this he got caught lying about who knew earlier claims he has
[24:27.660 --> 24:31.740]  thousands of employees so you never know when it's his number one henchman his
[24:31.740 --> 24:36.900]  underling his his head of his staff and stuff like this is what can bring things
[24:36.900 --> 24:41.260]  down something simple the public can get shutting a road down when people
[24:41.260 --> 24:44.780]  already got to pay 15 something dollars to go across on a toll road both ways
[24:44.780 --> 24:49.220]  being shut down to pick their kids up live their lives is some political war
[24:49.220 --> 24:53.380]  this is why they want control no normal person would think to do something like
[24:53.380 --> 24:58.300]  that inconveniencing hundreds of thousands of people for hours causing
[24:58.300 --> 25:04.100]  giant economic warfare terrorism this is terrorism but this is nothing compared
[25:04.100 --> 25:07.820]  to the real terrorism they engage in releasing the deadly flu bugs on record
[25:07.820 --> 25:11.380]  getting caught putting cancer viruses in the vaccines getting caught I'm just
[25:11.380 --> 25:17.620]  saying that look it up these people are murderers Bayer pharmaceuticals knowingly
[25:17.620 --> 25:23.140]  for 11 years had HIV and hepatitis and all their hemophiliac drug factor 8 and
[25:23.140 --> 25:28.840]  knowingly shipped it out and it was above just wanting the profit a death
[25:28.840 --> 25:33.020]  sentence to every person that got it hundreds of thousands died in the last
[25:33.020 --> 25:37.380]  20 years from this this broke 10 years ago went back 11 years before that Bill
[25:37.380 --> 25:40.860]  Clinton was involved the Canadian government was involved they firebomb
[25:40.860 --> 25:45.300]  doctors offices and robbed hemophiliac society the same night in the US and
[25:45.300 --> 25:52.420]  Canada when all this came out you understand that you understand that you
[25:52.420 --> 25:58.140]  understand that you understand who these people are they don't just not care
[25:58.140 --> 26:05.020]  about you they like hurting people they're bad bad people and you don't get
[26:05.020 --> 26:09.220]  into their clubs unless you're a sick crook you can look at Bill Clinton look
[26:09.220 --> 26:15.180]  at Obama look at Chris Christie look at those people they are evil you can look
[26:15.180 --> 26:19.860]  at Rand Paul and also look at his fruits he's real will he get intimidated
[26:19.860 --> 26:26.580]  threatened been sometimes I'm sure Confucius said that is the you know the
[26:26.580 --> 26:31.100]  grass bends but it comes right back the difference is he's not consciously evil
[26:31.100 --> 26:35.940]  and it wasn't for Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and us and the Drudge Report and the
[26:35.940 --> 26:39.580]  real media they would have passed their gunbands they would have gotten it ram
[26:39.580 --> 26:43.740]  through they would have gotten everything else they're doing now they're
[26:43.740 --> 26:47.300]  doing it by executive order and by executive action so we call them out as
[26:47.300 --> 26:51.540]  dictators we call them out as the frauds they are we tell it like it is and
[26:51.540 --> 26:58.140]  that's the simple action it hit me at 6 30 this morning that we've got to come
[26:58.140 --> 27:02.820]  out and call them dangerous would-be dictators who are overthrowing the
[27:02.820 --> 27:06.820]  country and who are occupiers and who are collaborators with foreign corporate
[27:06.820 --> 27:12.660]  interest and then I walked in here and AP reports Cruz calls president dangerous
[27:12.660 --> 27:18.380]  and terrifying and the media is going to try to punish him but all that does is
[27:18.380 --> 27:25.700]  making more popular Cruz calls president dangerous and terrifying and it's true
[27:25.700 --> 27:30.340]  we we have to have leadership that will call it like it is let me tell you
[27:30.340 --> 27:37.900]  something you have to have no dirt on you and you've got to have way those the
[27:37.900 --> 27:42.380]  size of watermelons to do that in his leadership role from a credible position
[27:42.380 --> 27:46.340]  this is the kind of person they fear ladies and gentlemen Ted Cruz look at
[27:46.340 --> 27:52.220]  him coming out at his level it's one thing to be Alex Jones and talk like
[27:52.220 --> 27:56.460]  this and it's another thing to be a news reporter and say things like that
[27:56.460 --> 28:01.140]  they'll come after you but when you start talking like that that's what can
[28:01.140 --> 28:06.020]  bring them down that's what scares them right there we need mayors we need police
[28:06.020 --> 28:12.300]  chiefs we need grand jury heads we need people that are in leadership positions
[28:12.300 --> 28:16.020]  preachers that are listening right now we're afraid to lose their 501c3 you
[28:16.020 --> 28:20.020]  don't need a 501c3 idiot you have the First Amendment you've not a government
[28:20.020 --> 28:25.060]  institution we need you to stop sitting there claiming you're just trying to
[28:25.060 --> 28:29.420]  save souls all day you're gonna save souls by exposing the huge demonic system
[28:29.420 --> 28:34.380]  around people not sitting up there acting authoritative and acting like a
[28:34.380 --> 28:39.420]  father figure to your so-called flock you preachers need to speak out against
[28:39.420 --> 28:46.180]  what's going on we need men and women of who have the hearts that love goodness
[28:46.180 --> 28:51.980]  to call the system out to tell it like it is now and and that's really the
[28:51.980 --> 28:56.020]  epiphany and it's really the same thing I say every day but it just hit me so
[28:56.020 --> 29:00.460]  hard because I get really upset and and not even so much down but just
[29:00.460 --> 29:07.180]  distraught over how real this is and if we could just wake people up to see it
[29:07.180 --> 29:10.700]  understand it the truth is the public is awake everything we talked about the
[29:10.700 --> 29:15.100]  NSA the checkpoints the spying the secret police the death squads they're
[29:15.100 --> 29:19.420]  trying to set all that up but they can't admit it exists because then there'll be
[29:19.420 --> 29:23.500]  a debate about what they've set up we forced them now to debate all this we're
[29:23.500 --> 29:28.660]  forcing them into the light we're identifying them we're tracking them
[29:28.660 --> 29:34.020]  like fighter pilots locking on target we're now locked on and now we've just
[29:34.020 --> 29:40.900]  got to pull the trigger punch the button fire away and take down the enemy
[29:40.900 --> 29:46.940]  politically good people have to take action and stand up and speak out stay
[29:46.940 --> 29:55.420]  with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:55.420 --> 29:57.820]  network

[30:05.340 --> 30:11.100]  with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess
[30:11.100 --> 30:15.460]  what else is in a halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here
[30:15.460 --> 30:20.300]  in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt
[30:20.300 --> 30:25.540]  producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[30:25.540 --> 30:31.500]  results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that
[30:31.500 --> 30:35.780]  had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important

[33:12.740 --> 33:28.900]  there is a war on for your mind so there's three keys to victory getting
[33:28.900 --> 33:33.980]  your heart right with God deciding which side you're on because there is good
[33:33.980 --> 33:37.540]  and evil in this world whether you believe in a spiritual realm or not there
[33:37.540 --> 33:44.100]  is the physical manifestation of things that we know are bad starving children
[33:44.100 --> 33:50.460]  poverty lies fraud systems based on coercion not on free will we need to
[33:50.460 --> 33:55.620]  decide especially people that work in the system we're not indicting you for
[33:55.620 --> 33:58.620]  being part of the system this happened incrementally we're all part of the
[33:58.620 --> 34:04.660]  system at one level or another but now you've got to make a decision about what
[34:04.660 --> 34:09.020]  you're going to do and where you're going to stand because going along with
[34:09.020 --> 34:12.980]  the system will not keep things going because this is a system designed to
[34:12.980 --> 34:18.900]  implode a system designed to be more oppressive and destructive over time
[34:18.900 --> 34:27.380]  not a better society and that's exactly what O'Brien in 1984 as he's finally
[34:27.380 --> 34:33.860]  breaking him after months in a torture dungeon explains him he says Winston
[34:33.860 --> 34:38.900]  we're not building a society that's gonna be better and that goes to the stars
[34:38.900 --> 34:43.620]  we're building a society that tramples and where you're trampled upon you guys
[34:43.620 --> 34:48.740]  print me the text it's 1984 is online everywhere just type in O'Brien
[34:48.740 --> 34:54.780]  trampling and being trampled on and then and then that'll pull up the
[34:54.780 --> 35:03.020]  paragraphs trampling and being trampled on because Winston was ready to sell out
[35:03.020 --> 35:06.460]  immediately being tortured within a day and he said no no no we're going to break
[35:06.460 --> 35:10.820]  your mind where you don't even know who you are anymore and then we're going to
[35:10.820 --> 35:15.940]  put you back together again believing whatever we tell you that there's no
[35:15.940 --> 35:19.260]  gravity or there is gravity that two plus two equals seven or it equals four
[35:19.260 --> 35:25.940]  or it equals 18 we're going to make you delusional like we are and then we're
[35:25.940 --> 35:30.660]  going to let you go drink synthetic gin for a few months and then we're going to
[35:30.660 --> 35:35.700]  come and shoot you in the back of the head and throw you into a furnace and
[35:35.700 --> 35:39.540]  your ashes will be dumped out into the atmosphere and you will have never of
[35:39.540 --> 35:48.420]  existed that was written by a MI6 high-level psych warfare technician
[35:48.420 --> 35:55.740]  George Arwell Eric Blair and when you read that book it is literally like the
[35:55.740 --> 35:59.620]  book O'Brien gives Winston when he's making him think that he's recruiting him
[35:59.620 --> 36:08.620]  into a secret liberty society that book 1984 is actually the Stalinistic
[36:08.620 --> 36:14.420]  Ingsoc program of Stalinistic systems integrated with English socialism to
[36:14.420 --> 36:19.820]  destroy the family destroy words and reduce people down to animals that
[36:19.820 --> 36:34.060]  grunt who serve the state this is their actual plan ladies and gentlemen so
[36:34.060 --> 36:38.820]  number one number one you have to understand you have to make a choice
[36:38.820 --> 36:43.100]  you have to make a choice and a lot of you are scared of this system and you
[36:43.100 --> 36:51.540]  should be but you should be scared of not fighting back we can stop this we
[36:51.540 --> 36:55.020]  can get a reprieve like Nineveh but we're going to have to really admit
[36:55.020 --> 37:00.740]  we're in deep you know what we're gonna have to really get real ladies and
[37:00.740 --> 37:05.060]  gentlemen a lot of people around us aren't able to handle this a lot of
[37:05.060 --> 37:08.900]  people are cracking up out there the numbers are there record suicide across
[37:08.900 --> 37:12.740]  the country not just in the military because the systems of fraud and people
[37:12.740 --> 37:16.940]  know that and they can't deal with it well I don't give the military people
[37:16.940 --> 37:20.940]  permission to kill themselves and God doesn't want you to either you should
[37:20.940 --> 37:26.740]  dedicate your life to helping others and to standing against the tyranny and to
[37:26.740 --> 37:32.300]  stopping abortions that's what you're gonna do you don't get the easy way out
[37:32.300 --> 37:35.780]  because you're depressed and know that you were part of a fraud or a lie or
[37:35.780 --> 37:41.140]  you're sick now because they put binary weapons into your bloodstream you're
[37:41.140 --> 37:43.860]  going to have to fight that's where you're going to find the answer to this
[37:43.860 --> 37:48.580]  and find your salvation and that's what I say to the police and the bureaucrats
[37:48.580 --> 37:52.540]  and the technicians and the advertisement people and all the brains out
[37:52.540 --> 37:57.220]  there and all the muscle and all of it we don't want to go down this road your
[37:57.220 --> 38:03.300]  gut knows that if you've got any good left in you out there and any consciousness
[38:03.300 --> 38:11.020]  you know we're in red level crisis and it's only gonna get more insane and as
[38:11.020 --> 38:14.940]  for me I'm not turning tail I'm not running I'm going head on into this a
[38:14.940 --> 38:17.900]  hundred and ten percent
[38:20.340 --> 38:27.060]  so number one admit we're facing evil pure synthesized evil because that's how
[38:27.060 --> 38:31.140]  it works it's a survival of the fittest social Darwinism of psychopaths and
[38:31.140 --> 38:39.260]  and and other forms of of criminality under them a literal legion of doom that
[38:39.260 --> 38:47.220]  competes with itself so it synthesizes the most nasty traits we have to stand
[38:47.220 --> 38:52.340]  against that at every level and have faith and have a will to resist you
[38:52.340 --> 38:59.460]  have to set your will against the enemy you have to set your will against them
[38:59.460 --> 39:04.780]  you have to make the decision that you're not going to lose the arm wrestling
[39:04.780 --> 39:08.500]  match you've got to make the decision that you're going to raise your kids
[39:08.500 --> 39:13.460]  right and be a good person you've got to make the decision that you're going to
[39:13.460 --> 39:17.140]  bench press 400 pounds you've got to make the decision you're gonna work hard
[39:17.140 --> 39:20.060]  and make the right decisions and it doesn't mean any of us are perfect you
[39:20.060 --> 39:24.820]  have to make the decision to get up out of bed in the morning we have to make
[39:24.820 --> 39:29.860]  the decision that we got poison in our stomach we ate bad food we got a vomit
[39:29.860 --> 39:33.340]  the new will order out we got to stick our fingers down our throats and get
[39:33.340 --> 39:37.860]  this poison out of us we've got to make the decision we wanted out and then that
[39:37.860 --> 39:42.580]  decision from that free will everything else flows so you got to make the
[39:42.580 --> 39:48.380]  decision got to decide which side you're on and then you've got to call out the
[39:48.380 --> 39:54.260]  enemy and say I set myself against you and then speak out and discredit them
[39:54.260 --> 39:57.980]  and then physically begin withdrawing your consent and it won't be at every
[39:57.980 --> 40:01.700]  level it won't be in every way it won't be perfect but the thought the
[40:01.700 --> 40:07.020]  intention to remove your support at every level and to challenge the system
[40:07.020 --> 40:12.500]  and to fight the system at every level and to build your own systems and to
[40:12.500 --> 40:17.020]  support other alternative systems this is the essence of Renaissance this is
[40:17.020 --> 40:20.940]  the essence of the Enlightenment this is the essence of common law it is the
[40:20.940 --> 40:28.940]  essence of freedom it is veritas you have to decide to wake up you have to
[40:28.940 --> 40:37.740]  decide to then face the enemy let me read to you from 1984 as he's been
[40:37.740 --> 40:42.700]  torturing him on the rack and just pulled one of his rotten teeth out do
[40:42.700 --> 40:48.220]  you begin to see then what kind of world we are creating it is the exact
[40:48.220 --> 40:55.660]  opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopia as the old reformers imagined a world
[40:55.660 --> 41:01.140]  of fear and treachery is torment a world of trampling and being trampled upon a
[41:01.140 --> 41:08.780]  world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself progress
[41:08.780 --> 41:16.420]  progressives in our world will be the progress towards more pain
[41:16.420 --> 41:22.660]  Agenda 21 the old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or
[41:22.660 --> 41:28.980]  justice ours is founded upon hatred in our world there will be no emotions
[41:28.980 --> 41:35.220]  except fear rage triumph and self abasement everything else we shall
[41:35.220 --> 41:39.700]  destroy everything already we are breaking down the habits of thought
[41:39.700 --> 41:44.020]  which have survived from before the revolution we have cut the links between
[41:44.020 --> 41:49.180]  child and parent and between man and man and between man and woman no one dares
[41:49.180 --> 41:54.260]  trust his wife or his child or a friend any longer but in the future there will
[41:54.260 --> 41:58.460]  be no wives and no friends children will be taken from their mothers at birth as
[41:58.460 --> 42:04.900]  one takes eggs from a hen the sex instinct will be eradicated procreation
[42:04.900 --> 42:09.860]  will be an annual formality like a renewal of a ration card we shall
[42:09.860 --> 42:14.140]  abolish the orgasm this has actually been done in North Korea by the way with
[42:14.140 --> 42:18.100]  about half the population our neurologist are working upon it now
[42:18.100 --> 42:22.420]  there will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party there will be no love
[42:22.420 --> 42:32.660]  except the love of big brother chapter 3 page 3 34
[42:35.820 --> 42:44.220]  read it he was brought in to the major BBC psych warfare facility see he wrote
[42:44.220 --> 42:47.380]  about this before he died he died right after this book came out by the way and
[42:47.380 --> 42:51.820]  it probably wasn't tuberculosis ladies and gentlemen arsenic poisoning is the
[42:51.820 --> 42:58.940]  word from the inside sources he was high level Fabian socialist fought with
[42:58.940 --> 43:04.140]  the communists in Spain you secret police in India came from an elite
[43:04.140 --> 43:10.420]  eugenics family tied into the Wedgewoods the Gaultons Darwin's all of them he
[43:10.420 --> 43:16.540]  came from a high level technocrat family and he wrote this book to warn people
[43:16.540 --> 43:21.620]  okay Eric Blair now I hope you understand this ladies and gentlemen this is
[43:21.620 --> 43:25.060]  what they're going to do this is what they write in their real publications
[43:25.060 --> 43:34.420]  this is what they've got planned total dishonor total evil total fraud total
[43:34.420 --> 43:40.060]  emptiness now do you like this plan because you hear that you read that from
[43:40.060 --> 43:46.900]  1984 and you realize today this is what's happening you realize today this is
[43:46.900 --> 43:52.140]  the world they're building openly now I'm gonna ask you all again do you want
[43:52.140 --> 43:56.780]  to openly serve this who likes this out there a very small percentage of people
[43:56.780 --> 44:00.860]  the most of you do it because the economy's been set up to where you can't
[44:00.860 --> 44:03.940]  live unless you work in this self-destroying system killing yourself to
[44:03.940 --> 44:09.700]  live killing your soul your honor everything your ancestors stood for in
[44:09.700 --> 44:17.900]  this total dishonor but I'll say this death before dishonor what's the green
[44:17.900 --> 44:23.020]  beret special forces motto overthrow oppressors look it up for me I forget
[44:23.020 --> 44:27.540]  the exact motto overthrow tyrants death to tyrants I mean where are those
[44:27.540 --> 44:32.500]  creeds out there of honorable people why have the best soldiers always been
[44:32.500 --> 44:35.820]  people who actually were honorable and believed they were fighting for a good
[44:35.820 --> 44:39.180]  cause and were battling against overwhelming odds why could men like
[44:39.180 --> 44:45.340]  that who were desperate for freedom desperate for justice one man could take
[44:45.340 --> 44:49.660]  out 10 men the samurai wrote about that the way of the samurai is
[44:49.660 --> 44:57.900]  desperateness 10 men cannot kill such a man where is that spirit I'm asking you
[44:57.900 --> 45:04.020]  now this is total dishonor worshiping a bunch of stunted gibbering spiritually
[45:04.020 --> 45:09.540]  and physically ugly elite who produce nothing but ugliness and hate those of
[45:09.540 --> 45:15.740]  us that are virtuous these people are an abomination it is an incredible honor
[45:15.740 --> 45:23.940]  and a pleasure to set myself against them I am no hero I am red-blooded man to
[45:23.940 --> 45:29.220]  define someone who stands against this evil as a hero is an abomination
[45:29.220 --> 45:37.380]  sucking air into my lungs I'm not a hero I'm alive and it oxygenates my red blood
[45:37.380 --> 45:46.980]  I'm alive I'm a human I like good things that's not heroic I stand against evil
[45:46.980 --> 45:52.300]  that's not heroic I burn with a desire for liberty and to see others and
[45:52.300 --> 45:58.740]  powered I burn for humanity to work together and build incredible systems
[45:58.740 --> 46:04.940]  and structures and colonized space I dream of our potential being reached
[46:04.940 --> 46:11.500]  that's not heroic my body will die but I want my children to go on and their
[46:11.500 --> 46:14.940]  children to go on and their children to go on and to be honorable men and women
[46:14.940 --> 46:18.860]  I want to maintain the human species not let it be mutated and destroyed
[46:18.860 --> 46:25.820]  vandalized by these demons for their own power trips they had a Satanist a few
[46:25.820 --> 46:30.540]  decades ago that went and killed the treaty oak where the Texas Constitution
[46:30.540 --> 46:35.940]  Declaration of Independence was filled out and he buried several hundred pounds
[46:35.940 --> 46:41.100]  of weed killer into the roots of it in a satanic ritual believing he's power out
[46:41.100 --> 46:45.340]  of killing the tree it's like they think it power out a torturing a little baby
[46:45.340 --> 46:52.100]  for 10 hours and in that you understand who they are they want to kill this
[46:52.100 --> 46:58.460]  planet in a disgusting sacrifice to Bathomet well I'll tell Bathomet and
[46:58.460 --> 47:02.820]  all his followers this you are losers from the beginning and you'll always be
[47:02.820 --> 47:08.820]  losers and you'll never extinguish the Creator's creations only the Creator can
[47:08.820 --> 47:14.140]  do that and you can't get my soul and I'm going to do my best to warn other
[47:14.140 --> 47:19.220]  people so that their souls can't be sucked out by you people you're disgusting
[47:19.220 --> 47:29.620]  and you want to throw up to liberate the oppressed is the US Army Special Forces
[47:29.620 --> 47:34.980]  slogan well are you liberating the oppressed or are you supporting Al Qaeda
[47:34.980 --> 47:39.100]  to oppress all over the Middle East that's why our military said we're not
[47:39.100 --> 47:43.060]  going to do it and there's going to be a military coup we're going to start
[47:43.060 --> 47:47.940]  shooting people if you do an air raid and back Al Qaeda in Syria I mean that's
[47:47.940 --> 47:52.260]  that's basically what was relayed and the establishment blinked ladies and
[47:52.260 --> 47:56.300]  gentlemen and they can blink all the way if we just stand against these people
[47:56.300 --> 48:01.900]  and commit it's over for the New World Order doesn't mean evil won't keep coming
[48:01.900 --> 48:05.300]  back doesn't mean we might not blow the earth up five years from now the point
[48:05.300 --> 48:11.140]  is you have to make the spiritual decision or the decision in your core
[48:11.140 --> 48:18.220]  whatever is at your heart that you do not want to be part of this 1984 scenario
[48:18.220 --> 48:25.100]  and look at it it's all manifesting because 1984 is a historical futurist
[48:25.100 --> 48:32.180]  allegory of what the world would look like and Eric Blair George Arwell pen
[48:32.180 --> 48:38.300]  name and Julian Huxley and Aldous Huxley because the Huxley's wrote books
[48:38.300 --> 48:43.380]  about this would have debates about whether it be a 1984 system or a brave
[48:43.380 --> 48:48.380]  new world system and Huxley said the brave new world system is the dominant
[48:48.380 --> 48:56.140]  one being adopted with an integration with your 1984 stylistic scenario and
[48:56.140 --> 49:01.180]  both those books one written in 1948 1984 and the other written in 1932 brave
[49:01.180 --> 49:06.300]  new world if you read both those books they've now both of them come about 75
[49:06.300 --> 49:12.140]  80% true and you can see the decks of cards being being shuffled in together
[49:12.140 --> 49:16.980]  and then you can go read where they wrote countless nonfiction books where
[49:16.980 --> 49:20.340]  this is the plan to build this
[49:21.500 --> 49:28.860]  so understand ladies and gentlemen you're under attack and the family is
[49:28.860 --> 49:33.860]  under attack and everything good is under attack and that we are seeing the
[49:33.860 --> 49:38.180]  beginnings of a societal level collapse and mass mental illness and
[49:38.180 --> 49:45.140]  artificially induced self-righteous narcissism events where people care
[49:45.140 --> 49:50.540]  about being the top parrot on the tree instead of being a human who's conscious
[49:50.540 --> 49:56.060]  and awake everything is going into basically low-level simian drive and
[49:56.060 --> 50:04.780]  the society is becoming very base and dishonorable and empty and I don't
[50:04.780 --> 50:09.580]  want to be part of that and believe me I know it's hard with your family my
[50:09.580 --> 50:15.020]  family all of us even when you know this knowledge at a great level your flesh
[50:15.020 --> 50:18.340]  is still strong and none of us are perfect but you just have to make the
[50:18.340 --> 50:22.300]  decision in your heart and you have to do what Ted Cruz has done coming out
[50:22.300 --> 50:25.660]  saying the president is dangerous and terrifying because even if he's just a
[50:25.660 --> 50:29.740]  figurehead Obama for the corrupt system that's what the public archetypally
[50:29.740 --> 50:37.300]  sees we must expose the fraud of the system by exposing Obama and notice
[50:37.300 --> 50:44.220]  Cruz has been catapulted to world renown voted the most important political
[50:44.220 --> 50:49.780]  person in the world even before the pope last week in a major poll because he
[50:49.780 --> 50:54.460]  has some courage and tells it like it is and that's the other answer people are
[50:54.460 --> 50:58.300]  looking for leadership face the facts speak out against the system become a
[50:58.300 --> 51:09.140]  leader now in the u.s. one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year

[01:00:51.860 --> 01:01:00.500]  a scholar coming on Elizabeth Price Foley getting into Obama's classical
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:06.700]  tyrannical abuses that are out in the open professor Foley is a founding
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:12.220]  member of the FIU College of Law constitutional law and she's a practice
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:16.380]  law before the US Supreme Court you name it she's a big fish with the Cato
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:24.060]  Supreme Court review we're gonna get her on to from a legal perspective break
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:29.380]  down what Ted Cruz also a constitutional lawyer is saying Cruz calls
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:34.900]  president dangerous and terrifying I mean that's what it is I mean I'd call
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:42.460]  jumping into an African river with 25-foot crocodiles in it dangerous and
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:47.300]  terrifying I mean that's basically what this is but it's even more deadly and
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:53.140]  believe me folks Ted Cruz I would not fly on small private planes they tend to
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:58.180]  blow those up and I mean I'm not kidding the serious courage you've got to
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.500]  admire it because believe me this is not what they want they're coming after him
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:07.700]  for it he knows it that's a big deal now in other news we're gonna cover this
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:11.860]  more when group gets on with us something about radiation I've told the
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:16.860]  crew that when I get stuff wrong to correct me what you do a lot because you
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:20.060]  get on air and you're talking and there's cameras and lights and all these
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:23.820]  articles you're thinking about so much you get stuff wrong so a key correction
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:28.220]  because once I get stuff stuck in my head I keep saying it wrong they found
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:34.540]  fourteen hundred percent increase in radiation on San Francisco beaches not
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:45.560]  fourteen hundred times fourteen hundred percent increase I mean it was like last
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:49.140]  week I did something where I misread an article about gun control stuff in
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.980]  Canada and then saw another article about a university that sounded like
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.740]  Quebec but was Quinn a back I think and then later I like conflated the two
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.780]  articles together because I didn't have them in front of me and just I heard the
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:05.780]  rebroadcast and it was just it was it was it was basically a brain fart and
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:10.100]  I mean look I don't script what I say I just do the research and then put it out
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:13.860]  there and my brain still works pretty good but I'm not as young as I used to
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:17.820]  be and I don't have a photographic memory as well like it in the past so I've
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:21.900]  got to be more careful about stuff because it's just it gets jumbled
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.980]  together plus I work a lot harder than I ever have in my life I've learned how to
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:30.580]  work on a lot of days 15 16 hours straight with no breaks except for you
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:38.380]  know brushing my teeth or eating and I don't know it's it's turned me into a
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:45.700]  different person because I know a lot more I'm more seasoned I'm older and I
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:53.020]  get more stuff done but my brain has been rewired and it's it's really weird
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:58.000]  that's it's and of course changes in the mind changes in the body it's it's part
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.460]  of life it's all part of this this experience that is the incredible gift
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:08.740]  of consciousness that our Creator has given us out there on a planet hurtling
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:12.780]  through the deep void of space surrounded by so much wonderment I mean
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:18.420]  wow what an incredible thing I think that's why I'm saddest you know for my
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:23.700]  uncle passing because I know he goes on but you know in this plane of existence
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:29.500]  knowing him in that experience and never being able to talk to him in in this
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.860]  life I was talking to one of my friends last night he was talking about his
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:37.100]  grandfather who he lived with when he was a kid and he said three times a week
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.740]  at least he has dreams where he has dinner with him and talks to him and
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:44.100]  says in the dream I thought you were dead and he's like nope no partner I'm no
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:48.500]  part I'm still here with you and it's like we're almost like real
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:52.620]  conversations and I've had those kind of conversations with one of my
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:05:00.940]  grandfathers who died when I was about I guess 22 23 my mother's father Alex Jones
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:04.860]  here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the entire

[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.220]  he didn't know anything about it and has been involved in a cover-up and
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.460]  obviously gave the orders for the shutdown of the bridge there's no way

[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.940]  information to third parties and of course if you believe that I'll sell you
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:23.380]  the Golden Gate Bridge and throw in the moon for free I mean look folks you
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:29.260]  don't have to believe him or not believe this this piece of trash you have to go
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:33.900]  look at what the black boxes do globally mandated these have gone in England
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:39.020]  Australia Germany this is the globalist and they make you pay for it I was
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:43.300]  seeing numbers that Dr. Stalman put out a few years ago for something like 30% of
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:47.620]  a smartphone is all the spy tech they put in and tracker systems to track you
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:52.300]  same thing with a television sets got all this stuff now to track what you're
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:55.580]  watching and what you're doing and to not let you plug in other devices and
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:11:01.500]  play things in a quote stop piracy thousands of dollars of cost in a car
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.780]  are these surveillance systems that's why the feds came out last year and said
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:09.420]  we're going to start taxing you by the mile and now they're coming out with
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:14.020]  global warming warning labels proposed for California gas pumps and that again
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:19.660]  out of CBS San Francisco is to prepare you for the carbon tax that they're
[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:25.700]  going to implement for global warming even though they're totally discredited
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:29.700]  they don't care they just need the illusion that they have an excuse so you
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:33.020]  feel like they have the moral authority and then even debate these fraudsters
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:37.700]  even if carbon dioxide is bad which obviously it isn't in the atmosphere
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.980]  compared to all the other stuff that's happening in and then we're at a low
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:44.140]  level historically in the plants grow faster and more oxygen is put out this
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:50.700]  is just part of the carbon cycle they're not doing this to stop it they're not
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:55.820]  misguided they're doing it to control and surveil the entire carbon cycle on
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:59.700]  the planet to control everything you do under agenda 21 to set down this to
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:06.380]  shut down the civilization on record so there you go it makes my head spin
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:10.420]  meanwhile McClatchy reports Obama works to craft response to surveillance
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:14.460]  uproar and we've already seen the response a White House report three
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:17.420]  weeks ago admitting that certain corporations use it for financial gain
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:21.380]  that everybody's surveilling everybody and then he said it's terrible and
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:26.220]  horrible when he's helped supercharge it that's what Obama does the NDAA is just
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:31.380]  terrible that's why I signed it and wrote it it's just terrible that Al Qaeda is
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:35.660]  murdering all the Christians in Syria that's why we're funding them to do it
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:39.780]  again because the public doesn't know where Syria is the public doesn't know
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:44.820]  Shiite versus Sunni they don't know the basic players they know the football
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:50.220]  players they know who the supermodels are they know all this stuff that doesn't
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:55.980]  matter people aren't actually stupid they're their minds and their systems of
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:03.740]  understanding complexity is in baseball scores men will walk up to me anywhere
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:07.820]  the gym the street anywhere and just go hey you know some such broke the record
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:12.740]  of the 1942 streak of blah blah blah they'll see if I respond back and I'm
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:17.780]  just like man I tell you I mainly focus on business and politics for factoids
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:24.060]  and stuff yeah I used to like baseball but I just you know I and there are
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:28.460]  always people that don't care about anything else themselves like the whole
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:30.900]  country is going to hell in a handbasket they have no self-preservation
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:35.100]  because they're arrested development children whose whole world is about
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:40.140]  spectating so all my favorite movies my favorite shows my my favorite books
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:45.260]  fiction and all my favorite sports teams and knowing all the male soap opera
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:52.300]  info that's all sports is male soap opera simulated combat simulated war with
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:57.260]  the generals on the sidelines and in the quarterbacks the war chief the platoon
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:01.420]  leader the centurion leader out there leading the forces I mean they've got
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:05.940]  the armor on and it's literally been sold and pushed for hundreds of years
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:11.140]  thousands going back to Rome to steal your entire future and I'm not even
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:15.940]  indicting you for liking it I'm just saying be aware of that do you you know
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:20.460]  how much success you can have just in life with this data separately just in
[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:26.140]  business the system doesn't want you to be informed I actually listened to Carl
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:31.700]  Rove years ago during the Super Bowl we went one Sunday during the Super Bowl to
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:37.300]  a steakhouse with the crew the guys were in there some Wes and others and we
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:41.820]  listened to them actually heard Rove making fun of idiots watching the NFL
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:46.980]  game because one of the oil men he was with their wives brought up the game
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:50.940]  and Carl Rove was laughing about it and basically saying you know I focus on how
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:56.300]  the world works and yeah that's the thing the evil people that's how he was
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:59.540]  laughing I had to leave after 20 minutes I couldn't listen to it anymore I was
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:02.820]  going to confront him after we we we got there looked over Carl Rove's there
[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:06.060]  ordered our started order food I said no no no after 20 minutes we're not
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:10.620]  ordering food we're out of here because I wanted to confront him I should have
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:14.380]  confronted with the video camera and left but I literally was tired already
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:18.220]  gonna show that day and I didn't want to sit there till our meal was done
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:23.100]  listening to the demonic jirbling is the word I would use out of turd blossom
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:28.700]  that's his nickname bushhead for him and that's the thing is your victims that
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:33.900]  they're laughing at you and I want you to learn how the real world works Fed
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:38.740]  moves to block discovery of NSA lawsuits NSA spying since data clients north of
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:44.300]  the border a chunky cheerful tracking device to keep tabs on your child all
[01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:49.220]  this stuff is coming out ladies and gentlemen so we're gonna be getting more
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:53.980]  into that coming up Russian celebrity claims she was stripped naked by TSA
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:16:01.340]  Russian TV model and TV star said that the TSA agent took her clothes off this
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:04.620]  is now a big scandal I mean people from other countries India Russia they
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:09.420]  freak out when they come here because no authoritarians like Miss USA actually
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:13.460]  go in the pants in the line into the woman's body that happened to miss USA
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:17.520]  in Dallas she was crying and witnesses saw it I mean you know that's normal
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.980]  people said oh we'll get tough let me tell you something I mean when you're
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:26.820]  in bed with your wife and you're having relations at first it's a it's electric
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:29.880]  and a little uncomfortable at first you get going I mean I don't want to get into
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:33.900]  details here but everybody knows that imagine this is outsiders putting their
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:37.740]  hands on your body this is rape ladies and gentlemen but see the state has
[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:42.900]  taken the unreal and made it real the pedophilia training of the children in
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:46.780]  the schools and then with the TSA all in the name of stopping al-Qaeda the
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:50.740]  government openly runs and now they're saying oh it's not for al-Qaeda it's for
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.300]  domestic groups and the FBI's main mission is terrorism and the Tea Party
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:58.780]  and domestic groups labeling us the real Americans that know what's happening as
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:05.100]  the enemy also report freed Guantanamo detainee involved in Benghazi attack I
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:08.980]  told you it's come out they train real terrorists there to be al-Qaeda forces to
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:15.060]  lead attacks in Syria in Libya in Iraq our government does an actual training
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:19.540]  base that came out years ago they take people that aren't terrorists and turn
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:25.220]  them into terrorists double triple agents now we're gonna have dr. group with
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.260]  us about 10 minutes in the next hour I appreciate him coming to us in Texas
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:33.580]  he's also going to be on the TV show today as well the nightly news we're
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.980]  gonna talk a little bit about Fukushima a little bit about radiation
[01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:42.580]  nation item but then we're gonna get into the conspiracy using estrogens in
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:48.620]  everything that's on record to control us but here is the Santa Cruz Sentinel
[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:52.940]  state rebuffs radiation concerns at beach a YouTube video taught about radio
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:56.260]  host Alex Jones shows elevated radioactivity at Half Moon Bay which
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:59.920]  prompted San Mateo County health officials to alert the state but the
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:03.300]  state said this week that the radiation is naturally occurring and seen often
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:07.420]  along California's eroding coastline but admitted that it was 500% higher than
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:13.060]  normal and they go on to break down you know the fact that the public doesn't
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.580]  trust the media and thinks there's a cover up our reporters are coming up the
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:19.740]  last 20 minutes from the ground there where they found a lot of low levels
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:23.300]  along along the coast and some high levels but the good news is most areas
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:28.900]  are not radioactive on the coastline places like Santa Cruz you name it we're
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:32.660]  on the radio do not have a radiation level so that's some good news Dr.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:36.060]  Groups thanks for coming in with us just briefly on the Fukushima issue that
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:39.300]  we're going to break and coming back with this detailed breakdown you've got
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:44.500]  on the situation with the estrogen well thanks for having me on it's always good
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.540]  to be on your show I mean everybody's talking about Fukushima's been in the
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:51.180]  news everywhere and you're doing a good job of you know educating people out
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:55.460]  there and how they can protect themselves I mean there's no better time
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:58.860]  right now than for people to start looking at their environment looking at
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:01.980]  their health starting to clean their body starting to looking at the type of
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:07.260]  foods that they eat drinking clean water breathing clean air so I I'm
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:10.820]  constantly recommending to people you know you you really have to take a look
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:14.460]  because there's already been reports of birth defects around California up into
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:18.500]  Washington Oregon I mean our phone is ringing off the hook on with people
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.900]  saying what can I do people all over the world are saying what can I do the
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:25.780]  radiation levels are going up if it's just that they're not they're only you
[01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:30.380]  know 20 30 40% what they should be in other areas so when I say good news you
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:33.740]  know it's it's it's not good news if you absorb one of the hot particles yeah
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:37.300]  exactly the good news is there's always a solution for every situation I mean
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.580]  regardless of how bad it gets if you know the right people you know where to
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:44.260]  go you take responsibility for your own health you can protect your own cell to
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:48.540]  your water take nascent iodine we'll talk about later after we get into the
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:52.220]  issue of the estrogen back into the radiation with Dr. Edward Groob I'm

[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:11.540]  all right we got Dr. Group up here from South Texas to cover this stuff so I'm
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:15.340]  not gonna get any more news now except this one when I tell you they trained
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:19.860]  the Benghazi attack force at Guantanamo Bay that's really what it is they take
[01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:23.540]  innocent people there mainly and literally torture them brainwash them
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:29.060]  they have a CIA mind control base on the base that's on record this is Breitbart
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:32.740]  report freed Guantanamo detainee involved in Benghazi attack well here's
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:39.740]  the rest of the story here's AP from last year secret CIA Guantanamo facility
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:44.940]  trained prisoners to be double agents you see and I got a whole stack Guantanamo
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:50.940]  Bay prisoners worked as double agents for CIA New York Daily News okay so I'm
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:55.020]  telling you folks they trained the current Alcada commanders at this base as
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:25:00.100]  the next generation now going back to Dr. Ed Group here doc you've got the floor
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:03.900]  this short segment long segment coming up get into people know about Bisphenol
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:07.820]  A and all those other stuff but what about the estrogen mimicers I know your
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:11.540]  dad was a you know famous chemist and all the rest of it so you're very well
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:17.020]  versed on this and expose it break down where it said what they're doing what
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:21.180]  it's done to society well over the last ten years I've been getting increased
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:27.620]  calls from estrogen dominance in males especially feminism and women that have
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:31.980]  decreased testosterone levels you know increases in ovarian cancer increases in
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:36.900]  prostate cancer men getting man boobs children being born with smaller
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:40.380]  penises I mean all this stuff has been going on so I took the time and did the
[01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:44.580]  research and try to figure it out and put it all together on what's really
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:48.460]  happened you know I like to figure out the root cause of the problem so we can
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:52.580]  come around and try to fix the problem and what it led me to find out is a lot
[01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:56.180]  of different things that we've talked about in this conspiracy it's not a
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:59.540]  conspiracy because it's really happening it's a literal eugenics and
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:04.300]  depopulation scheme that's going on and there's two points to this scheme and
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:08.780]  one is well with population control you're going to either increase the
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:11.940]  death rate which they're doing already through chemicals and everything or
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:16.380]  you're going to decrease the birth rate so what I want to talk about is how
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:19.860]  they're actually decreasing the birth rate and how they're doing it is they're
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:26.940]  using a multitude of chemicals and it's lowering the testosterone levels I mean
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:31.900]  this is even happening in the wombs because in the womb the fetus everybody
[01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:35.900]  is actually in the fetal state a female and the brain is a female and it
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:42.020]  doesn't the fetus changes to a male with the introduction of testosterone and
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:47.900]  that's what causes the ovary to form into testicles and it also causes the
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:52.860]  brain of the fetus to become either male or female so what happens with all
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:57.860]  these endocrine disruptors and endocrine glands are just anything and that's
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:01.700]  happening to the fish and amphibians now too well they're becoming they're
[01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:05.660]  becoming bisexual well because of all the the chemicals the endocrine
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:09.180]  disrupting chemical and it'll be bisexual in sexual activity they're
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:13.100]  becoming hematrodites they're becoming this is what they're doing to us this is
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:16.860]  what they said they would do in Brave New World exactly and that's what's
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:20.260]  happening there's being like in Peru there's eight women being born to every
[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:24.380]  one male when the woman is under stress it's there's more miscarriages as males
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:28.500]  too because basically the number one reason that we're dealing with this is
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:32.980]  pesticides I've identified seven ways and seven things that they're using to
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:37.940]  reduce our testosterone levels the first thing is pesticides look at roundup
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:40.780]  which is being sprayed all over the place is the number one pesticide in the
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:44.820]  world it's a it's an estrogen mimicar and it also blocks testosterone that's
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:49.740]  the glyphosate that's the glyphosate also you have atrazine which is being
[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:52.780]  sprayed on all the corn genetically modified corn which is a company for
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:58.220]  syngenta which produces that so you have PCBs you have bisphenols you have all
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:02.260]  different types of endocrine disruptors and it's happening in males where now
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:05.900]  where we used to see low testosterone around 30 years old we're starting to
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:10.020]  see it much sooner and what you were saying about the frogs even there's
[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:15.700]  male frogs that are actually disrupted because the what what nobody's talking
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:20.220]  about really is the disruption you can be born a male but have a female brain
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:24.740]  because it during gestation or when you're in the womb there's certain they
[01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:28.740]  found that with chickens and chemicals too and and that's why a male chicken if
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:33.020]  it needs to convert to a female exactly and that's my whole point is it that's
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:38.020]  why we need to you identify these sources so people can avoid them and also
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:43.060]  increase the testosterone naturally in women and men and men because you know
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:47.140]  we we're coming into a society where men are lazy they're not masculine anymore
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:51.020]  they look pregnant I mean just walk around and you see men with these bellies
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:54.660]  and these man boobs walking around it's because they're they have high estrogen
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:58.700]  levels and low testosterone levels so and this is going you know from the
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:02.180]  1940s is when this started and it all started with the Rockefellers and the
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:05.420]  Rothschilds because and you're gonna talk about how we counter this coming up
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:09.660]  but I mean this is the real deal this is the real deal it's scary because the
[01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:13.740]  with the Rockefellers owning standard oil and and and Exxon mobile and all
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:16.700]  that these are all petroleum-based products right so they have to profit
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:21.020]  from these things so why not profit by selling all these plasticizers and
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:23.620]  everything else stay there stay there this is incredible you're gonna have a
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:26.740]  floor when we come back and I want to say something everybody out there you know
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:29.980]  when I cover this all the big establishment liberal publications that
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:34.420]  are really authoritarian come out and say Alex is anti-gay he's saying the
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:39.500]  chemicals are making people gay folks it's making the frogs gay and nothing
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:43.780]  against people that the folks did stuff back in Rome or whatever yeah I'm not
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:46.380]  I'm not saying there aren't people that aren't like this naturally the point is
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:50.300]  this is being done artificially on purpose you should know we're on the
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:58.340]  march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:37.900]  ladies and gentlemen the information we're about to break down is of the
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:42.740]  highest import I'm going to give Dr. Group the floor now to walk through this
[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:46.700]  but the crew while he's talking is searching the terms he's putting out
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:53.500]  here's the BBC US military pondered love not war a gay bomb chemicals to be
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:34:00.820]  sprayed on the men to make them basically have female type reactions to
[01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:05.660]  war to everything and again females have three times the connections on average
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:09.260]  between left and right hemisphere which makes them more intuitive actually
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:14.420]  smarter in many ways but not able to focus and not able to deal with warfare
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:18.780]  and death and other things or mathematics on average as much as men and
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:22.180]  of course they just had big studies come out last month on that subject with
[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:25.580]  brain scans it's a fact ladies and gentlemen okay I mean you don't see
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:29.460]  world champions that are women at chess ever just like you don't see men having
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:33.700]  babies it's because it's two different two different deals but here it is US
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:40.540]  military pondered love not war there's another one WebMD that BPA causes in the
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:44.900]  fetuses of babies hormone levels to create a
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:49.300]  mafroditic responses and it could actually physically make you have both
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:55.020]  genitalia but more often it simply has the brain develop as a quasi female
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:58.740]  brain this this is mainline science so these people should not be hated I
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:03.300]  don't get mad because you know like I'm some you know person all obsessed and
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:07.540]  uptight oh my gosh you know women like women or men like men my issue is this
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:10.580]  has been chemically done that's why it's exploding that's why women look
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:15.420]  different now and look like men that's why men act like women they are women
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:20.140]  they're attracted to men because they're a woman and I don't dislike them
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:24.220]  because of that the fact is though this is meant as they said it in brave new
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:27.740]  world and as they said in brave new world revisited which is nonfiction this
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:32.220]  is the plan this is the chemical warfare plan and this is what these
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:36.180]  chemicals do and folks this is their plan when I talk about this the
[01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:41.540]  establishment media goes completely ape when I tell you that if your children
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:45.420]  drink out of bisphenol a juice line boxes the male genitals won't drop as
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:49.860]  early they won't develop they'll have problems it will rewire the brain and
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:56.620]  cause sexual responses that are feminine but you do this to the babies you will
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:36:01.140]  end up with a hybrid male female and that's why that's becoming so incredibly
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:04.420]  popular is because this has been chemically done but it's happening to
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:08.700]  the other mammals to the other amphibians it's happening to fish this is
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:13.660]  the real deal they're having fish now that are both sexes that it's not in
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:17.540]  that species this is happening that were some cases two-thirds of the frogs
[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:22.980]  down in Houston are bisexual and then the media makes a joke and go he's making
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:26.100]  fun of gay people folks this is being done and then that's just the
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:31.380]  sexualization what about the cancer rates what about what about the the the
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:37.300]  other problems in the organs dr. grip you've got the floor break it down for
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:42.380]  people this eugenics conspiracy against our hormones and what you call
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:47.060]  operation testosterone go ahead well there's three points to it number one is
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:51.860]  they wanted they want sterility number two they want a separation of males and
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:56.340]  females and number three they want gender manipulation and they're doing gender
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:59.340]  manipulation by putting these chemicals in while you're in the fetus
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:04.660]  because when the brains develop you even if it's a male let's say and it
[01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:07.500]  doesn't in the hormones aren't correct in the female if you have all these
[01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:12.100]  hormone blockers and endocrine disruptors and that brain doesn't get
[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:17.060]  what it needs to become masculine and and the children end up the males end up
[01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:21.940]  with genitalia but they end up with a female brain the genitals are smaller
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:28.180]  this genitals are smaller the penis is usually smaller they you know they
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:32.980]  think like a female they want to put they want to put on dresses and stuff
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:37.260]  like that I mean and this is just at this has been proven to happen and this
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:42.780]  is happening on a large scale right now at anything there's so many different
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:45.780]  endocrine disruptors out there we talked about and that's why California says
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:49.100]  we've got to let the boys go whatever bathroom they want because they're being
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:53.260]  chemically hit and the higher level people know this it's a program I mean
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:58.540]  the American Chemical Association came out with the whole plan to ban BPA and
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:03.020]  baby bottles but they it was a diversion technique because that baby
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:06.620]  bottles was the only thing he never really had BPA in it to begin with it's
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:11.340]  just it was a cover-up so they could still use BPA and all the other plastics
[01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:16.400]  in everything else lining lining cans I mean this separation this feminism
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:20.740]  masculinism thing goes back a long time even to the fact when they introduce
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:26.660]  microwaves because phthalates are a toxic endocrine disruptor which makes
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:31.580]  plastics it all goes back to plastics to it makes plastics flexible so they come
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:35.380]  out with microwave ovens so that you know and canned foods a long time ago
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:38.980]  which was planned so women wouldn't have to cook anymore because women were
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:42.220]  getting they wanted to get women in the end on record the White House Science
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:46.260]  Art admits this they then put it into the water put it into the food chain put
[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:49.900]  it into the plastics to then reduce the fertility and engage in social
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:53.260]  engineering yet at the same time what they're trying to do is separate the
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:58.700]  family because another part of this whole situation with Operation Testosterone
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:02.620]  is to separate the family they know strong core family values when the
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:06.700]  husband and wife are together they're having children but whenever you can
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:11.500]  create disruptions in hormones they they have higher divorce rates higher
[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:15.940]  separation rates the when they can say oh it's easy to cook now just throw your
[01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:19.260]  canned foods in and the whole and the woman and the man are activated by the
[01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:23.380]  olfactory when the men don't have the right chemicals the woman is not
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:29.340]  attracted and does not want to merge with the male on a team level she's not
[01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:34.540]  picking up the things that trigger the ganglia in the brain that then
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:37.980]  activates the instincts this is chemical warfare well that's exactly right
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:41.420]  because when they introduced birth control pills by the way birth control
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:46.220]  pills were introduced by the woman that was heading the eugenics program when
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:50.020]  they introduced birth control pills they knew for a fact that it would alter the
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:54.060]  way a woman picked the male so what happens is you have the women on birth
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:58.060]  control pills and they on birth control pills they want a male that's like a
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:40:01.820]  father figure they don't want the big strong masculine male they want the
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:05.480]  male that's going to be taking care of them and then and be there for them when
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:09.460]  they get off of birth control pills they because they're they're fair
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:13.420]  let's explain they're in they're in a pregnant phase artificially pregnant the
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:17.940]  brain believes on the pills they're looking for a male that is more feminine
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:22.060]  when actually a woman's on the hunt she's looking for a hyper male but they
[01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:26.740]  put him into an artificial system so they pick a male incorrectly that's right
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:30.980]  which then breeds which then breeds weak people who are subservient exactly and
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:33.980]  they know that too so they don't want those strong relationships they don't
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:37.460]  want people you know strong families they don't want people you know having a
[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:42.380]  lot of kids anymore because they know especially when they can break the
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:46.900]  family values up then that's going to alter and affect the children as well so
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:50.420]  the way that they're doing it is they're doing it through birth control pills
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:53.300]  they're doing it through chemicals in the food they're doing it through chemicals
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:57.100]  in the air all of these things that we talk about heavy metals are endocrine
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:02.540]  disruptors aluminum mercury lead cadmium all of your cleaning supplies out
[01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:07.020]  there I mean DDT look at DDT that was used Agent Orange all of the pesticides
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:12.020]  that continually cause endocrine disruption and all of them really block
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:15.580]  testosterone and alter the amount of estrogen which which I noticed it's a
[01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:18.660]  similar chemical and birds I'm an ornithologist I forget the name of it
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:23.980]  that's why DDT would actually not just cause thinner shells but it would also
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:29.460]  end up making most the chicks female so again because I guess they're going
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:34.780]  through a similar hormonal programming once that egg gets fertilized yeah it's
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:38.540]  really a sad situation I mean one of the newest things why are you against gay
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:43.060]  birds I'm not again shouldn't we have everything be sterilized I'm against the
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:46.140]  government trying to control the population and the government try I'm
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:49.500]  just here to try to report my findings just like you so everybody can wait
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:52.100]  continue going through these because you've got the studies all of it right
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:55.220]  there yeah I mean one of the latest things and you know you know this is the
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:59.100]  push for hand sanitizers I mean look at how many hand sanitizers are out there
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:03.020]  right now guys search that hand sanitizer sterilizes you that's that's
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:10.340]  sanitizers are alcohol base and alcohol in itself beer wine general alcohol is
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:13.940]  an endocrine disruptor it lowers your testosterone levels we've gone to a
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:17.980]  sedentary lifestyle people aren't exercising as much that lowers testosterone
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:21.740]  levels every single thing is part of this plan the Rockefellers are the ones
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:26.460]  that created porn if you look at at guys now they want to take guy these guys
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:31.260]  that are born with low testosterone levels or the low testosterone in the
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:36.060]  fetuses they're growing up more feminine and they're scared of women they're not
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:41.460]  as masculine enough they're just as happy which is a diversion technique
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:45.260]  they're just as happy watching porn and masturbating to porn than they would
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:48.140]  be if they were going out there and getting women and by the way this is
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:51.700]  admit everything you're saying is in all the studies and they broke that
[01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:56.060]  down saying they would popularize porn not to make it fun you know as they sell
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:43:00.980]  it but to literally give people a simulator so the real thing doesn't
[01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:05.340]  happen and then to also screw up relationships and listen to this it
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:09.140]  even goes as far as condoms and dildos because dildos are made let's not get
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:13.500]  too much with it with it seriously it's let's just say sexual age because they
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:18.860]  can take the dioxins and I mean you're putting that inside the woman so that
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:23.780]  alone is causing massive disruption of the vaginal canal massive disruption of
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:27.220]  the production natural production of testosterone and estrogen by the
[01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:30.780]  ovaries and you have the spermicides which are in condoms which are also
[01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:36.100]  made of plastics by the way and the spermicide is non-oxal 9 cause inside
[01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:40.580]  the vaginal canal high levels of toxic endocrine disruptors or estrogen
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:45.580]  testosterone disruptors as well as the male when it soaks into you know the
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:51.300]  genitalia and then non-oxal 9 turns into endocrine disrupting and hormonal
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:55.820]  disrupting compounds in the water you know all these birth control pills see
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:59.380]  our tap water is contaminated with all this stuff because all the birth control
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:02.500]  pills when the women go to the bathroom ends up in our water supply and that is
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:06.500]  just annihilating that the aquatic life that's right so it's annihilating
[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:10.940]  aquatic life I mean there's polar even as far as the Antarctic up there you
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:13.740]  they're seeing signs you think well they don't eat all this processed food they
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:17.380]  don't have all this up there but the water is so contaminated up there that
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:22.420]  polar bears actually female polar bears are growing penises I saw that in fact
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:25.780]  guys did you find this hand sanitizer article to show folks that's causing
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:30.420]  okay show the female polar bears and again again you're homophobic because
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:34.340]  you don't want the female polar bears to grow genitalia male genitalia because
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:38.980]  that's how well what do you want to say to to to the so-called progressive media
[01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:42.260]  that's going to attack this well they just don't know what they're talking
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:46.420]  about no science is now homophobic well of course it's homophobic but the truth
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:49.300]  is I mean you know they don't want the truth out there they because it's a
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:52.100]  money thing okay let's say they have to figure out what to do with all the
[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:56.380]  byproducts of petroleum and everything so they make money by making people sick
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:44:59.580]  by putting all these plasticizers and everything and these petroleum based
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:05.180]  products in all your stuff to to work through this eugenics program to where
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:07.900]  you're not going to be able to have kids you're going to have low testosterone
[01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:10.740]  levels you're going to feel depressed your hair is going to start falling out
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:13.740]  you're not going to have fat around your stomach you're not going to feel sexy
[01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:17.220]  you're not going to want to have sex anymore the list goes on and on and
[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:19.740]  then what they're going to do is they're going to sell you Viagra because
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:25.020]  you're impotent they're going to sell you testosterone they create the disease
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:29.260]  with andro pause andro pause was never around when we were growing up andro
[01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:32.900]  pause like menopause I mean it's low testosterone in males so they have
[01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:36.580]  every single angle figured out so they can come around and make money and sell
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:41.100]  you prescription medications puts you on testosterone and Viagra in Viagra
[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:46.500]  itself Viagra contains phthalates which are testosterone disruptors so they
[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:50.580]  give you Viagra and it disrupts and blocks your testosterone production they
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:53.980]  found the articles about the polar bears genitals are shrinking well I mean
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:59.820]  what's wrong with that we need gay polar bears well we have a situation where
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:03.580]  we're just dealing with more you know the no but I'm saying if you don't like
[01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:07.260]  Obama carrier racist and if you point out that the Pentagon and the globalist
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:10.980]  are on record adding all this to the food and water to reduce fertility to
[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:15.580]  screw up society their waging war on men and women in natural human
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:20.380]  relationships and literally now saying the mere act of being heterosexual is
[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:24.940]  hateful and must be eradicated and that's the culture level so it's
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:28.780]  accepted by the new culture but it's being pushed by those on top who are
[01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:32.740]  actually hyper male hyper female to destroy their competition this is an
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:38.220]  exterminist ultra hitlerian program and it's here now we talk about how we
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:44.140]  counter this and respond to it because you have developed with us super male
[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:48.300]  vitality and we just it had been sold out we just got more of this in and
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:52.620]  compared to its leading competitor that isn't even as good a product it is about
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:56.980]  40% off and this also helps fund the operation and because I want to get into
[01:46:56.980 --> 01:47:03.380]  talking about super male vitality in the two ounce bottle Shane Steiner's been on
[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:07.600]  this a week and he said he's never felt anything like it women take this go
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:10.180]  work about with a female vitality but quite frankly it's pretty much the same
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:14.420]  thing so this is explain what this proprietary formulation you put together
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:17.460]  and I looked up all the ingredients they're all organic looked up what they
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:23.100]  do separately from your own research and it's all just the stuff known condensed
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:26.700]  supercharged quite frankly I don't even take the regular dose of this because I
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:32.640]  can't I get my brains wired extremely male so I don't need that much of it but
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.620]  I do like it helps me work out more but tell folks about this well super male
[01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:41.980]  vitality was developed because of this situation that we're talking about now
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:46.940]  I mean every single person needs to help regulate their hormones I don't want
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:50.820]  people running out to the doctor's office and getting on all these testosterone
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:55.580]  patches all this hormone replacement therapy which all of it is mixed in you
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:59.360]  know the stuff that's mixed in with it is toxic fillers and binders that actually
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:04.380]  keep your testosterone and keep your estrogen levels out of whack anyway so
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:07.860]  you know here you are running and getting all this stuff and it's never
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:10.580]  fixing the problem I'm always about addressing the root cause of the
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:14.220]  situation and doing it naturally I believe everybody has a self-healing
[01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:18.980]  mechanism within their body my job is to teach you how to avoid these things and
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:23.540]  how to reactivate your body's own self-healing mechanism so you listen
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:28.340]  listen if you like your female brain and you like not being male then don't take
[01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:32.300]  this and and but how does it end up helping women as well just the women
[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:35.860]  that really go crazy on this right I don't want to tell folks that it has an
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:39.500]  aphrodisiac effect well well what it does is it stimulates the body's own
[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:45.060]  production of testosterone growth hormone DHEA all the hormone precursors
[01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:49.260]  and it does it by using high quality therapeutic doses of herbs and it
[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:54.900]  doesn't shut anything down it doesn't it doesn't it's not doesn't have testosterone
[01:48:54.900 --> 01:49:00.180]  in it you know because let's say if you give a woman or estrogen or you give a
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:05.260]  woman testosterone well if you're externally giving them that then their
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:08.820]  own body's production over a period of time can shut down because it's in the
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:12.500]  blood so the body says well I don't need to produce it because it's already
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:16.220]  coming in the blood and I can sense it in the blood so what this is designed to
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:21.100]  do is to balance out your hormones naturally and let your body start
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:25.900]  slowly producing the levels that you need Steiner said in just a week he can
[01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:29.140]  focus better and he was kind of bummed out you know with the winter blues he
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:32.300]  said it's made him happier what's difference between his brain because you
[01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:36.740]  know those guys are like all world champion you know like his brother
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:40.740]  steer wrestlers and bull riders and stuff so they're already super male but
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:43.500]  it's making him happy and what's the difference between him being happy and
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:49.180]  me getting even more aggressive on it well you know there have been shuddies
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:53.820]  that the studies that shown that low testosterone can cause aggressiveness so
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:57.820]  basically what I would say is maybe you need to take it or have your testosterone
[01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:01.940]  tested because maybe you don't have enough to even though you know there's a
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:05.580]  lot of controversy as whether testosterone you know high testosterone
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:09.780]  levels really make you aggressive I mean they my hair is falling out and I've
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:14.460]  got hair on my back right so I don't know I don't have any I don't have any
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:18.660]  problems either I would have to look at your testosterone levels but just another
[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:22.180]  thing that we didn't talk about real fast and this just bothers me and for
[01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:25.500]  parents out there that have kids that are drinking all the Coca-Cola stuff high
[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:30.220]  fructose corn syrup by the way which is in everything there's high levels of
[01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:33.180]  atrazine usually in that because the pesticides that spray the corn they
[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:36.540]  admit it's full of pesticide high fructose corn syrup will block your
[01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:42.020]  kids and your own production and regulation of hormones and women out
[01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:45.860]  there that are using bleach tampons get off of those because the tampons are
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:52.220]  genetically modified cotton and those are also designed to alter your hormone
[01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:56.500]  levels when you wear tampons amazing it's all social engineering hidden

[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:31.900]  is supposed to produce 10% of its protein content as glutathione but due to
[01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:35.900]  toxicity and aging it does not could glutathione be a missing factor in

[01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:23.020]  it's just incredible but Dr. Grubb getting into the other points about what
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:27.980]  they're bombarding us with and why the supermail vitality formulation dietary
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:32.180]  supplement that you developed for us is so special for folks and their purchases
[01:54:32.180 --> 01:54:36.420]  of it also helped fund the broadcast everything that we do but but break down
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:39.700]  what's in it and what it does and they get into your other scientific facts for
[01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:44.700]  people well well you know the main the main purpose of it I didn't even know
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:47.700]  it was gonna work so good for women really I was doing it because of the
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:52.660]  testosterone but then I realized that women need testosterone too what I did
[01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:56.580]  was I just chose the rare herbs that had been scientifically proven to naturally
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:55:02.260]  boost your testosterone like tribulus terrestris maca ashwagandha and a few
[01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:06.180]  other things and put it together in a concentrated formula using a high
[01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:11.740]  technology high energy sound pulse extraction techniques because most of
[01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:15.620]  the time when you go get tinctures or herbal formulas from the store they're
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:20.620]  in alcohol okay well alcohol is an endocrine disruptor you know why do you
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:23.420]  want to take herbs in alcohol no one's reinvented the wheel that's why we
[01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:27.180]  started doing stuff in organic vegetable glycerin or USP you know kosher
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:31.580]  certified vegetable glycerin and we developed a technique where with alcohol
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:35.900]  extractions you're only able to get about 40% of the plant's material you
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:40.180]  know and that leaves out essential oils that leaves out like real powerful
[01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:43.300]  oleo resins and other components of the plant and you were saying then it
[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:47.140]  meshes with the glycerin and the alcohol actually kills those key ring
[01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:51.060]  structures they're needed for absorption absolutely and that's why I think more
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:54.340]  people are gonna start going to or towards glycerin based compounds that's
[01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:58.380]  why we have a two-year waiting list for people for us to do extractions for
[01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:04.140]  them because we pioneered this technology on how to actually extract in a cold
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:08.020]  process and in all glass and pull all these components out into the mixture
[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:12.740]  and do it in a real good therapeutic method that's actually gonna make a
[01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:16.340]  difference I mean you could get an alcohol formula with these same herbs in
[01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:19.260]  there and it's not gonna be as impotent and it's probably not gonna work as
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:23.460]  good and why would you even get an alcohol you know tincture for you know
[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:28.060]  testosterone when actually that reduces testosterone to begin with so that's
[01:56:28.060 --> 01:56:32.220]  that's what I want to do because when we start when I started unraveling this
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:36.980]  whole eugenics and population control system starting with pregnant mothers
[01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:39.820]  and starting with these generations and you know what we didn't even talk about
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:44.140]  genetically modified organisms GMOs I mean they've proven that for four
[01:56:44.140 --> 01:56:48.820]  generations after rats have been fed GMOs that they're sterile I mean they're
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:52.660]  completely sterile after four generations so this what we're going
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:56.020]  through now is not something that we need to deal with now but it's something
[01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:59.620]  that's gonna affect the future generation it's gonna get worse and worse and
[01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:03.980]  worse and worse people think we're unhealthy now just get ready does
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:08.340]  filtering your water taking the proper iodine supplements getting exercise and
[01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:12.820]  taking supermail vitality I mean will that protect you from a lot of this or
[01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:17.660]  how else do you mitigate this well the main thing is you want to avoid the
[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:21.500]  things that are going to cause estrogen dominance like soar you want to avoid
[01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:24.980]  any of the plastics you want to avoid the pesticides throw away your roundup
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:30.300]  everything wash your fruits and vegetables you want to avoid any chemicals
[01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:35.540]  and heavy metals I mean it's very easy you can take any chemical off of a label
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:39.500]  and just type it in in Google and put this chemical endocrine disruptor and
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:43.300]  you'll see if that's an endocrine disruptor if it is don't do it this is
[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:48.100]  all part of the soft kill agenda folks go to infowarslife.com if you want to

[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:50.100]  This is GCN the Genesis communications radio network.
[01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:54.960]  The facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:58.780]  members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive
[01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:03.660]  ability of the American people so why are the social engineers adding it to the
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:07.740]  water? Simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:11.900]  technocracy is feeding on. We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the
[01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:16.220]  water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies. I am extremely
[01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:20.780]  excited to announce the exclusive infowars life fluoride shield formulation

[02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:21.260]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas. Alex
[02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:26.100]  Jones. So we've really in the last 45 minutes broken down a lot of
[02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:30.260]  informational stuff you can do every day to protect you and your family from the
[02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:34.060]  exposure of these endocrine disruptors and these estrogen members that the
[02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:38.060]  globalist on record have been putting in the food chain for 67 years and now
[02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:42.860]  we're just totally bombarded with it by design as a depopulation program and
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:46.740]  it's in the GMO it's in the fluoride it's in all of it but so much of it is
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:52.380]  your body if it doesn't have the good hormones will then absorb all the
[02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:55.900]  fake ones so it's just like you take nason iodine to block the thyroid from
[02:00:55.900 --> 02:01:00.740]  getting the radioactive isotopes in layman's terms dr. groups finishing up
[02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:05.940]  some of the key points you've got what does this do super male vitality to help
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:08.980]  folks because it certainly works only promote what works we've heard the
[02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:12.580]  rave reviews this is amazing stuff and then your other points well the
[02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:15.460]  endocrine glands talking about what you're talking about is first of all
[02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:20.140]  hormones regulate practically every reaction in the body and your endocrine
[02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:24.740]  glands produce hormones and that's your thyroid gland your pituitary gland your
[02:01:24.740 --> 02:01:30.340]  hypothalamus your adrenal glands all that has to work in conjunction with
[02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:33.420]  each other to make sure that you have the proper amounts of testosterone the
[02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:37.060]  proper amounts of estrogen the precursors for testosterone so the
[02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:41.980]  super male vitality was designed to work for men and women to help regulate all
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:46.740]  of those glands so they start working together for example take fluoride you
[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:50.660]  know fluoride knocks out the thyroid gland your thyroid regulates your
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:55.420]  metabolism you know fluoride also calcifies the pineal gland you know
[02:01:55.420 --> 02:02:00.820]  the pineal gland is another gland that regulates hormones so if your hormone
[02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:06.140]  if your complete hormone system and your body is thrown off then you're gonna
[02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:09.620]  have all kinds of symptoms and you're gonna be setting yourself up your
[02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:12.380]  immune systems gonna be depressed you're gonna have all these symptoms and
[02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:14.980]  then you're gonna go to the doctor's office say I have all these symptoms your
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:18.540]  doctor's not gonna say oh well it's all these hormone disruptors and all these
[02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:21.580]  chemicals they're gonna say oh no let's put you on statins and your high
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:25.100]  cholesterol listen I have the news articles where you know three four-year-olds
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:28.500]  in England the US are going into puberty girls and boys yes and when they
[02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:31.420]  bring a little girl and they don't say get them off all this GMO get them off
[02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:34.380]  the process stuff get them off the microwave things the doctors aren't even
[02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:38.820]  taught that they give them hormones to then suppress that and then the
[02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:41.740]  children end up getting all these other diseases where their glands never
[02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:47.500]  develop what's that disease where your glands just shut down I forget the name
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:51.180]  of the point is that's what it's giving them I mean it's incredible yeah the
[02:02:51.180 --> 02:02:54.780]  doctor doesn't go why is a four-year-old having a period they just go here here's
[02:02:54.780 --> 02:02:58.140]  hormones to stop that right well obviously it's hormones doing it that I
[02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:02.820]  mean the fish the the birds they're going into puberty early it's a really
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:06.540]  really big issue and that's why that's why I should this is the biggest issue
[02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:10.260]  it's a giant conspiracy I mean and they're even doing artificial sperm now
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:13.980]  over in Europe because they think that in the next 10 to 15 years look at all
[02:03:13.980 --> 02:03:17.340]  the instrument look at nobody can get pregnant anymore I mean there's so many
[02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:21.580]  miscarriages because of the chemicals there's you know these fertility
[02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:25.740]  clinics popping up everywhere you know there might be in the future the point
[02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:29.900]  where you have to have artificial sperm and you know they might it's gonna go
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:33.980]  all go no no no the globalists admit that's the plan they said this Huxley
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:37.860]  before he dies at the plan is wreck everybody where they can have children
[02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:41.140]  then they're going to come in and have designer babies where they can build in
[02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:45.140]  what they want you know they put Trojan horses in the Ford truck to track you
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:48.780]  they put Trojan horses in the cell phone these are Trojan horses in these
[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:53.820]  babies already being created with three parents it's epigenetics and it's going
[02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:58.020]  on right now I mean they're doing it in a secret way just by utilizing all these
[02:03:58.020 --> 02:04:02.420]  chemicals to change our codes when we eat genetically modified foods that messes
[02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:06.860]  with our let's call the special on the news tonight I may even do the interview
[02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:10.420]  this is too important I wish I've got a great guest coming up on the Obama

[02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:29.940]  with this because this is the big issue it's a secret chemical biological
[02:04:29.940 --> 02:04:33.820]  warfare program altering humans it's brave new world we need to come out with
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:37.740]  a list and say okay these are the top 20 things that you need to avoid and this
[02:04:37.740 --> 02:04:42.380]  is what you need to do to reverse this but but first exactly let them know
[02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:45.980]  there's a program to do that exactly they have to know this is real folks I
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:50.780]  mean the globalist are social engineers to the max they're already on TV saying

[02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:03.460]  is a real deal why does the United States spend the largest percentage of
[02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:07.940]  GDP in the world on health care why do we have the highest cancer rates on the
[02:05:07.940 --> 02:05:14.140]  planet the highest rates of diabetes autism and every other major disease it
[02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:19.580]  all comes down to one thing we are what we eat our food is devoid of nutrition

[02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:35.300]  standardization away from checks and balances and liberty and towards a
[02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:41.620]  global autocratic neo feudalistic state and almost all historians a political
[02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:47.420]  scientist constitutional lawyers agree they just had the head of a large
[02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:50.780]  international bank we covered this a few days ago go public and said we're
[02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:55.180]  collapsing into authoritarianism in the West and the rest of the world's
[02:08:55.180 --> 02:08:59.540]  already been under it forever it's only the Renaissance and things the last
[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:03.860]  500 years that has given any semblance to the idea of freedom it's not that our
[02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:07.020]  Declaration of Independence Constitution Bill of Rights gives us rights it
[02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:12.500]  states eloquently the rights of organic freedom that is already there for all
[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:19.460]  humans and so it never delivered the utopia but it came further than any
[02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:24.140]  other system and is the best model out there in my humble view. Senator Ted
[02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:27.300]  Cruz has come out and called the president dangerous and terrifying and
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:32.660]  the media is like oh my gosh that's so mean that type of rhetoric well it is
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:38.100]  what it is there is total autocratic authoritarian rule by executive order the
[02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:42.140]  likes of which we've never seen and if there isn't a pushback and a reversal it
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:47.620]  will set the precedent on guns on borders on the IRS persecuting political
[02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:52.820]  enemies the FBI has come out and said that their primary mission here's the
[02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:57.860]  article from last week the FBI is a national security agency drops law
[02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:02.740]  enforcement is top priority from its mission and that is a political commissar
[02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:06.660]  position targeting the Tea Party gun owners libertarians saying it's not
[02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:13.540]  al-Qaeda now in their national security mission it's gun owners this is a
[02:10:13.540 --> 02:10:18.740]  criminal foreign corporate takeover that's anti-free market it's crony
[02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:22.580]  capitalism using socialism to domesticate the population and if that
[02:10:22.580 --> 02:10:28.260]  idea is not understood and adopted by the opposition to the tyranny and if we
[02:10:28.260 --> 02:10:32.060]  don't get that message out we'll never win the mainline right wing says all
[02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:35.780]  corporations are great get rid of the borders blah blah blah corporate
[02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:40.020]  welfare is wonderful the left says government's wonderful Stalin we love
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:44.060]  you parents are bad and then we see that as the opposition when the truth is the
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:48.460]  Republicans like the governor in New Jersey are placeholders to make it look
[02:10:48.460 --> 02:10:51.380]  like there's opposition to this authoritarian takeover and then they
[02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:55.740]  take the moral high ground that they are the authorities that they are the
[02:10:55.740 --> 02:10:59.940]  progressives they are the ones that care they are the civil rights activists
[02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:05.420]  when they teach your five-year-old how to you know have sex no these are power
[02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:11.420]  grabbing megalomaniacal control freaks who are not successful in culture with
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:16.220]  their ideas their writings their their music their art their their courage their
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:21.860]  trailblazing their innovation they innovate in gang fraud they innovate in
[02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:30.260]  kleptocratic king rat societies of groups they are the plague they are the
[02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:36.300]  cancer they are the anathema threat to all that is good I mean there's no way
[02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:40.420]  to describe it and you and what Ted Cruz has said is you are evil you are
[02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:44.580]  dangerous you are tyrant you like man that's really radical yeah it's radical
[02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:49.980]  and it's true him saying it isn't what did it it's already there it's already
[02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:55.620]  going on it's already happening you just have to admit it and then decide if you
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:12:00.220]  want to live in a progressively worse progressively more authoritarian
[02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:03.500]  progressively oppressive system you're like well I haven't done anything wrong
[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:07.820]  that's not how tyranny's work they come after you has a gazelle done anything
[02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:13.500]  wrong when a lion grabs it needs it did those kids that Jeffrey Dahmer grabbed
[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:17.980]  and tortured they do they wrong did the people killed and not by the Nazi
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:21.900]  Germans did anything wrong no most of them did anything did the tens of
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:27.580]  millions killed by the Russians under communism did anything wrong no it's
[02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:32.740]  like in Goldfinger he says you expect me to talk James Bond does he goes no Mr.
[02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:40.100]  Bond I expect you to die you're being culturally overwritten the family's

[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:33.820]  a law professor constitutional lawyer how would she define it and then how what
[02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:39.580]  are the remedies when we are faced with a true tyrannous thank you so much for
[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:44.540]  coming on professor oh thanks Alex I appreciate you having me today well what
[02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:48.660]  are we facing as a culture as a society what do we do go over the laundry list
[02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:53.020]  and then how we counter this yeah I you know I mean this this president seems
[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:58.340]  sort of hell bent on violating the Constitution I will say this you know we
[02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:03.060]  all learn sort of in grade school right the basic idea of separation of powers
[02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:07.860]  that we have a legislative branch that makes the laws and then we learn that
[02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:11.940]  the president is the has a duty under the Constitution and article 2 to
[02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:17.460]  faithfully execute those laws and I think he missed that that week in school
[02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:22.860]  because you know he's been doing a lot of things that other presidents simply
[02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:29.020]  have not had the boldness to do or the audacity to do so let's let's take some
[02:14:29.020 --> 02:14:33.260]  of the big ones his big signature legislative achievement Obamacare right
[02:14:33.260 --> 02:14:39.900]  there's at least five major things that the president has done to affect
[02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:45.260]  essentially a unilateral amendment of those laws he's not faithfully executing
[02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:50.060]  Obamacare as written he's changing it with sort of the the swipe of a
[02:14:50.060 --> 02:14:56.420]  magisterial pen so you know one thing he did he delayed these out-of-pocket caps
[02:14:56.420 --> 02:15:00.860]  that are written into the law I says well I'm gonna put that off for a year
[02:15:00.860 --> 02:15:05.260]  because that's too hard for the employers and the insurers to figure out then
[02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:09.420]  he takes the employer mandate a big giant component of Obamacare that
[02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:13.540]  requires employers you know provide insurance or face these giant tax
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:19.020]  penalties with the stroke of a pen he delays that for a year then he's got
[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:24.060]  this this recent thing about a month ago where he decides you know he told
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:27.420]  everybody if you like your insurance you can keep it all turns out that that's
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:31.500]  not true in about six million Americans are losing their coverage so when the
[02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:35.100]  political heat got turned up on that one he said well you know what I'll do I'll
[02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:39.540]  just say that a lot of people whose health insurance gets canceled don't have
[02:15:39.540 --> 02:15:43.860]  to buy health insurance they don't have to abide by the individual mandate I'm
[02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:49.140]  gonna I'm gonna give them a hardship exception so he changed that and then
[02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:52.460]  he's got this thing that the law is crystal clear for example that the
[02:15:52.460 --> 02:15:57.420]  only employers who have to pay the tax penalty and the only people who are
[02:15:57.420 --> 02:16:00.780]  entitled to the tax credit are people who buy their health insurance through
[02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:04.940]  state exchanges and that was purposeful by Congress they did that because they
[02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:09.500]  wanted to you know incentivize states to run their own exchanges rather than
[02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:13.140]  relying on some monolithic horrible health care dot gov which we ended up
[02:16:13.140 --> 02:16:17.460]  with and he said well you know I'm gonna change that unilaterally to by
[02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:21.140]  regulation I'm gonna say you're gonna all of the requirements of law are gonna
[02:16:21.140 --> 02:16:23.620]  apply whether you buy your health insurance through the state of changes
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:27.380]  or our horrible federal exchange and so what is that when he shuts down the
[02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:31.580]  power plants without congressional approval and he sends in military without
[02:16:31.580 --> 02:16:34.420]  congressional approval and puts them under NATO command and on and on I mean
[02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:38.900]  is that not the office becoming dictatorial and isn't Ted Cruz right
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:42.820]  calling it dangerous and terrifying yeah I think Ted Cruz is a hundred percent
[02:16:42.820 --> 02:16:47.220]  right I mean this is if it's not dictatorial it's darn close to it is the
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:51.100]  closest I think we've ever seen in this country maybe sure and it stops
[02:16:51.100 --> 02:16:54.780]  the political will to take the wind out of ourselves to repeal the whole
[02:16:54.780 --> 02:16:59.940]  stinking thing by him selectively backing off so that we don't get upset and
[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:04.380]  get the will I mean this is a very crafty whispering in the ear way of
[02:17:04.380 --> 02:17:08.700]  strangling this country yeah I mean it's his way of saying you know especially
[02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:13.780]  to the Democrats who are gonna be facing tough elections in a couple of years you
[02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:16.980]  know I'm gonna give you I'm gonna throw you a bone I'm gonna unilaterally change
[02:17:16.980 --> 02:17:21.020]  this law I know I'm not enforcing it as written like I'm constitutionally
[02:17:21.020 --> 02:17:23.860]  supposed to do but I want to try to help you in your elections by sort of
[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:27.260]  alleviating the harshness of the law president doesn't have the power
[02:17:27.260 --> 02:17:30.940]  constitutionally to do this I mean frankly this is an impeachable offense
[02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:35.300]  but nobody has you know the courage to say that well Julius Caesar acted like a
[02:17:35.300 --> 02:17:38.620]  dictator for a while before he officially came one and again I believe
[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:42.340]  the establishment wants dictatorial centralized power they want that all over
[02:17:42.340 --> 02:17:46.140]  the world it's easier to buy off one group than you know whole Congress and
[02:17:46.140 --> 02:17:49.660]  the states and the rest of it but so I'm not saying Obama is going to be a
[02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:54.220]  dictator I'm saying he is setting the precedent for future presidents to
[02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:58.860]  really actually become a physical dictator and a dictatorship of the
[02:17:58.860 --> 02:18:02.580]  bureaucracy do you agree with that statement professor absolutely I mean I
[02:18:02.580 --> 02:18:06.340]  think that the problem here is for example the Democrats like what the
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:10.620]  president is doing it is in accord with their policy preferences and their own
[02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:14.900]  political hides and so not only do they like what he's doing and they aren't
[02:18:14.900 --> 02:18:17.820]  complaining about it so we'll never get any you know the Senate for example to
[02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:20.780]  ever impeach him or even seriously consider it but they're actually
[02:18:20.780 --> 02:18:24.100]  encouraging the president to do more of it I mean there was a recent group of
[02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:28.780]  Democratic members of Congress who wrote a letter to the president asking him in
[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:32.460]  fact to suspend the entirety of immigration law and not deport anyone
[02:18:32.460 --> 02:18:37.420]  well professor that's a new drum beat as you said he set it up where I can't
[02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:40.300]  just act outside the Constitution there's like well I may have to and now
[02:18:40.300 --> 02:18:44.460]  he's like I'm gonna do whatever I need to and they've got pundits on MSNBC and
[02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:49.100]  in every week now saying he needs to just do whatever he wants yeah they're
[02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:53.100]  applauding and what they don't realize that's so short-sighted because you
[02:18:53.100 --> 02:18:56.980]  know frankly I don't want Republican presidents to disregard the Constitution
[02:18:56.980 --> 02:18:59.820]  either so I don't want to set a precedent where a future Republican
[02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:03.020]  president behaves in the same unconstitutional way this is a very
[02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:06.820]  dangerous precedent to be setting we're gonna go to Brighton come back and
[02:19:06.820 --> 02:19:09.660]  we'll talk about solutions but other key points you want to make I mean I've got a
[02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:12.620]  lot of questions to ask you but what are some of the other areas you're gonna
[02:19:12.620 --> 02:19:15.740]  cover when we come back professor yeah I'll talk a little bit about what he's
[02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:19.940]  been doing you know gutting the welfare reform act the no child left behind act
[02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:23.420]  or a controlled substances law there's a whole slew of things we could talk about
[02:19:23.420 --> 02:19:29.380]  so he's literally legislating from the executive by recombining these huge laws
[02:19:29.380 --> 02:19:35.380]  anyway he wants I mean it's it's like having a a set of Legos and the law is
[02:19:35.380 --> 02:19:38.700]  the map of how they're supposed to be put together he throws the directions
[02:19:38.700 --> 02:19:42.900]  away and just builds whatever he wants that's that is a very sophisticated
[02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:47.060]  dictator 2.0 is what it is we'll be right back with our guest on the other side

[02:24:21.580 --> 02:24:26.820]  prisonplanet.com we're gonna get into solutions whether in the next segment
[02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:30.500]  but continuing with the so-called abuse of power it's much worse than that
[02:24:30.500 --> 02:24:35.420]  everything they've been doing is systematic to set the precedent that he
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:40.780]  can serve as a UN Security Council head that violates Article 1 Section 9 that
[02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:44.460]  he can launch military operations and fund Al Qaeda and say that he got the
[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:49.820]  authority from NATO not even from himself that's even worse and on the
[02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:53.820]  treason scale saying a foreign group gave him authority so we've really
[02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:58.820]  entered in some crazy times MSNBC pundit calls an Obama to govern by decree a
[02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:02.300]  few months ago there was a few weeks ago that was testimony in Congress by
[02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:07.140]  constitutional lawyers on the left and the right and they we played the clip
[02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:12.020]  shed there isn't much further to think here and that we were in danger of the
[02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:15.380]  form of government failing and then they talked about only an armed
[02:25:15.380 --> 02:25:19.700]  revolution to counter it I want to talk about you know some of the other
[02:25:19.700 --> 02:25:24.500]  abuses but how do you counter something like this professor well it's very good
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:29.220]  question I mean the first and most obvious one would be impeachment with
[02:25:29.220 --> 02:25:32.900]  a Democrat-controlled Senate and Democrats seeming to like what the
[02:25:32.900 --> 02:25:37.140]  president is doing and blessing it that seems the near impossibility because it
[02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:41.620]  would take two-thirds of the Senate to convict so that's not going to happen if
[02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:45.020]  you take that check and balance off the table really the only other thing we
[02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:50.180]  can do is litigate potentially in court but there are major impediments to
[02:25:50.180 --> 02:25:54.620]  lawsuits going forward against the president to challenge some of these
[02:25:54.620 --> 02:25:59.820]  abuses so what does that leave us you've got Homeland Security gearing up to
[02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:04.580]  crush political opposition this is this is it looks like a premeditated
[02:26:04.580 --> 02:26:09.700]  authoritarian takeover yeah it could be I mean you know one of the big problems
[02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:12.580]  people ask me all the time well why can't we just through the president for
[02:26:12.580 --> 02:26:16.980]  violating the Constitution it sounds so simple but unfortunately the law is the
[02:26:16.980 --> 02:26:20.060]  Supreme Court's developed it over the years has become very complex on this
[02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:25.380]  and one of the big sort of geeky technical things that is demanded now to
[02:26:25.380 --> 02:26:30.060]  bring a lawsuit is this thing called standing and it sounds very obscure but
[02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:33.580]  standing is pretty simple it says that if you're the plaintiff that you're
[02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:38.220]  initiating the lawsuit you have to prove to the court that you've got a very
[02:26:38.220 --> 02:26:43.580]  particular eyes very individual injury that you're suffering so think about
[02:26:43.580 --> 02:26:47.140]  what some of these things that president Obama is doing he's delaying
[02:26:47.140 --> 02:26:54.140]  various portions of Obamacare he is deciding not to deport certain young
[02:26:54.140 --> 02:26:58.500]  people he's giving waivers to the state so they don't have to comply with the
[02:26:58.500 --> 02:27:03.020]  no child left behind law all of these types of actions by the president
[02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:06.300]  remember he styles himself a constitutional law professor himself so
[02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:14.180]  he knows this are what we would call benevolent acts by the president but
[02:27:14.180 --> 02:27:19.140]  but but they create the acts and then come and shields you selectively from
[02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:22.500]  their own operation isn't that the essence of discrimination and
[02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:26.220]  authoritarianism when they bring in oppressive laws and then the dictator
[02:27:26.220 --> 02:27:31.300]  selectively enforces it so you're now under a basic new royalty where if you
[02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:35.260]  have a letter of mark you're allowed to operate but if you're not given the
[02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:40.300]  grace of the license the licensure now your slave that's precisely it you see
[02:27:40.300 --> 02:27:45.660]  so by by taking all of these benevolent acts and sort of waving you know the law
[02:27:45.660 --> 02:27:49.420]  and exempting and granting privileges to certain people that they don't have to
[02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:52.380]  abide by the law at least they don't have to buy five for another year or two
[02:27:52.380 --> 02:27:57.580]  or however many years he decides then he is not injuring anyone in the way that
[02:27:57.580 --> 02:28:03.100]  someone would have standing to sue him so you cannot get the courts to open up
[02:28:03.100 --> 02:28:07.460]  their doors to hear these lawsuits because he's basically acting like the
[02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:13.180]  king of England used to act in granting privileges or exemptions from law so it's
[02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:19.220]  a very it's a very difficult technical legal problem that is is really going
[02:28:19.220 --> 02:28:23.700]  to if the court doesn't find a way to open up their standing rules to allow
[02:28:23.700 --> 02:28:27.260]  some of these lawsuits to go forward then the president could really take
[02:28:27.260 --> 02:28:30.780]  advantage of it not just president Obama but future president as well and
[02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:35.100]  that's really going to threaten the separation of powers well professor
[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:38.540]  even with a corrupt establishment do they really want to get rid of all the
[02:28:38.540 --> 02:28:42.020]  checks and balances in their power grab because historically that will destroy
[02:28:42.020 --> 02:28:45.900]  the very elite that is eroding checks and balances they're creating a
[02:28:45.900 --> 02:28:51.420]  centralized system that's going to cause huge dictatorial governmental turnover
[02:28:51.420 --> 02:28:55.460]  and then the whole mission of the country or the Empire will then be about the
[02:28:55.460 --> 02:29:01.940]  king's court and capturing that instead of actually having commerce yeah well I
[02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:05.300]  mean that is kind of what crony capitalism is all about if you think
[02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:08.780]  about it I mean if you if you get to the point where the president isn't just a
[02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:13.380]  guy who faithfully executes the law the way he's supposed to but in fact he has
[02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:18.180]  sort of near dictatorial power to waive the law when he thinks it's okay or
[02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:21.660]  when you have political connections to him and you can get such a privilege or
[02:29:21.660 --> 02:29:26.820]  waiver and that works in favor of the people who have power and I think that
[02:29:26.820 --> 02:29:30.180]  they see at least right at the moment with their perhaps near-sightedness
[02:29:30.180 --> 02:29:33.900]  that that this could be an advantageous system to them you're right let's talk
[02:29:33.900 --> 02:29:37.500]  about more of the abuses and solutions for the amazing professor Elizabeth

[02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:47.540]  into is 180 degrees the polar opposite of what this country was founded on so
[02:29:47.540 --> 02:29:51.780]  let's just get that straight this is totally un-American we're on the march the

[02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:05.540]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and
[02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:10.820]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around

[02:30:14.900 --> 02:30:19.540]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing

[02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:45.840]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind. Waging war on
[02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:51.080]  corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation. We've got to break out
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:56.160]  of this comfort zone. We've got to break out of the trance. Like Ted Cruz has done
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:00.840]  and said that Obama is dangerous and terrifying on his power grabs. Yes, it is
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:05.000]  dangerous and terrifying. Especially when you know how evil this political class
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:08.880]  has gotten and how decadent and disconnected from reality. And I go look,
[02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:11.800]  Martin Levin said, he said, Obama preparing country for a coup against
[02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:16.360]  Constitution. I don't think he's preparing it. They're doing it. And we get
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:20.360]  too fixated on Obama folks. He's just a frontman for some very corrupt
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:25.840]  Chicago mafia type people. And there's a lot of other corporations and power
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:29.600]  structures that want a power grab. Look at how Holder got away lying to
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:33.960]  Congress on Fast and Furious. Look at, for me, not just the NSA illegal spying
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:38.880]  and getting caught lying bipartisanly, but the targeting mainline Tea Party,
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:43.680]  mainline Christian groups, pro-life groups with criminal IRS probes and
[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:51.000]  harassment and denial of 501C3 and things selectively. I mean, that is the
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:56.640]  very ether of tyranny. That's how Nazi Germany started. I mean, this is amazing.
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:02.080]  And I think the liberal mantle, their fake high ground is the big problem here.
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:06.240]  And I oppose Bush and those power grabs. We're just rotting. It's
[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:11.560]  degenerating. But it has, I've got to say, the most constitutional law scholars
[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:16.200]  I've talked to agree. Obama's probably power grabbed three times more than
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:22.720]  Bush. Huge critics of Bush have been on the show and said that. Huge ones. Chris
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:27.480]  Hedges, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, let's go on and on. And when you realize it only
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:30.120]  gets worse historically from here, let me ask you that professor and they get
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:33.920]  into other points and talk about your books and any solutions in the seven
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:37.480]  or eight minutes we have left. And I appreciate your time. But we're here
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:42.200]  marveling at this tyranny. I mean, how much worse has it been under Obama? And
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:46.560]  if it continues to go, I mean, have you seen any historical examples where it
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:51.720]  reverses itself without some really serious things happening? Well, I think
[02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:56.440]  that with the latter question, it's really hard. You know, once power is taken
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:36:00.480]  by government, it's incredibly hard for the people to get it back sort of some
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:05.480]  sort of, you know, revolutionary type behavior. I mean, that's just what
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:08.920]  history has shown not just in this country, but, you know, throughout history
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:14.080]  of the civilized world. So I think that that is a little depressing around the
[02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:17.720]  margins. The important thing is for Americans to stop it before it spins
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:23.200]  out of control somehow. And I do believe that President Obama has amplified
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:27.200]  the pattern. I mean, it's not as though other presidents haven't taken, you
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:32.880]  know, constitutionally shady actions before certainly President Lincoln when
[02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:38.560]  he suspended habeas corpus back in the Civil War probably acted unconstitutionally.
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:45.800]  You know, FDR with his court packing plan in the 1930s really put pressure on
[02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:49.840]  the Supreme Court to entirely change its interpretation of the Constitution so he
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:54.960]  could get his political way. And that was, you know, marginal behavior at best.
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:37:00.880]  But I do think what President Obama is doing is very calculated in a way that
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:04.760]  I've never seen before. I mean, President Bush, say what you will about him. I
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:09.400]  actually can't identify any constitutional violations by President Bush. A lot
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:13.760]  of people don't like what he did with spending. But, you know, for example,
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:17.920]  approving a part D of Medicare, which is the prescription drug benefit, very
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:22.880]  expensive benefit, big expansion of Medicare. He championed that. But you
[02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:26.280]  know what? That was an exercise of the spending power under Article 1, Section
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:30.200]  8. It was perfectly constitutional. It was approved by Congress as a law. And he
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:34.640]  signed it and executed that law as he should under the Constitution. A lot of
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:38.360]  people don't like what he did with the NSA and began that. But all of that
[02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:44.200]  started with a couple of laws passed by Congress, the Patriot Act and the FISA
[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:48.560]  Act. And so those are, again, are laws that the President was simply executing.
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:52.120]  President Obama is doing something totally different that we've never seen
[02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:56.520]  before. He's taking laws that have been passed by Congress that say thou
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:01.520]  shalt do X, like, you know, implement various provisions of Obamacare. But on
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:07.160]  January 1, 2014, the statute says that specifically. And he says, no, I don't
[02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:13.320]  think so. And so what he's doing is much more bold than he's doing it at a
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:19.360]  much faster pace. And the question is now, legally, how do we fight back?
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:24.040]  Well, there is the court of public opinion. And I think it's essential to
[02:38:24.040 --> 02:38:29.600]  start referring to the executive branch as the rogue government. Obviously,
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:33.800]  Congress has got a 6% approval rating themselves. I mean, I think we have to
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:36.480]  really come to the fact that we have a broken political class that are
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:41.280]  criminals on average. And we need to withdraw consent from the entire system
[02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:45.880]  and basically let it collapse like the Soviet Union. I think that's probably
[02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:51.080]  the most bloodless way to go. Homeland Security intends to just have a tea
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:54.840]  party rebellion that they stir up or stage and then have some type of decisive
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:38:58.880]  victory against domestic groups. It's a nightmare scenario. But that seems to be
[02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:02.000]  what they're preparing for at the Pentagon, which is totally waking up the
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:06.760]  military because they're training to take on patriots. This is just a mess with
[02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:10.520]  a bunch of autocratic communists and socialists with corporate paymasters
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:14.440]  running things. And you have the Marxist instinctive need to attack anything
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:20.000]  decent at the core of the liberal ideology. We are just in a mess. And I
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:25.680]  just wish all these camp followers of collectivism would not use
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:31.040]  Eindrand's Atlas Shrugged as an instruction manual or 1984 as an instruction
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:34.680]  manual. And I hope that when they do put a Republican in as the backlash to this
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:39.360]  that we don't let them turn into a tyrant. I mean, this is just a mess. And I
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:43.520]  think, Professor Foley, it's key to just expose historically what brought us to
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:48.760]  this point. Yeah, I agree with you completely. And I would tell you if
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:54.240]  there's one thing that we can do to stem this tide before things do spin out of
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:40:01.280]  control in an Eindrand or a 1984 scenario is to take back the Senate in
[02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:07.600]  2014, that would be the quickest, most efficient way to handle this. Then if we
[02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:13.360]  needed to impeach, we would possibly get some brethren on the Democrat side to
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:17.600]  help us and get the two thirds. But at a minimum, we might be able to push back
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:22.720]  legislatively and unroll some of these laws. Well, I was talking to somebody who
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:26.800]  actually knew the real character that the Wolf of Wall Street's about, and
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:30.080]  they were telling me how that's nothing. I mean, look at Goldman Sachs and J. P.
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:34.320]  Morgan. Look at J. P. Morgan and these deals with these Bernie Madoff type
[02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:39.080]  scams. And you look at how they act in that movie. That's real. This is a
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:44.280]  crazy, wild, arrogant con artist streak that is infected, not just the good old
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:47.920]  boys, but the whole power structure. And they're now trying to start wars with
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:51.000]  Russia and everything else. I mean, these people are going to destroy us, ladies
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:55.320]  and gentlemen. And they have a rational exuberance. They've taken the
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:00.760]  American people's lethargy as a green light to go crazy. But what about the
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:06.640]  power structure itself, believing their own propaganda, being arrogant about all
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:12.080]  this, laughing about all this, bragging about how all Fords watching
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:15.600]  everything you do with the police, ha, ha, ha, with the black boxes in your
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:18.520]  car. And then you look at the photo and the image of that executive and he
[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:23.120]  just looks like a power craze nut. These people are destroying their own
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:26.960]  futures. They are, they are, they are releasing evil into the world that we
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:32.200]  know is, is incredibly destructive. And they believe because they buy into it,
[02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:37.520]  it gives them power over it. And, and they are, they are energized with
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:41.640]  criminal energy. If you study criminology and they're getting off on the bad
[02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:46.640]  deeds and that is incredibly destructive. We need to have a major reform and we
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:50.640]  need smarter members of the establishment. We need grassroots change. But I
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:55.320]  believe the revolution can also happen within the power structure. Coming to
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:59.000]  their senses and, and realizing that they're going to destroy their own
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:41:59.840]  futures as well.
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:05.000]  Yeah, you know, and we're starting to see some hope here. I mean, there is
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.160]  some optimism. I believe in this country. I believe in the intelligence of the
[02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:12.120]  American people. One of the reasons why I wrote my Tea Party book, for example,
[02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:16.960]  was that even though I first held the view of the mainstream media that they
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:21.240]  were a bunch of cooks, I decided to go to some of their meetings and decide for
[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:24.560]  myself. And what I found out is that they're ordinary Americans who actually
[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:27.800]  care about the Constitution. They want to read about it. They want to learn it. I
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:32.200]  think that's encouraging. They've elected great people like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee,
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:37.400]  Rand Paul. And I think that those young sort of Turks in the Senate are having
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:40.840]  an impact and shaking things up. And I think if the American people kind of
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:45.600]  can stay on top of it, you know, we have a chance. So that's right. I mean, the
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:50.240]  power structure wouldn't be demonizing the real libertarian constitutional Tea
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:54.320]  Party and saying it's the main threat in the Republican Democratic leadership.
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:58.600]  All the different associations, all the different fake business associations,
[02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:03.160]  all the crony groups are absolutely scared to death of a libertarian
[02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:07.920]  constitutional takeover because we have a chance. We have the answers. We have the
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:13.640]  prosperity. Socialism, cronyism, fascism doesn't work. Freedom works. Legalized
[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:16.560]  freedom. God bless you, Professor Foley. Thank you for the time.
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:19.880]  Thanks so much, Alex. I enjoy your show very much. Thank you. Wow. That's a
[02:43:19.880 --> 02:43:24.480]  great lady. Check out her books at Elizabeth Price Foley dot com. And
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:29.680]  that's what this broadcast is, is a platform for great political minds,
[02:43:29.680 --> 02:43:33.960]  constitutional minds to try to educate the public and have a larger
[02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:37.840]  discussion and to be able to have reporters like our great Jakari Jackson
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:41.200]  and others who will go to California and check out the radiation. We got some
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:44.520]  good news and some bad news in a moment. Like they've got whole reports here.
[02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:46.680]  They're going to be put into an article later of the readings they got up and
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:49.680]  down the coast for Northern California up into Oregon. I'm not going to have
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:53.800]  them go south. We're going to skip Seattle because I want to go check out
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:56.760]  the reactors and things down in Southern California. So we're going to go to
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:00.840]  them in a moment. Please don't forget we are listeners supported, not like
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:04.800]  MPR that gets $400, $500 million of your taxpayer money and then begs for
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:08.880]  money every day on their stations. And then Rockefeller funded. We are
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:12.600]  funded by the great products we sell like the pro pure pro one water filters
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:15.600]  that cut out the fluoride, the glyphosates blows away all the competition.
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:22.480]  10% off of promo code water and info or store dot com. You can also go to
[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:25.880]  info or life dot com or info or store dot com. I'll also take you there. But
[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:29.680]  then for his livestock competition directly to the incredible super male
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:33.160]  vitality that women can take as well that absolutely allows your body to
[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:37.280]  release all the hormones that you actually need in this estrogen bombed
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:41.800]  environment. Believe me, just get a bottle. It's about 30 40% off the leading
[02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:45.480]  competitor that has similar stuff in it. This is the real deal and just like the
[02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:49.480]  nascent iodine. The more of that comes in next Wednesday. You can pre order the
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:52.600]  high quality survival shield nascent iodine. It'll ship out to your next
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:55.640]  Wednesday or Thursday. It is sold out right now. So if you want to get your
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:59.720]  orders in to protect your thyroid more, we also have the fluoride shield that
[02:44:59.720 --> 02:45:03.160]  has six compounds, including nascent iodine. We have that in the two ounce
[02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:07.120]  bottle. That is available right now at info wars life dot com. We have the
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:14.280]  southern Mexico high mountain, Chiapas organic volcanic soil grown coffee.
[02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:17.480]  Wake up America. We have it in two different blends. It's my favorite
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:21.520]  coffee. I've run for over 10 years and I was able to get the connection right
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:25.800]  down to the actual co ops, the actual farmers down there in Chiapas. We have
[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:32.840]  that as well at info wars life dot com. You can also info or store dot com to
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:36.880]  find all the libertarian constitutional based apparel. You name it and your
[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:41.680]  purchases is what funds this operation via free association. Now joining us
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:55.200]  from Oregon, joining us from Charleston, Oregon is jacari Jackson and a Don
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:58.880]  Salazar and the rest of our crew and their Skype just dropped. We're gonna
[02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:04.840]  get them back up. Um, they have gotten recordings from central California up
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:09.840]  into Oregon. And the good news is you're supposed to have between 1520 2530
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:16.720]  depending on the area of this of this particular type of, you know, radiation
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:25.640]  reading, where you deal with the micro rads. And we found an area with 1000
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:31.880]  percent higher than it should be. And they've now had local newspaper
[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:36.000]  articles come out and report on our reporting. So our goal is now happening
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:40.080]  where people are becoming more aware of radiation in and around them in their
[02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:45.680]  environment. They've gone into seafood stores, markets. They found a lot of
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:48.920]  different data. We're going to go over in the next segment with you. But the
[02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:54.520]  good news is most of the coastline of California and Oregon only has 50% to
[02:46:54.520 --> 02:46:58.720]  100% increased radiation levels from what it was just a few years ago. And
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:03.080]  that can sound bad, but that's still pretty low. But we are forcing the
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:06.720]  media to cover it, obviously. There are the hot particles coming over and
[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:11.640]  Jacarie joins us. Jacarie Jackson from Charleston, Oregon with a report. They
[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:15.880]  did find double the radiation levels in the redwoods, only a small increase at
[02:47:15.880 --> 02:47:18.840]  the Golden Gate Bridge. And there's Jacarie right there with the boats in
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:22.600]  the background for folks watching at prison planet dot TV. Jacarie, tell us
[02:47:22.600 --> 02:47:27.320]  about your findings. Well, we're here at Fishman's Wharf Wharf in Charleston,
[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:30.760]  Oregon. Now we've been running around this area out here. We went to the
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:37.320]  local. All right, we've had really good sky. But now we're having some issues
[02:47:37.320 --> 02:47:43.000]  with the technology. But we'll work on that and see if we can get Jacarie
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:49.120]  back. Jacarie, go ahead and start again. Yeah, we've lost their audio. So what
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:53.560]  we're going to do is we're going to work on those technicals and then come
[02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:57.560]  back to those guys. Again, great technology with Skype. But we do run
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:01.560]  into some hiccups. They've been filing reports on the Info Wars nightly news
[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:04.440]  seven o'clock every night. They're condensed reports out there on the
[02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:08.040]  West Coast and then those later than rotate over to the YouTube channel so
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:11.560]  the general public could see everything. Our goal of the subscription site is to
[02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:14.680]  be able to have the platform, have our own platform. They can't censor and then
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:23.240]  launch info information warfare attacks out against the establishment from
[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:28.280]  there. So that is our goal. That's why it's so essential that everyone be
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:31.560]  Prison Planet dot TV members. All right, let's try that again. Jacarie, thank you
[02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:34.760]  again for the great job you and the crew are doing. Start back over.
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:38.120]  Okay, Alex, we're here at Fishman's Wharf. This is Charleston, Oregon. We've been
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:41.000]  going around to some of the local beaches, also going to some of the local
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:44.840]  fish markets. We encountered a gentleman at a beach not too far from here and he
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:48.840]  told us about a melting starfish. This is something he said he personally
[02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:52.200]  witnessed on the beach a little bit ago a few weeks ago. He was out here and he
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:55.880]  saw this for himself. Now he said he walks these beaches every single day and he
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:58.600]  didn't see these recently, but this is something that he said. So we've been
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:01.880]  walking around asking the locals here if they've seen anything like this. We've
[02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:05.720]  asked some of the fishermen and the dock behind us. They said they were not aware
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:10.040]  of these particular findings. Well, USA Today is and that's a USA Today
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:13.320]  situation. They're dying all over the place. The majority of them are.
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:17.240]  They're having bifurcated, simies, twin whales, never before seen. There's
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:21.640]  undoubtedly major studies out on huge die-off in that area of the Pacific.
[02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:26.360]  A lot of scientists like Dr. Buzz, we do believe it's bioaccumulation
[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:29.800]  of the radiation, Jakari. Yeah, that's exactly right, Alex.
[02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:33.480]  Because you see these high concentrations between Monterey and other
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:36.200]  areas of California where the fish are dying off and
[02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:41.480]  droves. Not just what you'd consider just normal fish, but also jellyfish.
[02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:45.000]  All kinds of sea life is dying out here. And like you said, they can join
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:48.520]  whales. Also Paul Joseph Watson has reported on the bald eagles as far as
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:51.560]  Utah getting brain tumors and other things like that.
[02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:54.600]  Now, Jakari, we're going to come back and talk about some radiation numbers.
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:49:57.880]  You found about double what it should be in the redwoods.
[02:49:57.880 --> 02:50:02.840]  You guys found a thousand percent higher there outside San Francisco.
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:07.880]  That's been good. At the beach. What else have you found?
[02:50:07.880 --> 02:50:11.080]  Well, been traveling up and down the coast. The highest numbers were definitely
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:15.640]  at surface beach where the viral youth. But going up and down, we found maybe
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:18.920]  around double or so. We have spoken a hundred since we left
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:23.560]  surface beach southwest of San Francisco. Wow. When we come back, I want to go over
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:27.320]  some of these numbers. Now we're going to send you guys back south.
[02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:30.040]  Tell us before we go to break where you're going to be next.
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:33.560]  Well, we're going to go to Portland. Do some things up there. Then we'll head back
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:37.080]  south. We're going to L.A. We're going to go to San Diego.
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:40.120]  Some of the power plants around those locations. And also just cruise the
[02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:43.080]  coast like we've been doing since we began this mission.
[02:50:43.080 --> 02:50:45.880]  All right. Well, we found increased radiation levels basically everywhere,
[02:50:45.880 --> 02:50:49.640]  but they're only slightly increased. So it's good news and bad news, but we're
[02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:54.360]  continuing to monitor the situation. We'll come back from Oregon there in
[02:50:54.360 --> 02:50:59.240]  Charleston, Oregon with the Info Wars crew reporting as the radiation waves
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:03.160]  come in from next from Japan. Do you know how much the dollar has lost
[02:51:03.160 --> 02:51:06.440]  in its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[02:51:06.440 --> 02:51:10.360]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings,
[02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:13.640]  your retirement plans? Remember inflation in Zimbabwe,
[02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:17.960]  Argentina, the Weimar Republic? Put another way, who cares if your investments
[02:51:17.960 --> 02:51:21.880]  go up 10%, but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[02:51:21.880 --> 02:51:25.640]  Gold is the only monetary asset is no one else's liability.
[02:51:25.640 --> 02:51:29.720]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did. Gold does not require
[02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:32.760]  trust in a third party. You can possess it in your hand.
[02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:36.680]  You can take it with you. Gold is real money. Gold is honest money.
[02:51:36.680 --> 02:51:39.960]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources to find out how you can
[02:51:39.960 --> 02:51:44.520]  protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious metals accounts.

[02:51:53.320 --> 02:52:00.600]  extension 134 800-686-2237 extension 134.
[02:52:00.600 --> 02:52:04.280]  It's been said those who control the food control the people.
[02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:08.200]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:52:08.200 --> 02:52:11.720]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina,
[02:52:11.720 --> 02:52:15.880]  weight gain, and the inability to think clearly. Genetically modified crops,
[02:52:15.880 --> 02:52:19.640]  processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are
[02:52:19.640 --> 02:52:24.600]  silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:29.240]  Take back control of your health with pro-EM1 probiotic from Tereganics.

[02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:06.360]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen,
[02:53:06.360 --> 02:53:10.840]  bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:53:10.840 --> 02:53:13.720]  Guess what else is in the halogen family? Fluoride.
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:18.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here. In 1924, the federal government did the
[02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:22.200]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:53:22.200 --> 02:53:28.200]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record, reports documented,
[02:53:28.200 --> 02:53:33.400]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:38.680]  Bottom line, iodine is important. Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base,
[02:53:38.680 --> 02:53:42.120]  nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:53:42.120 --> 02:53:47.560]  You'll find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:52.520]  Infowars Life Survival Shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[02:53:52.520 --> 02:54:03.640]  I take it every day. That's InfowarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:22.280]  All right, it's the final segment. We'll have more on the Infowars Nightly News and High Death
[02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:28.680]  as the crew posts their reports from the road and they're out there at the Fisherman's War.
[02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:31.960]  If they've been talking to fishermen that have seen glowing jellyfish, they've never seen
[02:54:31.960 --> 02:54:35.720]  other things if they don't want to go on camera. A man just walked up there, a fisherman's wharf,
[02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:39.720]  but I guess as a listener and has been watching and came out there, he's a fisherman. We'll
[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:45.640]  see if we got a good audio connection out there to Oregon with Jakari Jackson. Jakari?
[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:50.760]  Yes, Alex. We're out here in length. So we just encountered a fan of viewer. He's also a local
[02:54:50.760 --> 02:54:54.200]  fisherman. He says he's been traveling these waters and also has some concerns of his own.
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:58.760]  Well, let's talk to him if he'll talk to us. Come on in, sir. Your name is Tyler, sir?
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:03.560]  Yeah. Okay, come on in, Tyler. Okay, so Tyler, how long have you been fishing?
[02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:07.160]  About 12 years. 12 years. And what do you fish for? What do you fish?
[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:16.600]  We fish here mostly Central Oregon for Dungeons Crab and Albuquod tuna is the bread and butter.
[02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:20.840]  Okay. And you know about the radiation and so forth? Do you have any concerns about that?
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:27.640]  Absolutely concerns, especially with the Albuquod tuna. What's going on with the tuna?
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:36.840]  Well, they're migratory species and we get a lot of questions on our website, oceanharvest.com,
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:42.520]  about people just being concerned and we don't really have any good answers for them. So I really
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:48.680]  appreciate what you guys are doing here because I don't trust the other sources that are saying
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:53.160]  everything's okay. That's right. We definitely appreciate you. Go ahead, Alex. Well, just asking
[02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:59.240]  me if he's seen anything abnormal like USA. They reported the massive starfish die-offs or has
[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:04.360]  he heard about the whale that washed up there on the coast nearby that was a Siamese and never
[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:09.960]  before seen? Have you found any anomalies that you hear about the starfish or also the Siamese
[02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:14.920]  gray whales? Yeah, I've heard about that. Have you personally witnessed? No, I haven't witnessed
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:20.120]  anything. Anything different? Any kind of anomalies, just anything that's different on the water since
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:24.200]  Fukushima, we were talking to a guy, one of the fishermen right here in the dock and he said he
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:28.120]  saw some debris come in from Japan and I asked him how he knew it was Japanese. He said it had
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:37.240]  Japanese writing on it. That's always been, there's always been debris from overseas. We've been
[02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:42.360]  finding the glass balls here for years. It's one of our prizes that we look for on the beach and
[02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:50.440]  the ocean. But yeah, there's always been debris. Asking about the catch level, how the fishing
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:54.840]  has been over the last few years? The fishing has been since Fukushima. What's the catch level?
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:57:00.040]  Has it gone up, down, same? Haven't noticed anything different. Really? Yeah, I haven't.
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:05.960]  So the levels in San Francisco, a little southwest of San Francisco at Surfers Beach,
[02:57:05.960 --> 02:57:09.640]  you heard about those, you heard that there are several times higher. We are salesmen down there
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:14.440]  and found in excess of 10 times what the normal radiation is or at least what the local news
[02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:18.520]  reports as a normal level radiation. Are you concerned about that reaching up here? Yeah,
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:23.240]  I'm very concerned about it. On your guys' website several times a day following you guys at the
[02:57:23.240 --> 02:57:28.520]  coast, seeing what you found. That's why I stopped here today. I was down checking my boat, saw you
[02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:35.080]  stand here, pulled the brakes on and came to say hi. So I haven't noticed anything different,
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:39.000]  definitely very concerned. Asking if there's anything else you'd like to add?
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:46.040]  It's in the, this is our, this is our livelihood. Yeah, this is your livelihood. So if you could
[02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:50.360]  tell the viewers, anybody out there who may be skeptical of this, what would you say to somebody?
[02:57:51.960 --> 02:58:00.600]  I'd say to get yourself knowledgeable, pay attention to what's going on in the world.
[02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:07.960]  You know, there's a lot of deception out there. So check all your sources and
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:13.240]  That's right. Be, be a light in this darkness of deception. We'll try like that. We appreciate your
[02:58:13.240 --> 02:58:16.840]  time. Thank you for coming out. All right. Good job to carbon. A little bit of overdrive there. I
[02:58:16.840 --> 02:58:20.280]  want to come back and go over some of these radiation numbers with you. But again, the good
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:25.880]  news is we, we are not finding super high levels in most areas. Only a few areas had the 1,000
[02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:32.360]  percent, 49% increase. The redwoods were only double and at those levels, it's not very life
[02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:36.360]  threatening. The problem is if you get hot particles, but I'm glad we sent our crew out
[02:58:36.360 --> 02:58:39.880]  there. Now we're going to investigate Southern California. Stay with us and overdrive
[02:58:39.880 --> 02:58:44.680]  in FullWars.com forward slash show for the free feeds. I'll be back this Sunday,
[02:58:44.680 --> 02:58:49.000]  four to six p.m. Central, the Sunday Transmission. Spread the word folks.
[02:58:50.920 --> 02:58:55.720]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information. I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk
[02:58:55.720 --> 02:59:00.600]  and his team of patriots over at MyPatriots Supply. Several years ago, Matt was sitting in
[02:59:00.600 --> 02:59:04.040]  his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed,
[02:59:04.040 --> 02:59:08.440]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck, deciding to take action.
[02:59:08.440 --> 02:59:14.040]  A company run by patriots for patriots was born. MyPatriots Supply has never taken a loan
[02:59:14.040 --> 02:59:19.720]  or accepted outside funding. They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50
[02:59:19.720 --> 02:59:24.600]  hardworking American men and women. It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:59:24.600 --> 02:59:29.960]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high quality storeable foods from MyPatriots Supply.

[02:59:55.400 --> 02:59:58.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.720 --> 03:00:13.000]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:22.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.520 --> 03:00:26.840]  On the Sunday transmission, we're going to have Jakari Jackson pop in with reports.
[03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:32.120]  For us as well from Southern California, we're going to go ahead and send them down there now
[03:00:32.120 --> 03:00:37.960]  and investigate that area. I'll also cover 92 million Americans not in labor force.
[03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:46.120]  That's simply amazing. For every one job added, nearly five people left the workforce.
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:50.760]  I mean, this is a Gen 21. This is the depression by design.
[03:00:51.400 --> 03:00:57.880]  Jakari, we're going to post these in an article soon, but the good news here is you only found
[03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:04.120]  double the normal level of background radiation at the Redwoods. That's still not good. You only
[03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:09.640]  found a 20, 30% increase in what it should have been at the Golden Gate Bridge. And you only,
[03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:17.560]  I mean, everywhere it's higher than it should be. It's 58 CPM at Laguna Creek, Klamath, California,
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:29.880]  Falls, Klamath, 56, 54 at Crab Shack, Ankerway, California, 60% CPM. That's a little over double
[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:36.440]  what it should be there at Pistol River State Scenic Viewpoint, a Blue Star Memorial Highway
[03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:42.760]  marker, Brookings, Oregon, 40 CPM, Humboldt Bay Generating Station. That's a reactor. It's only
[03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:48.360]  44 CPM. But the thing is it is higher. It is higher than it's supposed to be. But these levels
[03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:52.600]  aren't that big of a deal unless you get one of the particles that's obviously creating this.
[03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:56.760]  Jakari, in the three minutes we've got left, other key points about your observations, what
[03:01:56.760 --> 03:02:02.040]  you think of this. I think this is good news overall. I mean, it's a lot better than it being
[03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:07.240]  a thousand percent everywhere or something. That would be panic level. Exactly. Because,
[03:02:07.240 --> 03:02:11.080]  you know, I told David Knight on our first day, our first broadcast, we went out to the beach,
[03:02:11.080 --> 03:02:15.320]  you know, I was concerned to be standing in such high levels of radiation that CPMs accounts per
[03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:22.360]  minute were hit, regressing well over 300 close to 372, which the normal there is supposed to be
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:27.480]  about 30 CPMs. So that was very concerning to me. But as we traveled up and down the coast, as
[03:02:27.480 --> 03:02:32.120]  you mentioned, we didn't find anything that was that hot. So I was happy about that. You know,
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:36.520]  definitely happy for the locals. And we talked to various people. Some people were knowledgeable
[03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:41.000]  about the situation at Surfer's Beach. Some people weren't. But regardless, everybody we talked to
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:46.280]  has been a pretty... A little bit of break up there. Let him hold that thought for a moment.
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:50.760]  While we get a connection back, I'm going to just say this. There needs to be an investigation
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:56.760]  in and around San Francisco of why all over that beach and all over the bluffs in the woods,
[03:02:57.320 --> 03:03:03.560]  I mean, 500%, 1400%, 1000%. And we've talked to radiologists and nuclear plant workers,
[03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:08.280]  they say just 25, 30 years ago, they'd all be wearing lead suits around that. And you know,
[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:12.520]  if you had to work around that, I mean, that is a big deal. It's not a big deal to be around it
[03:03:12.520 --> 03:03:17.240]  for an hour or two, whatever. But in them saying, oh, 50,000 hours is safe at the health department,
[03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:26.840]  that is pure bull. Jakari, are you back? Okay, let's go back. You're breaking up some of your
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:32.840]  still there. Jakari, any other points? No, you said it pretty much there, Alex. I'm very happy
[03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:39.400]  that we didn't encounter the high levels going up north on the coast. But I am very knowledgeable
[03:03:39.400 --> 03:03:42.760]  and concerned about these people, about these people who have knowledge about these areas,
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:46.600]  like Tyler, we just talked to. And also other people we've talked to, like the gentleman who
[03:03:46.600 --> 03:03:51.160]  saw the melting starfish, people who've been out here and say they find strange and always going
[03:03:51.160 --> 03:03:55.000]  on with the jellyfish and other things like that. People have to know about this information,
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:04:01.080]  just like Tyler said, to educate you. All right, where are you going next, Jakari?
[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:06.040]  Next, we're going to go up to the coast to Portland, do some research.
[03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:11.800]  All right, great job with the crew, a little bit of technical stuff, but that's what makes
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:18.680]  it fun. It's live, it's real, it's unscripted. Go with the God, be safe there in the West Coast,
[03:04:18.680 --> 03:04:23.880]  beautiful. I love Oregon, love Northern California, love Seattle. I like San Diego too, it's just
[03:04:23.880 --> 03:04:28.680]  Los Angeles that I avoid, like to plague. I physically feel sick when I'm in LA, that's
[03:04:28.680 --> 03:04:33.320]  small. I mean, I go to New York, London, you know, I've been in big cities in Mexico, hadn't felt
[03:04:33.320 --> 03:04:39.160]  sick. Los Angeles, man, I just will not go out there anymore. And I got a lot of great opportunities
[03:04:39.160 --> 03:04:44.360]  to go out to LA and see really cool people. I just physically and spiritually, it's like entering
[03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:51.160]  Satan's, Satan's toilet bowl or something. It's just, it's something else. All right, great job,
[03:04:51.160 --> 03:04:55.480]  the entire crew here at InfoWars Center. All you the listeners, our sponsors, everybody,
[03:04:55.480 --> 03:05:09.960]  I'll see you this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Word willing. And tonight, 7 o'clock, InfoWars only news.
