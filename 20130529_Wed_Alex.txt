[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:39.600]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:39.600 --> 00:47.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. Thank you so much for joining us on this 29th day of
[00:47.040 --> 00:54.160]  May 2013. We're going to be live here for the next three hours. I am your host, Alex
[00:54.160 --> 01:01.060]  Jones. And there is quite a bit of news and information that we're going to be breaking
[01:01.060 --> 01:05.060]  down and covering in great detail today.
[01:05.060 --> 01:15.000]  We're going to be looking at the collectivization of our constitutional republic, but also how
[01:15.000 --> 01:24.920]  this process is going on worldwide. There are now right at 11 million people, or 10,978,000
[01:24.920 --> 01:32.920]  on disability here in the United States alone. And continuing, we are going to look at the
[01:32.920 --> 01:42.780]  expanding crisis in the Obama administration as the public awakens from its long sleep
[01:42.780 --> 01:44.940]  and realizes that we're under oppressive tyranny.
[01:44.940 --> 01:55.920]  When you have the IRS going after gun owners, when you have the IRS persecuting Pro-Second
[01:55.920 --> 02:03.560]  Amendment foundations, the import-export group persecuting Gibson guitars, the IRS persecuting
[02:03.560 --> 02:10.160]  Christian groups, pro-life groups, the list goes on and on, you are in a tyranny. And
[02:10.160 --> 02:12.280]  the people involved should all go to jail.
[02:12.280 --> 02:20.400]  The greatest danger historically is an oppressive government. So the question here is, will
[02:20.400 --> 02:26.440]  there just be a bunch of outrage that goes nowhere? Or is there an avenue to bring criminals
[02:26.440 --> 02:32.560]  in the federal occupied? It is occupied by foreign corporations publicly. Will we bring
[02:32.560 --> 02:37.420]  them to justice, or will this just now be a new precedent where what we've known for
[02:37.420 --> 02:42.080]  a long time is just admitted publicly, but nobody gets in trouble?
[02:42.080 --> 02:46.160]  It's kind of like warrantless wiretapping. Six years ago, they would have congressional
[02:46.160 --> 02:52.360]  hearings and presidential denials. And then when it came out, it indeed was going on.
[02:52.360 --> 03:00.440]  It just got swept under the rug, kind of like torture. So the question is, how long will
[03:00.440 --> 03:10.600]  all of this go on? How long will we continue to just let the status quo continue as this
[03:10.600 --> 03:13.440]  republic rots?
[03:13.440 --> 03:18.760]  Of course, it's now coming out that IRS higher ups indeed were directing the persecution.
[03:18.760 --> 03:26.240]  This was a coordinated across the board program. These are aggressive authoritarians who pose
[03:26.240 --> 03:34.000]  as, quote, liberals. We also have some other reports that I'm gonna get to dealing with
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.200]  the situation in the Middle East.
[03:38.200 --> 03:49.920]  Where Obama is asking the Pentagon for a Syria no fly zone plan. And you also of course yesterday
[03:49.920 --> 03:57.800]  of Israel threatening Russia to not deliver anti aircraft weapon systems that are defensive
[03:57.800 --> 04:01.280]  to Syria and threatening to bomb those shipments.
[04:01.280 --> 04:08.560]  I mean, this is the way big wars start. You already had back on 888 in 2008, the day the
[04:08.560 --> 04:16.240]  Olympics started. In China, Georgia, with NATO attacking Russian-held South Ossetia
[04:16.240 --> 04:25.520]  and Abkhazia as a test program to basically see what the Russians would do.
[04:25.520 --> 04:31.920]  The Russians counter struck enrolled mobile, medium range, nuclear missiles into the area.
[04:31.920 --> 04:36.200]  And again, I don't live in Russia. I don't like their tyrannical government. But I don't
[04:36.200 --> 04:38.920]  like the globalists that have occupied me either. And it's the globalists that are coming
[04:38.920 --> 04:40.920]  down on us trying to start all these wars.
[04:40.920 --> 04:47.120]  And I understand Israel has old scores to settle and wants part of Syria, wants to expand
[04:47.120 --> 04:56.400]  its living space. But this is an immoral thing happening, funding Al Qaeda to attack Syria
[04:56.400 --> 05:01.360]  and then now say they're going to start an air bombardment.
[05:01.360 --> 05:05.800]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for all of
[05:05.800 --> 05:10.880]  us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[05:10.880 --> 05:16.260]  your liberty, freedom and security. And that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[05:16.260 --> 05:21.800]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[05:21.800 --> 05:26.640]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the most effective way
[05:26.640 --> 05:31.400]  you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation. The do it
[05:31.400 --> 05:37.720]  yourself public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer be provided.
[05:37.720 --> 05:42.400]  This along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations and additional government
[05:42.400 --> 05:48.600]  control of food supplies and resources says food is the ultimate priority. E Foods Direct
[05:48.600 --> 05:55.480]  will provide free shipping on all food orders until further notice. Call 800-409-5633 or

[07:00.900 --> 07:06.520]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE and now the new bird
[07:06.520 --> 07:11.120]  flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support

[08:24.640 --> 08:31.640]  Thank you for joining us today my friends. I am your host Alex Jones and I'm going to
[08:37.760 --> 08:44.760]  attempt yet again today to cover a massive amount of news and information and take your
[08:45.960 --> 08:52.060]  phone calls and we do have Mark Dice, media analyst joining us at the bottom of the next
[08:52.060 --> 08:59.060]  hour and then Adam Kokesh who of course was disappeared for a week into a federal prison
[09:00.360 --> 09:06.920]  for speaking at a marijuana legalization rally and charged with assaulting police but because
[09:06.920 --> 09:12.420]  our federal gods but because there were so many video angles that he never resisted,
[09:12.420 --> 09:19.420]  they dropped those charges and he refused to process any of it, called their bluff,
[09:19.420 --> 09:24.440]  their bluff, they backed off because of a free press, an alternative press.
[09:24.440 --> 09:30.000]  Now I've got articles here where Democrats, they announced this last week and then I heard
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.320]  it again on local radio this morning and I forgot to tell the crew, will you guys print
[09:33.320 --> 09:39.860]  me an article, Democrats propose licenses for press and they're also calling for this
[09:39.860 --> 09:45.680]  in England where oh you have to be government licensed to be in the press and see Google
[09:45.680 --> 09:52.680]  a few years ago, delisted infoawars.com and prisonplanet.com with no reason from Google
[09:54.280 --> 09:55.080]  news.
[09:55.080 --> 10:02.080]  You see, they decide just like Facebook censored thousands of people's Facebooks that posted
[10:03.040 --> 10:10.040]  video and their own photos about the March Against Monsanto Sunday. They did not want
[10:10.040 --> 10:16.120]  the public to see that information. The March Against Monsanto, they had several over the
[10:16.120 --> 10:21.480]  weekend, what Saturday and Sunday. We've got a report coming up on that.
[10:21.480 --> 10:27.320]  This is how they're controlling us and we should get outraged by the IRS persecuting
[10:27.320 --> 10:34.320]  media and Gibson guitars and libertarians and veterans groups and Jewish groups. It's
[10:34.320 --> 10:41.320]  basically anybody that isn't a total globalist communist. We should take that personal, we
[10:41.460 --> 10:47.220]  should be upset by it, that they were persecuting pro-life groups and telling them, well half
[10:47.220 --> 10:49.820]  the time you've got to be pro-abortion.
[10:49.820 --> 10:55.820]  Some weird fairness doctrine they say Trump's the First Amendment. We should take it very,
[10:55.820 --> 11:02.820]  very, very, very personal that they ship guns into Mexico to blame and demonize the people
[11:02.820 --> 11:09.180]  in Mexico, to blame and demonize gun owners and scapegoat and false flag the Second Amendment.
[11:09.180 --> 11:16.180]  We should be on top of all of this and we should take it personally because when someone
[11:18.100 --> 11:23.580]  tries to rob our First Amendment or our Second Amendment, they are attempting to enslave
[11:23.580 --> 11:23.940]  us.
[11:23.940 --> 11:29.140]  It's so elementary, but we have to take it personal and get upset about it. We have to
[11:29.140 --> 11:36.140]  take it personal when John McCain on Veterans Day, on Memorial Day, flies to Turkey who
[11:40.500 --> 11:47.500]  is running with NATO and our government a criminal, offensive, preemptive war against
[11:49.100 --> 11:56.100]  Syria who's done nothing to anybody in an attempt to put al-Qaeda, real al-Qaeda in
[11:56.100 --> 12:00.700]  charge.
[12:00.700 --> 12:07.700]  Real al-Qaeda in charge. And then McCain poses with all these people and calls them heroes
[12:12.220 --> 12:18.180]  and now Obama says Pentagon, I want a no fly zone plan, which means bombing the country.
[12:18.180 --> 12:22.540]  He'll get probably a peace prize for that in this Orwellian world. And then if they
[12:22.540 --> 12:27.020]  try to launch any helicopters or other aircraft to fight the al-Qaeda forces, they'll be shot
[12:27.020 --> 12:33.420]  down and then airfields will be bombed and that will be hailed as a peace move.
[12:33.420 --> 12:38.860]  As another country like Libya is given to al-Qaeda, as the old Western dictator, Hazi
[12:38.860 --> 12:45.860]  Mubarak is removed three years ago ahead of the Libya invasion because he objected to
[12:45.900 --> 12:50.660]  putting al-Qaeda in control of Libya and said, I will have no part of that. And they said,
[12:50.660 --> 12:56.820]  we're out of power then, buddy. We're gonna put the Muslim Brotherhood in. This is the
[12:56.820 --> 13:00.820]  type of stuff that is so incredibly outrageous.
[13:00.820 --> 13:07.820]  Yeah, here's the WorldNetDaily article. And I heard him reporting this on Fox Radio this
[13:08.900 --> 13:15.900]  morning at about 8 AM. Dems want new controls on journalists. This is a WorldNetDaily article
[13:15.900 --> 13:22.900]  that just came out. The Democrats in Congress looking to create brand new government controls
[13:23.460 --> 13:25.520]  in journalists in America.
[13:25.520 --> 13:31.400]  And then it goes through breaking down Senator Dick Durbin, appearing on Fox Sunday, said
[13:31.400 --> 13:36.480]  it was too early to call for a special counsel to investigate the recent monitoring of journalists.
[13:36.480 --> 13:40.300]  The Associated Press and Fox, he's our President Obama's guest department. Durbin said he supported
[13:40.300 --> 13:45.620]  the media shield law that wasn't sure if such a measure would protect bloggers or someone
[13:45.620 --> 13:49.300]  who is tweeting.
[13:49.300 --> 13:56.300]  And he goes on to basically say, real journalists will have to be certified by the government.
[13:57.300 --> 14:02.540]  That's just some of what we're gonna be getting into. And England's openly saying, we wanna
[14:02.540 --> 14:08.340]  certify you in the UK to say you're a trusted little toady, and then you can be a member
[14:08.340 --> 14:12.580]  of the press. Look, a member of the press is anybody that wants to go to a city council
[14:12.580 --> 14:19.580]  meeting or wants to go to a land rights meeting or wants to go to a school board meeting.
[14:20.660 --> 14:26.300]  Or let's say you're a journalist who wants to report on gardening. So you go to the gardening
[14:26.300 --> 14:31.100]  expo, you've got a blog, you take photos, you post them. If it's interesting, you'll
[14:31.100 --> 14:35.180]  get a following. Pretty soon you'll have sponsorship.
[14:35.180 --> 14:42.180]  And see, the system doesn't wanna compete with that. So the moves are regulate, tax,
[14:42.180 --> 14:47.100]  get rid of press protections that the press has always had in this country. Get rid of
[14:47.100 --> 14:52.820]  it for the general public and say, well, your blog isn't protected for sources cuz we say
[14:52.820 --> 14:59.820]  infowars.com isn't a press outlet, so we're gonna try to subpoena who your sources are.
[15:02.820 --> 15:08.660]  And then I told the Texas Rangers, I'm gonna fight you in court. And they backed off and
[15:08.660 --> 15:15.180]  basically said, well, we already have it anyways. Of course they do. It's all already spied
[15:15.180 --> 15:21.900]  on. They just wanna subpoena it so they can use it in court. I mean, this country is light
[15:21.900 --> 15:28.420]  years down the rat hole of surveillance and tyranny.
[15:28.420 --> 15:33.780]  And I know you as listeners understand and know that. But the general public is just
[15:33.780 --> 15:39.920]  now going, you mean the IRS does persecute people? You mean the press is being spied
[15:39.920 --> 15:45.740]  on and persecuted? You mean whistleblowers are being persecuted? You mean the White House
[15:45.740 --> 15:48.420]  got caught lying?
[15:48.420 --> 15:52.340]  And again, Obama is the worst thing this country's ever seen, but it's only because the country's
[15:52.340 --> 15:58.980]  rotting. The next president, unless it was somebody like Rand Paul, you better believe
[15:58.980 --> 16:04.180]  it's going to be worse. Because criminals in government have gotten away with more and
[16:04.180 --> 16:07.540]  more and more and more.
[16:07.540 --> 16:12.960]  And as society begins to degenerate, criminals get bolder cuz they're wanting to snatch enough
[16:12.960 --> 16:19.660]  money and enough resources to live out the rest of their lives once the prosperity is
[16:19.660 --> 16:25.460]  gone. Because they know corruption kills prosperity, so they're all trying to grab as much as they
[16:25.460 --> 16:35.360]  can get right now. And this is the historical paradigm that repeats itself time and time
[16:35.360 --> 16:43.580]  again throughout history.
[16:43.580 --> 16:48.080]  And so here's what I'm gonna do. We don't have a guest until the middle of the next
[16:48.080 --> 16:52.300]  hour and I never get to your calls in the first hour like I say I'm going to do. We're
[16:52.300 --> 16:56.980]  going to get into the IRS scandal. We're going to get into the latest military buildup in
[16:56.980 --> 17:01.220]  the Middle East that is the greatest threat of serious chain reaction war I have ever
[17:01.220 --> 17:08.820]  seen in my 18 years being on air and historically looking at it.
[17:08.820 --> 17:15.120]  We haven't seen stuff like this since the Cuban Missile Crisis, 1961. The situation
[17:15.120 --> 17:21.840]  with Israel threatening Russia. And again, I don't have a dog in this hunt, folks. I
[17:21.840 --> 17:32.300]  don't live in Israel. I don't live in Russia. I don't, people make it personal like, well,
[17:32.300 --> 17:37.260]  you better be for Israel threatening to attack Russian arms shipments into Syria that are
[17:37.260 --> 17:38.260]  defensive weapons.
[17:38.260 --> 17:44.300]  I mean, the Israelis should be against starting a war with Russia. And Russia understands
[17:44.300 --> 17:51.780]  that's its only seaport. That's been their ally for 60 something years. Russia understands
[17:51.780 --> 18:00.420]  that it's being encircled by al-Qaeda jihadis that NATO, the Ford Foundation, the US government
[18:00.420 --> 18:09.180]  have been injecting into 11 different countries, Dagestan, Chechnya, Georgia, Tajikistan,
[18:09.180 --> 18:14.140]  Uzbekistan, the list goes on and on.
[18:14.140 --> 18:19.860]  And Russia is very open with this saying, hey, you're putting radical jihadis in. We
[18:19.860 --> 18:26.300]  don't want you to put al-Qaeda in charge of Syria. We don't like you putting all these
[18:26.300 --> 18:31.360]  jihadis into all these other countries. We're going to give them surface to air missiles
[18:31.360 --> 18:33.940]  that are defensive to shoot down your aircraft.
[18:33.940 --> 18:40.900]  They're flying and bombing them. And do not touch our ships that are bringing those missiles
[18:40.900 --> 18:46.840]  in. The Russians have moved battleships and missile cruisers into the Mediterranean. They're
[18:46.840 --> 18:55.220]  massing ships right now. And hopefully, cooler heads will prevail, but the West is attacking
[18:55.220 --> 18:58.480]  for two years Syria.
[18:58.480 --> 19:04.220]  They're encircling Russia. They're funding terrorists. And George Washington said, and
[19:04.220 --> 19:10.460]  Common Sense says, and morality says, you don't start fights with people that aren't
[19:10.460 --> 19:16.100]  attacking you. Mama said, Daddy said, don't go up and punch somebody in the nose for no
[19:16.100 --> 19:17.100]  reason.
[19:17.100 --> 19:20.260]  That's what bullies do. But if somebody punches you, you let them have it till they're on
[19:20.260 --> 19:29.220]  the ground. And this is immoral, torture is immoral, secret arrest is immoral. And everybody
[19:29.220 --> 19:32.980]  always said, well, it's for the Muslims. Folks, the globalists run the radical Muslims. All
[19:32.980 --> 19:38.220]  of this is being beta tested, and the precedent's being set to be used on the American people.
[19:38.220 --> 19:48.580]  So whatever you wanna talk about, open lines, or first time callers, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[19:48.580 --> 19:54.340]  What do military folks think about backing Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria? Well, the enemy

[21:29.660 --> 21:33.820]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[21:33.820 --> 21:38.060]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having a lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[21:38.060 --> 21:42.180]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[21:42.180 --> 21:45.580]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[21:45.580 --> 21:50.180]  army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[22:00.900 --> 22:05.300]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for all of
[22:05.300 --> 22:10.400]  us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[22:10.400 --> 22:15.780]  your liberty, freedom and security and that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[22:15.780 --> 22:21.320]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[22:21.320 --> 22:26.160]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the most effective way
[22:26.160 --> 22:30.940]  you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation. The do it
[22:30.940 --> 22:37.260]  yourself public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer be provided.
[22:37.260 --> 22:41.920]  This along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations and additional government
[22:41.920 --> 22:48.100]  control of food supplies and resources says food is the ultimate priority. E Foods Direct
[22:48.100 --> 22:54.820]  will provide free shipping on all food orders until further notice. Call 800-409-5633 or

[23:07.220 --> 23:12.020]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[23:12.020 --> 23:17.580]  House at a time when only the President could obtain this world class healer. Now, 27 years
[23:17.580 --> 23:22.220]  later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you

[23:36.700 --> 23:43.500]  immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-Venus-Fly

[24:43.460 --> 24:49.540]  Let's go ahead and go to phone calls right now. Andy in Georgia, you're on the air, welcome.
[24:49.540 --> 24:56.540]  Hi, Alex. Hey, buddy. Hey, I just want to thank you for having me on the show. I've
[24:56.540 --> 25:03.300]  been a long time listener. You've been talking about some stuff recently that I definitely
[25:03.300 --> 25:10.020]  feel passionately about, like topics relating to what's coming out today about making people
[25:10.020 --> 25:17.900]  disappear and things like that, and exactly how states might be able to start doing that.
[25:17.900 --> 25:26.340]  Well, I don't think many people know about this, but Georgia on July 1st is to become
[25:26.340 --> 25:35.980]  the first state in the country that will no longer have a public 836-8735, 1-866-Venus-Fly,
[25:35.980 --> 25:42.260]  or visit Carnivora.com. All right, nice frank call there. Let's go ahead and take another
[25:42.260 --> 25:47.980]  call here from Mohawk in Pennsylvania. Mohawk, you're on the air.
[25:47.980 --> 25:51.860]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing today? Good.
[25:51.860 --> 25:54.660]  I got a little comment about a story you ran on Infowars.
[25:54.660 --> 25:58.980]  Yes, sir. About the military being present at a gun
[25:58.980 --> 26:06.180]  rally in Philly. Yes. It wasn't the military. It was a squad from the Pennsylvania Watchmen,
[26:06.180 --> 26:10.300]  part of the Watchmen of America. Yeah, I don't know the story you're talking
[26:10.300 --> 26:14.860]  about, sir, so I'll have to... We're opening the phones up right now. Appreciate your call.
[26:14.860 --> 26:18.220]  I don't understand that we got some prank callers calling in today. We don't screen
[26:18.220 --> 26:23.100]  the calls. That makes it fun, makes it interesting. Let's talk to Michael in New York. You're
[26:23.100 --> 26:29.580]  on the air. Go ahead. Michelle, go ahead. Hey, Alex. I just wanted
[26:29.580 --> 26:33.180]  to call you and thank you. About two and a half months ago, I called in and talked to
[26:33.180 --> 26:38.260]  you, and listening to your show really inspired me. I've worked Human Services all my life.
[26:38.260 --> 26:44.340]  I'm a 40-year-old woman. And I started to get involved with BlogTalk Radio, and over
[26:44.340 --> 26:50.820]  the last seven weeks, I have two shows on a station on BlogTalk Radio, and I'm helping
[26:50.820 --> 26:54.860]  spread the word with you. I mean, it's a time that we take a stand. President Obama has
[26:54.860 --> 27:00.220]  made his speeches about stop listening to alternative media, and now he wants to restrict
[27:00.220 --> 27:04.460]  it, and it's time that we take a stand. If we don't stand now, we're going to have nothing
[27:04.460 --> 27:12.180]  to stand for as time goes on. So I'm on Freedomizer Radio, and I've learned so much, and I've
[27:12.180 --> 27:17.500]  learned so much from listening to you, and I'm just very grateful for everything that
[27:17.500 --> 27:19.460]  you do. You don't need to thank me, ma'am. It's about
[27:19.460 --> 27:23.780]  the info. America is starting to wake up. The rest of the world is waking up because
[27:23.780 --> 27:28.860]  the tyranny has gotten so bad, and the tyrants knew we'd wake up, so they built up this giant
[27:28.860 --> 27:34.860]  infrastructure to oppress us when we woke up. But that never works in history. In the
[27:34.860 --> 27:39.340]  end, they fall. The question is, do we have to go through this living hell first?
[27:39.340 --> 27:44.020]  Well, we are going through this living hell, but you know what? These trolls mean that
[27:44.020 --> 27:48.220]  you're doing the right thing too. That's the other thing. So they're frustrating, but when
[27:48.220 --> 27:53.660]  people want to lash out at you, you know you're getting the message out there, and you're
[27:53.660 --> 27:56.940]  doing a phenomenal job. Well, ma'am, I'm just trying to survive,
[27:56.940 --> 28:06.740]  and I appreciate your call. What's happening and what's going on is that people have lost
[28:06.740 --> 28:13.820]  confidence in the system, and people now are realizing their special interests that are
[28:13.820 --> 28:18.860]  controlling their life through government and through regulations, who themselves are
[28:18.860 --> 28:25.800]  then exempt from the rules that they've put in place for everybody else.
[28:25.800 --> 28:30.720]  And that is the essence of discrimination, the essence of tyranny. We're gonna be taking
[28:30.720 --> 28:35.980]  first-time calls, like I said, moving quickly through the calls on the IRS scandals. Do
[28:35.980 --> 28:39.660]  you think it's gonna bring Obama down? Are the Republicans afraid to go there because
[28:39.660 --> 28:42.100]  they know Obama has got a lot of dirt on them?
[28:42.100 --> 28:44.820]  What do you think's gonna happen on that front? What do you think about our government funding
[28:44.820 --> 28:50.620]  al-Qaeda and the fact that that's now mainstream news? I listen to talk radio, I read the newspaper,
[28:50.620 --> 28:57.220]  it's being discussed. Should we be funding al-Qaeda? It is al-Qaeda, actual real al-Qaeda
[28:57.220 --> 29:06.260]  in places like Libya and Syria, and using them to attack southern areas of Russia and
[29:06.260 --> 29:16.580]  some of the satellites that are still attached to Russia, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[29:16.580 --> 29:22.300]  And first-time callers today. Also, Henry Kissinger has been confronted while receiving
[29:22.300 --> 29:26.520]  the Freedom Award by the great Luke Rudowski. We're gonna be playing the audio and video
[29:26.520 --> 29:33.780]  of that. We also have Henry Kissinger saying China and the US have a common challenge to
[29:33.780 --> 29:38.700]  build a new world order. There's video and audio of that. And we're gonna be getting
[29:38.700 --> 29:45.380]  to a ton of other news as well straight ahead today. I'm Alex Jones. This is the GCN Radio
[29:45.380 --> 29:46.380]  Network.
[29:46.380 --> 29:56.260]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:56.260 --> 30:05.380]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had
[30:05.380 --> 30:09.660]  a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known
[30:09.660 --> 30:14.380]  fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across
[30:14.380 --> 30:19.900]  the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[30:19.900 --> 30:24.980]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[30:24.980 --> 30:30.740]  be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[30:30.740 --> 30:35.460]  Younggeviti. The Younggeviti products are designed to give you the real nutrition you
[30:35.460 --> 30:40.100]  need. And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've

[32:01.180 --> 32:06.260]  with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic
[32:06.260 --> 32:12.140]  system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve
[32:12.140 --> 32:16.800]  patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled the most
[32:16.800 --> 32:22.740]  vital and important preparedness items at InfowarsShop.com. These are items that I did
[32:22.740 --> 32:28.140]  research on that I personally use. We've got the LifeStraw so you can turn fetid water

[33:09.780 --> 33:20.340]  parts of the world. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[33:39.780 --> 33:49.060]  Alright folks, I've got open phones right now at 800-25-99231 on any issue or item you'd
[33:49.060 --> 33:53.380]  like to talk about. Again, we don't screen your calls which makes it interesting. Sometimes
[33:53.380 --> 33:57.580]  people call in kind of like they're having their own private discussion or they're plugging
[33:57.580 --> 34:02.900]  something and a little rule about radio is plugging really is fine but you might want
[34:02.900 --> 34:10.660]  to tell a story about it so that it's interesting in a context to something. In the world, our
[34:10.660 --> 34:16.860]  government, our criminal government is spying on people, intimidating people. Basically
[34:16.860 --> 34:28.820]  you name it, they're doing it right now. And we either get upset about this and take action
[34:28.820 --> 34:34.700]  and use this corruption and this awakening to reverse the pendulum or which happens a
[34:34.700 --> 34:35.940]  lot in history.
[34:35.940 --> 34:41.420]  It just all gets accepted and then we know we live in a third world country with a bunch
[34:41.420 --> 34:47.660]  of paramilitary crazies ruling over us. There's an amazing video compilation and article by
[34:47.660 --> 34:53.680]  Steve Watson up on Infowars.com. Nix Obama, powerful video compares scandal responses
[34:53.680 --> 34:58.940]  because I've been seeing that myself, how he looks and acts just like Richard Nixon
[34:58.940 --> 35:02.980]  and the rest of his administration does and the parallels are incredible.
[35:02.980 --> 35:12.500]  Also Kissinger, US and China to collaborate on globalist world order. That is some of
[35:12.500 --> 35:18.580]  the news that we're gonna be breaking down on that front. And I'm gonna play Kissinger
[35:18.580 --> 35:25.760]  being confronted. I also talked to the head police officer over three different jurisdictions
[35:25.760 --> 35:27.820]  that are gonna be in and around Bilderberg.
[35:27.820 --> 35:31.420]  I ended up talking to him today and I was a little bit cynical and the guy said he was
[35:31.420 --> 35:36.020]  a listener but talking to him, he sounded pretty genuine and was describing stuff he'd
[35:36.020 --> 35:39.940]  listened to on the show. And said that he wanted to make sure that free speech was honored
[35:39.940 --> 35:48.580]  and the free press and demonstrators and that they have moved to make sure that Bilderberg
[35:48.580 --> 35:52.820]  has to pay for the cost of policing.
[35:52.820 --> 35:58.060]  And that they are wary of provocateurs and that he was aware that Bilderberg reportedly
[35:58.060 --> 36:03.060]  had a history of staging things themselves to demonize people. So that's in Watford,
[36:03.060 --> 36:07.940]  just northwest of London. That's an interesting article up on Infowars.com. Kindergartner
[36:07.940 --> 36:11.420]  forced to apologize for brandishing tiny Lego gun.
[36:11.420 --> 36:18.580]  You have all these violence in movies, TVs, shows, sell all these toys, Nerf guns, you
[36:18.580 --> 36:23.260]  name it. And then when kids play with them, the police get called. Or when your kid takes
[36:23.260 --> 36:28.660]  a Lego toy to school, they get kicked out of school or get suspended or have to apologize.
[36:28.660 --> 36:34.600]  It was kind of like how there's bars everywhere and alcohol sold everywhere. But now the feds
[36:34.600 --> 36:37.960]  wanna lower the alcohol level to 0.5.
[36:37.960 --> 36:45.140]  So if you even drink one beer and then go get in your car, you're gonna be arrested.
[36:45.140 --> 36:50.420]  It's all just a way to get us into the system. And again, awakening to this, realizing this
[36:50.420 --> 36:56.880]  is going on, is the way to turn things around. Ben, Chris, Robert, Rob, Daniel and many others,
[36:56.880 --> 37:00.500]  we're gonna go to your calls right now. Have your point, have your question ready.
[37:00.500 --> 37:05.620]  And when we start the next hour, I'll get into the Kissinger confrontation. Google is
[37:05.620 --> 37:15.820]  launching blimps to beam their signals and spy beams over you, whether you like it or
[37:15.820 --> 37:20.300]  not, and to fly around scooping up all your other wireless transmissions. I mean, the
[37:20.300 --> 37:22.820]  Google is the NSA.
[37:22.820 --> 37:31.100]  But it's the Globalon, New World Order, Skynet, don't be evil garbage. And I wonder if I was
[37:31.100 --> 37:36.700]  in the ocean, if somebody had stuck a big decal on top of Great White's head that said,
[37:36.700 --> 37:41.740]  don't be evil. Or maybe a couple little pink flowers. Then people would jump in with a
[37:41.740 --> 37:45.860]  Great White and like, you're my friend, cuz it said don't be evil.
[37:45.860 --> 37:51.160]  You just put don't be evil on the side of a shark. It would make it safe and nice. It's
[37:51.160 --> 37:57.780]  all just camouflage. Let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Missouri. You're on the air. Welcome
[37:57.780 --> 37:58.780]  Ben.
[37:58.780 --> 38:04.340]  Hey, Alex. It's great to talk to you. I am a huge fan. I've been a listener since last
[38:04.340 --> 38:10.620]  year. I actually saw somebody with a Ron Paul bumper sticker and right next to it, they
[38:10.620 --> 38:18.340]  had an Info Wars sticker. So I ended up going to the site and I've been a fellow extremist
[38:18.340 --> 38:25.020]  for, you know, ever since. So what I wanted to talk about today was the police state here
[38:25.020 --> 38:32.420]  in St. Louis. Now, a couple weeks back, I was at my home and, you know, just playing
[38:32.420 --> 38:40.140]  some guitar in the garage, hanging out, you know, nothing really that offensive, nothing
[38:40.140 --> 38:41.140]  that loud.
[38:41.140 --> 38:47.140]  Okay, so a cop comes, you know, your neighbors called us, you're being too loud, you know,
[38:47.140 --> 38:52.060]  what's your name? Okay, I gave him my name. Well, let me see your ID. So, you know, I'm
[38:52.060 --> 38:56.100]  at my own place. I got a fence and yard. I don't carry my wallet around with me when
[38:56.100 --> 39:01.060]  I'm at home. So, all right, well, what's your social security number? He says to me,
[39:01.060 --> 39:05.020]  so I'm like, well, you know, why do I need to give you my social security number? Can't
[39:05.020 --> 39:09.820]  you just look up my information from, you know, from your file here using my name and
[39:09.820 --> 39:18.580]  address? So finally, he starts to get pretty upset with me because I won't, you know, bow
[39:18.580 --> 39:25.340]  down and kiss his badge and kiss his ring and just goes, give me your hand. So I back
[39:25.340 --> 39:30.580]  up and I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on? What are you doing? And, you know,
[39:30.580 --> 39:36.140]  I think that eventually the story ends up, I ended up spending 24 hours in jail, in St.
[39:36.140 --> 39:42.420]  Louis city jail around a bunch of gang members who were snorting heroin. But I'll tell you
[39:42.420 --> 39:48.460]  what, Alex, by the end of my little vacation for a noise complaint, which I couldn't post
[39:48.460 --> 39:53.140]  bail for because it was zero dollars and I'm fighting it right now, but at the end of the
[39:53.140 --> 39:58.740]  whole thing, you'll be glad to know that I had basically converted and been preaching
[39:58.740 --> 40:03.220]  unity to these guys. And by the end of it, they were really upset to see me go. But the
[40:03.220 --> 40:09.580]  whole point of the whole story is, Alex, that, you know, I think police who are trained now
[40:09.580 --> 40:13.220]  are trained much differently than they were before. I think they're trained to cover
[40:13.220 --> 40:19.460]  their steps, to make sure that, you know, their fellow officers don't get in trouble
[40:19.460 --> 40:26.420]  and to err on the side of, you know, violating people's rights and then covering their steps
[40:26.420 --> 40:31.460]  instead of erring on the side of, oh, well, I can't enforce this ordinance because it,
[40:31.460 --> 40:35.820]  you know, is really subjectively written, et cetera, et cetera. And I think these are
[40:35.820 --> 40:41.700]  the small things, the small battles that people are fighting on a day to day basis that are
[40:41.700 --> 40:47.100]  really you know, it's a, it's kind of a microcosm of the bigger overall picture.
[40:47.100 --> 40:51.220]  And even for me to just, you know, fight this and go to court and say, no, I'm not guilty
[40:51.220 --> 40:57.260]  of this. I didn't do anything wrong is just one small thing that I or anybody else could
[40:57.260 --> 41:04.140]  do to just stand up and say, I'm not going to take this anymore. So just wanted to share
[41:04.140 --> 41:07.960]  a quick story with you, Alex. Like I said, it's great to talk to you. It's great to be
[41:07.960 --> 41:10.700]  on the air and keep up the good work.
[41:10.700 --> 41:16.220]  Well, thank you, sir. Really great testimony and how you found the broadcast via somebody
[41:16.220 --> 41:20.940]  putting an info wars.com bumper sticker on their car. That's, that, that's how we reach
[41:20.940 --> 41:28.180]  out to people. That's how we're going to change the future destiny of society. And our culture,
[41:28.180 --> 41:33.160]  we good people can either stand up and say no to corruption, or we can just give into
[41:33.160 --> 41:34.160]  it.
[41:34.160 --> 41:37.860]  And then the pit of hell is the limit. I appreciate you calling in. Thank you. We're gonna go
[41:37.860 --> 41:43.640]  to more calls here, but police are trained. There's terrorists everywhere. Everyone's
[41:43.640 --> 41:49.680]  an insurgent. Everyone's a suspect, but government and anybody that doesn't immediately follow
[41:49.680 --> 41:54.960]  their orders is a criminal who needs to be tasered and arrested.
[41:54.960 --> 42:00.440]  And again, a lot of police got into policing because of family or a need to serve, or it
[42:00.440 --> 42:06.300]  seems like a decent job when they get out of the military and they want some adventure.
[42:06.300 --> 42:10.900]  But I'd say if you look at the criminology, maybe 20% end up getting out of police academy
[42:10.900 --> 42:18.480]  right around that number are either sociopaths, sadists, psychopaths, high functioning psychopaths.
[42:18.480 --> 42:23.360]  They're on power trips. And they're the cops that rape women. They're the CPS people that
[42:23.360 --> 42:30.660]  rape little kids. They're the firemen that plant pipe bombs so they can save the day.
[42:30.660 --> 42:37.400]  They're the people that will use that to oppress and dominate folks. And government is now
[42:37.400 --> 42:41.980]  psychologically testing, not even so much looking for criminals, but for kind of dumb
[42:41.980 --> 42:51.840]  down people that will get off on dominating people from a mindset of for their own good.
[42:51.840 --> 42:56.840]  And I mean, I see the videos online all the time where the cops show up and they go, we
[42:56.840 --> 43:01.920]  had a report of yelling. No, everything's fine. Well, we're coming to your house. No,
[43:01.920 --> 43:06.180]  it's all right. You know, the husband, wife, we're fine. Kids are playing in the yard.
[43:06.180 --> 43:09.720]  We don't feel like talking to you. You don't have a warrant. Well, come out of there or
[43:09.720 --> 43:13.160]  we're going to kick down your door. So they kick down the door. The people have their
[43:13.160 --> 43:19.960]  hands up and they taser them as an act of dominance, as an act of I'm going to punish
[43:19.960 --> 43:20.960]  you.
[43:20.960 --> 43:28.160]  They call that pain compliance, pain compliance. And I mean, I've seen videos from 20 years
[43:28.160 --> 43:39.100]  ago. It's in the extra of my film, Martial Law. And in that documentary, we show in the
[43:39.100 --> 43:45.520]  extra where the LAPD and others have pro-life demonstrators that are just sitting on the
[43:45.520 --> 43:51.320]  sidewalk. And they come over with nunchucks, twist their arms till they compound fracture
[43:51.320 --> 43:53.000]  and bones pop out.
[43:53.000 --> 43:58.480]  And the federal judge ruled that was good. Cuz they didn't get up when they were told,
[43:58.480 --> 44:05.080]  so we're gonna give you a compound fracture, which by the way can kill you. We're going
[44:05.080 --> 44:12.320]  to basically snap your arm in a way meant to twist the arm off, show the bone. If you
[44:12.320 --> 44:14.560]  keep going, you can twist the whole arm off completely.
[44:14.560 --> 44:19.560]  It's not that hard to tear somebody's arm off with nunchucks. And they just twist, all
[44:19.560 --> 44:24.400]  right, okay, bones sticking out. And then the preacher and the priest, there's video,
[44:24.400 --> 44:28.480]  they fall over with their arms broken. And the cops come over with billy clubs and get
[44:28.480 --> 44:30.520]  a few extra beats in.
[44:30.520 --> 44:36.840]  Cuz this is like a sexual rape experience for them. There's blood, they've got some
[44:36.840 --> 44:44.480]  bones popped out. And it's so pleasurable to see the priest fall on the ground and then
[44:44.480 --> 44:52.360]  to come over and beat them with a billy club. It feels so manly, so good to hurt an innocent
[44:52.360 --> 44:58.520]  person who wants to draw attention to killing children.
[44:58.520 --> 45:04.900]  It feels so good doing that, that you wanna continue it. And we now have state run religion
[45:04.900 --> 45:09.520]  to a great extent in this country where they're teaching everybody that they need to worship
[45:09.520 --> 45:15.700]  the government. That's what the Bible says, instead of support a constitutional government.
[45:15.700 --> 45:25.840]  That it's really disgusting, but you didn't submit to that cop. You didn't produce your
[45:25.840 --> 45:31.520]  ID. And again, it would have been one thing if he had a report of a burglar, and it was
[45:31.520 --> 45:33.000]  a real report.
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.560]  And then the cop shows up and you're running around the back of the house and they wanna
[45:35.560 --> 45:42.160]  see your ID. But I've had alarms go off at my house before, back when I lived in town.
[45:42.160 --> 45:48.080]  And you put your shirt on, your pants on, you turn it off cuz one time a bird flew into
[45:48.080 --> 45:53.840]  the window and set it off. Another time, I don't know why it went off. Cops show up 20
[45:53.840 --> 45:57.520]  minutes later, they're banging on the door, you go down, you're wearing shorts, t-shirt.
[45:57.520 --> 46:03.000]  You open your door and you go, yeah, yeah, I'm Alex Jones, I live here. And both the
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.160]  cops look at me and they recognize who I am.
[46:07.160 --> 46:12.160]  And they're like, yeah, yeah, Alex Jones, yeah. I'm like, all right, they start turning
[46:12.160 --> 46:17.960]  away. And I say, have a great night. They turn back around, they go, let us see your
[46:17.960 --> 46:26.120]  ID. And my office was right there and I said, okay. And I got it, these cops know who they
[46:26.120 --> 46:27.120]  are.
[46:27.120 --> 46:30.280]  And I got it and I said, here it is. And they didn't even really look at it. It was an act
[46:30.280 --> 46:35.720]  of domination. And I said, hey, you be safe out there. I said, you knew who I was, you
[46:35.720 --> 46:46.000]  just did that to make me do something. And I laughed out. I mean, can you imagine? Cuz
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.680]  they admitted, yeah, yeah, no, we thought that was you.
[46:48.680 --> 46:54.960]  Really, you know I live here, you can check the address. I am one foot away from you under
[46:54.960 --> 47:00.500]  a porch light. I didn't get into all this with them. And you wanna see my ID? Just because
[47:00.500 --> 47:04.080]  I showed them humanity and said, hey, you guys have a great night, be careful out there.
[47:04.080 --> 47:08.040]  I think that's what I said, yeah. Have a great night, be careful out there.
[47:08.040 --> 47:13.360]  And it was a male cop and a female cop. It was a female cop turned around, looked at
[47:13.360 --> 47:18.840]  me. I gotta be honest, it's female cops generally. I'm not saying they're all bad, but they're
[47:18.840 --> 47:25.240]  the worst. And said, let me see your ID. And I looked at her and I smiled at her. And I
[47:25.240 --> 47:26.920]  said, yeah, okay, I'll show you that.
[47:26.920 --> 47:32.600]  And then after I got to him, I got back and I said, you knew who I was, didn't you? And
[47:32.600 --> 47:39.940]  the cop behind her goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, we do. We thought that was you. I just looked
[47:39.940 --> 47:44.840]  at him and said, going back to exact memory, I said, you just did that to make me do that.
[47:44.840 --> 47:51.360]  And I laughed at him and shut the door. Because it's funny. I mean, it'd be like if they went
[47:51.360 --> 47:57.380]  to the mayor's house and they know the mayor, they've met the mayor.
[47:57.380 --> 48:04.920]  And okay, mayor, can I see your ID? Just a mindless act of domination, because I showed
[48:04.920 --> 48:10.000]  him humanity. See, I've noticed with police, especially the bad ones, if I bow up and I'm
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.680]  arrogant and really use an authoritative voice on them, they tend to like back off and get
[48:15.680 --> 48:16.680]  freaked out.
[48:16.680 --> 48:23.000]  But then with bad police, if you act friendly towards them, they act like it's weird because
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.400]  they don't wanna be your friend. They don't want there to be a community. They've been
[48:26.400 --> 48:33.040]  taught, the FBI training manual will say, if someone shats you up and is nice to you,
[48:33.040 --> 48:36.840]  they may be an extremist. Let's go to another call here. Rob in California, you're on the
[48:36.840 --> 48:37.840]  air.
[48:37.840 --> 48:41.320]  Hey, good morning, Alex, how are you?
[48:41.320 --> 48:42.960]  Good, buddy, welcome.
[48:42.960 --> 48:50.560]  Hey, thank you for taking my call. I am, in a sense, going through the process of waking
[48:50.560 --> 48:56.720]  up, have been for about a year or so. And one of the things that has really resonated
[48:56.720 --> 49:05.600]  with me and which spurred me to call in was the fact that you just said open, open lines.
[49:05.600 --> 49:12.040]  But back to my point, I'm an epileptic. I've had epilepsy since I was about 14. It was
[49:12.040 --> 49:18.360]  when I was first diagnosed, moved out to California a couple of years back, changing medications
[49:18.360 --> 49:25.300]  and got off the antidepressant that I was taking at the time to control the seizures.
[49:25.300 --> 49:32.800]  And I'm taking a new drug that is not an antidepressant, which has really accelerated
[49:32.800 --> 49:41.000]  the process of waking up. And every once in a while, I hear you talk about fluoride in
[49:41.000 --> 49:47.740]  the water, as well as SSRIs and antidepressants. But what I'd really like to get your take
[49:47.740 --> 49:59.240]  on is if you could share some insight on either fluoride or antidepressants and how that factors
[49:59.240 --> 50:06.120]  into various neurological disorders, such as the one I have with epilepsy, or autism
[50:06.120 --> 50:15.120]  for that matter, that would be great. I think that situations like this and health concerns
[50:15.120 --> 50:22.360]  and foods are a real good way to connect with people who, like myself, for a long time didn't
[50:22.360 --> 50:30.840]  want to get in and recognize the fact that there is a larger dark force, say the New
[50:30.840 --> 50:36.800]  World Order and all that other stuff. That's a lot to grasp. But when you get on a topic
[50:36.800 --> 50:42.120]  such as, like for me, epilepsy, there's something that I can really identify with.
[50:42.120 --> 50:47.840]  And for a lot of other people, it's food and water. And that can be the turning point in
[50:47.840 --> 50:49.640]  somebody who's almost there.
[50:49.640 --> 50:56.120]  No, I hear you, Rob. And again, we don't necessarily know that your epilepsy was caused by environmental
[50:56.120 --> 51:00.760]  issues that may be genetic, but we know epilepsy and all their brain disorders are way up.
[51:00.760 --> 51:05.040]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water

[54:17.960 --> 54:35.320]  You know, we had that last caller who was bringing up epilepsy and I've had Dr. Russell
[54:35.320 --> 54:42.360]  Blalock, brain surgeon on, I've had many other medical doctors on to go over what the bistrenol
[54:42.360 --> 54:48.440]  lay and the hydrofluorosolic acid, the fluoride, what all the different chemicals in the food
[54:48.440 --> 54:54.480]  and the water are doing, what the pesticides that are grown pharmacologically in the crops
[54:54.480 --> 54:59.920]  so that insects can't eat them, what that does to guinea pigs and things. And it's neurological
[54:59.920 --> 55:06.940]  disorders, the entire spectrum depends on your genetics, what it's going to do to you.
[55:06.940 --> 55:11.960]  They're all just going straight up. This is what we talked about yesterday. Cancers going
[55:11.960 --> 55:18.320]  straight up, IQs going straight down, sperm count going straight down, female fertility
[55:18.320 --> 55:24.720]  going straight down. People ask, well, then why are lower class poor people able to have
[55:24.720 --> 55:25.720]  so many kids?
[55:25.720 --> 55:30.600]  Because they have when they're about 12 or 13. And then quote, middle class or wealthy
[55:30.600 --> 55:38.200]  people tend to start having kids at about 35, 40. And by then, you know, you're infertile.
[55:38.200 --> 55:42.040]  And this stuff's all been actuaried out. I mean, they write books about it. Bertrand
[55:42.040 --> 55:49.240]  Russell wrote books. The White House Science Czar wrote books. Henry Kissinger, we're going
[55:49.240 --> 55:54.200]  to play the clip next hour. The video's up on infowars.com, was confronted about State
[55:54.200 --> 55:57.720]  Department random 200 for forced population reduction.
[55:57.720 --> 56:02.760]  And then said, get out of here, ridiculous in his fake German accent. He's got a brother
[56:02.760 --> 56:08.680]  because they've lived in the US since they were teenagers, who has no German accent.
[56:08.680 --> 56:15.760]  It's just completely fake. Dr. Kissinger, I mean, what a joke. He was getting an award
[56:15.760 --> 56:25.760]  by Wesley Clark. No, it wasn't Wesley Clark. It was General Petraeus, excuse me, who was
[56:25.760 --> 56:29.320]  talking about what a hero Henry Kissinger is.
[56:29.320 --> 56:35.080]  Kissinger's the one that engineered the sellout of our republic to China. Not to the Chinese
[56:35.080 --> 56:40.320]  people, but to the communist Chinese, to use them as a managed market to leverage out our
[56:40.320 --> 56:43.520]  communities. I mean, here's an example. I was reading the news yesterday. My son was
[56:43.520 --> 56:49.060]  at work and brought it to my attention, that China can sell mahogany beds and stuff from
[56:49.060 --> 56:51.920]  Madagascar for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[56:51.920 --> 56:56.780]  And they're allowed to ship their guitars. Of course, the owner of Gibson, the CEO, part
[56:56.780 --> 57:01.900]  owner had talked about this on the show. They're allowed to ship all that in, violating the
[57:01.900 --> 57:07.040]  Cary Act, but that's left alone because they lobby Congress and the federal regulators.
[57:07.040 --> 57:12.100]  But then American companies can't go to other countries, get legal hardwood, bring it in
[57:12.100 --> 57:18.040]  and make stuff here. Even if you can pay the living wage, pay the insurance, pay all the
[57:18.040 --> 57:23.960]  extra stuff, they won't let you get the wood to build it and they will SWAT team rage you
[57:23.960 --> 57:27.120]  until you're shut down.
[57:27.120 --> 57:44.560]  The Lacey Act. And this is the type of stuff that they do. Because they used America's
[57:44.560 --> 57:50.200]  openness to shut us down. We were an open, free country by and large, wide open, and
[57:50.200 --> 57:56.240]  then we just allowed foreign bribery to go on. And now we are just being shut down. I
[57:56.240 --> 58:00.480]  mean, you know how much money you can make coming in and shutting down your competition?
[58:00.480 --> 58:05.200]  That automatically opens up the market for only you. Whether it's guitars, or whether
[58:05.200 --> 58:11.320]  it's electricity from coal power plants, or whether it's cars, or whether it's medicines,
[58:11.320 --> 58:18.040]  whatever it is, America is done if people like Henry Kissinger have their way.

[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.040]  number two, taking your phone calls right now. I'll continue with calls right now. Then
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.120]  I'm going to get into some of the military and police news that a bunch of important
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.520]  clips are going to play. Henry Kissinger is calling for the US to merge with authoritarian
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:52.840]  China to form a new world order. He'll be at Bilderberg, of course, next week. I'll
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:58.800]  be there if they let me into England covering that. Let's go ahead and talk to Daniel in
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:06.560]  Canada, another holding of the German Queen of England. Daniel, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.560]  Good afternoon, sir. This is your informative extremist from Edmonton, Alberta. I just wanted
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:15.200]  to bring up a couple of few points and then briefly discuss them and you can bring up
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.960]  your thoughts after. So first thing I want to talk about today, especially from Edmonton,
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.760]  Alberta, Canada. I know a lot of listeners are here from Canada, but I wanted to bring
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:28.480]  this to their attention. Recently, police officers on their uniforms are now attaching
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:35.280]  cameras. And they'll be recording every confrontation they have with a suspected criminal so they
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.800]  can have this in court, I guess. So watch out for that one.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:44.240]  So there's no perception of privacy in public. But then cops act like when you have a camera
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:52.680]  that you've just burned a house down or something. And again, they want to use the cameras when
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:59.240]  it can bolster their side of the story. That's why all of us need to have cameras as well.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.760]  And just like that new tyranny app you guys released not too long ago, that would be an
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.120]  effective tyranny watch, I believe it was called. That's on nightly news. That would
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:11.480]  be a good counter for that one. But moving quickly here also, recently, our new mayor,
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:18.760]  Stephen Mandel, stepped down. And this is quite getting my sorry, it's making me nervous
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:24.160]  because basically, if this new mayor stepped down, he's been on his eighth term already.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:27.880]  And when he's stepping down, I'm really scared they're gonna get some fed in there. And it's
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:32.720]  just gonna just completely change our city because we're a smaller city. We're not really
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.000]  the biggest in Canada, but we are quite a big chunk of them. And yeah, new mayor is
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.800]  going to be elected pretty soon. And I'm going to see how that's going to be. And also not
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:47.360]  too long ago, during the May 2nd, I think it was the Osama bin Laden fake death, and
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:53.160]  there was an Infowars article saying beware, be cautious for heightened alert attacks from
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.880]  the State Department to release that or the state of defense. And on that same day, there
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:02.240]  was multiple bomb threats all over Canada as well. We had a couple of bomb threats close
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.240]  to my house.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.240]  And we also had-
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:09.040]  Sure, well, I mean, who has the motive to put out bomb threats? Government, because
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.280]  then it gets to pose as the savior. Thanks, Daniel. Robert in California, you're on the
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.280]  air.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.280]  Are you there?
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.280]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:23.920]  All right. How are you doing today?
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.640]  Not doing too well, actually. Go ahead.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:31.720]  Hey, I just wanted to congratulate you last week for Rachel Maddow coming out and attacking
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:37.120]  you after Piers Morgan and some of these other acts that are happening. This just goes to
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:42.960]  show you how effective you are becoming. And I just wanted to thank you for a driving force.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.420]  Brother, you don't need to thank me, man. I'm just trying to survive here. I mean, only
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:50.960]  a crazy person would not fight these tyrants. And again, Rachel Maddow has no audience on
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:59.040]  her own. The reason Piers Morgan was so big was that it was aired all over the world.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:04.480]  And it was put on television everywhere. It was a huge media event to have the trance
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.560]  broken. But I hear you and I appreciate you calling in. What's on your mind? Cuz I see
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.400]  you wanna talk about Benghazi wars, etc.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:17.920]  Yeah, everything that you just keep pounding and pushing out there, something here eventually
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.280]  is going to stick. I mean, I pray to God that this is gonna come down. I pray to God for
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.140]  you and your crew that you guys are safe.
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:31.560]  When I say thank you, I mean thank you because you helped wake me up and to start really
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.600]  looking at these issues. And as soon as I had a buddy who came back from Hawaii years
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:44.480]  back and watched the program, and it was your buddy that you helped produce the 9-11 documentary,
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:50.840]  that was a wake-up call for me back then. And I've just really enjoyed over the years
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.760]  helping to educate other people when it comes to chemtrails. And I just really appreciate
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.360]  your driving force because you helped-
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:01.320]  Brother, brother, kudos to you as well. We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:06.040]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:10.800]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When

[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:06.160]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for all of
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:11.260]  us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:16.640]  your liberty, freedom, and security, and that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:22.180]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:27.020]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries, but here's the most effective way
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:32.280]  you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight, government regulation. The do-it-yourself
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:38.400]  public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer be provided. This,
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.780]  along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations and additional government
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:48.980]  control of food supplies and resources, says food is the ultimate priority. e Foods Direct

[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:05.240]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:10.360]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:15.860]  elements as well as key vitamins, and as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:21.020]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are hundreds of great products at
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:28.080]  info wars team.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:34.980]  in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound. When
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:40.020]  I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:45.380]  in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners to go to info
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:51.100]  wars team.com and to order just three of their products, and you will see the changes in
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:56.180]  the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately. Start your journey to
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:08:05.640]  health and wellness today. Info wars team.com.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:12.660]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:37.540]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:41.740]  All right, folks, thank you for joining us. We are now into the second hour today. We're
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:47.260]  gonna continue with open phones, but at the bottom of the hour, media analyst and commentator
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:49.160]  Mark Dice is gonna be joining us.
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:54.540]  He goes out and does those man on the streets that make jaywalking pale in significance
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:09:01.460]  in LA, where he doesn't just pick the stupid people, he puts who he actually talks to.
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:07.780]  And 90% of people plus will say we should have fascist rule to arrest all the tea partiers.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:11.100]  He'll go out and have them say, yeah, we should start door-to-door gun confiscation and people
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.980]  sign a petition.
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:18.360]  And he went out also and talked to people and asked them, what is Memorial Day? On Memorial
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:26.260]  Day, and hardly anyone knew even what it was. And so he's gonna be joining us at the bottom
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:32.620]  of the hour and we're gonna play some of that video and audio here on air.
[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:38.060]  Also, Henry Kissinger, who if you don't know how bad he is, he was the former Secretary
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:44.980]  of State. He has been involved in the Democratic overthrow of Chile and hundreds of thousands
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:52.780]  killed, famously illegally bombing Cambodia. But his larger crimes are State Department
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:58.620]  memorandum 200, which said, cut off people's food so they starve to death all over the
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.620]  world.
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:08.980]  Harm rebels to destabilize stable governments to sow discord to reduce human population.
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:13.460]  Serious wars against humanity, not a war to say we've been attacked for defending ourselves.
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:19.320]  That's a righteous war, a legitimate war, not even a preemptive war to conquer someone
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:25.520]  and kill their military, but just conquer them because you want to control that area.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:32.220]  That's an immoral war, but nothing compared to, we're gonna take over an area and we're
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:44.040]  going to use wars and we're going to use famine and all this stuff to kill the general public.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:49.820]  That is a crime against humanity. And he confronted the articles up on Infowars.com, Kissinger
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:54.340]  confronted as mass murderer by Luke Rudowski, who's gonna pop in at the start of the next
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:59.100]  hour. One of my proteges, I'm very proud of the work he does with his team, first rate
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.580]  an example to all reporters.
[01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:05.700]  We've got great reporters, but I think they're an example to us and myself as well. The great
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:10.780]  job they do is we're gonna be airing that in a moment. But first, here is Kissinger,
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:20.180]  US and China to collaborate on globalist world order. And he was speaking to the Asia Society
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:24.380]  on how to build a world order, that means globalism, for the first time in history on
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.380]  a global basis.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:30.260]  So a global order based on global basis, global government. And he talks about doing that
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:36.140]  with China, not the Chinese people, but with the incredibly oppressive Chinese government.
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:45.380]  Who by the way, again, they get to ship in hardwoods out of Madagascar to the US and
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:49.640]  they're allowed to do it. But US companies go and get it from other legal lawful certified
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.200]  areas like Gibson.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.700]  And they're shut down for months on end and persecuted because they're an American company
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:06.700]  and they're conservative. Again, this is a managed economy we're looking at. So let's
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.300]  go ahead and go to that Kissinger clip.
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:21.420]  As has already been pointed out, we had a common adversary. But as time has evolved,
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:31.260]  we are now facing a common challenge. And the challenge is how to build a world order
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:40.300]  for the first time in history on a global basis. We talk a lot about world community.
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:47.260]  But the fact is there has never been a world community before. The various regions conducted
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:53.380]  foreign policy and their affairs in substantial isolation from each other.
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:54.380]  That's right.
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:13:04.300]  Where else one region, primarily Europe, dominated the rest of the world. This is the first time
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:14.660]  the different cultures are interacting on a permanent basis to establish a peaceful
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:17.900]  and growing international system.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:23.460]  All right, let's stop there. Again, they always shell globalism as a great thing. This is
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:28.940]  where the authoritarians of the world gang up to leverage out other free or wealthy areas.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:32.580]  See, in the old days, even if a government was somewhat corrupt, they would want wealth
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:35.460]  so they could skim more off the top.
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:39.140]  And they would want the country to be wealthy because that made the public acquiesce to
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:44.220]  their centralized control, which again, they skimmed off the top. This is the opposite.
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:50.340]  Globalism is a form of hyper-feudalism or mercantilism, where it's a managed economy
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:55.380]  where they want control where only they can operate. And where they use that centralized
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:02.820]  control to leverage out all their competition towards an aim of making the population poor,
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:07.240]  towards the aim of making them more manageable, towards the aim of having them accept social
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:16.180]  engineering, State Department memorandum 200, or the Royal Commission on Population 1949.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:23.100]  Which is the plan of this whole program worldwide. You'll never hear the liberals who are really
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:30.060]  authoritarian nightmare demons. You'll never hear them saying, hey, we shouldn't have Fox
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:32.580]  Con with suicide nets for Apple.
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:38.060]  Apple shouldn't be the most bloodthirsty, hardcore corporation paying Chinese workers
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:44.980]  30 cents an hour. And their children in mass are chained up in warehouses or on light poles
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:52.500]  outside, lucky if they get one meal a day. How are we gonna compete with that? That's
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:57.300]  not gonna build China up. And that's not a living wage for them, where you create an
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.300]  economy.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:02.760]  They don't want you wealthy. Mexico can't even compete with China now. India can't compete
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:08.980]  with China. It is a race to the bottom, as Ross Perot famously described on CNN. I've
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:15.540]  clips this in my film, Fall of the Republic, where we explain they're not just gonna kill
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.620]  the dollar as the world reserve currencies.
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:25.180]  They're killing all the currencies, hyper inflating them. But depressing the real economy
[01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:31.580]  at the same time show that the hyper inflation doesn't really show itself very fast. Because
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:36.780]  the real economy is constricting worldwide. So even if you have hyper inflation, that
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.220]  hot money is only given to insiders.
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:45.040]  And so you only see the real inflation in luxury items, or in real estate, or things
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:51.820]  like that. And so it is a managed computerized technocratic economy. Look at this article
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:16:05.620]  right here out of CNBC. Is the dollar dying? Why the US currency is in danger? And if you
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:12.700]  go to drudgereport.com, above that, or below that, it has a article about the rise of the
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:14.700]  new order.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:19.620]  For years now, the collapse of the dollar's been in the cards. Recent developments showing
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:23.920]  mounting pressure on the dollar reserve currency status, with a major international deflation
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:29.740]  going on. The threat of inflation through money printing is unreal. However, should
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:36.020]  the dollar's reserve currency status end, the repatriation of trillions of petro and
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:40.860]  euro dollars could lead to a strongly inflationary scenario.
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:46.620]  And that's from the site Real Currencies, absolutely on target with that statement.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:55.740]  There is world depression going on while they hyper inflate away the giant derivatives debts,
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:00.340]  which are not ours, they're the globalists. They use that derivative wall to buy up control
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:07.100]  of the world. With the dollar as the reserve currency, the US had to export dollars in
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:11.140]  the early years after the war, especially for Europe.
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:16.100]  The famous euro dollars, this sounds great, print money and buy whatever you like. But
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:23.100]  with gold window, it was also risky. Overprinting could mean excess dollars would be exchanged
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:32.120]  back into gold, depleting US reserves. So what do they do? They just naked short gold
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:38.780]  so that gold prices don't actually go up for what they should via global dollar inflation.
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:43.900]  But then people won't sell their gold even when they artificially deflate it. So in the
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:50.040]  real world, gold's actually where it always was, up. It's just all fraud within fraud.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:58.060]  And I kind of digress into all this. The point is, is that it's a rigged system. And we come
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:03.900]  back from break, I'm gonna play this confrontation with Henry Kissinger via Luke Rudowski.
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:11.160]  He's given the award, and then Luke, well, I'll describe it when we come back from break.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:18.340]  But it gives me a headache. I mean, just all of this really does give me a giant screaming
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:30.180]  headache because it's so obvious. All of this is like a sick joke, and it just gets weirder
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:35.220]  and weirder and weirder and more absurdist, where they get away with more and more and
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:36.220]  more.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:39.500]  And there's some good signs where people are beating smart meters all over the US. They're
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:45.260]  spying on them and radiating them. And folks are marching against Monsanto and the media
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:50.940]  blacks it out, but that only discredits the mainstream media that much more. And citizen
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:55.820]  journalists are confronting people, and a lot of folks are waking up, and the scandals
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:57.580]  are coming out.
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:19:04.620]  But still, it's kinda like too little too late in a way because you've kinda got a paradox
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:14.780]  where there's these dumbed down yuppies everywhere who think not caring is cool and who don't
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:19.260]  even know what Memorial Day is, who buy into the whole system. And then you've got those
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.620]  of us that are informed and work hard.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:25.660]  And then you've got the welfare mass. Some of them know the system's corrupt, but they're
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:33.340]  either disabled or can't find a job, deindustrialization. A lot of them actually can't even blame them.
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:37.940]  You've got the illegals brought in to drive down the wages. You can't even blame them.
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:42.120]  But still, it is, and then the elite thinks they're gonna steal all the wealth and just
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:46.580]  live in armored fortresses.
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:52.420]  But then clearly they're not disciplined enough to stay segregated away from all of us. It's
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:57.620]  all a bunch of people lying to themselves. It's a decadent culture is what it is, and
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:22.460]  it is cruisin' or a collapse.
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:27.620]  You can't beat a Big Berkey to remove dangerous chlorine, all types of fluoride, pathogenic
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:33.820]  bacteria, cysts, parasites, and unhealthy byproducts from municipal water. Berkey water

[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:38.460]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:42.580]  to service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:46.180]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:49.340]  army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our

[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:34.860]  Kissinger, who's openly calling for the US and China to collaborate on a global authoritarian
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:43.860]  world order, was confronted just a few days ago by our own Luke Rudowski that is going
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:49.380]  to be popping in at the start of the next hour. And you've just got to love how he's
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:57.180]  being given this award by General Petraeus, the guy that brags, yeah, the CIA watches
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:25:05.340]  you via your appliances. And then he gives him a Freedom Award. So I will narrate some
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:12.200]  of this video for radio listeners. But again, the full video is up on infowars.com. Kissinger
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.860]  confronted as a mass murderer. Here it is.
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:20.700]  And so, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Board of Trustees of the Intrepid Sea
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:29.700]  Air and Space Museum, I am deeply honored to present the 2013 Intrepid Award to my friend
[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:58.620]  and my hero, the Honorable Henry A. Kissinger.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:07.300]  Really disgusting. They're in tuxedos. He gets off on the crowd. He loves it. This is
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:14.340]  video of Luke in the bathroom putting on his glasses that have a camera in them and getting
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:19.620]  ready to go in. Yeah, I've seen police with those glasses now. We need that type right
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:31.220]  there. Comes over to Kissinger at his table, leans over him and says this.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:36.420]  Hi Mr. Kissinger, it's a pleasure. How are you doing? I just wanted to know what you
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:40.940]  mean when you said illegal we do immediately, unconstitutional takes a little longer, the
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:43.780]  WikiLeaks document. What do you mean by that?
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:44.780]  Come on.
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:47.860]  No, no, no. I mean, it came out WikiLeaks.
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:50.860]  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of stuff on it.
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:51.860]  Do you know the agenda?
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:53.820]  What are you doing this for?
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:59.580]  I'm just, I'm here covering this event. Just wanted to talk to you. We are changed and
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:02.340]  we want to know maybe what the agenda of the Bilderberg group meeting is going to be in
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:03.340]  a couple of days.
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:04.340]  Get lost, please.
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:12.620]  How does it feel winning the award when you're wanted as a mass murderer and wanted in many
[01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:23.900]  countries and what's your millions of people? How does it feel? You know, I'm not a coward.
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:28.740]  You know, this freedom awards a lie and you're wanted for mass murder in different countries.
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:33.420]  You know, it's a lie.
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:38.960]  And so ladies and gentlemen, and then there's even more footage of him out at the dinner
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:45.120]  coming out and they're confronting him. Coward, coward, you're a coward. The opposite of obviously
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:49.500]  of a coward going and confronting him, calling himself serving. He called him a coward and
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.040]  said you're self-serving.
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:57.000]  When Kissinger blueprinted the one child policy in China, blueprinted shutting down our industry
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:03.240]  to transfer it to their industries with Kissinger and Maury Strong controlling them in China,
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:12.660]  breaking up team, you know, bajillions. And he just sits there, this pathetic, I see in
[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:15.160]  the video, he gets up there to be given the award.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:21.040]  And it's always these globalist spiders hugging on each other and grasping at each other and
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:27.620]  giving each other awards for what they've done. And the arrogant Henry Kissinger, high
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:32.340]  ranking globalist operative complicit mass murder in Latin America, bombing civilians
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:37.500]  in North Vietnam, terror bombing of Cambodia, overthrowing of democratically elected government
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:40.300]  in Chile.
[01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:45.740]  And then setting China up to deindustrialize the United States. But his biggest crime,
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:51.100]  ladies and gentlemen, is programs to start wars against conservative governments, communist
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:58.600]  governments, liberal governments, any government. If it wasn't wrecking the society in his memorandum,
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:03.380]  you can read it, it's declassified in 1992, it's from 1973.
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:09.640]  He says to destabilize these countries, destabilize everything so they can come in and take over.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:16.880]  And they're running the same program, it's called Agenda 21 against us here in this republic.
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:25.040]  Mark Dice is coming up, then we'll go to Chris. And we'll go to David, Elliot, Montine, Jonathan,
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:31.660]  and many others that are patiently holding. And again, the scandals on the IRS, we've
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:36.980]  got some breaking news on that. IRS higher ups requested info on conservative groups,
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:43.780]  letters show. No kidding, they did. These are authoritarians, these are not liberals.
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:50.180]  These are people that want your money and want you to be their slave, their slave masters.
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:30:00.780]  Here on the march, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:18.420]  Watch me, watch me, I got it. Watch me, I got it. Hey, I got something that makes me
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:26.420]  want to shout. I got something that tells me what it's all about. I got soap and I'm
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:36.420]  super bad. All right, folks, we're back live. I got soap and I'm super bad. Bad in a good
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:44.420]  way. I got a move that tells me what to do. Ladies and gentlemen, that kind of made me
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:48.420]  happy, a little bit of that. A little bit of that James Brown coming in there with us.
[01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:54.420]  We're going to go to our guest here in just a moment with some pretty amazing information.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:34:00.420]  And the realization that people don't know what Memorial Day is and they don't know anything
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:03.420]  else. They think it's like a shield of protection. We're going to talk about that with media
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:11.220]  analyst and author Mark Dice. But first, I wanted to remind listeners that I've assembled
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:17.120]  the best books, the best videos, the best t-shirts, the best information to wake people
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:24.820]  up, non-GMO, heirloom, super high quality seeds at the lowest price, one of the widest
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:31.220]  selections, the best non-GMO, clean, storeable foods, all of it to be self-sufficient at
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:35.180]  info war store.com.
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:44.700]  And I'm extending it out until the end of Bilderberg coverage, until the 9th of June.
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:50.900]  I'm extending the 15% off on propure water filtration systems. That's 50% off the already
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:55.640]  lowest price you're going to find out there. I am the biggest distributor of these stainless
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:00.220]  steel gravity fed their filters, blow away the competition side by side comparisons,
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:02.940]  all available at info war store.com.
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:12.020]  And you can also call toll free to get your order in 888-253-3139. Now the factory just
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:17.060]  made a bunch more of the stainless steel systems, but they're already very close to selling
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:24.580]  out of the traveler, that's my favorite, the lowest priced one. And it also is the smaller
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:29.740]  one that's great for your RV or your car or camping or at work or wherever.
[01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:33.300]  Gravity fed filters to stop drinking all the poisons and garbage that are in the water
[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:37.000]  table or that are added into there. They've got the special filters, you can also get
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.060]  to cut out the fluoride. The point is, is that it's all discounted 15% off with promo
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:49.940]  code WATER15, but I'll run it till the ninth if supplies last, and then it'll go on back
[01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:50.940]  order.
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:53.520]  They're making more right now, they should have more in a few weeks they think. And they're
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:57.980]  not sold out yet in their warehouse, but they're getting close. You order from us, drop ship
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:06.580]  it from them, the manufacturer. The point is, is that if you want your traveler especially,
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:10.140]  or you want any of them, you better get it right now because people go crazy when I get
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:13.660]  15% off doing this one other time, and it's sold out in about two weeks.
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:18.360]  We've been going about less than a week on this. So if you want it, get it, it is the
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:23.660]  Propure water filtration system, go read up on it. And break with the system now, stop
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:28.420]  drinking the tap water, that's something big you can do right there. Start trying to eat
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:34.700]  non-GMO some of the time. Just begin the journey with 1000 miles starts with a single step.

[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:58.900]  the good guys, finances what we're doing, the media division I'm building, the films
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:04.900]  we're trying to make, all the things we do. I was just talking to my accountant yesterday
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:07.620]  because I don't really pay much attention to it. I thought, you know, Bloomberg called
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:11.220]  me up a couple times last few weeks asking how much money I make and how much it costs
[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:14.900]  to run things. And last time I checked, just bandwidth is half a million bucks a year.
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:17.700]  It's actually more than that now. And I thought, you know, I better go over and actually check
[01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:21.700]  some of the stuff. I haven't looked at about three or four months at my finances. And I
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:28.060]  will tell you this year, I'm set to take no money. Hiring crew and doing all this because
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:33.060]  I'm all in fighting the globalists that I am set this year. So far I've paid myself
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:36.740]  nothing and that was kind of my goal. But it's a good thing I'm paying myself nothing
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:42.220]  because we're breaking even. I mean, we're in there, folks. I scrounge to get the funds
[01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:47.100]  to run this operation. And I know the crew knows that as well, that this is a big historical
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:48.260]  thing happening here.
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:52.460]  And the money that comes into here, it was really hard to get. That's why my crew all
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:58.260]  worked so hard and it's so focused realizing the historical fight we're in. And just how
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:05.140]  big a deal it is that we've been able to develop this. So again, I wanna thank all of you out
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:10.820]  there for your support. And be sure and support us also and the message and yourself by supporting
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:15.340]  our local AM&FM affiliates, supporting their local sponsors or becoming a local sponsor
[01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:17.820]  locally and spreading the word.
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:22.500]  You can do that for free, folks. Tell people about infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. I
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:26.320]  wanna thank folks out there that also post our stories and promote them on their own
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:37.340]  news sites. Okay, Mark Dice on his YouTube channel and at markdice.com. Every week does
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:44.700]  these videos and we post them on infowars.com where he goes out and we've even gotten raw
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:48.580]  footage from him to use in films and I get to see it.
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:53.660]  And when he goes and shows say 15 people and 14 of them call for all guns to be confiscated
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:39:00.460]  and tea partiers to be arrested. He didn't talk to 100 people to get 14 of them to say
[01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:06.260]  that and only one person say no. That's what you get. When I sent Leanne McAdoo out to
[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:11.980]  say should we ban hydrogen monoxide that's water, we had I think it was nine people said
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:14.840]  ban it. One guy said he wouldn't sign the petition.
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:22.340]  One guy bragged that he had a degree in chemistry and but didn't know and said, yeah, let's
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:29.700]  ban our hydrogen monoxide. Now a globalist would see that and go, ah, food, dumb slaves,
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:34.740]  I'll manipulate them. A person that wants to have a future for humanity goes, man, we're
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:43.660]  in deep trouble. And Mark Dice went and did a video that we posted on Monday, Memorial
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:49.980]  Day out there in Oceanside by LA that made me physically ill because these people weren't
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:51.860]  just stupid he talked to.
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:56.580]  They were smiling, they were laughing, they don't care. And some of them said, I'm from
[01:39:56.580 --> 01:40:02.700]  Chicago, we're ruthless, we don't care about anybody. We're sinister, he uses some term
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:10.140]  like that. And what they are is craven, they're chicken. Anyways, I've been using the term
[01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:12.300]  that I'm craven but the point is that was a joke.
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:17.940]  They are craven and they're like, I don't care about anybody but me. And there's all
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:23.940]  these magazines about self and me and I'm getting ahead and I'm gonna screw somebody
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:28.500]  and I'm gonna. And people think that, they think hiding in their cubicle gets them ahead.
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:33.620]  They think screwing off is how they have success in the world. These people aren't even living.
[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:38.500]  And the globalists are like, yeah, see, they're lazy, they're stupid, they shouldn't even
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:39.500]  be alive.
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:44.220]  But here's the deal, I will not morally sign on to you being injected with cancer viruses
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:48.460]  and hydrofluoroelastic acid. Cuz the globalists did a lot of this to you with the culture
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:52.820]  and by giving you role models that are lazy and role models where the men are passive
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:41:01.500]  and stupid and weak because it is immoral and it makes my spirit cringe.
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:04.780]  But you need to know that because you think you're getting ahead because you care about
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:11.780]  no one but yourself, you're gonna die alone. You're a chump. But he talked to these people
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:16.780]  and two of them knew what Memorial Day was. And one guy looked like he was angry at Mark
[01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:20.700]  and he should have been, cuz he thought Mark was really saying Memorial Day is for surfers
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:22.940]  that have died.
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:30.580]  But we're gonna go to this clip because some people got mad at our crew when we went out
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:35.300]  and said let's have up to age three post-birth abortion. Some people with kids agreed to
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:39.660]  it. It's a woman's right to kill her kids up to age three. Yes, I agree with it. Some
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:41.080]  people got mad at our reporters.
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:46.440]  You should get mad when that type of evil's being pushed. None of us are safe. And I'm
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:51.320]  sick of Memorial Day being used as a pro-war police state holiday to sell tyranny as if
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:59.700]  it's patriotism. But at least the warmongers know what it is and think they're good people.
[01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:04.900]  There are a couple steps above folks that don't even know what Veterans Day or Memorial
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:08.860]  Day is.
[01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:12.060]  These are people that will watch the start of a new war like it's a, I've talked to liquor
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:15.980]  store owners. They say they sell more alcohol during a new war at the start of it than any
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:20.980]  other time. Same thing with pizza places. People go and they feel manly watching a bunch
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:26.940]  of people in third world garb running from smart bombs.
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:31.460]  And as long as a Peace Prize guy's doing it, it's beautiful. But I wanna hear just a few
[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:37.900]  minutes of this. The full clip is up on infowars.com. It's on Mark's YouTube and Facebook. But this
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:43.420]  is six minutes long. And in the middle, it gets to people that go, I don't care about
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:50.060]  anybody but me. And they smile at him like that's their possession, like that's their
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:51.940]  armor.
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:56.460]  And you will have your bank account taken. You will be injected with cancer viruses.
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:43:02.220]  You will be destroyed, you maggot. And these are the people that will vote to take our
[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:06.580]  guns. These are the people that will vote to take our money and give it to them. The
[01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:13.540]  globalists take 90%, they give 10% to the unwashed mass, who themselves are just as
[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:14.540]  immoral.
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:17.820]  In fact, they're more immoral than the New World Order. Cuz the New World Order knows
[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:23.260]  what they're doing is evil and distains you and is killing you in plain view. And then
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:30.420]  you're loving it and wanting to rob virtuous people. You are the scum of the earth. Let's
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:31.460]  go to the club.
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:43.980]  What is Memorial Day for? What is Memorial Day for? What's Memorial Day for? Wow, I never
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:53.940]  really thought about it. This guy is just ignorant. Memorial Day. I don't know. These
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:59.060]  people will not. What is Memorial Day for? Take a gold coin. I don't know. I'm not sure.
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:05.140]  They're gonna be barbecuing and celebrating. Yeah, look at my buddies. But you don't know
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:11.220]  what you're celebrating. No. No. It's fun to be ignorant. I don't even know. Don't even
[01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:16.380]  know. No. I don't know what Memorial Day is, man. It's the big holiday. It's like the kickoff
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:21.420]  to summer when you barbecue and get drunk and stuff. I don't think people from Chicago
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:25.980]  celebrate that thing, man. They don't celebrate Memorial Day? No, they're all ruthless, dude.
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:30.780]  Yeah, ruthless being an idiot. Yeah, I think so. Self-centered punk. Definitely, man. You
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:35.020]  know what I'm talking about, though, right? No. You don't know what Memorial Day is? No,
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:38.620]  I'm pretty drunk. The only way I know it's memorial is because I don't have work, and
[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:43.140]  that's all I care about, dude. So you don't care about anything else just not working
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:52.300]  on Memorial Day? Exactly. Nothing else matters that the reason for the day of all the now.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:58.740]  You don't even know what it means. I really don't care. You don't care at all. Memorial
[01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:03.740]  Day weekend, the day when we kind of- That's enough. It goes on and on. I wanna go to Mark
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:12.060]  Deist, media analyst, author. Mark, I haven't talked to you since a few weeks ago, but I
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.900]  would guess it's like all your other videos.
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:18.260]  You really show what you found. You didn't go edit this, correct? Cuz you said that's
[01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:25.320]  your policy, or am I wrong? I mean, how shocking is this that they tell you, I am proud that
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:29.920]  I only care about myself. Don't they know that then no one's gonna care about them?
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:38.580]  No one's gonna come to their aid. There's no humanity, no camaraderie, no fealty, no
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:44.980]  kinship. These people are not alive, and the New World Order is already killing them, and
[01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:51.100]  no one's gonna care about them as they're dying from the hydrofluorosolic acid.
[01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:55.820]  This video's seven minutes long. It could have been 13 minutes long. I had to leave
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:46:01.220]  a lot of people out because it just gets redundant. Even at seven minutes, it's too long. But
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:06.600]  what's even worse than them not knowing is them not caring. You could just see the absolute
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:15.640]  shameful selfishness that these just ignorant, illuminati brainwashed buffoons have become
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:17.500]  victims of, essentially.
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:21.580]  And I'm glad that I got to work with your crew a few weeks ago. They came out to Oceanside.
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:27.280]  We shot a petition video, and I showed them, and I'm glad that they got to see it for their
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:32.000]  own eyes, that these videos can be shot in minutes. I mean, it takes me longer to find
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:37.100]  a parking spot and walk to the beach and get my camera set up than it does to actually
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:38.860]  shoot these videos.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:43.540]  And I don't know if this is just Southern California. Maybe the zombie plague is sort
[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:48.540]  of focused here. But I have a sneaking suspicion, judging from the comments in the video and
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:52.940]  the feedback that I get, that these kinds of people are all over the country, if not
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:55.100]  the world.
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:59.900]  Mark, what about the lady? I was telling the guys to queue up the part where the woman
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:04.740]  in pink is, you start saying, this is the Memorial Day for the surfers that have died.
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:13.780]  And the woman's like, yes, I knew some of the surfers in Hawaii. And it's just so creepy.
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:18.780]  I insinuated different reasons for Memorial Day that was to celebrate the signing of the
[01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:22.340]  Declaration of Independence. And I'm just name dropping people that have nothing to
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:23.340]  do with it.
[01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:27.700]  John Wilkes Booth, Jack Lemmon. I think I added out the point when I mentioned Jesse
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:34.500]  Ventura being a founding father. And it goes right over their heads. And some of the people
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:38.460]  in the feedback and in the emails, the tweets that I've gotten, think that I'm the ignorant
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:40.940]  one because they just didn't get it.
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:45.360]  And they thought that I believe that Memorial Day was to celebrate the surfers or was to
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.620]  celebrate the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:50.980]  Yeah, they don't get satire. But expanding on this, whenever you're talking to these
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:57.180]  people, whenever you're sitting there, you say to the one arrogant punk, hey, zombie,
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.260]  what did he say when you said zombie to his face?
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:03.020]  Well, he just walked away like a little coward. And this was the kid that just said, I just
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:06.940]  don't care what it's for. Nothing matters. I just got the day off, man. Let's just go
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:11.260]  and get drunk and party. And you've seen some of these videos that I've done over the weeks.
[01:48:11.260 --> 01:48:15.860]  And each week I try to just push the envelope further and further and further.
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:20.260]  There's only one crazy idea that I had that people wouldn't go along with. And a couple
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:26.100]  people did. It just took too long. But these videos can be shot in 20 minutes, man. Society
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:31.340]  has lost touch with reality so much. I don't know if you're aware that the Animal Planet
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:38.340]  aired a show over the weekend about mermaids, a science fiction, science fantasy mockumentary
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:40.420]  titled Mermaids a Body Found.
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:44.580]  And people took to Twitter, countless people took to Twitter and thought that a body of
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:51.080]  a mermaid was found. They just couldn't tell the fake, cheesy actors and reenactments on
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:57.660]  an Animal Planet show about mermaids. That's how out of touch. The reason for this is because
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:00.460]  people don't want to know.
[01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:06.700]  The brain will categorize and prioritize information. If you want to remember something, your brain
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:12.500]  will put a priority on that. You meet a beautiful girl, hey, that's Jennifer. I need to remember
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:19.020]  that. So your brain will remember. These people don't want to remember. Information sits in
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:22.540]  their short term memory and gets discarded.
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:29.500]  It's a culture of loving ignorance. These celebrity worshiping absolute scumbags that
[01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:33.980]  we see now parading is a whole other issue, posing as Illuminati members themselves.
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:38.140]  Yeah, we're gonna talk about that coming up. We'll put this on screen for Infowars.com
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:43.940]  readers. We have your video posted. General Public believes mermaid mockumentary was real.
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:48.320]  And here's my issue. I'm not gonna join the global list and try to nerve gas and bio weapon
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:49.320]  these zombies.
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:52.580]  A lot of them are brain damaged from that. They've been brought up by the television
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:58.500]  to be like this, but they do not have a right to take my guns and team up with the government
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:03.060]  to take my money so they could sit around on their fat butts. And that's the thing.
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:06.720]  These people are dangerous. I mean, how many questionnaires have you done where they say
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:09.980]  arrest gun owners, put us in FEMA camps?
[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:13.460]  All I needed to do for much of the audience may be familiar for those who aren't. I got
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:18.920]  people to sign a petition to ban repeal the Second Amendment, confiscate all guns door
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:23.980]  to door using the military since we have lists of all the registered weapons. All I needed
[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:26.380]  to do was mention the key words.
[01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:30.680]  Will you support Obama and sign our petition? That's why you said we want a Nazi takeover
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:35.220]  of America fascism for Obama and what did they say?
[01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:37.980]  Sounded good. It just goes right over their head. Anything to support Obama. And then
[01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:42.300]  the guy goes, you go, yeah, we want the Nazis to take over confiscate the guns and the guy
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:45.780]  goes, you don't tell me, buddy, I understand. As long as you could say we're going to put
[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:52.020]  babies in woodchippers for Obama, they'd say, sure. I mean, Mark Dies is our guest. And
[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:56.700]  we've gone out in Austin and they're almost as bad if you go to the trendy liberal areas.
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:02.060]  These are not liberals. These are people begging for the New World Order to kill them.
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:06.460]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for all of
[01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:11.560]  us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:16.960]  your liberty, freedom and security. And that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:22.500]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:27.340]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the most effective way
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:32.100]  you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation. The do it
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:38.420]  yourself public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer be provided.
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:43.100]  This along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations and additional government
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:49.260]  control of food supplies and resources says food is the ultimate priority. E Foods Direct

[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:38.140]  counterfeit then carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:42.260]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:45.700]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:50.260]  army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:19.500]  Children's Network launches transsexual superhero show. That's Breitbart. We have that article
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:26.620]  linked up on Infowars.com. Nothing says child appropriate material quite like gender bending
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:35.060]  underage superheroes. At least that's the theory over at the L.A. Times. The network
[01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:42.180]  co-owned by Discovery and Hasbro is trotting out a show targeting preteens, teaching them
[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:47.580]  how to be transsexuals. Folks, that's called pedophilia. They always try to make it like,
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:54.820]  oh, you're a square. You're anti gay or anti. You know what? Give me a break. That stuff's
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:58.740]  been going on since the beginning of history. I don't even get into it. Keep your hands
[01:54:58.740 --> 01:55:04.860]  away from the kids, whether you're a heterosexual, a homosexual, a transgender or whatever it
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:05.860]  is.
[01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:12.380]  OK, OK, I am. Keep. That's the thing with these degenerate globalist. It's always about
[01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:18.820]  what can they get away with. That's like Jocelyn Elders. We've got to reach down and teach
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:25.600]  the kindergartner how to masturbate. Help them masturbate. I mean, I can play these
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:32.280]  clips for you. These are fruitcakes, man. Kids are supposed to be chasing butterflies
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:33.280]  around outside.
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:38.420]  They're supposed to be puppy dogs, supposed to be painting. They're supposed to be fishing,
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:44.900]  not worried about sex till they hit puberty. And then they're taught the mechanics of it.
[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:50.260]  And you can catch diseases. And you want to marry somebody who's nice and who's successful,
[01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:58.220]  not, hey, you're five years old. I'm a big fat weirdo lady in a nurse's outfit. I'm here
[01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:03.300]  to teach you how to masturbate.
[01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:09.540]  This planet is run by crazy people. Meanwhile, it came out in the Seattle Post intelligence
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:12.820]  are going to keep Mark dies a little bit in the next hour, and we're getting Luke Rudowski
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:18.900]  on. They are now teaching all that stuff in the schools and the FBI is running child porn
[01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:19.900]  sites.
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:25.660]  To then catch all the idiots that go to it when they know the UN and Dyncor and all these
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:32.740]  big corporations have been caught running, kidnapped actual kids. Look it up. Chicago
[01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:37.180]  Tribune, you name it. I mean, this is incredible. It's like they create Al-Qaeda and then take
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:38.540]  our liberties because of it.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:44.820]  Meanwhile, they've got pedophilia on TV. That's what that is. That's pervs trying to mess
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:51.180]  with your kid's head. Let's go to Mark dies. Mark, we're gonna break here in a minute.
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:54.660]  I'll be staying with us a few more minutes. But you were talking about this and I have
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:57:00.260]  this clip ready in a minute of the lady saying, yeah, Memorial Day for the servers that died.
[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:06.700]  What is wrong with these people? I mean, do you get my point of distaining them?
[01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:11.200]  You can see the almost hatred in my face. People ask how I can keep a straight face
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:15.020]  and it's because I don't really think it's funny. I really am looking at them with just
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:20.740]  utter disgust. And I think it's pretty clear in my videos. Sometimes I'll just start laughing
[01:57:20.740 --> 01:57:21.740]  in their face.
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:28.180]  I haven't included a lot of those. But these people, I insinuate that it's to celebrate
[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:33.280]  and memorialize the fallen surfing legends who have popularized the sport. And a light
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:39.180]  bulb just doesn't go off in their head in most of them. I mean, I am just demonstrating
[01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:45.900]  what corrupt politicians can do by pretending to know what they're talking about and manipulating
[01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:46.900]  people.
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:51.380]  And through just the power of suggestion, I get them to sign because some of them may
[01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:54.560]  start thinking about it and may have a light bulb go off in their head when I'm getting
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:59.440]  people to sign these crazy petitions on the Man on the Street Monday videos. But I simply
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:04.100]  just keep pointing to this area where the signature is and I just keep repeating them
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:05.860]  comically.
[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:08.500]  Just sign here, please. Just put your name there, please.
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:12.180]  And then you say more obnoxious stuff like to help Obama, we're gonna have Nazi rule
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:18.300]  and arrest the Tea Party. You're just like, really, Nazi rule for Obama? And yeah.
[01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:22.720]  As they're signing it, I'm just to make the point clear, to show that this is just going
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:26.700]  right over their head. You can see in the videos. I just keep repeating myself. Just
[01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:30.340]  a signature name here. We're going to play another clip of that. We're back in one minute.
[01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:34.700]  Stay there, Mark. Mark Dice of MarkDice.com. I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com. Don't forget

[01:59:57.460 --> 02:00:11.420]  GCN Radio Network. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers?
[02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:19.700]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin,
[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:30.460]  Texas, Alex Jones. Mark Dyches is our guest. I'm Alex Jones,
[02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:36.220]  your host. What we're illustrating here is just how... Well, the IQs have dropped about
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:45.860]  20%. Look up those numbers. Just the hydrofluorosolic acid. But here is the LA Times. I've got it
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:51.580]  punched up on my other computer over here for TV viewers. Gun crime has plunged, but
[02:00:51.580 --> 02:01:00.180]  Americans think it's up, study says. And that's what the establishment does. 69% drop in wounding
[02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:08.500]  shootings. 49% drop in overall violent crime, aggravated crime. 39% drop in fatality shootings
[02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:11.940]  since 1992, Justice Department numbers. We told you this before the Justice Department
[02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:17.980]  did a report a few months later. But it doesn't matter because gun owners are responsible
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:21.700]  for Sandy Hook because mainstream media said so.
[02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:26.320]  But what's gonna happen, Mark Dyches, media analyst in your view, as a larger minority
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:33.140]  becomes close to a majority who's aware versus the zombies that the Pentagon even trains
[02:01:33.140 --> 02:01:40.540]  against the public scripting us as zombies. As they just want their handouts, they really
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:45.260]  are the enemy. Because they're gonna be used by the offshore globalists to overrun us.
[02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:49.580]  And they would literally kill us if it meant they got some time off.
[02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:53.740]  I do see some positive news here. More and more people are waking up and we have Bono
[02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:59.080]  and Richard Branson dropping the Illuminati, name dropping the Illuminati and Matt Damon's
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:04.580]  campaign for water filtration program in third world countries. And the video on YouTube
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:11.940]  has probably a 60 or 70% thumbs down rate. Most of the comments are people slamming the
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:12.940]  Illuminati.
[02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:19.100]  You have these singing serpents, there's just satanic trash like Kesha, one of the most
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:26.100]  popular singing pop stars today, who puts out a video with just clear satanic Illuminati
[02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:31.660]  symbolism. And while a lot of her fans love her and literally worship this, just bop them
[02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:32.660]  in a bimbo.
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:36.220]  They're hitting nine year old girls and people put her in front of it.
[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:43.140]  This girl puts satanic pentagrams on her Facebook page. She drinks allegedly pee on her show
[02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:50.540]  on MTV. Her music videos have her just having orgies in churches with Illuminati all seeing
[02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:51.540]  eyes symbolism.
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:53.380]  And she wears little kid's teeth around her neck.
[02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:59.120]  Yes, she asked her fans, many of which are preteens, to mail in their baby teeth to her.
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:02.780]  And over 1,000 people sent her their teeth.
[02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:08.740]  She had it sewn into a bra and a headdress. And she says that it's one of her most prized
[02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:09.740]  possessions.
[02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:15.480]  Yeah, you know, I was reading about this top abortion doctor that testified before Congress
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:20.540]  that he had an epiphany when his teenage daughter died in a car wreck that killing all the kids
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:21.980]  had come back on him.
[02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:26.860]  And I hope Kesha and all these people know they're going to have cursed lives. You don't
[02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:31.820]  do this type of stuff to kids on purpose and not get absolutely torn into a thousand pieces
[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:32.820]  by God.
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:39.080]  Yeah, you know, we may not be able to see the effects of selling their soul, but I have
[02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:42.500]  a hard time believing that these people even could sleep at night and you could see the
[02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:46.060]  pain and the torment in their face.
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:48.300]  There's still time for them to turn back and repent.
[02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:54.340]  Lady Gaga, it's leaked, is quote attacked by ghosts and demons and has had people sleep
[02:03:54.340 --> 02:03:56.580]  in the room with her.
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:04:03.380]  Kesha has drank fake blood out of a fake animal heart on stage. Like I said on her MTV show,
[02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:08.620]  she drank what appeared to be urine because, you know, you are what you eat, Kesha. So
[02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:14.300]  I mean, you are urine. I mean, the mainstream media, mainstream music, it is a urine stream.
[02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:16.100]  So I mean, it's very fitting, very symbolic.
[02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:21.580]  But Aleister Crowley, as you know, the infamous Satanist of the wickedest man alive, he wrote
[02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:26.700]  instructions in his book, Magic in Theory and Practice, which I have, I bought to verify
[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:31.820]  these claims. He wrote in there that if you murder children, you get satanic power. And
[02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:36.900]  then we have Jay-Z, you know, one of the most popular, most wealthy rappers of the day,
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:43.320]  friends with Obama, campaigning for Obama, appearing in Obama campaign ads and on stage
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:46.440]  as a hype man for Obama during the campaign.
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:50.780]  Just wearing an Aleister Crowley sweatshirt. Oh yeah, do what thou wilt. And that's not
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:55.340]  a photoshopped image, as you know, that's a still image from a behind the scenes making
[02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:56.340]  of the video with Rihanna.
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:05:02.140]  Hey, I want to talk more about this with Luke Rudowski.
[02:05:02.140 --> 02:05:06.540]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for all of
[02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:11.640]  us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:17.020]  your liberty, freedom and security. And that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:22.560]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:27.400]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the most effective way
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:32.180]  you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation. The do it
[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:38.500]  yourself public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer be provided.
[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:43.160]  This along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations and additional government
[02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:49.340]  control of food supplies and resources says food is the ultimate priority. E Foods Direct
[02:05:49.340 --> 02:05:56.100]  will provide free shipping on all food orders until further notice. Call 800-409-5633 or

[02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:28.020]  to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones. Really that simple. What is the truth?
[02:08:28.020 --> 02:08:34.960]  Speaking of the truth is really paramount. And we have a bunch of pro death sadists and
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:41.900]  psychopaths running the new world order. They're selling anti-family, anti-male, anti-woman,
[02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:50.380]  anti-child self-mutilation and destruction so the society will become infected with a
[02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:57.260]  death lust so that they will roll over and die so the globalist can inherit the earth.
[02:08:57.260 --> 02:09:01.420]  But the globalist won't inherit the earth. They're not gonna stop this instinct towards
[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:06.860]  death and destruction once they have control. As the government arms to the teeth but wants
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:12.240]  our guns. Media analyst Mark Dice is with us. I wanna play one more clip from the reason
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:17.900]  I got him on out there in Oceanside, California, talking to people saying, do you know what
[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:18.900]  Memorial Day is?
[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:27.240]  And they said, no. All of them, but one guy. Well, do you know what it stands for? It stands
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:34.940]  for surfer day, the surfers we've lost. I love surfers. And then they could quote surfer's
[02:09:34.940 --> 02:09:43.780]  names just totally mindless like the world is just something they're in and they're spectators.
[02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:50.580]  This is a recipe for enslavement. When you have a people that act like lobotomized sheep,
[02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:54.420]  you will be overrun by wolves. Let's go to that clip.
[02:09:54.420 --> 02:09:59.700]  Memorial Day weekend, the weekend when we look back on the fallen surfing legends, those
[02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:06.620]  who have drowned and died to make the sport popular. Are you doing anything special to
[02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:11.460]  commemorate the loss of the surfing legends?
[02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:16.860]  Not me personally, but I have family who live in Hawaii who knows who knew some of those
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:25.100]  legends, Eddie Aikau. I believe there was another legendary surfer that died at Mavericks
[02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:28.740]  that my brother-in-law knows. They have a memorial there.
[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:33.460]  Are you going to be saying a prayer for them on Memorial Day to kind of commemorate their
[02:10:33.460 --> 02:10:36.540]  loss and the popularization of the sport?
[02:10:36.540 --> 02:10:39.180]  I think that's a great idea. I think we all should.
[02:10:39.180 --> 02:10:45.260]  Are you going to be doing anything to kind of commemorate the fallen surfing legends
[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:50.980]  and those who have popularized the surfing sport for Memorial Day?
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:52.580]  No, not really, man.
[02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:55.020]  You're not a big surfer or?
[02:10:55.020 --> 02:11:00.180]  Not really. I just usually kick it, you know?
[02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:03.100]  What is the point of Memorial Day though?
[02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:07.700]  I don't really know, man. I mean, I really don't care. Like, I mean, for me, it's just
[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:09.700]  another bogus holiday.
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:11.340]  Just another bogus holiday.
[02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:12.340]  All right, there you go.
[02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:13.700]  What's the purpose of Memorial Day?
[02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:18.700]  It goes on and on with all these hipster wannabe trendies. And again, when these guys wave
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:23.420]  their rights to the police and the courts, it sets a precedent. These people will vote
[02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:27.080]  to take all your guns. They will vote to take every dime you've got, and they are taking
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:28.080]  over the country.
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:35.740]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, all that same satisfied demonic smile of I'm just kicking
[02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:41.100]  it. I'm ruthless. I don't care about nobody but me. Well, you know what? Nobody cares
[02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:44.700]  about you either, scum.
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:48.180]  And that's what I told Piers Morgan. I said, just cuz you got a bunch of lemmings out there
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:51.600]  that wanna be slaves, buddy, doesn't mean that gives you a right to make me a slave.
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:56.380]  You got that, Jack? I see you. I know what you are, and I'm done. I wanna go to Luke
[02:11:56.380 --> 02:12:01.660]  Radowski here. These two are mutual friends who confronted Kissinger devastatingly and
[02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:03.180]  told him you're a mass murderer.
[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:08.380]  We're gonna cue that up. And Kissinger's like, get lost, kid. I rule everything with this
[02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:14.140]  fake German accent or whatever. But media analyst Mark Dice, you were also, before he
[02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:20.700]  came back, you were getting into the devil worship they're selling. And this isn't like
[02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:24.980]  people in the 80s trying to sell rock albums.
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:32.420]  This is like really real satanic rituals in all these shows, Jay-Z, Aleister Crowley shirts,
[02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:38.380]  songs about killing children. And you have to understand, folks, the big globalist, they've
[02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:41.940]  been caught over and over again. They are involved in this. And the government will
[02:12:41.940 --> 02:12:44.300]  cover it up when your kids get disappeared.
[02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:47.760]  It won't be on the news when your kid gets disappeared. It'll only be if it's a real
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:52.500]  kidnapping by a low level nobody, then they'll be on the news trying to save your kid. Go
[02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:53.500]  ahead.
[02:12:53.500 --> 02:12:58.880]  Yeah, and a final point about the Memorial Day videos. It's not just to show these people
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:03.500]  to make fun of them. It's to show how far down the toilet society has gone, but also
[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:07.500]  to sort of send up a warning flag so that hopefully the people who are posting these
[02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:12.960]  videos on their Facebook pages and sharing them, much of their friends I'm sure are people
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:14.540]  just like the ones in the video.
[02:13:14.540 --> 02:13:20.280]  So hopefully that will show a reflection back on them so that they can sort of reassess
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:27.500]  their own priorities. But this culture, this Illuminati wannabe satanic devil worshiping
[02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:35.700]  pop star fad has gotten so out of control. We have supposedly family friendly pop stars
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:41.180]  and these family friendly shows like the Today Show, Good Morning America, promoting these
[02:13:41.180 --> 02:13:49.700]  pop stars who are then covertly and in many cases overtly promoting literal Satanism and
[02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:55.400]  making people think that the Illuminati is cool or to muddy the water and make the mainstream
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:14:00.460]  mentally enslaved music watching and listening morons believe that the Illuminati is not
[02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:05.680]  a group of international billionaire banksters, the Federal Reserve fraudsters.
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:12.260]  But it's just a group of famous musicians. I mean, we have a case of a kid in Virginia
[02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:18.300]  who tried to kill his friend. He shot him thinking that that was an Illuminati sacrifice.
[02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:22.820]  This is what he told the police, that it was his sacrifice to the Illuminati. This is a
[02:14:22.820 --> 02:14:24.260]  kid who's like 26 years old.
[02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:28.380]  They have murders all the time that are satanic and they tell the police, leave that out of
[02:14:28.380 --> 02:14:35.780]  the report. I mean, the night stalker, most of these son of Sam, they're all devil worshipers.
[02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:39.620]  Yeah, it's the only explanation that is plausible.
[02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:47.580]  Aris Kleibold, the reported patsy shooter at Sandy Hook, all devil worshipers.
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:52.220]  There was a 10 year old, a 10 or 11 year old, a fifth grader in Sacramento just a few weeks
[02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:58.300]  ago that stood up in the middle of class and told the teacher that she's in the Illuminati
[02:14:58.300 --> 02:15:04.020]  and she's going to sacrifice her fellow students and kill them for Satan. And I would be willing
[02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:05.660]  to bet she's a Kesha fan.
[02:15:05.660 --> 02:15:10.380]  I would be willing to bet that this is one of the kids that sent Kesha her teeth, that's
[02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:13.580]  watching Kesha literally on the Today Show.
[02:15:13.580 --> 02:15:19.100]  And the bigger issue is parents are turning their children over to him. I'm sorry, finish
[02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:21.200]  your point and we're gonna jump to Luke Rudowski.
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:25.460]  The parents are the ones paying for the tickets to the concert and driving them there. And
[02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:30.200]  final point, this is a girl when she's on the Today Show performing, wears an upside
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:36.660]  down crucifix on her leotard. Not her typical, usual Illuminati symbolism because it'd be
[02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:41.580]  a little too blatant on the Today Show, a supposed family friendly show.
[02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:46.280]  But there she is, I did a whole video about this, wearing an upside down crucifix on her
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:51.820]  leotard, a symbol, a satanic symbol sort of reversing everything that is Christian or
[02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:56.180]  that is good, perverting everything as is their agenda.
[02:15:56.180 --> 02:16:00.020]  Well, I'll tell you, people that get decadent always beg to be destroyed and all these people
[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:04.500]  begging for it. You're already being destroyed by the fluoride, the GMO, all of it. But those
[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:08.180]  of us that don't wanna be part of your evil, we're not on some high horse either.
[02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:12.740]  In fact, a lot of us actually have seen the real dark side, light years ahead of where
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:17.740]  you evil people think you've gone and we know it's not a place we wanna go. It's just a
[02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:23.700]  bunch of brain dead morons who think they're getting power from darkness and all they're
[02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:25.580]  going to get is destroyed.
[02:16:25.580 --> 02:16:31.460]  Mark, before I shift gears into Henry Kissinger and Luke Rudowski's confrontation with him,
[02:16:31.460 --> 02:16:34.460]  can you do an Alex Jones stuttering invitation for us?
[02:16:34.460 --> 02:16:43.620]  We're gonna go Luke Rudowski here, but I'm gonna cover the news. I'm gonna get your phone
[02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:45.660]  calls here in just a second. But they're gonna kill you and your family.
[02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:51.740]  Yeah, they've only been holding, let me see, Chris is only holding an hour and 43 minutes.
[02:16:51.740 --> 02:16:54.540]  You can hold some more.
[02:16:54.540 --> 02:17:01.060]  Yeah, I know some of the audience may know that I've done some pretty brutal satire and
[02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:02.060]  criticism of you.
[02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:06.060]  That's why I'm having you on. It's really, I enjoy it.
[02:17:06.060 --> 02:17:10.460]  Well, I appreciate, it really says a lot about your character, the ability that you can turn
[02:17:10.460 --> 02:17:15.020]  the other cheek is we can still have me on. I appreciate that you'd see the value in my
[02:17:15.020 --> 02:17:16.020]  work.
[02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:21.140]  I do see the value, but you don't understand. It's very sick, but I don't like listening
[02:17:21.140 --> 02:17:26.820]  to my own show and I like myself but also dislike myself. So you do a good imitation
[02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:31.220]  Mark. I mean, I could start paying you to attack me. How's that sound?
[02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:35.580]  There are the conspiracy theorists out there that believe that my criticism of you was
[02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:42.460]  just a planned WWF promotion to build up. Some of these people see a conspiracy around
[02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:45.740]  every corner. It's entertaining, but it is sad at the same time.
[02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:50.220]  No, no, there's big general conspiracies against the dumbed down mass. There's not a lot of
[02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:57.300]  little subterfuges out there behind the scenes. But I wanna bring Luke Rudowski up here. Let's
[02:17:57.300 --> 02:18:01.420]  play this clip of him, just a short clip. We already played it last hour, the whole
[02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:06.340]  thing. Confronting Hare Kissinger when he was getting this Freedom Award. Here it is.
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:12.140]  Hi, Mr. Kissinger. It's a pleasure. How you doing? I just wanted to know, what do you
[02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:16.580]  mean when you said illegal we do immediately, unconstitutional takes a little longer, the
[02:18:16.580 --> 02:18:19.820]  WikiLeaks document. What do you mean by that?
[02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:23.580]  Okay, come on. No, no, no. I mean, it came out WikiLeaks.
[02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:28.500]  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of stuff on it. Do you know the agenda of the Bilderberg?
[02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:31.820]  What are you doing this for? I'm here covering this event. Just wanted
[02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:37.100]  to talk to you. We are change and we want to know maybe what the agenda of the Bilderberg
[02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:39.300]  group meeting is going to be in a couple of days. Do you know?
[02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:44.460]  Get lost, please. How does it feel winning the Freedom Award
[02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:50.620]  when you're wanted as a mass murderer and wanted in many countries and butchered millions
[02:18:50.620 --> 02:18:58.500]  of people. How does it feel? You know a lie. You self serving coward get lost.
[02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:02.820]  I'm not a coward. You know this Freedom Award's a lie and you're wanted for mass murder in
[02:19:02.820 --> 02:19:10.900]  different countries. You know it's a lie. Good job, Luke. That's wearechange.org and
[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:14.860]  he's with us right now joining us from Washington DC.
[02:19:14.860 --> 02:19:22.940]  Luke, I mean, do you know what a what Henry Kissinger's grave and his coffin are called?
[02:19:22.940 --> 02:19:28.300]  They're called the latrine. And I love how he calls you a coward when he's a coward.
[02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:34.300]  He calls you self serving when he's self serving. This is a known criminal dirtbag that said
[02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:40.380]  cut food off the third world to starve and cause wars. This is a war criminal.
[02:19:40.380 --> 02:19:44.980]  Luke Rudowski, we salute you for what you've done.
[02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:50.620]  It seems like he's bringing out his qualities onto me. The other time I confronted him,
[02:19:50.620 --> 02:19:54.660]  he called me a sick person and that I should go to hell, which is pretty interesting coming
[02:19:54.660 --> 02:20:00.300]  from that perspective. But Kissinger, I think he already knows who I am. We got him a third
[02:20:00.300 --> 02:20:04.660]  time. We actually made a video detailing every step of the way of how we're actually able
[02:20:04.660 --> 02:20:09.180]  to do this on our YouTube channel. You just go to youtube.com for slash we are changed
[02:20:09.180 --> 02:20:14.540]  and you can see the behind the scenes shenanigans that go on with these people like David Petraeus,
[02:20:14.540 --> 02:20:20.060]  David Tove and Henry Kissinger making up fake awards so they could kiss each other and pat
[02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:24.220]  each other on the back and promote themselves and empower themselves. It was pretty much
[02:20:24.220 --> 02:20:28.940]  a side show. It's a fake award that they're giving to each other. It just shows how delusional
[02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:34.300]  these people are. And the award was called the Intrepid Freedom Award. It was giving
[02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:38.700]  it was given to Henry Kissinger for so-called promoting democracy. I mean, it just doesn't
[02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:44.020]  get any more Orwellian than it is. No, but that's like Obama being given a peace prize.
[02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:48.860]  All it did was totally discredit the peace prize. Yeah, but this is not even like the
[02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:53.380]  peace prize. This is like a made up award that they just got it. Yeah. And we were able
[02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:58.260]  to go in there. The press press relations people were extremely stringent. They told
[02:20:58.260 --> 02:21:02.460]  us they were always with us. They were always watching us. They told us no interview. You
[02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:06.900]  can't ask any questions. You're just here to take pictures and videos. And that's that's
[02:21:06.900 --> 02:21:11.180]  sad because this shows you what journalism has become. There were other journalists there.
[02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:18.860]  It's not journalism. You repeat what comes out of the Henry Kissinger's proboscis. Yeah,
[02:21:18.860 --> 02:21:24.780]  mainstream media has become public relation for the establishment, for the elite. They're
[02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:29.780]  not there asking hard, legitimate questions. They're not even trying to find a way to actually
[02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:34.420]  go around the different rules and security that they set up. They're just complying with
[02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:38.700]  what it has to be. And what we're trying to change here at We Are Change is the whole
[02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:44.100]  perspective of how we should act. We should act like we are the mainstream media.
[02:21:44.100 --> 02:21:49.900]  Yeah, people shouldn't act sycophantic towards these war criminals. Let's get Mark Dyson's
[02:21:49.900 --> 02:21:55.780]  take on this. You know, Mark, I admire the work you do with Man on the Street. And I
[02:21:55.780 --> 02:21:59.260]  also admire, you know, the work Luke's doing confronting these people. That's something
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:04.140]  I've been doing for 18 years. And I'm working on getting my reporters to go out and do because
[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:08.380]  it just really shows what real questions do.
[02:22:08.380 --> 02:22:13.260]  And I mean, Kissinger really sounded pathetic there. What do you think of that?
[02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:17.780]  Luke is a master. I mean, Luke has tracked these criminals down and asked the real questions
[02:22:17.780 --> 02:22:22.700]  that no journalist will dare ask because they don't want to lose access to these figures.
[02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:28.480]  They don't want to get shamed and demoted by their Operation Mockingbird editors. And
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:33.660]  just a testament of the quality and the effectiveness of Luke's work is the fact that when Rand
[02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:40.040]  Paul was giving his historic was a 13 hour filibuster about the drone strikes, he referenced
[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:45.660]  one of Luke's videos didn't give Luke credit, but he mentioned a soundbite, an answer that
[02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:51.660]  Luke got from Robert Gibbs, Obama's former press secretary, about how people should just
[02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:56.140]  be a better father if they're going to be, you know, have their children killed by drone
[02:22:56.140 --> 02:22:57.140]  strikes.
[02:22:57.140 --> 02:23:04.300]  I predict, I hope that someday Luke will get an award for his journalism from once we can
[02:23:04.300 --> 02:23:11.420]  shift the culture. Luke has done such good work. He's somebody who deserves these prestigious
[02:23:11.420 --> 02:23:17.820]  awards, not some war criminal Henry Kissinger given this Orwellian award for something completely
[02:23:17.820 --> 02:23:20.780]  counter to everything that he stands for.
[02:23:20.780 --> 02:23:26.180]  Absolutely. Well said. And again, holding up activists that go out and do things. We
[02:23:26.180 --> 02:23:33.380]  are the future. And citizen journalism is what scares them. And people out there listening
[02:23:33.380 --> 02:23:37.620]  will call me up and go, is it all right if I reference one of your articles in my book?
[02:23:37.620 --> 02:23:42.300]  And I'm like, number one, that's just referencing. You have a right to do that. And I'm like,
[02:23:42.300 --> 02:23:46.780]  or Alex, I want you to help me plan going to city council asking questions. Just do
[02:23:46.780 --> 02:23:47.780]  it.
[02:23:47.780 --> 02:23:53.140]  It's like the Nike slogan. You know, just stop using Chinese sweatshop labor, Foxconn.
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:57.820]  But you know, to be serious, we've got to simply take action. Luke, what else do we
[02:23:57.820 --> 02:24:03.300]  not see that's going on behind the scenes? I mean, what was it like being close to Henry
[02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:10.180]  Kissinger? Because I've heard of smell-o-vision, but I almost like smell the smell of like
[02:24:10.180 --> 02:24:15.620]  a dead animal when looking at Kissinger up close.
[02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:22.580]  And he looked also like he was in like a meatloaf that had been left outside for a week. I mean,
[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:29.300]  he reeked of failure and of like the maw of hell's tongue lapping out to embrace him in
[02:24:29.300 --> 02:24:33.260]  the ninth circle of Dante's Inferno.
[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:37.860]  Someone said on YouTube that he looks like Mr. Potato Head. And I do have to say there
[02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:41.300]  is a very good comparison if you put up the two pictures next to each other.
[02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:43.300]  It's super Mr. Mass Murdered. I'm sorry.
[02:24:43.300 --> 02:24:49.420]  It was definitely surreal because everybody was just kissing up to him. Everybody was
[02:24:49.420 --> 02:24:53.660]  just saying how great of a person he was. You know, when I walked up to him, everybody
[02:24:53.660 --> 02:24:59.100]  was afraid even to just come up and talk to him. He had food all over his shirt. He couldn't
[02:24:59.100 --> 02:25:03.540]  even eat right, which is pretty pretty telling. But what was really
[02:25:03.540 --> 02:25:07.180]  He's a degenerate slob, literally going to hell. Sorry.
[02:25:07.180 --> 02:25:11.460]  Yeah. I mean, what was really interesting is the amount of control the press relations
[02:25:11.460 --> 02:25:14.820]  people really had. I mean, it just it was just thickening being there.
[02:25:14.820 --> 02:25:17.820]  But at the end of the day, they didn't have control because you just ran their blockade
[02:25:17.820 --> 02:25:21.100]  and got the question in. Exactly. And if there's a will, there's a
[02:25:21.100 --> 02:25:25.060]  way. And that's why what I want to tell people out there, you know, don't ask for permission.
[02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:29.580]  Just go out there, go do it. What I'm working on right now is talking to certain individuals
[02:25:29.580 --> 02:25:34.020]  and I'm trying to teach them every aspect of journalism, every aspect of covering these
[02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:38.140]  events. And I'm trying to prop up as many individual people as I can. And if people
[02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:41.500]  want to get involved, I'm also going to be traveling through Europe. If you could build
[02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:45.460]  up some journalists there, that would be amazing. But people could hit me off on my Twitter,
[02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:49.260]  just look at we are change on Twitter. And then I want to get in contact with as many
[02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:52.860]  individuals as I can. So we get it. So I could actually sit down
[02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:56.900]  one on one with them, teach them how to be the change that they want to see in this world,
[02:25:56.900 --> 02:26:02.060]  teach them how to do real journalism and prop them up and push them up. And hopefully there
[02:26:02.060 --> 02:26:05.620]  won't be just two or three people asking hard questions. There'll be, you know, we'll be
[02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:09.740]  able to totally take over the mainstream. Everywhere these globalists go, we've got
[02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:14.700]  to be there confronting them. And as the mainstream media rots away and turns into bones like
[02:26:14.700 --> 02:26:19.780]  the dinosaurs, we are rising. And that's why we're at this critical historical juncture.
[02:26:19.780 --> 02:26:23.700]  Because there is a big dumbed down mass that's getting more divorced from reality. But there's
[02:26:23.700 --> 02:26:29.500]  also a mass getting more informed every day. Take the IRS scandal, all these other scandals.
[02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:34.820]  Our credibility is just shooting straight up right now. Luke, are you seeing the awakening
[02:26:34.820 --> 02:26:40.060]  I'm seeing? I definitely am. And the potential of anything
[02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:44.700]  that could happen is right within our grasp. It's right within our hands. It's just up
[02:26:44.700 --> 02:26:49.140]  to all of us to not be afraid to be who we really are, to speak our mind, to stand up
[02:26:49.140 --> 02:26:53.300]  and to take action. And if we all do that all at once, there's nothing that could stop
[02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:59.020]  it. We are already shaming the media. We are already becoming the new mainstream media.
[02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:02.900]  But we have to keep it up. We have to do more. We have to have other individuals who step
[02:27:02.900 --> 02:27:05.260]  up. And by the way, people always think tyrannies
[02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:10.760]  are invincible until they finally fall. It's not the end of the world. This new world order
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:16.420]  is not destined to take over. It can be blocked. It can be postponed. It can be defeated like
[02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:22.020]  Nineveh and its hundred year reprieve. We have a job to do this. Any other comments
[02:27:22.020 --> 02:27:28.040]  you'd like to make in closing, Mark Dice? I just have almost respect for Luke and anybody
[02:27:28.040 --> 02:27:31.940]  that's not familiar with his work, I think you should go and check it out. And he is
[02:27:31.940 --> 02:27:39.100]  essentially a one man TMZ. But for important issues, instead of asking, you know, celebrities
[02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:44.620]  and politicians what they had for lunch or about somebody's new purse, he's out there
[02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:51.160]  asking the questions that we all are thinking our own, you know, would wish that the reporters
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:52.160]  would ask.
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:57.380]  And since he has no strings attached, he's able to do it. So, Luke, my, my hat's off
[02:27:57.380 --> 02:28:02.700]  to you. Absolutely. Great job. And again, everybody needs to continue along these lines
[02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:08.020]  doing this. Luke and Mark Dice, we will both talk to you soon. And Luke, I'm gonna be seeing
[02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:14.360]  you at Bilderberg 2013 there in Watford. I definitely will be there and we're gonna be
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:15.360]  all over Europe.
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:20.240]  So definitely check out all of our updates. We're gonna be doing a lot of work. All right.
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:24.580]  Great job. Great job, Luke. Great job, Mark Dice. Mark, one more time. Can I get an Alex
[02:28:24.580 --> 02:28:31.220]  Jones hateful imitation? I'm gonna go to your calls there in just a minute. But I mean,
[02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:32.740]  I've just got so much news here.
[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:39.440]  I just hate the scum, the scum, the scum. 1776 will commence again if you try to take
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:48.940]  off firearms. Oh, man. Oh, yeah. All right, Mark. Thank you, Mark. Any other ones? You
[02:28:48.940 --> 02:28:49.940]  do better not to.
[02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:54.180]  I go horse every time I do them, Alex. I don't know how you even have a voice left from all
[02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:57.980]  the yelling and screaming that you've done. But I understand, I know where it comes from.
[02:28:57.980 --> 02:29:02.820]  And man, I wouldn't wanna be in your war path, bro.
[02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:08.940]  No, you have done well, Lord Vader. All right, thank you very much, Mark. Keep going. Thank
[02:29:08.940 --> 02:29:13.180]  you. Go wake the zombies up. Speaking of that, I got Adam Kokesh coming on, but I'm gonna
[02:29:13.180 --> 02:29:18.500]  go to Chris and others first real quick before we do that. What happens is open the phones
[02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:20.740]  up, take some calls and get guests on and running out of time.
[02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:25.260]  Most shows just hang up on the callers. Maybe I should be bad to hang up on them. No, no,
[02:29:25.260 --> 02:29:33.020]  they're nice. They know what's going on. But those are good quotes. All right, we'll be
[02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:36.580]  right back. A little bit of self-deprecating humor. I actually like that better than people
[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:41.700]  going, Alex, you're so great. Alex, you're so wonderful. Just because I think you're
[02:29:41.700 --> 02:29:45.220]  great. I think you're wonderful, the listeners of this show. I feel like I'm not doing a
[02:29:45.220 --> 02:29:49.500]  good enough job that makes me feel guilty. You know, when a whole family comes up on
[02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:54.620]  the street, tell me how great I am. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex

[02:31:00.820 --> 02:31:05.940]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for
[02:31:05.940 --> 02:31:11.380]  all of us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for
[02:31:11.380 --> 02:31:16.780]  your liberty, freedom, and security and that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[02:31:16.780 --> 02:31:22.300]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[02:31:22.300 --> 02:31:26.940]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the most effective
[02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:31.560]  way you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation. The
[02:31:31.560 --> 02:31:36.980]  do-it-yourself public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer
[02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:42.500]  be provided. This along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations and additional
[02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:49.100]  government control of food supplies and resources says food is the ultimate priority. eFoods
[02:31:49.100 --> 02:31:55.860]  Direct will provide free shipping on all food orders until further notice. Call 800-409-5633

[02:32:01.060 --> 02:32:05.780]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security
[02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:10.540]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When
[02:32:10.540 --> 02:32:15.980]  you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders? Check out SimpliSafe. It's

[02:33:01.180 --> 02:33:07.660]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem. Government is
[02:33:07.660 --> 02:33:12.700]  the problem. From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become
[02:33:12.700 --> 02:33:18.940]  too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to
[02:33:18.940 --> 02:33:25.940]  government for, by, and of the people. If you've been successful, you didn't get
[02:33:25.940 --> 02:33:32.940]  there on your own. If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made
[02:33:39.500 --> 02:33:46.500]  that happen. You've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing
[02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:52.740]  more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems. They'll warn
[02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:59.740]  that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner. You should reject these voices.
[02:34:07.140 --> 02:34:13.020]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security
[02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:18.180]  objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's
[02:34:18.180 --> 02:34:23.180]  just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[02:34:23.180 --> 02:34:30.180]  The hammer of justice crushes you over powers. That's right. The only man that can interrupt
[02:34:31.980 --> 02:34:37.700]  his own liner. By the way, we're getting Adam Kokesh from his command center on the line
[02:34:37.700 --> 02:34:43.020]  right now. He'll be with us in a few minutes. And again, I support us right to the arm march.
[02:34:43.020 --> 02:34:48.980]  I think he's a good guy. He's going to tell us what happened to him in prison. I just
[02:34:48.980 --> 02:34:54.020]  have a bad feeling about an armed march on DC. I told him I think they'll put him in
[02:34:54.020 --> 02:34:56.620]  jail. Literally, they tried to set him up. We're going to talk to him. We're getting
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:02.780]  him online right now. But you heard Mark Dice just making jokes about me making callers
[02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:09.300]  hold. So let's make him a liar and go to Chris and Marilyn real quick and a few others. Chris,
[02:35:09.300 --> 02:35:12.780]  you've been holding for about two hours. I appreciate it. I don't usually do that except
[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:17.220]  every day. You're on the air. What did you call in about today, sir?
[02:35:17.220 --> 02:35:22.060]  I called in about John McCain, but I want to do a quick shout out to Luke Rudowski.
[02:35:22.060 --> 02:35:25.700]  He's the bomb. Mark Dice, I'm not really sure what he's doing. He's asking questions about
[02:35:25.700 --> 02:35:31.020]  Memorial Day. My question is this. I've been listening to you forever. Actually, I saw
[02:35:31.020 --> 02:35:37.460]  you at Chantilly when you were winded from shouting your head off over the gate. You
[02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:46.700]  actually had a lay down on your back and I told you I was watching Red Dawn with my son
[02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:51.800]  talking about reeducation camps. Anyway, my question is this. You talk about John McCain
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:59.580]  kind of scooting into Syria via Turkey, talking with real Al Qaeda. You need to break this
[02:35:59.580 --> 02:36:05.920]  down because we know this kind of befell the fake Al Qaeda. I mean, they've already sort
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:13.420]  of admitted Al Qaeda is this whole US created entity. Is there a difference between the
[02:36:13.420 --> 02:36:14.420]  two?
[02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:16.820]  Are we just kind of blurring everything together?
[02:36:16.820 --> 02:36:26.380]  No, no. I mean, I hear you. We need to differentiate. The point is it was created by the globalist.
[02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:30.200]  They've been radicalizing Muslims since the British took over and created what is Saudi
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:35.940]  Arabia today. And then they use the fake Al Qaeda double, triple agent people to carry
[02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:40.300]  out attacks and things or to take the blame for attacks that Western governments or contractors
[02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:41.300]  stage.
[02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:47.620]  And then you've got real Al Qaeda out of Qatar and out of mainly Saudi Arabia, Wahhabist,
[02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:52.620]  funded by the Royal House, who are literally slaughtering Christians and others. And then
[02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:58.100]  I've got to be lectured all day about, well, we've got to take your rights post 9-11. When
[02:36:58.100 --> 02:37:02.520]  I knew then they were running the Al Qaeda people just like they are now.
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:08.260]  And it's just it's what's crazy is they do it out in the open now. I mean, what do you
[02:37:08.260 --> 02:37:09.780]  think is happening there?
[02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:14.780]  Well, here's the problem. I don't I don't even know, because what the problem is when
[02:37:14.780 --> 02:37:18.220]  I listen to your show for two or three years and I'm a big supporter, so don't think I'm
[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:22.380]  some sort of anti anything. But what I've noticed over the years when I listen to your
[02:37:22.380 --> 02:37:25.780]  show, it's it's almost like, you know, it's an addiction.
[02:37:25.780 --> 02:37:29.140]  You got to get to hear what's going on and you got to check out. By the way, I want you
[02:37:29.140 --> 02:37:37.140]  to mention other sources of information that you rely on or you recommend, because all
[02:37:37.140 --> 02:37:41.380]  of us want to sort of like double check, although you do all well, I'll tell you what I rely
[02:37:41.380 --> 02:37:42.380]  on.
[02:37:42.380 --> 02:37:46.160]  I mean, I should do more basic videos about how I believe the world operates and cover
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:52.900]  big subjects. But if you want to know what I what I rely on, I know the globalist agenda.
[02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:59.860]  I've read their own books, their own publications. It's a hundred plus year old plan. So I know
[02:37:59.860 --> 02:38:04.900]  their program. I know their playbook. So I just look at news and then double check what
[02:38:04.900 --> 02:38:09.900]  they're claiming through a lens of it's like I'm a detective that's been following a serial
[02:38:09.900 --> 02:38:11.620]  killer for 20 years.
[02:38:11.620 --> 02:38:17.340]  I know their M.O. and I know if it's a copycat that isn't actually that killer. So I mean,
[02:38:17.340 --> 02:38:23.760]  it's more of an art form, understanding all of this and knowing their agenda and knowing
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:27.300]  over time who you can trust, who you can't trust. I mean, I see good stuff in New Yorker
[02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:29.180]  magazine run by horrible globalist.
[02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:34.380]  I see good stuff in the L.A. Times run by horrible New World Order people. But you know,
[02:38:34.380 --> 02:38:37.660]  but then there's like big stories they put out that you know are propaganda that are
[02:38:37.660 --> 02:38:44.040]  then parroted. Most news is actually somewhat accurate. It's the stuff is the lie is the
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:50.220]  big story, the big agenda they're pushing. Iraq has WMDs.
[02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:56.700]  You know, Assad is a war criminal, stuff like that. Alex Jones thinks Obama sent the tornado.
[02:38:56.700 --> 02:39:00.940]  I didn't say that. A caller said, I think it's weather modification. I said, it's probably
[02:39:00.940 --> 02:39:05.420]  not. But there is weather modification going on, so we don't know.
[02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:10.060]  So they edited that and I see that was a lie. And that's real desperation. So it's a very
[02:39:10.060 --> 02:39:14.400]  sophisticated point. And I appreciate your call. I will get to more calls in overdrive
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:15.400]  if I have to.
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:21.380]  I'm going to go to Jonathan has been holding and David and First Sergeant and Montine.
[02:39:21.380 --> 02:39:25.340]  We'll get to all of you. But I don't want to. We just got on the line. He's fresh out
[02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:31.420]  of jail last Friday and then rested up after spending six days or so going directly to
[02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:32.860]  the federal prison.
[02:39:32.860 --> 02:39:36.860]  You've already seen the footage of a radio listener. He didn't resist anybody. All the
[02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:42.140]  camera angles came out. They were forced to drop the assault charges and the failure to
[02:39:42.140 --> 02:39:46.540]  follow God's orders. I mean, federal officers orders. They had weird local Philadelphia
[02:39:46.540 --> 02:39:48.740]  police with fascist armbands.
[02:39:48.740 --> 02:39:58.580]  We've learned her federal local Renfield servants of Dracula, servants of the feds. So now we'll
[02:39:58.580 --> 02:40:04.300]  learn what happened inside the federal facility. And then we'll get updates on he wants a march
[02:40:04.300 --> 02:40:09.940]  on all 50 states. Adam Kokash joins us. Adam, thanks for coming on.
[02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:14.580]  Hey, my pleasure, Alex. Thanks for having me on again. Before we get into the latest
[02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:20.780]  on the marches and things, what happened inside there? How did you play chicken with them
[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:21.780]  and win?
[02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:27.040]  Well, I played hardball. I refused to cooperate every step along the way. And thanks to everybody
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:31.780]  in the outside who was making so much noise and realize that this was a frame up, decided
[02:40:31.780 --> 02:40:37.340]  to really put the pressure on them. And even that Sunday when I was there in federal lockup,
[02:40:37.340 --> 02:40:41.180]  there were people getting the prisoners riled up. I didn't find out about it till later.
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:45.780]  But I also want to give a shout out to George Donnelly of Shield Mutual, who provides insurance
[02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:50.980]  for situations like this and did an incredible job stepping up. Jim Babb, another activist
[02:40:50.980 --> 02:40:56.500]  in Philly who did a great job organizing events there, Nathan Cox, Meg McLean, Michael Salvi,
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:41:02.340]  Anthony Antonello, and my public defender, Jim McHugh, who really stepped up when executing
[02:41:02.340 --> 02:41:07.180]  the strategy, who understood what it was and took my advice to have fun with this.
[02:41:07.180 --> 02:41:12.260]  But if it wasn't for all of that, that increased the cost of what it was for them to keep me
[02:41:12.260 --> 02:41:17.420]  in prison, I was still able to communicate. I announced two events while I was in prison
[02:41:17.420 --> 02:41:23.300]  with the help of N.A. Poe, who I was locked up with. We radically increased the cost of
[02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:28.060]  them holding me. And so in the end, yeah, they blinked because I was saying I'm not
[02:41:28.060 --> 02:41:31.660]  going to accept the conditions of bail. I'm not going to take a plea. I'm not going to
[02:41:31.660 --> 02:41:35.380]  accept this felony charge. There's only one way that this is going down. Either you're
[02:41:35.380 --> 02:41:39.500]  going to drop and dismiss all charges or I'm going to be found not guilty by a jury of
[02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:40.780]  my peers.
[02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:45.340]  And if I have to do 100 days in solitary confinement, which was essentially what I was volunteering
[02:41:45.340 --> 02:41:51.180]  for because I had refused to take a PPD shot and submit to a DNA test, I told him my DNA
[02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:55.660]  is just fine and does not need to be tested. And it's against my religion to let government
[02:41:55.660 --> 02:42:00.780]  agents put needles in my body as they threatened to tie me to a bed in order to do that. But
[02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:04.340]  because of that, they couldn't put me in general population, which I was happy for because
[02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:06.460]  I was I was concerned for my safety.
[02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:11.940]  I was actually threatened by one of the marshals while I was in prison. And I said, you know,
[02:42:11.940 --> 02:42:16.740]  I'm not going to accept bail under these conditions. And then just Friday after being in detention
[02:42:16.740 --> 02:42:23.820]  for six days, I was unceremoniously dumped in the rain in Philly and in prison shoes.
[02:42:23.820 --> 02:42:29.260]  And it was it was an interesting experience because they took me through the process of
[02:42:29.260 --> 02:42:33.300]  getting out discharged from the federal detention center.
[02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:36.700]  But they had this idea that they were going to issue me citations, that they were going
[02:42:36.700 --> 02:42:42.100]  to bust the charges down or reduce them. And I have these citations right here, one for
[02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:47.140]  disorderly conduct and one for interfering with an officer, which you can see from photos
[02:42:47.140 --> 02:42:48.140]  posted online.
[02:42:48.140 --> 02:42:52.700]  I did not sign refused to. They said, here you go. You're going to sign for your personal
[02:42:52.700 --> 02:42:55.700]  effects. You're going to sign these citations. And I just laughed at him and said, what are
[02:42:55.700 --> 02:42:59.820]  you going to do? Put me back in there? I don't think so. And they carry, you know, two hundred
[02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:04.140]  seventy five dollars each, but they're not legally binding at this point. And I think
[02:43:04.140 --> 02:43:08.020]  it just goes to show that that when you stand up and assert your right to confront your
[02:43:08.020 --> 02:43:12.660]  accuser, as we did in the probable cause part of the hearing on Thursday, you can get them
[02:43:12.660 --> 02:43:13.660]  to back down.
[02:43:13.660 --> 02:43:17.140]  And they're going to be a lot less careless accusations the more people stand up in situations
[02:43:17.140 --> 02:43:20.940]  like this. Yeah, I've had people on the street in Austin and waiters and people come up to
[02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:24.780]  me when you were still in jail. So what we do about Adam Kokesh? And again, I'll be honest
[02:43:24.780 --> 02:43:29.420]  with you about this. I've been honest on air. I think you're a good guy. You've been back
[02:43:29.420 --> 02:43:31.780]  handily critical of me over the years in the past.
[02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:35.140]  And I just I think that's entertaining. I don't mind being criticized. I'm one of my
[02:43:35.140 --> 02:43:39.340]  biggest critics. But hold on. If you're going to mention that, allow me to say I have on
[02:43:39.340 --> 02:43:44.020]  the air. I have the utmost respect for what you do and what you have accomplished. And
[02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:48.780]  I believe I have some some philosophical differences that I'm very passionate about.
[02:43:48.780 --> 02:43:54.460]  But but I but all of my criticism of you is based on on on that alone. And I really consider
[02:43:54.460 --> 02:43:59.660]  you a brother in this fight and have the greatest respect and admiration for everything. I respect
[02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:03.100]  for you as well. But I just want to be clear. No, no, I'm just saying we all have differences
[02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:07.460]  of opinion on things. And I you know, they say to make a good radio host. I didn't know
[02:44:07.460 --> 02:44:08.460]  this when I first got into radio.
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:12.940]  Later, I learned it was the be authoritative. Never apologize. You know, say, you know what
[02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:15.980]  you're talking about. Well, I generally know what I'm talking about. That's why I come
[02:44:15.980 --> 02:44:20.340]  off authoritative, because I am. When I make a mistake, I'll say it. I have never been
[02:44:20.340 --> 02:44:27.820]  so conflicted as I am about what you're doing, obviously, because I have trouble gauging
[02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:28.820]  what's going to happen.
[02:44:28.820 --> 02:44:35.700]  So no, it's historically important. I know a fortune favors the bold. I know all of that.
[02:44:35.700 --> 02:44:41.460]  And so I'll be positive. I'll also be critical because I'm simply in my own mind trying to
[02:44:41.460 --> 02:44:46.980]  war game out different things. And I understand justice be done, though the heavens fall.
[02:44:46.980 --> 02:44:51.020]  You have a right to carry guns loaded on your back into D.C. The Supreme Court ruled it
[02:44:51.020 --> 02:44:56.180]  five years ago, even if they hadn't. Common law. Common sense says not only people in
[02:44:56.180 --> 02:45:01.260]  uniforms can have them, why can't you be trusted when you're not a felon or a criminal?
[02:45:01.260 --> 02:45:06.700]  The state's announcing you're a criminal. My issue is, is that the crowdsourcing knowledge
[02:45:06.700 --> 02:45:13.020]  is we just finished this quick point of my audience. I'd say about 70 percent of my audience
[02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:17.660]  says, look, you know, we get what he's doing, but we feel like it's going to be a bad strategy.
[02:45:17.660 --> 02:45:21.960]  They'll set him up. I said they'll set you up. I don't think they're done trying to set
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:27.540]  you up. Exactly. And then now you're going to have 50 of these. Do you plan for those
[02:45:27.540 --> 02:45:28.920]  to be armed as well?
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:34.220]  Now it's impossible to have cameras everywhere. So the other people they set up, they'll go
[02:45:34.220 --> 02:45:37.740]  ahead and put them in jail for assaulting police because we won't have seven cameras
[02:45:37.740 --> 02:45:42.860]  on it. Do you see my point is that we're winning the info war right now. That's why a lot of
[02:45:42.860 --> 02:45:45.460]  people think the strategy is a bad one. Go ahead.
[02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:49.660]  Well, Alex, the strategy has changed. And this is the opportunity presented by the circumstance
[02:45:49.660 --> 02:45:53.980]  the government has created by escalating their tactics and imprisoning me and framing me
[02:45:53.980 --> 02:45:59.100]  for assault, trying to simply being a political activist. Now, if we have time, I'd like to
[02:45:59.100 --> 02:46:03.900]  read the statement that I wrote when I was in prison. It's just about three minutes.
[02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:07.500]  But but this is this is the new strategy for independence. They were not going to be marching
[02:46:07.500 --> 02:46:12.220]  on the Capitol. It's going to be simply marching on 50 states. And as people want on their
[02:46:12.220 --> 02:46:18.160]  own to engage in civil disobedience, be it in armed resistance or simply showing up however
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:20.300]  they want, that's all on them.
[02:46:20.300 --> 02:46:24.060]  It's a decentralized open source thing. And this is what's so important, Alex. I believe
[02:46:24.060 --> 02:46:28.680]  we can have cameras at all of these events. I believe that this is what we have now at
[02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:32.280]  all of these events, because political activists, thanks to your work and the work of so many
[02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:36.820]  others talking about photography not being a crime at every one of these events, there
[02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:40.700]  will be accountability and there will be people calling for the orderly dissolution of the
[02:46:40.700 --> 02:46:41.700]  federal government.
[02:46:41.700 --> 02:46:45.780]  And this is what I realized when I was in prison was that I couldn't let this depend
[02:46:45.780 --> 02:46:50.540]  so much on myself. That's right. And and I'm not afraid, as you are, of standing up firm
[02:46:50.540 --> 02:46:54.180]  and saying, I know what I'm talking about. I'm standing on principle. But when it comes
[02:46:54.180 --> 02:46:58.980]  to ensuring this event being executed properly, when the government has already escalated
[02:46:58.980 --> 02:47:03.500]  the violent tactics against me personally as an organizer, I can't in good conscience
[02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:07.900]  go forward with a plan that is so centrally dependent and not open source.
[02:47:07.900 --> 02:47:11.960]  So this was the statement. When a government has repeatedly and deliberately failed to
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:16.500]  follow its own laws, violated the fundamental human rights of its citizens, threatened the
[02:47:16.500 --> 02:47:22.320]  sanctity of a free press, created institutions intended to eliminate privacy of communication,
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:26.700]  waged war at the behest of special interests that threatens the public safety, killed hundreds
[02:47:26.700 --> 02:47:30.520]  of children with drone strikes, imprisoned and destroyed the lives of countless individuals
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:35.340]  for victimless crimes, stifled economic opportunity to maintain the dominance of the financial
[02:47:35.340 --> 02:47:40.700]  elite stolen from the people through an absurd system of taxation and inflation, sold future
[02:47:40.700 --> 02:47:46.260]  generations into debt slavery and abused its power to suppress political opposition.
[02:47:46.260 --> 02:47:51.780]  It is unfit to exist, and it becomes the duty of the people to alter or abolish that government
[02:47:51.780 --> 02:47:56.740]  by whatever means necessary to secure liberty and ensure peace. A new American revolution
[02:47:56.740 --> 02:48:01.000]  is long overdue. This revolution has been brewing in the hearts and minds of the people
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:05.780]  for many years. But this Independence Day, it shall take a new form as the American Revolutionary
[02:48:05.780 --> 02:48:10.460]  Army will march on each state capital to demand that the governors of these 50 states
[02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:15.100]  immediately initiate the process of an orderly dissolution of the federal government through
[02:48:15.100 --> 02:48:18.220]  secession and reclamation of federally held property.
[02:48:18.220 --> 02:48:22.100]  Should one whole year pass from this July 4th while the crimes of this government are
[02:48:22.100 --> 02:48:26.900]  allowed to continue, we may have passed the point at which nonviolent revolution becomes
[02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:32.340]  impossible. The time to sit idly by his past, to remain neutral, is to be complicit. Just
[02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:35.980]  doing your job is not an excuse, and the line in the sand has been drawn between we the
[02:48:35.980 --> 02:48:40.400]  people and the criminals in Washington, D.C. While some timid souls will say that it is
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:45.340]  too early that we can solve this problem through the democratic means provided by government,
[02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:49.240]  that current levels of taxation are reasonable for the services provided, and that the crimes
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:53.940]  of this government are merely a tolerable nuisance, it may already be too late.
[02:48:53.940 --> 02:48:57.580]  While there is risk and drastic action, the greater danger lies in allowing this government
[02:48:57.580 --> 02:49:03.040]  to continue unchallenged. So if you are content with the status quo, stay home, get fat, watch
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:07.360]  the fireworks from a safe distance, and allow this Independence Day to pass like any other.
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:11.580]  But if you see as we see and feel as we feel, we will see you on the front lines of freedom
[02:49:11.580 --> 02:49:16.420]  on July 4th, 2013, for this, the final American Revolution.
[02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:21.560]  Alex, you said that 1776 would commence again. Well, it's not going to be the same. It's
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:25.580]  not going to be to restore the republic. It's not to think that we have more wisdom than
[02:49:25.580 --> 02:49:30.820]  the founders who moved the ball this far forward. We have to take it the next bold step, and
[02:49:30.820 --> 02:49:35.860]  that is to recognize that this is an empire in decline, and we can do this the easy way
[02:49:35.860 --> 02:49:41.220]  or the hard way. And what we are suggesting is the easy way, the peaceful way, the orderly
[02:49:41.220 --> 02:49:47.300]  process of a dissolution of this criminal government that has come to symbolize America
[02:49:47.300 --> 02:49:48.300]  to the world.
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:53.000]  We have to take it down. We have to overthrow this government, and this is how we do it.
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:58.040]  Because if we do not, if we do not have an orderly, peaceful dissolution of the federal
[02:49:58.040 --> 02:50:02.300]  government, it is going to be that much worse as we see a collapse of the currency, as we
[02:50:02.300 --> 02:50:07.340]  see martial law, as we see a government in its death throes continue to make more victims
[02:50:07.340 --> 02:50:09.660]  of otherwise law-abiding citizens.
[02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:14.860]  Sure, Adam, but last year I put out the call for the Second American Revolution, Drudge
[02:50:14.860 --> 02:50:19.340]  linked to it, a bunch of other news, picked it up. And I was talking about the states
[02:50:19.340 --> 02:50:23.720]  organizing with good members of Congress to declare the federal government as run by foreign
[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:29.640]  banks is illegitimate, but to reboot the republic via the states.
[02:50:29.640 --> 02:50:34.900]  When I had constitutional lawyers on, like Edmund Vieira and countless others, advisors
[02:50:34.900 --> 02:50:39.020]  to Congress, and they concurred, that was the constitutional remedy. But I mean, just
[02:50:39.020 --> 02:50:44.640]  saying the states will grab federal property and will overthrow the government, my angle
[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:50.380]  is the federal government's already been overthrown by foreign banks. It's been occupied. Then
[02:50:50.380 --> 02:50:56.940]  there's no debate and no civil war by leapfrogging that. I wouldn't use the term overthrow the
[02:50:56.940 --> 02:50:59.860]  government. Let's discuss that straight ahead.
[02:51:26.940 --> 02:51:33.940]  That's 888-988-3325. Or visit OneWorldWay.org.
[02:51:56.940 --> 02:52:03.940]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't
[02:52:03.940 --> 02:52:09.220]  even realize the serious concern for all of us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to
[02:52:09.220 --> 02:52:14.660]  get the most important supply you can for your liberty, freedom and security, and that's
[02:52:14.660 --> 02:52:19.580]  food. We thought the danger was drought, or food diverted to our gas tanks, or food so
[02:52:19.580 --> 02:52:25.380]  expensive that we'd all need financial assistance to afford it, or our food being sold to other
[02:52:25.380 --> 02:52:29.580]  countries. But here's the most effective way you'll lose your liberty and security without
[02:52:29.580 --> 02:52:35.020]  a fight. Government regulation. The do it yourself public services of many LDS Mormon
[02:52:35.020 --> 02:52:40.500]  food storage canneries can no longer be provided. This, along with the recent private gardening
[02:52:40.500 --> 02:52:46.020]  and farming regulations, and additional government control of food supplies and resources, says
[02:52:46.020 --> 02:52:51.520]  food is the ultimate priority. eFoods Direct will provide free shipping on all food orders

[02:53:10.740 --> 02:53:14.860]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the

[02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:27.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to cover every angle of the Bilderberg meeting this
[02:54:27.140 --> 02:54:34.320]  year with cameras. They have fought for decades to have their poor globalist media denied
[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:39.340]  to the public that mega rich bankers that got their money out of government contracts
[02:54:39.340 --> 02:54:44.340]  and fractional reserve banking fraud. These are the enemies. These are the people that
[02:54:44.340 --> 02:54:51.300]  are setting up this fraudulent globalist control freak kleptocracy that makes 1984 look like
[02:54:51.300 --> 02:54:53.860]  an escape route.
[02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:57.740]  These are the people and I'm getting on an airplane. I'm going over there to cover it.
[02:54:57.740 --> 02:55:01.420]  Some of my crew is going to be there as well. Luka Dowski is going to be there. We're going
[02:55:01.420 --> 02:55:08.260]  to have live video feeds, audio feeds, podcasts, all of it at info wars dot com forward slash
[02:55:08.260 --> 02:55:16.180]  Bilderberg or info wars dot com forward slash B, just the letter B. And it is an amazing
[02:55:16.180 --> 02:55:24.140]  new page that is going to have live chat on it. The latest feeds, photos. It's not done
[02:55:24.140 --> 02:55:25.140]  yet. It'll be done by tomorrow.
[02:55:25.140 --> 02:55:29.220]  You get a first look at it. We're going to send it out to everybody as well as a link
[02:55:29.220 --> 02:55:33.620]  who signed up at info wars dot com forward slash newsletter. Be sure and follow us at
[02:55:33.620 --> 02:55:39.860]  real Alex Jones on Twitter. And most importantly, continue to spread the word because it just
[02:55:39.860 --> 02:55:42.640]  hit me during the break that I've been meaning to make this point. We're gonna go into overdrive
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:47.100]  of Adam Kokeschel. Stay with us and take your phone calls for everybody that are holding.
[02:55:47.100 --> 02:55:50.740]  We've got to go. That's fine. But I want to do 20, 30 minutes of overdrive. Some stations
[02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:54.740]  carry it into the next hour. If you don't, you can go to info wars dot com forward slash
[02:55:54.740 --> 02:55:59.620]  show and it'll give you the live video and audio feeds right there into overdrive in
[02:55:59.620 --> 02:56:00.680]  the nightly news tonight.
[02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:06.660]  But Adam, it hit me last weekend and a month ago, but it's never when I'm on air. I always
[02:56:06.660 --> 02:56:10.900]  you know, more cogent when I'm not on air because you get on air and stuff's going on.
[02:56:10.900 --> 02:56:15.860]  You kind of lose the heights of your IQ. And my heights aren't that high, but you know
[02:56:15.860 --> 02:56:21.160]  what I mean? And it hit me like a ton of bricks. This is what I want to ask you right now.
[02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:26.540]  That if a revolution was happening and nobody announced it, would it happen? And what I'm
[02:56:26.540 --> 02:56:31.580]  getting at is the public is awake. People that aren't zombies. They know we're being
[02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:35.200]  screwed. They know we're being persecuted. We know the federal government's been taken
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:36.340]  over by the globalist.
[02:56:36.340 --> 02:56:40.040]  We know the new world order is real. Those of us that expose it have been proven right
[02:56:40.040 --> 02:56:46.860]  in spades, in triplicate. And all we've got to do now is stand up, speak out, it'll fall.
[02:56:46.860 --> 02:56:51.500]  So again, I admire what you're doing. I know cowards attack you out of hand because what
[02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:55.320]  you're doing scares them. But then other people are mistrustful because there's so much betrayal
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:56.320]  out there.
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:00.340]  And then other people start thinking they're just gonna set him up. This is gonna go bad
[02:57:00.340 --> 02:57:06.420]  in their gut. And then I saw your report about what, 50 arm marches? Now you're saying no,
[02:57:06.420 --> 02:57:11.820]  which to whatever the local group does, that makes more sense. But do you get the sense
[02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:13.860]  at an intellectual level?
[02:57:13.860 --> 02:57:19.940]  For me, it's a spiritual level, but I can also manifestly see it in this dimension that
[02:57:19.940 --> 02:57:25.300]  the awakening is now, history is happening now, our destiny is being decided now. Quick
[02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:26.900]  answer on that, Adam Kokesh.
[02:57:26.900 --> 02:57:31.820]  Yes, absolutely, Alex. And I believe especially the role of technology is incredibly important
[02:57:31.820 --> 02:57:36.860]  is empowering people to render government obsolete. I believe that the evolution towards
[02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:41.220]  a voluntary society is inevitable, which is why I would ask if you had the ability to
[02:57:41.220 --> 02:57:44.840]  end the federal government, why would you want to reboot it?
[02:57:44.840 --> 02:57:48.900]  Why would you wanna start again with this failed experiment when the American people
[02:57:48.900 --> 02:57:54.100]  are realizing that they're capable of ruling themselves? Human beings through the empowerment
[02:57:54.100 --> 02:57:58.940]  of the Internet are having greater access to information that is so fundamentally empowered.
[02:57:58.940 --> 02:58:02.660]  No, no, no, I want, we can have this debate in the next hour if you can hold, can you
[02:58:02.660 --> 02:58:03.660]  hold over?
[02:58:03.660 --> 02:58:04.660]  Sure, but absolutely.
[02:58:04.660 --> 02:58:08.660]  We can have this debate after we get more into the march and take these calls cuz I
[02:58:08.660 --> 02:58:10.220]  gotta go to them.
[02:58:10.220 --> 02:58:11.460]  Let's do it.
[02:58:11.460 --> 02:58:18.700]  But the issue here is that we don't have a federal government. It was hijacked. And I
[02:58:18.700 --> 02:58:25.120]  will be glad to get rid of government entirely once we've had a free system in a microcosm
[02:58:25.120 --> 02:58:31.940]  to bring down the communist Chinese, to bring down Apple with its Fox com slave factories.
[02:58:31.940 --> 02:58:35.960]  My point is I see the global is trying to co-op libertarianism to create a fake clone
[02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:36.960]  of it.
[02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:40.120]  So if you wanna have a real debate, we'll have it. It's coming up, infowars.com forward
[02:58:40.120 --> 02:58:41.120]  slash show.
[02:58:41.120 --> 02:58:51.300]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.300 --> 02:59:02.040]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride. You have a system
[02:59:02.040 --> 02:59:08.460]  that cuts up the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydroflourosilic acid advanced manufacturing
[02:59:08.460 --> 02:59:13.740]  technology can buy silver and pregnant and whites ceramic with new aqua medics advanced
[02:59:13.740 --> 02:59:18.060]  media or removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[02:59:18.060 --> 02:59:23.420]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off
[02:59:23.420 --> 02:59:24.940]  with promo code WATER.

[02:59:32.420 --> 02:59:38.080]  ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered
[02:59:38.080 --> 02:59:42.140]  by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[02:59:52.060 --> 03:00:05.940]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.940 --> 03:00:10.820]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.820 --> 03:00:12.420]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.420 --> 03:00:13.940]  Well so does he.
[03:00:13.940 --> 03:00:18.140]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.140 --> 03:00:23.260]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.260 --> 03:00:34.220]  All right, Adam Kokesh is our guest and we're going to take your phone calls actually just
[03:00:34.220 --> 03:00:39.940]  right now and then the next segment, Adam and I, we take these calls that have been
[03:00:39.940 --> 03:00:40.940]  recorded.
[03:00:40.940 --> 03:00:45.300]  We can get into a discussion about the society he'd like to see versus what I'm talking about
[03:00:45.300 --> 03:00:49.820]  versus what you're calling for out there.
[03:00:49.820 --> 03:00:54.940]  I just think government has dumbed people down so much that we're in a lot of trouble
[03:00:54.940 --> 03:00:58.260]  and I'm just trying to stop the new world order that's coming down on us like a ton
[03:00:58.260 --> 03:01:00.060]  of bricks.
[03:01:00.060 --> 03:01:05.180]  But I understand sometimes the big bold idea can be so large it overshadows.
[03:01:05.180 --> 03:01:10.360]  Their idea of tyranny is so big that it tends to overshadow things because they reach so
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:11.360]  far.
[03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:17.940]  Maybe we do need to reach even further and it's the bold stroke off to miss but often
[03:01:17.940 --> 03:01:21.620]  does hit to butcher some Shakespeare.
[03:01:21.620 --> 03:01:24.780]  Let's talk to more or Montine in Georgia.
[03:01:24.780 --> 03:01:25.780]  You're on the air, Montine.
[03:01:25.780 --> 03:01:26.780]  Hey, Alex.
[03:01:26.780 --> 03:01:31.940]  I was one of the people, hey, do you know we're having Steve Quayle on three years ago
[03:01:31.940 --> 03:01:36.860]  and he was telling people carry concealed weapons holders were going to be GPSed.
[03:01:36.860 --> 03:01:37.860]  Remember that?
[03:01:37.860 --> 03:01:38.860]  Yes.
[03:01:38.860 --> 03:01:44.540]  Well, I wasn't a member then, but I would listen to it streaming overnight because I
[03:01:44.540 --> 03:01:47.020]  have to, I listen to you while I sleep.
[03:01:47.020 --> 03:01:49.020]  That's how I learned so much.
[03:01:49.020 --> 03:01:54.300]  But that very day I'm getting ready, running around, getting my hawks and owls stuffed
[03:01:54.300 --> 03:01:59.220]  into the car to go do a program and knock on the door and there's this older guy with
[03:01:59.220 --> 03:02:03.780]  a lanyard around his neck from the Census Bureau and he had a box in his hand and he
[03:02:03.780 --> 03:02:08.060]  said, would you mind, I'm doing some preliminary census stuff, would you mind speaking your
[03:02:08.060 --> 03:02:09.460]  physical address into this box?
[03:02:09.460 --> 03:02:11.340]  And I didn't think anything about it.
[03:02:11.340 --> 03:02:16.820]  Well, that night, overnight, I'm hearing that day's broadcast and I'm going, holy God, I
[03:02:16.820 --> 03:02:18.420]  can't believe that happened to me.
[03:02:18.420 --> 03:02:24.780]  So I went around to all my neighbors, nobody else got GPSed and nobody else but me had
[03:02:24.780 --> 03:02:26.180]  a carry concealed weapons permit.
[03:02:26.180 --> 03:02:29.980]  No, no, Steve Quayle said on this show three years ago they were gonna have domestic drones
[03:02:29.980 --> 03:02:32.860]  over us using GPS to mark our houses.
[03:02:32.860 --> 03:02:33.860]  Now that's admitted.
[03:02:33.860 --> 03:02:38.540]  See, it sounded crazy to say the NSA spying on us without warrants.
[03:02:38.540 --> 03:02:40.980]  And now it's just like, of course they do.
[03:02:40.980 --> 03:02:42.380]  It's just amazing.
[03:02:42.380 --> 03:02:44.340]  Any comments on what she's bringing up?
[03:02:44.340 --> 03:02:45.340]  Adam Kokesh.
[03:02:45.340 --> 03:02:49.420]  Well, I think it's just part of the government in its death throes.
[03:02:49.420 --> 03:02:53.620]  What you're talking about in terms of the implications for the new world order, most
[03:02:53.620 --> 03:02:55.720]  of these efforts are futile.
[03:02:55.720 --> 03:03:00.280]  And it's really a matter of how do we ease ourselves out of this in a way that doesn't
[03:03:00.280 --> 03:03:02.260]  hurt as many people as possible.
[03:03:02.260 --> 03:03:08.100]  So I think that by taking away the tools, by abolishing the particular layer of government
[03:03:08.100 --> 03:03:12.020]  that we're experiencing the most tyranny at right now, we can address a lot of these problems
[03:03:12.020 --> 03:03:13.020]  at home.
[03:03:13.020 --> 03:03:15.580]  There's no doubt if we got rid of the federal government, there'd be a boom, the likes of
[03:03:15.580 --> 03:03:17.580]  which this country has never seen.
[03:03:17.580 --> 03:03:23.420]  $85 billion a month is siphoned out of this country and given to private individuals.
[03:03:23.420 --> 03:03:27.180]  And Congress can't even be told who the specific people are.
[03:03:27.180 --> 03:03:28.180]  I mean-
[03:03:28.180 --> 03:03:29.180]  I don't wanna play whack-a-mole.
[03:03:29.180 --> 03:03:32.220]  I don't wanna play whack-a-mole with all these issues and say like, all right, we're gonna
[03:03:32.220 --> 03:03:35.920]  fight GPS and we're gonna fight for gun rights and we're gonna fight for concealed carry
[03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:37.740]  and then we're gonna fight the NDAA.
[03:03:37.740 --> 03:03:40.860]  Cuz if you do that and you say, well, I'm gonna use the democratic process and we're
[03:03:40.860 --> 03:03:44.180]  gonna lobby our representatives and we're gonna do it that way.
[03:03:44.180 --> 03:03:45.820]  And the government says, good job.
[03:03:45.820 --> 03:03:48.620]  They'll pat you on the head and praise you and say, yeah, you defeated a bill.
[03:03:48.620 --> 03:03:50.940]  You see, the system works behind your back.
[03:03:50.940 --> 03:03:56.020]  They take a mile and laugh at you.
[03:03:56.020 --> 03:04:00.140]  Except now they see the crime is cutting into profits and destroying society.
[03:04:00.140 --> 03:04:03.700]  I mean, this tyranny they're setting up is not good for really anybody.
[03:04:03.700 --> 03:04:08.400]  I'll make one quick comment about something I saw on C-SPAN yesterday.
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:12.180]  I was stuck inside doing housework, so I put C-SPAN on.
[03:04:12.180 --> 03:04:15.180]  And normally it's stuff in Washington, like at the Capitol and stuff.
[03:04:15.180 --> 03:04:22.180]  But yesterday it was in San Francisco and there was a panel of people, two CEOs from
[03:04:22.180 --> 03:04:27.800]  CarShare and Rideshare, and then a couple of statisticians and stuff like that.
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:32.700]  The audience was full of 20 something, probably into their 30s.
[03:04:32.700 --> 03:04:38.260]  And nobody wants to own a car, they wanna all share one, they wanna stack and pack.
[03:04:38.260 --> 03:04:42.140]  And I'm thinking, I'm starting to smell agenda 21.
[03:04:42.140 --> 03:04:46.100]  And people got up at the end and asked questions.
[03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:48.900]  Nobody mentioned anything about smart growth.
[03:04:48.900 --> 03:04:51.260]  Everybody thought sharing a car is a great idea.
[03:04:51.260 --> 03:04:55.380]  No, no, this is the plan and that way more of your energy, your taxes, can go to the
[03:04:55.380 --> 03:05:01.500]  bureaucrats to have private jets, absolutely.

[03:07:07.220 --> 03:07:09.340]  before intruders enter.
[03:07:09.340 --> 03:07:13.220]  Burglaries and home invasions are at an all time high and crime is skyrocketing in rural
[03:07:13.220 --> 03:07:14.540]  and suburban areas.
[03:07:14.540 --> 03:07:18.540]  Eighty-five percent of break-ins are through a door and police response is often greater
[03:07:18.540 --> 03:07:19.840]  than 20 minutes.
[03:07:19.840 --> 03:07:21.820]  You can't afford to wait that long.

[03:07:56.580 --> 03:08:02.900]  Ultimate door security made easy.
[03:08:02.900 --> 03:08:09.460]  From his Central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.460 --> 03:08:13.820]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.820 --> 03:08:20.460]  The decision was publicly announced more than a decade ago by MIT and other major technology
[03:08:20.460 --> 03:08:25.560]  development centers, where they take our tax money and then go out and hire the best and
[03:08:25.560 --> 03:08:30.280]  brightest engineers and scientists.
[03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:35.580]  The decision was made to wire all of society to surveil and dominate and cheat the public.
[03:08:35.580 --> 03:08:41.860]  The stock market's rigged, the interest rates are rigged, everything's rigged as this kleptocratic
[03:08:41.860 --> 03:08:45.140]  group who've stolen the world.
[03:08:45.140 --> 03:08:49.300]  Now that they've done that, they're saying, we're libertarian.
[03:08:49.300 --> 03:08:50.300]  We keep our trillions.
[03:08:50.300 --> 03:08:53.060]  We've stolen offshore.
[03:08:53.060 --> 03:08:58.540]  And we're exempt from taxation while they also lobby the socialist and communists to
[03:08:58.540 --> 03:09:03.980]  raise taxes on the general public, poor people, you name it, Obama raised taxes on poor people
[03:09:03.980 --> 03:09:06.580]  to then transfer that money offshore to them.
[03:09:06.580 --> 03:09:11.060]  I'm talking about people like Peter Thiel, who's running around trying to take over the
[03:09:11.060 --> 03:09:14.460]  libertarians and is a member of Belderberg.
[03:09:14.460 --> 03:09:19.540]  And I'm not saying we can't have converts within the establishment, but these are not
[03:09:19.540 --> 03:09:20.540]  converts.
[03:09:20.540 --> 03:09:21.540]  This is cynical.
[03:09:21.540 --> 03:09:26.780]  So Adam, explain to me, all I'm saying is, a lot of times you have a quote revolution,
[03:09:26.780 --> 03:09:30.740]  the vacuum gets filled with an even more corrupt system.
[03:09:30.740 --> 03:09:33.980]  I think we should have a very small federal government.
[03:09:33.980 --> 03:09:37.480]  I mean, down the road, if we were able to get rid of it, that'd be great.
[03:09:37.480 --> 03:09:43.460]  But right now I'm trying to expose connect boxes hooked into the NSA, watching and listening
[03:09:43.460 --> 03:09:48.220]  to everything you do, not to stop you from doing crime, but to dominate you and run your
[03:09:48.220 --> 03:09:52.540]  life and know what you're thinking before you're even thinking it.
[03:09:52.540 --> 03:09:57.020]  I'm busy trying to get GMO out of places and exposing it.
[03:09:57.020 --> 03:10:02.380]  I'm busy trying, you say, well, there's whack-a-mole all these battles.
[03:10:02.380 --> 03:10:03.980]  That's where I've seen us have success.
[03:10:03.980 --> 03:10:08.420]  I mean, how would this model look of dissolving the federal government?
[03:10:08.420 --> 03:10:09.820]  How would this model look?
[03:10:09.820 --> 03:10:15.740]  And then I guess you think that the bankers wouldn't go fund the Chinese to then invade
[03:10:15.740 --> 03:10:18.940]  us and attack us, because that's the first thing they do.
[03:10:18.940 --> 03:10:23.540]  Or do you think our example of liberty would then be adopted by the Chinese and that they'd
[03:10:23.540 --> 03:10:25.220]  bring down their government?
[03:10:25.220 --> 03:10:29.620]  I think that's much more likely, and I think the historical trend would be towards that.
[03:10:29.620 --> 03:10:36.300]  And this power vacuum argument is not without historical precedence and has some credibility,
[03:10:36.300 --> 03:10:39.940]  but that's what makes this revolution that we're experiencing right now unique.
[03:10:39.940 --> 03:10:46.680]  This particular philosophically-based revolution that includes a change in the paradigm.
[03:10:46.680 --> 03:10:49.620]  So what is that power vacuum filled with?
[03:10:49.620 --> 03:10:51.600]  It's filled with self-rule.
[03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:54.220]  It's filled with people asserting their rights.
[03:10:54.220 --> 03:10:58.380]  That's what prevents another power that would be as destructive from coming in.
[03:10:58.380 --> 03:11:03.920]  But you talk about the victories that we've had and that are absolutely legitimate victories
[03:11:03.920 --> 03:11:08.580]  in putting checks on government power, but none of them have done anything to stop the
[03:11:08.580 --> 03:11:14.700]  general trend of government continuing to grow exponentially for the amount of exploitation.
[03:11:14.700 --> 03:11:19.700]  As you know, numerically, when you talk about the banksters, it's continuing to grow.
[03:11:19.700 --> 03:11:21.680]  None of that has stopped the bigger trend.
[03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:26.820]  So you point out that we have a sort of fake liberty happening within the establishment.
[03:11:26.820 --> 03:11:33.160]  I still think that's an improvement over obvious direct tyranny, where they're saying, no,
[03:11:33.160 --> 03:11:34.180]  you need a ruler.
[03:11:34.180 --> 03:11:35.300]  We're going to be in charge of you.
[03:11:35.300 --> 03:11:38.340]  We're going to take your rights and we're going to tell you how to live.
[03:11:38.340 --> 03:11:41.140]  We're going to pretend like we're letting you live your own life.
[03:11:41.140 --> 03:11:46.420]  And like in that sense, I think Rand Paul would be a huge improvement over Barack Obama.
[03:11:46.420 --> 03:11:48.980]  But I don't think that's the be all end all solution.
[03:11:48.980 --> 03:11:53.800]  And having some fake liberty where you say we still need a government, you still need
[03:11:53.800 --> 03:12:00.500]  some central authority is exactly what stops the process of the most important part of
[03:12:00.500 --> 03:12:05.380]  the paradigm shift, which is people internalizing the idea that they are free, beautiful, independent
[03:12:05.380 --> 03:12:10.340]  human beings who are capable of ruling themselves.
[03:12:10.340 --> 03:12:12.260]  So to be specific, we're going to take some phone calls.
[03:12:12.260 --> 03:12:16.180]  Adam Kokesh is our guest, Adam versus the man dot com, I'm Alex Jones with info wars
[03:12:16.180 --> 03:12:18.820]  dot com.
[03:12:18.820 --> 03:12:23.260]  Because I misinterpreted last week when I saw that letter you put out Friday about,
[03:12:23.260 --> 03:12:28.220]  you know, the final revolution is announced March all 50 capitals, you know, peaceful
[03:12:28.220 --> 03:12:31.020]  may not be possible in a year if we don't do this.
[03:12:31.020 --> 03:12:35.660]  I was interpreting it as because it was kind of left nebulous and you used rhetoric before
[03:12:35.660 --> 03:12:37.180]  like this is an overthrow.
[03:12:37.180 --> 03:12:39.060]  This is a revolt.
[03:12:39.060 --> 03:12:41.940]  I just wouldn't use that nomenclature.
[03:12:41.940 --> 03:12:45.220]  It's kind of like the groups planning a official protest.
[03:12:45.220 --> 03:12:49.740]  A Bilderberg are calling it fringe and we're not the fringe.
[03:12:49.740 --> 03:12:55.180]  The Bilderberg group is the authoritarian, parasitic fringe.
[03:12:55.180 --> 03:12:59.940]  So so well, Alex, what are the what are you afraid of that they're going to call us terrorists?
[03:12:59.940 --> 03:13:04.860]  I think it's time to actually use precise, direct language and what we're talking about
[03:13:04.860 --> 03:13:08.340]  and not be afraid about how it's going to be spun by the loyalists.
[03:13:08.340 --> 03:13:09.340]  We are armed.
[03:13:09.340 --> 03:13:10.340]  We are revolting.
[03:13:10.340 --> 03:13:12.660]  We are calling for an end to the United States federal government.
[03:13:12.660 --> 03:13:13.660]  We know it.
[03:13:13.660 --> 03:13:14.660]  Both of us are.
[03:13:14.660 --> 03:13:15.660]  You want to reboot it.
[03:13:15.660 --> 03:13:20.740]  I say we can end it and and and simply refill that power vacuum with individuals asserting
[03:13:20.740 --> 03:13:25.420]  their rights or even saying what I'm saying is the federal it ends the argument when you
[03:13:25.420 --> 03:13:30.340]  prove it's run by foreign banks illegally that are sucking eighty five billion a month
[03:13:30.340 --> 03:13:31.340]  out.
[03:13:31.340 --> 03:13:32.340]  That's not even the federal government.
[03:13:32.340 --> 03:13:36.920]  I mean, we can debate whether to get rid of the OK, let's kick the globalist out and then
[03:13:36.920 --> 03:13:39.820]  we can decide whether we're going to abolish it or not.
[03:13:39.820 --> 03:13:45.180]  And and Alex, if what happened as a result of what I'm calling for is that we are successful
[03:13:45.180 --> 03:13:47.220]  and there is a dissolution of the government.
[03:13:47.220 --> 03:13:51.900]  And at that point, the governors get together and say, well, we kind of want a defense collective.
[03:13:51.900 --> 03:13:52.900]  I'd be against it.
[03:13:52.900 --> 03:13:54.820]  I think it's going in the wrong direction.
[03:13:54.820 --> 03:13:59.420]  But I'd still be very happy with that as an outcome compared to continuing along the path
[03:13:59.420 --> 03:14:03.540]  of inevitable decline in a violent collapse of a government in its death throes, as we're
[03:14:03.540 --> 03:14:06.340]  facing today on our current course.
[03:14:06.340 --> 03:14:07.340]  Sure.
[03:14:07.340 --> 03:14:12.900]  But I mean, I would like to just arrest the leader of the Federal Reserve, arrest Jamie
[03:14:12.900 --> 03:14:17.780]  Diamond, arrest the heads of the big banks that are running the policy of treason.
[03:14:17.780 --> 03:14:20.020]  But it's not even treason because they're globalist.
[03:14:20.020 --> 03:14:24.980]  And so my point is, you want to reverse the implosion by design of society.
[03:14:24.980 --> 03:14:30.880]  We've got to first kick the globalist out because I think if you got rid of the federal
[03:14:30.880 --> 03:14:35.500]  government entirely or the shell of it, then the robber barons would attack the states
[03:14:35.500 --> 03:14:36.500]  one at a time.
[03:14:36.500 --> 03:14:42.000]  I mean, that's what America was, was the states in a mutual defense pact.
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:45.820]  And now it's just become a federal government, which then got taken over itself.
[03:14:45.820 --> 03:14:49.620]  Well, sure, Alex, I believe that it's only one step in the right direction.
[03:14:49.620 --> 03:14:55.420]  The eventual course of human history is to achieve a truly free, voluntary, stateless
[03:14:55.420 --> 03:14:56.420]  society.
[03:14:56.420 --> 03:14:59.020]  So anything that moves us in that direction is a positive.
[03:14:59.020 --> 03:15:03.060]  And you're absolutely correct to point out that if we have this orderly dissolution of
[03:15:03.060 --> 03:15:06.640]  the American government, you will still have very dangerous state governments.
[03:15:06.640 --> 03:15:10.560]  But at least then the damage will be compartmentalized and people will be able to recognize if the
[03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:13.740]  banksters are going after one particular unit or another.
[03:15:13.740 --> 03:15:18.780]  But you also have to acknowledge that the Federal Reserve system, the U.S. dollars,
[03:15:18.780 --> 03:15:24.300]  the World Reserve currency is the underpinning of so much of their power on a global level.
[03:15:24.300 --> 03:15:29.720]  And if you take that away, you get rid of this foundation of so much of that power.
[03:15:29.720 --> 03:15:33.380]  And part of this revolution has to include people at least asserting that they should
[03:15:33.380 --> 03:15:38.620]  have local currencies or currencies that are commodity backed, at least non-coercive currencies.
[03:15:38.620 --> 03:15:42.540]  And you know as well as I that that's what was really at the underpinning of the Federal
[03:15:42.540 --> 03:15:47.460]  Reserve system, that it was forced on the American people and coupled with gold confiscation.
[03:15:47.460 --> 03:15:51.540]  Well, I know this, America has been hijacked and that's not just rhetoric.
[03:15:51.540 --> 03:15:55.860]  I mean, if we could ever have a real discussion about how we're a conquered country, they're
[03:15:55.860 --> 03:15:58.980]  trying to mop up the media, mop up the states.
[03:15:58.980 --> 03:16:03.060]  That's causing pushback because it's gotten so naked.
[03:16:03.060 --> 03:16:07.380]  And I'm just saying these globalists, I mean, Adam, they will nuke a city.
[03:16:07.380 --> 03:16:13.340]  I mean, you've shied away from 9-11 could be staged and now our government runs Al-Qaeda
[03:16:13.340 --> 03:16:15.200]  openly in Libya and Syria.
[03:16:15.200 --> 03:16:19.500]  What are you gonna do when they blow up a major city and then say that the Patriots
[03:16:19.500 --> 03:16:20.500]  did it?
[03:16:20.500 --> 03:16:24.800]  You know, Patriots stole a nuke off an air base and detonated it and they're coming to
[03:16:24.800 --> 03:16:26.620]  kill us.
[03:16:26.620 --> 03:16:28.080]  Cuz I mean, that's what I'm telling you.
[03:16:28.080 --> 03:16:30.640]  We keep fighting them in the info war.
[03:16:30.640 --> 03:16:33.200]  We are bringing them down right now.
[03:16:33.200 --> 03:16:34.900]  We're winning on this front.
[03:16:34.900 --> 03:16:36.620]  They want a confrontation.
[03:16:36.620 --> 03:16:40.780]  I don't wanna give them an excuse cuz if I was them, I'd shut off a nuke and blame it
[03:16:40.780 --> 03:16:41.780]  on us.
[03:16:41.780 --> 03:16:45.560]  We're making excuses left and right anyways, and you could what if this to death, Alex,
[03:16:45.560 --> 03:16:49.060]  but the greatest thing we can do to mitigate the possibilities of violence is take away
[03:16:49.060 --> 03:16:50.260]  the tools of violence.
[03:16:50.260 --> 03:16:51.860]  Take away the nuclear weapons.
[03:16:51.860 --> 03:16:54.060]  Take away the standing army of the federal government.
[03:16:54.060 --> 03:16:55.620]  Take away the IRS.
[03:16:55.620 --> 03:16:59.980]  Take away all the federalized police forces and minimize what power it is that they-
[03:16:59.980 --> 03:17:04.300]  But there's other big criminal government gangs out there and that's where the necessary
[03:17:04.300 --> 03:17:06.640]  evil argument of government comes in.
[03:17:06.640 --> 03:17:12.140]  What do you do about the Chicoms and the Russians and everybody else, the globalists armed and
[03:17:12.140 --> 03:17:13.140]  put in power?
[03:17:13.140 --> 03:17:16.380]  These bankers are still gonna be running the rest of the world.
[03:17:16.380 --> 03:17:22.500]  Well, if some defense collective is necessary based on the threats when we get to this point,
[03:17:22.500 --> 03:17:26.180]  I would hope that it could be achieved through voluntary means, but I can certainly acknowledge
[03:17:26.180 --> 03:17:29.060]  that possibility and my plan does not preclude that.
[03:17:29.060 --> 03:17:33.940]  But the best thing that we can do to prevent that inevitability or that possibility rather
[03:17:33.940 --> 03:17:38.660]  of foreign military attacks on the United States is to inspire revolution to other countries
[03:17:38.660 --> 03:17:39.700]  and spread the message.
[03:17:39.700 --> 03:17:44.060]  And really, as you know, Alex, the paradigm shift that's happening today is global.
[03:17:44.060 --> 03:17:48.580]  I'm sure you as well as I do have fans from all over the world who are appreciative of
[03:17:48.580 --> 03:17:52.980]  this message, who don't have a particular stake in what it means to be an American,
[03:17:52.980 --> 03:17:56.100]  but they understand what it means to have the American government as a threat to the
[03:17:56.100 --> 03:17:57.100]  world.
[03:17:57.100 --> 03:17:58.100]  Sure, let me ask you this question.
[03:17:58.100 --> 03:18:03.920]  What do you do about the 50% of the population on average that literally, literally can't
[03:18:03.920 --> 03:18:10.220]  tie their shoelaces and have no idea what planet they're even on and walk around drooling
[03:18:10.220 --> 03:18:14.540]  with make work jobs or welfare checks who don't even know their name?
[03:18:14.540 --> 03:18:17.620]  I mean, what do you do about those people?
[03:18:17.620 --> 03:18:19.140]  We have to reach them with the message.
[03:18:19.140 --> 03:18:20.200]  We have to elevate them.
[03:18:20.200 --> 03:18:24.660]  We have to inspire them and we have to show them that when you take away government intervention
[03:18:24.660 --> 03:18:27.820]  in the economy, more economic opportunities come about.
[03:18:27.820 --> 03:18:32.020]  But if you understand the mode of government, it's we're gonna break your leg and then give
[03:18:32.020 --> 03:18:35.300]  you a crutch and say, if you couldn't see if it wasn't for government, you wouldn't
[03:18:35.300 --> 03:18:36.540]  be able to walk.
[03:18:36.540 --> 03:18:40.420]  And when you have someone in that crippled situation, because you're absolutely right
[03:18:40.420 --> 03:18:45.440]  to point out that a large chunk of the population is psychologically crippled as a result of
[03:18:45.440 --> 03:18:47.020]  government propaganda.
[03:18:47.020 --> 03:18:48.020]  What do you have to do?
[03:18:48.020 --> 03:18:49.620]  Sometimes there is a healing process.
[03:18:49.620 --> 03:18:50.700]  There's going to be a stumble.
[03:18:50.700 --> 03:18:52.140]  There's going to be an adjustment.
[03:18:52.140 --> 03:18:56.300]  But if you allow that leg to heal and you'd stop breaking that leg in the first place,
[03:18:56.300 --> 03:18:59.140]  you'll be able to walk in no time and eventually start running.
[03:18:59.140 --> 03:19:03.260]  And I think when people are able to see that as clearly as they are now, thanks to your
[03:19:03.260 --> 03:19:06.660]  work in large part and everything else that's available on the Internet, they're going to
[03:19:06.660 --> 03:19:09.300]  be demanding that the crutches be taken away.
[03:19:09.300 --> 03:19:11.780]  Well, the whole system's coming to an end.
[03:19:11.780 --> 03:19:15.580]  That's why the oligarchs are digging in, thinking a police state's going to allow them to stay
[03:19:15.580 --> 03:19:17.140]  in power.
[03:19:17.140 --> 03:19:20.760]  Everybody I talk to even knows the rich guys don't pay taxes on average.
[03:19:20.760 --> 03:19:23.180]  They know the globalists are exempt from all these rules.
[03:19:23.180 --> 03:19:25.460]  I don't see how they're going to get away with it.
[03:19:25.460 --> 03:19:29.740]  And so I just hope the establishment decides to go quietly into the night because it's
[03:19:29.740 --> 03:19:34.800]  going to be easier for them to give up their power than set the whole world on fire.
[03:19:34.800 --> 03:19:39.300]  But they got in power, Adam, because they're willing to take the risk to do it.
[03:19:39.300 --> 03:19:44.380]  I don't think this is going to go go very easily and this is going to be a big deal.
[03:19:44.380 --> 03:19:45.380]  Well, so am I.
[03:19:45.380 --> 03:19:49.580]  And that's why it's so important to not say that we're a completely nonviolent or passive
[03:19:49.580 --> 03:19:51.140]  resistance movement.
[03:19:51.140 --> 03:19:55.260]  We assert nonviolent means when possible, as it is certainly preferable.
[03:19:55.260 --> 03:20:00.220]  But we are not afraid to use violence if necessary, and we are capable of and asserting our right
[03:20:00.220 --> 03:20:01.220]  to defend ourselves.
[03:20:01.220 --> 03:20:03.360]  And I think that's not even violence.
[03:20:03.360 --> 03:20:05.100]  That's not even violence if it's defensive.
[03:20:05.100 --> 03:20:06.100]  Exactly.
[03:20:06.100 --> 03:20:11.860]  Well, it's violent in the sense that it is a violent act that we are reacting to when
[03:20:11.860 --> 03:20:13.420]  it's necessary to defend ourselves.
[03:20:13.420 --> 03:20:18.500]  Defense is always, I mean, watching Al Qaeda be used against Syria for two plus years and
[03:20:18.500 --> 03:20:20.180]  bombing them and all this.
[03:20:20.180 --> 03:20:23.100]  And then the media is saying, how dare Syria defend themselves?
[03:20:23.100 --> 03:20:28.020]  I mean, it's just things are so screwed up.
[03:20:28.020 --> 03:20:30.300]  And that's that's why it's time for drastic action.
[03:20:30.300 --> 03:20:34.260]  I don't think these, you know, these efforts to fight back, you know, an inch at a time
[03:20:34.260 --> 03:20:41.300]  are going to be effective when it comes to the actual point of collapse of modern governments.
[03:20:41.300 --> 03:20:45.280]  How far out do you think collapse is, because, I mean, it's I mean, they've got MSNBC articles
[03:20:45.280 --> 03:20:49.820]  about or CNBC articles about, you know, the dollar dying and stuff.
[03:20:49.820 --> 03:20:51.460]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[03:20:51.460 --> 03:20:52.460]  You know, I don't know.
[03:20:52.460 --> 03:20:55.860]  I don't want to make predictions in terms of years, but I'm thinking somewhere on the
[03:20:55.860 --> 03:20:58.380]  timeline of five to 20 years.
[03:20:58.380 --> 03:21:02.940]  I know that's that's pretty vague, but I do know that there is going to be a collapse
[03:21:02.940 --> 03:21:06.360]  of some kind in the federal government as we know it is unsustainable.
[03:21:06.360 --> 03:21:10.520]  So it's kind of a matter of the longer we let it go, the worse it's going to be.
[03:21:10.520 --> 03:21:15.500]  If this revolution starting this July 4th is successful and enough people come out and
[03:21:15.500 --> 03:21:18.800]  decide that we are going to fundamentally change the conversation, we are going to get
[03:21:18.800 --> 03:21:22.300]  the American people to wake up and realize that we're better off without the federal
[03:21:22.300 --> 03:21:23.300]  revolution.
[03:21:23.300 --> 03:21:27.940]  I mean, you say march and demand the governors do this and then take the federal property.
[03:21:27.940 --> 03:21:32.020]  Are you implying people should do a forced offensive situation?
[03:21:32.020 --> 03:21:36.700]  No, I think the governors can reclaim property within their states.
[03:21:36.700 --> 03:21:40.180]  As you have said, the federal government is illegitimate and has no legitimate authority
[03:21:40.180 --> 03:21:44.840]  over that property when a state would by comparison, although I would still say that it's fundamentally
[03:21:44.840 --> 03:21:47.180]  illegitimate as it's all part of the same system.
[03:21:47.180 --> 03:21:51.780]  Well, I'll say this, the feds internal manuals have been made public and all their training
[03:21:51.780 --> 03:21:56.500]  for my sources is to send in federal troops into any state that does that.
[03:21:56.500 --> 03:21:58.680]  They're really worried about that scenario.
[03:21:58.680 --> 03:22:02.140]  But if enough states did it, and that's why they always try to play off North against
[03:22:02.140 --> 03:22:04.660]  South, black against white, all this garbage.
[03:22:04.660 --> 03:22:11.160]  But I think if a state like Texas did it and said you're an illegitimate government, foreign
[03:22:11.160 --> 03:22:15.500]  banks run you, we're done with you, I think we would be joined by other states immediately.
[03:22:15.500 --> 03:22:20.820]  I mean, it's like the TSA, the state unanimously voted in the House to say you can't violate
[03:22:20.820 --> 03:22:24.100]  state and federal law and grab people's genitals.
[03:22:24.100 --> 03:22:29.620]  We're gonna start arresting you, and the feds said we'll have an armed blockade with F-16s.
[03:22:29.620 --> 03:22:33.380]  Why didn't we call the bluff and say, okay, bring in your force?
[03:22:33.380 --> 03:22:40.980]  They would have lost the moral debate instantly when an F-16 ordered a passenger jet to land.
[03:22:40.980 --> 03:22:44.260]  I mean, is there nothing we won't put up with?
[03:22:44.260 --> 03:22:48.620]  The military isn't gonna have F, that's why they wanna go to drones, Adam, cuz the future
[03:22:48.620 --> 03:22:55.020]  of an F-16 or F-18 or pilot says I'm not gonna shoot down an American Airlines flight flying
[03:22:55.020 --> 03:22:56.020]  into Texas.
[03:22:56.020 --> 03:22:57.740]  They'll just send a drone to do it.
[03:22:57.740 --> 03:23:03.180]  I believe you have a saying in Texas that would appropriately apply to your governor,
[03:23:03.180 --> 03:23:05.060]  all hat, no cattle.
[03:23:05.060 --> 03:23:09.420]  Yeah, that's true, boy.
[03:23:09.420 --> 03:23:16.300]  But I mean, my point is, the feds really think Obama is Abe Lincoln.
[03:23:16.300 --> 03:23:21.860]  And they fantasize about how they're gonna invade the states and put us in work brigades.
[03:23:21.860 --> 03:23:26.140]  I mean, these hippies really think they're like Mao Tse Tung or something, and I got
[03:23:26.140 --> 03:23:27.140]  news for them.
[03:23:27.140 --> 03:23:33.740]  Folks, we got 300 million guns plus, and I mean, it's like I told the Red Coat, I'm not
[03:23:33.740 --> 03:23:38.980]  looking for a fight, but listen, it will trigger 1776.
[03:23:38.980 --> 03:23:42.620]  And I mean, all these people that work for the government just cuz they're wearing commando
[03:23:42.620 --> 03:23:45.700]  outfits, I don't think they have any idea what's gonna happen if they actually start
[03:23:45.700 --> 03:23:48.420]  this fight.
[03:23:48.420 --> 03:23:49.420]  I think you're right.
[03:23:49.420 --> 03:23:53.620]  And that's one of the things that really is on our side, that the groundwork has been
[03:23:53.620 --> 03:23:56.340]  laid in the raising of awareness of the people.
[03:23:56.340 --> 03:24:00.500]  And we've seen this in every resistance movement of this type.
[03:24:00.500 --> 03:24:05.460]  When the government cracks down, it backfires, I mean, look at the Arab Spring.
[03:24:05.460 --> 03:24:09.540]  And I'm not saying that those were pure, true revolutions without foreign influence by any
[03:24:09.540 --> 03:24:10.540]  stretch.
[03:24:10.540 --> 03:24:13.700]  But there are a lot of lessons to be learned from the mechanisms of how those various events
[03:24:13.700 --> 03:24:14.980]  played out.
[03:24:14.980 --> 03:24:19.220]  And when the government cracks down, I mean, look at, like in Egypt, when the government
[03:24:19.220 --> 03:24:21.860]  shuts down the Internet, it's time to shut down the government.
[03:24:21.860 --> 03:24:24.740]  And I think people will respond to that, and it's those kinds of things that will wake
[03:24:24.740 --> 03:24:25.740]  people up.
[03:24:25.740 --> 03:24:31.060]  So again, this idea of an orderly disillusion through the states seceding and reclaiming
[03:24:31.060 --> 03:24:36.940]  federal property is doing things the safe, peaceful, easy way, rather than being delusional
[03:24:36.940 --> 03:24:38.700]  and waiting to do it the hard way.
[03:24:38.700 --> 03:24:45.100]  Well, I mean, the feds have more than half the property in the West, some states like
[03:24:45.100 --> 03:24:46.100]  90%.
[03:24:46.100 --> 03:24:48.900]  Imagine if they took all the stuff that's just rotting and wildfires because they won't
[03:24:48.900 --> 03:24:50.660]  cut the trees.
[03:24:50.660 --> 03:24:56.020]  Imagine if they actually sold that stuff off for, you know, 10 cents on the dollar, the
[03:24:56.020 --> 03:24:59.340]  amount of money it would raise, the wealth, the new boom.
[03:24:59.340 --> 03:25:00.340]  Oh, yeah.
[03:25:00.340 --> 03:25:05.540]  Oh, yeah, no, it's criminal how much this government has held us back economically.
[03:25:05.540 --> 03:25:11.980]  And that's what I think the people will only come to realize when it's shown in stark contrast.
[03:25:11.980 --> 03:25:15.900]  You can have the federal government or you cannot have the federal government.
[03:25:15.900 --> 03:25:16.900]  Look at the savings.
[03:25:16.900 --> 03:25:18.380]  Look at what the states can do.
[03:25:18.380 --> 03:25:21.220]  Look at what you can do as an individual with your community.
[03:25:21.220 --> 03:25:23.940]  Look at all the mutual aid organizations that are popping up.
[03:25:23.940 --> 03:25:27.740]  Look at all the ways that technology is empowering us to render government obsolete and to assert
[03:25:27.740 --> 03:25:28.740]  ourself honestly.
[03:25:28.740 --> 03:25:33.020]  Yeah, well, why does FEMA come in and say no one else can help in a flood or disaster
[03:25:33.020 --> 03:25:37.220]  and then put up signs saying closed for bad weather, right?
[03:25:37.220 --> 03:25:39.420]  Because they want you to be dependent.
[03:25:39.420 --> 03:25:43.420]  And that's kind of the struggle right now is the American people are caught between
[03:25:43.420 --> 03:25:45.740]  those of us who have woken up and the government.
[03:25:45.740 --> 03:25:54.220]  And there is a real, you know, sort of, you know, just a very deep conflict, a certain
[03:25:54.220 --> 03:25:56.100]  cognitive dissonance.
[03:25:56.100 --> 03:25:57.780]  And we have the truth on our side.
[03:25:57.780 --> 03:26:02.360]  We have to simply inspire them to do the right thing and to avoid that cognitive dissonance
[03:26:02.360 --> 03:26:06.780]  and show them that living in the truth is not only easier, but it's better.
[03:26:06.780 --> 03:26:11.180]  You're happier and healthier with an actual grounded relationship with reality rather
[03:26:11.180 --> 03:26:14.100]  than just believing the government of the government's propaganda.
[03:26:14.100 --> 03:26:15.740]  Well, you're right.
[03:26:15.740 --> 03:26:16.940]  Let's jam in a phone call.
[03:26:16.940 --> 03:26:19.060]  David in California.
[03:26:19.060 --> 03:26:21.580]  You want to bring up, I guess, the article I mentioned earlier where they're going to
[03:26:21.580 --> 03:26:24.060]  teach five year old boys how to dress like girls.
[03:26:24.060 --> 03:26:25.060]  Go ahead.
[03:26:25.060 --> 03:26:26.060]  Hi, Alex.
[03:26:26.060 --> 03:26:33.460]  It wasn't actually an article about that was there's actually a school in Wisconsin where
[03:26:33.460 --> 03:26:39.260]  for Spirit Day there it's an elementary school and the teachers want the boys to come in
[03:26:39.260 --> 03:26:43.660]  dressed like girls and the girls to dress like like guys, like like boys.
[03:26:43.660 --> 03:26:48.180]  And that's because they're attacking fundamental human institutions.
[03:26:48.180 --> 03:26:49.180]  People want to live some way.
[03:26:49.180 --> 03:26:50.180]  That's their issue.
[03:26:50.180 --> 03:26:51.860]  Yeah, they're obsessed with it.
[03:26:51.860 --> 03:26:52.980]  I'm not.
[03:26:52.980 --> 03:26:56.440]  But the trying to sexualize young children has a name.
[03:26:56.440 --> 03:26:57.440]  It's called pedophilia.
[03:26:57.440 --> 03:27:03.860]  Well, it's not only that, I mean, I've noticed this kind of this push and this agenda to
[03:27:03.860 --> 03:27:09.940]  kind of feminize men, you know, oh, it's cool now as a guy to be wearing a nail polish and
[03:27:09.940 --> 03:27:13.860]  women like the feminine guys and guys who wear makeup.
[03:27:13.860 --> 03:27:18.300]  And you know, you know, there's like a push to make you see how many women you see, how
[03:27:18.300 --> 03:27:21.780]  many women you really get doing that.
[03:27:21.780 --> 03:27:26.300]  I mean, that's just I mean, the messages they give men are the complete opposite of I mean,
[03:27:26.300 --> 03:27:27.300]  maybe a trend.
[03:27:27.300 --> 03:27:29.900]  He's looking forward at first, but that ain't what she's going to stay into.
[03:27:29.900 --> 03:27:35.060]  Adam Kokash, your comments on on the bomb on the agenda of this decadent government?
[03:27:35.060 --> 03:27:39.060]  Yeah, well, there's there's another story that I covered today from Intel above dot
[03:27:39.060 --> 03:27:45.040]  com Department of Homeland Security teaching kids to go to FEMA camps in time of crisis.
[03:27:45.040 --> 03:27:49.860]  And in a sense, the the propagandization is getting deeper and earlier.
[03:27:49.860 --> 03:27:54.300]  But we're going to see a split as well in the children that are raised by parents that
[03:27:54.300 --> 03:27:55.380]  have this awareness.
[03:27:55.380 --> 03:28:00.780]  Not all of them are capable of getting their children out and homeschooling or unschooling
[03:28:00.780 --> 03:28:01.780]  them.
[03:28:01.780 --> 03:28:05.820]  But when you see kids in these situations and one of the things that I'm so encouraged
[03:28:05.820 --> 03:28:10.860]  by and I know you get emails like this to Alex from from people in my audience that
[03:28:10.860 --> 03:28:14.860]  are that are in middle school that are going, holy crap, I'm the only one here who gets
[03:28:14.860 --> 03:28:15.860]  it.
[03:28:15.860 --> 03:28:17.180]  But they're listening to Adam versus the man.
[03:28:17.180 --> 03:28:21.180]  And I'm so encouraged because the people that grow up with the Internet, this is the thing
[03:28:21.180 --> 03:28:26.540]  that for all the government's efforts to propagandize the youth, they are so much smarter than us.
[03:28:26.540 --> 03:28:29.300]  There's so much more tuned in, you know, and I'm 31.
[03:28:29.300 --> 03:28:32.780]  I barely count myself among the millennial generation.
[03:28:32.780 --> 03:28:36.820]  But those of us who grew up with the Internet have a whole other awareness.
[03:28:36.820 --> 03:28:39.940]  And you can lie to us, but you can't get away with it for a while.
[03:28:39.940 --> 03:28:40.940]  Well, exactly.
[03:28:40.940 --> 03:28:45.320]  What's going on here is so many times their propaganda works for a while.
[03:28:45.320 --> 03:28:47.740]  But then boomerangs are backlashes.
[03:28:47.740 --> 03:28:48.740]  Right.
[03:28:48.740 --> 03:28:51.900]  And with with this younger generation that's coming up, I mean, the kids that went to high
[03:28:51.900 --> 03:28:55.380]  school with smartphones, when their teacher lies to them and they can just look it up
[03:28:55.380 --> 03:28:56.980]  and be like, I don't think so.
[03:28:56.980 --> 03:29:00.420]  Or like we saw, you know, kids were actually recording their teachers and then calling
[03:29:00.420 --> 03:29:04.860]  them out on it or doing the research afterwards and finding out the truth.
[03:29:04.860 --> 03:29:05.920]  It's just it's incredible.
[03:29:05.920 --> 03:29:08.280]  You can't you can't control the next generation.
[03:29:08.280 --> 03:29:11.540]  If anything, we have an obligation to get government out of their way.
[03:29:11.540 --> 03:29:12.540]  All right.
[03:29:12.540 --> 03:29:14.100]  Listen, appreciate your call, David.
[03:29:14.100 --> 03:29:17.740]  And I'm sorry to other callers if you call back tomorrow, we'll put you to the head of
[03:29:17.740 --> 03:29:18.740]  the line.
[03:29:18.740 --> 03:29:22.940]  Joe, Brian, first sergeant in Florida, Nicholas, I want 30 minutes in overdrive.
[03:29:22.940 --> 03:29:27.500]  OK, Adam, so so so the march on D.C. is off July 4th.
[03:29:27.500 --> 03:29:29.740]  We are marching on all 50 state capitals.
[03:29:29.740 --> 03:29:33.460]  And for anybody who wants to get involved, our national coordinator is Jeffrey Phillips.
[03:29:33.460 --> 03:29:36.640]  We've got most states covered, but we still need people to step up.
[03:29:36.640 --> 03:29:39.860]  We're going to have a list soon of those where we need people to take point.
[03:29:39.860 --> 03:29:41.740]  But Jeffrey J.E.F.F.
[03:29:41.740 --> 03:29:43.340]  R.E.Y. at Adam versus the man.
[03:29:43.340 --> 03:29:44.340]  Right.
[03:29:44.340 --> 03:29:45.340]  Thank you so much, folks.
[03:29:45.340 --> 03:29:46.340]  The new Bilderberg.
[03:29:46.340 --> 03:30:13.340]  The special Bilderberg coverage area info works dot com slash Bilderberg.
