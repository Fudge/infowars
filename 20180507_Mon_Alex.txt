[00:00.000 --> 00:22.400]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:22.400 --> 00:28.880]  Well, strap yourselves in, ladies and gentlemen, because you are living through.
[00:28.880 --> 00:33.160]  I am living through, we are all living through an incredible time to be alive
[00:33.160 --> 00:41.960]  right now. Wow. We've got two federal judges that are over the whole Mueller
[00:41.960 --> 00:46.720]  fiasco, the giant Democratic Party temper tantrum that's been going on for a
[00:46.720 --> 00:52.280]  year and a half since President Trump got elected and then got into office. And
[00:52.280 --> 00:55.400]  now that the economy is turning around and all these big peace deals are
[00:55.400 --> 00:59.480]  happening, the fact that we have good governance that's based on Americana
[00:59.480 --> 01:06.520]  again, they have gone into their death rattle, their death spiral, their death
[01:06.520 --> 01:14.880]  spasm. It is insane. And I got to tell you, so much is happening. The White
[01:14.880 --> 01:18.400]  House just called out China for being involved in domestic propaganda with
[01:18.400 --> 01:24.760]  Hollywood and with the universities and told them stop it. I mean, China, you
[01:24.760 --> 01:28.680]  talk about Russia, Russia can't even make it stop lights work across the
[01:28.680 --> 01:33.240]  country. They've got major problems. Of course, our country three times bigger
[01:33.240 --> 01:38.560]  than ours as well. Russia is not involved in jack crap, except for getting our
[01:38.560 --> 01:43.040]  uranium from the Clintons and stuff like that. And I'm not defending Russia. If
[01:43.040 --> 01:50.000]  they were in our business, I'd be in their grill right now. But China basically
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.240]  runs this country and Trump's trying to get control back from them. That's why
[01:54.240 --> 01:57.240]  he's got my full backing, even though I disagree with some of the stuff he does
[01:57.240 --> 02:03.840]  geopolitically. But more and more, he just always turns out to be right. So I
[02:03.840 --> 02:08.880]  got mad about the Syria thing. It's just this new thing White House counters
[02:08.880 --> 02:15.400]  China's Orwellian disinformation aimed at Americans. Yes, yes, yes. And the
[02:15.400 --> 02:20.080]  Democrats are on their payroll. The Republicans are barely on the Chinese
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.920]  payroll, and they ought to get locked up. Some of them are, I say indict them, lock
[02:24.920 --> 02:29.520]  them up. Let me tell you, if I'm involved with the Russians, lock my ass up right
[02:29.520 --> 02:34.080]  now. But of course, I'm not. I'm all about going out for tyrants and traders.
[02:34.080 --> 02:39.640]  Benedict Arnold's, I'm here to tell you. That's just some of it. That's just one
[02:39.640 --> 02:42.680]  article. I mean, I've got like 300 articles here and every one of them is
[02:42.680 --> 02:51.200]  just over the top insane. Ladies and gentlemen, federal judge accuses Mueller's
[02:51.200 --> 02:55.280]  team of lying, trying to target Trump. Another federal judge comes out and says,
[02:55.280 --> 02:59.520]  I call your bluff. No stay on this fake Russiagate investigation lawsuit.
[02:59.520 --> 03:02.480]  Mueller is basically calling for a stay on that, trying to pull out of that.
[03:02.480 --> 03:06.280]  It's none of it's true. They just follow these lawsuits and follow these
[03:06.280 --> 03:12.280]  criminal indictments, and there's nothing there. It's all smoke and mirrors. And
[03:12.280 --> 03:17.600]  so this is the fall of Mueller. He's committed so many crimes. He's acted in
[03:17.600 --> 03:21.360]  a rogue way. He lied to get his search warrants and you have the federal judge
[03:21.360 --> 03:24.600]  over Manafort saying that. Got the other top federal judge saying it. The other
[03:24.600 --> 03:30.160]  federal judge had to recuse themselves. The other judge that gave them the
[03:30.160 --> 03:36.720]  warrant to go after the lawyer, Michael Cohen, is a Soros operative and in the
[03:36.720 --> 03:41.680]  WikiLeaks as Hillary's favorite judge in her operative. I mean, wow, that's why
[03:41.680 --> 03:48.640]  Trump came out to tweet and warned 13 angry Democrats on Mueller's team said
[03:48.640 --> 03:54.160]  you should be wary. You better watch your butts. Well, they already knew that when
[03:54.160 --> 03:57.480]  he was president-elect. You already read the emails with Strock and his girlfriend
[03:57.480 --> 04:01.320]  and he's like, I don't like taking these orders. I don't like, I don't like the
[04:01.320 --> 04:06.320]  Trump, but this is getting dangerous. Yeah, because there was nothing there, buddy.
[04:06.320 --> 04:10.440]  You had all the wiretaps, all the surveillance, everything, nothing there.
[04:10.440 --> 04:15.960]  So then you announce, once he gets president, we never spied on him and
[04:15.960 --> 04:24.000]  Mueller testified and Comey testified and said Trump was crazy. He said, it's
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.240]  crazy. In his second testimony, once the president was elected, he said, it's
[04:31.240 --> 04:37.720]  crazy to say anybody spied on the campaign or the president-elect. And now
[04:37.720 --> 04:43.280]  we know it was all spied on and you have nothing but a bimbo. That's all you got
[04:43.280 --> 04:48.440]  is a woman paid off. What the frickin do we didn't elect him to be a choir boy. We
[04:48.440 --> 04:54.360]  elected him to turn the country back on and to bring back fertilization of the
[04:54.360 --> 04:58.120]  nation. Well, frankly, I'd be worried about him. He didn't like women. We'll be
[04:58.120 --> 05:00.240]  right back, ladies and gentlemen. Stay with us.

[06:12.240 --> 06:22.240]  this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:22.240 --> 06:28.880]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide
[06:28.880 --> 06:37.600]  it's Alex Jones. Well I got to tell you right now that I am I'm having fits of
[06:37.600 --> 06:43.680]  ecstasy right now. I'm seeing a lot of really good things happen and I'm trying
[06:43.680 --> 06:50.680]  to control myself right now because here's the problem. The Mueller team has
[06:50.680 --> 06:56.120]  been caught red-handed lying to Congress, lying to the American people, lying to
[06:56.120 --> 07:00.240]  federal judges and the lying to the federal judges and lying to Congress are
[07:00.240 --> 07:08.360]  both felonies. And the wheels have come off and Mueller is collapsing and they're
[07:08.360 --> 07:12.360]  in total crisis mode and Mueller has signaled he wants to quote stop the
[07:12.360 --> 07:16.080]  investigation till after the midterms oh because he doesn't want to influence the
[07:16.080 --> 07:21.360]  midterms of course not. The federal judges called him out saying you're
[07:21.360 --> 07:25.400]  doing this to impeach Trump this is a witch hunt it's all been confirmed here's
[07:25.400 --> 07:33.120]  the problem. These crazed maniacs are filled with bravada, hubris,
[07:33.120 --> 07:50.120]  hootspa, false aplomb, arrogance, delusions of grandeur and that's all dangerous. But now you mix in a very sizable portion of cornered rat
[07:50.120 --> 08:01.360]  syndrome and everything to lose syndrome. And what would happen in Lost in Space
[08:01.360 --> 08:05.560]  when Robbie the Robot knew that bad guys were approaching? Danger, danger, danger
[08:05.560 --> 08:11.640]  Will Robinson. Enemies approaching, enemies approaching from the northeast,
[08:11.640 --> 08:18.280]  from the southwest. Danger, danger, danger. And I'm here to tell you you don't have
[08:18.280 --> 08:24.320]  to be a rocket scientist or a geopolitical idiot survived to know they're
[08:24.320 --> 08:27.640]  trying to sabotage the Korean peace deal, they're trying to start a new war in the
[08:27.640 --> 08:34.840]  Middle East. They are guaranteed gearing up false flags. They've got the trucks
[08:34.840 --> 08:38.960]  loaded with the explosives waiting for the green light order. They're waiting to
[08:38.960 --> 08:44.080]  bomb federal buildings, they're waiting to shoot up schools, they are waiting.
[08:44.080 --> 08:48.080]  They've got their riot forces ready, they've got their anti-for-ready, it's in
[08:48.080 --> 08:52.240]  all the different Soros documents that came out this year from 2015. They wanted
[08:52.240 --> 08:56.200]  race war and to start martial law but it blew up in their face it didn't happen.
[08:56.200 --> 09:03.280]  The whole Strong Cities initiative, they had groups out killing cops but it all
[09:03.280 --> 09:07.960]  blew up in their face and didn't go the way they wanted it to. And so they've got
[09:07.960 --> 09:14.320]  all the King's forces and all the King's men, all the globalist forces trying to
[09:14.320 --> 09:17.240]  bully and intimidate the American people back into submission and it's not
[09:17.240 --> 09:23.800]  working but I'm telling you these losers are gonna try to overturn the chess
[09:23.800 --> 09:29.480]  board. You ever been playing basketball with somebody or football or chess or
[09:29.480 --> 09:35.040]  whatever game it is and you start winning and so they grab their ball and
[09:35.040 --> 09:38.360]  go home and quit or they overturn the chess board or they start a fight with
[09:38.360 --> 09:47.200]  you. And they can't win politically, they can't win culturally and if you look at
[09:47.200 --> 09:51.840]  the universities and the control freaks and the anti-free speech garbage and all
[09:51.840 --> 09:56.320]  the bullying and they want to extend that out and they've all been promised all
[09:56.320 --> 10:00.440]  this power once the globalist left his paradigm takes over. They've all been
[10:00.440 --> 10:03.680]  promised the academics and the rest of it that they're gonna be the new ruling
[10:03.680 --> 10:08.160]  class. They're being promised this by the current ruling class that's been
[10:08.160 --> 10:14.800]  exploiting everybody for 50 years. But they're told oh we're fighting the man,
[10:14.800 --> 10:21.120]  the man is telling them that and they're being told that once they finally take
[10:21.120 --> 10:26.760]  over they'll be this utopia. And during the consolidation phase they'll all make
[10:26.760 --> 10:29.800]  extra money and get ahead a little bit for 5-10 years but then the will
[10:29.800 --> 10:36.560]  collapse like Venezuela or every other country where this is done. And so there's
[10:36.560 --> 10:41.240]  a lot of really good positive things happening but I'm here to tell you the
[10:41.240 --> 10:46.520]  only thing left they've got is false flags or giant staged events or giant
[10:46.520 --> 10:52.640]  crises. We should open the phones up today and ask the question what do you
[10:52.640 --> 10:54.960]  think they're gonna pull now that they're cornered rats because here's the
[10:54.960 --> 10:59.400]  deal. Even mainstream media is having trouble ignoring Mueller caught by the
[10:59.400 --> 11:05.240]  head federal judge in Russia gate trying to get Trump impeached lying about for
[11:05.240 --> 11:08.720]  now almost two years about all these warrants and the things they're doing to
[11:08.720 --> 11:14.680]  parallel construct the illegal wiretapping that Obama and Hillary and
[11:14.680 --> 11:19.120]  the whole system was doing under Clapper and Brennan going back for a year and a
[11:19.120 --> 11:23.480]  half of the campaign so we're talking about three and a half years here. Three
[11:23.480 --> 11:27.840]  and a half years of illegal spying all this criminal activity going on rogue
[11:27.840 --> 11:33.360]  agency groups still spying on Trump even after he was in the White House. That's
[11:33.360 --> 11:38.320]  all confirmed now completely illegal lied to get the warrants the judges
[11:38.320 --> 11:41.400]  understand the House of Cards are coming down they understand Trump's
[11:41.400 --> 11:44.880]  winning they understand the economy's coming back they understand the borders
[11:44.880 --> 11:48.440]  are getting secured they understand we're getting giant peace deals they
[11:48.440 --> 11:54.080]  understand that Trump is winning these judges have known the whole time this
[11:54.080 --> 12:01.520]  thing was fraud now the rats are leaving the sinking ship now the exit is
[12:01.520 --> 12:06.680]  becoming a stampede. First they were creeping to the doors when he got
[12:06.680 --> 12:17.400]  president-elect 18 months ago then he got in 16 months ago and it began to be a
[12:17.400 --> 12:23.880]  quick trot for the exits. Now it's piling up climbing over each other like a
[12:23.880 --> 12:29.920]  riot and a Rolling Stones concert where the Hell's Angels are running security.
[12:29.920 --> 12:40.400]  Mainstream media is flatlining the big money's pulling back the only guy
[12:40.400 --> 12:45.120]  doubling down Soros all the other big globalist money got cut off or pulled
[12:45.120 --> 12:50.920]  back Soros goes I'm all in 80 plus billion everything because he wants to
[12:50.920 --> 12:54.520]  defeat this country he wants to defeat the West he wants to be in charge he
[12:54.520 --> 12:59.240]  wants to dictate the surrender of the Christians he wants full control and he
[12:59.240 --> 13:05.600]  can see everything he's done his life's work and those demon children of his can
[13:05.600 --> 13:10.520]  see everything circling the black hole of the Abyss and so they are giving all
[13:10.520 --> 13:15.320]  their power all their money everything saying destroy everyone that fights me
[13:15.320 --> 13:20.000]  target their families target their their crew members target the entire Trump
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.760]  family target Jones target Matt Drudge target Sean Hannity target target
[13:25.760 --> 13:33.680]  target destroy them destroy them destroy them but we're still standing and
[13:33.680 --> 13:37.600]  despite that they're targeting Greg Abbott they're targeting every Patriot
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.000]  senator every Patriot House member they target their families why do you think
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.160]  Trump's longtime doctor suddenly rolled over and said he wrote it he told me to
[13:45.160 --> 13:50.200]  and he raped me and you know you read you go read the headline oh he came and
[13:50.200 --> 13:52.880]  took his medical records after I leaked his medical records on him which is the
[13:52.880 --> 14:00.240]  law these people have clearly been bullied into this so Soros is funding
[14:00.240 --> 14:05.840]  thousands of candidates from sheriffs to mayors to city council to state houses
[14:05.840 --> 14:16.000]  to governors they are putting all their money in Bezos has come out of the
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.240]  closet as a big globalist he's always been one behind the scenes he's flooding
[14:19.240 --> 14:23.680]  money but all the other big globalists have given up Bloomberg Bezos and
[14:23.680 --> 14:30.720]  Soros are hitting America with everything they've got right now
[14:34.360 --> 14:40.080]  they're turning on war of the sexes race war it's in all the WikiLeaks it's
[14:40.080 --> 14:45.640]  despicable and it's criminal sedition in my view not to be part of the electoral
[14:45.640 --> 14:49.520]  process in this country but to overthrow it something Soros has done in
[14:49.520 --> 14:53.160]  more than 30 countries and that's why he thinks he's invincible because he's
[14:53.160 --> 14:58.960]  done it over and over and over again and he thought he had America finally but he
[14:58.960 --> 15:04.240]  didn't but the reason they've been demonizing me and saying I should be
[15:04.240 --> 15:07.960]  taken off the air and they say I said that Parkland shooting didn't happen is
[15:07.960 --> 15:13.200]  so ahead of other big events that they will stage they want me taken off the
[15:13.200 --> 15:18.480]  air or they want me show demonized when they send a squad in here to take me
[15:18.480 --> 15:24.320]  out at a red light or wherever in a drive-by or however they plan to do it
[15:24.320 --> 15:28.120]  so I can just see how the tea leaves play here that's well he deserves it
[15:28.120 --> 15:32.560]  he's that SOB that said this and did all that and once that domino falls you
[15:32.560 --> 15:36.560]  better know the teams are coming for you the teams are coming for you and your

[21:24.160 --> 21:33.120]  freedom caucus hey you know they're all Nazis they deserve to die but politically
[21:33.120 --> 21:38.480]  something happens to myself or happens to President Trump or other leaders you
[21:38.480 --> 21:42.200]  know who's created the atmosphere who's created the backdrop for all this and
[21:42.200 --> 21:44.680]  it's George Soros and the globalists and they're the ones that need to be held
[21:44.680 --> 21:52.640]  accountable through legal and lawful means but they know that they've bitten
[21:52.640 --> 21:57.280]  on more than they could chew that's why they're all in now no reserves they have
[21:57.280 --> 22:01.720]  committed their entire forces all their money their operatives are crawling out
[22:01.720 --> 22:07.200]  from under every rock and now is the time ladies and gentlemen to have the
[22:07.200 --> 22:11.640]  maximum effort but also to prey on your knees every morning noon and night to the
[22:11.640 --> 22:16.560]  god of the universe to give us Providence and to confound and blind our
[22:16.560 --> 22:24.560]  enemies and to give us the deep site and the quiet place of the most high that
[22:24.560 --> 22:34.800]  crystal focus that many see now is the time for God's spirit to be poured out
[22:34.800 --> 22:38.360]  upon the land against the enemy for when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[22:38.360 --> 22:42.880]  spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it and I pray that all
[22:42.880 --> 22:52.960]  of you pray to be that standard but God is God and won't come into you unless you
[22:52.960 --> 22:58.880]  ask and really want it and that nagging spirit of the world will say don't do it
[22:58.880 --> 23:05.000]  but you've got to really want it and the God of the universe the God of free will
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.200]  will come into you now next segment I'm going to get directly into the the huge

[24:26.800 --> 24:31.240]  families that worked at Fusion GPS to create the fake dossiers and all of it
[24:31.240 --> 24:34.720]  and lying to get the search warrants and then lying and saying they weren't
[24:34.720 --> 24:42.520]  spying on Trump as all of that huge boondoggle of corruption to frustrate
[24:42.520 --> 24:47.640]  the votes of America comes out what are these cornered rats going to do well
[24:47.640 --> 24:50.160]  the mainstream media isn't going to realize they're on the wrong side of
[24:50.160 --> 24:56.080]  history they're going to quadruple down not realizing that they can even pull
[24:56.080 --> 25:02.280]  off taking me out or Matt drudge out or Donald Trump out or Sean Hannity out or
[25:02.280 --> 25:08.160]  Tucker Carlson out that even if they could try to pull off killing or
[25:08.160 --> 25:13.080]  arresting or whatever the opposition that America's awake the world's awake
[25:13.080 --> 25:17.520]  globalism's in trouble everywhere nationalism sovereignty populism is
[25:17.520 --> 25:23.600]  popping up like mushrooms after a spring rain so what are you going to do you
[25:23.600 --> 25:29.360]  don't know what to do they're not going to give up they never do that's the
[25:29.360 --> 25:33.080]  thing about psychopaths and control freaks
[25:33.800 --> 25:40.240]  Trump tweets is this funny which I'm gonna go on even longer so it wrongfully
[25:40.240 --> 25:43.360]  impacts the midterm elections which is what the Democrats always intended
[25:43.360 --> 25:49.520]  Republicans better get tough and smart before it's too late bingo so that's
[25:49.520 --> 25:54.480]  coming up and then the huge news White House counters Chinese or well-earned

[34:50.680 --> 34:53.600]  ship in the narcotics

[35:12.400 --> 35:18.240]  you can't report on it and call it starvation so it's all this emotional
[35:18.240 --> 35:30.600]  idiocy and people fittingly doing a voodoo dance you know I'm looking at video
[35:30.600 --> 35:36.600]  they just played of the Donald Glover Childish Gambino dance he's doing they

[36:00.280 --> 36:07.360]  in the news and the media always sits there and then demonizes that's where
[36:07.360 --> 36:10.920]  they go into a trance state it's once they go into the trance state of
[36:10.920 --> 36:15.400]  particular spirits that's a particular dance I recognize and they mix it in
[36:15.400 --> 36:20.920]  with some more contemporary stuff some shuffles and some you name it getting
[36:20.920 --> 36:28.840]  back to what I was saying here we're gonna be breaking all of that down but

[52:00.640 --> 52:04.760]  what evidence he has of Russian bots and Russian companies it's all pure
[52:04.760 --> 52:11.080]  malarkey we now know the main Russian bot company is a mercenary group because
[52:11.080 --> 52:16.360]  you can't do this domestically so you go pay an 80% was Hillary they were just
[52:16.360 --> 52:19.480]  a mercenary group you can go pay and get your ads run then they'll run them
[52:19.480 --> 52:25.600]  everywhere using bots it works most of them are in Canada or New Zealand or
[52:25.600 --> 52:28.000]  Australia of your English-speaking elections because they know how to
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.640]  interface you know with English speakers for elections but you can go hire
[52:32.640 --> 52:38.080]  Russian companies to spam whatever you want lawnmowers you know supplements
[52:38.080 --> 52:42.920]  Amazon hires hundreds and hundreds of companies but they sell this idea that
[52:42.920 --> 52:46.480]  Russians influence the election because they could see Russian IP addresses
[52:46.480 --> 52:49.960]  coming back in the US of course the Russians are involved and they're not
[52:49.960 --> 52:55.360]  effective Mueller probe might have to go dark for midterm elections Wall Street
[52:55.360 --> 52:59.480]  Journal it's all blown up in their face now they want to pull the turtles head in
[52:59.480 --> 53:04.080]  and forget about all the scandals Hayden says don't work for the Trump
[53:04.080 --> 53:07.400]  administration if you're in government sabotage them don't go along with them
[53:07.400 --> 53:12.120]  but we've known that's going on for the last year and a half there it is what
[53:12.120 --> 53:19.160]  the judge call it called Mueller unfettered that means rogue uninhibited
[53:19.160 --> 53:26.000]  rampant unbridled unrestricted unrestrained that's the definitions
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.680]  meanwhile I don't think Giuliani overall is doing a very good job he's adding more
[53:30.680 --> 53:33.880]  confusion to it I agree with Alan Dershowitz that's who Trump needs to
[53:33.880 --> 53:38.840]  hire is Alan Dershowitz Mueller investigation into jeopardy as witch
[53:38.840 --> 53:44.880]  hunt accusations play out in court zero hedge has an excellent article showing
[53:44.880 --> 53:51.360]  how now three of course this will be my headline because I saw this over the
[53:51.360 --> 53:56.960]  weekend I forgot I keep saying two judges excuse me zero hedges correct as of
[53:56.960 --> 54:01.280]  Friday three separate judges have rendered harsh setbacks to the Mueller
[54:01.280 --> 54:04.880]  investigation demanding of you believe it facts and evidence to back up the
[54:04.880 --> 54:09.720]  special counsel's claims in unredacted format as one judge demands or risk
[54:09.720 --> 54:13.320]  having the cases tossed out all together the first major setback happened
[54:13.320 --> 54:16.960]  when a federal judge assigned the criminal case against Trump's former
[54:16.960 --> 54:22.960]  national security judge in Sullivan Mueller's team to turn over any
[54:22.960 --> 54:27.080]  expulatory evidence to Flynn's defense because there is none oddly Flynn's
[54:27.080 --> 54:33.280]  legal team never made the request I was told by people inside I'm not gonna say
[54:33.280 --> 54:44.160]  it on here maybe I should I've you know I don't break
[54:44.160 --> 55:01.040]  confidences but I just I'm gonna stop right there unbelievable yeah that's why
[55:01.040 --> 55:04.960]  isn't Flynn defending himself why did Flynn plead guilty because they'll
[55:04.960 --> 55:10.320]  bankrupt you he's just at their mercy he's not rich and then it goes through
[55:10.320 --> 55:13.480]  the other two second their liars catching them lying catching them lying on
[55:13.480 --> 55:18.520]  the warrants a manifold case it just goes on and on but this is the best
[55:18.520 --> 55:22.040]  article I've seen I want to make sure crew this is posted in full info wars
[55:22.040 --> 55:29.280]  calm this is the this zero hedge headline is powerful but I want to change it
[55:29.280 --> 55:36.360]  to I want to change it to three three federal judges have now exposed Mueller
[55:36.360 --> 55:40.920]  witch hunt I mean that's really what the headlines should be so we'll post that
[55:40.920 --> 55:45.880]  baby in full and again here's that headline I mentioned Dershowitz Trump
[55:45.880 --> 55:52.080]  team playing in the Mueller's hands Trump says 13 angry Democrats on the
[55:52.080 --> 55:59.080]  Mueller team should be wary close quote he's absolutely right Republicans in key
[55:59.080 --> 56:03.800]  election races turned down volume on Trump's tax cuts got a bunch of news on
[56:03.800 --> 56:07.680]  that I want to hit a lot of idiot Republicans are running from Trump instead
[56:07.680 --> 56:11.480]  of running towards Trump even though Democrats are running away from Hillary
[56:11.480 --> 56:15.680]  and away from the Democratic Party and towards Trump but Republicans again are
[56:15.680 --> 56:20.880]  a bunch of intimidated weak cowards by and large other than the Freedom Caucus
[56:20.880 --> 56:25.160]  and others they are a bunch of weak-need conformist who still watch
[56:25.160 --> 56:28.760]  mainstream media and still believe it and don't know it's all a giant hoax
[56:28.760 --> 56:35.640]  alright I promise I'm going to Emmy and I'm going to Lacey I'm going to Alex and

[56:58.760 --> 57:04.400]  for the environment and it's AP admitting it modern liberals are
[57:04.400 --> 57:10.400]  virtue signaling liars they're frauds they're fakes they're hoaxers they're

[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:03.400]  Millie Weaver reports that are coming up that are in HD you saw her live reports
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.400]  in the last few days from them migrant caravan that's still arriving with the
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:13.400]  thousands but she has dozens and dozens of people including Islamist Muslims
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.240]  admitting we're here for money we're here for jobs we're here for welfare we
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:24.000]  are not fearing for our lives we are not refugees but you got to hand it to them
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.320]  at least they're being honest and it doesn't mean I don't feel sorry for them
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.760]  but they're being used as human weapons to be socialized by the globalist to
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:37.480]  collapse us so very powerful reports coming up right now we've got Alex and
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:43.040]  Casey and Emmy and Paul and Lacey and a bunch of other calls I can't see me move
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.320]  that down thank you and so right now let's go ahead and go to Lacey in Tampa
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.560]  Florida I've been asking the question what will the globalist do now that their
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.600]  whole agenda is falling apart worldwide and Trump is succeeding what are they
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.200]  going to do now that Mueller's been exposed as a fraud by three judges excuse
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:05.920]  me three judges in just the last four days what's gonna happen wow what an
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.640]  honor Alex oh my goodness thank you it's an honor to talk to you please Lacey
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:17.320]  wonderful I think that right now they are absolutely desperate and they're at
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.480]  their most dangerous that's what scares me the most they never thought they were
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:25.760]  gonna get to this place they never thought that she was gonna lose now
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:32.040]  everything they've done is exposed and it's just a really dangerous time I
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:38.760]  agree and listen Vegas was an Islamic terror attack they used a gun dealer who
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.200]  had been in the Middle East probably CIA operative at least a cutout I got that
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.320]  directly from the hostage rescue team the first few days and then of course the
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.440]  evidence fall came out and then they just covered that up and then moved on to
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.640]  the next thing a stand down it happened the shooting happened but they stood
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:03:00.720]  down there in Parkland and so clearly I think they're gearing up for something
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.640]  much much bigger what does your gut tell you Lacey it's just really scary right
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.960]  now I feel like they've already been caught and they don't want to let us
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:14.920]  know about it because it's just that bad at least that's what I hope I hope that
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:20.000]  Trump knows exactly what's going on and right now he's quietly preparing to
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.120]  come back whatever they throw at us because it's just it's hard to believe
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:30.920]  that it is kind of quiet on that front we we don't seem to be pushing back
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:34.680]  really hard right now and I'm just really praying that it's that we're
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.840]  quietly preparing for whatever they're willing to throw at us and it's gonna be
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:44.680]  anything they are gonna go low and they're literally making conspiracy
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:51.560]  theories reality right now as we live and it's scary you're right this is an
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:54.720]  incredible time there's a lot of opportunity but it's also incredibly
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.680]  dangerous the globalist all over the world thought they set up a huge private
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:03.040]  corporate world government where governments transferred the power to it
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.680]  where they'd be tax exempt but diplomatic community well the world's not
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:11.960]  buying into that anymore and so they have an untenable authoritarian system
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.560]  and they thought we were so diverted with Hollywood and movies and
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.720]  entertainment that we would buy this well no a large portion of people of
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.000]  every race color and creed do not buy it and so I don't see how they ever think
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.560]  they're gonna put this back together again well they really got floppy because
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.040]  they thought that there was no chance and whatever that he was going to win but
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:41.920]  he did and definitely the silent majority we we crossed the line and we
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:45.920]  got to keep stepping up the plate that's right the human awakening has hit
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.200]  critical mass we've crossed the point of return but it's gonna be some rough
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.720]  water especially for those of us on the very front lines tip of the spear but
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:57.520]  it's a good price to pay and I'm honored we'll be right back with more calls I
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:03.880]  want to plow into all of this I'm gonna spend a few minutes here first just

[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:47.040]  very important article on info wars.com and news wars.com right now Trump
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:51.440]  tears into John Kerry over shadow diplomacy with Iran this is just down
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:57.960]  he was the one that created the mess in the first place and the deal is a mess
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:03.680]  you can be against war with Iran you can try to disagree with things BB has
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:09.920]  said it's so fashionable to attack him but you can't deny that Kerry now
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:14.160]  admittedly is involved behind the scenes trying to sabotage a new deal with
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:19.720]  Iran the United States does not need John Kerry's possibly illegal shadow
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:25.200]  diplomacy that violates the Logan Act on the very badly negotiated Iran deal
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.480]  he was the one that created the mess in the first place Trump put out this
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:34.920]  morning and that ties into this London independent article Obama is about to
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:41.200]  meet some of the world's most powerful leaders November 28th of last year and
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.840]  it said that he follows Trump around on foreign trips the day after Trump leaves
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:52.120]  he arrives and meets with the very very same people that's not called shadow
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:08:02.560]  diplomacy that's called the deep state going around saying hey don't agree with
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:07.400]  him don't listen to him he's not really the president that's what Hayden the
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:12.120]  former head of the CIA and the NSA is in the news this what last week and saying
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:17.720]  it's incredible so now that you've just joined us that you got not one not two
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:21.880]  but three federal judges coming out saying Mueller is lying Mueller's in a
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:26.280]  witch hunt Mueller wants to impeach Trump these are quotes Mueller lied to
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:34.000]  Congress what are they gonna do the cabal of 13 in the Justice Department
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.520]  the eye of Democrats that rigged all this think of the arrogance think of the
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.160]  insolence they thought teamed up with the mainstream media and their people
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:49.360]  dug in they could get away with this well with each passing day with each
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:53.240]  passing day the federal judges will rebuke and rebuke and rebuke because
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:57.080]  this is dangerous so they get away with this so what are the rats leaving the
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:04.600]  sinking ship gonna do we just talked to Lacey right we just talked to Lacey
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:10.920]  correct or who's you know so we're done with Lacey now we're gonna go ahead and
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:18.360]  we're going to talk to Paul in Oklahoma then in Emmy Paul you're on the air what
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.720]  do you think they're gonna do now what will the cornered rats of the Clinton
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:25.480]  stay-behind network the rogue government that's what the federal judge called him
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.160]  on Friday the head Russia gate judge said you're you're an unfettered power
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:35.120]  under yourself close quote that means you are a runaway rogue power who's out of
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.640]  control and lying and who thinks he's God and who thinks he can impeach the
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:47.000]  president or whatever come on man that's a quote so what are they gonna do next
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:55.400]  fall well my first I had two emotions at the same time first one was that I was so
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:00.200]  elated that this judge called up me or I was just I couldn't believe it and then
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:04.080]  simultaneously it was like I got hit in the gut and my motion was and they're
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.560]  gonna kill that man just like they killed it on Celia that's what I thought
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:12.720]  and I'm so elated and just I'm so pumped up today I just want to give a shout out
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.720]  to everybody listen to worldwide big info war oh yeah we're gonna win God bless
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:24.240]  you Paul appreciate the call yeah I said day one we had our crew down there
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.840]  within 24 hours of Scalia dying that didn't tell us he was dead for about 20
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.920]  hours but we drove to South Texas put up our drones everything got into the
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:39.240]  hotel and they got really upset and kicked us out and top globalist got
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.680]  special awards from Obama I'm not saying anything to do with the death of
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:48.840]  course not weird devil signs devil mask everywhere bizarre little beds out in
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:52.880]  the hallways just really weird stuff and I said this is like Bohemian Grove of
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.120]  Texas we learned it was and then it came out a month later in the Washington
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:05.000]  Post that it is a branch of Bohemian Grove and a secret society they just
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.320]  want everybody to know so we even guessed what it was because I know these
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:20.960]  people so well and it's just crazy good good points thank you what are they
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.960]  gonna do now let's talk to Emmy in Branson Missouri Emmy you're on the
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:31.920]  year welcome hey Alex hello thanks for calling hey what I'm thinking of is that
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:37.040]  you know the globalists have to mask the truth that's coming out and we've done
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.960]  massacres and the schools aren't working and the people are waking up to the
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:47.080]  anti-gun agenda I'm a first-time caller oh you're awesome what I think you're
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:50.840]  going to do is some kind of I'm going to create with technology some kind of
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:56.040]  natural disaster in the red state not on the west coast to the east coast so that
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:01.080]  that's going to kind of be like a heart BMS or underground new grid takedown
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.240]  with any of that and so that's going to take up the news cycle for about a month
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:10.800]  and people are going to die great point Emmy let me back you up on that and of
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.640]  course they'll probably run a headline saying Joan says deep state will use
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:19.520]  weather weapons to to distract from Trump's successes I'm saying Secretary
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:26.360]  Defense William Cohen in April 17th of 1997 told the Army Times and a press
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:31.480]  conference that major governments have weather weapons and even tectonic and
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:35.120]  volcanic weapons that they have where they can manipulate and control the
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:41.640]  weather and tectonic events and that the US was facing that so yes we use
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.120]  weather weapons in Vietnam on Ho Chi Minh trail I'm not saying they're
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:48.240]  going to do that you know a woman called like five years ago and there was a
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.920]  record hurricane excuse me tornado hit Oklahoma sitting and she said I think
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.240]  it's a you know I think Obama did it I said no man that's in that's in the
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:01.400]  tornado alley Oklahoma city's probably the center of tornado alley runs all the
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.920]  way up from Illinois right down to it ends at about San Antonio well sir
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.520]  when do we have new the new Madrid with the earthquake that just happened what
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.880]  the heck's going on with that I hear you Emmy I appreciate your call great
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:20.600]  points I'm not saying they're going to do it but they say they have these
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:27.280]  technologies just like BBC 23 years ago I was reading BBC articles about human
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.400]  clones to the embryonic level and how they were implanting them in cows and
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:36.720]  then I talk about it they go Jones is crazy that's 23 year old news and in
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:42.080]  that article I read on air 23 years ago they said that Britain had been doing it
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:50.600]  in labs for 15 years that's almost 40 years and again they don't call it Kim
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:56.680]  trailing they call it geoengineering and yeah there's the quote weather weapons
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:01.480]  have existed for 15 years testified US Secretary of Defense there you go
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:06.640]  there's an article about it from natural news of all places and I mean I'm not
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:12.560]  making this stuff up okay let's go to Casey in Ontario Canada Casey you're on
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:16.360]  the air on another subject go ahead welcome Alex how you doing buddy good
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:21.400]  my friend I have a couple questions for you I just what for one just on the
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:24.440]  supplements I finally budged and I probably spent you know five or six
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:28.800]  hundred bucks there this past couple weeks on the infowars store I got cave
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:34.480]  man vitamin vitamin mineral fusion the prebiotic and I got quite a few things
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.000]  I love them all bodies it's probably my favorite my one question about the
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  supplements would be is there a big difference between biome defense and
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:48.160]  the for life they're both top-of-the-line formulas wide spectrum
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:54.400]  strains and are the best that we can find from two different big suppliers and
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:15:00.400]  they can argue all day about which one's better I can tell you this that the
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:07.200]  count in floral life is they've got to be able to say they're 50 billion in like
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:13.320]  a year and so even if it's in regular temperature not cold and so I know for
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:19.240]  the fact floral life has a much higher count so that it will guaranteed in a
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:26.800]  year be at 50 billion the the other ones great as well and it's got a count much
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:31.680]  much higher but and in a year it's still 50 billion but I can tell you for life
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.480]  it's like way above that floral life is super strong you can argue about the
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.400]  strains though it's two different formulas I think it's really up to you to
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.240]  decide for yourself to stay there cuz I want to get to your other point we come
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:49.520]  back that's really a great question yeah it's bomb defense is excellent it's a
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.360]  really really really fancy group of strains and then floral life is ultra
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:16:01.040]  strong well they back say with us bacon lovers we ship free try our amazing

[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:45.240]  is in second the primary of seven people Michael Snyder popping in to talk
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:49.120]  about the blue wave that's faltering and a lot more he'll be popping in but the
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.680]  start of the next segment I'm gonna play one of the three powerful reports
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:58.320]  Millie weaver and Gavin winch we've got such incredible nerves of steel they
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:02.720]  went into the immigrant caravan which had coyotes and others involved in its
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:09.880]  smugglers with an info wars flag on the Mexican side of the border in Tijuana
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:14.840]  let me tell you that's not safe so I'm gonna tell them they are contractors
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:21.720]  they do a great job stop it that is not safe at all it's not the little migrants
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:24.560]  that are bad it's the people controlling them that you got to really
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.640]  watch out for so I don't want to get any details here but let me just say MS 13
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.600]  and others you were told by the FBI across the border when we met with the
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.200]  FBI two years ago we were asked not to talk about it let me just say this
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:42.080]  nobody should be in Mexico with an info wars flag on the border I'm gonna leave
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:47.360]  it at that and I told Gavin and I told Millie that and I'm not mad at him how
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:55.240]  can be mad at people with courage except I want them to not get killed so this is
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:59.000]  powerful footage just CNN only shows a mother with children and says oh she's
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:05.440]  scared no this shows what the people actually say the number one group by the
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:09.360]  way in the US now of any one group is Chinese women CNN reported that three
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.560]  years ago and I've checked the latest numbers it's even worse and it's middle
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:16.840]  class Chinese women that are allowed to leave their country they keep dual
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.840]  citizenship they come here check into a hotel two weeks before they have the
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:23.120]  baby they have the baby becomes a citizen everything is paid for for free
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:30.200]  and they sit there and milk off the US this is what are we schmucks here the
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:34.840]  biggest idiots on the planet I can't go to China or Mexico and do that I'm sick
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:42.840]  of it all right who's up next here who were we talking to we're talking to
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.960]  caller in Canada he wanted to get into Joe Rogan he was talking about the
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.600]  products and asking questions I did a survey during the break of the crew back
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:52.880]  there in the control room on who was taking it who they talked to that was
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:23:01.640]  taking it and it looks like floral life is more popular than my own defense but
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:04.400]  it doesn't matter you need to take different high-quality probiotics to
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.880]  get a mix of things in my view but they're both excellent probiotics the
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:11.960]  micro zx is amazing to knock out the mold them other garbage in four store
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.440]  dot com I'm gonna plug in where he just brought it up okay that's one of this
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:19.040]  question though Casey go ahead you have a Joe Rogan question go ahead yeah I
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.160]  didn't do the quality of the product I just curious I should be taking them
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:25.720]  both at the same time Alex that was all well I mean have you have you tried the
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:29.880]  products oh yeah absolutely I just I didn't take guys wasn't sure if I should
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.960]  be taking that many probiotics at once so I just stuck to the for life and the
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:36.280]  micro zx and the prebiotic there I've been taking that for the last two weeks
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.400]  and I thought I'd hold on to the biome defense until I'm done the for life
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:45.280]  sure well I mean did social I mean what's your what's your review I'm
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:48.800]  loving everything like what they were getting into the details like just feel
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:53.320]  less bloated less crampy just I don't know I just feel better oh I gotta tell
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:58.600]  you I remember my whole life even though I eat pretty good food and stuff like
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.600]  kind of having stomach aches here and there and driving home you don't like
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:04.880]  oh man I feel bad that you don't need to use the bathroom or whatever you just
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:09.680]  feel like you do everybody knows that feeling and since I got divorced because
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.760]  I was already doing some health stuff but I got really unhealthy and gain 90
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:19.880]  something pounds my girlfriend now my wife she said listen you got to take
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:25.240]  probiotics because the and I already knew that and it's like yeah so I
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:29.960]  started taking them and then it totally changed my life and then my stomach used
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:35.640]  to hurt probably every other day here and there no big deal now my stomach my
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:40.440]  hurt twice a year I mean it is it is that dramatic that the pesticides in the
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:44.880]  food kill the good flora you got to replace it it's absolutely true and
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.600]  yogurt and sauerkraut that has some of it but nothing compared to a good
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.680]  probiotics so you're absolutely right and folks if you don't try our probiotic
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.040]  fine just get a highly rated one because it's amazing go ahead I think
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:01.320]  prostagards very underrated as well I found that worked tremendously for me
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.240]  and I'm a young man like I shouldn't need to be taking these things up but
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:07.720]  even so I feel like oh you definitely notice the difference there's so many
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:11.880]  chemicals in the environment that attack the prostate and even the FDA lets you
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:15.320]  say Shaw Palmetto is great for your prostate it's not just good for that
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.240]  it's good for a bunch of glands and a lot of men who aren't even about 40 they
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:22.920]  take saw Palmetto and ours is a really strong version of it with a bunch of
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:27.120]  other added herbs so it's supercharged because it just makes life a lot better
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:32.120]  I'm gonna leave it at that I agree so I know your time is limited but you're as
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.240]  hard to call into his rush these days so I just want to make a couple points so I
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:39.760]  got you here the thing about Rogan was more or less just I loved hearing you
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:43.480]  I love info wars I love your show the four-hour show every day it gets me
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:47.440]  through work every day but just to hear you talk about things in an open setting
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.920]  freely dive a little bit more into the conspiracy side of things philosophy
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:57.120]  history I know how knowledgeable you are on history because you do get into it
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.200]  the odd time on here I just found it's so refreshing to hear you in that light
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:04.440]  and I know how busy you are everything but it just be really cool if you kind of
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:07.280]  got into that more I don't know if you could do it on it maybe start another
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.280]  hour program or you just talk about those things because I know this is more
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:15.080]  we are finishing we are finishing a more personal studio still gonna be high
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.960]  tech but it's gonna be personal I'm gonna go in and basically commercial free
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:23.360]  at least once a week probably at night go for hours and take calls and take
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:27.320]  questions and really get into all the esoteric and all the weird stuff this
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:30.440]  people want to hear that and you know it's background for everything so you're
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:35.240]  totally right as for Joe Rogan I've known Joe since 1998 and he's been a good
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:41.800]  friend since about 2000 and he invited me on his show last year I'd never been
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:45.600]  on his podcast he'd invited me many times I'd never gotten out there number one
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:49.560]  show he ever did then they wouldn't put it on iTunes they blocked it they mess
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:55.000]  with him a bunch and then now I know Joe's super busy and I don't bug him a
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.160]  lot but I text messaging and then no response and then like a month later he'll
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:02.760]  text message me back say oh yeah I want you on sorry I've been busy and then he'll
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.120]  have like Stephen Crowder on a few months ago and yeah I want Alex on he needs
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.640]  to come on sorry when I was also I didn't seem well I didn't really call Joe when
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:13.360]  he was here in town I'm figure he's busy I've told Joe I guess I'm not gonna call
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:17.860]  you anymore if you want me on call me I'm done but then so then I get a weird
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:21.800]  call or I get a you know weird text or I'm driving through a hamburger place you
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.520]  know a few months ago he's like yeah I want to get you on and then no no it
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:28.600]  never happens so I don't know Joe's a really busy guy he has one of the biggest
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:33.200]  shows out there but what the reason I need to get on that show is it I reach
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:38.520]  our giant audience but the media and risk represents what I say everywhere and
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:42.520]  if I can get on there that culturally reaches tens of millions of people who
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:46.800]  can then actually hear what I'm saying in long form on a bunch of key issues and
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.200]  so you know they're gonna attack me in every major forum out there and not
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:55.680]  even give me a chance to respond well Joe's a friend I know he got attacked
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:59.680]  for having me on and so it just becomes mysterious after the number one podcast
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:04.040]  he's ever had on back in February last year we're talking 14 15 months ago and
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:08.720]  then it's great he has Eddie Bravo on every other week about his you know fun
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.560]  stuff and Joey Diaz and we were both my friends when I used to go out to Vegas with
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:16.280]  them Houston you know I mean I'm you name it I mean I've hung out with those
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:20.680]  guys and partied with him a lot over the years and Bravo will come here I mean I
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:24.640]  love Bravo he's a good friend he's hilarious but Joe Rogan you know with
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:29.200]  basically no more contact with him just an occasional oh I want to get Alex on
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:33.960]  or occasional text messages hey buddy like the show okay so that's fine Joe
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:37.080]  gonna need to send those kind of Trump call me up telling me how great I am I
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.720]  said sir you're busy if you got something you need call me you don't need to
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:42.320]  call me anymore my wife heard that phone call she goes wow he's told the

[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:45.320]  so here we are inside the migrant caravan many of these people here are
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:51.240]  from Honduras and have been given a 30 day pass from the Mexican government so
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:57.920]  they can make their way up to the border where we're at right now all these people
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:02.840]  they came in same caravan up from all the way Honduras and they were here they
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:08.720]  went in six and then plus eight which it makes 14 people they already went in okay
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:12.880]  yeah and so are they pretty hopeful that they're gonna be allowed in as well I
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.760]  guess since they came in a TV and all that and there are people there are a
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:21.320]  lot of the country now so people is coming over here from different states
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:25.920]  different countries to fit in there and these people the one that supplying this

[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:10.760]  algo aquí en México no no safe si quiere cruzar para otro lado
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:17.120]  si es si estamos de espera y permiso papeles
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:23.560]  queriendo auxilio político y he wants to
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:26.640]  how do you say
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:32.240]  to the United States so he's gonna try to see if he could go across and maybe
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:47.000]  I'm looking for a better life so do you feel safe here in Mexico no no no no
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.440]  he doesn't feel safe here in Mexico because they think he's a lot of violence
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:36:00.920]  all he wants is to go to the United States but that's just a saying so they
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:08.680]  can go to the United States where are you guys from Salvador El Salvador why do
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:13.400]  you want to come to America the United States
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:19.880]  buscando mejor futuro looking for a better future how has it been in Mexico do

[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.840]  hemos quedado para descansar
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:46.200]  México has been kind to him they give him food and blankets and clothes so you
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:52.880]  know he feels he feels safe in Mexico the on this one
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:58.000]  they're from El Salvador and Mexico been treating them nice they like what do you
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.920]  want where do they feel safe here in Mexico
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:10.400]  se sienten seguros aquí en México no
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:17.120]  as they can call cross they rather stay right here in Mexico and if they
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:22.560]  work the salary it's it's higher over there so when you're thinking about each
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:27.880]  dollar how much it will cost they will get go over there make a paper and then
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:31.880]  they can come live in San Diego and they can work in San Diego that's how
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.400]  they make this that's how they help their families and I hope everybody get
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:44.560]  into America and make the life now we're told they're all fleeing political
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:48.880]  persecution like folks running from the old Soviet Union like Darian in the
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.400]  control room but that's not the case ladies and gentlemen and we went down
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.760]  and we showed the truth the videos are on info wars calm right now members of

[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:08.520]  economic not to claim asylum from violence or persecution an unusual
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:14.840]  amount of Muslims coming across now expanding on that Michael Schneider's
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:18.520]  here where this running for the first congressional seat in Idaho he's the
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:24.080]  second place in a field of seven and a dead heat with the neocon never
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:29.520]  trumpet that George Soros and others have reportedly been funding and he's here
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:32.520]  a lot of listeners already know he's in a key race we're supposed to talk
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.320]  generalities and into a bunch of subjects with him but you know you see the
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:40.720]  black fella from South America Central America he's trying to get into the
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:44.800]  racist country and of course you've got other folks trying to get into the
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:47.480]  racist country you know the truth is we're one of the most open countries in
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:51.120]  the world we're being told you capitulate to this and the Democrats are
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:54.320]  saying you come in here because the whites are evil we're going to teach you
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:58.080]  how to hate them and that's the real evil of this is the welfare and all of
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:02.720]  it because they take these people and domesticate them and quite frankly these
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.240]  migrants already look like on average that they are about a hundred pounds
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:11.320]  overweight and look you know I'm about 20 30 pounds overweight I'm not knocking
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:18.320]  fat people I'm just saying that remember that article it's on YouTube I did a

[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:11.520]  came on the air to make sure it had some continuity but I was stunned I've never
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:15.360]  heard of any such thing it's almost nothing surprises me anymore though I
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:23.280]  mean this isn't I love Obama

[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:56.920]  and millions and millions of illegal immigrants have been pouring across our
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:59.920]  border for years doesn't matter for Republicans Democrats in the White
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:03.800]  House it doesn't matter and see for years we've had the system of immigration
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:07.640]  totally backwards the front door coming in legally is super complicated takes
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:10.200]  forever incredibly expensive I've actually helped someone through that
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:13.720]  process it's a nightmare but meanwhile we've let the backdoor completely wide
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:17.240]  open said come on in gang members drug dealers people that want to abuse the
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:21.920]  system people who want to come here soak off us taxpayer dollars Islamic
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:25.200]  terrorists you want to come in to come to our sanctuary cities finally we have a
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:28.200]  president that's cracking down on it that's why when Donald Trump came on the
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:31.800]  scene he said I want to build a wall I said that's my guy so I was with Donald
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:35.440]  Trump from the beginning just like info what what wars was because finally a
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:38.960]  president was serious about securing our borders because either like Donald
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:43.080]  Trump says either we have a country or we don't
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:47.640]  we're gonna go some phone calls here in a moment but I want to get back into
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:51.640]  Mueller what do you make now three federal judges coming out just
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:56.280]  sensational and saying you're lying you lied to get orange lied to Congress I've
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:59.280]  seen the secret documents you're lying about what's in those you just want to
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:03.400]  impeach the president you're a fraud no stays on these I mean this is Mueller is
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:07.320]  just reeling from this yeah and it's extraordinary because the people we have
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:10.840]  in our federal judiciary aren't exactly the sharpest tools in the shed most of
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:14.920]  them are leftist and so for three of them to come out and say the obvious what
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:17.560]  we've known from the beginning what I've been saying from the beginning is this
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:22.000]  has been a total witch hunt total witch hunt and they found nothing in over a
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.280]  year and you know at the debate other night in Idaho our final congressional
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:31.120]  debate I said hey we got to shut this down finally and we got a fire Robert
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:33.920]  Mueller and that's the obvious answer and meanwhile the main opponent who's
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:37.440]  gonna win if I don't win he's up there saying you know I haven't even been
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:40.360]  paying attention to this something that info wars has been talked about for a
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:43.960]  year drudge reports been talking about a year one of the top stories in the
[01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:51.920]  country yeah and then this is a guy running for Congress yeah and in the
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:55.480]  back they've even found the video clip of that from from that debate where this
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:59.000]  guy's up there three times not just one time he says it three times he says you
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.680]  know I haven't been following that I can't really answer your question I
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:05.080]  can't give you my opinion never did answer the reporters question who had
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:08.360]  just asked him a question about the Mueller investigation never gave an
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:12.120]  answer one way or the other all he all he could say was you know I haven't been
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:15.180]  following that even though it's the biggest news story the biggest
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:17.920]  controversy when they say that it's because they don't want to talk bad
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:21.440]  about Lord Mueller so what do you expect the Democrats to do next I think
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:24.840]  they're gonna stage a false flag or pull something big oh absolutely and that
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:27.760]  what the Democrats ultimately want is they want to get rid of Trump because
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:31.480]  the Democratic Party totally controlled by the globalist Republicans mostly
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:34.320]  controlled by the globalist although we're taking ground we're taking it back
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:37.240]  that's why I'm running for Congress because we're trying to take over the
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:42.560]  Republican Party now we've just got a foothold now a beachhead despite the
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:47.440]  rhinos the neocons and the globalists and the leftist the biggest now group in
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:51.000]  that fractured system is the Patriots we're rising so they're trying to destroy
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.720]  all of our leaders while they're putting neocons into our movement yeah and
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:57.920]  Trump has established his beachhead I'm you know my father was in the Navy I like
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:02.440]  to talk in military terms so he stormed the beach he's under constant fire he
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:06.880]  needs backup that's why in Idaho our biggest thing is whatever we do on our
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:09.960]  campaign signs right at the top says vote pro-Trump if you look at our
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:13.120]  campaign literature it says vote for the pro-Trump candidate right on the front
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:16.240]  if you go to our website Michael Snyder for Congress calm you're greeted by a
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:19.320]  pro-Trump message because we want everyone to know we're the pro-Trump
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:23.600]  candidate we're the anti-globalist candidate we're the hardcore info wars
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:27.560]  platform Ron Paul platform freedom liberty restoring limited government
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:31.000]  restoring our Constitution Republic that's what we're all about but you know
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.360]  what my opponents have noticed that our message is working and so they've
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:37.480]  started to copy us and actually take all it's in the news that most of
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:42.680]  Democrats running now are acting like that that they're pro-Trump or pro
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:46.200]  make America great but some Republicans are actually running against Trump
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:49.320]  they do they have no instincts the Democrats are acting like they're
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:52.720]  pro-Trump but Republicans some of them don't get that oh a lot of the
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:56.320]  Republicans are totally clueless and you know it's like when they go to DC is
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:59.040]  like they have their signs surgically removed they're constantly
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:02.280]  compromising on anything they've been compromising for so long they don't
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:05.720]  believe in anything anymore that's why we need to send people to Washington that
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:08.920]  aren't just right on the issues but that are willing to fight and if I go to
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:12.640]  Congress I mean we very well understand I'm gonna be the most hated member of
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:15.640]  Congress in all of Washington DC oh it'd be beautiful if you were there
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:19.720]  because so just educating folks in Idaho by running and you aren't a close
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:23.360]  second place in a seven-way race but if you get there imagine you up there on
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:27.440]  c-span on national TV everywhere we're going through the New World Order going
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:30.680]  through the TPP going through the Department of Education it would really
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:34.600]  be a good thing oh and I'll go right to the floor of House of the House of
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:38.280]  Representatives I'll start ranting like Alex Jones you guys know me right from
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:41.080]  the floor of the House of Representatives so if you want to see that we
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:44.800]  have this opportunity to defeat the globalist one seated it's not saying
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:48.200]  don't be like the Democrats and if your mom your dad your cousin your brother
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:51.800]  whatever died last few years on the voter roll do not go in and vote their
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:55.400]  name and I'm not being tongue-in-cheek we really shouldn't become the enemy but
[01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:58.800]  go catch illegals or you know folks vote in the name of dead people just make sure
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:02.120]  you get out you vote and because because you know they're gonna pull some
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:06.520]  hanky-panky oh absolutely absolutely but the beautiful thing is the primaries
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:09.520]  we can have so much more of an impact than the general election because in our
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:12.520]  prayer that is an issue that the Democrats are giving drivers license all
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:15.200]  over the country illegals of vote they're doing all this and then we as
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:19.000]  libertarians or Christians we don't cheat okay I agree we shouldn't cheat but
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.240]  we need to start prosecuting these people that are caught cheating yeah we need
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:24.760]  to restore the rule of law in this country that's why I'm the only one I'll
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:28.560]  be honest though I've I've I've really thought about because the conservative
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:32.880]  started cheating we'd be much better the Democrats on it and I just I mean in a
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:36.240]  certain level man I think about cheating because they're cheating and I'm not
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:39.640]  gonna cheat I'm being honest here but I think about it which is why I'm a
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:44.920]  sinful person oh yeah I mean that even the globalist Republicans cheat you know
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:48.800]  they're smearing me all over Facebook all over them a media in Idaho telling
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:51.680]  oh yeah the new thing is it's not just that conservatives are being censored by
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:55.920]  YouTube Facebook Twitter they've got all these conservative light pro-war neo
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:57:00.680]  cons who they just flood that they don't block them and there's a list of them
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:04.520]  and it's people like Shapiro and others and it's disgusting oh it really is it
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:07.720]  really is and you know for example one kid they could have attacked me on so
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:10.880]  many things that are true but they're actually saying on Facebook that I'm a
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:15.360]  plant from Washington DC I was sent to Idaho to sit there all these years that
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:18.760]  spring up at just the right time and try to destroy the conservative movement in
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:23.200]  Idaho as a plant from Washington DC even though I'm in an info wars written
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:26.920]  more than 3,000 articles fighting the New World Order fighting the globalist they
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:30.400]  say I'm a plant from Washington DC that's the theory going around Facebook
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:33.480]  because they're trying to destroy me because they're desperate not to anybody

[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:56.200]  all these years I wanted to ask you a question though there's a show on
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:04.640]  Snapple radio by Scott it says Alex Jones compromise by by Cody Sawgrass he
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:10.040]  sent you a book choosing the life and I was wondering why he hasn't heard anything
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:14.600]  from you yet I think you're doing an awesome job well thank you ma'am maybe
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:18.800]  I should turn my audio down but you're distorted a little bit someone sent me a
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:24.400]  you say a book yes it was Cody snogger he sent you a book called choosing the
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:29.400]  life okay well listen I get hundreds of things a week a lot of it ends up on
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:34.560]  air I may have missed that book but if I don't email somebody back or I don't
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:38.160]  call back about their book it's it's not a personal thing I get totally
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:41.640]  overwhelmed up here that I kind of run out of steam about 5 or 6 o'clock but I
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:46.240]  will I will try to look into that thank you you called about not happy with
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:52.160]  Trump well I'm not happy with Trump I think that he's doing a very good job
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:57.240]  overall with getting everything in I I don't know how they're going to I have
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:02.920]  like a mixed view about Trump actually I do too I don't know I don't know if he's
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:06.920]  the last Illuminati Trump card to be playing no pun intended or if he's
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:13.520]  just playing all these of elite satanic Illuminati people and just playing the
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:16.560]  cards and doing what he has to do and I don't think he's going to reveal to
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:21.960]  anybody what his plans are you know well I can tell you this ma'am Trump has
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:27.480]  irrevocably damaged globalist political correctness the TPP the WTO their
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:30.840]  their whole system he's bringing power back he's bringing sovereignty back
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:34.280]  doesn't mean he has all the answers or it's perfect he's exposing communist
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:38.880]  China's control of Hollywood and our media that is the big issue that's the
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:42.280]  heart is the sellout to China because they've allied with the globalist so
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:46.800]  Trump is for real bringing America back Trump believes in what he's doing does
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:49.800]  it mean he's perfect does it mean that they can't get to him and no
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:54.720]  absolutely not but I can tell you at a gut level but an intellectual level
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:58.480]  Trump's the real deal that's why you see them completely freaking out that's why
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:01.840]  you see all this craziness this is not business as usual this isn't Carol
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:07.160]  Quigley talking about controlling both parties there's populism exploding
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:11.320]  worldwide because we exposed it and many others exposed the paradigm Michael
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:15.160]  Snyder yeah the reason the Democrats the Republicans all
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:18.880]  establishment hate Trump is because he is the real deal now Trump does have a lot
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:23.040]  of bad people around him that are giving him really he's independent he's the real
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:26.920]  deal he's not with them does it mean he's perfect people don't get what we're
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:30.880]  saying yeah like no he's the real deal folks so he has a lot of people around
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:34.240]  him giving them bad information for example we saw that in Syria we seen
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:37.760]  that in some other situations so we need to get people to Washington that are
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:40.880]  pro-trump that are gonna give him good advice that are gonna be and that's
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:43.840]  one of the reasons we want to go to Washington to be on his side and tell
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:47.880]  him hey Mr. President this is what we need to do so we believe in Trump yeah
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:51.480]  and no one's perfect but but Donald Trump has done so many good things he's
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:54.960]  surrounded by a lot of bad people and he's trying to find good people and
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:59.640]  anybody that's done IT engineering child care it's hard to get good people
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:02.400]  nowadays it is and that's why he's constantly firing people because he's
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:06.400]  trying to sort people through yeah they act like oh he's a loser no that's what
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:10.560]  you do is you go through people yeah and I finally found out about firing people
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:13.920]  quickly everything started getting to the wheel started turning around here we're
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:17.720]  getting a lot got a great crew now and they don't put up with crap you get bad
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:21.520]  cultures it's all a bunch of you know bad people make an excuse to stir up
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:26.040]  probably get a good crew boom you take off yeah so the second half of Trump's
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:29.400]  presidency should be much better once he gets a good crew in there and notice he
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:33.600]  is getting better yeah absolutely and so and we need to get him a better
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:36.880]  Congress now that's why you can get a pro-trump person in Congress and

[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:30.480]  Michael Snyder good friend of mine so to get him columnist educator father he's
[02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:34.840]  running for Congress in Idaho and we're talking about a key paradigm about the
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:38.480]  general election the midterms about waking people up here in a moment that is
[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:43.160]  the keys to victory and your phone calls but first let's stop right there
[02:06:43.160 --> 02:06:48.400]  document cam shot please for TV viewers White House counters China's Orwellian
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:55.400]  disinformation aimed at Americans and finally they had a press conference with
[02:06:55.400 --> 02:07:03.760]  Sarah Huckabee Sanders and they said that 36 US firms have been told that if
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:08.600]  they're gonna do business in China they've got to not recognize Taiwan and
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:14.200]  a button and say they don't make declarations and change their maps and
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:21.080]  have their pilots call it South China Island and it's a bunch of other stuff
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:26.480]  but this is the tip of the iceberg all six major Hollywood firms have a
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:30.880]  controlling interest by the Chinese government three months ago Reuters
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:35.960]  reported Apple officially took China's deal of zero tax they were at 15 we were
[02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:41.800]  at 40 Trump lowered to 15 to be fair China said zero baby but you can go
[02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:47.120]  there as a corporate head pay no taxes love like a king have you know factories
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:50.560]  with suicide nets forced abortion like Apple does as long as you're liberal
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:53.480]  though it's okay as long as you find black lives matter it's okay if you
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:58.480]  know you find any deploys or Christian they get shipped off to a organ
[02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:01.240]  harvesting center I mean that's that's liberal that's that's trendy thank God
[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:04.840]  they're doing it kill those Buddhists as well as quickly as possible but again
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:11.440]  Apple is liberal you mr. Cooks liberals everything's okay but Trump comes out
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:18.360]  and they point out that the University of Texas and other big universities main
[02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:21.600]  international chairs and their science chairs that means whoever chairs the
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:25.040]  department are controlled by the communist Chinese government that's now
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:31.800]  Associated Press Reuters you name it so this is the big infiltration and if
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:35.040]  Trump really wants to get the nitty-gritty there are studies out there on
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:39.640]  the Democrats about 10 to 1 get Chinese money the Democrats sell out to any
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:42.680]  foreign power there is that's why they're American haters first and foremost
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:45.960]  you got to kind of already hate the country to be willing to you know sell
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:50.160]  it out not just kind of go along with it you got to really be into it that's the
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:56.240]  cult and so now she's come out and said stop telling us firms what they've got
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:00.200]  to say and what they've got to do to do business in your country well again we
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:03.160]  have to go to a zero percent corporate tax to counter this and a lot of
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:07.960]  countries have it the individuals still pay some but Apple and Google and
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:12.680]  Facebook and Twitter and all these groups do what they call them double
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:16.680]  Irish and the this and that there's a bunch of different names for it where
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:19.960]  you have your corporation here and you move it the money over there and they
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:24.760]  pay zero tax while they lobby you everywhere you'll be watching you know
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:28.200]  this week on ABC and at the end of the they'll say funded by Berkshire Hathaway
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:32.080]  and a grant by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates they will pay for a whole show
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:37.200]  about how rich people don't pay taxes we need we need to get you know Barack
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:41.560]  Obama reelected stuff like that going back you know six years ago and then
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:45.160]  you watch to the end it's underwritten by the Bill and the Gates Foundation the
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:52.000]  tax exempt so this is their whole agenda folks and China are the ones that have
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:57.160]  taken the country over and if Trump had a real Justice Department they could
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:01.360]  devastate the Chinese right now for espionage and the Democrats that have
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:06.640]  taken the money for 40 years you can take Chinese money and sell the country
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:09.880]  out they have over 10,000 front companies so if you want to roll up the
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:13.240]  Clinton Foundation all of it yeah there's some Russian stuff there too good
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:17.720]  burn them send them to prison sanction the Russians whatever but then
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:23.020]  absolutely you can just dominate the chai comms Michael Steiner you want to
[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:27.960]  comment on that oh absolutely China has been taking advantage of us for decades
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:32.840]  for it for example today a Jeep that's made in the United States cost 27,000
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:37.280]  here will cost more than $80,000 in China because of all the stuff they slap
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:40.240]  on it meanwhile we've been letting them flood our shores with all their cheap
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:44.240]  goods saying oh just come on in Chinese sell all your garbage here and we won't
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:48.120]  put anything on it and so as a result we have a massive trade deficit with China
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:52.440]  our cars have a 25% tariff to go into Europe I know they've been a bitch if
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:57.560]  Trump talks about a 5% I know but we've been taking advantage of we've been the
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:02.320]  suckers and that's why since China joined the WTO in 2001 we've lost 70,000
[02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:05.880]  manufacturing facilities millions of good-paying jobs yeah let's be clear we
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:09.720]  went from a 200 million dollar a year deficit to a 500 billion not counting
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:13.240]  intellectual sense that yeah and China talk about intellectual property
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:17.160]  stealing our intellectual property non-stop nothing's ever done finally we
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:21.080]  have a president that's standing up to China saying okay if you're gonna take
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:24.240]  advantage of us we're gonna slap tariffs on you and then the mainstream media
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:27.760]  says all the world's about to end we're standing up to China we can't do that of
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:30.800]  course China is buying up our farmland our movie theaters our real estate
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:34.680]  they're literally buying up the whole country and so something has got to be
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:38.080]  done because while we've been playing checkers China's been playing chess we
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:42.240]  have Trump president Trump was the only one because the globalist plan was to
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:46.440]  sell America out we were sold out by the globalist yeah this is a deal that's
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:50.640]  why Obama after he left Trump to let Trump left China and Singapore everything
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:54.840]  Obama's right behind the meeting saying don't go along with him yeah and you got
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:59.000]  a shadow government place we're holding on you go to China today all along the
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.480]  coast there especially they got shiny new cities filled with gleaming new
[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:07.240]  factories meanwhile Detroit which once was the greatest manufacturing city in
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:12.720]  the history of mankind is a rotting war zone today you know we've been the
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:16.360]  Chinese never would have been anything this was always the plan to bring us
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:22.120]  down this is the global plan that the CFR all of Hollywood the Chinese century
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:27.360]  that this is the plan this was World War three was economic warfare yeah and
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:31.440]  all that and we sell all of our money to China then we have to beg them to lend it
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:35.240]  back to us so we can pay our bills and so now the Chinese have over a trillion
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:39.120]  dollars of our debt the Chinese are the global center for rare earth elements
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:42.160]  even those areas of this country are swimming in it we're totally and they're
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:45.240]  the area they're the area because they passed laws nobody can mine it to
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:49.560]  leverage us out everything's shut down America we were almost to the end and if
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:51.880]  Trump said anything we got a caller saying she doesn't know if he's really a
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:55.680]  globalist selling itself no he's the real deal but the deals had been so
[02:12:55.680 --> 02:13:00.080]  overrun we've been so oversold out some globalist may have let Trump get in
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:03.680]  there's theories from all of the folks not not that he isn't real but that he'll
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:08.320]  be like kind of a stopgap to do a better deal down the road for the sellout to
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:12.120]  the Chinese and the globalist because our own globalists sold us out so much
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:16.680]  they don't even have a position now to have a checkmate over China to ensure
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:19.840]  that their interests for selling us out are met now if you want the inside
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:24.400]  baseball that's it Trump's been allowed in for just better negotiation tactics
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:28.880]  on the sellout that already happened yeah and China is basically the model for
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:32.280]  the New World Order for population control you know the one-shot policy
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:35.480]  forced abortion and they're the model they're the leverage they're the plan
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:39.520]  that this is it yeah if we don't do something we're gonna become just like
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:43.200]  China you're gonna have a society where every level of your life is micromanaged
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:46.760]  even in China today they started this a population score where they give you a
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:50.560]  score if you get a traffic ticket your score goes down if you're not polite on
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:55.040]  social media your score goes down that they're they're a pioneer and then you
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:58.040]  can't travel then you can't eat then you basically die this is the mark of the
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:04.000]  beast oh it is it is totalitarian system a dystopian nightmare it's here China
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.280]  it's here in China and it's gonna be here in the US if we don't stand up and do
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:10.200]  something right don't fight that's right we're taking call after call we come

[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:33.480]  right to Alexandra and Alex and John and Jordan finish up calls here with the
[02:20:33.480 --> 02:20:38.720]  man running for Congress ladies and gentlemen who is sitting right next to
[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:44.560]  me who I hope can win Michael Schneider we're gonna say who he's running
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:49.560]  against so seven person race he's within a few points of winning the person's
[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:53.080]  supposedly in the lead that's the establishment person but this is a key
[02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:59.320]  thing you wanted to talk about how you have a plan to get 10 people to go out
[02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:03.480]  and vote for Michael Schneider get those 10 to get people to do it if our
[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:07.400]  listeners just keep telling people about info wars calm if they just keep
[02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:10.800]  telling people about the free podcast the video streams are keep sending out
[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:14.840]  the articles every day and don't care what the people say to you on Twitter or
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:18.360]  Facebook or wherever but just continue to get it out or write your own articles
[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:21.560]  about these subjects it will bring the globalists to their knees that's what
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:25.040]  they're scared of they demonetize us to try to make us stop attacking the
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:28.320]  globalists we don't care about that we just went to other funding mechanisms
[02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:32.320]  we're in a war we're not compromising our values should briefly speak to that
[02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:36.080]  yeah Alex I've been studying this because I was studying how do you get
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:39.480]  people to go out and vote and it's the same way getting any message out you
[02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:43.200]  want to get the info wars message out this is the scientifically the very best
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:47.280]  way to get a message out is personal contact especially personal contact from
[02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:51.160]  someone you know that's why we've been telling everyone hey make a list of 10
[02:21:51.160 --> 02:21:55.120]  people your friends your family your co-workers you know people on your email
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:59.160]  list whoever it is everyone knows 10 people go out tell those 10 people go
[02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:02.040]  vote for Michael Snyder for Congress and stay on them till they get back to you
[02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:05.840]  and say yeah actually did that as the same story for other people that you
[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:08.560]  know are good that are running for office yeah yeah this can be done all
[02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:11.640]  around the country wherever you are you need to get involved in the primaries
[02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:16.240]  the elections but yeah wherever you are just tell 10 people get 10 people to go
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:19.880]  vote and then tell those 10 people to get 10 people because everyone knows 10
[02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:24.240]  people and it's that personal contact that is far more effective than anything else
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:27.040]  so many people ask how'd you hear about info wars somebody gave me a business
[02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:30.720]  card with your website on it and even if you don't want to get yelled at by some
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:35.280]  globalist minion be like man they really attacked info wars and Alex Jones I
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:39.360]  wonder why they just are always after me even if it was a horrible person that
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:42.360]  like he's the worst person on earth man I went to a site and I found some
[02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:46.000]  shocking stuff it's forbidden information that's how you do it okay we're going to
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:49.640]  hear calls and some of the calls are hanging up here Alexandra and then

[02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:08.640]  Alexander with US Militia out here in northern Idaho and I actually interviewed
[02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:14.880]  Michael Snyder Michael is a real trooper and you know we've had a lot of
[02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:19.600]  controversy out here in northern Idaho regarding Sherry with readout news I'm
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:23.880]  not I'm just going to go over this real quick this morning I opened up an article
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:29.440]  Sherry had posted about Michael she posted that is the Snyder campaign under
[02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:35.200]  investigation well what happened was Russ Folger's campaign out here out here in
[02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:43.400]  Idaho became under investigation with the with the FDC I end up exposing some
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:48.920]  information out there on our militia page for the whole world to see regarding
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:53.880]  Russ Folger back to 2013 here's the deal I can't really understand you these calls
[02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:57.440]  today I don't know about phone systems going out or what it is but it's like all
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:24:01.160]  just spraying about Michael Snyder's under investigation I appreciate your
[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:04.960]  call do you know what he's talking about oh I do and it's actually a I know John
[02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:08.120]  and he's a hundred percent thanks Alexander's eyes he was trying to
[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:12.520]  clarify something up and what he was trying to clarify is that there's this
[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:16.360]  organization out there hates me because they're with the other campaign and so
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:21.160]  what they did is they had one of their people filed complaint with FEC and then
[02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:24.440]  they took that letter that they sent to FEC and said posted on their website said
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:27.600]  is Michael Snyder under investigation when they are the ones that filed it with
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:32.120]  FEC so and in their in their complaint they didn't say I did anything wrong all
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:36.000]  they said well no it's a classic it's a classic dirty trick but it's meant to
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.480]  get you off talking about it and then you actually repeat it in a psych warfare
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:42.960]  deal exactly yeah and people think they're helping you and they're going
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:45.960]  no Michael's not under criminal investigation exactly but the what you
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:50.120]  need is a stunt to go over the top like some leftist trying to attack you and
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:52.600]  you punch him out or something I'm not calling for violence but that's what we've
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:56.400]  seen in Wyoming Montana is people think that you being an anti-establishment
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:00.040]  it's a bad thing it's a good thing but we do these campaign things for states
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:03.920]  people call in they think inside baseball you know like the color of the
[02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:07.200]  mountain tops at night or something and it just kind of this big audience
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:10.860]  worldwide doesn't know what they're talking about Alex in British Columbia
[02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:14.960]  Canada you're on the air with Michael Snyder go ahead thanks Alex for having
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:18.960]  me on how you doing I'm good brother go ahead okay so I wanted to call you about
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:22.400]  lately I've been like I watch you up and watch New for Years on YouTube and
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:29.040]  lately you look up Alex Jones and it's just it's just holes it's just propaganda
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:32.920]  it's just it's so hard just to even find your channel that's right if you search
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:37.360]  Alex Jones on Google or YouTube it puts about fifty negative hateful lying
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:43.360]  things you maybe you know John Oliver you name it they all force feed that on
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:48.400]  top or if you search it on the App Store Fox News pays they admit which is okay
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:51.880]  to be above me and they do everything they can to bury us that's why you've
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:56.000]  got to go find info wars and then share it but yes that's what they do I mean
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:02.080]  look look they've got Esquire and media matters at the top they've got you know
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:05.800]  just everything at the top that oh Russians are the ones that created the
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:10.000]  Jade Helm conspiracy just and oh and oh and the Texas governor is a Russian
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.080]  agent and it's all just lies and if you scroll down scroll down since we got
[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:20.720]  people watching on TV oh then Wikipedia and all its disinfo and then oh boom
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:24.920]  info wars is like the sixth or seventh link down so yes that's what they do but
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:29.000]  if you go to YouTube especially they put like 50 negative videos on top against
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.720]  us yeah no and it's just disgusting and and you know I know everything with this
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:37.520]  Mueller probe is going on and it's really imploding and I'm just waiting to see
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:42.880]  the FISA judges come out and say hey listen you know why did you guys give us
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:47.000]  this information knowing that Hillary Clinton had paid for it knowing that
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:50.920]  it's totally bogus totally fraud right that this is you know Lionel's been
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:54.200]  saying this for a few weeks probably for you months now saying that where are the
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:57.600]  FISA judges it's good to see these federal judges like Alice come out and say
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:01.240]  hey this is clearly you're just looking to impeach Trump this has nothing to do
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:05.600]  with matter for 15 years ago whoa what is this even about but we need those
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:09.640]  what once those FISA judges come out it's gonna be huge because they're gonna
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:13.360]  be able to turn this whole thing around and it's it's and it's happening it's
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:16.200]  happening God bless you and again I wasn't mad at the last caller I just
[02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:21.280]  couldn't understand them and it's just nothing drives me crazier than just I
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:24.040]  don't want to jump off a cliff not literally they're throwing off a cliff
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:27.080]  tonight and say I wanted to do it thank you Alex great points John in
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:31.000]  Wisconsin last caller here for Michael Snyder running for Congress District 1
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.800]  Idaho go ahead
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:39.560]  let's try again yeah I can hear a little bit of distorted audio again go
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:44.800]  ahead I said Michael I said I hope you win and I you got my back and I wish I
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:49.040]  live in your state I'd go for you absolutely oh well thank you for your
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:51.720]  support and you know what we're hearing from people all over the country you've
[02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:56.160]  gotten behind us and and that's why if you know anyone in Idaho get involved
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:27:58.600]  and but wherever you live in the country you can go to Michael Snyder for
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:02.600]  congress.com you can donate help us make this big final push because we need
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:05.720]  some help getting some mailers and doing some last-minute things out there so
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:09.320]  guys that this is the opportunity we have an opportunity to win this open
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:11.760]  seat because usually when you're running for Congress you're running against a
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:15.120]  very powerful incumbent who's already in there but in this case the incumbents
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:19.200]  moving on to run for governor so totally open seat totally open race we have
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:22.280]  whoever wins the primary the Democrats always lose there so this is the
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:26.120]  election there this is the election on May 15 John sorry about a time love you but
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:29.360]  at least we got to you thank you so much I'm gonna check our phone system I
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:32.240]  don't think the calls all have this bad an audio because I can't really

[02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:17.280]  respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France notice that people

[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:44.320]  actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that
[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:49.040]  amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and

[02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:37.960]  you know I've been aware of Vox Day's work for five six years he's a best-selling
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:43.080]  author of SJW is always lying SJW is always double down I've noticed that
[02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:47.720]  they never give up even though they're crazy people he's the lead editor of a
[02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:52.880]  bunch of well-known comics he's also a game and technology designer and is the
[02:33:52.880 --> 02:34:00.040]  creator of infogalactic the SJW free alternative to Wikipedia VoxVersity.com
[02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:04.280]  got a lot of the great websites as well voxday.blogspot.com
[02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:10.040]  everybody knows I'm not an infighter I don't fight libertarians I don't fight
[02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:15.520]  nationalist I don't fight capitalist I don't fight patriots I don't go after
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:20.160]  atheists that you know aren't trying to ban people's free speech I don't go
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:24.160]  after liberals classical liberals I see myself as really a Jeffersonian liberal
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:27.520]  I don't go as far as the French Revolution the Illuminati but because
[02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:30.600]  you know their plan was to take the whole liberal movement and flip it into
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:35.120]  total tyranny if you study the Jacobin plan but I've also noticed that I wait
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:40.360]  too long with people like you know the guy that took over Breitbart when I knew
[02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:44.440]  from good sources he was bad news I sat on the information because I didn't want
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:47.360]  to be an infighter it's just holier than now thing I'm talking about Stephen
[02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:54.240]  Bannon and now I have sat there and I've watched Glenn Beck go to Fox News do the
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:57.880]  book deals do everything he did I was offered that exact position about a year
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:02.680]  before Beck showed up basically the very same people I'll leave it at that Fox
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:05.760]  News offered me shows all of it they wanted to control what I was gonna say
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:09.800]  just like you go to the app store on Apple and my stuff's free but the Fox News
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:13.320]  apps are on top of me and it says advertisement they follow me everywhere
[02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:16.960]  but claim I want to be with them no that's not true I want to build my own
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:22.120]  thing but so many stations would say we can we've got to drop you Glenn Beck is
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:26.520]  gonna leave Sinclair Channel says you can't be on here if we have Glenn Beck
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:31.480]  and then Glenn Beck was always getting my sponsors and in my business and then
[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:36.400]  I learned that Ben Shapiro is coming in trying to buy up the remnants of that
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:41.600]  with these Texas billionaires who aren't bad guys by the way some pastors who
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:44.280]  worked their own built their own big fracking company they're worth about
[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:47.800]  three billion dollars total and then I learned behind the scenes he's in my
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:50.240]  business again and I learned that he was a lawyer and all this other stuff
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:53.840]  a talk radio network and I learned some stuff from Michael Savage and just it
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:57.640]  gets crazy so and then I noticed how mainstream media force feeds him
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:03.440]  constantly and I noticed how we get force-fed Jordan Peterson and I like a
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:07.280]  lot of what Peterson says but you can't miss that they don't get censored they
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:11.800]  get force-fed they go on all the shows which is fine but then when you get in
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:16.160]  my business and tell people don't come on my show and then I'm bad and I'm evil
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:19.280]  and you promote fake New York Times articles about me and it seems like your
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:22.840]  job is coming after me I'm not putting up with Glenn Beck part 2 where I put up
[02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:26.840]  with six seven years of his crap before I unloaded on him and he went under and
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:29.520]  he destroyed himself so I'm gonna shut up it's only got him for this segment one
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:33.840]  others maybe do five minutes the next hour but Vox Day joins us because Daria
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:38.360]  pointed out you know Vox Day destroys these guys and he's got all the inside
[02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:41.840]  baseball as well because it needs to be done I'm gonna stop attacking them after
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:45.360]  I've done this I might get Michael Savage on it about it too just to kind of
[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:50.440]  mark a buoy in the lake that hey there's rocks right here watch out and to let
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:56.680]  these cynical arrogant people know I'm self-made you're not Vox Day self-made
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:02.160]  you're not get out of our way so Vox Day thanks for coming on with us you're
[02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:06.120]  welcome that's kind of my little three four minute intro and we can cover the
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:09.840]  battlefield here but I know we don't like to invite but I mean you're kind of an
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:15.680]  expert on the Shapiro guy well I call the two of them Tweedle fake and Tweedle
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:22.760]  faker the reality of Ben Shapiro is that he was made back when he was a little
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:31.040]  kid and I was at World Nut Daily at the time and he was just a little kid
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:37.960]  regurgitating Republican Party talking points and he actually had a crisis of
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:42.920]  confidence after a couple years of doing that and emailed me and said hey you
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:47.480]  know what should I do should I keep doing this and I had encouraged him to go
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:52.640]  off and and really go off on his own you know figure out what you believe what
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:59.960]  do you think is right but it became very clear back in the around the time of the
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:05.800]  Iraqi war that he made the wrong decision and you know I published a column
[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:10.120]  called the littlest chicken hawk because what he was doing was saying that it was
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:17.160]  the most important thing for us to go and fight that war but he wasn't willing
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:19.840]  to go and do it himself despite the fact that he was about 18 years old at the
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:25.600]  time and that's when I realized that you know this is a guy who is is not
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:29.520]  intellectually honest he's a guy who doesn't have any personal integrity and
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:36.720]  what he's attempting to do is get other young men to go and fight and die in
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:41.720]  his place and and that's not right and what we've seen since then is that
[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:49.120]  Ben Shapiro along with Jordan Peterson are essentially there to replace William
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:55.800]  F. Buckley you know now conservatism has failed it's no longer possible for them
[02:38:55.800 --> 02:39:01.920]  to read out the Sam Francis's the Papu cannons the Joe Sobrans and the Alex
[02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:08.440]  Jones from the right because the neoliberal the neoliberal world order
[02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:11.440]  has failed multiculturalism has failed
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:16.800]  neo-conservatism has failed and so they're trying to come up with a way to
[02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:21.720]  keep the right on the reservation and that's what Ben Shapiro is doing in the
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:26.040]  world of politics and that's what Jordan Peterson is doing in the world of philosophy
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:32.080]  Oh absolutely and I get so busy just focused on the big picture of the 40,000
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:36.360]  foot view that that that then I just ignored these two and thought well
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:39.000]  they're a little more establishment liberal but at least you know they're
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.520]  getting out there but then you see the force feeding of them by mainstream media
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:47.480]  and then the counterfeit always tries to destroy the real thing and I'm not
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:51.400]  saying I'm perfect but let me tell you baby I'm myself and everybody knows it
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:55.320]  and these guys just especially Shapiro but I could see they come together like
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:59.120]  two peas in a pod are in my business so so that's why I mean it's just
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:05.280]  incredible how they just think they're God or he thinks he's God well I think
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:13.600]  that Shapiro is pretty basic Shapiro wants to be a media star and you know
[02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:18.160]  that's what he's focused on he's actually less relevant than Jordan Peterson
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:26.400]  Oh I agree Jordan Peterson is smarter Jordan Peterson has a bigger organic
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:31.840]  audience you know Shapiro's is mostly generated from the outside Peterson's
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:37.640]  is actually mostly legitimate I totally agree he's got a lot of talent in his
[02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:43.080]  own right he's the more dangerous of the two but the problem is that Peterson's
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:49.680]  philosophy which I call Jordanetics is ultimately anti-Christian it's poisonous
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:54.360]  and it's riddled from start to finish with mental illness I mean it it's what
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:59.280]  he is what happens when you cross Bill Crystal with Elron Hubbard and give it a
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:06.440]  PhD absolutely please keep breaking it down because man I started looking at
[02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:11.160]  video him close up in his eyes and you can't fake that I mean he looks like he
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:17.040]  is wound up well Jordanetics was created to replace the failure of the new
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:22.720]  atheism and the neoliberal world order and so there's three components to the
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:28.440]  West the European nations the Greco-Roman legacy and Christianity Jordan
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:33.200]  Peterson is explicitly opposed to two of the three and he ignores the other one
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:36.920]  you know what a lot of people don't realize is that Peterson was a card
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:41.240]  carrying socialist himself just like urban crystal in the original neocons and
[02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:49.440]  and you know the influence that he cites Nietzsche Freud Young and Darwin
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:54.760]  they're the source of the problem that we're facing today they're not part of
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:42:01.040]  the solution and that's why Jordanetics is an incoherent cargo cult of crazy
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:07.000]  what's it got you know dishonesty hypocrisy and moral failure is hidden
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:12.680]  behind this huge fog of incoherency well that's right anybody who's read Carl
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:16.520]  Young it's very sexy a lot of it's true but then where it leads you is very
[02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:19.600]  destructive we probably talk about that but Star Wars and the whole new age
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:23.600]  movement is a launch of that and they act like it's something new it's it's
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:27.320]  very ancient as you know as a smart guy who studied history and so I just
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:30.320]  hadn't made enough attention to this and so but I didn't see these two guys
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:34.240]  getting together to take over the Glenn Beck operation or reason I know is they
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:39.400]  offered me to buy the blaze I try to get me to buy his $25 million a year cable
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:44.120]  channel no I don't have that money anyways but it's like but these two have
[02:42:44.120 --> 02:42:48.480]  got the Texas money now and so it's like having the two move into Texas on me
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:51.960]  which I've heard the words gonna happen I just don't think I can handle it we'll

[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:57.560]  financing most of the conservative websites and news none of them except
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:03.280]  world that daily where our colleagues and works before vox day is actually
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:06.520]  operating on its own selling books and things like that we do the same thing
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:12.480]  here in info wars drudge is self-made as well and I'm not bashing folks that
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:16.360]  got some help somewhere it's just that there's always something twisted about
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:20.720]  it because they're always following somebody else's blueprint and they're
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:27.640]  always seeking to then get rid of the organic movement and that's why I get
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:32.760]  angry is that I want to be left alone and be able to do my own operation I've
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:36.080]  already got Hillary after me I've already got you know the globalist after me I've
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:40.160]  already got all that stuff and I really want to win this fight but see the real
[02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:43.840]  way to attack us is be the opposition so they're posing that they're the
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:47.000]  libertarians they're the nationalists and with vox day is saying he's me with
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:50.680]  us 50 months next hour and then Matt Bracken's going to join us is so on
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:53.600]  target when you've read the history books the facts and everything he's
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:58.360]  saying I'm ashamed that I've let Peterson sneak up on me and all the rest of
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:01.880]  it because I've been so busy it's it's people quote in our movement we've got
[02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:05.120]  to watch out for because when you see them being worshipped on all the
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:09.240]  channels and you see you know Atlantic Monthly the establishment left this
[02:49:09.240 --> 02:49:13.400]  publication worshipping Peterson and making him a victim of the left you can
[02:49:13.400 --> 02:49:17.240]  see that this is how they think they're coming in to take over I don't want to
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:21.040]  say Peterson's a bad guy maybe he doesn't know this maybe he doesn't
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:26.000]  understand it but I know that when he's on these other shows and I might say
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.800]  this about him because he hasn't come on the show we've put out feelers and stuff
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:33.000]  and he hasn't come on that just shows you know that he's at least scared of
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:37.600]  this information doesn't want to get boycotted whatever or he actively with
[02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:41.200]  the people he works with doesn't want to in his view as the leftist do with
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:44.800]  their no platforming elevators we're already quite elevated thank you over
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:48.680]  a thousand articles today attacking us but getting past info wars vox day got
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:52.240]  the floor in this segment the next to to really break down those three branches
[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:56.280]  of western civilization how the attacks happening and how he thinks we can
[02:49:56.280 --> 02:50:00.840]  hopefully turn this around but I do understand now that this is the new
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:04.680]  constellation of attack where they're already making everything godless so
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:08.160]  now they're going to come in with kind of a Carl Jung reboot so please break it
[02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:14.240]  down for us author of SJW is always lie well the thing that people are
[02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:20.000]  beginning to understand is the way that SJW is infiltrate institutions you know
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  we've seen it happen with the colleges we've seen it happen in the
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:29.720]  corporations now we're seeing it happen in the open source what a lot of people
[02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:35.080]  don't understand is that a similar process often takes place on the right
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:43.440]  and the way that you can usually tell is when somebody is being actively pushed
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:49.280]  and elevated I'll give you an example I was nationally syndicated by universal
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:53.640]  press syndicate they wanted me to be the replacement for William Willie math
[02:50:53.640 --> 02:50:59.920]  Buckley which is kind of ironic but at the same time or a few months later
[02:50:59.920 --> 02:51:05.360]  Shapiro was syndicated by creator syndicate and what creators did in
[02:51:05.360 --> 02:51:11.120]  order to get him into all the newspapers was that they told the papers that well
[02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:16.560]  if you want our desirable columns you have to take you know this column and
[02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:21.040]  that column and so that's why you tend to see these people come in out of
[02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:25.360]  nowhere and then suddenly blow up it's because they're being packaged as a
[02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:32.120]  deal with the desirable columnist I tried to talk the exact same thing with
[02:51:32.120 --> 02:51:35.240]  with with clear channel on all these deals that's exactly how they operate
[02:51:35.240 --> 02:51:41.600]  it's exactly so you know who the systems force feeding exactly and and beyond
[02:51:41.600 --> 02:51:47.200]  that you can also tell because the left-wing media and the mainstream media
[02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:54.880]  is willing to allow them to be the official opposition and they do that
[02:51:54.880 --> 02:52:00.600]  because in one way or another these individuals are serving the mainstream
[02:52:00.600 --> 02:52:05.320]  narrative now it doesn't have to not these people are not all the same for
[02:52:05.320 --> 02:52:10.800]  example Richard Spencer served the mainstream narrative in one way Ben
[02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:16.120]  Shapiro and Jordan Peterson served the narrative in a very different way you
[02:52:16.120 --> 02:52:19.400]  know a lot of people don't understand but when the alt-right first came on to
[02:52:19.400 --> 02:52:24.360]  the scene I got contacted by the New York Times I got contacted by all these
[02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:31.680]  major mainstream news institutions and what was fascinating was that they
[02:52:31.680 --> 02:52:37.320]  never ever ran any of the interviews with me they never ran any of the
[02:52:37.320 --> 02:52:40.680]  questions and answers same thing with me they're only getting intel I want you
[02:52:40.680 --> 02:52:43.920]  to get to why you think that was but let me just back up what you're saying they
[02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:47.440]  use the alt-right that they fund and control that Hillary defined to then
[02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:50.440]  demonize the entire conservative libertarian nationalist movement as
[02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:54.680]  racist they then use a Shapiro that they build up to then gatekeep and second
[02:52:54.680 --> 02:52:58.560]  that everybody else is bad but them it's a pincer attack so they use their
[02:52:58.560 --> 02:53:02.760]  their their stage right-wing racist then they have their their you know their
[02:53:02.760 --> 02:53:09.400]  their elevated loving right over here to then agree with the media and say
[02:53:09.400 --> 02:53:14.040]  we're bad and and then say that those of us that are real patriots are really
[02:53:14.040 --> 02:53:17.880]  actually the alt-right is that where you were going yeah that's exactly right and
[02:53:17.880 --> 02:53:23.000]  the thing is it's not even a new program if you look at the history of it you can
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:30.440]  see that Richard Spencer is David Duke you can see that Ben Shapiro is William
[02:53:30.440 --> 02:53:35.720]  is the sort of William F. Buckley now quantify that the listeners may not know
[02:53:35.720 --> 02:53:40.480]  that they declassify the National Review was CIA funded just like Ms. Magazine
[02:53:40.480 --> 02:53:45.600]  and that the Trotskyites that were then marooned in in Mexico then came to the
[02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:50.200]  US quote turned against the Soviet Union but were actually taken into the
[02:53:50.200 --> 02:53:53.200]  Central Intelligence Agency and then repurposed to go take over the
[02:53:53.200 --> 02:53:57.200]  conservative movement that's all declassified yeah and and you see that
[02:53:57.200 --> 02:54:01.720]  with Jordan Peterson as well he says in his book he was a card-carrying
[02:54:01.720 --> 02:54:07.240]  socialist very active in the socialist movement during college and you know he
[02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:11.200]  claims to have had this epiphany after having all of these horrific dreams and
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:20.600]  so forth but the reality is is that he is actively attempting to try to keep the
[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:25.280]  right from moving too far right what he is attempting to do is is he is
[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:31.000]  attempting to provide an alternative to the growing number of people who want a
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:38.080]  return to the values of 1950s America to want to return who want to return to
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:42.920]  the values of white Christian America and they know that wave is unstoppable so
[02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:48.400]  they're going to hijack it with a new watered-down controlled opposition to
[02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:52.080]  then grab all that momentum in a judo move and steal it and then once they've
[02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:57.280]  got control use that wave to crush the real movement well I think that's the
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:02.360]  plan I think that it is very obvious that it's not working very well simply
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:06.440]  because over here in Europe the nationalist parties are absolutely
[02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:12.040]  crushing the neoliberal parties you know in some of the European nations the
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:17.800]  left barely even exists anymore and the only thing that is allowing the
[02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:21.960]  neoliberals to stay in control in the United States is the two-party system
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:27.760]  but Donald Trump has broken that and so I think that in the United States we're
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:32.880]  seeing a nexus of the sort that we saw when the Republicans replaced the wave
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:37.520]  party and that's why you're seeing people like Jennifer Rubin and people like
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:42.120]  Ben Shapiro and people like Ben Crystal claiming that they're gonna leave the
[02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:45.560]  Republican Party and start this third party because what they do not want is
[02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:50.600]  they do not want the Republicans or a third party to turn into the American
[02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:53.560]  nation and again that's how it works in America you don't get a third party one
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:57.400]  of the old parties dies and a new one takes it over so they're reversing what
[02:55:57.400 --> 02:56:01.120]  we're organically doing threatening to do that again to try to derail us that's
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:08.000]  going to fail oh there's no question I think that the Evan McMillan disaster
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:16.120]  that Bill Crystal created demonstrates how inept this strategy is and the thing
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:20.880]  that you have to keep in mind is that these are just people they are as
[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:25.320]  fallible as anyone else they make mistakes like anyone else you know I
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:30.840]  just finished reading Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules of Life an antidote to chaos and
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:37.480]  it's absolutely nuts you know that it's got these sort of basic you know clean
[02:56:37.480 --> 02:56:42.920]  your room stand up straight all that sort of thing well what good is a clean
[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:48.920]  room in Rome going to do when Alaric the Goth is sacking your city you know what
[02:56:48.920 --> 02:56:56.040]  good is is standing up straight going to do when the Turks are crossing the
[02:56:56.040 --> 02:57:04.000]  border and and beheading everyone you know if you look at their response to
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:08.720]  the current historical situation in the West it's so inadequate as to be a
[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:12.200]  category error it's like dog training I was reading your articles it's like dog
[02:57:12.200 --> 02:57:15.600]  training they're telling us to like like we're mental patients go through dog
[02:57:15.600 --> 02:57:18.840]  training that conservatives are supposed to get a blueprint for the mental
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:21.960]  patient left don't we're competent we don't need to be taught how to wipe our
[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:28.400]  ass by Jordan Peterson we certainly don't and there was a remarkable thing is
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:36.520]  that the amount of disinformation and the amount of false let's talk about it
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:39.960]  Vox Day amazing and why hasn't Vox Day been on this guy's awesome we'll be
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:42.920]  right back with Vox Day we read his stuff for years good job the producers

[03:00:15.120 --> 03:00:18.440]  former Navy SEAL getting into the false flag dangers of how they're gonna try to
[03:00:18.440 --> 03:00:23.960]  stop Trump Vox Day was just getting into Jordan Peterson and since he's being
[03:00:23.960 --> 03:00:28.560]  force-fed all the mainstream media who claims he has this you know background
[03:00:28.560 --> 03:00:32.280]  where he got censored by the University but now the mainstream media just force
[03:00:32.280 --> 03:00:36.160]  feeding him as a second coming of Christ well okay that's good then let's look at
[03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:40.760]  what he's actually saying now he's got these 12 rules of you know how to
[03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:44.760]  basically live in the prison ward and Vox Day dissects it then we'll get into
[03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:47.720]  where he thinks they're gonna counter strike in the next segment so Vox
[03:00:47.720 --> 03:00:52.680]  please continue you just got cut off well I was talking about the 12 rules of
[03:00:52.680 --> 03:01:01.320]  life and the key thing to understand there is that it's a it's a very limited
[03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:06.880]  example of Jordan Peterson's philosophy and you can't understand the full
[03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:11.920]  extent of the philosophy until you read the maps of meaning as well but what
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:15.400]  was I was really surprised to see that a lot of people think that the man is a
[03:01:15.400 --> 03:01:19.600]  Christian or that the man is somebody who's on the right wing a lot of people
[03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:23.160]  have said oh why are you attacking Jordan Peterson you know don't in fight
[03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:28.120]  don't don't punch right in that sort of thing and it was kind of astonishing
[03:01:28.120 --> 03:01:34.320]  because you know the guy is well to the left of every single yeah he's to the
[03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:39.120]  left of Jeb Bush he's to the left of practically anyone you can name who's
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:42.800]  gotten are after their name and yet people have this idea that because he
[03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:48.520]  tells you to clean your room and because he got into it with you know some
[03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:52.800]  Canadian SJWs that he's on our side he says there's two genders so we praise
[03:01:52.800 --> 03:01:56.920]  him like he discovered it and this is rocket science oh it's a liberal that
[03:01:56.920 --> 03:02:00.480]  finally agrees with us and then now he'll be our new leader I don't get how
[03:02:00.480 --> 03:02:04.400]  Christian right wing money out of Texas is funding Ben Shapiro when he's not
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:07.400]  even a Christian and now he's bringing Peterson in that but that's a question for
[03:02:07.400 --> 03:02:14.880]  later please continue so I looked very closely at what he was writing about and
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:19.920]  the interesting thing is and what really attracted my attention at first you can
[03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:24.160]  always tell a charlatan because they always redefine the terms it doesn't
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:26.120]  matter whether you doesn't matter whether you're talking about Richard
[03:02:26.120 --> 03:02:32.040]  Dawkins whether you're talking about Sam Harris they always redefine commonly
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:38.280]  used terms that everybody understands in order to try to snow you and Peterson
[03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:43.480]  does this to an extent that even Sam Harris couldn't believe there's a really
[03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:47.000]  amusing debate between the two of them where basically they spend two hours
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:53.080]  arguing about what truth is and it's really really eye-opening to see how
[03:02:53.080 --> 03:02:57.760]  Peterson essentially comes out there doesn't essentially actually comes out
[03:02:57.760 --> 03:03:02.440]  and says that truth is not truth and so what you're dealing with is somebody
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:07.600]  who's not even a moral relativist but is functionally an existential relativist
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:14.520]  and his theology such as it is is essentially that of Alistair Crowley
[03:03:14.520 --> 03:03:20.480]  now Alistair Crowley of course do is very well is the whole law yeah exactly
[03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:28.520]  Peterson has a vaguely worded nebulous version of that that says exactly the
[03:03:28.520 --> 03:03:33.880]  same truth the same thing you know the truth is your truth you have to create
[03:03:33.880 --> 03:03:38.680]  your own heart beating a baby you know isn't living we don't kill babies we
[03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:43.840]  just kill babies it's this shit's I mean what it is is insanity oh it's
[03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:48.560]  absolutely insanity and and the thing that really struck me I mean I noticed
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:53.400]  it immediately immediately about Peterson I even did a little periscope
[03:03:53.400 --> 03:03:58.600]  about it before I'd read his book or anything I said you know this guy is the
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:02.600]  crazy Christ I mean he has a messiah complex he actually wrote to his father
[03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:08.360]  and said that he had a idea that no one had ever thought before and it was so
[03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:12.440]  big that he was having trouble articulating it and and then what he ends
[03:04:12.440 --> 03:04:20.280]  up coming out with is this half-baked hodgepodge of references that read like
[03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:25.320]  James Joyce's stream of consciousness you know really what it is this kind of
[03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:30.200]  the Vatican's universal world whatever it's just it's it's it's it's a
[03:04:30.200 --> 03:04:37.800]  nut house it is a nut house and it's not a surprise that the second rule the
[03:04:37.800 --> 03:04:42.120]  second most important rule of life according to Jordan Peterson is take
[03:04:42.120 --> 03:04:48.320]  your pills now that is not an indication hold on we gotta go to break back in
[03:04:48.320 --> 03:04:53.000]  60 seconds that sounds like the slogan from THX 113A not not this big guy you

[03:06:21.360 --> 03:06:24.840]  globalist media attacking me attacking Trump that's how you know we're real
[03:06:24.840 --> 03:06:28.200]  doesn't mean we're perfect but we're not from the power structure the whole
[03:06:28.200 --> 03:06:32.200]  world that nationalism is waking up and spreading they're panicking they don't
[03:06:32.200 --> 03:06:37.000]  know what to do so we have a very special guest joining us vox day yes
[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:41.280]  vox versity I'll tell us about that I've read one of his books shw is always
[03:06:41.280 --> 03:06:44.880]  lying I haven't read shw is always double down but they do I'm gonna
[03:06:44.880 --> 03:06:49.680]  briefly ask him before we go any further about that and then I want to go back
[03:06:49.680 --> 03:06:54.400]  to the you know these 12 rules of life of Jordan Peterson rule number two take
[03:06:54.400 --> 03:07:00.880]  your pills sounds like a prozac advertisement please continue vox well
[03:07:00.880 --> 03:07:06.160]  like I said if one of the most important rules of life is to remember to take
[03:07:06.160 --> 03:07:13.560]  your pills and the justification for it is that you are not too ashamed naked
[03:07:13.560 --> 03:07:20.160]  ugly and worthless to be worthy of taking your pills and that is the actual
[03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:25.600]  argument from the book it's clear that we're not dealing with somebody who is
[03:07:25.600 --> 03:07:32.760]  mentally well we're not dealing with a philosopher whose philosophy is based
[03:07:32.760 --> 03:07:37.040]  on the beautiful the good and the true we're dealing with somebody who is
[03:07:37.040 --> 03:07:42.320]  fundamentally unbalanced and fearful and if you read maps of meaning you can
[03:07:42.320 --> 03:07:46.360]  see that you're dealing with a philosophy of fear and that is the exact
[03:07:46.360 --> 03:07:50.880]  opposite of the Christian philosophy as as Christians know we are not given a
[03:07:50.880 --> 03:07:57.040]  spirit of fear so I think that those who think that Jordan Peterson is doing
[03:07:57.040 --> 03:08:03.080]  good work simply do not understand the nature of his work and do not understand
[03:08:03.080 --> 03:08:09.560]  that getting someone to clean their room doesn't do any good when the devil's
[03:08:09.560 --> 03:08:13.920]  entering in and and there's something about the left it worships the left hand
[03:08:13.920 --> 03:08:18.840]  path it worships being disturbed it worships the you know the heroin head
[03:08:18.840 --> 03:08:23.200]  tranny who's having convulsions on the side of the street I mean I've watched
[03:08:23.200 --> 03:08:30.760]  this in Austin what is the theme from your deep research vox day behind this
[03:08:30.760 --> 03:08:36.240]  well the theme is the same as it always is we must replace God we must become as
[03:08:36.240 --> 03:08:42.680]  gods you know that was that's the sources Nietzsche the intellectual sources
[03:08:42.680 --> 03:08:48.920]  Nietzsche and the problem that they have is they want a Christian Western
[03:08:48.920 --> 03:08:54.640]  society but they want to have it without Jesus Christ they want to have the fruit
[03:08:54.640 --> 03:09:00.480]  of the tree while they cut the tree down now we know that's not possible but
[03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:07.120]  they refuse to accept it they want the state to be Christ I actually think
[03:09:07.120 --> 03:09:12.000]  that they I think that they want Christ to not exist I think that they want to
[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:18.200]  eat the apple and they want to become as gods and they don't want any intermediary
[03:09:18.200 --> 03:09:22.800]  between you know Jesus Christ is the intermediary between man and God they
[03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:27.040]  want to be gods themselves so that means necessarily they have to kill God and
[03:09:27.040 --> 03:09:31.440]  they have to kill Jesus Christ and and then they can become as gods but of
[03:09:31.440 --> 03:09:35.720]  course we know that that's never gonna happen and if there's natural order they
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:38.600]  don't ever build something beautiful and incredible they can't they just steal
[03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:42.960]  stuff they always worship something fallen because they're actually worshiping
[03:09:42.960 --> 03:09:46.960]  the opposite of order and beauty so they can't ever produce anything good but
[03:09:46.960 --> 03:09:51.160]  rack and ruin so they try to pull down the beautiful or occupy it but then
[03:09:51.160 --> 03:09:56.000]  always end up basically burning it down I mean it really is just madness it's
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:59.480]  just insanity I mean why would the left want to be like Venezuela or Cuba or
[03:09:59.480 --> 03:10:03.920]  North Korea why the kids were $200 skinny jeans and have $1,000 smartphones
[03:10:03.920 --> 03:10:07.760]  and pull up in fancy cars to put on communist bandanas and go out and beat
[03:10:07.760 --> 03:10:11.000]  up you know people at a pro-gun rally because they existentially at a
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:17.240]  spiritual level hate God well we're seeing exactly that right now in the
[03:10:17.240 --> 03:10:21.400]  comics industry you know in the comics industry they're turning Wolverine into
[03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:25.240]  a woman they're turning you know this they're turning one superhero gay they're
[03:10:25.240 --> 03:10:29.120]  turning another one evil they're making them all ugly though the women they're
[03:10:29.120 --> 03:10:32.640]  they're they're making their breasts smaller and giving them haircuts and
[03:10:32.640 --> 03:10:37.280]  putting them in mom jeans all of this is the same it's the same process that
[03:10:37.280 --> 03:10:41.560]  we've seen in architecture it doesn't matter what the field is it doesn't
[03:10:41.560 --> 03:10:46.760]  matter how small it is yeah we started a new a new comics line it's called
[03:10:46.760 --> 03:10:50.560]  archaven and we've got some new comics coming out called alt hero and the
[03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:56.560]  reason is because so many people kept asking me hey look they're ruining these
[03:10:56.560 --> 03:11:00.920]  comics that I love can you please do something and so after three years of
[03:11:00.920 --> 03:11:06.160]  people asking me that I finally did that you mentioned box diversity a couple
[03:11:06.160 --> 03:11:11.160]  times you know I looked at what Stefan Malin you was doing you know Stefan does
[03:11:11.160 --> 03:11:16.960]  these great videos and they're very effective and you know I'm a writer so
[03:11:16.960 --> 03:11:21.600]  I tend to prefer books to to video but a lot of people just said hey look we
[03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:26.800]  really want you to produce these videos so we we opened up you know a free
[03:11:26.800 --> 03:11:31.360]  starter which is basically like Kickstarter and only only there's no
[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:38.040]  SJW is controlling it and so now we're making videos like the what the West
[03:11:38.040 --> 03:11:42.680]  needs to survive what the nature of the West is we're doing stuff on the last
[03:11:42.680 --> 03:11:50.240]  closet which is about the way that pagan families tend to abuse their children
[03:11:50.240 --> 03:11:54.200]  it's it's actually an autobiography called the last closet super it's really
[03:11:54.200 --> 03:11:57.040]  powerful again why do pagan families into abuser children so much that's
[03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:00.560]  well-known even in sociology because it's an act of their religion to hurt
[03:12:00.560 --> 03:12:07.880]  the innocent exactly I mean that the there's a theory that in in China for
[03:12:07.880 --> 03:12:14.200]  example that if a dog is in pain when it's killed first when it's slaughtered
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:21.480]  for food it tastes better and that's why you see evil constantly praying on the
[03:12:21.480 --> 03:12:24.800]  innocent you know one of the things that I've said is that an absolute
[03:12:24.800 --> 03:12:31.720]  heuristic for a philosophy being evil is does it somehow rationalize justify or
[03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:37.280]  excuse having sex with children if you see even a set if you catch even a whiff
[03:12:37.280 --> 03:12:44.040]  of that you know that it's a philosophy of evil and and that's what I noticed
[03:12:44.040 --> 03:12:52.400]  immediately about Jordan Peterson's philosophy is that it was essentially a
[03:12:52.400 --> 03:13:00.200]  philosophy that stated God was dead and that was encouraging people to replace
[03:13:00.200 --> 03:13:05.680]  him and and once you see that you all you know what you're gonna find you know
[03:13:05.680 --> 03:13:09.840]  which when you dig deep enough eventually you're gonna get to that do as
[03:13:09.840 --> 03:13:13.200]  that well it shall be the whole of the law eventually you're gonna get to the
[03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:21.040]  Luciferian non-servium that's right I have articles that just came out AP
[03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:25.520]  climate skeptics more eco-friendly than climate alarmist other big studies left
[03:13:25.520 --> 03:13:31.200]  60 more times likely to steal nine times more likely not to give the charity but
[03:13:31.200 --> 03:13:35.440]  they're way more likely to virtue signal and tell you how great they are
[03:13:35.440 --> 03:13:44.520]  lazy uncreative stupid bad people that lust for power even though once they
[03:13:44.520 --> 03:13:46.880]  get the power everything falls apart because they don't actually want to
[03:13:46.880 --> 03:13:50.680]  run anything they have no responsibility they want all the power with
[03:13:50.680 --> 03:13:54.200]  none of the responsibility well that's something else you'll notice about
[03:13:54.200 --> 03:14:02.000]  these I call them approved opposition figures they're constantly writing
[03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:09.640]  articles and columns about how to fix the left they're never actually taking
[03:14:09.640 --> 03:14:14.000]  the battle to the left they're constantly saying oh you know you you better
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:18.280]  watch out you're not gonna like it if you keep doing what you're doing you know
[03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:23.080]  it's it's it's the same column you know the columns they write it like leftists
[03:14:23.080 --> 03:14:25.960]  I mean Shapiro sends out New York Times fake news articles about me going look
[03:14:25.960 --> 03:14:29.680]  Jones is mean Jones is stupid and he goes and he talks about how
[03:14:29.680 --> 03:14:33.880]  intellectually is and has his writers right about how what a genius he is it's
[03:14:33.880 --> 03:14:37.560]  very immature that's what I'm saying is and then now it's being put out before
[03:14:37.560 --> 03:14:41.800]  us to be the opposition leaders and to police us and like you said start the
[03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:45.760]  interview I don't think it's going well what do they do as everybody rejects
[03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:53.080]  them well I think that they're going to make yet another another attempt you
[03:14:53.080 --> 03:15:00.280]  know I think that we'll see new figures rise up just as quickly and you know
[03:15:00.280 --> 03:15:03.880]  they'll try to learn from the mistakes that they made I mean you know the next
[03:15:03.880 --> 03:15:08.400]  Jordan Peterson will probably be somebody who is not mentally disturbed
[03:15:08.400 --> 03:15:14.400]  and is not taking anti-depression pills you know I mean the the next Ben
[03:15:14.400 --> 03:15:22.000]  Shapiro is probably going to be somebody who is actually an American so that he
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:26.600]  doesn't have to he's not constantly caught out you know pushing one set
[03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:31.000]  apart into one more segment and then in brackets this is too powerful and you
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:34.840]  know here's the deal to you go to his own daily wire site I went and read it

[03:20:28.880 --> 03:20:32.000]  know there's a spirit of good and evil a lot of people don't believe in God till
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:35.280]  they run into the globalists and these devil worshipers who really do hate
[03:20:35.280 --> 03:20:40.400]  innocence they really do hate God they really do hate Christ and they'll go out
[03:20:40.400 --> 03:20:44.200]  of their way and blow their own feet off to get to it take Melania trump without
[03:20:44.200 --> 03:20:50.120]  trump even asking you know getting up and saying the Lord's Prayer or her right
[03:20:50.120 --> 03:20:53.200]  there you're getting a bill signed with her husband look how trump looks male
[03:20:53.200 --> 03:20:58.880]  strong in command his wife powerful electric feminine but you read the
[03:20:58.880 --> 03:21:02.040]  globalist on admissions they don't want women as feminine looking they say a
[03:21:02.040 --> 03:21:07.040]  woman the users are feminine power is bad cia declassified they want they
[03:21:07.040 --> 03:21:11.600]  funded ugly architecture they funded ugly art so that you wouldn't know what
[03:21:11.600 --> 03:21:16.360]  was real so that you wouldn't feel buoyed by architecture and again when I
[03:21:16.360 --> 03:21:22.480]  say cia criminal globalist elements so vox day we've got seven minutes left with
[03:21:22.480 --> 03:21:25.320]  him and then Matt Bracken's taken over Matt's and he's happy to be waiting as
[03:21:25.320 --> 03:21:30.080]  he loves vox day vox other key points you want to get out and then again
[03:21:30.080 --> 03:21:36.480]  quantifying for folks why are SJW is so hateful why do they always lie what is
[03:21:36.480 --> 03:21:41.360]  it about they also never give up they're cowardly they'll hide they'll never take
[03:21:41.360 --> 03:21:45.040]  the field against you but they never give up even when they say they've given
[03:21:45.040 --> 03:21:53.200]  up they're always plotting they crave evil well first let me say that seven
[03:21:53.200 --> 03:21:58.240]  minutes is a little bit difficult to summarize something that you know
[03:21:58.240 --> 03:22:03.400]  spreads across two books but I'll do my best but before I get into that I do
[03:22:03.400 --> 03:22:10.600]  want to say the single most important thing that we can do in the west is
[03:22:10.600 --> 03:22:17.480]  number one pray and number two support the nationalist leaders you know support
[03:22:17.480 --> 03:22:24.400]  the Donald Trump's support the Victor Obans support the you know the Mateo
[03:22:24.400 --> 03:22:29.080]  Salvini's the leaders who are rising up in defense of their nations just like
[03:22:29.080 --> 03:22:35.000]  Charles Martel did just like Alfred the great did just like men have risen up
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:39.880]  over and over again I was I was reading the darkest rising books to one of my
[03:22:39.880 --> 03:22:49.120]  kids and this whole cyclical nature of good versus evil is normal and it falls
[03:22:49.120 --> 03:22:55.960]  to us to fight the battles both spiritual and material now to get into the
[03:22:55.960 --> 03:23:03.920]  SJW's why do they do what they do it's because they are hung up in emotional
[03:23:03.920 --> 03:23:10.920]  pain and SJW is usually an individual who experienced a lot of emotional pain
[03:23:10.920 --> 03:23:15.800]  whether it was rejection whether it was from the parents whether it was from
[03:23:15.800 --> 03:23:22.560]  from kids whenever you look at a hardcore SJW you almost always find an
[03:23:22.560 --> 03:23:29.640]  amount of pain and the problem is that they learned how to deal with the pain
[03:23:29.640 --> 03:23:39.560]  by lying about it by avoiding it and so what they do is is they initiate
[03:23:39.560 --> 03:23:46.200]  conflict because they need to have conflict in order to feel anything but
[03:23:46.200 --> 03:23:51.600]  then once they've initiated the conflict then they get it it starts to
[03:23:51.600 --> 03:23:59.280]  frighten them and then they overreact it's this constant it's this constant brain
[03:23:59.280 --> 03:24:04.560]  cycle that they get into and it's really interesting because once you
[03:24:04.560 --> 03:24:12.120]  understand it you can actually predict anticipate and to a certain extent even
[03:24:12.120 --> 03:24:18.120]  manipulate their behavior because it's that predictable it is that obvious and
[03:24:18.120 --> 03:24:23.940]  so you know if this is something that that people are interested in they
[03:24:23.940 --> 03:24:27.000]  should actually read the second book which is SJW is always doubled down
[03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:34.400]  because it gets into why SJW's behave the way that they do SJW's always lie is
[03:24:34.400 --> 03:24:40.160]  about what you should do when you come under attack at your office at your
[03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:45.760]  church wherever it's basically a survival guide okay you know if you're
[03:24:45.760 --> 03:24:48.880]  getting attacked this is what you should do in the case of SJW is always
[03:24:48.880 --> 03:24:53.720]  doubled down it's an attempt to understand why they behave the way they do
[03:24:53.720 --> 03:24:59.520]  and if you look at you know anonymous conservatives are K theory is a one
[03:24:59.520 --> 03:25:02.880]  element of it and then well I mean the definition of insanity is doing the
[03:25:02.880 --> 03:25:06.000]  same thing over and over again that's what I've noticed they do always double
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:09.800]  down and they're very OCD they're very pathological and that's why they think
[03:25:09.800 --> 03:25:14.240]  everybody else is mentally ill and absolutely they kind of gave into bad
[03:25:14.240 --> 03:25:18.200]  things decided to mentally ill not challenge it and just twist their minds
[03:25:18.200 --> 03:25:22.120]  they never overcame like the definition of victory and competence and
[03:25:22.120 --> 03:25:26.440]  strength is adversity which you then overcame learning competence to greater
[03:25:26.440 --> 03:25:30.320]  levels of competence with them they always learned incompetence so they
[03:25:30.320 --> 03:25:34.480]  didn't want to say everyone's a victim have cry closets so people are weaker
[03:25:34.480 --> 03:25:38.560]  than them so they can rule over the week they want to make everybody weaker as a
[03:25:38.560 --> 03:25:42.120]  coping strategy while subconsciously trying to become the tyrants that
[03:25:42.120 --> 03:25:45.840]  oppress them so they become the super tyrant that they fear which they don't
[03:25:45.840 --> 03:25:50.400]  even know they are well that's exactly right that's why you're always seeing
[03:25:50.400 --> 03:25:55.200]  the SJW women trying to convince other women to make themselves look less
[03:25:55.200 --> 03:26:03.280]  attractive to tie this back to Jordan Peterson I believe very strongly that
[03:26:03.280 --> 03:26:08.200]  Jordan Peterson because he's a very intelligent version of this mentality
[03:26:08.200 --> 03:26:13.920]  this mindset he actually took his delusion bubble and constructed an
[03:26:13.920 --> 03:26:18.560]  entire philosophical system around it and that's what the maps of meaning is
[03:26:18.560 --> 03:26:26.000]  the maps of meaning is essentially his way of creating a huge defensive system
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:30.960]  to protect his psyche and you know the lesser SJWs they don't have that
[03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:36.800]  intellectual capacity so they just lie they just tell you that black is white
[03:26:36.800 --> 03:26:39.960]  when you can all everyone can look and see that sure he's just building a
[03:26:39.960 --> 03:26:44.200]  cosmology that then his delusion can fit into what shows he's kind of in a
[03:26:44.200 --> 03:26:48.320]  brain bug level you know in a cast level and I'm not trying to be mean to
[03:26:48.320 --> 03:26:50.920]  Peter so some of what he says is you know true and he's an articulate guy but
[03:26:50.920 --> 03:26:55.520]  if you look in his eyes he's not trying to look completely insane I mean he does
[03:26:55.520 --> 03:27:02.520]  look seriously sick well I think that you know when I watch the way that he
[03:27:02.520 --> 03:27:09.120]  talks I can even tell when he's about to lie he has two tells that he has
[03:27:09.120 --> 03:27:17.200]  repeatedly in his videos and when he's going to lie going to lie he'll always
[03:27:17.200 --> 03:27:22.120]  repeat something twice and then he'll tell the lie he also has a when he does
[03:27:22.120 --> 03:27:26.400]  the big long pauses what he's attempting to do is he's he's attempting to steer
[03:27:26.400 --> 03:27:30.960]  around something that he doesn't want to address directly and you know these are
[03:27:30.960 --> 03:27:35.800]  coping mechanisms and you know fine it's great that you've been able to hold
[03:27:35.800 --> 03:27:39.800]  it together and cope well I agree I think he thinks he's telling the truth
[03:27:39.800 --> 03:27:43.080]  because I've seen him and I started watching him more to understand it he
[03:27:43.080 --> 03:27:46.280]  even talked about he got asked questions he doesn't like he says I won't
[03:27:46.280 --> 03:27:50.800]  answer it he said then a week later I wrote a column so he has to when he gets
[03:27:50.800 --> 03:27:54.200]  hit with something uncomfortable there's nothing really there he has to develop a
[03:27:54.200 --> 03:28:01.440]  new a new track for that yeah and he also likes to he's also delaying time
[03:28:01.440 --> 03:28:07.120]  he's trying to buy time but the key thing is with Jordan Peterson and and with
[03:28:07.120 --> 03:28:11.280]  Ben Shapiro and with all other charlatans the way that you can always
[03:28:11.280 --> 03:28:16.960]  identify them is the way that they redefine simple commonly understood
[03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:23.480]  words mother and father becomes easy exactly it is a very very reliable tell
[03:28:23.480 --> 03:28:27.720]  and whenever you see someone doing that dig a little deeper well as you said
[03:28:27.720 --> 03:28:32.680]  nationalism patriotism populism Christianity the real Christianity is

[03:33:24.480 --> 03:33:27.720]  this week he was happy to have Vox go a little bit longer so I went longer because
[03:33:27.720 --> 03:33:31.440]  he likes Vox as well and and listen here's the deal I'm a Christian I love
[03:33:31.440 --> 03:33:34.720]  God I don't sit there and say I'm the perfect guy by these glitter bug
[03:33:34.720 --> 03:33:39.480]  preachers where it's all about a contest about how holy you are the
[03:33:39.480 --> 03:33:43.000]  globalists have taken over the churches because they fear God they fear Jesus
[03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:48.120]  Christ they fear that spirit and they want to overthrow it so praying calling
[03:33:48.120 --> 03:33:54.280]  on God they can't stand it folks it's an evil force it's real that's what we're
[03:33:54.280 --> 03:33:58.640]  up against this stuff's real they're into the occult the left in every study
[03:33:58.640 --> 03:34:05.800]  even their own studies is evil so let's play Melania Trump since she's done this
[03:34:05.800 --> 03:34:09.200]  big bill you know for the kids and all the rest of it today I thought I'd play
[03:34:09.200 --> 03:34:12.920]  what they hate her spontaneous with the Lord's Prayer them all hand the baton to
[03:34:12.920 --> 03:34:21.560]  Matt Bracken here it is let us pray our father who art in heaven hallowed by
[03:34:21.560 --> 03:34:29.640]  thy name thank you don't come I will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us
[03:34:29.640 --> 03:34:36.760]  these days our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those
[03:34:36.760 --> 03:34:44.560]  who trespasses against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from
[03:34:44.560 --> 03:34:51.600]  evil for time is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever
[03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:57.320]  amen not devil worshipers that's what they don't like we're going to Matt

[03:36:14.040 --> 03:36:18.600]  25 minutes Matt Bracken takes over really appreciate him and the fine work
[03:36:18.600 --> 03:36:21.720]  he's doing he's got a lot to cover I've been asked the question all day I'm in a
[03:36:21.720 --> 03:36:25.000]  punch out but I want to get this answer from you and then your own agenda with
[03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:28.080]  the wheels coming off three federal judges saying Mueller's a liar a fraud
[03:36:28.080 --> 03:36:32.440]  wants to impeach Trump caught lying what are they gonna do I think they're gonna
[03:36:32.440 --> 03:36:37.680]  strike back how are they gonna strike back Matt Bracken well one mate one way
[03:36:37.680 --> 03:36:44.000]  might be a an attack some kind of a of a terrorist attack if they are
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:48.360]  monitoring somebody the FBI might you know conveniently drop the ball again
[03:36:48.360 --> 03:36:56.160]  as seems to happen over and over again I don't see Mueller just quitting writing
[03:36:56.160 --> 03:37:01.760]  an exoneration he might though claim out of his high sense of altruism he's
[03:37:01.760 --> 03:37:07.760]  going to go dark for the rest of the period through the midterms while he is
[03:37:07.760 --> 03:37:13.760]  really just sort of turning the lights out but without telling anybody and then
[03:37:13.760 --> 03:37:20.840]  after the midterms perhaps then there'll be some kind of a final report if they
[03:37:20.840 --> 03:37:23.560]  had anything it would have already been leaked in the New York Times and the
[03:37:23.560 --> 03:37:27.480]  Washington Post they don't have anything it's been a terrible week for team
[03:37:27.480 --> 03:37:34.240]  Mueller thank goodness and I expect that the IG report is going to come down like
[03:37:34.240 --> 03:37:39.240]  a ton of bricks I've been following a I would say conservative treehouse there's
[03:37:39.240 --> 03:37:43.520]  there staying with Sundance over there is staying with a theory that sessions
[03:37:43.520 --> 03:37:49.840]  isn't just lobotomized or blackmailed that he's actually sincerely working with
[03:37:49.840 --> 03:37:55.840]  Horowitz at the IG and with the Huber this outside prosecutor and that they
[03:37:55.840 --> 03:38:01.320]  are already working up indictments and after the IG report drops it was supposed
[03:38:01.320 --> 03:38:05.240]  to drop this week I think that they've they said that they're delaying it for
[03:38:05.240 --> 03:38:10.000]  up to two weeks because they're they're working more Comey information into it
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:15.680]  that Comey has been putting out is on his own but it will it will be great if
[03:38:15.680 --> 03:38:19.760]  these indictments do drop I won't hold my breath clearly there's a titanic
[03:38:19.760 --> 03:38:26.200]  battle at work right now Admiral Mike Rogers who really saved the nation saved
[03:38:26.200 --> 03:38:32.360]  the Republic when he went to Trump Tower and told Donald Trump that he was
[03:38:32.360 --> 03:38:39.840]  being effectively wiretapped he's now retired he'll be free to testify so we
[03:38:39.840 --> 03:38:44.720]  might be setting up a clash of the Titans with Mike Rogers competing in in
[03:38:44.720 --> 03:38:51.080]  congressional testimony against the lying traders and coup plotters who would
[03:38:51.080 --> 03:38:57.920]  be a clapper Comey and Brennan among many others but you know that we are in for
[03:38:57.920 --> 03:39:06.000]  an epic spring spring and summer that's for sure yeah anyway I was I was
[03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:10.040]  watching Vox day I've never seen him before I've been reading him I've seen
[03:39:10.040 --> 03:39:14.720]  a few little YouTube clips here and there but I didn't really know who he was
[03:39:14.720 --> 03:39:19.840]  but it's it's really informative it's what I've been thinking about all along
[03:39:19.840 --> 03:39:26.640]  in the last couple of weeks also just this weekend we saw the EU the European
[03:39:26.640 --> 03:39:32.440]  Union accepted a giant statue of Karl Marx they don't seem in any way
[03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:38.120]  ashamed of the hundred million that were killed by Marx's theories in the 20th
[03:39:38.120 --> 03:39:44.600]  century so the junkers of the EU he's actually defending socialism just
[03:39:44.600 --> 03:39:49.440]  saying don't worry we'll get it right the next time but the people aren't
[03:39:49.440 --> 03:39:54.600]  aren't buying it which is why they're trying in Europe to replace the native
[03:39:54.600 --> 03:40:01.440]  Europeans and the nation states with third-world migrants this is called the
[03:40:01.440 --> 03:40:08.640]  great replacement which I call a code word or politically correct term for
[03:40:08.640 --> 03:40:15.240]  genocide of the Europeans if the Europeans aren't going to accept socialism
[03:40:15.240 --> 03:40:21.080]  part 2 or part 3 then they're just going to replace the Europeans with a very
[03:40:21.080 --> 03:40:27.920]  low IQ crowd of third-worlders who they see as guaranteed welfare votes this is
[03:40:27.920 --> 03:40:32.120]  how the elites plan to stay in power and essentially turn Europe and
[03:40:32.120 --> 03:40:37.280]  eventually the entire world into a globalist serfdom with the elites in
[03:40:37.280 --> 03:40:41.600]  charge this is why they default de-platform people in Europe like
[03:40:41.600 --> 03:40:46.680]  Tommy Robinson this is why they wouldn't let Brittany Pettibone or Lauren
[03:40:46.680 --> 03:40:54.480]  Southern into the UK to speak this is also why Alfie Evans had to die you
[03:40:54.480 --> 03:40:59.360]  know that the state has to be seen as supreme this is just what Vox day was
[03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:06.240]  saying past half hour the nation this the state the overarching state is the
[03:41:06.240 --> 03:41:11.520]  replacement for God and even a baby can't be taken out of the country even
[03:41:11.520 --> 03:41:16.440]  in a even if it's a hopeless or medically you know improbable attempt to
[03:41:16.440 --> 03:41:22.000]  save his life the state had to crush that baby he had to die in that British
[03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:26.580]  hospital under the state's national health service that's why they had the
[03:41:26.580 --> 03:41:31.240]  police out front so this is a this is really the big issue that's going on
[03:41:31.240 --> 03:41:36.880]  this population replacement this genocide by other you know by another
[03:41:36.880 --> 03:41:42.400]  name and if if people aren't allowed to talk about this you know this is the
[03:41:42.400 --> 03:41:48.760]  going back to for example the whole Ben Shapiro versus Info Wars kerfuffle last

[03:46:52.080 --> 03:47:16.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're
[03:47:16.320 --> 03:47:29.520]  listening to the alex jones show hey I'm back yeah this is a great segment it's
[03:47:29.520 --> 03:47:36.840]  short but following vox day is is always a challenge but also a lot of fertile
[03:47:36.840 --> 03:47:41.640]  information and and great ideas to expand on something that he mentioned was
[03:47:41.640 --> 03:47:48.480]  SJW is always lie social justice warriors always lie you know why is that
[03:47:48.480 --> 03:47:57.720]  well both in Marxism and in Islamism adherents are told don't think about
[03:47:57.720 --> 03:48:03.560]  how it's going to work just obey the rules smarter people than you have
[03:48:03.560 --> 03:48:09.000]  figured all of this out in the case of the Quran it's Allah and Muhammad and in
[03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:14.400]  the case of socialism it's Marx and Lenin and you just need to be a good
[03:48:14.400 --> 03:48:20.480]  soldier this is why SJWs don't have a problem with cognitive dissonance it's
[03:48:20.480 --> 03:48:24.680]  obvious after a more than a century that socialism doesn't work it hasn't
[03:48:24.680 --> 03:48:30.520]  worked anywhere the more socialist the country becomes the poor and less free
[03:48:30.520 --> 03:48:36.560]  it becomes but it still appeals to people with you know low educations and
[03:48:36.560 --> 03:48:43.360]  low IQs this is why our elites want to flood both America and Europe with low
[03:48:43.360 --> 03:48:49.880]  IQ migrants because they'll be easy fodder for leading them to socialism or
[03:48:49.880 --> 03:48:54.240]  if they're already Muslims then they're just they're already fodder their
[03:48:54.240 --> 03:48:59.120]  self-identified volunteers unless they were born into it which I guess most of
[03:48:59.120 --> 03:49:06.240]  them were but both both in Islam and in socialism both of these faiths which they
[03:49:06.240 --> 03:49:11.120]  really are socialism is absolutely a religion it's a godless religion but
[03:49:11.120 --> 03:49:17.240]  it is or it's a faith both of them believe in what I call taqiyah and for
[03:49:17.240 --> 03:49:22.760]  liberals it's liberal taqiyah which means that anything that you do to further
[03:49:22.760 --> 03:49:29.040]  the advance of socialism or Islam is good inherently so you're allowed to lie
[03:49:29.040 --> 03:49:33.480]  you're you know you you should lie you should lie about your intentions you
[03:49:33.480 --> 03:49:38.680]  should lie about your methods and it and it's very effective you know that the
[03:49:38.680 --> 03:49:42.840]  most important book that I've read probably in the last five years that I
[03:49:42.840 --> 03:49:48.360]  can even think of not nothing comes close it's a few years old and somehow I
[03:49:48.360 --> 03:49:53.120]  missed it I read some of the reviews but I didn't read it it's called American
[03:49:53.120 --> 03:49:59.400]  Betrayal by Diana West and it goes back to the beginning of the 20th century and
[03:49:59.400 --> 03:50:04.560]  shows how our country was really taken over from within particularly during
[03:50:04.560 --> 03:50:10.240]  the Roosevelt administration and that was when Roosevelt was surrounded by
[03:50:10.240 --> 03:50:15.000]  true Stalinists it turned out later they were communists they were
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:20.320]  Stalinist Soviet agents and they worked all the way through the new deal to make
[03:50:20.320 --> 03:50:26.840]  America as socialistic as they could and in and in every chance in every way to
[03:50:26.840 --> 03:50:32.040]  help Stalin spread communism this is you know beyond debate now the book is you
[03:50:32.040 --> 03:50:36.920]  know is an academic work heavily footnoted at the time it was you know
[03:50:36.920 --> 03:50:42.840]  it was it was called you know discounted as McCarthyism the fact that this
[03:50:42.840 --> 03:50:47.520]  country was taken over from within but she identifies where America really went
[03:50:47.520 --> 03:50:54.960]  off the rails in 1933 and 34 we knew what communism was doing that millions
[03:50:54.960 --> 03:50:59.400]  were being purged and murdered that the terror famine was happening in Ukraine
[03:50:59.400 --> 03:51:06.760]  and our leaders decided it was worth it to hide this because they didn't want
[03:51:06.760 --> 03:51:11.120]  people to be so turned off against communism that they would also reject
[03:51:11.120 --> 03:51:16.880]  socialism Roosevelt and his people and really continuing decade by decade
[03:51:16.880 --> 03:51:22.680]  until today they believe in something called the great convergence we'll take
[03:51:22.680 --> 03:51:28.200]  the best parts of capitalism and the best parts of communism and we'll merge
[03:51:28.200 --> 03:51:33.800]  somewhere in a socialist in a socialist form of government you know run by
[03:51:33.800 --> 03:51:39.160]  socialist elites and it's been very successful I mean just look at look at
[03:51:39.160 --> 03:51:45.560]  our universities today it's been completely successful Antonio Gramsci was
[03:51:45.560 --> 03:51:50.320]  an Italian communist in the early 20th century he didn't believe that Lenin
[03:51:50.320 --> 03:51:54.880]  and Stalin were going to succeed with you know brutal invasive tactics he
[03:51:54.880 --> 03:52:00.720]  believed in in rotting the institutions from within and taking over every
[03:52:00.720 --> 03:52:05.440]  institution it's called the long march through the institutions and it's been
[03:52:05.440 --> 03:52:10.800]  highly successful all you have to do is is look at not only academia our
[03:52:10.800 --> 03:52:15.120]  corporations are politically correct now institutions like the Boy Scouts
[03:52:15.120 --> 03:52:20.480]  politically correct we're really fighting a rearguard action now and Vox
[03:52:20.480 --> 03:52:26.080]  Day was completely right we need to support nationalist leaders who are
[03:52:26.080 --> 03:52:32.480]  trying to preserve and conserve our own cultures and identities to keep us from
[03:52:32.480 --> 03:52:38.160]  just being submerged beneath this you know this great replacement where we're
[03:52:38.160 --> 03:52:44.080]  going to wind up as as serfs in this global New World Order it's happening
[03:52:44.080 --> 03:52:50.920]  and unfortunately even among conservatives we find ourselves de-platformed
[03:52:50.920 --> 03:52:56.200]  because we're not staying within the polite boundaries of acceptable speech
[03:52:56.200 --> 03:53:02.480]  and talking about the great replacement or genocide of Europeans and Americans
[03:53:02.480 --> 03:53:08.320]  it's not considered acceptable we're supposed to like Jordan Peterson said
[03:53:08.320 --> 03:53:14.760]  take our pills and stay within the acceptable mainstream be polite well the
[03:53:14.760 --> 03:53:21.360]  problem is being polite keeps us on the fast track you know toward oblivion we
[03:53:21.360 --> 03:53:28.480]  are being eradicated I often ask the question is it still called genocide if
[03:53:28.480 --> 03:53:33.800]  you're brainwashed into hating your own people before you're replaced and wiped
[03:53:33.800 --> 03:53:39.720]  out if the if the people being eradicated for example in Sweden if the
[03:53:39.720 --> 03:53:45.200]  people being replaced and eradicated are first made to hate themselves does it
[03:53:45.200 --> 03:53:50.160]  still count as eradication the one thing that I've learned in my life is that
[03:53:50.160 --> 03:53:56.280]  brainwashing absolutely works and we need to resist this brainwashing and we
[03:53:56.280 --> 03:54:02.840]  we need to resist de-platforming people and other voices outside of the of the
[03:54:02.840 --> 03:54:10.000]  acceptable mainstream because if we don't we are going to find ourselves you
[03:54:10.000 --> 03:54:16.920]  know on the last boxcar or in some kind of a zoo because we are being wiped out
[03:54:16.920 --> 03:54:24.720]  our values our culture our peoples our nations the communists never quit the
[03:54:24.720 --> 03:54:30.440]  socialists they didn't surrender we think we won the Cold War but in effect
[03:54:30.440 --> 03:54:35.360]  the communists got inside of our own system and turned us into pod people
[03:54:35.360 --> 03:54:41.680]  we're now like replicant communists spouting communist slogans even while
[03:54:41.680 --> 03:54:46.080]  we hold up you know our pocket constitutions it's really been an
[03:54:46.080 --> 03:54:52.360]  amazing thing to watch and I I can only encourage people and please read
[03:54:52.360 --> 03:54:59.800]  Diana West's book the American Betrayal because it's it's nailed it closer than
[03:54:59.800 --> 03:55:05.520]  anything else that I've ever seen and we are we are going to lose this war if
[03:55:05.520 --> 03:55:11.240]  we continue to play by the you know the marquee to Queensbury rules against people
[03:55:11.240 --> 03:55:16.440]  who are liars and cutthroats I mean that this this is gone to the extent that
[03:55:16.440 --> 03:55:21.960]  even our our religious institutions have been taken over by Marxists there's no
[03:55:21.960 --> 03:55:27.520]  doubt in my mind this is what happened to the to my own church with with the
[03:55:27.520 --> 03:55:32.120]  Pope the previous Pope wasn't ill he wasn't you know old he what didn't he
[03:55:32.120 --> 03:55:38.040]  wasn't didn't have dementia he was forced out in a push by Cardinals who were
[03:55:38.040 --> 03:55:45.360]  themselves covert socialists you know so the tide is against us and the time
[03:55:45.360 --> 03:55:51.120]  for being polite is over most of the conservatives within what I call can you
[03:55:51.120 --> 03:55:56.400]  know which folks call conservatism ink they really don't care if we lose this
[03:55:56.400 --> 03:56:02.560]  war all they care about is being invited on CNN next week and to do that they
[03:56:02.560 --> 03:56:06.960]  have to stay within the acceptable boundaries not talk about the things
[03:56:06.960 --> 03:56:10.960]  that I've been talking about the last 10 minutes because that's a sure way to
[03:56:10.960 --> 03:56:17.240]  be branded as alt-right outside acceptable bounds well we can't do that we
[03:56:17.240 --> 03:56:22.680]  need we need to call traders what they are traders stop being polite stop
[03:56:22.680 --> 03:56:27.600]  worrying about whether national review will publish you or whether these other
[03:56:27.600 --> 03:56:34.200]  for-profit conservatism ink websites will publish your columns forget it go
[03:56:34.200 --> 03:56:41.000]  outside of them appeal to people to go to places like info wars to use free
[03:56:41.000 --> 03:56:47.240]  website or free video sites like bit shoot or gab on instead of Twitter and
[03:56:47.240 --> 03:56:52.720]  Facebook as long as we're stuck using Twitter and Facebook we're basically
[03:56:52.720 --> 03:56:58.840]  self-segregated to the back of the bus but we're step-and-fetch it's
[03:56:58.840 --> 03:57:04.880]  ideologically to the extent that we like the bus it's a really nice bus so we'll
[03:57:04.880 --> 03:57:10.800]  accept being throttled and shadow banned and pushed to the back of the bus I say
[03:57:10.800 --> 03:57:16.760]  we need to support other avenues of thought like gab like bit shoot like
[03:57:16.760 --> 03:57:22.000]  info wars so that we can continue to reach people we're never going to reach
[03:57:22.000 --> 03:57:28.720]  people as long as we're just using things like Twitter where if you speak to
[03:57:28.720 --> 03:57:34.280]  frankly they'll turn you off like they turned off Tommy Robinson like they've
[03:57:34.280 --> 03:57:41.320]  you know they've shut down other people so anyway I'll see you all on the on
