[04:05.100 --> 04:09.780]  starting to wake up that's why the criminal group in control over both
[04:09.780 --> 04:14.220]  parties they put it out in Pentagon reports and admit that they are now

[08:06.500 --> 08:11.260]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:16.340 --> 08:23.180]  I covered Fox News with their continual drum beat that now the Democrats are in
[08:23.180 --> 08:28.060]  they've got to get tough on terrorists and arrest US citizens anybody else they
[08:28.060 --> 08:34.060]  want to literally disappear into black torture holes black sites those sites
[08:34.060 --> 08:41.500]  around the world just the the 180 degree anti-liberty anti-freedom position
[08:41.500 --> 08:48.180]  the end of the great rich the end of all basic liberties and freedoms they are
[08:48.180 --> 08:52.900]  moving forward with it also the New York Times is reporting what we reported on
[08:52.900 --> 08:57.460]  yesterday and what Bloomberg reported on yesterday the Federal Reserve is now
[08:57.460 --> 09:03.740]  taking complete public control of the Treasury now remember I read the sections
[09:03.740 --> 09:09.180]  on air of the banker takeover bill seven and a half weeks ago 8.5 trillion
[09:09.180 --> 09:13.860]  stolen as of last week we haven't gotten any new numbers in over a week since
[09:13.860 --> 09:20.140]  last Wednesday Bloomberg and the San Francisco Chronicle both reported 8.5
[09:20.140 --> 09:25.740]  trillion stolen by offshore foreign banks this is irrevocable this is already
[09:25.740 --> 09:30.020]  completely blown the ship to pieces in torpedoed the boat the ship of state the
[09:30.020 --> 09:33.900]  nation is already on the bottom let's be clear about that she can be raised and
[09:33.900 --> 09:38.100]  repaired but only if we admit how deep the attack is the things that are
[09:38.100 --> 09:43.500]  happening are so huge so diabolical so incredibly fast-moving open world
[09:43.500 --> 09:48.500]  government being declared oven by the bankers the Federal Reserve in the New
[09:48.500 --> 09:53.060]  York Times is openly saying they are going to start issuing federal reserve
[09:53.060 --> 10:01.420]  T bills so instead of us bonds and us securities being put out and sold the
[10:01.420 --> 10:05.780]  open market you know have to pay a premium just to get those you don't get
[10:05.780 --> 10:10.660]  any interest now you pay as people run they're thinking it's safe open
[10:10.660 --> 10:15.860]  discussions of the Treasury defaulting on world debt but people will pay premiums
[10:15.860 --> 10:19.140]  to buy something they're talking about defaulting on the Federal Reserve is
[10:19.140 --> 10:23.580]  saying well we'll just take over and we'll issue it so see they have fully
[10:23.580 --> 10:28.700]  capitalized with 8.5 trillion into the private foreign Federal Reserve it is
[10:28.700 --> 10:32.140]  foreign it is private that's on record when it was set up it's mainly British
[10:32.140 --> 10:37.300]  mainly Rothschild so they're setting that up there's some other families the
[10:37.300 --> 10:44.420]  castles and others involved they are openly saying that and they're doing
[10:44.420 --> 10:47.420]  this in Iceland they're doing this in England they're doing this in Germany
[10:47.420 --> 10:49.980]  they're doing this in Australia they're they're getting ready to do this in
[10:49.980 --> 10:58.100]  Canada everywhere everywhere we are looking at the bankers run their
[10:58.100 --> 11:14.580]  operations everywhere we are witnessing the New World Order take over and the
[11:14.580 --> 11:19.300]  public is not aware of how banking works are not aware of the International
[11:19.300 --> 11:22.420]  Banking Crime Syndicate they're not aware that the Federal Reserve is private
[11:22.420 --> 11:27.260]  though more and more are waking up to that and how do you fight something that
[11:27.260 --> 11:31.580]  the that's the public was never educated about well you try to educate them but
[11:31.580 --> 11:36.460]  it's like a crash course in brain surgery here so I want to get into
[11:36.460 --> 11:45.060]  crowd hammer and others on Fox openly pushing just unbelievable evil ultra
[11:45.060 --> 11:50.980]  wickedness and then meanwhile on top of all of that with what's happening with
[11:50.980 --> 11:56.860]  the Federal Reserve Obama is saying that climate change is a matter of national
[11:56.860 --> 12:03.700]  security President-elect Barack Obama said attacking global climate change the
[12:03.700 --> 12:08.740]  matter of matter of urgency and a national security so what's the issue
[12:08.740 --> 12:13.020]  there under national security in a national security state everything is
[12:13.020 --> 12:18.100]  national security so they can bypass the states bypass the Congress that's why
[12:18.100 --> 12:22.700]  Bloomberg is reporting that on the banking end that we're under war powers
[12:22.700 --> 12:27.460]  under martial law just as Congress seven weeks ago was threatened with
[12:27.460 --> 12:32.380]  martial law if they wouldn't pass the banker take over bill so it doesn't
[12:32.380 --> 12:35.860]  matter whether it's global warming and the carbon taxes and the cap and trade
[12:35.860 --> 12:42.380]  taxes it doesn't matter if it is the financial end with the banks it doesn't
[12:42.380 --> 12:46.340]  matter if it's terrorism it doesn't matter what issue it is it's under
[12:46.340 --> 12:50.780]  national security so that martial law is triggered and what is martial law is
[12:50.780 --> 12:56.500]  the president and his executives so we'll be getting into that also protests
[12:56.500 --> 13:00.020]  that started in Greece taking over the major cities and taking over government
[13:00.020 --> 13:02.700]  buildings in the airport has now spread to Europe that's the one in
[13:02.700 --> 13:08.820]  Telegraph Europe proper to the continent itself also Ohio sheriff orders
[13:08.820 --> 13:16.260]  deputies not to evict it to that but first I wanted to briefly get into this
[13:16.260 --> 13:21.580]  and later I'm gonna do a whole segment on it the story from three days ago and
[13:21.580 --> 13:29.860]  now for a world government and this story was done by Gideon Reikman
[13:29.860 --> 13:35.500]  who is the chief far international affairs correspondent over at the
[13:35.500 --> 13:41.900]  Financial Times of London and he did a new story today on his blog on the
[13:41.900 --> 13:47.580]  Financial Times making fun of everybody and he says at the end well he says you
[13:47.580 --> 13:51.740]  don't know how to understand what I'm saying you know how to read but you
[13:51.740 --> 13:55.540]  don't know how to understand like we're all a bunch of idiots and at the end he
[13:55.540 --> 14:02.820]  goes on to say basically your conspiracy theorist it's a conspiracy
[14:02.820 --> 14:07.220]  there's basically no new world order there's no world government so he's
[14:07.220 --> 14:10.820]  engaging in double think he's saying we've always been at war with East Asia
[14:10.820 --> 14:16.660]  like 1984 and then he says but we've never been at war with East Asia and
[14:16.660 --> 14:22.620]  while Winston's being tortured by O'Brien in 1984 he says you know how many
[14:22.620 --> 14:26.660]  fingers I'm holding up he says to wrong he pulls him on the rack and while he's
[14:26.660 --> 14:30.860]  while he's stretching him on the rack he's also electrocuting him and he says
[14:30.860 --> 14:34.660]  and now how many fingers and he goes for any torches him again he goes look just
[14:34.660 --> 14:38.860]  tell me how many fingers to see and he said no I want you to see all the
[14:38.860 --> 14:44.540]  fingers all the numbers simultaneously I want you to see one thing I want you to
[14:44.540 --> 14:49.860]  see two I want you to see three I want you to see four and he goes oh and then
[14:49.860 --> 14:54.060]  suddenly he just sees a blur of fingers and he goes that's right now you're
[14:54.060 --> 14:58.740]  there now you're understanding and that's the key to double think and
[14:58.740 --> 15:03.420]  crime stop is that they openly announce every day in hundreds of papers now
[15:03.420 --> 15:06.580]  just world government where the bankers we're going to save you we're going to
[15:06.580 --> 15:09.820]  fix it all we're going to have world carbon taxes we're going to regulate you
[15:09.820 --> 15:13.500]  it's going to be tyrannical it's not going to be democratic he says that in
[15:13.500 --> 15:16.860]  his article he says yes we're setting up world government yes we tried to soothe
[15:16.860 --> 15:21.180]  you yes we you know we're basically deceptive for your own good I'm sorry
[15:21.180 --> 15:25.780]  democracy liberty freedom won't work for your own good the elite have to do this
[15:25.780 --> 15:30.060]  to save the environment and to fix the banking and to stop terrorism all of
[15:30.060 --> 15:33.500]  which the globalists are staging the global warming is fake to bring in a
[15:33.500 --> 15:37.500]  global tax they admit that in their own documents club of Rome 1991 Richard in
[15:37.500 --> 15:41.780]  hostage one of many we've linked to that on their own website former head of the
[15:41.780 --> 15:49.460]  CFR we know the terrorism is provocateur and stage 95% of the time there is some
[15:49.460 --> 15:52.820]  low-intensity real asymmetrical stuff that's really warfare but it's called
[15:52.820 --> 15:57.700]  terrorism that is real it's a tool take people's liberties to scare them into
[15:57.700 --> 16:01.060]  submission as you know and and then of course on record even the financial
[16:01.060 --> 16:04.340]  times of London his own paper is admitted that the big central banks of
[16:04.340 --> 16:07.540]  engineered this and are consolidating and this is great and the head of
[16:07.540 --> 16:10.500]  Goldman Sachs a few months ago told the New York Times I guess it was about a
[16:10.500 --> 16:13.300]  month ago he said hey we're doing great we're keeping the money buying good
[16:13.300 --> 16:16.660]  banks buying good insurance companies and giving ourselves bonuses everything's
[16:16.660 --> 16:25.860]  wonderful but see like Winston being tortured on that rack now obviously he's
[16:25.860 --> 16:31.740]  not really double thinking he is arrogantly insulting you at the most
[16:31.740 --> 16:36.420]  basic level saying I just told you it's world governments tyrannical but you
[16:36.420 --> 16:42.980]  can't understand when I'm writing and then he bemoans that the newspapers are
[16:42.980 --> 16:46.460]  all going under me the New York Times on the verge of going under and he says
[16:46.460 --> 16:51.780]  well so what I'll just write a book exposing the whole made-up conspiracy
[16:51.780 --> 16:57.060]  theory about world government but he's admitting it's a world government he's
[16:57.060 --> 17:00.980]  admitting they were deceptive about it he's at sea I mean this is they have
[17:00.980 --> 17:04.940]  trained us the public is mentally ill because they've grown up around these
[17:04.940 --> 17:09.340]  people they've been taught by these people and that's what we're dealing with
[17:09.340 --> 17:18.060]  so our regular producers out right now and so we've got Aaron producing the
[17:18.060 --> 17:22.940]  last few days and Aaron Dykes Jack of all trades here at the office our
[17:22.940 --> 17:29.260]  Renaissance man he called up the author Gideon Raykman this morning was very
[17:29.260 --> 17:33.820]  polite and Aaron I want you to tell folks what he said yeah basically he was not
[17:33.820 --> 17:38.020]  an adult I sent him a polite email asking him to come on to discuss his
[17:38.020 --> 17:42.900]  article for world government and he said no this is quote gone far enough I
[17:42.900 --> 17:47.820]  don't have to discuss it I'm not going to discuss it he knew who the show was he
[17:47.820 --> 17:53.460]  didn't want to talk about it and that's basically it he refused to talk about it
[17:53.460 --> 17:58.260]  and hung up on me he got very very snippy this is going far enough yeah I'm
[17:58.260 --> 18:02.700]  not getting to a name you're an English accent so specifically what was said
[18:02.700 --> 18:07.300]  well specifically the Financial Times is a Bilderberg run paper it's on record
[18:07.300 --> 18:12.340]  Rockefeller wants deception and he said you know basically Rackman wrote about
[18:12.340 --> 18:16.740]  world government being anti-democratic explain the owners of it the editors I
[18:16.740 --> 18:20.780]  mean they are one of the only papers allowed to attend but here he is
[18:20.780 --> 18:24.380]  basically again the in the article saying Bilderberg doesn't exist yeah
[18:24.380 --> 18:29.180]  and it's disdain it's look I know the public stupid I'm going to get away with
[18:29.180 --> 18:33.580]  it but you're not getting away with it you dinosaur the newspapers are all in
[18:33.580 --> 18:39.460]  mega crisis imploding because no one wants to read your trash anymore and by
[18:39.460 --> 18:44.180]  the way punk we don't need to go to you to admit there's real government we have
[18:44.180 --> 18:47.420]  foreign affairs we have all the documents we have the ran corporation we
[18:47.420 --> 18:51.500]  have the New York Times and 36 pushing the 10 FEMA regions decades before it
[18:51.500 --> 18:55.500]  was set up saying world government back before they thought there was resistance
[18:55.500 --> 18:59.540]  they advertise it as the new futuristic thing to do regional governments
[18:59.540 --> 19:04.620]  socialism by the elite they'd they be in socialism we have it all okay we have
[19:04.620 --> 19:08.140]  so much evidence it's mind-blowing we have all your leaders openly saying
[19:08.140 --> 19:10.980]  world government we have Walter Cronkite saying we just set up world
[19:10.980 --> 19:15.460]  government we have a you all on tape doing it David Rockefeller saying it so
[19:15.460 --> 19:19.020]  we're just shocked that after all your years of denial working for these people
[19:19.020 --> 19:22.700]  that you guys at the Financial Times of London would decide to go ahead and
[19:22.700 --> 19:26.340]  announce this but we know you have to because now they are openly setting it
[19:26.340 --> 19:30.780]  up it's already been set up they're now unveiling the the the constructed
[19:30.780 --> 19:35.820]  technological monstrosity and but then if we don't like it they go up we're
[19:35.820 --> 19:40.620]  activating double think it doesn't exist I mean is that an insult Aaron it's
[19:40.620 --> 19:45.140]  very insulting as childish I know David Rockefeller thank them for keeping
[19:45.140 --> 19:49.340]  silence for so many years along with all the other papers they're just babies

[25:22.420 --> 25:27.700]  issue I get these emails every day accusing me of being some evil mastermind
[25:27.700 --> 25:34.580]  with other little radio networks on the internet that that we are shutting
[25:34.580 --> 25:37.940]  other people's streams down how about the internet has problems how about your
[25:37.940 --> 25:42.660]  website goes down it's because you've got a bad service or a bad server or
[25:42.660 --> 25:47.060]  there's problems on the web you jackasses instead of blaming me for it I
[25:47.060 --> 25:50.340]  don't know man I'm just really get sick of everybody I mean I really am and I'm
[25:50.340 --> 25:53.900]  in here barely able to keep things running around here I'm not bitching
[25:53.900 --> 25:57.860]  about that and then I look at the rest of the country it's a bunch of knuckle
[25:57.860 --> 26:01.180]  dragging idiots including our own movement I don't mean the listeners and
[26:01.180 --> 26:04.940]  the great yeoman men and women out in the field and on the street and out there
[26:04.940 --> 26:10.020]  waking people up on the front lines of the info war but that's what this
[26:10.020 --> 26:16.260]  country does now is that people are delusional it's just like the writer it's
[26:16.260 --> 26:20.460]  the whole western world getting an arraignment it's more double-think they
[26:20.460 --> 26:24.660]  just make up whatever they want and then say oh I didn't say there was a world
[26:24.660 --> 26:28.540]  government and you're idiots when his article says we've got a world government
[26:28.540 --> 26:32.260]  we needed to take over and now for a world government you can go read it now
[26:32.260 --> 26:39.220]  he's reversing saying you know I'm not really saying that it is just it is
[26:39.220 --> 26:48.900]  just unbelievable and I keep saying that my mind is spinning from all of this my
[26:48.900 --> 26:54.780]  mind is spinning from what this world is turned into but Aaron going back to this
[26:54.780 --> 26:58.940]  guy I mean I wonder why he wouldn't come on the air and defend his ideas you know
[26:58.940 --> 27:02.860]  that we're all basically don't know how to run around affairs and we have to get
[27:02.860 --> 27:08.100]  rid of democracy and freedom because you know the bankers know best yeah that's
[27:08.100 --> 27:13.220]  right he wrote he basically signals the end of democracy as we know it and then
[27:13.220 --> 27:18.540]  apparently has a little pouty time when someone writes an article as Paul did
[27:18.540 --> 27:22.820]  pointing out that he's called for world government in an anti-democratic fashion
[27:22.820 --> 27:26.740]  and he didn't like people talking about it's like how dare you not want to have
[27:26.740 --> 27:31.180]  any freedom or control any of your destiny that is outrageous we know best
[27:31.180 --> 27:36.180]  because we talk like this we said smart I mean I'm so tired of these
[27:36.180 --> 27:39.740]  intellectuals you know there's two there's two types of in the elite there
[27:39.740 --> 27:43.100]  are the delusionals that really believe in the whole system because they think
[27:43.100 --> 27:45.860]  they're part of it it's a power trip and then there are the cold-blooded
[27:45.860 --> 27:49.860]  sociopaths and psychopaths running it who know it's just all about power and
[27:49.860 --> 27:56.020]  nihilistic destruction well obviously he enjoys cohorting with his globalist at
[27:56.020 --> 28:00.940]  the top secretly and just doesn't appreciate any speculation discussion
[28:00.940 --> 28:04.180]  that's all we were gonna do here is discuss with well the Bilderberg
[28:04.180 --> 28:07.420]  controlled financial times of london that's literally openly it's filled with
[28:07.420 --> 28:11.020]  boulders like no other publication martin wolf yeah told folks about that
[28:11.020 --> 28:15.140]  martin wolf is the head editor he's been we've been a Bilderberg three three
[28:15.140 --> 28:18.940]  years now so I've been watching the list and he's been all of those years I
[28:18.940 --> 28:24.060]  think he's a longtime member but it doesn't exist and no paper will report
[28:24.060 --> 28:27.220]  oh no paper will report on it doesn't exist and we're crazy that's in the
[28:27.220 --> 28:32.460]  article yeah how you know I'm tired of this is so insulting to all of us but it
[28:32.460 --> 28:36.180]  works on the yuppies the yuppies are social climbers and they say hey if the
[28:36.180 --> 28:40.100]  establishment tells me something doesn't exist I don't care if it does exist I
[28:40.100 --> 28:44.900]  brown nose up the chain of command by being delusional know what you get is
[28:44.900 --> 28:49.860]  your 401k taken I remember three four years ago I'd write articles we Paul
[28:49.860 --> 28:53.140]  write article Steve we all write articles warning people you'd write
[28:53.140 --> 28:55.380]  articles saying they're gonna take your pension funds they're gonna bankrupt
[28:55.380 --> 28:58.900]  things here's their documents and they they go comment on the dig comments and
[28:58.900 --> 29:02.300]  go you're the ones that are gonna cause this to happen you need to be a
[29:02.300 --> 29:06.260]  rested they wouldn't dare do that to us and now they're taking your pension
[29:06.260 --> 29:12.300]  funds on purpose and you and you still are licking their boots I don't know
[29:12.300 --> 29:16.500]  it's just massive the restructuring that our world's going through I mean the
[29:16.500 --> 29:21.380]  the net is tightening in and we're losing all the foundation of democracy and
[29:21.380 --> 29:26.340]  Republican government we had and they're not even supposed to talk about it
[29:26.340 --> 29:31.420]  it's not even on paper when it was just published it's ridiculous the financial
[29:31.420 --> 29:37.340]  time and you're no you don't understand you're not seeing things clearly Aaron
[29:37.340 --> 29:40.900]  well they wouldn't talk about it they hung up on me
[29:40.900 --> 29:44.780]  giddy and Regman maybe giddy and Regman doesn't exist maybe the maybe we
[29:44.780 --> 29:49.500]  don't exist it's whatever they say Aaron they control reality their history's

[33:46.500 --> 33:51.300]  democracy is now all of the critics who've been whining and complaining and
[33:51.300 --> 33:56.220]  worrying about human rights who've attacked the Montanamo now own the war
[33:56.220 --> 34:02.380]  and owned the 250 miscreants inside of it and they are obviously understanding
[34:02.380 --> 34:08.340]  the Obama people what a terrible issue it is the there are a lot of people in
[34:08.340 --> 34:15.500]  here like Khali check Muhammad who will likely be impossible to convict because
[34:15.500 --> 34:20.500]  of the evidence was obtained and yet you obviously wouldn't ever have them
[34:20.500 --> 34:23.900]  walking the streets we're gonna have to have a law which is gonna allow
[34:23.900 --> 34:27.900]  indefinite a detention and it's gonna be Democrats who are gonna have to
[34:27.900 --> 34:33.980]  actually craft it I think that's poetic injustice there's always a phony issue
[34:33.980 --> 34:37.460]  since they're treated better there than people are in prisons almost
[34:37.460 --> 34:40.540]  anywhere else in the world well it's gonna be hard you have to pass new
[34:40.540 --> 34:44.660]  laws as Charles says you have to pass a permanent detention law in the case of
[34:44.660 --> 34:47.940]  some of these guys well I thought it was gonna be hard you have to pass new laws
[34:47.940 --> 34:51.860]  as Charles says you have to pass a permanent detention law in the case of
[34:51.860 --> 34:55.140]  some of these guys we kept hundreds of thousands of Japanese and Germans in
[34:55.140 --> 34:59.740]  prison in America in the Second World War we have to do exactly the same in
[34:59.740 --> 35:05.900]  cracked laws that will allow us to do that with these terrorists hundreds of
[35:05.900 --> 35:10.660]  thousands and if you read the violent radicalization act making its way through
[35:10.660 --> 35:13.980]  Congress in the last two years always being reintroduced they list
[35:13.980 --> 35:18.940]  architects and engineers for 9-11 truth as Al Qaeda they put it up on the big
[35:18.940 --> 35:21.900]  screen right next to Al Qaeda training videos and say we have to basically
[35:21.900 --> 35:26.540]  arrest all these people and that's what they're trying to set up hundreds of
[35:26.540 --> 35:31.140]  thousands of people and that's Halliburton KBR have been building camps
[35:31.140 --> 35:34.700]  publicly all over the nation it's all over the newspapers Houston Chronicles
[35:34.700 --> 35:38.660]  San Francisco Chronicles Chicago Rubin and then if you say I don't want to be
[35:38.660 --> 35:42.820]  in a camp they say there's no camps but we need camps and we need to put hundreds
[35:42.820 --> 35:49.180]  of thousands of you in it and we need to indefinitely and by the way secretly
[35:49.180 --> 35:53.420]  detain people and they use the word oh this is the democracy the Democrats now
[35:53.420 --> 36:00.660]  they own the war and it's true the Democrats the majority voted for the war
[36:00.660 --> 36:04.380]  they've been for it and now they've done a bait and switch they've got a new
[36:04.380 --> 36:12.100]  puppet in there with Barack Obama and of course Guantanamo Bay and the two
[36:12.100 --> 36:15.580]  camps there's the outer camp the inner CIA laboratory as it's called in the
[36:15.580 --> 36:20.140]  news and they admittedly to have done laboratory experiments in torture in
[36:20.140 --> 36:26.860]  deprivation in drugging the news has reported they have prostitutes come in
[36:26.860 --> 36:32.580]  and rape them with blood I'm not gonna go any more detail you can pull up the
[36:32.580 --> 36:39.180]  new the news articles there's blood involved this totally freaks out the
[36:39.180 --> 36:45.460]  men they also torture them with drugs they're on the facility this has all
[36:45.460 --> 36:48.860]  been admitted and then they have these congressmen always having press conferences
[36:48.860 --> 36:53.580]  going look at this delicious plate of food they get we're so nice we feed them
[36:53.580 --> 37:00.340]  you know they're treated much better than people in American prisons and they go
[37:00.340 --> 37:06.500]  on and on and on they get grabbed they get charged crowd hammer says there's no
[37:06.500 --> 37:11.220]  evidence and Kurt Nemo yesterday wrote a great article about this where he
[37:11.220 --> 37:16.380]  listed all of the government's own admissions where they would have the
[37:16.380 --> 37:24.260]  Taliban literally go out and put on a a roast a side of beef which is rare and
[37:24.260 --> 37:29.380]  very expensive there and invite down the goat herding villagers who literally
[37:29.380 --> 37:33.700]  are shown globes there have been news articles about this and don't even know
[37:33.700 --> 37:38.620]  about the shape of the planet or how it works their cavemen and they grab these
[37:38.620 --> 37:43.700]  poor people who live in the mountains and as young as 12 years of age and
[37:43.700 --> 37:47.860]  they're paid twenty five thousand dollars apiece special forces pick them up
[37:47.860 --> 37:55.220]  put them on c-130s gag them for the day-and-a-half flight and sensory
[37:55.220 --> 37:58.260]  deprivation that's what the goggles and the earplugs all about it makes
[37:58.260 --> 38:03.540]  anybody go crazy and they fly them out and they put them in a supermax
[38:03.540 --> 38:08.260]  prison style solitary confinement no phone calls are allowed no letters are
[38:08.260 --> 38:13.460]  allowed and their torture and the media isn't allowed in they're only allowed
[38:13.460 --> 38:16.700]  into the outer area of the camp where the troops stay or and they're allowed to
[38:16.700 --> 38:21.300]  see the food preparation area to go look we feed them and they say these are
[38:21.300 --> 38:26.500]  terrorists these are al-qaeda they carried out 9-11 under torture with no
[38:26.500 --> 38:33.500]  courts no process of law they say well they don't deserve it well the people
[38:33.500 --> 38:36.660]  deserve to know who they've got there and what they've got his innocent
[38:36.660 --> 38:43.940]  passage now they've got a few quote high level al-qaeda people and then they've
[38:43.940 --> 38:48.260]  had one of them remember he confessed to bombing buildings that didn't exist for
[38:48.260 --> 38:54.860]  two years after the time he was incarcerated they confessed to literally
[38:54.860 --> 38:59.580]  blowing up the Hennanburg sinking the Titanic killing Lincoln I mean it's
[38:59.580 --> 39:03.140]  that ridiculous and then now they come up this week and say oh they've all
[39:03.140 --> 39:08.220]  pled guilty seven of them have pled guilty to carrying out 9-11 then it
[39:08.220 --> 39:11.180]  comes out they didn't really plead guilty to that they were told we won't
[39:11.180 --> 39:15.780]  execute you if you'll plead guilty and then they said okay we might they said
[39:15.780 --> 39:21.700]  oh they they plead guilty and remember the so-called dirty bomber it turned out
[39:21.700 --> 39:27.060]  was literally an 80 IQ low-grade moron who'd been in prison who they just picked
[39:27.060 --> 39:31.820]  up and set up as a you know somebody shooting his mouth off and then it turned
[39:31.820 --> 39:35.860]  out that even the the Associated Press and others had to admit it was all
[39:35.860 --> 39:44.220]  staged and wasn't a real trial I mean so they give you kangaroo trials to to to
[39:44.220 --> 39:48.300]  create the illusion that there are really these supposed terrorists that
[39:48.300 --> 39:54.660]  aren't existing well let's say they are the worst terrorists in the world and
[39:54.660 --> 39:58.900]  with a walkie-talkie from caves they were able to make norad stand down and
[39:58.900 --> 40:02.500]  mass the US troops to invade Afghanistan the weeks before and they were able to
[40:02.500 --> 40:05.900]  have CIA drills with exact same targets being exact being attacked exact same
[40:05.900 --> 40:09.100]  time and they were able to have Muhammad Atta and the other hijackers
[40:09.100 --> 40:14.860]  trained at US military bases and they were ordered the guys with walkie-talkies
[40:14.860 --> 40:18.380]  were able to control the State Department and order the visa bureaus in
[40:18.380 --> 40:23.980]  Canada and Saudi Arabia to have US officers who refused like springman to
[40:23.980 --> 40:26.740]  let them back into the country because they were flagged as terrorists to be
[40:26.740 --> 40:30.900]  ordered to let them in saying they're really government agents I mean I mean
[40:30.900 --> 40:36.180]  let's just say the guys of walkie-talkies were able to do that and so with their
[40:36.180 --> 40:40.860]  walkie-talkies they were able to do this and they're really terrorist okay
[40:40.860 --> 40:44.980]  well our system is what's important and the evidence is what's important so
[40:44.980 --> 40:50.100]  let's see the evidence let's see that no they're saying we're setting the
[40:50.100 --> 40:57.380]  precedent with the Hollywood set that is Guantanamo Bay the real camps are in
[40:57.380 --> 41:03.620]  Poland and Czechoslovakia and Ukraine and Georgia and Syria of all places and
[41:03.620 --> 41:13.660]  Egypt and Hungary hungry and that's the camps where they torture people to death
[41:13.660 --> 41:19.700]  and give them acid baths and all the rest of it and that's come out and when
[41:19.700 --> 41:23.500]  it does come out when somebody blows the whistle on it one of the guards you see
[41:23.500 --> 41:27.700]  the Patriot Act invoked and a blonde-haired blue-eyed jail guard gets
[41:27.700 --> 41:32.620]  grabbed and disappears into it not al-Qaeda and that's what this oh you
[41:32.620 --> 41:38.780]  didn't see that report a few years ago that's what's going on here this is for
[41:38.780 --> 41:44.140]  the American people this whole thing has been set up for the American people but
[41:44.140 --> 41:49.900]  here's the good news this is so outrageous and this is so over the top
[41:49.900 --> 41:57.180]  that no amount of TV dramas like 24 glamorizing secret torture and torture
[41:57.180 --> 42:01.460]  of children in front of their parents they had a show called spooks in the
[42:01.460 --> 42:04.460]  UK where every episode they tortured kids in front of their parents and the
[42:04.460 --> 42:11.140]  good guys torture children no amount of that is going to ever sell the public on
[42:11.140 --> 42:15.380]  it and the cats out of the bag that the private offshore banks controlling our
[42:15.380 --> 42:20.020]  government stage the terror attacks and stage the Mumbai attacks and have staged
[42:20.020 --> 42:24.140]  all the other major attacks and the Germans just got caught staging terror
[42:24.140 --> 42:28.180]  attacks two weeks ago and that was mainstream news in Europe confirmed so
[42:28.180 --> 42:32.020]  the jig is up and you know what we're not intimidated by you and we're not
[42:32.020 --> 42:35.780]  going to shut up and we're going to go on air we're going to expose you and a lot
[42:35.780 --> 42:38.340]  of people in government who are compartmentalized now know what's
[42:38.340 --> 42:41.380]  happening and they don't like it being done in their name the American people
[42:41.380 --> 42:44.780]  don't like it being done in their name the British people the Canadian people
[42:44.780 --> 42:49.140]  the German people the French people the folks of Ireland the Italians the
[42:49.140 --> 42:55.700]  Russians the Japanese no one is for this and so we have a true coalition of the
[42:55.700 --> 42:59.340]  willing the people that believe in liberty and freedom and transparency and
[42:59.340 --> 43:09.100]  rule of law you're not going to get away with what you're doing the public is
[43:09.100 --> 43:12.220]  learning about how the world really works they're learning there's a world
[43:12.220 --> 43:17.340]  government openly being set up in the final stages of completion they build
[43:17.340 --> 43:21.260]  it in levels it's I mean there's multi levels of world government global
[43:21.260 --> 43:26.220]  governance in place and they brag about well what's the source on that hundreds
[43:26.220 --> 43:29.700]  of sources they're all up on info wars dot com or present one dot com the
[43:29.700 --> 43:39.060]  financial times of London and now for a world government by Gideon Rakeman and
[43:39.060 --> 43:44.580]  so we need to have a real debate about this do you like naftan get do you like
[43:44.580 --> 43:49.700]  what's done to the economy well how about getting that the power of ten do you
[43:49.700 --> 43:53.820]  like open borders how about getting that expanded radically do you like police
[43:53.820 --> 43:59.420]  tasering little old ladies for talking back do you like the police claiming it's
[43:59.420 --> 44:04.620]  the law you've got to take inoculations in Maryland and having everybody line up
[44:04.620 --> 44:09.340]  thousands of them outside with police dogs barking taking shots crying saying I
[44:09.340 --> 44:15.660]  don't want to take it when there's no law you realize how deep that tyranny is
[44:16.260 --> 44:21.580]  do you like that you think the cops doing that like it probably not do any of us
[44:21.580 --> 44:26.580]  want to go along with this is this good for 99.99999% of us it's not even good
[44:26.580 --> 44:29.740]  for the elite but it's the nature of bullies and thugs and criminals they
[44:29.740 --> 44:34.140]  always push further this is good for nobody no one even the elites it's not
[44:34.140 --> 44:42.940]  good for them but they've gone into megalomania they've gone into lunacy
[44:42.940 --> 44:46.800]  and they are just going wild it's what peanut documents said it's what
[44:46.800 --> 44:51.220]  brzezinski said in his last two books they said we have the power and we cannot
[44:51.220 --> 44:55.860]  miss this opportunity for total world tyranny we've got to do it and they are
[44:55.860 --> 45:00.340]  doing it I mean they came in and cut off liquidity and blamed it all on
[45:00.340 --> 45:02.980]  subprime mortgages which they now admitted nothing to do with they're
[45:02.980 --> 45:07.780]  not giving them relief they stole 8.5 trillion in seven weeks and counting
[45:07.780 --> 45:16.300]  that's over a trillion a week over a trillion a week openly going offshore and
[45:16.300 --> 45:21.060]  then they openly tell the Senate and the House in closed-door sessions we will
[45:21.060 --> 45:24.420]  declare martial law if you don't do this and then the congressman the senators
[45:24.420 --> 45:34.980]  go public and then it's in the Bloomberg it's in Bloomberg it's in the New York
[45:34.980 --> 45:43.620]  Times look at this Bernanke war powers undermine Fed Bank presidents and even
[45:43.620 --> 45:47.980]  the Fed Bank presidents the original banks are saying offshore interest fully
[45:47.980 --> 45:54.980]  control the New York branch and the DC branches of the banks and they are
[45:54.980 --> 46:02.660]  fully imploding the United States and moving all the capital offshore in secret
[46:02.660 --> 46:05.540]  with no consultation
[46:07.860 --> 46:11.180]  listen to this the board as you serve authority said William Poole former
[46:11.180 --> 46:14.580]  president of the St. Louis Fed and now a senior fellow at the Cato Institute
[46:14.580 --> 46:18.700]  trying to get him on in Washington this dramatic change in policy direction has
[46:18.700 --> 46:24.060]  not been announced or even acknowledged and then it goes into all of it right
[46:24.060 --> 46:28.540]  there the Financial Times comes out and says similar things the London
[46:28.540 --> 46:32.180]  Telegraph comes out yesterday with Evans Ambrose Pritchard and says yes
[46:32.180 --> 46:36.300]  there's riots all over Europe because this is the the New World Order this is
[46:36.300 --> 46:39.820]  globalization and it's undemocratic and there's going to be more what did the
[46:39.820 --> 46:43.900]  report 18 months ago the British Ministry of Defense report say it said the
[46:43.900 --> 46:49.140]  army's going to have to fight the people the army works for offshore banks that
[46:49.140 --> 46:54.540]  the middle class is being destroyed and they're going to rebel and then what does
[46:54.540 --> 46:59.060]  the army say what does a gate say
[46:59.820 --> 47:03.940]  what does he come out and say he says we're abolishing the National Guard it's
[47:03.940 --> 47:08.660]  going under the Homeland Security in Northcom the governor serve at the
[47:08.660 --> 47:14.900]  pleasure so they're titular now there they're openly ceremonial and we're
[47:14.900 --> 47:18.940]  going to use them 20,000 for starters against the American people for
[47:18.940 --> 47:24.580]  insurrection now what is it that's going to get these these these these these
[47:24.580 --> 47:29.460]  giant and I don't even mean physically fat I mean their souls these decadent
[47:29.460 --> 47:35.940]  giant walrus-like creatures that are so so decadent and petty and self-serving
[47:35.940 --> 47:41.580]  and lethargic psychologically mentally politically I mean what is it that the
[47:41.580 --> 47:51.140]  social engineers know that that these self-propelled spiritual stomachs these
[47:51.140 --> 47:55.460]  greedy selfish people what is it they they know that it's even going to get
[47:55.460 --> 48:04.540]  them moving it's hell and only admitting how bad things are and making
[48:04.540 --> 48:08.220]  preparation for it and warning people and screaming body murder people say oh
[48:08.220 --> 48:11.380]  you ought to relax you ought to put out your information in a calm way you
[48:11.380 --> 48:19.060]  should you know calm we need to be upset I'll assure you we can't walk around
[48:19.060 --> 48:25.260]  with limp wrists with our hands down at our sides taking small steps going when
[48:25.260 --> 48:28.180]  your house is on fire you got to get out of the house you got to call the fire
[48:28.180 --> 48:34.300]  department if a dam breaks ten miles up in the mountains and it's going to send
[48:34.300 --> 48:39.500]  30 40 feet of fast-moving water over the small hamlet below if you're a
[48:39.500 --> 48:43.220]  watchman up there and you see the dam break you don't go oh I think I'll
[48:43.220 --> 48:49.220]  mosey over here and take my time to the telephone to warn the fire department
[48:49.220 --> 48:55.300]  police department in the valley below I am and then you call and you say listen
[48:55.300 --> 49:02.860]  the dam just broke you know this is the watchtower up here and they go oh right
[49:02.860 --> 49:08.020]  there is a dam a conspiracy theory you go of course you know there's a dam up
[49:08.020 --> 49:14.220]  here of course you know we're up here it's broken it waters coming you've got
[49:14.220 --> 49:20.820]  about five minutes to evacuate the town to get to high ground they go oh dams
[49:20.820 --> 49:32.260]  dams don't exist water doesn't exist I mean that's what it's like and so you
[49:32.260 --> 49:36.780]  bet I'm up here screaming and yelling saying mayday mayday mayday I mean is it
[49:36.780 --> 49:43.420]  Mayday to have a foreign Federal Reserve openly threatening Congress with
[49:43.420 --> 49:51.140]  martial law and then telling Fed Bank regional governors even they're even
[49:51.140 --> 49:54.580]  complaining and they tell them you're not allowed to know what we're doing
[49:54.580 --> 50:01.940]  war powers act has been implemented and then it gets worse here's the New York
[50:01.940 --> 50:13.300]  Times today Fed weighs debt sales of its own more presents challenges
[50:13.300 --> 50:17.140]  very close cousins to existing Treasury bills now what a calm milk toast
[50:17.140 --> 50:22.380]  headline then you read it it says it's known as a money machine so the Fed
[50:22.380 --> 50:26.620]  before would have the Treasury issue currency after 1913 and then we have to

[56:16.580 --> 56:19.580]  cops something you want to live in a country like that because let me tell
[56:19.580 --> 56:23.620]  you the elites just don't want to grab people and put them in camps for fun
[56:23.620 --> 56:29.340]  they do that so they can implode societies and turn people into poor
[56:29.340 --> 56:34.340]  slaves so they're more easily managed and so they can consolidate wealth that's
[56:34.340 --> 56:38.140]  destroying the American dream so a lot of you aren't gonna listen a lot of you in
[56:38.140 --> 56:42.100]  the system are on power trips but remember when your standard living that's
[56:42.100 --> 56:46.580]  already dropping is in the toilet and a country that was great at least on the

[56:52.940 --> 57:00.980]  your face when you're paying carbon taxes when your fireplace is banned when
[57:00.980 --> 57:05.180]  your barbecue pit has a tax on it when space eaters are banned they're all
[57:05.180 --> 57:08.380]  announcing it's already happening in Europe they're banning bottled water and
[57:08.380 --> 57:12.860]  major u.s. cities and in Toronto Canada as all of it again to set the precedent
[57:12.860 --> 57:16.340]  we tell you what type of light bulb we have we tell you what type of toilet you
[57:16.340 --> 57:19.700]  can have we tell you what type of washing machine and stove and dryer and

[57:24.420 --> 57:27.940]  doesn't have any authority over its national security the president's just
[57:27.940 --> 57:33.700]  gonna do it and it's national security that foreign banks run America it's
[57:33.700 --> 57:40.340]  national security that they're gonna issue their own notes their own bonds
[57:40.340 --> 57:44.420]  see they're now just fully taking over you'll pay your taxes to the foreign
[57:44.420 --> 57:51.100]  banks you'll buy your securities from the foreign banks they put all the debt on
[57:51.100 --> 57:56.580]  the Treasury all the debt on America they bought the world in our name and then

[58:04.940 --> 58:08.500]  countries thousands of times they do it every decade over and over again in

[1:01:57.220 --> 1:02:04.500]  country a great article by one of our contributors Carolyn Harris up on info
[1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:09.980]  wars.com Gates memo announces final assimilation of National Guard troops
[1:02:09.980 --> 1:02:18.140]  on the streets of America and this is to take your land your property again the
[1:02:18.140 --> 1:02:23.700]  banks use your currency to buy up the world then they hand you all the debt

[1:02:34.340 --> 1:02:39.780]  currencies it will just the price the value of the currency the amount will
[1:02:39.780 --> 1:02:43.940]  be issued and controlled by them so they can control recessions depressions
[1:02:43.940 --> 1:02:50.900]  inflation deflation and it's in the New York Times today Fedways debt sales of
[1:02:50.900 --> 1:02:58.380]  its own and they call it more persistent challenges very close cousins to
[1:02:58.380 --> 1:03:05.700]  existing treasury bills here's another one Goldman Sachs buys into carbon
[1:03:05.700 --> 1:03:10.580]  offsets the new carbon taxation system oh you want to be able to use your car

[1:03:22.540 --> 1:03:30.660]  so sick and this is over every form of human activity and that nexus is in with
[1:03:30.660 --> 1:03:35.780]  this Reuters story Obama says climate change a matter of national security
[1:03:35.780 --> 1:03:43.660]  that way they can bypass the Congress and everything else of course they're
[1:03:43.660 --> 1:03:52.380]  bypassing it illegitimately it's complete tyranny the tyrant story you've got
[1:03:52.380 --> 1:03:58.420]  upon info wars.com a great analysis by Jessica's cafe American is the and it
[1:03:58.420 --> 1:04:01.940]  just links all these stories I just mentioned is the Fed taking the first
[1:04:01.940 --> 1:04:10.100]  steps to selectively default and devaluation again they will issue bonds
[1:04:10.100 --> 1:04:15.380]  that are AAA rated and the treasury bonds will not be you understand they're
[1:04:15.380 --> 1:04:20.580]  done with us now we've funded their new world order now they leave a rear guard
[1:04:20.580 --> 1:04:25.780]  of paramilitary troops to loot and steal and consolidate and we'll just be another
[1:04:25.780 --> 1:04:33.940]  third-world kingdom we have been looking for an out-of-the-box move from the Fed
[1:04:33.940 --> 1:04:36.740]  but this was not it the obvious game-changing move would have been
[1:04:36.740 --> 1:04:40.700]  the Treasury and the Fed to make an arrangement in which the Fed is able
[1:04:40.700 --> 1:04:44.100]  to purchase Treasury debt directly without subjecting it to an auction in
[1:04:44.100 --> 1:04:47.740]  the public market this is known as a money machine and it's prohibited by
[1:04:47.740 --> 1:04:52.940]  statute but as usual the Fed surprises us with their lack of transparency they're
[1:04:52.940 --> 1:04:57.980]  asking Congress about permission to issue their own debt directly not tied to
[1:04:57.980 --> 1:05:00.940]  treasuries we're not asking for permission they declared war powers
[1:05:00.940 --> 1:05:05.860]  Bloomberg this is known in central banking circles as cutting out the
[1:05:05.860 --> 1:05:09.820]  middleman not only does the Treasury no longer issue the currency but they will
[1:05:09.820 --> 1:05:14.780]  also no longer have any control over how much debt back currency the Fed can now
[1:05:14.780 --> 1:05:20.140]  issue directly if the Fed were able to issue its own debt which is currently
[1:05:20.140 --> 1:05:22.980]  limited to Federal Reserve notes backed by Treasuries under the Federal Reserve
[1:05:22.980 --> 1:05:27.500]  Act it would provide Bernanke the ability to present a different class of debt to
[1:05:27.500 --> 1:05:33.820]  the investment public and foreign central banks the public is in trouble folks the
[1:05:33.820 --> 1:05:37.420]  question is whether it would be backed with the same force as treasuries or
[1:05:37.420 --> 1:05:41.820]  subordinated or superior it'll be superior there will not be any lack of
[1:05:41.820 --> 1:05:46.020]  new Treasury debt issuance upon which to base the new Fed balance sheet
[1:05:46.020 --> 1:05:52.620]  expansion folks this is just they're open you're going to pay your taxes to
[1:05:52.620 --> 1:05:57.140]  them they will be the government the the private banks are becoming the

[1:08:12.660 --> 1:08:16.220]  exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the
[1:08:16.220 --> 1:08:20.140]  water that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others
[1:08:20.140 --> 1:08:24.820]  are absorbed into the skin the KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot

[1:09:05.180 --> 1:09:31.100]  now he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:09:31.100 --> 1:09:36.300]  the Federal Reserve is announcing that it's planning to issue its own Federal
[1:09:36.300 --> 1:09:42.660]  Reserve bonds on the world market just completely removing the Treasury but
[1:09:42.660 --> 1:09:47.980]  then you will pay taxes on those bonds they'll understand the Treasury will
[1:09:47.980 --> 1:09:52.940]  then basically pay them and so this is just open government by the banks that's
[1:09:52.940 --> 1:09:55.180]  what the new world order is that's what they told you in the last month and
[1:09:55.180 --> 1:09:59.300]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles hundreds they said a new world
[1:09:59.300 --> 1:10:04.420]  order the bankers will save you they're gonna fix everything when they
[1:10:04.420 --> 1:10:08.260]  engineered it and you will pay your carbon taxes your cap and trade taxes
[1:10:08.260 --> 1:10:12.420]  you know they're gonna control everything and then I read the banker
[1:10:12.420 --> 1:10:17.580]  takeover bill it's what it was and it said we are the government we are not
[1:10:17.580 --> 1:10:20.940]  transparent no one can investigate us we are separate from everyone we rule
[1:10:20.940 --> 1:10:26.100]  everything we have a divine right of kings and what did Fed Chairman Green
[1:10:26.100 --> 1:10:30.700]  Spence say on Lare News hour in fact pull that up John please it was from
[1:10:30.700 --> 1:10:36.300]  about three weeks ago he said you know Larry says well do you ever confer with
[1:10:36.300 --> 1:10:39.540]  presidents you ever get along with presidents he says I really don't care
[1:10:39.540 --> 1:10:43.660]  it did that they don't matter that they have no authority over us no court does
[1:10:43.660 --> 1:10:50.220]  no one does so he asked one question and gets another answer we're independent
[1:10:50.220 --> 1:10:54.620]  we do what we want we steal 8.4 trillion in seven weeks and then we send tax
[1:10:54.620 --> 1:10:59.420]  men to take the money out of you we implode the economy by design they cut
[1:10:59.420 --> 1:11:04.420]  off the money for the economy and then hoarded all themselves telling Congress
[1:11:04.420 --> 1:11:10.700]  give us this power or martial law will be declared already with the power and
[1:11:10.700 --> 1:11:17.500]  then they tell the federal reserve governors the regional governors they
[1:11:17.500 --> 1:11:22.020]  tell them you know what we don't even consult you anymore London's telling us
[1:11:22.020 --> 1:11:28.820]  what to do and it's all secret and then what is Bloomberg report talking to one
[1:11:28.820 --> 1:11:32.580]  of the Fed governors we've been told the war powers act has been in as has been
[1:11:32.580 --> 1:11:39.420]  implemented oh but see it wasn't about fighting Al Qaeda all those new powers it
[1:11:39.420 --> 1:11:44.820]  was about stealing a trillion three hundred billion a week in the last seven
[1:11:44.820 --> 1:11:52.580]  weeks it was about stealing a trillion three hundred billion and then let me
[1:11:52.580 --> 1:11:55.860]  tell you it's got value now and they're going out and leveraging it in the hedge
[1:11:55.860 --> 1:11:58.860]  funds and leveraging at the stock market and buying up all the depressed
[1:11:58.860 --> 1:12:02.140]  companies see they come out in bad mouth the economy say we're gonna have a
[1:12:02.140 --> 1:12:08.580]  depression nine weeks ago everything plunges they capitalize themselves with
[1:12:08.580 --> 1:12:12.820]  8.5 trillion and then corner the world market and buy everything up that they
[1:12:12.820 --> 1:12:19.820]  didn't already have very sick and they're only getting started and right at the
[1:12:19.820 --> 1:12:23.780]  moment you try to go out the streets and protest or riot they'll just blow up a
[1:12:23.780 --> 1:12:27.900]  federal building and say the people did it and then the cops will get all upset
[1:12:27.900 --> 1:12:31.940]  there'll be images of you know a dead child in a fireman's arm because the
[1:12:31.940 --> 1:12:35.860]  feds will bomb something that's got kids in it you know they love that and then
[1:12:35.860 --> 1:12:39.780]  the low-level feds and cops will get real mad next it we're mowing down the
[1:12:39.780 --> 1:12:50.980]  protesters they did it yeah it's all about manipulating you and they're just
[1:12:50.980 --> 1:12:54.740]  getting started let me see in seven weeks how many weeks are there in a
[1:12:54.740 --> 1:13:08.660]  year if they steal over a trillion every week how many trillions is that 30 plus
[1:13:08.660 --> 1:13:17.300]  trillion and they're just getting started I mean hell they stole two trillion
[1:13:17.300 --> 1:13:23.060]  the Associated Press reported out of the Pentagon pension funds that's why
[1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:26.380]  they're now announcing oh we know we signed contracts with Vietnam Korean
[1:13:26.380 --> 1:13:30.580]  War World War two vets that we'd always take care of your health care but now
[1:13:30.580 --> 1:13:35.980]  we're going back on that the money's gone folks your police pension funds your
[1:13:35.980 --> 1:13:41.380]  fire pension funds your teacher pension funds it's already gone you understand
[1:13:41.380 --> 1:13:46.620]  that they went out and bought coal mines and diamond mines and timber and
[1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:51.180]  shipping companies and they paid off governments to seed control of the
[1:13:51.180 --> 1:13:55.820]  shipping lanes to them in key regions and to seed control the roads and the
[1:13:55.820 --> 1:14:00.100]  power plants and the infrastructures it's called privatization where they pay
[1:14:00.100 --> 1:14:03.580]  a pittance of what it's really worth to public works that were built by the
[1:14:03.580 --> 1:14:09.580]  people and our money and they just take it and then all that money was free we
[1:14:09.580 --> 1:14:12.860]  had to pay for it then they double triple quadruple the price of that water
[1:14:12.860 --> 1:14:17.640]  that aquifer they grabbed that highway they grabbed or they have the people
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:21.740]  build new roads and then they slap a toll road on them and the money all goes
[1:14:21.740 --> 1:14:28.860]  to the far offshore corporations it is just merciless robbery like guys running
[1:14:28.860 --> 1:14:32.420]  into a bank pulling out their guns pistol whipping the guard pistol whipping the
[1:14:32.420 --> 1:14:36.100]  bank president because he won't open the vault grabbing the gudge and just for
[1:14:36.100 --> 1:14:40.860]  fun spraying the people laying on the ground with a machine gun bullets as
[1:14:40.860 --> 1:14:46.060]  they leave and laughing water criminals very often do that because they like it
[1:14:46.060 --> 1:14:52.740]  it isn't just that they like stealing all that money it's that they enjoy pistol
[1:14:52.740 --> 1:14:57.660]  whipping people they enjoy shooting people they enjoy the adrenaline rush
[1:14:57.660 --> 1:15:02.580]  it's hunting it's their hunting instincts turned against their own species they
[1:15:02.580 --> 1:15:06.700]  like the wild exhilaration of driving away in the stolen truck with all the
[1:15:06.700 --> 1:15:11.780]  cash and switching it out in a warehouse and driving off
[1:15:12.220 --> 1:15:16.140]  well see it's the same mentality on a wide scale but with think tanks and
[1:15:16.140 --> 1:15:23.020]  armies and intelligence and spy satellites and super bio weapons but
[1:15:23.020 --> 1:15:26.260]  that's their mid-level servants that like the killing and the and the stealing
[1:15:26.260 --> 1:15:32.700]  and the excitement up top it's these well scores of generations on top of
[1:15:32.700 --> 1:15:39.460]  each other inbred families who have a disdain for the public and they have
[1:15:39.460 --> 1:15:44.380]  enshrined and institutionalized and it made a religion out of killing and
[1:15:44.380 --> 1:15:49.740]  stealing and hurting and the New World Order is a wonderland for psychopathic
[1:15:49.740 --> 1:15:55.660]  killers and control freaks it is a place for the priest of power to go on and on
[1:15:55.660 --> 1:15:59.740]  debasing humanity pulling it down crushing it debasing the language
[1:15:59.740 --> 1:16:04.540]  reducing it biologically chemically poisoning and dumbing down the public
[1:16:04.540 --> 1:16:09.300]  they revel in children dying of leukemia and all these cancers they revel in
[1:16:09.300 --> 1:16:13.140]  people being poisoned by the food and water in the GMO they revel it's about
[1:16:13.140 --> 1:16:17.620]  power it's about the exercise of power
[1:16:17.620 --> 1:16:27.740]  that's what it's all about and they and they've been building for decades with
[1:16:27.740 --> 1:16:32.220]  the media and the propaganda and step by step dumbing you down slowing your
[1:16:32.220 --> 1:16:36.820]  mind making sure you weren't taught basic systems and how the world operates in
[1:16:36.820 --> 1:16:40.940]  history and and turning you against your neighbors and and turning you into an
[1:16:40.940 --> 1:16:49.620]  evil decadent petty narcissistic mindless creature to where you don't
[1:16:49.620 --> 1:16:52.100]  even care about yourself much less others see those who only care about
[1:16:52.100 --> 1:16:54.260]  themselves they don't understand they really don't even care about themselves
[1:16:54.260 --> 1:16:57.980]  they care about themselves they care about others it's all symbiotic but
[1:16:57.980 --> 1:17:03.340]  they don't and so now they set up their world government where everything you
[1:17:03.340 --> 1:17:07.300]  do will be run by the private banks that make up the New World Order through
[1:17:07.300 --> 1:17:13.300]  their international private boards over trade over energy over technology over
[1:17:13.300 --> 1:17:19.620]  terrorism over military over an environment and every facet of your
[1:17:19.620 --> 1:17:25.340]  life will be micromanaged by the dumbed-down hulk of humanity fastoon
[1:17:25.340 --> 1:17:32.860]  with badges and fancy hats prodding you like dim-witted ogres like dim from
[1:17:32.860 --> 1:17:39.580]  clockwork orange ruling over what's left of humanity oh yes they've got plenty
[1:17:39.580 --> 1:17:45.100]  to work with now of mindless backstabbing psychopathic scum
[1:17:45.540 --> 1:17:49.700]  who themselves will lovingly drink the Diet Coke filled with aspartame and
[1:17:49.700 --> 1:17:54.660]  lovingly inject their children with the flu shots themselves while they
[1:17:54.660 --> 1:18:01.860]  throttle and attack and squeeze the public and all over the nation good
[1:18:01.860 --> 1:18:05.540]  sheriffs the true power in the county elected by the people one of the last
[1:18:05.540 --> 1:18:09.980]  vestiges of common law are saying what's the point of kicking everybody out
[1:18:09.980 --> 1:18:12.940]  of their houses then the housing value goes down even more and nobody can buy
[1:18:12.940 --> 1:18:16.940]  them and the banks say we don't care we just want to consolidate it bottom out
[1:18:16.940 --> 1:18:19.980]  the economy to consolidate it for ourselves and the sheriffs are saying
[1:18:19.980 --> 1:18:23.460]  well you get somebody else then to go through all these families out of their
[1:18:23.460 --> 1:18:30.060]  houses and so they announced the governors are under north com control the
[1:18:30.060 --> 1:18:33.620]  governors are puppets and any governor that messes with Goldman Sachs or Bank
[1:18:33.620 --> 1:18:38.900]  of America they're all corrupt they only let corrupt people get into power 99%
[1:18:38.900 --> 1:18:43.260]  of the time and so anytime they want they're all under FBI surveillance they've
[1:18:43.260 --> 1:18:46.540]  all been taught they can be as corrupt as they want but they're making examples
[1:18:46.540 --> 1:19:00.540]  of them right now in New York in Illinois showing them you do what we say but
[1:19:00.540 --> 1:19:04.940]  again this is also untenable this is also outrageous that the public puts up
[1:19:04.940 --> 1:19:09.780]  even a spoken word fight just says no just boycotts just calls in to talk
[1:19:09.780 --> 1:19:15.740]  radio just writes news articles just goes on blogs and comments just puts up a
[1:19:15.740 --> 1:19:19.860]  micro FM transmitter and puts out Genesis whatever you've got to do make
[1:19:19.860 --> 1:19:22.620]  copies of my films other films that are out there I think we're doing the best
[1:19:22.620 --> 1:19:26.820]  work that's why I recommend my own work we a lot of others only recommend have
[1:19:26.820 --> 1:19:31.700]  viewing parties of video educate people this thing is so horrifying the only
[1:19:31.700 --> 1:19:35.780]  hurdle we've got to get over is getting the public to be able to admit the horror
[1:19:35.780 --> 1:19:41.180]  of what's really happening because now they've got a surface now they've got a
[1:19:41.180 --> 1:19:45.260]  merge they're openly announcing world government's gonna tax you and run your
[1:19:45.260 --> 1:19:48.700]  life so they have to admit it now the enemy is very weak right now that's
[1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:51.660]  what they're trying to act like they're in charge with all this bravada with all
[1:19:51.660 --> 1:19:56.380]  the troops but just flaunting it with them on TV going we need to put hundreds
[1:19:56.380 --> 1:20:02.420]  of thousands of Americans in secret camps torture is good again like it's in
[1:20:02.420 --> 1:20:06.460]  plain view if you have a public that has no morals they're like a blank screen you
[1:20:06.460 --> 1:20:10.100]  can project whatever you want on to and the elites hoping that that you're just
[1:20:10.100 --> 1:20:14.700]  a blank screen they can just tell you torture is good secret arrest is good
[1:20:14.700 --> 1:20:18.620]  trillions taken by foreign banks is good they're just hoping that you have no
[1:20:18.620 --> 1:20:24.540]  mind of your own you go okay and then you take their hand they go here do what I
[1:20:24.540 --> 1:20:28.220]  say and everything will be alright let me run everything let me let me let me set
[1:20:28.220 --> 1:20:32.740]  up death camps alright let me put my hand in yours everything will be okay if I
[1:20:32.740 --> 1:20:39.180]  just go along with that and you see them toggling off with the vampires into the
[1:20:39.180 --> 1:20:44.700]  dark the public like a little children little arrogant spoiled children putting
[1:20:44.700 --> 1:20:49.780]  their little hand into the vampires grasp as it drags them off into the
[1:20:49.780 --> 1:20:55.180]  darkness Ohio Sheriff orders deputies not to evict Sheriff itself as Ohio's
[1:20:55.180 --> 1:20:58.180]  order deputies to ignore eviction orders when people have nowhere else to live

[1:25:22.700 --> 1:25:34.020]  accelerating tens of millions are going to be homeless millions already are the
[1:25:34.020 --> 1:25:40.340]  banks are just cutting the money off a little bit of money you will have in
[1:25:40.340 --> 1:25:44.620]  the economy will be deflated in value right now we're in such a
[1:25:44.620 --> 1:25:49.620]  depressionary implosion that the currency still has some value but it
[1:25:49.620 --> 1:25:52.940]  will in the next year to two years the hyperinflation will overlay with that the
[1:25:52.940 --> 1:25:57.780]  perfect storm hyper stag inflation and what's going to happen things are going
[1:25:57.780 --> 1:26:01.140]  to break down everything is going to be federalized people are going to live in
[1:26:01.140 --> 1:26:05.460]  work camps others are going to have neighborhood spies environmental spies
[1:26:05.460 --> 1:26:12.460]  they're going to want the jobs want the power they are going to shut down the
[1:26:12.460 --> 1:26:16.020]  internet one and go to internet two that we've covered at nauseam where you
[1:26:16.020 --> 1:26:19.220]  won't be able to post what you want have your own website you'll have sub
[1:26:19.220 --> 1:26:26.580]  domains on internet to you only have my space YouTube Google less than a thousand
[1:26:26.580 --> 1:26:30.820]  major marquee sites and you're only allowed to have sub domains with them
[1:26:30.820 --> 1:26:38.340]  and universities filtering systems it's all coming in because they can't have
[1:26:38.340 --> 1:26:42.700]  free speech while this is happening the good news is the cats out of the bag
[1:26:42.700 --> 1:26:50.220]  the genies out of the bottle the horses out of the gate as they say and they
[1:26:50.220 --> 1:26:53.780]  haven't they're not perfect they're not omnipresent and they're not getting away
[1:26:53.780 --> 1:27:01.460]  with this and our sheriffs while we tried to get you know former sheriff
[1:27:01.460 --> 1:27:06.660]  reelected great sheriff Raymond Frank who would have stood up against us in
[1:27:06.660 --> 1:27:09.940]  Travis County and there are good sheriffs across the nation who understand
[1:27:09.940 --> 1:27:12.780]  their guardians of the people and they need to be there to stand up against the
[1:27:12.780 --> 1:27:18.620]  feds and with that type of moral courage those are the type of places in an
[1:27:18.620 --> 1:27:23.020]  effective resistance will be formed and that's why Northcom abolishes the
[1:27:23.020 --> 1:27:25.700]  control of the governors in the counties and of course it's illegitimate
[1:27:25.700 --> 1:27:29.740]  it's fraudulent that's why the Marines and army have been training for 20 years
[1:27:29.740 --> 1:27:33.740]  that I know of to take over US cities and it's on video in my police state
[1:27:33.740 --> 1:27:38.900]  series of films Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones says evictions in winter
[1:27:38.900 --> 1:27:44.860]  weather and during an economic recession are heartless and those cases should be
[1:27:44.860 --> 1:27:48.460]  sent back to the courts and resolve some other way Jones on Tuesday ordered
[1:27:48.460 --> 1:27:51.860]  deputies to ensure that people have shelter before they are forced out of
[1:27:51.860 --> 1:27:56.700]  their homes you also sent a letter to governor Ted Strickland asking him to
[1:27:56.700 --> 1:28:00.100]  issue a state order to stop forced evictions for at least the winter months
[1:28:00.100 --> 1:28:05.700]  not if the bankers don't want it war powers are now in place and it's not
[1:28:05.700 --> 1:28:09.740]  about fighting al-Qaeda it's about taking houses like I told you years ago
[1:28:09.740 --> 1:28:15.780]  they do it in third world countries every month the sheriff could face court
[1:28:15.780 --> 1:28:19.020]  action of a bank or landlord challenges refusal to honor the court ordered
[1:28:19.020 --> 1:28:22.700]  eviction then he'll become a hero folks then that's the type of person you run
[1:28:22.700 --> 1:28:26.460]  for governor go through it sheriff don't back off let him sue you go through
[1:28:26.460 --> 1:28:30.260]  hell even if they beat you do the right thing it's your morals it's who you are
[1:28:30.260 --> 1:28:38.140]  as a man that comes first Jones says he will face any consequences of his
[1:28:38.140 --> 1:28:43.900]  order yeah that's what I like that's the spirit and more of us would just step
[1:28:43.900 --> 1:28:50.100]  forward if more of us would just say look I'm not moving I'm not going along
[1:28:50.100 --> 1:28:54.860]  with what you're saying I'm not backing down it's one thing the yuppies buying
[1:28:54.860 --> 1:28:57.580]  houses for investments and flipping them and they're turning the keys in they can
[1:28:57.580 --> 1:29:00.420]  move into something smaller moving with family we're talking about poor
[1:29:00.420 --> 1:29:06.500]  families in Chicago and Dallas and New York and Los Angeles they're going on
[1:29:06.500 --> 1:29:09.980]  the streets there are tent cities with hundreds of thousands living in them in
[1:29:09.980 --> 1:29:17.820]  California and Nevada alone New Mexico Michigan their tent cities popping up
[1:29:17.820 --> 1:29:26.780]  everywhere and it's gonna get worse because the paychecks won't pay the
[1:29:26.780 --> 1:29:34.300]  bills even if you can get a job and it's gonna get worse and worse and worse and
[1:29:34.300 --> 1:29:39.220]  we're gonna try to stay standing through all of us that's why in the last year
[1:29:39.220 --> 1:29:43.620]  I've been trying to capitalize we never really spent our time trying to
[1:29:43.620 --> 1:29:46.620]  capitalize so I can never hire enough people do the job we needed to do so
[1:29:46.620 --> 1:29:50.700]  it's a catch-22 I've got a capitalize and what so we're trying to get funds in
[1:29:50.700 --> 1:29:54.340]  so that's why when you buy the books and videos at info wars calm you're not
[1:29:54.340 --> 1:29:57.700]  just getting a powerful tool to wake up people in your area to show on the truth
[1:29:57.700 --> 1:30:02.940]  you're also funding this beacon that is exponentially growing on the AM and FM
[1:30:02.940 --> 1:30:07.060]  shortwave satellite and the internet millions and millions every week on
[1:30:07.060 --> 1:30:14.900]  just what we can gauge are listening to the podcast and live streams it is
[1:30:14.900 --> 1:30:21.100]  amazing you know a lot of our streams are windows and our CDN delivered and so
[1:30:21.100 --> 1:30:24.660]  they're not even seen on shoutcasts about half our streams we would be number
[1:30:24.660 --> 1:30:28.780]  one in every category not just talk radio and why do I care about that
[1:30:28.780 --> 1:30:34.180]  because then we're at the top and everybody clicks on number one but I
[1:30:34.180 --> 1:30:38.980]  can't get the IT solutions to be able to do that we're stretched that thin so we
[1:30:38.980 --> 1:30:44.140]  need more capital you want to make donations send us a check send us a
[1:30:44.140 --> 1:30:47.380]  money order send us FRM notes you want to buy books and videos you want to buy a

[1:34:19.260 --> 1:34:27.140]  testing melamine in the baby formula the AP reported 90% of it has melamine in
[1:34:27.140 --> 1:34:31.900]  it causes kidney failure all sorts of problems build a bunch of people as you
[1:34:31.900 --> 1:34:39.580]  know in China and some here in the US builds up now they go to the testing
[1:34:39.580 --> 1:34:43.260]  facilities they've been told by the FDA who gives them a lot of their business
[1:34:43.260 --> 1:34:48.220]  oh well we're not allowed to test below one parts per million now so we're just
[1:34:48.220 --> 1:34:52.540]  not going to let you test with us so that's that's becoming a big issue and
[1:34:52.540 --> 1:34:57.740]  saw a report out of CNN one in three toys is toxic group says environmental
[1:34:57.740 --> 1:35:00.900]  group says many items for sale of high levels of lead arsenic and other
[1:35:00.900 --> 1:35:05.940]  chemicals and no group is out there is worse than toys because they're cheaply
[1:35:05.940 --> 1:35:09.260]  made they're quickly made most of them are made in China or other third world
[1:35:09.260 --> 1:35:15.300]  nations Jeff Gerhardt is the research director of healthy toys org a division
[1:35:15.300 --> 1:35:21.460]  of the ecology center and they do a lot of testing and so he joins us today Jeff
[1:35:21.460 --> 1:35:25.420]  tell us a little bit about your background and the healthy toy org the
[1:35:25.420 --> 1:35:30.260]  ecology center and then let's get into what we're dealing with with one in three
[1:35:30.260 --> 1:35:36.220]  toys is toxic yeah thanks for having me on I can give you a little background
[1:35:36.220 --> 1:35:41.500]  that we've been doing a product testing for a couple years now looking at that
[1:35:41.500 --> 1:35:46.860]  we we first started testing vehicle interiors looking at trim components
[1:35:46.860 --> 1:35:49.900]  feet components and different components vehicle interiors we've also
[1:35:49.900 --> 1:35:54.900]  tested children's car seats some other children's products and we've been
[1:35:54.900 --> 1:36:01.980]  doing a toy screen for two years now last year we tested around 1300 toys this
[1:36:01.980 --> 1:36:08.860]  year we tested a little over 1500 for a set of for lead and some other heavy
[1:36:08.860 --> 1:36:13.060]  metals and other chemicals of concern so this is the second year for that
[1:36:13.060 --> 1:36:21.660]  project then from a big picture perspective you mentioned one in three
[1:36:21.660 --> 1:36:27.060]  being tested high with the significant levels of chemicals of concern that is
[1:36:27.060 --> 1:36:33.540]  that that actually is an improvement over last year we do see a in improving
[1:36:33.540 --> 1:36:39.340]  trend we're seeing fewer toys with high levels of lead and fewer toys in the
[1:36:39.340 --> 1:36:46.180]  high-concern category one in three is entirely too much still but we we have
[1:36:46.180 --> 1:36:52.140]  seen that that trend and and we track it directly back to informed and active
[1:36:52.140 --> 1:36:56.820]  consumers that are really pushing manufacturers and retailers and
[1:36:56.820 --> 1:37:01.100]  demanding that they get cleaner products well I think the answer is not buying
[1:37:01.100 --> 1:37:06.940]  the Chinese slave made slave wage made toys and going back to buying wooden
[1:37:06.940 --> 1:37:10.860]  toys old-fashioned toys and that's what children play with it to begin with I
[1:37:10.860 --> 1:37:14.300]  mean you know I've bought my children the Chinese junk and they don't even
[1:37:14.300 --> 1:37:20.380]  play with it yeah we at about 80% of the market about 80% of the toys we
[1:37:20.380 --> 1:37:25.100]  tested were from China it's probably a little bit higher than that in the market
[1:37:25.100 --> 1:37:31.060]  right now and you know we actually looked at that we have a two-year
[1:37:31.060 --> 1:37:38.460]  snapshot of data and and while the toys from China are slightly higher more
[1:37:38.460 --> 1:37:42.820]  likely to have elevated levels of lead it's not a huge difference we found
[1:37:42.820 --> 1:37:47.340]  about 21 percent of toys from China we tested had detectable levels of lead
[1:37:47.340 --> 1:37:53.820]  compared to 16 percent from all the other countries together so we do
[1:37:53.820 --> 1:37:58.100]  emphasize that it's somewhat of a wholesale problem we find products
[1:37:58.100 --> 1:38:02.020]  made in coming from just about every country where we've been able to
[1:38:02.020 --> 1:38:09.940]  identify some issues and ultimately we kind of track it back to the fact that
[1:38:09.940 --> 1:38:15.700]  we have a regulatory structure in the u.s. that is is ancient we it's the toys
[1:38:15.700 --> 1:38:20.660]  are regulated under a law passed in 1970s called the Toxic Substance Control Act
[1:38:20.660 --> 1:38:26.820]  passed 1976 and that law is one of the worst environmental laws on the books
[1:38:26.820 --> 1:38:32.500]  it has not been modernized since then and the U.S. regulatory structure for
[1:38:32.500 --> 1:38:38.060]  chemicals and products is among the worst in the in the world so with that
[1:38:38.060 --> 1:38:42.540]  type type of regulatory approach we're prone to getting these types of products
[1:38:42.540 --> 1:38:50.260]  in the U.S. market what type of toys are toxic what was the most toxic toy you
[1:38:50.260 --> 1:38:55.380]  found well you know we do highlight one of the big categories where it's a
[1:38:55.380 --> 1:39:00.380]  problem is the cheap children's jewelry a lot of that you know some of it it's
[1:39:00.380 --> 1:39:05.500]  either die-cast you know last year in 2007 we found a lot of that jewelry was
[1:39:05.500 --> 1:39:12.100]  actually literally die-cast lead it was 90 95% lead with die-cast lead components
[1:39:12.100 --> 1:39:17.140]  and those are the types of products where you know children can ingest that
[1:39:17.140 --> 1:39:23.980]  and can really suffer from acute lead poisoning this year we found that lead
[1:39:23.980 --> 1:39:28.380]  or cheap children's jewelry was five times as likely than other products we
[1:39:28.380 --> 1:39:32.740]  tested to have levels of lead over the legal limit so that's one category of
[1:39:32.740 --> 1:39:37.300]  products that given the current regulatory structure we we really
[1:39:37.300 --> 1:39:42.340]  caution parents and consumers against against purchasing it and I think you
[1:39:42.340 --> 1:39:48.820]  highlighted you know natural products wood products you know fabric products
[1:39:48.820 --> 1:39:52.860]  you know I think I think those are better choices we do still occasionally
[1:39:52.860 --> 1:39:57.700]  find problems with some of those products but I think in general one of our
[1:39:57.700 --> 1:40:04.020]  concerns is is vinyl products and products that use soft plastics those
[1:40:04.020 --> 1:40:08.780]  are more prone to having hazardous additives in them than some other
[1:40:08.780 --> 1:40:14.620]  products let's shift gears over over into cars I mean I am from looking at
[1:40:14.620 --> 1:40:18.180]  these studies it's just literally everything the large percentage of the
[1:40:18.180 --> 1:40:23.740]  time has all these poisons so we're in a toxic environment well right and we
[1:40:23.740 --> 1:40:29.220]  we try to emphasize and then because we've done so much sampling that this
[1:40:29.220 --> 1:40:34.420]  is a this is a economy-wide problem in terms of the products that are in our
[1:40:34.420 --> 1:40:40.180]  homes our offices and our vehicles where we're seeing these chemicals show up in
[1:40:40.180 --> 1:40:47.140]  electronics computers TVs home furnishing couches and upholstered
[1:40:47.140 --> 1:40:51.860]  furniture cars we're seeing many of the same that the chemicals show up so
[1:40:51.860 --> 1:40:59.700]  again we've we've done a healthy car org which is our car site we've we've
[1:40:59.700 --> 1:41:06.540]  evaluated over 450 new vehicles from the 2006 through some of the 2009 model
[1:41:06.540 --> 1:41:11.620]  your vehicles and looked at and did a comparative ranking of the vehicles to
[1:41:11.620 --> 1:41:14.420]  look at the level of some of these chemicals in them so again it's a nice
[1:41:14.420 --> 1:41:17.740]  consumer site where you can actually go look up a vehicle and see how it
[1:41:17.740 --> 1:41:22.060]  compares to the other vehicles that are on the market you guys are really
[1:41:22.060 --> 1:41:26.180]  providing a wonderful service a life-giving life-saving service what
[1:41:26.180 --> 1:41:31.340]  are some of the safer brands of cars versus more dangerous brands or is it
[1:41:31.340 --> 1:41:37.940]  not a brand issue is it more you know per vehicle well you know it's interesting
[1:41:37.940 --> 1:41:43.700]  because just just like with toys when you look at vehicles many of the
[1:41:43.700 --> 1:41:48.300]  manufacturers have shown they can produce a vehicle without the chemicals so
[1:41:48.300 --> 1:41:55.460]  what while there are some brands you know we've highlighted Volvo's and Toyota
[1:41:55.460 --> 1:42:00.020]  and Honda in the past is having better performing vehicles overall actually
[1:42:00.020 --> 1:42:08.380]  our 2008 survey testing we did the manufacturer that was improving the
[1:42:08.380 --> 1:42:14.140]  most was general mortars they they they still have a way to go but overall when
[1:42:14.140 --> 1:42:17.340]  we looked at the averages in their vehicles now they had they were
[1:42:17.340 --> 1:42:22.820]  definitely in a in a improving trend so so again I think it's a little
[1:42:22.820 --> 1:42:28.300]  difficult to track it to specific brand but you know but we know that all the
[1:42:28.300 --> 1:42:32.420]  brands can make vehicles that are cleaner and bottom line it's not
[1:42:32.420 --> 1:42:37.980]  regulation that is improving things from the all-time crisis levels of several
[1:42:37.980 --> 1:42:43.900]  years ago it is watchdog groups it is consumer advocate groups it is the
[1:42:43.900 --> 1:42:49.820]  free market that is doing that did you ever hear the CNBC piece where they
[1:42:49.820 --> 1:42:57.540]  said that poison and toys was good I'm not sure I saw that one but you know
[1:42:57.540 --> 1:43:02.380]  you know we we think there's there's no reason for these chemicals and toys and
[1:43:02.380 --> 1:43:07.420]  and and we think that because of what we know about how toys are made and how
[1:43:07.420 --> 1:43:12.460]  cars are made but we also think that because when you look at the toys and
[1:43:12.460 --> 1:43:16.140]  cars that are on the market two-thirds of the two-thirds of the toys we tested
[1:43:16.140 --> 1:43:21.340]  were produced without these chemicals in them and toys rep from all the different
[1:43:21.340 --> 1:43:24.140]  manufacturers whether you're talking Mattel or whether you're talking a
[1:43:24.140 --> 1:43:29.860]  smaller niche brand the company know how to do this it's not a an engineering
[1:43:29.860 --> 1:43:33.880]  feed the car companies know how to do they just choose to cut corners and save
[1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:37.380]  money and then poison themselves let me play you this clip because now that's
[1:43:37.380 --> 1:43:42.060]  sounds made up when I say that but I've seen this across the media the
[1:43:42.060 --> 1:43:46.820]  corporate media saying hey poison is good for the free market no it's not what
[1:43:46.820 --> 1:43:51.300]  it does is destroy markets and destroy people's confidence here it is but
[1:43:51.300 --> 1:43:54.660]  inflation that's another interesting point because a lot of people like to
[1:43:54.660 --> 1:43:58.660]  say scare monger about China right a lot of politicians and I know you talk
[1:43:58.660 --> 1:44:01.300]  about that issue all the time I think people should be careful what they
[1:44:01.300 --> 1:44:05.420]  wish for on China you know if China were to revalue its currency or China is to
[1:44:05.420 --> 1:44:08.780]  start making say toys that don't have lead in them or food that isn't poisonous
[1:44:08.780 --> 1:44:13.020]  their cost of production are going to go up and that means prices at Walmart here
[1:44:13.020 --> 1:44:16.580]  in the United States are going to go up too so I would say China is our greatest
[1:44:16.580 --> 1:44:19.340]  friend right now they're keeping prices low and they're keeping prices for
[1:44:19.340 --> 1:44:25.820]  mortgages low too what okay so what do you think of that well you know I again
[1:44:25.820 --> 1:44:31.100]  as I said before I think it's it's a wholesale problem throughout the
[1:44:31.100 --> 1:44:36.860]  economy and it has to be dealt with in that way and again educated active
[1:44:36.860 --> 1:44:43.540]  consumers and citizens are the best defense here and demanding from
[1:44:43.540 --> 1:44:47.060]  manufacturers and retailers that they tell them what they're what's in the
[1:44:47.060 --> 1:44:52.300]  product and that they develop themselves healthier products is key to all of this
[1:44:52.300 --> 1:44:57.500]  fixing the regulatory structure ultimately is going to be needed but
[1:44:57.500 --> 1:45:04.420]  at the grassroots level you know there is a significant and growing niche of
[1:45:04.420 --> 1:45:09.140]  folks that you know don't want to buy these products anymore and ultimately
[1:45:09.140 --> 1:45:14.500]  if that's going to be the key component to driving change here I've told my
[1:45:14.500 --> 1:45:18.860]  wife the last few years we're not buying any mainline junk toys because I'm not
[1:45:18.860 --> 1:45:23.820]  bringing poison into my house and we've just you know got to do it and and that
[1:45:23.820 --> 1:45:27.460]  will certainly voting with your dollars will make them fix the problem you know
[1:45:27.460 --> 1:45:31.420]  some people say don't whine don't complain shut up greatest country in the
[1:45:31.420 --> 1:45:36.820]  world I mean it's just an arrogant mass psychosis that we see by so many people
[1:45:36.820 --> 1:45:42.020]  in the society when the truth is in every case in history where the public
[1:45:42.020 --> 1:45:46.380]  isn't vigilant isn't involved isn't informed really bad things happen and
[1:45:46.380 --> 1:45:50.660]  bad things are happening and so that's why I commend you in a separate area that
[1:45:50.660 --> 1:45:56.060]  I know the ecology center covers dealing with GMO I mean I don't like the
[1:45:56.060 --> 1:45:59.380]  federal regulators because they can be bought off and they'll approve you know
[1:45:59.380 --> 1:46:03.700]  aspartame when it killed most the monkeys that it was fed to they'll
[1:46:03.700 --> 1:46:09.140]  approve Prozac when they knew that it gave massive increase in suicides in
[1:46:09.140 --> 1:46:12.860]  the government studies in the early 1980s they still approved it because of
[1:46:12.860 --> 1:46:17.740]  political payoffs and the same thing goes for melamine now the the food and
[1:46:17.740 --> 1:46:22.220]  drug administrations just saying you know what melamine is not bad it's it's
[1:46:22.220 --> 1:46:25.940]  you know in small levels it's actually probably good for you or mercury is good
[1:46:25.940 --> 1:46:29.540]  for you I have other feds saying mercury is actually good for children's brains if
[1:46:29.540 --> 1:46:33.620]  you don't believe me I'll play it but the point here is is that it is the
[1:46:33.620 --> 1:46:38.180]  government so corrupt now you know you got a bunch of Governor Leguiovich is
[1:46:38.180 --> 1:46:41.020]  up there who just can you know do or whatever they I know it's a federal deal
[1:46:41.020 --> 1:46:45.420]  but that's just a an example and so a few years ago as you know that the big
[1:46:45.420 --> 1:46:48.740]  agribusiness came in and lobbied the feds to change the law where when
[1:46:48.740 --> 1:46:52.220]  something says it's organic federal approval federal seal it's not really
[1:46:52.220 --> 1:46:56.180]  organic so I think instead of the feds even being the solution they are the
[1:46:56.180 --> 1:47:02.300]  problem go ahead well you know I wouldn't disagree with you that you know
[1:47:02.300 --> 1:47:09.560]  citizen and consumer advocacy on this is clearly first and foremost where the
[1:47:09.560 --> 1:47:14.540]  cutting edge of changes on this and you know you can look at toys with the
[1:47:14.540 --> 1:47:20.380]  lead issue and there's you know right now the level of 600 parts per million
[1:47:20.380 --> 1:47:24.020]  we don't believe there should be any lead in toys and we're still fighting that
[1:47:24.020 --> 1:47:28.860]  fight at the at the government legislative level of trying to just
[1:47:28.860 --> 1:47:32.780]  of those people trying to justify that there should be lead in toys and we
[1:47:32.780 --> 1:47:36.380]  think that's a ridiculous position but as you said there are many toys that are
[1:47:36.380 --> 1:47:40.660]  pure lead there's some that are pure lead but there's others where the
[1:47:40.660 --> 1:47:45.380]  lead uses a pigment or it's used at the lower concentrations and but the point
[1:47:45.380 --> 1:47:48.780]  is I you know I think the common sense position in the position of most
[1:47:48.780 --> 1:47:52.780]  parents out there is we don't want to lead in the toys so the fact that our
[1:47:52.780 --> 1:47:58.500]  legislation or policy doesn't reflect that reality is a problem and you know
[1:47:58.500 --> 1:48:03.980]  ultimately you know consumer interest in and people demanding not safe and
[1:48:03.980 --> 1:48:07.220]  healthy product is going to change that well it's still horrible in China and as
[1:48:07.220 --> 1:48:10.300]  you know they just had hundreds die and tens of thousands was it fifty-something
[1:48:10.300 --> 1:48:14.220]  thousand just over the melamine they say it's bad they arrest the people that
[1:48:14.220 --> 1:48:19.500]  did it and execute them not in the u.s. they just say hey melamine's good so I
[1:48:19.500 --> 1:48:23.100]  mean you know how about some I mean that I mean that is murder to knowingly put
[1:48:23.100 --> 1:48:27.180]  melamine in there then and then and they prove these guys knowingly put it in
[1:48:27.180 --> 1:48:34.300]  there to fool the protein testers so I mean let's execute some people well I
[1:48:34.300 --> 1:48:37.940]  wouldn't offer that but what I would I would say you know taking it back to
[1:48:37.940 --> 1:48:41.980]  toys I mean thousands of dead kids I mean we shouldn't execute them yeah I
[1:48:41.980 --> 1:48:47.220]  mean taking it back to toys as you know we you know we test over 1500 toys we
[1:48:47.220 --> 1:48:52.540]  we found 17 products we tested they were manufactured in the u.s. and there's more
[1:48:52.540 --> 1:48:56.220]  than that but that that kind of shows you the percentage of products that we are
[1:48:56.220 --> 1:49:01.220]  actually making in this country which is a big issue let me be clear sir I'm not
[1:49:01.220 --> 1:49:04.420]  saying if somebody has a little bit of lead or arsenic or something and it was
[1:49:04.420 --> 1:49:07.900]  it you know in the manufacturing and an accident or you know maybe you know then
[1:49:07.900 --> 1:49:12.620]  some jail time but if you knowingly like in China put melamine in the milk
[1:49:12.620 --> 1:49:15.460]  knowing it's going to kill a bunch of people these people I mean this is out
[1:49:15.460 --> 1:49:18.220]  of control I mean I really think you should do some hard prison time take
[1:49:18.220 --> 1:49:21.500]  like Bayer I'm sure you heard about that case knowingly shipping out over a
[1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:25.860]  million dosages of factor 8 filled with HIV and hepatitis killing hundreds of
[1:49:25.860 --> 1:49:29.500]  thousands and it came out in court in France that they knew it had it and knew
[1:49:29.500 --> 1:49:34.580]  it was going to kill people shouldn't they get in trouble well yeah and with
[1:49:34.580 --> 1:49:38.420]  chemicals and products looking specifically at some of the products
[1:49:38.420 --> 1:49:42.260]  we've tested I mean we really think it we got to go back to the chemical
[1:49:42.260 --> 1:49:47.000]  manufacturers and the fact that some of these chemicals is still legally be put
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:53.380]  in products and again it gets back to you know fundamentally we don't deal with
[1:49:53.380 --> 1:49:56.420]  these chemicals we don't regulate them in a way that assures that they're going
[1:49:56.420 --> 1:49:59.780]  to be safe for children so they're going to end up in products and then tell
[1:49:59.780 --> 1:50:05.380]  you know consumers demanding that part of it but going back and actually having
[1:50:05.380 --> 1:50:10.100]  you know demanding the chemical manufacturers show that the chemical
[1:50:10.100 --> 1:50:13.220]  they produce is going to be safe for children is ultimately what we got to
[1:50:13.220 --> 1:50:19.820]  do and that's going to require you know a revolution really and how we
[1:50:19.820 --> 1:50:25.860]  regulate these things and and then putting the onus of that back on to the
[1:50:25.860 --> 1:50:30.180]  chemical manufacturers to actually show safety so part of this isn't isn't
[1:50:30.180 --> 1:50:33.180]  necessarily we're building a bigger government apparatus to deal with this
[1:50:33.180 --> 1:50:40.140]  part of it is we have three reasserting who has responsibility here and I
[1:50:40.140 --> 1:50:44.140]  understand it's not even against the government apparatus our government is
[1:50:44.140 --> 1:50:48.420]  so corrupt that Monsanto goes in and gives them campaign contributions and
[1:50:48.420 --> 1:50:52.740]  then they'll get approval for a corn that sterilizes the rats that eat it I
[1:50:52.740 --> 1:50:57.540]  mean this is this is sheer lunacy right so I mean I'm saying the government
[1:50:57.540 --> 1:51:01.180]  look I've always speaking of the death penalty I've always been for the death
[1:51:01.180 --> 1:51:06.620]  penalty sir but now I'm against it because you can't trust the government
[1:51:06.620 --> 1:51:10.220]  that's put over a third of the people on death row now proven to be innocent the
[1:51:10.220 --> 1:51:16.220]  government so corrupt they can't administer it yeah yeah so I think that's
[1:51:16.220 --> 1:51:20.340]  that's an issue and I ultimately you know we think that the manufacturers should
[1:51:20.340 --> 1:51:23.780]  be responsible for this stuff and a chemical producer should be responsible
[1:51:23.780 --> 1:51:29.780]  similar and well that but also for assuring the safety of the chemical
[1:51:29.780 --> 1:51:35.180]  they produce and and right now you know the way a regulatory structure set up
[1:51:35.180 --> 1:51:39.660]  that just simply isn't the case so that's why we've been you know we've had a
[1:51:39.660 --> 1:51:43.580]  bill for the kids safe chemical act which is we're hoping to what will try to
[1:51:43.580 --> 1:51:48.180]  stay there let's do a final segment if you can and talk about that act and talk
[1:51:48.180 --> 1:51:52.620]  more about healthy toys dot org and you got the healthy cars dot org and the
[1:51:52.620 --> 1:51:58.060]  umbrella group ecology center doing a great job because you know our whole
[1:51:58.060 --> 1:52:00.340]  environment's becoming toxic we've got to do something about it this is the
[1:52:00.340 --> 1:52:03.980]  real environmental threat not all the phony ones that are really just taxes in
[1:52:03.980 --> 1:52:08.340]  disguise stay there I want to hear more about this certainly goodbye the
[1:52:08.340 --> 1:52:12.380]  holiday season is here again a time to appreciate our friends and family and the
[1:52:12.380 --> 1:52:16.100]  many blessings we have it's also time to find unique gift ideas for those we
[1:52:16.100 --> 1:52:20.420]  love this year why not give a gift that saves your loved ones money a two ounce
[1:52:20.420 --> 1:52:24.260]  bottle of fuel conditioner from fuel saver technologies makes a great stocking
[1:52:24.260 --> 1:52:27.980]  stuffer it's also an inexpensive and thoughtful present a small squeeze of
[1:52:27.980 --> 1:52:31.900]  our product in the gas tank improves combustion boosting fuel economy 10 to

[1:55:18.620 --> 1:55:24.020]  our society and it's happening because the people have been lazy I know a lot
[1:55:24.020 --> 1:55:28.660]  of you got little girls wearing that cheap jewelry almost all of it's got lead
[1:55:28.660 --> 1:55:39.140]  in it why because lead is cheaper than pewter nickel plated lead and it only
[1:55:39.140 --> 1:55:44.780]  starts there so don't be lazy the safest thing to do is just to not buy any
[1:55:44.780 --> 1:55:50.580]  of the plastic highly manufactured metal slave toys because you know there's
[1:55:50.580 --> 1:55:53.340]  tens of thousands of toys out there nobody can test them all they've tested
[1:55:53.340 --> 1:55:58.460]  over 1500 and found a third of them very toxic and there's other groups testing
[1:55:58.460 --> 1:56:02.500]  other groups of toys and they're finding the same thing the foods got it it's
[1:56:02.500 --> 1:56:07.100]  bad it's bad folks and only getting upset and saying no and getting informed
[1:56:07.100 --> 1:56:11.340]  is going to stop at the minute so we've got left with the research director of
[1:56:11.340 --> 1:56:17.780]  healthytoys.org Jeff Gerhardt fire folks up I mean tell us about this bill tell
[1:56:17.780 --> 1:56:21.620]  us where all this is going what we can do and we have had some victories thanks
[1:56:21.620 --> 1:56:25.860]  to some people taking action it could be a lot better yeah I would just
[1:56:25.860 --> 1:56:33.620]  emphasize that I think this is a nice case study of if you care about stuff
[1:56:33.620 --> 1:56:37.340]  and if you're active on it we can change things I think as I mentioned
[1:56:37.340 --> 1:56:42.900]  earlier we are seeing we saw half as many toys in our snapshot sample this
[1:56:42.900 --> 1:56:46.860]  year that had levels of lead over 600 parts per million which is the legal
[1:56:46.860 --> 1:56:53.940]  standard and you know that didn't happen because of government regulation and
[1:56:53.940 --> 1:56:58.420]  didn't happen because of any other reason than the fact that people were
[1:56:58.420 --> 1:57:02.540]  showing up at retailers and they were they were asking questions and they
[1:57:02.540 --> 1:57:07.340]  were looking for products that were that were healthier so again I can only I
[1:57:07.340 --> 1:57:11.340]  think it's a great case study of that you can make a difference and we can
[1:57:11.340 --> 1:57:16.180]  improve things but but we got to be vigilant and people got to arm themselves
[1:57:16.180 --> 1:57:20.900]  of information and it's not something that's just going to happen without
[1:57:20.900 --> 1:57:25.060]  people being being fired up about it so you can go to our website we have a
[1:57:25.060 --> 1:57:28.060]  kind of a snapshot of some of the products there you can take a look and
[1:57:28.060 --> 1:57:33.460]  use that to give you to give you some guidance but but ultimately you know
[1:57:33.460 --> 1:57:38.980]  almost anywhere you are in the US in many states there's there's folks
[1:57:38.980 --> 1:57:44.460]  actively working on these issues many states you know from from California to
[1:57:44.460 --> 1:57:50.180]  Maine I'm in Michigan there's there's been efforts to address this on a state
[1:57:50.180 --> 1:57:56.220]  level you know we you know ultimately if we think you we need a federal solution
[1:57:56.220 --> 1:58:02.660]  to try to try to rein this all in going back those the government says 600
[1:58:02.660 --> 1:58:08.220]  parts per million that is off the charts well again it's another case where we
[1:58:08.220 --> 1:58:11.820]  don't agree with that and and the fact that we have the government standing by
[1:58:11.820 --> 1:58:18.260]  and saying any amount of lead in a toy is okay is kind of problem 101 and to get
[1:58:18.260 --> 1:58:23.420]  beyond that again we we our question is well why are we still manufacturing lead
[1:58:23.420 --> 1:58:27.740]  based pigments that are ending up in toys and no one's really been able to
[1:58:27.740 --> 1:58:31.620]  answer that question you know the answer is because our you know it's still legal
[1:58:31.620 --> 1:58:35.540]  and we don't have a regulatory structure to review these chemicals that have been
[1:58:35.540 --> 1:58:41.160]  on the market for decades and of course the study and grandfathered in by by
[1:58:41.160 --> 1:58:46.140]  old laws that don't require new review of them and as a result they still end up
[1:58:46.140 --> 1:58:49.420]  in toys and they end up in other products in the economy there's a reason you
[1:58:49.420 --> 1:58:52.780]  know there's been a lot of focus recently on artificial turf the same
[1:58:52.780 --> 1:58:59.780]  issue lead pigments they go in to make the turf green and and there's you know
[1:58:59.780 --> 1:59:03.260]  there's a lot of legislative activity and legal activity in California looking
[1:59:03.260 --> 1:59:08.380]  at model lead released from artificial turf on some of these athletic fields
[1:59:08.380 --> 1:59:13.620]  as well as some of the fake turf you might buy for your home these chemicals
[1:59:13.620 --> 1:59:18.300]  until we actually make the chemicals not legally use the products they're
[1:59:18.300 --> 1:59:22.540]  going to continue to pop up in the product well absolutely especially with
[1:59:22.540 --> 1:59:26.820]  children when all the studies show that toxins and poisons have a more adverse
[1:59:26.820 --> 1:59:30.700]  effect pound-for-pound on children that on any other group is their fast growing
[1:59:30.700 --> 1:59:35.260]  and their cells are in that state where they're more easily influenced so the
[1:59:35.260 --> 1:59:38.500]  work you're doing is fabulous chef Gerhardt thank you so much for joining
[1:59:38.500 --> 1:59:42.580]  us from healthy toys org and will we'll talk to you again in the future okay

[2:00:02.660 --> 2:00:08.140]  September 11th but who is the enemy bin Laden this is his ammo we have to look
[2:00:08.140 --> 2:00:11.740]  to the Middle East we have to look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the
[2:00:11.740 --> 2:00:15.580]  first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:00:15.580 --> 2:00:19.780]  networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there are
[2:00:19.780 --> 2:00:25.500]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that
[2:00:25.500 --> 2:00:30.500]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA the
[2:00:30.500 --> 2:00:34.380]  hijackers ties to the FBI the Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli
[2:00:34.380 --> 2:00:37.940]  intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow government and much
[2:00:37.940 --> 2:00:43.500]  much more. Fabled Enemies get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high
[2:00:43.500 --> 2:00:47.260]  quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv

[2:01:08.060 --> 2:01:15.900]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:01:15.900 --> 2:01:23.420]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:01:23.420 --> 2:01:26.980]  Alex Jones
[2:01:33.420 --> 2:01:37.460]  Mike Adams the health ranger is going to be with us for the next hour and 52
[2:01:37.460 --> 2:01:42.700]  minutes we're going to open the phones up in the interview as well I want to go
[2:01:42.700 --> 2:01:46.580]  through GMO foods I want to go through toxins in the food toxins in the
[2:01:46.580 --> 2:01:52.060]  environment I want to go through the whole eugenics operation what we face
[2:01:52.060 --> 2:01:56.180]  as a society because we may not right now be able to stop the private foreign
[2:01:56.180 --> 2:02:01.940]  bankers from stealing 8.5 trillion in seven weeks and counting that was a
[2:02:01.940 --> 2:02:05.220]  week ago Lord knows what it's going to be next time we learn probably well it's
[2:02:05.220 --> 2:02:10.740]  over a trillion every week so it'll be nine something growing we may not be
[2:02:10.740 --> 2:02:14.700]  able to stop that but we can stop buying Chinese slave toys and other toys that
[2:02:14.700 --> 2:02:20.580]  have led and mercury and arsenic all over them we can stop giving the babies
[2:02:20.580 --> 2:02:27.020]  formula that's 90% of it filled with melamine deadly killing them we can
[2:02:27.020 --> 2:02:33.140]  stop giving them inoculations we can try to eat more organic food we can learn
[2:02:33.140 --> 2:02:37.180]  about it we can and then but we got to do this now because they're getting ready
[2:02:37.180 --> 2:02:41.340]  to expand GMO into every major food crop not just the big eight they're getting
[2:02:41.340 --> 2:02:45.900]  ready to really get to a point where it'll be 10 times 20 times harder to
[2:02:45.900 --> 2:02:49.540]  turn this around right now we've got a good shot right now we're having some
[2:02:49.540 --> 2:02:56.540]  major victories on growth hormone in the in the milk and the rest of it we can
[2:02:56.540 --> 2:03:01.340]  win this thing and this is one of the fronts where we can really affect change
[2:03:01.340 --> 2:03:05.060]  by you taking personal control not drinking or eating anything with
[2:03:05.060 --> 2:03:11.580]  aspartame you know not letting yourself you know quote get depressed and let them
[2:03:11.580 --> 2:03:18.100]  put you on deadly prozac that's a fluorine all the studies show that
[2:03:18.100 --> 2:03:24.940]  religion helps better than prozac or st. John's ward or hiking every day or just
[2:03:24.940 --> 2:03:31.940]  getting wild going out dancing they are here to kill steal and destroy ladies and
[2:03:31.940 --> 2:03:36.380]  gentlemen and we have to say no to the new world or we have to get involved and
[2:03:36.380 --> 2:03:40.020]  we're going to do that and we're going to continue with this series of shows
[2:03:40.020 --> 2:03:43.820]  exposing what's really happening with the GMO the toxins the melamine the
[2:03:43.820 --> 2:03:47.100]  chemicals and the plastics all of it we'll do that with Mike Adams the health

[2:09:14.420 --> 2:09:21.900]  want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now
[2:09:21.900 --> 2:09:30.140]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones my Adams the health ranger wonderful
[2:09:30.140 --> 2:09:35.140]  health writer and researcher working with a team of scientists doctors
[2:09:35.140 --> 2:09:41.660]  chemists you name it testing the milk for melamine being blocked all over the
[2:09:41.660 --> 2:09:44.820]  place from being even able to test it that's the type of corruption we're
[2:09:44.820 --> 2:09:50.500]  dealing with he's gonna be with us here for the next hour and 52 minutes and he's
[2:09:50.500 --> 2:09:53.940]  got a whole family of websites he works with out of the gates tell the folks that
[2:09:53.940 --> 2:09:58.540]  don't know who you are a little bit about yourself my Adams and then about the
[2:09:58.540 --> 2:10:02.500]  websites and then let's let's recap the milk when you're gonna be getting those
[2:10:02.500 --> 2:10:07.300]  tests back or not even milk the formula that the chemical of the formula the
[2:10:07.300 --> 2:10:12.260]  babies are given something out of a mad scientist laboratory and then let's
[2:10:12.260 --> 2:10:17.860]  just run the gamut of what's really happening in the environment okay Alex
[2:10:17.860 --> 2:10:21.260]  thanks for having me on the show again today am I coming through loud and clear
[2:10:21.260 --> 2:10:25.340]  here you are coming through loud and clear okay great great looking up the
[2:10:25.340 --> 2:10:29.740]  good equipment for your show Alex so all right natural news is our main
[2:10:29.740 --> 2:10:34.580]  website I'm a consumer health advocate I used to be diseased I used to be on
[2:10:34.580 --> 2:10:38.340]  pharmaceuticals I used to eat junk food all of that and I made a
[2:10:38.340 --> 2:10:43.180]  transformation about eight years ago now and have stayed in excellent health
[2:10:43.180 --> 2:10:48.420]  ever since and started to expose all of the fraud and lies and disinformation
[2:10:48.420 --> 2:10:51.980]  put out there about foods and pharmaceuticals we got a lot to talk
[2:10:51.980 --> 2:10:55.620]  about today and I'll give you an update on the melamine testing situation as
[2:10:55.620 --> 2:11:00.420]  well we've been I guess blackballed Alex that the lab that we found last week
[2:11:00.420 --> 2:11:04.780]  when we talked to you the one lab that said they would test for us now refuses
[2:11:04.780 --> 2:11:11.100]  to do it we cannot find a lab to test products for melamine period and that's
[2:11:11.100 --> 2:11:17.060]  because the FDA said a month ago it is no longer bad for you yeah now we've got
[2:11:17.060 --> 2:11:22.740]  the the World Health Organization that has put out its own safe level of
[2:11:22.740 --> 2:11:27.860]  consumption guidelines where they're saying now that it's safe to eat point
[2:11:27.860 --> 2:11:33.380]  two milligrams per kilogram of body weight so for example roughly speaking if
[2:11:33.380 --> 2:11:39.700]  you weigh 200 pounds they're saying it's safe to eat up to 20 milligrams but
[2:11:39.700 --> 2:11:45.820]  the old study said that the amount of two grains of salt would hurt you
[2:11:45.820 --> 2:11:50.140]  really bad now they're saying I guess you can eat buckets of it yeah I know it's
[2:11:50.140 --> 2:11:54.300]  it's insane now they're saying you can just eat it almost in in quantities like
[2:11:54.300 --> 2:11:58.740]  it's a vitamin supplement and they're saying you can eat it every single day
[2:11:58.740 --> 2:12:05.260]  oh yes is it's there's now what are they gonna do when it's like China and 60
[2:12:05.260 --> 2:12:09.340]  thousand are in the hospital and thousands are dying or dead I'm I guess
[2:12:09.340 --> 2:12:14.860]  just say that death is good too but this is a sister to either they'll they'll
[2:12:14.860 --> 2:12:18.820]  ignore it Alex just like they ignore all the all the young teenage girls who
[2:12:18.820 --> 2:12:23.620]  die after receiving the HPV vaccine injections you know girls are falling
[2:12:23.620 --> 2:12:27.580]  over dead within 24 hours after receiving those shots but the AMA says
[2:12:27.580 --> 2:12:31.660]  that it doesn't cause death so that's not why they died exactly they will
[2:12:31.660 --> 2:12:35.940]  officially deny it and that's when you know it's true that's the way it works
[2:12:35.940 --> 2:12:41.420]  so so so the new system of corruption is just to say mercury's good melamine's
[2:12:41.420 --> 2:12:45.620]  good the toxins in plastic are good though they could you know have safe
[2:12:45.620 --> 2:12:49.820]  plastics and overnight for hardly even more cost it just doesn't matter Mike
[2:12:49.820 --> 2:12:52.660]  because they're just gonna say it's all I mean you've heard me play the clip or
[2:12:52.660 --> 2:12:57.340]  they say mercury's good for you now oh yeah I you come up with the best audio
[2:12:57.340 --> 2:13:01.380]  clips by the way yeah it must have a great research staff to find those but not
[2:13:01.380 --> 2:13:04.380]  just find them on YouTube and see them on the local news but I've played out a
[2:13:04.380 --> 2:13:07.540]  million times because new listeners don't believe me when I say something like
[2:13:07.540 --> 2:13:12.900]  that I know I know people really have a hard time believing that this is true
[2:13:12.900 --> 2:13:17.700]  they think well the FDA and the WHO and the AMA that they're all looking out for
[2:13:17.700 --> 2:13:23.460]  consumers we're here to protect you they say but in reality they're there in my
[2:13:23.460 --> 2:13:27.020]  opinion to promote the interests of the big chemical companies and the
[2:13:27.020 --> 2:13:32.460]  pharmaceutical companies and the food companies I mean the USDA was fighting to
[2:13:32.460 --> 2:13:38.860]  remove sodium nitrite from processed meat in the 1970s that's a cancer causing
[2:13:38.860 --> 2:13:43.220]  chemical causes pancreatic cancer boosts the the risks of leukemia and colon
[2:13:43.220 --> 2:13:46.980]  cancer it's still in the meat it's been there since the 1970s and the person who
[2:13:46.980 --> 2:13:52.180]  fought it at the USDA was eventually kicked out of power and they work that
[2:13:52.180 --> 2:13:57.260]  way ever since the food companies and the drug companies on this federal
[2:13:57.260 --> 2:14:02.780]  government they run it and they determine what's safe and what's not safe get
[2:14:02.780 --> 2:14:08.060]  into more detail on not being able to find a company to test melamine all
[2:14:08.060 --> 2:14:12.100]  right well we can find companies that all tested at levels above one part per
[2:14:12.100 --> 2:14:16.180]  million that's easy but when we went out and asked to find labs that would test
[2:14:16.180 --> 2:14:20.700]  it at levels below one part per million which is of course what the FDA is doing
[2:14:20.700 --> 2:14:26.380]  there they're finding levels of 247 parts per billion of melamine in infant
[2:14:26.380 --> 2:14:30.940]  formula that's what came out about 10 days ago when we try to get that level
[2:14:30.940 --> 2:14:35.660]  tested the answer was no and we talked to 10 different labs one lab told us they
[2:14:35.660 --> 2:14:39.940]  would do it and then when we went to send them the products they said no we
[2:14:39.940 --> 2:14:44.620]  won't do it anymore and so we now you know what we're doing now Alex we're
[2:14:44.620 --> 2:14:50.100]  trying to find labs outside the country that will test American foods because the
[2:14:50.100 --> 2:14:55.860]  US laboratories won't do it well actually the Patriot Act has a bunch of
[2:14:55.860 --> 2:15:01.020]  language about not being able to test water or chemical plants because that's
[2:15:01.020 --> 2:15:05.580]  national security and then that if you're testing then brings liability on a
[2:15:05.580 --> 2:15:11.580]  company that hurts America so maybe you're all kind of Mike yeah that's
[2:15:11.580 --> 2:15:15.900]  right for for conducting scientific testing to see what poisons are in the
[2:15:15.900 --> 2:15:19.260]  food you know if they label me a terrorist for doing that then it's
[2:15:19.260 --> 2:15:23.940]  pretty obvious pretty obvious how crazy things have become I mean where is the
[2:15:23.940 --> 2:15:28.140]  FDA when it comes to trying to protect the people where's the mainstream media
[2:15:28.140 --> 2:15:33.620]  on this how come USA today or Washington Post or New York Times isn't doing this
[2:15:33.620 --> 2:15:37.540]  you know why does it come to an independent website like mine to do
[2:15:37.540 --> 2:15:40.540]  this and we don't have the clout of those companies you know we don't have a
[2:15:40.540 --> 2:15:45.180]  staff of those companies and yet we seem to be the only ones trying to do this
[2:15:45.180 --> 2:15:49.340]  and we're being stonewalled so the American people are being kept in the
[2:15:49.340 --> 2:15:54.180]  dark on purpose Mike it's because you and I and then a natural news all of us
[2:15:54.180 --> 2:15:59.540]  are insane if we were normal we would produce John pull up the CBS piece about
[2:15:59.540 --> 2:16:05.900]  mercury being good or I just played a CNBC piece where they said poison and
[2:16:05.900 --> 2:16:11.100]  toys lead and toys is good I mean maybe we should just become normal like them
[2:16:11.100 --> 2:16:15.420]  and decide that suddenly everything that was known to be deadly poison is now
[2:16:15.420 --> 2:16:19.300]  good for us and eat it and die and go in the ground and watch all the kids
[2:16:19.300 --> 2:16:24.140]  around us dying of cancer and you know to drink growth hormone and milk and have
[2:16:24.140 --> 2:16:28.220]  eight foot tall children who die of acromeglia I mean what's wrong with this
[2:16:28.220 --> 2:16:34.860]  I mean we are insane mercury is good the news said so here it is mercury
[2:16:34.860 --> 2:16:38.940]  containing vaccines may have on kids a life-saving device wins over the
[2:16:38.940 --> 2:16:43.460]  counter approval by the FDA and sick of your glasses and contact lenses and you
[2:16:43.460 --> 2:16:47.740]  corrective eye surgery is approved today is tonight's medical headlines with
[2:16:47.740 --> 2:16:54.420]  medical watcher Porter see the map mercury containing vaccines may help not
[2:16:54.420 --> 2:16:58.820]  harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics there have been
[2:16:58.820 --> 2:17:02.940]  lots by concerns at mercury based preservatives and vaccines might impair
[2:17:02.940 --> 2:17:07.020]  the neurological development of children these new studies suggest that the
[2:17:07.020 --> 2:17:10.460]  opposite that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved
[2:17:10.460 --> 2:17:15.380]  behavior and mental performance so melamine's killing all these people
[2:17:15.380 --> 2:17:20.140]  but it's good for you and so is mercury so this is clearly the new tactic Mike is
[2:17:20.140 --> 2:17:24.740]  just to say up is down and down is up black as white white as black oh it's
[2:17:24.740 --> 2:17:29.980]  incredible I'm laughing my head off over here that that the system of medicine or
[2:17:29.980 --> 2:17:34.300]  even that the mainstream media could be involved with this idea that mercury a
[2:17:34.300 --> 2:17:39.740]  heavy metal that's strongly correlated with neurological disorders and harm
[2:17:39.740 --> 2:17:44.340]  could be enhancing the health of children it's it's just outrageous it's
[2:17:44.340 --> 2:17:48.180]  insane and you're right up is down but one of your comments earlier touched on
[2:17:48.180 --> 2:17:52.780]  an issue that I think is worth mentioning which is that even though the FDA
[2:17:52.780 --> 2:17:59.020]  says okay a little melamine is safe a little lead is okay a little mercury in
[2:17:59.020 --> 2:18:02.660]  the vaccine no problem they they say all of these things are safe independently
[2:18:02.660 --> 2:18:07.900]  it's not just a problem it's good it's good but oh yeah that that's right it's
[2:18:07.900 --> 2:18:11.260]  like nutrition now like they're saying that psychiatric drugs should now be
[2:18:11.260 --> 2:18:15.660]  prescribed for healthy people who have no disease and statins for her for
[2:18:15.660 --> 2:18:19.660]  children and healthy people in the water supply that matter with causing all
[2:18:19.660 --> 2:18:24.820]  this liver and kidney failure she's exactly along with mm-hmm I'm sorry on
[2:18:24.820 --> 2:18:27.780]  top of the fluoride that's already in the water which of course you talk about a
[2:18:27.780 --> 2:18:31.300]  lot on top of the chlorine that's in the water the point is that there are
[2:18:31.300 --> 2:18:36.700]  combinations now chemical cocktails and no one's ever done any testing on on
[2:18:36.700 --> 2:18:42.140]  what happens when a child or even an adult consumes this chemical cocktail
[2:18:42.140 --> 2:18:45.780]  you've got the acrylamides and the bisphenol a and the baby bottles and the
[2:18:45.780 --> 2:18:51.500]  perchlorate the rocket chemical rocket fuel chemical that's now found in most
[2:18:51.500 --> 2:18:54.860]  of the milk that's sold in this country it's even found in human breast milk
[2:18:54.860 --> 2:18:58.660]  because the mothers are contaminated because of what they consume what
[2:18:58.660 --> 2:19:03.140]  happens when our babies consume these chemical cocktails no one can tell you
[2:19:03.140 --> 2:19:07.620]  because they don't know Alex they don't know which means that we the American
[2:19:07.620 --> 2:19:13.420]  people we are getting pigs in a mass experiment we are we're being used for
[2:19:13.420 --> 2:19:18.300]  experiments and we don't know what the results are going to be well in many
[2:19:18.300 --> 2:19:21.540]  cases we know what led we know what mercury we know what arsenic does we
[2:19:21.540 --> 2:19:27.180]  know it's killing people yeah yeah we know we know that probably Alzheimer's
[2:19:27.180 --> 2:19:33.020]  is going to be a huge problem in the next 20 years well they say now you know
[2:19:33.020 --> 2:19:38.460]  that a young is the new old you get Alzheimer's now at 25 yeah yeah they're
[2:19:38.460 --> 2:19:43.460]  diagnosing cardiovascular heart disease in teenagers now and you're right
[2:19:43.460 --> 2:19:46.940]  they're getting neurological disorders at very young ages many in in the 30s
[2:19:46.940 --> 2:19:50.420]  which it used to be a disease that you would get in your 60s well what's
[2:19:50.420 --> 2:19:55.100]  causing this I think vaccines are very strongly linked to this and it's this
[2:19:55.100 --> 2:20:00.060]  it's this barrage of chemicals that do not belong in the human body and Alex
[2:20:00.060 --> 2:20:03.660]  they do not belong in the food supply why can't we say that a safety standard
[2:20:03.660 --> 2:20:09.900]  should be no industrial chemicals in the food no lead in the toys none of these
[2:20:09.900 --> 2:20:13.380]  chemicals in the food you know why can't we like to change it to the food
[2:20:13.380 --> 2:20:17.420]  pyramid at the top you got mercury under that you got arsenic under that you've
[2:20:17.420 --> 2:20:23.380]  got to melamine and then under that you can have the plastic toxins and then
[2:20:23.380 --> 2:20:29.260]  you can have weed and then pesticide derivatives under that weed killers and
[2:20:29.260 --> 2:20:34.300]  fluoride I mean what's wrong with that the four basic food groups pesticides
[2:20:34.300 --> 2:20:38.980]  herbicides genetically refined food and toxic chemicals there you go the new
[2:20:38.980 --> 2:20:42.700]  pyramid I like that idea Alex let's print that we need to the new food
[2:20:42.700 --> 2:20:47.020]  pyramid and at the bottom a bunch of dead bodies skeletons rotting it's
[2:20:47.020 --> 2:20:52.300]  wonderful so you heard it folks mercury now if you eat it'll you'll die I mean
[2:20:52.300 --> 2:20:55.860]  if you had a small capsule it would kill you but doesn't matter it's good
[2:20:55.860 --> 2:21:00.900]  dying is good and again I'm not going to be insane anymore I agree with the
[2:21:00.900 --> 2:21:06.660]  media mercury and melamine are good did you know that it's a documented fact
[2:21:06.660 --> 2:21:11.780]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal

[2:23:09.100 --> 2:23:14.540]  war against this country the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the

[2:25:33.020 --> 2:25:53.180]  okay my Adams I've thrown in all my points here early on let's run the
[2:25:53.180 --> 2:25:58.380]  gamut we know this isn't being done by accident we know it's by design now
[2:25:58.380 --> 2:26:01.380]  there are a lot of companies and corporations that just don't care but
[2:26:01.380 --> 2:26:06.940]  they are allowed to by the international directives as Bertrand Russell and many
[2:26:06.940 --> 2:26:13.900]  others said diet injections diet and injunctions will be used to control and
[2:26:13.900 --> 2:26:17.940]  chemically dumb down the public and we find magically the GMO food in every
[2:26:17.940 --> 2:26:22.500]  category just so happens to sterilize mammals it just so happens to cause all
[2:26:22.500 --> 2:26:27.100]  these cancers we find out in every case oh the very plastic they chose of
[2:26:27.100 --> 2:26:31.740]  hundred different types for unified use all over the world was the one type that
[2:26:31.740 --> 2:26:36.460]  leached the chemical that sterilized the estrogen mimicking the endocrine
[2:26:36.460 --> 2:26:42.420]  disruptor oh it's just magically Prozac sterilizes people in the entire family
[2:26:42.420 --> 2:26:47.940]  of serotonin reuptake inhibitors oh it's just magically every time what they are
[2:26:47.940 --> 2:26:51.740]  allowing and what they are engineering in the limits they're setting towards
[2:26:51.740 --> 2:26:58.340]  literally added is dumbing us down to sterilizing us is brain damaging us so
[2:26:58.340 --> 2:27:03.180]  let's go through it all melamine fluoride GMO you got the floor okay well
[2:27:03.180 --> 2:27:07.780]  that there are a couple of ways to look at this Alex one way is the population
[2:27:07.780 --> 2:27:12.900]  control theory which you alluded to there and I think very with a lot of good
[2:27:12.900 --> 2:27:16.100]  insight I think we got to talk about that in more detail but let me talk about
[2:27:16.100 --> 2:27:20.460]  the other theory first which is the economic theory here in the United States
[2:27:20.460 --> 2:27:24.660]  you know we've got a government that's going bankrupt I mean it's already bad
[2:27:24.660 --> 2:27:28.980]  but it's running out of options to even cover that bankruptcy now I've
[2:27:28.980 --> 2:27:33.860]  mentioned this before and it's a it's a an economic fact that it is in the
[2:27:33.860 --> 2:27:37.740]  interests of the federal government that people don't live long enough to
[2:27:37.740 --> 2:27:43.220]  collect social security and to cost the money on Medicare now listeners can draw
[2:27:43.220 --> 2:27:46.860]  their own conclusions on whether that's an agenda whether that's happening
[2:27:46.860 --> 2:27:52.260]  intentionally or whether it's just coincidence but it's very clear that
[2:27:52.260 --> 2:27:56.460]  it's in the interests of the government to make sure that you die before you
[2:27:56.460 --> 2:28:00.540]  cost the government money all right so the so think about that it's actually in
[2:28:00.540 --> 2:28:05.860]  their interest that you die early and the private banks that see those tens of
[2:28:05.860 --> 2:28:09.540]  trillions of dollars in the government pensions and the private pensions is
[2:28:09.540 --> 2:28:14.580]  their money yes absolutely in other words as long as you are a tax-paying
[2:28:14.580 --> 2:28:20.180]  citizen then you create a net asset for the government and as long as you are on
[2:28:20.180 --> 2:28:24.500]  pharmaceuticals that haven't yet killed you then you're creating a revenue
[2:28:24.500 --> 2:28:28.500]  stream for the drug companies so let's say you're in your 30s or 40s or even
[2:28:28.500 --> 2:28:32.260]  50s you're taking pharmaceuticals you're paying money to the drug companies
[2:28:32.260 --> 2:28:37.500]  you're paying your taxes you are a wage slave that's making money for the system
[2:28:37.500 --> 2:28:41.760]  but the minute you stop working the minute you stop paying taxes and start
[2:28:41.760 --> 2:28:46.100]  drawing on that money you become a liability and we know it's on purpose
[2:28:46.100 --> 2:28:50.180]  because the governments are saying they want euthanasia quote right to die but
[2:28:50.180 --> 2:28:54.060]  where they kill you and the bioethics boards decide that it's better for
[2:28:54.060 --> 2:28:58.940]  society that you die so before you suck off the money that you actually had
[2:28:58.940 --> 2:29:03.100]  taken in taxes from you yeah I think we got to be really careful about this
[2:29:03.100 --> 2:29:07.860]  whole right to die issue because as we've seen well for example in the
[2:29:07.860 --> 2:29:14.460]  organ transplant industry we've seen this go from being a right to donate
[2:29:14.460 --> 2:29:19.180]  your organs into be something that's in the UK now called presumed consent where
[2:29:19.180 --> 2:29:23.940]  if you die in the UK and this is this is on the board right now it could become
[2:29:23.940 --> 2:29:29.020]  law very soon then you are presumed to give consent to have your organs
[2:29:29.020 --> 2:29:33.740]  harvested even if you never said so I'm not making this up listen my dad when I
[2:29:33.740 --> 2:29:37.540]  was 16 going to get my driver's license said shine that you're not an organ
[2:29:37.540 --> 2:29:40.300]  donor my dad's an oral surgeon in Dennis and he's worked in a lot of hospitals
[2:29:40.300 --> 2:29:44.300]  you know wiring jaws and things and I said why and he said some hospitals kill
[2:29:44.300 --> 2:29:47.940]  you some hospitals don't render aid because they get hundreds of thousands
[2:29:47.940 --> 2:29:51.500]  when you're an automobile accident they let you die even if you're not brain
[2:29:51.500 --> 2:29:56.420]  dead and then I kind of said oh my dad you know whatever dad and he hardly ever
[2:29:56.420 --> 2:29:58.740]  pushes things on me when I was growing up he didn't you know give me my
[2:29:58.740 --> 2:30:02.260]  political views and we're about to break we'll come back long seven and get more
[2:30:02.260 --> 2:30:05.620]  into it I didn't mean to interrupt and tell the story but it's so important and
[2:30:05.620 --> 2:30:09.620]  then I remember years later sitting at my grandparents house in Austin watching
[2:30:09.620 --> 2:30:12.700]  60 minutes with all these hospitals killing people for their organs and
[2:30:12.700 --> 2:30:16.180]  then hospitals nationwide are caught even if you say no you can't have the
[2:30:16.180 --> 2:30:20.340]  organs they'll slice you over and take them including your corneas oh yeah
[2:30:20.340 --> 2:30:24.300]  yeah they will because it makes money for them Alex they make a fortune off your
[2:30:24.300 --> 2:30:29.900]  organs and they're snatching people's babies all day in those hospitals
[2:30:29.900 --> 2:30:33.980]  under color of law getting a slice from the CPS so why not go ahead and steal
[2:30:33.980 --> 2:30:38.140]  some organs again the whole government the corporations they're criminals and
[2:30:38.140 --> 2:30:43.660]  the police state is about protecting them so they can carry it out Mike Adams

[2:34:13.900 --> 2:34:18.900]  I fell into a burning ring of fire. I went down the mountain.
[2:34:18.900 --> 2:34:22.900]  Guess what, ladies and gentlemen, I have built a new radio studio that's very TV friendly.
[2:34:22.900 --> 2:34:26.900]  Burns, Burns. Radio slash TV studio. The Ring of Fire.
[2:34:26.900 --> 2:34:30.900]  I'm doing a test today from 4 to 5 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[2:34:30.900 --> 2:34:34.900]  We're gonna have open phones on my local 1-800 number.
[2:34:34.900 --> 2:34:36.900]  The one I give out when I do the show myself.
[2:34:36.900 --> 2:34:37.900]  Ring of Fire.
[2:34:37.900 --> 2:34:42.900]  And I'm gonna be in studio. We're also building a separate TV studio just to do TV straight up.
[2:34:42.900 --> 2:34:46.900]  And that's going well in the next week or so. I'm so busy building the studio, doing the shows.
[2:34:46.900 --> 2:34:52.900]  I keep meaning to videotape, to film some of the new office, some of the studios,
[2:34:52.900 --> 2:34:57.900]  and kind of give everybody a tour who is interested in that and to see what we've been working on
[2:34:57.900 --> 2:35:01.900]  thanks to all of your support.
[2:35:01.900 --> 2:35:05.900]  We move pretty darn quick compared to most people that procrastinate forever.
[2:35:05.900 --> 2:35:10.900]  Since I announced six months ago, we were gonna do this, finding an office, moving into it,
[2:35:10.900 --> 2:35:13.900]  building everything on top of all our other duties.
[2:35:13.900 --> 2:35:18.900]  And it's been really exciting and it's gone really, really well and we've been good stewards.
[2:35:18.900 --> 2:35:24.900]  But don't forget your prisonplanet.tv memberships. That's what makes a lot of this possible.
[2:35:24.900 --> 2:35:30.900]  And so the only place to watch the TV show today that we're gonna develop it and get it on television itself.
[2:35:30.900 --> 2:35:35.900]  Is prisonplanet.tv and the infowars.com streams.
[2:35:35.900 --> 2:35:42.900]  The radio show, 11 to 4, every day in the fourth hour, we go live.
[2:35:42.900 --> 2:35:45.900]  We're not doing that today because I'm going live later.
[2:35:45.900 --> 2:35:50.900]  But we will continue on the radio to go live in the new studio, in the fourth hour, simulcasting.
[2:35:50.900 --> 2:35:53.900]  We'll probably start doing two hours a day. Some days we already do that.
[2:35:53.900 --> 2:35:59.900]  We're gonna have some special TV reports we do, though, within studio guest and guest over the phone.
[2:35:59.900 --> 2:36:05.900]  And even we're gonna do some video feeds. The web's gotten good enough to have studios guest in studio that way up on the big TV.
[2:36:05.900 --> 2:36:10.900]  So we're really working on doing a lot of new things for folks.
[2:36:10.900 --> 2:36:16.900]  I'm gonna start trying to do a five minute special news blitz where I really boil it down to five minutes every day.
[2:36:16.900 --> 2:36:23.900]  I mean, we're really trying to increase the amount of work we're doing because we know things are so serious and so much is going on and happening.
[2:36:23.900 --> 2:36:27.900]  Going back to the health ranger, Mike Adams.
[2:36:27.900 --> 2:36:33.900]  I mean, let's go through it, all of it, the fluoride, the mercury, the melamine, what we know it's doing.
[2:36:33.900 --> 2:36:37.900]  And we had talked about the agenda of getting rid of the old people.
[2:36:37.900 --> 2:36:42.900]  The useless eaters is Ted Turner and Prince Philip and Hitler and everybody else like to call us.
[2:36:42.900 --> 2:36:46.900]  But then there's the stated goal of killing 80% of us.
[2:36:46.900 --> 2:36:49.900]  And then the UN saying they'll use food as a weapon.
[2:36:49.900 --> 2:36:53.900]  And all of these eugenicists in control. So let's continue.
[2:36:53.900 --> 2:37:01.900]  Okay, well, I'm glad you mentioned some of those historical terms there because I think a historical perspective is really useful on this.
[2:37:01.900 --> 2:37:07.900]  Now, people are going to believe what I'm about to say here, but I'm going to give you a little bit of history of the pharmaceutical industry.
[2:37:07.900 --> 2:37:17.900]  We talked about Bayer. Bayer was a German pharmaceutical company and it was part of the breakup of IG Farben with the war crimes in Nazi Germany, World War II.
[2:37:17.900 --> 2:37:24.900]  And in fact, Bayer was linked to experimentation on Jewish prisoners at Auschwitz.
[2:37:24.900 --> 2:37:34.900]  And then in fact, later, I think it was in 1956, that a gentleman who was in fact convicted of war crimes against people.
[2:37:34.900 --> 2:37:40.900]  He served seven years in prison, a man named Fritz Termier. He became the chairman of Bayer.
[2:37:40.900 --> 2:37:48.900]  And several decades earlier, Bayer was selling, get this, Bayer heroin for kids.
[2:37:48.900 --> 2:37:53.900]  It was a cough syrup sold in the United States. Heroin for kids.
[2:37:53.900 --> 2:37:57.900]  And I guess if you drink enough heroin, you probably stop coughing.
[2:37:57.900 --> 2:38:01.900]  Yeah, that put all the old opium-ladenum producers out of business.
[2:38:01.900 --> 2:38:05.900]  And then they also lobbied to then make it illegal later so they can control the narcotics importation.
[2:38:05.900 --> 2:38:14.900]  That's a separate subject. And then of course, Bayer in 2002 gets convicted in French court worldwide with their own documents on purpose,
[2:38:14.900 --> 2:38:20.900]  shipping out age tainted HIV blood. And the documents said that they knowingly did it.
[2:38:20.900 --> 2:38:24.900]  The question is why? Because they like to kill people. Go ahead.
[2:38:24.900 --> 2:38:31.900]  Now, fast forward to last week, we had an article, no, in fact, I'm sorry, this was earlier this week,
[2:38:31.900 --> 2:38:35.900]  an article that was published in Nature, a medical journal, peer-reviewed medical journal.
[2:38:35.900 --> 2:38:41.900]  Seven doctors put together an article. Two of them admitted that they do have financial ties to drug companies.
[2:38:41.900 --> 2:38:48.900]  And they are now advocating the use of psychotropic drugs, these psychopic medicines,
[2:38:48.900 --> 2:38:52.900]  the same ones used to treat ADHD, these amphetamines.
[2:38:52.900 --> 2:38:57.900]  They're now advocating that those should be used by students and police officers and construction workers
[2:38:57.900 --> 2:39:04.900]  and anybody who wants these mind-altering chemicals, they should be readily prescribed to everybody now.
[2:39:04.900 --> 2:39:09.900]  They're drug dealers. But then meanwhile, they'll swat team your house if they think you've made it illegally,
[2:39:09.900 --> 2:39:16.900]  but they're going to push it in the schools under New Freedom Initiative, whose own board member five years ago leaked the documents
[2:39:16.900 --> 2:39:22.900]  that they intend to put half of America's children on amphetamines and psychotropics.
[2:39:22.900 --> 2:39:28.900]  The agenda can no longer be hidden now, Alex. It's so blatant. It's so obvious now.
[2:39:28.900 --> 2:39:33.900]  They are literally trying to turn America into a nation of drug addicts.
[2:39:33.900 --> 2:39:40.900]  They're pushing every drug they can think of, statins a few weeks ago, now these psychiatric drugs.
[2:39:40.900 --> 2:39:47.900]  And of course, at the same time, they want all the very same chemicals to be outlawed if they're not made by the drug company.
[2:39:47.900 --> 2:39:54.900]  And remember, THX1138 was based on Huxley's book and Huxley on record. His brother was a topogenesis, so was he.
[2:39:54.900 --> 2:40:03.900]  Stated, no, this is what we plan. Shaved heads, white uniforms, forced drug, hologram TVs, brainwashing us,
[2:40:03.900 --> 2:40:11.900]  and police suppressing the public with a technocratic elite who are not on drugs, ruling the subways.
[2:40:11.900 --> 2:40:15.900]  Yeah, and here's where it's going, Alex. Eventually, they're going to end up...
[2:40:15.900 --> 2:40:23.900]  If we don't turn this around, they're going to end up mandating psychiatric medications for anybody who does not agree with the mainstream.
[2:40:23.900 --> 2:40:25.900]  That means you and I, Alex, we're going to...
[2:40:25.900 --> 2:40:30.900]  Hello, and I keep finishing your sentences because I'm only proving to everybody that this is we're only going off documents.
[2:40:30.900 --> 2:40:36.900]  I tell you about the same info. You know they've created more than 100 new psychological designations for people that don't like government,
[2:40:36.900 --> 2:40:42.900]  who believe there's a new world order, who believe they're losing their freedoms, so they're already doing that.
[2:40:42.900 --> 2:40:51.900]  Oh yeah, I've got a list right here of symptoms, behavioral symptoms that are now caused for being diagnosed with what are called
[2:40:51.900 --> 2:40:54.900]  oppositional behavioral disorders. That's what you're referring to.
[2:40:54.900 --> 2:40:59.900]  Yeah, I've had newspapers write about me saying, I have this. You know, I read the Times of London saying,
[2:40:59.900 --> 2:41:05.900]  we're setting up world government, we're taking your liberties, and they go, he's insane. He didn't read that in the paper.
[2:41:05.900 --> 2:41:11.900]  Well, here's the official description. If you may have oppositional behavioral disorder, if you quote,
[2:41:11.900 --> 2:41:19.900]  if you have oppositional and disrespectful toward authority, or if you are argumentative, if you defy rules.
[2:41:19.900 --> 2:41:21.900]  And then you can't own a gun, but sorry, go ahead.
[2:41:21.900 --> 2:41:28.900]  No, but you see where this is going? This is ridiculous. In other words, if you don't conform, if you don't shut up and do what you're told,
[2:41:28.900 --> 2:41:35.900]  that pay your taxes and eat your melamine-contaminated food and take your drugs, then you're sick and you're diseased.
[2:41:35.900 --> 2:41:38.900]  If you don't like the medicaree, you're sick.
[2:41:38.900 --> 2:41:47.900]  It's like, if you don't line up and get your vaccines, you must have a mental disorder, and they're going to mandate the medication of people who do that.
[2:41:47.900 --> 2:41:53.900]  So that's just a little bit of background of how insane this whole system has been.
[2:41:53.900 --> 2:42:01.900]  Anybody who thinks that, gee, maybe Mother Nature had the best medicine, that maybe the human body can heal itself if given the proper nutrition,
[2:42:01.900 --> 2:42:04.900]  maybe there are cures for cancer that already exist.
[2:42:04.900 --> 2:42:08.900]  They just need melamine. They just need melamine.
[2:42:08.900 --> 2:42:17.900]  Take your melamine pills. I've got a cartoon on the website right now. It's about a new infant formula product called Melamine Plus.
[2:42:17.900 --> 2:42:18.900]  Oh, tell me about it.
[2:42:18.900 --> 2:42:22.900]  Well, you can see it on the natural news, the right-hand column.
[2:42:22.900 --> 2:42:30.900]  Melamine Plus formula. FDA approved fortified with extra melamine made in the USA using chemicals from China.
[2:42:30.900 --> 2:42:32.900]  There you go. That's just what infants need.
[2:42:32.900 --> 2:42:38.900]  But look how it's all on our face. They call us human resources. It's called formula.
[2:42:38.900 --> 2:42:41.900]  See, they let us know right on our face.
[2:42:41.900 --> 2:42:48.900]  Yeah, and the whole history of infant formula was, of course, rife with these companies telling them they're not pregnant.
[2:42:48.900 --> 2:42:54.900]  Yeah, let's go over that. All the kids that have died. I mean, just lately, tell folks about it.
[2:42:54.900 --> 2:42:57.900]  Well, okay. Just on melamine, or are you talking about chemicals in general?
[2:42:57.900 --> 2:43:04.900]  Well, I mean, every few months, I hear about tens of thousands in Africa die when the protein wasn't added to the formula,
[2:43:04.900 --> 2:43:08.900]  or hundreds die in China, 50,000 in China.
[2:43:08.900 --> 2:43:13.900]  Yeah, I mean, just formula alone, it's been quite a – well, I mean, the brain size is smaller, all the studies show.
[2:43:13.900 --> 2:43:15.900]  But that's lovely to give that gift to your child.
[2:43:15.900 --> 2:43:20.900]  Oh, you won't have the fats you need from a mammal. You'll have a shriveled brain,
[2:43:20.900 --> 2:43:24.900]  and most of the public have shriveled brains, and that's why they can't even understand us right now.
[2:43:24.900 --> 2:43:30.900]  Yeah, it's actually true. There is a decline in the intelligence quotient of the population,
[2:43:30.900 --> 2:43:35.900]  and it's very strongly related to the food supply, the lack of nutrients,
[2:43:35.900 --> 2:43:40.900]  the de-emphasis of breastfeeding, which every baby needs to be breastfed, period.
[2:43:40.900 --> 2:43:42.900]  It doesn't even matter if you're a human.
[2:43:42.900 --> 2:43:48.900]  That's a lie. That's a conspiracy. You're mentally ill. Women have never given milk to babies.
[2:43:48.900 --> 2:43:53.900]  That's a conspiracy. Mammals do not nurse their young. It's a lie.
[2:43:53.900 --> 2:43:57.900]  I'm sorry. I looked it up, Alex. I'm pretty sure that –
[2:43:57.900 --> 2:44:07.900]  No, no, you're mentally ill. Mercury is good. Women do not give milk. They give melamine.
[2:44:07.900 --> 2:44:14.900]  And as crazy as that sounds, that's what these doctors will say. Now, look, there was a survey just published today.
[2:44:14.900 --> 2:44:22.900]  This is breaking news. A survey of 32,000 American adults says that 38% of them are now using natural
[2:44:22.900 --> 2:44:25.900]  and alternative medicine. This was a government survey.
[2:44:25.900 --> 2:44:27.900]  They're al-Qaeda.
[2:44:27.900 --> 2:44:32.900]  In response to that, you know what all the doctors are saying now in the mainstream media today?
[2:44:32.900 --> 2:44:38.900]  They're saying beware. Natural medicine is risky and dangerous and unproven,
[2:44:38.900 --> 2:44:42.900]  and it's filled with magic potions that don't do what they say they do.
[2:44:42.900 --> 2:44:45.900]  And they use the few bad examples of scammers that are out there,
[2:44:45.900 --> 2:44:49.900]  but what happens in natural medicine and in natural remedies and herbs and things?
[2:44:49.900 --> 2:44:52.900]  People find out what's good. They find out what works.
[2:44:52.900 --> 2:44:55.900]  Oh, yeah. They can't suppress this truth any longer.
[2:44:55.900 --> 2:45:00.900]  Look, the drug companies are beginning to contract. They're laying people off right now.
[2:45:00.900 --> 2:45:05.900]  Mergers and acquisitions are going to kick in in 2009. Drug sales are down.
[2:45:05.900 --> 2:45:12.900]  That's because the American people are mentally ill. They don't know that melamine is good.
[2:45:12.900 --> 2:45:19.900]  And check this out. There was a drug rep fired, and she claims she was sexually assaulted
[2:45:19.900 --> 2:45:23.900]  because she would not promote a drug for off-label drug use.
[2:45:23.900 --> 2:45:27.900]  You know how these drug companies, they tell their reps to go out and promote these drugs for uses
[2:45:27.900 --> 2:45:31.900]  that they were never approved for? Well, this woman refused to do it.
[2:45:31.900 --> 2:45:34.900]  Her name's Carolyn Gleason. She refused to do that.
[2:45:34.900 --> 2:45:37.900]  She says she was fired and sexually assaulted because of it.
[2:45:37.900 --> 2:45:40.900]  It's a lawsuit right now against Roche.
[2:45:40.900 --> 2:45:44.900]  The pressure's up. They got to push these drugs for things they were never approved for.
[2:45:44.900 --> 2:45:48.900]  And some people are standing up and saying, no, I'm not going to do that.
[2:45:48.900 --> 2:45:50.900]  And those are far and few in between.
[2:45:50.900 --> 2:45:55.900]  Well, going back to this big magazine, big report about how we all need to be put on drugs,
[2:45:55.900 --> 2:45:59.900]  remember the Pentagon came out about seven years ago. It was called the Marshall Plan.
[2:45:59.900 --> 2:46:02.900]  That's their head of futurist. It was in Wired Magazine.
[2:46:02.900 --> 2:46:06.900]  He said, we're going to put all the troops on drugs and then mind control them.
[2:46:06.900 --> 2:46:09.900]  We're testing it in Afghanistan. It was right when that started.
[2:46:09.900 --> 2:46:14.900]  Instead, we send them in to go out for villages and then we give them a Halcyon amnesiac after.
[2:46:14.900 --> 2:46:20.900]  So, oh, you know, it's been a hard day. Here's a hardcore psychotropic drug and then turn them into drug addicts,
[2:46:20.900 --> 2:46:24.900]  just like the government sold heroin to the troops in Vietnam.
[2:46:24.900 --> 2:46:32.900]  Yeah. Long history of government drug pushing and government colluding with big pharma to push these drugs.
[2:46:32.900 --> 2:46:37.900]  But to get back to your original question, you know, the agenda here is clearly either,
[2:46:37.900 --> 2:46:45.900]  either to drug population beyond all mental capabilities so that they can't make the decisions,
[2:46:45.900 --> 2:46:53.900]  they can't assess information, or to control the population and just wipe out a lot of people
[2:46:53.900 --> 2:46:56.900]  or at least sterilize them so they can't have babies.
[2:46:56.900 --> 2:47:00.900]  You know, and again, listeners can choose what they want to choose.
[2:47:00.900 --> 2:47:05.900]  But the ability of people to discern fact from fiction is so distorted now.
[2:47:05.900 --> 2:47:09.900]  We even have a video on our website. It's a joke.
[2:47:09.900 --> 2:47:14.900]  It's about a new invention called the feed bag where you go to a fast food restaurant
[2:47:14.900 --> 2:47:20.900]  and you wear this feed bag that attaches to your head so you can eat your food without having to lift your arms.
[2:47:20.900 --> 2:47:26.900]  And of course, it's a joke. We have received hundreds of complaints from people who said they thought it was real
[2:47:26.900 --> 2:47:31.900]  and when they found out it was fake, they were angry at us for daring to post that video on a news site.
[2:47:31.900 --> 2:47:34.900]  Can you believe that?
[2:47:34.900 --> 2:47:37.900]  Well, yeah, they can't even tell when something's satire.
[2:47:37.900 --> 2:47:40.900]  No, they can't. They absolutely cannot.
[2:47:40.900 --> 2:47:43.900]  This is one thing I'm sure you've noticed it too, when you make a satirical comment.
[2:47:43.900 --> 2:47:47.900]  Don't you get people emailing in who say, how could you dare say that?
[2:47:47.900 --> 2:47:50.900]  How could you say that the health ranger is a terrorist?
[2:47:50.900 --> 2:47:53.900]  You know, they don't realize you were joking.
[2:47:53.900 --> 2:48:00.900]  Man, it's crazy. I've also found the public, well, it doesn't matter.
[2:48:00.900 --> 2:48:06.900]  I'm speechless half the time now, Mike, because, I mean, who could make this up?
[2:48:06.900 --> 2:48:13.900]  Who could come up with them going on TV saying, Mercury's good for your brain and chemicals are good for your kidneys
[2:48:13.900 --> 2:48:21.900]  and the GMO companies are trying to block labeling so you don't know what's in the food?
[2:48:21.900 --> 2:48:28.900]  And the guys owning these companies, the stockholders, they're being hurt by it too.
[2:48:28.900 --> 2:48:32.900]  Yeah. Well, it's even crazier than you might think.
[2:48:32.900 --> 2:48:39.900]  I've documented the FDA's extortion racket, where the FDA will approach a company that makes natural products,
[2:48:39.900 --> 2:48:46.900]  you know, like cherry extracts, something made out of food, and they're trying to sell it as a health supplement,
[2:48:46.900 --> 2:48:53.900]  and the FDA will approach them and will give them a document, a consent decree, that they have to sign.
[2:48:53.900 --> 2:48:58.900]  And in signing so, they admit to crimes that they never committed, such as selling adulterated drugs.
[2:48:58.900 --> 2:49:00.900]  That's what the FDA calls a cherry extract.
[2:49:00.900 --> 2:49:04.900]  Yeah, that's a contract fraud, just like with the IRS. People get tricked into signing it,
[2:49:04.900 --> 2:49:07.900]  and then now they've just signed a contract waving their rights and admitting to crimes.
[2:49:07.900 --> 2:49:08.900]  Yes.
[2:49:08.900 --> 2:49:10.900]  Tell folks about that.
[2:49:10.900 --> 2:49:21.900]  Well, part of the contract is that you have to pay one of the FDA's contractors $100 an hour to come give surprise inspections to your facility.
[2:49:21.900 --> 2:49:27.900]  You have to pay for their hotel, you have to pay for their travel, and $100 an hour for their time, and they can spend unlimited time.
[2:49:27.900 --> 2:49:30.900]  This is how the FDA bankrupts small health companies.
[2:49:30.900 --> 2:49:34.900]  Better people being conned by this. I mean, you know, I mean, it's just like they get on the news and say,
[2:49:34.900 --> 2:49:37.900]  you've got to take vaccines, line up at the courthouse, it's the law.
[2:49:37.900 --> 2:49:42.900]  There is no law, but they have cops with barking dogs and black uniforms, and people cry and go down and do it.
[2:49:42.900 --> 2:49:47.900]  It's the same thing here. They just say, you must sign this, and then in that, and then that's the agreement.
[2:49:47.900 --> 2:49:54.900]  Well, what they do is they threaten that if they don't sign this consent decree, which is an illegal document, of course,
[2:49:54.900 --> 2:50:02.900]  if they don't sign it, the FDA will go invoke the local law enforcement authorities, they'll go invoke the sheriffs or the marshals,
[2:50:02.900 --> 2:50:10.900]  and they will come in with firearms and bulletproof vests and SWAT-style raids, and they will raid your company, take your product, confiscate your computers,
[2:50:10.900 --> 2:50:16.900]  take all your materials, confiscate your customer list, and throw you in prison, and they will do that.
[2:50:16.900 --> 2:50:19.900]  That's the threat, gunpoint enforcement.
[2:50:19.900 --> 2:50:25.900]  For not incriminating yourself and waving your fourth and fifth amendment?
[2:50:25.900 --> 2:50:30.900]  Yes, yes. And you know what? I wish we could get some of these guests on your show.
[2:50:30.900 --> 2:50:32.900]  I've talked to many of them off the radio.
[2:50:32.900 --> 2:50:36.900]  Shut them up. Tell us who you want us to have on. Tell us. I mean, I see them in the news all the time.
[2:50:36.900 --> 2:50:42.900]  I mean, the key here, though, is we're not joking. Cherry extract folks saying, hey, this is good for you.
[2:50:42.900 --> 2:50:47.900]  It has a lot of vitamin C in these other things. Can't do it. Selling vitamin C.
[2:50:47.900 --> 2:50:52.900]  I mean, Codex Alimentarius says you're not going to sell over the counter vitamin C.
[2:50:52.900 --> 2:50:57.900]  Well, that's right. I mean, think about it. You take a cherry off a tree. You know, this is, this is tree.
[2:50:57.900 --> 2:51:02.900]  This is God's creation, human beings. You take a cherry off a tree.
[2:51:02.900 --> 2:51:05.900]  You try to sell it to your neighbor and say, this cherry might be good for you.
[2:51:05.900 --> 2:51:11.900]  Suddenly, you're a criminal selling unapproved, adulterated drugs. I'm not making this up.
[2:51:11.900 --> 2:51:14.900]  You can, you can Google. No, you wrote the articles. You posted the documents.
[2:51:14.900 --> 2:51:16.900]  Tell folks about the website.
[2:51:16.900 --> 2:51:21.900]  Well, it's naturalnews.com free email newsletter. I send out a daily email update of the breaking news.
[2:51:21.900 --> 2:51:27.900]  I keep you informed on natural cures and the dangers of the FDA in the pharmaceutical industry.
[2:51:27.900 --> 2:51:34.900]  That's the bottom line. You know, we're reaching now well over one and a half million readers a month and it just keeps getting bigger.
[2:51:34.900 --> 2:51:47.900]  You know, I've seen reports where the police raid aloe vera farms and say they're drugs now because the DEA can just list something as a drug now.
[2:51:47.900 --> 2:51:50.900]  I mean, did you know they're now going out for aloe vera?
[2:51:50.900 --> 2:51:52.900]  Oh yeah, nothing surprises me anymore.
[2:51:52.900 --> 2:52:00.900]  Aloe vera is evil. Your government will protect you from it. We'll be right back.
[2:52:00.900 --> 2:52:10.900]  Toxic heavy metals negatively impact our health. There in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the products we use and the objects we touch.
[2:52:10.900 --> 2:52:16.900]  Exposure is impossible to avoid. Heavy metals build up within the body over a period of time causing poor health.
[2:52:16.900 --> 2:52:21.900]  However, with chelorex, they can be mobilized and excreted in a safe and effective manner.
[2:52:21.900 --> 2:52:28.900]  Chelorex was developed based on Dr. Alan Greenberg's clinical experience with heavy metal poisoning during his 25 years of medical practice.
[2:52:28.900 --> 2:52:38.900]  Chelorex does not contain EDTA and is made from all natural ingredients, enhancing the body's natural mechanisms for excreting heavy metals and preventing their reabsorption.
[2:52:38.900 --> 2:52:48.900]  Chelorex contains antioxidants to protect the liver, kidneys, central nervous system and immune functions and effectively mobilizes mercury and 15 other heavy metals, aluminum, arsenic, lead and more.
[2:52:48.900 --> 2:53:00.900]  Find out what chelorex can do for you by calling 1-800-675-4568 or visit us online at chelorex.com. That's chelorex.com today.
[2:53:18.900 --> 2:53:25.900]  The Israelis is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:53:25.900 --> 2:53:32.900]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:53:32.900 --> 2:53:36.900]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:53:36.900 --> 2:53:59.900]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value,
[2:53:59.900 --> 2:54:08.900]  what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[2:55:16.900 --> 2:55:26.900]  I know this all sounds fantastical. It is fantastical. It is sensational. It is horrifying as what it is.
[2:55:26.900 --> 2:55:34.900]  It is people so selfish, so decadent, taking over every facet of society that they're destroying themselves.
[2:55:34.900 --> 2:55:40.900]  They worship money. And hey, you got to have money. You got to have nice things.
[2:55:40.900 --> 2:55:46.900]  It makes life more comfortable, secure. But it's not on your hierarchy of needs. It's not what you're reaching for.
[2:55:46.900 --> 2:55:51.900]  The truth, honor, helping people, building beautiful things, being a good person.
[2:55:51.900 --> 2:55:58.900]  Ideas, literature, poetry, film, beauty, wholesomeness, family.
[2:55:58.900 --> 2:56:04.900]  I can't believe how bad GMO food is. I can't believe how toxic the environment is.
[2:56:04.900 --> 2:56:11.900]  Meanwhile, the environmental movement is doing nothing about stopping all of this. In fact, they're fighting us.
[2:56:11.900 --> 2:56:17.900]  What they're doing is busy getting a global carbon tax that will be paid directly to the foreign banks.
[2:56:17.900 --> 2:56:23.900]  That's back in the news today. Mike Adams, I want to take calls coming up in the next hour because they'll take us in all different directions.
[2:56:23.900 --> 2:56:29.900]  So much is going on right now. What's some of the most important things that are hot off the presses?
[2:56:29.900 --> 2:56:36.900]  Another big important issue is the Whole Foods FTC lawsuit. Here's why this is important.
[2:56:36.900 --> 2:56:42.900]  We say we're a nation of law. But the federal government, of course, doesn't have to follow the law.
[2:56:42.900 --> 2:56:52.900]  We've seen that in so many ways over the last few years. But the FTC has even set up its own special court.
[2:56:52.900 --> 2:56:54.900]  By the way, can you still hear me?
[2:56:54.900 --> 2:56:56.900]  Yes, I can, Mike.
[2:56:56.900 --> 2:57:03.900]  I know it's so unusual for me not to interrupt every 10 seconds, but it will make you comfortable. I'll do my normal. Go ahead.
[2:57:03.900 --> 2:57:09.900]  It's hurt a little glitch, but the FTC has set up its own what it calls an administrative court.
[2:57:09.900 --> 2:57:19.900]  Now, it sued Whole Foods and said, you have to come show up in our administrative court, which is stacked with the FTC's own judges, their own decision makers.
[2:57:19.900 --> 2:57:24.900]  Whole Foods has been deemed guilty of a monopoly even before they go to court.
[2:57:24.900 --> 2:57:35.900]  The FTC does this to everybody. All of these companies selling cancer remedies that are sued by the FTC, they have to show up in the FTC's kangaroo court.
[2:57:35.900 --> 2:57:43.900]  Meanwhile, we have the reverse. In St. Louis, Monsanto has their own court that will throw out every suit against them.
[2:57:43.900 --> 2:57:49.900]  Right. In other words, there is no more legal system that works on behalf of the people.
[2:57:49.900 --> 2:57:56.900]  The family courts were set up for eugenics 100 years ago in Europe, 90 years ago, about 95 years ago here in the U.S.
[2:57:56.900 --> 2:58:02.900]  It's not a real court. It's just a judge and goons and no evidence that they just steal children.
[2:58:02.900 --> 2:58:07.900]  That's right. It's all stacked against you. They've decided beforehand what the outcome is going to be.
[2:58:07.900 --> 2:58:16.900]  Whole Foods has sued the FTC to put this in a real court, in a federal court, which of course can also be stacked and manipulated too, but at least you have a fighting chance.
[2:58:16.900 --> 2:58:25.900]  By the way, they're a great company and they've helped break the back and have this tipping point where people are now demanding organics everywhere.
[2:58:25.900 --> 2:58:32.900]  There's no monopoly. There's organic grocery stores in every city up. There's two or three in Austin up against them.
[2:58:32.900 --> 2:58:35.900]  There's no monopoly on grocery stores. The monopoly...
[2:58:35.900 --> 2:58:40.900]  I know. It's an insane idea. The FTC is very selective about what kind of monopoly it will attack.
[2:58:40.900 --> 2:58:52.900]  For example, like you said, the Whole Foods is not a monopoly. You can buy organic foods in any grocery store practically, but the FTC won't touch the monopoly of pharmaceuticals, which are sold at monopoly prices.
[2:58:52.900 --> 2:59:02.900]  It's a protection racket enforced by the FDA. They won't let you buy drugs from Canada or Mexico or other places where they're half the price or even a tenth of the price.
[2:59:02.900 --> 2:59:09.900]  They enforce a monopoly. The FTC won't even consider it. They just cover their eyes and imagine it doesn't exist.
[2:59:09.900 --> 2:59:15.900]  Unbelievable. So how is Whole Foods going in all that? How are they doing?
[2:59:15.900 --> 2:59:21.900]  They're up against the FTC and we don't know if their lawsuit will succeed, but we hope it does and we hope they set a precedent.
[2:59:21.900 --> 2:59:27.900]  Well, I hope the feds aren't able to shut down Whole Foods, but I guess they'll just say they're al-Qaeda and that'll be it.
[2:59:27.900 --> 2:59:31.900]  They're trying to shut them down. They're trying to break them up.
[2:59:31.900 --> 2:59:32.900]  I know.
[2:59:32.900 --> 2:59:40.900]  Look at Whole Foods. Give people clean food. Shut them down. They're evil. Well, they're right back.
[2:59:40.900 --> 2:59:50.900]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:59:50.900 --> 3:00:04.900]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most of Loose Change Final Cut. The long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[3:00:04.900 --> 3:00:15.900]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[3:00:15.900 --> 3:00:26.900]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[3:00:26.900 --> 3:00:34.900]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at infowars.com, while you're visiting the online video store.
[3:00:34.900 --> 3:00:45.900]  Be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles. We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[3:00:45.900 --> 3:01:12.900]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[3:01:12.900 --> 3:01:20.900]  If you have any program note, we're now into the fourth hour. Some days I do all four hours live at PrisonPlanet.tv. Most days we just go live in the fourth hour.
[3:01:20.900 --> 3:01:31.900]  We won't be live today at PrisonPlanet.tv with the video stream, the document cam, the video feeds we do because I've got my whole crew over there getting ready for the test today in the new studio.
[3:01:31.900 --> 3:01:49.900]  We'll take an hour break with the rebroadcast in the first hour, and then I will be live from 4-5pm only at PrisonPlanet.tv and on the infowars.com audio streams.
[3:01:49.900 --> 3:01:55.900]  You'll be able to see the new studio. It's not in its final configuration, but it looks pretty good.
[3:01:55.900 --> 3:02:02.900]  We're also building a separate TV studio in the room next to it. That's all going very well, so I'm very excited about that.
[3:02:02.900 --> 3:02:11.900]  We're going to have phone-in guests on there, in-studio guests. We're going to set it up to where a lot of people have video conferencing, so we'll have a lot of our guests.
[3:02:11.900 --> 3:02:20.900]  It's kind of like when you see me go on MTV Canada or some of the British TV shows. They'll have me turn on my video cam so it's like I'm there in studio.
[3:02:20.900 --> 3:02:25.900]  We're going to do a lot of that. That's all being set up right now, but my great crew want to commend them and thank them.
[3:02:25.900 --> 3:02:29.900]  We're taking your calls coming up the rest of the hour in the next segment with Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[3:02:29.900 --> 3:02:36.900]  He has the health ranger website. He has the naturalnews.com site. A lot of scientists, experts, nutritionists on there.
[3:02:36.900 --> 3:02:41.900]  He himself is a great success story. Before he leaves, I want to tell you a story of how unhealthy he was.
[3:02:41.900 --> 3:02:47.900]  He found out about what he was eating, what was in the mainline food, the fast food, and now the guy is just in super good shape.
[3:02:47.900 --> 3:02:53.900]  It's a real fight. I see it this way. You either totally get into health or you're not into it at all. That's how I am.
[3:02:53.900 --> 3:03:01.900]  I can get totally into health for a month, be jogging, exercising, lose like 10 pounds, and then suddenly, not that I'm super unhealthy, I slide right back.
[3:03:01.900 --> 3:03:08.900]  I drink one beer. I go eat Mexican food one time. Boom. Mexican food, beer every other night.
[3:03:08.900 --> 3:03:12.900]  I'm not saying you can't ever have Mexican food and beer, but folks, it's just all of its bad for you.
[3:03:12.900 --> 3:03:18.900]  Mexican food and beer is nothing compared to the GMO fast food, the prepared food, all of it.
[3:03:18.900 --> 3:03:23.900]  We'll talk about some of the things to avoid with him. Mike, we've got a few minutes left here in this little short segment.
[3:03:23.900 --> 3:03:29.900]  I wanted to ask you, I'm seeing a lot of people awaken, but I also see on the other side, people getting deeper into denial.
[3:03:29.900 --> 3:03:35.900]  There seems to be a lot of folks waking up, but a lot of people clinging to the establishment.
[3:03:35.900 --> 3:03:42.900]  An example, it can be an over that I've seen, 300, 400, I didn't count them, just hundreds of mainstream articles saying,
[3:03:42.900 --> 3:03:48.900]  world governments here, private banks are going to run everything, New World Order, this is world government.
[3:03:48.900 --> 3:03:55.900]  And people go on my message board in the comments and say, this isn't a real article when I'm linked to AP Reuters, Financial Times of London,
[3:03:55.900 --> 3:04:02.900]  or video clips of Gordon Brown saying it, are they government agents posting, or are they just totally in denial?
[3:04:02.900 --> 3:04:08.900]  They're wedded to the fact there's no world government, so they can't say we're right.
[3:04:08.900 --> 3:04:15.900]  Well, I think a lot of people are clearly in denial on many issues, not just the economy and the Fed and everything that's happening there,
[3:04:15.900 --> 3:04:23.900]  but also world government, also on the issues with the environment and the toxicity of the Western textile.
[3:04:23.900 --> 3:04:29.900]  People are in denial all over the place. They're in denial about the dangers of drugs, in denial about what's in their foods.
[3:04:29.900 --> 3:04:36.900]  But like you said, more and more people are waking up. We're seeing more people understand that, you know what?
[3:04:36.900 --> 3:04:43.900]  To be a healthy, happy human being, you've got to have some basic rights, you know, health, freedom rights.
[3:04:43.900 --> 3:04:47.900]  You've got to have the right to have access to accurate information about health.
[3:04:47.900 --> 3:04:53.900]  And some people, though, are confused because there's so much disinformation out there.
[3:04:53.900 --> 3:05:02.900]  This info, masterminds are really, really good, and of course they have their tentacles into the mainstream media, you know, into the video news releases.
[3:05:02.900 --> 3:05:10.900]  They can put a story into one of the main press associations very easily, like, vitamin E will kill you.
[3:05:10.900 --> 3:05:13.900]  You know, I've seen these stories and I have to laugh every time I see one.
[3:05:13.900 --> 3:05:15.900]  But the disinfo is very powerful.
[3:05:15.900 --> 3:05:21.900]  They're now saying vitamin C is bad. Doesn't matter how many Nobel Prize winners, how many scientists, how many studies.
[3:05:21.900 --> 3:05:26.900]  No, of course, every time they do that, they'll use synthetic chemicals and call them vitamin.
[3:05:26.900 --> 3:05:30.900]  But they're not actually studying the vitamins. They're studying synthetic chemicals.
[3:05:30.900 --> 3:05:37.900]  Or they'll feed all the mice GMO food and then say, oh, we found no difference in mice GMO and not.
[3:05:37.900 --> 3:05:46.900]  Oh, yeah, I've seen such bad science, terribly structured scientific studies and journalists who can't interpret science.
[3:05:46.900 --> 3:05:49.900]  And it's just rampant.
[3:05:49.900 --> 3:05:55.900]  Well, you can't hide the cancer rates, all the other rates, what the obesity, you can't hide what's happening.
[3:05:55.900 --> 3:06:01.900]  We're going to come back and take your phone calls at 800-259-921.
[3:06:01.900 --> 3:06:03.900]  Hello, I'm Steve Scheng.
[3:06:03.900 --> 3:06:10.900]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[3:06:10.900 --> 3:06:21.900]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[3:06:21.900 --> 3:06:25.900]  Well, snap out of it. We now have a deadline. Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[3:06:25.900 --> 3:06:37.900]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[3:06:37.900 --> 3:06:43.900]  While I take the general at his word, my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[3:06:43.900 --> 3:06:49.900]  Contact eFoodsDirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[3:06:49.900 --> 3:06:53.900]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[3:06:53.900 --> 3:07:01.900]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:07:01.900 --> 3:07:03.900]  Hi, this is Steve Scheng.
[3:07:03.900 --> 3:07:08.900]  The spirit of America is independence. The greatest gift of independence is food.
[3:07:08.900 --> 3:07:13.900]  Over one-third of Americans can't afford to buy food and pay their other expenses.
[3:07:13.900 --> 3:07:16.900]  Lines of credit and cards are often cut back or canceled.
[3:07:16.900 --> 3:07:23.900]  Last year, the eFoodsDirect holiday food unit was a fun and exciting one-year supply with a great price.
[3:07:23.900 --> 3:07:30.900]  This year, to quickly complete our food supply preparations, eFoodsDirect has created a very serious holiday unit.
[3:07:30.900 --> 3:07:36.900]  This super food supply costs $300 less than the basic Liberty one-year supply and has more food.
[3:07:36.900 --> 3:07:40.900]  That's safe food for less than half the cost of last year's groceries.
[3:07:40.900 --> 3:07:45.900]  Gift certificates are available for shipments that will not arrive by Christmas.
[3:07:45.900 --> 3:07:48.900]  Food is the gift of life and love this holiday season.
[3:07:48.900 --> 3:07:54.900]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:07:54.900 --> 3:08:01.900]  That's 800-409-5633.
[3:08:01.900 --> 3:08:08.900]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:08:08.900 --> 3:08:12.900]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[3:08:12.900 --> 3:08:13.900]  Bin Laden.
[3:08:13.900 --> 3:08:14.900]  This is his MO.
[3:08:14.900 --> 3:08:17.900]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:08:17.900 --> 3:08:24.900]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:08:24.900 --> 3:08:31.900]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:08:31.900 --> 3:08:35.900]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:08:35.900 --> 3:08:42.900]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:08:42.900 --> 3:08:47.900]  the warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.
[3:08:47.900 --> 3:08:54.900]  Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:08:54.900 --> 3:09:02.900]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[3:09:02.900 --> 3:09:09.900]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:09:09.900 --> 3:09:19.900]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:09:19.900 --> 3:09:26.900]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central Standard Time, now 11 to 3 p.m.
[3:09:26.900 --> 3:09:31.900]  We are here live. Thank you for joining us. John, Robert, Chris, Sue, Larry, others.
[3:09:31.900 --> 3:09:36.900]  We are going to go to your phone calls. Before I do that, Mike, just briefly.
[3:09:36.900 --> 3:09:41.900]  So much is happening. Any other areas we haven't gotten into that need to be covered?
[3:09:41.900 --> 3:09:48.900]  Yeah, something that deserves to be mentioned here. Just listening to some of your sponsors there who have long-term storable foods,
[3:09:48.900 --> 3:09:53.900]  I really want to urge listeners to think very carefully about what could happen next year.
[3:09:53.900 --> 3:09:58.900]  We're going to have inflation kick in because of the debasing of the money supply thanks to the Fed,
[3:09:58.900 --> 3:10:01.900]  which means food is going to get more expensive.
[3:10:01.900 --> 3:10:06.900]  If food gets really expensive, if it goes up 40 or 50%, we could see, potentially,
[3:10:06.900 --> 3:10:12.900]  an Obama administration putting in price controls that will lead to immediate food shortages.
[3:10:12.900 --> 3:10:16.900]  It always happens. Price controls cause food shortages.
[3:10:16.900 --> 3:10:22.900]  Folks, if you're not prepared with long-term storable foods, I think you're putting yourself in real danger.
[3:10:22.900 --> 3:10:26.900]  It's better to be safe and prepared than to be late and unprepared.
[3:10:26.900 --> 3:10:30.900]  So I just want to urge people to think carefully about that issue.
[3:10:30.900 --> 3:10:36.900]  Absolutely. They should go to eFoodsDirect.com. It's all clean, healthy, non-GMO food from right here inside the United States,
[3:10:36.900 --> 3:10:41.900]  except for their banana chips. Those obviously are not grown here in the United States.
[3:10:41.900 --> 3:10:45.900]  Our sponsor is eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:10:45.900 --> 3:10:50.900]  Let's go ahead and take some phone calls. John, in Wisconsin, you're on the air with Mike Adams.
[3:10:50.900 --> 3:10:53.900]  Yeah, how are you doing, Mike? Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[3:10:53.900 --> 3:11:00.900]  You know, we're talking about the medications and stuff they give out that are either bad for you or don't do anything for you.
[3:11:00.900 --> 3:11:05.900]  I myself am a three-time combat vet, and of course, they do that in the military.
[3:11:05.900 --> 3:11:09.900]  We all know, I was surprised that they did it to the civilians.
[3:11:09.900 --> 3:11:14.900]  Even more surprised they do it to people once we get out from the VA as well.
[3:11:14.900 --> 3:11:21.900]  And I'm wondering, what is it we can do with those money-loving people
[3:11:21.900 --> 3:11:27.900]  giving us things we don't need or that hurts us in the Patriot community, Alex?
[3:11:27.900 --> 3:11:32.900]  Specifically, you have to assess things for yourself.
[3:11:32.900 --> 3:11:38.900]  I mean, with the government end, it's been admitted that they have used troops in contracts,
[3:11:38.900 --> 3:11:47.900]  secret contracts that have come out decades later with Big Pharma to make you take sometimes hundreds of vaccines
[3:11:47.900 --> 3:11:53.900]  if you're in there more than 10 years, where they're giving them shots and not telling them what it is.
[3:11:53.900 --> 3:11:58.900]  They're making you take anthrax vaccine or making you take the smallpox vaccine
[3:11:58.900 --> 3:12:03.900]  that admittedly killed a bunch of people until the troops got mad, the public got mad, and they withdrew it.
[3:12:03.900 --> 3:12:09.900]  Then you bring up the, quote, Patriot community, and I've said this many times,
[3:12:09.900 --> 3:12:17.900]  buyer beware. I mean, you have to research products yourself. You have to find out, just because the government and the media do bad things,
[3:12:17.900 --> 3:12:22.900]  doesn't mean the public. That's what I was saying earlier about supplements in the whole supplement place.
[3:12:22.900 --> 3:12:27.900]  But I mean, take a place like Whole Foods. You go to Whole Foods, I'm not trying to worship them.
[3:12:27.900 --> 3:12:30.900]  They're not perfect. Some of it's overpriced in my opinion, but you go there.
[3:12:30.900 --> 3:12:36.900]  We've got the big test Whole Foods. It's based here in Austin, so they have their megastore where they test stuff out.
[3:12:36.900 --> 3:12:43.900]  And they have really knowledgeable people there. I've done my own research and they will really recommend what you need
[3:12:43.900 --> 3:12:48.900]  and what's been proven in foreign studies and government studies and what was used hundreds of years ago
[3:12:48.900 --> 3:12:56.900]  that has some nutritive or health effects. Generally, I have to say, even for central market here in town,
[3:12:56.900 --> 3:13:03.900]  the guys that work there, they'll say, well, look, this is a great product right here, but this one's just as good and a lot cheaper.
[3:13:03.900 --> 3:13:10.900]  I mean, most of these stores now, they don't even sell the chemical cocktail vitamins.
[3:13:10.900 --> 3:13:18.900]  And perhaps, Mike, we should explain that to people that the stuff you buy, like Centrum or whatever, the stuff you see at the drugstore,
[3:13:18.900 --> 3:13:23.900]  those are chemicals that mimic the vitamins and break down into all these horrible things.
[3:13:23.900 --> 3:13:26.900]  They stress the liver. They stress the whole body. I mean, that's been proven.
[3:13:26.900 --> 3:13:34.900]  They tell a lot of folks that are about to have their liver rejected, don't take vitamins for a while, you know, the chemical vitamins.
[3:13:34.900 --> 3:13:41.900]  And so it's really up to you to research, but if somebody's saying, we're selling clay and it'll heal everything,
[3:13:41.900 --> 3:13:47.900]  or, well, we've got this product and you wash your eyes with it and it washes your cataracts out,
[3:13:47.900 --> 3:13:53.900]  you know, some guy looked like Colonel Sanders pushing that years ago who I attacked. People didn't like it. I didn't care.
[3:13:53.900 --> 3:14:00.900]  Or you'll hear him going, I got this machine that magically heals you, cancer guaranteed.
[3:14:00.900 --> 3:14:09.900]  It's only $5,000 or we got a magnet machine. We just need 100 of you to invest and then we'll ship it right out to you.
[3:14:09.900 --> 3:14:13.900]  I mean, you know, that kind of stuff. I mean, it's usually pretty obvious.
[3:14:13.900 --> 3:14:22.900]  Right. You know what kind of gets me frustrated is sometimes it seems that everything's so focused on the product that we forget about the message.
[3:14:22.900 --> 3:14:27.900]  And, you know, I mean, I mean, I mean, I'm not sure you can understand where I'm coming from.
[3:14:27.900 --> 3:14:34.900]  You're talking about us. Well, hey, listen, if you got a bunch of money and you want to endow us, in fact, I'll say this right now.
[3:14:34.900 --> 3:14:41.900]  If somebody gives me $2 million, I will operate for a couple years without selling anything.
[3:14:41.900 --> 3:14:44.900]  I don't know how I'll get the DVDs out because I would burn through that.
[3:14:44.900 --> 3:14:50.900]  I mean, it costs me over a million dollars a year to operate and just have 15 employees and pay for things and pay for bandwidth.
[3:14:50.900 --> 3:14:53.900]  Okay. And then shortwave and stuff. Okay.
[3:14:53.900 --> 3:15:00.900]  So and that's why I have to hustle, but I do sell products I believe in to be able to get that done.
[3:15:00.900 --> 3:15:03.900]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[3:15:03.900 --> 3:15:06.900]  It's kind of like living in the real world and I appreciate your call.
[3:15:06.900 --> 3:15:09.900]  You know, it's kind of like living in the real world.
[3:15:09.900 --> 3:15:13.900]  If you're listening on the Internet right now for free, I pay for that.
[3:15:13.900 --> 3:15:14.900]  Okay.
[3:15:14.900 --> 3:15:17.900]  I mean, I have over 100,000 podcasters a day.
[3:15:17.900 --> 3:15:20.900]  That's about five grand now a month for me.
[3:15:20.900 --> 3:15:24.900]  And you know what? There may come a day where I can't get the money together to send it out.
[3:15:24.900 --> 3:15:27.900]  The podcast is just going to end.
[3:15:27.900 --> 3:15:31.900]  And then so, so, you know, again, it isn't about me.
[3:15:31.900 --> 3:15:33.900]  I'm here doing a radio show.
[3:15:33.900 --> 3:15:37.900]  I'm here saying, buy my videos, but you can make copies of it.
[3:15:37.900 --> 3:15:42.900]  And this is what happens all day long in the message boards and the comments.
[3:15:42.900 --> 3:15:45.900]  What are you going to do about the banker stealing 8.5 trillion?
[3:15:45.900 --> 3:15:48.900]  This is the show that told you they were going to do it.
[3:15:48.900 --> 3:15:49.900]  Okay.
[3:15:49.900 --> 3:15:51.900]  And who do I bring on?
[3:15:51.900 --> 3:15:56.900]  I bring on the health ranger and I plug their site and tell you support them because they need support to grow.
[3:15:56.900 --> 3:15:58.900]  We need to get big and strong.
[3:15:58.900 --> 3:16:00.900]  I bring on all Betty Martini.
[3:16:00.900 --> 3:16:04.900]  I bring on rifle training groups and say, go sign up with them.
[3:16:04.900 --> 3:16:05.900]  I send people business.
[3:16:05.900 --> 3:16:08.900]  I don't say, hey, Apple seed, give me some money to come on.
[3:16:08.900 --> 3:16:09.900]  I have them on.
[3:16:09.900 --> 3:16:13.900]  This is a platform to try to capitalize and energize our movement.
[3:16:13.900 --> 3:16:18.900]  And somehow the media and the government did a mind game trick to tell us we can't sell a book.
[3:16:18.900 --> 3:16:19.900]  We can't sell a video.
[3:16:19.900 --> 3:16:22.900]  Well, because you brought that up, I'm going to do it right now.
[3:16:22.900 --> 3:16:27.900]  I want you to go to infowars.com and I want you to click on the shop button.
[3:16:27.900 --> 3:16:39.900]  And I want you to go buy all jacked up a DVD that Mike Adams worked on with a bunch of doctors and other people about getting your young people in a hip way to care about not being depressed, not being on Prozac,
[3:16:39.900 --> 3:16:44.900]  and how exercise and healthy living can make them happy and empowered.
[3:16:44.900 --> 3:16:50.900]  Very important film and you better believe we're selling it because it costs them a lot of money to make it.
[3:16:50.900 --> 3:16:56.900]  And so absolutely we live on planet earth and not in the Wizard of Oz land where we got silver slippers we clicked together.
[3:16:56.900 --> 3:17:01.900]  And I want everybody to get in there and buy the film for $24.95.
[3:17:01.900 --> 3:17:03.900]  Mike Adams, tell us about all jacked up.
[3:17:03.900 --> 3:17:06.900]  Well, I just want to say I second everything you just said, Alex.
[3:17:06.900 --> 3:17:12.900]  None of this happens for free and personally I have never been paid a dime by natural news.
[3:17:12.900 --> 3:17:14.900]  I've been doing this for volunteer for five years.
[3:17:14.900 --> 3:17:17.900]  Well, I think you should try to make money so you can expand.
[3:17:17.900 --> 3:17:19.900]  We need to make money.
[3:17:19.900 --> 3:17:22.900]  The government takes our money and enslaves us.
[3:17:22.900 --> 3:17:24.900]  In fact, I'm going to stop right there.
[3:17:24.900 --> 3:17:26.900]  Send me donations listeners.
[3:17:26.900 --> 3:17:30.900]  I'm not going to let people cow me into not fighting the New World Order.
[3:17:30.900 --> 3:17:33.900]  There is nothing wrong with expanding what we're doing.
[3:17:33.900 --> 3:17:34.900]  Go ahead.
[3:17:34.900 --> 3:17:36.900]  I agree with you.
[3:17:36.900 --> 3:17:38.900]  We got to pay bandwidth.
[3:17:38.900 --> 3:17:39.900]  We got to pay staff.
[3:17:39.900 --> 3:17:41.900]  This doesn't just happen spontaneously.
[3:17:41.900 --> 3:17:44.900]  You don't just wake up and turn on a switch and just start talking.
[3:17:44.900 --> 3:17:45.900]  You have to plan.
[3:17:45.900 --> 3:17:46.900]  You have to research.
[3:17:46.900 --> 3:17:48.900]  You have to have an infrastructure.
[3:17:48.900 --> 3:17:49.900]  That takes money.
[3:17:49.900 --> 3:17:50.900]  No, no, no, no.
[3:17:50.900 --> 3:17:54.900]  You shouldn't have the money you need to pay for labs to test the milk.
[3:17:54.900 --> 3:17:58.900]  So you can warn people and get national coverage from Alameen.
[3:17:58.900 --> 3:18:00.900]  How dare you?
[3:18:00.900 --> 3:18:04.900]  Right there would have cost $3,000 if we could find a lab that would do it.
[3:18:04.900 --> 3:18:05.900]  You shouldn't do it.
[3:18:05.900 --> 3:18:06.900]  We should just bring Alameen.
[3:18:06.900 --> 3:18:07.900]  How dare you?
[3:18:07.900 --> 3:18:08.900]  Exactly.
[3:18:08.900 --> 3:18:10.900]  Well, anyway, I'll jack up a great film.
[3:18:10.900 --> 3:18:12.900]  I'm glad you recommended it.
[3:18:12.900 --> 3:18:15.900]  Yeah, I'm in it, but I didn't produce it.
[3:18:15.900 --> 3:18:26.900]  It was produced by Fairy Films, which has done a fantastic job shedding light on the toxicity of foods and sodas and all those junk that teenagers are getting into and it's ruining their lives.
[3:18:26.900 --> 3:18:34.900]  And the film shows a path out of that, shows kids in a hip way how to get out of that system and get onto a track of health.
[3:18:34.900 --> 3:18:37.900]  And it's a very good film, highly recommended.
[3:18:37.900 --> 3:18:38.900]  Absolutely.
[3:18:38.900 --> 3:18:52.900]  You know, going back though, in the alternative health and nutrients and vitamins, the government is now issuing licenses to big pharma to put out vitamin C to put out pharmaceutical fish oil.
[3:18:52.900 --> 3:18:57.900]  But a bottle of the vitamin C that would cost $3 cost, guess what, over a hundred.
[3:18:57.900 --> 3:19:06.900]  A bottle of the big pharma made fish oil, which they're admitting has all these health effects and they've gone and gotten approved, cost $200.
[3:19:06.900 --> 3:19:11.900]  Now, I'm not selling fish oil here, but I'm telling folks they should buy it, but here's the difference.
[3:19:11.900 --> 3:19:13.900]  Here's the difference.
[3:19:13.900 --> 3:19:17.900]  We're not the government coming and trying to make you take vaccines.
[3:19:17.900 --> 3:19:21.900]  We're not the government trying to make kids get on Prozac and Ritalin and making trips, take it.
[3:19:21.900 --> 3:19:23.900]  Do you see the difference?
[3:19:23.900 --> 3:19:27.900]  We're saying you need to become informed yourself.
[3:19:27.900 --> 3:19:28.900]  Go ahead, Mike.
[3:19:28.900 --> 3:19:32.900]  Well, just going to comment on, you talked about junk vitamins versus quality vitamins.
[3:19:32.900 --> 3:19:34.900]  You're absolutely right.
[3:19:34.900 --> 3:19:36.900]  And there are frauds in every industry.
[3:19:36.900 --> 3:19:45.900]  And a lot of consumers don't know this, but many of the junk chemical vitamins sold on the market today are actually made by pharmaceutical companies.
[3:19:45.900 --> 3:19:55.900]  So you see, they dismiss the vitamins, but then they buy a vitamin company, they cheapen the formula, they put in the chemicals and they sell vitamins even though they say they don't work,
[3:19:55.900 --> 3:20:00.900]  because they want that money and they're going to sell the cheapest, most contaminated product they can find.
[3:20:00.900 --> 3:20:03.900]  And the reason they do that is because of the petrochemical economy.
[3:20:03.900 --> 3:20:09.900]  They've all made deals to be able to get rid of their toxic waste from oil.
[3:20:09.900 --> 3:20:12.900]  And some of it is all petrochemical derived.
[3:20:12.900 --> 3:20:16.900]  And here's what people can look for. You want to tell the difference between a junk multivitamin and a quality?
[3:20:16.900 --> 3:20:18.900]  Look for the vitamin B12.
[3:20:18.900 --> 3:20:20.900]  Find out what that ingredient is.
[3:20:20.900 --> 3:20:28.900]  If it is cyanocobalamin, starts with the prefix of cyanide, cyanocobalamin, then you should avoid it.
[3:20:28.900 --> 3:20:29.900]  It's cheap.
[3:20:29.900 --> 3:20:31.900]  In my opinion, it's not healthy.
[3:20:31.900 --> 3:20:33.900]  It may even be bad for you.
[3:20:33.900 --> 3:20:34.900]  Look for something else.
[3:20:34.900 --> 3:20:35.900]  Vitamin B12 should be...
[3:20:35.900 --> 3:20:41.900]  Look for vitamins to say on the front, from natural plant sources.
[3:20:41.900 --> 3:20:42.900]  Exactly.
[3:20:42.900 --> 3:20:44.900]  And then get high-grade supplements.
[3:20:44.900 --> 3:20:45.900]  They will work.
[3:20:45.900 --> 3:20:46.900]  They work wonders for you.
[3:20:46.900 --> 3:20:47.900]  They will be absorbed.
[3:20:47.900 --> 3:20:49.900]  The others go right through you.
[3:20:49.900 --> 3:20:51.900]  And you better be glad they're going right through you.
[3:20:51.900 --> 3:20:57.900]  Because when you do metabolize them, you get green eyes, you know, yellow around them.
[3:20:57.900 --> 3:20:59.900]  It just starts killing your liver.
[3:21:01.900 --> 3:21:07.900]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail, comes an increase in crime.
[3:21:07.900 --> 3:21:09.900]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[3:21:09.900 --> 3:21:11.900]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[3:21:11.900 --> 3:21:15.900]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[3:21:15.900 --> 3:21:19.900]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.

[3:22:00.900 --> 3:22:03.900]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[3:22:03.900 --> 3:22:08.900]  I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[3:22:08.900 --> 3:22:11.900]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[3:22:11.900 --> 3:22:14.900]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[3:22:14.900 --> 3:22:18.900]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the fallout or commission you're seeing far.
[3:22:18.900 --> 3:22:20.900]  We sit down to shadow.
[3:22:20.900 --> 3:22:27.900]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:22:27.900 --> 3:22:33.900]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:22:33.900 --> 3:22:37.900]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:22:40.900 --> 3:22:43.900]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:22:43.900 --> 3:22:46.900]  Well, Helen is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:22:46.900 --> 3:22:52.900]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of my life.

[3:22:58.900 --> 3:23:18.900]  It's now time to take the revolution at the next level.
[3:23:18.900 --> 3:23:31.900]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government in interest.
[3:23:31.900 --> 3:23:34.900]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[3:23:34.900 --> 3:23:40.900]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency. However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.

[3:25:01.900 --> 3:25:15.900]  I want to get through more of these calls, Mike Adams, but then let's get back into good vitamins versus the chemical knockoffs. That's an important point you brought up.
[3:25:15.900 --> 3:25:19.900]  Robert in California, then Chris, Sue, Larry and others. Go ahead, Robert.
[3:25:19.900 --> 3:25:20.900]  Hey, is Mike still there?
[3:25:20.900 --> 3:25:21.900]  Yes, he is.
[3:25:21.900 --> 3:25:29.900]  Thank you for taking my call. I'm a longtime listener. I wanted to start off by saying you brought up the fluoride issue a couple years ago, and I was blown away.
[3:25:29.900 --> 3:25:39.900]  I have a health class in college, and at the end of the class we could give a report on something, so I picked fluoride, and I told everybody, listen, this comes from the aluminum industry, and they had toxic poison they had to get rid of,
[3:25:39.900 --> 3:25:46.900]  and they had to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to the state to get rid of it, but instead the state would pay them to put it in your drinking water, and they laughed and said,
[3:25:46.900 --> 3:25:50.900]  but my dentist has been giving me fluoride pills for years. It has to be good for me.
[3:25:50.900 --> 3:26:07.900]  Well, that also started during the Manhattan process, because they knew German intelligence, so much of intelligence is on the ground, that if they saw them hauling out the sodium fluoride from those plants, they would know that they were purifying uranium,
[3:26:07.900 --> 3:26:16.900]  and so they started secretly dumping it in the water, and they said, oh, we found no bad effects, so they used that internal Manhattan study to then approve putting it in the water.
[3:26:16.900 --> 3:26:31.900]  And as always, look, when they take crude oil to break it down, the majority of it they end up not being able to use, so they break it into thousands of products, and they had public conferences where they said we're going to create a petrol economy,
[3:26:31.900 --> 3:26:37.900]  and I'm not even against oil, my point is, I'm against all the toxic waste that they then engineer into the society.
[3:26:37.900 --> 3:26:54.900]  Mike? Yeah, well, that's a very good description, and fluoride that's dripped into the water supply is often fluorosilific acid, which is not naturally occurring fluoride, and the local dentist, the local pro-fluoride people will just blatantly lie about it.
[3:26:54.900 --> 3:27:00.900]  I've had debates, I've been in city town hall meetings with these people, they'll just lie about it.
[3:27:00.900 --> 3:27:09.900]  Well, now the American Dental Association said two years ago that children shouldn't have fluoride now, so you have one.
[3:27:09.900 --> 3:27:22.900]  Yeah, the fluoride issue, we are winning it. I mean, it's ridiculous, just at the beginning, common sense says that if there's a substance that topically treats the teeth, remember this is a topical treatment, you probably shouldn't swallow it.
[3:27:22.900 --> 3:27:33.900]  I mean, you don't put sunscreen, you don't swallow sunscreen to be protected against UV radiation on your skin, you put it on your skin. Even if fluoride works, you should just rub it on your teeth and rinse it out.
[3:27:33.900 --> 3:27:37.900]  You don't swallow stuff, you don't swallow shampoo to have clean hair, it's ridiculous.
[3:27:37.900 --> 3:27:50.900]  I had two more points on the fluoride, because right after I gave that, I live in North County of San Diego, Escondido, and our city took a vote and put it on the ballot to vote on whether we should have fluoride in our water.
[3:27:50.900 --> 3:28:04.900]  We voted it down, and then the state regulatory guys came in and said, well, it's not healthy enough for our state buildings that work in your city, so we have to fortify all your water with fluoride, and they just overrode the people and did it anyway.
[3:28:04.900 --> 3:28:10.900]  And my dentist, I told this to, and she said, well, the mercury in red amalgam is no worse than a tainted can of tuna.
[3:28:10.900 --> 3:28:19.900]  You know what you should bring to her? I forget his name, we've interviewed him. He was the top dentist, and he was the head of government agency in Canada.
[3:28:19.900 --> 3:28:28.900]  But now about 20 years ago, he nationally led the move to fluoridate, and then about five years ago, he found out, he thought it was calcium fluoride, they'd shown him fake information.
[3:28:28.900 --> 3:28:42.900]  He didn't know that it was the type of acid that Mike just mentioned, which they use under the regulations, the regs worldwide, is a catch-all for lead, mercury, arsenic, and over 100 other chemicals.
[3:28:42.900 --> 3:28:45.900]  So they don't just put sodium fluoride in, Mike.
[3:28:45.900 --> 3:28:57.900]  Well, you know, common sense should prevail here. If you actually go to the water plants, and I've toured water treatment facilities, and I asked the guys who actually put the fluoride into the water, I said, well, what do you have to wear to handle this?
[3:28:57.900 --> 3:29:06.900]  And they have to wear, you know, the chemical suits. They have to have these big, thick gloves and the hoods in case some of it splashes on them so they won't be contaminated.
[3:29:06.900 --> 3:29:11.900]  Here is one of the most deadly chemicals out there. If you breathe a whiff of pure fluoride, you are dead in minutes.
[3:29:11.900 --> 3:29:22.900]  Yeah, absolutely. And I took a vial of a liquid to one of a town hall meeting, I labeled it fluoride, I told them I had a vial of fluoride, and I asked a dentist to drink it. And you know what? Not one of them would.
[3:29:22.900 --> 3:29:30.900]  Well, what does the toothpaste say? It says, if you swallow a pea size, and you know children like to eat it, call poison control immediately.
[3:29:30.900 --> 3:29:41.900]  And folks, before I even knew about fluoride, when I was five, six years old, I told the story, every morning my daddy was a dentist, I loved to brush my teeth, and I would brush him, and then I would go lay down on the couch and have this headache and feel so bad.
[3:29:41.900 --> 3:29:49.900]  And then by the time I was a teenager, I started brushing with non fluoride, and the pain went away. The pain just went away.
[3:29:49.900 --> 3:29:55.900]  I just got one more point on this melamine, if I could. Last year they had the pet food recall because of all the melamine in it.
[3:29:55.900 --> 3:30:03.900]  So now what? So now we're supposed to accept that they can recall melamine for our pets because they know we love Fido and make billions in pet food profits for China.
[3:30:03.900 --> 3:30:11.900]  But it's okay to poison you and your baby, so I just like to ask the elite, you know, what's the acceptable levels of poison they consume daily, you know?
[3:30:11.900 --> 3:30:13.900]  And thank you for your great job, thanks.
[3:30:13.900 --> 3:30:18.900]  Good point, Mike. We'll come back and take more calls in a long segment coming up. Boy, time goes by quick. It's good having you here.

[3:32:00.900 --> 3:32:06.900]  Today, I'm like any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:32:06.900 --> 3:32:10.900]  The enemies struck America on September. But who is the enemy?
[3:32:10.900 --> 3:32:15.900]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:32:15.900 --> 3:32:22.900]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:32:22.900 --> 3:32:29.900]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:32:29.900 --> 3:32:33.900]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:32:33.900 --> 3:32:41.900]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[3:32:41.900 --> 3:32:46.900]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemy, get the DVD at infowars.com

[3:32:58.900 --> 3:33:06.900]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic. This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[3:33:06.900 --> 3:33:11.900]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver,
[3:33:11.900 --> 3:33:17.900]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[3:33:17.900 --> 3:33:23.900]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nail-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level,
[3:33:23.900 --> 3:33:28.900]  and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[3:33:28.900 --> 3:33:33.900]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper,

[3:34:12.900 --> 3:34:16.900]  We're the renegades, and it's atomic age.
[3:34:16.900 --> 3:34:20.900]  It's atomic age, so renegade.
[3:34:20.900 --> 3:34:24.900]  Renegade, and it's atomic age.
[3:34:24.900 --> 3:34:28.900]  It's atomic age, so renegade.
[3:34:28.900 --> 3:34:32.900]  Sister, please, don't re-gages, and the days of ancient Greece,
[3:34:32.900 --> 3:34:36.900]  walked down through the Middle Ages, then it just kept going through changes,
[3:34:36.900 --> 3:34:40.900]  and then the Renaissance came, and the time just came to change.
[3:34:40.900 --> 3:34:43.900]  But they were always renegades, like you say.
[3:34:43.900 --> 3:34:48.900]  Utopia, the Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, they were renegades.
[3:34:48.900 --> 3:34:51.900]  Of their time in age, somebody renegade.
[3:34:51.900 --> 3:34:54.900]  Renegade, renegade, renegade.
[3:34:54.900 --> 3:34:58.900]  We're the renegades of pop, we're the renegades of pop, pop.
[3:34:58.900 --> 3:35:02.900]  Renegade, renegade, renegade.
[3:35:02.900 --> 3:35:05.900]  We're the renegades of pop, we're the renegades of pop.
[3:35:05.900 --> 3:35:10.900]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[3:35:10.900 --> 3:35:13.900]  We're going to go back to your phone calls.
[3:35:13.900 --> 3:35:17.900]  Chris, Sue, Larry, Francesca, Clint, and others as quickly as possible.
[3:35:17.900 --> 3:35:21.900]  In just a moment, before we go back to Mike Adams, the health ranger,
[3:35:21.900 --> 3:35:25.900]  remember this show was made possible by our sponsors, and I endorse the sponsors.
[3:35:25.900 --> 3:35:29.900]  If you hear me plugging something, I believe in it, I use it.
[3:35:29.900 --> 3:35:33.900]  And one of those great sponsors is Acola Blue.
[3:35:33.900 --> 3:35:36.900]  AcolaBlue.com, E-C-O-L-O, Blue.com.
[3:35:36.900 --> 3:35:41.900]  The atmospheric water generator for the home pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[3:35:41.900 --> 3:35:43.900]  Then it goes through five filters.
[3:35:43.900 --> 3:35:48.900]  It's like a water cooler with no water tank, no water bottle on top.
[3:35:48.900 --> 3:35:51.900]  It just grabs it out of the air, then runs it through five filters.
[3:35:51.900 --> 3:35:53.900]  You want to get away from fluoride and all that?
[3:35:53.900 --> 3:35:54.900]  This is the way to do it.
[3:35:54.900 --> 3:36:01.900]  AcolaBlue.com or 866-585-4044-866-585-4044.
[3:36:01.900 --> 3:36:05.900]  And then a new sponsor, but they're from Solutions & Science that, again,
[3:36:05.900 --> 3:36:08.900]  have a whole bunch of products we promote and sell here.
[3:36:08.900 --> 3:36:12.900]  But they, for over a year, have been saying, man, you guys need to solar.
[3:36:12.900 --> 3:36:15.900]  And because I know you always get good deals from folks who have great products,
[3:36:15.900 --> 3:36:22.900]  and so they've been searching for the best solar panel generator system all in one for a low price,
[3:36:22.900 --> 3:36:24.900]  and they have it.
[3:36:24.900 --> 3:36:29.900]  It's mysolarbackup.com, mysolarbackup.com.
[3:36:29.900 --> 3:36:33.900]  And a lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow, ice storms,
[3:36:33.900 --> 3:36:35.900]  or even a rural area.
[3:36:35.900 --> 3:36:39.900]  Folks should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do it.
[3:36:39.900 --> 3:36:44.900]  The solar power generator is available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[3:36:44.900 --> 3:36:47.900]  It's designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand.
[3:36:47.900 --> 3:36:49.900]  And if you need more, just get more of these.
[3:36:49.900 --> 3:36:53.900]  In the event of any disaster or outage, and you get an emergency power backup kit
[3:36:53.900 --> 3:36:56.900]  which consists of the power source, 1,800 power plant,
[3:36:56.900 --> 3:37:00.900]  and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[3:37:00.900 --> 3:37:02.900]  Mysolarbackup.com.
[3:37:02.900 --> 3:37:12.900]  We can always give them a call, get the brochure, or ask them about it, at 877-327-0365-877-327-0365
[3:37:12.900 --> 3:37:15.900]  Mysolarbackup.com.
[3:37:15.900 --> 3:37:18.900]  Going back to Mike Adams and the calls.
[3:37:18.900 --> 3:37:20.900]  Mike, let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[3:37:20.900 --> 3:37:22.900]  You're on the air, Chris. Thanks for holding.
[3:37:22.900 --> 3:37:24.900]  Hi, do you read me?
[3:37:24.900 --> 3:37:25.900]  Yes, sir.
[3:37:25.900 --> 3:37:28.900]  Since you mentioned addictions, and that's what the New World Order is,
[3:37:28.900 --> 3:37:34.900]  trying to make us form a dependence on them in order to attack our will to live independently.
[3:37:34.900 --> 3:37:41.900]  And I wanted to ask what kind of supplements like Kudzu root would be good for fighting cravings and addictions.
[3:37:41.900 --> 3:37:45.900]  And I read an article that you wrote a couple years ago, Mike,
[3:37:45.900 --> 3:37:53.900]  that talked about texturized vegetable protein, which I've noticed is in a lot of these survivalist foods.
[3:37:53.900 --> 3:37:57.900]  And I just want to warn folks to be aware of that.
[3:37:57.900 --> 3:38:10.900]  That's got the female hormone from the improper processing of the main filler food that isn't so many of these, correct?
[3:38:10.900 --> 3:38:14.900]  Well, I've noticed that it's in one of your sponsors' foods.
[3:38:14.900 --> 3:38:19.900]  And if you're going to order from them, I would just suggest that you ask that to be substituted if possible.
[3:38:19.900 --> 3:38:24.900]  And I wanted to also ask, would you think about a living multivitamin such as wheatgrass,
[3:38:24.900 --> 3:38:29.900]  which is easy to grow in just a week, and other superfoods that you might want to comment on,
[3:38:29.900 --> 3:38:31.900]  which are also survival foods?
[3:38:31.900 --> 3:38:35.900]  And until they start skimping on the melamine and the metals,
[3:38:35.900 --> 3:38:42.900]  what would you say about flushing out these toxins with things like modified citrus pectin, fallvic or humic acid,
[3:38:42.900 --> 3:38:45.900]  the essential minerals to flush out the heavy metals?
[3:38:45.900 --> 3:38:49.900]  Well, let me ask you this. What specifically are you talking about?
[3:38:49.900 --> 3:38:54.900]  Are you talking about the stuff that... I mean, specifically, what food are you talking about?
[3:38:54.900 --> 3:38:59.900]  Well, I know that the food that you direct has the TVP in it, and I just would...
[3:38:59.900 --> 3:39:03.900]  That's just something I wouldn't eat because Mike said that even the animals won't eat it.
[3:39:03.900 --> 3:39:08.900]  Yeah, well, that's the texturized vegetable protein, and that's from what specifically?
[3:39:08.900 --> 3:39:10.900]  That's from soy, or soy, but...
[3:39:10.900 --> 3:39:16.900]  Yeah, so I wanted to ask... I mean, some soy is good, isn't it? And I believe it's how soy is processed,
[3:39:16.900 --> 3:39:18.900]  but Mike is really the expert on this.
[3:39:18.900 --> 3:39:23.900]  Let me give you some answers on that. Really well-informed caller. Thanks for your question.
[3:39:23.900 --> 3:39:29.900]  The TVP, if it's not flavored, it's usually fine. It's the flavored TVP.
[3:39:29.900 --> 3:39:33.900]  They tend to flavor it to make it like a chicken or a beef flavored TVP,
[3:39:33.900 --> 3:39:40.900]  and normally, many companies, when they do that, they introduce a lot of glutamic acid or various forms of MSG.
[3:39:40.900 --> 3:39:47.900]  Well, these foods direct says they do not use MSG, and I've got a bunch of it, and I haven't seen the MSG,
[3:39:47.900 --> 3:39:55.900]  but I'll be honest with you, it's also how the soybean is processed, but everything is in separate boxes from them.
[3:39:55.900 --> 3:39:59.900]  So just, I mean, if you're worried about vegetable protein, then just say,
[3:39:59.900 --> 3:40:04.900]  I don't want, you know, substitute that with something else. But I mean, soybeans from what I've seen,
[3:40:04.900 --> 3:40:09.900]  I want to see if Mike can curse. It's good if it's properly processed,
[3:40:09.900 --> 3:40:12.900]  and if they don't, process them with a pitch, correct?
[3:40:12.900 --> 3:40:15.900]  Yeah, that's absolutely right, and you got to remember what this is for.
[3:40:15.900 --> 3:40:22.900]  This is for long-term, storable, you know, survival food, and textured vegetable protein when it's non-flavored,
[3:40:22.900 --> 3:40:27.900]  stores easily for 10 years in a proper container, and it will keep you alive.
[3:40:27.900 --> 3:40:31.900]  It will give you protein, so it's good in that way. I wouldn't want to eat it every day.
[3:40:31.900 --> 3:40:35.900]  And you don't want to give it to little boys. You don't want to give it to little boys every day.
[3:40:35.900 --> 3:40:41.900]  Not my favorite food to eat every day, but again, we're talking about a preparedness context.
[3:40:41.900 --> 3:40:47.900]  But supposedly, soy improperly processed really has its worst effects on adolescence, correct?
[3:40:47.900 --> 3:40:49.900]  Because it interferes with the hormones.
[3:40:49.900 --> 3:40:55.900]  Yeah, that's right. It has hormone mimicers in it, but again, it all depends on the processing.
[3:40:55.900 --> 3:40:58.900]  It all depends on the source. So check out your sources.
[3:40:58.900 --> 3:41:02.900]  All plants have hormone mimicers because they have plant hormones, sterols.
[3:41:02.900 --> 3:41:09.900]  Yeah, that's right. It comes down to just being able to tell the difference between a quality source and a non-quality source.
[3:41:09.900 --> 3:41:12.900]  But you mentioned sprouts, and I got to say that is a great way.
[3:41:12.900 --> 3:41:17.900]  You can store sprouting seeds for a very long time, and you can get a sprouting machine.
[3:41:17.900 --> 3:41:21.900]  I think Green Life Sprouters, the top one that I use.
[3:41:21.900 --> 3:41:26.900]  So with a little bit of electricity, water, and some seeds, you can grow a superfood supplement.
[3:41:26.900 --> 3:41:32.900]  It's not going to cover all your food needs, but it's going to be a huge benefit to have something fresh and raw.
[3:41:32.900 --> 3:41:36.900]  You can have a tiny bag of the wheat seeds, and then pound for pound.
[3:41:36.900 --> 3:41:44.900]  I mean, isn't the wheatgrass the most nutrient-filled plant out there, or is that inaccurate?
[3:41:44.900 --> 3:41:46.900]  It can be. It depends on the minerals you feed it.
[3:41:46.900 --> 3:41:53.900]  You need to actually have some mineral salts in your preparedness kit so that you can soak that in some water
[3:41:53.900 --> 3:41:56.900]  and put some trace minerals into the seeds.
[3:41:56.900 --> 3:42:02.900]  That way, when you eat them, when they grow, they incorporate the trace minerals, and you get those when you eat them.
[3:42:02.900 --> 3:42:04.900]  So you want to grow it in mineral-rich water.
[3:42:04.900 --> 3:42:10.900]  Got it. Thank you, Chris. Sue is calling us from Georgia. You're on the air.
[3:42:10.900 --> 3:42:19.900]  Hey, guys. I'm calling to see if either of you have any suggestions to help stop smoking and drinking.
[3:42:19.900 --> 3:42:23.900]  And also, I have a family member suffering from painful gout.
[3:42:23.900 --> 3:42:30.900]  And is there anything you know of to avoid that causes the buildup of the uric acid and any remedies?
[3:42:30.900 --> 3:42:34.900]  Well, the government says that as humans, we don't have any free speech.
[3:42:34.900 --> 3:42:41.900]  And so we're not allowed to tell you that we heard orange juice is good for you, higher levels of vitamin C help with gout,
[3:42:41.900 --> 3:42:47.900]  because a lot of times, according to scientists and thousands of reports, gout and a lot of other things are associated with that,
[3:42:47.900 --> 3:42:49.900]  also with heavy metal buildup.
[3:42:49.900 --> 3:42:54.900]  Because in this free country, I'm not allowed to tell you what I heard was good because we're so free.
[3:42:54.900 --> 3:43:03.900]  But, I mean, I will break the New World Order's rules and say that I personally have heard that there are alternative things to that
[3:43:03.900 --> 3:43:06.900]  and that I am allowed to tell you I heard there's alternative things.
[3:43:06.900 --> 3:43:11.900]  I guess they, you know, instead of having their legs cut off or something like that, like the government might do,
[3:43:11.900 --> 3:43:15.900]  Mike, what have you heard is good for gout from all the nutritionists?
[3:43:15.900 --> 3:43:21.900]  Cherry concentrates and cherry extracts will eliminate gout in many, many cases.
[3:43:21.900 --> 3:43:24.900]  That's all kind of talking. Don't listen.
[3:43:24.900 --> 3:43:31.900]  Yep. I know. Cherries are part of our inventory of weapons that we use, right?
[3:43:31.900 --> 3:43:38.900]  Cherries, innocent little cherries, but they will eliminate gout and not in every case, but in most cases.
[3:43:38.900 --> 3:43:42.900]  And again, neither Alex nor I are offering you specific medical advice to you.
[3:43:42.900 --> 3:43:45.900]  Is that the vitamin C in there?
[3:43:45.900 --> 3:43:49.900]  But, I mean, cherries have a lot of other. I mean, like they make heart drugs out of cherry pits.
[3:43:49.900 --> 3:43:51.900]  I mean, what is in the cherry?
[3:43:51.900 --> 3:43:54.900]  Well, they contain anthocyanins in the cherry skin.
[3:43:54.900 --> 3:43:59.900]  They actually contain hundreds of different medicines. They're called phytochemicals.
[3:43:59.900 --> 3:44:02.900]  But the other thing I got to mention here is phytochemicals.
[3:44:02.900 --> 3:44:07.900]  Yeah, alkydochemicals. Stop drinking sodas.
[3:44:07.900 --> 3:44:12.900]  Sodas contain phosphoric acid. It's like battery acid, very powerful acid.
[3:44:12.900 --> 3:44:19.900]  That will cause gout. Most people who have gout or who have kidney stones are drinking a lot of phosphoric acid.
[3:44:19.900 --> 3:44:22.900]  That's right. Sodas, and my dad as a dentist has told me this,
[3:44:22.900 --> 3:44:30.900]  sodas, not the sugar that's attacking the teeth so much and the bacteria that then excrete acid, it's the acid in there.
[3:44:30.900 --> 3:44:34.900]  Literally, it's one of the few things that can weaken enamel and then your dentin.
[3:44:34.900 --> 3:44:37.900]  Yeah, that's exactly what happens.
[3:44:37.900 --> 3:44:42.900]  A lot of times, consumers, you've got to remember, you can't just ask for one magic pill
[3:44:42.900 --> 3:44:45.900]  that's going to solve all the problems caused by the other junk that you're eating.
[3:44:45.900 --> 3:44:49.900]  You've got to give up the sodas and then bring in something healthy at the same time.
[3:44:49.900 --> 3:44:53.900]  That's how you resolve the issue instead of just masking it.
[3:44:53.900 --> 3:44:55.900]  Some people just want to mask themselves.
[3:44:55.900 --> 3:45:01.900]  And now they have lots of healthy sodas and aren't really sodas that have natural fridges, low sugar in them,
[3:45:01.900 --> 3:45:07.900]  and then have the carbon dioxide to make them fizzy but don't have the acid, right, Mike?
[3:45:07.900 --> 3:45:12.900]  Yeah, that's true. And I think next year, the FDA is probably going to grass-approved stevia,
[3:45:12.900 --> 3:45:16.900]  so we'll have diet sodas that are sweetened with stevia instead of aspartame.
[3:45:16.900 --> 3:45:19.900]  That'll be a good move in the right direction.
[3:45:19.900 --> 3:45:22.900]  And an orange peel, I mean, aren't there...
[3:45:22.900 --> 3:45:26.900]  Orange peel has a nutrition sweetener, right?
[3:45:26.900 --> 3:45:32.900]  Yeah, there's a sweetener. I think it's called Just Like Sugar that's made from some citrus extracts.
[3:45:32.900 --> 3:45:35.900]  It's really good. But stevia is the big one on the horizon.
[3:45:35.900 --> 3:45:40.900]  It's natural. It's safe. I've been using it for 15 years, and the FDA may actually approve it.
[3:45:40.900 --> 3:45:45.900]  I mean, they've depressed it for at least a decade, in my opinion, to boost aspartame sales.
[3:45:45.900 --> 3:45:48.900]  But I think that monopoly is ending.
[3:45:48.900 --> 3:45:52.900]  Yeah, they're patent-ended recently. Okay, you know, anything else, Sue?
[3:45:52.900 --> 3:45:58.900]  Yeah, Peter, Alex, I think you used to smoke, or if you have any suggestions to help stop smoking or drinking?
[3:45:58.900 --> 3:46:03.900]  Yeah, just you have to do even more exercise. Stay away from people that smoke.
[3:46:03.900 --> 3:46:07.900]  I'm somebody who'll quit smoking for a year, start smoking for a month, and I can be at a party.
[3:46:07.900 --> 3:46:11.900]  The main thing is don't drink, because then it leads to you'll have a couple beers.
[3:46:11.900 --> 3:46:15.900]  Oh, give me a cigarette. I'll buy a pack. And then, boom, you're right back on.
[3:46:15.900 --> 3:46:18.900]  The biggest thing is you've got to get totally into fitness, totally into health.
[3:46:18.900 --> 3:46:21.900]  And I'm not saying I am, but I'm better than I was a few years ago.
[3:46:21.900 --> 3:46:26.900]  Or, I mean, it really is two extremes. Now, that's in my experience.
[3:46:26.900 --> 3:46:29.900]  Mike, this is a good time to talk about it, and I appreciate your call, Sue.
[3:46:29.900 --> 3:46:35.900]  How did you go from being an unhealthy blob like myself to being in super good shape like so many other, quote, health nuts?
[3:46:35.900 --> 3:46:40.900]  I mean, isn't it really, I'm guessing, you've got to become a nut, a health nut, or you're going to be a slob?
[3:46:40.900 --> 3:46:44.900]  I mean, there isn't a middle ground. I mean, obviously, we can do this in progression,
[3:46:44.900 --> 3:46:48.900]  but I found those that really do it and stick with it just become obsessed.
[3:46:48.900 --> 3:46:52.900]  Well, actually, I do want to emphasize that you can do it step by step. That's how I did it.
[3:46:52.900 --> 3:46:57.900]  And for people who are eating unhealthy foods or fried foods or whatever, junk foods,
[3:46:57.900 --> 3:47:04.900]  you can actually protect your health in a big way by drinking one glass of a super food every day,
[3:47:04.900 --> 3:47:06.900]  even without changing your diet.
[3:47:06.900 --> 3:47:11.900]  I mean, you can protect yourself with a super food product like living fuel or focus super food
[3:47:11.900 --> 3:47:14.900]  or any of those super food powders that have the greens in them.
[3:47:14.900 --> 3:47:17.900]  Because so much of it is you're not getting the real minerals from the crud food,
[3:47:17.900 --> 3:47:22.900]  but the real minerals and trace elements, they allow your body to then fight off the toxins.
[3:47:22.900 --> 3:47:27.900]  I mean, sure, I quit eating fast food, haven't had it in probably four or five years except,
[3:47:27.900 --> 3:47:32.900]  I think, once when I was on a road trip and my children were begging and hungry and I hadn't brought enough food.
[3:47:32.900 --> 3:47:38.900]  And then they felt bad after it and boy, I shouldn't have. But the point is quit the fast food.
[3:47:38.900 --> 3:47:42.900]  Start drinking filtered water. Start exercising. Just do that.
[3:47:42.900 --> 3:47:47.900]  And if you're eating junk food or fast food, you could actually defend yourself.
[3:47:47.900 --> 3:47:53.900]  For example, if you're eating seafood and you know there's mercury in it, if you take cilantro or chlorella,
[3:47:53.900 --> 3:47:58.900]  at the same time, the chlorella or cilantro will bind with the heavy metals
[3:47:58.900 --> 3:48:00.900]  and prevent your body from absorbing them.
[3:48:00.900 --> 3:48:05.900]  So any time before you eat seafood, eat some cilantro, fresh cilantro, or take some chlorella.
[3:48:05.900 --> 3:48:06.900]  You're going to protect yourself.
[3:48:06.900 --> 3:48:11.900]  But I was about to say that Japanese live longer than anybody, even some of the folks in one little area of Italy that live,
[3:48:11.900 --> 3:48:16.900]  you know, routinely to 110 and they're at something like 85.
[3:48:16.900 --> 3:48:22.900]  When there's mercury in seafood, most of it's bound up with the food and goes through anyways.
[3:48:22.900 --> 3:48:28.900]  What's really bad is the environmental mercury that is unnaturally out there because it's not bound.
[3:48:28.900 --> 3:48:31.900]  Like the mercury fillings, exactly.
[3:48:31.900 --> 3:48:36.900]  And if any of you out there, if you get your mercury fillings taken out and I had that done several years ago,
[3:48:36.900 --> 3:48:41.900]  be sure to work with a dentist who knows what they're doing because when they're drilling on those fillings,
[3:48:41.900 --> 3:48:45.900]  they're creating mercury vapor that you will inhale.
[3:48:45.900 --> 3:48:50.900]  You have to be on an oxygen mask when you get those removed, otherwise you're going to poison yourself.
[3:48:50.900 --> 3:48:53.900]  And going further, I didn't finish the story I never do.
[3:48:53.900 --> 3:48:58.900]  My point is the Japanese eat more mercury in fish than anybody and they're living longer than anybody.
[3:48:58.900 --> 3:49:04.900]  So, you know, now I mean, sure, the bigger fish, you might want to stay away from those.
[3:49:04.900 --> 3:49:08.900]  The bluefin tuna and stuff like that because they're top of the food chain.
[3:49:08.900 --> 3:49:15.900]  Yeah, the Japanese have so much seaweed in their diet and the seaweed contains so many anti-cancer nutrients.
[3:49:15.900 --> 3:49:19.900]  It's just phenomenal and it also binds with heavy metals.
[3:49:19.900 --> 3:49:23.900]  And so, when you combine those two, you can actually eat in a safer way,
[3:49:23.900 --> 3:49:26.900]  even though you might be exposed to some dietary contaminants.
[3:49:26.900 --> 3:49:28.900]  I'm not recommending that you eat mercury.
[3:49:28.900 --> 3:49:33.900]  Well, I've done the studies with the French, not just, you know, red wine, but the mushrooms and things they eat.
[3:49:33.900 --> 3:49:38.900]  Smoking two packs of cigarettes, drinking hard, and they live on average seven years longer than Americans.
[3:49:38.900 --> 3:49:41.900]  Yep. Yep, it's the red wine, the resveratrol in the wine.
[3:49:41.900 --> 3:49:45.900]  Amazing. Drug companies are trying to turn that into a drug.
[3:49:45.900 --> 3:49:53.900]  They probably will very soon and they'll sell it to you at $100 a bottle when you can buy the supplement, you know, for $12 a bottle.
[3:49:53.900 --> 3:49:58.900]  Yeah, that's a big excuse. I'm going to go get some red wine. It's good for me.
[3:49:58.900 --> 3:50:08.900]  Yeah, let's go ahead and talk to Larry in New York and then Francesca and Clint. Go ahead, Larry.
[3:50:08.900 --> 3:50:09.900]  Hello.
[3:50:09.900 --> 3:50:10.900]  Yes, sir.
[3:50:10.900 --> 3:50:11.900]  Hi, how are you?
[3:50:11.900 --> 3:50:12.900]  Good.
[3:50:12.900 --> 3:50:17.900]  I just want to thank you for setting off the proverbial alarm clock. I think it's great what you're doing.
[3:50:17.900 --> 3:50:22.900]  But can I ask you just a question blindly and I'll explain the reason why I'm asking.
[3:50:22.900 --> 3:50:23.900]  Sure.
[3:50:23.900 --> 3:50:30.900]  If you had the choice to live in Philadelphia or Lando, New York, or Santo Domingo, where would you live?
[3:50:30.900 --> 3:50:32.900]  Santo Domingo, where?
[3:50:32.900 --> 3:50:34.900]  In Dominican Republic.
[3:50:34.900 --> 3:50:37.900]  That's what I thought. I think there's two or three of those.
[3:50:37.900 --> 3:50:47.900]  Dominican Republic. Man, you know, you can never know and there's so many. Where are you currently living?
[3:50:47.900 --> 3:50:49.900]  New York City.
[3:50:49.900 --> 3:50:51.900]  And was that in the list of where you should live?
[3:50:51.900 --> 3:51:01.900]  No, well, I'm living in New York and my wife, me and my wife, you know, between both of our families, we have properties in Santo Domingo, Philadelphia, and Orlando.
[3:51:01.900 --> 3:51:12.900]  My concern is, with everything that's going on with the economy, I would think that I'm best suited to stay in New York only because of the fact that I could probably find more work.
[3:51:12.900 --> 3:51:16.900]  I mean, I'm currently working, but it seems like New York is such a target for everything.
[3:51:16.900 --> 3:51:23.900]  Well, if stuff goes to hell in a handbasket in New York, one of the worst places to be, it's one of the main terror targets for a false flag.
[3:51:23.900 --> 3:51:32.900]  And you know, a Dominican Republic is constantly having problems. It's right next door to Haiti, all that piracy.
[3:51:32.900 --> 3:51:43.900]  The third world's going to collapse as well. I would say Orlando's pretty darn bad as well, but I'd probably say of all those choices, Florida.
[3:51:43.900 --> 3:51:45.900]  What do you say, Mike?
[3:51:45.900 --> 3:51:51.900]  Yeah, I think Florida allows you to grow some of your own food and that might be really important to think about climate.
[3:51:51.900 --> 3:51:55.900]  Absolutely. We'll come back, take more calls. Got to jump.
[3:51:55.900 --> 3:51:59.900]  When you're out driving this holiday season, keep in mind you're being watched.
[3:51:59.900 --> 3:52:05.900]  Whether you know it or not, red light and speed cameras are everywhere ready to snap a photo of your license plate.
[3:52:05.900 --> 3:52:12.900]  One simple, harmless error could end up costing you over $500 quickly putting an end to your holiday cheer.
[3:52:12.900 --> 3:52:17.900]  Fight back with Photo Blocker. Simply spray your plate once and you're done.
[3:52:17.900 --> 3:52:22.900]  Any photos of your license plate will appear overexposed, making them virtually unreadable.
[3:52:22.900 --> 3:52:26.900]  See the newscast showing just how Photo Blocker works against traffic cameras.
[3:52:26.900 --> 3:52:36.900]  Christmas is here and the economy is in bad enough shape without spending hundreds of dollars in fees that can be avoided with one simple application of Photo Blocker.
[3:52:36.900 --> 3:52:49.900]  Go to sprayyourplate.com. That's sprayyourplate.com or call 1-800-276-9601. That's 1-800-276-9601.
[3:52:49.900 --> 3:52:55.900]  Don't give your money to the state. Spray your plate and when the cameras flash, you'll save some cash.
[3:52:55.900 --> 3:53:01.900]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[3:53:01.900 --> 3:53:06.900]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[3:53:06.900 --> 3:53:12.900]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[3:53:12.900 --> 3:53:16.900]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[3:55:15.900 --> 3:55:26.900]  I woke up about, I would say, in January, you know, last January, when things started really tightening up around the natural health industry, I'm a retailer out in central Canada.
[3:55:26.900 --> 3:55:35.900]  And, I mean, we always grew up, you know, eating food straight from scratch. My parents are from the deep south, in Italy, my father's from April.
[3:55:35.900 --> 3:55:37.900]  They need to go to a FEMA camp. That's evil.
[3:55:37.900 --> 3:55:48.900]  Yeah, that's right. Well, you know what? They saw World War II. They saw exactly what happened. They were thrown into schools and they were taught all about how they were the superior race.
[3:55:48.900 --> 3:56:00.900]  And, you know, Mussolini worked very closely with Hitler at the time, so they were very aware of the manipulation that humans cannot, you know, employ on other human beings.
[3:56:00.900 --> 3:56:09.900]  And, three of my sisters are scientists. So, here I am, only in a natural health food store. And, you know, really, you know, caring for my customers.
[3:56:09.900 --> 3:56:16.900]  They have my trust. I have their trust. And, we work together on, you know, certain health issues that they're having.
[3:56:16.900 --> 3:56:23.900]  Then, when the big crunch on the natural health industry came along and really strong in the spring of this year,
[3:56:23.900 --> 3:56:34.900]  already being aware and, you know, watching Endgame and reading Mike's website, it started really, really a catalyst.
[3:56:34.900 --> 3:56:41.900]  It was a catalyst in my life. And, I started working with customers, letting them know one by one that they came through the cash.
[3:56:41.900 --> 3:56:44.900]  And, so what happened? We're almost out of time. So, you're warning people.
[3:56:44.900 --> 3:56:54.900]  Yeah, I think one of the most important things that needs to be regulated is basically the counter-indications between natural health products and drugs.
[3:56:54.900 --> 3:56:58.900]  That is it. You do not regulate natural health products. You have to educate.
[3:56:58.900 --> 3:57:04.900]  Government has to educate their citizens on the counter-indications.
[3:57:04.900 --> 3:57:10.900]  If they're taking a drug, what natural health product, you know, should they avoid at that time? And so on.
[3:57:10.900 --> 3:57:19.900]  And that's up to them because they're the ones pushing the drugs on them. I mean, all you're doing is selling basically a food product or a mineral, something from the earth.
[3:57:19.900 --> 3:57:23.900]  And, you know, so that's the bottom line there. We're almost out of time. Mike, you want to comment on that?
[3:57:23.900 --> 3:57:29.900]  Yeah, the doctors, the conventional medical industry always says that these herbs are interfering with the drugs.
[3:57:29.900 --> 3:57:34.900]  Well, I think they've got it backwards. The drugs are interfering with normal human metabolism.
[3:57:34.900 --> 3:57:39.900]  The drugs are interfering with basic human physiology. The drugs are the problem.
[3:57:39.900 --> 3:57:46.900]  Well, the feds admit 300,000 people in the U.S. die here alone from bad drug interactions with their drugs, and they don't even care.
[3:57:46.900 --> 3:57:53.900]  And then there may be a few deaths from a fedrin or something. You know, people getting, you know, something over the counter to get speed up.
[3:57:53.900 --> 3:57:57.900]  I mean, they can go buy something at the store to do that. They can go huff paint.
[3:57:57.900 --> 3:58:06.900]  You don't use this as an excuse to shut down people's access. Let's cram in real fast. Clint in Texas, real fast with our guest.
[3:58:06.900 --> 3:58:15.900]  Yes, I was wanting to know what Mike may have come across in his years about dealing with multiple sclerosis.
[3:58:15.900 --> 3:58:18.900]  And I'll listen offline.
[3:58:18.900 --> 3:58:27.900]  A lot of that's tied to heavy metals and things in utero. And then after as well, a lot of it can be slowed, but a lot of the damage is irrevocable to the brain.
[3:58:27.900 --> 3:58:28.900]  Mike?
[3:58:28.900 --> 3:58:36.900]  Yeah, yeah, MS, very heavy neurological damage. A lot of it is caused by prenatal contamination or prenatal nutrition issues.
[3:58:36.900 --> 3:58:42.900]  That is one condition that is not terrible once it's progressed to a certain degree, but you can prevent it.
[3:58:42.900 --> 3:58:48.900]  And it comes down to, I think, stopping this chemical contamination of expectant mothers.
[3:58:48.900 --> 3:58:52.900]  Mothers, these pregnant women shouldn't be on vaccines. They shouldn't be on psychiatric drugs.
[3:58:52.900 --> 3:58:57.900]  They should be on wholesome natural foods and great nutrition. That's how you make healthy babies.
[3:58:57.900 --> 3:59:00.900]  I mean, they don't need melamine and mercury. That's good for you.
[3:59:00.900 --> 3:59:01.900]  Yeah, go figure.
[3:59:01.900 --> 3:59:10.900]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, healthranger.com, naturalnews.com. Great to have you up with us. Thanks for spending this much time with us, my friend.

[3:59:19.900 --> 3:59:20.900]  All right, we'll be in touch on that.
