[00:00.000 --> 00:13.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.920 --> 00:22.760]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:22.760 --> 00:29.760]  well it took him 10 years to ram it through in fact 10 years ago the
[00:29.760 --> 00:34.160]  mainstream media said it didn't exist now they admit it merges the north
[00:34.160 --> 00:39.640]  american union and the european union with the asian union it's the tpp it's
[00:39.640 --> 00:43.600]  already been ratified by secret corporate groups u.s. polls showed that
[00:43.600 --> 00:49.240]  upwards of 90% of americans were against it congress wasn't even allowed to read
[00:49.240 --> 00:54.400]  it but one page at a time in a secret room and after it was voted down
[00:54.400 --> 01:00.080]  repeatedly in the house it finally passed earlier this week and today just
[01:00.080 --> 01:05.320]  minutes ago it passed the senate and the media spun it like it was a victory for
[01:05.320 --> 01:11.280]  obama and his legacy his legacy like it's a football game like the new england
[01:11.280 --> 01:17.320]  patriots won something this is in the 240 year history of this country the
[01:17.320 --> 01:22.840]  biggest blow to our sovereignty ever we've got three sections of it that have
[01:22.840 --> 01:28.480]  been leaked by wiki leaks another 25 or secret those three sections alone make
[01:28.480 --> 01:34.480]  the president a dictator congress has no legislative control over borders over
[01:34.480 --> 01:41.720]  trade over finances over currency it is truly mind-blowing and congress is so
[01:41.720 --> 01:47.240]  blackmailed so controlled it was rammed through to the democrats credit a lot of
[01:47.240 --> 01:50.320]  them in the house the senate voted against it and along with the tea party
[01:50.320 --> 01:54.640]  but the republican establishment democratic establishment combined forces
[01:54.640 --> 01:58.440]  yet again against the american people look in the past armies
[01:58.440 --> 02:02.960]  concord nations now it's these corporate boards it's all through fraud we can
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.280]  expect to be looted we can expect to have our laws made in secret just like
[02:07.280 --> 02:12.600]  the people of the european union this is a very sad day for america it's so
[02:12.600 --> 02:18.000]  surreal it's so breathtaking i have trouble myself believing it happened i
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  was so excited last week when there was incredible pressure on the house and
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.920]  they voted it down but obama traveled to the hill twisted arms and got a bunch
[02:27.920 --> 02:33.160]  of democrats to go over to him they use the whole confederate battle flag
[02:33.160 --> 02:38.520]  diversion as a way to get people obsessed on that and we took a hook line
[02:38.520 --> 02:44.840]  and sinker now is the fight to try to stop them from fully implementing it but
[02:44.840 --> 02:47.400]  the whole thing secret and perpetuity so how do you fight something that's
[02:47.400 --> 02:51.720]  invisible it's stealth that's what the north american union documents talked
[02:51.720 --> 02:56.600]  about that got released by judicial watch when they sued back in 2007 was
[02:56.600 --> 03:00.600]  that it's north american integration by stealth that they would then integrate
[03:00.600 --> 03:04.480]  north america with the other unions by stealth as well that's in the document i
[03:04.480 --> 03:07.840]  covered my film in game blueprint for global enslavement will be on the radio
[03:07.840 --> 03:12.400]  tomorrow 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. talking about this issue but understand the bottom's
[03:12.400 --> 03:18.680]  now falling out the government's gone full-territy and nothing is stopping them
[03:18.680 --> 03:23.040]  now because of the blackmail the insider trading whatever it is katie bar the
[03:23.040 --> 03:28.080]  door all over the world governments are pledging their support to the big six
[03:28.080 --> 03:32.800]  megabanks and we are headed towards world government the pope is called for
[03:32.800 --> 03:37.040]  global government everybody's calling for one of the establishment it is a
[03:37.040 --> 03:41.760]  unified front left right and center to bring in an unelected secretive
[03:41.760 --> 03:45.360]  planetary corporate government we have been conquered by golden sacks and jp
[03:45.360 --> 03:49.360]  morgan and the bank of england this country that was somewhat free since our
[03:49.360 --> 03:53.520]  revolution of 1776 wasn't perfect but became the apple of the world's eye
[03:53.520 --> 03:57.600]  because we had more freedom than others has now sunk into the mud
[03:57.600 --> 04:02.400]  and this is a devastating blow while we were busy complaining about confederate
[04:02.400 --> 04:09.360]  flags and sex changes for jenner while we were busy in trance by the television
[04:09.360 --> 04:14.000]  our country was stolen as thomas everson warned if private central banks are
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.720]  ever allowed to issue the currency our grandchildren will wake up homeless on
[04:18.720 --> 04:22.800]  the continent our forebearers conquered i'm alex jones from the front lines of
[04:22.800 --> 04:27.480]  the info war the tyranny is just starting but humanity fighting back has
[04:27.480 --> 04:32.040]  just begun all right that's alex jones that's a recorded message that you can
[04:32.040 --> 04:37.080]  see on youtube as well as the info wars channel we're going to be talking more
[04:37.080 --> 04:41.240]  about what this means when we come back we're also going to be talking about the
[04:41.240 --> 04:46.280]  new supreme court decision on obama care we've got obama trade we've got

[04:49.320 --> 04:57.320]  when we get back
[04:57.320 --> 05:04.600]  if fast track passes today secret trade treaties with asian and european
[05:04.600 --> 05:09.320]  nations will be unstoppable as senator sessions who has done more than anyone
[05:09.320 --> 05:14.840]  else to expose the secret asian treaty has said it is a breathtaking event
[05:14.840 --> 05:20.760]  basically the same language used to start the european union this is not a
[05:20.760 --> 05:25.960]  trade deal it is a deal made by traders who are putting not just our economy
[05:25.960 --> 05:31.000]  but our food our medicine our internet our sovereignty and the hands of
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.960]  multinational corporations and a transnational committee why do we have
[05:35.960 --> 05:41.960]  to create a transnational union it will be a living agreement with powers to
[05:41.960 --> 05:47.080]  discipline and set rules outside the powers of the united states congress some

[08:24.760 --> 08:28.040]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today is
[08:28.040 --> 08:31.240]  alex pointed out in the clip that we played in the first
[08:31.240 --> 08:37.400]  segment the tpa has passed it passed a yesterday evening of course they knew
[08:37.400 --> 08:40.600]  that was going to pass they had it worked out on the senate schedule they
[08:40.600 --> 08:43.480]  said that uh they were going to hold the vote at five
[08:43.480 --> 08:48.440]  thirty three p.m not five thirty five thirty three p.m
[08:48.440 --> 08:51.720]  they've had a very detailed playbook to get this through
[08:51.720 --> 08:55.240]  they've managed to distract the public the public just isn't interested they've
[08:55.240 --> 08:59.240]  got too many entertainment issues that are out there too many
[08:59.240 --> 09:04.120]  things like racism the charges that are going on and there's real racism we need
[09:04.120 --> 09:06.600]  to talk about it but what's going on with the
[09:06.600 --> 09:10.280]  confederate flag we're going to talk about that later in the show as well but
[09:10.280 --> 09:14.440]  they've managed to keep people distracted uh while this is going through
[09:14.440 --> 09:18.040]  they had this precisely planned as to what they were going to do the vote the
[09:18.040 --> 09:22.440]  day before was to shut cloture to make sure there wasn't going to be
[09:22.440 --> 09:26.120]  any debate there wasn't going to be any filibuster
[09:26.120 --> 09:29.320]  going on with this this is what's happened the entire way
[09:29.320 --> 09:33.480]  through everything that the senate and the house have done
[09:33.480 --> 09:37.880]  is to accelerate the process and so we see this thing
[09:37.880 --> 09:41.880]  and it's actually america that's going downhill like some kind of a soapbox
[09:41.880 --> 09:45.320]  derby where the gravity is gradually picking up
[09:45.320 --> 09:49.880]  we're gradually accelerating every single step of this has been to accelerate it
[09:49.880 --> 09:54.920]  now they have still not passed the TPP or the TTIP or any of these
[09:54.920 --> 09:59.560]  other traps that they're working on they haven't passed those yet
[09:59.560 --> 10:03.240]  but as this thing picks up momentum it is going to be
[10:03.240 --> 10:07.080]  increasingly hard because of the inertia of this
[10:07.080 --> 10:10.280]  to try to turn this thing around to stop it because everything about this
[10:10.280 --> 10:14.360]  trade promotion fast track bill was set up to make sure that it could not be
[10:14.360 --> 10:17.400]  stopped that was the design of it the fundamental lie
[10:17.400 --> 10:21.400]  at the bottom of all this was that it was not a treaty because a treaty would
[10:21.400 --> 10:24.520]  require 67 votes in the senate the house would
[10:24.520 --> 10:27.640]  not even be involved in that that's the process
[10:27.640 --> 10:32.360]  but they did it anyway they conveniently ignore that it's a treaty
[10:32.360 --> 10:35.960]  senator sessions who looked at this said it is a treaty he pointed out a lot of
[10:35.960 --> 10:37.480]  things that are going to be problems with it
[10:37.480 --> 10:42.040]  now the TPP is hidden the TTIP is hidden we've had some leaks of those we know
[10:42.040 --> 10:45.080]  precisely however what is in this trade promotion
[10:45.080 --> 10:48.200]  authority this fast track process that they've run through
[10:48.200 --> 10:50.440]  some of the issues that they're going to do with this now they're not going
[10:50.440 --> 10:53.960]  whatever they've got this treaty that they've been working on in secret with
[10:53.960 --> 10:57.560]  corporate lobbyists for years when they're done with that
[10:57.560 --> 11:01.800]  they're going to bring it to the to the legislative bodies
[11:01.800 --> 11:05.640]  and they're going to say we're not going to go through the usual process
[11:05.640 --> 11:09.320]  typically a bill remember schoolhouse rocks they talked
[11:09.320 --> 11:12.360]  about how bill becomes a law you know you take it to a committee
[11:12.360 --> 11:15.240]  the committee takes a look at it they recommend it to the floor for a vote the
[11:15.240 --> 11:18.920]  leader recommends it to the floor for a vote no none of that
[11:18.920 --> 11:22.920]  the fast track authority says that once they present us with this document or
[11:22.920 --> 11:27.400]  present the congress with the document they will take it immediately to the
[11:27.400 --> 11:30.840]  they'll take it to the floor no less than 45 days they can take it sooner
[11:30.840 --> 11:34.520]  but no more than 45 days it doesn't have to go through the committee
[11:34.520 --> 11:37.800]  it doesn't have to go through the leader they can accelerate the process but they
[11:37.800 --> 11:41.240]  cannot slow it down once it goes to the floor
[11:41.240 --> 11:45.160]  there will be no filibuster by the senate there will be
[11:45.160 --> 11:51.880]  debate but limited to 20 hours 20 hours no more than 20 hours
[11:51.880 --> 11:55.320]  there will be no amendments made to it by
[11:55.320 --> 11:59.400]  the legislative bodies our representatives theoretically
[11:59.400 --> 12:03.800]  who had nothing to do with writing it they will not be able to amend it
[12:03.800 --> 12:08.120]  once it is passed however as senator sessions has pointed out
[12:08.120 --> 12:15.240]  it will be infinitely malleable there will be a transnational
[12:15.240 --> 12:20.440]  council committee that is part of these trade agreements
[12:20.440 --> 12:25.000]  these trade treaties they will be able to amend it they will be able to add
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.080]  china to it if they wish because that's important because it was sold to us
[12:29.080 --> 12:32.600]  as a check against chinese power we needed to
[12:32.600 --> 12:38.600]  make common markets with these asian economies so that we could have a
[12:38.600 --> 12:42.120]  counterbalance to china look they don't want to counterbalance to china
[12:42.120 --> 12:45.080]  they'll bring china in china is going to continue
[12:45.080 --> 12:48.760]  selling their slave goods to walmart of course they won't be making
[12:48.760 --> 12:52.440]  confederate flags i guess anymore in china but they will still use their
[12:52.440 --> 12:56.600]  slaves china walmart will be able to disavow
[12:56.600 --> 13:00.600]  any outright ownership of the slaves they don't have to take care of them they
[13:00.600 --> 13:03.320]  evidently don't have to take responsibility for them
[13:03.320 --> 13:06.520]  they'll bring them in and you'll buy their slave goods because they have run
[13:06.520 --> 13:10.440]  all the mom and pop stores out of business across the country
[13:10.440 --> 13:13.320]  but uh this is going to be a situation once these
[13:13.320 --> 13:17.800]  these trade partnerships they used to call them agreements
[13:17.800 --> 13:21.240]  until they passed them you know when they passed nafta nafta was a trade
[13:21.240 --> 13:25.880]  agreement but once they passed it it became a treaty
[13:25.880 --> 13:28.920]  when you look at these investor state arbitration processes that are
[13:28.920 --> 13:32.680]  established by these multinational economic
[13:32.680 --> 13:36.440]  treaties that they're putting through and we have those already in place we have
[13:36.440 --> 13:39.880]  those in place in the european union we have them in place in nafta it's not a
[13:39.880 --> 13:43.480]  theory as to how this is going to play out we've seen how it plays out
[13:43.480 --> 13:47.080]  they elevate the multinational corporations to the level of government
[13:47.080 --> 13:50.360]  i would say higher than the level of government we can look at how one of
[13:50.360 --> 13:53.400]  these is playing out right now in australia for example
[13:53.400 --> 13:57.160]  they passed some legislation that put some pretty strong warnings on cigarette
[13:57.160 --> 14:02.520]  packages so strong in fact that the sales of big tobacco in australia
[14:02.520 --> 14:06.360]  took a big hit so they went to one of these investor state arbitration
[14:06.360 --> 14:10.840]  processes and said look your new labels are costing us
[14:10.840 --> 14:16.200]  sales so we demand payment in this arbitration process of billions of
[14:16.200 --> 14:19.160]  dollars from the taxpayers that's always going to work out with gmo
[14:19.160 --> 14:22.680]  labeling we're going to have anthony gucciardi talk about the implications of
[14:22.680 --> 14:26.120]  that at the fundamental level this is about
[14:26.120 --> 14:30.280]  corporations forcing us to buy their products
[14:30.280 --> 14:33.080]  that's one level of it of course the other level of it
[14:33.080 --> 14:37.640]  is the loss of jobs that we've seen how these things work out with nafta
[14:37.640 --> 14:41.240]  that's one aspect of it but it's also them holding a gun to our heads and
[14:41.240 --> 14:45.320]  saying you're going to continue to buy my gmo products you can't ban
[14:45.320 --> 14:48.840]  those you can't even label them because that would hurt my sales
[14:48.840 --> 14:52.760]  and if you do that you're just going to pay me billions and billions of dollars
[14:52.760 --> 14:57.000]  in penalties so our legislators will kind of back down on that
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.600]  you know we support our operation here without holding
[15:00.600 --> 15:04.760]  a gun to your head uh actually we'll talk about these buckles
[15:04.760 --> 15:08.360]  you can hold a gun to your belly how's that you can put it on a belt buckle and
[15:08.360 --> 15:10.760]  we've got a special going on right now with the uh
[15:10.760 --> 15:15.320]  malon lava silver belt buckles as well as uh the m16
[15:15.320 --> 15:18.760]  the two different designs you can look at they are normally $50 they're
[15:18.760 --> 15:23.400]  limited runs they're on sale right now for $20 and um
[15:23.400 --> 15:26.920]  this is a these are a couple designs that alex jones put together
[15:26.920 --> 15:30.920]  i guess it's still allowed that we can use uh greek symbols
[15:30.920 --> 15:35.160]  against tyranny we can't use southern symbols against tyranny but i guess
[15:35.160 --> 15:39.640]  greek is still allowed and you can still put pictures of guns on your stomach
[15:39.640 --> 15:42.920]  and you can uh your your belt buckle and so you can talk to other people about
[15:42.920 --> 15:45.880]  that uh it's a good way to support our operation
[15:45.880 --> 15:48.760]  and that's a good way to get conversation going out there plus they look
[15:48.760 --> 15:52.040]  really good and you can get them as i pointed out for $20
[15:52.040 --> 15:56.520]  off it's limited run 500 of one of them and 700 of the other they are
[15:56.520 --> 16:01.560]  numbered on the back as well as with the made in 1776 logo
[16:01.560 --> 16:06.760]  but that's not the way the multinational corporations operate
[16:06.760 --> 16:10.520]  we can see this in the supreme court decision today with obama care of course
[16:10.520 --> 16:14.680]  obama care fundamentally was about using the power of government to hold a gun to
[16:14.680 --> 16:18.040]  your head and mandate that you buy their services
[16:18.040 --> 16:21.480]  now the first time this came through roberts wrote
[16:21.480 --> 16:25.080]  both opinions very interesting wasn't it i've mentioned many times many other
[16:25.080 --> 16:27.960]  people have said it as well we believe many of us
[16:27.960 --> 16:32.440]  and i'm one of them believe that roberts was blackmail to do that that's a
[16:32.440 --> 16:36.040]  very unusual move first he wrote an opinion saying no
[16:36.040 --> 16:39.720]  you can't have obama care because the government can't force you to buy
[16:39.720 --> 16:43.800]  products of private companies then he came back and said no never mind
[16:43.800 --> 16:47.720]  it's a tax so he wrote both the dissenting and the
[16:47.720 --> 16:54.040]  prevailing opinion in that the idea being that it is not a tax if you're
[16:54.040 --> 16:57.880]  paying the money to a corporation what they did was they said buy this
[16:57.880 --> 17:01.480]  insurance in the way that we are dictating it
[17:01.480 --> 17:05.880]  or you will have to pay a penalty to us but that's not a tax attacks would be
[17:05.880 --> 17:09.560]  money that you paid directly to the government so
[17:09.560 --> 17:13.960]  they play games with the language they malleate it's very malleable as far as
[17:13.960 --> 17:16.680]  they're concerned it's just like they call these treaties
[17:16.680 --> 17:21.800]  trade agreements or they call them partnerships but once they pass them
[17:21.800 --> 17:26.760]  when they go to these arbitration processes like i was just describing
[17:26.760 --> 17:30.680]  they have the lawyers who specialize in this say that their specialty is
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.160]  treaty law not trade agreement law treaty law
[17:35.160 --> 17:37.960]  and they talk about these arbitration processes as being
[17:37.960 --> 17:43.160]  treaty claim you see a treaty is an agreement between one or more nations
[17:43.160 --> 17:46.520]  about commerce about peace about a variety of issues
[17:46.520 --> 17:52.440]  this is a treaty it should have been voted on by 67 people in the senate so
[17:52.440 --> 17:57.160]  they have played these pervericating games these nonsense games to even get
[17:57.160 --> 17:59.960]  it to the point where we are now so it's not a good sign
[17:59.960 --> 18:03.400]  what it is a sign of is that these guys are willing to
[18:03.400 --> 18:06.680]  lie to the public they're willing to do anything for their corporate masters
[18:06.680 --> 18:10.440]  why haven't they bothered to look at this secret trade agreement
[18:10.440 --> 18:15.720]  they don't need to they've been told by the people who control them by the
[18:15.720 --> 18:18.520]  people that they work for and it's not you
[18:18.520 --> 18:23.000]  they don't work for you they don't listen to you they're not responsible to you
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.120]  these people are the ones who send them the money these people are the ones
[18:26.120 --> 18:30.120]  who keep them in power and so they've been told how to vote
[18:30.120 --> 18:34.440]  they don't need to read this they could care less what it says they're just
[18:34.440 --> 18:38.840]  doing what they're told right Bart says Marco Rubio cast a
[18:38.840 --> 18:41.400]  deciding vote for obama trade without even reading it
[18:41.400 --> 18:45.000]  guess what it was 60 votes that they did to shut
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.400]  cloture it was 60 votes to pass the trade promotion authority now
[18:49.400 --> 18:53.240]  the trade bill has actually not passed but again
[18:53.240 --> 18:56.760]  it's going to be very very hard to stop it so that's why many people just take
[18:56.760 --> 19:00.040]  it to the next step and talk about it as if it had passed
[19:00.040 --> 19:04.200]  we need to understand that it has not passed we need to understand they still
[19:04.200 --> 19:08.760]  have not voted in the tpp or the ttip the transatlantic or the
[19:08.760 --> 19:12.520]  trans-pacific uh treaties and we need to put
[19:12.520 --> 19:16.600]  all the pressure we can on these people of course Marco Rubio cast the deciding
[19:16.600 --> 19:20.600]  vote 60 was exactly what they needed every one of
[19:20.600 --> 19:24.520]  the senators who voted for this cast the deciding vote
[19:24.520 --> 19:28.840]  and i have to say the first time it came through we're very critical of Ted Cruz
[19:28.840 --> 19:33.320]  yeah i think he heard that pushback he pretended his explanation was phony
[19:33.320 --> 19:37.160]  but at least he did the right thing at least he'd listened to the people at
[19:37.160 --> 19:40.200]  least he changed his vote we don't want to throw him under the bus
[19:40.200 --> 19:45.720]  too hard too far because we need 10 or 11 more like that to stop this at the
[19:45.720 --> 19:57.160]  next level stay with us we're going to be right back
[19:57.160 --> 20:05.080]  it's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader

[22:10.040 --> 22:12.280]  wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing
[22:12.280 --> 22:15.560]  oh i didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing
[22:15.560 --> 22:19.160]  what is that well apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being
[22:19.160 --> 22:22.600]  issued have radio chips inside them called rfid
[22:22.600 --> 22:25.880]  the transmitter banking information to card readers when we pay
[22:25.880 --> 22:29.560]  unfortunately a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the

[24:15.160 --> 24:19.000]  joined in the next segment anthony good shardy he's gonna talk about
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.040]  one of the many aspects of this trans-specific partnership trans at
[24:24.040 --> 24:27.560]  lantic partnership these trade bills they call them that are
[24:27.560 --> 24:30.280]  being run through but they're about a lot more than that
[24:30.280 --> 24:34.840]  it's not really obama trade it's really monsanto trade it's really
[24:34.840 --> 24:38.120]  murk trade it's really goldman sacks trade because
[24:38.120 --> 24:43.000]  those are the corporations that wrote it it's just that obama and mitch mcconnell
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.880]  the leadership of the both parties who do exactly as they're told they're just
[24:47.880 --> 24:52.600]  ramming this through for those people and he's been given dictatorial powers
[24:52.600 --> 24:57.480]  of course the u.s trade representative has been given the power to
[24:57.480 --> 25:01.240]  rewrite our economy essentially because there's so many different things that
[25:01.240 --> 25:05.080]  aren't even based on trade and economics it would be bad enough
[25:05.080 --> 25:10.200]  if that was all it was i would oppose it just on that basis alone looking at
[25:10.200 --> 25:13.400]  what's happened with nafta but just as we've seen with nafta you're
[25:13.400 --> 25:18.360]  wondering why the borders are open maybe you didn't see the secret memos
[25:18.360 --> 25:22.760]  about what's going on with the north american union or listen to david
[25:22.760 --> 25:26.840]  patreus saying what comes after america it's easy north america we're 20 years
[25:26.840 --> 25:31.480]  into nafta they're rolling this out not just as an economic
[25:31.480 --> 25:34.360]  screw job it's not just that they're exporting your
[25:34.360 --> 25:39.320]  jobs importing workers no it's far worse than that
[25:39.320 --> 25:43.000]  they are consolidating the different groups the different
[25:43.000 --> 25:49.000]  nations into economic trade blocks once they do that then they start to push
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.400]  for political union senator sessions who's looked at these new bills and they
[25:53.400 --> 25:56.680]  may be more explicit maybe on a faster track as i pointed out
[25:56.680 --> 25:59.640]  earlier this is something that is accelerating
[25:59.640 --> 26:02.760]  just like a soapbox racer going down the hill
[26:02.760 --> 26:07.800]  it is going faster and faster they're going to put these things together in
[26:07.800 --> 26:11.080]  the economic situation as well as what we're seeing going on with greece and
[26:11.080 --> 26:15.080]  others right now in the european union we've got a lot of people in the european
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.160]  union not happy about what they're seeing with this the economics of it are
[26:19.160 --> 26:24.840]  awful it has been an economic union as well as a trade union but now they are
[26:24.840 --> 26:28.600]  calling for and saying the only way that they're going to solve this is for the
[26:28.600 --> 26:33.720]  states to surrender sovereignty to the european union
[26:33.720 --> 26:38.680]  so once they get us into these trade blocks into these economic blocks then
[26:38.680 --> 26:42.600]  it becomes a political block and then they will
[26:42.600 --> 26:45.960]  join these political blocks together that's always been the plan go back
[26:45.960 --> 26:49.240]  45 years like it was big new brzezinski was laying out with a
[26:49.240 --> 26:51.880]  trilateral commission what did he see he saw three
[26:51.880 --> 26:55.560]  different areas that mirrors exactly what's going on with these partnerships
[26:55.560 --> 26:58.920]  and of course the common backbone that all this is
[26:58.920 --> 27:03.000]  being hooked to is the united states because that's where the globalists
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.160]  are the most entrenched is right here in the united states
[27:07.160 --> 27:10.760]  we had the former fed chair greenspan as well as the
[27:10.760 --> 27:14.840]  largest the the fellow who runs the largest bond company in the world
[27:14.840 --> 27:18.040]  pimpco both saying that in order to solve these
[27:18.040 --> 27:21.160]  economic situations that are going on in europe because it's not just greece
[27:21.160 --> 27:24.200]  there's the the pigs is portugal italy
[27:24.200 --> 27:27.880]  ireland greece spain all of them they're going to be coming at
[27:27.880 --> 27:32.840]  eventually all of these peripheral areas have to be made to serve the
[27:32.840 --> 27:36.680]  interests of the core countries and the central banks that run them
[27:36.680 --> 27:41.480]  so they're going to not only continue with the economic union but now they're
[27:41.480 --> 27:43.720]  saying in order for the economic union to work
[27:43.720 --> 27:47.720]  we have to have a political union they have to surrender
[27:47.720 --> 27:53.160]  sovereignty to the center now with all the talk that we've had about the
[27:53.160 --> 27:56.360]  confederate flag what people haven't been talking about
[27:56.360 --> 28:00.840]  is exactly the parallel to what happened in our country we can see
[28:00.840 --> 28:03.400]  this consolidation this movement to the center
[28:03.400 --> 28:07.720]  lord actin who said power corrupt absolute power corrupts absolutely he
[28:07.720 --> 28:11.160]  was concerned primarily about the consolidation the
[28:11.160 --> 28:14.360]  concentration of power that's what the founders of this
[28:14.360 --> 28:17.240]  country were concerned about as well they understood
[28:17.240 --> 28:22.120]  that was how tyranny would come to us would be in consolidation of power
[28:22.120 --> 28:26.200]  we saw that happen with the civil war we saw a government
[28:26.200 --> 28:30.760]  that was created by sovereign states gradually move
[28:30.760 --> 28:37.320]  from a war of independence to articles of confederation to a union to an empire
[28:37.320 --> 28:42.360]  under lincoln yes when he crossed the rubicon and it became an empire was when
[28:42.360 --> 28:46.440]  he crossed the patomic and we have seen a consolidation
[28:46.440 --> 28:49.080]  of an american empire you want to know how this is going to happen in the
[28:49.080 --> 28:53.880]  future as orwell said he who wants to control the
[28:53.880 --> 28:57.880]  future controls the past and those who control the present
[28:57.880 --> 29:02.520]  control the past they know that they are going to continue to consolidate this
[29:02.520 --> 29:06.200]  in the same way that sovereign nations created the united nations
[29:06.200 --> 29:10.600]  and now the united nations is increasingly making demands and plans for
[29:10.600 --> 29:13.640]  all of us asserting its authority that's the way
[29:13.640 --> 29:16.600]  it's going to go down you think you want to get out of the un at one point
[29:16.600 --> 29:19.160]  they're going to say no you can't leave maybe they're going to come up with
[29:19.160 --> 29:22.200]  something so draconian that people want to get out it's like
[29:22.200 --> 29:25.560]  you can't dissolve this you have no right of succession that's what'll happen
[29:25.560 --> 29:30.280]  with these trade agreements our congressmen have signed over
[29:30.280 --> 29:34.840]  their authority to an international committee that will continue to modify
[29:34.840 --> 29:38.520]  this independent of any input from our elected representative
[29:38.520 --> 29:42.520]  stay with us we'll be right back talking about more implications
[29:49.640 --> 29:53.480]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:53.480 --> 29:58.520]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.360 --> 30:05.560]  hey daniels info wars dot com i came across some statistics from a gun control group
[30:05.560 --> 30:10.200]  which state that 12,558 people were killed after being shot last year
[30:10.200 --> 30:14.520]  now let's assume that's true but let's also compare them to other statistics
[30:14.520 --> 30:19.000]  such as the fact that guns prevent an estimated 2.5 million crimes a year
[30:19.000 --> 30:23.240]  let's take 2.5 million and divide that by 12,558
[30:23.240 --> 30:27.560]  what do we come up with 199 in other words guns are used
[30:27.560 --> 30:31.720]  around 199 times more often to prevent crime than to kill
[30:31.720 --> 30:36.200]  even if we were to say double the number of people shot and killed last year to
[30:36.200 --> 30:39.880]  around 25 000 that would still mean that guns are used
[30:39.880 --> 30:44.920]  nearly 100 times more often to prevent crime regardless it's a huge number
[30:44.920 --> 30:49.480]  to say the least and to say that guns are used more often for good than bad
[30:49.480 --> 30:53.640]  is a complete understatement also be sure to subscribe to our new
[30:53.640 --> 30:57.080]  youtube channel which is called resistance news once again

[33:30.600 --> 33:33.880]  welcome back to the alex joneshaw and david night your host on this thursday
[33:33.880 --> 33:36.920]  june 25th 2015 joining me in the studio
[33:36.920 --> 33:40.760]  is anthony gucciardi we're going to talk about one more aspect of
[33:40.760 --> 33:44.520]  these trade uh partnerships like i call them uh
[33:44.520 --> 33:49.000]  they're not free trade they're actually uh a bunch of uh traders who are running
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.800]  free in congress is really what's going on with us
[33:51.800 --> 33:54.760]  also in the next hour we're going to be talking we're going to have a special
[33:54.760 --> 33:57.560]  report from alex jones because of course this is
[33:57.560 --> 34:00.680]  the fast track trade treaty they are getting this
[34:00.680 --> 34:04.520]  faster and faster the momentum is building the inertia is building
[34:04.520 --> 34:08.520]  but they still have not passed one of these secret trade agreements yet so
[34:08.520 --> 34:11.640]  we've got a video report from alex jones talking
[34:11.640 --> 34:15.240]  about how we can stop this look we don't know
[34:15.240 --> 34:19.160]  what's going to happen with any of the stuff but we see all of these different
[34:19.160 --> 34:23.000]  aspects converging on us we had just a week ago we had the pope
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.320]  talking about global warming making that an issue putting out an encyclical
[34:27.320 --> 34:33.080]  which is pretty heavy endorsement uh from the pope on a global governance
[34:33.080 --> 34:35.800]  and that's what that was a part of we're going to break that down for you we've
[34:35.800 --> 34:38.680]  got a report coming up in just a couple of minutes from rex jones our
[34:38.680 --> 34:41.800]  reporter talking about global warming so they're
[34:41.800 --> 34:44.360]  coming at world government from a variety of different issues we
[34:44.360 --> 34:48.280]  don't know really uh what's the future is going to hold when
[34:48.280 --> 34:51.720]  things are going to collapse we see economic problems building in europe
[34:51.720 --> 34:56.360]  we see economic problems building here if you haven't prepared yourself and part
[34:56.360 --> 35:00.840]  of that preparation is preparing your body preparing your health to make
[35:00.840 --> 35:04.040]  sure that you're in as good a possible physical condition
[35:04.040 --> 35:07.640]  if we have some kind of a systemic economic collapse
[35:07.640 --> 35:11.640]  making sure that you have stockpiled products you're crazy
[35:11.640 --> 35:15.800]  if you haven't started doing that i tried to take care of myself i take
[35:15.800 --> 35:20.920]  uh nascent iodine every day we've got a special on x2 nascent iodine right now
[35:20.920 --> 35:25.000]  uh you can see that at the info wars store we don't know as i said
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.760]  what's coming up but right now is the time that you need to
[35:28.760 --> 35:33.160]  take advantage of the opportunity to store this to prepare for this just like
[35:33.160 --> 35:35.640]  you're preparing food you need to make sure that you've got
[35:35.640 --> 35:40.120]  supplements and things that are going to help you to set aside
[35:40.120 --> 35:43.400]  the things that you'll need to have in place
[35:43.400 --> 35:47.160]  once we have a breakdown once there is an economic collapse
[35:47.160 --> 35:50.520]  or if it is just something like a an emergency where
[35:50.520 --> 35:53.800]  uh you cannot get to the stores and restock
[35:53.800 --> 35:56.920]  joining us now is anthony gutier already anthony you've got an article
[35:56.920 --> 36:01.720]  up on info wars dot com senate passes tpp fast tracking
[36:01.720 --> 36:05.720]  that could make gmo labeling illegal tell us about that aspect of it
[36:05.720 --> 36:08.520]  you know i was just thinking about it before coming on air and i think one of
[36:08.520 --> 36:13.000]  the most powerful weapons of the tpp is that its implication is so confusing
[36:13.000 --> 36:14.920]  to people yeah right and it takes so much time to
[36:14.920 --> 36:18.200]  research because you're like what is this tpa so just to catch everyone up
[36:18.200 --> 36:21.720]  to speed the tpa is what was passed on tuesday right
[36:21.720 --> 36:25.240]  and what that does is it gives blanket authority for president obama to come
[36:25.240 --> 36:28.840]  in and say well here's what we want to do from the white house
[36:28.840 --> 36:32.600]  you know with our trade partners our foreign national trade partners
[36:32.600 --> 36:35.720]  we want to come in and do this this and this and give corporations this much
[36:35.720 --> 36:39.640]  power and do that and that and congress can't change it in any way
[36:39.640 --> 36:42.760]  yes they can either approve it which was historically they always will
[36:42.760 --> 36:46.920]  any any trade promotions they will always approve or they can shut it down
[36:46.920 --> 36:50.040]  so and it's a time limit so as you will vote on this
[36:50.040 --> 36:54.040]  immediately essentially within 45 days and we know how that's played out when
[36:54.040 --> 36:57.160]  we looked at obama care they dumped this thousand
[36:57.160 --> 37:01.640]  plus page document on these guys and and say you've got 24 hours we're going to
[37:01.640 --> 37:04.760]  vote on it i mean that's how this is going to come down then they'll be able
[37:04.760 --> 37:08.440]  to say oh and they they put that on me so quickly i didn't have time to read it
[37:08.440 --> 37:11.400]  and we're yeah we're still we're still not going to be able to read it anyway
[37:11.400 --> 37:14.760]  right right until it's approved and one of the most interesting things is the
[37:14.760 --> 37:18.040]  small portion of this that has become available of the tpp
[37:18.040 --> 37:20.760]  one of the most shocking and disturbing things about it to me
[37:20.760 --> 37:24.760]  is how it gives monsanto the ability and nations like the united states which
[37:24.760 --> 37:28.360]  have been caught paying for monsanto's marketing materials overseas right the
[37:28.360 --> 37:32.120]  us state department was caught by wiki leaks in 2011
[37:32.120 --> 37:36.520]  i was in 2009 but it was found out in 2011 they were paying for marketing
[37:36.520 --> 37:40.520]  materials overseas from monsanto okay so they could expand and they were
[37:40.520 --> 37:45.240]  threatening trade wars against countries that wouldn't accept biotechnology
[37:45.240 --> 37:48.600]  it was really bad they were threatening spain there was different groups even
[37:48.600 --> 37:51.720]  religious groups threatening different sanctions against those who wouldn't
[37:51.720 --> 37:55.720]  accept monsanto's gmos and now the tpp is just an extension
[37:55.720 --> 37:59.080]  an octopus extension of that grabbing everything together
[37:59.080 --> 38:02.600]  and it's now allowing from monsanto to dictate its own rules
[38:02.600 --> 38:06.360]  and the u.s government to dictate its own systems where gmo labeling could
[38:06.360 --> 38:09.560]  actually become illegal so it doesn't matter
[38:09.560 --> 38:14.120]  if we decide as a state to label gmos because over 90 of the united states
[38:14.120 --> 38:17.720]  public is in favor of it the tpb would shut that down
[38:17.720 --> 38:21.000]  and just if you don't even care about gmos imagine the implications
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.520]  on a greater scale right what you're not allowed to know if you're inhaling
[38:24.520 --> 38:27.400]  jet fuel or something when you're when you're using some other product right
[38:27.400 --> 38:30.920]  it applies shut down everything this could set us back hundreds of years in
[38:30.920 --> 38:34.280]  terms of actual health laws that are meant to protect us well it could apply
[38:34.280 --> 38:37.480]  to big tobacco as well and as you're talking about this
[38:37.480 --> 38:41.080]  you know whether or not it's a law that actually prohibits so the way that it
[38:41.080 --> 38:43.480]  will work out is that it will create a trade war
[38:43.480 --> 38:47.560]  or they will go to this investor state arbitration process and they will get
[38:47.560 --> 38:50.680]  billions and billions of dollars from the people in those countries because we
[38:50.680 --> 38:54.440]  have many countries where they have outlawed gmos they
[38:54.440 --> 38:57.000]  understand that they put restrictions on it or they put labeling
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.920]  they don't want to fight this they want to transcend this and that's what this
[39:00.920 --> 39:04.440]  transnational agreement is about we've seen it happen with gmo labeling
[39:04.440 --> 39:07.800]  and with the prohibitions on gmo farming being done
[39:07.800 --> 39:11.160]  and in communities being done in states they don't want to fight that so they
[39:11.160 --> 39:14.520]  started working to fight it at the national level this is
[39:14.520 --> 39:18.680]  hopping over that to go to the transnational level
[39:18.680 --> 39:22.360]  exactly and then they argue oh well if we don't do this then we'll have to adopt
[39:22.360 --> 39:25.160]  china's trade policies if you heard that argument as well
[39:25.160 --> 39:29.000]  right so okay so we either accept carte blanche
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.680]  everything that's going to shut down gmo labeling and restrict our abilities to
[39:32.680 --> 39:35.400]  know anything about the food we're eating and restrict our abilities to do
[39:35.400 --> 39:38.600]  anything with multinational corporations which gives them
[39:38.600 --> 39:42.200]  massive shielding against all liability or we just accept
[39:42.200 --> 39:45.800]  a communist nation's 100 law that does not sound like
[39:45.800 --> 39:49.160]  reasonable options for me well it's a nonsense anyway they always
[39:49.160 --> 39:52.760]  offer us a false dichotomy look it's going to be this or it's going to be this
[39:52.760 --> 39:56.280]  so you need to pay it's like if you're getting stabbed with a knife
[39:56.280 --> 40:00.440]  and they say well we could shoot you with 55 shotguns at the same time which one
[40:00.440 --> 40:03.400]  would you rather have it makes getting stabbed with the knife not seem as bad
[40:03.400 --> 40:07.160]  right yeah exactly they they know that that's why they say well you know you
[40:07.160 --> 40:09.880]  really don't want to have china setting the rules you really don't want them in
[40:09.880 --> 40:13.000]  a pre-minute position when they have done everything for the last
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.280]  oh what since nixon and kissinger opened up china everything has been for the
[40:16.280 --> 40:20.200]  benefit of china for the last several decades but then they hold this up as a
[40:20.200 --> 40:23.800]  boogeyman to scare us the reality is is that they can add china
[40:23.800 --> 40:26.840]  the day after they sign this they can add them to the tpp
[40:26.840 --> 40:29.240]  according to jeff sessions who's looked at the documents
[40:29.240 --> 40:33.400]  they can not only change all the terms of the you know they're doing this in
[40:33.400 --> 40:36.280]  secret they're doing it without any input from any of our elected
[40:36.280 --> 40:40.120]  representatives once they pass it then there will be
[40:40.120 --> 40:44.360]  changed forever without any further input from our elected representatives
[40:44.360 --> 40:47.400]  including adding countries like china to this
[40:47.400 --> 40:51.160]  well you know there is one thing and it's that the tpa has passed right
[40:51.160 --> 40:54.840]  so the tpp has not officially passed though it's essentially done because of
[40:54.840 --> 40:57.960]  the fact that obama is going to bring it in and you know they're going to
[40:57.960 --> 41:00.920]  approve it right because they've already approved the tpa
[41:00.920 --> 41:05.320]  but the fight is not over and alex has a video coming up that he shot that i've
[41:05.320 --> 41:08.760]  seen it's really really empowering inspirational and that is the fight is
[41:08.760 --> 41:12.440]  not over and i 100 agree the fight is not over against the tpp we
[41:12.440 --> 41:15.880]  can still shut it down we can still reach out and make this
[41:15.880 --> 41:18.200]  huge because i know so many people out there
[41:18.200 --> 41:21.320]  are so impassioned about this and they're so fired up about the tpp and
[41:21.320 --> 41:24.120]  they know about it but you know how many don't even know what it is
[41:24.120 --> 41:29.000]  oh yeah and that's by design that's why they've got the tpp the ttip the tpa
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.640]  the taa it's like the rcep the tisa you know what it
[41:33.640 --> 41:37.880]  all spells it spells trap it's a trap and it's a deliberate
[41:37.880 --> 41:41.560]  confusion with all of this stuff many people were saying the first time
[41:41.560 --> 41:45.720]  the senate passed the fast track they said that's it ppp has passed
[41:45.720 --> 41:49.320]  and they even said that they even attributed criticized rand paul for
[41:49.320 --> 41:51.960]  voting for it and he voted against the fast track
[41:51.960 --> 41:55.000]  both times and i think the important thing is to look at that
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.080]  we had uh ted Cruz who voted for fast track the first time through
[41:59.080 --> 42:02.680]  the second time he voted against it now i don't
[42:02.680 --> 42:06.760]  maybe because it had 90% disapproval right exactly but now we need to push it
[42:06.760 --> 42:09.800]  further and spread the word and spread this video that everyone's going to be
[42:09.800 --> 42:12.760]  watching on youtube and spread this program and spread everything
[42:12.760 --> 42:16.200]  because we need millions and millions more people to realize what the tpp is
[42:16.200 --> 42:19.160]  and they need to get mad and that's the only way we're going to win that is the
[42:19.160 --> 42:22.360]  only way there's profound ignorance out there it's a massive
[42:22.360 --> 42:26.280]  education effort we can't do it on our own we need to have the people who watch
[42:26.280 --> 42:29.400]  this take this information give it to others
[42:29.400 --> 42:32.360]  learn about it in a way that they can explain it to people because most people
[42:32.360 --> 42:35.880]  don't know or care there's still an opportunity to do something about this
[42:35.880 --> 42:39.640]  talk to them about fast track talk to them about a trans specific
[42:39.640 --> 42:43.320]  transatlantic partnership talk to them about the fact that
[42:43.320 --> 42:49.800]  the republicans uh passed this thing and and and they opposed the temporary
[42:49.800 --> 42:53.000]  welfare benefits for people who are going to lose their jobs that was this
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.280]  that was the snagging all this is like okay if this is going to be such a great
[42:56.280 --> 42:59.480]  deal economically then tell us why you're concerned
[42:59.480 --> 43:02.840]  about unemployment benefits they know that unemployment benefits are going to
[43:02.840 --> 43:04.920]  go up that's why they don't want to pay them that's why they
[43:04.920 --> 43:08.440]  shut that part of it down so they know this is a screw job from the economic
[43:08.440 --> 43:12.520]  standpoint but it is from many other aspects and one of those that's key
[43:12.520 --> 43:16.360]  is what you're talking about the way they can hold a gun to our heads
[43:16.360 --> 43:19.720]  and force us to buy their products just like they're trying to mandate vaccines
[43:19.720 --> 43:24.280]  and we're talking to uh the lady from uh the national vaccine information
[43:24.280 --> 43:27.960]  center tomorrow about what's going on in california and across this country
[43:27.960 --> 43:31.880]  in terms of mandating vaccines they want to mandate their products
[43:31.880 --> 43:37.160]  like obama care like the vaccines like the gmo products they will use any kind
[43:37.160 --> 43:40.840]  of law or treaty to do that that's the dangerous thing that's what people
[43:40.840 --> 43:43.640]  need to understand well what do you think they're losing the battle
[43:43.640 --> 43:47.560]  they know they've lost they know over 90 percent want gmo labeling the united
[43:47.560 --> 43:50.520]  states they know over 90 percent care about the real things
[43:50.520 --> 43:53.800]  they don't want to be screwed anymore by these commerce uh the corporations
[43:53.800 --> 43:56.120]  and they know they're losing so what are they going to do they're going to pass
[43:56.120 --> 44:00.760]  the tpp it's their only option and it's it's it's it's admittance of their
[44:00.760 --> 44:04.840]  losing the battle but once again it's time for us to fight it yes absolutely
[44:04.840 --> 44:09.560]  thank you so much anthony gutriarty let's go to a report from rex jones and
[44:09.560 --> 44:14.120]  uh this is about another aspect of the way they're coming at us
[44:14.120 --> 44:17.160]  with world government because it was just a week ago
[44:17.160 --> 44:20.920]  that the pope threw in on the side of global warming and of course
[44:20.920 --> 44:24.840]  it has been a religion from the very beginning and i'll tell you about that
[44:24.840 --> 44:28.680]  when we get back from the report but let's go to that report from rex jones
[44:28.680 --> 44:32.120]  this is a engineered crisis to create artificial scarcity on the world's
[44:32.120 --> 44:35.480]  most valuable and simple resource water
[44:35.480 --> 44:39.000]  people like algor are constantly blaming extreme weather and natural
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.200]  disasters on climate change when the real culprit is weather
[44:42.200 --> 44:46.600]  but in all reality climate change is quite real
[44:56.440 --> 44:59.480]  hi i'm rex jones reporting for info wars dot com
[44:59.480 --> 45:02.520]  with all the recent flooding in central texas it's leading many people to
[45:02.520 --> 45:05.960]  believe the climate change is the real cause take a look at barton creek this
[45:05.960 --> 45:09.880]  used to be a dry creek bet now look at it it's flowing like a real river in fact
[45:09.880 --> 45:12.920]  if you take a little peek at a topography map of texas
[45:12.920 --> 45:16.680]  half of the state is green and the other half is brown here in austin texas
[45:16.680 --> 45:20.600]  where the texas hill country begins and the flatland ends is a known boundary
[45:20.600 --> 45:24.680]  between wet and dry areas of texas in fact we had so much rain here over
[45:24.680 --> 45:29.640]  memorial day weekend my good friend stevie ray von was almost underwater
[45:29.640 --> 45:33.800]  the general weather in the state of texas can vary from snow storms
[45:33.800 --> 45:38.040]  to a desert heat but generally our climate stays the same
[45:38.040 --> 45:42.280]  people like algor are constantly blaming extreme weather and natural disasters
[45:42.280 --> 45:44.760]  on climate change when the real culprit is weather
[45:44.760 --> 45:48.360]  but in all reality climate change is quite real here's an excerpt by well
[45:48.360 --> 45:51.800]  known climatologist tim ball as he details the effects of real
[45:51.800 --> 45:55.400]  climate change in the world today my life has spanned four climate
[45:55.400 --> 46:00.520]  changes i was in in the pre-war warming up to 1940
[46:00.520 --> 46:05.080]  and then i was in the cooling that occurred from 1940 to about 1980
[46:05.080 --> 46:09.800]  and then i was in the warming from 80 to 98 now we're into another cooling trend
[46:09.800 --> 46:13.880]  and hopefully i'll live to at least one more climate change when i started out
[46:13.880 --> 46:18.440]  it was a not a contentious issue at all now it's become one of the most
[46:18.440 --> 46:23.240]  contentious in the world because it's been exploited for political purposes
[46:23.240 --> 46:26.200]  just as we talked about with einstein if you were to show that there was
[46:26.200 --> 46:29.160]  something going faster than the speed of light we put that whole
[46:29.160 --> 46:33.480]  theory in jeopardy with the with the anthropogenic global warming
[46:33.480 --> 46:37.960]  theory the idea that a co2 increase will cause a
[46:37.960 --> 46:43.080]  temperature increase is now clearly shown to be wrong
[46:43.080 --> 46:46.840]  in fact i challenge anybody to show me a record
[46:46.840 --> 46:51.160]  of any duration of any time period in the history of the earth
[46:51.160 --> 46:57.320]  in which co2 is precedes a temperature increase in fact
[46:57.320 --> 47:01.800]  in every case it's the opposite temperature increases before co2
[47:01.800 --> 47:06.680]  and it will it will take ironically a cooling of the earth as is now
[47:06.680 --> 47:09.720]  occurring to make people start to question
[47:09.720 --> 47:14.760]  and so eventually the people will start to understand
[47:14.760 --> 47:18.360]  how bad the science is how wrong the original theory was
[47:18.360 --> 47:22.040]  and the whole thing will collapse most of the crazy weather we've been having
[47:22.040 --> 47:25.960]  is largely blamed by meteorologists on the pattern of weather known as el
[47:25.960 --> 47:29.640]  niño which is a warm patch in the pacific ocean which leads to more
[47:29.640 --> 47:33.000]  rain in general in the united states of america as you can see
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.080]  we're getting the full force of el niño this year and with meteorologists
[47:37.080 --> 47:41.880]  saying that there's a 95 percent chance that it will continue on to this fall
[47:41.880 --> 47:45.960]  we haven't seen the last of this rainy weather barton creek feeds into lady bird
[47:45.960 --> 47:49.880]  lake also known as the colorado river behind me and even though we have many
[47:49.880 --> 47:52.760]  dams in place massive rainfall can still cause heavy
[47:52.760 --> 47:55.560]  flooding people like al gore and the pope are claiming
[47:55.560 --> 47:58.520]  yet again that climate change is caused by human
[47:58.520 --> 48:01.720]  activity how about we have a real scientist talk about the issues
[48:01.720 --> 48:05.560]  here's weather forecaster pierce corbin on what is the real biggest
[48:05.560 --> 48:08.680]  effector of climate change the origin of our solar
[48:08.680 --> 48:12.440]  weather technique of long-range forecasting came originally from study
[48:12.440 --> 48:15.400]  of sunspots and a desire to predict those
[48:15.400 --> 48:19.320]  and then i realized it was actually much more interesting to use the sun
[48:19.320 --> 48:23.800]  to predict the weather what they found was an incredibly close
[48:23.800 --> 48:26.520]  correlation between what the sun was doing
[48:26.520 --> 48:32.360]  and changes in temperature on earth to the harvard astrophysicists and many
[48:32.360 --> 48:36.120]  other scientists the conclusion is inescapable
[48:36.120 --> 48:41.480]  the sun is driving climate change co2 is irrelevant
[48:41.480 --> 48:44.680]  another place climate change preachers are flocking to to spread their fear
[48:44.680 --> 48:47.400]  porn would be california with its three-year drought
[48:47.400 --> 48:50.840]  this doesn't seem that big compared to 200 and 400 and even
[48:50.840 --> 48:53.880]  thousand-year droughts that have happened in california's past
[48:53.880 --> 48:57.000]  the real problem with california is that it hasn't provided adequate enough
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.440]  reservoirs to supply water to the tens of millions of people that live there
[49:00.440 --> 49:03.960]  today this is a engineered crisis to create artificial scarcity on the
[49:03.960 --> 49:07.400]  world's most valuable and simple resource water
[49:07.400 --> 49:10.440]  but the place where climate change preachers can do real damage
[49:10.440 --> 49:13.960]  is in trade agreements such as the tpp the tpp is going to put no
[49:13.960 --> 49:17.400]  environmental restrictions whatsoever on third world developing countries
[49:17.400 --> 49:20.840]  allowing them to develop freely this doesn't sound like such a bad thing
[49:20.840 --> 49:23.480]  but well-developed countries will be shackled to the ideals of
[49:23.480 --> 49:27.880]  environmentalism and be forced to have very strict almost insane
[49:27.880 --> 49:31.000]  environmental regulations so when people start preaching to you about
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.080]  bill nye al gore and the pope telling us that climate change is all our fault
[49:35.080 --> 49:37.400]  just tell them that they're complaining about the weather
[49:37.400 --> 49:44.760]  i'm rex jones reporting for info wars dot com
[49:44.760 --> 49:48.280]  it's a great report from rex jones and of course as you heard that scientists
[49:48.280 --> 49:52.200]  talking about this the determining factor is the
[49:52.200 --> 49:55.160]  son i think it's very interesting when we look at this pronouncement that came
[49:55.160 --> 49:58.360]  out last week from the pope of course the guy that was the it was ghost written
[49:58.360 --> 50:00.600]  we don't know exactly who wrote it for him but the guy that he's
[50:00.600 --> 50:03.480]  lifting up pushing forward is a guy named
[50:03.480 --> 50:09.000]  shellen huber from germany and he has made some horrifying pronouncements not
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.800]  only about getting rid of six billion people on the
[50:11.800 --> 50:15.640]  earth thinking that we can only carry about a billion or so but he's also
[50:15.640 --> 50:19.000]  made some horrific statements about world
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.200]  government and of course that was what the pope was pushing
[50:22.200 --> 50:25.400]  the pope actually said you know we're seeing that economic power and
[50:25.400 --> 50:28.360]  multinational corporations they're starting to have the real power so in
[50:28.360 --> 50:31.240]  order to control them because he believes it's
[50:31.240 --> 50:34.680]  markets and freedom are the problem and of course that has nothing to do with
[50:34.680 --> 50:37.800]  multinational corporations he thinks somehow that a world government
[50:37.800 --> 50:40.440]  is going to control the multinational corporations
[50:40.440 --> 50:43.800]  it isn't going to happen the world the multinational corporations
[50:43.800 --> 50:47.160]  are the world government we need to wake up to what's going on we're talking
[50:47.160 --> 50:49.560]  about this science a little bit more when we come back
[50:49.560 --> 50:53.800]  and leon macadoo is going to be joining us with a special report from
[50:53.800 --> 50:57.960]  the street what do people think about these monuments are they going to take
[50:57.960 --> 51:01.640]  down thomas jefferson next that's what they so i asked my buddy mark where does
[51:01.640 --> 51:04.280]  the name ghost gun come from you know the ghost
[51:04.280 --> 51:07.880]  ar 15 80 percent rifle gets ghost what's a ghost gun he says
[51:07.880 --> 51:11.160]  uh duh they killed ghosts they said really ghost he's yeah
[51:11.160 --> 51:14.760]  said matter of fact they're guaranteed to kill ghosts sasquatch
[51:14.760 --> 51:18.840]  space aliens and any other paranormal force that might come your way
[51:18.840 --> 51:22.920]  so they just appropriately named them ghost guns and i said okay that's a big
[51:22.920 --> 51:26.280]  problem in my neighborhood so where do i get one he said guns80.com i said
[51:26.280 --> 51:29.880]  where guns80.com okay then i'm headed to guns80.com

[54:14.920 --> 54:20.360]  we heard a report from rex jones one of the people that he had in the report
[54:20.360 --> 54:24.680]  was talking about how the dominant factor on climate
[54:24.680 --> 54:30.520]  is the sun wow think about that don't you think that maybe has a little bit more
[54:30.520 --> 54:34.520]  effect than what you or i are doing with our cars
[54:34.520 --> 54:37.800]  listen as we look at this pronouncement from the pope last week we need to
[54:37.800 --> 54:41.240]  remember that the first time he appointed somebody to the
[54:41.240 --> 54:45.080]  pontifical academy of sciences the first pope did that that was
[54:45.080 --> 54:51.480]  Galileo and Galileo put forward Copernicus's idea of a
[54:51.480 --> 54:55.400]  universe that was not centered around the earth
[54:55.400 --> 54:59.320]  now the pope pushed back on that because they had a
[54:59.320 --> 55:03.800]  preset determination that man was the center of the universe no
[55:03.800 --> 55:07.240]  actually the sun is the center of the solar system we revolve
[55:07.240 --> 55:11.560]  around that solar system now we see someone being put
[55:11.560 --> 55:16.840]  in the academy of sciences the pontifical academy of sciences by the
[55:16.840 --> 55:21.560]  pope this john schellenhoober he believes that man is the
[55:21.560 --> 55:25.560]  center of climate change again the same
[55:25.560 --> 55:29.880]  type of mistake not supported by scientific
[55:29.880 --> 55:34.600]  information is reported supported by a lot of scientists who make their
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.080]  living out of selling climate fear
[55:39.080 --> 55:44.120]  we had the just the head of the ipcc uh from the un the
[55:44.120 --> 55:47.560]  international panel on climate change just stepped down
[55:47.560 --> 55:51.000]  because he was involved in a sex scandal but as he stepped down
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.680]  he said climate change is my religion it is my
[55:54.680 --> 56:00.040]  dharma they have argued this not from data they have made this argument from
[56:00.040 --> 56:05.560]  authority listen to us the majority of scientists say this well you know what
[56:05.560 --> 56:09.240]  back at the time they had the first pontifical academy of sciences
[56:09.240 --> 56:12.760]  the majority of science scientists said that the earth
[56:12.760 --> 56:18.680]  was the center of the universe science is not determined by majority opinion
[56:18.680 --> 56:22.200]  it's determined by facts one of the things that bothers me and of course
[56:22.200 --> 56:24.920]  this applies to what we're seeing with the secret trade agreements
[56:24.920 --> 56:28.440]  the secret laws are being created by the faiza court
[56:28.440 --> 56:32.280]  everything is a secret and of course the data that these people have
[56:32.280 --> 56:36.040]  collected is a secret we get to see what their conclusions are we get to see
[56:36.040 --> 56:40.840]  what their pronouncements are that's what climate gate was all about
[56:40.840 --> 56:44.360]  people said i've seen what your conclusions say
[56:44.360 --> 56:47.240]  and you're projecting some stuff out here we have no way of verifying your
[56:47.240 --> 56:50.120]  models these are new models you're projecting things that are out
[56:50.120 --> 56:53.880]  50 years from now 100 years from now several centuries from now
[56:53.880 --> 56:57.560]  we have no way to verify that it's not like we can go and look at the
[56:57.560 --> 57:00.520]  weather forecasting model and oh by the way john
[57:00.520 --> 57:04.840]  shellen huber the pope's science advisor says we're investing too much
[57:04.840 --> 57:07.800]  in things like improving weather forecasts no
[57:07.800 --> 57:10.920]  those are real models that's real science they can go out and say
[57:10.920 --> 57:13.640]  is it going to rain tomorrow they'll only look at their models to see if that's
[57:13.640 --> 57:16.600]  going to be true and they can actually verify that against real data
[57:16.600 --> 57:19.960]  when it comes to climate change on these large
[57:19.960 --> 57:23.560]  time scales we have to just trust their authority
[57:23.560 --> 57:27.480]  see it's always been a religious issue they even call people who don't
[57:27.480 --> 57:32.520]  blindly trust their authority their groups speak they call us
[57:32.520 --> 57:35.880]  deniers no we're skeptics we want to see the data when we've asked
[57:35.880 --> 57:39.240]  to see the data because their models have failed they've made some short term
[57:39.240 --> 57:42.360]  pronouncements those short term pronouncements have not come
[57:42.360 --> 57:45.240]  true even though we've seen an increase in co2
[57:45.240 --> 57:48.280]  we've not seen a concurrent rise in the temperature
[57:48.280 --> 57:52.440]  that their models predicted we haven't seen a rise we haven't seen a rise
[57:52.440 --> 57:55.480]  in humidity that they predicted would happen a lot of these things are not
[57:55.480 --> 57:59.240]  happening of course they tout their models this guy Schellenhuber he's got
[57:59.240 --> 58:02.600]  his institute the pik institute in germany
[58:02.600 --> 58:06.440]  he's talking about their new model their new model is climber three it's better
[58:06.440 --> 58:10.360]  than climber two or climber one hey why does he have a climber
[58:10.360 --> 58:13.560]  three it's because climber one and climber two
[58:13.560 --> 58:16.600]  didn't give him the information we asked for the information
[58:16.600 --> 58:20.040]  we couldn't get it that's why we had climate gate that's why we found out
[58:20.040 --> 58:23.160]  that there were secret emails saying we have to hide the decline the models are
[58:23.160 --> 58:26.520]  not working but they keep it secret stay with us we're
[58:26.520 --> 58:29.080]  going to be right back leon macadoo is going to talk to us
[58:29.080 --> 58:32.600]  about what she found out on the street yesterday which you've talked to people
[58:32.600 --> 58:36.760]  about the confederate flag is it a false flag is it a red herring are they
[58:36.760 --> 58:41.000]  going to come after thomas jefferson and see

[59:52.200 --> 59:57.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:06.360 --> 1:00:11.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:18.440]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:25.480]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:25.480 --> 1:00:28.440]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today
[1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:32.200]  in the next segment we're going to be talking to lienne macadoo as
[1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:35.640]  as far as the man on the street that she did here in austin
[1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:39.560]  talking to people about the confederate flag controversy
[1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:42.920]  there's some real substantive issues about that we're going to
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:46.520]  talk about that as well as look at the video in this segment i wanted to
[1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:51.320]  continue talking about this climate change issue because as i said before
[1:00:51.320 --> 1:00:55.320]  to put man at the center of climate change and ignore the sun
[1:00:55.320 --> 1:01:01.400]  is as foolish as putting the earth at the center of the solar system
[1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:05.320]  and saying that everything revolves around us but it is
[1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:08.920]  even more dangerous than that because not only is it bad science
[1:01:08.920 --> 1:01:12.760]  not only are we not allowed to look at the data and remember with climate gate
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:15.880]  what happened was it went to east anglia university in the uk they said we want
[1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:19.080]  to see your data because you've done these studies you've drawn these
[1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:21.640]  conclusions we're doing we're talking about doing
[1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:25.720]  massive changes to our society and we need to
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:29.000]  validate your data to make sure that you did this correctly and well you can't
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.800]  see our data this went on for a very long time
[1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:35.480]  finally somebody leaked a thousand emails to a server in russia
[1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:38.920]  that was climate gate we saw that they were talking about things like let's hide
[1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:42.200]  the decline the models aren't working so forth and so on
[1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:44.920]  that went on for quite some time it looked like there was going to be some
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:48.600]  changes made but of course this is really about politics and religion more than
[1:01:48.600 --> 1:01:52.280]  it is about science so nothing happened then again we had a second climate
[1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:55.480]  gate this time 5 000 emails were leaked on that russian
[1:01:55.480 --> 1:01:59.320]  server from east anglia we saw that there were also emails involving
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:04.760]  american climate let's say professionals experts okay
[1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:08.680]  like michael man or the university of virginia
[1:02:08.680 --> 1:02:12.360]  again they would not let us see their emails i was part of a group that tried
[1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:16.440]  to get those emails revealed ken kuchinelli in virginia the
[1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:19.480]  the attorney general sued to get those emails
[1:02:19.480 --> 1:02:23.560]  they kept those emails back saying these are private emails well
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:26.920]  at the time he was these are all emails that were on the server the university
[1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:31.960]  virginia when he was working there these were things that were done on the
[1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:35.400]  university computer while he was being paid
[1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:39.400]  by the university doing work for the university
[1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:43.000]  so that should have been seen by the public it shouldn't have been private
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:47.080]  is he really on the government's payroll is he doing
[1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:50.520]  private work while he's there that's that's what we need to know
[1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:54.200]  nevertheless he said well this is also proprietary data it's like no your
[1:02:54.200 --> 1:02:58.440]  research has been published it is being used for public policy we need to
[1:02:58.440 --> 1:03:01.320]  validate your data they won't show it to us that tells you
[1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:04.280]  something stinks just like something stinks with the
[1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:07.640]  secret trade agreements that we're seeing but there's another aspect of this
[1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:09.480]  so we really haven't talked about and that is
[1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:14.200]  schellenhuber's idea of a world government of course he's part of the
[1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:18.520]  earth league the person at the center of the earth league is prince charles but
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:21.960]  he's one of the scientists putting this out they've put out an
[1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:26.360]  earth statement one of the things that they want of course is world government
[1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:28.440]  and here's how this would break down they're going to have an earth
[1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:31.720]  constitution they're going to have a global council
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:35.720]  they want a planetary court a transnational we keep seeing that word
[1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:38.920]  come up all the time it's in our secret trade agreements it's in
[1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:42.120]  all these different things transnational everything needs to move to a
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:47.080]  world government that's what the pope is pushing is a transnational planetary
[1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:50.360]  court that is a legal body open to appeals from
[1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:53.960]  everyone especially with respect to violations of the earth constitution
[1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:57.400]  so when you look at these three aspects you see that what he's putting out here
[1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:04.040]  is a legal document he's putting out a elected body an earth council as well
[1:04:04.040 --> 1:04:07.480]  as a court to make people do this this is
[1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:11.240]  these are all the different aspects of a world government
[1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:15.320]  that's what we're seeing with these trade agreements that are coming up and
[1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:18.680]  again this next hour we're going to have
[1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:24.280]  alex jones explaining to us that we haven't lost the entire battle yet
[1:04:24.280 --> 1:04:29.240]  we can still fight the trans pacific the transatlantic
[1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:32.600]  agreements that are coming on the fast track is there it's accelerating it
[1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:35.880]  it's going to make it very difficult to stop it but we can stop it they're
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:38.920]  coming at us from multiple directions for world
[1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:42.120]  government whether it's for climate change or whether they call it
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:48.040]  trade free trade it's not free there's nothing at all free about it
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:51.880]  whatever you look at they're coming at us from multiple directions
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:55.080]  and we have to fight back on this we're in a fight for our life
[1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:58.600]  we're in a fight for our freedom and our independence stay with us when we
[1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:03.720]  talk to leon macadoo since 1949 the u.s department of agriculture has
[1:05:03.720 --> 1:05:07.000]  been demanding a portion of california's raisin
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  crops without payment from the farmers they gave some to schools some they
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:14.440]  sold and kept the money in 2002 farmers were told to
[1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:19.640]  hand over 89 000 tons of raisins 30 percent of their
[1:05:19.640 --> 1:05:23.240]  raisin crop medieval serfs typically paid only 10
[1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:26.920]  percent in taxes rarely more than 15 percent
[1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:31.400]  the federal government treats americans worse than medieval serfs
[1:05:31.400 --> 1:05:35.640]  but when one farm family refused the usda sued them for the value of the
[1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:40.200]  raisins 480 thousand dollars plus a penalty of 200
[1:05:40.200 --> 1:05:43.240]  thousand dollars the supreme court just struck down the
[1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:47.240]  usda's theft there was a time when americans declared
[1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:51.080]  their independence from a government that sent swarms of officers
[1:05:51.080 --> 1:05:54.760]  to harass our people and eat out their substance

[1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:58.680]  make yourself as healthy as you can you need to store the things that you're
[1:08:58.680 --> 1:09:03.000]  going to need now as well you know we got a couple of
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:07.160]  of reviews that were comments that came in and this is on
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:10.840]  nascent iodine x2 anthony gutier already gave these to me it's pretty
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:14.120]  pretty good comments so we've got feedback that has been very positive on
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:17.080]  this from a lot of different people here's just two of them hornet and
[1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:21.720]  an arbor michigan said this is the fourth nascent iodine this month stocking up
[1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:26.120]  my wife has lost 37 pounds using this another one from mel and florida said i
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:30.280]  use a product daily as i just feel better when i miss a day or a few days i
[1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:34.040]  feel terrible therefore high quality products that will keep you
[1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:39.080]  healthy you know it's something that i use because i know that in my
[1:09:39.080 --> 1:09:43.720]  diet i don't get enough iodine they've cut down on the supplementation of it
[1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:47.800]  adding it uh as they used to do a lot of foods they don't do that now
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:52.120]  and so we need to take an active role in our own health
[1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:56.040]  in preparing for a future a great way to do that is to stock up on x2 nascent
[1:09:56.040 --> 1:10:01.320]  iodine at info wars life dot com right now now joining us is leon macadoon and
[1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:04.120]  leon you went out yesterday and you talked to people
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:09.320]  about their attitudes towards um of course we had the the statue of jefferson
[1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:13.560]  davis it was defaced here in austin at the university of texas campus right it
[1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:16.200]  was correct yeah and so you went out and and
[1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:20.200]  talked to some people about that but tried to extend that out a little bit
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:25.560]  more broadly because it's about more than just a few symbols and what people
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:28.920]  think they understand or think they know about those symbols tell us a little bit
[1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:32.200]  about that right really just wanting to kind of
[1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:35.400]  see if people would be willing to take down the statues of george
[1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:39.400]  washington and thomas jefferson uh slave owners
[1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:43.400]  and that's all we we it was kind of like the buzzword there
[1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:47.880]  racist slave owners um and people really were
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:51.720]  they were willing to do that so they are that's kind of what i i learned
[1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:55.800]  two things yesterday one that it's completely false you know under the
[1:10:55.800 --> 1:10:58.840]  administration that racism is at an all-time high
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:02.200]  and that there's this race war going on because it's just it's not true you go
[1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:05.960]  out there and so many people so many young people older people that i talked
[1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:09.960]  to they they all engaged me in conversation but they were
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:14.920]  willing to take down sort of symbols of racism right but what's also at an
[1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:18.360]  all-time high under this administration is totalitarianism
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:23.320]  and this this teaching that anything that bothers you or anything that's bad
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:27.560]  you don't need to be erased and that's what i'm concerned about yeah
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:32.760]  acceptance but it's non-acceptance so they're kind of putting it across as
[1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:36.360]  this we're all open and accepting and liberal and but it's actually that's a
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:40.840]  whole thing about political correctness and multiculturalism you know it has
[1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:43.880]  it has their gods that are fiercely worshiped and you better not blaspheme
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:46.840]  them and so and it really is about symbolism over substance look
[1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:51.080]  thomas jefferson had slaves okay he was bothered by it he put in a massive
[1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:54.280]  uh section about slavery in the declaration of independence they took
[1:11:54.280 --> 1:11:58.360]  it out at the time because uh it you know that they wanted to
[1:11:58.360 --> 1:12:01.400]  focus it on other issues they thought that was too controversial is going to
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:05.000]  cause division in the south he and others said we have a tiger by
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:08.520]  the tail they wanted to get out of it they weren't sure how to get out of it
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:12.280]  right and so it was something that basically had had been carried forward
[1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:15.960]  they were looking for ways to get out of it many people were but
[1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:19.320]  regardless of what your opinion of thomas jefferson is
[1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:22.760]  this is fundamentally when i say it's about symbols over substance this is
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:26.200]  fundamentally about attacking the principles it's about
[1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:30.040]  deconstructing the principles on which this country was founded right and
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:33.240]  that's why they're going to go after jefferson and it's all about demonizing
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:36.200]  the fathers and demonizing anyone who would dare
[1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:41.160]  put forth this idea of freedom yeah and free men all created equal that's
[1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:44.120]  right instead of saying well wait a minute when you wrote that that was
[1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:48.360]  only uh the only people that were getting freedom were some white people
[1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:51.080]  and and black people are left out of that instead of saying that they need
[1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:55.080]  to stand up and say look this is for all men let's let's make that literal
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:58.520]  let's say all men let's name it and claim it or whatever let's say that
[1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:02.440]  that applies to black people applies to women it applies to everybody
[1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:05.960]  other countries have done this right other countries look at this it is the
[1:13:05.960 --> 1:13:10.120]  best the Declaration of Independence is the best statement of the rights of man
[1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:13.480]  that has been produced by anybody so far right calling
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:15.800]  and pointing out that they don't come from a government
[1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:19.080]  that governments are created to establish those rights and when the
[1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:22.680]  government destroys those rights it is not only your right
[1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:26.760]  and but your duty to abolish that government and replace it with one that
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:30.120]  will protect your rights and so it's a great statement
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:34.680]  of our rights and coming from our creator and uh what our position is as
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:38.280]  human beings and so we need to all claim this rather than trying to
[1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:41.320]  let them divide and conquer us and to push this away
[1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:44.680]  right and that's all it is it's divide and conquer and it's all about black and
[1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:48.680]  white and racist this and slave when it was a completely different time
[1:13:48.680 --> 1:13:52.520]  and it's not as if slavery was only in in America
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:56.040]  you know it's been like this forever many and it continues on with walmart and
[1:13:56.040 --> 1:13:58.280]  many other corporations let's take a quick look at that
[1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:01.720]  yes let's take a look at that report before we run out of time
[1:14:01.720 --> 1:14:05.480]  hey can i get you to sign this petition to get the president to take down
[1:14:05.480 --> 1:14:08.760]  these racist statues of george washington
[1:14:08.760 --> 1:14:13.880]  and thomas jefferson racist yeah i mean i'm white
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:17.480]  but this kind of helps me like alleviate some of the guilt of like
[1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:21.320]  slave slavery and all that so it might as well
[1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:24.600]  yeah you know it's all history but they're they all had slaves
[1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:28.280]  even george washington up there that everyone's like idolizes because he's
[1:14:28.280 --> 1:14:32.040]  just a founding father but he had slaves
[1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:36.440]  i mean do you feel like guilty at all for slavery i mean
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:39.800]  does that offend you when the statues are just like looking down on you
[1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:43.080]  all the time and you're like okay we get it you're racist
[1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:45.640]  and i understand that it's also part of our history
[1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:50.440]  and so i just i have to support it it's kind of a really bad part of our
[1:14:50.440 --> 1:14:53.720]  history that we need to erase but we learn from our history
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:57.240]  history hates itself if we're not careful so
[1:14:57.240 --> 1:15:01.640]  and i value your beliefs are really good probably then
[1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:07.880]  the rest of the racist guys i mean yeah founding father but they had slaves
[1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:13.560]  i do think it is part of history yeah but it's almost like if we can control
[1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:17.000]  the way people view history then we can control the future
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:20.760]  going forward and like we have the power in the present to
[1:15:20.760 --> 1:15:27.000]  control past yeah i mean the way i see it because it's so bad
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:31.160]  it's like as if you're having like a statue of maybe hitler or someone like
[1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:34.600]  that exactly let's put up a statue of hitler up
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:38.360]  there there's a huge socialist movement on on ut
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:41.800]  campus so trying to kind of shift the country in that
[1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:45.560]  direction
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:50.040]  how do you think about president right now you think he's good for the country
[1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:54.280]  i mean i think he's doing a great job okay so that's what we did because he's
[1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:57.080]  actually you're not going to vote for hillary
[1:15:57.080 --> 1:16:02.920]  he thinks president obama is worse than the racist founding fathers
[1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:07.480]  wow come on white people can sort of suck
[1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:11.400]  and we sure don't need any more statues of them
[1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:15.960]  would you like to alleviate some white guilt he symbolizes
[1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:21.240]  white supremacy slavery i mean really all our founding fathers were racist
[1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:24.920]  because they had slaves people have this argument about you know
[1:16:24.920 --> 1:16:30.120]  it's like the first amendment you know i think they take that too far
[1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:34.440]  it's kind of about controlling history at this point so we can rewrite it
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:39.560]  change you know transform be a little bit more aggressive
[1:16:39.560 --> 1:16:43.560]  with progressiveness i would never even thought of that
[1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:47.000]  you never would well you know why because it's white privilege
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:51.960]  yeah cool prove you're not racist red that guy up there has got to go we got
[1:16:51.960 --> 1:16:57.000]  general robert ewey and then some other white guy nobody even knows who he is in
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:00.360]  his little confederate outfit or whatever it's just racism and we want it
[1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:03.800]  taken down before the start of the fall semester
[1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:08.040]  okay i'll sign you please sign my petition to get the president of ut to
[1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:13.160]  take down the racist statues yeah just like the founding fathers they're
[1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:16.040]  all there's thomas jefferson and George
[1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:20.360]  washington and the founders of our country i know and they all have statues
[1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:25.640]  they're founded america if we can control the past we can control the future
[1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:29.400]  what do you think they symbolize i've been hearing a lot of different
[1:17:29.400 --> 1:17:33.320]  reactions to that it's like history and uh
[1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:39.080]  treason what treason treason oh really and so i mean
[1:17:39.080 --> 1:17:43.160]  that's exactly can you imagine someone trying to secede or whatever today
[1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:47.080]  under president obama i mean that just like sends a bad message
[1:17:47.080 --> 1:17:51.480]  yeah i know i'm moving so a lot of people are thinking this is like you know
[1:17:51.480 --> 1:17:55.320]  it's our history and we got to keep it here but
[1:17:57.080 --> 1:18:00.120]  and again for those who've been growing up on the radio this is a
[1:18:00.120 --> 1:18:05.960]  a petition that leon macadoo took down to the university of texas
[1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:10.120]  getting people to sign it to take down all confederate symbols forever
[1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:14.040]  right anything that we deem racist and offensive at this point
[1:18:14.040 --> 1:18:17.320]  yeah no matter what it was no matter what it was about then or what it
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:20.680]  symbolized or if they helped to found this country you know this
[1:18:20.680 --> 1:18:23.800]  great country that everyone is rushing to move to
[1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:27.240]  yeah you know so there was one lady there who uh took
[1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:30.200]  exception to what you were saying and and you were kind of playing devil's
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:34.600]  advocate there trying to encourage people to uh to feel their white privilege
[1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:38.760]  and sign that uh but tell us uh tell us a bit about what she said
[1:18:38.760 --> 1:18:42.920]  well you know she just pointed out that it's not a great part of our history
[1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:46.440]  necessarily but we need to be aware of our history because if not
[1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:50.040]  we're doomed to repeat it yes and and that's kind of the big thing that
[1:18:50.040 --> 1:18:53.480]  always bugs me about the social faux pas to ever bring up hitler and the
[1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:56.280]  nazis and nobody will you know that's like oh
[1:18:56.280 --> 1:19:01.080]  quiet about that but we need to understand that it wasn't just one bad
[1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:05.560]  dictator that did that he was able to propagandize and
[1:19:05.560 --> 1:19:11.560]  socially control an entire country to help him commit democide
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:14.840]  exactly and and they're not interested in just taking away the
[1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:19.480]  confederate battle flag as a symbol they're interested in going to the root
[1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:21.960]  of the issue because most of the presidents
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:25.640]  up until the civil war as we call it most of the presidents were from
[1:19:25.640 --> 1:19:28.520]  virginia i think there's five of them from virginia after that
[1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:33.400]  the power center really kind of moved to ohio and so there was a massive change
[1:19:33.400 --> 1:19:36.200]  and anybody who knows history knows that there was a massive consolidation
[1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:40.200]  prior to the civil war everybody talked about the united states are
[1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:44.440]  it was a group of sovereign states that had created a central government with
[1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:47.560]  very specific delegated powers after
[1:19:47.560 --> 1:19:51.720]  lincoln's war it became an empire of consolidation we're going to talk a
[1:19:51.720 --> 1:19:54.200]  little bit about that we're going to talk a little bit about the
[1:19:54.200 --> 1:20:00.520]  coup cluts clowns stay with us we'll be right back

[1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:18.360]  we just looked at the reaction that people had on the street as leon went
[1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:21.480]  out kind of playing a devil's advocate uh because they've been to
[1:24:21.480 --> 1:24:25.480]  the basement of the confederate monument there let's see it's jefferson
[1:24:25.480 --> 1:24:28.920]  davis wasn't it okay there was a defacement there so she
[1:24:28.920 --> 1:24:32.360]  took a petition out to get people's attitude about that of course we see
[1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:36.120]  an article on info wars dot com how the amazon staff are now
[1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:40.920]  answering questions this is why they're taking down all confederate flags the
[1:24:40.920 --> 1:24:44.040]  battle flag in northern virginia they why did you take it down well they say we
[1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:49.720]  were told that this is a federal law now that could just be an ignorant
[1:24:49.720 --> 1:24:52.920]  employee is part of this that actually the person who
[1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:57.880]  was talking to them got it in a chat a text chat and actually took a screenshot
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:01.240]  of that that could just be one employee doesn't know what's going on but
[1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:03.880]  other people were told that as well so it's interesting that's an article from
[1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:05.720]  paul joseph wasen then of course we have
[1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:09.640]  apple's movements on this too don't we leon right and we're seeing it all over
[1:25:09.640 --> 1:25:14.840]  ebay walmart now apple has removed all american civil war games from the app
[1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:19.000]  store because of the confederate flag so you can play these games or you
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:22.520]  reenact the civil war but now no more because of the
[1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:26.200]  the flag that flies there but you can still go to the go and play games where
[1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:30.200]  it simulates rape and beatings and carjackings and i mean that's
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:33.960]  completely fine and you can get not see memorabilia as well exactly
[1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:36.520]  you know it's interesting if you go back to if you go to google if you type in
[1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:39.560]  kkk1920s uh take a look at the pictures there look
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:43.000]  at images uh what you're going to see from the cucklucks clowns
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:47.640]  is you're going to see them carrying uh american flags
[1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:50.760]  everywhere okay they're waving american flights got giant american flags that
[1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:53.560]  are being held by a hundred people going down
[1:25:53.560 --> 1:25:58.200]  pennsylvania avenue and the capital you can also see crosses
[1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:03.000]  now those are symbols that they co-opted certainly the american flag and
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:06.920]  certainly the cross uh do not align with their principles you can also see
[1:26:06.920 --> 1:26:10.280]  that if you go to the kkk1960s take the same you'll see the
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:14.840]  same thing it's the american flag uh as one guy pointed out in a video we got
[1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:18.120]  up on info wars dot com he said you know the the confederate
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:21.720]  battle flags started being used by the cucklucks plan once they were infiltrated
[1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:25.640]  by the fbi you know we need to understand what this stuff is really
[1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:31.160]  and truly about malcom x lan and the black panthers
[1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:34.600]  became truly dangerous to the power structure once they reached out and
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:37.960]  started embracing people of every race once they were all just about being
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:40.680]  black they left them alone pretty much they followed
[1:26:40.680 --> 1:26:44.440]  them they watched them closely but as larry pinkney has talked about it
[1:26:44.440 --> 1:26:47.640]  you know the old days of the black panthers before the new black panthers
[1:26:47.640 --> 1:26:50.840]  once they were just a group that involved just black people once when
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:54.040]  malcom x was just about black people they left them alone when
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:57.960]  they started reaching out to other groups then they became dangerous
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:01.960]  and that's when we become dangerous to the
[1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:06.200]  system is when we start standing together treating each other as humans
[1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:11.080]  standing up on the basic principles of the declaration of independence that
[1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:14.760]  jefferson wrote and they don't want that to happen this is a process of
[1:27:14.760 --> 1:27:16.840]  deconstruction you know one of the things that we never
[1:27:16.840 --> 1:27:19.880]  hear talked about in civil history is reconstruction
[1:27:19.880 --> 1:27:22.760]  it wasn't reconstruction it was deconstruction just like the patriot act
[1:27:22.760 --> 1:27:26.600]  is not patriotic they always use these lies to put this stuff through and that
[1:27:26.600 --> 1:27:32.280]  type of approach began as we moved into the the american empire but
[1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:34.600]  what they were trying what they're trying to do now is they're trying to
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:37.560]  deconstruct the past as we mentioned when they were well quote you know those
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:41.320]  who control the past control the future the only effective
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:45.320]  check against centralization of power against an abusive government that
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:47.400]  takes your rights instead of protecting them
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:51.160]  is ultimately to use your right your duty
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:54.440]  to separate from that government and we have people who are even talking about
[1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:57.480]  doing that now out west and oregon and california they've grown
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:01.640]  apart culturally politically they want the right of independence and
[1:28:01.640 --> 1:28:04.920]  self-government there's not anything about slavery involved in that unless you
[1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:07.640]  can say these people are being treated to slaves by the federal government just
[1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:10.600]  like that situation with the raisin company where they go and say give us
[1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:13.880]  30 percent of your raisins right just give it to me i mean that's worse than
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:16.680]  serfs right serfs only had to pay 10 percent
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:19.960]  and that's and that's exactly what this is about people will say oh this is a
[1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:24.280]  victory for the race you know racism it's not it this is a longer
[1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:29.720]  agenda of destroying america's icons yes taking away everything we have you
[1:28:29.720 --> 1:28:33.000]  know clearly when we look at how do we fight back against things like out of
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:35.960]  control police brutality now remember that video that we had just a couple of
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:39.880]  weeks ago where they had a white guy legally carrying a long rifle strapped
[1:28:39.880 --> 1:28:43.960]  over his shoulder openly okay and he was confronted by a cop i think if
[1:28:43.960 --> 1:28:46.680]  he would have probably something else would have happened if that means
[1:28:46.680 --> 1:28:50.680]  somebody filming it but when they did the same experiment with a black guy
[1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:54.440]  the cop jumps out of the car draws a gun on him and starts screaming frantically
[1:28:54.440 --> 1:28:57.480]  get out on the ground get out on the ground and telling the pregnant woman
[1:28:57.480 --> 1:28:59.640]  who's taking pictures there you get out on the ground
[1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:03.480]  face down i can't get face down i'm pregnant there is a difference
[1:29:03.480 --> 1:29:07.000]  there is a difference in the way black people are treated in the war on drugs
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.960]  the way they are incarcerated their incarceration rates but the way to
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:14.520]  solve this is not to separate out into a smaller minority but to join with the
[1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:17.640]  larger group and united oppose all of this
[1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:21.080]  we're not any of us going to get our freedom unless we come together
[1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:24.520]  because they're holding the cards right now they've put the they rammed through
[1:29:24.520 --> 1:29:27.240]  these trade agreements and we're going to talk about that in the next segment
[1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:31.160]  alex has got a special report about how the tpp has not passed yet
[1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:34.760]  the fast track has we can still stop it it's going to be harder now but we can
[1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:37.640]  still stop it we're going to be talking about that we've also got a special
[1:29:37.640 --> 1:29:42.040]  called action how you can join in the info war and help to fight back against
[1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:49.080]  that thank you so much leon macadoo
[1:29:49.080 --> 1:30:00.280]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:30:00.280 --> 1:30:05.480]  hey daniels info wars.com i came across some statistics from a gun control group
[1:30:05.480 --> 1:30:10.120]  which states that 12,558 people were killed after being shot last year
[1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:13.560]  now let's assume that's true but let's also compare them to other
[1:30:13.560 --> 1:30:16.520]  statistics such as the fact that guns prevent an
[1:30:16.520 --> 1:30:20.600]  estimated 2.5 million crimes a year let's take 2.5 million
[1:30:20.600 --> 1:30:24.520]  and divide that by 12,558 what do we come up with
[1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:30.680]  199 in other words guns are used around 199 times more often to prevent crime
[1:30:30.680 --> 1:30:33.720]  than to kill even if we were to say double the
[1:30:33.720 --> 1:30:37.560]  number of people shot and killed last year to around 25,000
[1:30:37.560 --> 1:30:42.120]  that would still mean that guns are used nearly 100 times more often to prevent
[1:30:42.120 --> 1:30:45.400]  crime regardless it's a huge number to say the
[1:30:45.400 --> 1:30:50.440]  least and to say that guns are used more often for good than bad is a complete
[1:30:50.440 --> 1:30:53.560]  understatement also be sure to subscribe to our new

[1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:49.240]  Absolutely folks and this is david night here in the studio of course
[1:36:49.240 --> 1:36:53.080]  what alex is saying there is absolutely true i've seen it firsthand he is
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:56.360]  100 into this trying to stop the type of thing
[1:36:56.360 --> 1:37:00.440]  that we just saw yesterday with the fast track of these
[1:37:00.440 --> 1:37:04.040]  trade agreements the only way we're going to stop that is if we can get the
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:06.760]  information out and we got a report coming out from alex
[1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:10.280]  in just a few minutes where he's going to talk about what we need to do at this
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:13.480]  point in terms of educating people but in order to do that we have to grow the
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:16.120]  operation now one of the ways we're going to pay for the
[1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:19.800]  people that we're going to add is of course we could
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:23.480]  take donations we've done that in the past but primarily alex likes to fund
[1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:27.480]  the operation by offering you products that are going to help you in a
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:30.360]  win-win situation of course the newest product we've got
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:35.000]  is liver shield and liver shield advanced cleanse which is a combination of
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:38.200]  liver shield and oxy powder in a combination there
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:41.800]  it's very important that you get yourself in good condition that you
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:44.840]  maintain optimum health because you don't know
[1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:49.320]  what's coming down the pike the liver is responsible for over 500
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:52.600]  separate functions in the body including its role as your primary
[1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:56.280]  filter of toxins so how do you clean that filter
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:37:59.880]  well the way you one way you can do that very effectively is with liver
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:03.000]  shield i'm getting ready to start mine this weekend
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:06.680]  alex has talked about this and the results are real
[1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:09.480]  absolutely real i'm not going to go into the details of it but
[1:38:09.480 --> 1:38:13.480]  this is something that can be very beneficial you do need to clean
[1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:18.120]  the filter in your body and of course it's got 500 different functions you
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:21.240]  need to keep yourself healthy with a healthy liver again
[1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:26.760]  infowarslife.com that's liver shield uh introductory offer as well as liver
[1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:30.440]  shield advanced cleanse that's liver shield liver shield and
[1:38:30.440 --> 1:38:34.920]  oxy powder now continuing with what we were talking about in the
[1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:38.520]  last segment with leanne there's we've got a video that i want to run
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:45.080]  by alfonso rachel with zonation and it's on the democratic party's long
[1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:51.160]  history of racism okay let's pick up where we left off on
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:55.400]  the last zonation have you ever read the original democrat party platform
[1:38:55.400 --> 1:38:59.240]  the original included language to protect their so-called right to force
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:02.120]  people into slavery but republicans are the racists
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:06.120]  because the original republican party platform was to abolish slavery
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:10.280]  and when liberals are reminded of this they always say the same thing
[1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:14.360]  yeah well you know what zoe that was a long time ago and you need to get over
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:18.520]  it really okay well you know what slavery itself
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:22.920]  was a long time ago why don't y'all get over that oh but that's how you liberals
[1:39:22.920 --> 1:39:26.680]  are you're always able to use something as an excuse
[1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:32.200]  like slavery but that's okay that's okay let's say you can actually use slavery
[1:39:32.200 --> 1:39:37.640]  as an excuse to the afro-centric loyal democrat voting liberals who insist and
[1:39:37.640 --> 1:39:42.440]  swear up and down that the black community is still profoundly affected
[1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:46.520]  by slavery even though it happened a long time ago
[1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:49.960]  why don't you still hold the democrats responsible for trying to force
[1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:55.960]  institutionalized slavery hmm yeah you kind of got a funny
[1:39:55.960 --> 1:39:59.320]  tasting in your mouth right about now don't you yeah i think it's the tasting
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:02.520]  and boots you loyal democrats afro-centric liberals always accuse us
[1:40:02.520 --> 1:40:06.120]  conservatives of licking i'm just guessing because unlike you as a
[1:40:06.120 --> 1:40:09.160]  conservative i really don't know what these boots taste like
[1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:12.520]  y'all have been sucking boots so long that you're oblivious to the flavor
[1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:15.640]  kind of like you and a piece of gum long after the flavor is gone
[1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:18.760]  and then you accuse black conservatives of being the bootlickers
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:21.640]  and we can be sure that these accusations will continue
[1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:25.560]  as the liberals accuse me of being a whore and being paid to say these things
[1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:28.760]  the jlp writes for me even though none have yet to prove
[1:40:28.760 --> 1:40:33.000]  that anyone writes my scripts but me white people write obama scripts all
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.120]  the time though and y'all don't seem too mad about him saying all the things
[1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:38.600]  that those white liberals want him to say
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:43.560]  so anyway slavery happened long ago but you still want to use that as an
[1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:47.000]  excuse well then be consistent you should still
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.720]  hold the democrats responsible for the kkk
[1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:54.680]  jim crow dred Scott revocation of civil rights denial of 40 acres and a mule
[1:40:54.680 --> 1:40:59.480]  segregation anti-miscegenation and eugenics you know that was the democrat
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:02.280]  party that's why you liberals try to use some lame
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:06.200]  excuse that the party switched sides which is a lie anyway
[1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:10.360]  and even that in itself is an admission because the democrats had to be the
[1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:14.680]  racist party to begin with to be supposedly switched anyway
[1:41:14.680 --> 1:41:19.480]  the democrat agenda is still the same to make us subjects of the state
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:22.920]  but now they do this under the sugarcoated guise of fairness
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:27.800]  and as a buddy of mine joe dan reminds us democrats talk more about fairness
[1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:31.640]  than freedom a great video again that is a video by alfonso
[1:41:31.640 --> 1:41:36.600]  rachel was zonation you can see that at info wars dot com we got the full video
[1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:39.640]  up there you know it's interesting we don't want to get so
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:43.960]  slavishly controlled by any one party and that's what he's talking about in that
[1:41:43.960 --> 1:41:47.240]  video the very beginning people say well you know
[1:41:47.240 --> 1:41:51.080]  slavery we want to talk about that but let's not talk about the democrat
[1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:54.920]  party's role in oppression as well through jim crow and these
[1:41:54.920 --> 1:41:58.680]  other issues look we don't need to be slavishly devoted to any party we
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:02.440]  don't need to be slavishly devoted to the gop either we don't need to be
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:06.600]  slavishly devoted to lincoln look drafting people as a form of
[1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:09.960]  slavery that first happened under abraham lincoln
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:14.680]  giving us a fiat currency taking away the gold behind it that happened under
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:17.080]  lincoln that's a form of slavery as well
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:20.280]  think about the ndaa indefinite detention without trial
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:24.200]  yeah that's pretty outrageous isn't it guess when that first happened
[1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:28.200]  under lincoln yeah he took away habeas corpus he'd locked up
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:33.400]  one third of the maryland legislature as well as a congressman as well as a
[1:42:33.400 --> 1:42:36.920]  guy who was running for governor many different places but especially
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:40.840]  in maryland he came down with a hammer because he did not want to have
[1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:45.000]  the maryland legislature vote for secession so to make that happen
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:48.520]  he just locked them up no trial for you
[1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:52.840]  you don't get a lawyer as lindsay graham said well that's what lincoln said so
[1:42:52.840 --> 1:42:56.440]  we don't need to be slavishly devoted to anybody's
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:43:01.800]  deconstruction of history anybody's hagiography about lincoln or the g.o.p
[1:43:01.800 --> 1:43:04.760]  we need to think for ourselves if you want to think for yourself if you want
[1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:08.840]  to understand what's going on go back and read the books of the people
[1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:11.960]  who fought the war they didn't call each other white supremacists they didn't
[1:43:11.960 --> 1:43:13.800]  call each other racist you know quite frankly
[1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:17.480]  everybody was a white supremacist racist at that time pretty much
[1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:20.680]  especially lincoln look at the lincoln-douglas debates
[1:43:20.680 --> 1:43:23.880]  what they called each other what they called the south was
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:28.440]  secessh even more so than rebel they were concerned because of secession but
[1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:33.080]  secession is our fundamental that is the last straw but
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:36.600]  that is a straw that we keep or i should say an arrow that we keep
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:40.360]  in our quiver that is what the declaration of independence was
[1:43:40.360 --> 1:43:43.640]  it was about secession it was a declaration of war we don't want to see
[1:43:43.640 --> 1:43:46.600]  it happen but that is the nuclear option that
[1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:50.520]  needs to remain on the on the table and it doesn't happen to happen
[1:43:50.520 --> 1:43:54.120]  have to happen violently you had norway and sweden
[1:43:54.120 --> 1:43:58.360]  seceded went their separate ways peacefully so it doesn't have to be a war
[1:43:58.360 --> 1:44:02.040]  we can have self-governance and independence let's go to this report
[1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:06.520]  from alex jones talking about how we fight against the tpp because it hasn't
[1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:09.960]  passed yet ladies and gentlemen this message is
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:13.800]  not just to americans it's to people around the world
[1:44:13.800 --> 1:44:17.080]  who want their children to grow up free and not slaves
[1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:21.960]  the entire history of civilization for six thousand years
[1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:26.200]  has been between the people who produce the culture
[1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:29.560]  and tiny elites that organize themselves into criminal gangs
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:32.680]  to suppress the people we fought a revolution and won it
[1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:37.000]  from an empire that never been defeated in 1776
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:40.520]  over 150 years later the very same british
[1:44:40.520 --> 1:44:45.080]  roundtable groups founded the council on farm relations in new york city
[1:44:45.080 --> 1:44:48.120]  with the stated goal of bringing the united states
[1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:52.840]  into a new british empire now to be clear the british don't run this today
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:56.680]  but that model that system the corporations and
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:45:00.120]  combines the robber barons that grew out of it
[1:45:00.120 --> 1:45:04.120]  are establishing a planetary government you notice the popes calling for world
[1:45:04.120 --> 1:45:07.800]  government and carbon taxes right now you notice that's being suddenly
[1:45:07.800 --> 1:45:11.160]  admitted to all over the news after decades of denial
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:15.160]  we've now hit the point of an emergency the trans
[1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:21.000]  specific partnership passed yesterday now there's still a chance to beat it but
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:24.680]  the fact that congress would give the president dictatorial power
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:29.480]  to agree to whatever these foreign secretive bodies
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:35.400]  have set up is truly unprecedented and here's the bad news trade promotion
[1:45:35.400 --> 1:45:39.640]  authority once it's been handed to a president before briefly
[1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:42.760]  the senate and the house have never voted it down
[1:45:42.760 --> 1:45:46.360]  and it allows a rubber stamp in the next 60 days
[1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:50.680]  to sign on to whatever treaty that will remain secret until it's passed
[1:45:50.680 --> 1:45:54.920]  is notice that despite the fact tpp was passed yesterday
[1:45:54.920 --> 1:45:58.840]  we still can't see it but all the republican and democratic senators that
[1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:04.120]  are for it the traders true traders kept saying you can read it after we pass it
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:09.160]  but they mean after we signed on to the treaty and the word is most of it won't
[1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:12.440]  be released then the three sections we've seen
[1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:17.080]  are draconian anthony uchiati david night and the rest of our crew have been
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:20.840]  breaking that down today here on the radio
[1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:25.720]  this is one of the most devastating blows against our freedom ever and it shows
[1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:30.840]  that we have a congress that is bought and paid for it
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:34.440]  i salute the democrats who were the largest group against it
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:38.280]  they're insane on many fronts but handing the president total dictatorial
[1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:41.400]  power to a secret treaty a lot of them got was a fraud
[1:46:41.400 --> 1:46:44.760]  and their constituents know what screw job naftan gatt was
[1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:49.000]  entering us into this system to begin with the tea party fought as well
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:52.200]  how about we come together and save this country and not let them divide and
[1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:55.800]  conquer us with these distractions about rebel flags
[1:46:55.800 --> 1:46:59.560]  my god people we're not being conquered by the confederacy
[1:46:59.560 --> 1:47:04.120]  we're being conquered by the globalists and they're admitting the whole thing
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:08.360]  continue the fight it's uphill at this point
[1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:12.280]  but here's the goodness even if they're able to ratify this and ram it through
[1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:17.400]  finally the secret takeover even if they're able to do that
[1:47:17.400 --> 1:47:20.040]  now they have to implement it over the years
[1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:23.800]  england never even knew they were brought into the EU secretly
[1:47:23.800 --> 1:47:27.320]  in the late 80s early 90s and two different phases of the master treaty
[1:47:27.320 --> 1:47:31.320]  now they know about it and are moving to pull out so the beginning of the end
[1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:34.040]  of world government is when they try to actually set it up
[1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:37.320]  and don't rule from the shadows and start installing their technocrats in
[1:47:37.320 --> 1:47:39.720]  power everywhere then people go wait a minute the
[1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:43.000]  conspiracy theorists for 30 40 years fighting this they were they were
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:46.920]  right we weren't conspiracy theorists we went and read the treaty of our own
[1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:50.520]  the master treaty we we interviewed the top experts the members of parliament
[1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:53.000]  i've traveled to england traveled to europe i mean
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:56.280]  ron paul's warrant now we've got senator sessions on the floor
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:47:59.560]  a few days ago saying mr's world government they're merging the north
[1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:02.040]  american union the asian union and the EU together
[1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:06.280]  and all of it's done by stealth it's not trade it's a takeover
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:10.840]  they want to fool democrats by saying oh obama had a victory who you had a
[1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:13.720]  victory obama's legacy this isn't about obama
[1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:17.880]  he's a puppet the trendy to help shove it through
[1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:20.920]  and democrats aren't buying it that's the good news republicans
[1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:24.520]  look at those blue bloods like maynor and others they are the scum of the earth
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:28.600]  i mean this is true treason america has already been taken over by the private
[1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:30.840]  fellow reserve but now they're transferring what was
[1:48:30.840 --> 1:48:34.280]  left of the power to their secret of boards
[1:48:34.280 --> 1:48:38.200]  all right that's it for this update i'll be firing other updates at info wars
[1:48:38.200 --> 1:48:41.880]  dot com and prison planet dot com if we the people stand up and take action
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:45.400]  we're unstoppable you the viewers the listeners
[1:48:45.400 --> 1:48:50.120]  have the power you can change this we've got to change the debate over
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:54.920]  from the tranny operations and the rebel flag
[1:48:54.920 --> 1:48:58.440]  distractions and from gay marriage and stuff like this
[1:48:58.440 --> 1:49:01.480]  to the big issue that we're being conquered by globalists
[1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:06.520]  that are devastatingly cold-blooded in any country they get a hold of they loot
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:10.120]  they will debase us they will bring us down like Greece and others
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:13.560]  that's how they control us by making us poor they admit it
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:17.240]  this is their philosophy we've watched them do this in countless countries we
[1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:21.320]  got the imf from world bank documents in 2002 where they admitted the whole plan
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:26.600]  and said the west was yet uh was next i've had greg palestine bbc reporter
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:29.800]  vestigated journalist and he's interviewed one of the founders of the
[1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:32.760]  euro who admitted it was designed to implode nation
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:37.480]  states suck them dry this is economic conquest this will hurt
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:40.920]  you and your family if you thought nothing and get
[1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:44.200]  cut your wages and screwed the country up that was just the beginning
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:48.040]  the people are now waking up the battle is just started
[1:49:48.040 --> 1:49:50.920]  and they barely were able to ram this through
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:54.840]  so they're not invincible they want you to think all is lost
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:58.600]  you can't defeat them that's a fraud what they're doing is so over the top
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:50:02.120]  that they either win because they're so bold or they fail because they're so
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:05.480]  bold will their confidence game go on forever
[1:50:05.480 --> 1:50:09.800]  will you the united states of america and the in the uk england germany
[1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:13.800]  all these great nations sovereign nations that fought huge wars with each
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:17.640]  other now just get into a bunch of scum bankers
[1:50:17.640 --> 1:50:21.480]  who create a bunch of counterfeit derivatives this is the world being
[1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:25.800]  conquered by people worse than bernie made off worse than ken lay
[1:50:25.800 --> 1:50:30.600]  it was ken liking with carbon taxes i mean this is a group of scum
[1:50:30.600 --> 1:50:35.160]  are we really ruled by the hypocrite al gore are we really ruled by frauds like
[1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:38.440]  michael more with the six bodyguards with guns but you can't have them
[1:50:38.440 --> 1:50:41.800]  are we really going to be under this new royalty and submit to their tyranny
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:45.560]  the decision is up to you but the battle against tpp
[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:51.480]  now goes into the next phase it's uphill but within that fight we will expose it
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:55.320]  even more and then suddenly it'll be downhill the more we fight
[1:50:55.320 --> 1:50:59.480]  the stronger we get it's like muscles it's a long struggle
[1:50:59.480 --> 1:51:03.240]  history shows that communist china freely allows the sale of bulletproof
[1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:07.240]  armor plates while our us politicians argue from banning americans from owning

[1:54:14.600 --> 1:54:18.120]  welcome back to the alex joe show i'm david night as you were hearing in that
[1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:22.200]  last segment alex jones was saying we're not done yet
[1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:27.160]  of course the tpp has not passed we need to understand that that's another part
[1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:31.480]  of their tactic is to think make you think that it's already over to make you
[1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:34.600]  think that you've lost they haven't had the vote
[1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:38.600]  they voted and passed fast track and now they're going to try to run down
[1:54:38.600 --> 1:54:41.240]  we've got at least uh there were two treaties that we know they've been
[1:54:41.240 --> 1:54:43.960]  working on for a very long time the transatlantic the trans-specific
[1:54:43.960 --> 1:54:47.800]  partnership joining us to asia joining us to
[1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:51.240]  europe just as we've seen with the trilateral commission's plan for
[1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:54.680]  a world government moving from economic unity to
[1:54:54.680 --> 1:54:58.040]  political unity nevertheless there are other
[1:54:58.040 --> 1:55:02.440]  treaties that are coming down the road but we can fight these one at a time
[1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:07.160]  and as alex pointed out even if they pass these we can still reverse
[1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:10.040]  them there are people in europe now who are pushing
[1:55:10.040 --> 1:55:13.960]  to get out of the eu so it's it's not over as he pointed out
[1:55:13.960 --> 1:55:18.760]  once people understand that we weren't spouting out some wild conspiracy
[1:55:18.760 --> 1:55:21.800]  theories we were telling you what their conspiracy
[1:55:21.800 --> 1:55:25.160]  conspiracy plans were and have been for a very long time
[1:55:25.160 --> 1:55:27.800]  we look at the supreme court decision today again there was another supreme
[1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:30.920]  court decision on obama care we look at obama care
[1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:35.880]  and we look at obama trade they have something in common and it's not obama
[1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:39.880]  it is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to buy
[1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:45.000]  products from corporations who have influence with government
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:48.040]  that's what they're both about we talk about the fact that it's the headline
[1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:51.240]  say supreme court upholds nationwide health care law
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:54.600]  subsidies gives obama care a big win listen
[1:55:54.600 --> 1:55:58.520]  they like to portray this as these are subsidies for
[1:55:58.520 --> 1:56:03.480]  individuals these are subsidies folks for the insurance companies
[1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:07.080]  they're the ones who get to set the rates they set the rates high
[1:56:07.080 --> 1:56:12.520]  they set it for certain things that you would not normally buy like if you are
[1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:15.960]  a single male you're not going to buy maternity coverage unless you're buying
[1:56:15.960 --> 1:56:19.160]  it as part of obama care then you will pay for that they will set the rates
[1:56:19.160 --> 1:56:22.280]  for that this is a massive transfer of wealth
[1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:26.120]  from the individuals to the insurance companies and that's what these
[1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:30.280]  subsidies are really subsidizing they're not subsidizing your health care
[1:56:30.280 --> 1:56:33.480]  they're subsidizing your insurance that was fixed
[1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:36.520]  by these insurance companies telling you what you're going to buy what you can't
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:38.760]  buy and again it doesn't really matter what the
[1:56:38.760 --> 1:56:42.040]  law is when you've got a government that doesn't pay any attention to it
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:45.080]  that's what scalia is saying he says we ought to start calling this law
[1:56:45.080 --> 1:56:49.080]  scotus care now of course scotus is the supreme court of the us that's the
[1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:53.720]  abbreviation where they talk about it he says this is a defense of the
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:56.840]  indefensible he says rather than rewriting the law this is supreme
[1:56:56.840 --> 1:57:00.440]  court justice scalia he says rather than rewriting the law which is what they
[1:57:00.440 --> 1:57:03.480]  did under the pretense of interpreting it
[1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:06.120]  the court should have left it to congress to decide
[1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:09.960]  what to do about the ax limitation of tax credits
[1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:13.640]  to state exchanges but instead they just pretend it doesn't say
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:18.040]  what it clearly says for example okay
[1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:22.040]  when you look at this this law they have a
[1:57:22.040 --> 1:57:25.400]  they say congress would have had to amend the affordable care act so
[1:57:25.400 --> 1:57:28.440]  they put it in there that there would be state subsidies
[1:57:28.440 --> 1:57:31.880]  states did not enact those subsidies so rather than going back
[1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:35.960]  and following a constitutional process to go back and fix the law
[1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:41.000]  like congress has the duty to do instead they just take it
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:44.680]  with the supreme court and say we're going to pretend that it says something
[1:57:44.680 --> 1:57:48.040]  that it doesn't really say so that you don't have to go through that legal
[1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:50.600]  process so they say congress would have had to amend the
[1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:53.800]  affordable care act to fix the quote established by the state
[1:57:53.800 --> 1:57:57.800]  unquote language a politically treacherous and likely untenable
[1:57:57.800 --> 1:58:01.000]  action in a republican congress so it'd be a bit of a bother
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:04.600]  and you know it might not really pass so let's just say that it means something
[1:58:04.600 --> 1:58:08.520]  that it doesn't mean that it clearly doesn't mean this is what one of the
[1:58:08.520 --> 1:58:12.120]  attorneys for the challenger said if the rule of law means anything
[1:58:12.120 --> 1:58:15.800]  it is that text is not infinitely malleable
[1:58:15.800 --> 1:58:20.440]  that agencies must follow the law as written not revise it to better achieve
[1:58:20.440 --> 1:58:23.960]  what they assume congress had as a purpose
[1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:26.840]  yeah but that's not the world that we currently live in
[1:58:26.840 --> 1:58:30.040]  that's the world we're going to live in we're going to make that happen
[1:58:30.040 --> 1:58:42.920]  with your help be with your help stay with us we'll be right back
[1:58:42.920 --> 1:58:50.200]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[1:58:50.200 --> 1:58:53.560]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers
[1:58:53.560 --> 1:58:56.920]  and sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news
[1:58:56.920 --> 1:59:00.280]  website info wars dot com because the companies i've been
[1:59:00.280 --> 1:59:04.600]  approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable
[1:59:04.600 --> 1:59:08.360]  as they should be so i refused probably 30 40 firearms
[1:59:08.360 --> 1:59:12.200]  manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we get

[2:00:50.920 --> 2:00:54.840]  does the imf actually want to cause a greek debt default
[2:00:54.840 --> 2:00:58.520]  warm buffet says derivatives are still weapons of mass destruction and they're
[2:00:58.520 --> 2:01:02.680]  likely to cause big troubles 12 signs the u.s and china are moving towards war
[2:01:02.680 --> 2:01:06.680]  and then one lindsay williams martin armstrong and alex jones all worn about
[2:01:06.680 --> 2:01:10.360]  what is coming in the fall of 2015 we're going to talk to him
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:14.520]  in the next segment this segment i want to talk a little bit about the war on
[2:01:14.520 --> 2:01:18.840]  the press because that is key for the people who were it's
[2:01:18.840 --> 2:01:22.200]  it's an information war for these folks we talk about this all the time and one
[2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:24.360]  of the ways that they're going to win the war
[2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:27.880]  is that they keep us in the dark if they keep us ignorant
[2:01:27.880 --> 2:01:32.280]  here's an article from reason how the feds asked me to rat out commentators
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:34.280]  this kind of interesting they had a uh...
[2:01:34.280 --> 2:01:38.840]  a comment on may 31st he blogged about a life sentence that was given to ross
[2:01:38.840 --> 2:01:42.120]  olbrecht the creator of the dark website silk road
[2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:45.560]  now we've interviewed his mother several times we talked about that course he
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:49.160]  was given a draconian sentence of life in prison
[2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:52.520]  in the comment sections a lot of people were angry at the judge catherine force
[2:01:52.520 --> 2:01:55.160]  in the comment section he said there's half a dozen commenters
[2:01:55.160 --> 2:01:58.360]  unloaded on the judge suggesting among other things that she should burn in
[2:01:58.360 --> 2:02:00.520]  hell be taken out and shot another one
[2:02:00.520 --> 2:02:04.120]  uh... in an internet homage to the corn brothers essentially ought to be fed
[2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:07.720]  beat first into a wood chipper of course that's referring to the movie
[2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:12.360]  fargo he says for starters the subpoena was unnecessary because the comments
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:14.840]  obviously were not real one of the commenters
[2:02:14.840 --> 2:02:18.840]  uh... scooped up in this had written i hope there's a special place in hell
[2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:21.880]  reserved for that horrible woman now think about it
[2:02:21.880 --> 2:02:25.480]  that the government would demand to know who this is
[2:02:25.480 --> 2:02:29.720]  when somebody makes a hyperbolic comment like that
[2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:33.320]  this do you find that frightening okay well then look at what happened
[2:02:33.320 --> 2:02:37.320]  to james o'keith he got stopped coming back into the country this is an article
[2:02:37.320 --> 2:02:39.960]  we have up on info wars dot com customs agents
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:44.600]  stopped him uh... he had said why am i being singled out why am i being
[2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:47.480]  detained and of course they said well it's because you crossed the border and
[2:02:47.480 --> 2:02:50.600]  filmed yourself doing it without our permission
[2:02:50.600 --> 2:02:54.920]  and then of course they show a picture of a big x on his uh...
[2:02:54.920 --> 2:02:58.600]  documents there that they uh... they put in there and they said you're going to be
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:01.240]  stopped every time you come through the border
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:06.120]  i guess that'll teach him want it okay so another intimidation and then of course
[2:03:06.120 --> 2:03:09.880]  there's this as well we see yesterday
[2:03:09.880 --> 2:03:14.040]  the department of defense outlined laws of war
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:17.560]  and came up with an interesting label so they've got three different categories
[2:03:17.560 --> 2:03:21.640]  this is a a large document uh... very very large document
[2:03:21.640 --> 2:03:24.920]  uh... just written the department of defense law of war manual
[2:03:24.920 --> 2:03:28.600]  uh... think is about a thousand pages and basically they break down
[2:03:28.600 --> 2:03:33.560]  uh... the legal guidelines for all the branches of the military when they
[2:03:33.560 --> 2:03:36.520]  get to the section on journalists and it's kind of interesting that they would
[2:03:36.520 --> 2:03:39.080]  even add a section on journalists
[2:03:39.080 --> 2:03:42.360]  they break down journalists into three categories essentially
[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:45.640]  members of the armed forces so there's journal uh... then those who are
[2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:48.840]  authorized to accompany the armed forces those who are embedded
[2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:53.400]  and then unprivileged belligerence so you're either
[2:03:53.400 --> 2:03:56.760]  with us or you're an unprivileged belligerent because
[2:03:56.760 --> 2:04:00.920]  you're either military or you're embedded with the military as reporter
[2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:05.480]  or you are an unprivileged belligerent what is an unprivileged belligerent
[2:04:05.480 --> 2:04:09.560]  well an unprivileged belligerent is somebody
[2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:13.400]  who is essentially in the past has been a spy
[2:04:13.400 --> 2:04:17.800]  that's the way they view journalists that are not under their control
[2:04:17.800 --> 2:04:21.800]  a potential spy a potential risk a security threat
[2:04:21.800 --> 2:04:26.760]  there's two sections for those people journalists and the first the section of
[2:04:26.760 --> 2:04:31.080]  four point twenty four point four says journalists and spying
[2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:33.560]  see you're a spy if you're not embedded with them
[2:04:33.560 --> 2:04:37.320]  so to avoid being mistaken for spies journalists should act openly and with
[2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:41.480]  the permission of the authorities same thing
[2:04:41.480 --> 2:04:44.920]  goes for the next section security precautions see
[2:04:44.920 --> 2:04:48.920]  states may need to censor journalists so they need to make sure at all times
[2:04:48.920 --> 2:04:51.960]  they have the permission of the government sorry
[2:04:51.960 --> 2:04:55.720]  first amendment doesn't stay that say that say whether it's gonna be right back
[2:04:55.720 --> 2:05:00.520]  with michael schneider
[2:05:00.520 --> 2:05:03.960]  police departments across the country are now using
[2:05:03.960 --> 2:05:07.720]  an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays
[2:05:07.720 --> 2:05:12.440]  which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages
[2:05:12.440 --> 2:05:17.960]  without warrants the technology comes courtesy of the FBI
[2:05:17.960 --> 2:05:22.360]  who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure
[2:05:22.360 --> 2:05:26.920]  agreements forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology
[2:05:26.920 --> 2:05:31.080]  needless to say this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment
[2:05:31.080 --> 2:05:35.000]  and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying
[2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:38.680]  where we now know that police are collecting information on
[2:05:38.680 --> 2:05:42.360]  thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected
[2:05:42.360 --> 2:05:47.160]  of any crimes once again more evidence that the police state isn't coming
[2:05:47.160 --> 2:05:52.840]  it's already here this is dara mcbreen and i invite you to join the resistance
[2:05:52.840 --> 2:05:59.320]  info wars dot com
[2:05:59.320 --> 2:06:02.600]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers
[2:06:02.600 --> 2:06:06.520]  as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website
[2:06:06.520 --> 2:06:10.120]  info wars dot com because the companies i've been approached by
[2:06:10.120 --> 2:06:14.520]  were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be
[2:06:14.520 --> 2:06:18.200]  so i refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers

[2:08:43.240 --> 2:08:46.600]  a couple articles in the last few days why is nasa working on a way to destroy
[2:08:46.600 --> 2:08:50.600]  asteroids using nuclear weapons does the imf actually want to cause

[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:04.200]  michael snyder i want to go to him in just a moment before i do
[2:09:04.200 --> 2:09:07.560]  we've been talking about how we're trying to grow this operation how we're in a
[2:09:07.560 --> 2:09:13.800]  fight to stop the uh effects of tpp if we can't completely stop tpp from
[2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:17.880]  pass tpp from passing uh the fast track has gone through it's going to be more
[2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:20.760]  difficult to stop it we're going to have to fight harder than ever
[2:09:20.760 --> 2:09:23.880]  one way that you can do this of course is to
[2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:28.440]  follow us at prison planet tv become a subscriber support our operation

[2:09:57.480 --> 2:10:02.040]  those is michael snyder's articles that we post up on info wars dot com
[2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:05.800]  he's the creator of the economic collapse blog dot com
[2:10:05.800 --> 2:10:09.240]  he is not a member of any political party he points out or any political
[2:10:09.240 --> 2:10:12.440]  organization he is very pessimistic about what's going on
[2:10:12.440 --> 2:10:15.080]  i should say bearish is probably a better word
[2:10:15.080 --> 2:10:18.840]  he also writes end of the american dream dot com the truth wins dot com there's
[2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:21.960]  a positive one for you author of two books beginning of the end
[2:10:21.960 --> 2:10:25.640]  and get prepared see if you're looking at this from a bearish
[2:10:25.640 --> 2:10:28.840]  perspective just like max keiser we had him on a couple of days ago
[2:10:28.840 --> 2:10:33.000]  he's a bear he's got that on his social media his website he's got a picture of
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:37.240]  a bear behind his picture that's preparing for the worst case
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:40.680]  scenario that's what we really need to prepare for so
[2:10:40.680 --> 2:10:44.200]  joining us now is michael snyder welcome michael
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:48.280]  thank you it's a real privilege to be on with you we read your articles all the
[2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:52.120]  time so it's interesting to see what you look like and get a chance to talk to
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:55.320]  what do you want to cover first because we've just seen the
[2:10:55.320 --> 2:10:58.840]  trans-pacific partnership uh not partnership i make that mistake again
[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:03.000]  we saw the fast track go through we're going to see these
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:06.040]  trade treaties that they've been working on they're going to try to ram them
[2:11:06.040 --> 2:11:09.720]  through very rapidly uh what is your feeling on this what should
[2:11:09.720 --> 2:11:13.080]  take yeah well a lot of people out there have
[2:11:13.080 --> 2:11:17.640]  been waiting for a one-world economic system to come someday
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:21.480]  but to me it's here now and this is another huge step toward
[2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:25.880]  integrating the us economy with the entire globe in fact the t
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:32.360]  tpp will cover 40 percent of the entire gdp of the entire planet and then the
[2:11:32.360 --> 2:11:36.120]  plan is eventually to get china and the eu and
[2:11:36.120 --> 2:11:40.520]  everyone else along with the two to make it a truly global treaty
[2:11:40.520 --> 2:11:44.920]  what this is going to mean is it's going to mean the loss of more jobs more
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:49.800]  manufacturing facilities already we've seen more than 56 000
[2:11:49.800 --> 2:11:52.920]  manufacturing facilities shut down in the united states
[2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:58.360]  since 2001 we've lost millions of jobs we've seen our economic infrastructure
[2:11:58.360 --> 2:12:03.080]  act absolutely get gutted and this is going to take it to an entirely new
[2:12:03.080 --> 2:12:06.760]  level every single treaty that comes along whether it's nafta whether it's
[2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:11.800]  capta whatever it is it's it's always meant less jobs for american
[2:12:11.800 --> 2:12:15.960]  workers it's always meant more jobs more businesses going overseas
[2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:19.720]  so this this is just another step in that direction and then the other thing
[2:12:19.720 --> 2:12:23.560]  that infuriates me about this is that this see this
[2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:27.160]  treaty is not just about economics and trade that's only a small part of it
[2:12:27.160 --> 2:12:30.680]  it's also about the environment it's about intellectual property
[2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:34.040]  it's about the internet it's about derivatives it's about
[2:12:34.040 --> 2:12:40.600]  education it's about so many other things that's so true and you know i
[2:12:40.600 --> 2:12:43.800]  the sad thing about it is you started out talking about how it is global
[2:12:43.800 --> 2:12:48.680]  governance and of course senator jeff sessions pointed that out he's
[2:12:48.680 --> 2:12:53.480]  not anybody who believes he's not a 9-11 truther he's not somebody
[2:12:53.480 --> 2:12:57.320]  that is out there that's been talking about a new world government
[2:12:57.320 --> 2:13:00.360]  but he looked at the agreement and he said look they're creating
[2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:03.880]  a transnational committee that is going to have the power to write its own laws
[2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:08.760]  without any input from us this is global governance and so when we fight
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:12.680]  against this just by talking about the negative economic consequences and
[2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:16.440]  we've seen how these economic consequences have worked out for us with
[2:13:16.440 --> 2:13:19.960]  nafta if we just fight against it on that basis alone
[2:13:19.960 --> 2:13:24.120]  though we're fighting at it with one hand behind our back aren't we
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:27.320]  oh we absolutely are and what infuriates me
[2:13:27.320 --> 2:13:31.480]  is that the republicans have been the ones pushing for this pushing so hard
[2:13:31.480 --> 2:13:35.000]  to give obama this authority to negotiate this
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:39.960]  this comprehensive treaty in secrecy it's an ultra secret
[2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:44.040]  treaty members of congress actually have to go into a basement room
[2:13:44.040 --> 2:13:47.400]  to read this treaty they're handed one section at a time
[2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:50.840]  where they're able to go through with someone actually looking over their
[2:13:50.840 --> 2:13:54.200]  shoulder as they read it when they're done they have to hand it back
[2:13:54.200 --> 2:13:58.360]  when they leave the room and when they they come out of the room and go back
[2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:01.720]  they're not allowed to tell any of us they're not allowed to tell the public
[2:14:01.720 --> 2:14:05.160]  was actually in this treaty so do we still live in a republic this is so
[2:14:05.160 --> 2:14:08.840]  absolutely absurd and so what barack obama is almost
[2:14:08.840 --> 2:14:12.840]  assuredly doing is everything he couldn't get through congress before
[2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:16.600]  everything that he always wanted to do he's sticking into this treaty putting
[2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:20.200]  into this treaty and the republicans are saying yeah we let's go ahead and
[2:14:20.200 --> 2:14:23.800]  give him this authority to negotiate this super huge
[2:14:23.800 --> 2:14:27.560]  treaty which is going to lock us in and then this treaty is going to say the
[2:14:27.560 --> 2:14:30.920]  only way that it can be changed is with the permission of all the other
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:34.440]  countries that the party's treaty so it's it's really
[2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:38.600]  insidious well with the permission of that transnational committee
[2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:41.480]  which presumes to represent all those other countries
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:45.480]  you know one of the things that we need to do i think michael as we need to
[2:14:45.480 --> 2:14:48.920]  the republicans are signing on to this in many cases the rank and file say well i
[2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:52.280]  support free trade they need to understand this is not free trade
[2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:56.280]  any more than crony capitalism and what we saw happen with the banks that's
[2:14:56.280 --> 2:15:00.920]  not a free market okay so understand this is not free trade by
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:03.880]  any stretch of the imagination and they also need to understand
[2:15:03.880 --> 2:15:06.760]  i think you're talking about all these different issues that are already a
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:08.760]  part of it based on the leaks that we've seen
[2:15:08.760 --> 2:15:12.040]  they can bring in things like gun control we've seen the un arms trade treaty
[2:15:12.040 --> 2:15:16.280]  that obama is desperate to pass that john carrey said he signed on
[2:15:16.280 --> 2:15:19.320]  behalf of the american people first we had senator
[2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:22.920]  corker from tennessee say i'm sorry that's not the way the law works
[2:15:22.920 --> 2:15:27.960]  but they are willing to you know bend the constitution to their will we see
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:30.600]  this over and over again we just saw it in the supreme court decision today it
[2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:34.360]  doesn't matter what the language says they're going to use any kind of
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:38.120]  pretense or perverication to do what they want to do so we should be very
[2:15:38.120 --> 2:15:40.440]  concerned and we ought to get republicans on board with this saying
[2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:43.720]  look this is going to affect gun control quite
[2:15:43.720 --> 2:15:48.520]  possibly this is something's been going down the pike for several years as well
[2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:52.680]  yeah absolutely we truly have become a lawless land and we saw this with the
[2:15:52.680 --> 2:15:56.680]  supreme court decision today uh about obama care with chief
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:16:01.160]  justice roberts once again stepping up to defend obama care and i warned at the
[2:16:01.160 --> 2:16:05.240]  time he was nominated this is a progressive this is not someone that
[2:16:05.240 --> 2:16:09.080]  has a respect for a constitution but all the conservatives out there because he
[2:16:09.080 --> 2:16:12.200]  was nominated by a republican they thought oh this is a good
[2:16:12.200 --> 2:16:15.400]  justice he's going to stand up for the constitution but that i said no that's
[2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:18.360]  not going to be the case and that's turned out not to be the case
[2:16:18.360 --> 2:16:22.600]  now what a lot of people out there may not realize is that i actually have
[2:16:22.600 --> 2:16:25.880]  a law degree i went to law school the university of florida law school and then
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:28.120]  i went on to practice law right in the heart of
[2:16:28.120 --> 2:16:33.320]  washington dc down on k street and what people need to realize is that in our
[2:16:33.320 --> 2:16:37.480]  law schools all over this country and courts all over this land a lot of times
[2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:41.560]  these court decisions these judges what they do is they decide
[2:16:41.560 --> 2:16:45.000]  what they want to rule how they want to rule and then they
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:48.760]  fish for any kind of possible justification they can to come to that
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:53.480]  end result absolutely latest decision and we've seen it with a whole series of
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:57.240]  decisions so we you know the respect for the constitution
[2:16:57.240 --> 2:17:00.840]  has really gone out the window oh absolutely grudge had a
[2:17:00.840 --> 2:17:04.440]  article up yesterday talking about how the supreme court and roberts had moved
[2:17:04.440 --> 2:17:08.600]  quite a bit to the left and they they ranked it by all these different
[2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:11.400]  decisions and that was before today's move and so
[2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:15.560]  drugs put that up as a headline today the court swings far to the left
[2:17:15.560 --> 2:17:18.280]  i think that's really true and it underscores
[2:17:18.280 --> 2:17:23.160]  the nonsense of thinking that you're going to
[2:17:23.160 --> 2:17:27.160]  that the republican party that a supreme court nominee from a republican
[2:17:27.160 --> 2:17:32.040]  president are going to vote the way you want them to vote look these guys are
[2:17:32.040 --> 2:17:35.240]  tools of the corporations take a look at the
[2:17:35.240 --> 2:17:39.480]  keystone pipeline for example okay the republicans have passed that
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:43.160]  10 times they still haven't gotten it through but they've passed that 10 times
[2:17:43.160 --> 2:17:47.560]  and we could have a discussion about uh oil and about pollution and sources of
[2:17:47.560 --> 2:17:51.000]  oil and stuff but the thing that concerns me about the keystone pipeline
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:56.280]  again is this supranational idea that the corporations
[2:17:56.280 --> 2:18:00.200]  rule and you can see that already as they got close to passing this
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:04.040]  they gave trans canada which is running the keystone pipeline they gave them
[2:18:04.040 --> 2:18:09.720]  imminent domain to condemn and seize the farms of people who are going to be in
[2:18:09.720 --> 2:18:11.800]  the path of the pipeline people who've had this
[2:18:11.800 --> 2:18:16.760]  the farms in their uh family for over a hundred years they gave that to a
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:19.160]  corporation this is far beyond the kello decision
[2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:22.920]  where the supreme which is a supreme court uh said was okay where they
[2:18:22.920 --> 2:18:27.160]  had a local government take from one individual and give to
[2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:30.280]  another individual private property not for public use
[2:18:30.280 --> 2:18:34.440]  but for private use now this is something that is uh giving not only
[2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:38.360]  extending that but extending it to a foreign corporation giving the foreign
[2:18:38.360 --> 2:18:43.080]  corporation the power to condemn and to take for that private that
[2:18:43.080 --> 2:18:47.320]  corporations benefit that's amazing to me but we see the republicans
[2:18:47.320 --> 2:18:51.000]  lining up to do that we see the republicans refusing to take on obama care
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:54.760]  and we see the supreme court saying hey you know this would be a difficult thing
[2:18:54.760 --> 2:18:58.600]  if we had to actually rewrite the law to do what we wanted to do so let's just
[2:18:58.600 --> 2:19:02.440]  have the supreme court wave their magic wand over it and say these words don't
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:06.840]  mean what these words mean oh absolutely and when i was in
[2:19:06.840 --> 2:19:11.480]  law school when people go to law school uh most americans don't realize but our
[2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:14.840]  law students are being taught and trained that the constitution is a
[2:19:14.840 --> 2:19:20.600]  living breathing document in other words that it can change with the times
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:25.000]  that that you know and and and the attitude that we are we
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:29.320]  law students are taught in law school is that we know better
[2:19:29.320 --> 2:19:33.400]  than those who frame the constitution we know better than previous generations
[2:19:33.400 --> 2:19:37.400]  of americans we're progressing toward the future essentially law schools are
[2:19:37.400 --> 2:19:42.040]  kind of seminaries for progressives in which we're
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:45.880]  ingrained with progressivism now of course i never embraced that but i saw
[2:19:45.880 --> 2:19:49.560]  happening all around me and all of my law professors almost every
[2:19:49.560 --> 2:19:52.760]  single one was a hardcore progressive hang on
[2:19:52.760 --> 2:19:55.960]  hang on right there we got to go to break michael snider will be right back
[2:19:55.960 --> 2:20:00.360]  we're gonna talk about postmodernism the malleable constitution stay with us

[2:20:11.240 --> 2:20:14.120]  correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a
[2:20:14.120 --> 2:20:16.680]  greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army

[2:24:25.160 --> 2:24:29.240]  dot com and we're going to talk to him about economic collapse what he sees
[2:24:29.240 --> 2:24:32.920]  and the near future his concerns and also
[2:24:32.920 --> 2:24:37.320]  what he thinks the timing may be in the last segment we were talking about the
[2:24:37.320 --> 2:24:40.680]  supreme court decision that just came out in terms of
[2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:44.120]  obama care as justice glia said let's call it
[2:24:44.120 --> 2:24:47.960]  scotus care because they are essentially writing the laws
[2:24:47.960 --> 2:24:53.080]  and moving the words of the law to suit themselves he said it's not a malleable
[2:24:53.080 --> 2:24:56.840]  document and michael is a lawyer by training
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:24:59.880]  and he was just talking about how they're training the lawyers
[2:24:59.880 --> 2:25:04.520]  in law school now to see the constitution as a living document
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:08.840]  jeff sessions is a lawyer he's a judge and he looked at the trans-pacific
[2:25:08.840 --> 2:25:14.280]  partnership and he was appalled by the fact that it itself was a
[2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:18.920]  living document something that could be infinitely changed without
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:24.120]  any due process by any involvement by any of the nations that signed onto it it
[2:25:24.120 --> 2:25:26.920]  was going to be a transnational committee that was going to be free to
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:31.320]  change this of course they're going to present it as a complete package to
[2:25:31.320 --> 2:25:35.480]  the house and to the senate once it is passed and they're not going to be able
[2:25:35.480 --> 2:25:39.080]  make any amendments once it is passed that international committee is going
[2:25:39.080 --> 2:25:41.960]  to be able to change it at will but i want to get back to what you were
[2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:46.040]  talking about because it was uh exactly what scalia was talking
[2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:49.320]  about today how they're teaching the law school students that the
[2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:52.440]  constitution is a malleable document kind of this
[2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:59.560]  post-modern subjective outlook on it yeah and if you go to and look at federal
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:03.960]  court decisions today sometimes they even go to international law or
[2:26:03.960 --> 2:26:07.000]  international standards of morality they call it
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:11.560]  to to justify their decisions they even go outside of the united states so
[2:26:11.560 --> 2:26:15.320]  anything they can reach for and grasp and they change they talk about
[2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:19.000]  changing public values changing public opinions
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:23.720]  and so i expect to see something similar within the next few days regarding
[2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:27.640]  the uh upcoming decision about gay marriage which i fully expect to be
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:31.640]  declared a constitutional right even though the constitution says nothing
[2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:34.680]  of the sort no language in there which could possibly
[2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:38.280]  be used to justify such a thing but i fully expect
[2:26:38.280 --> 2:26:42.360]  that it will be termed a fundamental right well it will be the technical
[2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:46.440]  language that will be used and i fully expect the the supreme court to make it
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:49.080]  the law of the land in all 50 states but not
[2:26:49.080 --> 2:26:52.840]  but the the reason they're doing it is because that's the decision they want
[2:26:52.840 --> 2:26:55.960]  to come to yes i believe justice roberts will once again
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:27:00.120]  side on that and and but they're they're making things up out of thin air that's
[2:27:00.120 --> 2:27:04.280]  what people need to realize yeah the constitution says that uh
[2:27:04.280 --> 2:27:08.680]  the central government doesn't have any powers unless they are explicitly
[2:27:08.680 --> 2:27:11.800]  granted to it and of course they will play games of things like the commerce
[2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:14.120]  clause which i i kind of find interesting michael because you know the
[2:27:14.120 --> 2:27:17.560]  commerce clause was originally there to create free trade
[2:27:17.560 --> 2:27:20.760]  you know it was originally there to stop the different states from
[2:27:20.760 --> 2:27:24.040]  imposing taxes as goods were crossing from let's say
[2:27:24.040 --> 2:27:27.320]  texas into oklahoma they're going to say no oklahoma is not going to be able to
[2:27:27.320 --> 2:27:30.840]  put an import tax on those goods so they put the commerce clause in there
[2:27:30.840 --> 2:27:34.760]  to create free trade and the government has turned that on its head
[2:27:34.760 --> 2:27:39.800]  and used it to not only control trade but to
[2:27:39.800 --> 2:27:43.640]  involve themselves in pretty much every aspect of our lives and of course
[2:27:43.640 --> 2:27:46.840]  that's the kind of pervercations the kind of lies and perversions that they
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:49.800]  use there's absolutely nothing in the constitution
[2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:53.880]  that gives the government the central government control over
[2:27:53.880 --> 2:27:57.400]  defining marriage of course they don't even have any control over prohibiting
[2:27:57.400 --> 2:28:01.080]  drugs they had to have a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol
[2:28:01.080 --> 2:28:04.920]  and then another one to make it legal again at least in the early 20th century
[2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:09.720]  we had people in washington who paid respect to the formalities of the law
[2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:12.360]  we no longer have that if they don't want you to have something just say
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:15.400]  you can't have it if they want you to buy a product for more of their corporate
[2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:19.800]  sponsors they mandate it that's where we are today
[2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:24.120]  oh absolutely and you know it's absolutely insane what's happening
[2:28:24.120 --> 2:28:27.640]  you know to our the constitution and to the rule of law
[2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:30.760]  and and and i think it's only going to get worse
[2:28:30.760 --> 2:28:35.160]  i recently wrote an article about the emergency powers that our presidents
[2:28:35.160 --> 2:28:39.400]  have and obama has more than ever before and federal courts have consistently
[2:28:39.400 --> 2:28:43.400]  sided with the presidency even though the constitution says nothing about
[2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:47.240]  emergency powers but today barack obama is the most
[2:28:47.240 --> 2:28:52.280]  powerful president in all of us history thanks not only to executive orders but
[2:28:52.280 --> 2:28:56.520]  statute uh statutory law and a whole bunch of other
[2:28:56.520 --> 2:28:59.880]  things and precedents that have been said in courts
[2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:04.040]  if we have a major national emergency it's at the point where the groundwork
[2:29:04.040 --> 2:29:08.600]  has already been laid for barack obama to essentially be a dictator and take
[2:29:08.600 --> 2:29:14.040]  control of basically whatever he wants and to do basically whatever he wants
[2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:18.040]  all we need is it one major national crisis
[2:29:18.040 --> 2:29:22.120]  and he already has the groundwork the legal authority although
[2:29:22.120 --> 2:29:25.080]  he really you know according to the constitution he wouldn't but the
[2:29:25.080 --> 2:29:28.600]  groundwork has been laid in the courts for him to take control basically of
[2:29:28.600 --> 2:29:32.600]  everything oh absolutely yeah and that's what you wind up with when you
[2:29:32.600 --> 2:29:36.280]  throw out the objective truth of written law
[2:29:36.280 --> 2:29:39.240]  and you make it a living document then it is whatever the people
[2:29:39.240 --> 2:29:43.000]  say it is it's whatever the leader says it is that's a definition of a
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:45.240]  dictator stay with us we're going to be right back with michael
[2:29:45.240 --> 2:29:49.320]  snider we're going to talk about what he sees as the coming collapse as well as
[2:29:49.320 --> 2:29:53.480]  the time we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:53.480 --> 2:29:58.440]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:30:00.920 --> 2:30:04.920]  former cnn host and gun control advocate pierce morgan
[2:30:04.920 --> 2:30:09.320]  has called for all white people who use the n word to be thrown
[2:30:09.320 --> 2:30:13.960]  in jail the debate began yesterday shortly after president barack obama
[2:30:13.960 --> 2:30:17.240]  used the n word during an interview about racism
[2:30:17.240 --> 2:30:23.720]  on the wtf with martin marron podcast racism racism we are not cured of
[2:30:23.720 --> 2:30:30.840]  clearly and it's not just a matter of uh it not being polite to say public
[2:30:30.840 --> 2:30:36.040]  that's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not shortly after
[2:30:36.040 --> 2:30:39.880]  the interview the term n word quickly began trending on twitter
[2:30:39.880 --> 2:30:44.520]  which later resulted in pierce morgan's response to jail all white people who
[2:30:44.520 --> 2:30:47.640]  used the term so i guess since pierce morgan
[2:30:47.640 --> 2:30:51.320]  failed in his attempt to take away our second amendment
[2:30:51.320 --> 2:30:56.760]  now it looks like his eyes are on the first and you can learn more right now

[2:35:13.320 --> 2:35:17.560]  about what he sees in terms of the financial outlook
[2:35:17.560 --> 2:35:21.000]  he sees a an economic collapse coming i'll tell you about that but it will go
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:24.840]  into more detail about that but also the timing that he sees this coming
[2:35:24.840 --> 2:35:29.080]  at but before we do i want to tell you about some of the reviews that we've
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:32.360]  been having about our products of course we've said we get great reviews on them
[2:35:32.360 --> 2:35:35.560]  i want to read you a couple of the reviews that we have on
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:39.880]  survival shield x2 here's one from reef diver
[2:35:39.880 --> 2:35:43.160]  in pennsylvania he says i went to mexico for 11 days
[2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:46.520]  i forgot to bring my x2 along it will never happen again
[2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:49.880]  i feel mentally clear energetic and stronger with x2 i've lost
[2:35:49.880 --> 2:35:55.160]  10 pounds with no problem continue to trim with no change in routine i have a
[2:35:55.160 --> 2:35:59.560]  year more supply which i plan to maintain x2 don't leave the us
[2:35:59.560 --> 2:36:02.680]  without it thank you men for wars here's another one from izzy
[2:36:02.680 --> 2:36:05.880]  in bishop california says this is by far the craziest thing i've ever seen i'd
[2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:09.720]  literally started yesterday after feeling sluggish and tired from my
[2:36:09.720 --> 2:36:14.520]  three-hour drive i got home and pulled the x2 from my mailbox took three drops
[2:36:14.520 --> 2:36:18.120]  and about 45 minutes later i had super energy i never run
[2:36:18.120 --> 2:36:21.800]  and i had to jog about a mile or so to wind down before bed i usually take
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:25.240]  pain meds for my pain and they cloud my mind up a lot
[2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:30.760]  after i take x2 i'm clearheaded focused and my sense of awareness has increased
[2:36:30.760 --> 2:36:33.960]  i can't say anything about long term yet but i will drop a comment about a
[2:36:33.960 --> 2:36:37.560]  month down the road it's your feeling about 65 percent all
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:41.320]  the time like me it will bring you up to 100 percent
[2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:44.200]  it's worth it that's the kind of feedback we've been getting i just
[2:36:44.200 --> 2:36:46.920]  wanted to read you a couple of those and of course we've been out of stock with
[2:36:46.920 --> 2:36:51.080]  x2 now it's a chance to get it because we are we now have gotten in an
[2:36:51.080 --> 2:36:55.320]  emergency supply of it we said last week that uh
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:36:58.440]  we were going to be getting that emergency shipment in it is in now you
[2:36:58.440 --> 2:37:02.200]  can get that at info wars life dot com and again
[2:37:02.200 --> 2:37:06.040]  stock up on it while it's in stock because we sell out from time to time
[2:37:06.040 --> 2:37:09.960]  and if there is an economic collapse or we've got some kind of an emergency it's
[2:37:09.960 --> 2:37:14.760]  going to be hard to get not just food but medicines that you need to maintain
[2:37:14.760 --> 2:37:18.360]  your health let's go to michael snider and michael
[2:37:18.360 --> 2:37:21.800]  you're looking at uh you believe it's going to be an economic collapse soon you
[2:37:21.800 --> 2:37:25.240]  take a bearish outlook on things you prepare for the future
[2:37:25.240 --> 2:37:29.320]  what do you see coming and when do you see it coming
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:32.200]  well as a lawyer i was trained to be level headed
[2:37:32.200 --> 2:37:36.360]  as a lawyer i was trained to come to conclusions based on the evidence
[2:37:36.360 --> 2:37:40.040]  now i've been doing the economic collapse blog dot com since
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:44.360]  2009 and all during that time i've never
[2:37:44.360 --> 2:37:48.760]  issued any kind of alert of any sort but today
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:52.680]  on the alex jones show i'm announcing that i am
[2:37:52.680 --> 2:37:56.840]  issuing a red alert for the last six months
[2:37:56.840 --> 2:38:03.160]  of 2015 i believe that a financial collapse similar to what we saw back in
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:08.840]  2008 a global financial collapse is imminent and when i say imminent i
[2:38:08.840 --> 2:38:12.280]  don't believe i'm not saying in the next 48 hours what i'm
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:17.000]  saying is within the next six months i believe we have entered
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:21.080]  we are entering a danger zone similar to what we entered
[2:38:21.080 --> 2:38:25.080]  in 2008 i believe that we are looking at the
[2:38:25.080 --> 2:38:29.160]  one of the greatest financial bubbles in all of history and i believe it's
[2:38:29.160 --> 2:38:32.040]  about to burst yeah certainly looks like that from
[2:38:32.040 --> 2:38:34.920]  the preparations that our government has been making either
[2:38:34.920 --> 2:38:38.360]  they are the most paranoid people the planet has ever seen
[2:38:38.360 --> 2:38:41.240]  or they've been seeing some kind of an economic collapse coming for quite
[2:38:41.240 --> 2:38:43.880]  some time and we saw this a couple of years ago when they started buying
[2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:48.360]  massive quantities of ammunition and of course it was hollow point ammunition
[2:38:48.360 --> 2:38:52.040]  which is outlawed for use by the military but it's permitted
[2:38:52.040 --> 2:38:55.960]  for use against civilian populations by governments and it's also
[2:38:55.960 --> 2:39:00.120]  the most expensive ammunition that you can buy so they're not getting it for
[2:39:00.120 --> 2:39:02.680]  target practice so we saw them stockpiling that we see them
[2:39:02.680 --> 2:39:06.760]  pushing out military equipment to all of the mayberry
[2:39:06.760 --> 2:39:09.800]  police departments all the small town police departments getting these
[2:39:09.800 --> 2:39:14.280]  m-wraps and armored vehicles militarizing the police it certainly
[2:39:14.280 --> 2:39:20.360]  looks like they are preparing either for a collapse or a crackdown
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:25.240]  yeah and if you just look at the technical indicators my undergraduate
[2:39:25.240 --> 2:39:27.800]  degree before i went to law school my undergraduate degree
[2:39:27.800 --> 2:39:31.080]  is actually in business and in business school
[2:39:31.080 --> 2:39:34.840]  if you took the last six months of what's happened in the financial world
[2:39:34.840 --> 2:39:39.560]  it would be a textbook case for a run-up to a stock market crash for example
[2:39:39.560 --> 2:39:45.320]  if you look at the Buffett indicator it's a ratio of corporate equities to GDP
[2:39:45.320 --> 2:39:48.760]  it's the highest it's ever been in modern american history the only time
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:51.160]  except for one time the only time it's been higher
[2:39:51.160 --> 2:39:55.160]  was right before the dot-com bubble burst in the year 2000
[2:39:55.160 --> 2:39:59.240]  or if you look at price to earnings ratios right now the price to earnings
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:03.160]  ratios over the last six months the only times they've ever been higher in all
[2:40:03.160 --> 2:40:06.440]  of us history were in 1929 right before the stock
[2:40:06.440 --> 2:40:10.200]  market crashed and in the year 2000 right before the stock
[2:40:10.200 --> 2:40:13.240]  market crashed were higher than we were
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:19.400]  even before the the 2008 crash or if you take a look at margin debt
[2:40:19.400 --> 2:40:23.720]  in all of modern american history there's been three great peaks of margin
[2:40:23.720 --> 2:40:25.880]  debt in other words people are borrowing
[2:40:25.880 --> 2:40:29.320]  awesome tremendous amounts of money to buy stocks with which is a really bad
[2:40:29.320 --> 2:40:32.680]  idea but they're doing it the first major peak
[2:40:32.680 --> 2:40:36.680]  was right before the dot-com bubble burst it peaked like crazy and then and then
[2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:41.160]  the market crashed it peaked right before the 2008 crash
[2:40:41.160 --> 2:40:44.920]  we saw a massive peak in margin debt than the market crashed and now the third
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:47.880]  great peak in fact it recently hit a brand new
[2:40:47.880 --> 2:40:51.000]  record high we're also seeing a great divergence
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:55.080]  between the S&P 500 and high yield credit or
[2:40:55.080 --> 2:40:59.880]  high yield bonds this is something we saw in the run-up to 2008 crash
[2:40:59.880 --> 2:41:03.720]  where usually junk bonds and the stock market
[2:41:03.720 --> 2:41:08.600]  they track each other very closely but then leading up to 2008 we saw it sell
[2:41:08.600 --> 2:41:11.400]  them start to diverge the stock market kept going up
[2:41:11.400 --> 2:41:16.520]  while junk bonds started to fall ahead of the crash and so that's happening
[2:41:16.520 --> 2:41:20.920]  again and we're so seeing so many other of these indicators like just like we
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:25.960]  saw in 2008 where we've had an oil price crash
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:30.120]  we've seen a whole bunch of these other indicators
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:33.800]  start to happen with the u.s. dollar rising commodities
[2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:40.200]  prices going down so many of them that have happened before that are
[2:41:40.200 --> 2:41:45.320]  happening once again so leading up to this it's a text book case
[2:41:45.320 --> 2:41:48.920]  for what we would expect leading up to a stock market crash
[2:41:48.920 --> 2:41:53.000]  and you know you had a over the weekend we had an article that you had written
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  that we put up on info wars.com Lindsey Williams, Martin Armstrong and
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  Alex Jones all warned about what is coming in the fall of 2015 and of
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:04.360]  course Alex had interviewed Martin Armstrong he predicted very
[2:42:04.360 --> 2:42:07.880]  accurately a previous market activity with his
[2:42:07.880 --> 2:42:12.520]  econometric model we had that video and when you look at
[2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:15.400]  what's happening when you look at the all the different indicators that you're
[2:42:15.400 --> 2:42:19.400]  looking at and even the broader simpler indicators of the
[2:42:19.400 --> 2:42:23.400]  fact that they keep pumping money into the world economy
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:26.760]  and it isn't doing anything it's just laying there dead
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:30.520]  they can't take the interest rates any lower to stimulate the economy
[2:42:30.520 --> 2:42:33.640]  they're talking about negative interest rates they're talking about currency
[2:42:33.640 --> 2:42:37.320]  controls they're getting very desperate we see this happening across
[2:42:37.320 --> 2:42:40.920]  the board people who don't own stocks need to understand that if you even have
[2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:44.200]  any money that's going to get locked up if we have
[2:42:44.200 --> 2:42:47.000]  an economic collapse like this they're already putting
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:50.920]  the pieces into place to lock up your cash to
[2:42:50.920 --> 2:42:55.400]  confiscate confiscate your cash out of the out of your bank account that's
[2:42:55.400 --> 2:42:58.040]  what people are afraid of in Greece that's why they pulled out
[2:42:58.040 --> 2:43:01.240]  over four billion euros in just one week in Greece because they thought that
[2:43:01.240 --> 2:43:04.280]  was going to happen this last week we still don't know what's going to
[2:43:04.280 --> 2:43:08.120]  happen in Greece. Oh absolutely and but what's
[2:43:08.120 --> 2:43:12.040]  happening in Greece now is just a preview of what's coming to the entire
[2:43:12.040 --> 2:43:15.480]  planet here in the United States the ball as you mentioned the velocity of
[2:43:15.480 --> 2:43:19.320]  money has dropped to the lowest level in modern American history
[2:43:19.320 --> 2:43:23.240]  normally in a healthy economy money flows very freely I buy something from
[2:43:23.240 --> 2:43:26.200]  you you buy something from someone else and money circulates
[2:43:26.200 --> 2:43:29.640]  but in an unhealthy economy the velocity of money
[2:43:29.640 --> 2:43:33.800]  goes down and we've seen the velocity of money keep dropping and dropping dropping
[2:43:33.800 --> 2:43:37.800]  now it's the lowest level it's been in in modern American history and so
[2:43:37.800 --> 2:43:41.880]  yes as you mentioned we've seen so many others start to say
[2:43:41.880 --> 2:43:45.240]  start to point to the last half of this year Lindsey Williams
[2:43:45.240 --> 2:43:50.760]  he recently said this quote my elite friend indicated that we that that that
[2:43:50.760 --> 2:43:54.200]  they have a worldwide financial collapse scheduled between September
[2:43:54.200 --> 2:43:57.640]  and the end of December 2015 Martin Armstrong as you mentioned he's been
[2:43:57.640 --> 2:44:02.120]  pointing to the year 2015.75 is what he calls it
[2:44:02.120 --> 2:44:05.640]  referring to the fall of this year he's been pointing to
[2:44:05.640 --> 2:44:10.040]  that his economic model has been pointing to that for decades actually
[2:44:10.040 --> 2:44:15.160]  to this moment that's coming up. Alex Jones recently issued a video
[2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:19.560]  warning which went viral all over the world warning about
[2:44:19.560 --> 2:44:24.600]  what's coming next Bible prophecy expert Joel Rosenberg
[2:44:24.600 --> 2:44:30.280]  he recently issued a warning in which he said quote
[2:44:30.280 --> 2:44:34.840]  something is coming I don't know what but we all must be ready in every possible
[2:44:34.840 --> 2:44:38.120]  way so it's not just me that's pointing to what's ahead
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:43.240]  but all over the internet prominent voices are speaking out things I've been
[2:44:43.240 --> 2:44:46.360]  told publicly things I've been told privately that I can't share at this
[2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:50.600]  time things you know what I'm basing this
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:54.280]  red alert I've never done this before but I'm missing this red alert
[2:44:54.280 --> 2:44:58.200]  not based on what one or two people are saying not one or two indicators
[2:44:58.200 --> 2:45:02.280]  but on the totality of what I've learned the totality of my research
[2:45:02.280 --> 2:45:06.520]  what what I've been told I've written more than 1,300 articles on the economic
[2:45:06.520 --> 2:45:10.440]  collapse blog alone about the coming financial crisis
[2:45:10.440 --> 2:45:15.560]  but I've decided this is the moment to warn the people
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:20.920]  that a financial crisis is imminent that it's coming and it's not gonna
[2:45:20.920 --> 2:45:24.360]  our problems are not going to end at the end of 2015 this is going to lead into
[2:45:24.360 --> 2:45:29.160]  2016 and beyond I believe the worst period of time
[2:45:29.160 --> 2:45:36.600]  in modern American history is coming and as the next few years roll along
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:41.000]  and so you know I know a lot of people they've gotten complacent
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:44.360]  they don't have a sense of urgency a lot of preppers they used to prep but they
[2:45:44.360 --> 2:45:47.240]  said oh well things seem like they're going to be okay so I'm not going to do
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:50.840]  that anymore you get lured into this kind of complacency
[2:45:50.840 --> 2:45:54.040]  don't you yeah oh absolutely it's a normal C
[2:45:54.040 --> 2:45:56.760]  bias where people think well nothing has happened you know
[2:45:56.760 --> 2:46:01.000]  so nothing is going to happen but I'm telling you we're heading for a cliff
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:03.720]  and we're about to go off you know you talked about all these
[2:46:03.720 --> 2:46:07.160]  different indications talked about how Martin Armstrong's been talking about
[2:46:07.160 --> 2:46:13.160]  2015 0.75 in other words last quarter of 2015 for a long time
[2:46:13.160 --> 2:46:16.200]  one of the first reports I did when I came to info wars was about a book
[2:46:16.200 --> 2:46:18.760]  called the fourth turning of Strauss and how I don't know if you've heard of
[2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:23.000]  them or not but of course they have a cyclical
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:26.680]  interpretation of history and they take it back to the 1600s because
[2:46:26.680 --> 2:46:30.520]  and going through American and English history
[2:46:30.520 --> 2:46:34.760]  looking at this generational cycle there's like a you know four generations
[2:46:34.760 --> 2:46:38.440]  and like every year 80 years they see a massive
[2:46:38.440 --> 2:46:42.600]  upheaval a massive change they were saying 20 years ago that they were
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:46.040]  looking at a time frame it was around 2020 for
[2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:50.520]  a massive upheaval similar to the civil war similar to
[2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:54.680]  world war two similar to the war of independence so
[2:46:54.680 --> 2:46:58.600]  you know they're looking at this type of upheaval and at the same time we've
[2:46:58.600 --> 2:47:03.800]  been hearing from all these futurists about 2020 2020 is the year that
[2:47:03.800 --> 2:47:07.880]  all the robots are going to be online we aren't going to have any jobs I mean
[2:47:07.880 --> 2:47:11.400]  we've seen all of these different projections from so many different
[2:47:11.400 --> 2:47:15.480]  corners looking at the time period from about 2015 to
[2:47:15.480 --> 2:47:19.240]  2025 where we are going to see this massive
[2:47:19.240 --> 2:47:24.520]  upheaval massive revolution so this is coming from a lot of different quarters
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:28.120]  yeah I even wrote an entire article about economic cycle theories it's just
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:31.800]  not a couple these there's like you know about
[2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:36.600]  six of these major theories which all point to the period between 2015 and
[2:47:36.600 --> 2:47:40.920]  2020 as a period of extreme upheaval economic
[2:47:40.920 --> 2:47:45.000]  collapse terrible times so it's funny how all these
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:48.600]  theories from actually a secular point of view are pointing to this
[2:47:48.600 --> 2:47:53.480]  and then on the alternative end this time period also corresponds with them
[2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:57.480]  some things that people are pointing to spiritually for example
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:48:01.080]  we've got the end of the Shemitah cycle
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:03.960]  your listeners many of your listeners are probably familiar with this the
[2:48:03.960 --> 2:48:07.960]  seven-year biblical cycle which comes every seven years
[2:48:07.960 --> 2:48:11.800]  and the funny thing is at the end of the last two Shemitah cycles
[2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:16.280]  September 17th 2001 was the last day of a Shemitah
[2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:19.960]  cycle the seven-year biblical cycle on the very last day
[2:48:19.960 --> 2:48:24.360]  elul 29 on the biblical calendar the day right before Rosh Hashanah
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:29.480]  that we saw the greatest one-day stock market crash in all of US history up
[2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:32.920]  until that time and that record held for exactly
[2:48:32.920 --> 2:48:37.800]  seven years until seven years later September 29th 2008
[2:48:37.800 --> 2:48:41.080]  once again elul 29 on the biblical calendar to the day
[2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:47.160]  right before Rosh Hashanah the Dow fell by 777 points
[2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:50.920]  once again the greatest stock market crash in all US history up until that
[2:48:50.920 --> 2:48:53.480]  time now we're in a new Shemitah cycle
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:58.920]  it began last fall it ends on September 13th 2015 now that's a Sunday so the
[2:48:58.920 --> 2:49:02.840]  stock market's not going to crash on that day but we're coming up to the end of
[2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:06.040]  another one of these cycles so many people are wondering
[2:49:06.040 --> 2:49:09.480]  what's going to happen that's very interesting you know you had a
[2:49:09.480 --> 2:49:13.960]  when you start talking about cycles and signs I thought it's very interesting
[2:49:13.960 --> 2:49:17.720]  this article that you had just yesterday why is NASA
[2:49:17.720 --> 2:49:21.080]  working on a way to destroy asteroids using nuclear weapons they're working
[2:49:21.080 --> 2:49:24.440]  with the national nuclear security administration I've never even heard of
[2:49:24.440 --> 2:49:27.240]  that Michael they're working on a way
[2:49:27.240 --> 2:49:30.840]  straight out of the movies that you pointed out Armageddon and these other
[2:49:30.840 --> 2:49:34.200]  movies from 10 20 years ago where they would
[2:49:34.200 --> 2:49:37.400]  send a crew up to put nuclear explosives on an
[2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:39.400]  asteroid that was headed towards the earth
[2:49:39.400 --> 2:49:43.080]  apparently they're they're working on this now this is reported by the wasn't
[2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:45.400]  it the New York Times that reported this
[2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:48.840]  yeah the New York Times reported how NASA is teaming up with the national
[2:49:48.840 --> 2:49:52.600]  nuclear security administration figure out a way to use nuclear weapons against
[2:49:52.600 --> 2:49:55.160]  asteroids well immediately I had flashbacks
[2:49:55.160 --> 2:49:59.080]  the deep impact and Armageddon a couple movies I love back in the 1990s
[2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:03.800]  yeah but this seems very very strange to me because just a couple weeks ago
[2:50:03.800 --> 2:50:09.320]  NASA came out and said they held a whole deal where they came out and
[2:50:09.320 --> 2:50:13.560]  now publicly announced quote no asteroid or comet
[2:50:13.560 --> 2:50:18.360]  is currently on a collision course with earth and they also said quote
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:21.240]  no large object is likely to strike the earth
[2:50:21.240 --> 2:50:25.320]  anytime in the next several hundred years so that's what they said publicly
[2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:27.960]  but then they're all of a sudden they're trying to figure out a way to
[2:50:27.960 --> 2:50:31.560]  destroy asteroids with nuclear weapons well that would seem to me that that's
[2:50:31.560 --> 2:50:34.600]  a a tremendous waste of time effort and money if
[2:50:34.600 --> 2:50:38.520]  there's absolutely no threat out there at all and actually earlier this year
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:42.520]  NASA held a whole big practice scenario about what
[2:50:42.520 --> 2:50:46.040]  would happen if an asteroid was was coming so it seems like their actions
[2:50:46.040 --> 2:50:49.240]  and their words aren't quite matching up it's interesting when they make that
[2:50:49.240 --> 2:50:52.120]  pronouncement uh uninvited oh i just want to let you know
[2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:54.200]  you don't have anything to worry about this i mean while you're training for

[2:52:08.520 --> 2:52:13.800]  because the companies i've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't
[2:52:13.800 --> 2:52:19.400]  as affordable as they should be so i refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the
[2:52:19.400 --> 2:52:26.040]  years will then about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms hd firearms.com
[2:52:26.040 --> 2:52:31.080]  own and run by a bunch of former navy seals special ops people their veterans their patriots
[2:52:31.080 --> 2:52:35.880]  their listeners of the radio show and they want to support the broadcast it's always about security

[2:53:05.160 --> 2:53:10.600]  mine is falling apart hey did you know there's a company called id stronghold that makes shielded
[2:53:10.600 --> 2:53:14.440]  wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing oh i didn't realize there was such a thing as
[2:53:14.440 --> 2:53:19.080]  electronic pickpocketing what is that well apparently many of the new credit and debit
[2:53:19.080 --> 2:53:24.680]  cards being issued have radio chips inside them called rfid the transmitter banking information
[2:53:24.680 --> 2:53:29.960]  to card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around
[2:53:29.960 --> 2:53:34.280]  the city scanning people collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without
[2:53:34.280 --> 2:53:39.480]  us knowing it wow that sounds scary since you're getting a new wallet anyway you should definitely
[2:53:39.480 --> 2:53:44.680]  get an id stronghold shielded wallet are they more expensive no in fact i can get a shielded
[2:53:44.680 --> 2:53:49.560]  leather wallet from id stronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded
[2:53:49.560 --> 2:53:54.600]  wallets from other stores sounds great my wallet isn't falling apart yet but let me pick one out
[2:53:54.600 --> 2:54:10.520]  too i want to be protected and these wallets at idstronghold.com look fantastic
[2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:17.400]  welcome back to the alex jump show i'm david knight and joining me is
[2:54:18.360 --> 2:54:22.840]  martin uh sorry michael snider i'm looking at martin armstrong's predictions here michael
[2:54:22.840 --> 2:54:28.840]  snider is joining us from the economic collapse blog.com he's a frequent contributor to info wars
[2:54:28.840 --> 2:54:33.320]  dot com we've been talking about some of his recent articles and of course in the last segment we
[2:54:33.320 --> 2:54:40.840]  were talking about how technocrats and globalists like ray Kurzweil have been looking forward to
[2:54:40.840 --> 2:54:47.240]  the time frame between 2015 and 2025 where they were going to see massive societal change we've
[2:54:47.240 --> 2:54:53.640]  seen the same thing from people who observe cycles of history cycles within society people
[2:54:53.640 --> 2:54:59.240]  like strauss and howe who wrote the fourth turning the fourth turning being the fourth generation
[2:54:59.240 --> 2:55:05.400]  where you have massive appeal usually resulting not always but usually resulting in a massive war
[2:55:05.400 --> 2:55:11.400]  something like world war two and then of course we also have different economic indicators that
[2:55:11.400 --> 2:55:16.280]  are all lining up that was what michael snider was just talking about martin armstrong's cycles
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:22.280]  all the different uh stock market indicators that start to point to an economic collapse
[2:55:22.280 --> 2:55:28.600]  this year latter part of the fall as well as some of the biblical cycles pointing to this
[2:55:29.800 --> 2:55:35.160]  upcoming september as being a significant time so i want to talk to you michael about
[2:55:35.720 --> 2:55:40.280]  what people should do to prepare give us an idea because you've been thinking about this you are
[2:55:40.280 --> 2:55:46.440]  a bear on this you are preparing uh what to do you you wrote a book called get prepared tell us
[2:55:46.440 --> 2:55:51.080]  what to do uh what what people should be doing to prepare for this kind of appeal
[2:55:52.360 --> 2:55:57.000]  yeah in order to get prepared a lot of it is common sense for example i encourage people to
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:56:02.760]  have an emergency fund that can cover at least six months of your bills so that if you do lose a job
[2:56:02.760 --> 2:56:06.680]  if your business goes sour that you're going to be able to pay the mortgage you're going to be
[2:56:06.680 --> 2:56:11.400]  able to pay the bills you're going to be able to survive in the midst of chaos all around us
[2:56:11.400 --> 2:56:16.920]  you know because a survey came out just the other day 30 percent of americans don't have a single penny
[2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:21.160]  of savings of emergency savings so when the crisis comes what's going to happen to them
[2:56:21.160 --> 2:56:25.800]  they're going to be it's going to be a disaster almost immediately i'm also a big believer in
[2:56:25.800 --> 2:56:31.560]  storing up food and and supplies and everything that you would need for a longer term crisis now
[2:56:31.560 --> 2:56:35.320]  that's a little bit more down the road but i'm a big believer of that and anything you can do to
[2:56:35.320 --> 2:56:40.120]  become more independent of the system learning to grow a garden that's a way to become less dependent
[2:56:40.120 --> 2:56:44.840]  on the system having your own fruits and vegetables so you don't have to go and get them at the store
[2:56:44.840 --> 2:56:49.240]  whatever you can do for home security and self-defense i believe we're moving into a time
[2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:53.400]  we're going to see great civil unrest in our cities crime is going to rise people are going to become
[2:56:53.400 --> 2:56:57.640]  more desperate so you need to start thinking about how what are you going to do for your own
[2:56:57.640 --> 2:57:02.440]  home defense things of that nature but then let me talk about financial preparation because that's
[2:57:02.440 --> 2:57:07.400]  what a lot of people are concerned about our banking system our financial system is extremely
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:13.480]  vulnerable so you don't want to be exposed to the stock market you don't want to be have a retirement
[2:57:13.480 --> 2:57:18.040]  plan which is potentially exposed and you don't want to put all of your eggs in one basket or one
[2:57:18.040 --> 2:57:23.960]  bank because let me tell you a little bit about the banks today um you know the last crisis the
[2:57:23.960 --> 2:57:28.040]  banks were played a starring role in it they're right at the center and we are told the problem
[2:57:28.040 --> 2:57:33.000]  of too big to fail would be solved well unfortunately it hasn't been solved in fact it's gotten even
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:39.080]  worse in fact since the last crisis the four largest banks in the united states have collectively
[2:57:39.080 --> 2:57:45.560]  gotten 40 percent larger meanwhile 1400 smaller banks have totally gone out of existence so the
[2:57:45.560 --> 2:57:51.800]  problem too big fail is now greater than ever but meanwhile these big banks you know they're so
[2:57:51.800 --> 2:57:55.560]  important they made mistakes last time you think they would learn the less their lessons no
[2:57:55.560 --> 2:58:01.480]  instead they become far more reckless than ever in fact the there's the five of the two big to
[2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:06.760]  fail banks i'm talking about jp morgan chase city bank goldman sacks bank of america morgan stanley
[2:58:07.320 --> 2:58:14.840]  each one of them has exposure to derivatives of at least 38 trillion dollars jp morgan chase the
[2:58:14.840 --> 2:58:19.560]  biggest has total exposure to derivatives of more than 63 trillion dollars while they only
[2:58:19.560 --> 2:58:25.240]  have total assets of about 2.6 trillion dollars amazing that very important information we're
