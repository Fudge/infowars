[00:00.000 --> 00:12.060]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.060 --> 00:19.600]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.600 --> 00:30.160]  Texas Alex Jones okay we are emailing back and forth Roseanne Barr right now
[00:30.160 --> 00:33.720]  who has said that rich people that don't give up their wealth should be putting
[00:33.720 --> 00:41.840]  reeducation camps obviously I want to interview her and she could come on
[00:41.840 --> 00:46.920]  while we're alive it could be a taped interview I don't know she just sent out
[00:46.920 --> 00:50.600]  a bunch of different times to us minutes before the show so look for that to be
[00:50.600 --> 00:56.880]  popping in any minute now or this afternoon or tomorrow but boy I certainly
[00:56.880 --> 01:02.000]  want to get that fish in the boat Ray McGovern has got an article out saying
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.920]  that it looks like Israel may be green lighting an attack on Iran that will
[01:05.920 --> 01:13.000]  sure put the turmoil in the world into overdrive to say the least former CIA
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.600]  analyst will be joining us also freeway Ricky Ross I thought it'd be good to get
[01:17.600 --> 01:24.080]  him on the last 30 minutes of the show today because mr. Ross some days it was
[01:24.080 --> 01:28.760]  40 50 million dollars a day in cocaine being brought into and to sell into
[01:28.760 --> 01:33.480]  California by the CIA Gary Webb the Pulitzer prize winner helped expose all
[01:33.480 --> 01:36.720]  of that mr. Ross has been out of prison for a while but they're trying to put
[01:36.720 --> 01:39.800]  him back in right now he's been shooting his mouth off about government
[01:39.800 --> 01:43.120]  drug dealing they've been telling keep his mouth shut I want to get his take on
[01:43.120 --> 01:47.280]  fast and furious because you know it's in the federal court filings in Chicago
[01:47.280 --> 01:51.600]  and other areas and it's been on the El Paso times Houston Chronicles San Francisco
[01:51.600 --> 01:58.120]  papers have reported on it Houston again I had has reported on it the Chicago
[01:58.120 --> 02:05.200]  Tribune has reported on it but it's just minor footnotes that the DEA FBI ATF and
[02:05.200 --> 02:10.720]  four other agencies knowingly help them get the tons of cocaine in Sinaloa and
[02:10.720 --> 02:15.400]  others big cartels and then give them the weapons and we've now learned in
[02:15.400 --> 02:18.640]  congressional testimony what we told you years ago it's totally confirmed now
[02:18.640 --> 02:25.200]  that the ATF didn't just order gun shops to let them set up cameras and track
[02:25.200 --> 02:29.640]  where guns were going that was just a cover so the gun shop wouldn't get wise
[02:29.640 --> 02:36.480]  it was ATF agents coming in buying the guns with US government taxpayer money
[02:36.480 --> 02:41.040]  and then going and giving it to Sinaloa to knock out the enemy to make sure that
[02:41.040 --> 02:47.880]  500 bill went directly into JP Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs Bank of America
[02:47.880 --> 02:53.480]  Wacovia Wells Fargo and others who've all on record been caught off and on
[02:53.480 --> 02:58.320]  laundering the cash so that's what it was all about because of course they
[02:58.320 --> 03:00.800]  could have just had the Pentagon give them the weapons like they did in South
[03:00.800 --> 03:04.840]  East Asia or they did in Columbia or Nicaragua El Salvador to control the
[03:04.840 --> 03:10.280]  goodies they want to run into your kids veins and up their nose but they needed
[03:10.280 --> 03:14.720]  to have the double goodie because it's easy it's more fun to knock out drug
[03:14.720 --> 03:19.520]  cartels create more of a monopoly launder the money control society and
[03:19.520 --> 03:23.280]  have your kids overdose and get put in coffins that's that's fun that's
[03:23.280 --> 03:29.160]  that's good for the globalist but it's not as good and it's it's also fun to
[03:29.160 --> 03:32.760]  have the troops publicly on TV admit they grow the opium and supply the
[03:32.760 --> 03:36.840]  fertilizer in Afghanistan and put it on the news in your face that's how you
[03:36.840 --> 03:40.480]  pimp the public so you just totally break will and everybody submit to you
[03:40.480 --> 03:46.320]  you just bring out the open they deal the drugs no no it's more important that
[03:46.320 --> 03:50.120]  while you give the guns of the cartels to knock out the competition that you
[03:50.120 --> 03:55.960]  blame the second amendment that's always the cherry on top that's the that's
[03:55.960 --> 04:02.120]  the crème de la crème the cout de gras that's the checkered flag that's the
[04:02.120 --> 04:08.120]  triple crown that's the trifecta that's the royal flush that that's the that's
[04:08.120 --> 04:15.840]  the real the real good part that's that that that's the best bite as they say
[04:15.840 --> 04:23.560]  that the absolute sock of the gravy is to murder this country and murder
[04:23.560 --> 04:27.520]  freedom and ship drugs in and then use that drug war to take everybody's
[04:27.520 --> 04:31.920]  rights and set up checkpoints and send dumb idiot users to prison to learn how
[04:31.920 --> 04:34.680]  to build widgets and learn how to be good criminals at the criminal
[04:34.680 --> 04:38.000]  universities the globalists have set up owned by big mega banks that launder the
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.040]  drug money but then when you get to blame the second amendment man that's
[04:43.040 --> 04:50.280]  just a yeah that's just so good so good criminal so hard core and the public
[04:50.280 --> 04:55.080]  loves it we're gonna be right back we got a big transmission lined up today

[08:48.080 --> 08:53.880]  Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush he says that the green light the
[08:53.880 --> 09:03.840]  window is open for a Israeli strike on Tehran and other areas of Iran Iran has
[09:03.840 --> 09:09.240]  said they're going to then strike Tel Aviv and we are off to the races and

[09:19.280 --> 09:23.840]  tried to get a green light to start attacking Syria the first time in a
[09:23.840 --> 09:28.520]  long time I'll go with that come a minute China and Russia have vetoed that
[09:28.520 --> 09:36.720]  in the Security Council so the drums of war are beating in the background and
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.440]  getting louder and louder as the constellations politically and
[09:40.440 --> 09:45.600]  geopolitically align societally for global economic implosion and the
[09:45.600 --> 09:50.600]  birth of world government as all of this happens you notice that war is
[09:50.600 --> 09:59.560]  entering the the the the starfield here and we are not in Kansas any more you're
[09:59.560 --> 10:06.240]  just going to see things get crazier and crazier from here on out and the top
[10:06.240 --> 10:13.160]  cocaine dealer for the CIA in California upwards of 40 to 50 million a day
[10:13.160 --> 10:17.280]  Pulitzer prize-winning author of Gary Webb of course helped expose all that
[10:17.280 --> 10:20.840]  he's gotten out of prison free Ricky Ross has been persecuted for speaking
[10:20.840 --> 10:24.480]  out about government drug dealing and they're talking about throwing him back

[10:34.040 --> 10:38.920]  then why is the CIA not in trouble see let's I can't have this dual
[10:38.920 --> 10:47.520]  schizophrenic hypocrite crime stop brain like some of you you see I'm actually
[10:47.520 --> 10:52.040]  mad at the people that made this illegal that have energized organized crime in
[10:52.040 --> 10:56.840]  our country just like in the nine and a half years of prohibition that built the
[10:56.840 --> 11:02.480]  modern crime syndicates that really run our country today and since I went to
[11:02.480 --> 11:05.320]  hot springs Arkansas to research and I'm gonna do a report on this coming up
[11:05.320 --> 11:10.520]  we've just been so busy there they are at their local historical centers
[11:10.520 --> 11:18.800]  admitting that the US government basically with Al Capone bugsy seagull
[11:18.800 --> 11:26.520]  lucky Luciano all those guys they shipped everclear out in quote bottled
[11:26.520 --> 11:38.040]  water water cooler tanks to basically US government controlled G men controlled
[11:38.040 --> 11:42.520]  speakeasies around the country and then the entire drug war was just to shut
[11:42.520 --> 11:50.000]  down the other the other speakeasies the entire drug war because they made
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.920]  alcohol a controlled drug substance and then that's that's all that's happening
[11:53.920 --> 11:58.360]  today with fast and furious and the rest of it but this is mainline history
[11:58.360 --> 12:02.920]  it's just buried just incredible go the little historical centers there and get
[12:02.920 --> 12:06.720]  the tours and it's all just admitted in hot springs Arkansas that's what built
[12:06.720 --> 12:10.800]  that gorgeous town there in the middle of nowhere was because they decided to
[12:10.800 --> 12:14.520]  run their operation out of there because most of the gangsters and the
[12:14.520 --> 12:18.440]  Rockefellers and people I all had syphilis from you know two or three
[12:18.440 --> 12:22.000]  hookers a day and of course it hadn't been cured there in the main syphilis
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.040]  treatment center where they even developed some of the modern well
[12:25.040 --> 12:29.200]  precursors to modern cures and treatments for syphilis were carried out there
[12:29.200 --> 12:32.200]  and they were all there fighting syphilis for a decade and they said we'll
[12:32.200 --> 12:36.200]  just run the whole hop out of here and it was like high five baby and then of
[12:36.200 --> 12:39.840]  course they later burned Capone a few of the gangsters because the Rockefellers
[12:39.840 --> 12:45.120]  wanted the full cut for themselves and and the local historical societies this
[12:45.120 --> 12:49.320]  is all just absolute fact there's all these books about it there and it's all
[12:49.320 --> 12:57.960]  real cutesy they're not even reporting on this to to they're not even reporting
[12:57.960 --> 13:02.280]  on this to like say the Rockefellers are bad they're all reporting on it just
[13:02.280 --> 13:10.480]  like well but everybody knows that the dice are loaded everybody knows that the
[13:10.480 --> 13:15.360]  war is over everybody knows the good guys lost there's actually kind of a
[13:15.360 --> 13:18.480]  cuteness where well that's what built our town it's kind of funny you know
[13:18.480 --> 13:24.120]  haha the US government ran the whole thing with the with the Rockefellers
[13:24.120 --> 13:34.160]  who'd you know they were making a hundred million a month in 1920s money they
[13:34.160 --> 13:40.960]  really know how to run an op don't they they really know how to get the job done
[13:40.960 --> 13:48.460]  on the general public okay before I start digressing off here let me just do
[13:48.460 --> 13:59.480]  this let me just go over some of the headlines here we've now gotten the
[13:59.480 --> 14:06.360]  numbers Republican White House hopeful Rick Perry raised 17 million in 49 days
[14:06.360 --> 14:12.520]  drudges learn topping everybody including Mitt the carbon taxer socialist
[14:12.520 --> 14:16.160]  healthcare creator Romney who Republicans absolutely have a love
[14:16.160 --> 14:20.920]  that's because they love being being schmucks 347 thousand dollars per day
[14:20.920 --> 14:27.520]  from 20,000 unique donors from all 50 states DC Puerto Rico Guam with more
[14:27.520 --> 14:35.320]  than half of the donors living outside of Texas this is a drudge exclusive
[14:35.320 --> 14:40.720]  continuing Romney says Wall Street protest or class warfare well actually
[14:40.720 --> 14:45.020]  the Democrats have tried to hijack the Occupy Wall Street movement and make it
[14:45.020 --> 14:49.280]  class warfare and make sure people don't actually go after the Federal Reserve I
[14:49.280 --> 14:52.880]  have now I'm gonna talk more about this later in the broadcast discovered
[14:52.880 --> 14:59.640]  exactly what happened it's true that NPR CBS ABC CNN I was watching the news this
[14:59.640 --> 15:05.080]  morning and my wife's listening NPR they are going to these events and picking
[15:05.080 --> 15:09.360]  out the Foundation operatives to call for socialism to call for an
[15:09.360 --> 15:16.200]  end to capitalism to call for all this but the general people that are there
[15:16.200 --> 15:20.480]  are pretty much in the Fedders anti-globalists who don't want all this
[15:20.480 --> 15:27.440]  banker bailout to Wall Street now the official quote Occupy Wall Street that's
[15:27.440 --> 15:30.960]  that's that's much of foundation trying to organize the people they have issued
[15:30.960 --> 15:36.080]  their listed demands and it is George Soros land socialist health care giant
[15:36.080 --> 15:41.680]  minimum wages totally open borders so our original summation that it was
[15:41.680 --> 15:46.800]  taken over by the big unions and everybody it's happened but that doesn't
[15:46.800 --> 15:51.520]  mean that the majority of people on the ground aren't actually informed it just
[15:51.520 --> 15:57.360]  the the corporate or media knows how to show up with fraud and declare that the
[15:57.360 --> 16:00.880]  people want want socialism and a new world order and all the rest of it and
[16:00.880 --> 16:05.480]  then that becomes a feedback loop as then the unions and everybody starting to
[16:05.480 --> 16:10.440]  day nationwide fully take it all over and say down with Wall Street raise taxes
[16:10.440 --> 16:14.200]  on the middle class to get the rich guys and Warren Buffett says yes that's how
[16:14.200 --> 16:17.880]  you get me you raise taxes on the middle class and then I'm exempt from the tax
[16:17.880 --> 16:24.320]  and you pay it to me in bailout money so that's going on
[16:25.880 --> 16:31.560]  continuing a Perry is plummeting Herman Cain is surging and so they're just
[16:31.560 --> 16:37.520]  putting out another former Federal Reserve head in Kansas City guy who wants
[16:37.520 --> 16:41.280]  a sales tax a national sales tax on top of the income tax I told you when they
[16:41.280 --> 16:44.560]  finally got it up to get try to pass it they would say oh guess what we've got
[16:44.560 --> 16:49.280]  to keep the the income tax for Social Security at 9 to 10% and then of course
[16:49.280 --> 16:52.640]  they'll raise it later and of course that's why he's got his 9 9 9 plan three
[16:52.640 --> 16:56.880]  different 9% taxes and they'll all be raised that was always the plan you were
[16:56.880 --> 17:00.720]  like no it will not be we won't it will not be you gotta go to the IRS I told
[17:00.720 --> 17:04.400]  you the IMF and World Bank do this in every country they take over and go into
[17:04.400 --> 17:09.120]  austerity okay I mean they're following a boyfriend I'm telling you I've got their
[17:09.120 --> 17:12.240]  playbook I've shown it to you I've shown you that I know what they're gonna do
[17:12.240 --> 17:19.560]  next over and over and over again so all of you neocon radio listeners you got
[17:19.560 --> 17:26.720]  conned again okay just like you idiot Obama supporters who think well the
[17:26.720 --> 17:30.640]  Democratic Party's still good but Obama's bad well they're really beating the drum
[17:30.640 --> 17:34.000]  now for him to not seek reelection it's in the Washington Post again that is the
[17:34.000 --> 17:39.360]  CIA organ of the Democratic Party and they're saying step down we need to put
[17:39.360 --> 17:45.320]  a new fresh puppet up there to try to fool people because we got to get this
[17:45.320 --> 17:49.280]  agenda going here and then that new public and step in with all the
[17:49.280 --> 17:52.960]  emergency powers and the super Congress everything for them and then they'll
[17:52.960 --> 17:56.040]  carry the ball down the field they'll take that running back out and put a new
[17:56.040 --> 17:59.320]  one in a Republican
[18:00.440 --> 18:04.960]  you're watching the game it's a game it's a it's a staged event and then
[18:04.960 --> 18:08.280]  there's a guy trying to get on the field called Ron Paul who's who's never
[18:08.280 --> 18:11.640]  played the game and you're like oh no he's not allowed on the field media said
[18:11.640 --> 18:18.240]  so here's one of the Washington Post opposition to Obama grows strongly
[18:18.240 --> 18:25.040]  there it is opposition to Obama grows strongly for intent America strongly
[18:25.040 --> 18:28.360]  disapprove how the president is handling the job of president and then you get
[18:28.360 --> 18:32.240]  deeper into the poll the vast majority he's down to almost 25 percent approval
[18:32.240 --> 18:37.200]  rating you do it across the board of you if you ask him do you disagree some so
[18:37.200 --> 18:45.120]  all of that is going on real clear politics excuse Ron Paul poll numbers
[18:45.120 --> 18:49.360]  we got a report on that star ledger that shows how they manipulate that it's
[18:49.360 --> 18:53.880]  another example of how they try to try to lower his poll numbers through through
[18:53.880 --> 19:01.320]  manipulation continuing Salete says Obama will win if Republicans pick
[19:01.320 --> 19:06.000]  establishment candidate absolutely Ron Paul in every poll is either tied or
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.840]  beating Barack Obama and in that heiress poll last week the scientific he's
[19:10.840 --> 19:15.360]  really getting a bigger and bigger lead but again most blue blood mainline
[19:15.360 --> 19:20.240]  Republicans they like being conned for them it's whoever has the nicest suit
[19:20.240 --> 19:24.840]  and prances around and smiles the person introduces them and then they say
[19:24.840 --> 19:30.840]  that looks like a good Ken doll he's for social self-care kind of like that yeah
[19:30.840 --> 19:37.040]  he's for regulating the internet ooh he's the for carbon taxes I like that I

[24:44.720 --> 24:49.520]  rich people cutting their heads off I know she's a comedian so I want to give
[24:49.520 --> 24:55.600]  her a chance to respond if that was serious what she was talking about on
[24:55.600 --> 25:00.280]  Max Kaiser show so I look forward to interviewing her and and hopefully
[25:00.280 --> 25:03.200]  having a serious discussion with her because it was one of the biggest
[25:03.200 --> 25:10.240]  stories in the country Sunday Monday and Tuesday now here we are on Wednesday so
[25:10.240 --> 25:20.240]  I look forward to talking to her coming up in the third hour today now
[25:20.240 --> 25:25.040]  continuing here I will get more into what it means that the Democrats are
[25:25.040 --> 25:33.000]  attempting to flush Barack Hussein Obama down the collectivist toilet bowl now
[25:33.000 --> 25:41.840]  they could still have him rise as a phoenix and we enter the prime vector area
[25:41.840 --> 25:54.040]  right now we're entering the zone right now of stage false flag tear we're
[25:54.040 --> 25:58.920]  entering the zone of absolute economic implosion and panics we're entering the
[25:58.920 --> 26:04.920]  zone of Israel blowing the daylights out of military sites and their plans been
[26:04.920 --> 26:09.560]  out for years over 200 sites to be hit with smart bombs bunker busters
[26:09.560 --> 26:17.280]  super bunker busters you name it and Iran is going to go completely ape there's
[26:17.280 --> 26:19.960]  not going to be any need for the globalist to stage terror attacks they're
[26:19.960 --> 26:25.280]  going to use asymmetrical warfare and activate Hezbollah cells in Israel and
[26:25.280 --> 26:28.800]  probably in the West and then the establishment is going to use that as
[26:28.800 --> 26:34.720]  an excuse to clamp things down Al Qaeda has reportedly gotten upwards of 10,000
[26:34.720 --> 26:40.320]  heat-seeking missiles in Libya shoulder fired and of course NATO put them in
[26:40.320 --> 26:43.480]  power but that won't matter when they start attacking with those it'll just
[26:43.480 --> 26:46.880]  be we've got to stick our hands down your pants and set up domestic check
[26:46.880 --> 26:51.080]  points because Al Qaeda got thousands of heat-seeking soldiers shoulder launch
[26:51.080 --> 26:58.080]  missiles with one of these a teenager with with with no training just aim it
[26:58.080 --> 27:01.520]  when it starts beeping pull the trigger with this particular type of heat
[27:01.520 --> 27:06.000]  seeker that Gaddafi had a bunch of you just drive out to the airport you can
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.960]  sit there two miles from the airport in you know in in your truck and wait till
[27:10.960 --> 27:14.680]  planes fly over step out and just blow them out of the air all day long it'll
[27:14.680 --> 27:17.960]  go up blow out one of their main engines blow the wing off it'll be a
[27:17.960 --> 27:23.720]  disaster some reports a month ago said 2,000 now they're saying upwards of
[27:23.720 --> 27:33.560]  10,000 shoulder fired heat-seeking missiles turn it on powers up flip the
[27:33.560 --> 27:38.360]  the eyepiece up when it starts beeping and goes to a solid tone it's got its
[27:38.360 --> 27:43.760]  heat seek pull the trigger heat-seeking missile goes out boom goes right into the
[27:43.760 --> 27:48.280]  engine the particular heat seeker I looked up the type they're saying several
[27:48.280 --> 27:53.160]  but the one they got thousands of can go up to 5,000 feet with extreme accuracy
[27:53.160 --> 27:59.000]  8,000 feet with moderate accuracy so you get your plane taken off over here at
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.600]  Austrian Berkstrom or my office is pretty close to and whether it's a
[28:03.600 --> 28:07.560]  terrorist or some criminal mercenary they find to do it or a globalist they
[28:07.560 --> 28:14.640]  just go out wherever it is in the country start shooting down airplanes that
[28:14.640 --> 28:20.120]  would make 9-11 look like child's play in a matter of minutes they could say
[28:20.120 --> 28:26.080]  mmm say at high noon shoot down every aircraft that takes off from every major
[28:26.080 --> 28:29.200]  airport there's planes always landing and taking off you don't have to shoot
[28:29.200 --> 28:33.560]  one that's even taking off of course you can shoot them as they come in for
[28:33.560 --> 28:40.600]  landings and then it crashes into the entire airport then the aircraft can't
[28:40.600 --> 28:47.480]  land that's a special forces dream by the way the Soviets of course trained
[28:47.480 --> 28:52.400]  during a nuclear war to have sleeper cells activate and do just that go out
[28:52.400 --> 28:56.040]  to airports and shoot down the aircraft and then all the planes in the air
[28:56.040 --> 29:01.160]  can't land and it creates total panic some of the other special forces tactics
[29:01.160 --> 29:05.040]  the Russians and the US is trained for is how to go up with simple chemicals
[29:05.040 --> 29:08.800]  into high-rise buildings and dump them into the air conditioning system killing
[29:08.800 --> 29:12.480]  everyone in the building you know the type of chaos that'll create you know
[29:12.480 --> 29:16.920]  what a five-man team can do to a major city in one hour total panic buildings
[29:16.920 --> 29:23.760]  on fire everywhere this is asymmetrical guerrilla warfare you think the TSA
[29:23.760 --> 29:27.320]  sticking their hands down your pants and keep you safe from that you think
[29:27.320 --> 29:30.920]  checkpoints outside the airport real bombers would just attack that
[29:30.920 --> 29:35.920]  checkpoint checkpoints are actually where real terrorists are trained to
[29:35.920 --> 29:39.960]  attack it's all bull none of it has to do with protecting you it's about
[29:39.960 --> 29:45.560]  federalizing all of society now when we come back I'm gonna break down the
[29:45.560 --> 29:51.740]  geopolitical meltdown that's beginning stay with us we're on the March the

[32:14.520 --> 32:19.560]  turned men's influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[32:19.560 --> 32:24.840]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[32:24.840 --> 32:29.400]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[32:29.400 --> 32:34.080]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[32:41.800 --> 32:46.880]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[33:15.280 --> 33:34.280]  the GCN radio network
[33:34.280 --> 33:49.000]  okay I want to get into world news I want to try to calm down a little bit I
[33:49.000 --> 33:59.280]  also want to get on to a krypton dot org article we've got up at info wars.com
[33:59.280 --> 34:04.680]  where they've dug out Apple subsidiary companies that are actually DARPA and
[34:04.680 --> 34:12.800]  and see when I say Google's DARPA or Apple's DARPA I've seen all these
[34:12.800 --> 34:16.760]  documents and read them over the years and seen it in PBS documentaries little
[34:16.760 --> 34:20.320]  mentions and then people are like what's your proof just go to the research
[34:20.320 --> 34:24.240]  it's everywhere you'll find more than I ever found there's a big article on that
[34:24.240 --> 34:30.720]  introducing SIRI DARPA's ghost and apples machine they always planned it
[34:30.720 --> 34:37.440]  turned out with DARPA in the early 1980s with Apple to then have the PC phase out
[34:37.440 --> 34:43.280]  as an alternative have Apple come in and the whole time Apple was actually
[34:43.280 --> 34:46.840]  running programs in the background to try to teach computers to be
[34:46.840 --> 34:52.840]  artificially intelligent it's funny my wife called me about this separately she
[34:52.840 --> 34:58.040]  heard this on NPR as I got to the office she was driving around she listens
[34:58.040 --> 35:02.080]  to it to monitor it said they're talking about AI stuff embedded for almost 30
[35:02.080 --> 35:06.080]  years and Apple stuff and DARPA and then separately I get here and it's on
[35:06.080 --> 35:10.520]  info wars.com about it and I knew DARPA was involved in the very founding of it
[35:10.520 --> 35:16.600]  all out of that same group there in Oregon and Washington state and this is
[35:16.600 --> 35:20.840]  how the globalist control society they decide what standardized they decide
[35:20.840 --> 35:25.720]  when the barcode comes out 1986 universal adoption is Walmart and the
[35:25.720 --> 35:29.920]  defense department finally said we will accept no shipments from any vendors who
[35:29.920 --> 35:37.120]  do not have barcodes and they have big consortium saying we by 2025 major
[35:37.120 --> 35:42.640]  industry in the Pentagon will demand a brain ship implanting to have any
[35:42.640 --> 35:46.520]  commerce and that's in my book by the way to sit in a tourney copies of the
[35:46.520 --> 35:51.040]  Department of Defense that came out in 2000 Federation American scientist
[35:51.040 --> 35:54.800]  released it the Pentagon asked it be reclassified they said we did allow that
[35:54.800 --> 35:58.840]  to be declassified we decided to reclassify it and they removed it but
[35:58.840 --> 36:02.960]  we have a copy of it it's online as well and if you're a new listener I know
[36:02.960 --> 36:06.720]  this sounds crazy okay I'm not the crazy people setting all this up I'm just
[36:06.720 --> 36:10.440]  telling you what they're doing and they say they're gonna their goal is to then
[36:10.440 --> 36:16.600]  phase everybody into tanks virtual reality tanks from birth to death and
[36:16.600 --> 36:20.600]  that with artificial reality you'll never have any pain and that your own
[36:20.600 --> 36:24.680]  body heat will supply power to the machines you may have heard of that do
[36:24.680 --> 36:28.040]  you think the movie the Matrix that the what what Chosky brothers thought that
[36:28.040 --> 36:36.520]  up no that is a Pentagon future wargame scenario now I don't know if they're
[36:36.520 --> 36:41.480]  gonna actually carry that out but they're trying to we're almost to the
[36:41.480 --> 36:45.280]  point of robots working on robots on robots humans won't even be needed for
[36:45.280 --> 36:49.000]  the military soon and then the real tyranny starts with these technocrats
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.600]  who believe like Kurzweil and others that they're gonna merge with the
[36:52.600 --> 36:55.920]  machines and then the rest of us are gonna be obsolete and you can read these
[36:55.920 --> 37:04.600]  statements and the leader of this was the genetic experiment Julian Huxley he
[37:04.600 --> 37:08.280]  was the leader of the eugenics movement and the head of the UN UNESCO program
[37:08.280 --> 37:12.560]  standardizing all global education everything he was really the global
[37:12.560 --> 37:16.200]  leading technocrat carrying out the elites program he was part of a four
[37:16.200 --> 37:21.200]  family four family British royalty breeding program I know you're a new
[37:21.200 --> 37:25.800]  listener just type in Huxley's part of secret British breeding program was
[37:25.800 --> 37:29.800]  declassified in the 60s had been going on for over a hundred years at that time
[37:29.800 --> 37:34.120]  most the children were born dead or totally mentally retarded but a few
[37:34.120 --> 37:37.480]  did that were actually born with super IQs they were also had a lot of mental
[37:37.480 --> 37:41.920]  problems you know his brother in 1932 of course wrote Brave New World which you
[37:41.920 --> 37:44.320]  read the books actually everything they're trying to do now and he said
[37:44.320 --> 37:49.760]  before he died in 62 in a Berkeley speech this was actually the plan you
[37:49.760 --> 37:56.040]  see we're not in Kansas anymore 1932 cross human species cloning suboid
[37:56.040 --> 38:01.520]  fluoride the water to brain damage you all battle plan total precision but
[38:01.520 --> 38:04.840]  they're behind schedule but they are they are they are carrying the operation
[38:04.840 --> 38:13.040]  out with precision oh my god the reality is so much more insane than than
[38:13.040 --> 38:17.480]  anyone can even imagine and I we are run by a bunch of inbred crazy mad
[38:17.480 --> 38:22.080]  scientist who's a big banking families on the Rothschilds they said you can give
[38:22.080 --> 38:28.240]  us extended life you can set up a technocracy here's all our money here
[38:28.240 --> 38:32.520]  we'll finance your four scientific families inner breeding starting in
[38:32.520 --> 38:46.960]  1850 or so the Huxleys the Wedgewoods the Gaultons the the Darwin's I mean this
[38:46.960 --> 38:53.040]  is all mainline history and and and then they wrote the blueprint for the plan
[38:53.040 --> 38:58.120]  and then the great-grandson of the start of this is over there running
[38:58.120 --> 39:03.200]  the United Nations UNESCO sets the school curriculum the roads the standards
[39:03.200 --> 39:08.800]  everything and he wrote books we own them we have stacks of them in Aaron's
[39:08.800 --> 39:12.440]  office I have stacks at home I can't even read them anymore it's all the same
[39:12.440 --> 39:19.560]  thing said in different ways that they're gonna build a world government and by
[39:19.560 --> 39:23.000]  the 50s he said we're embarrassed by the eugenics we've got to all change our
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.640]  names eugenics quarterly became this you know they change all the names and we're
[39:26.640 --> 39:31.200]  gonna call ourselves transhumanist and offer people extended life if they
[39:31.200 --> 39:34.680]  merge with the machines but that'll be for the general public and enslaving
[39:34.680 --> 39:39.080]  system but for us the elites we are gonna merge with this new advanced
[39:39.080 --> 39:47.880]  technology now whether that's going to happen or not by the 70s and it was
[39:47.880 --> 39:53.600]  again declassified in 2000 the Pentagon by the 70s the early 70s was
[39:53.600 --> 40:01.280]  envisioning humans as the power system in in in tanks running a geothermal
[40:01.280 --> 40:10.440]  system with wires into our brains I mean we're not in Kansas anymore and people
[40:10.440 --> 40:15.680]  watch these videos online millions of people and millions of millions a week
[40:15.680 --> 40:18.400]  and they sit there and I see their comments they're like look at this
[40:18.400 --> 40:22.480]  crazy man I've done news reports I've shown you all the documents I'm real
[40:22.480 --> 40:25.040]  busy this week with the occupy the Federal Reserve movement we're launching
[40:25.040 --> 40:34.000]  but I tell you what we'll do a eugenics to the Nazis to transhumanism report
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.120]  I'll have Aaron do a big one next week ten minutes with documents video clips
[40:39.120 --> 40:43.360]  all of them saying I'll have Huxley Julian Huxley saying it I'll have all
[40:43.360 --> 40:47.600]  this Huxley tell you I'll have the charts on their breeding programs how
[40:47.600 --> 40:51.560]  they're poisoned the water I'll just give it all to you how's that sound and I'll
[40:51.560 --> 40:56.720]  dig out that one way to find it is usually was like two copies of my book
[40:56.720 --> 41:00.120]  left hey do me a favor it's behind that camera over there well somebody give me
[41:00.120 --> 41:05.240]  to sent in the tyranny it's over there on the counter and then it's got a few
[41:05.240 --> 41:08.440]  pages of the full documents that's online I forget the name of it we're
[41:08.440 --> 41:11.720]  DARPA was saying in the 70s to the Pentagon that they were gonna put
[41:11.720 --> 41:17.280]  everybody in hive mind tanks thanks I just want to shed and again descent to
[41:17.280 --> 41:21.080]  tyranny is not out of print because it's out of physical print it is posted in
[41:21.080 --> 41:27.320]  full at prisonplanet.tv and it's sold out they don't have any more in the
[41:27.320 --> 41:30.160]  back it's just right there behind that camera I mean I can grab it during the
[41:30.160 --> 41:34.400]  next break it's fine if you guys don't want to walk in front of the cameras and
[41:34.400 --> 41:43.280]  you know so much I I come in here to do this show and it's like why even talk
[41:43.280 --> 41:47.640]  about Rick Perry why even talk about all these people there's just puppets well
[41:47.640 --> 41:53.600]  you have to respond to the puppets and get into all the minutia you have to
[41:53.600 --> 41:58.600]  cover all of this or you can't extricate people out of the matrix yeah
[41:58.600 --> 42:03.840]  here's my book right here this is 9-11 descent into tyranny and somewhere in
[42:03.840 --> 42:10.640]  here I have a screenshots of the document there's the Wildlands project in
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.200]  you unconventional biological diversity plan to destroy biodiversity in the
[42:14.200 --> 42:18.040]  United States to restore it by taking over half the land off use no it's not
[42:18.040 --> 42:22.960]  that map there's one of the Pentagon systems talking about microchips and
[42:22.960 --> 42:28.360]  cyber situation storyboards from Army document on implantable microchips
[42:28.360 --> 42:31.960]  that's part of it and we have a document cam shot I'll show people some of this
[42:31.960 --> 42:36.200]  and then if you go to this full document that I know they pulled off the
[42:36.200 --> 42:39.720]  Federation of American Scientists when they asked to be reclassified I know
[42:39.720 --> 42:44.280]  it's copied everywhere in the Google wayback machines and all those other
[42:44.280 --> 42:54.040]  archive systems and it says ethical and public relations issue and it's got the
[42:54.040 --> 43:00.520]  Pentagon talking about how 2025 they'll get all this done in planning things in
[43:00.520 --> 43:04.240]  people raises ethical and public relations issues while these concerns
[43:04.240 --> 43:08.720]  may be founded on today's thinking in 2025 there will not be so alarming we
[43:08.720 --> 43:12.800]  already are evolving towards technology implanting for example the military
[43:12.800 --> 43:16.640]  currently requires its members to receive mandatory injections of biological
[43:16.640 --> 43:20.840]  organisms I the flu shot yet now they got nanotech in it that actually changes
[43:20.840 --> 43:24.320]  brain chemistry in the civilian world people will receive mechanical hearts
[43:24.320 --> 43:29.200]  on their organs society has come to accept most of these implants as part of
[43:29.200 --> 43:33.640]  fact by 2025 it is possible medical technology will have nerve chips that
[43:33.640 --> 43:37.000]  allow amputees to control artificial limbs that's already here or eye chips
[43:37.000 --> 43:40.520]  that allow the blind to see the civilian populace will likely accept an
[43:40.520 --> 43:47.280]  implantable microchip that allows military members to defend vital national
[43:47.280 --> 43:50.080]  interests furthermore the US military will continue to be a volunteer force
[43:50.080 --> 43:54.320]  that will freely accept the chip because it's a tool to control technology and
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.600]  not a tool to control the human and then it goes on in here that I know in the
[43:58.600 --> 44:03.400]  document talks about these tanks that will live in virtual reality tanks with
[44:03.400 --> 44:13.440]  a hive mind let me keep reading here let me keep looking here here's Andy
[44:13.440 --> 44:19.600]  Rooney who's announced he's going to there's a video clip of this actually in
[44:19.600 --> 44:22.920]  Rotority something has to change though they have to find a better way of
[44:22.920 --> 44:26.880]  identifying bad guys or the rest of us are going to stay home and watch the
[44:26.880 --> 44:31.520]  world go by on television but we need some system for permanently identifying
[44:31.520 --> 44:36.280]  safe people most of us are never going to blow anything up and there's got to
[44:36.280 --> 44:40.840]  be something better than one of these photo IDs a tattoo somewhere maybe and
[44:40.840 --> 44:44.160]  that's why they're now groping you at the NFL he was talking about being being
[44:44.160 --> 44:48.840]  ID'd at the NFL now they just grab your genitals and their answer is already at
[44:48.840 --> 44:53.200]  the airports oh well we put you through a face scan and then we approve you can
[44:53.200 --> 44:56.720]  travel or not I'll look around during the break and try to find the part where
[44:56.720 --> 45:02.960]  they talk about the the tanks I know it's in the document we reference in the
[45:02.960 --> 45:07.000]  book regardless and we'll do a news report on that next week as I said the
[45:07.000 --> 45:14.600]  point is truth is so much stranger than fiction now I said I would said I get
[45:14.600 --> 45:18.560]  into this geopolitical news but first I want to tell you about some of the
[45:18.560 --> 45:22.840]  sponsors that make this radio show possible before we get into Israel

[47:59.240 --> 48:05.840]  having an eco-fest run by the Austin Chronicle owner Lewis Blacks is a stage
[48:05.840 --> 48:11.720]  name and they're now starting an eco-fest I guess to figure out ways to take
[48:11.720 --> 48:16.800]  over society and shut down select power plants and other things and we're gonna
[48:16.800 --> 48:22.640]  be reporting on that coming up. Every day or so
[48:24.720 --> 48:30.800]  every day or so I see articles like this this is out of the SGA Journal the
[48:30.800 --> 48:37.200]  Springfield Illinois State Journal Register and it says the main plants to
[48:37.200 --> 48:47.480]  close in Ameren to close and the Hudsonville plants under new EPA
[48:47.480 --> 48:54.400]  regulations they are shutting down two of the major power plants and getting
[48:54.400 --> 48:58.440]  rid of the employees and that's just the way it is you can go read this article
[48:58.440 --> 49:02.280]  I want to get into this later and again every day without looking I see the
[49:02.280 --> 49:06.360]  power plants the head of the energy department told the Wall Street Journal
[49:06.360 --> 49:13.720]  what in February of this year he said you're going to see massive power plant
[49:13.720 --> 49:17.080]  shutdowns in fact let's just prove that to people Google head of energy
[49:17.080 --> 49:21.360]  department we're going to shut down massive numbers of coal plants and
[49:21.360 --> 49:25.800]  Obama promised to bankrupt them but but but not all of them general electric if
[49:25.800 --> 49:28.560]  it's their plant they don't have to follow the old rules they're totally
[49:28.560 --> 49:32.080]  exempt from everything and if you hire general electric to take over the
[49:32.080 --> 49:37.040]  running of your plant you're fine now all these other plants and now now
[49:37.040 --> 49:40.920]  general electric's got to agree though you can't be in competition with one of
[49:40.920 --> 49:44.840]  their others so I thought I would cover the Austin journals report from the
[49:44.840 --> 49:49.120]  state Commission's own admission corporations will only have a 13%
[49:49.120 --> 49:56.400]  increase and government is exempt so more total discrimination and here's the
[49:56.400 --> 50:01.320]  headline Austin energies proposed rate increase Garner's speculation and it
[50:01.320 --> 50:06.160]  goes on 13% rate hike start stirs mixed feelings about users but they say it's
[50:06.160 --> 50:09.720]  for the earth so it's like an indulgence five hundred years ago you know you'd
[50:09.720 --> 50:13.680]  pay the Vatican money to get your get your child that died out of purgatory or
[50:13.680 --> 50:19.800]  whatever you pay Al Gore that now but they shut down a lot of the power plants
[50:19.800 --> 50:23.040]  here that were sitting on that we paid for and then overnight the prices have
[50:23.040 --> 50:26.760]  already roughly doubled on average the last few years last five six years but
[50:26.760 --> 50:33.080]  now to 28.7 increase for citizens 13 for corporations governments exempt just
[50:33.080 --> 50:37.440]  like government buildings are exempt from blackouts let me continue just like
[50:37.440 --> 50:41.880]  in Romania they were under Chalcescu but Austin energy has outlined an increase
[50:41.880 --> 50:48.440]  it's actually 60% on citizens if they if you use above a certain amount it goes
[50:48.440 --> 50:53.440]  to 60 so the smart meters gang rape you they promised they wouldn't but of course
[50:53.440 --> 50:58.760]  they they are going to we'll get into the world war three news straight ahead
[51:00.320 --> 51:07.080]  info wars.com for 16 years has led the charge against the technocrats we have
[51:07.080 --> 51:12.840]  had unrivaled success in unlocking minds expanding paradigms and rallying the
[51:12.840 --> 51:17.960]  people to face the new world order no one can deny that our media operation is
[51:17.960 --> 51:21.640]  the tip of the spear and it's because of our success that we have a
[51:21.640 --> 51:27.240]  responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalist 110

[54:42.360 --> 54:49.320]  on government drug dealing and more with Kevin Booth now the entire society has
[54:49.320 --> 54:54.480]  been set up to make us dependent and when the IMF and World Bank both foreign
[54:54.480 --> 55:00.080]  consortiums of the global six megabanks when they take over your country they
[55:00.080 --> 55:06.120]  double and then triple water and utility that's their big tax and then when
[55:06.120 --> 55:10.360]  people riot over it that's even better they call that the IMF riot that got
[55:10.360 --> 55:13.920]  leaked in 2002 that they like that because that destroys confidence even
[55:13.920 --> 55:17.760]  better and then they just put in president after president it doesn't
[55:17.760 --> 55:21.800]  matter the bankers are in place this is done all over the world this is a
[55:21.800 --> 55:26.680]  strategic rollout plan by the Federal Reserve here domestically part of the
[55:26.680 --> 55:31.280]  larger world banking system but I just wanted to show you out of Austin Metro
[55:31.280 --> 55:34.720]  paper and they have links to the Texas Energy Commission and others admitting
[55:34.720 --> 55:39.360]  this the headlines a 13% rate hike starting in the next year when you
[55:39.360 --> 55:46.960]  read it's actually a 28.7% increase when they average them together but it goes
[55:46.960 --> 55:53.080]  on to say corporations pay 13% more citizens on average 28.7 but wait it
[55:53.080 --> 55:57.880]  gets better here's the highlighted part of it this is directly from the Austin
[55:57.880 --> 56:03.920]  Energy Cost of Service study and they put one of these out what last year and
[56:03.920 --> 56:07.720]  talked about three billion dollars it's gonna cost Austinites in the next three
[56:07.720 --> 56:10.640]  to five years I mean we're talking about better than the entire budget every
[56:10.640 --> 56:15.840]  year combined just absolute theft here it is highlighted for prison planet dot
[56:15.840 --> 56:23.840]  TV viewers Austin Energy here I'll just show it to you right here right here see
[56:23.840 --> 56:28.480]  folks I'm gonna try to show people a document cam shot just just like right
[56:28.480 --> 56:36.600]  in here or just wherever we can show it yeah right there the residential segment
[56:36.600 --> 56:45.440]  Austin Energy has outlined for increased rate options so your options are this
[56:45.440 --> 56:49.560]  form of robbery that form of robbery the other form of robbery or this form of
[56:49.560 --> 56:56.320]  robbery and it goes on to say depending on how much you use you'll be penalized
[56:56.320 --> 57:03.440]  if you use too much just people that use more water higher rates kick in 60% higher
[57:03.440 --> 57:09.280]  or as little as five if you're a good little greening in comparison commercial
[57:09.280 --> 57:16.760]  and industrial users face a charge as high as 22% or as low as 1% and then
[57:16.760 --> 57:20.000]  the big corporations know how to fill out all the paperwork and red tape and get
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.600]  out of it so what does this have to do with the environment just charging
[57:23.600 --> 57:27.160]  everybody more money going in having regulators shot down the smaller
[57:27.160 --> 57:30.560]  companies then there's less power companies now they can charge whatever
[57:30.560 --> 57:34.680]  they want and make Enron type profits every day of the week so same thing in
[57:34.680 --> 57:38.000]  Ron dead ten years ago in California they were making billions of dollars of
[57:38.000 --> 57:46.320]  extra profit a day in some cases and if you go and talk to environmentalists at
[57:46.320 --> 57:49.680]  Austin you tell them hey they're they're about to massively increase our power
[57:49.680 --> 57:53.600]  prices they've already increased over the last few years massively and they'll
[57:53.600 --> 57:58.080]  say fine it's for the earth carbon dioxide is deadly that plants breathe
[57:58.080 --> 58:01.880]  yeah but they're moving the industry to China where they have dirty clean
[58:01.880 --> 58:05.840]  burning coal so it's one world more of this gas if you hate it's getting out
[58:05.840 --> 58:08.760]  along with real things that are bad they're like I don't care shut it down
[58:08.760 --> 58:13.760]  in America they love it they just love watching everything fall apart they get
[58:13.760 --> 58:20.800]  off on it these are miscreant spoiled rotten children of hippies who now
[58:20.800 --> 58:24.560]  want everybody's guns and love evil and love Al Gore raping them I mean they
[58:24.560 --> 58:28.680]  love it they get a little giggly face they hate families they hate private
[58:28.680 --> 58:34.000]  property they are literal unhappy scum they want to ruin all of our lives and
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.920]  they're shutting power plants down all over the country that's why your power

[1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:20.360]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:20.360 --> 1:00:44.000]  Alex Jones alright we're now into our number two I want to take some calls if
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.920]  you're part of Occupy Wall Street and you don't like the mainstream media
[1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:52.960]  misrepresenting you as a bunch of Obama lovers or maybe you do love socialism
[1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:58.440]  or perhaps you're a neocon who thinks we should pay unlimited trillions to
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:03.160]  foreign banks and that's a good form of welfare or if you agree with my analysis
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:08.720]  of the situation which is fluid because it's a complex issue I'd love to hear
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:16.640]  from you the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 the
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:20.520]  phones are open and I'll take some of your calls coming up in the next segment
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:29.040]  I I see with disgust and pain to watch our country going into economic bondage
[1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:32.680]  to know that the favorite tool of tyrants is economic bondage to make
[1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:36.880]  people so poor living at such subsistence level that they won't stand up
[1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:43.440]  against tyranny because they can't and to see oppressive secret police agencies
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:47.160]  and police brutality being backed up by the system to intimidate the public
[1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:51.280]  regardless of what you think of Occupy Wall Street it's it's filled with good
[1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:56.280]  grassroots people who are standing up against corruption and are identifying
[1:01:56.280 --> 1:02:02.000]  in a general way the problem Wall Street did set up the CIA that is the the
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.280]  the captains of it they did set up the private fellow reserve and they are
[1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:10.160]  destroying our real economy and then using a corporate scorched earth policy
[1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:15.680]  and so I've got to commend Occupy Wall Street overall I've also need to point
[1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:18.840]  out though the Democrats are basically trying to co-opt it just like I was an
[1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:21.960]  attack in the Tea Party that Ron Paul started when I pointed out that
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:26.080]  Republican mainline people were trying to take it over I was just stating a fact
[1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:35.800]  there but now that I've had reporters in San Antonio in Austin in Jacobson's in
[1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:40.360]  New York now for three days he's coming back tomorrow night and he says almost
[1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:43.320]  everybody is against the fellow reserve really knows what's going on but
[1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:47.880]  yeah he sees the same news I see where they they go Occupy Wall Street what
[1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:51.360]  do they want higher taxes socialism all this stuff and then you go talk to the
[1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:56.040]  people that's not what you're hearing and Kurt Nemo has a big report out
[1:02:56.040 --> 1:03:00.880]  dissecting the Occupy Wall Street list of demands and it's bad totally open
[1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:06.680]  borders $20 an hour minimum wage that'll send every job we've got left
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:11.760]  overseas folks do you know what that'll do I mean you won't get a job and their
[1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:16.360]  answer is that matter pay everyone even the unemployed $20 an hour and you
[1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:20.320]  realize half the public pays no income tax now you realize everything would
[1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:28.280]  ultimately collapse they want totally free college period not debt
[1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:35.440]  forgiveness on loan sharking rates or something reasonable no no just free
[1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:40.800]  education period who are you gonna take from to pay for that demand seven one
[1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:43.760]  trillion dollars in ecological restoration that means given Al Gore
[1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:49.160]  somebody to lecture us demand eight radical and gender equal rights
[1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:54.920]  amendment and just basically make five-year-olds learn how to well you
[1:03:54.920 --> 1:04:04.760]  know what they do demand nine open borders migration mentioned that ten
[1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:09.440]  bring American elections of international standards paper ballots that
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:15.320]  that actually is one of the only good ideas so and then there's one other one
[1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:21.480]  in here Kurt thinks is good idea not tend to agree with him immediate across the
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:26.880]  board debt forgiveness for all what about global corporations and stuff
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:30.640]  that's what we've done is for giving them their mega debts of derivatives and
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:34.760]  then taxpayers have to pay for it somebody loses something when you do
[1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:39.720]  something like that forgive fraudulent loans yeah make the bankers that did
[1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:45.880]  this pay but claw back those trillions but don't just say oh well I don't know
[1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:51.000]  on my house anymore it just goes on with a bunch of nanny state stuff but then I
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:58.240]  read all this carbon tax stuff it's just incredible oh boy these poor people
[1:04:58.240 --> 1:05:03.480]  we'll be right back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[1:05:03.480 --> 1:05:07.920]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:11.960]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:15.880]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:19.880]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:24.440]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:28.440]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:32.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:35.880]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:05:35.880 --> 1:05:40.200]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:05:40.200 --> 1:05:43.360]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:47.240]  generators offered by solution from science one of my old sponsors you can

[1:08:58.680 --> 1:09:02.920]  Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush their morning briefer he will be
[1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:08.960]  joining us to talk about the geopolitical ramifications of Israel saying
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:14.680]  they may strike Iran any day now let me get into some of that news and then into
[1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:23.160]  your calls Russia China veto UN resolution on Syria crackdown Russia and
[1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:28.520]  China today vetoed a UN Security Council resolution drawn up by European
[1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:33.000]  Nations threatening action of Syria's leader does not end a deadly crackdown
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:38.720]  on pro-democracy movement is the first Russian China veto since the pair blocked
[1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:44.720]  UN sanctions against some Bob ways president Robert Mugabe in 2008 that is
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:50.920]  a big big deal continuing here are you gonna see the West call for military
[1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:55.440]  action against Saudi Arabia don't hold your breath they're doing the same thing
[1:09:55.440 --> 1:10:01.120]  that Assad's doing Saudi police open fire on civilians as protests gain
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:05.560]  momentum and that is certainly a real rebellion over there but the West will
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:11.000]  try to hijack that I won't cry myself to sleep of the House of Saud falls
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:15.080]  probably some of the most degenerate people on earth the leadership of that
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:23.560]  group continuing report Assad threatens to attack Tel Aviv if case of NATO strike
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:38.320]  so Assad is saying that if Syria is attacked by Israel he will strike the
[1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:42.200]  capital of Israel you know the capital I guess it's Jerusalem their main
[1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:54.080]  populous city of Tel Aviv and of course Iran has set off and on that if they
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:58.200]  ever get attacked by NATO or the West that they're going to blast Israel
[1:10:58.200 --> 1:11:03.680]  knowing that Israel has been pushing for a Western attack they've got inspectors
[1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:10.080]  in their nuclear reactors in Iran no reason to attack them no reason their
[1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:16.000]  leader will be out soon and they'll have a more moderate in there I mean we do
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:19.680]  not want to start this but notice the West wants to start this right now
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:23.880]  because it's a good political diversion from the economic meltdowns that are
[1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:29.680]  happening continuing here here is consortium news article by Ray McGovern
[1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:35.280]  that's why he's joining us Israel's window to bomb Iran this is an exclusive
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:39.280]  from his intel sources Israeli leaders continue to pound the drum about taking
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:44.960]  out Iran's nuclear program and some headliners may want to strike soon some
[1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:48.640]  hardliners fearing the window of opportunity will close if president
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:53.600]  Barack Obama wins reelection and is less susceptible to political pressures as
[1:11:53.600 --> 1:12:01.200]  XCA analyst Ray McGovern observe we got him popping in so we're gonna get a
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:06.000]  break down on that coming up and Israel is saying they may strike anytime and
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:11.720]  Syria is saying that they may strike Israel of NATO bombs them but for now it
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:16.360]  looks like that's off the West is just using proxy rebels try to overthrow the
[1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:21.080]  Syrian regime again this isn't a real rebellion of the Syrian people against
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:25.640]  their dictator I'm no fan of Assad I'm no fan of government I'm no fan of big
[1:12:25.640 --> 1:12:30.200]  government of dictators of hereditary stuff of Kim Jong-il of any of this of
[1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:37.720]  the Bush family hereditary garbage Kings Queens all of it but this is the West
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:41.480]  stirring it up in Libya stirring it up in Syria stirring it up against their old
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:46.640]  ally Mubarak in Egypt and you have to ask why well it's order out of chaos
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:53.320]  they're just creating a big crisis so that is coming up let's go ahead and go
[1:12:53.320 --> 1:13:00.240]  to Dana in Alabama thank you for holding you're on the air hey Alex good good to
[1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:05.240]  talk to you again how you doing good welcome hey look I just want to tell
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:09.840]  you I appreciate you standing up for the truth that you've consistently on a
[1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:14.320]  couple of big lies that are going around this world one of them being the
[1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:17.640]  rapture you know when you when you know the truth about a couple of things it
[1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:22.520]  changes a lot of things but look there's another bigger lie going around the
[1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:29.080]  post of the world believes that really your response won't be adequate today
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:33.280]  for what I'm fixing to say but when you think about it tomorrow next week you'll
[1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:39.320]  see what the truth about this subject changes you had a rabbi on two weeks ago
[1:13:39.320 --> 1:13:45.200]  that is the new head of a organization promoting Second Amendment rights yeah
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:50.520]  no Jews Jews the preservation of firearms ownership really super hardcore
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:54.560]  Second Amendment but a lot of great work really exposing what gun controls really
[1:13:54.560 --> 1:14:01.640]  all about yes I heard repeated mentions of this thing called Jewish law I am not
[1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:07.680]  an anti-Semite I am a brother of Judah but that there's one big lie in this
[1:14:07.680 --> 1:14:15.240]  world God never made a covenant with the tribe of Judah there is no such thing as
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:22.560]  a Jewish religion it's not to be found in the Bible that covenant was made with
[1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:28.640]  all of Israel starting with Abraham and he was Judas great-grandfather is stuff
[1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:36.040]  about Abraham being a Jew is hogwash he was Judas great-grandfather no way was
[1:14:36.040 --> 1:14:42.360]  Abraham a Jew this covenant was made with all of Israel Israel got deported
[1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:48.920]  Judah got let go back to Jerusalem and by default they were the keepers of this
[1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:55.680]  covenant with Israel it became named known as Judaism there is no such thing
[1:14:55.680 --> 1:15:02.160]  as a Jewish religion and what is people are calling Jewish law is if they've
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:06.520]  taken it from the Bible so I mean I'm not a super Bible scholar but I mean
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:13.000]  certainly what what people call Jews as different camps and ideas but it goes
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:19.120]  back to to I guess Abrahamic law then you would say that is the basis of the
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:24.120]  three great religions you know I really don't get into arguing back and forth
[1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:27.680]  about different groups and different organizations there's a diversity of
[1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:34.400]  ideas you know in the quote you know Jewish groups but but I do know that
[1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:37.760]  you're right that it talks about a bunch of other tribes they've done genetic
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:41.640]  tests all over the Middle East all over Europe everybody's basically related to
[1:15:41.640 --> 1:15:44.720]  each other one way or the other and that's what's so stupid about all this
[1:15:44.720 --> 1:15:48.560]  tribal killing I appreciate your call send me an email with more of what
[1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:55.240]  you're getting into there let's go ahead and take another call let's go to John
[1:15:55.240 --> 1:16:02.160]  in Michigan John welcome good afternoon Alex I'm my new listener full
[1:16:02.160 --> 1:16:08.600]  supporter Patriot such as yourself I'd like to comment on the Occupy Wall
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:16.880]  Street movement I believe that the initial movement and the directive of the
[1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:27.840]  initial occupation was a correct endeavor I believe that it is fully then
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:37.680]  scripted though I think that's why the mass arrest the 700 plus protesters the
[1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:43.680]  protesters not being allowed to actually then go to Wall Street this this
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:54.520]  just reminds me a lot of an Arab Spring type scenario you seem to have the
[1:16:54.520 --> 1:17:00.920]  socialist aspect of it where everything is paid for across the board as you were
[1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:05.360]  stating earlier everybody gets $20 an hour for regardless how menial your
[1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:10.880]  job is everybody gets free education everybody gets free health care some of
[1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:19.040]  these things are bordering to me of wreaking of what is going on with the
[1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:24.880]  Arab Spring which is getting rapidly ready to fall into the arid winter of
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:30.880]  discontent and I would like to hear some of your some of your views on it well
[1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:35.280]  no that's it two and a half weeks ago I saw that Soros move on were involved I
[1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:40.760]  noticed the media the dominant corporate media was only showing the yell
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:44.960]  leaders calling for free health care and stuff and the reelection of Obama and
[1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:48.320]  then I sent reporters out and found that's not what most people are saying so
[1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:54.800]  yeah the people behind ad busters their Democratic Party operatives they put the
[1:17:54.800 --> 1:18:00.240]  call out patriots and and others show up and the Democrats swoop in and say
[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:04.400]  we're anti Wall Street and that's their new reelection bid George Soros has said
[1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:11.440]  he supports them the unions are out in force SEI you and others are out there
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:14.560]  and that's exactly what it is and then good people that are at these events
[1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:21.480]  they send me emails and say hey we're not supporting this I know but the media
[1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:27.320]  uses the demonstrations as the backdrop to then have selected people speak for
[1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:34.800]  everyone who then basically call for the globalist austerity repackaged as a
[1:18:34.800 --> 1:18:39.000]  program to redistribute wealth and it does redistribute middle-class and
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:42.640]  working-class people's money to offshore offshore banks the same program we see
[1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:46.920]  in Europe and so that's what's going on that's what's happening that's why it is
[1:18:46.920 --> 1:18:50.680]  such a big deal and I shot a video last night I put another one up tonight it's
[1:18:50.680 --> 1:18:54.120]  the featured video on our YouTube channel it's now rolled off the main page
[1:18:54.120 --> 1:19:00.280]  of info wars.com and I have that reposted but Occupy Wall Street we need to
[1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:04.960]  get them to Occupy not capitalism and some vague thing but Occupy the Federal

[1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:30.880]  your bailout money went that's where the austerity is going that's what's cutting
[1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:34.560]  your pensions that's what's stealing everything and they're gonna sell all
[1:25:34.560 --> 1:25:40.480]  these new direct taxes to the bankers as socialism but they always bait and
[1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:43.720]  switch and steal it so with your liberal conservative whatever you call
[1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:48.120]  yourself the Federal Reserve is bad news and the polls are 85 percent a few
[1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:52.560]  years ago wanted to audit it it's it's 80 plus percent now want to abolish it
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:26:00.800]  and polls I've seen we have got to go after the real enemy peacefully and we're
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:05.720]  gonna go in circle they've got sidewalks around this thing I am going to show up
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:11.440]  for two hours six to eight I'm gonna try to get there actually earlier see I was
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:19.320]  gonna do the show here Friday and then get in the car and haul tail up there
[1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:22.600]  and my mother called me and she goes I know you don't pay attention to sports
[1:26:22.600 --> 1:26:27.040]  but it's Texas OU weekend and I 35 will have a lot of traffic on it and I've
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:29.800]  been up there in college for Texas OU there won't be that bad a traffic in
[1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:34.920]  Dallas the point is you want to come into Dallas wherever you're at and get
[1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:38.520]  there so quite frankly I'm saying it's already out there you know six to eight
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:42.360]  that gives folks time after work in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to get out there
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:48.240]  but I'll probably actually be out there 5 30 or so I'll do a special broadcast
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:52.400]  over the audio streams and in prison planet TV from the RV near there I'll
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:57.440]  do a report from there I'm gonna do my radio show basically from nearby or at
[1:26:57.440 --> 1:27:02.000]  the grounds of the Federal Reserve I think it's up a picnic table and have
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:05.880]  the cops gonna while I'm on air via Skype and hey leave me alone I could I
[1:27:05.880 --> 1:27:10.880]  could walk around with the laptop there I mean we're gonna do a lot of stuff so

[1:32:30.680 --> 1:32:35.520]  everyone to read the new book rising prices empty shelves warning signs
[1:32:35.520 --> 1:32:40.280]  that trigger the deadliest famines in history don't get caught unprepared

[1:33:25.680 --> 1:33:32.440]  okay to be clear and if you go to info wars.com this article just came out it's
[1:33:32.440 --> 1:33:36.920]  confirmed what I told you back up to the weekend Occupy Wall Street stands in
[1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:41.860]  solidarity with Obama front group why is the official Occupy Wall Street website
[1:33:41.860 --> 1:33:47.120]  in league with lobbying efforts for Wall Street backed Obama White House now
[1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:51.600]  this is the issue Obama ran on fighting Wall Street corruption when he was
[1:33:51.600 --> 1:33:56.040]  totally bankrolled by it are we saying John McCain's good no it's all out of
[1:33:56.040 --> 1:34:01.040]  the same elite just like Mitt Romney Rick Perry all of these people only Ron
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:05.280]  Paul has a true constitutional voting record and that's why he's demonized
[1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:10.480]  that's why he is attacked and am I saying all the protesters are bad no
[1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:14.120]  these are great people coming out because they know Wall Street is bankrupting
[1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:20.040]  this country through derivatives and bailouts and off-shoring but we now
[1:34:20.040 --> 1:34:24.400]  have the official Occupy Wall Street listed demands and it's free education
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:30.040]  free health care miss Soviet Union we're bankrupt socialism doesn't work
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:35.160]  crony capitalism doesn't work but the idea that a bunch of mega rich getting
[1:34:35.160 --> 1:34:39.440]  government bailouts is capitalism so we should scrap private property is
[1:34:39.440 --> 1:34:43.480]  dangerous now we're on the streets I've got my reporter Rob Jacobson up there
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:47.280]  even following videos he's found some move on dot org people and others and
[1:34:47.280 --> 1:34:51.000]  they're the ones trying to run things but they don't run it so the mainstream
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:55.440]  media is just going to them and letting move on the Obama people speak for
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:35:00.400]  Occupy Wall Street and their answer is raise taxes in the middle class and pay
[1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:04.640]  it in austerity payments to foreign banks and these billionaires running
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:07.600]  around lecturing everybody about how they need to raise taxes on the rich
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:12.480]  that's because they're exempt from it want that money so get this article out
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:15.960]  to everybody you know Occupy Wall Street stands a solid area with Obama front
[1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:20.920]  group we are occupying the Federal Reserve in Dallas Texas camping out
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:26.400]  around it to draw attention to the real inner group that uses crony capitalism
[1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:30.600]  monopoly to take over society this Friday six o'clock it kicks off I'm

[1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:42.240]  wherever you are in the country to go identify the Federal Reserve and it's
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:45.600]  already happening call the media make sure they're there alternative
[1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:55.880]  mainstream you name it now shifting years during any type of economic crisis
[1:35:55.880 --> 1:36:00.920]  the establishment's gonna try to launch wars and you've got Saudi Arabians being
[1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:04.920]  gunned down now but the West isn't too concerned about that you've got NATO
[1:36:04.920 --> 1:36:09.920]  and others talking about wanting to go into Syria and you've got China and
[1:36:09.920 --> 1:36:14.560]  Russia vetoing that in the Security Council that's a big deal I'm not a fan
[1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:18.480]  of Syria the point is we don't want more wars ladies and gentlemen you've got
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:22.280]  Israel talking about going into Iran you've got Assad of Syria saying if
[1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:25.800]  they're attacked by NATO they're gonna attack Israel and take that as an attack
[1:36:25.800 --> 1:36:30.200]  and Ray McGovern running for consortium news comm so we got him on today we
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:33.800]  appreciate him joining us on short notice wrote the headline Israel's window
[1:36:33.800 --> 1:36:40.200]  to bomb Iran Ray McGovern is a retired CIA officer term political activist he
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:44.480]  worked under seven presidents he was the top morning great for Ronald Reagan
[1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:50.200]  George Bush senior and of course he famously confronted Rumsfeld on WMD's
[1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:53.480]  and that he'd lied and said they knew where they were in and around to Crete
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:59.400]  and then Rumsfeld got caught lying and he's given a lot of speeches at George
[1:36:59.400 --> 1:37:04.200]  Washington University and and well he confronted Hillary Clinton there and got
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:11.720]  drug out and arrested and he joins us now we appreciate you coming on Ray thanks
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:16.120]  Alex is good but back with you here before we start let me just issue a
[1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:22.400]  little demural tomorrow I will be with thousands of others on our own Tahrir
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:27.800]  Square in Freedom Plaza in Washington there will be thousands of us and very
[1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:32.280]  much like the Wall Street protest that we're a popular movement here the
[1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:38.080]  revolution has begun I compliment you for what you're doing down in Texas but I
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:43.960]  don't see any real reason to to cast aspersions on on other movements and the
[1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:48.480]  Wall Street group seems to be the real deal to me now I don't want to argue the
[1:37:48.480 --> 1:37:53.040]  point but I think that we need to have unity these days especially as the root
[1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:57.080]  revolution begins and you know what I heard you say there just forced me to
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:38:01.280]  kind of give you all right I love it I mean I mean I love it when people bring
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:04.560]  up counterpoints and perhaps I mean obviously you didn't hear what I've
[1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:09.680]  said earlier so let me give you the depth and breadth of what I'm saying the
[1:38:09.680 --> 1:38:14.700]  White House has announced move on org has announced all these organizations have
[1:38:14.700 --> 1:38:19.680]  announced that this is basically their reelection bit that that they're going
[1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:25.360]  to try to take it over and the way NPR CNN and MSNBC cover Occupy Wall Street
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:32.640]  is basically them calling for wealth redistribution and class warfare so I'm
[1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:36.240]  nonpartisan and I know about pressure from above and below the Republicans say
[1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:39.720]  Wall Street can do no wrong you know the Democrats are acting like they're not
[1:38:39.720 --> 1:38:43.160]  financed by it and basically she was saying off with their heads and stuff
[1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:49.360]  and we've got Michael Moore running around saying capitalism is the problem
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:54.400]  well capitalism didn't do this a bunch of insiders ripping us off to this is a
[1:38:54.400 --> 1:38:58.880]  criminal matter and so I agree with you that this is grassroots the cops shouldn't
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:03.680]  be attacking them I've got reporters there I'm saying there is an attempt by
[1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:07.600]  the big unions and everybody to make this a wholly unsubsidiary of the
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:12.000]  Democratic Party just like I talked about the Tea Party being grassroots and
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:16.480]  Republicans trying to take it over right I agree with you completely what I
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:20.200]  don't see is that well that's actually where you come in that's where the
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:24.760]  independent media comes in that's where the internet comes in we can prevent
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:31.240]  this takeover we can't prevent what Fox News or CNN says but we can and we will
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:36.400]  mark my words we're gonna shut down this place Alex and when we shut down this
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:41.840]  place and the Washington Post can't get to their offices and the CNN can't do
[1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:47.920]  their their their thing here people don't have to take notice and we we owe
[1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:52.280]  nothing to move on move on has been a great disappointment to me ever since
[1:39:52.280 --> 1:39:58.800]  2006 when they wouldn't shout out with me as Nancy Pelosi and that read were
[1:39:58.800 --> 1:40:04.080]  were pump pump possibly saying oh you know we're doing the right thing they
[1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:07.960]  wouldn't impeach Bush and that was a Travis State that was that where I
[1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:12.960]  Democrats democracy really fell down so move on isn't it's got nothing to do
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:17.480]  with this as far as I can turn this is a real grassroots movement and you know I
[1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:20.840]  hope you're all like glad you have people and talk we're square here in
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:26.880]  Washington and I just am very very enthusiastic about that and maybe I'm
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:31.200]  hypersensitive to early science that there could be any division in this
[1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:38.040]  movement listen I want to prosecute the the Bank of America Goldman Sachs JP
[1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:43.680]  Morgan Wells Fargo all the people that knowingly sold derivative crap I want
[1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:48.920]  to claw back the bailouts I do not want austerity to cut everybody's benefits to
[1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:53.320]  pay money into derivative black hole yeah I want to audit the Federal Reserve
[1:40:53.320 --> 1:41:01.520]  I want that too but what I want even more Alex is I want to repatriate the 58
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:06.200]  cents on every dollar of tax money that we pay I want to take that out of busy
[1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:11.800]  these feckless wars in Iraq Afghanistan Libya and wherever else bring them back
[1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:16.280]  and tell the American people look you've been sold a bill of goods it's not that
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:20.320]  we don't have enough money we have enough money it's just being given
[1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:26.400]  completely or at least 58% worth to the Pentagon so once we repatriate that
[1:41:26.400 --> 1:41:30.240]  money you don't have to fire your teachers anymore or your firefighters you
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:34.720]  can you can balance your state budgets that's the big notion are you pleased
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:39.080]  by Rand Paul keeping his promise as a libertarian conservative and calling for
[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:45.040]  $500 billion cut in the Pentagon budget I sure am I admire even more his dad
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:52.240]  because his dad speaks truth and when he talks about you know how people need to
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:58.680]  reflect about why you know the real reasons why 9-11 happened and how we're
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:02.880]  looked at by the rest of the world and then he gets booed for that well I had
[1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:06.960]  really admire Ron Paul for sticking his neck out there because he speaks truth
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:10.840]  so yeah the polls I think they're doing pretty good job I don't agree with a lot
[1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:14.080]  of what they say about domestic things but that's neither here nor there there's
[1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:19.400]  well I think it comes down to this look we don't want to control left anymore we
[1:42:19.400 --> 1:42:23.760]  don't want to control right we want real constitutional populism and we should
[1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:26.820]  come together and I want to be clear here I am in a hundred percent
[1:42:26.820 --> 1:42:30.800]  solidarity with people protesting the corruption of Wall Street and they're
[1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:34.960]  out of control behavior and their and their and their kleptocratic activities
[1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:40.520]  I'm simply pointing out there is an attempt by the establishment left the
[1:42:40.520 --> 1:42:45.200]  ones that love the wars and all the rest of it to try to take this over and
[1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:52.120]  that's what I've said I am not saying overall it's bad or it's evil I'm
[1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:56.760]  simply saying this is what I believe is important and people can take my view or
[1:42:56.760 --> 1:43:00.920]  leave it I'm saying let's go out to the Federal Reserve and so I'm trying to put
[1:43:00.920 --> 1:43:05.320]  my two cents in to what I hope is a second American Revolution a peaceful one
[1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:11.480]  of ideas and when you see Goldman Sachs give 4.5 million the day before the
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:16.360]  Occupy Wall Street to the NYPD and the NYPD breaking people's arms and beating
[1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:20.240]  people over the head and pepper spraying women officer Tony Baloney that's not a
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:25.560]  joke folks this is real name you know that is wrong and it and even then the
[1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:30.000]  Chinese canal the Communist Chinese leadership is criticizing is saying when
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:33.880]  we crack people over the heads you get upset so America is losing its moral
[1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:39.440]  authority what can you say to that I think you know I agree with the 99% of
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:45.240]  that the only thing I wish to stress here is that we have the power as the
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:51.160]  people not to let the professional left to take this thing over we have been
[1:43:51.160 --> 1:43:57.160]  critical of places like move on because of the timidity about the wars and we the
[1:43:57.160 --> 1:44:02.520]  people the ones that are converging I'm waiting for the delegation from the state
[1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:05.520]  of Minnesota to camp out in my backyard tonight
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:10.840]  Colleen Rowley and the rest of them we're gonna be not let ourselves be taken
[1:44:10.840 --> 1:44:14.400]  over and I think the folks in Wall Street are doing the same thing they're
[1:44:14.400 --> 1:44:18.840]  right two blocks away from Goldman Sachs and today is going to be a major
[1:44:18.840 --> 1:44:24.480]  major demonstration with the with the involvement of not only thousands of
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:29.520]  students but trade unions so I think we've got a really good thing going here
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:34.400]  and I applaud your role in it Alex but I just you know I just want to say that
[1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:40.320]  let's let's see how it unfolds and you know we call me call me back in a month
[1:44:40.320 --> 1:44:44.480]  and ask me Ray were you able to prevent the professional left from taking this
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:49.760]  over and I think I'm going to be able to say yes I was yes we were Alex well I
[1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:56.160]  agree from what we've seen in New York in San Antonio we have reporters other
[1:44:56.160 --> 1:45:01.480]  places everybody there has transcended party they understand the corruption of
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:05.400]  Wall Street through the intelligence agencies running the country robbing
[1:45:05.400 --> 1:45:11.120]  everybody they understand that and they're not run by the its professional
[1:45:11.120 --> 1:45:15.520]  left as you call them and it's really exciting when I'm saying is mainstream
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:21.160]  media who's losing their credibility as you said they are running this hoax that
[1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:27.240]  everybody basically you know just wants free education or something instead of
[1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:32.440]  about going after these corrupt monetary behemoths that are out there but
[1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:36.880]  shifting gears away from that we've got big issues like you said all these new
[1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:42.880]  wars and you talk about the stars lining up for Israel to go into Iran where
[1:45:42.880 --> 1:45:49.280]  do you see that going well I think we're at a particularly perilous moment here
[1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:56.240]  and there's lots to be said about this one is you know the former head of
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:01.920]  Mossad the Israeli external intelligence agency you know he said back in May
[1:46:01.920 --> 1:46:06.920]  look attacking Iran would be the stupid quote the stupidest thing I've ever
[1:46:06.920 --> 1:46:12.280]  heard and quote now why would he say something like that and why would he
[1:46:12.280 --> 1:46:18.200]  repeat that same that same line just two days ago well the reason he's doing
[1:46:18.200 --> 1:46:22.400]  that is because there is an active bunch around Netanyahu that would very much
[1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:28.080]  like to take advantage of what they see as a spineless United States president
[1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:33.960]  in an election year and start a war with Iran and automatically and I stress
[1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:40.200]  automatically involved the United States in it why well because Israel
[1:46:40.200 --> 1:46:45.320]  definitely needs something to divert attention from its strategic losses over
[1:46:45.320 --> 1:46:51.000]  this past year they've lost Egypt now this is no small thing Egypt has 72
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:55.400]  million people in it is real what six or seven million they lost in Lebanon four
[1:46:55.400 --> 1:47:01.120]  years ago yep they lost in Turkey and by work by their frivolous by this stupid
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:06.320]  stupidity and in killing eight Turks and what American on that first flotilla so
[1:47:06.320 --> 1:47:11.200]  and you know the the Palestinians a lot of them now have adopted Martin Luther
[1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:16.840]  King's tactics of nonviolent resistance and they master around Israel's borders
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:21.760]  on the on the anniversary of the knock-off earlier this year so Israel is
[1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:26.760]  in a new situation I would suggest that it's in a more dangerous situation more
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:31.800]  isolated than ever before and so they need something they need something to
[1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:35.560]  demonstrate that they're still real powerful by the way you have sources all
[1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:40.200]  over Washington but what you're saying is marrying what Panetta said just a few
[1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:45.480]  days ago and so are you saying this from your own analysis or sources or just
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:49.360]  reading what the Israelis are saying that they are moving towards a green
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:55.120]  light attack on Iran well Panetta met with their defense minister twice now
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:48:01.400]  within the past week okay this doesn't usually happen I think he's afraid and I
[1:48:01.400 --> 1:48:05.840]  think he has good reason to be afraid that this in Yahoo looking at our
[1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:11.320]  president and knowing that our president is not going to buck the Israel lobby
[1:48:11.320 --> 1:48:16.280]  the liquid lobby over the next year when he's running for president they look
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:20.440]  and they say you know this is probably our best window of opportunity to show
[1:48:20.440 --> 1:48:25.880]  to show the whole world that we have a staunch ally and it's the most important
[1:48:25.880 --> 1:48:30.440]  and the most powerful country in the world Mr. Yahoo said this explicitly and
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:36.000]  is meet the president if you two Sundays ago and so you know this in their view
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:40.640]  they will not only give a bloody nose to the Iranians that back their nuclear
[1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:45.480]  program forever but they'll they'll demonstrate to the world that they still
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:50.320]  count for something because despite Egypt despite Lebanon despite Turkey they
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:59.320]  have got the real powerful card in the hole and that we just lost Ray we'll get
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:03.560]  him back on I guess little phone troubles there of course you don't think
[1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:10.040]  that guy's got the establishment tapping his phone do you they did not want that
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:14.160]  information getting out or perhaps it was just a phone going dead it's just so
[1:49:14.160 --> 1:49:18.840]  annoying regardless of what side you're on this I'm neutral I'm sick of it I
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:23.800]  just want freedom I want to be left alone the Iranians are going to go
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:27.600]  absolutely wild when they get attacked they're gonna start attacking Israel the
[1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:30.360]  United States is going to be drawn in NATO is going to be drawn in in the
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:33.840]  middle of all these uprisings you know the globalists are going to stage
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:38.800]  attacks or Iran is going to launch an attack Ray you got cut off there yeah I
[1:49:38.800 --> 1:49:44.680]  was it wasn't and I say I'm told it was just nobody dropping the phone okay good
[1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:50.920]  during so you know it's just the it's a conjuncture of events besides the law
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:54.960]  that of course we know now that the Israelis have been given bunker
[1:49:54.960 --> 1:50:01.160]  buster bombs okay now what conceivable reason would they have to get bunker
[1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:06.640]  buster bombs they were approved by Bush they were granted 55 of them by Obama
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:13.960]  now those things are are really good for for destroying heavily concreted or
[1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:18.960]  whatever you call fortified it under underground sites now could they could
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:25.320]  they decimate these the nuclear site at Natanz where they're refining uranium no
[1:50:25.320 --> 1:50:29.960]  they couldn't but if they went through the same hole before five went through
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:34.960]  there yeah they probably could or you know Israelis have nukes as well so
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:39.200]  this is a very very dangerous situation if that's what they intend to do well
[1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:42.180]  they're also decapitation weapons as you know for destroying command and
[1:50:42.180 --> 1:50:46.520]  control bunkers stay there let's look at what briefly when I much time left with
[1:50:46.520 --> 1:50:51.320]  what will happen because the brakes go from bad to worse if Iran is attacked
[1:50:51.320 --> 1:50:55.280]  obviously all you know what will break loose which will be a nice political
[1:50:55.280 --> 1:51:00.560]  diversion here at home as well Ray McGoverns our guest

[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:40.960]  that goes through the nuances of it at consortium news now that I mentioned
[1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:46.040]  earlier but when you've got the Defense Secretary running back and forth
[1:54:46.040 --> 1:54:49.840]  meeting with the Israelis and coming out and saying they're isolated and the
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:53.960]  news saying they may strike and McGovern says that's the intel he's got and
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:54:58.320]  we're talking about the potential to start World War three but regardless it's
[1:54:58.320 --> 1:55:01.880]  gonna make things really bad and and you're saying the Israelis think they've
[1:55:01.880 --> 1:55:05.880]  got Obama where they want him and then I guess blackmail or whatever he'll do it
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:11.920]  well I asked someone yesterday an expert on the area Alex I said you know what
[1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:18.400]  do you think of this line of analysis that that Panetta is going to persuade
[1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:23.600]  the Israelis to hold off and not do this kind of thing and he's oh yeah yeah
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:28.840]  Panetta probably tell them and I thought wow you know yeah right they're
[1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:33.880]  gonna did Panetta has panache so to speak that our president doesn't have
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:38.120]  our president has told the Israelis you know please don't build any more
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:42.480]  settlement please don't attack attack people on the high seas and what do they
[1:55:42.480 --> 1:55:48.120]  do well there's a gesture that Nathaniel who has used it involves a thumb on the
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:53.360]  nose and waving fingers okay so the notion that if the Israelis see it in
[1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:58.760]  their interest to attack Iran or start a war with Iran and that Panetta by by his
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:02.320]  intervention here will be able to sell them a bill of goods you know that
[1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:08.280]  stretches credulity for me so what has to happen and what won't I'm afraid is
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:13.280]  that the president himself has to call up Netanyahu say look baby the game is up
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:18.480]  here you if you think I'm gonna support you when you run retaliates against you
[1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:23.800]  and me for starting a war forget it and I wish the president would do that but
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:28.840]  it's not in his genes it's certainly not in his backbone but the Pentagon
[1:56:28.840 --> 1:56:33.400]  doesn't like it Fox Fallon as you know didn't like it four years ago and had
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:37.640]  to step down because he wouldn't launch an attack I mean when the military you
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:41.920]  know on average like wars that's what they trained for it isn't wanting to do
[1:56:41.920 --> 1:56:46.600]  something that's because they know it's not the quote quagmire cakewalk of Iran
[1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:54.360]  or somewhere else of Iraq it's Iran and it leads down a very dark dark road and
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:58.680]  as you said how are they gonna spin it when I ran with asymmetrical warfare
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:04.920]  blocks the straight or moves turns sleeper cells loose in the West and I
[1:57:04.920 --> 1:57:08.280]  mean how are they gonna spin it when Iran strikes back I guess they'll just
[1:57:08.280 --> 1:57:12.400]  call it terrorism we bomb them and they struck back that's that's bad yeah well
[1:57:12.400 --> 1:57:17.520]  you know the rhetorical sound that way but you point out well you know Admiral
[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:22.000]  Mullen who just retired and I very regret he just retired because he was the
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  strongest on this he came back several times from Israel and said we told him
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:30.840]  please don't do this don't do this at all it wouldn't be a good idea and
[1:57:30.840 --> 1:57:34.360]  somebody asked him at a press conference well you know if they blocked the state
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:39.720]  with a straight or moves you could open it up couldn't you and Mullen it's all
[1:57:39.720 --> 1:57:46.000]  that hard and oh oh oh we are we could well how you look at those clips on
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:50.560]  straight or moves oh we good what Marines do you have available to scale
[1:57:50.560 --> 1:57:54.280]  those clips you know and how are you gonna avoid all these little PT boats
[1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:58.960]  each of which has a they lost a million and a half Iranians they're gonna human
[1:57:58.960 --> 1:58:02.320]  wave attack they're gonna be dug in it's gonna make the Japanese look like a
[1:58:02.320 --> 1:58:07.560]  cakewalk so the the question really is what about this successor to Mullen
[1:58:07.560 --> 1:58:15.440]  okay now who is this guy he's a guy put in place by Bobby Gates Cartwright the
[1:58:15.440 --> 1:58:19.520]  fellow who should have got the job was two independent spoke out his mind as
[1:58:19.520 --> 1:58:24.320]  told the president that the Afghanistan for example for example was
[1:58:24.320 --> 1:58:30.120]  reckless who's this new guy is he the sort of pliable kind of guy like others
[1:58:30.120 --> 1:58:33.080]  well Ray listen we're out of time I'm gonna have to have you back up in the
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:36.960]  next few days or maybe next week in the aftermath of the demonstrations thank you
[1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:40.720]  so much Ray McGoverns we'll be right back
[1:58:41.120 --> 1:58:49.520]  you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today
[1:58:52.040 --> 1:58:56.880]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[1:58:56.880 --> 1:59:01.480]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[1:59:01.480 --> 1:59:05.400]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[1:59:05.400 --> 1:59:10.080]  termed members influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:14.720]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:59:14.720 --> 1:59:19.080]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:59:19.080 --> 1:59:24.320]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[1:59:28.640 --> 1:59:32.120]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the

[2:00:20.640 --> 2:00:30.160]  Alex Jones. Well she's on the show the one the only Roseanne Barr she's an
[2:00:30.160 --> 2:00:34.000]  American actress comedian writer television producer and director she
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:37.920]  worked to extend up comedy until 85 appearance on the Tonight Show brought her
[2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:42.280]  to the limelight she is most famously known for her role in the ABC hit sitcom
[2:00:42.280 --> 2:00:49.080]  Roseanne which ran for nine seasons from 88 to 97. Barr won an Emmy in a Golden
[2:00:49.080 --> 2:00:53.680]  Globe a kids' choice award and three American comedy awards for her part in
[2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:59.160]  the show and on January 40, 2011 she released her third book titled Roseanne
[2:00:59.160 --> 2:01:04.320]  Archey Dispatches from the Nut Farm and so she's gotten a lot of national
[2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:08.400]  attention in the last week and there she is on the book cover for Prison Planet
[2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:12.520]  dot TV viewers dressed up I guess like Shea Guevara with an AK-47 with bombs
[2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:20.920]  dropping behind her. No it's not Shea Guevara. Who is it? It's all of them. Every desperate in the world including
[2:01:20.920 --> 2:01:28.840]  Rush Limbaugh. That's what the cigar is for. Oh okay so you're not saying
[2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:37.560]  communism's good. No I'm for the creation of an entirely new economic system.
[2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:42.320]  Well Roseanne you have got the floor then. Tell us what system you like to
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:48.720]  establish. Well one that works. I'd like to establish a system that actually is
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:53.800]  based on solutions to actual problems that exist in the world rather than the
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:02:00.840]  exploitation of those problems or the enrichment of a few. Okay tell us then
[2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:05.080]  you've got the floor. Tell us what the problems are and then what some basic
[2:02:05.080 --> 2:02:10.040]  solutions are. Oh boy well you know the problems are that we don't think we're
[2:02:10.040 --> 2:02:14.920]  not thinking outside of the box basically and we need to get out of our
[2:02:14.920 --> 2:02:19.960]  mind control program and come up with solutions to problems that exist in the
[2:02:19.960 --> 2:02:24.840]  world. Number one hunger. We have to come up with a you know a way to get the food
[2:02:24.840 --> 2:02:29.520]  to the hungry and if you saw you know which is like something that I think
[2:02:29.520 --> 2:02:33.600]  about a lot and you know a lot of people smarter than me think about too and a
[2:02:33.600 --> 2:02:37.760]  lot of people smarter and dumber than me don't think about that ever and you
[2:02:37.760 --> 2:02:41.160]  know I just think I just think it's something that we should call attention
[2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:47.200]  to actual problems of actual human beings instead of systems that don't work
[2:02:47.200 --> 2:02:54.720]  and obsolete ways of thinking about things. Why did you agree to come on this
[2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:57.880]  show? Max Kaiser sent us an email over and then we were contacted and I was
[2:02:57.880 --> 2:03:01.440]  flattered. Why did you agree to come on this show? I mean I would imagine you're
[2:03:01.440 --> 2:03:05.440]  getting asked on thousands of programs. I've just listened to you a lot and I
[2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:09.000]  think we have a lot that we agree on and there's a lot that we don't agree on
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  also but I really think that Americans and people in the world should start
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:17.760]  concentrating on things that they do agree with each other on so that we can
[2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:23.280]  arrive at solutions a lot faster. Well I think you know I mean we don't agree on
[2:03:23.280 --> 2:03:27.560]  a lot of things obviously but we do on others so why not? Sure okay well then
[2:03:27.560 --> 2:03:31.200]  just so my audience can really because that was my idea today I wanted to get
[2:03:31.200 --> 2:03:34.040]  you on and not just yell at you or disagree. I wanted to say were you
[2:03:34.040 --> 2:03:39.440]  serious about this quote or what's your true view? I mean the real Roseanne bar
[2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:43.120]  but before we do that because we're gonna come to break and come back and some
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:46.400]  stations join us then. What are some of the things you disagree with me on?
[2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:50.840]  Because I'm curious. I don't know why don't you ask me some questions. Okay the
[2:03:50.840 --> 2:03:57.960]  second amendment. The second amendment. Um well you know we probably agree there.
[2:03:57.960 --> 2:04:02.560]  I agree on all of the things that already exist and I you know I think that
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:08.360]  the only thing we don't agree on are economics isn't that true? Sure I mean
[2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:12.480]  look if you believe in the right to keep and bear arms and defend yourself. I have guns hell yeah I
[2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:17.240]  have guns rifles hell yes I do believe absolutely. Okay when a woman starts saying
[2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:21.160]  hell yes about guns I'm starting to find you really attractive right now. I'm a
[2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:25.640]  hell of a shot I'll tell you that I am I have always had a gun I've always had a
[2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:30.800]  rifle because I'm a farmer you know besides you know I mean I've always been
[2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:36.320]  attracted and and and loved farming since I got enough money to afford a
[2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:40.280]  farm which was when I did the Roseanne show I've always had. Roseanne we got to go
[2:04:40.280 --> 2:04:44.240]  to break. Long statement coming up. Wow this is dynamite. Roseanne bar is on with
[2:04:44.240 --> 2:04:48.480]  us and I learned she's a listener and Jaren by the way is a big fan out there
[2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:51.560]  he's out there bowing down right now saying he's not worthy. We'll be right
[2:04:51.560 --> 2:04:54.960]  back after this quick break with Roseanne bar. I'm Alex Jones and then

[2:06:00.720 --> 2:06:06.360]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[2:06:06.360 --> 2:06:11.080]  important day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything
[2:06:11.080 --> 2:06:15.400]  about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how
[2:06:15.400 --> 2:06:18.680]  you take care of your health and your own family. Now this man has made some
[2:06:18.680 --> 2:06:22.960]  outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is he's usually right. You
[2:06:22.960 --> 2:06:26.880]  see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's
[2:06:26.880 --> 2:06:30.760]  biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his
[2:06:30.760 --> 2:06:35.200]  work a dire prophecy. Recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[2:06:35.200 --> 2:06:38.600]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a
[2:06:38.600 --> 2:06:42.520]  real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this
[2:06:42.520 --> 2:06:45.920]  free video online today. He explains everything you need to know including

[2:07:02.120 --> 2:07:05.880]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number
[2:07:05.880 --> 2:07:09.640]  one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:07:09.640 --> 2:07:14.160]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[2:07:14.160 --> 2:07:18.600]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in
[2:07:18.600 --> 2:07:22.880]  the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of
[2:07:22.880 --> 2:07:26.400]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:30.160]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[2:07:30.160 --> 2:07:34.280]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of
[2:07:34.280 --> 2:07:37.560]  families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a
[2:07:37.560 --> 2:07:41.480]  solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:07:41.480 --> 2:07:44.640]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions
[2:07:44.640 --> 2:07:50.800]  from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[2:08:01.720 --> 2:08:08.880]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[2:08:08.880 --> 2:08:17.160]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Well, not one to shrink away from
[2:08:17.160 --> 2:08:22.640]  controversy. Roseanne Barr, who needs no introduction, on Max Kaiser's TV show
[2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:28.480]  of the weekend said, hey, re-education camps for the bankers if they won't, you
[2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:31.200]  know, pay more money in taxes that they make over a hundred million dollars a
[2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:36.120]  year or off with their heads and so when we found out she was a listener and we
[2:08:36.120 --> 2:08:39.080]  were excited to get her on and I was talking to her during the break. She
[2:08:39.080 --> 2:08:42.760]  says she even posts our videos and things on her own blog when she agrees
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:47.040]  with us. So we're going to explore all of that today and find out is she serious
[2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:52.440]  about the things she said and let her basically elaborate on it. So Roseanne,
[2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:55.680]  one of the biggest stories in the country, was your statements. Would you
[2:08:55.680 --> 2:09:02.800]  like to expand on those or clarify them? Well, you know, I gave a speech on
[2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:09.240]  Mother's Day last year in front of the White House where I, you know, announced
[2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:13.160]  my candidacy for president of the United States of America as well as
[2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:18.240]  Prime Minister of Israel. It's a twofer and it was based on the, you know,
[2:09:18.240 --> 2:09:26.320]  declaring patriarchal politics obsolete and I called for the dawn of divine
[2:09:26.320 --> 2:09:32.640]  matriarchy to descend to the planet. So that's kind of the context in which I
[2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:36.720]  spoke all of those things. But, you know, it's like I said the last segment, Alex,
[2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:43.280]  that I'm for a complete, completely new way of looking at things that have, that,
[2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:48.600]  you know, is congruent with the whole new century. So I just want to leave
[2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:53.000]  everything behind that doesn't work, which is basically everything, and start
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:58.080]  something new that actually does work and actually has, you know, a time limit to
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:02.480]  win a problem, to when problems can be solved. Like so I said that within the
[2:10:02.480 --> 2:10:07.760]  first year of my presidency, that I would legalize marijuana and end all
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:12.920]  wars, make war illegal, forgive all American debt and student loans, and, you
[2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:17.360]  know, I made some big statements. But if I am elected president of these United
[2:10:17.360 --> 2:10:22.640]  States, I will guarantee those things within the first 100 days of my presidency.
[2:10:22.640 --> 2:10:30.280]  What about your statement specifically, and we could play them again, but I mean,
[2:10:30.280 --> 2:10:35.680]  elaborate on reeducation camps, chopping off. Well, I was talking about that the
[2:10:35.680 --> 2:10:39.440]  people, you know, the people, the taxpayers of this country, as well, you
[2:10:39.440 --> 2:10:45.320]  know, as the citizens of this country, have a right to seek justice for what's
[2:10:45.320 --> 2:10:49.280]  been done to them, and people everywhere in every government all citizenry
[2:10:49.280 --> 2:10:54.960]  demand justice, and a system of just laws that they can actually exist under.
[2:10:54.960 --> 2:11:01.720]  Am I right? Yes. So I was saying that, you know, when an entire country has been
[2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:06.160]  fleeced and robbed, there needs to be a different set of just, there needs to be
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:09.560]  a different kind of justice that doesn't allow for that, and that actually
[2:11:09.560 --> 2:11:15.720]  punishes the guilty. So my statement was, you know, to explore what, what is the
[2:11:15.720 --> 2:11:22.040]  definition of guilty, and that, you know, it means being tried in a court not
[2:11:22.040 --> 2:11:26.560]  heavily weighted in your favor as now. Like, none of these bankers are being
[2:11:26.560 --> 2:11:31.080]  arrested, and then, and if, you know, like beside Martha Stewart, who's the only
[2:11:31.080 --> 2:11:35.000]  person who's ever been arrested for any kind of, like, insider trading, but, you
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:40.440]  know, once they're arrested, they would actually be tried in a court of law that
[2:11:40.440 --> 2:11:44.360]  they have not bought and paid for, so that's kind of what I'm, you know,
[2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:51.760]  pointing out the way things actually work in our country. So, you know, I'm
[2:11:51.760 --> 2:11:57.840]  trying to speak about a new definition of guilty, and it's like the worst of the
[2:11:57.840 --> 2:12:03.400]  worst of the worst of the guilty, you know, need to pay a price for what
[2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:10.600]  they've done. And specifically, were you serious about people that make a cap of
[2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:15.200]  $100 million a year? No, total wealth, $100 million. There's, there's
[2:12:15.200 --> 2:12:19.800]  absolutely, in my opinion, there's absolutely no idea to, no reason for
[2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:26.760]  anybody to be a bigger pig than to own $100 million. It's pig, it's a, just a
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:31.000]  pig culture that allows people to starve in the streets, and other people have
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  $100 million. I believe in normalization of economics, absolutely. What about
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:41.840]  people like Michael Moore, who I've read's worth around $200 million, constantly
[2:12:41.840 --> 2:12:47.280]  lecturing people that capitalism itself is bad. I mean, what do you think of
[2:12:47.280 --> 2:12:51.720]  Michael Moore A. and his statement that capitalism is the problem? Well, he's a
[2:12:51.720 --> 2:12:56.920]  very dear friend of mine, and you know, in many ways, I agree with a lot of what
[2:12:56.920 --> 2:13:01.520]  he says, like you, Alex, and in a lot of other ways, I don't agree with many of the
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:06.720]  things that he said, because I'm, I'm not, you know, I'm not just about dogma, I'm
[2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:11.360]  for human beings being able to speak to each other, particularly when they don't
[2:13:11.360 --> 2:13:16.400]  agree and come to a solution somewhere in the middle. But yes, I would take his
[2:13:16.400 --> 2:13:20.320]  wealth if it's over $100 million, although I would be more forgiving towards
[2:13:20.320 --> 2:13:27.240]  Michael, because I know how many people and how many, how many organizations he
[2:13:27.240 --> 2:13:31.520]  does support. So, you know, I would make some allowances. I mean, it isn't just,
[2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:37.080]  you know, I wouldn't be, you know, like Stalin or anything. Well, there's always,
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:42.320]  there's always people that make... I wouldn't take Olive Oprah either, because she does good things, like,
[2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:46.760]  you know, if people were doing good things with over $100 million, besides
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:50.280]  figuring out, sitting in little cubicles and figuring out how to move numbers so
[2:13:50.280 --> 2:13:56.360]  that they can steal more money, I would be more forgiving towards them. My issue is,
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:14:00.240]  Michael Moore is calling for a middle-class tax increase, then that money
[2:14:00.240 --> 2:14:04.040]  is stolen and paid to bankers and banker bailouts. So, when I talk to the
[2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:10.400]  classical mainline left out there, I try to explain to them that big socialist
[2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:15.360]  systems actually get financed by the offshore banks, because they can then take
[2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:19.640]  control of the government and steal that wealth. I absolutely agree with you on
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:24.320]  that, and like I say, and people should know, I, you know, I consider myself left
[2:14:24.320 --> 2:14:30.160]  of some and not left of others. So, I'm more of a person in the middle. Whatever
[2:14:30.160 --> 2:14:36.040]  works. Now, what was this point about reeducation camps?
[2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:40.520]  Bankers, that's for the guilty, because I wouldn't want to immediately behead the
[2:14:40.520 --> 2:14:45.240]  guilty who's stolen, like, the entire wealth of communities and created poverty
[2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:50.520]  and terror within, you know, every community on earth that they've gone
[2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:55.440]  to and devalued the currency and then brought about food shortages
[2:14:55.440 --> 2:15:00.760]  shortly after. I would, because I'm a compassionate human, I would allow them to,
[2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:05.800]  like, actually go and be reeducated. It wouldn't be straight to the guillotine.
[2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:10.720]  It would be to the guillotine when they are found guilty and do nothing about it
[2:15:10.720 --> 2:15:15.080]  and try to continue. Then they would be beheaded. So, I think that, you know, I
[2:15:15.080 --> 2:15:19.880]  have, I have it laid out to be as fair as anybody's ever been.
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:23.520]  All right, so you're definitely not an anti-death penalty person.
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:27.640]  No, I love the death penalty, and I just wish that we would use it against the
[2:15:27.640 --> 2:15:34.240]  guilty rather than the innocent. I, it seems like we rush to kill a lot of
[2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:39.880]  people who are, you know, not proven, you know, like, you know, like Troy Davis.
[2:15:39.880 --> 2:15:44.320]  I mean, a lot of people wonder if the guy was innocent or not in a flawed system,
[2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:48.880]  but yet Casey Anthony walks free. So, I just think that we need to rethink
[2:15:48.880 --> 2:15:54.240]  everything so that it makes sense and that it's one rule of law that applies
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:57.000]  to everyone, whether they're rich or a priest.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:01.480]  Okay, let's take your book cover for a moment. You are dressed up.
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:05.200]  It, it, it, I said, it looks like Shea Guevara with a cigar. And earlier, you said,
[2:16:05.200 --> 2:16:10.320]  no, no, no, the cigar symbolizes, right? Go ahead. No, no, no. Tell us what your book
[2:16:10.320 --> 2:16:14.800]  cover means. Well, I guess that if my, you know, my, my meaning there might, might
[2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:19.000]  have been lost, but it is about all despots. You'll see, like, you know,
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:23.200]  there's the Mao in there with the red star and the whole, you know, it's about
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:28.440]  all male despots that I'm kind of like taking over for, getting rid of them,
[2:16:28.440 --> 2:16:34.200]  bringing me on. Rose Anarchy, if you read the book, is full of solutions to, you
[2:16:34.200 --> 2:16:38.880]  know, everyday problems that people face in a comical way.
[2:16:38.880 --> 2:16:41.560]  I never get why, because I see this on the street with some of the anarchists,
[2:16:41.560 --> 2:16:46.480]  they dress with communist stars on and call for communism, but call themselves
[2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:49.520]  anarchists. And I always wonder why that's the most popular combination. I would
[2:16:49.520 --> 2:16:53.080]  think is communism is pretty much the opposite. I know they say in the end game
[2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:57.560]  of communism, the state withers away, but that, that, that never seems to, seems
[2:16:57.560 --> 2:17:02.960]  to happen. That's true. That's true. But in Rose Anarchy, you know, it, it, it
[2:17:02.960 --> 2:17:07.400]  would definitely not need to wither away because it would, the state would not
[2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:14.760]  even exist. Rose Anbar is our guest. Rose An, seriously. I would think mothers and
[2:17:14.760 --> 2:17:18.520]  grandmothers, Alex, they know how to run neighborhoods. And that's what Rose
[2:17:18.520 --> 2:17:24.040]  Anarchy is about. It's about female intelligence, which is always overlooked.
[2:17:24.040 --> 2:17:28.200]  And none of these politicians ever listen to anything that women do. And women
[2:17:28.200 --> 2:17:33.320]  are problem solvers. And that's what I'm for, putting women in, you know, in
[2:17:33.320 --> 2:17:37.160]  positions of power where they can actually solve problems rather than
[2:17:37.160 --> 2:17:42.640]  exploit them to be able to get at women. Now, would this be a dictatorship of
[2:17:42.640 --> 2:17:48.840]  women? No, just a dictatorship of me. And I would be, you know, I call, I would
[2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:53.640]  call myself the titular head of the grand, of the grandmothers tribunal that
[2:17:53.640 --> 2:18:01.040]  would, you know, issue, that would bring in, excuse me, a world of solutions from
[2:18:01.040 --> 2:18:07.440]  top to bottom. Now, where would the guillotines be located? Probably in the
[2:18:07.440 --> 2:18:10.680]  public square, right in front of the White House, I think is, you know, because I
[2:18:10.680 --> 2:18:15.120]  mean, that's the people's, you know, the center of people's politics. So that's
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:20.480]  probably the best place. And that's a real nice park there. How many, how many
[2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:26.000]  heads do you think will be chopped off? You know, not too many. I think that once
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:29.320]  they knew that there was ultimate justice headed their way, that they would
[2:18:29.320 --> 2:18:33.200]  really change their tune. And, you know, I think that people should be forced to
[2:18:33.200 --> 2:18:37.720]  share and forced to care. I really do. Now, wait a minute, though, because I
[2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:41.800]  understand this is feminine, divine, goddess stuff that you're offering us.
[2:18:41.800 --> 2:18:49.360]  What I'm trying to get at here, though, Rosanne, is Stalin and Malinol, them, they
[2:18:49.360 --> 2:18:53.680]  were making people share. But I mean, how is this going to be different then?
[2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:58.840]  Well, because, you know, it will be smaller groups of people taking care of
[2:18:58.840 --> 2:19:04.480]  each other, you know, instead of like one, a huge, monolithic, unbendable
[2:19:04.480 --> 2:19:09.600]  bureaucracy that does nothing but rob people. Sure. Let's shift gears for a
[2:19:09.600 --> 2:19:12.600]  moment if we may, and you can bring up any subject you'd like. This is
[2:19:12.600 --> 2:19:18.560]  riveting information. What do you think of Obama and his Wall Street connections?
[2:19:18.560 --> 2:19:22.040]  I've never seen stronger ones. You may disagree. And the field of Republican
[2:19:22.040 --> 2:19:26.720]  candidates. Oh, well, you know, I'm thinking of running as a Republican. I'm
[2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:31.400]  just telling you that because I think that everything I say isn't that much
[2:19:31.400 --> 2:19:37.880]  weirder than the things they say, which was kind of my point. But Obama, I did
[2:19:37.880 --> 2:19:44.160]  not vote for Obama. And I, you know, I knew that Obama, I knew that Obama got
[2:19:44.160 --> 2:19:48.960]  more Wall Street money than anybody ever had gotten before. And I was really
[2:19:48.960 --> 2:19:54.200]  scared because most, a large percentage of the money he got came from nuclear
[2:19:54.200 --> 2:19:59.160]  power, you know, corporations that have to do with that. So I was horrified by
[2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:06.680]  that. And, you know, but I mean, we have to have somebody as our president. What
[2:20:06.680 --> 2:20:11.120]  do you think of Jesse Ventura? Because I think I'm better than all of them. What do
[2:20:11.120 --> 2:20:14.640]  you think about Jesse Ventura or is he bad too? I like him. Actually, I really love
[2:20:14.640 --> 2:20:19.280]  that guy. Do you like him? Yeah, he's a good friend of mine, but he hasn't, he has
[2:20:19.280 --> 2:20:24.200]  wavos though. You're saying this used to be a woman thing. No, I would, I would, you
[2:20:24.200 --> 2:20:28.080]  know, I will allow male males to serve if they have half a brain in their head.
[2:20:28.080 --> 2:20:32.480]  And I do think that Jesse Ventura has, you know, more than half of a brain in
[2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:36.440]  his head. So I would allow him to actually serve our structure. Well, that is,
[2:20:36.440 --> 2:20:40.040]  thank you. Because he has a lot of ethics too. I interviewed him, you know, when I
[2:20:40.040 --> 2:20:45.440]  did a radio show also. And, you know, before he got his television show, he's
[2:20:45.440 --> 2:20:50.720]  just, he's just a great thinker. He is really a nice guy. And he's more of a
[2:20:50.720 --> 2:20:56.200]  libertarian though. I don't know if he'd like a dictator, but yeah, but I'm a
[2:20:56.200 --> 2:21:01.400]  different kind of a dictator than the ones before. I'm a good dictator. I
[2:21:01.400 --> 2:21:09.360]  understand the first in history. Yes, absolutely. The first in history. Oh,
[2:21:09.360 --> 2:21:14.720]  man. Okay. What about Ron Paul? What do you think of Ron Paul? You know, I can't,
[2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:20.000]  like again, there's, there's, there's just so many brilliant things that he says
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:24.880]  and stands for. And I agree with most of it, but I don't, you know, the libertarian
[2:21:24.880 --> 2:21:30.600]  thing, I don't know. And I don't, I don't see any real feminist subtext to any of
[2:21:30.600 --> 2:21:34.920]  it. So I'm not. I just think he's into freedom for everybody. Huh? I just think
[2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:39.760]  he's into total freedom, period. Just his freedom, period. Yeah, but it's too much
[2:21:39.760 --> 2:21:43.240]  freedom for rich people. And I just think like you shouldn't have a lot of
[2:21:43.240 --> 2:21:46.320]  freedom to rip off their shit. You shouldn't have the right to have the
[2:21:46.320 --> 2:21:50.400]  freedom to rip off the wealth of the entire community. Yeah, but Ron Paul would
[2:21:50.400 --> 2:21:53.320]  say they were able to do that because they controlled the government and use
[2:21:53.320 --> 2:21:57.000]  that monopoly of force. Now, let's talk about Hank Williams. I don't disagree. I
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:02.440]  don't completely disagree with that. Let's talk about Hank Williams Jr. He, he, the
[2:22:02.440 --> 2:22:06.680]  full clip, he said 89% want to fire all of Congress. I don't like any of the
[2:22:06.680 --> 2:22:11.840]  Republican candidates. And he went on to compare. He didn't say who was Hitler,
[2:22:11.840 --> 2:22:17.480]  but he said Benjamin Netanyahu and Hitler, like Bonner, I mean, Boehner,
[2:22:17.480 --> 2:22:23.240]  and Obama. Do you think he should have lost his Money Night Football gig over
[2:22:23.240 --> 2:22:28.720]  that? No, I don't think anybody should. You know, I think we should have freedom
[2:22:28.720 --> 2:22:32.920]  of speech. The guy, you know, he makes a lot of people. He made a lot of people
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:37.840]  mad with that. But, you know, a lot of people need to get mad. A lot of people
[2:22:37.840 --> 2:22:41.800]  need to be more offended in this country and wake up. I mean, they've been lulled
[2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:47.800]  with their Prozac and their Zoloft into this complete flat job drooling, you know,
[2:22:47.800 --> 2:22:51.960]  apathy. So anything that wakes people up and, you know, pisses them off for a
[2:22:51.960 --> 2:22:56.880]  minute and gets their brain re-engaged, that's a good thing, I think. I don't
[2:22:56.880 --> 2:23:02.160]  agree with what he said, but I understand the spirit in which he said it,
[2:23:02.160 --> 2:23:10.560]  because I've been drunk a lot, too, in my life. I understand. Let's talk about 9-11
[2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:15.320]  truth. You say you've been a listener for a while, and we know government
[2:23:15.320 --> 2:23:18.720]  staged the gall of the Tonkin to get us into Vietnam, and we know that Hitler
[2:23:18.720 --> 2:23:23.760]  blew up the Reichstag to set up a police state and go from an elected leader to
[2:23:23.760 --> 2:23:28.320]  a dictator in Germany. So we know governments and corporations stage
[2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:31.280]  things to blame it on their enemies throughout history, so I don't think it's
[2:23:31.280 --> 2:23:36.600]  crazy to then question the official story of 9-11. It has a lot of holes in it.
[2:23:36.600 --> 2:23:41.320]  Rosanne, what did you think the day of 9-11, and since then, what is your view
[2:23:41.320 --> 2:23:46.960]  of that tragic event? Well, you know, I'm for, like, you know, I definitely think
[2:23:46.960 --> 2:23:50.680]  we need to keep investigating it till everybody's satisfied that they've heard
[2:23:50.680 --> 2:23:56.440]  the truth, so, you know, but I, you know, I agree with a lot of the stuff that
[2:23:56.440 --> 2:24:00.280]  truthers, as they're called, say, and I don't agree with a lot of other things
[2:24:00.280 --> 2:24:05.280]  that they say. What do you agree with? I mean, like, Building 7, we have police
[2:24:05.280 --> 2:24:08.640]  saying, get back, they're gonna blow it up, and then there's bomb blast, and it
[2:24:08.640 --> 2:24:13.560]  falls at freefall. Yeah, I know all that. I mean, I read all the stuff about that,
[2:24:13.560 --> 2:24:17.560]  too, and a lot of people always send me, you know, a lot of information that I
[2:24:17.560 --> 2:24:22.520]  post on my blog, rosanneworld.com, about it. So, you know, I don't know, but I
[2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:28.520]  think it's definitely worth a huge look, you know, what I mean? What do you think?
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:33.440]  Oh, I know it was a completely synthetic manufactured event. Our government just
[2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:37.280]  gave Al-Qaeda control of Libya and gave them thousands of heat-seeking missiles,
[2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:42.040]  and they're already saying they need to invade Libya from the liberators they put
[2:24:42.040 --> 2:24:45.800]  in, and then I've got to let the TSA stick their hands down my pants or grab
[2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:51.800]  my wife's breast or molest my children, or Al-Qaeda's gonna shoot a rocket at me.
[2:24:51.800 --> 2:24:58.160]  What's your view of the TSA? Oh, I just, it drives me out of my mind, but, you know,
[2:24:58.160 --> 2:25:01.240]  it just drives me out of my mind, but I don't want to go get the, I don't want to
[2:25:01.240 --> 2:25:05.840]  go through the radiation, because, I mean, I'm an old woman, so, I mean, I've been
[2:25:05.840 --> 2:25:12.520]  radiated so many times, you know, you know, mammograms, teeth, everything. I don't
[2:25:12.520 --> 2:25:17.080]  need any more radiation. I don't think any more citizens do either, so, I always
[2:25:17.080 --> 2:25:23.480]  opt out and, you know, just, you know, they, they, you know, inspect you by hand,
[2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:28.720]  but, you know, I always kind of think that it's kind of cool that I do that so
[2:25:28.720 --> 2:25:33.920]  that people can see it happening to me, so I kind of offer myself and just stand
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:38.160]  there, because I just want Americans to realize that that is happening, but they
[2:25:38.160 --> 2:25:47.160]  do grow old women, and, you know, begin to wake up and look at it. Well, I know
[2:25:47.160 --> 2:25:51.480]  that I won't fly with my family because of it, and now they're trying to set up
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:56.200]  domestic checkpoints. They grope everybody from the ankles up to the neck to
[2:25:56.200 --> 2:26:00.960]  get into an NFL game now. And then, and then they tell you, too, they go, now I'm
[2:26:00.960 --> 2:26:07.360]  going to use the back of my hand to touch your genital area. I won't use my palm.
[2:26:07.360 --> 2:26:13.200]  It's just so friggin' ridiculous that I actually kind of, I mean, I hate to make
[2:26:13.200 --> 2:26:17.480]  light of it, but we kind of have to laugh more, because I think laughing things
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:22.360]  to scorn is, is really powerful. So, I would just stand there and everybody,
[2:26:22.360 --> 2:26:26.680]  hey, look, there's Roseanne from, or else they think Rosie O'Donnell, and she's
[2:26:26.680 --> 2:26:30.760]  getting felt up. I mean, I just think that the more visible we can be, the
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:38.240]  better. Now, you've got several websites. You've got Roseanneworld.com, and you've
[2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:42.600]  got some others, too. Well, I'm on Twitter, the real Roseanne. But, Alex, let me
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:48.040]  ask you, who do you think give, I mean, like seriously, who do you think took
[2:26:48.040 --> 2:26:55.000]  those towers down? The military industrial complex with private corporate
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:59.880]  rogue networks inside of it use drills to confuse the rest of the government as a
[2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:06.080]  cover and stage the events of 9-11. The few real phone calls, not the fake ones
[2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:10.640]  that were confirmed to not have been made, but the real air phone calls by
[2:27:10.640 --> 2:27:15.520]  the stewardess people were reporting gas that was knocking people out. So, they
[2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:18.720]  got on board, they nerve-gassed them, they had the hijackers who were US
[2:27:18.720 --> 2:27:22.360]  government agents who we know were training at US military bases to take
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:27.000]  part in drills, and James Woods had been a few weeks before on a flight with
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:30.440]  them doing a hijacking drill. And so, they got on board taking part in
[2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:34.480]  national-level exercise. They were nerve-gassed and remote-controlled through
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:43.440]  the aircraft in the buildings. Dude, why would they do that? Why? To blame
[2:27:43.440 --> 2:27:46.960]  Iraq and launch a war there and get trillions in oil, trillions in weapons
[2:27:46.960 --> 2:27:51.400]  sales, to go into Afghanistan 500 billion a year in opium, have the troops
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:54.480]  suddenly grow it as they now do, and to set up a domestic police state and
[2:27:54.480 --> 2:28:00.360]  overturn the Bill of Rights and Constitution. Okay, I think you nailed it.
[2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:05.520]  So, you agree we should have a new investigation of 9-11? Of course, of
[2:28:05.520 --> 2:28:09.840]  course. What do you like that truthers say? You said some of it you like, some of
[2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:17.440]  it you don't. Well, you know, I think, you know, I just have a broader view like
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:21.640]  you do, because really what you're saying and what I'm saying is that, you
[2:28:21.640 --> 2:28:26.280]  know, power is just being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. Isn't that what
[2:28:26.280 --> 2:28:30.840]  you're really saying? Yes, the centralization of power. Yeah, and it's
[2:28:30.840 --> 2:28:37.200]  just like, you know, it can't be more than, what, about 50 people? Yeah, they're
[2:28:37.200 --> 2:28:40.160]  less than 20 families that pretty much have stolen the whole planet and they've
[2:28:40.160 --> 2:28:47.880]  got 6,000 superclasses, as they call it, that serve them. I totally agree with you
[2:28:47.880 --> 2:28:52.120]  on that. Would you like to, let's name some of those people. What do you think, I
[2:28:52.120 --> 2:28:56.040]  call them Monsatans. What do you think of the Monsatans family and what they're
[2:28:56.040 --> 2:29:01.080]  doing to food? Monsanto is one of the most wicked companies, probably the most
[2:29:01.080 --> 2:29:05.880]  wicked. Did you know they're a family, a Southern American family? I did know
[2:29:05.880 --> 2:29:12.240]  that it had some founding family roots in it, but I, you know, Rosanne, this is
[2:29:12.240 --> 2:29:16.160]  too much here. You've been gracious with 25-30 minutes with us and I know you've
[2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:19.760]  got other things coming up. We've got to go to break. I already skipped one. Could
[2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:24.760]  we come back and talk about Monsatans? Yeah. Okay, awesome. Because I'm a farmer, yeah.
[2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:28.640]  Okay, well, let's talk about it with Rosanne Barr on the other side and then
[2:29:28.640 --> 2:29:33.240]  freeway Ricky Ross who trafficked drugs to the CIA. He's coming up a little bit
[2:29:33.240 --> 2:29:36.440]  after that. Well, obviously, he has to do some overdrive today with Ricky Ross.
[2:29:36.440 --> 2:29:40.440]  It's all coming up. Rosanne Barr is our guest right now. We'll call this the
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:52.320]  off of their heads episode of the radio show. Stay with us. We're on the march, the
[2:29:52.320 --> 2:29:59.720]  Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:05.480]  Steve Shank here with a special alert from eFoods Direct. The stock market
[2:30:05.480 --> 2:30:09.840]  continues to crash and re-crash daily. Since July, the market has dropped 15%
[2:30:09.840 --> 2:30:14.360]  with no signs of recovery. What does that mean to you? When stocks crash, jobs are
[2:30:14.360 --> 2:30:18.680]  lost and you can't buy the food that's already too expensive and continues to
[2:30:18.680 --> 2:30:23.040]  raise in cost. eFoods just got noticed that wholesale costs on pasta, rice, and
[2:30:23.040 --> 2:30:27.560]  beans will immediately jump 20%. The already high cost of sugar is tripling.
[2:30:27.560 --> 2:30:31.480]  If you invest in the stock market for security or save money in the bank, you
[2:30:31.480 --> 2:30:35.560]  continue to see the dollar drop in value while your weekly food bills increase.
[2:30:35.560 --> 2:30:39.280]  So what are you going to do? Get as much food now as you can. With these
[2:30:39.280 --> 2:30:43.200]  problems you're facing, eFoods Direct has no choice but to extend the free
[2:30:43.200 --> 2:30:47.000]  shipping another week to October 9th. Free shipping buys more food with

[2:32:04.880 --> 2:32:11.200]  Terany is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says
[2:32:11.200 --> 2:32:15.960]  that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the
[2:32:15.960 --> 2:32:20.480]  most impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the
[2:32:20.480 --> 2:32:25.480]  existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This
[2:32:25.480 --> 2:32:29.520]  documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an
[2:32:29.520 --> 2:32:33.920]  old powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which
[2:32:33.920 --> 2:32:38.680]  our Republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency
[2:32:38.680 --> 2:32:44.640]  dictatorship. Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on
[2:32:44.640 --> 2:32:48.720]  every street corner. It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[2:32:48.720 --> 2:32:55.440]  The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com

[2:33:11.440 --> 2:33:18.120]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on
[2:33:18.120 --> 2:33:23.520]  the GCN radio network. Alright Ricky Ross is already scheduled to be with us. We
[2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:29.280]  pushed him back. What a wild show. Ray McGovern, Freeway Ricky Ross, the big CIA
[2:33:29.280 --> 2:33:33.600]  drug trafficker, biggest in history, makes you know fictional characters like
[2:33:33.600 --> 2:33:37.920]  Scarface look like a choir boy, and Roseanne Barr on with us and to learn
[2:33:37.920 --> 2:33:41.240]  that she's been listening to the show for years and that she's into the Second
[2:33:41.240 --> 2:33:47.200]  Amendment. Now Roseanne, I understand. A lot of people confuse me with
[2:33:47.200 --> 2:33:52.280]  Rosie O'Donnell who's also a friend of mine, but she doesn't. She's for gun
[2:33:52.280 --> 2:33:55.840]  control, so you know she did a big show on it and they're like, I get a lot of
[2:33:55.840 --> 2:34:00.320]  emails from people going, I hated when you told Tom Selleck and I'm like dude
[2:34:00.320 --> 2:34:05.520]  that was Rosie O'Donnell. I'm poor gun. Well you don't look much like her, so I
[2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:11.240]  don't I don't know why. We're both named Rosie, so that's kind of you know a lot of
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:14.320]  people in this country that's all. Well that brings me to my next point and then
[2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:16.800]  I want to get into GMOs with you and we'll let you go. Hopefully have you
[2:34:16.800 --> 2:34:19.880]  back up because I know you're a busy person, but you just hit the nail on the
[2:34:19.880 --> 2:34:23.000]  head there. Half the people in the airport or whatever think that you're
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:30.240]  Rosie O'Donnell, not Roseanne Barr, so I understand a lot of this is satire, but I
[2:34:30.240 --> 2:34:35.440]  don't, but you know what? Satire, you know, satire just offers people a
[2:34:35.440 --> 2:34:39.480]  different and deeper way to look at things, so it's not like baseless. The
[2:34:39.480 --> 2:34:44.320]  things I'm saying are not baseless, even though there's a satirical edge to it,
[2:34:44.320 --> 2:34:47.400]  of course, but I mean these are real things that we really need to look at
[2:34:47.400 --> 2:34:53.640]  about a different set of justice for the American people and for bankers. We
[2:34:53.640 --> 2:34:57.440]  really need to look at that. But here's what I want to tell you. The bankers, if
[2:34:57.440 --> 2:35:03.000]  you read Tragedy and Hope written for the CIA in the 60s, they actually use a
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:08.760]  form of collectivism to get us dependent and to destroy the middle class so
[2:35:08.760 --> 2:35:13.200]  that they can control us. Just like you, during the break you were saying the key
[2:35:13.200 --> 2:35:17.560]  is the bread basket, getting people back on the land, farmers. I agree with you.
[2:35:17.560 --> 2:35:21.280]  Everything these bankers do in their New World Order is about making us
[2:35:21.280 --> 2:35:25.360]  dependent. That's what Monsanto is about, where your seeds won't generate new
[2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:30.280]  seeds. Absolutely, that's why I moved to Hawaii where I have a farm now because
[2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:34.880]  that is ground zero of, you know, the University of Hawaii is ground zero for
[2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:39.760]  experiments by Monsanto on alfalfa and other things that actually destroy
[2:35:39.760 --> 2:35:46.240]  native crops. It is just so horrifying, so horrible that they that they would be
[2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:50.920]  feeding the American people plastic and we don't even have a choice and they're
[2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:55.120]  arresting people for growing vegetables. This is not a joke. They're arresting
[2:35:55.120 --> 2:36:00.680]  people for growing heirloom seeds and vegetables. No, no, no. This is precious food.
[2:36:00.680 --> 2:36:05.040]  In the United States of America, are you kidding me? This is definitely the time
[2:36:05.040 --> 2:36:09.720]  that we need to look at who is in charge of what and you know get rid of all
[2:36:09.720 --> 2:36:15.240]  of the people in Congress and all of government who do not serve the American
[2:36:15.240 --> 2:36:20.680]  people. So in that we totally agree, right, Alex? Yes, we do agree and the
[2:36:20.680 --> 2:36:25.480]  tyranny is just getting crazier and crazier. It's completely insane. Completely
[2:36:25.480 --> 2:36:31.560]  insane. These people are sociopaths. You know, they're just, you know, I can't
[2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:38.320]  even believe like you. I can't believe how they have flipped into positions of
[2:36:38.320 --> 2:36:43.200]  power where, you know, they're feeding us. I'm serious. They are feeding our kids
[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:48.640]  plastic junk. They're trying to turn us into cyborgs or something. No, they are.
[2:36:48.640 --> 2:36:52.800]  I don't know. Wow, you just hit it. The globalist, the social engineers admit they
[2:36:52.800 --> 2:36:57.800]  want us so poisoned just like Monsanto wants to infect all the major crops so
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:01.080]  that you don't have a choice anymore and then you've got to have scientists come
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:05.120]  in and quote fix things with their patents for the life cycle just like
[2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:08.680]  they have the chemtrails doing weather modification and in Hawaii and other
[2:37:08.680 --> 2:37:13.440]  areas. Aluminum is going off the chart. Monsanto is now coming out with a hole
[2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:19.600]  in barium. They're coming out with a whole line of now aluminum resistant
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:23.480]  crops so that you have to buy for Monsanto. It's the same thing. They're
[2:37:23.480 --> 2:37:28.600]  poisoning. What about the spring? What about the chemtrail stuff of spring
[2:37:28.600 --> 2:37:35.040]  barium to kill our food? Totally true. It's part of our food. You have a sure view on chemtrails,
[2:37:35.040 --> 2:37:39.840]  geoengineering? Well, it's just, you know, they're, you know, they're poisoning us
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:44.040]  and our food and it's all about that. It's all about that. So like I say, it's
[2:37:44.040 --> 2:37:49.400]  the exact same people that are, you know, getting all the power into their hands,
[2:37:49.400 --> 2:37:54.720]  all the power for food. Next is privatizing water. I imagine they'll do
[2:37:54.720 --> 2:38:00.080]  air after that. I mean, if we don't stand up now and do something together and
[2:38:00.080 --> 2:38:05.040]  find a way to agree with people instead of like, we can't 100% agree and this is
[2:38:05.040 --> 2:38:09.960]  me and you, Alex. We can't 100% agree with everything that each of us believes,
[2:38:09.960 --> 2:38:16.480]  but we can 75% agree and we'd better do it. We'd better find a way for tea
[2:38:16.480 --> 2:38:21.320]  partyers and liberals and lefties and whoever. We better come up with a
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:27.400]  solution and all get together and use it. Well, expanding on your cyborg comment,
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:30.080]  just like they want to take over the biosphere and make us dependent on them
[2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:34.480]  for food, they admit they want to make us so sick that then only super
[2:38:34.480 --> 2:38:38.960]  technologies can keep us alive. They know why, but also because of peasant
[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:43.480]  insurance, because bosses take out insurance on their workers and then they
[2:38:43.480 --> 2:38:49.200]  can poison and get a payoff when they die. You know, people really ought to take
[2:38:49.200 --> 2:38:53.920]  a look at how the insurance company is the work, you know, to help steal
[2:38:53.920 --> 2:38:57.640]  everything from communities in this country, too. Wow, you know, it did come
[2:38:57.640 --> 2:39:01.440]  out to Walmart and others. You think they're hiring that elderly person as a
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:04.760]  greeter because they care about them and people say how sweet. They have
[2:39:04.760 --> 2:39:09.880]  actuaries where they hire the most old and most sick. They know statistically
[2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:14.000]  when they're going to die and then they get a payoff. And that's exactly why I'm
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:18.400]  talking about, you know, rose anarchy because of the fact that my generation of
[2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:24.120]  baby boomer women, those are, we are the, we are the guinea pigs for all of those
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:28.880]  crazy experiments and now our daughters, too, with, you know, those Rick, Terry,
[2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:33.920]  Forrest, Wart, what do you call them, Injection? Yeah, Gardasil, that was my final
[2:39:33.920 --> 2:39:38.800]  question. They are just using my generation of women as guinea pigs to try
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:43.640]  to figure out different ways of killing us because they're psychopaths and then
[2:39:43.640 --> 2:39:48.760]  they get a payoff every time one of us dies. They get a payoff. Well, Roseanne,
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:52.560]  you're absolutely right. And we have the documents where they put the cancer
[2:39:52.560 --> 2:39:56.560]  viruses and the polio shots there. They're still doing it. Rick Perry lying and
[2:39:56.560 --> 2:40:00.800]  saying it's the law to take the shot. It doesn't even protect you. Guaranteed Rick
[2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:06.760]  Perry will hear about this. What's your message to Rick Perry? My message is to
[2:40:06.760 --> 2:40:11.520]  everyone and everyone in power with very few exceptions. I mean, there's some
[2:40:11.520 --> 2:40:20.280]  people, it's a big half view. Well, I figured that it was part serious, part
[2:40:20.280 --> 2:40:25.160]  satire, what was on Max Kaiser. So before I really went after. I really think that
[2:40:25.160 --> 2:40:30.960]  there are people who deserve to, you know, they deserve the ultimate punishment
[2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:35.960]  because they're so horrible and so hideous and sitting there living the way
[2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:40.320]  they do taking those payoffs from people from like making people sick. I mean, you
[2:40:40.320 --> 2:40:43.920]  don't think that they deserve that? No, no, but I'm just saying the way you talked
[2:40:43.920 --> 2:40:47.400]  about it in the cover of the book and the way the media spawn it. That's why I
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:51.760]  wanted to have you here. Do you agree with me that like there should be the
[2:40:51.760 --> 2:40:57.840]  ultimate that these people who are that horrible that they do deserve just
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:41:02.400]  exactly what I said. Yes, yeah. Bayer Pharmaceutical was convicted in France
[2:41:02.400 --> 2:41:06.520]  didn't get in trouble anywhere else. Knownly, the other actually were Nazis.
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:11.120]  Shipping out blood tainted with HIV and hepatitis. You don't think that those
[2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:14.120]  people deserve the guillotine? No, I think they should after a jury of their
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:17.040]  peers, they should be hauled up and then they should be sent to prison. They
[2:41:17.040 --> 2:41:21.680]  should be executed. Well, we totally agree then and I'm talking about the guilty,
[2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:26.520]  the worst of the guilty. I don't think we reeducate them. You can't
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:30.040]  reeducate somebody that knows for a decade they're shipping out blood that
[2:41:30.040 --> 2:41:34.680]  is a death sentence to little hemophiliacs. I mean, their memos went
[2:41:34.680 --> 2:41:37.840]  public. They did it on purpose and the people that did that should be given the
[2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:41.120]  death penalty. Of course, they should die. Well, then we totally agree. Don't
[2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:44.080]  we? I mean, you can't let vampires like that run around in a lot of day. You
[2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:47.600]  gotta put I do call them vampires. I definitely do. And I say the good thing
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:51.680]  about vampires is that light, the more light we can bring the faster they die
[2:41:51.680 --> 2:41:56.880]  off. Well, look, the media did take out a context what you said and and I
[2:41:56.880 --> 2:41:59.480]  wanted to find it because I'd seen some things you said I agreed with over the
[2:41:59.480 --> 2:42:03.560]  years, some that I didn't. I wanted to find out really what you wanted to say.
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:08.360]  And I really appreciate, uh, Roseanne, you coming on the show and hopefully we
[2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:11.640]  can have you back up from time to time. I'd love talking to you more and
[2:42:11.640 --> 2:42:15.200]  thanks a lot for having me. Roseanne talking to you. Nice talking to you.
[2:42:15.200 --> 2:42:19.440]  There goes Roseanne Barr. Wow, that was amazing. And coming up in a moment,
[2:42:19.440 --> 2:42:25.040]  we're gonna have free Ricky Ross on with us. Wow. So a listener to the show.
[2:42:25.040 --> 2:42:29.320]  And obviously we agree with a lot of things. She has to say we disagree with
[2:42:29.320 --> 2:42:36.400]  some, but, um, that was satire with, with Max Kaiser, the, the, the reeducation
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:42.920]  camp stuff, the people dressed up and now outfits. Um, I think I figured that
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:48.280]  that was satire. We'll be going into, uh, the fourth hour today with free Ricky
[2:42:48.280 --> 2:42:54.000]  Ross, if he can do it. And, uh, it's fortuitous that Ricky's on right now
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:58.480]  because they're trying to put him back in jail or going around and doing radio
[2:42:58.480 --> 2:43:02.640]  interviews. He's been told don't do radio interviews anymore. Don't be politically
[2:43:02.640 --> 2:43:07.120]  involved. Don't talk about CIA drug dealing. Uh, don't try to put community
[2:43:07.120 --> 2:43:11.600]  organizations together. Uh, or we're going to spin that and put you back in
[2:43:11.600 --> 2:43:16.240]  prison. So he's facing that after decades in prison. He was the biggest
[2:43:16.240 --> 2:43:20.680]  narcotics trafficker in West coast history and Gary Webb's Pulitzer prize
[2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:25.280]  winning piece, dark alliance exposed. It was for the CIA. And of course, Gary
[2:43:25.280 --> 2:43:29.360]  then was planning to come on my show soon. He had his new book coming out and
[2:43:29.360 --> 2:43:32.360]  they shot him twice in the head and killed him. And it was real to suicide.
[2:43:32.880 --> 2:43:38.720]  And now Ricky joins us as a free man for now. And along with documentary
[2:43:38.720 --> 2:43:44.320]  filmmaker, um, showtime, um, film producer of American drug war that I
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:47.760]  consulted on Kevin Booth. And I appreciate Kevin contacted me to let me
[2:43:47.760 --> 2:43:53.080]  know this was going on so we could get Ricky on. Uh, and Ricky, uh, we
[2:43:53.080 --> 2:43:56.560]  appreciate you having the courage to come on this radio show today.
[2:43:56.680 --> 2:43:59.960]  Well, you know, Alex, you give me the courage, uh, when I see people like
[2:43:59.960 --> 2:44:03.920]  you do what you do, it gives me the courage to stand up and do what I
[2:44:03.920 --> 2:44:05.000]  know that I'm supposed to do.
[2:44:06.280 --> 2:44:09.560]  Well, you do have a lot of courage and I'm not going to sit here and judge
[2:44:09.560 --> 2:44:16.160]  you for a man who saw prohibition of narcotics as a way to make hundreds
[2:44:16.160 --> 2:44:19.040]  of millions of dollars as a young person. You've admitted it was wrong
[2:44:19.040 --> 2:44:24.200]  today, but the larger crime is the people that made him illegal to create
[2:44:24.200 --> 2:44:27.400]  the giant black market. Now here you are. All these years later, her older
[2:44:27.400 --> 2:44:31.360]  Rivera goes to Iraq. They admit the troops are growing the opium, giving
[2:44:31.360 --> 2:44:34.320]  them the fertilizer and shipping it out. Now they can't hide it. They just
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:38.800]  admit it. Uh, they now admit Santa Loa cartel on the U S Mexico border ships
[2:44:38.800 --> 2:44:43.160]  in tens of tons a month for five years, totally authorized. And then the
[2:44:43.160 --> 2:44:47.880]  ATF ships them guns goes back before Obama. Uh, they're not getting in
[2:44:47.880 --> 2:44:51.400]  trouble, but we're told you're the bad man and now they're trying to throw
[2:44:51.400 --> 2:44:55.600]  you back in the slammer. Tell us what's happening with you and recap for folks
[2:44:55.600 --> 2:44:58.760]  that don't know who you are. Your story, sir. Well, you know, I grew up in
[2:44:58.760 --> 2:45:04.680]  South Central. Uh, uh, I was illiterate, uh, was trying to do the right thing.
[2:45:04.680 --> 2:45:07.880]  You know, just looking for an opportunity when I was coming up, jobs
[2:45:07.880 --> 2:45:12.720]  were rare. You know, Reagan had cut out all the, uh, the programs that had
[2:45:12.720 --> 2:45:17.760]  once existed in my community that my brother had the privilege of getting. Uh,
[2:45:17.760 --> 2:45:21.160]  so there was no job. So basically what I was doing is just walking around
[2:45:21.160 --> 2:45:23.960]  the neighborhood, looking for an opportunity. And I went to a guy and
[2:45:23.960 --> 2:45:26.640]  it happened. He happened to be a drug dealer and he told me, you know,
[2:45:26.640 --> 2:45:31.280]  what his plan was for me to make money. And I bit into it. And next thing,
[2:45:31.280 --> 2:45:35.720]  you know, I'm making millions and millions of dollars, uh, sometimes
[2:45:35.720 --> 2:45:40.720]  three million dollars in one day. And I mean, I got hooked on it. You know, I
[2:45:40.720 --> 2:45:46.000]  didn't know at the time that the dangers of drugs I had never seen, uh,
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:50.160]  anybody, uh, hooked on crack, you know, that that was the beginning of the
[2:45:50.160 --> 2:45:54.160]  crack era. So, you know, I was, I was, I was pretty naive of what was going
[2:45:54.160 --> 2:45:57.280]  on, but that was before the crack zombies. But just to be clear, I've read
[2:45:57.280 --> 2:46:01.600]  news reports that it was upwards of 40 or 50 million a day. You're talking
[2:46:01.600 --> 2:46:05.600]  about the raw value, but is that incorrect? What I've read in Esquire and
[2:46:05.600 --> 2:46:09.360]  places that you were bringing in 40, 50 million sometimes a day? Well, this is
[2:46:09.360 --> 2:46:13.360]  what, what, what, what I took in. Now, when the people who I sold it to taking
[2:46:13.360 --> 2:46:17.840]  and break it down, you know, it, it, it, it, it accumulates back.
[2:46:19.840 --> 2:46:25.520]  Okay, please continue. Yeah. So, so what happened is, is, is that I just got
[2:46:25.520 --> 2:46:30.320]  involved, you know, 19 years old when I started, uh, basically looking for an
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:34.160]  opportunity. And that was the first opportunity that, that, that I saw that
[2:46:34.160 --> 2:46:39.040]  was valuable for me. And I took that opportunity. Uh, I eventually got
[2:46:39.040 --> 2:46:43.760]  arrested. Uh, the guy that I was getting my drugs from, uh, set me up,
[2:46:43.760 --> 2:46:49.120]  called me for a buy. I go to the buy and it's set up. Uh, I wind up going to
[2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:53.440]  prison. I wind up doing total of 20 years in prison. I had a life sentence. I,
[2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:58.640]  I wasn't supposed to be released out of prison. Uh, but I wind up winning my
[2:46:58.640 --> 2:47:03.440]  appeal. I got released. Not that I'm out. I learned my lesson of, of, of the
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:08.320]  heels of the drug war prohibition. And, uh, while I was in custody, you know,
[2:47:08.320 --> 2:47:12.880]  we going to try out a guy who introduced me to drugs, testified against me.
[2:47:14.240 --> 2:47:18.720]  And then we found out that he was working for not only the DEA, but also
[2:47:18.720 --> 2:47:25.120]  the CIA. So he basically didn't do any time in jail. He, he got caught, uh,
[2:47:25.120 --> 2:47:30.000]  with I think 10 tons of cocaine or something like that there. I'm not
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:34.400]  sure the exact numbers, but, uh, uh, much, much larger than, than, than, than
[2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:38.480]  my because he sold not only to me, but other guys and other parts of the
[2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:43.760]  country as well. So when Gary broke the story and I found out everything that
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:47.200]  was going on and then later on the CIA admits that they knew these guys were
[2:47:47.200 --> 2:47:51.920]  selling drugs, but they didn't authorize it. Uh, I'm like, wow, you know, uh,
[2:47:51.920 --> 2:47:56.160]  Rick, maybe you have been due because I thought I was a rebel. You know, uh, I
[2:47:56.160 --> 2:47:59.600]  thought that I was going against the government because I felt that the
[2:47:59.600 --> 2:48:03.440]  government had been holding me from other good things in life that they
[2:48:03.440 --> 2:48:06.880]  would let me enjoy. So I said, well, maybe this is just one of the things that
[2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:11.280]  they're trying to keep away from. Well, after I went to jail and I say, you
[2:48:11.280 --> 2:48:14.960]  know what, man, you got to change the thinking. There's so many young black
[2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:20.720]  guys up in here, uh, the guy caught up in this, uh, uh, crack epidemic that, you
[2:48:20.720 --> 2:48:24.320]  know, you got to stop it. You know, you, you influence these guys that sell
[2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:27.440]  drugs. So now you got to influence. And for those that don't know the whole
[2:48:27.440 --> 2:48:30.960]  story, you've now been out while you were in, but now while you're out
[2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:34.480]  preaching against drug use and things like that saying, it's not cool. And now
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:38.000]  they're wanting to throw you back in jail. I guess they don't like you
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:41.920]  cutting in on their profits. Well, you know, that's what that's what that's
[2:48:41.920 --> 2:48:45.600]  what it looks like. Uh, uh, uh, these people, I mean, you know, they don't
[2:48:45.600 --> 2:48:49.280]  want me talking to kids. One of the things that I'm going, uh, to court this
[2:48:49.280 --> 2:48:53.360]  week is they sent us a message that I'm preaching is, is, is the wrong message
[2:48:53.360 --> 2:48:57.680]  that, uh, that I'm encouraging kids to sell drugs when I tell them, you know,
[2:48:57.680 --> 2:49:00.480]  you sell drugs, you're going to do 20 years in prison and you may get a life
[2:49:00.480 --> 2:49:03.520]  sentence. They said it. That's the wrong message. They don't want that, that
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:08.560]  message out. So, uh, this is his way of silencing me. Uh, that's how they spin
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:11.920]  it. They say you're telling kids it's horrible. Don't do it. You're killing
[2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:15.520]  your people, uh, because I've seen the videos online. Don't ever use them.
[2:49:15.520 --> 2:49:20.480]  Stay away from it. Believe it from me. Drug dealers aren't, aren't, shouldn't
[2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:24.240]  be your icons. The government's saying that teaches them to use drugs.
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:27.920]  Don't do it. No, they want those little black kids and others in there. They
[2:49:27.920 --> 2:49:31.600]  want them on the crack. They want them using that globalist drugs that they're
[2:49:31.600 --> 2:49:35.280]  shipping in. And, uh, so you've got a lot of courage. You could cower to them. I
[2:49:35.280 --> 2:49:38.320]  know cause I've talked to you, uh, and I've talked to Kevin about this. You
[2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:41.760]  could cower, shut up and they leave you alone, but instead you're coming out
[2:49:41.760 --> 2:49:46.160]  and telling folks what they're doing to you. Absolutely. Uh, I think what you,
[2:49:46.160 --> 2:49:48.640]  you know, I mean, you know, when I was in prison, you tried to come down here and
[2:49:48.640 --> 2:49:51.840]  talk to me when I was in prison. They wouldn't allow that. Yes. And, and, you
[2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:55.840]  know, when I see guys like you, who this doesn't even affect you per se, you
[2:49:55.840 --> 2:49:58.720]  know, but you're sticking your neck out. I'm saying, well, you know what, if he
[2:49:58.720 --> 2:50:02.080]  can stick his neck out for me, then I got to stick my neck out for the rest of
[2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:05.440]  these kids. But you know, Alex, now they don't arrest these guys who get on the
[2:50:05.440 --> 2:50:09.440]  radio and rap to the kids who never sold drugs and tell them that they should be
[2:50:09.440 --> 2:50:15.360]  selling drugs, that selling drugs is wonderful. Uh, Universal puts out, uh, I
[2:50:15.360 --> 2:50:19.120]  don't know how many records every day and it's on the radio over and over again,
[2:50:19.120 --> 2:50:22.480]  these kids selling them, telling these kids how much money they're making, selling
[2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:25.760]  drugs and how wonderful the drug business is. And they got this far and they got
[2:50:25.760 --> 2:50:29.440]  this many girls and, and they make the drug dealers. I mean, the drug life seems
[2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:33.760]  so wonderful. So when I go out and I tell them that this guy is lying, this guy
[2:50:33.760 --> 2:50:38.080]  never sold drugs. This guy's only telling you this to make you buy his records
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:40.800]  and, and to follow in his footsteps. And he don't care if you go out and sell
[2:50:40.800 --> 2:50:44.320]  drugs and buy his records and buy his clothes and, and buy the things you're
[2:50:44.320 --> 2:50:47.200]  going to go to prison. He's never going to go to prison. If he was a real drug
[2:50:47.200 --> 2:50:50.240]  dealer, he couldn't say that because they would lock him up just like they would
[2:50:50.240 --> 2:50:55.520]  do me. Well, that's powerful. So you are speaking out against drugs and they're
[2:50:55.520 --> 2:51:01.760]  like kids all over America listen to Ricky rush. They're not using our products.

[2:54:12.640 --> 2:54:17.840]  We've got the article linked in red along with the video at infoawards.com
[2:54:17.840 --> 2:54:21.200]  in the featured news section. Targeting the real enemy, occupy the
[2:54:21.200 --> 2:54:23.920]  Federal Reserve. Instead of just demonizing capitalism
[2:54:23.920 --> 2:54:27.600]  and all of Wall Street, I'm going to go up to the Fed this Friday,
[2:54:27.600 --> 2:54:30.800]  six o'clock, and I'm calling on folks to stay there for weeks of need-be,
[2:54:30.800 --> 2:54:34.320]  rotating in and out to get massive media attention on the private Federal
[2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:37.840]  Reserve. Please get that press release and video out to all activists.
[2:54:37.840 --> 2:54:42.560]  We need your help, folks. This is key. We're doing all over the country as well.
[2:54:42.560 --> 2:54:47.200]  Now, Ricky Ross, Frio Ricky Ross, of course, you know, one of the icons,
[2:54:47.200 --> 2:54:51.840]  you know, out there of East Coast drug dealing and his case helped expose
[2:54:51.840 --> 2:54:58.400]  the CIA West Coast and the whole CIA crack cocaine
[2:54:58.400 --> 2:55:04.000]  epidemic, the congressional hearings, all of it. And freewayrick.com is one of
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:06.480]  his sites where you can find out how to write the judge,
[2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:09.360]  where you can let them know that there's media attention on this. But
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:14.240]  what powerful information he's talking about that this is what Prodigy Mobb
[2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:17.680]  Deep and others have talked about. This is what KRS-1 has talked about,
[2:55:17.680 --> 2:55:20.960]  has been on the show. When you promote a culture of gang fighting and
[2:55:20.960 --> 2:55:25.920]  drug dealing, MTV puts you on. But when you speak out against that,
[2:55:25.920 --> 2:55:30.240]  even if you're an icon, they try to shut you up. Now, here's Frio Ricky Ross
[2:55:30.240 --> 2:55:33.280]  coming out with street cred and speaking out against this, and they're trying to
[2:55:33.280 --> 2:55:37.280]  throw him back in jail. What can we do to keep you out of jail, sir?
[2:55:37.280 --> 2:55:41.360]  Well, I would say if people would contact the judge, if they heard about the
[2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:44.800]  things that I've been doing on the street, I got quite a few letters from the
[2:55:44.800 --> 2:55:48.880]  school. The kids are telling me that my speak with them was
[2:55:48.880 --> 2:55:54.640]  eye-opening and heartfelt, and now they're redirecting their lives.
[2:55:54.640 --> 2:55:58.080]  So when people say that, that they're refocusing,
[2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:02.160]  they're looking at life different, and that's just a wonderful thing to
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:04.080]  happen. But right now, the best thing that we
[2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:08.240]  could do is contact the judge. Hopefully, I've been out of jail almost
[2:56:08.240 --> 2:56:12.400]  three years now and haven't committed crime. I've been going
[2:56:12.400 --> 2:56:16.080]  speaking for police officers. They have a few police officers in LA
[2:56:16.080 --> 2:56:18.880]  that have a different way of looking at it now, that they're not looking at
[2:56:18.880 --> 2:56:22.880]  incarceration the way that they used to, and they say that it hasn't been working.
[2:56:22.880 --> 2:56:26.400]  So they invite me down to speak at some of their seminars and whatnot.
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:30.560]  So, you know, I've really been, you know, Alex just educating people
[2:56:30.560 --> 2:56:34.560]  and really just talking out against this system. And that's why they want to put
[2:56:34.560 --> 2:56:36.800]  you back in jail. What are you facing? Six months?
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:40.640]  Yes, six months. I mean, and don't get me wrong, six months is no time for me.
[2:56:40.640 --> 2:56:44.400]  I did 20 years. I did six months in the hope.
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:48.720]  So, you know, when they say six months in jail, it's not a whole lot of time,
[2:56:48.720 --> 2:56:52.800]  but I feel that this time that's going to be wasted.
[2:56:52.800 --> 2:56:55.600]  Yeah, but you know they're going to nickel and dime you again. They could do
[2:56:55.600 --> 2:57:00.160]  something to you in there. They can keep throwing you back in there
[2:57:00.160 --> 2:57:03.760]  over and over again. And listen, I want to talk about this,
[2:57:03.760 --> 2:57:06.080]  fast and furious. I don't know if you've seen this, but it's been in the old
[2:57:06.080 --> 2:57:09.360]  Paso Times, Chicago Tribune, and a few other papers
[2:57:09.360 --> 2:57:11.840]  that in the court documents, the government's coming in and said, yeah,
[2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:16.000]  it's true. The Sinaloa drughead of U.S. operations,
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:19.840]  when he got grabbed by the Mexicans and extradited, the U.S.
[2:57:19.840 --> 2:57:23.200]  is admitting, okay, he did work for us. We did give him guns,
[2:57:23.200 --> 2:57:26.240]  and he is allowed to ship cocaine in by the time.
[2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:30.320]  I mean, they're constantly being caught. The Marines are ordered to grow the
[2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:33.280]  opium in Afghanistan along with the army, and then
[2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:37.920]  they got to put you back in jail when you dealt drugs for the CIA.
[2:57:37.920 --> 2:57:41.600]  Yeah, that's the size of it. That's absolutely the size of it.
[2:57:41.600 --> 2:57:44.720]  And like you said, I think that they're more interested in putting me back
[2:57:44.720 --> 2:57:47.440]  because they don't want people to see what I see now
[2:57:47.440 --> 2:57:51.200]  and to see things from my eyesight. Well, it was Kevin Booth really
[2:57:51.200 --> 2:57:53.680]  worked to help get you out as well. We're going to break her in a moment, but
[2:57:53.680 --> 2:57:57.120]  just in a minute, Kevin, what do you make of this?
[2:57:57.120 --> 2:58:01.200]  Just business as usual. People have a way to make a living. I mean, I'm working on
[2:58:01.200 --> 2:58:04.320]  a sequel to American Drug War right now where, you know, I'm not going to name names
[2:58:04.320 --> 2:58:08.000]  or get into it, but I've got to, you know, people that were
[2:58:08.000 --> 2:58:11.760]  actually caught shipping drugs in for cartels,
[2:58:11.760 --> 2:58:15.440]  and when they got caught by the U.S. government, got put into shipping
[2:58:15.440 --> 2:58:19.520]  the same drugs for the same cartels, but then the Border Patrol agents would
[2:58:19.520 --> 2:58:23.840]  bring it across the border. Yeah, they had Border Patrol agents 100
[2:58:23.840 --> 2:58:26.720]  miles in trying to search my vehicle this weekend, and I said,
[2:58:26.720 --> 2:58:31.200]  look, you're drug dealers on video. It's up on the web. I said, you guys
[2:58:31.200 --> 2:58:34.720]  deal the drugs. I'm not cutting in on your business.
[2:58:34.720 --> 2:58:37.840]  I'm not a cowboy. They just smiled and said, you can go.
[2:58:37.840 --> 2:58:41.200]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:58:43.200 --> 2:58:50.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.

[3:00:02.240 --> 3:00:20.720]  Trio Ricky Ross is our guest. FreewayEnterprise.com is the site.
[3:00:20.720 --> 3:00:23.920]  FreewayEnterprise.com to send letters to the judge and say,
[3:00:23.920 --> 3:00:27.200]  hey, this guy, you can go watch the YouTube videos the last three years.
[3:00:27.200 --> 3:00:30.560]  Speak into kids and don't use drugs. It's not cool.
[3:00:30.560 --> 3:00:33.280]  But he's also talking about government drug dealing and things. They have the
[3:00:33.280 --> 3:00:37.440]  big VH1 highly rated special Planet Rock that he's the centerpiece of and they
[3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:41.280]  admit it's the biggest false incarceration ever to cover up CIA drug
[3:00:41.280 --> 3:00:43.520]  dealing. That's why they want to put him back in
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:46.720]  jail because he's really starting to get attention.
[3:00:46.720 --> 3:00:50.640]  There's all sorts of movie deals going on. They don't want his story
[3:00:50.640 --> 3:00:55.280]  getting out there right now. That's why they're doing this.
[3:00:55.280 --> 3:00:58.640]  Kevin Booth, you were just bringing up that VH1 special
[3:00:58.640 --> 3:01:01.360]  during the break. Give us your take on why they want to throw Ricky
[3:01:01.360 --> 3:01:05.520]  back behind bars. Well, like you said, I mean, he's just
[3:01:05.520 --> 3:01:09.360]  people are starting to accept them as a legitimate voice. You know, I mean, you
[3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:13.760]  had all these rappers out there saying all these things for years on both sides
[3:01:13.760 --> 3:01:17.200]  that is both glamorous and non-glamorous and then you've got the other
[3:01:17.200 --> 3:01:19.760]  rapper. Well, I'm not going to mention his name,
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:24.240]  but it sounds familiar. It sounds a lot like Ricky Ross's name
[3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:28.960]  that has been putting out platinum records getting all this attention and
[3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:33.520]  now Ricky just kind of comes out of nowhere and he's building this huge
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:36.480]  legitimate following and people are starting to take him serious and he's
[3:01:36.480 --> 3:01:39.520]  not. He doesn't really have like a pony in the
[3:01:39.520 --> 3:01:43.040]  race per se like all these other guys do. He's just
[3:01:43.040 --> 3:01:46.960]  kind of telling it how it was. When you got a bunch of pretenders and then the
[3:01:46.960 --> 3:01:51.120]  real guy shows up, it's like Ulysses shows up after 20 years being
[3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:56.960]  gone and everybody's taking over his house in his name.
[3:01:56.960 --> 3:02:00.800]  Yeah, that's exactly what happened and you know, I've been fighting hard
[3:02:00.800 --> 3:02:03.920]  to get that back because I'm like, you know, how can you write these, who's
[3:02:03.920 --> 3:02:06.720]  writing these songs for you? You know, where are you getting these
[3:02:06.720 --> 3:02:10.080]  stories from? You know, and you was a correctional officer.
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:13.120]  You worked for the government and you know they're not going to let me work
[3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:17.040]  for the government with my record, with my history, how they think about me. So
[3:02:17.040 --> 3:02:20.160]  if they let a guy who comes in and he's worked for the government, you already
[3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:23.280]  know that they checked him out thoroughly and they know exactly what he's done
[3:02:23.280 --> 3:02:27.840]  and what he's not going to do. Kevin? I think it's interesting that
[3:02:27.840 --> 3:02:31.200]  one of the reasons that Ricky's getting in trouble right now,
[3:02:31.200 --> 3:02:33.680]  they're trying to claim is because Ricky's out there actually
[3:02:33.680 --> 3:02:37.920]  working for free and that they can't accept the fact that
[3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:41.120]  you know, he's like traveling around doing all this stuff and not making
[3:02:41.120 --> 3:02:44.160]  any money for it and that's one of the like, isn't that one of the angles that
[3:02:44.160 --> 3:02:46.960]  they're using? They're wondering how am I able to travel
[3:02:46.960 --> 3:02:50.720]  and what happened? A guy saw what I was doing and he works for the airline, he
[3:02:50.720 --> 3:02:54.320]  just told me he put me on his buddy pass. So you know, some days I have to sleep
[3:02:54.320 --> 3:02:57.680]  in the airport for two days, you know, to counter airplane when
[3:02:57.680 --> 3:03:01.440]  a seat opens up, but you know, for the kids and to get my message out,
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:05.040]  you know, I'll do that and he can't understand. Well, Ricky, you know, that's
[3:03:05.040 --> 3:03:08.080]  ridiculous. Instead of everybody letting them, you know, take your name and
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:11.760]  claim big deals and all this, you should just put out a basic
[3:03:11.760 --> 3:03:16.080]  DVD with images talking about your history and have some, you know, somebody
[3:03:16.080 --> 3:03:19.200]  shell it and I guarantee you, you'd make enough money to live comfortably and be
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:22.080]  able to travel around and get your message out that way instead of
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:27.120]  sleeping in airports. This is ridiculous. Yeah, it has been tough, Alex, but
[3:03:27.120 --> 3:03:30.880]  you know, I'm committed to doing this, you know, when I was in prison, when we
[3:03:30.880 --> 3:03:34.800]  talked, when I was in prison, I told you that what I wanted to do and that I was
[3:03:34.800 --> 3:03:38.160]  going to fight against this drug war and with the message that they're
[3:03:38.160 --> 3:03:41.280]  preaching, you know, on our records and through our
[3:03:41.280 --> 3:03:44.640]  airwaves, because I believe that they're brainwashing our kids, you know, they're
[3:03:44.640 --> 3:03:47.600]  brainwashing our kids into believing that if you're not a drug dealer,
[3:03:47.600 --> 3:03:51.200]  that you're nothing, you're not important and I think that that's wrong. The
[3:03:51.200 --> 3:03:54.400]  teacher kid, the way he's appealing, he's willing to die for it, you know,
[3:03:54.400 --> 3:03:57.680]  Alex, when I was coming up, I was willing to die for this drug stuff
[3:03:57.680 --> 3:04:00.720]  and right now they're teaching our kids that if you don't have this, you're
[3:04:00.720 --> 3:04:03.680]  nothing, you're not, you're not important, so you might as well be dead.
[3:04:03.680 --> 3:04:07.440]  Wow. I mean, it's interesting, it's interesting if you look at the
[3:04:07.440 --> 3:04:10.640]  cartels that I've studied, how much about the cartels you've studied,
[3:04:10.640 --> 3:04:13.840]  that these guys actually build mausoleums for themselves over there with
[3:04:13.840 --> 3:04:18.000]  air conditioning and they, it's actually become a culture over there in
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:23.440]  Mexico where they worship these guys that die at the age of 21
[3:04:23.440 --> 3:04:26.560]  and it's all just celebrating like how much money they made and how quick they
[3:04:26.560 --> 3:04:28.880]  made it and of course all the kids want to be like these guys,
[3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:32.160]  what else, how can you blame them? Well, they've got a lot of Tejano singers
[3:04:32.160 --> 3:04:37.520]  pumping it up and making it sexy and cool and that's all the CIA on record,
[3:04:37.520 --> 3:04:41.120]  making it glamorous, making it cool, down in Mexico now they're worshiping the
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:45.680]  skinny one, the Grim Reaper and look, 40,000 dead in three years.
[3:04:45.680 --> 3:04:48.880]  I mean, this is worse than Vietnam per year. Ricky, I want to come back
[3:04:48.880 --> 3:04:52.480]  with you and Kevin and get back into this brainwashing the kids to use the drugs,
[3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:54.880]  you're exposing it, they want to throw you back in jail.
[3:04:54.880 --> 3:04:59.360]  This is a massive travesty, you also got to watch your back like Gary Webb,

[3:06:09.840 --> 3:06:13.360]  forming and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right

[3:08:13.680 --> 3:08:18.720]  Extremism and defense of liberty is no vice.

[3:08:24.720 --> 3:08:28.000]  callers. We'll be back Lord willing tomorrow
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:31.840]  live and then I'm going to be broadcasting from the Federal Reserve.
[3:08:31.840 --> 3:08:35.680]  I'm going to go ahead and go up to Dallas Thursday night up there at the Dallas Fed
[3:08:35.680 --> 3:08:39.440]  then I'm going to move on Saturday and Sunday to other Federal Reserve
[3:08:39.440 --> 3:08:43.440]  compounds around the state of Texas but I'm calling on people all over
[3:08:43.440 --> 3:08:47.760]  this area to converge and camp out at the Federal Reserve
[3:08:47.760 --> 3:08:51.520]  in and around on the sidewalks. If you're angry about what's happening I
[3:08:51.520 --> 3:08:55.440]  want to draw attention to the actual money laundering megabanks the big six
[3:08:55.440 --> 3:08:58.400]  Federal Reserve shareholders who've all been caught laundering drug money over
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:02.080]  and over again and taking houses that they didn't even have a deed to and that
[3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:06.480]  weren't delinquent in payments. So let's come out with Bank of America
[3:09:06.480 --> 3:09:09.760]  and the week after that I'm going to go and demonstrate at Bank of America you
[3:09:09.760 --> 3:09:12.960]  name it because they've been caught right handed over and over again and not
[3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:16.160]  gotten in trouble. It's time to not just let the left have
[3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:20.560]  a bunch of controlled you know people protesting capitalism
[3:09:20.560 --> 3:09:24.640]  and I know most of Occupy Wall Street aren't doing that.
[3:09:24.640 --> 3:09:30.880]  My point is we are going to go directly after the real issue. Speaking of
[3:09:30.880 --> 3:09:34.560]  getting this country back Ron Paul came in third in fundraising
[3:09:34.560 --> 3:09:40.000]  eight million dollars Rick Perry raised 15 million dollars but
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  he's got a really bad history and the more we expose him the more he'll fall
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:48.000]  in the polls but again you can go to info wars.com and drugsreport.com
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:50.720]  and other sites Paul holds in eight million
[3:09:50.720 --> 3:09:56.080]  Rick Perry holds in I'm sorry 17 million so there you have it Ron Paul of
[3:09:56.080 --> 3:09:58.480]  course on average had less than 50 dollar donations
[3:09:58.480 --> 3:10:02.160]  Perry on average had three thousand dollar donations the maximum amount
[3:10:02.160 --> 3:10:06.080]  it's just truly disgusting we've got to do something about that guy and
[3:10:06.080 --> 3:10:11.280]  Herman Cain's just as bad folks total globalist talks a good game but work
[3:10:11.280 --> 3:10:14.960]  for the Federal Reserve that's all coming up and I'll be back of course
[3:10:14.960 --> 3:10:19.280]  tonight seven o'clock with info wars at nightly news at prisonplanet.tv
[3:10:19.280 --> 3:10:23.120]  we got G. Edward Griffin on tonight G. Edward Griffin on
[3:10:23.120 --> 3:10:26.480]  tonight with us and then we're going to do an extended interview and air the rest
[3:10:26.480 --> 3:10:30.240]  of it Friday on the nightly news so G. Edward Griffin coming up tonight
[3:10:30.240 --> 3:10:33.360]  prisonplanet.tv seven o'clock now going back here
[3:10:33.360 --> 3:10:36.240]  I'm gonna try to shut up here for the last 10 minutes and this is so important
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:38.720]  get Ricky on as soon as we can after this because
[3:10:38.720 --> 3:10:42.080]  I don't want him to get sent off to the Husqow again
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:45.520]  because his testimony is so important and he's had courage
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:50.480]  you were getting sir into the fact that in your own record I've seen the videos
[3:10:50.480 --> 3:10:53.760]  criticizing the rappers promoting the drug culture
[3:10:53.760 --> 3:10:56.880]  and you're clearly saying this is brainwashing selling it as cool
[3:10:56.880 --> 3:11:00.320]  you're telling the kids it isn't cool and they're trying to
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:04.160]  and you've got the letters there on your site they're trying to put you back in
[3:11:04.160 --> 3:11:07.280]  jail saying you're promoting a culture of drugs
[3:11:07.280 --> 3:11:11.760]  by saying in the drug war which puts the money
[3:11:11.760 --> 3:11:15.600]  into it which pushes the culture of drugs they're saying because you want to
[3:11:15.600 --> 3:11:18.640]  end prohibition that you're a drug pusher again
[3:11:18.640 --> 3:11:21.920]  and then let's expand on them not letting you on with John Stossel
[3:11:21.920 --> 3:11:26.480]  well uh uh John Stossel had contacted me about he heard me speaking on a
[3:11:26.480 --> 3:11:30.400]  mpr I think it was radio and when I was on there I talked about
[3:11:30.400 --> 3:11:34.800]  how if they take one drug dealer off the street
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:38.640]  that the man is still there so what winds up happening is from that one who
[3:11:38.640 --> 3:11:43.760]  controlled that area now 10 guys want to take over that area
[3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:46.880]  so now these guys are all starting to grow
[3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:51.200]  and become as big as this one guy was so instead of having one guy that was
[3:11:51.200 --> 3:11:53.760]  controlling everything now you got 10 guys that's fighting over this
[3:11:53.760 --> 3:11:57.760]  this particular area and and it don't matter how many of these guys you take
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:00.800]  off the streets somebody's going to come in and want to
[3:12:00.800 --> 3:12:05.040]  take that position so I was telling them that that is just like repetitive
[3:12:05.040 --> 3:12:08.000]  and then even when you take this guy off the street
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:14.160]  not only that but the price goes up you know uh uh uh when the price goes up
[3:12:14.160 --> 3:12:18.400]  then that makes people who otherwise wouldn't get involved and you know what
[3:12:18.400 --> 3:12:23.440]  a hundred thousand dollars I'm interested or also it causes more of the
[3:12:23.440 --> 3:12:26.640]  addicts to break in and rob liquor stores and
[3:12:26.640 --> 3:12:31.120]  do all and steal copper to be able to buy the more expensive product exactly
[3:12:31.120 --> 3:12:36.880]  so all by by prohibition and and I really believe that this is something
[3:12:36.880 --> 3:12:40.240]  because I'm also working on a movie right now with a drug addict
[3:12:40.240 --> 3:12:44.560]  you know I spoke at one of these drug houses a couple months back
[3:12:44.560 --> 3:12:48.640]  and when I did one of the drug addicts came up and she started telling me about
[3:12:48.640 --> 3:12:52.960]  her story and it just reminded me of when I used to be selling and I was
[3:12:52.960 --> 3:12:56.400]  inside of these houses where they used all the time and it hit me and was so
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:13:00.400]  profound I said you know what nobody has told the story from the drug addicts
[3:13:00.400 --> 3:13:03.920]  point of view and she said I never want to be a drug addict I wanted all the
[3:13:03.920 --> 3:13:07.680]  money that the drug dealers was making but the only thing I tried my product
[3:13:07.680 --> 3:13:11.920]  and got hooked so uh when you look at all that the money
[3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:15.680]  and prohibition is definitely one of the main attractions and you're speaking
[3:13:15.680 --> 3:13:19.360]  out to get rid of the prohibition that would end all this overnight so they
[3:13:19.360 --> 3:13:22.240]  want to throw you back in jail because they're all part of the same system
[3:13:22.240 --> 3:13:26.960]  Kevin well I was gonna say I think it's very interesting to note that you know
[3:13:26.960 --> 3:13:31.120]  back during the days of Pablo Escobar I think which went up to like 93 94 something
[3:13:31.120 --> 3:13:36.640]  like that I'm not sure um that as bad as it was he kind of had like this whole
[3:13:36.640 --> 3:13:40.400]  system like under control and it's kind of interesting to note that as soon as
[3:13:40.400 --> 3:13:44.640]  they killed him that gave birth to this huge onslaught of the Mexican
[3:13:44.640 --> 3:13:47.840]  cartels so it's like the same old thing like Ricky was just saying you
[3:13:47.840 --> 3:13:50.800]  you know you cut off a head and 10 more heads grow well
[3:13:50.800 --> 3:13:54.480]  you know now the the business has been taken out of the
[3:13:54.480 --> 3:13:58.000]  even the Colombian pan or only the Colombians now just all they're allowed
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:03.040]  to do is just manufacture it and now Rick Perry says send US troops to
[3:14:03.040 --> 3:14:06.400]  Mexico to fight with the Mexican army the Mexican
[3:14:06.400 --> 3:14:09.920]  army are the biggest drug dealers they're fighting with the other cartels
[3:14:09.920 --> 3:14:14.080]  this is an unwinnable war because you have poverty and people that can make
[3:14:14.080 --> 3:14:17.520]  billions of dollars off of this and they've got a culture of death being
[3:14:17.520 --> 3:14:21.120]  sexy this isn't going to end and I think the globalists have
[3:14:21.120 --> 3:14:25.200]  pushed this drug war so far it's now going to consume them
[3:14:25.200 --> 3:14:28.880]  and we're hearing more and more voices in government including conservatives
[3:14:28.880 --> 3:14:33.280]  saying decriminalize now yeah no it's turned into a
[3:14:33.280 --> 3:14:37.920]  turf war I mean at first it was just the the money fueling their ability to sell
[3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:41.360]  cocaine but now it's the it's the all the money they make
[3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:44.080]  from selling cocaine like fueling their turf war
[3:14:44.080 --> 3:14:47.920]  and it's obvious that you know certain cartels such as the uh you know the
[3:14:47.920 --> 3:14:50.720]  goosebumps delchapa or however you pronounce that
[3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:54.400]  is uh totally either becoming one with the government
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:57.600]  and you know what too Alex you cannot declare war
[3:14:57.600 --> 3:15:01.840]  on drugs but this war is a war on the people plain and simple
[3:15:01.840 --> 3:15:05.840]  there's no way you can fight cocaine how can you fight cocaine when it doesn't
[3:15:05.840 --> 3:15:09.120]  even have any power cocaine is powerless it's only the only
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:11.440]  power that cocaine has is what the people give it
[3:15:11.440 --> 3:15:15.680]  we make it valuable uh when you look at a coca leaf what is the coca leaf it's
[3:15:15.680 --> 3:15:18.880]  no more valuable than the grass that grow out in our yard
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:22.800]  but it's the value that we put on it when we make it valuable valuable
[3:15:22.800 --> 3:15:28.240]  then that's when everything gets crazy I yeah I just think that we need to start
[3:15:28.240 --> 3:15:32.000]  examining like what like an end to prohibition could really look like
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:34.720]  because you always get the same thing you know people are like oh so you're
[3:15:34.720 --> 3:15:37.920]  saying that you should be able to buy crystal meth at a 7-11 and all this
[3:15:37.920 --> 3:15:41.680]  I mean so I mean I think people on our side need to start coming up with like
[3:15:41.680 --> 3:15:45.760]  a real definition well no I mean it's what Ron Paul says
[3:15:45.760 --> 3:15:50.080]  uh you I mean you regulate it and it's seen as a disease and Europe's done it
[3:15:50.080 --> 3:15:53.600]  in most areas and uh the use goes way down so
[3:15:53.600 --> 3:15:57.440]  them claiming Ron Paul wants two-year-olds to inject stuff I can
[3:15:57.440 --> 3:16:01.200]  I can buy methamphetamine behind a 7-11 here in town
[3:16:01.200 --> 3:16:05.200]  so so I mean I can drive down to east 11 to buy crack cocaine right now if I
[3:16:05.200 --> 3:16:08.560]  want to it's wide open I mean they stand out
[3:16:08.560 --> 3:16:12.240]  on the street with it all day long yeah it's it's it's ridiculous
[3:16:12.240 --> 3:16:14.880]  I mean I've driven through certain areas of town going to different community
[3:16:14.880 --> 3:16:17.920]  events and stuff and have the crack dealers run up hey let me give it to
[3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:21.280]  you and there's cop cars driving right by they're not doing anything
[3:16:21.280 --> 3:16:24.800]  about it now I want to expand on this Kevin you got
[3:16:24.800 --> 3:16:28.560]  cut off by a break earlier you were bringing up this is actually come out
[3:16:28.560 --> 3:16:31.760]  that you know people would get busted bringing drugs in and the government
[3:16:31.760 --> 3:16:34.720]  would say we're going to let you go but now you're going to deliver it through
[3:16:34.720 --> 3:16:38.320]  this border patrol agent and I'm not our border patrol has got a lot of good
[3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:41.600]  men and women in it but let's be honest a lot of them especially the
[3:16:41.600 --> 3:16:44.320]  supervisors they're some of the biggest drug dealers in this
[3:16:44.320 --> 3:16:47.520]  country and it's come out the Senola is allowed to ship right through those
[3:16:47.520 --> 3:16:51.120]  border checkpoints they've got them a hundred miles into the state
[3:16:51.120 --> 3:16:55.600]  and they flag them and let them come through and I will not let
[3:16:55.600 --> 3:16:59.040]  uh the border patrol known for drug dealing search my car looking for their
[3:16:59.040 --> 3:17:01.520]  products I'm sorry yeah well you know I've been
[3:17:01.520 --> 3:17:06.000]  here with a border patrol agent that that flag and
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:09.600]  somehow they they uh didn't go along with the system and they throw them in
[3:17:09.600 --> 3:17:13.600]  there with us so absolutely uh I've seen that
[3:17:13.600 --> 3:17:17.360]  firsthand Kevin tell us about your sources yeah no I mean
[3:17:17.360 --> 3:17:20.240]  well I'm gonna protect my sources right now because I'm working I don't mean
[3:17:20.240 --> 3:17:24.080]  tell us who they are I mean tell us the information well the yeah I mean the
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:26.880]  guy this guy was like flying shipments for a
[3:17:26.880 --> 3:17:31.520]  cartel uh he was landing you know on on the American side of the
[3:17:31.520 --> 3:17:34.800]  border he got caught he got turned into an informant
[3:17:34.800 --> 3:17:39.360]  and the only thing that changed was where they wanted him to land
[3:17:39.360 --> 3:17:43.280]  having him land up right here that's all that things
[3:17:43.280 --> 3:17:46.160]  and then they took it from there and that was it and that's how he stayed out of
[3:17:46.160 --> 3:17:50.640]  prison wow it's unbelievable Kevin well
[3:17:50.640 --> 3:17:55.040]  you've done so much great work um yeah I appreciate you too Kevin uh
[3:17:55.040 --> 3:17:58.720]  with all the work you've done for me uh when I was in prison and the things
[3:17:58.720 --> 3:18:01.360]  that you've been doing for me since I've been out because you really
[3:18:01.360 --> 3:18:05.520]  you know Kevin has helped me get a job and and you know things that a lot of
[3:18:05.520 --> 3:18:09.280]  other guys just getting out of prison didn't have uh uh and I really
[3:18:09.280 --> 3:18:11.680]  appreciate that and in your two addicts you guys have
[3:18:11.680 --> 3:18:14.640]  really uh supported me you know uh when I got out of
[3:18:14.640 --> 3:18:17.680]  prison I remember you asked me on the air uh without thinking about committing
[3:18:17.680 --> 3:18:20.800]  suicide or did I have any suicidal tendency
[3:18:20.800 --> 3:18:24.000]  so uh just those things that you guys have done for me have really been
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:27.680]  helpful and I still don't plan on committing suicide Alex I still love
[3:18:27.680 --> 3:18:30.320]  life if I had to go back and do six months
[3:18:30.320 --> 3:18:35.280]  absolutely will not kill me okay well that's important to say
[3:18:35.280 --> 3:18:40.480]  absolutely I'm gonna study and when I come out
[3:18:40.480 --> 3:18:44.560]  I'm gonna get right back on the same plan wonderful Ricky what were you saying
[3:18:44.560 --> 3:18:47.040]  Kevin I was gonna say and and and the difference
[3:18:47.040 --> 3:18:50.320]  between Ricky and the rest of them is that Ricky never got high off his own
[3:18:50.320 --> 3:18:54.960]  supply absolutely now now let's drink alcohol and I
[3:18:54.960 --> 3:18:59.120]  don't smoke cigarette even now I've seen the videos of you out there giving
[3:18:59.120 --> 3:19:02.560]  speeches you look super super fit for your age
[3:19:02.560 --> 3:19:07.680]  look look uh in closing here people need to stop this travesty of justice
[3:19:07.680 --> 3:19:11.840]  you're out there telling kids not to use drugs but you're also saying in this
[3:19:11.840 --> 3:19:14.560]  failed drug war it's been great for the banks making the money but it's been a
[3:19:14.560 --> 3:19:17.120]  failure for us the people it is a war on our
[3:19:17.120 --> 3:19:20.720]  liberties they put it out there then when we pick it up they put us in jail
[3:19:20.720 --> 3:19:22.960]  for it it'd be like if they said if you have a
[3:19:22.960 --> 3:19:26.400]  gray rock in your pocket you go to prison and then then the government
[3:19:26.400 --> 3:19:29.920]  comes and dumps dump trucks of gray rocks in front of schools
[3:19:29.920 --> 3:19:33.680]  I mean you know that's the big criminal activity so folks need to go to
[3:19:33.680 --> 3:19:38.000]  freewayenterprise.com or freewayrick.com
