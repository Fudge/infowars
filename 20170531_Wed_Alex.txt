[00:00.000 --> 00:24.480]  Well, there are those moments in history when people do jump the shark at the perfect tipping
[00:24.480 --> 00:25.480]  point.
[00:25.480 --> 00:27.840]  America and the world was sick of all the attacks on Trump.
[00:27.840 --> 00:31.000]  They were seeing through them, I was telling people just last week that we'd reached the
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.360]  tipping point, and then Kathy Griffin comes out like an ISIS sympathizer and basically
[00:36.360 --> 00:41.560]  promotes chopping the president's head off, and the media then suddenly turns against
[00:41.560 --> 00:42.560]  her.
[00:42.560 --> 00:46.000]  We're going to break it all down with an exclusive big announcement dealing with this
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.920]  lady and others on the other side of the break, but here is a key John Bowne report
[00:49.920 --> 00:51.960]  that ties into all of it.
[00:51.960 --> 00:57.880]  To recognize Oscar Lopez Rivera, formerly one of the leaders of the FLAN, a seditious
[00:57.880 --> 01:04.400]  Marxist paramilitary group responsible for over 130 bomb attacks on the United States
[01:04.400 --> 01:06.600]  in the name of Puerto Rican independence.
[01:06.600 --> 01:09.280]  Well, we'll have a parade for him, of course.
[01:09.280 --> 01:18.640]  My husband was at a business meeting January 24th, 1975 at Francis Tavern, the FALN of
[01:18.640 --> 01:27.480]  which Oscar Lopez Rivera was a leader, placed a bomb in the restaurant which exploded, killing
[01:27.480 --> 01:30.360]  four people, my husband among them.
[01:30.360 --> 01:37.320]  His being honored by being grand marshal of the parade is an absolute disgrace, and
[01:37.320 --> 01:44.320]  particularly that it's happening in New York where the FALN really had a reign of terror
[01:44.320 --> 01:50.920]  that affected all aspects of life in New York in the 70s and the early 80s.
[01:50.920 --> 01:55.640]  In Full Wars, Kellan McBreen writes, New York City's Puerto Rican Day parade will be honoring
[01:55.640 --> 01:58.560]  convicted terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera.
[01:58.560 --> 02:05.720]  He was sentenced to 55 years in prison in 1981 on charges of robbery, seditious conspiracy,
[02:05.720 --> 02:08.920]  and transportation of firearms and explosives.
[02:08.920 --> 02:14.920]  In January 2017, Rivera's prison sentence was commuted by then-President Barack Obama.
[02:14.920 --> 02:20.880]  Fellow domestic terrorist Bill Ayers celebrated Obama's clemency for Rivera on Twitter, saying
[02:20.880 --> 02:22.040]  great news.
[02:22.040 --> 02:28.000]  In 1999, former President Bill Clinton had offered clemency to Rivera and 15 other FALN
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.960]  members on the condition that they renounce the use or threatened use of violence for
[02:32.960 --> 02:33.960]  any purpose.
[02:33.960 --> 02:36.680]  Lopez Rivera refused.
[02:36.680 --> 02:42.880]  Back in 1999, CBS News reported, former New York City police officer Richard Pascarella
[02:42.880 --> 02:48.280]  was blinded and lost five fingers on his right hand in an FALN attack.
[02:48.280 --> 02:51.400]  He was outraged that 12 will be released.
[02:51.400 --> 02:53.360]  They will reorganize, he said.
[02:53.360 --> 02:59.000]  They will again voice their ideology on the American public with a bomb and with a gun.
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.880]  The New York Fire Department and the New York Police Department, as well as the New York
[03:02.880 --> 03:08.200]  Daily News and Univision, have dropped out of sponsoring the parade due to the decision
[03:08.200 --> 03:10.240]  to honor the convicted terrorist.
[03:10.240 --> 03:14.880]  But New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has no problem marching with him.
[03:14.880 --> 03:17.680]  Nelson Mandela was viewed as a terrorist to 2008.
[03:17.680 --> 03:20.640]  But this is, are you only comparing him to Nelson Mandela?
[03:20.640 --> 03:21.640]  Yeah.
[03:21.640 --> 03:25.160]  Martin Luther King was the most dangerous man in America by the FBI.
[03:25.160 --> 03:27.160]  He was shot and killed violently.
[03:27.160 --> 03:28.680]  What we're saying, we do this very often.
[03:28.680 --> 03:30.160]  Did Martin Luther King commit armed robbery?
[03:30.160 --> 03:31.160]  What we're saying is-
[03:31.160 --> 03:33.120]  No, what are you saying?
[03:33.120 --> 03:35.360]  What I'm saying is we conflate a lot of issues.
[03:35.360 --> 03:37.360]  We oftentimes don't believe in the cause.
[03:37.360 --> 03:38.360]  No, you're conflating-
[03:38.360 --> 03:39.360]  I'm actually not.
[03:39.360 --> 03:40.360]  I'm not even attacking the cause.
[03:40.360 --> 03:41.360]  Sure.
[03:41.360 --> 03:47.000]  I'm merely saying armed robbery and making bombs are not legitimate forms of political
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.360]  expression and you're saying they are.
[03:49.360 --> 03:55.640]  The United States has supported people who have done violent acts in the course of getting
[03:55.640 --> 03:57.000]  their freedom across the world.
[03:57.000 --> 03:58.240]  What we tend to do with people-
[03:58.240 --> 04:02.480]  When things fall apart, it's people like you who will be responsible for them.
[04:02.480 --> 04:04.880]  People who hold their constituents as victims of violence.
[04:04.880 --> 04:06.840]  It's people like you who actually try to conflate issues.
[04:06.840 --> 04:11.520]  But what I'm saying to you, whatever it is that is brought up when it comes to strategies
[04:11.520 --> 04:15.760]  for freedom and justice, to people who are privileged, usually try to dictate what should
[04:15.760 --> 04:17.520]  be done and who people should celebrate.
[04:17.520 --> 04:18.520]  You know what?
[04:18.520 --> 04:22.160]  All of us, of all colors and all incomes can agree that armed robbery is not legitimate.
[04:22.160 --> 04:28.040]  Mayor de Blasio, Congressman Luis Gutierrez and other leftist leaders have swallowed
[04:28.040 --> 04:31.560]  Rivera's lie that he was a political prisoner.
[04:31.560 --> 04:39.760]  Yet four Americans died and more than 50 were injured on January 24, 1975, after the FALN
[04:39.760 --> 04:45.160]  claimed responsibility for the bombing of Manhattan's historic Francis Tavern, the
[04:45.160 --> 04:48.560]  pre-revolutionary meeting place for the Sons of Liberty.
[04:48.560 --> 04:53.840]  The left's open hatred for America and everything it stands for will be on full display.
[04:53.840 --> 04:55.920]  June 11, 2017.
[04:55.920 --> 05:00.360]  John Bound for Enforce.com.
[05:00.360 --> 05:03.320]  December 23, 1776.
[05:03.320 --> 05:05.800]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[05:05.800 --> 05:10.000]  The summer soldier and the Sunshine Patriot Wheel in this crisis shrink from the service
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.280]  of their country, but he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and
[05:15.280 --> 05:16.280]  woman.
[05:16.280 --> 05:20.320]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered, yet we have this consolation with us that
[05:20.320 --> 05:23.320]  the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[05:23.320 --> 05:28.280]  But we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly, it is dearness only that gives everything
[05:28.280 --> 05:29.280]  its value.
[05:29.280 --> 05:34.040]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods, and it would be strange indeed
[05:34.040 --> 05:37.920]  if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[05:37.920 --> 05:42.640]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only
[05:42.640 --> 05:46.360]  to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[05:46.360 --> 05:50.620]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery
[05:50.620 --> 05:55.920]  upon earth, even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong
[05:55.920 --> 05:57.440]  to God.
[05:57.440 --> 05:59.920]  Thomas Paine, the American Crisis.
[05:59.920 --> 06:03.360]  After being sold out for months, our best selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is
[06:03.360 --> 06:06.000]  now back in stock at infowarestore.com.
[06:06.000 --> 06:07.800]  Research across the board is clear.
[06:07.800 --> 06:11.720]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood
[06:11.720 --> 06:13.120]  clots and heart attacks.
[06:13.120 --> 06:17.720]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[06:17.720 --> 06:20.520]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[06:20.520 --> 06:24.960]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[06:24.960 --> 06:27.600]  iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[06:27.600 --> 06:32.160]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out
[06:32.160 --> 06:34.720]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[06:34.720 --> 06:39.320]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[06:39.320 --> 06:44.240]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more, due to requests from listers who found that
[06:44.240 --> 06:46.720]  spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[06:46.720 --> 06:50.720]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint-free.
[06:50.720 --> 06:55.800]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com

[07:03.560 --> 07:05.400]  We've been sold out for months.

[07:10.560 --> 07:14.600]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[07:14.600 --> 07:19.160]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium,
[07:19.160 --> 07:24.280]  but Biotrusillinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[07:24.280 --> 07:27.800]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[07:27.800 --> 07:32.840]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, Biotrusillinium
[07:32.840 --> 07:37.000]  is also the perfect supercharger to survive a shield x2 mason iodine.
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.640]  As both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems, visit infowarslife.com

[07:57.640 --> 08:01.120]  That's infowarslife.com.
[08:01.120 --> 08:04.960]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[08:04.960 --> 08:05.960]  It's a guy named Alex Jones.
[08:05.960 --> 08:06.960]  Alex Jones.
[08:06.960 --> 08:07.960]  From InfoWars.
[08:07.960 --> 08:08.960]  From InfoWars.
[08:08.960 --> 08:09.960]  Yeah.
[08:09.960 --> 08:10.960]  Alex Jones.
[08:10.960 --> 08:14.160]  He's one of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[08:14.160 --> 08:17.160]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true.
[08:17.160 --> 08:21.900]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[08:21.900 --> 08:26.360]  The conspiracy du jour, Hilary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[08:26.360 --> 08:29.560]  She just had to keep digging, didn't she, Alex?
[08:29.560 --> 08:32.660]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so I know that it's true.
[08:32.660 --> 08:42.660]  The juice of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to very stories like the Clinton's body count stories that's according to website and award.
[08:42.660 --> 08:45.660]  And this really is just so disgusting.
[08:45.660 --> 08:48.660]  The juice of these pickles is on you Alex Jones.
[08:51.660 --> 08:54.660]  It goes right from Alex Jones and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[08:54.660 --> 08:57.660]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[08:57.660 --> 09:03.660]  It's a very fringe of the conspiracy movement like Alex Jones are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[09:03.660 --> 09:05.660]  If Trump gets elected he's going to be Secretary of Defense.
[09:05.660 --> 09:07.660]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[09:07.660 --> 09:09.660]  Move bitch! Get out of the way!
[09:09.660 --> 09:11.660]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[09:11.660 --> 09:13.660]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[09:13.660 --> 09:15.660]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[09:15.660 --> 09:17.660]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[09:17.660 --> 09:19.660]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[09:19.660 --> 09:21.660]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[09:21.660 --> 09:28.660]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance.
[09:28.660 --> 09:31.660]  It's Alex Jones.
[09:31.660 --> 09:39.660]  Last week I said this on air but I've also privately talked a lot about it to friends and family and crew.
[09:39.660 --> 09:46.660]  The whole Russia narrative, the whole Trump's erasist narrative, the whole Trump's evil misogynist narrative is imploding.
[09:46.660 --> 09:54.660]  Despite all the push-pulls and all the spin and all the deception, Trump is going up in scientific polls.
[09:54.660 --> 09:56.660]  And the establishment is panicking.
[09:56.660 --> 09:59.660]  They've hit him with everything they've got.
[09:59.660 --> 10:14.660]  They have committed so many just absolutely massive, massive, massive, massive distortions and lies that they are now discredited.
[10:14.660 --> 10:22.660]  And they've committed so much illegal leaking that it's now a gigantic criminal scandal and they're being exposed and caught.
[10:22.660 --> 10:24.660]  They're painted into a corner.
[10:24.660 --> 10:38.660]  Now, Kathy Griffith, or Griffin comes out, the CNN kind of failed comedian who's like a store mannequin.
[10:38.660 --> 10:51.660]  And she comes out and with a TMZ videographer, reportedly, creates this image of the president with his head cut off with blood pouring out across his face.
[10:51.660 --> 10:53.660]  Most of you have already seen the image.
[10:53.660 --> 10:57.660]  It's the top story in the world since it came out yesterday because it's so iconic.
[10:57.660 --> 11:07.660]  The girl next door looks like an elementary school teacher in a nice 1950s blue dress holding up the severed head of President Trump.
[11:07.660 --> 11:22.660]  All you need to do is pick an image out of ISIS's playbook and the two images are basically identical.
[11:22.660 --> 11:24.660]  Now, why are people so upset about this?
[11:24.660 --> 11:26.660]  Because everyone is fed up with it.
[11:26.660 --> 11:27.660]  Everybody sees through it.
[11:27.660 --> 11:33.660]  I have seen every major newspaper in the country call for Trump's death, call for Trump's murder.
[11:33.660 --> 11:38.660]  I've constantly heard the left go, man, I sure hope ISIS beheads him.
[11:38.660 --> 11:41.660]  That is a popular meme.
[11:41.660 --> 11:46.660]  Every time there's a terror attack, they say, good, go cut some Trump supporters' heads off.
[11:46.660 --> 11:53.660]  I see this all the time directed at me where they say, Jones, I hope ISIS blows you up or kills you.
[11:53.660 --> 11:56.660]  And of course, ISIS has put some of our reporters in their videos.
[11:56.660 --> 12:01.660]  Well, now, New York Times columnist tweets joke about killing Trump.
[12:01.660 --> 12:06.660]  That LA Times journalist hopes for Trump's death.
[12:06.660 --> 12:07.660]  Remember those headlines?
[12:07.660 --> 12:17.660]  MSNBC counterterrorism analyst calls for ISIS bombing of Trump property, calling for ISIS to strike Trump buildings on international television.
[12:17.660 --> 12:19.660]  We've got that clip.
[12:19.660 --> 12:24.660]  So now we're being told that Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself, the president says.
[12:24.660 --> 12:27.660]  And some are saying it's criminal what she did.
[12:27.660 --> 12:29.660]  No, you can say it's art.
[12:29.660 --> 12:33.660]  You can say that it's a symbol of what you think of Trump.
[12:33.660 --> 12:35.660]  You call for someone to cut his head off.
[12:35.660 --> 12:42.660]  Then it's a completely different kettle of fish.
[12:42.660 --> 12:57.660]  But these other people that have been calling for the president to die and been calling for others to kill him, they know exactly what they're doing.
[12:57.660 --> 12:59.660]  It is an avalanche.
[12:59.660 --> 13:00.660]  It is a tsunami.
[13:00.660 --> 13:17.660]  It is a torrent for calls for violence, calls for attacking Trump, his family, his wife, Bow Wow, calling for raping Melania Trump and putting her into sex slavery.
[13:17.660 --> 13:22.660]  Snoop Dogg putting out videos about killing the president.
[13:22.660 --> 13:27.660]  Like this is the atmosphere they've created and now they know it's backfiring.
[13:27.660 --> 13:33.660]  So MSCM has now chosen to pick Kathy Griffin as the scapegoat.
[13:33.660 --> 13:34.660]  I'm not defending her.
[13:34.660 --> 13:35.660]  I don't like her.
[13:35.660 --> 13:36.660]  I don't like her politics.
[13:36.660 --> 13:37.660]  She wants open borders.
[13:37.660 --> 13:38.660]  She wants globalism.
[13:38.660 --> 13:40.660]  She apologizes for the rapugees.
[13:40.660 --> 13:50.660]  As far as I'm concerned, people like her are partially responsible just like the Pope for these terror attacks that they try to basically whitewash.
[13:50.660 --> 14:03.660]  But she's a useful idiot in the final equation because all these other people went even further actually calling for his death or his murder or saying they want to kill him and they didn't get in trouble.
[14:03.660 --> 14:06.660]  She now says I beg for your forgiveness.
[14:06.660 --> 14:11.660]  That video is coming up.
[14:11.660 --> 14:16.660]  So I'm not defending her.
[14:16.660 --> 14:35.660]  But when the church of Satan even piles on and says that she's horrible, well, then you know that it's part of an establishment move because they understand that all these attacks and all these calls for violence on Trump are doing nothing more but backfiring on them in a big, big way.
[14:35.660 --> 14:46.660]  Now all of that said, I have a video clip that I'm going to play here of celebrities.
[14:46.660 --> 14:52.660]  This is a small sampling from Madonna to Snoop Dogg threatening to kill Trump.
[14:52.660 --> 15:11.660]  And when we come back, I'm going to announce a major initiative against this MSM terroristic bullying. That's what it is. The MSM has been involved in terroristic bullying of the American people and the Kathy Griffin saga has taken it to rock bottom and they have tried to force feed us all this garbage.
[15:11.660 --> 15:23.660]  So at least for now, they're taking a pause on their assault on Trump because everything they did in the campaign failed. Then they tripled the assault the last five months that failed the last six months.
[15:23.660 --> 15:35.660]  And now they're taking a respite and trying to reorganize and decide what new lies they need to push and put out because the Russian narrative is falling apart.
[15:35.660 --> 15:53.660]  Everything else they put out is falling apart. The fact that Trump's mentally ill, that's falling apart. So they're now kind of reassessing things and putting the brakes on things with Kathy Griffin, a third rate failed comic who they are now deciding to throw over the side of the boat.
[15:53.660 --> 16:06.660]  Because there are real debates in the whole Soros Globalist Combine about whether they're going to have nationwide riots coming up in July, that they're already financing, cop-killing riots, civil unrest. I mean, that's being prepared right now.
[16:06.660 --> 16:14.660]  And so that's why Kathy Griffin and others have been encouraged to act like this and it's been a safe climate to engage in this type of criminal activity in many cases.
[16:14.660 --> 16:23.660]  Where we see terrorism experts saying terrorists ought to strike Trump properties, inviting the attacks, recommending them, colluding with them.
[16:23.660 --> 16:33.660]  That's what Al Qaeda and ISIS is, is internet media personalities, production houses, trying to encourage lone wolves to go out and carry out attacks.
[16:33.660 --> 16:50.660]  And that's what the media has been doing. They've been acting just like Al Qaeda and just like ISIS. And that's why the new contest we're launching is called Expose the MSM Media Terrorist.
[16:50.660 --> 16:58.660]  And you've got the Chicago Tribute and everybody pointing out that Trump's properties are the soft targets. Again, trying to run down the value of them, you name it.
[16:58.660 --> 17:04.660]  People are at war with us and now they're silent war. Their secret war has been out in the open and they're getting their butts kicked.
[17:04.660 --> 17:11.660]  So now they want to pull back. That's what's happening right now because it's not working. Let's go to that clip.
[17:11.660 --> 17:21.660]  His wife said, well, he's a tough guy. He's not a tough guy. He's a bully and he's a bitch and he can suck my **** and I'll meet him in a hotel room any other day of the week.
[17:21.660 --> 17:30.660]  I hit pause real quick. Look at this poor guy. He looks like the cat woman. He's had so many plastic surgeries. He used to be a great actor, bombed out of his brain.
[17:30.660 --> 17:40.660]  Totally insane. I know folks that know him in Hollywood. Mickey Rourke threatening the president and he'll meet him with a baseball bat and all these other tough guys how they want to hurt or attack the president.
[17:40.660 --> 17:46.660]  All because he wants to try to protect the country and stop people like the guy that came in from Libya and blow up all these little girls.
[17:46.660 --> 17:57.660]  Let's back this up one more time. See, Mickey, being a tough guy is actually taking care of your family and your country and not siding with Islamists and having a big rubber face.
[17:57.660 --> 18:08.660]  I mean, you look like a clown. You look like an overweight tranny. You're the overweight tranny and then we've got Kathy Griffin.
[18:08.660 --> 18:16.660]  She looks like an anorexic tranny or something. I'm not against trannies. I'm just pointing out that we've got... I'm trolling the media there.
[18:16.660 --> 18:25.660]  I'm doing that on purpose as a joke, folks. Not bashing trannies. It's a joke even though he does look like the Joker or something. Let me be serious and play the club. Here it is.
[18:25.660 --> 18:36.660]  His wife said, well, he's a tough guy. He's not a tough guy. He's a bully and he's a bitch and he can suck my **** and I'll meet him in a hotel room any other day of the week and give him a Louisville slugger.
[18:36.660 --> 18:42.660]  Kiss my mother **** as you bitch punk **** sucker.
[18:42.660 --> 19:08.660]  Yes, I'm angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[19:08.660 --> 19:28.660]  And then, of course, Kathy Griffin with the severed head of Trump. They're all trying to say it's okay to be violent. It's okay to go out and kill. It's okay to kill the president.
[19:28.660 --> 19:38.660]  Let's simulate it. Let's get some copycatters doing this. Let's hype this up. This is a group of criminals trying to terrorize this country, trying to bully us into submission.
[19:38.660 --> 19:52.660]  And the bullying isn't working scumbags and all the little Hollywood turds that live behind big walls and have armed guards and that live in this free country and that run back to this nation like Ariana Grande after she says, I hope my fans die.
[19:52.660 --> 20:04.660]  After she promotes open borders, after she demonizes Trump, they still run back here. They don't run to the Middle East. They don't run to Syria. They don't run to Iraq. They don't run to Libya. They don't run to Saudi Arabia.
[20:04.660 --> 20:16.660]  And who's our government backing? The most radical Islamic groups in the Arab Spring that all over North Africa and all over Eastern Africa and all over the Middle East and all over Central Asia.
[20:16.660 --> 20:39.660]  They're beheading and murdering and enslaving and cutting women's genitals off. And I'm so sick of Katy Perry and I'm so sick of Ariana Grande and I'm so sick of Kathy Griffith and all these people running around trying to whip up war, trying to whip up violence, trying to whip up a civil war in this country when you don't even know how to shoot guns.
[20:39.660 --> 21:01.660]  And the main military is awake and the main police forces are awake. And they're awake that you have waged a war against the police and local government because you want to bully and intimidate them into submission under the Strong Cities Initiative of the United Nations so they become totally political and under your control as tools and implements of oppression.
[21:01.660 --> 21:21.660]  Well, guess what? That's not working and that's not going to happen. You are in checkmate, not us. Our king, our queen is in the rear with the gear and we've got our knights closing on you in a pincer attack. You are already in check with nowhere to run.
[21:21.660 --> 21:36.660]  Checkmate. The problem is will you try to cause riots? Will you try to overturn the table because you're becoming a regional party because you're becoming a joke because we the libertarian patriots are taking over the globalist power structure?
[21:36.660 --> 21:49.660]  Are you going to realize you're beaten? No, you're not. You're going to put out more lies, more garbage, more disinfo and you think you're going to get away with it when you're not.
[21:49.660 --> 22:00.660]  Now let me make the new announcement. It's up on infowars.com. It just went live. It is also up on big league politics.
[22:00.660 --> 22:11.660]  The story again is on infowars.com. Mike Cernovich called me last night.
[22:11.660 --> 22:20.660]  He called me last night and he said, Alex, I got a really good idea with this Kathy Griffin story.
[22:20.660 --> 22:31.660]  He said, you know how you did your Bill Clinton's a rapist contest and shelled out about $125,000 on that and how it happened thousands of times on national TV.
[22:31.660 --> 22:41.660]  It's still happening at Democratic rallies. They tried to change the subject onto Trump being a sexual predator with no evidence.
[22:41.660 --> 22:49.660]  When Bill Clinton has settled rape cases and done everything else and his wife defended pedophiles and other rapists that she knew were guilty, she's admitted that.
[22:49.660 --> 22:54.660]  So they took their big weakness, just like they were weak on Russia, so they blame that on Trump.
[22:54.660 --> 23:03.660]  They took their big weakness of their sexual predator activities and Jerry Epstein and Anthony Weiner and all the child porn garbage.
[23:03.660 --> 23:10.660]  And so they then projected that onto Trump. So what we did is we said, listen, we've got to take action.
[23:10.660 --> 23:15.660]  So Roger Stone and many others worked to get Bill Clinton's rape victims into that debate.
[23:15.660 --> 23:25.660]  And I worked with you, the listeners, to go out and simply say Bill Clinton's a rapist and to make it more fun, everybody that gets the shirt for more than five seconds or so,
[23:25.660 --> 23:35.660]  clearly on TV, you get $1,000. If you do it and get infowars.com out and the fact that the mainstream media are anti-American terrorists,
[23:35.660 --> 23:42.660]  that the fake news are a bunch of terroristic bullies, terms like that, out on CNN, Fox, I don't care.
[23:42.660 --> 23:47.660]  CNNs who were targeting because she works for CNN. She doesn't just do the bull drop.
[23:47.660 --> 23:51.660]  She's routinely on CNN. She does comedy for them. I see her on there all the time.
[23:51.660 --> 23:55.660]  I don't even watch much CNN. So she's a CNN worker. She's a CNN employee.
[23:55.660 --> 24:00.660]  And to fund this, we're going to sell a T-shirt. You also get $1,000 or $2,500.
[24:00.660 --> 24:08.660]  If you're seen wearing the T-shirt on national TV, C-SPAN, your local news, if that then gets picked up nationally or goes viral,
[24:08.660 --> 24:14.660]  I will choose $1,000 or $2,500 until it hits $200,000.
[24:14.660 --> 24:19.660]  Last time we hit $100,000 in like a few weeks. It's showing people did it successfully.
[24:19.660 --> 24:24.660]  And then still other folks were doing it. So I still paid out to some other folks, but I didn't really have the money.
[24:24.660 --> 24:29.660]  I don't really have $200,000 laying around, but this is worth it. This is a key crack in their facade.
[24:29.660 --> 24:33.660]  America is awake now. They jump the shark. This is iconic.
[24:33.660 --> 24:38.660]  So the shirts are being produced right now. Take them a week to get here. You'll have your shirts the next week and a half.
[24:38.660 --> 24:40.660]  But don't wait for that.
[24:40.660 --> 24:47.660]  We're putting the PDFs up on infowars.com at infowars.com forward slash contest or just on the front page right now.
[24:47.660 --> 24:52.660]  Operation exposed terrorist media. I'm going to tweet it out at real Alex Jones.
[24:52.660 --> 24:56.660]  I'm going to tweet it out on Paul Watson's Twitter. Please retweet it.
[24:56.660 --> 25:02.660]  You can make your own graphic, your own image, have a poster board, make your own T-shirt.
[25:02.660 --> 25:06.660]  I don't care what you do.
[25:06.660 --> 25:12.660]  However you do it, just get it on the news that CNN is a terrorist organization.
[25:12.660 --> 25:20.660]  That they're terrorizing people, that they're bullying, that they're promoting when Trump supporters get attacked and saying it's okay.
[25:20.660 --> 25:31.660]  But it's bigger than that. We're just using CNN and we're using Kathy Griffin as the poster child because they are the fake news network.
[25:31.660 --> 25:36.660]  You can do it to MSNBC, CNN, Fox. I don't care.
[25:36.660 --> 25:41.660]  All the big morning shows, all of them. Just don't break the law and don't get on private property.
[25:41.660 --> 25:46.660]  There's lots of ways to do it with a bullhorn or behind people or maybe pull up with a truck.
[25:46.660 --> 25:52.660]  Right where you know they're about to do a live feed with a big poster on the side that says CNN is a terrorist organization.
[25:52.660 --> 25:57.660]  Or it could be any other meme. Daria put one out today on our Twitter.
[25:57.660 --> 26:04.660]  That is the big high priestess that the Clintons go to, admitted in the New York Times, who does the occult rituals that even little kids attend.
[26:04.660 --> 26:13.660]  The Aleister Crowley stuff. We've got her with the goats head next to Kathy Griffin with the bloody Trump head, next to an ISIS guy with the head.
[26:13.660 --> 26:18.660]  And we say they all support open borders. They all support globalism.
[26:18.660 --> 26:24.660]  And they all want to run your lives. That's what they have in common. It could be something like this.
[26:24.660 --> 26:29.660]  Liberal scum wants to run your life. You put that on the side of a truck.
[26:29.660 --> 26:34.660]  You drive that truck, you know, peacefully wherever they're doing a live feed, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC.
[26:34.660 --> 26:38.660]  I don't care if it's a baseball game, a basketball game, a college game.
[26:38.660 --> 26:48.660]  Some people standing up the stupid college games on ESPN holding up all their signs and stuff about the team they care about or the football player or basketball player they love or baseball player they love.
[26:48.660 --> 27:01.660]  Put something like this out and get infowars.com involved. And that creates a massive lensing effect, an amplification effect where everybody then tunes in to infowars.com and we reach new people.
[27:01.660 --> 27:06.660]  Now it makes the media attack me more. It makes them try to shut us down, makes them try to come after us.
[27:06.660 --> 27:11.660]  But that's the way it is. I'm in an information war. I'm a big boy.
[27:11.660 --> 27:14.660]  Thank you for your prayers that really came through yesterday.
[27:14.660 --> 27:21.660]  You notice you're not hearing anything in the news about the big court case yesterday in my family case.
[27:21.660 --> 27:31.660]  Just praise God and Jesus Christ for the truth so far coming out and a good future for my family and my children and just thank you all for your prayers and support.
[27:31.660 --> 27:39.660]  I'm not going to say anything else. Just fake news media has got big egg on their face and that's why the MSM walked out of that courtroom and didn't print a word.
[27:39.660 --> 27:44.660]  Not a word. Did not print a word.
[27:44.660 --> 27:49.660]  I'm going to leave it right there but thank you all for your prayers. I know it's prayer. Thank you. God bless you all.
[27:49.660 --> 27:57.660]  Now, you got to go into the furnace first folks. You got to go to the lion's den first. And sometimes you don't make it out of the lion's den.
[27:57.660 --> 28:04.660]  Christ chose to be torn apart to be an example. And I'm not saying I'm Christ-like. The Bible says we should all try to be Christ-like.
[28:04.660 --> 28:08.660]  But in the fact that I'm willing to go all the way, that is one of my only Christ-like attributes.
[28:08.660 --> 28:13.660]  That I love people and I hate tyrants and I'm not afraid of them and I realize it's sacrifice.
[28:13.660 --> 28:18.660]  I don't want to die. I don't want to be destroyed. I don't want to be imprisoned. I don't want to lose my family.
[28:18.660 --> 28:24.660]  But you know what? I'm going to lose my family anyways if I don't stand against this enemy. There's no turning back from this boys.
[28:24.660 --> 28:33.660]  So, this is the biggest meme I've ever seen. We're going to make this whole contest a meme factory where we post everybody's memes.
[28:33.660 --> 28:41.660]  I mean, you could use the Ben Garrison meme we just showed or one of the other cartoonist memes. We can put it back on screen.
[28:41.660 --> 28:48.660]  You can put that on a side of a truck or on a poster board and then just plug in FullWars.com.
[28:48.660 --> 28:54.660]  That way Ben Garrison gets promoted. The truth gets promoted. And of course, what's the new symbol?
[28:54.660 --> 28:58.660]  The new Ben Garrison logo, the new Ben Garrison genius art.
[28:58.660 --> 29:03.660]  It's Kathy Griffin's cutting her own head off with a butcher knife saying oops.
[29:03.660 --> 29:11.660]  And that's the other t-shirt we're having designed right now is her cutting her own head off. It is crazy. He thought of the same thing.
[29:11.660 --> 29:16.660]  In fact, I thought about her cutting her nose off and the graphics guy said wouldn't it be better just to have her cut her own head off?
[29:16.660 --> 29:21.660]  I love how great minds think alike. But that is exactly what she did. She cut her own head off.
[29:21.660 --> 29:26.660]  Hey, let's call Ben and see if we can license putting that out on the front of a shirt right now.
[29:26.660 --> 29:30.660]  I can manufacture these in the U.S. these shirts. Turn them around in days.
[29:30.660 --> 29:35.660]  We're going to go wild with this. She's their new poster girl. Let's make her that.
[29:35.660 --> 29:43.660]  $200,000 contest. But the real fun is going to see MSM on its knees hiding out, afraid to go outside because everywhere they go,
[29:43.660 --> 29:49.660]  we're going to be there exposing them as terroristic bullies. And we've now called their bluff. This is exciting.
[29:49.660 --> 29:59.660]  Yes! Ah! Ah! Oh, yes! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Yeah!
[30:20.660 --> 30:25.660]  But how your liberties can be secured. For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[30:25.660 --> 30:33.660]  Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[30:33.660 --> 30:37.660]  Today, everything the government does at every level is concealed from us.
[30:37.660 --> 30:42.660]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[30:42.660 --> 30:48.660]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[30:48.660 --> 30:56.660]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object. Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[30:56.660 --> 31:19.660]  For NFA Wars.com, I'm David Knight.
[31:26.660 --> 31:37.660]  Children, do the best job you can to purify your error. The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[31:37.660 --> 31:47.660]  The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:47.660 --> 31:53.660]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:53.660 --> 31:59.660]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today in NFA Wars.com.
[31:59.660 --> 32:13.660]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lessington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[32:13.660 --> 32:20.660]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about. It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[32:20.660 --> 32:32.660]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.
[32:32.660 --> 32:38.660]  We have over a thousand high quality products available that are discounted at NFA Wars.com.
[32:38.660 --> 32:51.660]  You add auto-ship, several of these are lost leaders. 65% off Coil Silver. You sign up for auto-ship, you get an additional 10% off and lock in the price. Supermail 30% off. Add the 10% off for auto-ship, that's 40% off.
[32:51.660 --> 33:17.660]  These are our Memorial Day specials as we remember the fallen in defense of this republic, the true trailblazers on which all of us stand.
[33:17.660 --> 33:25.660]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[33:25.660 --> 33:52.660]  So, we've been hiding under a rock, which I don't blame people doing. It broke yesterday afternoon. Kathy Griffin, the failed CNN comic, working with a TMZ journalist reportedly, a journalist, camera person, did an iconic video and photographs of her in a Miss America 1955 blue dress with a red hair
[33:52.660 --> 34:04.660]  complimenting a dummy head of Trump that looked a lot like him with blood running down the face. And Barron saw it and got really upset, obviously, that they've been calling for Barron to be killed.
[34:04.660 --> 34:09.660]  They've been calling for his mother to be killed. They've been calling for his sisters and brothers to be killed.
[34:09.660 --> 34:17.660]  I have stacks of news articles here. New York Times columnist tweets, jokes about killing Trump. L.A. Times journalist hopes for Trump's death.
[34:17.660 --> 34:31.660]  I mean, you all know about every major globalist minion wannabe tough guy out there has been talking about how they want to kill Trump, how they want to blow up the White House.
[34:31.660 --> 34:39.660]  MSM counterterrorism analyst calls for ISIS to bomb Trump properties. I mean, we can play that clip if you want. That's from a month ago.
[34:39.660 --> 34:50.660]  Kathy Griffin should be ashamed, says Trump. People ask, isn't he legal? No, she didn't say kill the president. She did some very obnoxious performance art, you could argue.
[34:50.660 --> 35:05.660]  That is pushing the idea of violence and this whole atmosphere of the riots they want in July that Mike Cernovich first broke months ago that Soros is admittedly funding at double the rates he was ever funding civil unrest previously.
[35:05.660 --> 35:13.660]  He's been a big part of overthrowing parts of the Middle East, Ukraine, you name it. So he means business. They're planning something big this summer.
[35:13.660 --> 35:22.660]  But finally this caught the public and it's just people are so sick of it and the demonization has backfired. I was telling crew members last week.
[35:22.660 --> 35:30.660]  I said it on air. I said they've hit bottom. It's now backfiring. What is their next tactic going to be? And I believe it's going to be false flags to make themselves the victims.
[35:30.660 --> 35:37.660]  We'll talk to Mike Cernovich whose idea was to have this contest and I want him involved in this, helping promote it in the middle of it.
[35:37.660 --> 35:44.660]  And I guess kind of a ringmaster because the whole world is a stage. Each of us players upon it. We believe in what we're saying and what we're doing.
[35:44.660 --> 35:53.660]  But we're doing this as art to expose the globalist and we want it legal and lawful, 200,000. That means you could have 200 winners at $1,000 apiece.
[35:53.660 --> 36:04.660]  But people that say infowars.com, infowars.com at least a couple times and something like terroristic bullying media is the enemy of America. CNN is fake news.
[36:04.660 --> 36:15.660]  Infowars.com is real. And it's okay if you throw in other stuff. You throw in Drudge Report or you throw in Mike Cernovich.
[36:15.660 --> 36:24.660]  But we're the tip of the spear and we're the main information warfare ship under attack. I mean, we are under the big frontline attack, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:24.660 --> 36:33.660]  But in my experience, we've got to go through the attack and then it always gets better on the other side. It's rough in the fight, but we come out stronger at every level.
[36:33.660 --> 36:40.660]  Life's like a video game or video games are imitating life. Every level, it gets harder but more interesting and you get stronger.
[36:40.660 --> 36:48.660]  And we've just come through some big things the last few days in my personal life, total prayer, absolute answers to prayer.
[36:48.660 --> 36:53.660]  That's why you hear nothing in the media about my personal life anymore right now. And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[36:53.660 --> 37:00.660]  But just thank God for your prayers and everything else. Audience, you're amazing. I am so humbled by you.
[37:00.660 --> 37:06.660]  When I'm out in public, I run into people Hispanic, black, white, old, young. It doesn't matter. We're all together wanting liberty.
[37:06.660 --> 37:17.660]  And it's so humbling. Whether I'm at the hospital, you're having a baby and there's white doctors and Asian doctors and black nurses and white nurses and black doctors.
[37:17.660 --> 37:25.660]  And they're all love me and we're listening just days before and I'm walking out of the delivery room and I hear my voice and people are listening to me on their earphones they've pulled out.
[37:25.660 --> 37:34.660]  And then I walk outside to the car and people run up and I'm not bragging about how big info wars is. The point is you're awake.
[37:34.660 --> 37:41.660]  It's like radar. We're sending out our sonar. Is there anybody out there? We're getting so many pings. It's like, wow, half the public's awake.
[37:41.660 --> 37:48.660]  They just don't realize how much power they've got. So I'm going to launch probably 10 different t-shirts. They're all going to be limited runs.
[37:48.660 --> 37:54.660]  I'm going to print each t-shirt one time and that's it. Okay. And we're going to have a whole bunch of variants.
[37:54.660 --> 38:05.660]  They're available right now of Kathy Griffin cutting Trump's head off and saying CNN terrorist. CNN at the top. Image of her with a knife. Trump's bloody head.
[38:05.660 --> 38:23.660]  Terrorist. CNN or terrorist. Or CNN. Enemy. We're going to have CNN on top under it. Enemy. And other slogans like that to really get out there and get in their face. And how are people going to run up and get violent with us?
[38:23.660 --> 38:36.660]  Like they do with Trump shirts or info wars shirts sometimes when it's her doing violence. It's them. We take CNN. We take MSM. That's the enemy. We take their weakest point. 6% trust rates in a major AP study.
[38:36.660 --> 38:46.660]  And we say, oh, it's not about Trump now we're defending. It's about you are MSM and we're against you. And we're all coming together. Liberal, conservative, old, young, you name it.
[38:46.660 --> 38:57.660]  Around wearing these t-shirts and listen, everybody can make the Kathy Griffin t-shirts. I came up with the idea for Hillary for prison. Mike Cernovich came up with this idea and gave it to me because you know all finance it.
[38:57.660 --> 39:05.660]  It's not about personalities. It's not about who's number one. It's about how we're winning and magnifying all of each other for the big victory. So we're going to Mike Cernovich just a moment.
[39:05.660 --> 39:12.660]  Get the shirts. It'll take four or five days to get them printed. They'll be here by next week. You will get the shirts shipped to you next week.
[39:12.660 --> 39:21.660]  Order the shirts infowarstore.com. That'll pay hopefully we saw a lot of them for the $200,000 prize. Okay.
[39:21.660 --> 39:33.660]  $100,000 was the last contest. It sent shock waves throughout the campaign. It was a total game changer. Trump has told me personally that that contest and the Hillary for prison got him elected.
[39:33.660 --> 39:42.660]  But the enemy knows that too. That's why they're coming after us. I think that is the iconic shirt that our great graphics folks have put together. CNN terrorist. Robert is so amazing.
[39:42.660 --> 39:54.660]  And I hope you buy a lot of these shirts because he deserves a bonus. Operation exposed terrorist media infowarstore.com. Order one of these iconic shirts right now.
[39:54.660 --> 40:03.660]  I'm going to come out with 10 different designs and we're going to print a limited run of each one. I never know which is going to sell. So if you want one of these shirts, this is your chance to support the broadcast and fund this.
[40:03.660 --> 40:10.660]  And a lot of people go out to say Bill Clinton's a rapist like Mike Cernovich still does and others. They didn't want the prize money. They thought it was a great idea to be part of this movement.
[40:10.660 --> 40:19.660]  But it's about showing our power. It's different than a flash mob. It's different than the media saying kill Trump supporters or attack Trump supporters and then people go out and do it.
[40:19.660 --> 40:30.660]  This is about peacefully going out, showing our power, exercising our free speech and showing how numerous we are and how diverse we are. And it sends them to their knees at Cleveland.
[40:30.660 --> 40:40.660]  And then we're going to our guest for the RNC. When they came to a rally that had like 4,000 people at it and a third of them were black. The other third were Hispanic.
[40:40.660 --> 40:49.660]  I'll be honest, I haven't seen Asian people there because they're too busy working like us white folks and Hispanics and blacks. We're working, but we'll just go out and protest. I've never seen Asian folks protesting.
[40:49.660 --> 41:02.660]  And I'm not bashing Asians. It's just a fact we've all seen it. But it was like the crowd was at least half, quote, minority. That scares the daylights out of these people.
[41:02.660 --> 41:15.660]  Because they know we're unifying folks. That's why they say we're racist all day because they're so scared of unifying around a culture of wealth and productivity and self-defense and men being men, women being women and success and honor and community.
[41:15.660 --> 41:20.660]  We're ready for it. We want it. We're tired of being told we're crap all day, turned against each other.
[41:20.660 --> 41:33.660]  So infowarstore.com. Go get your t-shirt today. Also, we're extending the Memorial Day special because these are some of the biggest specials. And on two items, the biggest ever on colloidal silver and on knockout. You sign up for auto ship. It's 75% off.
[41:33.660 --> 41:49.660]  It's already 65 on the colloidal silver. It's 75. That's a loss leader. Sign up for auto ship. Knockout's not 50. It's 60% off. Sign up for auto ship and brain force is 57% off, not just 47% off.
[41:49.660 --> 41:59.660]  And that way you're always supporting the broadcast. That way the orders come in. You know you're going to need more in a month or 60 days or 90 days. You just click that. It reorders for you. Cancel anytime.
[41:59.660 --> 42:09.660]  But that way you don't have to remember to get your brain force or get your X2 or get your knockout. And by the way, when you sign up for it under this, it locks it in the next time at the sales price.
[42:09.660 --> 42:17.660]  That's an exciting part about it. Go read the reviews. I'll give you more of the reviews later because I want to go to Mike Cernovich.
[42:17.660 --> 42:22.660]  But this is such an exciting time to be alive because I've been waiting for another contest.
[42:22.660 --> 42:34.660]  I've been saying that we pioneered having these contests for free speech, Leland Loughley, with the Bill Clinton rape stuff and the vaccine awareness things I've done, the Bill Clinton Joker and the Obama Joker stuff we've done.
[42:34.660 --> 42:44.660]  But I've been waiting for the right moment, waiting for the right thing. And when I saw this Kathy Griffin thing, I said this is going to be huge. She's going to be destroyed by this. They've gone too far. People are fed up.
[42:44.660 --> 42:56.660]  She did this right at the right moment where people were finally sick of the poison, about to throw it up, about to reject it. And the numbers show that, but I can feel it. She came right at the right time where they've now are throwing her overboard.
[42:56.660 --> 43:06.660]  And why are they doing that? That's another big question because they're preparing riots this summer. They want to pull back now and have the media act like they're not for the violence because they're getting ready to actually trigger it.
[43:06.660 --> 43:17.660]  They've got it built up and ready. Now they want to start decrying it a month out from July before they trigger it. We're almost exactly a month out from the July 3rd riots. They're publicly planning nationwide.
[43:17.660 --> 43:27.660]  So they want to pull back, act like they're all for peace so they can act like they repudiated those calling for violence ahead of it and ahead of them launching false flags on patriots.
[43:27.660 --> 43:39.660]  I've been kind of analyzing it and kind of the teletype just popped out. That's my analysis. So Mike Cernovich, the man that thought up this counter offensive against these terroristic bullies that are MSCM. Great job, my friend.
[43:39.660 --> 43:57.660]  Yeah, thank you. Right when it happened, I thought because, you know, a lot of people listening at home don't realize that Alex and I had a big meeting in Austin and we said, you know, we really want to find ways to help people who listen and maybe want to make a career in journalism, but you can't hire everybody.
[43:57.660 --> 44:10.660]  But we want to find ways to spread the wealth around voluntarily. And this contest is a way for people to say, hey, you know, maybe I'm a young kid. I'm struggling or hey, maybe I want to get into the media game or whatever.
[44:10.660 --> 44:23.660]  But I don't know what to do. And it's fun to add some booty in there. Exactly. So help people out financially. Alex and I, we don't fly around and fly the jets. We're not driving around, you know, in 50 different cars or whatever.
[44:23.660 --> 44:32.660]  We're always thinking, how can we pump this money back into our economy so that people are no longer afraid to lose their job? Exactly, because just like Henry Ford said, he was a bad guy.
[44:32.660 --> 44:41.660]  And anyways, he's right. They go, why do you pay people 10 times when anybody else does? He goes, because I want to build an economy where they can buy the cars. I want to build a middle class. We need a middle class.
[44:41.660 --> 44:48.660]  We need to spend money and build things or there isn't a civilization to live in. That's exactly right.
[44:48.660 --> 45:01.660]  Building our own economy is the exact phrase that Alex and I used at Easter brunch we had with my wife and daughter. We said, how can we build up more people? How can we build this economy so that people have more success and more prosperity?
[45:01.660 --> 45:10.660]  So these contests are a perfect way. And then, of course, this contest, which, you know, the rules are, they're not that strict. If you read them, we're not trying to play games with people.
[45:10.660 --> 45:24.660]  We're trying to reward good faith efforts for people to spread the message that CNN is the eyes that they are a terrorist organization that are trying to not just get Trump killed, but they're trying to get everybody who supported Trump killed.
[45:24.660 --> 45:30.660]  And it shows how arrogant they are. And again, $100,000 contest brought them to their knees probably changed the outcome of the election.
[45:30.660 --> 45:41.660]  Imagine what $200,000 is going to do. And again, we were, we reserve the right because moles can go out and try to false flag us and do bad things with this. So we reserve the right to refuse, you know, anybody winning.
[45:41.660 --> 45:53.660]  But we paid out to everybody, folks. You saw the contest winners, but it's not even about that. It's about getting back in their face, pointing out that mainstream media is the enemy and that we will not put up with their bullying anymore, Mike.
[45:53.660 --> 46:05.660]  Yeah. And it's about speaking out, which is why when I was at that Austin rally, I took on the microphone and said, Bill Clinton is a rapist. And then you triggered that kind of animosity and anger from them that Kathy Griffin has.
[46:05.660 --> 46:13.660]  Here's the way I look at it. If Alex wants to give an event, he's going to have people disrupted. If I'm going to do an event, people are going to disrupt it.
[46:13.660 --> 46:24.660]  It is time for us, legally and lawfully, if we see CNN out there recording an interview, we need to get right up in there. Free country, public space. We have every right to go up there.
[46:24.660 --> 46:32.660]  That when CNN is filming something out on the street corner, they don't have a right to exclude anybody. They don't have that property right there.
[46:32.660 --> 46:43.660]  So people have every right to go up there and say, why is your employee Kathy Griffin a terrorist? Why do you support terrorism? Why won't CNN do the right thing and renounce terrorism?
[46:43.660 --> 46:49.660]  See, we have every right to do it and we're going to exercise that right and we want to incentivize people to exercise that right.
[46:49.660 --> 47:00.660]  And again, Mike Cernovich is our guest. Let's expand on that. If you just joined us, I launched, I've launched many of these campaigns, but the most successful was obviously the Bill Clinton's a rapist situation.
[47:00.660 --> 47:10.660]  You didn't need to buy the T-shirt. We had the MP3 or MP3. We had the JPEG image up on infowars.com so that you could download it so that you could use it.
[47:10.660 --> 47:18.660]  You can make your own image. If you don't have the T-shirt, that's fine. You can just paint it on a shirt or you can put it on the side of your truck.
[47:18.660 --> 47:33.660]  However you do it creatively, as long as it gets out on the news, national news, $1,000, you get infowars.com in and get audio in on top of it, that this woman and the mainstream media are the enemy and are terrorists and have been terrorizing us
[47:33.660 --> 47:43.660]  and that they are a foreign force, you get $2,500. And again, I had a $100,000 budget. I went over 125,000 last time because there were stragglers coming in that did a great job.
[47:43.660 --> 47:50.660]  Even though I'd stopped the contest after a month, they kind of got mad so I paid out some more people. Okay, but we're not made out of money here.
[47:50.660 --> 47:58.660]  But I just know, I feel in my gut this is going to absolutely take off. It was going to be $100,000. Remember last night we talked, but I'm doing $200,000.
[47:58.660 --> 48:08.660]  And listen, if you buy enough T-shirts, it can become its own economy. Those of you that have money, buy the shirts, promote free speech, let the mainstream media know that they're the enemy, meet like-minded people,
[48:08.660 --> 48:18.660]  and then I'll just keep putting the money back in, we'll go to $1,000,000, $2,000,000, $5,000,000. I mean, theoretically, if enough shirts got bought, we would change the whole landscape of the country, the greatest meme ever seen,
[48:18.660 --> 48:21.660]  and you'd have people winning $5,000,000.
[48:21.660 --> 48:31.660]  Exactly right. So people can buy 10 shirts, give them out, buy 10 shirts, give them to homeless people. Right? Whoa, I just thought of that. What do you think of that, Alex?
[48:31.660 --> 48:34.660]  Give them to homeless people and then they're going to be walking billboards.
[48:34.660 --> 48:47.660]  Wow. Yes, I just thought of that right now, that people who are more successful could buy, you know, 10 shirts, 100 shirts, walk around and give them to homeless people, and then we'll have everybody wearing these shirts.
[48:47.660 --> 48:54.660]  And you know what, the homeless and trendies and people, they like violence and death and blood. We don't. But they'll love these shirts and they'll wear them.
[48:54.660 --> 49:08.660]  Exactly. And then that will spread the meme even further, because we want everybody to know that CNN, I mean, think back to this, Alex. For 18 months, the media has lied about the violence against Trump supporters.
[49:08.660 --> 49:12.660]  They've incited it. They call us Nazis and then they go, so K to punch Nazi.
[49:12.660 --> 49:17.660]  And it came out in the WikiLeaks, they were sending women to start fights to get beat up to blame us.
[49:17.660 --> 49:28.660]  Exactly. The bird dog and everything. All CNN had to do when Kathy Griffin posted that was to say, that's wrong. We discourage this and she's gone from New Year's Eve.
[49:28.660 --> 49:35.660]  They couldn't even do that. She's still going to host New Year's Eve. As of right now, she will still be hosting New Year's Eve with Anderson Pooper.
[49:35.660 --> 49:42.660]  That's right. We want her fired. They want to fire Sean Hannity, people for investigating reasonable murder investigations.
[49:42.660 --> 49:50.660]  They want to fire O'Reilly for settling stuff, you know, 10 years ago, and I'm not even defending him. But then this woman and this whole culture, they're saying kill Trump, basically.
[49:50.660 --> 49:58.660]  Many of them are actually saying it and none of them get in trouble. They all need to get in trouble because they're trying to foment insurrection.
[49:58.660 --> 50:05.660]  When we come back, let's start getting into something you've been on for months. They now admit Soros and others are funding in July.
[50:05.660 --> 50:11.660]  Massive civil unrest, violence, new waves of cop killing have been announced by leftist groups.
[50:11.660 --> 50:18.660]  They're so bold. They're planning something big. Tell us about your intel on the other side and what we see with Griffin ties into this.
[50:18.660 --> 50:23.660]  But briefly, you've got several websites, Twitter, you name it. How do folks follow you?
[50:23.660 --> 50:31.660]  The easiest way right now is twitter.com forward slash C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H. Twitter.com forward slash Cernovich.

[54:18.660 --> 54:24.660]  Coming up, I'm turning to business with us a little bit in the next hour. Then Roger Stone is here in Austin. He is going to be in studio with us.
[54:24.660 --> 54:30.660]  Why is Roger Stone here? Because I'm intending to launch in the next month and a half or so.
[54:30.660 --> 54:39.660]  I've just got to set an absolute deadline and go with it. I've got to come up with the name of the shows. I'm going to hold people in place, the equipment, to launch basically a TV network.
[54:39.660 --> 54:43.660]  We've got the satellites and we already have some cable and some TV stations picking us up.
[54:43.660 --> 54:52.660]  But cable TV that's in a talk radio format, something I launched 15, 16, 17 years ago, that's basically tailored to talk radio.
[54:52.660 --> 54:55.660]  So that's what's going on. That's what's being built. That's what's being set up.
[54:55.660 --> 55:00.660]  Cernovich is going to have his own show. Stone is going to have his own show. David Knight is going to have his own show.
[55:00.660 --> 55:09.660]  Owen Shor is going to have his own show. And they're going to be somewhat round tables for part of it because a lot of our hosts will be remote,
[55:09.660 --> 55:15.660]  but will also be anchored by professional stuff with HD audio and video here in Austin, Texas.
[55:15.660 --> 55:22.660]  We're about to upgrade everything. We've got new huge half million dollar studio going in, just the studio.
[55:22.660 --> 55:26.660]  Another quarter million dollars of equipment. That sounds like a lot. That's cheap to build TV studios.
[55:26.660 --> 55:29.660]  But these are nice and we're really making a run at them.
[55:29.660 --> 55:39.660]  So I'm so excited. I know in my heart, my spirit that this Kathy Griffin CNN is a terrorist organization meme.
[55:39.660 --> 55:45.660]  It's going to take over. And again, it's not just about CNN. It's any MSM you want to target. They're all in on it.
[55:45.660 --> 55:49.660]  Expose them. It's just the meme that everybody knows about Griffin and CNN.
[55:49.660 --> 55:53.660]  So you use that to bring solidarity together. I know this is going to be huge.
[55:53.660 --> 55:59.660]  Think about the Bill Clinton's a rapist. That's that's still happening every few days at Democrat rallies.
[55:59.660 --> 56:02.660]  People get on the mics and say, Bill Clinton's a rapist. I mean, this is devastating them.
[56:02.660 --> 56:07.660]  What do you make, though, as I asked you earlier about the plans for riots a month from now?
[56:07.660 --> 56:12.660]  I think they're backing off open calls for violence a month out because suddenly the guns have stopped.
[56:12.660 --> 56:19.660]  They're saying don't call for violence because they want plausible deniability in one month when their operatives start burning down cities.
[56:19.660 --> 56:24.660]  Yeah. Well, it turned out even that that Portland, a terrible, terrible person in Portland,
[56:24.660 --> 56:31.660]  he was a left winger running a scythe against the right wing and we actually exposed that before it could even happen.
[56:31.660 --> 56:35.660]  That's right. Explain that. It's now come out that he was a Democrat and a bunch of other stuff.
[56:35.660 --> 56:41.660]  Yeah. So when it happened, I was covering the story and I got a phone call when I was doing a live stream.
[56:41.660 --> 56:46.660]  And a guy goes, no, no, no, we were at the rally. We called the police on him.
[56:46.660 --> 56:52.660]  They reported him by they, I mean that the Patriots, the Trump supporters reported him to the Portland police.
[56:52.660 --> 56:56.660]  But the Portland police thought that they were that guy was going to hurt them.
[56:56.660 --> 56:59.660]  So he thought he was going to hurt Trump supporters so they didn't act on it.
[56:59.660 --> 57:03.660]  And that was what happened. The Portland murder was preventable.
[57:03.660 --> 57:10.660]  But because of these standout orders that all these liberal police departments have, they didn't act on that tip that they received.
[57:10.660 --> 57:15.660]  So this Portland train suspect guy, he stabbed two people I consider him a terrorist.
[57:15.660 --> 57:19.660]  He tried to pretend that he was a patriot.
[57:19.660 --> 57:23.660]  But when you went back through his social media, he said he hates Jews. He hates Christian.
[57:23.660 --> 57:26.660]  He said he wanted to, didn't he say he wanted to get you too?
[57:26.660 --> 57:30.660]  Everybody. Yeah. He wants to get everybody who supported Trump.
[57:30.660 --> 57:34.660]  He's a sack of garbage. Exactly.
[57:34.660 --> 57:39.660]  So the left, the left wing media was trying to frame us. This was a sign.
[57:39.660 --> 57:41.660]  And I'm not saying he's a sack of garbage because he has long hair.
[57:41.660 --> 57:46.660]  He has that idiotic look in his eye, that little belligerent gang member thing of like a 12 year old punk.
[57:46.660 --> 57:50.660]  Total arrest of development. Daddy never, you know, daddy wasn't home.
[57:50.660 --> 57:52.660]  Daddy never spanked him. He just thinks he can do whatever he want.
[57:52.660 --> 57:56.660]  Well, guess what? You're going to prison now for 20 years, you dumbass.
[57:56.660 --> 58:02.660]  Yeah. 35 year old portal loser, like every other terrorist, he's a complete total loser, nothing going on.
[58:02.660 --> 58:08.660]  And he was a left wing operative. And then people who I had sources who sent me the screen caps,
[58:08.660 --> 58:13.660]  he admitted that he was running a scythe because somebody buttered up to him and said,
[58:13.660 --> 58:16.660]  oh, hey, I noticed that you're with this Trump people. Let's frame them.
[58:16.660 --> 58:19.660]  And he goes, oh, yeah, I'm running a scythe on the Trump people.
[58:19.660 --> 58:22.660]  And I want to frame them to make the Trump people look evil.
[58:22.660 --> 58:25.660]  And that's why their heaven is about the story now. And you broke that again.
[58:25.660 --> 58:30.660]  It's not about praise, but about the fact that people take an action like Cernovich or change the world.
[58:30.660 --> 58:35.660]  And when you take action supporting us and spreading the word and getting involved in this new contest,
[58:35.660 --> 58:39.660]  exposing the media terrorist, you are Paul Revere. I salute you all.
[58:39.660 --> 58:42.660]  Hour number two, 70 seconds away.

[59:19.660 --> 59:22.660]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[59:22.660 --> 59:28.660]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[59:28.660 --> 59:35.660]  It works. Defender body armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification
[59:35.660 --> 59:38.660]  from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[59:38.660 --> 59:43.660]  Defender armor is now available through infowarstore.com so you can defend yourself, your family,
[59:43.660 --> 59:47.660]  and finance the info war against the globalist all at the same time.

[1:00:14.660 --> 1:00:19.660]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[1:00:19.660 --> 1:00:25.660]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:00:25.660 --> 1:00:31.660]  I could smell victory in the air. Again, I told the crew.
[1:00:31.660 --> 1:00:37.660]  Told my family I said, this anti-Trump stuff, I know they're putting 15 points or more against him in the polls
[1:00:37.660 --> 1:00:40.660]  and his polls are still rising. They're in full panic mode.
[1:00:40.660 --> 1:00:44.660]  The country is pro-Trump. Only the dumbest, conned trendies aren't.
[1:00:44.660 --> 1:00:49.660]  It's not like we worship Trump. We just recognize he's legitimately calling terrorists losers
[1:00:49.660 --> 1:00:56.660]  because that makes people then not go do it. You call them dangerous and evil and powerful and all these nerds.
[1:00:56.660 --> 1:00:59.660]  That's who does it. Don't care if they're white, black, Arab, it doesn't matter.
[1:00:59.660 --> 1:01:04.660]  It's all the same type. Little wimps who are always jealous of women because they don't want to date them.
[1:01:04.660 --> 1:01:11.660]  Women don't want to date me. Let me go blow up 70-something of them. The FBI has profiles, folks.
[1:01:11.660 --> 1:01:15.660]  These are literally... Of course, who wants to go blow up random people?
[1:01:15.660 --> 1:01:18.660]  If somebody does something to you, go beat the brains out yourself.
[1:01:18.660 --> 1:01:24.660]  I'm not saying do that either. But if somebody does something to you, then you might do something back.
[1:01:24.660 --> 1:01:28.660]  You don't go blow up little teenagers. They're losers.
[1:01:28.660 --> 1:01:32.660]  Trump is so smart, isn't he? To call them losers, Sernovich.
[1:01:32.660 --> 1:01:34.660]  Exactly right. And we had talked about this.
[1:01:34.660 --> 1:01:42.660]  Scott Adams and I talked about how the propaganda by ISIS was created with Hollywood propagandists in mind.
[1:01:42.660 --> 1:01:46.660]  So Hollywood had actually helped ISIS do their propaganda videos.
[1:01:46.660 --> 1:01:48.660]  That's something a lot of people don't know.
[1:01:48.660 --> 1:01:56.660]  That Hollywood gives them scripts, gives them camera footage, tells them how to shoot these really inspiring videos
[1:01:56.660 --> 1:01:59.660]  that make these loser nerds think that they're going to...
[1:01:59.660 --> 1:02:03.660]  I'm about to say some of the footage that ISIS puts out Stanley Kubrick couldn't do it.
[1:02:03.660 --> 1:02:10.660]  Exactly. That's Hollywood. So a lot of people don't know that Hollywood actually teaches them how to shoot footage.
[1:02:10.660 --> 1:02:15.660]  They write scripts for them. There's a big terrorist connection between Hollywood and ISIS.
[1:02:15.660 --> 1:02:18.660]  And that Kathy Griffin thing was a direct effigy.
[1:02:18.660 --> 1:02:25.660]  It was a direct unconscious message to ISIS to say that we love you and we worship you and that we adore you.
[1:02:25.660 --> 1:02:28.660]  That was the whole reason she did that. It was a tribute to ISIS.
[1:02:28.660 --> 1:02:34.660]  And it was so bad again that the Church of Satan even said, hey, keep us out of this.
[1:02:34.660 --> 1:02:39.660]  This is an ISIS thing. There's nothing about us involved in this.
[1:02:39.660 --> 1:02:44.660]  So what they do is Hollywood teaches ISIS how to do propaganda videos.
[1:02:44.660 --> 1:02:49.660]  And then all these guys like that, you know, 35-year-old loser never done anything.
[1:02:49.660 --> 1:02:53.660]  You know, can't meet girls, can't do anything. He thinks, wow, I'll go be a hero.
[1:02:53.660 --> 1:02:57.660]  I'm going to go live this cool life because he has nothing else going on in his life
[1:02:57.660 --> 1:03:02.660]  because none of us, I mean, if you think about it, none of us want to kill anybody
[1:03:02.660 --> 1:03:04.660]  because we're not homicidal, first of all.
[1:03:04.660 --> 1:03:09.660]  But moreover, you have a wife, you have kids, you have children, you have friends,
[1:03:09.660 --> 1:03:13.660]  you have family, you have community, you have culture, you have info warriors.
[1:03:13.660 --> 1:03:15.660]  Why would anybody want to lose that?
[1:03:15.660 --> 1:03:17.660]  You want to live, I want to live a long time. I want to live forever.
[1:03:17.660 --> 1:03:20.660]  I don't want to, you know, blow myself up or hurt somebody.
[1:03:20.660 --> 1:03:23.660]  Exactly. I want to live to 120 and meet my great-great-grandchildren
[1:03:23.660 --> 1:03:27.660]  and, you know, see space colonies and everything else.
[1:03:27.660 --> 1:03:31.660]  Exactly right. And we want to do positive things for the world.
[1:03:31.660 --> 1:03:33.660]  But we're not the market for ISIS.
[1:03:33.660 --> 1:03:40.660]  The market for ISIS are these loser beta-drags who have no masculinity.
[1:03:40.660 --> 1:03:42.660]  A lot of them are male feminists.
[1:03:42.660 --> 1:03:46.660]  There's actually a guy, I believe in Seattle, who is an online male feminist activist
[1:03:46.660 --> 1:03:51.660]  who was just arrested for killing his ex-girlfriend or something like that.
[1:03:51.660 --> 1:03:57.660]  So male feminists have a very high degree of sexual predation and of murder.
[1:03:57.660 --> 1:04:02.660]  So Hollywood, again, is teaching ISIS how to run propaganda films.
[1:04:02.660 --> 1:04:07.660]  And then by having Kathy Griffin hold that head with all the blood on it,
[1:04:07.660 --> 1:04:10.660]  that was their way of saying, we agree with ISIS.
[1:04:10.660 --> 1:04:14.660]  And of course, the fake news media, CNN has not fired Kathy Griffin,
[1:04:14.660 --> 1:04:18.660]  which tells me that CNN therefore supports ISIS.
[1:04:18.660 --> 1:04:21.660]  I can't reach any other conclusion, do you?
[1:04:21.660 --> 1:04:22.660]  You're absolutely right.
[1:04:22.660 --> 1:04:26.660]  And it's even come out in mainstream news that white helmets assisted
[1:04:26.660 --> 1:04:29.660]  public health executions in rebel Syria.
[1:04:29.660 --> 1:04:32.660]  So the white helmet folks are basically an al-Qaeda jihad force.
[1:04:32.660 --> 1:04:35.660]  I can't believe Salon even told the truth about that, but there it is.
[1:04:35.660 --> 1:04:37.660]  Do a few more minutes with us.
[1:04:37.660 --> 1:04:40.660]  I've got Roger Stone here, but I'm going to war-plan with you some more
[1:04:40.660 --> 1:04:42.660]  because I meant to start the show with what you just said, Sernovich,
[1:04:42.660 --> 1:04:45.660]  that this is the left's love of radical Islam.
[1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:48.660]  They're owed to it. They're obsession with it.
[1:04:48.660 --> 1:04:53.660]  The women wearing the hijabs, the U.S. today saying women are wearing the hijab
[1:04:53.660 --> 1:04:56.660]  as this act of solidarity and feminism against Trump.
[1:04:56.660 --> 1:05:24.660]  We're going to throw up. We'll be back.
[1:05:24.660 --> 1:05:35.660]  Now one of the migrants is seen holding a stuffed blue smurf toy
[1:05:35.660 --> 1:05:40.660]  that he had just stolen from the memorial.
[1:05:40.660 --> 1:05:44.660]  Now in case you missed that, the man from Manchester told the Muslim migrants,
[1:05:44.660 --> 1:05:47.660]  I'll knock this out of the pair of you,
[1:05:47.660 --> 1:05:52.660]  proof that not all of the citizens of Manchester are liberal cucks.
[1:05:52.660 --> 1:05:59.660]  And you can watch the video in its entirety right now at Infowars.com.

[1:06:59.660 --> 1:07:01.660]  Emdix Essentials, that's my middle name.
[1:07:01.660 --> 1:07:07.660]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand
[1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:10.660]  that's already trusted to let us private label
[1:07:10.660 --> 1:07:14.660]  an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[1:07:14.660 --> 1:07:19.660]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country
[1:07:19.660 --> 1:07:23.660]  that puts out high quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[1:07:23.660 --> 1:07:27.660]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[1:07:27.660 --> 1:07:30.660]  It is an answer to prayer and because we're cutting out the middleman,

[1:08:25.660 --> 1:08:27.660]  Well-disguised.
[1:08:27.660 --> 1:08:31.660]  I had to leave my life behind.
[1:08:31.660 --> 1:08:36.660]  I dug some graves you'll never find.
[1:08:36.660 --> 1:08:40.660]  The story's told with facts and lies.
[1:08:40.660 --> 1:08:45.660]  I had a name, but never mind.
[1:08:45.660 --> 1:08:49.660]  Never mind, never mind.
[1:08:49.660 --> 1:08:51.660]  The war was lost.
[1:08:51.660 --> 1:08:54.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left is now openly embracing Islam.
[1:08:54.660 --> 1:08:59.660]  Kathy Griffin though has gone too far, simulating an ISIS beheading of the president
[1:08:59.660 --> 1:09:05.660]  as ISIS itself is encouraged by MSN and by MSNBC
[1:09:05.660 --> 1:09:08.660]  to attack Trump towers with truck bombs.
[1:09:08.660 --> 1:09:11.660]  We have the video. They are openly terrorist.
[1:09:11.660 --> 1:09:15.660]  Here's a clip of some of the scumbags calling for Trump's death.
[1:09:15.660 --> 1:09:18.660]  His wife said, well, he's a tough guy. He's not a tough guy.
[1:09:18.660 --> 1:09:22.660]  He's a bully and he's a bitch and he can suck my f***ing f***ing.
[1:09:22.660 --> 1:09:25.660]  I'll meet him in the hotel room any other f***ing day of the week
[1:09:25.660 --> 1:09:27.660]  and give him a Louisville slugger.
[1:09:27.660 --> 1:09:29.660]  Kiss my mother f***ing ass.
[1:09:29.660 --> 1:09:31.660]  That's white trash right there.
[1:09:31.660 --> 1:09:33.660]  That is white trash.
[1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:35.660]  Yes, I'm angry.
[1:09:35.660 --> 1:09:36.660]  There's more trash.
[1:09:36.660 --> 1:09:37.660]  Yes.
[1:09:37.660 --> 1:09:38.660]  Yes, I hate the last.
[1:09:38.660 --> 1:09:39.660]  I am outraged.
[1:09:39.660 --> 1:09:41.660]  Yes, I'm an evil person.
[1:09:41.660 --> 1:09:47.660]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:53.660]  You thought a lot about sending your ass to Saudi Arabia.
[1:09:53.660 --> 1:09:56.660]  Look at Snoop. He's so tough.
[1:09:56.660 --> 1:09:58.660]  Simulates killing President Trump.
[1:09:58.660 --> 1:10:01.660]  Oh, he's so tough.
[1:10:01.660 --> 1:10:05.660]  Now they want to kick the Civil War off
[1:10:05.660 --> 1:10:09.660]  through the Open Society Institute that works to overthrow
[1:10:09.660 --> 1:10:13.660]  elected governments all over the world like Ukraine.
[1:10:13.660 --> 1:10:17.660]  George Soros, of course, is involved.
[1:10:17.660 --> 1:10:19.660]  So why are they so upset about Kathy Griffin now?
[1:10:19.660 --> 1:10:22.660]  Roger Stone, Sierra Leone, and some final comments from Mike Cernovich.
[1:10:22.660 --> 1:10:24.660]  You've got some big breaking news.
[1:10:24.660 --> 1:10:28.660]  We have launched a giant $200,000 contest just to add excitement.
[1:10:28.660 --> 1:10:32.660]  $1,000 if you get in for wars.com and the fact that mainstream media
[1:10:32.660 --> 1:10:36.660]  is a terroristic organization, not just CNN.
[1:10:36.660 --> 1:10:38.660]  It could be CNN, MSNBC, I don't care.
[1:10:38.660 --> 1:10:43.660]  Kathy Griffin hopefully can be in it with the severed head of Trump.
[1:10:43.660 --> 1:10:47.660]  $1,000 each time you do it. $2,500.
[1:10:47.660 --> 1:10:49.660]  A couple people won repeatedly. One guy won three times.
[1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:52.660]  If you get in for wars.com out three or four times,
[1:10:52.660 --> 1:10:55.660]  along with their terrorist media, their fake news,
[1:10:55.660 --> 1:10:57.660]  their enemies of the American people.
[1:10:57.660 --> 1:11:00.660]  But Mike Cernovich says something so key.
[1:11:00.660 --> 1:11:04.660]  He was pointing out earlier that this is their ode to Islam.
[1:11:04.660 --> 1:11:06.660]  You have them wearing the hijabs.
[1:11:06.660 --> 1:11:10.660]  You have them at the rallies I saw in DC handing out thousands of hijabs.
[1:11:10.660 --> 1:11:12.660]  The Soros lady that's being funded is an Islamist
[1:11:12.660 --> 1:11:15.660]  who is for sexual mutilization of women.
[1:11:15.660 --> 1:11:19.660]  You've got this obsession with the left everywhere saying kill Trump supporters,
[1:11:19.660 --> 1:11:21.660]  kill Trump's family.
[1:11:21.660 --> 1:11:25.660]  But why now suddenly are they turning on Kathy Griffin
[1:11:25.660 --> 1:11:27.660]  and saying, oh my God, she's in trouble.
[1:11:27.660 --> 1:11:31.660]  And finally, USA Today saying it's wrong and CNN, but not firing her.
[1:11:31.660 --> 1:11:34.660]  Because they're getting ready for the riots and the violence in July
[1:11:34.660 --> 1:11:36.660]  they've been planning publicly.
[1:11:36.660 --> 1:11:38.660]  And they want to now pull back a little bit from the explosion.
[1:11:38.660 --> 1:11:41.660]  This is simply, you know, they've laid the explosives.
[1:11:41.660 --> 1:11:45.660]  They're now evacuating back, you know, posing in my opinion.
[1:11:45.660 --> 1:11:47.660]  What do you think, Mike Cernovich?
[1:11:47.660 --> 1:11:50.660]  Yeah, they definitely realized that they went too far.
[1:11:50.660 --> 1:11:54.660]  All CNN, if CNN had really cared about this, I mean, think about it.
[1:11:54.660 --> 1:11:58.660]  If I did an image of that like that, Alex, you like text me about like,
[1:11:58.660 --> 1:12:00.660]  hey, Cernovich, you got to go do your own thing.
[1:12:00.660 --> 1:12:02.660]  And that's just the way it's going to be.
[1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:05.660]  We don't need to wait 50,000 hours like CNN did.
[1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:07.660]  And then say, well, we're still going to keep her on CNN,
[1:12:07.660 --> 1:12:08.660]  but we're going to evaluate it.
[1:12:08.660 --> 1:12:10.660]  I hope it blows over.
[1:12:10.660 --> 1:12:16.660]  So what happened is Kathy Griffin showed their hand that we can no longer
[1:12:16.660 --> 1:12:20.660]  deny it because Roger Stone, you, others, we have long said
[1:12:20.660 --> 1:12:22.660]  that the media is inciting violence.
[1:12:22.660 --> 1:12:26.660]  And it was shot in that super HD color just like the ISIS videos
[1:12:26.660 --> 1:12:28.660]  and people subconsciously it's now come out.
[1:12:28.660 --> 1:12:30.660]  Hollywood helped produce a lot of those.
[1:12:30.660 --> 1:12:34.660]  Emma was behind ISIS, the Arab Spring, the globalist George Soros.
[1:12:34.660 --> 1:12:38.660]  This is all come out that the white hats are executing people are really al-Qaeda.
[1:12:38.660 --> 1:12:39.660]  That's mainstream news.
[1:12:39.660 --> 1:12:43.660]  So it's all people those subconsciously went, I've seen that same super
[1:12:43.660 --> 1:12:46.660]  35 millimeter glossy look before.
[1:12:46.660 --> 1:12:47.660]  Exactly.
[1:12:47.660 --> 1:12:49.660]  So they went too far too fast.
[1:12:49.660 --> 1:12:50.660]  But you know what?
[1:12:50.660 --> 1:12:53.660]  The Patriots are waking up and that is why this contest is so important.
[1:12:53.660 --> 1:12:55.660]  That is our counter strike.
[1:12:55.660 --> 1:12:57.660]  They're committing terrorism on us.
[1:12:57.660 --> 1:12:59.660]  They want everybody here listening to die.
[1:12:59.660 --> 1:13:00.660]  They want you murdered.
[1:13:00.660 --> 1:13:02.660]  They want your children kidnapped.
[1:13:02.660 --> 1:13:05.660]  They, the media, if they could push a button right now and kill all of your
[1:13:05.660 --> 1:13:07.660]  children, they wouldn't a second.
[1:13:07.660 --> 1:13:08.660]  They hate us.
[1:13:08.660 --> 1:13:09.660]  They hate us.
[1:13:09.660 --> 1:13:11.660]  By the way, Cernovich isn't just saying this.
[1:13:11.660 --> 1:13:17.660]  The leftist are mentally ill people, losers scum and sociopathic and psychopathic elites.
[1:13:17.660 --> 1:13:18.660]  They want total conquering.
[1:13:18.660 --> 1:13:21.660]  They see us as schmucks that want open free societies.
[1:13:21.660 --> 1:13:25.660]  They see us as jokes that actually care about free market and actually care
[1:13:25.660 --> 1:13:26.660]  about people's freedoms.
[1:13:26.660 --> 1:13:30.660]  They are allied with authoritarianism because they worship at the dark
[1:13:30.660 --> 1:13:31.660]  idol of tyranny.
[1:13:31.660 --> 1:13:33.660]  This is a historic fact.
[1:13:33.660 --> 1:13:38.660]  But they want a war, cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war.
[1:13:38.660 --> 1:13:40.660]  They want to kill our republic.
[1:13:40.660 --> 1:13:46.660]  Well, the ghost of our king, Jesus, is now ravenously walking, you know,
[1:13:46.660 --> 1:13:50.660]  the battlefields of the mind and they have sown the wind.
[1:13:50.660 --> 1:13:53.660]  They are now reaping the world wind politically.
[1:13:53.660 --> 1:13:59.660]  They hope for violence because they are intellectually losing the war of ideas
[1:13:59.660 --> 1:14:00.660]  with us.
[1:14:00.660 --> 1:14:01.660]  Mike Cernovich, incredible job.
[1:14:01.660 --> 1:14:03.660]  Great idea with this contest.
[1:14:03.660 --> 1:14:04.660]  You're going to be a big part of it.
[1:14:04.660 --> 1:14:05.660]  Thank you so much.
[1:14:05.660 --> 1:14:06.660]  Thank you.
[1:14:06.660 --> 1:14:10.660]  And just to emphasize your point, all that pro-pedophilia stuff comes to the
[1:14:10.660 --> 1:14:11.660]  left too.
[1:14:11.660 --> 1:14:16.660]  Pro-pedophilia, pro-terrorism, pro-broken homes, attacking the family.
[1:14:16.660 --> 1:14:19.660]  We can now declare the left is a death cult.
[1:14:19.660 --> 1:14:20.660]  This is 100% fact.
[1:14:20.660 --> 1:14:21.660]  They worship death.
[1:14:21.660 --> 1:14:22.660]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:14:22.660 --> 1:14:23.660]  Absolutely.
[1:14:23.660 --> 1:14:25.660]  That's why they're alive with ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[1:14:25.660 --> 1:14:26.660]  That isn't rhetoric.
[1:14:26.660 --> 1:14:28.660]  We're going to get into your big breaking news, Roger.
[1:14:28.660 --> 1:14:32.660]  But wow, what do you make of this iconic image of the president in this video in HD
[1:14:32.660 --> 1:14:37.660]  having his head cut off, looked real, scared barren, the classic ISIS image?
[1:14:37.660 --> 1:14:41.660]  You know, we've got the left saying kill him everywhere, getting away with it.
[1:14:41.660 --> 1:14:43.660]  Why suddenly has it hit such a chord?
[1:14:43.660 --> 1:14:45.660]  I think this signifies a major tipping point.
[1:14:45.660 --> 1:14:49.660]  I told you last week on the phone, I said, I think these attacks on Trump are bouncing
[1:14:49.660 --> 1:14:50.660]  off.
[1:14:50.660 --> 1:14:52.660]  I think the public is now not buying any of it.
[1:14:52.660 --> 1:14:57.660]  I think it's now, he had a saturation point where it's beyond fatigue, where it's torture
[1:14:57.660 --> 1:15:02.660]  and I believe their terrorization of the public is now backfiring.
[1:15:02.660 --> 1:15:05.660]  Alex, this is nothing short of sick.
[1:15:05.660 --> 1:15:09.660]  I mean, in Hollywood, this is how you revive a flagging career.
[1:15:09.660 --> 1:15:10.660]  This woman was going nowhere.
[1:15:10.660 --> 1:15:13.660]  She couldn't get her name in the newspaper.
[1:15:13.660 --> 1:15:15.660]  She couldn't get in the media.
[1:15:15.660 --> 1:15:17.660]  So she pulls a stunt like this.
[1:15:17.660 --> 1:15:20.660]  We'd like to think that this is a career ender.
[1:15:20.660 --> 1:15:24.660]  We'd like to think that the left will now censure her, but they won't.
[1:15:24.660 --> 1:15:28.660]  This is actually, sadly, reflagged her career.
[1:15:28.660 --> 1:15:34.660]  She's all over the news today and that's what they sought to do, incite violence, disrespect
[1:15:34.660 --> 1:15:39.660]  and undermine the president of the United States with these kind of violent images.
[1:15:39.660 --> 1:15:44.660]  This just shows you how sick Hollywood has become, how sick the Hollywood New York access
[1:15:44.660 --> 1:15:45.660]  has come.
[1:15:45.660 --> 1:15:49.660]  Yesterday, we had Rick Derringer, the rock legend with us.
[1:15:49.660 --> 1:15:56.660]  He and his wife discussed about how they have been snubbed and insulted and abused over
[1:15:56.660 --> 1:16:02.660]  their support for Donald Trump by the Hollywood Left, by the entertainment industry.
[1:16:02.660 --> 1:16:07.660]  Instead, you get freaks like this getting incredible coverage.
[1:16:07.660 --> 1:16:08.660]  Absolutely.
[1:16:08.660 --> 1:16:09.660]  And it's been in the news.
[1:16:09.660 --> 1:16:12.660]  I heard about it years ago, but I've had top producers visit me.
[1:16:12.660 --> 1:16:16.660]  I mean, guys that put on shows on television that have budgets of $150 million.
[1:16:16.660 --> 1:16:19.660]  I mean, people bigger than Chris Carter.
[1:16:19.660 --> 1:16:21.660]  I'll just leave it at that.
[1:16:21.660 --> 1:16:26.660]  And they're in secret societies and have secret conservative libertarian meetings in L.A.
[1:16:26.660 --> 1:16:27.660]  and Houston and other places.
[1:16:27.660 --> 1:16:28.660]  I've been invited to them.
[1:16:28.660 --> 1:16:29.660]  I said, yeah, sure.
[1:16:29.660 --> 1:16:30.660]  Maybe sometime I'm pretty busy.
[1:16:30.660 --> 1:16:31.660]  I'm not snubbing them.
[1:16:31.660 --> 1:16:34.660]  I just don't have time to go to secret, you know, right wing meetings or whatever.
[1:16:34.660 --> 1:16:41.660]  But it just shows how crazy this country has gotten that people have that have made hundreds
[1:16:41.660 --> 1:16:44.660]  of millions of dollars and they're not even conservative.
[1:16:44.660 --> 1:16:48.660]  They're just libertarian like Kurt Russell is one of the few guys that said, look, I
[1:16:48.660 --> 1:16:49.660]  like George Washington.
[1:16:49.660 --> 1:16:50.660]  I like America.
[1:16:50.660 --> 1:16:51.660]  I like freedom.
[1:16:51.660 --> 1:16:52.660]  I'm not liberal.
[1:16:52.660 --> 1:16:54.660]  I'm not conservative, but I'm not allowed to be who I am.
[1:16:54.660 --> 1:16:56.660]  They call me a right winger and I'm sick of it.
[1:16:56.660 --> 1:16:58.660]  And the second amendment is a good thing.
[1:16:58.660 --> 1:17:02.660]  All these rich Hollywood people have bodyguards, but then they don't want the public to have
[1:17:02.660 --> 1:17:03.660]  it.
[1:17:03.660 --> 1:17:04.660]  It's a load of crap.
[1:17:04.660 --> 1:17:05.660]  And they tried to get him in trouble.
[1:17:05.660 --> 1:17:09.660]  I mean, the truth is most people in Hollywood are libertarians.
[1:17:09.660 --> 1:17:13.660]  It's the big producers and the Democratic Party that run it and use it for propaganda
[1:17:13.660 --> 1:17:17.660]  that threaten them with their jobs if they don't stay on the plantation.
[1:17:17.660 --> 1:17:23.660]  The most incredible thing about this, I think Alex is what happened to the Democratic Party
[1:17:23.660 --> 1:17:25.660]  of John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman?
[1:17:25.660 --> 1:17:28.660]  What happened to the patriotic liberal Democrats?
[1:17:28.660 --> 1:17:35.660]  The Democrats now nationally seem to be a rollover for radical Islam for any politically
[1:17:35.660 --> 1:17:37.660]  correct meme that comes along.
[1:17:37.660 --> 1:17:39.660]  They are no longer patriotic.
[1:17:39.660 --> 1:17:41.660]  They are no longer pro-hard work.
[1:17:41.660 --> 1:17:43.660]  They're no longer pro-middle class.
[1:17:43.660 --> 1:17:46.660]  What happened to that Democratic Party?
[1:17:46.660 --> 1:17:51.660]  It's evaporated under the leadership of Barack Obama and the Clintons.
[1:17:51.660 --> 1:17:52.660]  It's a disgrace.
[1:17:52.660 --> 1:17:53.660]  And let's be clear.
[1:17:53.660 --> 1:17:55.660]  When you're saying this, this is not political rhetoric.
[1:17:55.660 --> 1:18:02.660]  They are literally the party of revolution, death, Islam, Satanism, having trannies teach
[1:18:02.660 --> 1:18:04.660]  three-year-olds, how to have sex.
[1:18:04.660 --> 1:18:06.660]  I mean, it's just, you see the stuff.
[1:18:06.660 --> 1:18:10.660]  It's so over the top, they're like the party of mental illness.
[1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:18.660]  It's almost hard to fathom because I don't see the political viability of their point of view.
[1:18:18.660 --> 1:18:27.660]  I mean, what voter would vote for their kind of weak-need, pasty-faced, left-wing,
[1:18:27.660 --> 1:18:31.660]  rolling over for people who want to destroy our democracy?
[1:18:31.660 --> 1:18:32.660]  And by the way, I'd call you a libertarian.
[1:18:32.660 --> 1:18:33.660]  I mean, you're for gay rights.
[1:18:33.660 --> 1:18:35.660]  You've gone to gay pride parades.
[1:18:35.660 --> 1:18:36.660]  You're for marijuana legalization.
[1:18:36.660 --> 1:18:39.660]  I mean, but you still want lower taxes in a strong country.
[1:18:39.660 --> 1:18:40.660]  Well, I'm a patriot.
[1:18:40.660 --> 1:18:43.660]  I believe in maximum personal freedom.
[1:18:43.660 --> 1:18:46.660]  I don't want the government in my bedroom or the boardroom.
[1:18:46.660 --> 1:18:52.660]  Well, that's what I'm getting at here is the left is just a screaming cult that wants to make us take their sexual preference,
[1:18:52.660 --> 1:18:56.660]  that wants to make us live like they say, that wants to tell us what words to use,
[1:18:56.660 --> 1:19:02.660]  and then they're allied with the most monotheistic, chauvinistic, oppressive death cult.
[1:19:02.660 --> 1:19:04.660]  I mean, what is their problem?
[1:19:04.660 --> 1:19:13.660]  You know, it's very hard to understand where the constituency is among voters in the Democratic Party for what they're peddling.
[1:19:13.660 --> 1:19:14.660]  This is why the-
[1:19:14.660 --> 1:19:16.660]  Yeah, Trump's promoting prosperity and he's delivering it.
[1:19:16.660 --> 1:19:17.660]  They're pissed.
[1:19:17.660 --> 1:19:20.660]  But this is why the Trump Democrat is now important.
[1:19:20.660 --> 1:19:26.660]  The Trump Democrat who swung Wisconsin, who swung Michigan, who swung Pennsylvania.
[1:19:26.660 --> 1:19:37.660]  This is, I think, the makings of an entire political realignment where you have a new coalition of traditional Republicans,
[1:19:37.660 --> 1:19:44.660]  libertarians, and right thinking, working class, patriotic, hardworking union member, Democrats.
[1:19:44.660 --> 1:19:47.660]  We're talking about survival commonsense party.
[1:19:47.660 --> 1:19:51.660]  I mean, the anti-suicide party, the anti-national suicide party,

[1:24:03.660 --> 1:24:06.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody knows that I come in here some day and do pretty calm shows,
[1:24:06.660 --> 1:24:09.660]  and I only get excited when stuff's really hardcore.
[1:24:09.660 --> 1:24:11.660]  They are planning massive riots this summer.
[1:24:11.660 --> 1:24:12.660]  I'm going to get more into that later.
[1:24:12.660 --> 1:24:13.660]  I'll put the phones up.
[1:24:13.660 --> 1:24:15.660]  Rodgers, Rodgers, I'll get one of this into the next hour.
[1:24:15.660 --> 1:24:17.660]  Other guests are joining us as well.
[1:24:17.660 --> 1:24:19.660]  You've got so much geopolitical news.
[1:24:19.660 --> 1:24:22.660]  Trump is really trying to get tax cuts through Congress.
[1:24:22.660 --> 1:24:24.660]  He's really trying to repeal Obamacare.
[1:24:24.660 --> 1:24:27.660]  He's really trying to kick the globalist out and get small business loans going.
[1:24:27.660 --> 1:24:30.660]  And they're really running around saying, kill him.
[1:24:30.660 --> 1:24:36.660]  But Rodgers Stone has exclusive inside intel that he's breaking right now.
[1:24:36.660 --> 1:24:40.660]  He doesn't want to be positive about Trump, but it's so complex.
[1:24:40.660 --> 1:24:43.660]  Even with a company with 70 employees, I don't know what a lot of them are doing sometimes.
[1:24:43.660 --> 1:24:45.660]  They're great people, but we've had some moles.
[1:24:45.660 --> 1:24:47.660]  We've had some problems before.
[1:24:47.660 --> 1:24:49.660]  Everybody's experienced that, who's had a lot of people under him.
[1:24:49.660 --> 1:24:51.660]  Trump's got thousands of people under him.
[1:24:51.660 --> 1:24:58.660]  He's got a major Soros mole discovered in the White House, breaking now, Rodgers Stone.
[1:24:58.660 --> 1:25:04.660]  Alex, this is really hard to believe, but I confirmed the facts again this morning.
[1:25:04.660 --> 1:25:08.660]  George Soros has penetrated the Trump White House.
[1:25:08.660 --> 1:25:15.660]  Soros has planted a mole infiltrating the National Security Apparatus.
[1:25:15.660 --> 1:25:24.660]  A woman named Fiona Hill, who has a Harvard background, has been on the Soros payroll
[1:25:24.660 --> 1:25:32.660]  and the payroll of the Open Society Institute, has been brought into the Trump White House by General McMaster.
[1:25:32.660 --> 1:25:42.660]  The reason this is significant is because, as you know, the Hungarian government has been fighting the Open Society Institute,
[1:25:42.660 --> 1:25:48.660]  which is a front in Hungary to destabilize the Hungarian government.
[1:25:48.660 --> 1:25:52.660]  And we should add, they are patriot right-wingers that are pro-Trump, pro-Ron Paul.
[1:25:52.660 --> 1:25:54.660]  They just don't like Islamic invasion.
[1:25:54.660 --> 1:26:05.660]  And I am told from the best possible sources in the Trump White House that only days ago in a showdown meeting,
[1:26:05.660 --> 1:26:14.660]  this woman, Fiona Hill, now on the National Security staff, argued that she was a Russian expert
[1:26:14.660 --> 1:26:24.660]  and that the Trump administration must oppose the Hungarian efforts to crack down and expose on the so-called Open Society Institute.
[1:26:24.660 --> 1:26:26.660]  That's the group that overthrew Ukraine.
[1:26:26.660 --> 1:26:28.660]  That's the group that was openly behind the Arab Spring.
[1:26:28.660 --> 1:26:30.660]  That's the group openly behind ending the Free Press here.
[1:26:30.660 --> 1:26:35.660]  That's the group openly behind funding the Cop Killer Black Lives Matter groups
[1:26:35.660 --> 1:26:40.660]  and literally funding the groups chanting, you know, kill the cops, deck the hall with dead cops.
[1:26:40.660 --> 1:26:43.660]  Why would anyone put up with this load of baloney?
[1:26:43.660 --> 1:26:48.660]  And why would anyone have a woman with this background?
[1:26:48.660 --> 1:26:54.660]  Brookings Institute, Harvard, George Soros, Open Society in the Trump White House.
[1:26:54.660 --> 1:26:57.660]  This defies all reason.
[1:26:57.660 --> 1:27:01.660]  Now, my sources tell me that McMaster brought her in.
[1:27:01.660 --> 1:27:08.660]  My sources tell me that she is now asserting herself claiming to be a Russian expert
[1:27:08.660 --> 1:27:16.660]  and is outraged that the Trump administration would consider joining the Hungarian government and opposing the Open Society Institute.
[1:27:16.660 --> 1:27:18.660]  And let's expand on this.
[1:27:18.660 --> 1:27:25.660]  Next, we're going to hear, when Trump tried to block the Russian expert, was he obstructing justice and aiding the Russians?
[1:27:25.660 --> 1:27:26.660]  That'll be next.
[1:27:26.660 --> 1:27:32.660]  In this load of manure, if you don't support George Soros letting the Muslims in to Eastern Europe
[1:27:32.660 --> 1:27:38.660]  where they've been overrun more than anybody for 1400 years, Eastern Europe, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:27:38.660 --> 1:27:42.660]  are the ones that stopped the Islamic invasions over and over again.
[1:27:42.660 --> 1:27:49.660]  We owe our very existence to Hungary and Romania and Poland in places like that,
[1:27:49.660 --> 1:27:53.660]  who stopped the Muslims' invasions more than 75 times.
[1:27:53.660 --> 1:27:58.660]  It cost millions of European lives battling these people.
[1:27:58.660 --> 1:28:02.660]  Well, Alex, as you know, I am of Hungarian descent.
[1:28:02.660 --> 1:28:03.660]  This strikes home.
[1:28:03.660 --> 1:28:09.660]  The fact that people accuse me of being in bed with the Russians, let's be very clear.
[1:28:09.660 --> 1:28:16.660]  The Russians crushed my family members in the 1956 revolution, the 1956 revolt.
[1:28:16.660 --> 1:28:20.660]  So it is anathema to me, this idea that I...
[1:28:20.660 --> 1:28:22.660]  But you've always been a famous anti-communist.
[1:28:22.660 --> 1:28:24.660]  You helped round a bunch up in the 80s.
[1:28:24.660 --> 1:28:26.660]  But let's be very clear.
[1:28:26.660 --> 1:28:29.660]  What is happening to Carter Page is exactly what is happening to me.
[1:28:29.660 --> 1:28:32.660]  This morning it was revealed by the president of the United States
[1:28:32.660 --> 1:28:38.660]  that the House Intelligence Committee is stalling on the testimony of Mr. Page.
[1:28:38.660 --> 1:28:42.660]  That's because they have nothing, not a buff kiss.
[1:28:42.660 --> 1:28:44.660]  And they won't release the memo?
[1:28:44.660 --> 1:28:47.660]  The memo's fake and Comey said there was no obstruction.
[1:28:47.660 --> 1:28:49.660]  They're caught red-handed.
[1:28:49.660 --> 1:28:53.660]  And former chairman of the committee, Nunes, said this morning
[1:28:53.660 --> 1:28:58.660]  that the committee has not called and not interviewed a single witness.
[1:28:58.660 --> 1:29:02.660]  They're in slow-mo here because they know they have nothing.
[1:29:02.660 --> 1:29:09.660]  And that gutless, pasty-faced, wimpy Adam Schiff from California
[1:29:09.660 --> 1:29:13.660]  does not have the cojones to face me in a public court.
[1:29:13.660 --> 1:29:16.660]  And that's why for what, seven months they've been saying they're going to call you,
[1:29:16.660 --> 1:29:18.660]  but they never call you to these bozo hearings.
[1:29:18.660 --> 1:29:21.660]  They just attack you in abstention when you're not there.
[1:29:21.660 --> 1:29:24.660]  Why don't they bring a pinata in and then have like a recorder saying,
[1:29:24.660 --> 1:29:27.660]  I'm Roger Stone, I'm guilty, I'm a risky, I'm a Comey.
[1:29:27.660 --> 1:29:30.660]  But what they've proposed is a closed session,
[1:29:30.660 --> 1:29:34.660]  two members from both parties, no transcript, unacceptable
[1:29:34.660 --> 1:29:36.660]  because they will misrepresent.
[1:29:36.660 --> 1:29:39.660]  They will leak BS just like the Comey memo that does...
[1:29:39.660 --> 1:29:41.660]  Why do you think they won't release it? Doesn't exist?
[1:29:41.660 --> 1:29:43.660]  Doesn't exist. There is no Comey memo.
[1:29:43.660 --> 1:29:45.660]  You said that back in the time. That's why Trump said,
[1:29:45.660 --> 1:29:48.660]  be careful, I got your ass on tape, you little scumbag.
[1:29:48.660 --> 1:29:50.660]  We're on the march.
[1:29:50.660 --> 1:29:52.660]  Clinton operative? Yeah.
[1:29:52.660 --> 1:30:21.660]  America's fighting back now. Get ready scum.
[1:30:22.660 --> 1:30:35.660]  Now, one of the migrants is seen holding a stuffed blue Smurf toy
[1:30:35.660 --> 1:30:38.660]  that he had just stolen from the memorial.
[1:30:38.660 --> 1:30:40.660]  I'm not going to s**t out of the pair of you. How was that?
[1:30:40.660 --> 1:30:45.660]  Now, in case you missed that, the man from Manchester told the Muslim migrants,
[1:30:45.660 --> 1:30:47.660]  I'll knock this s**t out of the pair of you,
[1:30:47.660 --> 1:30:52.660]  proof that not all of the citizens of Manchester are liberal cucks.
[1:30:52.660 --> 1:31:21.660]  And you can watch the video in its entirety right now at infowars.com.
[1:31:21.660 --> 1:31:23.660]  Wow, thank you.

[1:31:32.660 --> 1:31:35.660]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.

[1:33:14.660 --> 1:33:19.660]  This has been a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order.
[1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:47.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pretty good at reading tea leaves
[1:33:47.660 --> 1:33:50.660]  and I know it's going to be successful and I know it's not.
[1:33:50.660 --> 1:33:54.660]  And I pretty much operate though off the energy in the country and the world
[1:33:54.660 --> 1:34:01.660]  and just what I analytically see, what I intellectually see, but what I feel at a gut level.
[1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:05.660]  And I've been feeling the last few months and seeing the globalists
[1:34:05.660 --> 1:34:10.660]  thrill everything they've got against America and against sovereign nations like Brazil
[1:34:10.660 --> 1:34:14.660]  and others that are trying to pull out of globalism, this unelected corporate government.
[1:34:14.660 --> 1:34:17.660]  Trump is killing TPP. He's killed it.
[1:34:17.660 --> 1:34:20.660]  He's killing after NGAT. He's renegotiating all this stuff.
[1:34:20.660 --> 1:34:22.660]  He's going there and literally when they try to block him,
[1:34:22.660 --> 1:34:25.660]  getting to the front podium, pushing past globalist minions.
[1:34:25.660 --> 1:34:30.660]  I mean, they are freaked out by somebody actually representing America,
[1:34:30.660 --> 1:34:33.660]  but more importantly, prosperity.
[1:34:33.660 --> 1:34:37.660]  And that's what the Renaissance is about, is getting out of stagnation.
[1:34:37.660 --> 1:34:39.660]  So that's why they're after Trump.
[1:34:39.660 --> 1:34:41.660]  We'll get more into the infiltration here in a moment.
[1:34:41.660 --> 1:34:49.660]  But they're coming after us because they know prosperity is out competing their authoritarian model.
[1:34:49.660 --> 1:34:56.660]  And that's why I have now energetically felt and seen in the last week their full will against us.
[1:34:56.660 --> 1:35:01.660]  I can like feel it being lifted back. It's still bad, but now it's more of panic.
[1:35:01.660 --> 1:35:02.660]  They don't know what to do.
[1:35:02.660 --> 1:35:06.660]  There are major power forces that are making more money than ever.
[1:35:06.660 --> 1:35:10.660]  And they're kind of saying, why are we trying to have austerity and make everybody poor to control them?
[1:35:10.660 --> 1:35:15.660]  When Trump's plan and the American system, that's all it is is a return of that.
[1:35:15.660 --> 1:35:16.660]  It's so much better.
[1:35:16.660 --> 1:35:20.660]  So the sexiness of America is just too sexy.
[1:35:20.660 --> 1:35:22.660]  People can't turn it down.
[1:35:22.660 --> 1:35:24.660]  And the return of it, they've tried to kill it.
[1:35:24.660 --> 1:35:25.660]  They tried to make it ugly.
[1:35:25.660 --> 1:35:29.660]  They tried to make the architecture ugly, the clothing ugly, everything ugly.
[1:35:29.660 --> 1:35:34.660]  That's been declassified to make you give up and not realize the incredible human potential you've got.
[1:35:34.660 --> 1:35:36.660]  And that's why they're panicking.
[1:35:36.660 --> 1:35:37.660]  Here's the news.
[1:35:37.660 --> 1:35:39.660]  We just retweeted it at real Alex Jones.
[1:35:39.660 --> 1:35:45.660]  CNN has terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year's Eve program.
[1:35:45.660 --> 1:35:46.660]  Oh, she'll be back.
[1:35:46.660 --> 1:35:50.660]  But the point is, will they terminate all their other reporters saying kill Trump?
[1:35:50.660 --> 1:35:51.660]  We'll go over some of those people.
[1:35:51.660 --> 1:35:58.660]  Will the guy at MSNBC saying, you know, please blow up Trump Tower, ISIS?
[1:35:58.660 --> 1:36:01.660]  I mean, will he get arrested because that's way worse than what she did.
[1:36:01.660 --> 1:36:02.660]  And I'm not defending her.
[1:36:02.660 --> 1:36:03.660]  I'm just pointing that out.
[1:36:03.660 --> 1:36:06.660]  So we're going to get to that more here in just a moment.
[1:36:06.660 --> 1:36:08.660]  But first off, we need funding.
[1:36:08.660 --> 1:36:12.660]  Let me tell you, if we get robust funding, you won't see $200,000 contest.
[1:36:12.660 --> 1:36:13.660]  You'll see million dollar contest.
[1:36:13.660 --> 1:36:16.660]  I'm building a half million dollar studio, which sounds like a lot.
[1:36:16.660 --> 1:36:17.660]  That's very inexpensive.
[1:36:17.660 --> 1:36:19.660]  A Fox studio is probably like 10 million.
[1:36:19.660 --> 1:36:21.660]  I'm building all sorts of stuff.
[1:36:21.660 --> 1:36:28.660]  Satellite up links, closed captioning, all the stuff you got to do to really launch a network.
[1:36:28.660 --> 1:36:30.660]  You've seen us expand over the years.
[1:36:30.660 --> 1:36:34.660]  We're really about to start running, not just walking.
[1:36:34.660 --> 1:36:35.660]  We've been growing.
[1:36:35.660 --> 1:36:36.660]  We had to build the structure.
[1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:37.660]  Now we're ready to explode.
[1:36:37.660 --> 1:36:41.660]  Every time I tell you that, we explode next level.
[1:36:41.660 --> 1:36:44.660]  And we exploded the next level, there'll be nothing as big.
[1:36:44.660 --> 1:36:45.660]  And it's not about being big though.
[1:36:45.660 --> 1:36:49.660]  It's about being able to take on the globalist at point blank range.
[1:36:49.660 --> 1:36:50.660]  Big fish eat little fish.
[1:36:50.660 --> 1:36:55.660]  I want to be as strong and as focused and as robust and as committed going into this fight.
[1:36:55.660 --> 1:36:58.660]  So please support info wars.
[1:36:58.660 --> 1:37:04.660]  The main way you do it is supporting our local radio stations, local advertisers.
[1:37:04.660 --> 1:37:07.660]  Sending them a check is smart as well.
[1:37:07.660 --> 1:37:09.660]  We're in an info war trying to shut talk radio down.
[1:37:09.660 --> 1:37:10.660]  That's so essential.
[1:37:10.660 --> 1:37:16.660]  Telling everybody about the station you listen to and then financially supporting info wars.com.
[1:37:16.660 --> 1:37:24.660]  And you do that by getting the new CNN terror shirt with Kathy Griffin on the cover with Trump's chopped off head.
[1:37:24.660 --> 1:37:29.660]  Just to point out that these people are absolutely committed to destroying free speech.
[1:37:29.660 --> 1:37:36.660]  You also, we were extending the Memorial Day mega specials are extended throughout this weekend.
[1:37:36.660 --> 1:37:38.660]  Free speech is now being censored across the web and independent.

[1:37:41.660 --> 1:37:44.660]  Help fund Patriot media and fight back against these attacks.
[1:37:44.660 --> 1:37:47.660]  We have extended our Memorial Day mega specials at infowarstore.com.

[1:38:31.660 --> 1:38:33.660]  Wear these shirts out in public.
[1:38:33.660 --> 1:38:36.660]  You will meet like minded people unless you're in San Francisco or Austin.
[1:38:36.660 --> 1:38:38.660]  You might get physically assaulted if you're in downtown Austin.
[1:38:38.660 --> 1:38:40.660]  But hey, that's what it's all about.
[1:38:40.660 --> 1:38:42.660]  Standing up for free speech.
[1:38:42.660 --> 1:38:44.660]  But if you wear an info or shirt, it's not as bad.
[1:38:44.660 --> 1:38:45.660]  You just meet like minded people.
[1:38:45.660 --> 1:38:51.660]  But if you wear a Kathy Griffin shirt, CNN terrorist people then resonate and understand it's MSM.
[1:38:51.660 --> 1:38:53.660]  That's what's really unpopular.
[1:38:53.660 --> 1:38:54.660]  That's what's really out of control.
[1:38:54.660 --> 1:38:55.660]  Then it's not even political.
[1:38:55.660 --> 1:38:59.660]  It's about understanding that the media is the enemy of the American people.
[1:38:59.660 --> 1:39:02.660]  And we've launched the new contest.
[1:39:02.660 --> 1:39:06.660]  Exposing the MSM terrorist organization.
[1:39:06.660 --> 1:39:08.660]  Operation exposed terrorist media.
[1:39:08.660 --> 1:39:09.660]  Infowars.com.
[1:39:09.660 --> 1:39:11.660]  Ford slash contest.
[1:39:11.660 --> 1:39:12.660]  Go to the front page.
[1:39:12.660 --> 1:39:14.660]  $200,000 cash rises.
[1:39:14.660 --> 1:39:22.660]  Infowars launches operation exposed terrorist media slash Kathy Griffin.
[1:39:22.660 --> 1:39:26.660]  And they really are terrorizing us, bullying us.
[1:39:26.660 --> 1:39:30.660]  Get on TV with CNN as ISIS or MSNBC as ISIS.
[1:39:30.660 --> 1:39:31.660]  I don't care.
[1:39:31.660 --> 1:39:32.660]  You get on there and you expose.
[1:39:32.660 --> 1:39:33.660]  They're the enemies.
[1:39:33.660 --> 1:39:34.660]  They're the fake news.
[1:39:34.660 --> 1:39:35.660]  You can be creative.
[1:39:35.660 --> 1:39:40.660]  $2,500 if you get infowars.com out repeatedly.
[1:39:40.660 --> 1:39:42.660]  We probably had to add repeatedly.
[1:39:42.660 --> 1:39:44.660]  These being a good clean on there.
[1:39:44.660 --> 1:39:49.660]  And $1,000 price for anyone seen with CNN is ISIS on the T-shirt.
[1:39:49.660 --> 1:39:51.660]  We should add to that infowars.com.
[1:39:51.660 --> 1:39:52.660]  We did all this this morning.
[1:39:52.660 --> 1:39:53.660]  Wrote this up this morning.
[1:39:53.660 --> 1:39:56.660]  So I'm doing this by the seat of my pants, but we need to be specific there.
[1:39:56.660 --> 1:40:00.660]  And again, I always reserve the right to refuse any of these.
[1:40:00.660 --> 1:40:05.660]  We need to add that at the bottom because it could be operatives or globals trying to do it to discredit us or something.
[1:40:05.660 --> 1:40:09.660]  So, but we paid out on all these before, but it's not about the money.
[1:40:09.660 --> 1:40:12.660]  It's about the excitement.
[1:40:12.660 --> 1:40:15.660]  It is about taking action.
[1:40:15.660 --> 1:40:17.660]  It is about changing the world.
[1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:20.660]  And it's about showing them there's more of us than them.
[1:40:20.660 --> 1:40:27.660]  And we're taking action with the iconic Bill Clinton rape shirt before we get into the other news that Roger Stone developed.
[1:40:27.660 --> 1:40:29.660]  And that was then worn on TV everywhere.
[1:40:29.660 --> 1:40:32.660]  Now that's part of the contest where one of our shirts you'll win.
[1:40:32.660 --> 1:40:33.660]  Get it on TV.
[1:40:33.660 --> 1:40:35.660]  But they'll take a week to get those out to you.
[1:40:35.660 --> 1:40:38.660]  Print off the prints we've got on the site.
[1:40:38.660 --> 1:40:40.660]  Make your own whatever it is.
[1:40:40.660 --> 1:40:46.660]  It can be creative as long as it exposes that the media are the terrorist, that the media are the enemy, that the media are fake news.
[1:40:46.660 --> 1:40:51.660]  It can be that too, with infowars.com added to it, you will win.
[1:40:51.660 --> 1:40:53.660]  We've got big posters ready.
[1:40:53.660 --> 1:40:56.660]  You can print them up, go to Kinko's or wherever, put them on poster board.
[1:40:56.660 --> 1:41:00.660]  You know, they got that phone board, so it's hard and absolutely dominate.
[1:41:00.660 --> 1:41:03.660]  You're a business owner.
[1:41:03.660 --> 1:41:06.660]  Any town out there you can call.
[1:41:06.660 --> 1:41:08.660]  They've got rolling billboards that drive around.
[1:41:08.660 --> 1:41:09.660]  They're not even that expensive.
[1:41:09.660 --> 1:41:10.660]  I've done it myself.
[1:41:10.660 --> 1:41:13.660]  Digital and others just pay to have that.
[1:41:13.660 --> 1:41:19.660]  Have it parked in front of the national fox or seeing in where they do their live shows.
[1:41:19.660 --> 1:41:21.660]  Have it pull in right as they're live.
[1:41:21.660 --> 1:41:23.660]  That's how you do it.
[1:41:23.660 --> 1:41:24.660]  It's not about the money.
[1:41:24.660 --> 1:41:25.660]  It's not about winning the money.
[1:41:25.660 --> 1:41:30.660]  I just offer $200,000 to show folks how committed I am and to make it fun.
[1:41:30.660 --> 1:41:35.660]  And then to have people on that are able to do this and recognize them on air and show people we're the power.
[1:41:35.660 --> 1:41:40.660]  And even if the globalists shut the internet off like they're talking about doing and trying to take the president out during martial law,
[1:41:40.660 --> 1:41:43.660]  we can hit the streets on live TV.
[1:41:43.660 --> 1:41:44.660]  We can hit the streets.
[1:41:44.660 --> 1:41:45.660]  Now do this legally and lawfully.
[1:41:45.660 --> 1:41:48.660]  But if martial law comes in, then the gloves come off in the info war.
[1:41:48.660 --> 1:41:50.660]  Now, Roger Stone, you've got the floor of the rest of the hour.
[1:41:50.660 --> 1:41:57.660]  I've been ranting, but can you talk about the Bill Clinton as a rapist contest and your Bill Clinton rape shirt that helped me think of the idea?
[1:41:57.660 --> 1:42:03.660]  Yeah, Alex, this I think is a graphic example of how effective these campaigns can be.
[1:42:03.660 --> 1:42:16.660]  We developed the iconic Bill Clinton rape t-shirt largely because there was a mainstream media blackout of the truth of Bill Clinton's long trail of sexual assaults and rapes of innocent women.
[1:42:16.660 --> 1:42:20.660]  The media wanted to call it indiscretions and infidelities.
[1:42:20.660 --> 1:42:23.660]  They tried desperately to downplay it.
[1:42:23.660 --> 1:42:27.660]  It was only Alex until you went out with a very similar contest.
[1:42:27.660 --> 1:42:38.660]  And you said anybody who will get this t-shirt on TV and get the words, Bill Clinton as a rapist out of their mouth will be rewarded.
[1:42:38.660 --> 1:42:44.660]  I remember you upped the total amount several times and it was like a prairie fire.
[1:42:44.660 --> 1:42:47.660]  It was about, I said 120, it was like 137,000 we paid out.
[1:42:47.660 --> 1:42:55.660]  And you paid out every penny and you could see it on local TV, you could see it on network TV, you could see it across the board.
[1:42:55.660 --> 1:42:56.660]  And people are still doing it.
[1:42:56.660 --> 1:42:57.660]  We tracked it.
[1:42:57.660 --> 1:42:59.660]  We tracked it and we broke through.
[1:42:59.660 --> 1:43:16.660]  The voters finally got the point that Bill Clinton was not only guilty of sexual assault, but more importantly that Hillary Clinton was the one who had bullied these women, who had threatened them, who had intimidated them into silence.
[1:43:16.660 --> 1:43:25.660]  It's a graphic example of how you can take action here at InfoWars and why this new contest will work in my opinion.
[1:43:25.660 --> 1:43:31.660]  I agree with Ben Garrison. She absolutely beheaded herself. She cut her own nose off here to spite her face.
[1:43:31.660 --> 1:43:32.660]  She'll be back.
[1:43:32.660 --> 1:43:34.660]  That's the sad thing about the lefties in Hollywood.
[1:43:34.660 --> 1:43:37.660]  This is a temporary interregnum.
[1:43:37.660 --> 1:43:38.660]  Wait and see.
[1:43:38.660 --> 1:43:48.660]  She'll make a comeback in three months and some Lib Lab producer, some Lib Lab network will hire her to spew her hatred yet again.
[1:43:48.660 --> 1:43:58.660]  Well, that's like these failed comedians that have these different shows on Netflix that they'll have almost no viewers.
[1:43:58.660 --> 1:44:00.660]  They'll have less than one star support.
[1:44:00.660 --> 1:44:09.660]  And so Netflix has just gotten rid of the stars on specific programs so people can't downvote them.
[1:44:09.660 --> 1:44:11.660]  That's like Amy Schumer.
[1:44:11.660 --> 1:44:21.660]  I mean, she is just this hateful, anti-male, anti-American dirtbag and they try to force-feed her as some new sex symbol we all have to bow down to.
[1:44:21.660 --> 1:44:22.660]  Yeah, it's pretty outrageous.
[1:44:22.660 --> 1:44:25.660]  The other thing I wanted to comment on, Alex, so I think you may have seen this.
[1:44:25.660 --> 1:44:27.660]  You heard it here first on InfoWars.
[1:44:27.660 --> 1:44:33.660]  On the view today, we begin putting forward the idea that Donald Trump has Alzheimer's.
[1:44:33.660 --> 1:44:35.660]  You said that two weeks ago in studio.
[1:44:35.660 --> 1:44:43.660]  That he's infirm, that he's mentally slipping, that he's confused. This is all BS.
[1:44:43.660 --> 1:44:51.660]  Ask the European leaders who completely mishandled the president on the question of the Paris climate accords.
[1:44:51.660 --> 1:44:59.660]  Trump is so sharp that when I've had conversations with him, he finishes my sentences and totally takes over the conversation.
[1:44:59.660 --> 1:45:01.660]  And it's like he's reading your mind.
[1:45:01.660 --> 1:45:04.660]  Well, Andy remembers your conversation from your previous.
[1:45:04.660 --> 1:45:09.660]  But I mean, he has the brain of like a super sharp 20-year-old. This is the most ridiculous branding.
[1:45:09.660 --> 1:45:12.660]  But how did you know two weeks ago they were going to start this branding?
[1:45:12.660 --> 1:45:20.660]  Because they're saying the Yale psychologist violating the Goldwater rule and their own licenses saying he's obviously mentally ill, remove him.
[1:45:20.660 --> 1:45:23.660]  Oh, and also this analysis of his speech patterns.
[1:45:23.660 --> 1:45:30.660]  You see, so we've analyzed his speech patterns and we see that they've changed over the last two years and that means that he has Alzheimer's and he's slipping.
[1:45:30.660 --> 1:45:35.660]  This is vile, but this is... He talks different to different audiences. He's that smart.
[1:45:35.660 --> 1:45:42.660]  But this is why, you see, they know the Russian thing is a loser. They know it's not working. They know they have nothing.
[1:45:42.660 --> 1:45:44.660]  So you agree with me? They're panicking.
[1:45:44.660 --> 1:45:46.660]  Yeah, so that's why we're now moving to the... All signs.
[1:45:46.660 --> 1:45:51.660]  He's crazy. He's crazy meme because we can't show that he's a Russian trader.
[1:45:51.660 --> 1:45:55.660]  So let's undermine him by saying he's mentally deficient, that he's slipping.
[1:45:55.660 --> 1:46:04.660]  It's an insult to his family. It's an insult to the presidency. It's an insult to the country that they're going to try to feed this path.
[1:46:04.660 --> 1:46:11.660]  But if you go on the view, you'll see whoopee and the girls pushing this ridiculous false name.
[1:46:11.660 --> 1:46:16.660]  You've been on that show. They want me on should I do it? And I've been on there too, but what's the point of it?
[1:46:16.660 --> 1:46:21.660]  Well, first of all, it helps you reach a mass audience and I'm confident that you can handle it.
[1:46:21.660 --> 1:46:24.660]  By the way, I heard that you're going to be sitting down with Megyn Kelly.
[1:46:24.660 --> 1:46:26.660]  Yeah, she's coming to town. She's coming to town next week.
[1:46:26.660 --> 1:46:29.660]  Now, that will be quite a match. Alex Jones and Megyn Kelly.
[1:46:29.660 --> 1:46:31.660]  Yeah, but it's taped. It's taped.
[1:46:31.660 --> 1:46:34.660]  I know you and I know her. I'm betting on you.
[1:46:34.660 --> 1:46:40.660]  No, I mean, they're going to be able to edit however they want, but I mean, the producer was so over the top, fake nice.
[1:46:40.660 --> 1:46:43.660]  Oh, it's going to be wonderful. You're in love and I'm like, I'm not stupid.
[1:46:43.660 --> 1:46:49.660]  And I'm like, Megan's like, oh, we're going to get dinner and I speak steak and I said, Megan, you don't like me. Stop acting like it.
[1:46:49.660 --> 1:46:53.660]  She goes, I do. I want to do a new magazine. She said it was an off-record conversation.
[1:46:53.660 --> 1:46:58.660]  I'm not going to get into all of it. I just want it known. I'm not doing the interview because she's a pretty girl.
[1:46:58.660 --> 1:47:00.660]  I'm doing it because I can't be a wimp and turn it down.
[1:47:00.660 --> 1:47:05.660]  Look, I think you should take her out for a big piece of meat. They got the best steak houses in the world right here in Austin.
[1:47:05.660 --> 1:47:07.660]  I can't wait to see this interview.
[1:47:07.660 --> 1:47:09.660]  Well, I'll be sure and take my wife if that happens.
[1:47:09.660 --> 1:47:14.660]  But you know, the whole point is that I guarantee when the interview is over, it's not going to be, let's go get dinner.
[1:47:14.660 --> 1:47:18.660]  It's just like putting a worm on a hook, man.
[1:47:18.660 --> 1:47:23.660]  It's just, it's crazy how MSM will act like they're your friend and every time screw you over.
[1:47:23.660 --> 1:47:25.660]  Yeah, but you're fearless. That's the point.
[1:47:25.660 --> 1:47:34.660]  Oh, I'm not worried about that. I just want the audience to know, I know I'm walking into a trap, but I think they're so discredited that just like when Cernovich was on 60 Minutes, you know, Paley just lost his job.
[1:47:34.660 --> 1:47:35.660]  Yes.
[1:47:35.660 --> 1:47:37.660]  I mean, the guys, they're arrogant.
[1:47:37.660 --> 1:47:42.660]  He says some things like Hillary campaigns, she's never been sick. You're a conspiracy theorist.
[1:47:42.660 --> 1:47:49.660]  He goes, man, you guys lie about WMDs. Nobody believes you. They didn't get that their con game doesn't work anymore, Roger.
[1:47:49.660 --> 1:47:57.660]  Well, interesting. If I recall correctly, when you and I both raised the question of Hillary's health, we were accused of making it up.
[1:47:57.660 --> 1:48:02.660]  Last week at Wellesley, she had another coughing fit. She couldn't recover from the coughing fit.
[1:48:02.660 --> 1:48:09.660]  And it's the same one. It's known when you have Parkinson's from the brain tumors and surgery she's reportedly had, that it isn't just shaking.
[1:48:09.660 --> 1:48:22.660]  The drugs can take care of that, but they can't deal with core brainstem issues and that it starts closing in on you and that coughing fits are the hallmark of the type she's having that the medication can't help.
[1:48:22.660 --> 1:48:31.660]  Well, look, in a perfect world, when she came down off the podium at Wellesley, there should have been two federal marshals there to slap the cuffs on her and drag her off.
[1:48:31.660 --> 1:48:36.660]  Oh, that was the great part. I love how she's saying, I beat Trump and I beat Bernie.
[1:48:36.660 --> 1:48:42.660]  She publicly stole it from Bernie. That's admitted. And then she can't even hardly talk while she's saying it.
[1:48:42.660 --> 1:48:48.660]  See, Pinocchio's nose grows when he lies. She starts coughing and I guess Darth Vader's interdimensionally choking her.
[1:48:48.660 --> 1:48:53.660]  It's like a tell. It's kind of a tell. I'm lying because she's choking. The coughing starts.
[1:48:53.660 --> 1:49:00.660]  But there's the other thing. Why did she wear the Monica Lewinsky type beret? Was that an attempt to look like Monica?
[1:49:00.660 --> 1:49:03.660]  I couldn't figure out what she was doing there. But she can't get history right.
[1:49:03.660 --> 1:49:12.660]  She says Richard Nixon was impeached. He wasn't. The difference between her husband and Richard Nixon was when he decided his presidency was hurting the country.
[1:49:12.660 --> 1:49:16.660]  He had the good sense and the patriotism to step down something.
[1:49:16.660 --> 1:49:23.660]  By the way, she looks like Casper. I mean, she looks like if Gamalons or Martians invaded that green skin. I mean, we haven't altered that video.
[1:49:23.660 --> 1:49:25.660]  She looks like she's dying up there.
[1:49:25.660 --> 1:49:27.660]  She does not look healthy. That's fair to say.
[1:49:27.660 --> 1:49:35.660]  Oh my gosh. Shifting gears back into how they're planning riots this summer. The very open society foundation you're talking about.
[1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:39.660]  Soros has literally infiltrated. Tell folks the name of this lady again. This is big news.
[1:49:39.660 --> 1:49:46.660]  Fiona Hill, again, is now on the National Security Apparatus staff in the Trump White House.
[1:49:46.660 --> 1:49:59.660]  A formerly at the Brookings Institution, the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard has been along on the Soros payroll.
[1:49:59.660 --> 1:50:04.660]  One cannot even fathom what she's doing inside the Trump White House.
[1:50:04.660 --> 1:50:14.660]  Now, the good news is that the president has been sticking to his agenda despite some very bad inside advice.
[1:50:14.660 --> 1:50:26.660]  The best example of this was when presidential advisor and chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn, formerly of Goldman Sachs, told the New York Post only days ago,
[1:50:26.660 --> 1:50:37.660]  the president was coming to the conclave on climate change so that he could get smart, so that he could become better informed about the issues.
[1:50:37.660 --> 1:50:48.660]  This was part and parcel of an attempt by Mr. Cohn and Dina Habib Powell to push the president towards folding on climate.
[1:50:48.660 --> 1:50:51.660]  And instead, he came out even more brazenly against it.
[1:50:51.660 --> 1:50:56.660]  It did the absolute right thing. Instead of being led by his handlers, he stood up from in place.
[1:50:56.660 --> 1:51:08.660]  I mean, he needs to get rid of that moron. We'll be back.

[1:54:20.660 --> 1:54:37.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live. We have a special guest joining us in the next hour who went and camped out at Maxine Waters House and exposed the fact that she needs to be in peace.
[1:54:37.660 --> 1:54:45.660]  Omar Navarro is running for Congress out there and I know that I'm a fan of his videos. I've seen him also a fan of his work.
[1:54:45.660 --> 1:54:50.660]  So is Owen Shroyer. He'll be in here with us a little bit later in the next hour.
[1:54:50.660 --> 1:54:55.660]  She's got a big problem, Maxine Waters, because I hear the James Brown Foundation wants their wig back.
[1:54:55.660 --> 1:55:05.660]  But you heard Putin invaded Korea in Eastern Europe. He's in Eastern Europe with the invasion of the Korea.
[1:55:05.660 --> 1:55:24.660]  And by the way, she said it like for the ninth time. There's another video. In fact, we have to play that next hour. I forgot to tell the crew about it, where the leader of the Democrats in the House, Nancy Pelosi, still thinks Bush, George W., is the president nine years later, eight and a half years later, and then can't remember Trump's name.
[1:55:24.660 --> 1:55:29.540]  I remember Trump's name, he goes, ah, ah, what, ah, oh, I mean, these people are crazy.
[1:55:29.540 --> 1:55:34.020]  Well, in the case of Maxine Waters, I made this point yesterday, she and her husband
[1:55:34.020 --> 1:55:39.540]  have engaged in business activities that would send a white conservative Republican to prison.
[1:55:39.540 --> 1:55:42.340]  She's gotten a pass during the Obama years.
[1:55:42.340 --> 1:55:47.100]  I think Jeff Sessions and the new Justice Department need to review all of their business
[1:55:47.100 --> 1:55:51.780]  dealings because it is, it's rank corruption, Alex, it's, why are they allowed to do whatever
[1:55:51.780 --> 1:55:52.780]  they want?
[1:55:52.780 --> 1:55:58.420]  Judicial Democrats have done a superb job of exposing Maxine Waters and her husband.
[1:55:58.420 --> 1:55:59.420]  They're corrupt.
[1:55:59.420 --> 1:56:02.660]  If she were a Republican, she'd be in prison right now.
[1:56:02.660 --> 1:56:07.260]  But they're calling Trump mentally ill while Democrats are in the news saying white genocide
[1:56:07.260 --> 1:56:08.260]  is good.
[1:56:08.260 --> 1:56:09.260]  These are white guys.
[1:56:09.260 --> 1:56:17.220]  You know, ban white boards, ban the family, have, you know, tranny reading days for toddlers
[1:56:17.220 --> 1:56:22.860]  at the New York library, just complete the Sandy Ooma Abadine has invited Anthony Wiener
[1:56:22.860 --> 1:56:28.740]  back home a week after she said, so yesterday, Tucker Carlson tangled with a member of the
[1:56:28.740 --> 1:56:34.580]  DC city council who was insisting that, that this Puerto Rican terrorist was some kind
[1:56:34.580 --> 1:56:38.900]  of hero, a man who robbed and killed people.
[1:56:38.900 --> 1:56:44.100]  And he was trying to argue that's legitimate political dissent, Tucker, because you white
[1:56:44.100 --> 1:56:45.420]  people have oppressed us.
[1:56:45.420 --> 1:56:48.180]  That's essentially his argument.
[1:56:48.180 --> 1:56:52.620]  That's like saying if a black guy robbed me, then I would randomly go out and attack black
[1:56:52.620 --> 1:56:53.620]  people.
[1:56:53.620 --> 1:56:56.220]  I mean, I mean, that's like saying of my great, great grandfather did something wrong.
[1:56:56.220 --> 1:57:00.020]  I'm guilty or my great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,
[1:57:00.020 --> 1:57:01.020]  grand.
[1:57:01.020 --> 1:57:03.980]  I mean, that's worse than the Soviet Union, where if your neighbor did something wrong,
[1:57:03.980 --> 1:57:04.980]  you'd go to jail too.
[1:57:04.980 --> 1:57:08.900]  Look, I give, I give Tucker credit for tolerance.
[1:57:08.900 --> 1:57:12.580]  If it were me, I would have grabbed that guy's bow tie and shoved it down his throat.
[1:57:12.580 --> 1:57:14.700]  He was, he was very good in this exchange.
[1:57:14.700 --> 1:57:15.700]  That's right.
[1:57:15.700 --> 1:57:16.700]  We're going to play that clip coming up the next hour.
[1:57:16.700 --> 1:57:22.540]  We've got so many of these clips to get to again, why do you think they have now basically
[1:57:22.540 --> 1:57:32.340]  fired the reporter slash entertainer slash more on that is out there saying chop the
[1:57:32.340 --> 1:57:37.300]  head off and Trump basically, because they, I think they recognize that once again, they
[1:57:37.300 --> 1:57:42.700]  have overstepped and also they're in the middle of shifting themes.
[1:57:42.700 --> 1:57:45.740]  We have an uprising coming of that there is no doubt.
[1:57:45.740 --> 1:57:50.460]  It was going to be based on the fact that we have to drive Trump from office because
[1:57:50.460 --> 1:57:52.860]  he's a Russian trader.
[1:57:52.860 --> 1:57:54.580]  That's not selling to the American people.
[1:57:54.580 --> 1:57:57.660]  They can't come up with any iota of evidence.
[1:57:57.660 --> 1:58:01.940]  So the new thing I've noticed, he about a week after you said it, incompetent, incompetent,
[1:58:01.940 --> 1:58:06.140]  an idiot, a moron, he couldn't clear with the Russian stupid.
[1:58:06.140 --> 1:58:07.140]  It's mental.
[1:58:07.140 --> 1:58:08.140]  He's mentally feeble.
[1:58:08.140 --> 1:58:09.640]  He's mentally slipping.
[1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:11.420]  This is going to be the new theme.
[1:58:11.420 --> 1:58:12.420]  He won't listen.
[1:58:12.420 --> 1:58:14.380]  He doesn't want to pay Al Gore carbon taxes.
[1:58:14.380 --> 1:58:19.620]  So this is going to be the new theme in which they try to justify this, this street uprising.
[1:58:19.620 --> 1:58:22.420]  By the way, we got you some great pizza here in Austin.
[1:58:22.420 --> 1:58:23.420]  That's what you wanted.
[1:58:23.420 --> 1:58:24.420]  We'll do five more minutes.
[1:58:24.420 --> 1:58:27.340]  You can go get some pizza because you're hosting the fourth hour today, Roger.
[1:58:27.340 --> 1:58:28.340]  I can't wait.
[1:58:28.340 --> 1:58:31.140]  And soon five nights a week, he's going to be on at night.
[1:58:31.140 --> 1:58:32.140]  Roger Stone.
[1:58:32.140 --> 1:58:33.140]  You heard here first.
[1:58:33.140 --> 1:58:34.140]  I'm Alex Jones.

[1:58:36.820 --> 1:58:40.980]  Stay with us.
[1:58:40.980 --> 1:58:54.660]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[1:58:54.660 --> 1:58:59.380]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through mother nature
[1:58:59.380 --> 1:59:00.900]  to detoxify the body.
[1:59:00.900 --> 1:59:05.780]  That's why I'm introducing the shield toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[1:59:05.780 --> 1:59:07.300]  It's made in the USA.
[1:59:07.300 --> 1:59:12.220]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[1:59:12.220 --> 1:59:14.060]  the body and it supports the info war.
[1:59:14.060 --> 1:59:19.260]  It is a classical 360 when this is the formula that I personally have been taking for over
[1:59:19.260 --> 1:59:20.260]  a year.
[1:59:20.260 --> 1:59:24.660]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier
[1:59:24.660 --> 1:59:25.900]  as you can possibly get.
[1:59:25.900 --> 1:59:30.060]  You want to yourself, you want to your family and you owe it to the future of this country
[1:59:30.060 --> 1:59:35.220]  in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[1:59:35.220 --> 1:59:40.540]  because we need you, the remnant of America to reignite those brush fires the next level
[1:59:40.540 --> 1:59:42.660]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[1:59:42.660 --> 1:59:44.940]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together.
[1:59:44.940 --> 1:59:45.940]  We're changing the world.

[2:00:30.620 --> 2:00:31.620]  that.
[2:00:31.620 --> 2:00:36.260]  I'm a happily married man, as you know, I know, I understand, but that is my theme song.
[2:00:36.260 --> 2:00:40.300]  I do like ZZ top and that's one of my favorites.
[2:00:40.300 --> 2:00:44.660]  Something tells me that those guys hang out with a few ladies.
[2:00:44.660 --> 2:00:47.580]  Yeah, no, for three guys to make a lot of music.
[2:00:47.580 --> 2:00:52.140]  That's a lot of Texas guitar right there.
[2:00:52.140 --> 2:00:56.820]  Crack it up for a minute.
[2:00:56.820 --> 2:00:59.020]  Recognize is no diamond ring, no bass player.
[2:00:59.020 --> 2:01:00.820]  That's two guitarists and a drummer.
[2:01:00.820 --> 2:01:02.060]  That's a hell of a lot of music.
[2:01:02.060 --> 2:01:03.500]  It's a very full sound.
[2:01:03.500 --> 2:01:10.060]  That's a Texas guitar style doesn't get any better than that.
[2:01:10.060 --> 2:01:12.340]  That could be your theme song on your nightly show.
[2:01:12.340 --> 2:01:13.340]  I like that.
[2:01:13.340 --> 2:01:14.340]  Done.
[2:01:14.340 --> 2:01:18.060]  Everybody girls crazy about a sharp dress, man.
[2:01:18.060 --> 2:01:20.340]  Let's let's have some more fun here.
[2:01:20.340 --> 2:01:24.300]  You're back in 58 minutes, so let's get into what you're going to be covering coming up
[2:01:24.300 --> 2:01:25.540]  today in the fourth hour.
[2:01:25.540 --> 2:01:31.060]  I'm going to try to zoom in on the coming White House shake up Alex, whether David
[2:01:31.060 --> 2:01:38.780]  Urban, who is, you know, a decorated veteran, an attorney, the guy who ran the Trump campaign
[2:01:38.780 --> 2:01:44.060]  in Pennsylvania, whether he's going inside, whether Reince Priebus is heading for an ambassador
[2:01:44.060 --> 2:01:48.580]  ship to, oh, I don't know, say Greece, perhaps.
[2:01:48.580 --> 2:01:53.220]  I think Donald Trump has a unique opportunity to save himself, but we're going to talk about
[2:01:53.220 --> 2:01:58.140]  how he should do that, how he should go on offense, what needs to be done.
[2:01:58.140 --> 2:02:01.300]  The answer is not a new war room.
[2:02:01.300 --> 2:02:05.580]  The answer is not a new PR offensive.
[2:02:05.580 --> 2:02:07.060]  It's a policy offensive.
[2:02:07.060 --> 2:02:08.060]  That's right.
[2:02:08.060 --> 2:02:12.060]  It's delivering for the American people on your pledges and it's cleaning house of all
[2:02:12.060 --> 2:02:19.820]  these establishment moles who work around the clock to steer the president towards globalism,
[2:02:19.820 --> 2:02:25.180]  to break with his own constituents and essentially destroy the Trump coalition.
[2:02:25.180 --> 2:02:27.060]  I think the president's too smart for that.
[2:02:27.060 --> 2:02:30.420]  I've got some specific insights about what's about to happen.
[2:02:30.420 --> 2:02:32.260]  We're going to talk about it in the fourth hour.
[2:02:32.260 --> 2:02:38.220]  We should call this little short segment Trump's secret weapon policy offensive or Trump's secret
[2:02:38.220 --> 2:02:39.220]  weapon delivering.
[2:02:39.220 --> 2:02:44.940]  Again, we know just like the campaign, they'll do 10, 15, 20 points in basic polls, sometimes
[2:02:44.940 --> 2:02:45.940]  30, 40 points.
[2:02:45.940 --> 2:02:50.980]  The worst I saw was about 36 points by CNN in phone polls.
[2:02:50.980 --> 2:02:54.860]  Extra sampling against Trump to show Hillary at like 64 or whatever.
[2:02:54.860 --> 2:02:56.460]  That's just insane level rigging.
[2:02:56.460 --> 2:03:00.300]  Well, they're still doing that in the big polls, showing him at 4850.
[2:03:00.300 --> 2:03:02.140]  It's more like 60, 70.
[2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:05.740]  That's why they're so scared and act like they're being strangled because they politically
[2:03:05.740 --> 2:03:06.980]  are being killed.
[2:03:06.980 --> 2:03:08.380]  They're being euthanized.
[2:03:08.380 --> 2:03:11.420]  The Democratic Party is being put into the acid bath.
[2:03:11.420 --> 2:03:16.180]  Well, and because we're going through essentially a deep state takedown of Trump, I've had some
[2:03:16.180 --> 2:03:18.460]  experience with this having worked for Richard Nixon.
[2:03:18.460 --> 2:03:21.780]  By the way, there's tons of CIA FBI coming out saying that's happening.
[2:03:21.780 --> 2:03:24.020]  So it's not just the whole deep state that's bad.
[2:03:24.020 --> 2:03:26.460]  There's other folks in the permanent government that are battling it.
[2:03:26.460 --> 2:03:30.580]  But I would make the case to you that Nixon basically, other than the firing of Archibald
[2:03:30.580 --> 2:03:36.180]  Cox made every possible mistake when the deep state was trying to take him down.
[2:03:36.180 --> 2:03:40.620]  And I think it's vitally important that Donald Trump not make those same mistakes.
[2:03:40.620 --> 2:03:41.620]  What are those mistakes?
[2:03:41.620 --> 2:03:46.100]  Well, first of all, he should be using the Justice Department apparatus to turn the
[2:03:46.100 --> 2:03:47.780]  tables on his tormentors.
[2:03:47.780 --> 2:03:51.580]  It's time for Mr. Hayden, Mr. Brennan.
[2:03:51.580 --> 2:03:55.660]  Oh, they've all got just legions of skeletons.
[2:03:55.660 --> 2:04:01.900]  They need to be in front of a grand jury in determining whether the law was broken in
[2:04:01.900 --> 2:04:06.260]  the attempts to create the fake Russian narrative.
[2:04:06.260 --> 2:04:08.060]  They're the ones who broke the law.
[2:04:08.060 --> 2:04:09.260]  They're the ones who violated the law.
[2:04:09.260 --> 2:04:10.820]  And they've been caught red-handed.
[2:04:10.820 --> 2:04:11.820]  It's confirmed.
[2:04:11.820 --> 2:04:18.820]  And now we know that James Comey basically denied the prosecution of Hillary Clinton
[2:04:18.820 --> 2:04:23.300]  on the basis of a fake memo.
[2:04:23.300 --> 2:04:27.700]  The vaunted- And he knew it was fake and told Congress it was real.
[2:04:27.700 --> 2:04:28.860]  Stop right there.
[2:04:28.860 --> 2:04:30.860]  Promise me your first 10, 15 minutes today.
[2:04:30.860 --> 2:04:36.100]  We'll be Roger Stone, Trump's battle plan to take down the deep state, because I want
[2:04:36.100 --> 2:04:37.940]  you to just lay this out with more time.
[2:04:37.940 --> 2:04:38.940]  That's what we're going to do.
[2:04:38.940 --> 2:04:44.140]  And you'll be able to get your official James Comey nut job t-shirts.
[2:04:44.140 --> 2:04:45.140]  Are you coming out with us?
[2:04:45.140 --> 2:04:46.140]  Indeed.
[2:04:46.140 --> 2:04:49.260]  I think they'll be available at the M4 store momentarily.
[2:04:49.260 --> 2:04:50.260]  I love it.
[2:04:50.260 --> 2:04:52.860]  This guy's directing our new propaganda offensive against the globalist.
[2:04:52.860 --> 2:04:55.140]  Oh, propaganda's a good word when it's true.
[2:04:55.140 --> 2:04:57.420]  Oh, my gosh.
[2:04:57.420 --> 2:05:00.100]  This will be a day long remembered.
[2:05:00.100 --> 2:05:07.220]  A video has gone viral on the internet, where Muslim migrants are caught in the act, stealing
[2:05:07.220 --> 2:05:14.780]  flowers and toys from, get this, a memorial dedicated to the victims of the Manchester
[2:05:14.780 --> 2:05:15.780]  bombing.
[2:05:15.780 --> 2:05:20.980]  During the video, you can hear the man behind the camera, who is from Manchester, approaching
[2:05:20.980 --> 2:05:25.100]  the two migrant men and accusing them of being thieves.
[2:05:25.100 --> 2:05:31.580]  Put them back, now, put them back now, now.
[2:05:31.580 --> 2:05:37.620]  Now one of the migrants is seen holding a stuffed blue Smurf toy that he had just stolen from
[2:05:37.620 --> 2:05:38.620]  the memorial.
[2:05:38.620 --> 2:05:40.180]  I'm not supposed to be out of the pair here.
[2:05:40.180 --> 2:05:41.180]  How was that?
[2:05:41.180 --> 2:05:45.460]  Now, in case you missed that, the man from Manchester told the Muslim migrants, I'll
[2:05:45.460 --> 2:05:51.060]  knock this out of the pair of you, proof that not all of the citizens of Manchester are
[2:05:51.060 --> 2:05:57.660]  liberal cucks, and you can watch the video in its entirety right now at Infowars.com.
[1:50:04.000 --> 2:07:17.700]  the true trailblazers on which all of us stand.
[2:07:17.700 --> 2:07:23.460]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference, I don't feel good.
[2:07:23.460 --> 2:07:27.140]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[2:07:27.140 --> 2:07:32.340]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale, I had a few bottles at my house, and I've
[2:07:32.340 --> 2:07:37.660]  been taking it again, hitting the gym once again, very exciting, feeling great, looking
[2:07:37.660 --> 2:07:44.340]  good, and I know my hair's luxurious once again, so obviously the superfemale is amazing,
[2:07:44.340 --> 2:07:45.340]  I love it.
[2:07:45.340 --> 2:07:48.020]  The nascent iodine is essential.
[2:07:48.020 --> 2:07:51.260]  Survival Shield X2, if there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would
[2:07:51.260 --> 2:07:56.940]  suggest, it's nascent iodine, Survival Shield X2, it's got a five star rating, it's a win
[2:07:56.940 --> 2:07:58.940]  win, Infowarslife.com.
[2:07:58.940 --> 2:08:08.980]  He's a conspiracy theorist, radio talk show host, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, his name is
[2:08:08.980 --> 2:08:09.980]  Alex Jones.
[2:08:09.980 --> 2:08:15.180]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist, radio talk show host, and conspiracy theorist
[2:08:15.180 --> 2:08:16.180]  Alex Jones.
[2:08:16.180 --> 2:08:20.620]  Alex Jones is a nut job radio guy, talk show host, Alex Jones, a man who trades in such
[2:08:20.620 --> 2:08:24.580]  sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder if he really believes half of what
[2:08:24.580 --> 2:08:25.580]  he says.
[2:08:25.580 --> 2:08:28.660]  I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up, this isn't a game.
[2:08:28.660 --> 2:08:31.700]  Hate speech, can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[2:08:31.700 --> 2:08:36.180]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro gun position.
[2:08:36.180 --> 2:08:39.980]  1776 will commence again if you try to take off firearms.
[2:08:39.980 --> 2:08:42.060]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[2:08:42.060 --> 2:08:43.940]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[2:08:43.940 --> 2:08:47.700]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories, it's an internet
[2:08:47.700 --> 2:08:49.740]  talk show called Infowars.
[2:08:49.740 --> 2:08:52.380]  I heard that on Alex Jones so it's true.
[2:08:52.380 --> 2:08:53.380]  Dave.
[2:08:53.380 --> 2:08:55.380]  I heard it on Alex Jones so I know it's true.
[2:08:55.380 --> 2:08:58.820]  You're making some very serious allegations against the US government saying that they
[2:08:58.820 --> 2:09:02.980]  stage attacks, they allow them to occur in the United States against US citizens.
[2:09:02.980 --> 2:09:03.980]  Let's declassify.
[2:09:03.980 --> 2:09:05.460]  Alex Jones may sound crazy.
[2:09:05.460 --> 2:09:07.660]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[2:09:07.660 --> 2:09:09.220]  That man's threatened this country.
[2:09:09.220 --> 2:09:10.780]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[2:09:10.780 --> 2:09:12.180]  Deacly I think racist.
[2:09:12.180 --> 2:09:14.180]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[2:09:14.180 --> 2:09:16.340]  Don't consider Lidge Jim on the cruise.
[2:09:16.340 --> 2:09:21.220]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally
[2:09:21.220 --> 2:09:22.220]  and pop him.
[2:09:22.220 --> 2:09:23.220]  I'd love to see that.
[2:09:23.220 --> 2:09:24.220]  In uniform.
[2:09:24.220 --> 2:09:30.220]  Keep shoving lies at your audience Jackasses.
[2:09:30.220 --> 2:09:31.220]  I like that guy.
[2:09:31.220 --> 2:09:47.220]  That is the best.
[2:09:47.220 --> 2:09:51.220]  We have gangsters running this country, criminals, gangsters.
[2:09:51.220 --> 2:09:57.220]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
[2:09:57.220 --> 2:10:02.220]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[2:10:02.220 --> 2:10:04.220]  Hillary's the one who runs the cover up.
[2:10:04.220 --> 2:10:09.220]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spades.
[2:10:09.220 --> 2:10:11.220]  This is real as it gets.
[2:10:11.220 --> 2:10:15.220]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me.
[2:10:15.220 --> 2:10:16.220]  I said Matt it's over for you.
[2:10:16.220 --> 2:10:18.220]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[2:10:18.220 --> 2:10:19.220]  You're out of there.
[2:10:19.220 --> 2:10:20.220]  You want it baby.
[2:10:20.220 --> 2:10:21.220]  You're about to get it.
[2:10:21.220 --> 2:10:35.220]  We just meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant and see how many
[2:10:35.220 --> 2:10:38.220]  guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[2:10:38.220 --> 2:10:43.220]  We met them at Concord Bridge and we blew their punk ass brains out.
[2:10:43.220 --> 2:10:48.220]  Info wars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal
[2:10:48.220 --> 2:10:53.220]  cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom.
[2:10:53.220 --> 2:10:55.220]  And I'm so proud of that.
[2:10:55.220 --> 2:10:58.220]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women.
[2:10:58.220 --> 2:11:03.220]  No, Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[2:11:03.220 --> 2:11:07.220]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when
[2:11:07.220 --> 2:11:13.220]  you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[2:11:13.220 --> 2:11:18.220]  These people are of the devil.
[2:11:18.220 --> 2:11:21.220]  Raise hell and demand accountability.
[2:11:21.220 --> 2:11:26.220]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[2:11:26.220 --> 2:11:30.220]  But it doesn't want to leave office.
[2:11:30.220 --> 2:11:34.220]  Of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:11:34.220 --> 2:11:35.220]  That's right.
[2:11:35.220 --> 2:11:37.220]  The Globals don't want to leave office.
[2:11:37.220 --> 2:11:39.220]  They're still trying to stay in power.
[2:11:39.220 --> 2:11:46.220]  The swamp is striking back, but the giant is rising.
[2:11:46.220 --> 2:11:50.220]  There's a powerful clip of Omar Navarro out front Maxine Waters House.
[2:11:50.220 --> 2:11:51.220]  It's really beautiful.
[2:11:51.220 --> 2:11:53.220]  I couldn't be wrong that's amazing right here.
[2:11:53.220 --> 2:11:56.220]  But it's not in the district.
[2:11:56.220 --> 2:11:59.220]  The people that are in the district are struggling, are suffering.
[2:11:59.220 --> 2:12:00.220]  You have homelessness.
[2:12:00.220 --> 2:12:02.220]  You have a lot of poverty.
[2:12:02.220 --> 2:12:04.220]  You have a lot of broken communities.
[2:12:04.220 --> 2:12:05.220]  The black community is broken.
[2:12:05.220 --> 2:12:07.220]  The Hispanic community is broken.
[2:12:07.220 --> 2:12:09.220]  The Asian community is broken.
[2:12:09.220 --> 2:12:11.220]  The white community is broken.
[2:12:11.220 --> 2:12:12.220]  Why is it broken?
[2:12:12.220 --> 2:12:16.220]  Because people who are politicians in our own districts are not doing anything.
[2:12:16.220 --> 2:12:19.220]  Anything to fix any of the issues that are going on.
[2:12:19.220 --> 2:12:22.220]  I'm running for Congress because I care about cleaning up the parks.
[2:12:22.220 --> 2:12:25.220]  If people go outside, let's say you're in a community that's so broken.
[2:12:25.220 --> 2:12:27.220]  Let's say you want to go to a nice park.
[2:12:27.220 --> 2:12:29.220]  Let's say you want to go to a nice park.
[2:12:29.220 --> 2:12:31.220]  But you can't go to a nice park.
[2:12:31.220 --> 2:12:36.220]  You have gang bangers in that park who can kill kids, who can hurt kids.
[2:12:36.220 --> 2:12:39.220]  I mean, this is what convenience I want my kids to go to.
[2:12:39.220 --> 2:12:41.220]  I feel safe here.
[2:12:41.220 --> 2:12:45.220]  But a lot of kids in those communities like Englewood, like Hawthorne,
[2:12:45.220 --> 2:12:47.220]  they don't feel safe at going to the parks.
[2:12:47.220 --> 2:12:48.220]  They don't feel safe.
[2:12:48.220 --> 2:12:50.220]  They are not safe.
[2:12:50.220 --> 2:12:54.220]  We're sitting here getting ready to watch the footage of the Mariachi Band
[2:12:54.220 --> 2:12:56.220]  that Omar Navarro had in the background.
[2:12:56.220 --> 2:12:59.220]  You got to let me give a press conference with the Mariachi Band in the background.
[2:12:59.220 --> 2:13:00.220]  I love it. I love Mariachi Band.
[2:13:00.220 --> 2:13:04.220]  Omar Navarro, of course, is running for office out in California.
[2:13:04.220 --> 2:13:08.220]  I'm very excited about having him with us, and he's been going out
[2:13:08.220 --> 2:13:12.220]  and getting a lot of publicity going out at the houses
[2:13:12.220 --> 2:13:15.220]  and in workplaces of the Democrats that are always doing this to Republicans
[2:13:15.220 --> 2:13:18.220]  or Libertarians, but get really upset when we do it.
[2:13:18.220 --> 2:13:21.220]  He's a small business owner and has also worked with many forces of owner companies.
[2:13:21.220 --> 2:13:23.220]  He earned his bachelor's degree in criminal justice.
[2:13:23.220 --> 2:13:25.220]  He's also assisted victims of crimes.
[2:13:25.220 --> 2:13:26.220]  Los Angeles Attorney's Office.
[2:13:26.220 --> 2:13:31.220]  Omar is a contractor, a coordinator for the Unified Small Business Alliance
[2:13:31.220 --> 2:13:37.220]  outreach program. In 2012, Omar was an advocate against the Redistricting Commission maps
[2:13:37.220 --> 2:13:38.220]  for gerrymandering.
[2:13:38.220 --> 2:13:43.220]  He serves as a local traffic commissioner in the city of Torrance, California.
[2:13:43.220 --> 2:13:48.220]  Follow him at Twitter, at Press GOP, at Omar Navarro on YouTube,
[2:13:48.220 --> 2:13:50.220]  and Press GOP on Instagram.
[2:13:50.220 --> 2:13:52.220]  And Omar, you're running for office.
[2:13:52.220 --> 2:13:57.220]  Tell us about that. You're running for Congress in the 43rd district.
[2:13:57.220 --> 2:14:00.220]  I think we just lost Skype as we prepared to go to him.
[2:14:00.220 --> 2:14:04.220]  We'll get him back up on Skype, but I'll tell you, it's who he's running against,
[2:14:04.220 --> 2:14:08.220]  obviously, is the big issue here, and whether he wins or not.
[2:14:08.220 --> 2:14:10.220]  And he ran before, didn't he, and almost won.
[2:14:10.220 --> 2:14:14.220]  He's educating people and injecting real issues, so he's winning by resisting.
[2:14:14.220 --> 2:14:16.220]  He's a young guy.
[2:14:16.220 --> 2:14:19.220]  Even if he doesn't win this one, he's going to end up getting into Congress.
[2:14:19.220 --> 2:14:21.220]  Well, I like the fact that you mentioned his age.
[2:14:21.220 --> 2:14:24.220]  You know, we're the same age. We were both born in 1989,
[2:14:24.220 --> 2:14:29.220]  and I'm just so proud to see people that are my age making a difference out there,
[2:14:29.220 --> 2:14:34.220]  caring about their communities, finally starting to have an impact on this world.
[2:14:34.220 --> 2:14:37.220]  You know, we can't sit around in our parents' basements forever playing video games,
[2:14:37.220 --> 2:14:40.220]  or, you know, smoking pot, or whatever all these kids are doing my age,
[2:14:40.220 --> 2:14:42.220]  complaining about this, that, or the other thing,
[2:14:42.220 --> 2:14:45.220]  or, you know, complaining about how great they have it in America.
[2:14:45.220 --> 2:14:47.220]  No, we're actually out here trying to make an impact.
[2:14:47.220 --> 2:14:51.220]  I was about to say, the whole global program is about arresting the development of humans.
[2:14:51.220 --> 2:14:55.220]  Men, particularly, it isn't about race. It's about, we're all human.
[2:14:55.220 --> 2:14:59.220]  It's about arresting development. And then adults who are like, you know,
[2:14:59.220 --> 2:15:02.220]  30, 40 years old treat 25-year-olds like their kids.
[2:15:02.220 --> 2:15:06.220]  Thomas Jefferson was writing the Declaration of Independence before he was 30.
[2:15:06.220 --> 2:15:08.220]  People used to be married by the time they were 16.
[2:15:08.220 --> 2:15:10.220]  They had huge empires by the time they were 20.
[2:15:10.220 --> 2:15:14.220]  I mean, Alexander the Great launched his whole operation when he was like 15 years old,
[2:15:14.220 --> 2:15:16.220]  died when he was like 28 or whatever it is.
[2:15:16.220 --> 2:15:18.220]  The point is, it's just the arrest of development.
[2:15:18.220 --> 2:15:20.220]  I was politically involved when I was 17.
[2:15:20.220 --> 2:15:22.220]  I had an access show when I was 21.
[2:15:22.220 --> 2:15:24.220]  I had a radio show when I was 21.
[2:15:24.220 --> 2:15:26.220]  I was syndicated by 23.
[2:15:26.220 --> 2:15:28.220]  I was on over 100 radio stations by 26.
[2:15:28.220 --> 2:15:30.220]  And I built this whole thing.
[2:15:30.220 --> 2:15:32.220]  Now I'm 43. That's what I'm supposed to do.
[2:15:32.220 --> 2:15:37.220]  Now I'm in the old silverback mode, ready to really be the leader.
[2:15:37.220 --> 2:15:40.220]  Imagine, oh, you're a man now, you're 40.
[2:15:40.220 --> 2:15:43.220]  No, I was crushing globalist when I was 25.
[2:15:43.220 --> 2:15:48.220]  People are so beat down by the system that by the time they're of the age of 23 or 24,
[2:15:48.220 --> 2:15:50.220]  and it's time to go out and create something on your own,
[2:15:50.220 --> 2:15:53.220]  they're so beat down by the system, they're told they're victims.
[2:15:53.220 --> 2:15:55.220]  Fake college, the debts, all of it.
[2:15:55.220 --> 2:15:57.220]  Yeah, burnout on prescription pills.
[2:15:57.220 --> 2:16:01.220]  So that's why I was so glad when I was introduced to Omar Navarro
[2:16:01.220 --> 2:16:03.220]  as he's about to join us again and saw that he was my age.
[2:16:03.220 --> 2:16:05.220]  He's making a difference. He's ready to make an impact on the world.
[2:16:05.220 --> 2:16:06.220]  You're 27 or 28.
[2:16:06.220 --> 2:16:07.220]  27.
[2:16:07.220 --> 2:16:08.220]  Yeah.
[2:16:08.220 --> 2:16:11.220]  Let's go to him. Omar, you've run before and got really good numbers.
[2:16:11.220 --> 2:16:13.220]  You're really polling good now.
[2:16:13.220 --> 2:16:14.220]  Wow, this is exciting.
[2:16:14.220 --> 2:16:17.220]  Tell us who you're running against, as if it isn't obvious.
[2:16:17.220 --> 2:16:18.220]  Yeah, my name's Omar Navarro.
[2:16:18.220 --> 2:16:22.220]  I'm challenging Maxine Waters in the 43rd Congressional District.
[2:16:22.220 --> 2:16:27.220]  I want to thank you guys for having me and for giving me a platform on InfoWars.
[2:16:27.220 --> 2:16:28.220]  I really appreciate that from the bottom of my heart.
[2:16:28.220 --> 2:16:30.220]  No, we appreciate you taking action.
[2:16:30.220 --> 2:16:32.220]  Thank you so much.
[2:16:32.220 --> 2:16:34.220]  So tell us about yourself, what you've been doing.
[2:16:34.220 --> 2:16:36.220]  I mean, a lot of folks love you in California, but now you're branching out.
[2:16:36.220 --> 2:16:37.220]  Yeah.
[2:16:37.220 --> 2:16:39.220]  You've got a shot at beating this gangster.
[2:16:39.220 --> 2:16:41.220]  Yeah, I've been going out.
[2:16:41.220 --> 2:16:44.220]  I'm active, I'm involved, and I'm engaging with the community.
[2:16:44.220 --> 2:16:46.220]  I'm talking to a lot of people.
[2:16:46.220 --> 2:16:49.220]  I have a huge volunteer base that's been helping out the campaign.
[2:16:49.220 --> 2:16:51.220]  Our name is going out there.
[2:16:51.220 --> 2:16:53.220]  We're going viral.
[2:16:53.220 --> 2:16:55.220]  We're setting an example in the state of California.
[2:16:55.220 --> 2:16:57.220]  We're fighting the globalists.
[2:16:57.220 --> 2:17:01.220]  We're fighting this liberal agenda, this communist agenda that is going on here.
[2:17:01.220 --> 2:17:03.220]  This is destroying the state of California.
[2:17:03.220 --> 2:17:07.220]  We're making sure we're going to do everything possible to take back the state and make sure
[2:17:07.220 --> 2:17:10.220]  that we're taking these people out and making sure that we're doing everything
[2:17:10.220 --> 2:17:12.220]  to fight for our own communities.
[2:17:12.220 --> 2:17:15.220]  Well, keep laying out why you decided to run, why you're doing this,
[2:17:15.220 --> 2:17:18.220]  and how you're getting so much attention because you're really a model of somebody
[2:17:18.220 --> 2:17:22.220]  who's grassroots funding and grassroots really putting up some impressive numbers.
[2:17:22.220 --> 2:17:27.220]  I mean, I've seen some numbers of where you're just 5, 10 points in striking range of her.
[2:17:27.220 --> 2:17:28.220]  Yeah.
[2:17:28.220 --> 2:17:32.220]  A lot of people are saying this and a lot of this information is going out there.
[2:17:32.220 --> 2:17:33.220]  We're active.
[2:17:33.220 --> 2:17:34.220]  We're involved.
[2:17:34.220 --> 2:17:36.220]  If you're going to be lazy and you're not going to do anything,
[2:17:36.220 --> 2:17:37.220]  you're not going to get anywhere.
[2:17:37.220 --> 2:17:38.220]  You're not going to get any numbers.
[2:17:38.220 --> 2:17:39.220]  You're not going to get any improvement.
[2:17:39.220 --> 2:17:41.220]  We have to stay active.
[2:17:41.220 --> 2:17:42.220]  We have to stay engaged.
[2:17:42.220 --> 2:17:44.220]  That's the only way of getting the message out there.
[2:17:44.220 --> 2:17:47.220]  People are tired of seeing gang bangers in their parks.
[2:17:47.220 --> 2:17:50.220]  People are tired of seeing streets not being paved in the state of California.
[2:17:50.220 --> 2:17:54.220]  People are tired of Maxine Waters representing them for 35 years
[2:17:54.220 --> 2:17:56.220]  and not achieving anything in 35 years.
[2:17:56.220 --> 2:17:58.220]  You know, she's failed me my entire life.
[2:17:58.220 --> 2:18:00.220]  I'm only 28 years of age.
[2:18:00.220 --> 2:18:01.220]  She's failed me my entire life.
[2:18:01.220 --> 2:18:06.220]  That is sad to say that your own representative has failed you your entire life.
[2:18:06.220 --> 2:18:07.220]  Absolutely.
[2:18:07.220 --> 2:18:12.220]  And what do you make, though, of Kathy Griffin coming out with this bloody head?
[2:18:12.220 --> 2:18:13.220]  It's so graphic.
[2:18:13.220 --> 2:18:15.220]  She didn't go as far as a lot of hosts and people saying,
[2:18:15.220 --> 2:18:17.220]  I actually killed Trump or let's organize.
[2:18:17.220 --> 2:18:18.220]  Let's kill Trump.
[2:18:18.220 --> 2:18:19.220]  I don't think what she did was criminal.
[2:18:19.220 --> 2:18:20.220]  It was very distasteful.
[2:18:20.220 --> 2:18:23.220]  But why are people finally standing up and finally getting mad?
[2:18:23.220 --> 2:18:25.220]  Because I saw a tipping point the last few weeks
[2:18:25.220 --> 2:18:29.220]  where people now aren't buying any of the BS from MSM.
[2:18:29.220 --> 2:18:31.220]  Yeah, they're realizing.
[2:18:31.220 --> 2:18:32.220]  They're realizing they're waking up.
[2:18:32.220 --> 2:18:36.220]  They're noticing that they can't no longer drink that Kool-Aid.
[2:18:36.220 --> 2:18:37.220]  That's what's happening.
[2:18:37.220 --> 2:18:42.220]  People are so tired of these actors and all this false media, fake media,
[2:18:42.220 --> 2:18:45.220]  making all these lies and not really achieving anything.
[2:18:45.220 --> 2:18:50.220]  I mean, you have my campaign where they turn around and took my announcement
[2:18:50.220 --> 2:18:54.220]  in front of Maxine Waters' house and they turned it as in there were
[2:18:54.220 --> 2:18:55.220]  protesters in front of her house.
[2:18:55.220 --> 2:18:56.220]  There wasn't protesters.
[2:18:56.220 --> 2:18:59.220]  It was an announcement from my campaign in front of her house.
[2:18:59.220 --> 2:19:01.220]  But the media is trying to twist it in a different way.
[2:19:01.220 --> 2:19:02.220]  That's what they do.
[2:19:02.220 --> 2:19:06.220]  If the media really wanted like some of these outlets that are out there,
[2:19:06.220 --> 2:19:10.220]  if they really want Maxine Waters out, they would put my platform out there.
[2:19:10.220 --> 2:19:14.220]  They would make sure they do everything possible and Maxine doesn't get reelected.
[2:19:14.220 --> 2:19:16.220]  But I believe they're conspiring.
[2:19:16.220 --> 2:19:19.220]  They're conspiring with Maxine Waters to help her.
[2:19:19.220 --> 2:19:20.220]  Well, of course they are.
[2:19:20.220 --> 2:19:24.220]  And we've got the Republican establishment trying to shoot down Trump,
[2:19:24.220 --> 2:19:27.220]  putting out all this Russian propaganda, also claiming he's senile.
[2:19:27.220 --> 2:19:29.220]  But it just isn't working.
[2:19:29.220 --> 2:19:33.220]  What do you expect them to do next if they're not successful
[2:19:33.220 --> 2:19:38.220]  in the summer of rage Soros is trying to fund?
[2:19:38.220 --> 2:19:43.220]  Well, first of all, when I went out to Berkeley and I saw all these antifa thugs
[2:19:43.220 --> 2:19:46.220]  attacking people, that was wrong.
[2:19:46.220 --> 2:19:49.220]  What they're doing is they try to censor people's free speech.
[2:19:49.220 --> 2:19:52.220]  They don't respect the Constitution.
[2:19:52.220 --> 2:19:54.220]  They don't respect Americans.
[2:19:54.220 --> 2:19:59.220]  They want to, they want a hostile takeover our country to impose communism.
[2:19:59.220 --> 2:20:01.220]  They don't respect freedom.
[2:20:01.220 --> 2:20:03.220]  My family escaped two different countries.
[2:20:03.220 --> 2:20:06.220]  One country with corruption, Mexico.
[2:20:06.220 --> 2:20:09.220]  The other country, Cuba, communism.
[2:20:09.220 --> 2:20:12.220]  They escaped those countries for a reason.
[2:20:12.220 --> 2:20:13.220]  They left those countries for a reason.
[2:20:13.220 --> 2:20:14.220]  But they came here legally.
[2:20:14.220 --> 2:20:15.220]  They didn't break any laws.
[2:20:15.220 --> 2:20:19.220]  And I think what's happening here, especially in the state of California,
[2:20:19.220 --> 2:20:21.220]  all immigrants get bundled up all together.
[2:20:21.220 --> 2:20:23.220]  And the treat is that there are all illegals.
[2:20:23.220 --> 2:20:25.220]  What about the legal immigrants?
[2:20:25.220 --> 2:20:28.220]  What about the legal immigrants that obey the laws, that pay the fines,
[2:20:28.220 --> 2:20:31.220]  fees, everything that is imposed when you're coming into the country?
[2:20:31.220 --> 2:20:32.220]  And the Democrats don't want that.
[2:20:32.220 --> 2:20:35.220]  They want a permanent underclass in the Republican establishment as well
[2:20:35.220 --> 2:20:36.220]  and exploit it.
[2:20:36.220 --> 2:20:37.220]  Exactly.
[2:20:37.220 --> 2:20:40.220]  We need people that come from Cuba because they understand tyranny
[2:20:40.220 --> 2:20:41.220]  and don't want to live under it.
[2:20:41.220 --> 2:20:45.220]  We need, but then instead, people now come here from tyrannies
[2:20:45.220 --> 2:20:47.220]  like communist China or Eastern Europe.
[2:20:47.220 --> 2:20:49.220]  And then they recreate it.
[2:20:49.220 --> 2:20:51.220]  They reconstruct it.
[2:20:51.220 --> 2:20:54.220]  Don't they understand you fled this because it's bad.
[2:20:54.220 --> 2:20:55.220]  Don't make this country like it.
[2:20:55.220 --> 2:20:57.220]  It's not about what color somebody is.
[2:20:57.220 --> 2:20:58.220]  It's what they're espousing.
[2:20:58.220 --> 2:21:01.220]  We lost the Skype again, the miracle of Skype.
[2:21:01.220 --> 2:21:06.220]  And I think that Omar can also preach to this.
[2:21:06.220 --> 2:21:10.220]  I think that it's gone from a state of people wanting to come to this country
[2:21:10.220 --> 2:21:11.220]  seeking independence.
[2:21:11.220 --> 2:21:13.220]  To get away from the socialism.
[2:21:13.220 --> 2:21:15.220]  Now they want to come here because this is the biggest paycheck.
[2:21:15.220 --> 2:21:16.220]  Exactly.
[2:21:16.220 --> 2:21:17.220]  That was the mindset.
[2:21:17.220 --> 2:21:19.220]  It used to be I'm going to go to America because I want to be independent.
[2:21:19.220 --> 2:21:21.220]  I want to control my own destiny.
[2:21:21.220 --> 2:21:22.220]  I want to be an American.
[2:21:22.220 --> 2:21:24.220]  Now it's I want to go to America.
[2:21:24.220 --> 2:21:25.220]  I want to be dependent.
[2:21:25.220 --> 2:21:26.220]  I want to get a handout.
[2:21:26.220 --> 2:21:27.220]  Exactly.
[2:21:27.220 --> 2:21:28.220]  And that's the state of Carolina.
[2:21:28.220 --> 2:21:29.220]  It's wild.
[2:21:29.220 --> 2:21:30.220]  That's so genius.
[2:21:30.220 --> 2:21:31.220]  Here it is.
[2:21:31.220 --> 2:21:33.220]  It's wild, wild west versus nanny state.
[2:21:33.220 --> 2:21:35.220]  And here's the deal.
[2:21:35.220 --> 2:21:37.220]  Nanny states create a bunch of wimps and collabs.
[2:21:37.220 --> 2:21:39.220]  Yeah, we're wild, wild west, baby.
[2:21:39.220 --> 2:21:41.220]  Don't come here if you don't want it.
[2:21:41.220 --> 2:21:42.220]  Sorry.
[2:21:42.220 --> 2:21:43.220]  Go ahead.
[2:21:43.220 --> 2:21:44.220]  Omar.
[2:21:44.220 --> 2:21:46.220]  That's the thing.
[2:21:46.220 --> 2:21:49.220]  People don't understand that you have to respect the nation's laws.
[2:21:49.220 --> 2:21:51.220]  I mean, we have an immigration process that is so broken,
[2:21:51.220 --> 2:21:53.220]  especially he's broken outside the country.
[2:21:53.220 --> 2:21:57.220]  People are not respecting our country when they come in here illegally.
[2:21:57.220 --> 2:22:00.220]  I mean, they want to turn California like Tijuana.
[2:22:00.220 --> 2:22:01.220]  And that's not okay.
[2:22:01.220 --> 2:22:04.220]  We have to make sure that we're fighting against all this corruption
[2:22:04.220 --> 2:22:06.220]  that is going on in the state of California.
[2:22:06.220 --> 2:22:07.220]  Let me ask you this.
[2:22:07.220 --> 2:22:08.220]  When you talk to illegals,
[2:22:08.220 --> 2:22:11.220]  don't they get the equation like you're fleeing Mexico,
[2:22:11.220 --> 2:22:15.220]  but then you want to come here and follow the same socialist corrupt
[2:22:15.220 --> 2:22:21.220]  big party machine, LFA, Maxine Waters, Dian Feinstein garbage.
[2:22:21.220 --> 2:22:22.220]  Yeah.
[2:22:22.220 --> 2:22:24.220]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[2:22:24.220 --> 2:22:26.220]  They're following the same status quo that's not helping out our
[2:22:26.220 --> 2:22:27.220]  communities.
[2:22:27.220 --> 2:22:30.220]  They're following the same thing that they escaped from in the
[2:22:30.220 --> 2:22:31.220]  first place.
[2:22:31.220 --> 2:22:33.220]  That's what's happening.
[2:22:33.220 --> 2:22:36.220]  I mean, they need to realize, they need to wake up and realize,
[2:22:36.220 --> 2:22:37.220]  and they are, a lot of them are.
[2:22:37.220 --> 2:22:40.220]  I mean, I had a guy that drove all the way from Berkeley, a reform
[2:22:40.220 --> 2:22:45.220]  Democrat who was on Antifa side, who came down to my event and
[2:22:45.220 --> 2:22:47.220]  came down a piece of info wars too.
[2:22:47.220 --> 2:22:49.220]  He saw me on info wars, which was great.
[2:22:49.220 --> 2:22:52.220]  And he drove all the way from Berkeley to Torrance to see me,
[2:22:52.220 --> 2:22:53.220]  to see what I had to say.
[2:22:53.220 --> 2:22:55.220]  This is what's happening right now.
[2:22:55.220 --> 2:22:56.220]  People are waking up.
[2:22:56.220 --> 2:22:57.220]  People are waking up.
[2:22:57.220 --> 2:22:58.220]  That's key.
[2:22:58.220 --> 2:23:00.220]  I never talk about this enough, but I've been told this by
[2:23:00.220 --> 2:23:01.220]  Cernovich.
[2:23:01.220 --> 2:23:02.220]  I've been told this by people in Hollywood.
[2:23:02.220 --> 2:23:03.220]  I've been told this by a lot of folks.
[2:23:03.220 --> 2:23:06.220]  They say, listen, the professors and the liberals, they're all the
[2:23:06.220 --> 2:23:09.220]  old original liberals that meant well or somewhat misguided,
[2:23:09.220 --> 2:23:11.220]  just like Republicans can be.
[2:23:11.220 --> 2:23:14.220]  They're tired of this cult where a professor says, no, we can't
[2:23:14.220 --> 2:23:16.220]  have no whites weekend at the college.
[2:23:16.220 --> 2:23:17.220]  That's racist.
[2:23:17.220 --> 2:23:18.220]  Then they went and fired.
[2:23:18.220 --> 2:23:21.220]  The left, even like Seinfeld going, his daughter says, hey,
[2:23:21.220 --> 2:23:23.220]  we're going to move back to New York so you can meet more boys.
[2:23:23.220 --> 2:23:24.220]  We're out here in the country.
[2:23:24.220 --> 2:23:25.220]  There's no people.
[2:23:25.220 --> 2:23:27.220]  She goes, oh my gosh, girls with boys is sexist.
[2:23:27.220 --> 2:23:29.220]  And he's like, what is this a cult?
[2:23:29.220 --> 2:23:32.220]  I mean, it's gotten so bad that I'm told, and I see the
[2:23:32.220 --> 2:23:35.220]  demographics, a lot of our new listeners are actually leftist.
[2:23:35.220 --> 2:23:38.220]  I even get told by leftist writers and reporters, oh, we really
[2:23:38.220 --> 2:23:39.220]  like what you're doing.
[2:23:39.220 --> 2:23:41.220]  We know you're not racist or all this stuff.
[2:23:41.220 --> 2:23:43.220]  We just have to write this or we get fired.
[2:23:43.220 --> 2:23:44.220]  We actually like what you're doing.
[2:23:44.220 --> 2:23:48.220]  So they see us as the rock stars because we're free because
[2:23:48.220 --> 2:23:50.220]  they're still working for the Daily Beast or whatever.
[2:23:50.220 --> 2:23:51.220]  Go ahead, Omar.
[2:23:51.220 --> 2:23:54.220]  You know, that's what's happening.
[2:23:54.220 --> 2:23:56.220]  We have to make sure that we're representing all Americans.
[2:23:56.220 --> 2:23:59.220]  It's time for us to represent all Americans, especially in
[2:23:59.220 --> 2:24:00.220]  Congress.
[2:24:00.220 --> 2:24:03.220]  Maxine Waters is going out, you know, opening her mouth every
[2:24:03.220 --> 2:24:04.220]  step of the way.
[2:24:04.220 --> 2:24:06.220]  And it's helping me in a lot of ways.
[2:24:06.220 --> 2:24:10.220]  By the way, there's only one person seems more senile than
[2:24:10.220 --> 2:24:11.220]  her.
[2:24:11.220 --> 2:24:13.220]  And that's Nancy Pelosi, who literally like eight times keeps
[2:24:13.220 --> 2:24:15.220]  saying George W. Bush at eight different events is still the
[2:24:15.220 --> 2:24:17.220]  president eight and a half years later.
[2:24:17.220 --> 2:24:20.220]  And then she keeps saying, and then she goes, oh, his names.
[2:24:20.220 --> 2:24:22.220]  I'll put the latest video coming up.
[2:24:22.220 --> 2:24:23.220]  She doesn't even know.
[2:24:23.220 --> 2:24:24.220]  She can't even say Trump.
[2:24:24.220 --> 2:24:25.220]  Yeah.
[2:24:25.220 --> 2:24:28.220]  And Nancy Pelosi also was confused at how Trump didn't take his
[2:24:28.220 --> 2:24:31.220]  first foreign trip in alphabetical order.
[2:24:31.220 --> 2:24:33.220]  I don't know if you've heard that clip.
[2:24:33.220 --> 2:24:35.220]  He was supposed to go to Antarctica first.
[2:24:35.220 --> 2:24:36.220]  Yeah.
[2:24:36.220 --> 2:24:37.220]  He should have gone to Antarctica.
[2:24:37.220 --> 2:24:38.220]  Discovered why the earth is really flat.
[2:24:38.220 --> 2:24:39.220]  Come on, guys.
[2:24:39.220 --> 2:24:43.220]  But, you know, what's amazing to me about what Omar, she
[2:24:43.220 --> 2:24:46.220]  really said that Putin has invaded Antarctica.
[2:24:46.220 --> 2:24:48.220]  It's a litmus test, Alex.
[2:24:48.220 --> 2:24:50.220]  And we talked about this.
[2:24:50.220 --> 2:24:51.220]  I came on the show with you months ago.
[2:24:51.220 --> 2:24:52.220]  We talked about the Trump test.
[2:24:52.220 --> 2:24:54.220]  It's the same kind of thing that's going on right now in the
[2:24:54.220 --> 2:24:58.220]  43rd district of California, which is Maxine Waters versus
[2:24:58.220 --> 2:25:00.220]  Omar Navarro in 2018.
[2:25:00.220 --> 2:25:04.220]  Who in their right mind is going to vote for Maxine Waters?
[2:25:04.220 --> 2:25:06.220]  This is a woman who doesn't live in the district.
[2:25:06.220 --> 2:25:08.220]  This is a woman who's clearly off of a rocker.
[2:25:08.220 --> 2:25:10.220]  This is a woman in 35 years in government hasn't helped the
[2:25:10.220 --> 2:25:13.220]  district at all compared to Omar Navarro, who actually
[2:25:13.220 --> 2:25:15.220]  understands the community.
[2:25:15.220 --> 2:25:20.220]  He lives there, got away from communism, has a great company.
[2:25:20.220 --> 2:25:23.220]  He should walk away with this thing.
[2:25:23.220 --> 2:25:25.220]  It should not even be close.
[2:25:25.220 --> 2:25:26.220]  Exactly.
[2:25:26.220 --> 2:25:29.220]  You've got the old, heartable, senile, entrenched, crazy lady
[2:25:29.220 --> 2:25:32.220]  versus a real American, throw her ass out.
[2:25:32.220 --> 2:25:34.220]  And I'm telling you, and more people are starting to see it.
[2:25:34.220 --> 2:25:36.220]  Shiva is starting to see it on the East Coast.
[2:25:36.220 --> 2:25:38.220]  More people are starting to see this.
[2:25:38.220 --> 2:25:39.220]  Look what Omar Navarro is doing.
[2:25:39.220 --> 2:25:42.220]  This is how you get a name in the hat.
[2:25:42.220 --> 2:25:43.220]  This is how you drain water.
[2:25:43.220 --> 2:25:44.220]  He's running.
[2:25:44.220 --> 2:25:45.220]  He ran once, got a lot.
[2:25:45.220 --> 2:25:46.220]  Now he's running.
[2:25:46.220 --> 2:25:47.220]  He may win this time.
[2:25:47.220 --> 2:25:49.220]  You just keep doing it, doing it, doing it to win.
[2:25:49.220 --> 2:25:51.220]  He's going to win.
[2:25:51.220 --> 2:25:52.220]  He will win.
[2:25:52.220 --> 2:25:53.220]  That's why I'm running.
[2:25:53.220 --> 2:25:56.220]  Omar Interrupted, you were saying that she's really helping you
[2:25:56.220 --> 2:25:58.220]  with the cockamamie stuff she's saying.
[2:25:58.220 --> 2:26:00.220]  I mean, she is helping me in such a big way.
[2:26:00.220 --> 2:26:02.220]  I mean, she's going out there, opening her mouth in a lot of
[2:26:02.220 --> 2:26:03.220]  ways.
[2:26:03.220 --> 2:26:04.220]  She's not helping herself out.
[2:26:04.220 --> 2:26:07.220]  What she's doing is also making herself look like a fool on
[2:26:07.220 --> 2:26:08.220]  national TV.
[2:26:08.220 --> 2:26:10.220]  That's benefiting me and my campaign.
[2:26:10.220 --> 2:26:13.220]  We're going out into the community while she's not even
[2:26:13.220 --> 2:26:14.220]  noticing what she's doing.
[2:26:14.220 --> 2:26:17.220]  All she does is oppose the president, but she's not noticing the
[2:26:17.220 --> 2:26:18.220]  needs of her own community.
[2:26:18.220 --> 2:26:19.220]  That's what I'm doing here.
[2:26:19.220 --> 2:26:20.220]  I'm addressing the needs of the community.
[2:26:20.220 --> 2:26:21.220]  I'd like to challenge Trump.
[2:26:21.220 --> 2:26:24.220]  He ought to come to California to support you and other folks that
[2:26:24.220 --> 2:26:26.220]  are running against Democrats.
[2:26:26.220 --> 2:26:29.220]  You saw the announcement that Corey Lewandowski made.
[2:26:29.220 --> 2:26:31.220]  He basically said, get on the Trump train if you're a Republican
[2:26:31.220 --> 2:26:33.220]  or prepare to lose.
[2:26:33.220 --> 2:26:34.220]  That's the deal.
[2:26:34.220 --> 2:26:37.220]  And Donald Trump has the power of the stump right now.
[2:26:37.220 --> 2:26:40.220]  He can get out and he can say, hey, look, here are local candidates
[2:26:40.220 --> 2:26:42.220]  that are coming up for the midterm elections.
[2:26:42.220 --> 2:26:44.220]  Here are the ones that are on my team.
[2:26:44.220 --> 2:26:45.220]  Here are the ones that want to make them.
[2:26:45.220 --> 2:26:48.220]  If Trump really wants to dominate, he's got his true victory.
[2:26:48.220 --> 2:26:51.220]  We'll be bringing in governors, legislators, and everybody else.
[2:26:51.220 --> 2:26:54.220]  I know he's just so busy with his main focus up there under attack.
[2:26:54.220 --> 2:26:56.220]  It's just that if he created an office, I know they already have it,
[2:26:56.220 --> 2:26:58.220]  the Republican Party sabotaging it.
[2:26:58.220 --> 2:27:00.220]  His own presidential office of outreach.
[2:27:00.220 --> 2:27:03.220]  He could just tweet and have press conferences every few weeks
[2:27:03.220 --> 2:27:04.220]  with folks like Navarro.
[2:27:04.220 --> 2:27:05.220]  Game over, we win.
[2:27:05.220 --> 2:27:06.220]  It's over.
[2:27:06.220 --> 2:27:09.220]  He takes that energy he's got and just gives it to Navarro.
[2:27:09.220 --> 2:27:10.220]  It's over.
[2:27:10.220 --> 2:27:12.220]  What's your confidence level right now?
[2:27:12.220 --> 2:27:14.220]  Omar, mine is high.
[2:27:14.220 --> 2:27:18.220]  Yeah, my confidence has been high for a while now.
[2:27:18.220 --> 2:27:21.220]  Just the amount of support that I've been receiving financially,
[2:27:21.220 --> 2:27:24.220]  people are just coming out and helping me in the campaign.
[2:27:24.220 --> 2:27:27.220]  What we're doing right now, we're doing things that are not being done
[2:27:27.220 --> 2:27:31.220]  in the state of California by weak Republicans who have failed us miserably.
[2:27:31.220 --> 2:27:32.220]  They're not doing anything.
[2:27:32.220 --> 2:27:35.220]  But what we're doing here in the 43rd congressional district,
[2:27:35.220 --> 2:27:36.220]  we're setting a standard.
[2:27:36.220 --> 2:27:39.220]  We're setting a standard that these politicians can't stay in there
[2:27:39.220 --> 2:27:40.220]  and not do anything.
[2:27:40.220 --> 2:27:42.220]  It's time for us to wake them up.
[2:27:42.220 --> 2:27:44.220]  I'm going to shake up some cages here.
[2:27:44.220 --> 2:27:46.220]  That's what I'm doing right now in the state of California.
[2:27:46.220 --> 2:27:51.220]  I'm fighting for every American, not just Republicans and Democrats.
[2:27:51.220 --> 2:27:52.220]  I'm fighting for every American.
[2:27:52.220 --> 2:27:56.220]  It's time to drain the swamp and reclaim the state of California.
[2:27:56.220 --> 2:27:57.220]  And I've said that a thousand times.
[2:27:57.220 --> 2:28:00.220]  The real draining is at the county, city, and district level,
[2:28:00.220 --> 2:28:01.220]  a congressional level.
[2:28:01.220 --> 2:28:02.220]  I mean, we got to do it at the state level.
[2:28:02.220 --> 2:28:03.220]  We got to do it congressionally.
[2:28:03.220 --> 2:28:05.220]  This is where you do it.
[2:28:05.220 --> 2:28:09.220]  Luckily, as Omar was saying, the swamp creatures are showing themselves
[2:28:09.220 --> 2:28:11.220]  on national TV every day.
[2:28:11.220 --> 2:28:12.220]  They're so arrogant.
[2:28:12.220 --> 2:28:13.220]  They don't even know what planet they're on.
[2:28:13.220 --> 2:28:14.220]  And this is the difference, too.
[2:28:14.220 --> 2:28:17.220]  You can kind of see the difference between a Diane Feinstein and a Nancy Pelosi.
[2:28:17.220 --> 2:28:20.220]  Where Diane Feinstein, you know what, she might have a little bit left in the head
[2:28:20.220 --> 2:28:24.220]  enough to say, I'm not going to go on TV every day and bash the president.
[2:28:24.220 --> 2:28:27.220]  That's probably a bad idea for my campaign coming up in the midterms.
[2:28:27.220 --> 2:28:30.220]  Where Nancy Pelosi is such a dingbat, she doesn't even know what's going on.
[2:28:30.220 --> 2:28:33.220]  I mean, probably really has a serious problem like dementia.
[2:28:33.220 --> 2:28:35.220]  No, it's not funny. I've had family with Alzheimer's.
[2:28:35.220 --> 2:28:37.220]  It's sad, but she can't be.
[2:28:37.220 --> 2:28:41.220]  What are we going to do? Alex, they put her in the ring.
[2:28:41.220 --> 2:28:43.220]  I say, let them do what they're doing.
[2:28:43.220 --> 2:28:44.220]  Just let them do what they're doing.
[2:28:44.220 --> 2:28:48.220]  Do you agree, Omar, that the Democrats are committing suicide as a party?
[2:28:48.220 --> 2:28:49.220]  Well, they are committing suicide.
[2:28:49.220 --> 2:28:52.220]  They've been committing suicide with the Latino and Hispanic community,
[2:28:52.220 --> 2:28:54.220]  within the black community, within the Asian community,
[2:28:54.220 --> 2:28:56.220]  every freaking community.
[2:28:56.220 --> 2:28:58.220]  They've been destroying themselves.
[2:28:58.220 --> 2:28:59.220]  They're not doing anything.
[2:28:59.220 --> 2:29:01.220]  They're simply just walking on themselves.
[2:29:01.220 --> 2:29:04.220]  And they're not realizing that they're not serving what they're doing.
[2:29:04.220 --> 2:29:05.220]  They're not doing anything.
[2:29:05.220 --> 2:29:07.220]  And what people are waking up.
[2:29:07.220 --> 2:29:09.220]  People have been waking up.
[2:29:09.220 --> 2:29:11.220]  If you walk around, you talk to people.
[2:29:11.220 --> 2:29:12.220]  You knock doors.
[2:29:12.220 --> 2:29:13.220]  You have events.
[2:29:13.220 --> 2:29:15.220]  You invite people, meet and greet.
[2:29:15.220 --> 2:29:17.220]  You stay involved and engaged.
[2:29:17.220 --> 2:29:20.220]  You realize that we have a strong opportunity here
[2:29:20.220 --> 2:29:22.220]  in the 43rd congressional district.
[2:29:22.220 --> 2:29:24.220]  This is the model.
[2:29:24.220 --> 2:29:25.220]  This is the model.
[2:29:25.220 --> 2:29:27.220]  The model that's going to wake the rest of us.
[2:29:27.220 --> 2:29:31.220]  The establishment, arrogant fossils that don't even know what planet they're on,
[2:29:31.220 --> 2:29:33.220]  that think, you know, islands are floating, all the rest of it.
[2:29:33.220 --> 2:29:36.220]  We've got to call the Pelosi's and the waters out.
[2:29:36.220 --> 2:29:39.220]  I want to come back with that intro we've got of dumb Democrats.
[2:29:39.220 --> 2:29:40.220]  I forget the exact name.
[2:29:40.220 --> 2:29:43.220]  I mean, to see Pelosi and waters.
[2:29:43.220 --> 2:29:45.220]  I mean, these women are on other planets, man.
[2:29:45.220 --> 2:29:46.220]  And it's dangerous.
[2:29:46.220 --> 2:29:48.220]  And they're calling Trump senile.
[2:29:48.220 --> 2:29:50.220]  They got to run circles around all of us.
[2:29:50.220 --> 2:29:57.220]  Stay with us on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:20.220 --> 2:30:25.220]  We're approaching the two migrant men and accusing them of being thieves.
[2:30:25.220 --> 2:30:26.220]  Thieves.
[2:30:26.220 --> 2:30:28.220]  Put them back.
[2:30:28.220 --> 2:30:29.220]  Now.
[2:30:29.220 --> 2:30:31.220]  Put them back now.
[2:30:31.220 --> 2:30:32.220]  Now.
[2:30:32.220 --> 2:30:36.220]  Now one of the migrants is seen holding a stuffed blue Smurf toy
[2:30:36.220 --> 2:30:39.220]  that he had just stolen from the memorial.
[2:30:39.220 --> 2:30:40.220]  I'm not going to **** out of the pair of you.
[2:30:40.220 --> 2:30:41.220]  How was that?
[2:30:41.220 --> 2:30:45.220]  Now, in case you missed that, the man from Manchester told the Muslim migrants,
[2:30:45.220 --> 2:30:48.220]  I'll knock this **** out of the pair of you.
[2:30:48.220 --> 2:30:52.220]  That not all of the citizens of Manchester are liberal cucks.
[2:30:52.220 --> 2:31:21.220]  And you can watch the video in its entirety right now at info wars.com.
[2:31:22.220 --> 2:31:23.220]  Thanks for watching.
[2:31:23.220 --> 2:31:52.220]  Thanks for watching.
[2:31:53.220 --> 2:31:55.220]  You're funding the tip of the spear in the info war.
[2:31:55.220 --> 2:31:58.220]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[2:31:58.220 --> 2:32:00.220]  Take action now before we sell out.
[2:32:00.220 --> 2:32:03.220]  After being sold out for months, our best selling super blue fluoride toothpaste
[2:32:03.220 --> 2:32:06.220]  is now back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[2:32:06.220 --> 2:32:08.220]  Research across the board is clear.
[2:32:08.220 --> 2:32:11.220]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream
[2:32:11.220 --> 2:32:13.220]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[2:32:13.220 --> 2:32:17.220]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns
[2:32:17.220 --> 2:32:20.220]  that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[2:32:20.220 --> 2:32:23.220]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[2:32:23.220 --> 2:32:27.220]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[2:32:27.220 --> 2:32:31.220]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times
[2:32:31.220 --> 2:32:34.220]  to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[2:32:34.220 --> 2:32:38.220]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include
[2:32:38.220 --> 2:32:42.220]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more
[2:32:42.220 --> 2:32:46.220]  due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong
[2:32:46.220 --> 2:32:47.220]  for some of their children.
[2:32:47.220 --> 2:32:50.220]  We've created the new bubble gum flavored super blue that is spearmint free.
[2:32:50.220 --> 2:32:53.220]  Learn more about the new bubble gum flavored super blue toothpaste
[2:32:53.220 --> 2:32:57.220]  and more at infowarslife.com and support the info war
[2:32:57.220 --> 2:32:59.220]  while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[2:33:01.220 --> 2:33:13.220]  This is an island that at its widest level is what 12 miles from shore to shore
[2:33:13.220 --> 2:33:21.220]  and at its smallest level or smallest location
[2:33:21.220 --> 2:33:29.220]  it's seven miles between one shore and the other.
[2:33:29.220 --> 2:33:31.220]  Is that correct?
[2:33:31.220 --> 2:33:37.220]  I don't have the exact dimensions but to your point sir I think Guam is a small island.
[2:33:37.220 --> 2:33:46.220]  My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated
[2:33:46.220 --> 2:33:50.220]  that it will tip over and capsize.
[2:33:57.220 --> 2:33:59.220]  I stand here as a freed slave.
[2:33:59.220 --> 2:34:04.220]  We've seen nothing that we can work but I can work with President Bush on
[2:34:04.220 --> 2:34:09.220]  and I'm disappointed because I thought that there might be some interest
[2:34:09.220 --> 2:34:11.220]  because of what he said in the campaign.
[2:34:11.220 --> 2:34:13.220]  What are we going to do?
[2:34:13.220 --> 2:34:19.220]  How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting
[2:34:19.220 --> 2:34:24.220]  whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims
[2:34:24.220 --> 2:34:29.220]  or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin
[2:34:29.220 --> 2:34:36.220]  and knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and DNC
[2:34:36.220 --> 2:34:44.220]  and knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children
[2:34:44.220 --> 2:34:47.220]  and families in...
[2:34:47.220 --> 2:34:49.220]  What is Aleppo?
[2:34:49.220 --> 2:34:51.220]  Yeah, in Aleppo.
[2:34:51.220 --> 2:34:58.220]  You are correct.
[2:34:58.220 --> 2:35:05.220]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is
[2:35:05.220 --> 2:35:10.220]  continuing to advance into Korea.
[2:35:13.220 --> 2:35:19.220]  And now the eighth time that Pelosi, this is the eighth time Pelosi
[2:35:19.220 --> 2:35:21.220]  said that she doesn't know who the president is.
[2:35:21.220 --> 2:35:24.220]  Thank you. This is not about abortion.
[2:35:24.220 --> 2:35:29.220]  For decades I've served in Congress and for decades I've had to fight the Republicans
[2:35:29.220 --> 2:35:35.220]  opposition to birth control, contraception and family planning.
[2:35:35.220 --> 2:35:38.220]  They do not believe in it.
[2:35:38.220 --> 2:35:43.220]  And a lot of those people voted for, what's his name?
[2:35:43.220 --> 2:35:45.220]  Yeah.
[2:35:45.220 --> 2:35:47.220]  The President of the United States.
[2:35:47.220 --> 2:35:49.220]  I'll honor the position, you know.
[2:35:49.220 --> 2:35:51.220]  See the key...
[2:35:51.220 --> 2:35:53.220]  So now she's covering her Alzheimer's with...
[2:35:53.220 --> 2:35:55.220]  Oh, Hillary.
[2:35:55.220 --> 2:35:57.220]  It's because I don't like Trump.
[2:35:57.220 --> 2:35:59.220]  I'm having seizures.
[2:35:59.220 --> 2:36:01.220]  I'm fine.
[2:36:01.220 --> 2:36:03.220]  She didn't have...
[2:36:03.220 --> 2:36:05.220]  He had to fall over on the ground.
[2:36:05.220 --> 2:36:07.220]  Alex is fine.
[2:36:07.220 --> 2:36:09.220]  Alex is fine right now.
[2:36:09.220 --> 2:36:11.220]  Alex is okay.
[2:36:11.220 --> 2:36:13.220]  Alex is not falling over right now.
[2:36:13.220 --> 2:36:15.220]  He's not rolling off the stage.
[2:36:15.220 --> 2:36:17.220]  Alex is fine. Alex is fine.
[2:36:17.220 --> 2:36:19.220]  You're fine, Alex.
[2:36:19.220 --> 2:36:21.220]  Look, Alex is fine.
[2:36:21.220 --> 2:36:23.220]  She didn't fall out.
[2:36:23.220 --> 2:36:25.220]  Alex is not falling over the stage.
[2:36:25.220 --> 2:36:27.220]  The stage is, everything is fine here right now.
[2:36:27.220 --> 2:36:29.220]  Alex has not gone crazy.
[2:36:29.220 --> 2:36:31.220]  Everything is perfectly fine.
[2:36:31.220 --> 2:36:33.220]  Alex did not fall down.
[2:36:33.220 --> 2:36:35.220]  Hillary is perfectly fine.
[2:36:35.220 --> 2:36:37.220]  We have the clips of like CNN going conspiracy theories that Hillary fell down
[2:36:37.220 --> 2:36:39.220]  and they would cut the end off when she fell down.
[2:36:39.220 --> 2:36:41.220]  Remember?
[2:36:41.220 --> 2:36:43.220]  She wears her seizure glasses in public, Alex.
[2:36:43.220 --> 2:36:45.220]  It's like... Listen.
[2:36:45.220 --> 2:36:47.220]  He never fell down.
[2:36:47.220 --> 2:36:49.220]  Okay, Alex is fine.
[2:36:49.220 --> 2:36:51.220]  He's not falling down.
[2:36:51.220 --> 2:36:53.220]  He's not tearing apart the studio right now.
[2:36:53.220 --> 2:36:55.220]  Stop playing. Stop playing.
[2:36:55.220 --> 2:36:57.220]  Alex is not...
[2:36:57.220 --> 2:36:59.220]  Okay.
[2:36:59.220 --> 2:37:01.220]  All right, guys.
[2:37:01.220 --> 2:37:03.220]  Alex has been in his seat this entire
[2:37:03.220 --> 2:37:05.220]  segment. Alex has been on the air.
[2:37:05.220 --> 2:37:07.220]  He's contained himself.
[2:37:07.220 --> 2:37:09.220]  There's nothing to see here.
[2:37:09.220 --> 2:37:11.220]  Hillary Clinton is not coughing.
[2:37:11.220 --> 2:37:13.220]  She did not fall over in this video.
[2:37:13.220 --> 2:37:15.220]  I want to be perfectly clear.
[2:37:15.220 --> 2:37:17.220]  This is not Hillary Clinton leaning against a rail
[2:37:17.220 --> 2:37:19.220]  because she can't stand.
[2:37:19.220 --> 2:37:21.220]  This is not Hillary Clinton falling face first
[2:37:21.220 --> 2:37:23.220]  into the van.
[2:37:23.220 --> 2:37:25.220]  She's clearly totally unconscious there.
[2:37:25.220 --> 2:37:27.220]  You are not seeing this.
[2:37:27.220 --> 2:37:29.220]  Back to what Nancy Pelosi just said, Alex.
[2:37:29.220 --> 2:37:31.220]  They lie by omission.
[2:37:31.220 --> 2:37:33.220]  See?
[2:37:33.220 --> 2:37:35.220]  She doesn't have seizures.
[2:37:35.220 --> 2:37:37.220]  She just wears seizure glasses when she's out in public.
[2:37:37.220 --> 2:37:39.220]  Nancy Pelosi says,
[2:37:39.220 --> 2:37:41.220]  we're anti-abortion.
[2:37:41.220 --> 2:37:43.220]  No, what you don't understand is
[2:37:43.220 --> 2:37:45.220]  we're anti-tax payers funding it.
[2:37:45.220 --> 2:37:47.220]  Yeah, but you claim...
[2:37:47.220 --> 2:37:49.220]  I haven't fallen over once today.
[2:37:49.220 --> 2:37:51.220]  Alex has not fallen over once.
[2:37:51.220 --> 2:37:53.220]  Alex is not laughing right now.
[2:37:53.220 --> 2:37:55.220]  He's not...
[2:37:55.220 --> 2:37:57.220]  He's not hysterical.
[2:37:57.220 --> 2:37:59.220]  He's knocking over all the products
[2:37:59.220 --> 2:38:01.220]  that the info...
[2:38:01.220 --> 2:38:03.220]  I'm in a bad mood because of that big
[2:38:03.220 --> 2:38:05.220]  court defeat yesterday.
[2:38:05.220 --> 2:38:07.220]  Alex did not just knock over his side table
[2:38:07.220 --> 2:38:09.220]  all the info wars products over there.
[2:38:09.220 --> 2:38:11.220]  He knocked over the z-shield, the lung clench,
[2:38:11.220 --> 2:38:13.220]  the bio-PCA.
[2:38:13.220 --> 2:38:15.220]  What else you got? The selenium over there.
[2:38:15.220 --> 2:38:17.220]  Here's the deal. Republicans always have
[2:38:17.220 --> 2:38:19.220]  two tied-of-shirts.
[2:38:19.220 --> 2:38:21.220]  And they get a little nervous.
[2:38:21.220 --> 2:38:23.220]  We've got to have some fun with these people
[2:38:23.220 --> 2:38:25.220]  because it just triggered me watching how stupid they are.
[2:38:25.220 --> 2:38:27.220]  Well, they're completely losing, Alex. They really are.
[2:38:27.220 --> 2:38:29.220]  They really... I've got a memo here.
[2:38:29.220 --> 2:38:31.220]  You know I didn't fall down once.
[2:38:31.220 --> 2:38:33.220]  Yeah, you didn't fall down once.
[2:38:33.220 --> 2:38:35.220]  You were in your seat the entire segment.
[2:38:35.220 --> 2:38:37.220]  You can't prove it.
[2:38:37.220 --> 2:38:39.220]  I've never had seizures.
[2:38:39.220 --> 2:38:41.220]  And by the way, I'm not making fun of people to have them.
[2:38:41.220 --> 2:38:43.220]  The point is she's having one at one.
[2:38:43.220 --> 2:38:45.220]  She wears seizure glasses.
[2:38:45.220 --> 2:38:47.220]  Alex, again, these people are losing.
[2:38:47.220 --> 2:38:49.220]  You mean she's not John Lennon?
[2:38:49.220 --> 2:38:51.220]  It's not even possible.
[2:38:51.220 --> 2:38:53.220]  I could pay almost came off.
[2:38:53.220 --> 2:38:55.220]  Sorry.
[2:38:55.220 --> 2:38:57.220]  Omar Navarro does not...
[2:38:57.220 --> 2:38:59.220]  By the way, you actually saw me fall off my chair for real this Friday.
[2:38:59.220 --> 2:39:01.220]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[2:39:01.220 --> 2:39:03.220]  I don't know. I never saw anything.
[2:39:03.220 --> 2:39:05.220]  They're going to attack you for being on the show, which is good.
[2:39:05.220 --> 2:39:07.220]  Finishing up with a great work you're doing.
[2:39:07.220 --> 2:39:09.220]  Running for Congress against Maxine Waters,
[2:39:09.220 --> 2:39:11.220]  who is a real...
[2:39:11.220 --> 2:39:13.220]  Swamp creature.
[2:39:13.220 --> 2:39:15.220]  A real gangster.
[2:39:15.220 --> 2:39:17.220]  You've got the floor for five minutes.
[2:39:17.220 --> 2:39:19.220]  I apologize for ranting.
[2:39:19.220 --> 2:39:21.220]  Tell us about your websites, your Twitter, your Facebook, how we support you.
[2:39:21.220 --> 2:39:23.220]  A real winner.
[2:39:23.220 --> 2:39:25.220]  Go ahead.
[2:39:25.220 --> 2:39:27.220]  You guys can visit me at OmarNavarro.com.
[2:39:27.220 --> 2:39:29.220]  You can also follow me at Twitter.
[2:39:29.220 --> 2:39:31.220]  Press GOP.
[2:39:31.220 --> 2:39:33.220]  Facebook is facebook.com
[2:39:33.220 --> 2:39:35.220]  slash press GOP.

[2:39:39.220 --> 2:39:41.220]  You guys can go on there.
[2:39:41.220 --> 2:39:43.220]  Follow me on Instagram.
[2:39:43.220 --> 2:39:45.220]  I'm everywhere.
[2:39:45.220 --> 2:39:47.220]  I'm making sure that my name is being heard.
[2:39:47.220 --> 2:39:49.220]  That I'm being heard and I don't want to be censored.
[2:39:49.220 --> 2:39:51.220]  Be some of these media outlets that censor us
[2:39:51.220 --> 2:39:53.220]  and what we're doing out here.
[2:39:53.220 --> 2:39:55.220]  We have to make sure we're doing whatever we can
[2:39:55.220 --> 2:39:57.220]  to get the movies out there.
[2:39:57.220 --> 2:39:59.220]  I'm sorry. She's going on, Omar.
[2:39:59.220 --> 2:40:01.220]  This is how Alex takes victory, okay?
[2:40:01.220 --> 2:40:03.220]  This is how Alex takes victory right now.
[2:40:03.220 --> 2:40:05.220]  This is how Alex takes victory right now.
[2:40:05.220 --> 2:40:07.220]  So Alex has now seen one of our...
[2:40:07.220 --> 2:40:09.220]  He knows that Omar is going to beat Maxine Waters.
[2:40:09.220 --> 2:40:11.220]  This is how Alex has victory right here.
[2:40:11.220 --> 2:40:13.220]  Keep going, Omar.
[2:40:13.220 --> 2:40:15.220]  No, yeah.
[2:40:15.220 --> 2:40:17.220]  We're making sure that we're getting the job done.
[2:40:17.220 --> 2:40:19.220]  People are tired of these politicians
[2:40:19.220 --> 2:40:21.220]  underserving their communities.
[2:40:21.220 --> 2:40:23.220]  It's time to wake up.
[2:40:23.220 --> 2:40:25.220]  We have to support the Second Amendment.
[2:40:25.220 --> 2:40:27.220]  We have to make sure we're supporting legal immigration.
[2:40:27.220 --> 2:40:29.220]  We're sure that we're creating jobs.
[2:40:29.220 --> 2:40:31.220]  We're sustaining business.
[2:40:31.220 --> 2:40:33.220]  I agree, but you admit Hillary never fell down.
[2:40:33.220 --> 2:40:35.220]  That was fake news by InfoWars.
[2:40:35.220 --> 2:40:37.220]  What do you mean?
[2:40:37.220 --> 2:40:39.220]  She never fell down?
[2:40:39.220 --> 2:40:41.220]  She never fell down when we know you're mainstream.
[2:40:41.220 --> 2:40:43.220]  She never fell down.
[2:40:43.220 --> 2:40:45.220]  There you go. Good. Good. That makes her casting.
[2:40:45.220 --> 2:40:47.220]  Omar, you know...
[2:40:47.220 --> 2:40:49.220]  I'm sorry. I'm in a little bit of a good mood today. I apologize.
[2:40:49.220 --> 2:40:51.220]  Hey, seriously though, how do people help you win 100%?
[2:40:51.220 --> 2:40:53.220]  No, really.
[2:40:53.220 --> 2:40:55.220]  Engaging in the campaign,
[2:40:55.220 --> 2:40:57.220]  I need to raise money.
[2:40:57.220 --> 2:40:59.220]  I need help with raising money in the campaign.
[2:40:59.220 --> 2:41:01.220]  That's the biggest factor.
[2:41:01.220 --> 2:41:03.220]  It's sad to say that we have to raise money,
[2:41:03.220 --> 2:41:05.220]  but we have to volunteer in the campaign.
[2:41:05.220 --> 2:41:07.220]  If they live locally, they can help out in such a big way.
[2:41:07.220 --> 2:41:09.220]  If they live far away, they can still help out.
[2:41:09.220 --> 2:41:11.220]  They can make phone calls when it gets closer to the election.
[2:41:11.220 --> 2:41:13.220]  There's going to be a lot of work,
[2:41:13.220 --> 2:41:15.220]  a lot of ground game that we need to cover,
[2:41:15.220 --> 2:41:17.220]  but right now we're fundraising, and that's a big factor.
[2:41:17.220 --> 2:41:19.220]  It takes money to win.
[2:41:19.220 --> 2:41:21.220]  Unfortunately, I don't want to be outspent
[2:41:21.220 --> 2:41:23.220]  by Maxine Waters.
[2:41:23.220 --> 2:41:25.220]  If people want to really take a jab at Maxine Waters
[2:41:25.220 --> 2:41:27.220]  and everything she's saying
[2:41:27.220 --> 2:41:29.220]  against President Trump,
[2:41:29.220 --> 2:41:31.220]  donate to my campaign.
[2:41:31.220 --> 2:41:33.220]  Make sure I hold her accountable
[2:41:33.220 --> 2:41:35.220]  for all her actions and everything.
[2:41:35.220 --> 2:41:37.220]  Well, listen, you're doing a great job.
[2:41:37.220 --> 2:41:39.220]  I look forward to having you back.
[2:41:39.220 --> 2:41:41.220]  I look forward to having you back on because...
[2:41:41.220 --> 2:41:43.220]  I do think she is saying right now.
[2:41:43.220 --> 2:41:45.220]  So that's what I...
[2:41:45.220 --> 2:41:47.220]  Absolutely. Your sky's breaking up.
[2:41:47.220 --> 2:41:49.220]  Omar, thank you. We'll talk to you again soon. People should support you.
[2:41:49.220 --> 2:41:51.220]  I've watched a lot of his videos, his demonstrations,
[2:41:51.220 --> 2:41:53.220]  and he's a really sharp, on-target guy.
[2:41:53.220 --> 2:41:55.220]  You could tell he's not reading off a teleprompter.
[2:41:55.220 --> 2:41:57.220]  He doesn't have people telling him what to say.
[2:41:57.220 --> 2:41:59.220]  He's a patriot.
[2:41:59.220 --> 2:42:01.220]  His parents fled communism,
[2:42:01.220 --> 2:42:03.220]  and this is the type of guy we need to put in Congress.
[2:42:03.220 --> 2:42:05.220]  We want real change.
[2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:07.220]  I like the story he told earlier
[2:42:07.220 --> 2:42:09.220]  about the guy that came out to see him speak.
[2:42:09.220 --> 2:42:11.220]  He traveled to see him speak.
[2:42:11.220 --> 2:42:13.220]  That's the thing is people out there
[2:42:13.220 --> 2:42:15.220]  don't understand how they can resonate with people.
[2:42:15.220 --> 2:42:17.220]  You might be sitting at the lunch table at work or something.
[2:42:17.220 --> 2:42:19.220]  I just have a seizure.
[2:42:19.220 --> 2:42:21.220]  But you might hear somebody say
[2:42:21.220 --> 2:42:23.220]  some liberal nonsense across the table
[2:42:23.220 --> 2:42:25.220]  and you might just speak out and say,
[2:42:25.220 --> 2:42:27.220]  hey, you know, that's not true.
[2:42:27.220 --> 2:42:29.220]  You just might be randomly chopping the president's head off.
[2:42:29.220 --> 2:42:31.220]  It's no big deal.
[2:42:31.220 --> 2:42:33.220]  That's a perfect example.
[2:42:33.220 --> 2:42:35.220]  You're just calling for jihadists to kill everybody and race for.
[2:42:35.220 --> 2:42:37.220]  But you're liberal, so it's okay.
[2:42:37.220 --> 2:42:39.220]  This is our path to victory.
[2:42:39.220 --> 2:42:41.220]  They've shown themselves. They're so crazy.
[2:42:41.220 --> 2:42:43.220]  All you have to do is speak up.
[2:42:43.220 --> 2:42:45.220]  It's like you said. It's sending out pings.
[2:42:45.220 --> 2:42:47.220]  It's resonating with people saying,
[2:42:47.220 --> 2:42:49.220]  hey, we are in the majority now.
[2:42:49.220 --> 2:42:51.220]  We got the president in.
[2:42:51.220 --> 2:42:53.220]  We can elect local leaders in the midterm elections.
[2:42:53.220 --> 2:42:55.220]  We can actually take this country back.
[2:42:55.220 --> 2:42:57.220]  We can actually make America great again.
[2:42:57.220 --> 2:42:59.220]  Not a Russian pun.
[2:42:59.220 --> 2:43:01.220]  Exactly. His skype's been coming in and out.
[2:43:01.220 --> 2:43:03.220]  But Omar Navarro, you're back with us running for Congress.
[2:43:03.220 --> 2:43:05.220]  I guess one of the most deadly swamp creatures ever seen.
[2:43:05.220 --> 2:43:07.220]  The vaunted Maxine Waters.
[2:43:07.220 --> 2:43:09.220]  Deadly because she's like,
[2:43:09.220 --> 2:43:11.220]  has no brain and just like a flailing octopus creature.
[2:43:11.220 --> 2:43:13.220]  She's a millennial.
[2:43:13.220 --> 2:43:15.220]  She's a...
[2:43:15.220 --> 2:43:17.220]  Hey, stay wild, millennial.
[2:43:17.220 --> 2:43:19.220]  78-year-old millennial.
[2:43:19.220 --> 2:43:21.220]  Literal mummy. They like drug out of...
[2:43:21.220 --> 2:43:23.220]  Don't have a frozen animation.
[2:43:23.220 --> 2:43:25.220]  Sorry, Mr. Navarro, go ahead.
[2:43:25.220 --> 2:43:27.220]  Yeah, you know, Maxine Waters says
[2:43:27.220 --> 2:43:29.220]  that she's a millennial candidate.
[2:43:29.220 --> 2:43:31.220]  She's not the millennial candidate.
[2:43:31.220 --> 2:43:33.220]  Obviously, there's a millennial that's challenging her
[2:43:33.220 --> 2:43:35.220]  going up against her next year. Not only that last year.
[2:43:35.220 --> 2:43:37.220]  I mean, if she was really a millennial candidate,
[2:43:37.220 --> 2:43:39.220]  there wouldn't be a millennial challenging her.
[2:43:39.220 --> 2:43:41.220]  Common sense.
[2:43:41.220 --> 2:43:43.220]  You're being a conspiracy theorist.
[2:43:43.220 --> 2:43:45.220]  Maxine Waters isn't under 30 years of age, sir.
[2:43:45.220 --> 2:43:47.220]  Well, that's what she thinks.
[2:43:47.220 --> 2:43:49.220]  She thinks she's under 30 years of age.
[2:43:49.220 --> 2:43:51.220]  Hold on a second.
[2:43:51.220 --> 2:43:53.220]  There's a new bylaw, I think, in California
[2:43:53.220 --> 2:43:55.220]  that if your wig is actually...
[2:43:55.220 --> 2:43:57.220]  She identifies as a 30-year-old.
[2:43:57.220 --> 2:43:59.220]  Well, her wig is actually only about 15, 20 years old.
[2:43:59.220 --> 2:44:01.220]  The wig identifies as a millennial.
[2:44:01.220 --> 2:44:03.220]  So the wig identifies as a millennial.
[2:44:03.220 --> 2:44:05.220]  She's now become part of the wig.
[2:44:05.220 --> 2:44:07.220]  The wig is now surgically attached to her head.
[2:44:07.220 --> 2:44:09.220]  So now she can actually identify as a millennial.
[2:44:09.220 --> 2:44:11.220]  Well, you can look at...
[2:44:11.220 --> 2:44:13.220]  You can look at Pelosi.
[2:44:13.220 --> 2:44:15.220]  She's injecting growth hormone with a turkey baster.
[2:44:15.220 --> 2:44:17.220]  I mean, she's got, like,
[2:44:17.220 --> 2:44:19.220]  a body of an 18-year-old
[2:44:19.220 --> 2:44:21.220]  to tell she's got this shriveled braid.
[2:44:21.220 --> 2:44:23.220]  Then they've got these tranny look-alikes
[2:44:23.220 --> 2:44:25.220]  running around saying, kill the president.
[2:44:25.220 --> 2:44:27.220]  Can't be griffin'.
[2:44:27.220 --> 2:44:29.220]  I'm not against trannies, but literally,
[2:44:29.220 --> 2:44:31.220]  this woman looks like a tranny.
[2:44:31.220 --> 2:44:33.220]  You could actually have a good...
[2:44:33.220 --> 2:44:35.220]  Pretty hot tranny, actually.
[2:44:35.220 --> 2:44:37.220]  A Halloween program with Nancy Pelosi,
[2:44:37.220 --> 2:44:39.220]  Diane Feinstein, and Maxine Waters.
[2:44:39.220 --> 2:44:41.220]  Those are, like, monster-looking things.
[2:44:43.220 --> 2:44:45.220]  I was born in love to debate any of them.
[2:44:45.220 --> 2:44:47.220]  I'll take them down in seconds.
[2:44:47.220 --> 2:44:49.220]  Oh, what happens, though?
[2:44:49.220 --> 2:44:51.220]  You've challenged her, dude.
[2:44:51.220 --> 2:44:53.220]  Look at her, dude.
[2:44:53.220 --> 2:44:55.220]  We can't beat those people.
[2:44:57.220 --> 2:44:59.220]  I'm sorry, radio listeners.
[2:44:59.220 --> 2:45:01.220]  We're looking at pictures of Nancy Pelosi.
[2:45:01.220 --> 2:45:03.220]  Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
[2:45:03.220 --> 2:45:05.220]  Oh, hey, by the way,
[2:45:05.220 --> 2:45:07.220]  I might as well just say this now while we're off the rails.
[2:45:07.220 --> 2:45:09.220]  Oh, it says, off the tracks now.
[2:45:09.220 --> 2:45:11.220]  There's no teleprompter,
[2:45:11.220 --> 2:45:13.220]  but occasionally they give me messages like,
[2:45:13.220 --> 2:45:15.220]  you might want to plug, or we got a guest coming up.
[2:45:15.220 --> 2:45:17.220]  But now, this is only episode one,
[2:45:17.220 --> 2:45:19.220]  so off the tracks now.
[2:45:19.220 --> 2:45:21.220]  Can we bring the camera in here to cover it?
[2:45:21.220 --> 2:45:23.220]  I had a real memo here that we wanted to cover,
[2:45:23.220 --> 2:45:25.220]  and we're totally off the track.
[2:45:25.220 --> 2:45:27.220]  Hey, since we're off the tracks, though,
[2:45:27.220 --> 2:45:29.220]  I might as well say now,
[2:45:29.220 --> 2:45:31.220]  we've been working on this. Omar,
[2:45:31.220 --> 2:45:33.220]  I've been talking to you about this.
[2:45:33.220 --> 2:45:35.220]  This was kind of my brainchild.
[2:45:35.220 --> 2:45:37.220]  This is my brain and one of our great people
[2:45:37.220 --> 2:45:39.220]  in the graphic department, Walker.
[2:45:39.220 --> 2:45:41.220]  Mad Maxine, Fury Road,
[2:45:41.220 --> 2:45:43.220]  the movie will be out tomorrow.
[2:45:43.220 --> 2:45:45.220]  Mad Maxine, Fury Road.
[2:45:45.220 --> 2:45:47.220]  This is something that we've been working on for a long time.
[2:45:47.220 --> 2:45:49.220]  Don't give the name away.
[2:45:49.220 --> 2:45:51.220]  Darren McBreen, I tip my hat.
[2:45:51.220 --> 2:45:53.220]  He's did an amazing job. It's Mad Maxine.
[2:45:53.220 --> 2:45:55.220]  It's Mad Maxine. No, it is. It's her in the movie.
[2:45:55.220 --> 2:45:57.220]  And it's her in the movie. She's the main character.
[2:45:57.220 --> 2:45:59.220]  We put her head on the movie.
[2:45:59.220 --> 2:46:01.220]  It's going to be great. I think she's hot.
[2:46:01.220 --> 2:46:03.220]  I'm excited to see that.
[2:46:03.220 --> 2:46:05.220]  I'm looking forward to it.
[2:46:05.220 --> 2:46:07.220]  Hey, listen, great job, Omar Navarro.
[2:46:07.220 --> 2:46:09.220]  Congressman, we salute you, sir.
[2:46:09.220 --> 2:46:11.220]  Thank you.
[2:46:11.220 --> 2:46:13.220]  And I invite you guys to come to California.
[2:46:13.220 --> 2:46:15.220]  We want to come. California?
[2:46:15.220 --> 2:46:17.220]  I want the mariachi band.
[2:46:17.220 --> 2:46:19.220]  No, only tickle. Do not squeeze them.
[2:46:19.220 --> 2:46:21.220]  Thank you. We appreciate that.
[2:46:21.220 --> 2:46:23.220]  That's a ripping off an old Joe Rogan job.
[2:46:23.220 --> 2:46:25.220]  He'll win them.
[2:46:25.220 --> 2:46:27.220]  I'm sure you will. We love you. Bye, Omar.
[2:46:27.220 --> 2:46:29.220]  No, Omar is a true warrior
[2:46:29.220 --> 2:46:31.220]  and a true representative.
[2:46:31.220 --> 2:46:33.220]  He had to be here today when I just can't help it.
[2:46:33.220 --> 2:46:35.220]  It's okay, Alex. We're having great victories
[2:46:35.220 --> 2:46:37.220]  and Omar is a case in point.
[2:46:37.220 --> 2:46:39.220]  Yeah, I mean, we've had some great victories
[2:46:39.220 --> 2:46:41.220]  and the best victories are
[2:46:41.220 --> 2:46:43.220]  the little private ones you don't talk about.
[2:46:43.220 --> 2:46:45.220]  You just savor.
[2:46:45.220 --> 2:46:47.220]  And they just watch the media completely silent
[2:46:47.220 --> 2:46:49.220]  not knowing what to do.
[2:46:49.220 --> 2:46:51.220]  That's the Kermit the Frog meme, Alex.
[2:46:51.220 --> 2:46:53.220]  Do you know about this? No, I don't know about it.
[2:46:53.220 --> 2:46:55.220]  That's none of my business.
[2:46:55.220 --> 2:46:57.220]  Oh my goodness.
[2:46:57.220 --> 2:46:59.220]  Hey, you know what, Alex? We have the power
[2:46:59.220 --> 2:47:01.220]  of Isengard. Here's what I'm going to do.
[2:47:01.220 --> 2:47:03.220]  I'm going to get you back on the tracks, all right?
[2:47:03.220 --> 2:47:05.220]  I want you to either plug right now
[2:47:05.220 --> 2:47:07.220]  or let's talk about the terrorist
[2:47:07.220 --> 2:47:09.220]  attack that was thwarted in D.C.
[2:47:09.220 --> 2:47:11.220]  Let's talk about that. This is BreakingInFullWars.com.
[2:47:11.220 --> 2:47:13.220]  It's at RealElections on Twitter.
[2:47:13.220 --> 2:47:15.220]  Please follow us there. Here it is.
[2:47:15.220 --> 2:47:17.220]  Go ahead and go to the article.
[2:47:17.220 --> 2:47:19.220]  So this is a press release
[2:47:19.220 --> 2:47:21.220]  from today.
[2:47:21.220 --> 2:47:23.220]  United States Secret Service Department
[2:47:23.220 --> 2:47:25.220]  of Homeland Security in Washington
[2:47:25.220 --> 2:47:27.220]  early this morning. Special agents from the Secret Service
[2:47:27.220 --> 2:47:29.220]  Washington field office and officers
[2:47:29.220 --> 2:47:31.220]  from the Metropolitan Police Department
[2:47:31.220 --> 2:47:33.220]  investigated a report of a potential threat
[2:47:33.220 --> 2:47:35.220]  against Secret Service Protectees.
[2:47:35.220 --> 2:47:37.220]  The Secret Service
[2:47:37.220 --> 2:47:39.220]  received information from a concerned citizen
[2:47:39.220 --> 2:47:41.220]  in Trump International Hotel security staff.
[2:47:41.220 --> 2:47:43.220]  Oh, thank God they're not being PC today.
[2:47:43.220 --> 2:47:45.220]  An individual was subsequently
[2:47:45.220 --> 2:47:47.220]  located at Trump International Hotel
[2:47:47.220 --> 2:47:49.220]  in D.C. Agents and officers
[2:47:49.220 --> 2:47:51.220]  recovered a semi-automatic
[2:47:51.220 --> 2:47:53.220]  assault rifle and a handgun
[2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:55.220]  in the individual's vehicle.
[2:47:55.220 --> 2:47:57.220]  Ryan Moles of Pennsylvania was arrested
[2:47:57.220 --> 2:47:59.220]  by MPD officers for illegal
[2:47:59.220 --> 2:48:01.220]  possession of firearms.
[2:48:01.220 --> 2:48:03.220]  So it is believed that
[2:48:03.220 --> 2:48:05.220]  Secret Service and this
[2:48:05.220 --> 2:48:07.220]  what was, I guess, a tip
[2:48:07.220 --> 2:48:09.220]  that came from people at the hotel
[2:48:09.220 --> 2:48:11.220]  and concerned citizens
[2:48:11.220 --> 2:48:13.220]  potentially saved lives today, Alex.
[2:48:13.220 --> 2:48:15.220]  Can we put the drag queen Kathy Griffin
[2:48:15.220 --> 2:48:17.220]  back behind us simulating the murder of the president?
[2:48:17.220 --> 2:48:19.220]  So I'm glad that you went there, Alex.
[2:48:19.220 --> 2:48:21.220]  I'm glad that you actually went there because this is a perfect segue.
[2:48:21.220 --> 2:48:23.220]  All right, Alex, let's get serious
[2:48:23.220 --> 2:48:25.220]  for a second here. I know that it's hard
[2:48:25.220 --> 2:48:27.220]  to go from one end of the spectrum to the other,
[2:48:27.220 --> 2:48:29.220]  but we can do this. We are human beings.
[2:48:29.220 --> 2:48:31.220]  This is what needs to be
[2:48:31.220 --> 2:48:33.220]  a clear message to President Trump
[2:48:33.220 --> 2:48:35.220]  right now with Kathy Griffin
[2:48:35.220 --> 2:48:37.220]  holding up your decapitated head.
[2:48:37.220 --> 2:48:39.220]  And Alex, you've been saying this
[2:48:39.220 --> 2:48:41.220]  since November 8th.
[2:48:41.220 --> 2:48:43.220]  Megyn Kelly's coming next week. I want Kathy Griffin,
[2:48:43.220 --> 2:48:45.220]  me and Megyn Kelly to oil
[2:48:45.220 --> 2:48:47.220]  Russell next week on air.
[2:48:47.220 --> 2:48:49.220]  Alex, you're going off the tracks again.
[2:48:49.220 --> 2:48:51.220]  You're going to fight.
[2:48:51.220 --> 2:48:53.220]  You've been saying this since November 8th.
[2:48:53.220 --> 2:48:55.220]  This picture needs to scream it to Donald Trump.
[2:48:55.220 --> 2:48:57.220]  This is war.
[2:48:57.220 --> 2:48:59.220]  No, let's get serious.
[2:48:59.220 --> 2:49:01.220]  I've got a stack where they're saying
[2:49:01.220 --> 2:49:03.220]  bomb his hotels.
[2:49:03.220 --> 2:49:05.220]  And then they tried to do it today.
[2:49:05.220 --> 2:49:07.220]  I started the show before this even broke.
[2:49:07.220 --> 2:49:09.220]  I've got it right here. Mainstream news.
[2:49:09.220 --> 2:49:11.220]  MSNBC, a terrorism expert says
[2:49:11.220 --> 2:49:13.220]  attack his facilities.
[2:49:13.220 --> 2:49:15.220]  New York Times column about killing Trump.
[2:49:15.220 --> 2:49:17.220]  LA Times journalist hopes for Trump's death.
[2:49:17.220 --> 2:49:19.220]  I'm going to start here, please.
[2:49:19.220 --> 2:49:21.220]  MSNBC, counter terrorism analyst calls
[2:49:21.220 --> 2:49:23.220]  for ISIS bombing of Trump property.
[2:49:23.220 --> 2:49:25.220]  We have that clip coming up in the next segment.
[2:49:25.220 --> 2:49:27.220]  I make jokes because it's Gallows humor.
[2:49:27.220 --> 2:49:29.220]  We're in a total war.
[2:49:29.220 --> 2:49:32.220]  So then Rasmussen releases a poll today.
[2:49:32.220 --> 2:49:35.220]  53% say media leaks are an act of treason.
[2:49:35.220 --> 2:49:37.220]  Alex, we are living
[2:49:37.220 --> 2:49:39.220]  in a civil war.
[2:49:39.220 --> 2:49:41.220]  We are living in an age where acts of treason
[2:49:41.220 --> 2:49:43.220]  are just considered normal.
[2:49:43.220 --> 2:49:45.220]  And I'm just challenging Megyn Kelly
[2:49:45.220 --> 2:49:47.220]  to be a boxing match.
[2:49:47.220 --> 2:49:49.220]  I'll take both of them on.
[2:49:49.220 --> 2:49:51.220]  And you will win because it's a joke.
[2:49:51.220 --> 2:49:53.220]  It's a joke. Who was Andy Kaufman
[2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:55.220]  who would wrestle women?
[2:49:55.220 --> 2:49:57.220]  That's the answer to the future.
[2:49:57.220 --> 2:49:59.220]  Oil wrestling?
[2:49:59.220 --> 2:50:01.220]  It's probably less violent.
[2:50:01.220 --> 2:50:03.220]  But I've got to wear flippers.
[2:50:03.220 --> 2:50:05.220]  Or maybe you can tie your hand behind it.
[2:50:05.220 --> 2:50:07.220]  Or maybe you can be like a dolphin man or something.
[2:50:07.220 --> 2:50:09.220]  Exactly.
[2:50:09.220 --> 2:50:11.220]  You know I'm in a good mood.
[2:50:11.220 --> 2:50:13.220]  I know you're in a good mood.
[2:50:13.220 --> 2:50:15.220]  It's really good.
[2:50:15.220 --> 2:50:17.220]  It's really sweet.
[2:50:17.220 --> 2:50:19.220]  But you know what though, we are in a war
[2:50:19.220 --> 2:50:21.220]  and you've been telling people.
[2:50:21.220 --> 2:50:23.220]  I'm glad to see that you're able to win.
[2:50:23.220 --> 2:50:25.220]  I've been a little down lately.
[2:50:25.220 --> 2:50:27.220]  I know. You couldn't celebrate.
[2:50:27.220 --> 2:50:29.220]  Everybody gave you a hard time.
[2:50:29.220 --> 2:50:31.220]  Why isn't Alex celebrating Trump's victory?
[2:50:31.220 --> 2:50:33.220]  Because now the civil war is here.
[2:50:33.220 --> 2:50:35.220]  And I feel like we're starting to win.
[2:50:35.220 --> 2:50:37.220]  I think we are.
[2:50:37.220 --> 2:50:39.220]  And I think that the big thing that's happening
[2:50:39.220 --> 2:50:41.220]  at least in the last 24 hours
[2:50:41.220 --> 2:50:43.220]  will be back with Owen Schroyer
[2:50:43.220 --> 2:50:45.220]  straight ahead with two more segments.
[2:50:45.220 --> 2:50:47.220]  And then Roger Stone's going to open the phones up
[2:50:47.220 --> 2:50:49.220]  and talk about the plan for Trump to get on the offense
[2:50:49.220 --> 2:50:51.220]  with the Justice Department against the criminal globalist
[2:50:51.220 --> 2:50:53.220]  inside the government who've been caught criminally leaking.
[2:50:53.220 --> 2:50:55.220]  The president has the upper hand.
[2:50:55.220 --> 2:50:57.220]  The question is, will he use it?
[2:50:57.220 --> 2:51:23.220]  We'll stay with us.
[2:51:23.220 --> 2:51:33.220]  Thank you for your time and money.

[2:51:59.220 --> 2:52:01.220]  It may not sound like a lot of money,
[2:52:01.220 --> 2:52:03.220]  but it's enough to turn 500 strangers
[2:52:03.220 --> 2:52:05.220]  into 500 connections.
[2:52:05.220 --> 2:52:07.220]  All it takes is the right business card.

[2:52:59.220 --> 2:53:26.220]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.

[2:54:36.220 --> 2:54:38.220]  Vistaprint.com.
[2:54:38.220 --> 2:54:40.220]  Earlier,
[2:54:40.220 --> 2:54:42.220]  I ran around
[2:54:42.220 --> 2:54:44.220]  pretending like I was having
[2:54:44.220 --> 2:54:46.220]  brain tumor-induced
[2:54:46.220 --> 2:54:48.220]  seizures and falling down on the ground.
[2:54:48.220 --> 2:54:50.220]  For that, I apologized to anyone that was offended.
[2:54:50.220 --> 2:54:52.220]  I wasn't doing it to offend anybody that has
[2:54:52.220 --> 2:54:54.220]  neurological disorders. I've had family with brain tumors
[2:54:54.220 --> 2:54:56.220]  and Alzheimer's, other things.
[2:54:56.220 --> 2:54:58.220]  We all know it's very, very serious and not a joke.
[2:54:58.220 --> 2:55:00.220]  What I was making fun of is the media
[2:55:00.220 --> 2:55:02.220]  saying last year,
[2:55:02.220 --> 2:55:04.220]  remember that Hillary didn't fall down
[2:55:04.220 --> 2:55:06.220]  and they would cut the tape
[2:55:06.220 --> 2:55:08.220]  right at the point that she was about to fall down
[2:55:08.220 --> 2:55:10.220]  and said we were making it up.
[2:55:10.220 --> 2:55:12.220]  And I was just making the joke that if I'm having seizures
[2:55:12.220 --> 2:55:14.220]  and falling down everywhere, it's real.
[2:55:14.220 --> 2:55:16.220]  You know, when Hillary had that happening
[2:55:16.220 --> 2:55:18.220]  and the fact that they're trying to cover it up
[2:55:18.220 --> 2:55:20.220]  is trying to get you to not believe your own eyes,
[2:55:20.220 --> 2:55:22.220]  ladies and gentlemen.
[2:55:22.220 --> 2:55:24.220]  We are definitely having some fun here today.
[2:55:24.220 --> 2:55:26.220]  But at the expense of MSM,
[2:55:26.220 --> 2:55:28.220]  that's having a very, very, very bad
[2:55:28.220 --> 2:55:30.220]  day.
[2:55:30.220 --> 2:55:32.220]  Here's the latest Clifford Cunningham article.
[2:55:32.220 --> 2:55:34.220]  Clifford's now moved to Austin, is in there
[2:55:34.220 --> 2:55:36.220]  within the crew. Soros Insider
[2:55:36.220 --> 2:55:38.220]  infiltrates Trump administration.
[2:55:38.220 --> 2:55:40.220]  That's big news. You've got other big news,
[2:55:40.220 --> 2:55:42.220]  Owen Schreuer. Well, this is just,
[2:55:42.220 --> 2:55:44.220]  I kind of wanted to, I took a memo here, Alex,
[2:55:44.220 --> 2:55:46.220]  because I'm trying to pay attention
[2:55:46.220 --> 2:55:48.220]  to what the fake news is doing.
[2:55:48.220 --> 2:55:50.220]  And you just talked about it. You know,
[2:55:50.220 --> 2:55:52.220]  the big thing that they're trying to break is this Kushner
[2:55:52.220 --> 2:55:54.220]  trying to create a back channel with Russia, right?
[2:55:54.220 --> 2:55:56.220]  This is actually old news.
[2:55:56.220 --> 2:55:58.220]  But it turns out he really didn't do now,
[2:55:58.220 --> 2:56:00.220]  but it's totally normal if he did. Right, right, right.
[2:56:00.220 --> 2:56:02.220]  But this is old news anyway. They just decided to add
[2:56:02.220 --> 2:56:04.220]  Kushner to it. So they make it new
[2:56:04.220 --> 2:56:06.220]  by adding Kushner in there.
[2:56:06.220 --> 2:56:08.220]  And now it's new, even though this is just
[2:56:08.220 --> 2:56:10.220]  old wash-up news that they're trying to
[2:56:10.220 --> 2:56:12.220]  recreate. But here's the crazy thing
[2:56:12.220 --> 2:56:14.220]  that's spiraling in my head, okay?
[2:56:14.220 --> 2:56:16.220]  I'm trying to figure this out, Alex.
[2:56:16.220 --> 2:56:18.220]  If they've been colluding with Russia,
[2:56:18.220 --> 2:56:20.220]  Kushner be setting up this back channel.
[2:56:20.220 --> 2:56:22.220]  Everyone in D.C. is looking for evidence
[2:56:22.220 --> 2:56:24.220]  of collusion and they can't find it. Exactly.
[2:56:24.220 --> 2:56:26.220]  He's president-elect. Oh, that's the total proof.
[2:56:26.220 --> 2:56:28.220]  Why do you need a back channel if you already
[2:56:28.220 --> 2:56:30.220]  run by the Russians? Exactly. And it's obviously
[2:56:30.220 --> 2:56:32.220]  a very, very successful
[2:56:32.220 --> 2:56:34.220]  back channel because everyone in
[2:56:34.220 --> 2:56:36.220]  D.C. has been looking for it. Can't find it.
[2:56:36.220 --> 2:56:38.220]  So it's obviously working. So why would
[2:56:38.220 --> 2:56:40.220]  they need to create a back channel?
[2:56:40.220 --> 2:56:42.220]  Then, think about this angle, Alex.
[2:56:42.220 --> 2:56:44.220]  So you have the Democrats.
[2:56:44.220 --> 2:56:46.220]  You have specifically Obama and his spy
[2:56:46.220 --> 2:56:48.220]  state coming out saying, well, you know,
[2:56:48.220 --> 2:56:50.220]  we think Trump might be Russian, so we're
[2:56:50.220 --> 2:56:52.220]  going to have to spy on Trump. Okay, so we're
[2:56:52.220 --> 2:56:54.220]  going to spy on Trump. So now Trump knows
[2:56:54.220 --> 2:56:56.220]  he's getting spied on. So he says, well,
[2:56:56.220 --> 2:56:58.220]  the Democrats are spying on me. They're trying
[2:56:58.220 --> 2:57:00.220]  to get anything they can. I can't have a
[2:57:00.220 --> 2:57:02.220]  safe phone call. So you know what? I probably
[2:57:02.220 --> 2:57:04.220]  need to create a back channel with Russia
[2:57:04.220 --> 2:57:06.220]  because the Democrats are spying on me. Why are
[2:57:06.220 --> 2:57:08.220]  you creating a back channel? Why are you
[2:57:08.220 --> 2:57:10.220]  creating a back channel? We're not spying
[2:57:10.220 --> 2:57:12.220]  on you. There's no spine. There's no wire
[2:57:12.220 --> 2:57:14.220]  taps. You clearly are Russian. You created
[2:57:14.220 --> 2:57:16.220]  a back channel. If the Russians are trying
[2:57:16.220 --> 2:57:18.220]  to cut our taxes, defend our border,
[2:57:18.220 --> 2:57:20.220]  expand our military, put the family
[2:57:20.220 --> 2:57:22.220]  first, allow Christianity again,
[2:57:22.220 --> 2:57:24.220]  I like Russian rule.
[2:57:24.220 --> 2:57:26.220]  The difference is this is not the Russians.
[2:57:26.220 --> 2:57:28.220]  Wait, wait, wait. You're getting spied on all
[2:57:28.220 --> 2:57:30.220]  the time. By the way, this is all Americans.
[2:57:30.220 --> 2:57:32.220]  So how dare you want to back? Every American
[2:57:32.220 --> 2:57:34.220]  has to go through some level
[2:57:34.220 --> 2:57:36.220]  of personal privacy
[2:57:36.220 --> 2:57:38.220]  in their life. Who believes General Flynn,
[2:57:38.220 --> 2:57:40.220]  a hero of the army battling al-Qaeda
[2:57:40.220 --> 2:57:42.220]  and ISIS, is really
[2:57:42.220 --> 2:57:44.220]  crazy. Who believes Trump is? This is
[2:57:44.220 --> 2:57:46.220]  ridiculous. Some super
[2:57:46.220 --> 2:57:48.220]  capitalist from New York. I am
[2:57:48.220 --> 2:57:50.220]  okay. Stay right there. Hold on. We're going
[2:57:50.220 --> 2:57:52.220]  to break. Just a moment. Just a moment.
[2:57:52.220 --> 2:57:54.220]  We're going to do five more minutes and then
[2:57:54.220 --> 2:57:56.220]  bring in the great Roger Stone. But just
[2:57:56.220 --> 2:57:58.220]  briefly, we need financial support. I'm
[2:57:58.220 --> 2:58:00.220]  having a lot of fun here, but we've launched
[2:58:00.220 --> 2:58:02.220]  a big contest to go out and expose the media
[2:58:02.220 --> 2:58:04.220]  as the terrorist, as the enemy, as the fake
[2:58:04.220 --> 2:58:06.220]  news, operation exposed terrorist media
[2:58:06.220 --> 2:58:08.220]  info wars.com, force less contest,
[2:58:08.220 --> 2:58:10.220]  $200,000. But the real funds
[2:58:10.220 --> 2:58:12.220]  are all the great patriots out there.
[2:58:12.220 --> 2:58:14.220]  Red-blooded Americans all getting in the
[2:58:14.220 --> 2:58:16.220]  media's face legally and lawfully, pointing
[2:58:16.220 --> 2:58:18.220]  out CNN, terrorist,
[2:58:18.220 --> 2:58:20.220]  Fox, MSNBC, I don't care.
[2:58:20.220 --> 2:58:22.220]  Just however you want to do it with your own
[2:58:22.220 --> 2:58:24.220]  shirt, your own sign, whatever it is, just get
[2:58:24.220 --> 2:58:26.220]  infowars.com in there and win $1,000
[2:58:26.220 --> 2:58:28.220]  or $2,500. Just follow the road map
[2:58:28.220 --> 2:58:30.220]  of all the other folks that won the big contest.
[2:58:30.220 --> 2:58:32.220]  Bill Clinton's a rapist and realize
[2:58:32.220 --> 2:58:34.220]  we've extended Memorial Day specials up to

[3:00:14.220 --> 3:00:16.220]  The key for conservatives and libertarians
[3:00:16.220 --> 3:00:18.220]  is to start having fun
[3:00:18.220 --> 3:00:20.220]  and not caring. The liberals
[3:00:20.220 --> 3:00:22.220]  of the uptight twits trying to act cool
[3:00:22.220 --> 3:00:24.220]  off their teleprompters. We're funnier,
[3:00:24.220 --> 3:00:26.220]  we're smarter, we're stronger, we're better.
[3:00:26.220 --> 3:00:28.220]  We're not ally with dirtbag radical
[3:00:28.220 --> 3:00:30.220]  Islam. They can go right back to Hades
[3:00:30.220 --> 3:00:32.220]  or they crawl out of the devil's rear
[3:00:32.220 --> 3:00:34.220]  end. Owen, you've been here
[3:00:34.220 --> 3:00:36.220]  now a while. How long is it? What do you
[3:00:36.220 --> 3:00:38.220]  think of the info war? I think I've been
[3:00:38.220 --> 3:00:40.220]  here seven or eight years.
[3:00:40.220 --> 3:00:44.220]  You know, it's been crazy. It's been a ride.
[3:00:44.220 --> 3:00:46.220]  Getting to know you has been quite an
[3:00:46.220 --> 3:00:48.220]  experience. That's been something that
[3:00:48.220 --> 3:00:50.220]  obviously I only thought could be a dream.
[3:00:50.220 --> 3:00:52.220]  So I feel like I'm the, I feel like a dream
[3:00:52.220 --> 3:00:54.220]  to see me fall over. We don't need to talk
[3:00:54.220 --> 3:00:56.220]  about that. You weren't having a seizure.
[3:00:56.220 --> 3:00:58.220]  But no, honestly, I feel like to an extent
[3:00:58.220 --> 3:01:00.220]  I am an epitome of the American
[3:01:00.220 --> 3:01:02.220]  dream, not like President Obama,
[3:01:02.220 --> 3:01:04.220]  but the American dream, the American
[3:01:04.220 --> 3:01:06.220]  dream, the American dream, the American
[3:01:06.220 --> 3:01:08.220]  dream, the American dream.
[3:01:08.220 --> 3:01:10.220]  Not like President Obama said Donald Trump
[3:01:10.220 --> 3:01:12.220]  was years ago, but I'm saying, by the way,
[3:01:12.220 --> 3:01:14.220]  you're helping build info worth the audiences,
[3:01:14.220 --> 3:01:16.220]  but who, if we didn't build this,
[3:01:16.220 --> 3:01:18.220]  who built it? Well, the point
[3:01:18.220 --> 3:01:20.220]  is, follow
[3:01:20.220 --> 3:01:22.220]  your heart. You know,
[3:01:22.220 --> 3:01:24.220]  you might not be a broadcaster,
[3:01:24.220 --> 3:01:26.220]  you might not be a journalist, you might
[3:01:26.220 --> 3:01:28.220]  not be a politician, but you
[3:01:28.220 --> 3:01:30.220]  can change the world in whatever
[3:01:30.220 --> 3:01:32.220]  walk of life that you're doing.
[3:01:32.220 --> 3:01:34.220]  I mean, you know, people like working
[3:01:34.220 --> 3:01:36.220]  in the financial sector. So maybe
[3:01:36.220 --> 3:01:38.220]  you're working in a bank or maybe you're
[3:01:38.220 --> 3:01:40.220]  working here and you see a bad stock deal
[3:01:40.220 --> 3:01:42.220]  or you see insider trading go down and then you call
[3:01:42.220 --> 3:01:44.220]  that out. Now all of a sudden you've made an impact.
[3:01:44.220 --> 3:01:46.220]  You've cleaned the integrity of that.
[3:01:46.220 --> 3:01:48.220]  And if somebody, the biggest thing is political
[3:01:48.220 --> 3:01:50.220]  correctness. If somebody tries to boss you around
[3:01:50.220 --> 3:01:52.220]  control you, don't let them do it. Being
[3:01:52.220 --> 3:01:54.220]  yourself is what's important. And people get
[3:01:54.220 --> 3:01:56.220]  into these industries, Alex, and I feel like
[3:01:56.220 --> 3:01:58.220]  they just go along with it because it's been
[3:01:58.220 --> 3:02:00.220]  the status quo for so long. Like if I was
[3:02:00.220 --> 3:02:02.220]  to go join Fox News and they say, oh, well,
[3:02:02.220 --> 3:02:04.220]  we're going to have you here, but you got to read
[3:02:04.220 --> 3:02:06.220]  that's just how it's done. I could never do
[3:02:06.220 --> 3:02:08.220]  that. I don't want to do that. That's not me.
[3:02:08.220 --> 3:02:10.220]  That's not fun. Coming here, being able to cover
[3:02:10.220 --> 3:02:12.220]  my own thing, not having to read off the
[3:02:12.220 --> 3:02:14.220]  teleprompter, having my boss flopping
[3:02:14.220 --> 3:02:16.220]  around like a fish out of water live during
[3:02:16.220 --> 3:02:18.220]  the show. That's that's more my style.
[3:02:18.220 --> 3:02:20.220]  And let's expand on that. One reason I'm so
[3:02:20.220 --> 3:02:22.220]  excited is
[3:02:22.220 --> 3:02:24.220]  in the last year or so I tried to be more
[3:02:24.220 --> 3:02:26.220]  journalistic, but I'm always trying to tell the
[3:02:26.220 --> 3:02:28.220]  truth. But I go with my gut a lot too with
[3:02:28.220 --> 3:02:30.220]  analysis. And so as I tried to get even
[3:02:30.220 --> 3:02:32.220]  better about stuff, the media took that as
[3:02:32.220 --> 3:02:34.220]  this and thought that I was like scared
[3:02:34.220 --> 3:02:36.220]  because I was trying to be even more
[3:02:36.220 --> 3:02:38.220]  accurate. Let me put it to the answer is I'm
[3:02:38.220 --> 3:02:40.220]  going to go even more wild now. I'm going to go
[3:02:40.220 --> 3:02:42.220]  on offense with everybody. And I realize I feel
[3:02:42.220 --> 3:02:44.220]  good on offense. So I don't care. Get ready.
[3:02:44.220 --> 3:02:46.220]  Info Wars is going on full rampage
[3:02:46.220 --> 3:02:48.220]  offense. This
[3:02:48.220 --> 3:02:50.220]  might answer your question better. I always
[3:02:50.220 --> 3:02:52.220]  tell people if you think that I'm crazy or
[3:02:52.220 --> 3:02:54.220]  conspiracy theories, start doing what I do.
[3:02:54.220 --> 3:02:56.220]  Start calling these things out. Start falling
[3:02:56.220 --> 3:02:58.220]  this stuff. And then you'll figure out how real it
[3:02:58.220 --> 3:03:00.220]  is real quick. Whether you believe it or not,
[3:03:00.220 --> 3:03:02.220]  I'm going to go back coming you from the
[3:03:02.220 --> 3:03:04.220]  establishment and the liberals. That's just
[3:03:04.220 --> 3:03:06.220]  as powerful to wake people up as the news
[3:03:06.220 --> 3:03:08.220]  is these days. But I think the craziest
[3:03:08.220 --> 3:03:10.220]  thing to me, Alex, and I can't even imagine
[3:03:10.220 --> 3:03:12.220]  what it must be like for you having
[3:03:12.220 --> 3:03:14.220]  been in this state of mind for over 20 years.
[3:03:14.220 --> 3:03:16.220]  I've only been in this state of mind for
[3:03:16.220 --> 3:03:18.220]  five years. Just being right.
[3:03:18.220 --> 3:03:20.220]  I mean, I can't even tell you Alex. It's just
[3:03:20.220 --> 3:03:22.220]  ridiculous. I'm not really that I don't know.
[3:03:22.220 --> 3:03:24.220]  I might have an IQ higher than an average
[3:03:24.220 --> 3:03:26.220]  person. I really don't know. It really doesn't
[3:03:26.220 --> 3:03:28.220]  matter. But I can enter
[3:03:28.220 --> 3:03:30.220]  the media and in five years be sitting next
[3:03:30.220 --> 3:03:32.220]  to Alex Jones. I didn't even
[3:03:32.220 --> 3:03:34.220]  have a clue. I couldn't even have told you what
[3:03:34.220 --> 3:03:36.220]  to do. But
[3:03:36.220 --> 3:03:38.220]  the point is that's how weak people are.
[3:03:38.220 --> 3:03:40.220]  That's how pathetic the industry is
[3:03:40.220 --> 3:03:42.220]  right now. Nobody has it. They want
[3:03:42.220 --> 3:03:44.220]  a bunch of repeaters that go and they
[3:03:44.220 --> 3:03:46.220]  just repeat the same crap. There's only a few
[3:03:46.220 --> 3:03:48.220]  slots at the top for people that sold
[3:03:48.220 --> 3:03:50.220]  out. And then it's not even fun. It's fun
[3:03:50.220 --> 3:03:52.220]  to do real stuff. The state of
[3:03:52.220 --> 3:03:54.220]  that's what's exciting. I mean, it is so exciting
[3:03:54.220 --> 3:03:56.220]  to know we're launching this $200,000 contest
[3:03:56.220 --> 3:03:58.220]  to expose
[3:03:58.220 --> 3:04:00.220]  a super sexy training
[3:04:00.220 --> 3:04:02.220]  Kathy Griffin.
[3:04:02.220 --> 3:04:04.220]  I mean, she has a hot training. Let's just say I would
[3:04:04.220 --> 3:04:06.220]  date him. And the point is
[3:04:06.220 --> 3:04:08.220]  is that this is all coming out
[3:04:08.220 --> 3:04:10.220]  now. And it's ridiculous.
[3:04:10.220 --> 3:04:12.220]  It's blowing up in his face. Speaking
[3:04:12.220 --> 3:04:14.220]  of coming out real quick before we go to this break
[3:04:14.220 --> 3:04:16.220]  and get Roger Stone back in here. I want to just cover
[3:04:16.220 --> 3:04:18.220]  Bill de Blasio real quick. Okay. This guy, you want
[3:04:18.220 --> 3:04:20.220]  to talk about the swamp. This guy is covered
[3:04:20.220 --> 3:04:21.220]  in swamp
[3:04:21.220 --> 3:04:23.220]  gook. Got the terrorist
[3:04:23.220 --> 3:04:25.220]  in the last what like five
[3:04:25.220 --> 3:04:27.220]  days. This has been the development of Bill de
[3:04:27.220 --> 3:04:29.220]  Blasio, the mayor of New York. First
[3:04:29.220 --> 3:04:31.220]  it comes out. He has one degree of
[3:04:31.220 --> 3:04:33.220]  separation from a
[3:04:33.220 --> 3:04:35.220]  pedophile caught with thousands of
[3:04:35.220 --> 3:04:37.220]  infant porn images on his
[3:04:37.220 --> 3:04:39.220]  on his computer. It's been part of the course
[3:04:39.220 --> 3:04:41.220]  one degree of separation from Bill de Blasio.
[3:04:41.220 --> 3:04:43.220]  Bill de Blasio gives half a million dollars to
[3:04:43.220 --> 3:04:45.220]  Linda Sarsour's movement, half a million
[3:04:45.220 --> 3:04:47.220]  dollars to pro Sharia law. And now
[3:04:47.220 --> 3:04:49.220]  he is going to march with Oscar
[3:04:49.220 --> 3:04:51.220]  Lopez Rivera, a terrorist Alex.
[3:04:51.220 --> 3:04:53.220]  That's Bill de Blasio. I mean, you
[3:04:53.220 --> 3:04:55.220]  Democrats, you look at his smile. I mean,
[3:04:55.220 --> 3:04:57.220]  it looks like Sandusky. I'm sorry. He looks
[3:04:57.220 --> 3:04:59.220]  like Sandusky. He just does. He looks like a big
[3:04:59.220 --> 3:05:01.220]  Sandusky. A video has
[3:05:01.220 --> 3:05:03.220]  gone viral on the internet
[3:05:03.220 --> 3:05:05.220]  where Muslim migrants are caught
[3:05:05.220 --> 3:05:07.220]  in the act stealing
[3:05:07.220 --> 3:05:09.220]  flowers and toys from
[3:05:09.220 --> 3:05:11.220]  get this a memorial
[3:05:11.220 --> 3:05:13.220]  dedicated to the victims
[3:05:13.220 --> 3:05:15.220]  of the Manchester bombing
[3:05:15.220 --> 3:05:17.220]  during the video. You can hear the man behind
[3:05:17.220 --> 3:05:19.220]  the camera who is from
[3:05:19.220 --> 3:05:21.220]  Manchester approaching the two
[3:05:21.220 --> 3:05:23.220]  migrant men and accusing them
[3:05:23.220 --> 3:05:25.220]  of being thieves.
[3:05:31.220 --> 3:05:33.220]  Now one of the migrants is seen holding
[3:05:33.220 --> 3:05:35.220]  a stuffed blue Smurf toy
[3:05:35.220 --> 3:05:37.220]  that he had just stolen
[3:05:37.220 --> 3:05:39.220]  from the memorial. I'm not going to
[3:05:39.220 --> 3:05:41.220]  out of the area. How was that? Now,
[3:05:41.220 --> 3:05:43.220]  Casey missed that. The man from
[3:05:43.220 --> 3:05:45.220]  Manchester told the Muslim migrants
[3:05:45.220 --> 3:05:47.220]  I'll knock this out of the pair of you
[3:05:47.220 --> 3:05:49.220]  proof that not all of the citizens
[3:05:49.220 --> 3:05:51.220]  of Manchester are liberal cucks.
[3:05:51.220 --> 3:05:53.220]  And you can watch the video

[3:07:57.220 --> 3:07:59.220]  music
[3:07:59.220 --> 3:08:01.220]  music
[3:08:01.220 --> 3:08:03.220]  I
[3:08:06.660 --> 3:08:14.060]  Follow America let me make this perfectly clear you're listening to Roger Stone on in
[3:08:20.980 --> 3:08:22.980]  Thank You mr. President
[3:08:22.980 --> 3:08:30.140]  We evoke our 37th president Richard Nixon
[3:08:31.300 --> 3:08:37.980]  Largely because President Donald Trump is under the same kind of deep state siege that Nixon was under
[3:08:39.500 --> 3:08:42.820]  See their situations somewhat analogous
[3:08:44.580 --> 3:08:51.580]  Nixon challenged the deep state he challenged what Dwight Eisenhower called the military industrial complex
[3:08:51.580 --> 3:08:56.980]  He ended the war in Vietnam on a faster timetable than the Pentagon wanted
[3:08:57.380 --> 3:09:02.100]  He opened a secret back channel to the Chinese
[3:09:03.220 --> 3:09:05.220]  circumventing the NSA
[3:09:05.420 --> 3:09:07.860]  circumventing the central intelligence agency
[3:09:08.700 --> 3:09:10.700]  circumventing the Pentagon
[3:09:10.780 --> 3:09:11.780]  sending
[3:09:11.780 --> 3:09:13.780]  presidential aid Henry Kissinger
[3:09:14.020 --> 3:09:18.380]  to begin discussions with the Chinese very reminiscent of
[3:09:18.380 --> 3:09:26.700]  What is apparent that the president did with Jared Kushner a member of the White House staff like Henry Kissinger?
[3:09:27.540 --> 3:09:33.220]  He reached a strategic arms limitation agreement with the Russians
[3:09:34.100 --> 3:09:36.580]  Good God. The man was a peacemaker
[3:09:37.220 --> 3:09:43.180]  And there's so much about Watergate that we didn't know then that we do know today
[3:09:43.180 --> 3:09:48.900]  We know the Watergate burglar team was infiltrated by the Central Intelligence Agency
[3:09:49.780 --> 3:09:51.780]  we know that the
[3:09:52.220 --> 3:09:54.380]  Pentagon had a
[3:09:54.380 --> 3:10:00.580]  spy ring going on in the White House where they were rifling through the national security
[3:10:01.340 --> 3:10:05.020]  offices desks even went into Henry Kissinger's briefcase
[3:10:05.020 --> 3:10:12.420]  Perloining documents copying them sending them to Admiral Thomas Moore the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
[3:10:12.820 --> 3:10:16.620]  To find out what kind of peacemaking initiatives Nixon was up to
[3:10:17.340 --> 3:10:22.140]  We even know that Judge John Sirica in the Watergate burglar case
[3:10:22.660 --> 3:10:29.340]  Was meeting secretly with the Watergate prosecutors Archibald Cox and then later Leon Jaworski
[3:10:29.340 --> 3:10:33.780]  This documented about a year ago in a stunning book by Jeff Shepherd
[3:10:33.780 --> 3:10:36.460]  The the real story of Watergate
[3:10:37.420 --> 3:10:43.340]  So you have an analogous situation here where President Donald Trump's a great sin is
[3:10:44.220 --> 3:10:46.220]  being for peace is
[3:10:46.340 --> 3:10:50.660]  Not being for war with the Russians over Syria and
[3:10:51.740 --> 3:10:53.740]  Therefore what you have seen
[3:10:54.340 --> 3:10:57.740]  absent any evidence whatsoever of
[3:10:58.540 --> 3:11:01.460]  Russian collusion with the Trump campaign is
[3:11:01.460 --> 3:11:06.220]  Is a concerted series of leaks and now
[3:11:06.900 --> 3:11:08.100]  reportedly a
[3:11:08.100 --> 3:11:14.540]  Doubling down by the deep-state apparatus going into overdrive to try to come up with some
[3:11:15.100 --> 3:11:17.100]  evidence of Russian
[3:11:17.220 --> 3:11:19.220]  collusion
[3:11:19.380 --> 3:11:27.820]  They're hanging Jared Kushner on the basis of no evidence no crime no cover-up no collusion
[3:11:27.820 --> 3:11:34.620]  Out of the allegation is that he opened a back channel to the Russians
[3:11:35.620 --> 3:11:36.940]  post
[3:11:36.940 --> 3:11:38.420]  election
[3:11:38.420 --> 3:11:44.220]  Wait a minute. This was about collusion with the Russians to win the election
[3:11:45.020 --> 3:11:47.020]  In fact, what we now know is
[3:11:48.580 --> 3:11:50.580]  That if there was
[3:11:50.580 --> 3:11:52.780]  Some communication
[3:11:52.780 --> 3:11:59.300]  Between mr. Kushner and the Russians it would be no different than the back channel that Barack Obama
[3:11:59.980 --> 3:12:07.100]  Opened to the Iranians or as I said earlier the back channel that President Richard Nixon opened to the Chinese in
[3:12:07.780 --> 3:12:10.920]  preparation for his historic trip there and the
[3:12:11.700 --> 3:12:15.900]  normalization of relations with a nation of billions of people
[3:12:16.820 --> 3:12:18.020]  so
[3:12:18.020 --> 3:12:21.500]  When did the focus suddenly go from before the election?
[3:12:21.500 --> 3:12:23.500]  To after the election
[3:12:24.900 --> 3:12:27.780]  No, Jared Kushner is being unfairly lynched
[3:12:28.780 --> 3:12:37.060]  By a meet mainstream media mob whipped up by the Democrats on the basis of no evidence of wrongdoing
[3:12:38.180 --> 3:12:40.180]  whatsoever
[3:12:40.340 --> 3:12:42.340]  This is a really extraordinary
[3:12:43.180 --> 3:12:48.380]  Here is how President Trump however can avoid the fate of
[3:12:48.380 --> 3:12:52.900]  His predecessor Richard Nixon
[3:12:53.580 --> 3:12:59.780]  See Nixon other than the firing of Archibald Cox really mishandled Watergate from beginning to end
[3:13:01.260 --> 3:13:03.940]  staying endlessly on defense
[3:13:05.020 --> 3:13:10.220]  Now he has the same forces inside the Beltway arraigned against him
[3:13:11.060 --> 3:13:16.340]  the mainstream media the Washington Post the New York Times the
[3:13:16.340 --> 3:13:18.220]  17
[3:13:18.220 --> 3:13:19.460]  vaunted
[3:13:19.460 --> 3:13:21.980]  intelligence agencies that are still headed
[3:13:22.620 --> 3:13:29.300]  By in essence by Obama appointees the second and third levels of all these agencies
[3:13:29.940 --> 3:13:35.340]  Rife with political appointees by Barack Obama. That's why nothing they say
[3:13:36.060 --> 3:13:38.060]  Can be believed
[3:13:38.100 --> 3:13:45.260]  If you've been watching me here on info wars or listening to my syndicated radio show the stone cold truth or following my website
[3:13:45.260 --> 3:13:47.260]  You're already hip to the fact
[3:13:47.300 --> 3:13:53.180]  That when the intelligence agencies say it's our assessment
[3:13:54.180 --> 3:13:56.180]  Well, that means they don't know jack shit
[3:13:56.740 --> 3:14:00.940]  That means they have no idea what's going on or even worse
[3:14:01.340 --> 3:14:05.500]  They want to project what it is that they would like you to believe and
[3:14:06.740 --> 3:14:11.140]  So when mr. Comey the FBI director was asked
[3:14:12.140 --> 3:14:13.380]  specifically
[3:14:13.380 --> 3:14:15.380]  whether he was
[3:14:16.620 --> 3:14:22.780]  Aware of the fact that whether he thought Julian Assange was being manipulated by the Russians
[3:14:22.780 --> 3:14:29.220]  He said our assessment is that they used some out kind of cut out to do that
[3:14:29.820 --> 3:14:35.060]  I'm not even sure what that means because Julian Assange is a
[3:14:36.300 --> 3:14:39.860]  Journalist and he is publishing information
[3:14:39.860 --> 3:14:42.740]  Information that he obtains
[3:14:44.300 --> 3:14:48.260]  Now the idea that that is somehow criminal I
[3:14:49.580 --> 3:14:52.980]  Would remind you of the Pentagon Papers case
[3:14:53.420 --> 3:14:55.420]  in which the
[3:14:56.060 --> 3:14:57.220]  the
[3:14:57.220 --> 3:14:58.220]  former
[3:14:58.220 --> 3:15:00.220]  Kissinger staff member Daniel Ellsberg
[3:15:00.980 --> 3:15:05.540]  Stole documents pertaining to the origins of the Vietnam War
[3:15:06.340 --> 3:15:08.580]  and gave them to the New York Times and
[3:15:08.580 --> 3:15:10.580]  the New York Times
[3:15:11.020 --> 3:15:13.020]  printed them and
[3:15:13.740 --> 3:15:19.660]  After the first group of documents were printed the Justice Department under Richard Nixon under the direction of
[3:15:19.940 --> 3:15:24.620]  Attorney General John Mitchell went to court and the courts ruled
[3:15:25.580 --> 3:15:31.500]  That the New York Times could not be abridged from publishing these documents
[3:15:31.500 --> 3:15:38.300]  So the whole notion that we are going to begin jailing
[3:15:39.260 --> 3:15:40.580]  journalists
[3:15:40.580 --> 3:15:42.580]  Because they publish information
[3:15:43.260 --> 3:15:52.540]  Embarrassing to the government is a slippery slope is a an affront to a free press is an affront to the First Amendment
[3:15:54.020 --> 3:16:00.020]  Where are all the mainstream media outlets the New York Times the Washington Post the Baltimore Sun
[3:16:00.020 --> 3:16:02.020]  the Austin
[3:16:02.660 --> 3:16:03.660]  Statesman
[3:16:03.660 --> 3:16:10.260]  Where are their editorials coming out against the indictment and the jailing of their fellow?
[3:16:10.860 --> 3:16:11.900]  journalist
[3:16:11.900 --> 3:16:13.900]  Julian Assange
[3:16:14.460 --> 3:16:16.300]  Don't hold your breath
[3:16:16.300 --> 3:16:21.860]  So we have an extraordinary turn of events here. Kathy Griffin has jumped the shark a
[3:16:22.900 --> 3:16:26.820]  Disgusting stunt pulled by Kathy Griffin pres I presume
[3:16:26.820 --> 3:16:31.780]  To revive a flagging Hollywood career. She glorifies
[3:16:32.300 --> 3:16:37.660]  Isis and then she threatens a sitting US president with death by decapitation and
[3:16:38.660 --> 3:16:40.660]  Frankly, it's backfired
[3:16:41.260 --> 3:16:42.500]  spectacularly
[3:16:42.500 --> 3:16:46.580]  Ms. Griffin having been terminated only hours ago
[3:16:48.060 --> 3:16:54.220]  So all the hopes that Kathy had of being a new left-wing darling seemed to be out the window
[3:16:54.220 --> 3:16:59.140]  Condemnation was fast and furious
[3:17:00.020 --> 3:17:02.220]  But make no mistake about it
[3:17:02.860 --> 3:17:04.420]  She'll be back
[3:17:04.420 --> 3:17:08.460]  because the Hollywood Liberals are most forgiving and
[3:17:09.020 --> 3:17:15.580]  She'll be recycled again in six months to insult our sensibilities with some other
[3:17:15.580 --> 3:17:24.020]  Unpatriotic attack on our president or his family or his efforts to make America great again
[3:17:24.900 --> 3:17:27.940]  So bye-bye Kathy. I hope we never see you again
[3:17:28.780 --> 3:17:32.020]  Sadly, however, I fear that we will
[3:17:33.500 --> 3:17:39.100]  In the previous hour we revealed the fact that George Soros
[3:17:39.100 --> 3:17:44.860]  Has infiltrated the Trump White House with one of his own in
[3:17:46.100 --> 3:17:52.500]  Fact a woman named Fiona Hill now working for the National Security Council
[3:17:53.620 --> 3:18:00.140]  Served in his as an advisor to his Open Society Institute
[3:18:00.540 --> 3:18:06.860]  Which is the mechanism that George Soros uses to overthrow foreign governments?
[3:18:06.860 --> 3:18:13.940]  You see the Hungarian government has seen the track record of the Open Society Institute in other countries and
[3:18:14.260 --> 3:18:18.180]  They are moving to call it what it is not a benign
[3:18:19.180 --> 3:18:28.380]  Non-profit but a criminal enterprise that seeks to destabilize and overturn the democratically elected government of Hungary and
[3:18:30.060 --> 3:18:32.540]  This woman Fiona Hill
[3:18:32.540 --> 3:18:36.180]  Improbably working for the Trump administration
[3:18:37.740 --> 3:18:44.220]  Served in the as an advisor to the Open Society Institute for seven years
[3:18:44.740 --> 3:18:52.900]  She has a a lifetime membership in the council on foreign relations. She is a Harvard graduate
[3:18:53.980 --> 3:18:58.060]  Does this sound like somebody who should be serving in the Trump White House?
[3:18:58.060 --> 3:19:01.740]  On the other hand what of
[3:19:02.500 --> 3:19:05.060]  Dina Habib powell
[3:19:06.340 --> 3:19:11.540]  She's besties with Huma Abedin. She's tight with
[3:19:12.700 --> 3:19:15.660]  Web Hubble's daughter Chelsea Clinton
[3:19:16.860 --> 3:19:20.780]  She's a former Bush White House aide
[3:19:22.020 --> 3:19:25.500]  Why is she serving in the Trump administration?
[3:19:25.500 --> 3:19:30.460]  In my opinion this is the leaker
[3:19:31.100 --> 3:19:36.940]  That mr. Trump seeks this is among the leakers who have to go

[3:26:56.860 --> 3:27:04.300]  I want to talk about what is shaping up to be one of the most interesting US Senate contests in the country in
[3:27:04.700 --> 3:27:08.980]  Alabama where Jeff Sessions stepped down to become Attorney General and
[3:27:09.860 --> 3:27:18.140]  outgoing governor Robert Bentley besieged by a sex scandal that would ultimately force his removal from office
[3:27:19.060 --> 3:27:21.060]  appointed Luther Strange
[3:27:21.060 --> 3:27:26.900]  The state Attorney General the problem with this of course is that mr. Strange was
[3:27:27.500 --> 3:27:32.100]  Soliciting the appointment of Governor Bentley at the same time he was
[3:27:32.660 --> 3:27:36.220]  Investigating the sex scandal that brought Bentley down
[3:27:37.180 --> 3:27:40.260]  now Luther Strange in the US Senate
[3:27:40.820 --> 3:27:43.260]  has become a a
[3:27:44.220 --> 3:27:46.220]  Loyal establishment public in
[3:27:46.220 --> 3:27:53.540]  Go-along to get along for Senator Mitch McConnell and the voters in
[3:27:54.660 --> 3:27:57.900]  Alabama are not happy with this unholy deal
[3:27:58.460 --> 3:28:04.700]  Then Luther Strange put out a first TV ad in which he claimed he had the support of the Alabama Farm Bureau
[3:28:05.300 --> 3:28:07.980]  But that turned out to be a lie and
[3:28:08.900 --> 3:28:12.100]  Then he said that he hadn't been soliciting
[3:28:12.100 --> 3:28:18.260]  Governor Bentley for the appointment at the same time. He was investigating Governor Bentley
[3:28:18.420 --> 3:28:21.460]  This is why they're starting to call him a lion looser
[3:28:22.060 --> 3:28:25.860]  And we learned only yesterday that the National Rifle Association
[3:28:27.260 --> 3:28:34.500]  Endorsed Luther Strange under intense pressure from Senate leader Mitch McConnell without interviewing any of the other
[3:28:35.100 --> 3:28:37.100]  Republican candidates
[3:28:37.100 --> 3:28:43.980]  Then here's more bad news the chairman of the Trump campaign at least one of the leaders
[3:28:44.300 --> 3:28:46.300]  Perry Hooper Jr.
[3:28:46.300 --> 3:28:48.300]  endorsed Luther Strange
[3:28:48.340 --> 3:28:52.340]  Trump supporters in Alabama are up in arms about this
[3:28:52.860 --> 3:28:55.740]  capitulation to the Republican establishment and
[3:28:56.140 --> 3:29:02.660]  The Trump supporters I know in Alabama are rallying to the support of Dr. Randy Brinson
[3:29:02.660 --> 3:29:07.940]  We've got some video of Brinson former chairman of the Alabama
[3:29:08.820 --> 3:29:10.660]  Christian coalition
[3:29:10.660 --> 3:29:16.420]  Arden supporter of Donald Trump and like Trump a political outsider
[3:29:17.260 --> 3:29:21.540]  Now there's other candidates in this race keep an eye on
[3:29:22.140 --> 3:29:29.140]  Randy Brinson. He is the only one who is loyal to the Trump agenda. I'm Roger Stone

[3:30:31.100 --> 3:30:38.340]  Now one of the migrants is seen holding a stuffed blue smurf toy that he had just stolen from the memorial
[3:30:40.500 --> 3:30:45.220]  Now in case he missed that the man from Manchester told the Muslim migrants
[3:30:45.220 --> 3:30:52.060]  I'll knock this out of the pair of yet proof that not all of the citizens of Manchester are liberal cucks

[3:33:03.260 --> 3:33:11.260]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear. You're listening to Roger stone on in four
[3:33:11.260 --> 3:33:25.420]  I'm Roger stone. That's Otis Redding and you're at info wars
[3:33:26.100 --> 3:33:32.340]  I'm going to be taking your phone calls in the this segment and the next the number is 1-800
[3:33:32.340 --> 3:33:41.340]  259-9231. This is my favorite part of the program and I will take all comers whatever you want to talk about
[3:33:42.020 --> 3:33:49.540]  The the Kathy Griffin matter the White House shake up the infiltration of the Trump White House by a
[3:33:50.260 --> 3:33:52.100]  Soros quisling
[3:33:52.100 --> 3:33:59.820]  We're open for all of it. It's kind of interesting to see the socialist paradise of Venezuela going down the tubes
[3:33:59.820 --> 3:34:06.940]  Starvation violence death now common day occurrences on the streets of Caracas
[3:34:07.620 --> 3:34:13.860]  Where all the uber lefty commentators who were talking about this as the socialist
[3:34:14.580 --> 3:34:15.900]  utopia
[3:34:15.900 --> 3:34:19.980]  Noam Chomsky very articulate. Where are you? No, I don't hear anything
[3:34:20.860 --> 3:34:23.540]  Sean Penn you thought Caesar Chavez
[3:34:23.540 --> 3:34:30.420]  Pardon me. You thought Hugo Chavez was just peachy keen and you kind of liked Maduro his thug follower
[3:34:31.180 --> 3:34:39.020]  So how about it Sean? Is there any shout out for those murdered who were killed at the hands of military tribunals?
[3:34:40.460 --> 3:34:42.060]  Crickets
[3:34:42.060 --> 3:34:45.820]  Where's Oliver stone? You know, he's a friend of mine
[3:34:45.820 --> 3:34:53.020]  He reached out to me after reading my book the man who killed Kennedy the case against LBJ
[3:34:53.980 --> 3:34:58.500]  But even Oliver thought Chavez was a hero of the people
[3:35:00.060 --> 3:35:04.260]  No discussion of how the success of Venezuela has
[3:35:05.060 --> 3:35:09.340]  crashed and how it will get substantially worse when the
[3:35:09.700 --> 3:35:11.700]  price of oil drops below
[3:35:12.260 --> 3:35:14.260]  $75 a barrel
[3:35:14.260 --> 3:35:24.380]  What's clear yet again is that socialism never works it never has and it never will
[3:35:25.180 --> 3:35:33.260]  In fact socialism is just communism in sheep's clothing. All right, let's go to the phone lines here
[3:35:33.980 --> 3:35:35.860]  We have
[3:35:35.860 --> 3:35:37.860]  Dan from Indiana
[3:35:37.860 --> 3:35:47.660]  Dan you're on info wars. What's on your mind? It's like Dan Dan you with us?
[3:35:48.500 --> 3:35:50.500]  There he is. Hi, this is Dan
[3:35:51.060 --> 3:35:57.580]  I got to see you in Cleveland at the rally and I didn't want to disturb you as you were walking through the tables
[3:35:57.740 --> 3:36:03.060]  But I did get video tape for you great and it's an honor to talk to you. Thank you, Dan
[3:36:03.060 --> 3:36:04.860]  And my topic is
[3:36:04.860 --> 3:36:10.620]  Where did Jared Kushner come from this guy is handling foreign affairs?
[3:36:10.620 --> 3:36:13.900]  he doesn't have any experience at all and
[3:36:14.500 --> 3:36:16.500]  Trump is letting him go to the Middle East
[3:36:17.180 --> 3:36:22.860]  Doing peace treaties with the Arabs and then he cannot even handle his own
[3:36:23.380 --> 3:36:25.620]  affairs with real estate and
[3:36:26.100 --> 3:36:29.620]  Park Avenue 666 is see some kind of
[3:36:29.620 --> 3:36:34.940]  Super genius where he can just read a book about the Middle East
[3:36:34.940 --> 3:36:40.340]  And then he gathers all this knowledge out of been air. Who is this guy? Where he come from?
[3:36:40.580 --> 3:36:44.740]  What's he about? Well, let me try to answer your question
[3:36:44.780 --> 3:36:50.580]  Dan first of all Jared Kushner is of course the president's son-in-law and he is married to
[3:36:51.020 --> 3:36:55.620]  Ivanka Trump who has been a friend of mine for many many years
[3:36:55.620 --> 3:37:02.220]  Now I have been a critic of mr. Kushner on my own right
[3:37:02.740 --> 3:37:07.540]  And the fact that I think he has been responsible for bringing into the White House
[3:37:08.060 --> 3:37:10.460]  some of those like
[3:37:11.420 --> 3:37:14.820]  Gary Cohn the president's chief economic advisor or
[3:37:15.500 --> 3:37:17.500]  or Sheila
[3:37:17.500 --> 3:37:24.300]  Pardon me, Dina Habib Powell who I spoke of in the first section best friends with whom I abed in
[3:37:24.300 --> 3:37:25.460]  the
[3:37:25.460 --> 3:37:27.460]  former Bush White House aid
[3:37:28.020 --> 3:37:36.220]  At the same time, I think it is manifestly unfair for mr. Kushner to be hung in the Russian hysteria
[3:37:36.900 --> 3:37:39.260]  Because he may may
[3:37:39.900 --> 3:37:48.820]  Have opened a back channel of communications with the Russians after the election and in his role as a White House aid
[3:37:49.340 --> 3:37:51.340]  one can presume
[3:37:51.340 --> 3:37:56.700]  That the president instructed him to do that which the president has the authority to do
[3:37:57.220 --> 3:38:04.260]  So let's not hang. Let's not convict Jared Kushner unfairly at the same time
[3:38:04.860 --> 3:38:11.220]  The sooner he's back to the family real estate enterprise and out of the Bush White House
[3:38:11.220 --> 3:38:18.900]  I think the greater the chances are that the president will not be distracted from the agenda that elected him
[3:38:18.900 --> 3:38:24.780]  You see the answer to Donald Trump's survival is twofold one
[3:38:25.780 --> 3:38:31.620]  keep faith with the voters as you did in your in your
[3:38:32.220 --> 3:38:38.340]  Pledge to deregulate in your pledge to cut the regulations that are destroying business in this country
[3:38:38.340 --> 3:38:42.620]  Which can put as much as two trillion dollars back into the budget
[3:38:43.140 --> 3:38:47.940]  keep faith with the American voters as you have done despite the
[3:38:47.940 --> 3:38:51.260]  the advice of White House advisors to withdraw
[3:38:52.020 --> 3:38:55.420]  America from the Paris climate Accords, which
[3:38:55.940 --> 3:39:02.620]  Will really not address the issue of emissions, but will strangle the American economy
[3:39:03.020 --> 3:39:05.580]  So if the president doesn't need an outside
[3:39:06.260 --> 3:39:11.380]  War room or a PR offensive he needs to stick to the agenda that got him elected and
[3:39:12.420 --> 3:39:16.380]  He needs to order his Justice Department to proceed
[3:39:16.380 --> 3:39:21.900]  Against those who are leaking this fake Russian canard
[3:39:22.580 --> 3:39:24.380]  Mr. Hayden
[3:39:24.380 --> 3:39:26.380]  Mr. Clapper
[3:39:26.380 --> 3:39:29.380]  Mr. Brennan Ms. Rice
[3:39:29.700 --> 3:39:35.940]  It's time for them to tell the grand jury exactly what they were doing
[3:39:36.700 --> 3:39:41.340]  You see the laws have been broken here. That is correct
[3:39:41.340 --> 3:39:46.620]  But they haven't been broken by President Trump or members of the White House staff
[3:39:47.180 --> 3:39:54.980]  They've been broken by those in the deep state and the intelligence agencies who seek to undermine our president and
[3:39:55.860 --> 3:40:03.060]  The president must use the judicial process to enforce the law and turn the tables on
[3:40:03.420 --> 3:40:06.060]  The leakers on the tormentors
[3:40:06.060 --> 3:40:10.860]  My confidence is 100% in President Donald Trump
[3:40:10.860 --> 3:40:18.620]  And I hope he acts aggressively to save himself from the inside quiz links. Let's go to Tim
[3:40:18.620 --> 3:40:21.740]  Thank you, Dan. Let's go to Tim in Seattle
[3:40:24.700 --> 3:40:28.500]  Yeah, Mr. Stone, thank you very much for taking my call. It is definitely
[3:40:29.220 --> 3:40:31.220]  An honor to talk to an American hero
[3:40:31.220 --> 3:40:36.280]  Uh, but my my concern was that the mental illness of these
[3:40:37.100 --> 3:40:40.860]  Hollywood types as death cult that they have it doesn't seem to stop and
[3:40:42.460 --> 3:40:47.140]  She will have been putting themselves out in the public narrative as role models for children
[3:40:47.140 --> 3:40:50.740]  I just think that in 10 or 15 years
[3:40:50.740 --> 3:40:54.620]  We're gonna look back at hindsight and realize that if we don't do something now
[3:40:54.620 --> 3:41:00.940]  That at least to protect our children from this this communist narrative this death cult that they have
[3:41:01.660 --> 3:41:03.660]  We're all making pretty big mistakes
[3:41:04.620 --> 3:41:09.420]  That's about it. Thanks. Well, Tim. Thank you for your comment. I couldn't agree with you more
[3:41:09.420 --> 3:41:17.100]  You know, I go back to the days when we were you know when we had partisanship when there was honest
[3:41:17.540 --> 3:41:20.180]  disagreement between Republicans and Democrats
[3:41:20.180 --> 3:41:24.020]  But that both parties were still
[3:41:24.860 --> 3:41:26.860]  dominated by patriotic
[3:41:26.900 --> 3:41:31.300]  Americans who were dedicated to the a better future for America. I
[3:41:31.900 --> 3:41:38.660]  Don't understand what's happened to the Democratic Party of John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman and patriotic
[3:41:39.540 --> 3:41:43.060]  anti-communist Americans. Yes, they were left of center
[3:41:43.060 --> 3:41:50.500]  But they weren't traitors and they weren't embracing a foreign ideology, which is it is an ideology of death
[3:41:51.180 --> 3:41:55.860]  They stood up for free expression today. They stand up for censorship
[3:41:56.900 --> 3:42:02.060]  It's it's a sickness and it's a sea change in American politics
[3:42:02.060 --> 3:42:04.780]  It's not good old-fashioned partisanship now
[3:42:04.780 --> 3:42:09.220]  We have the loony left in control of the Democratic Party and
[3:42:09.220 --> 3:42:15.300]  And committed to a to a dark dark future for this country
[3:42:15.300 --> 3:42:20.060]  It is the most important battle that we face. Thank you very much for your call
[3:42:20.580 --> 3:42:24.820]  Let's go to Paul in Virginia Paul. You're on info wars
[3:42:27.300 --> 3:42:29.300]  Anybody says about you
[3:42:29.420 --> 3:42:34.260]  No matter how bad they get I still love you. I think you're great. You're fantastic
[3:42:34.260 --> 3:42:39.220]  And I believe you're risking your life and doing what you're doing and I have great respect for that
[3:42:39.700 --> 3:42:43.460]  Well, thank you. Thank you Paul. Let me just say the only thing worse
[3:42:44.100 --> 3:42:52.020]  Then being talked about is not being talked about and it is better to be infamous than never be famous at all
[3:42:52.020 --> 3:42:54.020]  Go ahead with your question
[3:42:54.140 --> 3:42:58.060]  It's all publicity, right? Yeah, well as long as they spell your name, right?
[3:42:59.260 --> 3:43:01.260]  There you go. I
[3:43:01.260 --> 3:43:05.740]  See a problem. I see you guys have done something fantastic
[3:43:06.780 --> 3:43:09.660]  That has never been done before by anybody
[3:43:10.340 --> 3:43:14.620]  Okay, you and info wars and even President Trump and everybody else
[3:43:15.020 --> 3:43:21.900]  But you're all sitting there and all you're doing now is counter punching. Okay, these guys are coming at you from the
[3:43:22.180 --> 3:43:30.020]  Universities which they control these guys are coming at you from the technology which they control and all you're doing is counter punching
[3:43:30.020 --> 3:43:33.740]  I think you need to focus strategically on
[3:43:34.380 --> 3:43:41.300]  Four or five main issues that take the power away from these corrupt people
[3:43:41.540 --> 3:43:44.040]  The university system has to go
[3:43:44.580 --> 3:43:49.780]  Okay, the people that run technologies such as Google they have to go
[3:43:50.260 --> 3:43:58.140]  You can't just complain that they they they they they screwed you on the search results and took you off their listings
[3:43:58.140 --> 3:44:00.620]  You have to start
[3:44:01.460 --> 3:44:06.180]  Campaigns to destroy the university system and replace it with something more
[3:44:06.980 --> 3:44:13.340]  Intellectual and easier and less cheaper. You have to destroy technology that people that control it
[3:44:14.140 --> 3:44:18.020]  You need to support things like for instance taking NASA public
[3:44:18.060 --> 3:44:22.100]  so it gets all the technology out of the hands of these nimwits like
[3:44:22.100 --> 3:44:28.420]  Like Google and Facebook and Twitter and all the rest of these folks and you control it
[3:44:28.420 --> 3:44:30.420]  You control the narrative
[3:44:30.420 --> 3:44:32.700]  Universities don't need to be where they are today
[3:44:32.700 --> 3:44:37.420]  They need to be online and they need to be free and you just pay for the test
[3:44:37.820 --> 3:44:42.860]  Well, Paul, let me let me address your point. I could not agree more first of all
[3:44:42.860 --> 3:44:49.420]  I think it's important to note that although Obama turned control of the Internet over to the United Nations
[3:44:49.420 --> 3:44:52.540]  Because the United Nations has never
[3:44:53.300 --> 3:44:58.060]  Renumerated the United States for that that bargain that agreement
[3:44:58.580 --> 3:45:07.020]  Can be abrogated and control of the Internet should be restored to the United States government or the United States
[3:45:07.740 --> 3:45:09.740]  Because we invented it
[3:45:10.380 --> 3:45:15.980]  Secondarily, you're absolutely right. The Trump Justice Department must immediately bring anti-trust actions
[3:45:15.980 --> 3:45:21.420]  Against Google against Facebook against Twitter against Yahoo against Amazon
[3:45:22.380 --> 3:45:24.380]  They shouldn't be allowed to censor
[3:45:25.100 --> 3:45:32.900]  The American people they shouldn't be allowed to censor the alternative media. We need a robust vibrant
[3:45:33.860 --> 3:45:40.460]  Alternative media to preserve the gains of the last year and to make America great again
[3:45:40.460 --> 3:45:47.980]  So I thank you for your call and I fundamentally agree with you. It's time for the president and his administration to get on
[3:45:48.540 --> 3:45:51.900]  offense, let's go if we can to
[3:45:53.660 --> 3:46:01.300]  Courtney who says she's in FEMA region six. I'm not sure where that is, but maybe she'll tell us Courtney. Welcome to Info Wars
[3:46:01.300 --> 3:46:03.140]  What's your question?
[3:46:03.140 --> 3:46:08.940]  Hi, actually, I had an idea for the one of the search for the Kathy Griffin
[3:46:08.940 --> 3:46:10.940]  I'm
[3:46:10.980 --> 3:46:12.980]  Whole fiasco
[3:46:12.980 --> 3:46:17.180]  If she wants to embrace ISIS and the death cult that it is
[3:46:17.740 --> 3:46:26.260]  Y'all should design a shirt with her in a hijab because hey if she wants to embrace it make her be a part of it
[3:46:27.380 --> 3:46:35.220]  Yeah, of course, we both know that it doesn't work that way these Hollywood elitists say it's pretty much do as I say
[3:46:35.220 --> 3:46:39.300]  Not as I do they live in their gated communities
[3:46:39.300 --> 3:46:42.660]  They have their bodyguards who are heavily armed
[3:46:42.660 --> 3:46:50.140]  But they don't want you to have a second amendment right and they don't want you to have any security in your home
[3:46:50.540 --> 3:46:56.740]  This is the hypocrisy of the Hollywood left. Thanks for your call Courtney
[3:46:57.140 --> 3:47:01.660]  Let's go to Jesse here in Texas. Jesse. Tell us what's on your mind?
[3:47:01.660 --> 3:47:04.780]  Hey, Roger. How are you today? Excellent?
[3:47:05.620 --> 3:47:09.980]  One I've got they let Kathy Griffin go see and then let her go
[3:47:10.940 --> 3:47:12.140]  to
[3:47:12.140 --> 3:47:16.780]  Comey's gonna testify after he's been talking to Mueller. He's gonna testify
[3:47:17.500 --> 3:47:20.940]  Next week maybe and three about six weeks ago
[3:47:21.500 --> 3:47:26.180]  You and Alex were talking about you had a congressman a retired congressman who was in bad health
[3:47:26.180 --> 3:47:33.460]  And you were gonna do an interview and he was gonna discredit Senator McCain. What can you tell us about that?
[3:47:33.460 --> 3:47:37.180]  Well, let me take those seriatim as the lawyers would say first of all
[3:47:37.700 --> 3:47:45.460]  I'm not sure. Mr. Comey now has a leg to stand on we have now been able to learn through the New York Times of all people
[3:47:46.100 --> 3:47:48.100]  that Mr. Comey
[3:47:48.100 --> 3:47:56.980]  Passed on the prosecution of Hillary Clinton in the email server case on the basis of a fake
[3:47:57.300 --> 3:48:02.980]  Memo which alleged that Loretta Lynch the attorney general in the Obama administration
[3:48:03.980 --> 3:48:09.820]  Had assured the Clinton campaign that they had nothing to worry about that she would essentially squelch
[3:48:10.460 --> 3:48:12.460]  the investigation
[3:48:12.740 --> 3:48:15.500]  Now that memo turns out to be fake
[3:48:15.500 --> 3:48:19.740]  Evidently many in the FBI knew it was fake
[3:48:20.220 --> 3:48:28.340]  But mr. Comey decided to give Hillary a walk on the basis that the case was fixed somewhere above him
[3:48:29.500 --> 3:48:32.540]  Now I'm not an attorney, but I think there's a crime there somewhere
[3:48:32.940 --> 3:48:37.620]  And he at least had an obligation to tell the truth to the American people
[3:48:37.620 --> 3:48:47.420]  The congressman you ask about is an exceedingly ill health. We have had some difficulty getting the interview because of
[3:48:48.420 --> 3:48:52.260]  a series of episodes of congestive heart failure
[3:48:52.700 --> 3:48:59.980]  But this is a congressman who served very closely with John McCain on the POW issue and I think can give
[3:49:00.900 --> 3:49:04.980]  specific insights to John McCain's mental state
[3:49:04.980 --> 3:49:09.900]  You see I think John McCain has become mentally unbalanced
[3:49:09.900 --> 3:49:16.980]  I think he is so driven by bitterness and anger over the fact that Donald Trump won a
[3:49:17.460 --> 3:49:24.340]  Coveted seat that John McCain has wanted his entire life and ran for twice and failed to obtain
[3:49:24.460 --> 3:49:30.860]  he is so blinded by bitterness and hatred that he deserves this president and he
[3:49:30.860 --> 3:49:38.540]  Dissembles about any contact between the Russians and Donald Trump or his associates or his campaign
[3:49:39.020 --> 3:49:41.020]  So mr. McCain
[3:49:41.460 --> 3:49:48.180]  Unfortunately, there is no law in Arizona for the recall of a United States senator
[3:49:48.740 --> 3:49:56.020]  Because if there was I'd be in Phoenix right now working for it. Thank you so much Jesse for your call

[3:54:12.180 --> 3:54:17.940]  Welcome back. I'm Roger Stone. That's the immortal Johnny Horton and
[3:54:17.940 --> 3:54:24.780]  And a good opening for our final segment here as I sit in for my friend Alex Jones
[3:54:25.940 --> 3:54:33.380]  We had extraordinary news on May 24th when circa news in a piece by John Solomon and Sarah Carter
[3:54:33.620 --> 3:54:37.900]  Broke the news that Obama and his intelligence agencies
[3:54:38.580 --> 3:54:43.940]  Conducted illegal surveillance and searches of thousands of Americans
[3:54:43.940 --> 3:54:49.580]  How convenient that they waited until the closing days of the Obama administration
[3:54:50.380 --> 3:54:58.020]  Only days before Donald Trump would take office to disclose this and they were spanked by the super secret
[3:54:58.580 --> 3:55:00.580]  FISA court
[3:55:00.700 --> 3:55:04.380]  Now rather than just let this go by the wayside
[3:55:05.060 --> 3:55:10.940]  another way that President Trump can get on the offensive is to instruct
[3:55:10.940 --> 3:55:18.860]  Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a special counsel a special prosecutor to look into these
[3:55:19.500 --> 3:55:23.220]  violations who ordered them and who knew about them I
[3:55:24.500 --> 3:55:30.500]  Recommend the appointment of former US Attorney David Marston of Philadelphia and enormously
[3:55:31.420 --> 3:55:33.420]  respected and able
[3:55:33.580 --> 3:55:37.660]  Prosecutor in his day now practicing law in private practice
[3:55:37.660 --> 3:55:41.700]  I would bring him back to public service to get to the bottom of
[3:55:42.260 --> 3:55:47.340]  Obama's spy nation because this will lead in
[3:55:47.980 --> 3:55:52.300]  Excerably back to the question of whether there was indeed
[3:55:53.100 --> 3:56:00.340]  surveillance at Trump Tower before the election our friend Judge Andrew Napolitano has
[3:56:00.780 --> 3:56:04.820]  Correctly told the American people that British intelligence
[3:56:04.820 --> 3:56:10.860]  alone was involved in the surveillance of Trump Tower
[3:56:11.420 --> 3:56:17.420]  Which means that FBI Director Comey and former NSA Director Mike Rogers
[3:56:17.820 --> 3:56:24.700]  Perjured themselves in front of the House Intelligence Committee when they said that there was no
[3:56:25.460 --> 3:56:27.460]  surveillance at Trump Tower
[3:56:27.460 --> 3:56:35.140]  That's a lie and those gentlemen knew it was a lie and
[3:56:35.740 --> 3:56:42.140]  If it is true that no person is above the law then the prosecution of mr. Comey
[3:56:42.540 --> 3:56:45.460]  And mr. Rogers would be in order
[3:56:46.140 --> 3:56:48.140]  But I'm not an attorney let
[3:56:48.820 --> 3:56:54.540]  Attorney Marston for example determine whether laws have been broken
[3:56:54.540 --> 3:57:01.700]  One final thought to support the fight for freedom. You can go to the info wars comm store or
[3:57:02.220 --> 3:57:06.420]  Info or store comm and get your copy of the making of the president

[3:57:31.220 --> 3:57:36.180]  The role they played in the historic victory of Donald Trump
[3:57:36.820 --> 3:57:42.220]  If you're a political junkie or if you're interested in how Trump pulled off
[3:57:42.780 --> 3:57:49.780]  The shocking upset of the century. This is the inside story. Now. This is not some dry
[3:57:49.780 --> 3:57:55.100]  Political science tome. You'll get the inside skinny on
[3:57:55.500 --> 3:58:00.820]  Corey Lewandowski and how he almost drove the Trump campaign into the gutter
[3:58:01.420 --> 3:58:09.380]  And how Donald Trump is the man most responsible for orchestrating the greatest victory
[3:58:09.500 --> 3:58:16.220]  In Republican history a victory even greater than that of our beloved former president
[3:58:16.220 --> 3:58:24.740]  Ronald Reagan so thank you for joining me here at info wars go to the info store comm and give us the support
