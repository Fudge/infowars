[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:35.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:35.480 --> 00:44.000]  we have neurologist brain surgeon dr. Russell Blalock joining us to talk
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.480]  about vaccines and brain damage in their history of causing brain damage that
[00:50.480 --> 00:56.880]  is coming up in the third hour today two hours from now about text Mars popping
[00:56.880 --> 01:02.320]  in because I wanted to get his take on the first lady's mother doing voodoo
[01:02.320 --> 01:08.080]  rituals according to multiple mainstream media reports at the White
[01:08.080 --> 01:13.680]  House and why is the media getting so upset by this I mean the bushes do the
[01:13.680 --> 01:18.160]  satanic skull and bones rituals most the conservative Christian leaders go to
[01:18.160 --> 01:25.280]  Bohemian Grove for homosexual pagan rituals most of your quote liberals
[01:25.280 --> 01:30.880]  are into Aztec rebirthing rituals or classical European witchcraft like
[01:30.880 --> 01:38.040]  Tony Blair and his wife sherry Blair I mean is this a racism issue is a voodoo
[01:38.040 --> 01:45.240]  code word for the n-word I'm being a little bit sarcastic but serious at the
[01:45.240 --> 01:50.660]  same time the media will probably say that now you don't like chopping the
[01:50.660 --> 01:57.160]  heads off of chickens you're you're you're racist by all means join in
[01:57.160 --> 02:05.560]  immediately remember what happened with Hillary Clinton and the seances and
[02:05.560 --> 02:10.320]  the shaman I mean these people are just complete nutcases you read all the
[02:10.320 --> 02:16.160]  official United Nations documents and treaties it talks about a cultic Gaia
[02:16.160 --> 02:22.640]  religions and the rest of it so the truth is the atheistic world elite are
[02:22.640 --> 02:28.320]  not atheistic they want you to be atheistic but they are the most superstitious
[02:28.320 --> 02:35.160]  backward crew of people you talk about old-time religion they follow all the
[02:35.160 --> 02:41.400]  different faiths that predate Christianity just a fact I'm just
[02:41.400 --> 02:47.600]  stating a fact here so we're gonna be going over all of that today also there's
[02:47.600 --> 02:56.600]  been a lot of concealed carry going on around the nation as people turn their
[02:56.600 --> 03:00.400]  rights into a privilege I'm not attacking you if you have a concealed
[03:00.400 --> 03:05.520]  carry it's just that the corrupt illegitimate corporate state engages in
[03:05.520 --> 03:12.600]  a form of alchemy and they permit something that is illegal under common
[03:12.600 --> 03:18.440]  law under the Bill of Rights and Constitution concealing weapons is what
[03:18.440 --> 03:25.200]  criminals do free men bear arms openly and it causes very polite very low crime
[03:25.200 --> 03:32.520]  level society but then they trick you to turn your right into a privilege and
[03:32.520 --> 03:36.600]  get a permit for something that would be illegal and then that sends the message
[03:36.600 --> 03:41.920]  that guns carrying guns are illegal unless you do it concealed so a complete
[03:41.920 --> 03:48.560]  perversion of the ancient common law and what we follow in this nation and by
[03:48.560 --> 03:53.400]  that they create the practice and the perception that carrying firearms openly
[03:53.400 --> 03:59.000]  is illegal you try to drive down the road in Texas with a rifle in your pickup
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.800]  truck rifle rack even in the country cops will pull you over a lot of times
[04:04.800 --> 04:09.160]  every week I read about some old gunsmith working on guns in their garage
[04:09.160 --> 04:12.080]  you're putting a rifle in their car and the SWAT team hits them and hits them
[04:12.080 --> 04:15.440]  hard and they go ahead and take the guns go ahead and indict them for crimes
[04:15.440 --> 04:21.080]  that don't exist saying guns are illegal you see in the news man arrested for four
[04:21.080 --> 04:25.160]  guns and thousand rounds of ammo dangerous arsenal the guns were legal but
[04:25.160 --> 04:30.080]  it doesn't matter he's still being charged as a terrorist so the people are
[04:30.080 --> 04:36.800]  striking back all over the nation from Phoenix Arizona two places in New
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.520]  Hampshire carrying handguns and rifles openly it happened in Phoenix
[04:41.520 --> 04:48.480]  yesterday it really upset the Liberals a clean-cut sharp well-spoken black man
[04:48.480 --> 04:56.800]  with a AR-15 it was like kryptonite to the enemy we'll be right back

[11:41.760 --> 11:47.080]  some of what's coming up today and just a moment after I mentioned some of the
[11:47.080 --> 11:53.520]  other news and audio and video clips are gonna be playing I'm gonna just briefly
[11:53.520 --> 12:02.040]  in 10-15 minutes break down all of the mainstream media coming out and having
[12:02.040 --> 12:05.520]  to admit that the flu shots killing people but then why is the government
[12:05.520 --> 12:11.920]  moving ahead with forced inoculation and how that ties in with governor's
[12:11.920 --> 12:15.640]  association and former members of congress and current members of
[12:15.640 --> 12:22.840]  congress and former leaders of the house dick army republican leader former
[12:22.840 --> 12:28.240]  leader of the house saying they may use the flu outbreak to ram through
[12:28.240 --> 12:35.520]  emergency powers and the socialized healthcare bill martial law not just that
[12:35.520 --> 12:40.840]  we're in danger of this happening but praise god this is now mainstream news
[12:40.840 --> 12:47.080]  I mean everything we're talking about ten years ago five years ago a year ago
[12:47.080 --> 12:53.600]  six months ago is now mainstream and this radio show is becoming more and
[12:53.600 --> 12:57.240]  more mainstream not because we're changing we're getting more radical I'm
[12:57.240 --> 13:01.400]  telling you really like it is now years ago I sometimes I wouldn't come out with
[13:01.400 --> 13:04.920]  the really hardcore info because people weren't ready for it they couldn't handle
[13:04.920 --> 13:13.680]  it but now people are ready for the truth and this country really is entering a
[13:13.680 --> 13:20.280]  revolution people can feel the momentum shifting it is so exciting but there will
[13:20.280 --> 13:34.120]  be countervailing counterattacks from the establishment from the empire so it's
[13:34.120 --> 13:41.840]  just an incredible time to be alive it's a very very amazing time to be alive
[13:41.840 --> 13:47.040]  right now and to see all of this happening
[13:47.040 --> 13:52.320]  because there have been many times in history when more happens in a year or
[13:52.320 --> 13:58.720]  two then happened in the previous hundred that is in political shifts
[13:58.720 --> 14:06.400]  technological development leaps forward and we've seen the strong steady march
[14:06.400 --> 14:16.920]  of the scientific dictatorship run by the eugenics science elite against
[14:16.920 --> 14:23.040]  free humanity and it's a devastating effect but there's an ingrained
[14:23.040 --> 14:28.240]  pre-designed predestined code or programming in the human psyche to
[14:28.240 --> 14:34.760]  resist threats to the species and this elite is a threat to the species with
[14:34.760 --> 14:41.640]  their opens air genetic engineering cross species hybrids their chimeras the
[14:41.640 --> 14:45.720]  weapons systems they've developed this is the fish infusion quantum mechanics
[14:45.720 --> 14:52.520]  accelerators they've developed the cyclotrons everything they're doing at
[14:52.520 --> 14:58.640]  a species level and the way it's being deployed is a threat to the planet and a
[14:58.640 --> 15:08.120]  threat to humanity and all of humanity free humanity and the tyrants that are
[15:08.120 --> 15:19.000]  trying to ride the tiger we all have a collective Saturn booster rocket system
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.760]  strapped to our backs we are entering we have now entered look we should have a
[15:25.760 --> 15:35.400]  countdown here we have now entered the deciding set of circumstances in time
[15:35.400 --> 15:42.880]  that will decide the future of the species we have now entered the crossroads we
[15:42.880 --> 15:48.160]  have now entered the launch pad we are now on the launch pad choosing the jump
[15:48.160 --> 15:52.440]  point that we are going to take as a species and the elite are trying to
[15:52.440 --> 15:56.240]  wrestle the controls away from the people they've set up their surveillance
[15:56.240 --> 16:01.320]  their technocracy their control grid their giant technological termination
[16:01.320 --> 16:07.320]  extermination genocide system and we are literally at the control struggling
[16:07.320 --> 16:12.360]  with the establishment those of us that are awake and involved know that we've
[16:12.360 --> 16:16.040]  got to pour out our maximum effort in the days and weeks and months and years to
[16:16.040 --> 16:20.320]  come the enemy knows they've got to pour out their maximum effort there is a
[16:20.320 --> 16:27.480]  life-and-death struggle right now at the control panel with these people and
[16:27.480 --> 16:31.800]  that's why my life doesn't even really mean anything anymore I'm not even
[16:31.800 --> 16:37.960]  worried about them killing me at all before I had some fear which was healthy
[16:37.960 --> 16:46.880]  though I hadn't you know masculine bravado or macho but but but still there
[16:46.880 --> 16:50.760]  was a little bit of that tingle that gave me an edge now the only edge I've
[16:50.760 --> 16:55.720]  got is survival of the species as we hurdle in head up against this system
[16:55.720 --> 17:02.320]  and it's a strange feeling to laugh at the Cointel pro to laugh at the death
[17:02.320 --> 17:06.280]  threats to laugh at the federal agents to be able to just sit there and yell at
[17:06.280 --> 17:10.120]  them when they show up and not have any fear instead you have the opposite
[17:10.120 --> 17:15.440]  because it just doesn't I mean if they these men and women that serve the evil
[17:15.440 --> 17:23.760]  system had knew any of what I know or any of what millions of you know then
[17:23.760 --> 17:27.960]  they would join us immediately there's no question about this if they knew the
[17:27.960 --> 17:32.400]  cost if they knew the terrain if they knew the battlefield if they knew who
[17:32.400 --> 17:37.880]  the real players were if they knew who they're working for there is no doubt
[17:37.880 --> 17:47.640]  this would end very very quickly I'm having shells right now can't believe
[17:47.640 --> 17:54.480]  it because it is horror ladies and gentlemen it is horror to a degree I
[17:54.480 --> 18:01.040]  could have never imagined it is organized it is mechanized it is focused
[18:01.040 --> 18:08.600]  death and it is a fact they're putting poisons in the water about designed to
[18:08.600 --> 18:13.040]  dumb us down and sterilize us and brain damages it is a fact they're putting in
[18:13.040 --> 18:17.360]  the GMO food that is designed to sterilize you and cause all sorts of
[18:17.360 --> 18:21.480]  hormonal endocrine disruptions in the brain and the rest of the body it had
[18:21.480 --> 18:25.520]  top scientist on who discovered it and what they were being told at the FDA and
[18:25.520 --> 18:30.520]  the EPA and at top biotech companies they know these are pharmacological
[18:30.520 --> 18:38.520]  crops you're eating you don't know what that is go research it and I look back
[18:38.520 --> 18:44.400]  on myself in the past caring about how I look caring about what people say about
[18:44.400 --> 18:53.520]  me I mean I cared less than most but now I don't care one bit because what does it
[18:53.520 --> 18:59.160]  matter in the final equation reality is so much more wild and so much more
[18:59.160 --> 19:05.280]  incredible and so much deeper than the limited perspective that the general
[19:05.280 --> 19:10.960]  public is living under how do we unlock people's minds not to see what I'm
[19:10.960 --> 19:14.680]  seeing not to believe what I'm saying just to look around you and look for
[19:14.680 --> 19:20.960]  yourself one cannot be told about the rabbit hole one has to go down it
[19:20.960 --> 19:27.680]  themselves one cannot be told about the matrix one has to see it and it is the
[19:27.680 --> 19:36.560]  world that's been pulled over your eyes to hide the truth from you and it does
[19:36.560 --> 19:39.840]  take courage to admit the truth but once you have the courage and look at the

[23:15.680 --> 23:19.640]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people while
[23:19.640 --> 23:24.320]  Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a
[23:24.320 --> 23:28.480]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[23:28.480 --> 23:33.680]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[23:33.680 --> 23:39.640]  that's fascism it's not about left-to-right it's about a one-world

[24:32.640 --> 24:38.400]  being capital quiet about internal federal government memos about not
[24:38.400 --> 24:43.600]  telling the public that the swine flu shots killing people with different
[24:43.600 --> 24:53.920]  brain damage diseases like Gillian Bernays now what did we tell you months
[24:53.920 --> 24:57.400]  ago this is gonna do Gillian Bernays we're on record because that's what it
[24:57.400 --> 25:06.720]  does what it's designed to do these are chemical lobotomies they caused the
[25:06.720 --> 25:14.120]  brain to basically go through an autoimmune response they swell up I

[25:35.120 --> 25:42.240]  go to YouTube and type in swine flu 60 minutes and watch a 20 minute special on
[25:42.240 --> 25:46.520]  it with all the dead people and people in wheelchairs and paralyzed people and
[25:46.520 --> 25:52.240]  by the way they just do this and put it out there publicly they just come out
[25:52.240 --> 25:56.840]  and go yeah Gardasil kills you and the flu shots gonna kill you and the more
[25:56.840 --> 26:00.920]  they say it kills you the more moms line up to shoot their kids up it's like
[26:00.920 --> 26:05.200]  there under some kind of zombie control it's like false of doom and Conan the
[26:05.200 --> 26:09.480]  barbarian talking to the girl upon the ledge 200 feet above saying come to me
[26:09.480 --> 26:15.360]  come to me my child come to me and she just jumps off and bam bounces on the
[26:15.360 --> 26:24.000]  concrete ground and it's as if it's a sign of education a sign of culture a
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.800]  sign of the fact you're informed that if you say governments corrupt or
[26:28.800 --> 26:33.400]  vaccines have a dangerous history that oh that's just a conspiracy theory and
[26:33.400 --> 26:44.280]  it's a sign of your intelligence you know what I absolutely totally am gonna
[26:44.280 --> 26:52.600]  do 30 minutes uninterrupted at the bottom of the next hour before dr.
[26:52.600 --> 26:57.480]  Blalox on with us and then text Mars on the martial law on the police state on
[26:57.480 --> 27:03.960]  the forced inoculations on the tyranny but what I want to talk about until we
[27:03.960 --> 27:07.800]  get there is just all the different news a bunch of different clips I want to
[27:07.800 --> 27:14.920]  play and your phone calls I'll do it that way but I will tell my producers in
[27:14.920 --> 27:20.520]  there at 12 30 in an hour and three minutes make sure at that point I don't
[27:20.520 --> 27:27.720]  take calls and then I cover all these congressmen governors association and I
[27:27.720 --> 27:32.000]  know I've mentioned this but think of the magnitude they're coming out and
[27:32.000 --> 27:38.920]  saying word for word what I have been the lone voice saying was going to
[27:38.920 --> 27:45.720]  happen and I'm not tooting my horn I'm telling you folks you need to listen to
[27:45.720 --> 27:50.360]  what I talk about I understand the enemy's operation all I do is study
[27:50.360 --> 27:57.000]  this and we understand who the enemy is what makes them tick what their program
[27:57.000 --> 28:03.240]  is and how to beat them we can beat these people so when I tell you that we are
[28:03.240 --> 28:08.320]  already in a revolution of awakening a peaceful revolution of info war and the
[28:08.320 --> 28:13.760]  establishment is going to try to make it violent and I wonder why I've seen the
[28:13.760 --> 28:18.400]  Co until pro putting out massive disinfo all over even mainstream media and
[28:18.400 --> 28:23.360]  alternatives saying I'm calling for violence when I'm not to set me and
[28:23.360 --> 28:27.920]  others up if they do drop the hammer which again means I'm doing the good
[28:27.920 --> 28:31.880]  job when I have the Southern Primary Law Center and ADL put me at the top of the
[28:31.880 --> 28:37.600]  list for no reason when I have congressional reports attacking me when
[28:37.600 --> 28:43.600]  we have this going on it means I'm doing my job and it means you're doing your

[35:26.800 --> 35:33.200]  guns and they show the image of a handgun those are all over Texas since I
[35:33.200 --> 35:39.760]  was in high school we're talking 18 years or longer that I've been seeing
[35:39.760 --> 35:43.680]  those there and I'll be in other parts of the country California Florida I see

[36:05.160 --> 36:10.280]  dear rifle on the back of my Mustang hatchback to go hunting and later my
[36:10.280 --> 36:12.880]  neighbor told me the cops showed up and we're asking questions that's the
[36:12.880 --> 36:17.840]  America I live in where they're teaching us our guns are taboo and dirty and bad
[36:17.840 --> 36:22.560]  but their cameras and checkpoints and SWAT teams and regular army on the
[36:22.560 --> 36:26.080]  streets and Marine Corps on the streets that's normal and regular army
[36:26.080 --> 36:31.120]  searching people of the Kentucky Derby in the Super Bowl that's normal but an

[36:36.560 --> 36:40.000]  they come in and make fun of his dead rotten body dead for a week on the
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.680]  ground in his house and then the cops openly steal his guns on inside the
[36:43.680 --> 36:49.000]  LAPD and say I'm gonna keep this one I'm gonna keep that one they're so criminal
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.040]  they think it's normal to steal the guy's guns on TV just like we had cops

[40:59.160 --> 41:03.960]  let's stop chasing them for now and then catch up with them later
[41:03.960 --> 41:15.600]  so that's going on also record numbers of British and US troops being killed in
[41:15.600 --> 41:20.400]  Afghanistan and Pakistan now on the border region President Obama urged
[41:20.400 --> 41:25.040]  more than 5,000 veterans gathered here to brace for a daunting and perhaps
[41:25.040 --> 41:28.920]  bloody period ahead in Afghanistan but told them he believes the war is
[41:28.920 --> 41:35.640]  fundamental the defense of our people an opium war first it was a doubling and
[41:35.640 --> 41:39.680]  then tripling and then quadrupling and then eight times now the State
[41:39.680 --> 41:47.240]  Department admits there's 12 times the opium 12 times the opium flowing out of
[41:47.240 --> 41:54.240]  Afghanistan to the Western world 12 times more than double the previous record
[41:54.240 --> 42:00.960]  from the 1980s late 1980s 12 times what do you think the Russians wanted
[42:00.960 --> 42:05.280]  Afghanistan because they like desert mountains and then they liked it because
[42:05.280 --> 42:08.960]  they like getting shot at they wanted the opium all these big governments deal
[42:08.960 --> 42:14.200]  drugs because they get to control criminal syndicates worldwide and
[42:14.200 --> 42:17.200]  launder the money and leverage it through fractional reserve banking and
[42:17.200 --> 42:23.680]  derivatives a thousand to one you think you're over there to help the Afghan
[42:23.680 --> 42:29.320]  children man that's funny just like Iraq they didn't want a secular government
[42:29.320 --> 42:33.560]  over there with colleges and 60% of the college grads being women so they went
[42:33.560 --> 42:36.440]  over there and blew the hell out of it and put the Muslim extremists in
[42:36.440 --> 42:42.400]  operation victorious because radical Islam is the sword of the new oral order
[42:42.400 --> 42:48.680]  it's a fact declassified and if a country tries to give their people
[42:48.680 --> 42:52.640]  industrialization all the Muslim extremists overthrow your country and
[42:52.640 --> 42:58.120]  then play the part of the pretext for the US forces to come in the very very
[42:58.120 --> 43:05.360]  sick sick sick system of course Pat Tillman the big football star found out
[43:05.360 --> 43:10.280]  about that so they killed him and they killed him real good you're not about
[43:10.280 --> 43:22.920]  to cut in to 500 billion dollars a smack a year trillions and smack money trillions
[43:22.920 --> 43:31.400]  they get to leverage trillions the bankers get you understand and I get
[43:31.400 --> 43:36.960]  almost ran off the road a month ago as I was listening to XM BBC and they
[43:36.960 --> 43:41.360]  reported what I already knew but to hear it out of their mouths and to have them
[43:41.360 --> 43:48.240]  report it like it was no big deal like they were talking about the price of
[43:48.240 --> 43:52.120]  pork belly futures or something you know the price of bacon that they were
[43:52.120 --> 43:57.480]  just reporting on it very nonchalantly as if it was good calling evil good and
[43:57.480 --> 43:59.760]  good evil
[44:01.760 --> 44:05.560]  in fact they archive all that stuff now it was about a month a month and a half
[44:05.560 --> 44:12.320]  ago BBC report on Afghanistan on on on on on opium poppies somebody ought to go
[44:12.320 --> 44:15.120]  find it put it on YouTube they have a complete archive now that they say they
[44:15.120 --> 44:18.960]  do wouldn't be surprised that gets deep six though now we've mentioned it but
[44:18.960 --> 44:25.520]  the point is they go on they say well the US and British forces US and British
[44:25.520 --> 44:31.600]  forces God the poppy opium fields because if they don't the Taliban will come in
[44:31.600 --> 44:36.520]  and get a stronghold but by growing and helping deliver the poppies to market
[44:36.520 --> 44:41.080]  coalition forces keep the Taliban from getting a stronghold by supporting these
[44:41.080 --> 44:45.720]  farmers in their me go way of life they have a future and they're helping build
[44:45.720 --> 44:50.920]  of freedom in Afghanistan of course the truth is the Taliban and al-Qaeda are
[44:50.920 --> 44:55.160]  there to guard the poppy fields the regions of six seven different tribes
[44:55.160 --> 45:00.280]  control it they grow it the US and British guard it and ship it to market
[45:00.280 --> 45:05.800]  and pay them and that's why they're there but they spun it as if the Taliban
[45:05.800 --> 45:10.200]  has been kicked out now and oh they're there growing the poppies because if
[45:10.200 --> 45:14.360]  they don't grow the poppies the military guards the poppies and then they'll
[45:14.360 --> 45:18.200]  occasionally go eradicate a couple fields of some warlord that hasn't paid
[45:18.200 --> 45:25.080]  their cut you know they'll have a few pre-determined show events but then the
[45:25.080 --> 45:28.360]  cops will swat team you they will search you they will make you take your
[45:28.360 --> 45:31.800]  shoes off and airports they will check you getting on trains and buses oh my
[45:31.800 --> 45:36.480]  gosh you were found with one balloon of heroin oh my gosh you're such a criminal
[45:36.480 --> 45:40.040]  meanwhile they're shipping it in but of course they've got to do that they've
[45:40.040 --> 45:46.040]  got to make it illegal or it doesn't have that black market price and then
[45:46.040 --> 45:50.560]  these people wouldn't need to rob your car and stereo or sell their bodies
[45:50.560 --> 45:56.960]  feeding off the good public as a tax the drug trade is a government tax an
[45:56.960 --> 46:01.600]  illegal government tax and they have zombies of crackheads and heroin heads
[46:01.600 --> 46:07.440]  and drug addicts out robbing stealing kiting checks everything else to get the
[46:07.440 --> 46:14.040]  money so I'll tell everybody again do not ever tell your children it's not don't
[46:14.040 --> 46:18.600]  use drugs because you're not old enough or it's cool or you know the no explain
[46:18.600 --> 46:26.600]  it's dirty it's bad it's slavery it's chemical slavery don't ever use any of
[46:26.600 --> 46:30.400]  their filth none of it
[46:31.920 --> 46:37.280]  I'm gonna go to your calls just Obama warned soldiers coming days in Afghanistan
[46:37.280 --> 46:41.120]  will be bloody and now there's troops all down in Colombian surrounding areas
[46:41.120 --> 46:47.000]  US troops all about the drugs and CIA aircraft constantly crash full of pure
[46:47.000 --> 46:52.760]  cocaine and heroin it's just brushed under the rug in the news I mean there
[46:52.760 --> 46:58.160]  are so many flights that every few months one of their aircraft crashes our
[46:58.160 --> 47:01.840]  local police pull over a truck full of heroin the local cop doesn't listen
[47:01.840 --> 47:05.960]  when they flash Department of Defense or State Department badges so they kill
[47:05.960 --> 47:09.800]  the cop and they got to cover that up I mean they're just constantly doing
[47:09.800 --> 47:18.480]  whatever they want it's all such a sick joke I mean it is such a sick joke and
[47:18.480 --> 47:28.400]  they admit they're dealing the drugs on international British radio I mean how
[47:28.400 --> 47:39.120]  sick is that you can tell a cop that at a checkpoint you'll see good I'm sick of
[47:39.120 --> 47:43.160]  it all right let's talk to Daniel in Jersey Daniel or you're on the air go
[47:43.160 --> 47:48.300]  ahead hello Alex I think I know the big surprise move that Obama's gonna
[47:48.300 --> 47:53.680]  to pull out of his hat in September I'm expecting that he's going to amaze the
[47:53.680 --> 47:59.840]  world by succeeding where everyone else has failed by successfully mediating the
[47:59.840 --> 48:03.760]  prophetic peace contract between modern-day Israel and the Arab Islamic
[48:03.760 --> 48:08.120]  world and when he does that his popularity will soar his horrible
[48:08.120 --> 48:13.400]  legislative programs will sail through Congress and well now it's for film on a
[48:13.400 --> 48:17.280]  Bible prophecy if this contract has the four provisions that the Bible says the
[48:17.280 --> 48:23.000]  contract is gonna have yeah I don't see that happening with Benjamin yet in
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.360]  yahoo and every time there's a peace deal every time they've had hundreds of
[48:28.360 --> 48:33.720]  them people think it's the sign of the of certain interpretations of revelations
[48:33.720 --> 48:38.400]  I'm not saying the world isn't crazy I'm not saying there isn't mark of the
[48:38.400 --> 48:44.120]  beast biometrics and chips going in and total surveillance in that anything is
[48:44.120 --> 48:48.760]  possible but you know what we're gonna certainly find out aren't we yes and I
[48:48.760 --> 48:52.120]  think that's the kind of move we're gonna have and not something like a big
[48:52.120 --> 48:56.800]  9-11 terrorist event and it's gonna you know it'll be a he's right into power
[48:56.800 --> 49:02.080]  peacefully and prosperously and you know the Bible tells us that this it's got
[49:02.080 --> 49:07.440]  the four terms of that Israel well the Arab Islamic world will agree first for
[49:07.440 --> 49:10.880]  the first time that Israel's got a reason for a right to exist there as a
[49:10.880 --> 49:15.640]  nation it'll create the Palestinian state it'll place Jerusalem under
[49:15.640 --> 49:20.880]  international United Nations control and finally will allow the rebuilding of the
[49:20.880 --> 49:26.480]  inner court of King Solomon's temple 150 yards north of the dome of the rock at
[49:26.480 --> 49:30.120]  the site little gazebo the dome of the wills near it is interesting that all
[49:30.120 --> 49:35.560]  these deals do mirror what's in the Bible isn't it well you know if whoever the
[49:35.560 --> 49:40.600]  person is if not Obama someone else whoever does pull this success in
[49:40.600 --> 49:44.240]  media in this peace contract will know he's the anti-Christos the man who's
[49:44.240 --> 49:48.840]  coming pretending to be the Messiah the Arabs will think he's the body who's
[49:48.840 --> 49:53.720]  come out of a well the Jews will think he's the Messiah they've been waiting
[49:53.720 --> 49:58.640]  for the Hindi's will think he's a read 303 incarnation of Buddha and many
[49:58.640 --> 50:02.520]  Christians who are poorly schooled in Bible prophecy will think he's Jesus
[50:02.520 --> 50:05.920]  Christ return and that's how we're gonna succeed in getting this peace contract
[50:05.920 --> 50:11.640]  through well the issue is my Bible doesn't have the pre-rapture in it so
[50:11.640 --> 50:15.160]  what's gonna happen when Christians aren't taken out of this and they've
[50:15.160 --> 50:19.320]  been taught Romans 13 the clergy response teams worshiping government is
[50:19.320 --> 50:22.840]  the new gospel all the disciples knelt before government did whatever it's
[50:22.840 --> 50:28.440]  said basically how Hitler that was his favorite quote was Romans 13 they're
[50:28.440 --> 50:31.720]  gonna follow whatever they're told by this world government religious leader
[50:31.720 --> 50:41.080]  because their churches are telling them it's of God okay Alex thanks hey and

[55:16.200 --> 55:21.720]  it in legal awful areas but boldness of this level they're going to win just for
[55:21.720 --> 55:27.960]  the artistic level of skill and the great camera work they did in fact I
[55:27.960 --> 55:32.040]  wanted they're going to definitely win second place yeah there's still a bunch

[56:02.440 --> 56:08.400]  air hey what's going on Alex talking to you my friend hey listen man I want I
[56:08.400 --> 56:12.240]  want to say one thing to you and your staff you guys are doing absolutely
[56:12.240 --> 56:16.200]  magnificent work and you're waking up a lot of people I mean you get on and and
[56:16.200 --> 56:20.440]  yell and you get frustrated but a lot of people are waking up because of you I've
[56:20.440 --> 56:25.000]  woken up because of you and you gave somebody else on the air some advice I
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.440]  don't know if they took it but I certainly did I'm putting together a
[56:28.440 --> 56:33.120]  public access television show at the television station here in Chicago
[56:33.120 --> 56:37.640]  called the hidden news hour with sati word where we're going to be reporting on
[56:37.640 --> 56:43.480]  news event or world events that aren't appearing in the news magically and so
[56:43.480 --> 56:46.560]  it's going to be a couple of months away because I got to take a whole slew of
[56:46.560 --> 56:50.680]  classes only take took taking one of them so far but it's going to happen
[56:50.680 --> 56:55.240]  what I want the reason why I want to call bro is that there's a you know of
[56:55.240 --> 56:58.480]  course you know that's marrying you all over the place and it's absolutely
[56:58.480 --> 57:04.080]  ridiculous so all sorts of preposterous accusations but the one that really
[57:04.080 --> 57:08.360]  surprised me the most and you might know about it but I called just in case you
[57:08.360 --> 57:13.200]  didn't I came across this thing last night where they actually are saying
[57:13.200 --> 57:20.160]  that you are a secret operative of Israel and your job is to distract the
[57:20.160 --> 57:25.920]  man the world and and and get them to blame the Americans and the Europeans to
[57:25.920 --> 57:30.280]  take the distraction off the Jews who really are the evil ones and then they
[57:30.280 --> 57:35.240]  said their only evidence was hey did you know he's married to a Jew and then they
[57:35.240 --> 57:39.600]  had a picture here of your wife and you click something and it's not even
[57:39.600 --> 57:43.640]  click it but apparently you click it and get all this information to smear in
[57:43.640 --> 57:47.960]  your wife too it's absolutely listen I hear you I hear you and I'm gonna let
[57:47.960 --> 57:52.720]  you go only because I don't talk about all the attacks on me here on air
[57:52.720 --> 57:56.720]  because it's just people don't tune in for that I mean if people want to go
[57:56.720 --> 58:01.800]  read the articles I'm reading about how it's causing brain damage to take and
[58:01.800 --> 58:06.880]  killing people to take the flu vaccine the current one or how the governors are
[58:06.880 --> 58:11.000]  saying we don't want troops on the street I'm being smeared by foundation
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.680]  funded groups probably out of Israel that's how it works the Israeli lobby
[58:15.680 --> 58:21.120]  hits you with the anti-Semitism because they know how popular it is and all of
[58:21.120 --> 58:24.520]  this stuff started because me talking about how I have Native American
[58:24.520 --> 58:31.400]  background and my wife from family she had from Poland in relatives does have
[58:31.400 --> 58:35.800]  some Jewish background she's a Christian or family or Texas farmers and they're
[58:35.800 --> 58:40.320]  all Christians but that doesn't matter that comes from my show that for me

[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:23.120]  Alex Jones
[1:00:24.720 --> 1:00:30.000]  yeah to finish up the last guy's question Satie the strangest thing is we
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:38.840]  tracked back the claims that I worked for Israel from the Israeli lobby we've
[1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:43.560]  also tracked the disinfo that I'm some type of Jesuit agent and I'm not even
[1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:52.240]  Catholic my whole family's Protestant to the Israeli lobby so very bizarre and
[1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:58.280]  the Israeli lobby is very active inside the United States they know how whacked
[1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:02.280]  out the internet is and they do that kind of stuff the the issue is the
[1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:07.720]  information I cover here what are you gonna do with the information I cover
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:12.320]  I'm here talking about how the public's waking up how we're getting involved how
[1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:16.680]  we're having victories against tyranny how the flu shots killing people how
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:19.960]  they're putting poison in the water how they're eugenicists I'm giving you
[1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:24.480]  their own documents chapter and verse I'm telling the people to get out and
[1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:28.760]  active and vocal so they can see their own power that's what the Joker poster
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:33.600]  was about then the establishment cracks down on it tries to intimidate people
[1:01:33.600 --> 1:01:38.000]  not to do it then it only blows up bigger in their face I mean this is
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:44.760]  exciting and so ladies and gentlemen I am gonna have the establishment this is
[1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:48.640]  what the FBI said they did back in the 60s and 70s under Operation Chaos how
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:51.720]  would they break up the anti-war groups or pro-gun groups or
[1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:55.400]  conservative groups or land rights groups or Black Panthers they would come in
[1:01:55.400 --> 1:01:58.920]  with agents and sow seeds of dissension and they'd say the leader of your
[1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:04.560]  Chicago branch or your Detroit branch he's stealing the money or he's really
[1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:11.440]  working for the man or he's doing this or that you're gonna know who's working
[1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:14.920]  for the man they're gonna be calling for violence I could take one look at Hal
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:19.160]  Turner and tell you he was a Fed calling for killing this person kill that
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:22.680]  person it's gonna come out in federal court that he is a federal informant
[1:02:22.680 --> 1:02:31.440]  setting people up associated press he said that in court it's admitted when
[1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:36.320]  the feds come out and poses patriots they try to create dissension they try to
[1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:43.120]  create racism they try to black races white races Hispanic races they try to
[1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:47.960]  create division they tell you you don't have power they say everybody's a Fed
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:52.160]  that that that you know everybody should hide and not get involved and that you
[1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:55.200]  better creep around and you better not stick your head up or you're gonna get
[1:02:55.200 --> 1:03:00.080]  it and they talk about red and blue list all day trying to intimidate you
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:07.880]  trying to make you scared trying to make you shut up and stand down okay period
[1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:11.440]  that's how it works that's how it happens I mean the people that say
[1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:15.760]  because it's easy it's mindless it's simple to say Alex Jones works for the
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:20.200]  Vatican because he said guest on who happened to be Catholic and they'll
[1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:23.480]  create big list of every guest I've ever had on and if they're Catholic or not I
[1:03:23.480 --> 1:03:27.560]  don't think Catholics are bad people I think they're good pro-life people so I
[1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:33.200]  mean here let me just say it I'm Jewish and I'm Catholic and I also say I'm a
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:41.240]  reptoid I'm a reptoid fine I'm bad okay whatever the point is is that regardless
[1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:46.480]  we now have to face the issues regardless we now have to move forward and
[1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:49.520]  you know I'm really sad to say a lot of this isn't co-and-tell pro either it's
[1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:54.160]  just jealous angry people who are jealous at anybody's success and who are in
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:04:01.600]  this anti-new order movement to be stars or to be studs or to be celebrities and
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:06.520]  they're not successful because they're in this for the wrong reason and so they
[1:04:06.520 --> 1:04:11.440]  divide people along those lines I'm here trying to work with everybody and I've
[1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:17.240]  had incredible lies told about me my family just any lie you can imagine it's
[1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:23.880]  been told and it's all lies so I'm not really worried about it I'm more worried
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:27.000]  about the souls and the minds and the psychies of the people that believe
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:35.720]  their own baloney okay so it's just that simple I mean whenever I do criticize
[1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:41.400]  Israel the anti-Semites are so mentally ill they post the videos and say this was
[1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:45.000]  a secret radio show Alex did he didn't know anybody was hearing it they'll
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.560]  probably take what I just said earlier and say this was secret he didn't know
[1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:54.000]  it was on the air you know because they they can't have me criticize Israel
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:57.520]  because that messes up their false paradigm because they're handled by
[1:04:57.520 --> 1:05:03.760]  federal agents this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:07.880]  buying a solar power generator this summer number one new climate legislation

[1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:23.880]  Alex Jones
[1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:30.400]  they're saying the last of the great shoe leather detective journalist is dead
[1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:37.840]  Robert Novak died 78 of brain cancer of course they admitted infected over 200
[1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:42.600]  million Americans with the SV-40 and the polio shot alone most of us out there
[1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:47.320]  will die of what was put in our vaccines good bet that killed him but dead of a

[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:31.960]  olds with lobotomies and they now talk to you very slow health care plan save
[1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:38.480]  you money jaren because they're targeting the fluoride heads you were just
[1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:42.800]  commenting on it we just turned up the volume on CNN in there they had a what
[1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:45.960]  what piqued my interest they actually had something said why do people hate
[1:09:45.960 --> 1:09:50.600]  health care and then right below it 20% lower premiums question mark and then
[1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:55.080]  they they actually had little potato head type drawings like cartoons on the
[1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:59.600]  touchscreen and it said well this help John will health care help John and she
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:03.440]  just draws an arrow to his pocket and says yeah yeah it'll help John it'll
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:07.160]  help his pocketbook and his back will feel better literally like it's for five
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:11.560]  year olds and I'm smarter than a five-year-old so I saw through it well
[1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:15.360]  that's the incredible part is what they're putting in the water what they're
[1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:19.640]  putting in the food I go to public events on the slitter bond this weekend and I
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:22.520]  was watching people while you're stuck in line for 20 minutes to ride a water
[1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:28.800]  slab with your kids they can hardly talk now they're like and and it didn't
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:35.040]  matter and I talked to folks from Europe that come here and if they're from say
[1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:39.400]  Ireland a couple say hey on the side of the street hey I hear your voice do you
[1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:43.640]  play golf thinking Ireland to Scotland and then and then are you from a
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:46.520]  different state in the US where they talk like that and the person's like
[1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:51.160]  excuse me you know I'm from England or I'm from Germany and they'll say you
[1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:56.600]  mean like a German resort or you mean like average people don't know there's
[1:10:56.600 --> 1:11:00.320]  other countries now that I'm not kidding Sharon I think it's worse than we
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:03.960]  thought it's either you've got to wake people that somehow genetically or
[1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:06.880]  whatever aren't as affected by the chemicals in the water in the food but
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:10.160]  we're somewhat still brain damage it's clear we all kind of look poisoned or
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:13.360]  half retarded but then you've got the rest of public that are just literally
[1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:17.240]  succumbing or is it some kind of mind-trans through the TV because I'm
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:22.240]  watching television now and a lot of it is like like I'm in kindergarten again
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:28.320]  it's like does Billy like the free health care no he don't he bad man and I'm not
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:32.960]  trying to be mean I mean folks they're they've like a retardation beam or
[1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:36.800]  something they're using on people it's pretty insulting I noticed a few if you
[1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:42.280]  want to argue somebody over the merits of health care if you watch the news so
[1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:45.480]  like watch CNN in the morning and you're having a debate with somebody at
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:49.520]  night you can tell what they're gonna say next you it's just bullet point
[1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:54.640]  bullet point nobody has a creative thought it's just they're just running
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:58.520]  down the list of what what they just saw in the news and it's just well I'm gonna
[1:11:58.520 --> 1:12:01.800]  go back to calls I'm gonna go back to calls Jeremy remember the Wall Street
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:05.640]  Journal lady that was here for a day yeah and she begged to come and said I
[1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:09.640]  promise it's not a hit piece I promise we're gonna do the piece and I told her
[1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:13.960]  very nice lady Sarah McBride ever email right here and she'd been writing form
[1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:18.240]  for almost a decade one of their big writers I said Sarah if you don't write
[1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:21.360]  a hit piece it will not be published and she said I've never had a piece turned
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:25.720]  down no that's not gonna happen and and she read me big parts of the piece over
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:32.080]  the phone it isn't a hit piece but it was definitely 55% on their side 45%
[1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:35.400]  mine I mean it had people attacking me and professors she interviewed it was
[1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:40.160]  like a 1300 word huge gonna be front page you know with my face on the Wall
[1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:46.200]  Street Journal and they they overrode the head editor and someone from corporate
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:51.160]  told them no we're not promoting Alex Jones so and I told and she says in the
[1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:54.800]  email is she also called Rob do yesterday wants me to call her Alex I
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:57.720]  don't know how you cuz she laughed at me she said they've never hundreds of
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:01.080]  articles I've written never killed a story and I said well get ready but I
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:05.600]  said just for your education you can come here and waste my time and I told the
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:09.000]  psychology today guy that that's certainly a hit piece too but they're
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  they're digging around for dirt's they haven't published it yet and in fact
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.280]  let's call Rob do and her talk about this hey Jaren thanks for coming in
[1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:19.120]  Rob Rob come on in here and talk about it you were there when I kept telling her
[1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:22.240]  over the phone and then I told her no I'm not doing it and then she begged and
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:27.880]  I mean look I was there when a huge director who made some kind of monster
[1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:33.880]  brother's keeper paradise lost all these top you know films as big as Michael
[1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:39.800]  Moore's films and he made a 3.4 million dollar TV series with me in it I
[1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:44.160]  wasted all this time and then he wouldn't turn it into a hit piece and they
[1:13:44.160 --> 1:13:47.640]  just said fine your contract says you got final cut our contract says we can
[1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:52.640]  shelve it and shelve for over a year but you talked to her yesterday I tell
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:57.400]  folks what she said yeah she called up and said well Rob this is she's gave
[1:13:57.400 --> 1:14:01.360]  her name I'll just tell her first name it's Sarah and Sarah McBrother's
[1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:06.360]  secret yeah why are we well I mean I know no you're right and anyway she said
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:12.080]  I will have some bad news one of the executives who I guess read the article
[1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:17.080]  said they didn't want to give as much space to somebody like Alex Jones and
[1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:20.800]  then he went on vacation so she'll the article and went on vacation for two
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:26.200]  weeks and and she said you know it's exactly like Alex said you know she
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:29.000]  said it's exactly like he predicted so I guess when you were talking with her
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:32.040]  you predicted that they weren't going to run the article if she was doing
[1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:35.200]  something truthful yeah man it was a hit piece but it didn't say that I'd
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:41.400]  murdered children or it didn't say that I you know I'm a drug trafficker right
[1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:48.040]  or some other lie and so it's it's dead but but that's but I want the
[1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:51.480]  executives the Wall Street Journal to know I could care less this is why we
[1:14:51.480 --> 1:14:55.720]  turned down most interviews she just kept begging and called Ted Anderson and I
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:58.640]  said Ted I'll do this because you're asking me to but I said it's not gonna
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:02.000]  run and I said next time leave me alone about it yeah because I get these
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:05.520]  calls every day from Genesis hey this newspaper wants to talk to you this
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:09.760]  magazine wants to talk to you and and just know I don't want to hear it I'm
[1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:14.560]  not doing interviews for no reason anymore okay I've done it over and over
[1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:18.680]  and over and over again and the only way it goes in the newspaper is if it's a
[1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:22.360]  lying hit piece okay and she wrote a piece that you know wasn't flattering
[1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:26.000]  towards me at all but they know it's just gonna send people to me to find out
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:29.840]  who the real Alex is she hit pieces actually help us when somebody says
[1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:33.680]  I'm a murderer or somebody says I'm a drug dealer or somebody says I'm a
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:38.320]  killer or somebody says that I work for the Israelis or the Vatican or the or
[1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:43.560]  the Russians I mean or the al-Qaeda training camps that's another one it if
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:46.200]  I ever really get attacked on something real which there's really no
[1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:49.880]  skeletons so there's nothing to attack me on all it is work all day now my
[1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:52.960]  family man very you know clean-cut the whole night don't even drink or smoke
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:58.480]  anymore if if if if if I ever did do something bad no one's gonna believe it
[1:15:58.480 --> 1:16:02.120]  because they've been acclimated with total crap all day but the issue here is
[1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:05.960]  all these attack pieces actually help me and these more sophisticated guaranteed
[1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:10.240]  spooks high up in Wall Street Journal they know they know that's only gonna
[1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:14.480]  help me so see but understand you didn't have some victory over me doing this
[1:16:14.480 --> 1:16:18.200]  you're the fools you executives the Wall Street Journal do you get told not to
[1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:21.320]  give your kids vaccines no do you get told to not drink the tap water with
[1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:24.240]  hundreds of different chemicals in it we've got a tour of the water system here
[1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:28.680]  in Austin that the name fluoride is over a hundred depending on which brand it
[1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:34.400]  could be over 300 you know it it it it varies fluorosilic acid is what the
[1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:37.680]  catch-off raises yeah and that's what the city of Austin told you yeah they
[1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:40.520]  said straight up as we get it from Florida and it comes right out of these
[1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:46.080]  plants but it's cleaned and processed but then you saw how was holes eaten in
[1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:49.640]  the concrete where a few drops of drip it's horrible I can't believe we put
[1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:54.600]  this in our water and I mean honestly if I didn't have to earn a living that's
[1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:58.480]  all I would be fighting this tooth and nail I mean exactly but I mean my only
[1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:05.480]  point is the vaccines are killing people the water and the GMO
[1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:09.440]  pharmacological they're designing it they can go in and and and design the
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:13.440]  corn design the wheat to sterilize you to give you cancer they admit it they
[1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:18.600]  brag that's what matters not getting caught up in the personality of Alex
[1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:24.000]  Jones they hate me because I put out issues and again it doesn't hurt me at
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:27.880]  the Wall Street Journal that they did that I did this to educate your reporter
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:33.240]  and now she knows it's all real it's not funny anymore so I decided since she
[1:17:33.240 --> 1:17:37.160]  begged and pleaded to let her come and let her see for herself yeah and you're
[1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:40.760]  nice to he gave her plenty of time also did it so Ted is a nice guy well you
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:43.600]  know he was like come on Alex it's the Wall Street Journal because you kept
[1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:48.240]  calling him and I said okay last time Ted yeah originally you said no we talked

[1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:05.560]  they say eating healthy is a mental disorder and if you believe in a corporate

[1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:06.240]  air welcome hi Alex I hope you give me more than a minute on this I have a
[1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:12.880]  hearing in Dover Delaware we had a it was like round zero for the experimental
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:19.320]  anthrax vaccine do you remember that it was pilot sick okay well I pulled up a
[1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:25.880]  news journal article if anyone wants to Google this it's x da fb for Dover Air
[1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:31.200]  Force base commander says troops used as guinea pigs interestingly enough this
[1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:36.040]  carnal who stood up for his troops there lives in Texas maybe you can get him on
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:42.360]  your program his name is carnal Felix rider greeter you know why you know why
[1:25:42.360 --> 1:25:46.320]  you said no they started given the first rounds and people were collapsing and
[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:51.440]  having autoimmune diseases and people died you can just search engine the term
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:57.240]  local vet dies after anthrax shot or local vet paralyzed and it killed tens of
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:26:02.160]  thousands of them can I read you something really quick I think it's very
[1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:06.080]  important sure because you know it had the squalene in it which is the same
[1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:09.480]  thing that's going to be in the swine flu vaccine which makes the body again
[1:26:09.480 --> 1:26:12.640]  squalene doesn't hurt you if you eat a little bit of it it's the fact when it's
[1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:17.640]  in the bloodstream with injected with the pathogen it causes a giant auto
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:24.480]  immune response and every organ in the brain swells okay here's this was an
[1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:29.200]  out-of-the-new investigative reporter of the first 50 batches of vaccine
[1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:33.920]  distributed worldwide for the mandatory inoculations only five contained
[1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:39.080]  squalene and those were all shipped to Dover after denying for more than a year
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:42.680]  that there was squalene in the vaccinations given at Dover the Air Force
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:47.200]  admitted in 2000 that it had been wrong now here's the next piece of the puzzle
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:52.600]  the five batches of vaccine sent to Dover contained increasing concentrations of
[1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:57.400]  squalene food and drug administration test show some top scientists say the
[1:26:57.400 --> 1:27:01.640]  pattern of squaling concentration could indicate that the military was measuring
[1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:06.440]  the troops response to different dosages well of course they were professor who
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:12.160]  said yeah you know this is this is not just coincidence now when you join the
[1:27:12.160 --> 1:27:17.240]  military you join to be used and abused it has nothing to do with America the
[1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:21.680]  military is owned and run by the globalist and we won't get our country
[1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:25.160]  back till the military admits to themselves this government isn't our
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:29.680]  government just like under Hitler he got control of the German military it was
[1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:34.640]  then illegitimate and they just they don't care they just want illegal aliens
[1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:39.960]  and criminals for the military now Alex I had bought that anthrax war moving

[1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:30.480]  Rhode Island Charles you're on the air go ahead
[1:33:30.480 --> 1:33:36.600]  could you do the salutations freedom fighter extra than that what's on your
[1:33:36.600 --> 1:33:41.760]  mind buddy well I want to tell you an idea but I'm gonna I'm gonna just do a
[1:33:41.760 --> 1:33:46.320]  little plug here for 12 160 Ning where the core group that left your info was
[1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:51.680]  social and we ended up overtening there so that's that's what happened to your
[1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:56.400]  info was social I don't know what you're talking about but go ahead remember you
[1:33:56.400 --> 1:34:01.800]  have the info or social a couple years ago oh yeah and my IT guys couldn't make
[1:34:01.800 --> 1:34:06.880]  it work it got too big what happened is people would go launch their own scripts
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:12.040]  within it and it wasn't a hack on purpose but it just wasn't designed to
[1:34:12.040 --> 1:34:16.840]  have 10,000 20,000 whenever the members were and so it was screwing it up you
[1:34:16.840 --> 1:34:21.880]  know yes I know about the info or social go ahead okay so anyways here's an idea
[1:34:21.880 --> 1:34:26.280]  basically that you've probably never heard before and this is something that
[1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:29.520]  we could attack the government with I came up with this idea 12 years ago
[1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:34.520]  I'm a basically a progressive thinker and I want you all to know everybody out
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:38.560]  there in radio land that a good idea has many mothers and many fathers and
[1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:44.120]  basically the idea is we own the government don't we ask the people yes
[1:34:44.120 --> 1:34:48.360]  but a foreign private corporate consortium has come in and hijacked it
[1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:54.480]  through the mechanism of continuity of government okay but since we really
[1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:58.800]  basically own the government regardless of who owns it okay and and we're all
[1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:03.640]  well aware that the fact is that we can demand government does something okay
[1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:08.640]  and here's the basic idea of what we want the government to do all right we
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:11.520]  want the local and the state government to stay at the level they are right now
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:15.960]  it doesn't matter about them but the federal government we want it to revert
[1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:21.000]  reset itself back to the 1789 US Constitution and the First Amendment
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:25.920]  get rid of all the alphabet soup agencies get rid of all the congressmen
[1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:31.720]  and the president let the military all come back control all the federal
[1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:36.920]  government situations the customs the border patrol the basic prisons and
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:41.440]  everything and and I would like to live I would like to live forever and I'd
[1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:45.440]  like to float around on fluffy clouds and everything would be great I mean
[1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:49.680]  that's what we're pushing for is getting our republic back and that's why
[1:35:49.680 --> 1:35:52.880]  they're using Homeland Security and the rest of it to suppress the people that's
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:56.640]  what it was designed for that's why the fed stage the terror attack against
[1:35:56.640 --> 1:36:01.480]  themselves as a pretext to crack down on the people but what is your specific
[1:36:01.480 --> 1:36:04.680]  point sir I gotta move quick here quickly with there's all these television
[1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:09.400]  shows and movies and our books all about how somebody went through all these
[1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:12.960]  crises and then at the end of the book or the movie or whatever they woke up
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:16.640]  from a dream and it didn't happen and this is the way we should know you would
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:21.120]  reset a collar if you had a gate and you were counting people came in to a
[1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:24.280]  certain place that was a million people you want to reset it back to zero again
[1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:29.760]  you reset it but this would be with the experiment of America didn't work and if
[1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:34.360]  we reset it back to the 1789 US Constitution we focused on that one
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:39.120]  issue all together that we want our government to be reset back to the 1789
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:42.440]  US Constitutional local to the state government they can say at their place
[1:36:42.440 --> 1:36:47.440]  the government has to reset back to zero again okay Charles I hear you I hear you
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:51.920]  I think that's what we're all working towards so yes the problem is the
[1:36:51.920 --> 1:36:57.880]  criminals that live off of us the that run the local governments they are
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:37:01.880]  teamed up with foreign corporations we're going to have to remove them from
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:05.960]  power first and they're going to use paramilitary forces against us they are
[1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:10.280]  criminals they are bank robbers Darrell in Texas you're on the air Darrell go
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:15.520]  ahead Alex I wanted to ask you a question I've been meaning to ask you a
[1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:21.760]  question about gun permits and that is simple I'll just put it out there and
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:25.840]  then I'll hang up once you talk when you apply for any type of a gun permit are
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:31.160]  you de-chacting from your right in any way I've heard you talk before about
[1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:34.440]  common law and the fact that you all you need is a second amendment and you don't
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:40.160]  need a permit what types of things are you stepping into when you get a permit
[1:37:40.160 --> 1:37:43.200]  and you apply for one are you limiting yourself could you give me your take on
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:48.360]  that sure thanks for the call look it's a very simple issue but also very
[1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:57.600]  complex like most things that appear simple what I was saying is that under
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:38:06.320]  the common law the only type of firearm that's illegal is a concealed
[1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:13.280]  firearm because that's what criminals and thieves and people that is the way
[1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:22.320]  historically they would conceal arms free men could carry a musket or a long
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:31.000]  rifle a hatchet a dagger a sword whatever they wanted but if you concealed
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:36.240]  it that was a serious criminal charge the whole point was everyone was armed
[1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:42.280]  out in the open was a very polite and free society so the federal government
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:45.960]  the state governments don't have any jurisdiction to make you get a permit to
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:51.480]  carry a firearm unless they say we'll give you a permit to carry a concealed a
[1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:58.680]  permit is a right or authorization or letter of mark from the governing system
[1:38:58.680 --> 1:39:04.720]  to do something that would normally be illegal prohibited by law so they can
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:09.800]  they can't give you a permit to carry a shotgun or a rifle or a handgun openly
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:15.640]  because it's not against the law so they but but but through brainwashing and
[1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:22.640]  conditioning they trained the public that you're not allowed to have a rifle in
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:29.560]  your car and I'm allowed to have a handgun I have two clips I have an AP
[1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:33.320]  clip and I have another clip of him on YouTube right where the idiot lady comes
[1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:38.000]  over after the music guys telling my crew and starts telling him hey put your
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:44.120]  gun down that scares my kids out in a Phoenix yesterday and when he gets
[1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:49.360]  talked to he explains to people if I don't have this gun openly this this AR
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:56.760]  15 strapped around my shoulder then I will lose the right I have to exercise
[1:39:56.760 --> 1:40:00.920]  this or like muscles at atrophies and there you you see the federal marshals
[1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:04.840]  standing 10 feet away they're watching him they don't look too concerned Lord
[1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:09.160]  Obama the little pup at the front man
[1:40:12.480 --> 1:40:19.040]  now it's it's up on info wars.com it's a top story there's there's there's one
[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:27.080]  that's AP and there's a YouTube from we are changed San Antonio is the YouTube
[1:40:27.080 --> 1:40:31.640]  search you do yeah there's the AP you know I said I wasn't getting to the
[1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:38.880]  revolution that's happening and I said I was gonna get into all the vaccines and
[1:40:38.880 --> 1:40:41.720]  the rest of it maybe I should just do that and I got Dr. Blalock coming up
[1:40:41.720 --> 1:40:50.960]  about what these vaccines have been proven to actually do to people but it
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:41:01.200]  is it is fundamental it is criminal it is done with malice of forethought
[1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:09.960]  consciously when they put up billboards everywhere and say report illegal guns
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:13.760]  with an image of a rifle or a handgun that's meant to create the image that
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:16.920]  guns are illegal because the government is criminal and does want your guns
[1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:22.560]  because slaves are disarmed while the government arms to the teeth against the
[1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:28.080]  people illegitimately they want our guns and so these people from Arizona to New
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:33.680]  Hampshire from Texas to Vermont from Oregon to Florida are going to public
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:39.640]  demonstrations with guns openly now people done that in Colorado and been
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:43.960]  arrested and falsely charged and sent to prison for what's legal that's how
[1:41:43.960 --> 1:41:49.240]  stupid the juries are but these pieces on AP and CNN and the rest of it where
[1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:53.560]  they're having to admit it's legal and lawful that's the CNN headline man
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:42:07.720]  carries assault rivaled Obama protest and it's legal so this is all part of the
[1:42:07.720 --> 1:42:12.600]  revolution it's about us standing up and saying we are not your slaves we are
[1:42:12.600 --> 1:42:26.240]  not your property we are not going along with any of this we are not going to
[1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:37.640]  comply with this we are not going to go along with this let's go and play the
[1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:42.800]  AP clip I may not have sent you guys the we are change Phoenix or we are change
[1:42:42.800 --> 1:42:45.880]  Arizona but it'll be on YouTube I know it's up on in Full Wars in prison plan
[1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:49.960]  I know I watched it there this morning maybe it's on prison planet but say
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:55.680]  lobby whatever here's the audio from the AP one but the other one is is even
[1:42:55.680 --> 1:43:01.360]  better the the actual we are change one because this idiot woman runs over and
[1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:10.400]  gets in his face and he explains to her she says I'm I'm upset by that I'm I'm
[1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:14.360]  threatened by that and he says well usually people would be threatened by
[1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:22.000]  my black skin lady you know get used to it I'm not your slave I mean they're so
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:26.840]  scared seeing a fellow slave a fellow American arm but they love seeing the
[1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:32.040]  government aren't you know in a lot of free country places like Switzerland at
[1:43:32.040 --> 1:43:34.880]  least in the past the cops didn't carry guns but all the citizens did because
[1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:38.480]  they didn't trust the government with guns that's what a real free society is
[1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:43.160]  lying but now they've got it backwards see I'm not here to pull a plow for you
[1:43:43.160 --> 1:43:48.080]  government I know you think I am but you're about to learn let's go ahead and
[1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:54.480]  play the clip here it is just sizing my rights as an American in Arizona
[1:43:54.480 --> 1:44:00.000]  I'm absolutely totally against health and health care in this in this way in
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  this manner stealing it from people I don't think that's appropriate
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:11.960]  well I come from another state where open carry is legal but no one does it so
[1:44:11.960 --> 1:44:16.200]  the police don't really know about it and they they harass people arrest people
[1:44:16.200 --> 1:44:20.040]  falsely and I think that people need to get out and do it more so that they get
[1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:25.760]  kind of conditioned to it you're here specifically for open carry for open
[1:44:25.760 --> 1:44:30.280]  carry and I also to remind people that a lot of people think you live in a
[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:35.160]  democracy so that we can just we can vote how the minority is gonna live and
[1:44:35.160 --> 1:44:38.600]  if we want health care as long as we get enough people will just take money
[1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:42.520]  from you and we'll buy whatever we want pay for whatever we want and I just
[1:44:42.520 --> 1:44:46.640]  think that it's in America people have the ability to fight back and to resist
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:51.920]  and that's you know that's another reason why I'm here
[1:44:51.920 --> 1:44:57.480]  all right so there you have it and then later text Mars only with us for 30
[1:44:57.480 --> 1:45:00.680]  minutes I'll play the we are change one when we're actually live at prison
[1:45:00.680 --> 1:45:06.200]  planet dot TV we are change Phoenix I bet it's up on freedoms Phoenix dot com
[1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:14.480]  that's their local site there okay I know we have loaded phone lines here and
[1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:26.480]  I tried to answer that callers question as best I could it does not in the
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:31.120]  contract you sign wave your rights when you get a concealed carry but it creates
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:36.240]  the common law perception of custom that you've got to get a permit to own a gun
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:40.320]  and that's how the domestication started 60 plus years ago in Chicago and New
[1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:45.080]  York City anywhere mafia run the mob has a way of disarming their slaves this is
[1:45:45.080 --> 1:45:49.400]  a domestication process yeah let's go ahead and actually found the clip let's
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:56.760]  play this moron woman coming over to him and self-righteously getting in his
[1:45:56.760 --> 1:46:03.120]  face the same black guy and well he did it just right he's not wearing a mask or
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:07.920]  you know something that would discredit everything he's clean cut in a in a
[1:46:07.920 --> 1:46:14.080]  dress shirt and black tie he's sharp he's well-spoken he's got a wicked you
[1:46:14.080 --> 1:46:22.360]  know you know nice compact ar-15 slung over his back it's just absolutely the
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:26.320]  image we want to project because if it had been a white guy all that I say you
[1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:31.600]  wanted a he was racist or whatever so this is this is a perfect image compared
[1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:36.040]  to the image that was somewhat twisted from pale horse not that pale horse is
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:39.440]  bad I think pale horse is legitimate after talking to him we appreciate him
[1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:43.320]  coming on the show but certainly played in the media's hands this is not playing
[1:46:43.320 --> 1:46:46.960]  into the media's hands they don't like it here it is
[1:46:46.960 --> 1:46:50.080]  bring an automatic weapon
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:54.080]  okay the AK-47 is an AR-15 and it's semi-automatic
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:46:58.280]  okay well semi-automatic I mean why did you feel like you were you know it had to
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:47:03.600]  defend yourself at a protest I mean what was the point of the gun you have to defend yourself everywhere bad things happen everywhere
[1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:06.960]  don't you think that the more guns people have the more incidents of gun violence
[1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:12.640]  there's going to be I mean don't you think it's local counter statistics I've seen
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:18.480]  seem to reflect the exact opposite of Washington DC has more violence than any other state
[1:47:18.480 --> 1:47:21.600]  I feel like the most violent places in the country are places that have the
[1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:27.800]  strictest gun laws DC Washington DC Washington DC is an incredibly
[1:47:27.800 --> 1:47:35.160]  violent country DC is a very violent place you're right and they're the worst
[1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:43.040]  just look at these morons going DC doesn't allow guns and it's the
[1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:47.680]  absolute pit of hell the worst place in the world in the industrialized world
[1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:54.360]  just absolutely hellish level of crime I mean just just these domesticated
[1:47:54.360 --> 1:48:00.960]  morons want their kids to grow up in a society where they're total slaves what
[1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:05.640]  is your problem lady why is a citizen having a gun so scary but you love the
[1:48:05.640 --> 1:48:11.160]  cameras and checkpoints and paramilitary police you're a jackass lady let's play
[1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:28.920]  her again
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:32.160]  well there's a lot of things that make people nervous at one point at one time
[1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:35.160]  at one point in time my skin made a lot of people nervous if I was walking if I
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:39.960]  was around their children but as long as I'm not but as long as I'm not attacking
[1:48:39.960 --> 1:48:45.200]  them if I'm not doing anything threatening towards them if someone was
[1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:49.080]  attacking you or me or anybody that I care about any my fellow citizens I'd
[1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:52.080]  absolutely use it I think they could handle the job I think the police can
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:56.080]  handle it but how can you have free people freely like protecting themselves
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:48:59.760]  with weapons they're going there's gonna be problem there's gonna they're gonna
[1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:04.440]  get stolen things are going to happen you can't you can't have you know like if
[1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:07.320]  you have the freedom to drive that means there's gonna be accidents from time to
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:10.600]  time there's no there's no you can't have it you can't have freedom to drive
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:19.680]  and no accidents at the same time that's impossible that is the key if things are
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:24.000]  stagnant and safe it's entropy and the whole thing rots and dies if things are
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:29.640]  real and strong and serious and men or men and women or women and cars were cars
[1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:33.920]  as the saying goes people were polite because if you were rude the wrong
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:37.240]  person people were real friendly because you be rude to somebody they'll punch you
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:42.120]  in the nose and you didn't rob people's houses because they kill you before they
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:45.680]  put sterilants in the water to our testicles shrivel up and that's happened
[1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:49.560]  to everybody I mean folks they're chemical weapon they're turning this into a
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:54.240]  bunch of a bunch of ninnies about not only attack women they're not turning us
[1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:59.440]  into women they're turning us into these gilded domesticated jellyfish there's a
[1:49:59.440 --> 1:50:03.120]  reason men are running around and look like women now because they're putting
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:08.280]  it in the water that's been documented this is real and you've got these
[1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:13.280]  domesticated sloths that are scared of somebody that isn't a slave and that's
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:19.000]  what freedom is about driving cars and firearms and life it's about freedom you
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:22.320]  domesticated chicken neck and by the way when you give up your rights for
[1:50:22.320 --> 1:50:26.000]  supposed protection as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin both said you get
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:30.720]  neither you get tyranny the greatest danger is letting the nanny state see the
[1:50:30.720 --> 1:50:34.560]  nanny states really cold-blooded and evil but it speaks to the cowardly weak
[1:50:34.560 --> 1:50:39.560]  chicken necks and gets them to join forces with the state to come galed real
[1:50:39.560 --> 1:50:44.160]  men and real women they hate us they hate it we're free they hate it we're
[1:50:44.160 --> 1:50:48.360]  strong they hate it we can have all the kids we want they hate it we got houses
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:52.320]  and swimming pools that can live good the control freak you Genesis want to get
[1:50:52.320 --> 1:50:57.520]  rid of all that they love death they love weakness they love rottenness nothing

[1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:09.840]  Don't worry this show is documented Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:54:15.840 --> 1:54:19.840]  This happens from time to time that's fine because I got a bunch of video and
[1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:23.840]  audio clips I want to play we're supposed to have Dr. Blalock the brain
[1:54:23.840 --> 1:54:28.440]  surgeon on about the flu shots in this hour we got the time zone
[1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:33.480]  scrambled our fault not his so he'll either be on the last 30 minutes today
[1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:37.040]  or later in the week I won't play a lot for a full hour regardless later because
[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:42.960]  I want to get into these flu shots from a brain surgeon from a neurologist from
[1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:47.560]  an expert okay he'll tell you what's in them he'll tell you what it's doing but
[1:54:47.560 --> 1:54:54.160]  that is not my opinion it is now mainstream news the flu shots killing
[1:54:54.160 --> 1:54:59.040]  people and hey that's fortuitous that Blalock may not be on the day because I
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:02.600]  need to get in to the mainstream news of what these flu shots are doing to
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:08.280]  people and have a discussion about this because just like citizens are scared of
[1:55:08.280 --> 1:55:12.480]  other citizens with guns when there's no reason to be scared and people are
[1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:15.720]  scared of sharks in the ocean eating them when there's one chance out of a
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:19.880]  billion you're gonna get eaten people are scared of things they shouldn't be
[1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:24.440]  scared of and they're scared of things people are scared of things they
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:27.680]  shouldn't be scared of and they're not scared of things they should be scared
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:33.160]  of because the media tells people what to be scared of in fact we ought to
[1:55:33.160 --> 1:55:36.960]  create a poster that's a great white shark rising up out of the water with
[1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:42.320]  scary eyes and teeth and under it say don't drink the tap water that'd be an
[1:55:42.320 --> 1:55:47.120]  awesome t-shirt because it gives you the archetypal monster and it's coming out
[1:55:47.120 --> 1:55:51.320]  of the water so there's that tie-in at a subconscious level and then it says
[1:55:51.320 --> 1:55:57.800]  don't drink the water don't drink the tap water is that not a good idea and then
[1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:02.080]  people probably wouldn't because at their mind number level they'd go there
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:06.960]  be shark in water me no drinking because they'll think a sharks gonna come out of
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:11.920]  the tap into their glass they'll start getting scared of the tap water area in
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:16.680]  their house and they're like two-year-olds you tell them big shark you come out of
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:21.880]  the tap he may not drink he mean that's what they think of this Patriot this evil
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:30.880]  it have gone yet yet bad they don't take gunny then I mean this is how crazy the
[1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:38.640]  brainwashing is and how out of control it's all gotten okay ladies and gentlemen

[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:56.880]  headline is witchcraft in the White House we're going over this because the
[2:00:56.880 --> 2:01:00.400]  establishment is on a witch hunt against Christians they admit all over the
[2:01:00.400 --> 2:01:05.160]  country they CPS homeschoolers Christian families children the neighbors are on a
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:09.800]  witch hunt I'm not on a witch hunt against the real witches I just want to

[2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:25.920]  spirit every morning he believes and flops around on the ground that's
[2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:30.440]  mainstream British news he admits it he he is so overtaken with the spirit of
[2:01:30.440 --> 2:01:37.160]  the light as he calls it be a Lucifer the lightbearer that can't make this
[2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:40.640]  stuff up we're gonna show you some of those articles later and then meanwhile
[2:01:40.640 --> 2:01:46.200]  you got Obama's wife's mommy doing the Santoria the chickens you know run them

[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:14.240]  segments now getting into the fact that we are going into revolution the signs
[2:02:14.240 --> 2:02:18.240]  the evidence is now overwhelming and even blowing me away how fast how real how
[2:02:18.240 --> 2:02:24.680]  huge it is but that also confirms to me that the the establishment is gonna
[2:02:24.680 --> 2:02:30.080]  counter strike and it's gonna try to stage some crises and then we'll take
[2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:34.080]  your phone calls Dave Brad many others holding the toll-free number to join us

[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:53.400]  I wanted to go over all the articles we have and this is without looking this is
[2:02:53.400 --> 2:02:57.360]  just like I said on the Sunday show in the last few days hundreds and hundreds
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:03.280]  of articles are out there and and and we've printed 20 30 I didn't count big
[2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:09.440]  stacks of these AP AFP German newspapers British newspapers London
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:16.840]  Telegraph Sunday Mail Financial Times of London Moscow Times Tokyo newspapers
[2:03:16.840 --> 2:03:24.600]  about how the flu shot is killing people the flu shot trials in the United
[2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:29.360]  States mainly in Texas are killing people and the federal government is
[2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:33.000]  saying keep this secret don't let the public know about it now there's so many
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:36.800]  different angles to that not just that it's killing people but that they would
[2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:40.240]  keep it quiet and that every other time they do this it kills a bunch of people
[2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:44.960]  and that they're clearly testing a soft kill operation saying we'll be bold
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:49.000]  we'll just give people shots out in the open that kill them and maim them and
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:53.560]  hurt them I mean they've already brain damaged millions of children always at
[2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:56.440]  18 months the child gets the third round of shots they're running around
[2:03:56.440 --> 2:04:01.960]  giggling talking laughing then they sit in the corner I'm sad it's very sad
[2:04:01.960 --> 2:04:05.520]  for the rest of their life just whoo whoo from the brain damage because the
[2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:08.880]  brain swells with the adjuvants and other things that are in it not just the
[2:04:08.880 --> 2:04:14.880]  mercury and that's your chemical lobotomy now most people are only meant to
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:18.080]  be brain damaged by this so that you're not a you know you know so you're kind
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:22.480]  of a drone it's kind of like the movie black hole where there are lobotomizing

[2:23:58.440 --> 2:24:12.640]  two text Mars is coming up the next hour dr. Russell Blalock is with us now for
[2:24:12.640 --> 2:24:16.320]  the next 35 minutes or so we'll get him back up the next few weeks for a full
[2:24:16.320 --> 2:24:21.640]  hour or two to take phone calls he is a board certified neurosurgeon author and
[2:24:21.640 --> 2:24:25.960]  lecturer attended LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans and completed his
[2:24:25.960 --> 2:24:29.480]  general surgery internship in neurosurgical residency the Medical
[2:24:29.480 --> 2:24:33.880]  University of South Carolina at Charleston South Carolina and he ran
[2:24:33.880 --> 2:24:39.520]  the neurosurgery program there he is the inventor of some of the most famous
[2:24:39.520 --> 2:24:45.200]  modern forms of brain surgery it's a very long bio he's a top brain surgeon
[2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:50.200]  and neurologist so not just in brain surgery but also overall brain science
[2:24:50.200 --> 2:24:55.360]  he's with us for the next 35 minutes dr. you got on the line before he went to
[2:24:55.360 --> 2:24:59.720]  break and you were laughing during the break saying yeah that's right don't
[2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:05.160]  don't filter your water and don't eat organic food they're now not just in the
[2:25:05.160 --> 2:25:10.760]  one in guardian but all over us television saying it's mentally ill to
[2:25:10.760 --> 2:25:15.240]  not want to take your vaccines to want to eat clean food to want to filter your
[2:25:15.240 --> 2:25:21.280]  water I mean this is really getting crazy doctor well if that's what people
[2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:27.040]  are you know avoiding these talks if the science on the toxicity of
[2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:34.240]  fluoridation of water just extents even the national Academy of Sciences
[2:25:34.240 --> 2:25:39.240]  completed a huge study which confirmed everything we've been saying in the
[2:25:39.240 --> 2:25:44.120]  research literature about toxicity of fluoride and I wrote a paper along with
[2:25:44.120 --> 2:25:50.200]  Chuckle-Babashi and scientists which is a comprehensive review of the toxic
[2:25:50.200 --> 2:25:56.040]  fluoride that collects all the research known on it so this you know it's the
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:26:00.520]  research is so extensive it's ridiculous that we're still adding
[2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:05.680]  dried water plus the fact that they admit that it has nothing to do with
[2:26:05.680 --> 2:26:11.080]  reducing cavity even the American dental association had to admit that drinking
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:15.360]  fluoride and water does not reduce cavity one bit but they're still doing it
[2:26:15.360 --> 2:26:20.480]  well you have to ask why are you doing it then but that leaves it open to a lot
[2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:25.080]  of turpid while they do it same thing we're getting food what they did is
[2:26:25.080 --> 2:26:31.480]  test the the protein contented and a few other contents of food in
[2:26:31.480 --> 2:26:35.160]  comparative it said whether they're real different what they didn't test the
[2:26:35.160 --> 2:26:39.680]  most important part of the plant that's the flavonoid there's a significant
[2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:44.000]  difference in the two and in the difference of toxins in the food so they
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:48.480]  didn't test the ring structures the trace minerals the cofactors they didn't
[2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:55.400]  test the GMO alterations that are in the GMO all of the left out and of course
[2:26:55.400 --> 2:27:00.720]  this is a way modern political lies by and dot if you work for government or
[2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:05.800]  you work for it that are promoting a program they just manipulated by and
[2:27:05.800 --> 2:27:10.520]  released it to the press the press regurgitated and then all the true
[2:27:10.520 --> 2:27:14.800]  scientists out there saying it's a bunch of baloney they never get interviewed
[2:27:14.800 --> 2:27:20.840]  their material never appear in the public eye that's just the way they do
[2:27:20.840 --> 2:27:25.560]  things same thing with the vaccine what we know about vaccines so frightening
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:31.400]  it's public to it I don't think anyone with their child to be injected well
[2:27:31.400 --> 2:27:35.160]  yes sir this is a short segment I want to come back in the next and just sit back
[2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:40.800]  and have you go over they keep accidentally in quotes putting live polio
[2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:45.040]  in the shots that are killing people all over the world they keep in quotes
[2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:50.880]  accidentally they say oh yeah the 76 and now this new flu as you know a vaccine
[2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:56.280]  is killing people with degenerative nerve diseases and there's a whole family
[2:27:56.280 --> 2:28:01.320]  of those which for the listeners so you can speak on that but just briefly I'm
[2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:05.520]  not on some elite high horse I don't think of myself dr. blalock as a brain
[2:28:05.520 --> 2:28:09.880]  surgeon like yourself blalock report dot com you know the old pun he's as
[2:28:09.880 --> 2:28:15.480]  smart as a brain surgeon I just have a good memory and talking to the public
[2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:21.240]  people around me I went to a water park this weekend the public looks like they've
[2:28:21.240 --> 2:28:26.240]  been poisoned kind of look at cows and say those cows don't look healthy they
[2:28:26.240 --> 2:28:32.880]  they look drugged out they look they act really retarded and more and is it
[2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:38.600]  watching the TV and we know the studies show that a lot of TV watching can even
[2:28:38.600 --> 2:28:42.480]  lower the brainwaves over time a retired people's development kind of put them
[2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:46.240]  into a zombie state but you're the expert on this but just as a medical
[2:28:46.240 --> 2:28:50.600]  doctor and observing people practicing for what 30 years have you noticed that
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:55.960]  it seems like people are becoming mentally retarded well what I have
[2:28:55.960 --> 2:29:01.760]  noticed which I remarked to my office staff I said I can't believe the number
[2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:05.960]  of young people that are coming into me saying they're having trouble with their
[2:29:05.960 --> 2:29:12.280]  memory I said you know when I was growing up I never heard a complaint that
[2:29:12.280 --> 2:29:16.840]  you had trouble with your memory if you know and when you were young you
[2:29:16.840 --> 2:29:20.160]  remember everybody's phone number everybody's name I remember every book in
[2:29:20.160 --> 2:29:26.680]  my library was like to turn to any page but more and more people are having
[2:29:26.680 --> 2:29:32.800]  difficulty with memory and cognitive functions that are very young and so
[2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:39.240]  yes something is going on and I think it's you know environmental influence
[2:29:39.240 --> 2:29:42.720]  environmental influence to stay there I want to talk more about that Dr. Russell
[2:29:42.720 --> 2:29:47.440]  Blaylock Blaylock report.com we really are thankful to have him this
[2:29:47.440 --> 2:29:56.000]  imminent scientist on with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[2:30:10.920 --> 2:30:14.840]  found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal
[2:30:14.840 --> 2:30:18.800]  drinking water many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive
[2:30:18.800 --> 2:30:22.880]  immune and developmental system diseases now what are you going to do about it

[2:32:09.960 --> 2:32:14.640]  number two our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric
[2:32:14.640 --> 2:32:18.800]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[2:32:18.800 --> 2:32:23.080]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[2:32:23.080 --> 2:32:26.360]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially with the high
[2:32:26.360 --> 2:32:29.760]  demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous summer
[2:32:29.760 --> 2:32:33.240]  storms season is here again every year thousands of families lose their power
[2:32:33.240 --> 2:32:37.440]  from weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides
[2:32:37.440 --> 2:32:41.280]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar

[2:33:17.480 --> 2:33:24.600]  okay Dr. Russell Blaylock rain surgeon neuroscience expert joining us right
[2:33:24.600 --> 2:33:33.320]  now we were getting into if people knew how deadly vaccines were they would
[2:33:33.320 --> 2:33:37.360]  never take them it does seem that's starting to come out I'm sure because I've
[2:33:37.360 --> 2:33:43.440]  seen you writing on it wait for years you've talked about all these degenerative
[2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:48.920]  diseases of the brain associated with different things in the vaccines not
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:54.440]  just the one that's making headlines right now that they're talking about but
[2:33:54.440 --> 2:34:00.000]  a whole a whole group of these but for listeners that just now joined us one of
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:05.360]  the headlines is swine flu jab link to killer nerve disease leak letter reveals
[2:34:05.360 --> 2:34:11.600]  concerns of neurologist over 25 deaths in America just in the trials and how to
[2:34:11.600 --> 2:34:16.480]  keep this secret from the public and then I have a whole other big stack top
[2:34:16.480 --> 2:34:27.280]  neurologist a whole bunch of top brain scientist neurosurgeons are saying the
[2:34:27.280 --> 2:34:31.400]  same thing in build the biggest newspaper in Germany they're saying it has
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:37.520]  live cancer viruses in it I mean this is just wild stuff but I want you to get
[2:34:37.520 --> 2:34:42.760]  into that doctor but first finishing up the break cut you off is the sluggish
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:48.080] ness the additives the vaccines the chemicals in the water is it a cocktail
[2:34:48.080 --> 2:34:51.200]  of those because yeah and I guess retarded is the word it's more of a
[2:34:51.200 --> 2:34:56.680]  sluggishness a almost a glazed over or is it a mix of watching four and a half
[2:34:56.680 --> 2:35:01.440]  hours of TV a day we're a very passive population I mean what is it because I
[2:35:01.440 --> 2:35:05.880]  look at old black and white photos I look at old family super eight video or
[2:35:05.880 --> 2:35:11.880]  or you know video or film shot 20 30 40 years ago my family they're alive they
[2:35:11.880 --> 2:35:17.160]  look awake I mean it's it's not nostalgia something real is going on
[2:35:17.160 --> 2:35:22.880]  there what is taking the spark out of people from your research well I think
[2:35:22.880 --> 2:35:27.120]  we look at it and a lot of scientists are beginning to agree with this is a
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:33.040]  number of environmental assault on people think like fluoride in water the
[2:35:33.040 --> 2:35:37.800]  heavy use of pesticides and herbicides it's all in the atmosphere you know they
[2:35:37.800 --> 2:35:42.360]  study people look at their their bad content of these chemicals they find
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:48.000]  something like 80 to 110 different organic chemicals from industry
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:54.560]  pesticides and herbicides in their tissues all of the vaccinations we give
[2:35:54.560 --> 2:36:01.560]  40 50 60 vaccines by the time a child enters college they're just being
[2:36:01.560 --> 2:36:07.040]  vaccinated to death well I'd be rather intense research in the literature
[2:36:07.040 --> 2:36:11.600]  collecting all that's known from our research in the neuroscience of
[2:36:11.600 --> 2:36:16.040]  vaccinations what it does well there's this compelling evidence that these
[2:36:16.040 --> 2:36:20.680]  vaccines the way they're being given is producing a state of chronic brain
[2:36:20.680 --> 2:36:25.800]  inflammation and that when your brain is chronically inflamed it produces
[2:36:25.800 --> 2:36:31.680]  depression it reduces disorientation confusion difficulty thinking clearly
[2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:37.680]  the cloud is thinking in your mind fatigue abnormal behavior even violent
[2:36:37.680 --> 2:36:43.280]  behavior criminal behavior suicide addictions the list just goes on and
[2:36:43.280 --> 2:36:48.480]  on and this is all well demonstrated in the scientific literature the problem is
[2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:54.240]  if it's never discussed because of the pressure and the power of those that are
[2:36:54.240 --> 2:36:59.400]  promoting these vaccines in our children for instance average child is getting 36
[2:36:59.400 --> 2:37:04.840]  vaccines by the time they start school that is an enormous assault on the
[2:37:04.840 --> 2:37:10.400]  brain by this this vaccine and the process by which they do it that is
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:15.960]  facing them every two months and giving five and six and seven vaccines at each
[2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:21.240]  office visit produces an enormous activation of the brain's immune system
[2:37:21.240 --> 2:37:27.960]  in a prolonged way and each section of our segment of that vaccination process
[2:37:27.960 --> 2:37:32.920]  produces a real hyper intense brain inflammation that in some children
[2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:39.160]  produces autism some ADHD some have seizures some have other neurological
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:44.200]  dysfunction well this whole flu vaccine thing they're planning on doing three
[2:37:44.200 --> 2:37:52.240]  serial vaccine within 21 days well if you look at the neuroscience of that that
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:37:57.640]  produces a rather significant prolonged brain inflammation particularly with the
[2:37:57.640 --> 2:38:03.480]  adjuvant they're going to use which is called MF-59 and ASO-3 which contains
[2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:09.440]  squalene squalene is associated with a very high incidence of autoimmune
[2:38:09.440 --> 2:38:14.120]  disorders particularly of the brain that produces a powerful growth of life
[2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:18.840]  syndrome in fact didn't have some of the best evidence was when they guinea pig
[2:38:18.840 --> 2:38:22.760]  a few years ago the anthrax shots to see what would happen with the troops in
[2:38:22.760 --> 2:38:27.240]  different levels and it it killed quite a few of them well it caused a 200
[2:38:27.240 --> 2:38:34.440]  percent increase and ALS Lou Gehrig disease which is a fatal disorder so they
[2:38:34.440 --> 2:38:38.120]  finally admitted that it took a long time to get them admitted that several
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:42.640]  I remember a lieutenant colonel testified for Congress and he was in the
[2:38:42.640 --> 2:38:49.240]  middle stages of ALS and eventually died it took a lot of pressure for they
[2:38:49.240 --> 2:38:54.320]  admitted yes the vaccine caused these soldiers to die from this horrible
[2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:58.960]  disease well it's not the only disease that's neurological this Gillian
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:04.600]  Boray ascending paralysis that she talked about well in 1976 there were over
[2:39:04.600 --> 2:39:10.680]  500 reported cases but there were probably 10 or a hundred times greater
[2:39:10.680 --> 2:39:14.600]  number of cases that were never reported because it's not a reportable
[2:39:14.600 --> 2:39:19.880]  disease don't have to report it they had three elderly people died in one
[2:39:19.880 --> 2:39:25.040]  vaccination center one day after receiving the vaccine and they're doing
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:29.600]  the same thing now they did back then it's the face with they tested one
[2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:34.640]  vaccine and then gave millions of people a different type thing that's exactly
[2:39:34.640 --> 2:39:39.800]  what they admit they're planning to do now I have in Nature magazine an
[2:39:39.800 --> 2:39:43.680]  interview with the head of the US Institute of Allergy and Selection
[2:39:43.680 --> 2:39:50.080]  Diseases Anthony Baldy at the eye and they asked him a series of questions one was
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:54.000]  what are you going to do to test this vaccine they said well we have five
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:58.920]  tests and they said well are you going to put the adjuvant in the vaccine to
[2:39:58.920 --> 2:40:03.840]  test it he said no we're going to test it without the adjuvant of children and
[2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:08.400]  pregnant women and other people and then he said well are you going to use the
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:14.880]  adjuvant of a vaccine when you actually give it to people he said yeah so they're
[2:40:14.880 --> 2:40:19.520]  testing one back thing and it's going to give a different back thing it's the
[2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:24.600]  adjuvant the powerful immune stimulant that produces most of the complications
[2:40:24.600 --> 2:40:29.000]  that are associated with vaccination and the next question he said are you
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:35.760]  going to test adjuvant in children and he said and I quote I don't think
[2:40:35.760 --> 2:40:43.520]  anybody has really good data on adjuvant in children and decision that we will
[2:40:43.520 --> 2:40:47.800]  not give it give the adjuvated blue vaccine to kids we don't have time to
[2:40:47.800 --> 2:40:52.920]  collect the actual data now we're during the test but one way back thing comes
[2:40:52.920 --> 2:40:57.800]  out the children would get a vaccine with adjuvant in it now Dr. Blalock
[2:40:57.800 --> 2:41:02.280]  just interrupt you talking to yourself and and and other scientists other
[2:41:02.280 --> 2:41:08.800]  medical doctors other brain surgeons and neurologists more and more realizing
[2:41:08.800 --> 2:41:14.320]  that yes mercury and and aluminum are bad do build up do cause problems when
[2:41:14.320 --> 2:41:17.600]  it's directly put in the bloodstream different from eating fish and it goes
[2:41:17.600 --> 2:41:21.600]  through you and is bound to the other you know you know other things in the
[2:41:21.600 --> 2:41:27.120]  food so most of it it leaves the body again I'm not here being a doctor I'm
[2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:30.920]  just going off what doctors have said do you agree with a lot of literature
[2:41:30.920 --> 2:41:35.920]  coming out that mercury overall was somewhat of a red herring that it's
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:41.400]  really the autoimmune inflammation not just in the brain but even in other
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:45.400]  organs that's being associated with burning out the pancreas attacking the
[2:41:45.400 --> 2:41:54.560]  liver attacking the stomach walls the intestinal walls the brain the I mean
[2:41:54.560 --> 2:41:58.880]  just basically the whole body well you know all of this has been proven and we
[2:41:58.880 --> 2:42:04.520]  know that mercury even if it in the Catholic small doses powerfully increases
[2:42:04.520 --> 2:42:09.920]  brain inflammation activates the brain immune system which is destructive of
[2:42:09.920 --> 2:42:14.760]  brain connect oh so mercury is the is the adjuvant okay so I always thought
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:19.640]  mercury was the preservative okay well it is but it also produces a high
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:25.880]  incidence of old immunity see they never mentioned that mercury does this about
[2:42:25.880 --> 2:42:31.720]  it but it's well demonstrated there's no question I mean it's accepted that an
[2:42:31.720 --> 2:42:37.520]  infinitely small doses it produces significant brain disruption it
[2:42:37.520 --> 2:42:40.160]  collects in the brain and stays there a lifetime
[2:42:40.160 --> 2:42:46.800]  for instance child in the past was given 36 vaccines most of which contain
[2:42:46.800 --> 2:42:51.600]  mercury each one of those doses accumulated in the brain for a lifetime
[2:42:51.600 --> 2:42:56.560]  whatever they ate whatever they braved in the air whatever their food was
[2:42:56.560 --> 2:43:01.840]  added to it this was totally ignored all of this stuff you hear about well we
[2:43:01.840 --> 2:43:07.280]  prove that vaccines mercury has no relation to these is an absolute lie
[2:43:07.280 --> 2:43:11.840]  and they know it it's in the scientific literature I write about it it's in my
[2:43:11.840 --> 2:43:17.400]  articles on my website I've published a number of articles on this all the
[2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:23.240]  references are there so they know it they know all of these things well doctor
[2:43:23.240 --> 2:43:27.960]  let me ask you a layman's question and then go in and other directions about
[2:43:27.960 --> 2:43:32.400]  this upcoming shot and what this Gillian Bernays is you know compared to the ALS
[2:43:32.400 --> 2:43:37.040]  and the other things you were you were talking about and all these new neuro
[2:43:37.040 --> 2:43:41.920]  degenerative diseases that I guess give the brain doctors a lot of work but is
[2:43:41.920 --> 2:43:45.200]  really being generated by this and other environmental factors that you were
[2:43:45.200 --> 2:43:50.360]  discussing when you've engaged in brain surgeries when you've done slides of
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:56.760]  tissue or biopsies I've seen just as a layman in medical journals the
[2:43:56.760 --> 2:44:02.360]  incredible heavy metal plaques the other plaques that are involved can you ever
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:06.880]  even say in an older person's brain that's had a large diet of heavy metals
[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:11.080]  or worked in toxic factories or had a lot of shots can you even see that in
[2:44:11.080 --> 2:44:15.760]  slides with the naked eye or what does it look like under a magnifying glass or
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:20.920]  under a microscope well you don't see the metals directly but you see the
[2:44:20.920 --> 2:44:25.320]  results of the battle and of course they they carefully measure these metal
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:29.480]  contents at the different parts of the brain if demonstrated for instance in
[2:44:29.480 --> 2:44:34.120]  Alzheimer's disease there's a significant elevation of mercury and the part of the
[2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:39.440]  brain affected in Alzheimer's patients they also have higher blood mercury
[2:44:39.440 --> 2:44:45.560]  levels than the the population about the disorder so most of these things have
[2:44:45.560 --> 2:44:49.520]  been carefully confirmed and measured the aluminum content of the brain has
[2:44:49.520 --> 2:44:54.080]  been measured and what aluminum does then the brain has been demonstrated
[2:44:54.080 --> 2:44:59.200]  quite clearly so yes you could see the pathology in the brain produced by this
[2:44:59.200 --> 2:45:05.680]  and in fact they even radio labels the aluminum in vaccine and traced it going
[2:45:05.680 --> 2:45:10.560]  from the side of the injection in the muscle and into the brain so we know
[2:45:10.560 --> 2:45:15.240]  that the aluminum from the vaccine ends up in the brain so you can't argue about
[2:45:15.240 --> 2:45:23.520]  that that's been that's been the pump med medical journals and quite well
[2:45:23.520 --> 2:45:28.440]  demonstrated so they you know the evidence is there it just enormous
[2:45:28.440 --> 2:45:33.520]  amounts it's just being ignored in the media than a state of confusion they're
[2:45:33.520 --> 2:45:37.480]  listening to the people who are selling this stuff and they won't listen to
[2:45:37.480 --> 2:45:42.760]  those of us who have researched it carefully now about your neurological
[2:45:42.760 --> 2:45:48.040]  diseases I will wager if they do what they're planning on doing you will see
[2:45:48.040 --> 2:45:53.800]  tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of cases of Guillaume Barre and
[2:45:53.800 --> 2:45:59.040]  other neurological damage in pregnant women their children are going to be
[2:45:59.040 --> 2:46:03.840]  damaged the children are going to be damaged they're planning on backfading
[2:46:03.840 --> 2:46:08.600]  babies this stuff and they even asked them what what do you think the effect
[2:46:08.600 --> 2:46:14.640]  will be of giving free vaccine let me give you his answer to that question we
[2:46:14.640 --> 2:46:19.760]  don't know that's the beginning of his answer we don't know what it'll do we
[2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:24.000]  don't know what happens when you combine vaccines with different viruses than
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:30.680]  well the virologists know the viruses start exchanging their genetic they
[2:46:30.680 --> 2:46:35.160]  develop hybrids they pronounce that develops new viruses they produce new
[2:46:35.160 --> 2:46:41.080]  diseases so he's lying and all of this nonsense will hold that you know the
[2:46:41.080 --> 2:46:45.960]  big scare is coming of course not many people dead in the world it's been a
[2:46:45.960 --> 2:46:51.480]  pretty mild flu they asked him well if the virus is mutating what good will the
[2:46:51.480 --> 2:46:55.720]  vaccine do and he says oh we've been checking the molecular and genetic
[2:46:55.720 --> 2:47:01.160]  make up these viruses all over the world it has not changed one bit that is a
[2:47:01.160 --> 2:47:05.720]  complete line and it's all over the news that a month ago in one week there were
[2:47:05.720 --> 2:47:12.320]  five new mutations at one lab just in Houston sir clearly you went over the
[2:47:12.320 --> 2:47:16.280]  medical journals and the facts dr. Blalock that they know what all this is
[2:47:16.280 --> 2:47:21.880]  doing when we look at Paul Ehrlich and John P. Holdren both presidential
[2:47:21.880 --> 2:47:26.040]  advisors one of them the head science are for those out there just now tuning
[2:47:26.040 --> 2:47:30.840]  in they openly say sterilize people through the vaccines sterilize them
[2:47:30.840 --> 2:47:35.720]  through the water other UN documents like their biological diversity
[2:47:35.720 --> 2:47:41.800]  assessment say use chemicals to brain damage the public Nobel Prize winners
[2:47:41.800 --> 2:47:46.720]  that we've quoted and covered my film in game like Bertrand Russell said we will
[2:47:46.720 --> 2:47:50.880]  inject the public with heavy metals and brain damage the lower classes to be our
[2:47:50.880 --> 2:47:55.480]  servants as a brain surgeon as a neurologist looking at this knowing
[2:47:55.480 --> 2:48:00.200]  they're lying knowing they know that one shot of the flu vaccine what what the
[2:48:00.200 --> 2:48:04.140]  reports are three flu shots doubles your chances of Alzheimer's in the in the
[2:48:04.140 --> 2:48:08.640]  studies so they if they know what they're doing then the question is why are
[2:48:08.640 --> 2:48:13.880]  they doing it is this part of the larger Brave New World Dr. Blalock well
[2:48:13.880 --> 2:48:20.040]  they're planning on giving the vaccine to 4.9 billion people worldwide they have
[2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:24.520]  been caught in the past giving back things that were specifically designed
[2:48:24.520 --> 2:48:30.320]  to produce infertility in African women other women caught on wouldn't take the
[2:48:30.320 --> 2:48:35.480]  vaccine they tested the vaccine and found out they had put anti-tropoblastic
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:41.760]  antigen in it with a specific goal of producing infertility so they have been
[2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:48.560]  caught using a tetanus vaccine they also used it in Central America to do that
[2:48:48.560 --> 2:48:53.480]  one thing is produced in fertility population control if you read the
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:58.600]  literature going back all the way to 1910 this has been an obsession with the
[2:48:58.600 --> 2:49:03.520]  Rockefeller Carnegie group is control of population growth and the reduced
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:09.240]  population of the world who was the great funder of molecular science
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:13.360]  throughout history and all the way up to the present day it's the Rockefeller
[2:49:13.360 --> 2:49:17.760]  Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation and now the Ford Foundation so you have
[2:49:17.760 --> 2:49:22.360]  major foundation worth hundreds of billions of dollars that have been
[2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:28.320]  pouring their money into the science with that golden mind they're eugenicist
[2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:32.600]  and as I said I wanted your other programs if you read Lily Kay's book
[2:49:32.600 --> 2:49:38.600]  on the history of molecular science she specifically says that was always their
[2:49:38.600 --> 2:49:44.600]  goal social engineering and control of population so I'm not surprised that they
[2:49:44.600 --> 2:49:51.400]  would use the vaccine on 4.9 billion people worldwide with that goal in mind
[2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:56.000]  well I agree with you it's this specific vaccine already causing deaths in the
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:50:00.880]  trials with secret memorandums in the federal government to keep that secret
[2:50:00.880 --> 2:50:05.000]  I would say this is the most suspect vaccine because they've been caught in
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:10.800]  the past adding the sterilence and other things to the larger programs that
[2:50:10.800 --> 2:50:16.440]  just makes sense if you're coming from their perspective well absolutely you
[2:50:16.440 --> 2:50:20.400]  know and a lot of people are catching on a third of the nurses that Britain said
[2:50:20.400 --> 2:50:26.680]  they won't take the vaccine more and more people are concerned about this we
[2:50:26.680 --> 2:50:31.320]  haven't even covered some of the major things like the the contamination cancer
[2:50:31.320 --> 2:50:37.320]  causing fires the unknown fires the neuro tropics cell fires all this is
[2:50:37.320 --> 2:50:42.400]  talked about in the closed meeting of a virologist but the general public has
[2:50:42.400 --> 2:50:50.000]  no clue the occurrence of all of this Dr. Russell Blaylock final segment with
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:53.080]  you straight ahead will get you on for an extended interview in the next few

[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:23.680]  you the same information there is nothing more important than this info
[2:54:23.680 --> 2:54:27.040]  we're going to get him on for a long interview in the next two weeks really
[2:54:27.040 --> 2:54:31.640]  honored to have him on whether it's the website is blalock report dot com bl a y
[2:54:31.640 --> 2:54:37.040]  l o c k report dot com a lot of friends and family won't listen to you or me or
[2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:40.960]  when we give a medical reports or when you give them german news and british
[2:54:40.960 --> 2:54:45.920]  news about how it's killing people in full of cancer viruses but if they see
[2:54:45.920 --> 2:54:51.680]  a youtube video of this interview or you send them one of his books or articles
[2:54:51.680 --> 2:54:57.440]  or materials from blalock report dot com you may save a life you know i was
[2:54:57.440 --> 2:55:00.320]  talking to a friend the other day about he told this guy you know don't give
[2:55:00.320 --> 2:55:04.080]  your kid those shots third round of shots his son's brain damage now doesn't
[2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:09.040]  talk this is a holocaust it's by design we got three and a half minutes left
[2:55:09.040 --> 2:55:14.000]  dr. blalock in closing they're talking about martial law forced inoculations
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:17.760]  the governor's association has sent a letter saying we don't want to be under
[2:55:17.760 --> 2:55:22.480]  dod control they're announcing 400 000 troops to now occupy
[2:55:22.480 --> 2:55:28.080]  that's the hill newspaper and ap and then as you said the cancer viruses all
[2:55:28.080 --> 2:55:33.680]  the other areas i mean this is insane your comments on that
[2:55:33.680 --> 2:55:37.920]  well yeah i mean according to the world health organization
[2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:42.720]  we come under uh... h i h r
[2:55:42.720 --> 2:55:46.400]  2500 which says that they have the legal right
[2:55:46.400 --> 2:55:52.160]  to control the response to public health emergencies in the united states of america
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:56.800]  so we are a signatory to that and therefore they have the right to
[2:55:56.800 --> 2:56:01.200]  carry out any measures they want and to recommend to our government
[2:56:01.200 --> 2:56:05.040]  uh... what measures need to be taken on the state level well all the plans have
[2:56:05.040 --> 2:56:09.520]  been worked out as you might uh... they're using the excuse of the troops
[2:56:09.520 --> 2:56:14.080]  in the response to the of the military uh... as the control
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:17.520]  riots of people who want to get the vaccine
[2:56:17.520 --> 2:56:20.960]  which i thought was rather humorous rather than being the other way around
[2:56:20.960 --> 2:56:25.520]  is people who don't want to get it
[2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:28.160]  well said
[2:56:28.160 --> 2:56:31.920]  and what about what about the cancer virus angle go ahead
[2:56:31.920 --> 2:56:36.000]  well yeah there is uh... dr martin who is a virologist
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:39.200]  and does a lot of research in this area and he's covered
[2:56:39.200 --> 2:56:43.440]  at what is stealth viruses which is now a lot of research around the world of
[2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:47.200]  stealth viruses but these are viruses that are not picked up by
[2:56:47.200 --> 2:56:50.720]  routine testing that's very uh...
[2:56:50.720 --> 2:56:53.920]  meticulous testing that demonstrated but these
[2:56:53.920 --> 2:56:58.160]  vaccines are filled with stealth viruses that can produce
[2:56:58.160 --> 2:57:02.400]  brain disorders uh... decades after you've been injected
[2:57:02.400 --> 2:57:07.040]  more cancer uh... there's cancer-causing viruses that are known
[2:57:07.040 --> 2:57:10.400]  inside of these vaccines uh... many of these uh...
[2:57:10.400 --> 2:57:14.400]  viruses aren't even tested for and they allow norbartists to
[2:57:14.400 --> 2:57:19.440]  blame the uh... vaccine people to uh... be the ones who's going to determine
[2:57:19.440 --> 2:57:23.840]  uh... how it's tested they're not even tested by outside agencies
[2:57:23.840 --> 2:57:30.080]  so there's a great deal of uh... danger involved here
[2:57:30.080 --> 2:57:33.120]  do you think the establishment's going to get away with this i mean as you said
[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:36.160]  earlier it looks like people everywhere waking up
[2:57:36.160 --> 2:57:40.320]  uh... but these these eugenicists are just so bold
[2:57:40.320 --> 2:57:44.400]  well they are but uh... you know with the uh... town hall meetings they think
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:49.120]  how the public can uh... react against these things and i think
[2:57:49.120 --> 2:57:52.960]  it'll take a reaction like that to bring this to a halt
[2:57:52.960 --> 2:57:58.720]  once people understand that uh... the vaccine is the big danger not the flu
[2:57:58.720 --> 2:58:02.880]  well congressman brown congressman paul former congressman dick army are all
[2:58:02.880 --> 2:58:07.680]  saying in major newspapers that they may use this for martial law
[2:58:07.680 --> 2:58:11.040]  so it's not just dr russell blalock or alex jones or
[2:58:11.040 --> 2:58:13.840]  you know us saying this from the wilderness the good news is
[2:58:13.840 --> 2:58:17.840]  people are waking up so maybe this push to make us take shots
[2:58:17.840 --> 2:58:22.560]  is an attempt to really try to try to uh...
[2:58:22.560 --> 2:58:26.960]  force us to go along with what they're doing and try to put the genie back in
[2:58:26.960 --> 2:58:29.280]  the bottle but i don't think that's going to happen
[2:58:29.280 --> 2:58:32.320]  dr blalock thank you so much for spending time with us

[3:01:52.880 --> 3:01:57.200]  make a decision unless as astrologers said gave speeches to the minute according
[3:01:57.200 --> 3:02:02.640]  to astrology hillary clinton doing seances uh with
[3:02:02.640 --> 3:02:09.120]  mrs roosevelt having shaman bohemian grove in the occultism
[3:02:09.120 --> 3:02:14.160]  skull and bones in the occultism uh it just comes out obama and all these
[3:02:14.160 --> 3:02:18.400]  weird shaman charms in his pocket and then it comes out
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:24.080]  witchcraft in the white house town hall with sources and documents and books
[3:02:24.080 --> 3:02:27.040]  coming out about it and then we have an article voodoo in the
[3:02:27.040 --> 3:02:29.680]  white house that goes into more detail we're about to go to break but i wanted
[3:02:29.680 --> 3:02:34.560]  to go to tex right now tex i mean uh everybody's freaking out about this
[3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:38.800]  but isn't this par for the course hey alex uh great to be with you again
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:42.720]  yes it is par for the course uh of course during the clinton white house
[3:02:42.720 --> 3:02:47.120]  uh you mentioned hillary ronald clinton who went on top of the roof
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:51.440]  uh and actually invoked the spirits of the sky to come in
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:55.520]  to the white house she was up there with a new age shaman
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:03:02.320]  uh witch named uh gene euston who was her her guru and you know hillary
[3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:08.400]  also spoke uh by her own admission to both the spirit of mohawk me gondy
[3:03:08.400 --> 3:03:13.840]  and uh to uh elinor rosebell but but now the obama's
[3:03:13.840 --> 3:03:18.080]  uh it's very hard to find direct uh connection with
[3:03:18.080 --> 3:03:21.840]  barock his wife has a little to this from her mother
[3:03:21.840 --> 3:03:27.200]  but i'll tell you uh you know i i just finished a new video about obama myself
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:31.200]  and uh there'll be out september 1st called roth child's choice
[3:03:31.200 --> 3:03:36.080]  and i was able to find some amazing things and maybe when we come back
[3:03:36.080 --> 3:03:40.880]  i'll be glad to reveal these african tribal religion
[3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:45.040]  uh and then you know about this group called pink
[3:03:45.040 --> 3:03:49.520]  which is a supposedly an anti-war group but it turns out it's really a
[3:03:49.520 --> 3:03:53.360]  witchcraft a wicca group that's a big supporter
[3:03:53.360 --> 3:03:57.360]  uh of obama and in fact uh they actually held a
[3:03:57.360 --> 3:04:04.640]  witchcraft ritual to look at this the alex to cleanse the white house
[3:04:04.640 --> 3:04:10.000]  of bad spirits and omens uh on the last day of george bush in office so
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:18.160]  you know when you use witches uh to to to have a ritual to cleanse
[3:04:18.160 --> 3:04:21.600]  the white house well i wonder who they actually invited in
[3:04:21.600 --> 3:04:25.760]  to the white house so but uh that was code pink
[3:04:25.760 --> 3:04:32.400]  uh a very interesting group that uh is known supposedly
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:36.800]  for uh being its anti-war activity but in fact
[3:04:36.800 --> 3:04:41.600]  it seems like they're they're being very quiet almost mute about the
[3:04:41.600 --> 3:04:46.720]  obama's intensification of the war text mar stay with us you're an expert in

[3:08:21.920 --> 3:08:25.520]  tex marz is our guest the reason i brought up in the last segment the
[3:08:25.520 --> 3:08:29.920]  order of death the 45 minute film that's on the same
[3:08:29.920 --> 3:08:35.440]  dvd with the two-hour film dark secrets inside bohemian grove that tex is in
[3:08:35.440 --> 3:08:38.880]  a few years after i snuck into bohemian grove
[3:08:38.880 --> 3:08:43.840]  with mike hanson back in 2000 our camera guy at home and was already out
[3:08:43.840 --> 3:08:47.440]  there visiting family in california he drove up
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:55.200]  and there was the bohemian grove action network a local peace group
[3:08:55.200 --> 3:08:58.480]  who had criticized me in the newspaper saying there's nothing occult at the
[3:08:58.480 --> 3:09:03.040]  grove there's no occultism alex is a cook there is no you know
[3:09:03.040 --> 3:09:07.040]  none of this is real this was the group protesting the grove
[3:09:07.040 --> 3:09:10.560]  and it turned out they had a witch's cauldron out we're doing
[3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:15.920]  uh chance like luke skywalker believe they were firing force beams in going
[3:09:15.920 --> 3:09:20.480]  oh power beam power beam you know like a cartoon
[3:09:20.480 --> 3:09:23.440]  and it's the same thing tex was just talking about you have this big anti-
[3:09:23.440 --> 3:09:28.000]  war group that supports obama but really it turns out it's a voodoo group
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:31.280]  and that's what san aria is is a white magic variant of that
[3:09:31.280 --> 3:09:36.080]  so going back to tex mars the headline at info wars dot com voodoo
[3:09:36.080 --> 3:09:40.720]  in the white house and it turns out obama is very very scared of this
[3:09:40.720 --> 3:09:44.480]  uh but again obama shouldn't just be singled out
[3:09:44.480 --> 3:09:47.760]  uh i'm sure they'll say voodoo is the new n word you're not allowed to
[3:09:47.760 --> 3:09:52.960]  criticize voodoo or you don't like obama uh but uh text please continue
[3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:56.000]  well you know you mentioned this group code pink
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:10:00.160]  uh and what we have to understand about this group this is a group that could
[3:10:00.160 --> 3:10:04.160]  possibly show up uh when folks like we are change who are
[3:10:04.160 --> 3:10:08.320]  pretty good people are out there uh in an attempt
[3:10:08.320 --> 3:10:14.320]  uh to sort of play off of that uh but but let's let's look at the group okay
[3:10:14.320 --> 3:10:17.200]  first of all i want you to want people to understand
[3:10:17.200 --> 3:10:21.040]  that this is not some odd group in terms of the obama white house
[3:10:21.040 --> 3:10:24.320]  because in the nation magazine you know the nation is one of the more liberal
[3:10:24.320 --> 3:10:29.120]  magazines it's been on bookstores uh you know barns and noble and
[3:10:29.120 --> 3:10:33.120]  barters uh the bookstore shelves for you know
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:36.560]  years decades and decades so this is an old line
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:40.880]  liberal left wing uh democrat party publication
[3:10:40.880 --> 3:10:45.280]  now uh picture nabovsky who writes for the nation
[3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:49.280]  uh on january the 20th actually reported the fact
[3:10:49.280 --> 3:10:56.640]  that that only you know when obama was to be inaugurated uh he invited
[3:10:56.640 --> 3:11:02.000]  his top campaign people to to the inaugural and they actually went on the
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:05.680]  train so it was a big deal you know the campaign train
[3:11:05.680 --> 3:11:10.480]  now nabovsky reported that one of his seatmates
[3:11:10.480 --> 3:11:15.360]  was a member of this code pink and they were talking about the planning
[3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:21.200]  for a rally to cleanse the white house for a wicken ritual by this code
[3:11:21.200 --> 3:11:25.360]  pink well alex obviously i was very interested in
[3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:29.440]  finding out who is this code pink that is such a powerful group
[3:11:29.440 --> 3:11:33.040]  that its leaders are asked to ride on the campaign train
[3:11:33.040 --> 3:11:35.840]  with obama and they're going to have this ritual to cleanse
[3:11:35.840 --> 3:11:39.920]  cleanse the white house well i found three very interesting people who are
[3:11:39.920 --> 3:11:43.120]  the founders of it the first one is the well-known
[3:11:43.120 --> 3:11:48.640]  witch miriam star hawk uh you know my wife wonder wrote the book new age lies
[3:11:48.640 --> 3:11:52.640]  to women that expose witchcraft in the christian
[3:11:52.640 --> 3:11:56.720]  church even star hawk is one of the people that she exposed
[3:11:56.720 --> 3:12:02.080]  this earth witchcraft wicca activism uh so star hawk and by the way that's not
[3:12:02.080 --> 3:12:05.520]  her real name she's actually a jewish woman named miriam
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:10.640]  simos these are three zionist jewish women now this is what makes it
[3:12:10.640 --> 3:12:14.480]  interesting they claim to be anti-war they're they all are big
[3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:19.680]  backers of obama uh and and they they actually
[3:12:19.680 --> 3:12:23.680]  did such things as they would go and interrupt sarah palin speeches
[3:12:23.680 --> 3:12:28.160]  they did that on a complication they once blocked traffic on golden gate bridge
[3:12:28.160 --> 3:12:31.200]  in san francisco they did a demonstration in front of
[3:12:31.200 --> 3:12:34.800]  fort hood that was the austin texas chapter and by the way they have some
[3:12:34.800 --> 3:12:38.240]  they did they put out a book and they had some big names in the book
[3:12:38.240 --> 3:12:44.480]  amy goodman janine garifalo nancy polosi ariana huffington
[3:12:44.480 --> 3:12:48.880]  all of these people wrote in this code pink book so you can see
[3:12:48.880 --> 3:12:54.800]  the power level of this group now the other two members are a woman named jody
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:57.680]  evans evidently she held this witchcraft ritual
[3:12:57.680 --> 3:13:01.680]  to cleanse the white house she went down to el salvador all of these are
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:05.600]  common as socialists she went down to el salvador
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:10.480]  uh to work with these apatistas her husband was a wealthy although most of
[3:13:10.480 --> 3:13:15.840]  these women are lesbian uh she went down she had a wealthy uh billionaire husband
[3:13:15.840 --> 3:13:21.040]  by the way they're a big supporter of the lgbt you know the lesbian gay bisexual
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:26.800]  transgender agenda and they were very happy i understand yesterday because
[3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:30.880]  a president obama and eric holder the attorney general
[3:13:30.880 --> 3:13:36.240]  uh came out against the defense of marriage act they want it repealed
[3:13:36.240 --> 3:13:40.720]  uh and that pleased the uh the lesbians and the transgender people
[3:13:40.720 --> 3:13:45.040]  but the big thing about code pink being socialist common as being part of the
[3:13:45.040 --> 3:13:49.280]  obama campaign uh a funding network is it
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:54.880]  there for a global government in other words the new world order and culture
[3:13:54.880 --> 3:13:58.640]  but now get this alex you know there's a law right now if you were to send
[3:13:58.640 --> 3:14:02.800]  fifty dollars to some you know arab group
[3:14:02.800 --> 3:14:07.520]  that that they claim is al-qaeda they put you in prison would they not
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:13.600]  absolutely yeah but wait this group code pink gave six hundred
[3:14:13.600 --> 3:14:18.400]  thousand dollars in food and medicine and cash
[3:14:18.400 --> 3:14:24.240]  to the to the uh iraqi insurgents that were fighting the americans
[3:14:24.240 --> 3:14:29.600]  and this whole deal for them to give this money and and and materials to the
[3:14:29.600 --> 3:14:33.920]  al-qaeda insurgents supposedly if you even believe there's al-qaeda
[3:14:33.920 --> 3:14:41.360]  in iraq was all managed by carsman henry waxman but it expands from there
[3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:44.800]  we now learn that black water and others were bringing arms in
[3:14:44.800 --> 3:14:49.520]  in federal documents to the insurgents that they were bringing in taliban this
[3:14:49.520 --> 3:14:55.040]  is confirmed uh now mainstream news into iraq to kill the troops the british
[3:14:55.040 --> 3:14:58.080]  special forces were caught in bazaar dressed up
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:15:04.480]  like sunnis shooting police now that's times of london confirmed and so acting
[3:15:04.480 --> 3:15:09.760]  like peace activists they're actually helping get the goods in
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:12.240]  to continue what's happening is that what you're saying
[3:15:12.240 --> 3:15:16.720]  yeah absolutely because what they want is to continue destabilizing
[3:15:16.720 --> 3:15:20.800]  the iraqi economy and government and that gives us
[3:15:20.800 --> 3:15:24.720]  the united states and israel the pretext to maintain our troop
[3:15:24.720 --> 3:15:30.640]  support there so why we can't leave as long as the
[3:15:30.640 --> 3:15:36.720]  re waxman is jewish uh this congressman and he's one of the biggest
[3:15:36.720 --> 3:15:42.240]  backers of israel so what is he doing helping this group code pink this
[3:15:42.240 --> 3:15:46.960]  socialist communist group gives six hundred thousand dollars to the insurgents
[3:15:46.960 --> 3:15:50.160]  at beluga in iraq you get the whole deal here the
[3:15:50.160 --> 3:15:55.920]  picture is they're the troublemakers they have to destabilize the country
[3:15:55.920 --> 3:15:59.280]  and that is a pretext for american military invention
[3:15:59.280 --> 3:16:03.360]  and maintaining our forces over there so the whole thing is a big setup now by
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:07.200]  the way what the third founder in addition to
[3:16:07.200 --> 3:16:13.360]  witch star hawk and his jody evans is a woman named madia benjamin
[3:16:13.360 --> 3:16:19.680]  now her real name is not madia it's susan but she changed it to madia which is
[3:16:19.680 --> 3:16:24.960]  the name of the greek goddess of magic and witchcraft
[3:16:24.960 --> 3:16:29.680]  which i think is quite interesting and thus again we see the witchcraft element
[3:16:29.680 --> 3:16:34.880]  in this uh code okay well well well well text i want to go over that with you but
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:39.920]  the first uh his mother or his mother-in-law
[3:16:39.920 --> 3:16:45.200]  uh running around in the white house doing voodoo
[3:16:45.200 --> 3:16:51.360]  uh i mean is there no end to this i mean voodoo is about terrorizing people
[3:16:51.360 --> 3:16:55.840]  scaring people it says it says here that she believes she's dying even though
[3:16:55.840 --> 3:17:00.560]  she isn't sick you know classic voodoo superstition
[3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:05.280]  uh talk about voodoo economics this is voodoo in the white house
[3:17:05.280 --> 3:17:09.360]  well it is you're talking about the 72-year-old mother of uh
[3:17:09.360 --> 3:17:15.680]  michelle obama maryon robinson who evidently was practicing santeria
[3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:21.360]  and you're right it is voodoo uh and and by the way i have a picture of obama
[3:17:21.360 --> 3:17:27.680]  in my upcoming video uh from the 19 a 1996 edition of the new yorker
[3:17:27.680 --> 3:17:31.840]  it pictures a you know he was in his 30s then
[3:17:31.840 --> 3:17:35.840]  obama sitting with michelle on on their living room couch
[3:17:35.840 --> 3:17:43.120]  she has a very close cropped apro haircut uh and right but it's very
[3:17:43.120 --> 3:17:46.880]  interesting this whole thing was staged this picture in the new yorker
[3:17:46.880 --> 3:17:51.040]  to his immediate right on the table beside him in his living room
[3:17:51.040 --> 3:17:55.200]  is a little statuette an idol of an of a
[3:17:55.200 --> 3:18:00.320]  santeria uh basically a west african because the santeria
[3:18:00.320 --> 3:18:04.560]  is very big in the caribbean and cuba the caribbean islands
[3:18:04.560 --> 3:18:10.000]  now of course unfortunately in florida they've been given taxes in 501c3
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:13.520]  taxes them say this is a church in america although they uh
[3:18:13.520 --> 3:18:16.960]  they conduct rituals and no when you land anywhere in a cruise ship now i've
[3:18:16.960 --> 3:18:20.560]  only been on two cruises and everywhere we land they're out doing
[3:18:20.560 --> 3:18:25.120]  voodoo rituals when you get off and they're taking it real serious and
[3:18:25.120 --> 3:18:28.320]  and boy look look what voodoo has done for their country i mean it's just
[3:18:28.320 --> 3:18:31.600]  absolutely brings your country down but go ahead
[3:18:31.600 --> 3:18:37.680]  oh it does well here is obama sitting and right beside him is a devil god
[3:18:37.680 --> 3:18:42.640]  totem idol right there in his living room on the wall behind him
[3:18:42.640 --> 3:18:47.760]  uh or uh lithographs or pictures of indonesian
[3:18:47.760 --> 3:18:53.600]  uh bolly uh dancers to their pagan god well listen we're doing a web search on
[3:18:53.600 --> 3:18:56.160]  this right now you said that was in the new yorker
[3:18:56.160 --> 3:19:04.080]  yeah try 1996 okay 1996 new yorker photo michelle obama barack obama or photo
[3:19:04.080 --> 3:19:08.720]  young barack obama and michelle obama that's right it's interesting that this
[3:19:08.720 --> 3:19:13.360]  that in 1996 when americans didn't even know who barack obama was
[3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:17.840]  the new yorker would would profile this young and up-and-coming man
[3:19:17.840 --> 3:19:22.320]  with his wife but again the big thing was that we found it we found it we found
[3:19:22.320 --> 3:19:26.480]  the photo i'm sorry good good notice to the to his right
[3:19:26.480 --> 3:19:30.960]  in fact i i believe even his arm is headed that away
[3:19:30.960 --> 3:19:34.400]  and notice the that they have the the v there
[3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:37.920]  now nelson mandela was a big practiser
[3:19:37.920 --> 3:19:44.160]  or is a big practiser of this uh religion which is really an african
[3:19:44.160 --> 3:19:48.320]  american religion that was brought over by the slaves
[3:19:48.320 --> 3:19:53.280]  and became big in cuba and throughout the caribbean all right stay there voodoo
[3:19:53.280 --> 3:19:56.720]  the new religion of the united states there is
[3:19:56.720 --> 3:20:03.040]  a a religion now in america voodoo we'll be right back most americans know the

[3:21:34.320 --> 3:21:37.440]  debt is this capitalism or was jefferson correct when he
[3:21:37.440 --> 3:21:41.120]  said a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the
[3:21:41.120 --> 3:21:43.440]  liberties of the people in a standing army
[3:21:43.440 --> 3:21:47.200]  hi tit anderson i'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains

[3:22:13.920 --> 3:22:17.200]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:22:17.200 --> 3:22:20.400]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[3:22:20.400 --> 3:22:24.880]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election

[3:25:45.760 --> 3:25:49.440]  cue it up to him when they invoke the spirits and they thank the spirits for
[3:25:49.440 --> 3:25:52.880]  being there and there's the witches pot
[3:25:52.880 --> 3:25:57.040]  she plays the part of the young goddess and i mean this just goes on and on
[3:25:57.040 --> 3:26:01.120]  ladies and gentlemen and whatever the issue is most cps workers
[3:26:01.120 --> 3:26:04.080]  are these people and they hunt christian kids down
[3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:08.560]  we've proven it they love taking them and where else can you snatch kids i mean
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:11.520]  i'm just telling you what they're into am i saying all these people are into
[3:26:11.520 --> 3:26:13.760]  that no but the point is they always say there's
[3:26:13.760 --> 3:26:16.800]  none of this going on the truth is they don't want you knowing about their
[3:26:16.800 --> 3:26:20.160]  religion because their religion is king in this world
[3:26:20.160 --> 3:26:24.800]  tex mars please continue sir so so you so you told us about the photo we pulled
[3:26:24.800 --> 3:26:28.400]  it up of barack obama with his wife with his
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:32.560]  particular god you were getting into this being an african-american religion
[3:26:32.560 --> 3:26:37.280]  brought over from africa voodoo spirit possession tell us what it is
[3:26:37.280 --> 3:26:40.080]  okay now when we look at santerie it comes from
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:45.760]  west africa from nigeria from the congo and slaves brought it back
[3:26:45.760 --> 3:26:49.600]  uh and it really you know took over havana
[3:26:49.600 --> 3:26:54.160]  uh cuba throughout the caribbean and by the way there is a
[3:26:54.160 --> 3:26:57.680]  church given official status in the united states
[3:26:57.680 --> 3:27:01.120]  and there was a little problem with it because they wanted to and they do
[3:27:01.120 --> 3:27:05.120]  they actually are to this very day it is now legal
[3:27:05.120 --> 3:27:08.080]  for this church according to supreme court
[3:27:08.080 --> 3:27:12.720]  uh the church of babalu i the church of babalu i which is a
[3:27:12.720 --> 3:27:17.040]  santeria uh a church worship of god demons
[3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:20.560]  and that they sacrificed chickens goats
[3:27:20.560 --> 3:27:26.160]  some say cats and dogs and and one case up in new york state they actually
[3:27:26.160 --> 3:27:29.760]  sacrificed a young girl a young beautiful cheerleader
[3:27:29.760 --> 3:27:35.120]  17 year old put a plastic bag overhead and had a santeria
[3:27:35.120 --> 3:27:39.440]  uh the demonic exorcism forum of course she ended up dead
[3:27:39.440 --> 3:27:44.000]  so so this is a very dangerous religion but when you begin to sacrifice
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:48.160]  chickens and goats and they use the blood uh for various things they also use
[3:27:48.160 --> 3:27:52.640]  the menstrual blood of women and mix it with some kind of evil
[3:27:52.640 --> 3:27:57.600]  potion and by the way abu graib as you know but also a camp x-ray they let the
[3:27:57.600 --> 3:28:02.240]  cia interrogators practice raping the muslim men
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:06.640]  with menstruating women to freak them out so but notice it's always an excuse
[3:28:06.640 --> 3:28:11.520]  to really just do their ritual absolutely now here's an interesting thing
[3:28:11.520 --> 3:28:15.840]  you know i did some research some time ago of this trinity united
[3:28:15.840 --> 3:28:21.360]  church of christ the member obama was a member there for 20 years dr jeremiah
[3:28:21.360 --> 3:28:25.840]  right if you if you go online you can still get i checked it out today right

[3:28:35.280 --> 3:28:39.760]  line this is what his church was all about he cannot say he did not know this
[3:28:39.760 --> 3:28:43.920]  this is their official statement of beliefs and doctrines

[3:29:22.880 --> 3:29:27.760]  yeah it's a front for a voodoo cult uh no doubt about that
[3:29:27.760 --> 3:29:33.040]  there is not one mention of jesus christ in the entire they have a bag you said

[3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:12.960]  santeria african american religion uh black theology you know that the black
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:16.400]  liberation theology but here's a news item from us
[3:34:16.400 --> 3:34:21.040]  say today an actual picture from page 386 of my own book mysterious
[3:34:21.040 --> 3:34:24.560]  monument that that you offer uh folks there and
[3:34:24.560 --> 3:34:28.000]  and you know people say witches in washington dc
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:31.520]  doing a ritual to cleanse the the white house and
[3:34:31.520 --> 3:34:36.960]  in preparation for obama taking over but but look at this one this is from the
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:41.200]  usa today newspaper and it shows these witches now they do this every
[3:34:41.200 --> 3:34:44.320]  year they're scheduled this september to go back again
[3:34:44.320 --> 3:34:50.400]  uh for their i think it's their 18th annual prayer vigil now notice this
[3:34:50.400 --> 3:34:55.520]  exactly 33 hours alex because 33 is the highest
[3:34:55.520 --> 3:35:01.040]  ritual number of free masonry scottish right free masonry 33
[3:35:01.040 --> 3:35:06.160]  33 just happens to be the age with jesus christ was slain on the cross
[3:35:06.160 --> 3:35:09.920]  and there are other various satanic reasons that they honor
[3:35:09.920 --> 3:35:14.000]  in numerology the number 33 but notice they're doing a
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:19.440]  circle witchcraft ritual around what what else but the obelisk
[3:35:19.440 --> 3:35:26.080]  which is the phallus of the sun god in ancient mystery religion symbology
[3:35:26.080 --> 3:35:29.920]  so they're worshiping the dare i say it the
[3:35:29.920 --> 3:35:37.680]  the the sex organ of the of the sun god and this is in washington dc
[3:35:37.680 --> 3:35:41.600]  uh i i i would not be surprised if toad pink was there
[3:35:41.600 --> 3:35:45.680]  uh with the witch uh star hawk one of their founders
[3:35:45.680 --> 3:35:52.080]  but alex back to this united uh church of christ this trinity
[3:35:52.080 --> 3:35:56.160]  united church of christ yeah in fact we have their website here it is exactly
[3:35:56.160 --> 3:36:00.720]  as you said it's a african spiritual center for voodoo
[3:36:00.720 --> 3:36:04.720]  they just basically admit it right there now one of the things that this dr
[3:36:04.720 --> 3:36:09.520]  jeremiah right teaches is black liberation theology
[3:36:09.520 --> 3:36:16.240]  and a textbook that he uses is from professor james cone harvard university
[3:36:16.240 --> 3:36:20.320]  now that's old uh barack obama's alma mater the same place where you know
[3:36:20.320 --> 3:36:25.680]  professor gates came uh it comes from now professor cone
[3:36:25.680 --> 3:36:30.880]  wrote the the i mean the primal textbook entitled a black theology of
[3:36:30.880 --> 3:36:35.920]  liberation and on page 62 is an amazing quote alex i like to
[3:36:35.920 --> 3:36:42.240]  read because it'll explain a lot it says the goal of black theology now
[3:36:42.240 --> 3:36:46.720]  remember this was what was taught all 20 years at this church
[3:36:46.720 --> 3:36:50.320]  that obama went to the goal of black theology
[3:36:50.320 --> 3:36:57.120]  is the destruction of everything white so that blacks can be liberated
[3:36:57.120 --> 3:37:04.880]  from alien gods now alien gods would be jesus christ
[3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:08.800]  he's an alien god of the right man but i'll tell you this i i've discovered
[3:37:08.800 --> 3:37:11.200]  in in writings and i'm sure i've never really seen anything that
[3:37:11.200 --> 3:37:15.280]  i'm aware of the texas and already aware of very rarely so
[3:37:15.280 --> 3:37:19.600]  that actually the white supremacist a hundred years ago the eugenesis said if
[3:37:19.600 --> 3:37:22.160]  we can't ship all the blacks back to africa
[3:37:22.160 --> 3:37:26.880]  we'll fund a black liberation movement to balkanize them and to make them not
[3:37:26.880 --> 3:37:31.280]  want to intermarry with anybody but blacks and you see today that a lot of
[3:37:31.280 --> 3:37:34.320]  blacks don't want black babies adopted out to anybody else
[3:37:34.320 --> 3:37:37.920]  let them stay in institutions don't marry anybody but a black person
[3:37:37.920 --> 3:37:42.400]  the white supremacist actually like that so this is very very slick
[3:37:42.400 --> 3:37:46.320]  system for the eugenesis if they can't kill the blacks off
[3:37:46.320 --> 3:37:50.240]  they'll at least fund and finance the most destructive things of african
[3:37:50.240 --> 3:37:53.600]  culture like voodoo and get them to have it part of their
[3:37:53.600 --> 3:37:57.120]  culture to only stay with each other and and that's blacks right if they want
[3:37:57.120 --> 3:38:00.240]  to do that i'm just saying the big foundations funded
[3:38:00.240 --> 3:38:04.240]  that were you aware of that text yes i am in fact even the communist party
[3:38:04.240 --> 3:38:08.480]  u.s.a. promoted that very idea gus hall
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:12.080]  you know one of the top guys there for 17 years the president of it
[3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:16.160]  his one of his main things was to reach out and bring
[3:38:16.160 --> 3:38:21.040]  blacks into the communist party and thus the reason why frank marshall davis who
[3:38:21.040 --> 3:38:26.400]  was uh barack obama's mentor uh over in uh you know hawaii
[3:38:26.400 --> 3:38:30.560]  he was a member of the communist party u.s.a so there there has been this
[3:38:30.560 --> 3:38:35.200]  communist socialist uh african religion thing
[3:38:35.200 --> 3:38:38.720]  by the way this this trinity united church of christ
[3:38:38.720 --> 3:38:42.400]  in their statement of beliefs they call it the
[3:38:42.400 --> 3:38:45.680]  the the black uh let's see what it's called
[3:38:45.680 --> 3:38:51.040]  oh yeah black value system number eight is very interesting it's and i think
[3:38:51.040 --> 3:38:54.400]  you've got it right there yourself on the internet it's the
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:38:59.680]  disavowal of the pursuit of middle class in this
[3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:06.320]  in other words they want to stay blacks they want to stay victims forever
[3:39:06.320 --> 3:39:10.160]  they say we will not pursue being part of the middle class
[3:39:10.160 --> 3:39:15.360]  will notice they tell white yuppies homogenize give up your class because
[3:39:15.360 --> 3:39:18.400]  they see that as the dominant group and then the other groups they want them
[3:39:18.400 --> 3:39:21.760]  vulcanized so they can play us off against each other
[3:39:21.760 --> 3:39:26.480]  absolutely this is the whole thing that they want blacks to stay away
[3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:32.720]  from the middle class uh because in other words if we can
[3:39:32.720 --> 3:39:37.920]  state to ourselves stay a a slave race and then of course we'll be
[3:39:37.920 --> 3:39:42.720]  warriors against uh everything white their black theology
[3:39:42.720 --> 3:39:46.320]  liberation theology is that the destruction of everything
[3:39:46.320 --> 3:39:51.200]  white now why is it that the liberal left-wing press in america
[3:39:51.200 --> 3:39:58.240]  nbc abc cbs cnn why are they concerned about such a race of
[3:39:58.240 --> 3:40:02.560]  blatant racism on the part of this church well let me just stop you i'm
[3:40:02.560 --> 3:40:06.320]  reading tarpoli's book here trying to i read it and remember but i'm trying to
[3:40:06.320 --> 3:40:09.600]  find the part uh in barack h obama the unauthorized
[3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:11.920]  biography that we have available at info wars dot com
[3:40:11.920 --> 3:40:15.360]  just totally separately he's a historian backing you up
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:19.680]  he just is reporting the facts about voodoo rituals
[3:40:19.680 --> 3:40:24.080]  at the church about the trilateral commission funding jeremiah right
[3:40:24.080 --> 3:40:28.000]  uh and and how they control these communities in the big cities through
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:32.480]  these groups so just amazing tax it is now another element that's
[3:40:32.480 --> 3:40:36.080]  that's part of this this uh anti christianity
[3:40:36.080 --> 3:40:41.120]  is the the free masonry the secret society known as free masonry
[3:40:41.120 --> 3:40:44.720]  uh and in fact uh i have an ad i'm looking at it here
[3:40:44.720 --> 3:40:50.400]  the uh the mason's actually had a masonic inaugural ball
[3:40:50.400 --> 3:40:54.560]  for the 44th president of the united states barack obama
[3:40:54.560 --> 3:40:57.760]  sponsored by the washington dc lodge number seven
[3:40:57.760 --> 3:41:01.840]  i think that's interesting of course barack obama is reputedly a member of
[3:41:01.840 --> 3:41:05.120]  the prince hall mason's that's the black mason's
[3:41:05.120 --> 3:41:09.600]  and it's interesting here again the masonic lodge
[3:41:09.600 --> 3:41:15.600]  uh has has purposely created a black a segregated black
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:18.640]  masonic group called the prince hall mason's
[3:41:18.640 --> 3:41:22.400]  and every well-known black leader is a member of it
[3:41:22.400 --> 3:41:26.560]  uh reverend al sharpton yep he's a mason
[3:41:26.560 --> 3:41:30.160]  jesse jackson you better believe it he is a mason
[3:41:30.160 --> 3:41:34.480]  uh what what's the guy's the head of the NAACP
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:40.400]  andrew young he's a mason uh a former head so all of the top from jesse jackson
[3:41:40.400 --> 3:41:44.480]  to barack obama they're all high-level masons in fact
[3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:48.080]  even the louis ferrican of the black muslims
[3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:54.640]  he is also a 33rd degree prince hall mason so the masonic thing and of course
[3:41:54.640 --> 3:41:59.760]  they they they literally worship this ancient mystery religion god
[3:41:59.760 --> 3:42:05.520]  his name is a jambulan so you you you see where everything comes together with
[3:42:05.520 --> 3:42:08.880]  his pagan mystery religion whether it's code paint
[3:42:08.880 --> 3:42:12.800]  whether it's trinity united church of christ that obama went to
[3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:16.240]  whether it's the free masons whether it's a santeria
[3:42:16.240 --> 3:42:20.240]  uh religion of michelle obama's uh mother
[3:42:20.240 --> 3:42:24.240]  uh the 72-year-old marion robert notice attacks on me to finish that key
[3:42:24.240 --> 3:42:27.840]  point but they always want to keep it secret that the devil's biggest trick
[3:42:27.840 --> 3:42:30.400]  is denying he exists they always want to deny their
[3:42:30.400 --> 3:42:33.280]  sacrificing people when every one of these cults did this
[3:42:33.280 --> 3:42:36.720]  whether it was the Aztecs or northern europeans
[3:42:36.720 --> 3:42:41.600]  or central asian cults or african cults they all sacrifice people
[3:42:41.600 --> 3:42:46.240]  why all through all the anthropology of the world and its whole history
[3:42:46.240 --> 3:42:50.400]  of man do you see these devil cults what is the point
[3:42:50.400 --> 3:42:54.320]  why does this keep reoccurring looking at it as a professor
[3:42:54.320 --> 3:42:57.920]  uh i understand you're saying it's religious it's good it's evil but
[3:42:57.920 --> 3:43:02.640]  atheists will say this isn't even going on they can only identify christianity
[3:43:02.640 --> 3:43:06.640]  and say it's quaint and old-fashioned and stupid but they love all the other
[3:43:06.640 --> 3:43:10.640]  religions as the united nations biological diversity assessment treaty
[3:43:10.640 --> 3:43:14.400]  of 96 says we will reintroduce the pagan cults
[3:43:14.400 --> 3:43:17.760]  of human sacrifice and of killing humans for the earth
[3:43:17.760 --> 3:43:21.520]  this will be our new world religion there is
[3:43:21.520 --> 3:43:25.760]  you know how i must go back to religion because in the old testament
[3:43:25.760 --> 3:43:29.440]  there's something very interesting but that's what i'm saying text is that
[3:43:29.440 --> 3:43:33.280]  yes we're christians but i'm saying the atheists will deny this exists just
[3:43:33.280 --> 3:43:37.200]  from a anthropology view what are they hiding go ahead
[3:43:37.200 --> 3:43:41.360]  well that that's silly for them because the the history of the world
[3:43:41.360 --> 3:43:44.800]  and of course you know there are there are many many groups in america now
[3:43:44.800 --> 3:43:49.520]  trying to return america uh to the the mexican
[3:43:49.520 --> 3:43:53.040]  pre-history days of the you know the Aztecs the Incas
[3:43:53.040 --> 3:43:59.280]  uh and horrible uh i call it wishcraft basically human sacrifice again
[3:43:59.280 --> 3:44:02.720]  uh at the pyramids uh down in mexico and and
[3:44:02.720 --> 3:44:07.440]  mesoamerica so uh this is this is very very strong people
[3:44:07.440 --> 3:44:12.560]  believe that this is a fringe group but in actual actuality wicca
[3:44:12.560 --> 3:44:17.040]  uh in all of the santeria stuff this is huge this is one of the fastest growing
[3:44:17.040 --> 3:44:20.800]  religions in the world and it all works together and they will
[3:44:20.800 --> 3:44:26.960]  even uh practice it to to deceive christians that
[3:44:26.960 --> 3:44:30.880]  they'll try to bring for example one of the uh
[3:44:30.880 --> 3:44:36.080]  one of the santeria goddesses uh is is called uh
[3:44:36.080 --> 3:44:38.960]  ocean uh let's see i think she's called yeah
[3:44:38.960 --> 3:44:44.560]  bamaya bamaya which really is mother mary
[3:44:44.560 --> 3:44:47.840]  of christianity with all the trappings though of these
[3:44:47.840 --> 3:44:53.440]  demon gods of santeria so this is how they try to even you know
[3:44:53.440 --> 3:44:58.480]  pollute christianity uh and this is well known uh as well
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:03.760]  but i want to emphasize that that many blacks are falling for this today
[3:45:03.760 --> 3:45:08.480]  because originally this came from africa from the congo
[3:45:08.480 --> 3:45:12.880]  from west africa from nigeria so we have a huge
[3:45:12.880 --> 3:45:17.520]  tangent of these foreigners i mean this is the ultimate alex and multiculturalism
[3:45:17.520 --> 3:45:21.600]  isn't it well it certainly is text and i'm
[3:45:21.600 --> 3:45:24.960]  trying to pull webster tarbly up live on air right now
[3:45:24.960 --> 3:45:28.800]  because i wanted to get him because the show's almost over here
[3:45:28.800 --> 3:45:34.640]  i wanted to get him to comment on what is in his book page eight
[3:45:34.640 --> 3:45:40.000]  about obama his self is much more likely a satanist of the
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:46.240]  apostate jeremiah right uh liberation theology school a christian
[3:45:46.240 --> 3:45:49.680]  heresy which places racial hatred instead of charity
[3:45:49.680 --> 3:45:54.720]  the center of its edifice of faith right is ultimately the high priest of a
[3:45:54.720 --> 3:45:58.400]  death cult obama is more precisely in uh
[3:45:58.400 --> 3:46:02.880]  existentialist fascist made of equal parts in 1969
[3:46:02.880 --> 3:46:06.880]  weatherman race war theory and and it just goes on
[3:46:06.880 --> 3:46:10.800]  to then talk about the bizarre voodoo stuff basically going on
[3:46:10.800 --> 3:46:14.400]  there at rites church so i just thought this was interesting that tarply
[3:46:14.400 --> 3:46:17.600]  wrote this book a year ago that we carry at info wars dot com and
[3:46:17.600 --> 3:46:21.600]  here it is manifesting in the news uh it's just incredible
[3:46:21.600 --> 3:46:25.280]  please continue with your comments well i i think that is interesting those
[3:46:25.280 --> 3:46:28.160]  comments by tarply i think he had quite a bit of
[3:46:28.160 --> 3:46:32.320]  insight now here's another little thread that we can go by
[3:46:32.320 --> 3:46:38.240]  abner mikba who is a well-known jewish lawyer out of chicago
[3:46:38.240 --> 3:46:41.600]  he was white house counsel now but here's a powerful man white house
[3:46:41.600 --> 3:46:44.880]  counsel the top lawyer for bill clinton during the
[3:46:44.880 --> 3:46:49.040]  monica lewinsky hearings but he was a big and he is a big
[3:46:49.040 --> 3:46:52.880]  mentor and supporter for many years of barack obama
[3:46:52.880 --> 3:46:56.560]  he says and this is in the chicago tribute
[3:46:56.560 --> 3:47:01.280]  back to chicago tribune dot com so we're talking about chicago's biggest
[3:47:01.280 --> 3:47:04.560]  newspaper and there was an article entitled
[3:47:04.560 --> 3:47:08.160]  barack obama america's first jewish
[3:47:08.160 --> 3:47:11.440]  president and it was because of his support from these
[3:47:11.440 --> 3:47:15.840]  millionaire and billionaire jews from chicago and overseas
[3:47:15.840 --> 3:47:21.280]  but mikba who was one of the supporters said that as a young man an aspiring
[3:47:21.280 --> 3:47:25.200]  young politician young barack obama came to him
[3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:29.120]  now remember this is in the chicago tribute and said how can i best get a
[3:47:29.120 --> 3:47:33.200]  head in politics and mikba who is jewish
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:37.120]  said to him the first thing you need to do barack
[3:47:37.120 --> 3:47:44.960]  is to go and join a powerful black church you need a power base
[3:47:44.960 --> 3:47:48.800]  and the way to do it is to go join a big black church
[3:47:48.800 --> 3:47:52.560]  okay text text we're we've been taking to the final segment here the show is
[3:47:52.560 --> 3:47:56.080]  almost over we have to have a part two on this because it's so important just
[3:47:56.080 --> 3:48:00.160]  for a minute and a half tarpoli because the show's about to end here
[3:48:00.160 --> 3:48:04.400]  in about 10 minutes webster tarpoli i just am always amazed how much you wrote
[3:48:04.400 --> 3:48:08.240]  or talked about ends up coming true or was correct text the same thing
[3:48:08.240 --> 3:48:12.000]  your unauthorized biography that people should get page eight
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:15.840]  you call him a satanist you get into weird stuff in your book
[3:48:15.840 --> 3:48:20.320]  on halloween voodoo stuff going on at
[3:48:20.320 --> 3:48:26.080]  Jeremiah Wright's church and now it's mainstream news they're doing voodoo
[3:48:26.080 --> 3:48:31.360]  in the white house obama comments on tarpoli comments on this obama situation
[3:48:31.360 --> 3:48:35.120]  well what i was trying to get out in that book barack h. obama the unauthorized
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:41.440]  biography is simply the question of is it possible to come to christ through
[3:48:41.440 --> 3:48:45.920]  Jeremiah right because that is what obama asserts he said i came to
[3:48:45.920 --> 3:48:49.200]  jesus christ through Jeremiah right now i would argue
[3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:53.120]  this is not easy to do because if you look at Jeremiah Wright this is
[3:48:53.120 --> 3:48:58.720]  essentially a minority radical school of theology it's the so-called black
[3:48:58.720 --> 3:49:02.400]  liberation theology set up by a fellow called james
[3:49:02.400 --> 3:49:08.480]  kohn and some others which essentially says that the entire christian story
[3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:13.520]  is limited to one ethnic group and uh... if you're not then uh...
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:16.400]  you're not part of that ethnic group then you're then you're not part of the
[3:49:16.400 --> 3:49:19.440]  uh... so it's a fundamental attack on christianity
[3:49:19.440 --> 3:49:22.960]  we're almost out of time here regardless specifically
[3:49:22.960 --> 3:49:26.080]  you talk about him though being more like a satanist
[3:49:26.080 --> 3:49:29.360]  and the weird stuff at the church is the church from your research
[3:49:29.360 --> 3:49:33.200]  a front for voodoo or san aria no i don't know anything about that part but
[3:49:33.200 --> 3:49:38.000]  what you see from kohn is he says that the the uh... the purpose the task of
[3:49:38.000 --> 3:49:42.400]  god and of christ is to assist in the
[3:49:42.400 --> 3:49:47.680]  suppression of the white population of the world which i think makes it
[3:49:47.680 --> 3:49:52.240]  therefore into a religion of hatred in effect and i believe this is all
[3:49:52.240 --> 3:49:56.960]  all subsidized by the foundation this is a theology of counterinsurgency
[3:49:56.960 --> 3:50:00.960]  the goal is to pit white against black and indeed other groups in this country
[3:50:00.960 --> 3:50:05.360]  all against themselves so the bankers in wall street never experienced a direct
[3:50:05.360 --> 3:50:09.840]  challenge to their rule and i think that's why the foundations pay
[3:50:09.840 --> 3:50:14.560]  right and pay uh... uh... people like white hopkins in that church and indeed
[3:50:14.560 --> 3:50:17.360]  kohn right these are so it's all about this nation it's all
[3:50:17.360 --> 3:50:20.960]  balkanization webster thanks for popping in with us i just wanted to
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:23.280]  get a comment on your book i think i like thank you
[3:50:23.280 --> 3:50:26.240]  thank you are going back to text we got a few minutes on the other side but
[3:50:26.240 --> 3:50:28.800]  basically he's saying the same thing you're saying
[3:50:28.800 --> 3:50:32.080]  tax from a completely different political angle
[3:50:32.080 --> 3:50:36.640]  oh oh absolutely so we can't say that that the united church of christ of the
[3:50:36.640 --> 3:50:39.920]  train united church christ is a voodoo santeria church
[3:50:39.920 --> 3:50:43.200]  but we can say that it is based on paganism
[3:50:43.200 --> 3:50:47.360]  african tribalism and really a worship of the black race
[3:50:47.360 --> 3:50:52.160]  it is a rather big church but they do do weird things on halloween there actually
[3:50:52.160 --> 3:50:56.240]  so i've heard that too yeah and of course they you know they don't have
[3:50:56.240 --> 3:51:00.480]  any problem in bringing in the catholic priest but then bluey

[3:55:48.880 --> 3:55:53.200]  all right Tex amazing interview i appreciate you coming on on short
[3:55:53.200 --> 3:55:56.480]  notice i can't imagine just at a base
[3:55:56.480 --> 3:56:00.480]  level looking at Haiti looking at Cuba looking at Nigeria
[3:56:00.480 --> 3:56:04.000]  voodoo is a horrible demon possession religion
[3:56:04.000 --> 3:56:08.080]  even if you don't believe in demons the mental illness that the self-invoking
[3:56:08.080 --> 3:56:13.280]  mental illness of going crazy and on all the superstition it turns out
[3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:15.680]  Obama's mother-in-law thinks somebody's put a
[3:56:15.680 --> 3:56:19.440]  hex on her i mean this is sewage in the streets
[3:56:19.440 --> 3:56:24.080]  chickens running around medicine men all this
[3:56:24.080 --> 3:56:27.440]  it's a black magic religion i mean i couldn't think of something more
[3:56:27.440 --> 3:56:31.600]  degenerate well it is degenerate and unfortunately it's a
[3:56:31.600 --> 3:56:35.120]  very dangerous religion and as i mentioned there are people who have
[3:56:35.120 --> 3:56:39.040]  been murdered uh... at the ritual uh...
[3:56:39.040 --> 3:56:43.280]  conducted by the santeria people uh... they're not even mentioned the the
[3:56:43.280 --> 3:56:47.040]  horror uh... of uh... animals you know dogs cats
[3:56:47.040 --> 3:56:50.000]  and particularly chickens and goats and all of these things
[3:56:50.000 --> 3:56:54.160]  so so i i think what about the charms obama carries
[3:56:54.160 --> 3:56:57.200]  but the charms of talismans all of these things
[3:56:57.200 --> 3:57:00.720]  are involved in every way this african tribalism
[3:57:00.720 --> 3:57:05.040]  uh... and unfortunately this taking hold it's been in america for a long
[3:57:05.040 --> 3:57:08.560]  time you remember even uh... desi ornés is very
[3:57:08.560 --> 3:57:11.040]  unfortunate the most lovable guy in the world
[3:57:11.040 --> 3:57:14.320]  when i love lucy but he would always play his drums
[3:57:14.320 --> 3:57:21.200]  and he would cry out babalu that's the name of one of the orishas the gods
[3:57:21.200 --> 3:57:25.280]  uh... of santeria he was calling on the devil god
[3:57:25.280 --> 3:57:29.120]  uh... and biographers have shown that desi ornés was an alcoholic
[3:57:29.120 --> 3:57:32.560]  and he attempted to get lucille ball into a form of
[3:57:32.560 --> 3:57:36.480]  satanic worship so so again we have a long
[3:57:36.480 --> 3:57:39.360]  train of this but now we have a man in the white house
[3:57:39.360 --> 3:57:42.960]  uh... who whose mother-in-law actually has conducted a
[3:57:42.960 --> 3:57:46.720]  evidently according to reports a a budu ritual
[3:57:46.720 --> 3:57:50.560]  that's basically what it is although santeria say oh we're not buduist
[3:57:50.560 --> 3:57:54.480]  but they are spirits devils talismans charms
[3:57:54.480 --> 3:57:58.560]  in the white house all right text thank you so much for
