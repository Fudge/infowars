[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:29.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:29.000 --> 00:42.000]  People do not seem to understand that so many people come to government knowing that they're not going to make the kind of money that they would make in the private sector.
[00:42.000 --> 00:51.000]  But they come to government to feed their souls, to help other people, to lift them up, to make their lives better.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  And that's you, and you, and you, and you.
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  And so, the state is God under the New World Order.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  You joined the priesthood and gave up everything because you wanted to feed your soul.
[01:04.000 --> 01:07.000]  You wanted to join with God.
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.000]  The New World Order is the state is God.
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  There are some people that do join government because they want to make a difference and help people.
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.000]  That is certainly true.
[01:16.000 --> 01:34.000]  But overall, the claim that the majority of people are doing it to, quote, feed their soul shows the sickening disconnect from an incredibly corrupt congressman who's been defending the IRS, persecuting the Tea Party, Christians, and libertarian and conservative groups.
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  He is a perennial abomination.
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  And I've seen the different metrics.
[01:40.000 --> 01:53.000]  In fact, we should do a story countering this, because I know the numbers are out there, I've seen it many times, that government workers, for the degrees they have, make more money than people in the private sector and have better benefits.
[01:53.000 --> 02:02.000]  So that's another lie that people in government make less than their counterparts in the private sector.
[02:02.000 --> 02:12.000]  Yes, on the high end, CEO type things, of course, the CEO makes more than say the head of the Justice Department, which is a major position over hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:12.000 --> 02:23.000]  But when you become the head of the Justice Department, when you leave it in four day years, you then get millions a year for another decade or longer on different boards.
[02:23.000 --> 02:37.000]  Or you get put on the board or made part owner of the naked body scanner company that makes four billion dollars in one year, and you personally get 20 something million dollars, like Chertoff, the head of Homeland Security, got.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  It was 23 million smackers he got.
[02:41.000 --> 02:50.000]  He made the order for the naked body scanners while the head of Homeland Security left and a year later got a nice payday.
[02:50.000 --> 03:00.000]  If that isn't a conflict of interest, if that isn't a revolving door, if that isn't a payoff, giving yourself the contract, I don't know what is.
[03:00.000 --> 03:14.000]  But now in government, that is basically ubiquitous stuff that people would get in trouble for a long time ago, they don't.
[03:14.000 --> 03:27.000]  So back 50 years ago, the media would not report on and people would not get in trouble if they were saying Congress for cheating on their wife or visiting a hooker, not saying that's good.
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  But that was an issue that affected the general population.
[03:31.000 --> 03:38.000]  If you got caught stealing, or you got caught giving yourself contracts, you would go to jail.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  Not anymore.
[03:40.000 --> 03:49.000]  But they will prosecute you if you're the governor in New York visiting a hooker.
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  See, that's like they went after Clinton for sex in the White House, and it's fine to cover that.
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  I mean, Clinton's a terrible guy.
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  He lied about it.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  I don't have sex with that woman.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  Drudge broke all that.
[04:01.000 --> 04:20.000]  But the only reason the media picked up on it is because they could burn him for that, but not get into Iridium satellite, and Laurel and Hughes, missile technology, and the Chinese, and cattle futures, and dead members of the cabinet like Vince Foster, on and on and on.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  Because the Republicans were knee-deep in that as well.
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  Ken Starr, the special prosecutor's law firm, was the big law firm for the Communist Chinese and the missile deals.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  You can believe that never got touched.
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  So this is the philosophy, the system they're using of control.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  CNBC anchors stunned.
[04:39.000 --> 04:40.000]  There is no economic recovery.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  That clip's coming up.
[04:44.000 --> 04:51.000]  We've got some new breaking news that we're codifying right now on the nuke, perhaps going off in Ukraine.
[04:51.000 --> 04:59.000]  Now there's film footage of folks filming it, and then their camera cuts out, which would be an EMP, and more.
[05:21.000 --> 05:33.000]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  Can you put two and two together?
[05:39.000 --> 05:47.000]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[05:47.000 --> 05:54.000]  For how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[05:54.000 --> 06:20.000]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.

[08:22.000 --> 08:42.000]  What you wish you just might get. You just might get a planetary world government run by psychopathic tyrants who believe they're going to merge with machines and become God.
[08:42.000 --> 08:48.000]  But only after they have exterminated the scourge from the face of the earth they call homo sapien sapien.
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  Yes, that sounds like the byline for a science fiction movie, but it's not. It's reality.
[08:55.000 --> 09:04.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this Wednesday, the 11th day of February 2015 worldwide transmission.
[09:04.000 --> 09:15.000]  I am now 41 years old. And the only thing I ask on my birthday is that no one wish me happy birthday and that we just move on from it.
[09:15.000 --> 09:26.000]  Just move on because, you know, I'm not upset I'm 41, but at the same time it is very interesting to see how fast life does go by.
[09:26.000 --> 09:34.000]  It just accelerates. As you get older, I'd always heard that from my parents and grandparents and great-grandparents.
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  And it's certainly true that when I was a little kid, I mean, it seemed like Christmas would take a million years to get there.
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.000]  Or my birthday would take a thousand years to get there. And sitting there in church would be incredibly boring.
[09:46.000 --> 09:55.000]  And two hours felt like 20 years. Well, now I just kind of enjoy something coming up in a month or two.
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  I enjoy it when I'm not in a hurry and it takes an hour for them to bring out the food at a restaurant.
[10:01.000 --> 10:17.000]  I enjoy just sitting on a dock fishing and letting the time go by as slowly as possible because however the brain works, it's years are going by like weeks went by when I was 10 years old.
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  And I guess it just goes faster and faster from here on out.
[10:21.000 --> 10:31.000]  But, you know, it's not just individually as we get older, things seem to move quicker. Technological developments are moving faster and faster.
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  Inventions are increasing. Technologies are integrating together faster and faster.
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  There are so many amazing opportunities in all of this, but let's not blink.
[10:41.000 --> 10:49.000]  And then our lives go by and we've had our whole culture, our whole civilization, our whole genetic code turned over to the technocrats.
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.000]  This is about free will in the final equation.
[10:53.000 --> 11:01.000]  Dan Kofol has a show out of Dallas. He's interviewed the Federal Reserve head there. He's done a really great job over the years.
[11:01.000 --> 11:12.000]  I'm a listener of the show. We're going to have Dan on with us for 30 minutes at the bottom of the hour to talk about a host of issues.
[11:12.000 --> 11:20.000]  We're going to be getting into global financial metrics and how those metrics tell the future. Greek exit from the EU, Russia and China both want the U.S.
[11:20.000 --> 11:32.000]  Materially weakened EMPs are a lose-lose dollar weakness, Baltic dry index, lowest it's ever been, oil demand dropping, great depression, food lines, now called EBT cards,
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  derivatives at risk over Greece, about $30 trillion enough to sink the world.
[11:37.000 --> 11:44.000]  And he's not a very alarmist guy. Those are pretty alarmist talking points he wants to go over today with us.
[11:44.000 --> 11:52.000]  And then Vani Hari, the food babe, has really broken into the big time and is now all over the news.
[11:52.000 --> 12:01.000]  General Mills has now capitulated and says they'll remove BHT from cereals and a bunch of other dangerous additives.
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  That's a major victory. I'd like to be able to buy General Mills cereal. I'm not a food snob here.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  I just don't want a bunch of GMO and a bunch of glyphosates.
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.000]  Also, companies are backing out of more and more milk that's connected to Monsanto and has glyphosate in it.
[12:17.000 --> 12:25.000]  I mean, there is a lot of positive stuff happening in what we've got left of a market where you can truly vote is in a free market.
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.000]  And that's why the globalists are at war with free markets while scapegoating capitalism.
[12:31.000 --> 12:45.000]  But Breyer's drops milk tainted with Monsanto's RBST.
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  Of course, that's the growth hormone. Another victory in the battle for proper health.
[12:50.000 --> 13:02.000]  How about for not having daughters that are eight feet tall and who go into puberty at age seven and who are having babies at 12 and then are dead of cancer at 36?
[13:02.000 --> 13:13.000]  Because if you look at the studies, that growth hormone, just like glyphosate, accelerates growth in tissues for whatever reason, especially in women.
[13:13.000 --> 13:21.000]  And that's why there's a phenomenon and you'll go to the mall or any public place. You'll see two parents that are obviously the biological parents of girls.
[13:21.000 --> 13:30.000]  They'll have a son there that's a little bit taller than them. They'll have a daughter that's like six and a half feet tall and the parents are five, 10, five, seven.
[13:30.000 --> 13:39.000]  And it's growth hormone. We are now 30 years plus into this synthetic growth hormone that is in the milk.
[13:39.000 --> 13:46.000]  And maybe you want to take growth hormone when you're 50. It's got risk associated with it, but it does make you look younger.
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.000]  I've seen the studies on that. But no, we're not talking about human identical growth hormone in low levels.
[13:52.000 --> 14:01.000]  We're talking about cheap, mass produced, bovine growth hormone in the milk. It's not good.
[14:01.000 --> 14:10.000]  When you want to accelerate aging, when you're old growth hormone, they can argue can slow aging or reverse it, but then it'll also grow cancers.
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  It's been connected to that. But you give it to somebody that's already fast growing already in the middle of their youth.
[14:16.000 --> 14:24.000]  You take anabolic steroids when you're 14 years old. It's going to start your growth and accelerate your aging and warp your organs, expand your heart.
[14:24.000 --> 14:33.000]  You take GH, ladies and gentlemen, bovine GH and other chemicals. When you are a teenager or going through puberty, you're going to be messed up.
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.000]  And that's why we got a country full of messed up looking people. And I'm not trying to be mean here.
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.000]  We're all messed up from the floor. I have the GMO. We're all kind of walking dead at one level or another.
[14:44.000 --> 14:50.000]  We can still fight back and stop it being done to the next generation.
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.000]  But that's what's going on. I mean, if you're wondering why your parents are both average height and you're a foot taller than them,
[14:55.000 --> 15:05.000]  well, you didn't have acromeglia naturally or the disease of giants.
[15:05.000 --> 15:15.000]  You were given it because they added growth hormone to the cattle so that they would produce double or triple the milk.
[15:15.000 --> 15:22.000]  And then you ended up drinking that in mass. In fact, we should probably even do another report on that. It's such a big deal.
[15:22.000 --> 15:30.000]  The companies are testing now for glyphosates in milk that bioaccumulate and then refusing it from suppliers that have it.
[15:30.000 --> 15:38.000]  They're now testing because you can't trust these companies to make sure they don't have the human equivalent bovine growth hormone.
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.000]  And they're now refusing that. I mean, every day we're seeing major companies make these announcements.
[15:44.000 --> 16:01.000]  There is a stampede in companies and food producers away from poison because you are checking the labels and voting with your dollars and a revolution is happening.
[16:01.000 --> 16:09.000]  And that's again, while the New World Order says competition is a sin and monopolies are king because they cannot allow things to be labeled.
[16:09.000 --> 16:18.000]  They cannot allow you to have a choice. They cannot allow you to be educated or it's over for them.
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.000]  Now, let me get into the other news. By the end of the show, the last 30 minutes, we should have this ready.
[16:24.000 --> 16:37.000]  I've got Rob Do doing a whole piece, getting the videos together, getting the English translations with Joe Biggs and getting the videos clipped together, the different videos.
[16:37.000 --> 16:46.000]  But there is video. We've been sent by listeners out of Ukraine. But again, it's in Ukrainian and Russian.
[16:46.000 --> 16:55.000]  But they're videotaping the explosion that appears to look like an atomic blast and the camera cuts out.
[16:55.000 --> 17:03.000]  And we've got other reports in Ukraine in newspapers that for miles around the power is off and electronics don't work.
[17:03.000 --> 17:12.000]  And it was CJ at the end of the show yesterday said, Alex, there's an easy way to know if this was really a tactical nuke or tactical A-bomb that went off.
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.000]  Because again, a lot of the tacticals tend to be just atomic.
[17:16.000 --> 17:27.000]  It's hydrogen or bigger and more complex. It tend to fail more. But that's a side issue. There'd be an EMP.
[17:27.000 --> 17:42.000]  I'm not a nuclear physicist. I've just read books written by him. But to understand what causes the EMP, it's that blast of electrons and radiation that goes out that you see first.
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  And then you see the mushroom cloud form. And you see that in this explosion that they claim is a chemical plant.
[17:48.000 --> 17:54.000]  Well, on Russian and Ukrainian television, we showed this yesterday, they show the supposed crater.
[17:54.000 --> 18:00.000]  There's no wreckage, no equipment. You see about two miles off what looks like to be a refinery.
[18:00.000 --> 18:08.000]  It looks like an oil and gas refinery. But you're talking about the woods here with blown over trees and a big black crater in the ground.
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  And there's somewhat of a news blackout on this.
[18:11.000 --> 18:23.000]  So I'm not saying an atomic bomb went off. I'm saying it looked like tactical nuke test I've seen on TV shows that I've watched over and over again like Trinity and Beyond with William Shatner.
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  That's all about nukes and a lot of other shows I've watched. I've always been fascinated with them.
[18:27.000 --> 18:33.000]  I mean, anybody fascinated with warfare or science would be and it just looks unlike any explosion I've ever seen.
[18:33.000 --> 18:40.000]  And this new footage, it looks just like a nuke. It's up closer and then the camera cuts out.
[18:40.000 --> 18:50.000]  So we've got the old footage we're going to get over here because they're over there. They've got it. The new footage and again, get to all of that.
[18:50.000 --> 19:04.000]  And the reason this is important is the Russians have said in state run media last year and this year that they would use tactical nuclear weapons if NATO armored columns or armored brigades.
[19:04.000 --> 19:19.000]  They said if brigade level weapons and we're talking about 4,000 men, 100 tanks, whatever the numbers are, if we see something like that, we see that as a major invasion, we're going to hit you with a tactical nuke.
[19:19.000 --> 19:28.000]  And we know that this Donetsk area is where a lot of the major battles have been going on. It would be a major signal to the West to back off.
[19:28.000 --> 19:37.000]  Now they did threaten on state run TV in 2008 to use tactical nukes on US forces in Georgia and NATO forces. That was on the news.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  Didn't get reported here, but it was all over the British and German and Russian news.
[19:41.000 --> 19:50.000]  So the Russians are threatening. So we have to look at these explosions and understand that if there was a tactical nuclear weapon used, we're not going to be told about it.
[19:50.000 --> 19:59.000]  It's a message between governments. This is starting to lean towards it could be an atomic device. This is big.
[19:59.000 --> 20:05.000]  It's no secret that government and big business buy and bulk and get huge discounts not available to the little guy until now.
[20:05.000 --> 20:12.000]  Introducing a breakthrough crowd buying website where people can join together buying bulk and get massive discounts on millions of popular products.

[21:51.000 --> 21:57.000]  That's SNAPFORCE.com.
[21:57.000 --> 22:07.000]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood and prevention of disease. Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[22:07.000 --> 22:15.000]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease and a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[22:15.000 --> 22:22.000]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product. I've taken away protein products for years and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[22:22.000 --> 22:29.000]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life. Within a few days of taking one world away, I noticed a dramatic change.
[22:29.000 --> 22:37.000]  Also, in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes. I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[22:37.000 --> 22:47.000]  But I've noticed in the past week or so, I'm not feeling bad anymore and the foot pain is gone. I'm just finishing up the five pound top I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more. I love your product. Thank you.
[23:07.000 --> 23:27.000]  We've got your back.
[23:27.000 --> 23:56.000]  Thank you.
[23:58.000 --> 24:09.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, we're here live.
[24:09.000 --> 24:28.000]  Retransmit it on many wonderful affiliates across this great republic and we have listeners throughout the world and viewers.
[24:28.000 --> 24:34.000]  So many stories here to get to. So many reports.
[24:34.000 --> 24:49.000]  Look at this little jewel. Elizabeth Warren opposes congressional meddling and audit the Fed bill. Oh, she's the darling that was going to crack down on the big mega bankers. She was the classy Hillary.
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.000]  It would appear the powers that be are getting nervous.
[24:54.000 --> 25:05.000]  So we're going to be breaking that down and playing that clip of the former head of the Federal Reserve saying they're above the law when Dan Cofall joins us.
[25:05.000 --> 25:23.000]  Those who have rigged the system know that it's a house of cards. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and Dave Craisler and it breaks down the fact that a lot of the elites are pulling their money out and heading for the hills.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  Here's another interesting little headline 90% of big pharma.
[25:26.000 --> 25:32.000]  Money spent on marketing then research.
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[25:36.000 --> 25:45.000]  Video of the day, John Oliver on pharma company marketing the doctors 70% of all Americans take at least one prescription medication.
[25:45.000 --> 25:52.000]  They want to make it mandatory through the new freedom initiative in public schools, the new freedom.
[25:52.000 --> 26:02.000]  But shifting gears, Brian Williams is out for six months. They hope you'll forget that he is a congenital liar about Katrina.
[26:02.000 --> 26:15.000]  And about the helicopter that he was in being shot down and then oh he was behind a helicopter that got shot down and then in front of a helicopter that got shot down and then he was right behind it and then he was never there and then it was an hour and a half.
[26:15.000 --> 26:25.000]  He is a lying scumbag. But he's not lying to us. I mean he did lie to us about guns and about Obamacare but I mean those are the big lies.
[26:25.000 --> 26:33.000]  Why are we mad at him lying about stolen heroics? Because it's something simple. It's something cut and dry.
[26:33.000 --> 26:44.000]  Like Gruber saying, you know what? It's good the American people are stupid and it's good that we were able to deceive them that Obamacare really increases their prices and has death panels.
[26:44.000 --> 26:53.000]  And then he laughs with the other academics. This is the attitude of these people but they still go too far. They're not invincible.
[26:53.000 --> 27:05.000]  But if Tom Brokaw and others want him fired which effectively they're starting to phase him out in a face-saving way with us out for six months then he'll be brought back with occasional reports, little side things.
[27:05.000 --> 27:16.000]  This is the end of Brian Williams. But then is it the end of Hillary Clinton who lied even bigger about being shot at on a trip to Bosnia?
[27:16.000 --> 27:28.000]  Or what about the Pentagon working with Bruckheimer to stage the heroic rescue of Private Lynch or the lies about Pat Tillman or the lies in American Sniper?
[27:28.000 --> 27:39.000]  I mean if we're mad at Brian Williams lying about being a hero, what about Chris Kyle lying about knocking out Jesse Ventura? I mean it isn't true.
[27:39.000 --> 27:50.000]  It's been found so in court and a bunch of this book is bulled. I love a story about a Texan being the toughest guy around, believe me.
[27:50.000 --> 27:58.000]  I know a lot of people that act and look and sound just like Chris Kyle. I'm sure Chris Kyle was a tough guy and a great shot and all these things.
[27:58.000 --> 28:07.000]  The point is is that his story is full of bull. And Pat Tillman wouldn't go along with the bull so they killed him.
[28:07.000 --> 28:13.000]  A bunch of Private Lynch's team wouldn't go along with it so they killed them. That's the point is they lie to us.
[28:13.000 --> 28:22.000]  So why are we so upset about Brian Williams? I can't stand Brian Williams. I can't stand his condescension.
[28:22.000 --> 28:31.000]  I can't stand his fake Boy Scout blue eyes when he stares at the camera and demonizes families and the Tea Party and the Second Amendment and basic liberty.
[28:31.000 --> 28:54.000]  Listen, I love seeing a lying sack of garbage like him fall. And it's certainly a good thing in the final equation to see people get in trouble for ball faced naked lies.
[28:54.000 --> 29:11.000]  But it needs to continue. It needs to expand. They need to go after other liars. Other people that create fables because the reason he was so comfortable and Hillary so comfortable and so many others are so comfortable to lie
[29:11.000 --> 29:20.000]  is because they have protected each other. They've gotten away with so much. Why not tell bigger and bigger and bigger lies?
[29:20.000 --> 29:36.000]  Now, here's the key to the whole thing. Why did Brian Williams fall? Because the military, who he tried to have on his TV show and say, join me in the lie, said, listen, buddy, you weren't there, you weren't in the crash helicopter, you're a liar.
[29:36.000 --> 29:46.000]  That's why. Because they wouldn't go along with his fraud, he's in trouble. You understand that? Again, good people in the system saying no is what will bring down these criminals.
[29:46.000 --> 29:55.000]  I'm telling you, Brian Williams is just the beginning. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:16.000 --> 30:23.000]  For thousands of years to promote health, we have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market,

[30:59.000 --> 31:06.000]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day. Big heart shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[31:06.000 --> 31:12.000]  Like we the patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment.
[31:12.000 --> 31:17.000]  I'm all about human potential. I'm all about the individual being empowered. The establishment is the opposite.
[31:17.000 --> 31:22.000]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen, and the rest of the garbage.
[31:22.000 --> 31:26.000]  Info Wars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[31:26.000 --> 31:31.000]  How we can come together and win the human race and celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month.

[31:58.000 --> 32:05.000]  What disaster is so powerful? It unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots.
[32:05.000 --> 32:14.000]  All at the same time, NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[32:14.000 --> 32:19.000]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S. population could perish.
[32:19.000 --> 32:25.000]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist. The world's economy will be wiped out.
[32:25.000 --> 32:29.000]  Mass riots will follow. Ancient diseases will reemerge.
[32:29.000 --> 32:33.000]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[32:33.000 --> 32:43.000]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones, and even your entire community when this worst-case scenario unravels.
[32:43.000 --> 32:48.000]  That's D-A-R-K-E-S-T-D-A-Y-S.I-N-F-O.

[32:55.000 --> 32:58.000]  Go to darkestays.info now.
[33:00.000 --> 33:05.000]  SAC, this is Crystal Palace. Sink no radders. Declare DEF CON 3. Scramble all alert aircraft.
[33:05.000 --> 33:08.000]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[33:09.000 --> 33:13.000]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War II.
[33:13.000 --> 33:18.000]  Target selection complete. Timeline target sequence complete.
[33:18.000 --> 33:25.000]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Pepper Pavalas, turning south out of North Cape, bearing 095 degrees.
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.000]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaska-Nair defense zone.
[33:30.000 --> 33:34.000]  From the front lines of the Information War.
[33:34.000 --> 33:39.000]  Flush the bombers. Get the subs in launch mode. We are at DEF CON 1.
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.000]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy? You bet!
[33:43.000 --> 33:48.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.000]  Three, two, one. Impact.
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  Shall we play a game? Tell about it.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  Global, thermal, nuclear.
[34:02.000 --> 34:09.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready, awaiting launch codes.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  We are in launch mode.
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.000]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[34:23.000 --> 34:24.000]  We're in.
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  I wish I didn't know about any of this. I wish I was like everybody else.
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome back to the Worldwide Broadcast.
[34:51.000 --> 34:57.000]  We have John McCain this week and last week calling for open US military forces backing NATO
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.000]  to engage the Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  I'm not Ukrainian. I'm not Russian, but I do know the history of the region.
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  Both sides have been killing each other for 500 years.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  The Russians have controlled Crimea for 500 years.
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  It's basically like Mexico trying to take Texas or something.
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  There are political interests that are basically running this country into the ground.
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.000]  Here's the headline, Elizabeth Warren opposes congressional meddling of audit the Fed bill.
[35:27.000 --> 35:33.000]  It would appear that the powers that be are getting nervous at zero hedge upon info wars.com.
[35:33.000 --> 35:39.000]  And joining us to cover the waterfront is Dan Kofol.
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  He's a talk show host out of Dallas.
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  I've been on his broadcast many times.
[35:43.000 --> 35:50.000]  He's been with us out there at our in the Fed rallies in Dallas to cover it for Dallas radio.
[35:50.000 --> 35:55.000]  And I wanted to get him on our broadcast today to look at the world economy
[35:55.000 --> 36:01.000]  and to break down from different angles what his sources are saying and what he thinks is coming as well.
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  Dan, thank you so much for coming on.
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  No, man. I appreciate the invitation, Alex. Thank you so much.
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.000]  Where do you want to go first? There's so much to get into.
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  Well, first, I just want to say that I've listened to you for years
[36:13.000 --> 36:19.000]  and that you do more good for the American people in your one show than all the rest of the media combined.
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  I know you don't like people just, you know, praising you like that, but it's true.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  I listened to you for years. Long story short, I got into radio in 2007.
[36:27.000 --> 36:33.000]  Great extent because of your show and what I had heard.
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.000]  A friend of mine is chief economist of the Federal Reserve.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  He and I would have lunch or argue back and forth.
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  I was so right. I only got so upset with me.
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  He said, I'm going to find a station to put you on.
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  And the rest was history.
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.000]  My specialty was always economics and what's going on in the world.
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.000]  So that's kind of involved. I have it all because of you.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  Well, Dan, please don't talk about me anymore.
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  I'm just glad that you and so many other people have been spurred because of this broadcast
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  and started on radio shows because I know you've gotten a pretty good ratings up there in Dallas,
[37:10.000 --> 37:16.000]  been on several different stations and we salute you for that work you're doing covering these issues.
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  Where do you want to go first?
[37:18.000 --> 37:23.000]  Because, I mean, obviously the economy is not as good as they're claiming.
[37:23.000 --> 37:28.000]  What is your view on the state of the U.S. and world economy in general?
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  Well, here's where I start out.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  And it's the fact that people talk about how the economy is recovering.
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.000]  They talk about all these wonderful numbers, employment numbers and everything.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  It's Rosie and none of it's Rosie.
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.000]  I believe you cannot possibly have a good analysis if you're working off of bad facts.
[37:44.000 --> 37:49.000]  We're intentionally being fed bad facts by the Federal Reserve, the BEA, the BLS.
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  All the people would give us these key numbers.
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  These numbers aren't anything of what they look like.
[37:56.000 --> 38:02.000]  The inflation numbers, it's impossible to assume there's a one and a half, two percent inflation number.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  I know you and I share a friend in John Williams at the shadow stats
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  and his numbers are spot on.
[38:09.000 --> 38:14.000]  So what you've got is you've got people in the investment world making decisions
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.000]  and they're developing their whole narrative off of horrible financial numbers.
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  So give me one in particular, Alex.
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  I know you were joking about this before the show.
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  It's something called the Baltic Dry Index.
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  It's such an obscure thing, but it's so meaningful to the whole world.
[38:29.000 --> 38:36.000]  It measures how many goods are being shipped back and forth between countries around the world.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  It has never been, never.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  This is almost 40 years this index has been around.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  It's never, ever been lower.
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.000]  That means never has there been less product moving around the world than there is right now.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  That's a horrifying number, but you don't see it anymore.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  Is that why the Chinese are selling steel at cheaper than it is to produce?
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  Yeah, and also another good indication is when you look at China
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  and the amount of electricity usage that they're using,
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  that's a very good indication of how strong an economy is
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  and their usage of electricity has been steadily declining, not growing.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  You can't have that growing economy.
[39:11.000 --> 39:16.000]  So what is the real state of the economy globally than in your view?
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  You touched on derivatives.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  I think the next conflict in this world,
[39:21.000 --> 39:27.000]  even though it looks horrible in Ukraine, nuclear weapons, maybe, maybe not,
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  it's the financial world where the next major conflict will occur.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  We talked about derivatives.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  There's somewhere between one and two quadruples,
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  which is about, you know what that is, it's $1,000 trillion in derivatives out there.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  $25 trillion roughly linked to the euro.
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.000]  $25 trillion roughly are linked to oil and gas.
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  If you have oil dropping to $20,
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.000]  you will effectively make roughly $25 trillion worth of derivatives.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  If Greece repudiated that,
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.000]  and if the EU will have effectively made the euro that's enough
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  so those derivatives become worthless,
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.000]  well, even $125 trillion,
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  and that roughly represents one-third of the world's total GDP.
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  Well, imagine, Alex, if you make $100,000 a year,
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  and that's your income, that's GDP.
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  So now imagine that all of a sudden,
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.000]  $20,000 out of that just disappears.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  Your life would change, everything would change,
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  and that's what the world is facing right now,
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  and it's the domino effect.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  I agree. I want to get into that, but your skype started deteriorating,
[40:42.000 --> 40:45.000]  so we're going to reconnect with you, Dan, right now up in Dallas,
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  we're here in Austin, Texas, if you just joined us.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  This is the Alex Jones show, and while we're reconnecting with Dan,
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  I'm going to air this clip.
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  CNBC anchors stunned.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  There is no economic recovery.
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  Investor launches into breathless rant
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  about real financial system.
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.000]  This is one of the chief financial strategists,
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  Rejudo, a managing director of MIZ,
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  UHO securities, which is a pretty big firm,
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  and this is not just him saying this, but John Williams,
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  the list goes on and on.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  They're all pretty much saying the same thing.
[41:23.000 --> 41:24.000]  Here is that clip.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  If you look at the domestic economic conditions,
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  I hear all this discussion about the U.S. economy accelerating.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  If you look at the GDP number that we're probably going to have
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  in the revised report for the fourth quarter,
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  combine that with the negative report in the first quarter.
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.000]  Average growth for all of 2014 is about 2.3%.
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  Fourth quarter over fourth quarter growth will be about 2.2%.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  That's really where the economy's been growing
[41:45.000 --> 41:46.000]  over the last five years.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  There is no acceleration in underlying economic activity.
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  Nominal GDP growth is running approximately around 4%
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  where it's been growing.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  Now, we've had a nice pick up in employment
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  in the last couple of months.
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  There's no doubt about that.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  That's squeezing productivity.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  The squeezing productivity is not going to be allowed to go on
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  very long by corporate America,
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  who needs very strong earnings to justify
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  the multiples that they're getting in the stock market.
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  So either we're going to have a decline in the earnings numbers,
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  or we're going to have multiples be maintained by stronger earnings,
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  which is going to mean a slowdown in employment going forward.
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  And I think that's really going to be the limiting factor on the Fed,
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  as well as the deflationary forces that are taking place overseas
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  that we could also import on a stronger dollar level.
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  All right.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  That's Steve Roshudo on CNBC.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  And then the anchors are stunned.
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.000]  You can watch the full clip.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  There's a couple more minutes left at infowars.com
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  and presidentplanet.com.
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  You dovetail this attitude with Elizabeth Warren,
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  who's opposing congressional, quote, meddling.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  Well, Congress controls the power of the purse.
[42:44.000 --> 42:50.000]  So shouldn't they be able to audit the so-called Federal Reserve?
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  What do you say about that, Dan?
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  Absolutely.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  The Federal Reserve is a one-man show.
[42:58.000 --> 42:59.000]  It's loyal to nobody.
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.000]  And never once, by the way, in the history of the Federal Reserve,
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  have they ever said America or Americans are their priority.
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  It's always been the banking system of America
[43:08.000 --> 43:11.000]  or the banking system of the world is their priority.
[43:11.000 --> 43:12.000]  They're not.
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.000]  We don't even exist on their list of priorities.
[43:16.000 --> 43:17.000]  Well, that's right.
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  And most of the banker bailout money ended up going to foreign banks.
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  And we could have given in the bailout $30,000 to every family in America.
[43:25.000 --> 43:26.000]  We would have had inflation,
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  but at least it would have done something for the economy
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  instead of just went into derivatives,
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  just sort of getting into the domino effect when you're skype cut out
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  of derivatives if they get triggered from your research.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  Some of you have a lot of top experts on your show
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  and you're a pretty smart guy on your own right.
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  How big are the derivatives overhang
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  and where do you expect the next bubble to pop?
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  Well, the derivatives overhang,
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  you can't really get an exact number.
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.000]  It's somewhere between one quadrillion and two quadrillion
[43:56.000 --> 44:02.000]  and roughly 25 trillion relate to oil and another 25 trillion relate to the euro.
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.000]  So if Greece pulls out of the EU,
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  that will significantly affect the euro
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.000]  and it could make $25 trillion of derivatives become worthless
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  and the other side make it come due.
[44:15.000 --> 44:16.000]  It's the same problem with oil.
[44:16.000 --> 44:21.000]  So we're right on the cusp of having something that is completely unmanageable
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  and yet you're hearing these rosy numbers
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  and it just isn't rosy.
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  You know, Dan, my grandmother's brother
[44:29.000 --> 44:34.000]  worked at the Dallas Federal Reserve once he got out of the Navy
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  and we would have debates about the Federal Reserve.
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  But before he died six, seven years ago, he listened to the show,
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  Uncle Billy and he said, a Billy Pope was his name.
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  He said, you know, you really are right about this
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  and a lot of people in the Federal Reserve were upset.
[44:47.000 --> 44:50.000]  So it's not just like the Federal Reserve's been monolithic the whole time.
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  I mean, it was a quasi-private banking group that took over in 1913
[44:54.000 --> 44:55.000]  with some robber barons.
[44:55.000 --> 44:59.000]  It's had some policies that were for the cabal, not the American people.
[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  But I think it's clear now there is a major split in the Federal Reserve
[45:03.000 --> 45:08.000]  with the head of the Dallas and Kansas City Fed becoming very, very critical of the New York Fed.
[45:08.000 --> 45:11.000]  So for folks that don't know the inside baseball,
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.000]  you know some of the folks pretty high level at the Federal Reserve.
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  What are they telling you and what's really going on?
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  Because, I mean, I looked at the history of the Federal Reserve.
[45:17.000 --> 45:23.000]  I've never seen these unprecedented statements by different Fed branches against the New York Fed.
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.000]  Well, my friend used to be chief economist for the entire Federal Reserve.
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  He happened to office out of Dallas.
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.000]  When he was with the Federal Reserve, he was this internal optimist.
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  GDP is right, inflation is right, everything is right.
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  And I would talk to him about things like the substitution effect
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  and all those things that are something that he had worked on personally and came up with,
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.000]  which was there to goose the GDP to make Alan Greenspan happy.
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  Because Greenspan's philosophy always was that GDP is understated
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  because we're more productive than we are.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  So Fed had to come up with a set of metrics that said,
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  oh, we really are more productive to justify Alan Greenspan's low interest rates
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  and high growth assumptions.
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.000]  When he was with the Federal Reserve, he had one set of opinions.
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.000]  When he left the Federal Reserve, he's still my close friend.
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.000]  He is so much, he's come so much more my way and your way
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  and the reality of what's happening out there.
[46:16.000 --> 46:20.000]  You know, you're inside looking out and you toe the company line.
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.000]  But smart guy, and I like him a lot.
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  And he's especially like him since he's now on our side.
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  Well, there's the Wall Street Journal.
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  A Fed insider calls for reform.
[46:29.000 --> 46:33.000]  Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, believes
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  there's too much power concentrated the New York Fed.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  That's an amazing statement from this year.
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  In fact, ladies and gentlemen, that's today, February 11th.
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  So, I mean, there's a major fissure in the power structure
[46:46.000 --> 46:51.000]  because a lot of these bankers, they like the power to issue unlimited currency
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  and to control that.
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.000]  But when it's done to bring in a world government
[46:56.000 --> 47:00.000]  that's parenthetically against a free society,
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.000]  I think this New World Order has gotten so mature now
[47:03.000 --> 47:08.000]  that people on the inside are being forced to make a choice which side they're going to be on.
[47:08.000 --> 47:13.000]  Can you give us any intel from your sources about how serious the in-fighting is in the Federal Reserve?
[47:13.000 --> 47:19.000]  I can't. That I don't get into because a lot of the folks I know inside wouldn't comment.
[47:19.000 --> 47:22.000]  My folks on the outside don't have a good perspective.
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.000]  But keep in mind, people's positions change all the time.
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  Dick Fisher's position changes.
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.000]  Dudley's position changes.
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.000]  They all fit into a story that looks current and there's some dissension,
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  but the dissension rotates. Sometimes they're positive, sometimes they're negative.
[47:37.000 --> 47:38.000]  I will say this.
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  When you've talked about this a lot on your show,
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.000]  the key to this world working right this very minute is the strength of the U.S. dollar.
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  Not that I think it should be stronger or weaker, but think about this.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  The U.S. has a printing press.
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  The U.S. can do whatever it wants to with the World Reserve currency.
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.000]  The U.S. has gone to war every time the dollar has been threatened.
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  We can just pick the latest three.
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  We have Iran, Iraq, and Libya.
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  They all threaten to create a gold-backed denar, a gold-backed currency.
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  Anybody that creates a gold-backed currency is going to pose a threat.
[48:11.000 --> 48:17.000]  And now the Russians are trying to create their own system based on petrol bricks or something,
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  and so that's why we're starting a war with Russia.
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  Well, bricks are, is Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  It's a coalition of those countries.
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  And now they've added many, many more countries to the coalition.
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.000]  The whole purpose of bricks was to trade among themselves and not have to use dollars.
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  They not have to convert to dollars first.
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.000]  It's very effective.
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  And the number of countries in Canada is involved in this.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  Mexico is involved in this.
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  As the dollar becomes less important in the world markets,
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  the U.S.'s significance becomes less important.
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  And that's what everybody wants.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  Everybody around the world wants the U.S. weakened but not dead.
[48:55.000 --> 49:01.000]  They want us to still consume, but they don't want us to be a blockade to their political strategies.
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  They just want us weakened.
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.000]  And I think the currency is the way that they will do it.
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  Sure.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  And the globalists are playing both sides.
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.000]  They're heavily invested in bricks and want to segue into that with a China-centered world system.
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  But China is so fundamentally weak when you look at their real numbers
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  that it just seems like a crazy plan they've cooked up.
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  I don't see it working.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  Well, and I've had a lot of close friends in finance that say the same thing.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  But think about China and Russia together.
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  Normally, they're mortal enemies.
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.000]  They're not mortal enemies right now.
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.000]  Russia has oil.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  China has production capacity.
[49:35.000 --> 49:36.000]  They have gold.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  Admittedly, both those economies are very weak.
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  But truth be told, the United States economy is weak.
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  And we're strapped with $18 trillion worth of debt that Russia doesn't have.
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.000]  So I mean, everything balances out, but Russia and China have created, through bricks,
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  they've created their own Federal Reserve system.
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  They've created their own SWIFT system, which is what we use to clear money
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  in essentially Western world finance.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  They've created their own system, which is parallel to everything in the West,
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  just so they don't have to be intimidated by the United States.
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  Well, sure.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  I mean, I don't romanticize the Russians and people,
[50:11.000 --> 50:17.000]  but the establishment running the United States and Europe has abused the dollar hegemony
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  and has really done some dangerous things
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  and is forcing the world to try to build a life raft because it's so scary what's happening.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  I mean, I think that's what's really going on.
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  Yeah.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  And once you get countries, think of this.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  Once you get countries trading between themselves,
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  let's say Brazil and India have to have commodities to trade,
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  what in the world should make them convert to dollars first
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  and without trading directly to commodities?
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  And if they trade a commodity for a currency,
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  why shouldn't they trade for the Brazilian real?
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  Exactly. Stay there, Mr. Kofol.
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  Yeah.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  Think about that, folks.
[50:51.000 --> 50:54.000]  The West is doing things that are going to kill the dollar,
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  but if you try to leave it, then they attack you.
[50:56.000 --> 51:19.000]  I mean, it's crazy.
[51:26.000 --> 51:35.000]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:57.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000]  We've got it.
[02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:05.000]  Thank you for coming to you.
[03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:09.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:15.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:19.000]  There's a lot of crazy stuff I didn't get to like this headline.
[03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  You may arm Hawaiian independence movement possible over to a response to U.S. Arming Taiwan.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  That's Bill Gertz reporting on that.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  The Washington Free Beacon stories on infowars.com. Kurt Nomell elaborates on it.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000]  I mean stuff's just getting twilight zone right now.
[03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:39.000]  Elizabeth in California, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  Hi Alex.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:45.000]  I ran across some astonishing information on YouTube regarding the Ukrainian explosion.
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  And I don't think it's received enough publicity and what it is is that about five hours after the explosion.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:58.000]  If you slow down the video during Madonna's Grammy performance, there's an image of a nuclear explosion.
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:02.000]  It looks like eerily like the images of the Ukrainian explosion.
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:06.000]  And I'm not saying that Americans are responsible for the explosion.
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  But for those of us researchers who are aware of the history of occultic and ritualistic aspects of the nuclear program,
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  it does appear that Western occultist may have been aware of this event in advance
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  and that Madonna's performance was part of the ritual.
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:26.000]  And I also don't think it was any coincidence that Annie Lennox saying I put a spell on you.
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:32.000]  Well, I mean that sounds crazy to a new listener, but the globalists do like to do big public rituals
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:35.000]  showing what they're going to do later. They believe it gives them more power.
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  They're really into it. It's ritualistic magic, lesser magics, what they call it.
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:44.000]  They do the lesser magic before the official event and stranger things have happened.
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  But I'll let the look into it. Thank you so much.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  There's no doubt every Super Bowl event I've seen for over a decade is an occultic ritual at halftime.
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  I mean it just goes on and on and on. The people running things are mentally ill.
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:04.000]  Mesha in Illinois, thanks for holding your own ear.
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:07.000]  Hi Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  I'm calling about a report I saw from Nevada and a local news station where the Nevada DMV was saying
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:24.000]  they were calling for a national ID to fly domestically.
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000]  Well, that's what our ID cards are.
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  And another coming out with a North American Hemisphere card.
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  Well, they already have it out, but they're saying they're going to basically do away with IDs.
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  State IDs are already federal IDs basically.
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:46.000]  But the TSA is just basically going to expand down and is expanding down to be basically political minders.
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  You'll have to go through them to get an authorization, even have an ID or to travel, period.
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000]  Had to have a driver's license, anything.
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:03:00.000]  That'll be the federal kind of janitorial level control freak system.
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  I also have another comment concerning, I don't want to change direction too quickly,
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:13.000]  but with the paranormal stuff you kind of mentioned earlier, everything is so sci-fi.
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:19.000]  You introduced me to Michael Aquino and I've read a lot of his writing on FIAPs.
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  I hid his book Mind War.
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  And I was doing research on him and his satanic temple is set, his church.
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  Yeah, what's wrong with having Army Sci-OP commanders that are running satanic ops?
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:37.000]  He's a good guy. Christian, helpful.
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:43.000]  And I was on his web center, fortunately, I didn't save the photo or the drawing.
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:49.000]  But when you're reporting earlier or before about the unregistered cell phone towers
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:56.000]  and how they have the same similar frequency to the human mind,
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:06.000]  there's a drawing with a demonic, like trans, you know, that demonic android.
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:09.000]  Go ahead and finish.
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:14.000]  It was a demonic transverse Rex, but it was also robotic and android,
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:20.000]  controlling a cell phone tower with a long serpent tongue.
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000]  Well, that's what good guys are into.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:26.000]  You know, he's a very helpful, loving individual.
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  I mean, sarcastic, of course.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  No, I mean, it's all about ending free will.
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:32.000]  That's what all the smart meters and all this garbage is about.
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:38.000]  I read DARPA, you know, it was in an article in a Maryland paper,
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:42.000]  The Baltimore Sun, like 16, 17 years ago, right on air a bunch saying,
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:46.000]  oh yeah, we are practicing with cell towers to put out waves to calm the public.
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000]  I mean, this is all going on.
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000]  We're living in a twilight zone.
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000]  Aaron, I'm sorry I'm out of time.
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:53.000]  Call back. I'll put you to the head of the line.
[03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:54.000]  God bless you all.
[03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:55.000]  Great job with the crew.
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:56.000]  Now we news tonight.
[03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:57.000]  7 o'clock Central.
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:20.000]  Press and Planner.TV.
