[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:40.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday. Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:45.000 --> 00:52.000]  The 14th day of December, 2012, and there is a reported school shooting in Connecticut,
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  one of the states that has their county and restrictions on gun ownership.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  Reportedly, right now, it looks like only the gunman is dead,
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  but the media will hype the living daylights out of this, so anytime somebody goes crazy,
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  the first thing pops in their head is go to a victim disarmament zone,
[01:11.000 --> 01:17.000]  a free fire zone where it's guaranteed no one is armed to protect themselves.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  You went and randomly went in people's houses in Texas,
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  more than 70% of people statistically on guns in the state, about 60% nationwide.
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  And, you know, if you just randomly went and kicked indoors and tried to, you know, shoot people,
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  you'd get shot in most homes.
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  But government training camps, you can bet nobody is going to be armed there
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  unless there happens to be a police officer out in the parking lot.
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  So we'll be looking at that. Also, obviously, the big news,
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  and Kurt Nemo has a story from our source, Jim Tucker,
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.000]  up at infowars.com.
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  Trilateral is discussed. Big war in the Middle East as Obama sends soldiers to Turkey.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  And here is the CNN report, U.S. to send troops, Patriot missiles to Turkey.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  The troops are already there. The Patriot missiles were already there.
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  They've been there for 22 months, helping get Al Qaeda trained and armed
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  and how to use shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  And that's all on record.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  And the ambassador there in Benghazi in the Al Qaeda command post worldwide is not Afghanistan.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  It is Benghazi in eastern Libya.
[02:24.000 --> 02:33.000]  He was there, of course, reportedly helping to transfer the missiles to Turkey.
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  And then he magically got killed when the local security chief, which is Al Qaeda,
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  came by and killed him.
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  And for eight hours, Obama ordered to stand down.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  Gee, what do you think is going on there?
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  They're getting rid of the evidence of what they've done,
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  because when they roll into phase two, after they bring down Syria,
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  they're going to launch terror attacks in Europe and the United States.
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  And then you know what's going to happen.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  You're going to learn to have the TSA search your vehicle on the highway.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  They've got them in place.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  It's ready for this, and they're going to be going down those pants.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  It's all an act of demoralizing and totally dominating you,
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  getting you ready for full martial law.
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.000]  So trilateral has discussed a big war in the Middle East as Obama sends soldiers to Turkey.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  And we've got the quote here from Tucker from his trilateral source.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  It could be the biggest war we've ever had over there.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  One was overheard saying, according to Tucker's report,
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  he's got some great sources inside trilateral, not just Bilderberg, because they're one and the same.
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.000]  And we're going to be breaking that down more here, obviously.
[03:35.000 --> 03:42.000]  Also, the really important is, I mean, much more important than a giant regional war and things like that.
[03:42.000 --> 03:49.000]  TSA calls bomb specialist on a wheelchair-bound 12-year-old girl with bone disorder.
[03:49.000 --> 03:50.000]  She cries.
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  His mommy has told she can't help her, but that is an important story.
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.000]  What is really, though, a lot more important than even that is Justin Bieber,
[03:59.000 --> 04:06.000]  kidnapped plot gang, wanted $2,500 per testicle.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  Per testicle, if you can even believe any of that.
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  So that's the really important top story in the United States today.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  We will have coming up a special report.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  We've worked on for several weeks off and on.
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  Aaron is in there as usual, putting the finishing touches on it.
[04:28.000 --> 04:35.000]  So it should be right about the second or third hour today on the fact that 2012 is a grand hoax.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  That is coming up.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  And we'll get into implementation of Obamacare now in beginning.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  Bloomberg reporting a doubling in the average premium you'll be paying monthly.
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.000]  Oh, free healthcare.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  How are you liking it?
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  And now all you people that are getting free healthcare through the state,
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  you're not going to get any of it now.
[04:56.000 --> 05:25.000]  I hope you enjoy yourselves.

[06:36.000 --> 06:42.000]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera
[06:42.000 --> 06:47.000]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[08:26.000 --> 08:44.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are joined by a special guest coming up in the second hour today.
[08:44.000 --> 08:56.000]  And we are going to be looking at the different operations that the globalist plan to run against this country,
[08:56.000 --> 09:10.000]  but make no mistake, this nation is in a process of being reeducated and being collectivized.
[09:10.000 --> 09:19.000]  NAFTA and GATT and Homeland Security and Northcom and the FEMA regions and the federalization of the government training camps,
[09:19.000 --> 09:28.000]  everything, the psychological brainwashing, drug encores, the psych warfare systems of the television.
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  It's all pointed at you and your family, and it's all meant to wreck civilization and society
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  so that a eugenics population reduction can be carried out openly.
[09:40.000 --> 09:49.000]  And we've seen the ambient background of the soft kill weaponry turned up against us and now the acceleration of that intensifying.
[09:49.000 --> 09:56.000]  But here is the good news that I want to get across to everybody today.
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  By taking the red pill and just looking at what is admitted and facing those facts,
[10:03.000 --> 10:11.000]  we have a chance, we have a good shot of turning this around because there is not just the evil
[10:11.000 --> 10:20.000]  million mile long historical undead snake of tyranny that is slithering forward,
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  but there's also other paths in human development.
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  In fact, I wrote some notes on this subject this morning when I was reflective.
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  There are competing forces is the best way to say it.
[10:33.000 --> 10:42.000]  There are competing forces in this world and I will say that I have taken the red pill to quite an extent.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  You know, you think you are enlightened, you think you're informed,
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.000]  then you just learn even more and the rabbit hole goes that much deeper.
[10:50.000 --> 11:01.000]  And it is extremely sobering and also extremely painful isn't even the word.
[11:01.000 --> 11:17.000]  I am now experiencing thought processes and understandings that are giving me emotions that I've never felt before.
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  And the reason I talk about myself in this context is that we need to look through that lens
[11:22.000 --> 11:34.000]  so that you can examine yourself and really have it hit home that wow, man, we've really been accurate.
[11:34.000 --> 11:43.000]  We've really assessed who the globalist are and the fact that no matter how radical and wild I sound,
[11:43.000 --> 11:56.000]  the reality of what the establishment is doing is so much worse.
[11:56.000 --> 12:04.000]  The closest this feeling that is more and more dominating me, the closest I can describe it,
[12:04.000 --> 12:15.000]  is that a few times I've been really hurt bad out in the middle of nowhere and a limb is broken
[12:15.000 --> 12:26.000]  or a finger is chopped off or you're helping friends that are mangled.
[12:26.000 --> 12:34.000]  Is that cold focused understanding of we've got to do something about this.
[12:34.000 --> 12:41.000]  We've got to just hold it together and stay focused and there's going to be light at the end of the tunnel.
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  And if you have that understanding, because that's the beginning of the feeling,
[12:46.000 --> 12:53.000]  not just the feeling, the mindset, the horizon to horizon view, then you see the general public
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.000]  and you can't even laugh at them anymore. You can't even have a subconscious feeling of elitism
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  because they're so pathetic and well, you know what's going on.
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  It's far deeper than that because you realize that you're connected to these people
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.000]  and that there's a feedback loop from them that you live around them
[13:15.000 --> 13:21.000]  and your children are going to grow up with them and that their children are going to grow up around them
[13:21.000 --> 13:32.000]  and that when the establishment, the social engineers are hurting humanity
[13:32.000 --> 13:39.000]  and dumbing humanity down so they're more easily managed and so no new power structures develop
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  that might challenge the current power structure.
[13:42.000 --> 13:52.000]  You see that the evil the globalists are engaged in against humanity is blowing back on them
[13:52.000 --> 14:00.000]  and then that becomes a feedback loop and the evil just intensifies and intensifies
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  and that these globalists think they're getting ahead in the game because they're cheating.
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  They're studying human psychology, they're studying how their species works
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  and then lying to themselves and saying they're a different species
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  and that's what they say in their own literature and they're all cold-blooded
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  and they are scientifically carrying out this operation
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  but the truth is when you study the top globalist technocrats themselves,
[14:27.000 --> 14:33.000]  they're egomaniacs on power trips who love the raw exercise of power
[14:33.000 --> 14:40.000]  but who coldly do it on the surface and try to impress each other about how cold they are
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  when the truth is they're not cold at all
[14:45.000 --> 14:52.000]  because if you really get past ego and pull back and coldly and scientifically look at this
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.000]  our species really has some beautiful attributes to it
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.000]  some beautiful facets to it and some great potential.
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.000]  We can reach for the stars or we can fall into absolute bedlam and hell on earth
[15:10.000 --> 15:19.000]  and just to realize that the ugliness and the fall of our species has just begun
[15:19.000 --> 15:28.000]  and to come to the realization that for the majority of people they're already gone
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  from birth they were programmed by television
[15:32.000 --> 15:42.000]  from birth they were brought up to be shallow, insecure, vain, empty husk
[15:42.000 --> 15:51.000]  and to see how pathetic and sad they are is a reflection of the fact that I'm pathetic and weak
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  and it is a horror story to sit there and look at it
[15:55.000 --> 16:03.000]  because when I look at the innocence of my children and their creativity and their poetry and their purity
[16:03.000 --> 16:10.000]  and then I know that this world is already poisoning them and already hurting them
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.000]  and then I know that humans tend to slouch towards destruction and ugliness
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  without a focused force trying to amplify that
[16:20.000 --> 16:28.000]  and to know the system is trying to hurt beauty and goodness and wholesomeness
[16:28.000 --> 16:34.000]  is such a vomitous paradox because the evil is bad enough
[16:34.000 --> 16:41.000]  but then when you see all the good and the potential of humanity set next to it
[16:41.000 --> 16:47.000]  and you no longer even have hatred of evil but a recoiling disgust of it
[16:47.000 --> 16:54.000]  the evil in myself that I can't eradicate
[16:54.000 --> 17:00.000]  and then I want to forge a system to defeat the globalist
[17:00.000 --> 17:07.000]  and I want to be able to build something to resist them
[17:07.000 --> 17:16.000]  but then I've got to be in the world and work within the world to even be able to operate
[17:16.000 --> 17:22.000]  and that itself is corrupting
[17:22.000 --> 17:28.000]  I look at the general public now and they're like children
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.000]  spoiled, arrogant but really scared children and it's just torture
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.000]  I mean once you figure out globalist manipulations
[17:37.000 --> 17:43.000]  I can read a book put out by the globalist to promote something they're doing
[17:43.000 --> 17:48.000]  and before I turn the page I know what it's going to say
[17:48.000 --> 17:54.000]  because I've heard them say it a thousand times a hundred different ways
[17:54.000 --> 18:01.000]  and you're like oh I'm going to turn the page and I know exactly what they're going to say
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  and then I'm going to turn the next page and I know not the plot
[18:05.000 --> 18:13.000]  that's easy to guess I know what they're going to impart
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  you know there's a lot of news here that needs to be gone over
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.000]  and listen I'm not trying to be negative here
[18:21.000 --> 18:30.000]  what I'm trying to do is to really get over to people that Nazi Germany was a nightmare
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.000]  the Soviet system was a nightmare
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  the communist Chinese system was and is a nightmare
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.000]  and the world is plunging back into something like that
[18:42.000 --> 18:47.000]  but mixed with all sorts of nightmare high-tech systems
[18:47.000 --> 18:56.000]  and when you really come to grips with the fact that world government in this system is shut up
[18:56.000 --> 19:05.000]  so that really wicked abusive people can hurt beautiful people
[19:05.000 --> 19:11.000]  and burn things and kill people and mutate the environment
[19:11.000 --> 19:18.000]  and mutate the genetics of the world's biosphere
[19:18.000 --> 19:23.000]  it's just off the chart that it's all real and that we've been right
[19:23.000 --> 19:29.000]  and it's the sickening realization
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  it's the sickening realization
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  and to know how it's all going to unfold to see where it leads
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  to know where it goes
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  is so sad
[19:43.000 --> 19:48.000]  and to wish that I could reach all these children
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  these adults these childlike scared little shallow people
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  who have such great potential
[19:56.000 --> 20:21.000]  but who have been ruined from birth with programming

[23:54.500 --> 23:57.660]  Merry Christmas from mypatriotsupply.com.
[23:57.660 --> 24:15.620]  Coming up, I'm going to talk about divide and conquer, and how the media is going into
[24:15.620 --> 24:32.860]  it. Overdrive right now to create racial division, and the new Quentin Tarantino movie that is the most pernicious use of the N-word ever,
[24:32.860 --> 24:36.260]  and how the system ties all that in together for control.
[24:36.260 --> 24:53.020]  I want to really describe what the term racism stands for, and then we are also going to get into some of the latest abuses by the TSA.
[24:53.020 --> 24:55.940]  You know, sometimes I wouldn't even call it getting depressed.
[24:55.940 --> 25:04.580]  Sometimes I do get down, though, because I'm supposed to just go on and go watch the nutcracker,
[25:04.580 --> 25:11.260]  you know, with the family, and I'm supposed to, you know, go fishing with the kids, and
[25:11.260 --> 25:17.300]  I'm supposed to, and I want to just go on about my business on the radio and make some
[25:17.300 --> 25:25.020]  jokes sometimes and have some fun, because that's what I do as a real person.
[25:25.020 --> 25:36.100]  But meanwhile, meanwhile, Obama continues to have torture sites all over the world,
[25:36.100 --> 25:39.540]  and he's been caught doing it.
[25:39.540 --> 25:46.860]  And it's admitted that they grab innocent people and then rape them, because that's
[25:46.860 --> 25:53.140]  what the people that work at the CIA in interrogation like to do.
[25:53.140 --> 25:55.940]  And the torture's illegal, so is the raping.
[25:55.940 --> 25:59.140]  They just do it, and nobody gets in trouble.
[25:59.140 --> 26:04.540]  And the police taser people to make them answer questions when the Fifth Amendment clearly
[26:04.540 --> 26:13.260]  states you can't be compelled to talk, and they are announcing the, quote, smart meters
[26:13.260 --> 26:19.900]  going in everywhere, increasing power bills on people, sometimes threefold, and tracking
[26:19.900 --> 26:27.460]  everything you do in your house wirelessly, and the government controlling what the temperature
[26:27.460 --> 26:28.460]  in your home is.
[26:28.460 --> 26:33.540]  I mean, that's beyond 1984, along with the televisions.
[26:33.540 --> 26:44.900]  In fact, there's an infowars.com article out today about Samsung TVs can be hacked.
[26:44.900 --> 26:50.220]  Among televisions can, quote, be hacked and can listen and watch you.
[26:50.220 --> 26:52.540]  Well, of course, they can be hacked.
[26:52.540 --> 27:00.380]  They're designed with a backdoor under global technology regulations to watch and track
[27:00.380 --> 27:02.220]  everything you do.
[27:02.220 --> 27:07.780]  There's the headline, Samsung TVs can be hacked to spy on viewers.
[27:07.780 --> 27:12.620]  Security firm exposes dangers of so-called smart products.
[27:12.620 --> 27:18.660]  You know, when I hear the term smart, it'd be like saying, hey, cancer is no longer a
[27:18.660 --> 27:19.660]  problem.
[27:19.660 --> 27:20.660]  We call it smart.
[27:20.660 --> 27:25.660]  It's like calling the Patriot Act, patriotic, or a government program to drug half the school
[27:25.660 --> 27:30.020]  kids, new freedom initiative.
[27:30.020 --> 27:31.300]  But Hitler being okay, guys?
[27:31.300 --> 27:34.740]  We just called him smart, or gonorrhea wouldn't be a problem.
[27:34.740 --> 27:35.740]  Hey, it's smart.
[27:35.740 --> 27:39.220]  You know, when you hear something smart, you better run the other way.
[27:39.220 --> 27:43.220]  Smart growth means the globalists come in and decide you can't use your property so
[27:43.220 --> 27:45.660]  their property doubles in value.
[27:45.660 --> 27:47.100]  Means slavery.
[27:47.100 --> 27:50.180]  Smart means slavery when the globalists attach it to something.
[27:50.180 --> 27:52.300]  It means it's surveilling you.
[27:52.300 --> 27:59.900]  It means it's a drone sitting in your house watching you, recording you, and the entire
[27:59.900 --> 28:09.580]  architecture of the entire global system was premeditatedly designed 40 years ago when
[28:09.580 --> 28:13.540]  DARPA developed all this to be a control system.
[28:13.540 --> 28:18.100]  And you know, we need to be upset about that.
[28:18.100 --> 28:23.340]  We need to be upset about the fact that Obama said he was against the NDAA when his people
[28:23.340 --> 28:26.860]  wrote it, and then he said he wouldn't sign it, so there wouldn't be opposition to it,
[28:26.860 --> 28:31.620]  and then he did sign it, kind of like he said he was going to legalize marijuana when the
[28:31.620 --> 28:36.740]  states legalized it, and then he tripled the number of raids in states like California.
[28:36.740 --> 28:37.740]  That's been in the LA Times.
[28:37.740 --> 28:43.740]  Well, now he's talking to ABC News, and he says, we've got bigger fish to fry.
[28:43.740 --> 28:48.540]  He went on to say it's not our top priority going after recreational users in states that
[28:48.540 --> 28:54.980]  determined that it's legal in 18 states where it's been made legal.
[28:54.980 --> 29:00.100]  Let's see, they're actually still doing all the raids.
[29:00.100 --> 29:04.620]  So the answer, he says, it's not states fry, it's no, no, I got bigger fish to fry.
[29:04.620 --> 29:10.820]  Yeah, you got bigger fish to fry, Bubba, like the announcements by the top insurance companies
[29:10.820 --> 29:16.220]  this last week, and I covered yesterday at a Bloomberg and AP, of the average premium
[29:16.220 --> 29:19.260]  on insurance doubling.
[29:19.260 --> 29:25.700]  We've already gone up over 20%, just an anticipation, now doubling, which is designed to bankrupt
[29:25.700 --> 29:28.100]  healthcare and bankrupt the American people.
[29:28.100 --> 29:33.300]  This is the forced collectivization as the globalists have done in every other country
[29:33.300 --> 29:40.140]  of one seventh of our economy, and now the healthcare's government run to take away your
[29:40.140 --> 29:44.900]  care, but then also force vaccines on you, and they're now announcing all that.
[29:44.900 --> 30:00.780]  So we've got to get upset and get out of our coma, we'll talk about when we come back.
[30:00.780 --> 30:05.580]  If you've ever wanted to be able to produce boiling hot water anytime, anywhere with absolutely
[30:05.580 --> 30:09.580]  no power whatsoever, then this is going to be the most important message you'll ever
[30:09.580 --> 30:10.580]  hear.

[32:01.860 --> 32:06.340]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[32:06.340 --> 32:11.380]  storm, the most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst
[32:11.380 --> 32:16.580]  drought in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[32:16.580 --> 32:19.860]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[32:19.860 --> 32:24.140]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from EatFoodsDirect and I recommend you do
[32:24.140 --> 32:25.140]  the same.

[33:04.300 --> 33:14.900]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.900 --> 33:23.780]  Let me briefly break down my definition of what racism is and then I'll get into some
[33:23.780 --> 33:28.540]  military news, some economy news and we're going to go to your phone calls.
[33:28.540 --> 33:39.540]  The toll-free number to join us on this Friday edition is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[33:39.540 --> 33:45.480]  More and more democratic politicians and operatives have been calling for beating up or arresting
[33:45.480 --> 33:50.300]  anyone that doesn't want the United States to be collectivized.
[33:50.300 --> 33:54.940]  When I wanted to get Larry Grafwall, the FBI informant, who was in the weathermen meetings
[33:54.940 --> 34:00.180]  with Mr. Ayers and others, when they talked about how they'd put 50 million Americans
[34:00.180 --> 34:05.860]  in forced labor camps once they collectivized the country and then kill half of the 50 million,
[34:05.860 --> 34:11.060]  25 million people, I thought we'd tie that into Belafonte's statements about just arrest
[34:11.060 --> 34:16.500]  people like a third-world dictator and throw those of us that don't agree into prison.
[34:16.500 --> 34:26.180]  That is coming up also the healthcare issue, 15 states are opting out or only 15 states
[34:26.180 --> 34:30.180]  are opting in to run Obamacare exchanges.
[34:30.180 --> 34:38.340]  The other 35 are just saying they can't even do it, the government's not even providing
[34:38.340 --> 34:42.660]  systems to them and see that's exactly what all our experts broke down, they were planning
[34:42.660 --> 34:46.460]  because we've seen this done in third-world countries and in other countries that globalists
[34:46.460 --> 34:53.460]  take over, they set it up, show it bankrupts the old system and then there's a bigger
[34:53.460 --> 34:58.500]  crisis and then they just fully socialize the healthcare because the big dream is government
[34:58.500 --> 35:02.140]  wants to decide what care you're going to get and then say, oh, well, it's all collectivized,
[35:02.140 --> 35:06.180]  we're all paying for each other even though you pay for your own insurance, well, we're
[35:06.180 --> 35:10.260]  going to control what you eat now and by the way, you can't get medical care if you haven't
[35:10.260 --> 35:14.260]  taken all the vaccines, see, that's now being announced, that's why they're just given
[35:14.260 --> 35:18.420]  school kids shots without parental consent now all over the country, it's totally illegal,
[35:18.420 --> 35:24.060]  they don't care, it's illegal when the TSA drags your wife off to a private room and
[35:24.060 --> 35:30.740]  pulls her pants off, but they do it, you see, because it's about the raw exercise of power.
[35:30.740 --> 35:37.940]  Now they've got this new Quentin Tarantino movie coming out, Django, with the sophomoric,
[35:37.940 --> 35:45.780]  you know, decadent, near-collapse, imperial, you know, type of stuff that you would expect
[35:45.780 --> 35:54.140]  to see Quentin Tarantino involved in, I know he lives here in Austin, he was at an event
[35:54.140 --> 35:59.180]  once he was at an upside issue, I'm not going to get off into the story.
[35:59.180 --> 36:09.100]  The point is, is that the movie is meant to invoke the same thing Machete did, where every
[36:09.100 --> 36:14.620]  white person is a racist piece of garbage and the illegal aliens are all angels and white
[36:14.620 --> 36:20.140]  people line up Hispanic women who are pregnant and shoot them with high-powered rifles, splattering
[36:20.140 --> 36:26.860]  babies out of their guts, meanwhile, conservatives actually want to stop abortion and understand
[36:26.860 --> 36:30.860]  the globalist are using the immigrants to come in and get on welfare to bankrupt the
[36:30.860 --> 36:33.020]  country and drive down wages.
[36:33.020 --> 36:38.660]  Well, put out by the same, you know, movie house, you know, the same production team,
[36:38.660 --> 36:45.980]  they come out with Django, where, as Jamie Foxx has said, I kill a lot of white people,
[36:45.980 --> 36:46.980]  isn't that great?
[36:46.980 --> 36:48.900]  That's a quote.
[36:48.900 --> 36:53.460]  And the plot is out there on the web, you know, what the movie does, and it's basically
[36:53.460 --> 36:58.260]  every white person is an absolute piece of garbage that gets killed.
[36:58.260 --> 37:02.860]  And so it creates kind of this cartoon history of what was really going on in the South and
[37:02.860 --> 37:11.780]  the Southwest and just, you know, reaffirms the propaganda that's put out, because most
[37:11.780 --> 37:15.060]  of the public, they can't find their state capitol, most of the public doesn't even
[37:15.060 --> 37:22.020]  know what the Civil War was, so it provides kind of a cartoon pulp fiction version.
[37:22.020 --> 37:27.420]  So the Drudge Report runs the headline off of another story pointing out that it has
[37:27.420 --> 37:33.540]  the most inwards ever used in a movie and is meant to create racial division.
[37:33.540 --> 37:41.780]  And the Daily Beast comes out and says, a dignitarious aggregator, Matt Drudge, go too
[37:41.780 --> 37:45.540]  far when he used the inword repeatedly.
[37:45.540 --> 37:49.660]  He used it in a headline yesterday.
[37:49.660 --> 37:52.500]  And then they go over it and say, oh, yes, it's very horrible.
[37:52.500 --> 37:53.700]  This is the type of racism.
[37:53.700 --> 37:56.020]  And you're like, well, that doesn't make any sense.
[37:56.020 --> 38:09.300]  He was quoting the movie and a report about how Jango Review, most extreme or promiscuous
[38:09.300 --> 38:14.220]  use of the inword ever heard in a mainstream movie.
[38:14.220 --> 38:17.500]  That was out of EW Entertainment Weekly.
[38:17.500 --> 38:28.700]  So he quotes the article, links to it, pointing out that they use it over and over again,
[38:28.700 --> 38:30.340]  and he's the bad man.
[38:30.340 --> 38:31.340]  See how that works?
[38:31.340 --> 38:37.580]  See, when Jamie Foxx comes out and says, yeah, I kill a lot of white people, isn't that great?
[38:37.580 --> 38:38.900]  All of that is great.
[38:38.900 --> 38:39.900]  That's a wonderful thing.
[38:39.900 --> 38:44.460]  See, this is what racism has been turned into.
[38:44.460 --> 38:46.900]  It's called tribalism.
[38:46.900 --> 38:53.820]  And if you go anywhere in Africa, and there's, say, a river, and there's a tribe right across
[38:53.820 --> 38:58.460]  the river that genetically is basically identical to the tribe across the river, it doesn't
[38:58.460 --> 38:59.460]  matter.
[38:59.460 --> 39:04.740]  They fight over mining rights and fishing rights and farming rights, and there have been gang
[39:04.740 --> 39:09.020]  fights between them, and so they hate each other and kill each other.
[39:09.020 --> 39:13.580]  And you can go to the Middle East and find Shiites and Sunnis for 700 years killing
[39:13.580 --> 39:16.500]  each other, and they're genetically the same people.
[39:16.500 --> 39:21.220]  Or you could go to the clans of Scotland, going back hundreds of years ago and right
[39:21.220 --> 39:25.780]  through to today, getting in fights and killing each other, even though genetically they look
[39:25.780 --> 39:32.340]  just like each other, have the same culture, but humans like to fight with each other.
[39:32.340 --> 39:37.540]  So it's called tribalism, and one group will always use the fact that another group looks
[39:37.540 --> 39:43.860]  different to take them over and enslave them.
[39:43.860 --> 39:50.380]  It's popular in Newsweek, Time Magazine, MPR, to make fun of anybody in the South and say
[39:50.380 --> 39:55.540]  we're stupid and dumb and ride horses to work and that we're idiots.
[39:55.540 --> 39:59.260]  And that's done just because it's popular and it's a form of tribalism that is seen
[39:59.260 --> 40:00.540]  as okay.
[40:00.540 --> 40:05.460]  I never really grew up hearing a lot of this, but I guess there's like the, you know, the
[40:05.460 --> 40:11.540]  Pace Picante ads where they say, you know, where's this sauce from, this hot sauce?
[40:11.540 --> 40:15.180]  Well, New York, New York City, get a rope.
[40:15.180 --> 40:25.460]  So a lot of it's just campy, you know, vestigial echoes of tribalism, but my point is a lot
[40:25.460 --> 40:28.540]  of times it's about religion or it's about tribe.
[40:28.540 --> 40:30.060]  It's not even about race.
[40:30.060 --> 40:39.260]  So to call things racism is really a modern invention only used the last 150 years or
[40:39.260 --> 40:40.260]  so.
[40:40.260 --> 40:47.740]  See, all it is is tribalism, like our tribe, the Brits, going back, you know, 600, 700,
[40:47.740 --> 40:56.340]  800 years ago, depending on which conflict, you know, we're going to take over the Scots
[40:56.340 --> 41:04.540]  or we're going to take over the Welsh or you could have the Normans out of France who
[41:04.540 --> 41:09.820]  were really Northern Europeans that had conquered France who were really Vikings and who came
[41:09.820 --> 41:15.100]  over 800 years ago and conquered everybody who was in England and had been conquered
[41:15.100 --> 41:19.580]  by the British or the Brits.
[41:19.580 --> 41:24.420]  But again, the average person wouldn't even know any of this basic history.
[41:24.420 --> 41:34.700]  And the Normans said they were superior and that the Anglo-Saxons were dogs and scum and
[41:34.700 --> 41:40.220]  ugly and spiritually deserved to be enslaved and it was all just an excuse so they could
[41:40.220 --> 41:47.460]  dominate them and take them over and not give regular human rights to them that the
[41:47.460 --> 41:51.580]  Norman themselves would want.
[41:51.580 --> 41:57.100]  So when you have the liberation theology in the last 60 years put out by the Ford, Rockefeller
[41:57.100 --> 42:02.620]  and Carnegie foundations by the CIA, this has all come out in the church committee hearings
[42:02.620 --> 42:09.980]  and others on the tax-free foundations, they said we're going to teach whites not to have
[42:09.980 --> 42:10.980]  tribalism.
[42:10.980 --> 42:18.060]  And again, you can say it's good, you can say it's bad, whites on average were stratified
[42:18.060 --> 42:23.100]  where the whites at the country club didn't associate with any of the white people and
[42:23.100 --> 42:24.580]  called them white trash.
[42:24.580 --> 42:28.580]  And then you had the religious snobs who didn't associate with the Methodists because they
[42:28.580 --> 42:33.260]  were Baptist and the Baptist didn't associate with the Methodists because they were vice
[42:33.260 --> 42:37.020]  versa or the Catholics didn't associate with the on and on and on.
[42:37.020 --> 42:43.380]  It's all just snobbery, exclusivity, humans break down into that.
[42:43.380 --> 42:47.060]  So the globalists come along 60 years ago, this one really intensified and said we're
[42:47.060 --> 42:52.700]  going to end all of this racism.
[42:52.700 --> 43:01.300]  And really what they're saying is we're going to end exclusivity and domination through
[43:01.300 --> 43:06.820]  class and create a classless society.
[43:06.820 --> 43:13.380]  Now they were addressing at a barbaric level wrongs that were going on in tribalism along
[43:13.380 --> 43:14.380]  racial lines.
[43:14.380 --> 43:19.980]  And so that is wrong, but from the globalist cold-blooded perspective they weren't trying
[43:19.980 --> 43:27.980]  to get rid of a tribalism to create some ecumenical utopian view.
[43:27.980 --> 43:37.100]  They were seeking simply to break down classes so that they could all be put into a homogenized
[43:37.100 --> 43:44.260]  plastic eugenics-based culture to destroy the family itself regardless of what color
[43:44.260 --> 43:51.420]  you were, so that you could be rendered down and dumbed down to the level of animals so
[43:51.420 --> 43:55.100]  that you could not resist their scientific conquest.
[43:55.100 --> 44:00.260]  You understand what I'm saying?
[44:00.260 --> 44:02.620]  And so it's purely a weapon.
[44:02.620 --> 44:09.420]  Whites are brought up to be these not-need, shaking, insecure, filled with guilt, loathing
[44:09.420 --> 44:11.340]  themselves with self-hate.
[44:11.340 --> 44:20.900]  Believe me, racism in white people is just unbelievably rare.
[44:20.900 --> 44:29.380]  What is not rare is people so insecure around other groups that they won't hire other people
[44:29.380 --> 44:32.340]  just because they're so scared they may do something wrong.
[44:32.340 --> 44:34.020]  You understand what I'm saying?
[44:34.020 --> 44:36.820]  But that's actually what the globalists want is the division.
[44:36.820 --> 44:42.300]  You see, out of their false multiculturalism, they say, well, the Hispanics could be in
[44:42.300 --> 44:44.180]  something called the race.
[44:44.180 --> 44:45.500]  For those in the race, everything.
[44:45.500 --> 44:47.380]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[44:47.380 --> 44:55.740]  That's the Mechaloraza slogans, I mean, that's literal Ku Klux Klan slogan, just reversed
[44:55.740 --> 44:56.820]  for Hispanics.
[44:56.820 --> 45:03.060]  But the media and all the Fortune 500, they fund that as a tool of control to be able
[45:03.060 --> 45:08.460]  to have racial leaders over those groups so the people won't value an identification
[45:08.460 --> 45:13.660]  with private property or guns or the right to defense or the right to religion because
[45:13.660 --> 45:17.740]  they're afraid we would all get together for the right of religion, the right of self-defense,
[45:17.740 --> 45:18.740]  the right of private property.
[45:18.740 --> 45:19.740]  No, no, no.
[45:19.740 --> 45:23.140]  The only right is now to the racial heritage.
[45:23.140 --> 45:27.620]  And then once, if someone goes along with a racial heritage, you can then attach taking
[45:27.620 --> 45:34.500]  guns, shutting down society as long as you dangle the racial tribalism in front of them.
[45:34.500 --> 45:38.420]  That's the same thing where you have all the big black rappers and all the big black actors
[45:38.420 --> 45:43.940]  come out and say, whites are scum, blacks are God, we're going to kill you and then
[45:43.940 --> 45:53.780]  have the anointed white trendy cool person sit there and clap and then all the whites
[45:53.780 --> 45:59.940]  go, that's how I'm cool is saying, whites are scum, let's kill them.
[45:59.940 --> 46:04.660]  You understand how that works.
[46:04.660 --> 46:08.380]  And it's all scientifically done.
[46:08.380 --> 46:14.020]  It's all, and then if you report on it, you're a racist.
[46:14.020 --> 46:19.780]  So it just boils it down to where there's double standards for a tribalism where the
[46:19.780 --> 46:23.340]  government does this, listen to me carefully.
[46:23.340 --> 46:29.140]  The central social engineers, they come in as whites get scarier and scarier and then
[46:29.140 --> 46:37.340]  vote for more police, more control and support, wink, wink, a real tribalism now to arrest
[46:37.340 --> 46:43.740]  those dangerous criminals, code word for Hispanics and blacks, who were then put into prisons
[46:43.740 --> 46:50.780]  set up according to racial gangs to get a four, five, 10 year diploma in criminality
[46:50.780 --> 46:56.820]  to come back out to actually keep those groups in criminal substratum.
[46:56.820 --> 47:02.860]  Now the whites are brought in as an inner party to serve out of fear the government
[47:02.860 --> 47:09.260]  that they see will protect them while at the same time the government is actually radicalizing
[47:09.260 --> 47:19.620]  blacks, Hispanics and others through the MTV warfare systems.
[47:19.620 --> 47:27.260]  So to boil it all down, racism is simply a political tool that is hyped and pushed by
[47:27.260 --> 47:34.300]  the government and the media to create more division, but to also be selectively enforced
[47:34.300 --> 47:37.660]  and to be used to restrict the First Amendment.
[47:37.660 --> 47:42.660]  Just as Europe has gotten rid of free speech, you get arrested if you say a racial slur,
[47:42.660 --> 47:47.620]  and now they've got it down to saying if you criticize open borders, that's racism and
[47:47.620 --> 47:49.620]  so you're arrested.
[47:49.620 --> 47:55.940]  You're arrested in Europe now, in France, in Germany, in England, you name it.
[47:55.940 --> 47:58.340]  But it's okay because it's politically correct.
[47:58.340 --> 48:03.940]  And then now you hear Harry Belafonte saying, hey, Obama, you know, maybe he needs to just
[48:03.940 --> 48:07.940]  arrest like a third world dictator, people that disagree with him.
[48:07.940 --> 48:11.780]  You see, and then you get into it.
[48:11.780 --> 48:12.780]  It's amazing.
[48:12.780 --> 48:14.620]  By the way, we got some bad news.
[48:14.620 --> 48:21.620]  They were first reporting that they'd shot the shooter, and now it looks like at least
[48:21.620 --> 48:32.500]  one child killed and some others wounded, and the shooter is the father of the student.
[48:32.500 --> 48:36.900]  You know, I like Christmas trees and I like Christmas, but I don't like the big commercial
[48:36.900 --> 48:40.940]  stress and everybody's so stressed out, and I could just feel the bad vibes during the
[48:40.940 --> 48:44.860]  holidays.
[48:44.860 --> 48:52.220]  27 dead, okay, this is, oh my God, and you notice that CBS News, you notice they kept
[48:52.220 --> 48:57.140]  this, you notice they kept this quiet for a long time with it cordoned off, always
[48:57.140 --> 48:59.100]  a bad sign like Columbine.
[48:59.100 --> 49:05.620]  If that CBS News headline is right, you notice this is happening right as the second term
[49:05.620 --> 49:09.780]  comes in, and Obama has said even if Congress doesn't act, he's going to physically try
[49:09.780 --> 49:17.620]  to take all handguns and rifles, and they're saying that this is handguns, holy Toledo.
[49:17.620 --> 49:22.700]  You know, I told my wife this morning, I said, I'm feeling so much dread.
[49:22.700 --> 49:25.860]  I said, I have never felt in my gut, in my spirit.
[49:25.860 --> 49:31.620]  We put that back on screen, please, I want to read that to people, and they are really
[49:31.620 --> 49:37.860]  going to use this, and I'm sure there'll be the usual signs that it may be staged if
[49:37.860 --> 49:42.420]  not, it's been copycat promoted by the media and then the Galbion Prozac are one of those
[49:42.420 --> 49:43.420]  derivatives.
[49:43.420 --> 49:53.380]  27 dead, including 14 children in elementary school shooting, oh sweet Lord, God please
[49:53.380 --> 49:54.380]  heal this land.
[49:54.380 --> 50:00.380]  CBS News was reporting 27 people are dead, including 14 students after a shooting at
[50:00.380 --> 50:02.820]  the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.
[50:02.820 --> 50:09.180]  The gunman is among the dead, CBS News, John Miller reports there is a preliminary information,
[50:09.180 --> 50:16.020]  the gunman was the father of one of the students, Miller also says that at least a couple dozen
[50:16.020 --> 50:21.180]  people were shot, the shooter was killed and apparently he had two guns, a person with
[50:21.180 --> 50:25.780]  knowledge of the shooting said, the person spoke of a condition of anonymity because
[50:25.780 --> 50:30.340]  the investigation was still underway, it is not known whether the shooter took his own
[50:30.340 --> 50:38.940]  life or was killed, two students said the teacher were also injured in the shooting,
[50:38.940 --> 50:46.860]  they were taken to Danesbury Hospital spokesman Diane Burke said, it was an orderly evacuation
[50:46.860 --> 50:51.380]  given the circumstances, why didn't somebody have a gun in the school, why don't they arm
[50:51.380 --> 50:56.500]  the teachers, nope, the gunman always go to the victim disarmament zone, they're going
[50:56.500 --> 51:00.580]  to come after our guns folks, get ready, stay with us.

[54:26.660 --> 54:31.940]  We pull up just department numbers, I'm going to have Curt Nemo and Don Salazar repost those
[54:31.940 --> 54:37.540]  under a link to the CBS News.
[54:37.540 --> 54:46.100]  They are now saying 27 dead and including 14 children at the elementary school.
[54:46.100 --> 54:51.380]  I know Connecticut has some pretty strict gun laws.
[54:51.380 --> 54:56.580]  We are just a very sick society, we've aborted 53 million babies now, I'm always using the
[54:56.580 --> 55:02.700]  50 million number it's grown and we make troops serve 5, 6, 7 turrets until they break down
[55:02.700 --> 55:10.420]  and so many people now are on Prozac type drugs that they admit in their own trials caused
[55:10.420 --> 55:17.660]  a, what was it, in the Eli Lilly trials in 1980, a 15-fold increase in suicide and violent
[55:17.660 --> 55:18.660]  outbreaks.
[55:18.660 --> 55:21.540]  In fact, it's on the inserts now.
[55:21.540 --> 55:25.460]  They were forced about a decade ago as you know to put in the inserts of all the serotonin
[55:25.460 --> 55:31.420]  reuptake inhibitors and I don't think I've ever seen a mass shooting that wasn't staged
[55:31.420 --> 55:38.340]  where the person wasn't hopped up on those drugs and this could be real with all the
[55:38.340 --> 55:40.540]  culture of death and people being in on it.
[55:40.540 --> 55:46.340]  But if we start seeing telltale signs that being staged, we'll let you know it has come
[55:46.340 --> 55:55.100]  out that it was a government program and that person was in a mind control program and the
[55:55.100 --> 55:59.700]  doctor he was under was a head Air Force mind control doctor and he was involved in DARPA
[55:59.700 --> 56:06.020]  brain interface programs and told people he was under mind control in the jail.
[56:06.020 --> 56:12.620]  So Fyodor Krozynski, the unabomber, was a part of MKUltra, that's LA Times.
[56:12.620 --> 56:17.580]  So see once you've seen this a few dozen times over and over again and you notice the timing
[56:17.580 --> 56:22.860]  of it all and the fact that the gun culture is the one area we're beating them and if
[56:22.860 --> 56:25.740]  we beat them in any area they fail.
[56:25.740 --> 56:31.860]  If despite all their propaganda people know the government wants our guns to enslave us
[56:31.860 --> 56:35.940]  and people now want guns because of the crazies and the violent people that are out there
[56:35.940 --> 56:39.860]  because you know you're good and you have a right to protect yourself.
[56:39.860 --> 56:44.300]  But Obama has signaled that he may use executive orders as he's done in other areas outside
[56:44.300 --> 56:53.340]  of Congress to physically ban handguns and rifles that are semi-auto and that will start
[56:53.340 --> 56:54.340]  a civil war.
[56:54.340 --> 56:59.620]  Not everybody's going to turn them in and I've had a feeling of dread.
[56:59.620 --> 57:03.100]  Before the shooting even started I talked to my wife this morning and I said I'm staying
[57:03.100 --> 57:07.060]  at the start of the show but this had already begun, we thought only the gunman was dead
[57:07.060 --> 57:11.300]  then that I'm always honest with you.
[57:11.300 --> 57:14.340]  I never tell the crew this every once in a while, the day before they had the fake bin
[57:14.340 --> 57:20.340]  laden raid I said I have a really bad feeling of dread and always something big happens
[57:20.340 --> 57:27.420]  and it's probably something so big, you know they've got troops massing US troops they're
[57:27.420 --> 57:31.460]  now announcing publicly massing in Turkey on the Syrian border, they're talking about
[57:31.460 --> 57:36.420]  bombing campaigns that they call peaceful but nobody will show that when they kill a
[57:36.420 --> 57:41.060]  bunch of innocent Syrians, they'll only trot out these 14 dead kids, it'll probably be
[57:41.060 --> 57:49.060]  more now if they're preliminary saying 14 dead children, 27 dead total and they're going
[57:49.060 --> 57:55.260]  to come after our guns so I moved our guest pack 30 minutes so I'll start going to your
[57:55.260 --> 58:01.500]  calls as soon as we start the next hour, hearing about one moment but that's another reason
[58:01.500 --> 58:05.460]  I would never have my children and I know they've set it up where it's hard to not have
[58:05.460 --> 58:09.500]  your kids in government training camp but I wouldn't have my children in public schools
[58:09.500 --> 58:14.860]  because they're advertised everywhere as the place to go when you want to commit suicide
[58:14.860 --> 58:20.340]  that well don't commit suicide you know go to a school and kill a bunch of people and
[58:20.340 --> 58:26.740]  then these spoiled brat you know people almost always on psychotropic drugs they go and throw
[58:26.740 --> 58:32.380]  a fit and they kill one person and they throw a fit they just start killing killing killing
[58:32.380 --> 58:37.100]  and under the new Soviet model I'm supposed to be punished because there's crazy people
[58:37.100 --> 58:51.060]  out there and turn my guns in this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:15.300]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:24.860]  now live from Austin Texas alex jones listen I've got the phone lines loaded with people
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:32.580]  from Connecticut CBS News is reporting 27 dead 14 children I don't know if that's accurate
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:39.380]  I pray to heavenly father it's not AP just out is saying the shooter dead in one teacher
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:46.900]  so we'll continue to try to follow all of this as it unfolds again we can put that CBS
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:52.780]  News headline back up there CBS News 27 dead including 14 children elementary school just
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:58.660]  absolutely horrible and public schools and other victim disarmament zones are advertised
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:06.860]  as a place for prozac heads to go kill a bunch of people and we're you always see this stuff
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:12.660]  uptick in the holidays so much stress so much pressure so many people drug down their minds
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:20.580]  all the more reason that we be armed to protect ourselves let's go ahead and talk to john in
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:27.180]  Connecticut he's got some information john what do you have for us sir I just been following
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:33.020]  our mind and what I was going to bring up with something you already addressed and that was
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:39.300]  you know the possibility of being a staged act and what james home saying that he was
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:46.300]  an insuring candidate you know people like these who are doing these shootings being
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:51.940]  put in place by some agency or the government to promote the gun grab or keep the public
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:59.660]  in fear because this is happening like every weekend and it's going to be escalating you
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:06.420]  know to have happen more and more frequently well I know this sir there when they stage
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:09.900]  these things we know Columbine was staged we need to go back and do a whole article on
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:14.940]  how they reported four different gunmen there was 127 bombs in the building half the school
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.820]  is empty there was a stand down there were government mind control programs connected
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:26.420]  to both of the youth they were both on drugs the riddlin prozac touched both but now the
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.820]  Atlantic wire is reporting there was also reports of a second shooter who may be at
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:37.380]  large so it's always that same report the current also said there are unconfirmed reports
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:45.260]  of two shooters one dead and one at large so and again there can be false reports of
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:51.500]  that too except you know when somebody else opens the door when when smoke grenades get
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:57.500]  thrown from both sides when the you know the people are in government programs and when
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:02.580]  the police order stand down so shooters can go longer if all these normal telltale signs
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:07.340]  start coming out regardless the White House is going to use this to go after our guns
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:15.020]  you can absolutely bet it and man people people know that's why they're out buying
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:22.020]  guns and record levels anything else John I was just going to say as soon as I saw that
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:29.740]  I knew the next thing was going to be promoting a gun grabber or taking the people's guns
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:38.180]  and before you talked about the Oklahoma City bombing how all the children in the daycare
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:43.500]  were killed like when this happens at a school it only promotes the public it only gets the
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:49.580]  public to support the gun grab even more when they see that their kids are in danger well
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:53.540]  yeah you turn your kids over and then the school takes them off and gives them abortions and
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:59.980]  gives them shots without your consent and it's just just an insane sick culture and it is
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:05.780]  a violent prone degenerating culture too but I mean it's too late people aren't turning
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:11.380]  their guns in the globalists aren't going to stop that so they want to be able to stage
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:16.180]  big terror attacks and blame it on domestic groups and go around and arrest all of us
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:19.620]  I mean they said that Harry Bellafonte said that they're all saying it and they're just
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:25.340]  not going to get away with it and see they hate the fact that they know their paramilitary
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:32.020]  police would have big attrition and wouldn't be able to carry it out so they hate it their
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:36.220]  control freaks now they are able like like Obama said he's got bigger fish to fry they
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:41.340]  can butcher the dollar gut the pensions run the country on the rocks bankrupt the nation
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:46.700]  shut down the power plants ship all the jobs they can with taxpayer money overseas so they're
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:50.980]  that you know they're hurting the country as best they can they just really want to put
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:55.100]  us in those forced labor camps and really upset them they can't get that job done they
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:05:00.620]  really want to have their way with us in those.

[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:27.740]  large salary as a graduate student to be part of the program and they reported people letting
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:33.060]  him in to do it he told people in the jail that he was under mind control basically
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:38.380]  didn't remember anything and the police said oh no he was never around anybody for them
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:42.620]  to be able to hear that when the first reports they admitted that the inmates were getting

[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:10.940]  got the telltale signs here CBS News reporting that there were reportedly two shooters seen
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:19.740]  and the Atlantic wire is also reporting that and I'll have another once we know more tonight
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:28.100]  I'll do a special report on info wars nightly news about this you know I don't get into
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:37.620]  mumbo jumbo I don't get into you know psychics and stuff like that I think only about five
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:45.740]  times in seventeen years on air have I had the type of dread I told my wife last night
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:53.100]  and this morning I said I am having feelings of extreme dread and not physical dread for
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:11:02.700]  myself that our whole country is on the edge of a cliff our whole world is and you know
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:10.940]  in my life I've had you know I'm walking out of a store and I'm like why do I have this
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:17.620]  feeling of dread because it's always right when I have it and I'm like I'm in danger
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:21.660]  don't walk out of the store and I walk out of the store and somebody comes up and mugs
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:27.940]  me you know that happened and I told my wife last night this morning I just said I am just
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:31.980]  I am just having horrible feelings of dread right now back before I went when we only
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.500]  thought it was one teacher shot you know at the start of the show I said I just I just
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:45.420]  have horrible feeling and I was telling my wife I said maybe it's the US troops massing
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:55.420]  outside of Syria that they're announcing and I said maybe it's you know maybe it's
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:02.260]  that US to send troops patriot missiles to Turkey the new American is reporting that
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:09.500]  3,000 US troops have been secretly sent back to Iraq you know the whole world is on the
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:17.780]  edge of major conflict but but you know the reason my gut my spider since we've all got
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:25.020]  it is going off is that if I have to put a finger on it folks it's just like I said
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:31.100]  it's the realization of how real all this is I'm gonna go to your phone calls Obama
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:37.340]  has signaled the NRA has reported to their credit last year you know they talked about
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:41.580]  it also this year that their sources and now Obama has signaled this in the debates that
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:50.540]  he may ban all semi-autos physically holding them he may ban all semi-autos handguns rifles
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:55.580]  that's most firearms well that will they announced last year they were gonna ban 60% of shotguns
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:01.220]  roughly that that are bottom loaded that are that are pump even pump not even semi-auto
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:07.540]  if if they could be converted to take a clip or to be converted to semi-auto they were
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:11.580]  gonna ban them and the ATF said it's just a regulation we're having a public comment
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:15.500]  period but Congress said hey you can't do that so they backed off Congress did their
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:20.420]  job rarely but they did it because you know they the ATF just can't say we're taking your
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:26.260]  guns because we say we interpret policy this way but Obama has said that he may use street
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:35.100]  sweeper language that is law and apply that to all semi-autos and folks you can absolutely
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:41.740]  guarantee there will be a civil war a death sentence to the police and military and citizens
[01:13:41.740 --> 01:14:00.540]  if they give this order which may be the plan and I am gonna be honest I actually oh man
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:07.700]  anyways they're getting ready to make some big moves you can guarantee that not just
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:13.060]  intellectually or geopolitically looking at all this I meant my gut has never gone off
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:21.620]  this bad just pray for this country folks pray for pray for America I know we're not perfect
[01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:25.460]  there's still a lot of good people in this country and we just had more time we could
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:29.940]  maybe turn things around if everybody wasn't in a self-fulfilling prophecy and you got
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:35.780]  December 21st coming up and maybe I'm just picking up on everybody else's dread and
[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:40.000]  all the uncertainty in the world and all things that are happening I just are you feeling
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.500]  it out there all right we've got a bunch of people holding who want to talk about what's
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:50.340]  happening let's go to Kevin and Connecticut on the shootings he's got some points go
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:55.620]  ahead sir what's your what's your take on this well I personally witnessed some really
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:00.900]  weird stuff going on today we just happened to plan here at work like a little Christmas
[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:05.980]  outing we were all going to go bowling so we went to Brookfield lanes which is you know
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:10.940]  the next town we pull in Alex and there's four school buses there and we're like what's
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:16.940]  going on we walk in it's wall to wall high school students from Newtown high school they
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:21.540]  bust all those kids out of there I don't know when they arrive but I find it very odd that
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:26.820]  this shooting goes down and they bust all those kids out of the high school so they were
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:31.900]  already there so they limited the number of people that were on site number two you look
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:39.260]  at the specific because more than half the school was not there at Columbine 127 bombs
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:44.140]  were planted there were multiple shooters all that came out but but it was later so
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:48.380]  people don't know that was a government operation so much evidence and on time to go into it
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:54.620]  people don't want to research again now now if you have things like the school officials
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:59.700]  and people not there their kids not there that's telltale but but but we don't these
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:04.220]  are things to look for from past operations you know if the guy had been in the military
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:08.220]  if he'd been assigned to government psychiatrist another big deal but but but we don't know
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:12.540]  this yet we we're getting reports of multiple shooters what are you saying that that that
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:17.420]  children had already been bust not from this elementary but from the high school before
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:22.580]  this happened and we were there before 10 o'clock in the morning and the children were
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:29.780]  already in the bowling alley bowling so they had trucked all those kids bust all those kids
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:34.020]  at a new town high school this morning and brought them to the bowling alley and and
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:37.900]  then to make matters worse if you look at all the news reports they show the kids lined
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:42.580]  up with the hands on each other's shoulders and a big line there was reported two shooters
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:47.460]  at first it was going through the school system my boss why work for his wife works in the
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:53.380]  Danbury schools right next to the major city in the area and they had a rumor going through
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:57.460]  that there were two shooters they were dressed as guns they hid the guns under their habits
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:01.580]  and then there was one shooter loose running around right here where I'm sitting right
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:07.180]  now trying to find them and why in God's name would you put half your almost all of your
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:11.500]  high school kids sitting in a bowling alley and the other ones all wind up to be picked
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:16.140]  off if you got a shooter out there that's already tell you how they do it and the Russians
[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:20.180]  have been caught doing this too in mass shootings I mean they've been caught in these line that
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:23.820]  we said it was a government on later it came out that it was a government off but nobody
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:27.380]  got in trouble and like they caught the Russian government blowing up their own apartment buildings
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:31.900]  and these governments do this but the Russians have been caught doing it what you do is you
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:40.340]  send in one drugged up person dress the same and then your people go in and shoot everybody
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:45.100]  and then you but you have the video of that other guy who thinks they're part of a drill
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:49.820]  and that's why they can use these school shooting drills where they're unannounced or they come
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:53.540]  in and scare everybody with guns and say remember they've had them where they say we're the
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:58.500]  militia against public school that's usually the federal drill and the schools get in trouble
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:04.180]  with parents and they say well we were just going with with you know the federal guidelines
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:08.940]  so they'll use people that they get to be part of the drill they'll shoot real people have
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:13.660]  the mercenaries go out the back door kill the people that were part of the drill and
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:18.160]  then you've got your school mass shooting and that's how they did Columbine as well
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:22.660]  Harrison Clybal were making a film about shooting everybody at the school they'd done it before
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:28.140]  sanctioned by the school the new thing the videos all of it was part of the film they
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:33.180]  were producing it was the same thing for the bombers on 7 7 in London and that all later
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:40.260]  came out that my six ran that but what else can you tell us there because yeah we have
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:45.540]  the local news about the multiple shooters yeah multiple shooters allegedly were dressed
[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:51.140]  as nuns that's how they got on the property that's the rumor that's going it's a unverified
[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:56.300]  reporter rumor coming through the school system through the teachers and that this is how the
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:19:03.380]  people actually got on the property so what are we going to do band habits now I'm physically
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:07.420]  ill is all I can say I mean is that what we're going to do is that is that what it's come
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:11.740]  to now I'm telling you man-to-man if this guy came in and was a lone shooter and has
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:16.300]  to reload he's gone 27 people I hate to say I'm a cop here but 27 people that's a lot
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:21.380]  of people to be shooting his gun would have had to run out of ammo I know you I know me
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:26.380]  if that you know what ran out of bullets I'd be jumping on him and trying to kill him well
[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:32.140]  I mean take the case take the case of the congresswoman yeah Giffords getting shot people tackled
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:38.260]  them real fast yeah I mean listen I'm not bragging saying I'm a tough guy I've had
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:45.300]  people pull guns on me three times and every time I took the gun away from him and pistol
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:52.620]  wept him I'm not bragging I mean that's that's that's what I did but thank God I'm alive

[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:22.820]  being killed around the world by the globalist you know it came out just yesterday London
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:29.060]  Guardian German government the CIA torture bases raping people innocent people torturing
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:33.460]  them the raping is what they like to do the globalist they're not our government their
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:37.820]  criminal elements that have taken it over and use national security to protect themselves
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:45.380]  our government on record has done chemical biological and radiological test on children
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:50.220]  killed thousands of them just in one test alone radiological experiments on foster children
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:55.820]  4,000 plus you can look it up tens of thousands of pregnant wives of GIs were injected with
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:25:02.660]  plutonium uranium given plutonium uranium pills whole wards of women were killed you
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:08.380]  can look that up that just type in you know women given plutonium pills by Department
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:15.340]  of Energy so yes they'll stage cool shootings they have the motive they have the history
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:19.780]  of it and Kurt Nemo just posted an article it's going up right now at info wars dot com
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:25.060]  with the headline that anti gun crowd will exploit this you can bet your boots they're
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:29.940]  going to do that as Rahm Emanuel said don't let a good crisis go to waste they will use
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:41.100]  it and my gut is with the timing and everything that happened this is staged and you know
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:46.660]  I've been saying the last few months get ready for big mass shootings and get ready down
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:53.220]  the road al Qaeda will blow up aircraft with shoulder fired missiles and the media won't
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:58.380]  even point out that they got them when our government helped them take over Libya and
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:06.340]  then Syria and they're they're going to they're going to start their war against the American
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:11.740]  people very soon the globalists have taken the country over they want to start a civil
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:20.460]  war and I've said on air the last week that I feel the danger level just I feel it ladies
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:28.500]  and gentlemen it is I know I keep repeating this it's horrible and it's like when have
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:33.980]  you ever been in a car wreck and you're driving through the green light and you see somebody
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:38.860]  running it and you're going 30 and they look like they're going about 60 because I've been
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:44.100]  in one of these wrecks and you know oh my gosh this is going to hurt I hope and the
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:52.140]  last thought is I guess slam on the brakes but I hope they don't T bone me and and then
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:57.500]  it feels like five minutes as you're going into the intersection and the car smashing
[01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:06.500]  into you the government could care less about children in fact they hate the fact that they're
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:10.220]  even born they want to abort as many of them as they can so just get that when they're
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:14.780]  up there grandstanding and well see Bob Costas he was right notice they had all this anti
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:19.540]  gun stuff right before this right before Obama gets back in not facing reelection I said
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:26.060]  look out this is the kickoff they're coming after the guns look for mass shootings and
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:31.300]  we know they did sir hand sir hand that's been declassified partially that was an operation
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:38.540]  we know he was under mind control this is real folks let's talk to we got a bunch of
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:41.620]  callers and other issues but I want to go to William in New York you got breaking news

[01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:59.700]  go out to the victims sincerely you know these these poor children can you imagine somebody
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:03.900]  that could walk around walking up the little cute little kids and their little clothes and
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:09.740]  shooting them I mean I mean I mean it just makes me sick but then we're supposed to care
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:14.620]  about these kids but not ones being smart bombed by predator drones all those are just those

[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:40.460]  all of it together and it's the usual first reports and it'll probably come out that whoever
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:45.220]  did it took their time and there's always people in disguises and then that gets if
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:49.500]  they pursue people in the disguises and make a big deal out of it then it might have just
[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:54.140]  been some cult or nuts but but if it's all forget about all that then you know it's an
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:58.780]  inside job in fact there's some breaking news police believe there may be a second gunman

[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:24.220]  staged you know it's staged you know they stage the whole underwear bomber thing to put in the
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:29.020]  naked body scanners that even came out in congress they they stage sir hand sir hand that's come out
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:34.700]  they stage fast and furious that killed thousands of mexico hundreds in the u.s
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:40.220]  to blame the second amendment and if we find out there was a drill
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:46.220]  at this school and we've had already had locals call in and say before this happened
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:52.700]  they were already evacuating the high school we need people on the ground out there with
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:58.300]  video cameras we've seen a giant federal response taking over they make everybody stand back for
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:04.620]  an hour while guys in uniforms and paramilitary commando outfits show up like it blacksburg in places
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:10.780]  i'm telling you ladies and gentlemen this thing stinks to high heaven and if it turns out it's
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:15.180]  like the batman shooter where some government psychiatrist is in control of a guy and it's
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:22.460]  part of some DARPA program you just can't make that stuff up uh it takes a lot of will to shoot
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:29.180]  and kill 18 children 27 dead total that number is going up fast i say there's a whole classroom
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:34.300]  missing in fact if you guys punch up on screen drudge report dot com we've got our own reports
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:38.780]  up at info wars dot com screenshots of the trips and the background of this stuff but
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:43.260]  if you guys can punch up uh just what i've got on my uh computer screen here it shows the little
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:48.460]  children made you know crying made to walk out with their hands on the other kids shoulders
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:54.700]  i want to remind everybody that the federal government pays nationwide to have drills at
[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:59.900]  schools where unannounced they come in with guns and announce we're right wingers against
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:05.180]  public schooling that's an actual quote out of the ap or we're you know and then the kids defecate
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:10.220]  on themselves urinate on themselves cry break down the teachers don't know sometimes these
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:15.020]  drills are unannounced this is what they do to them this is the mind control to demonize the
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:20.940]  second amendment uh and we we we're going to have several guests today i've i've moved one
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:25.900]  up and just be on the nightly news just because this is so important but i kept larry graphwald
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:33.260]  on the show because he can speak to this vietnam veteran 65 to 66 in the second 502 infantry
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:40.300]  first brigade uh 101st airborne division former fbi weather underground informant who quoted obama
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:44.700]  confidant and former leader of the weather ministering that those americans uh who could
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:49.580]  not be reeducated in communist camps after the revolution would be eliminated in mal cultural
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:55.660]  revolution 25 million to be killed and he authored the book bringing down america following
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:37:00.140]  his testimony before the senate and also appeared in actually a two documentary no place to hide larry
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:06.380]  101st dot blogspot dot com and we played the clip over and over again i won't play in the
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:11.180]  interest of time uh of him talking about how they said we're going to bring down the country
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:17.020]  bankrupted put people in forced labor camps kill half of them uh and and and then when i've been
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:20.620]  and i played this on nightly news last night in the interest of time i won't get to it today but
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:24.860]  the video is up at info wars dot com i'll give you the headline in a moment i'm able to pull it up
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:30.860]  where i run into communist on the street and nicely talk to him and they go he said something nasty
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:34.860]  let's get him like they lie to the other communists it's all about deception i'm like i didn't say
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:38.940]  anything mean it's unedited tape and they and i go you know stalling kill 50 million people
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:44.780]  communism's bad they go too bad you didn't kill you yeah we're going to kill you that's the only
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:51.660]  time i caught it on tape i can't tell you how many times i have been covering the dnc covering
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:57.500]  whatever the case is and i'm not even a republican and they walk up and i'll punch me in the back
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:02.140]  and go oh didn't get that on tape did you and then say listen when we take this country over
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:06.620]  i'm going to be over you in the camp and i'm going to work you to death and i'm going to rape you
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:14.140]  you and i'm going to kill you now when you went 15 20 times i haven't counted it i caught it on
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:19.580]  tape once when they and now we've had bellifante basically saying put people in camps like a third
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:24.860]  world dictator they don't agree with obama on al sharpton show you gotta realize they'll do anything
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:29.180]  if they'd ship guns into mexico to blame the second amendment and still blame it on the second
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:34.140]  amendment the i told you get ready for mass shootings this will be the biggest one in u.s history
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:40.940]  magically as obama comes into a second term i smell a rat regardless let's play the clip
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:45.660]  of rama manual former white house chief of staff saying don't let a good crisis uh go to waste here
[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:51.660]  it is you never want a serious crisis to go to waste and what i mean by that it's an opportunity
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:56.540]  to do things that you think you could not do before okay there you go an opportunity to do
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:00.220]  things you couldn't do before so we know they're going to use it even though statistically more
[01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:05.020]  crimes uh you know committed in areas where they've taken the guns like chicago in new york
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:10.620]  more guns less crime and the answer is arm the schools but see they don't want that
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:16.860]  they want these zones where they can wind up a crazy and march them in there or have mercenaries
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:21.740]  do it or mafia groups do it and kill some patsy they look they caught the russians doing these
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:30.860]  fake mass shootings larry what's your gut on this tragedy right now and then and then tying it into
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:34.700]  a group that says they want to kill 25 million libertarians and conservatives
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:40.060]  would they stage a mass shooting to get our guns well first i want to say that i i feel
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:47.340]  very bad for the for the mothers and fathers of the children that have died today and i want to
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:54.140]  you know say that i really feel bad about that and it's certainly in my prayers an incident like
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:40:01.340]  this is not something that happens accidentally it was planned and and these were kindergarten
[01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:07.660]  children that were killed now i'm in california with my daughter and my grandson is five and a
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:16.220]  half years old he's a kindergartener and he probably comes up to about my weight and to imagine
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:24.300]  someone two people walking into a school and killing 18 or more kindergarten children is just
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:31.740]  beyond belief and you know that that person is is mentally deranged in some way that's probably
[01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:40.060]  what he's going to use is his excuse for what he did he probably has some psychiatrist that's already
[01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:46.620]  uh been trying to help him or not helping we know that one of the people was killed
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:53.980]  apparently what they're saying on the news just before i got on this call was that they had taught
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:41:01.580]  another one uh they had entered the building with full body armor uh they're saying that the weapons
[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:10.860]  used were a 223 caliber that's generally an m16 uh at first they were saying that the weapons were
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:17.660]  full automatic but now they're saying that they weren't and you can fire an m16 pretty fast on
[01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:24.780]  on single action and this is why we need our guns is to protect ourselves from this video game
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:31.180]  shooter up prozac culture that's linked to these psychotic breaks but now it being more more confirmed
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:38.620]  to shooters this this stinks to high heaven well just look at the the way the government is doing
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:47.500]  things today it's always the victim that somehow is at fault uh the the his fond thing down at uh
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:54.620]  fort uh fort hood it's you know that's not a terrorist act well you know he killed 13 soldiers
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:42:01.980]  um and wounded i forget how many others well they're not trying him as a terrorist they're
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:09.100]  trying him as an ordinary criminal and the big argument about his beard uh you know we we don't
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:18.060]  call terrorist act terrorism we call them a man man made disaster uh so you know what are we doing
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:25.580]  trying to fool ourselves by calling it something else and what's this in connecticut uh you know
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:32.460]  some nut goes into a theater who thinks he's batman or something and and kills a bunch of people
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:39.660]  and then we find out that the psychiatrist had warned at the school about him but because he
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:47.420]  had quit school or was no longer a student that don't say anything it makes no sense it's totally
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:52.460]  ideological and and you're right what they're going to do is try to use these things as an excuse
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:59.820]  to take our weapons away from us so that we're more vulnerable vulnerable to them the government
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:07.660]  and more vulnerable to the criminals and the nuts well they're saying they think it might be a father
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:12.540]  of one of the students and then had an accomplice with them i mean how does a father get someone
[01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:17.820]  to premeditate go in and shoot shoot them up but so many times when these are staged there's a
[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:23.980]  second or third gunman but then that just gets forgotten and shoved aside and just the timing
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:29.180]  of the biggest school shooting in us history right as obama's coming in and saying he may use
[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:36.620]  executive orders or other things to restrict and ban all semi-autos not from sale but from ownership
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:44.940]  uh larry if they try to take the guns in this country that will cause a huge conflict that
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:50.940]  will cause a civil war i believe it will because they're not going to take mine and and i know a
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:57.020]  lot of other people that say the same thing it simply isn't going to happen we have the right
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:02.940]  to bear arms it's a constitutional guarantee and no president has a right by executive order
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:08.940]  or any other means other than an amendment to the constitution to take that right away from us
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:15.100]  that would be like the president deciding that you can't be on the air anymore it's called freedom
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:20.380]  of speech and it's guaranteed in the constitution i don't know who this president thinks he is
[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:28.220]  sometimes i think he believes that he really truly is the messiah well uh yes he's told the congress
[01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:34.860]  that nato and the un's over our military he signed a executive order on cyber security uh and then
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:41.020]  what won't let congress see it he's shutting down power plants outside of law uh so uh we are all in
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:47.580]  in grave danger of the dictatorial move that this country country is slouching towards but yeah i
[01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:53.340]  mean i would advise the communist and collectivist look we know they want to put us in camps uh now
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:59.820]  the new army field manual we've given that number on air let's pull that back up guys uh says re-education
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:06.860]  cam we now see you heard me before you came on tell the story of what you'd call leftists when they
[01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:12.060]  know your camera and they'll come bump into you and say look when we take over you know i'm gonna
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:17.020]  i'm gonna put you in a jail cell i'm gonna work you to death i'm gonna rape you those are the type
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:22.460]  of things they say and i caught it on tape once it's in my film marshal law in new york and i'm
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:27.660]  just talking to communists that are out there with their banners and i'm totally polite to them
[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:34.060]  and they come over and and say you know you know uh it's too bad you're not dead we're gonna kill you
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:39.020]  uh when once we take over and it seems that's their religion it's like this fantasy
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:45.180]  of running camps uh now you've been in the middle of these people uh uh uh what do you make of
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:53.660]  velifonte and his statements oh it's absolutely crazy and and but it makes sense if you're an
[01:45:53.660 --> 01:46:01.340]  extreme leftist the communists if you will or you know extreme progressive they want everyone
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:07.100]  to think alike and if you don't think like they do they're willing to do anything up to and including
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:15.340]  to kill you in order to to gain control of the mass of the population i encountered this with the
[01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:23.180]  weathermen i've i heard bill ares and bernie dorn and others people speak and meetings and in and uh
[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:29.500]  uh appearances right now bill ares is going around the country educating people on how
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:38.060]  how we can become a new country and of course that new country is a socialist country so he's
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:45.260]  he's already concluded that that obama's second term is is going to take us the rest of the way
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:51.420]  uh well you know that's the issue is that i know these presidents have become globalist puppets but
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:57.340]  for the first time i'm really understanding that no they plan a good old-fashioned communist takeover
[01:46:57.340 --> 01:47:01.580]  they know they're destroying health care they know it's doubling the premiums they know it's all
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:06.940]  us i mean they are really going to totally gut everything and go from 25 million on food stamps
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:13.980]  to now 49 million to 100 million and they're really getting arrogant now and bragging about it and
[01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:19.100]  coming out and saying we're gonna arrest you you know we're gonna kill the white people just
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:27.420]  really trying to create race war it it's so evil yes it is this administration has made that a focus
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:34.380]  it is not about unity it is about division they're always ready to tell you what is different
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:43.020]  about you and the other person there's there's no americanism or patriotism that this administration
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:50.700]  isn't willing to to stomp on and and i don't care how many times obama gets up there and tries to
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:57.980]  to act like he's a good concerned american you tell me how it can be that after four years
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:04.540]  the unemployment rate is still almost at eight percent the real unemployment rate is probably
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:09.500]  more like 14 percent because of the number of people that have just given up people are underemployed
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:13.660]  let me ask you this question it's more like 25 if you look at the underemployed stuff people working
[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:19.020]  two three jobs and it's so cynical knowing that now tens of millions of employers are going to lay
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:23.900]  people off to part time so then they'll get two or three jobs which will be countered as new jobs
[01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:29.100]  so they'll say unemployment is lower it's so evil and cynical but you know obviously you're a combat
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:34.700]  veteran you know vietnam 101st airborne i can tell in your voice listening to you because i've
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:39.740]  interviewed you many times that there's an urgency in it everyone i know who's lived in the real world
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:47.820]  has an urgency now at your gut level have you ever had because i know i'm having so i'm asking you
[01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:55.100]  even before this happened today have you do you feel the sense of danger and dread that i'm feeling
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:49:01.660]  much much more than i ever have before even when i was living with the weathermen underground
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:10.380]  in rooms with with cases of dynamite and c4 i have more fear today not only for my life but for my
[01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:16.300]  daughters and my grandson and what their future is so what is it what is it because i'm trying to
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:21.020]  figure out why my spider sense is just off the charts right now what's about to happen what do
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:27.820]  you think's going on well i think you know just like roma manual said never let a crisis go to
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:35.100]  waste i'm surprised that we didn't have one before the election so that obama could use that you
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:41.260]  can bet that the left is going to use this issue to try to take our second amendment rights away
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:47.100]  from us they've already started trying to control the press you know that there's been all kinds of
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:53.980]  pressure but brought to bear on programs like yours trying to get them off the air and i think
[01:49:53.980 --> 01:50:00.700]  what's happening is we're sensing that we're being attacked at almost every level that's right
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:06.780]  just at one level if they're coming at us with health care with second amendments right with
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:14.540]  the un trying to with open borders uh yeah all of it i mean they are moving on every front right
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:22.860]  now and that's why you feel that sense of threat because it's it's as you look it's like where do i
[01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:29.020]  fight them they're coming from everywhere they're they're like cockroaches crawling up the wall
[01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:38.140]  and and the thing is is that we knew that this was coming 40 years ago i tried to tell people then
[01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:44.140]  these guys didn't change their mind when bill ares and bernie dorn surfaced and they said oh we were
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:51.020]  just an anti-war group we never hurt anybody that was bs i was in those meetings when we
[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:56.380]  well the thing is i've been around the communists too they're all about manipulating people they're

[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:13.340]  patient in there or set somebody up and have another team in there we've caught them doing
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:18.860]  stuff like this before this could just be some prozac nut you know crazy but they started
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:25.340]  scrubbing articles and natural news is reporting on this eyewitness reports of second shooter now
[01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:33.740]  being scrubbed from the news uh and people let out of the woods by officers and a swat team
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:39.900]  now investigating the home of one suspect and and again uh you've got reportedly a van that
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:46.220]  got its window shot out uh where they're smoked there's fire and we need to talk to people in
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:52.620]  the school before they get threatened was there a drill a drill this week or a drill today if
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:56:00.140]  that's the case ladies and gentlemen now it's it's it's i study this and it's a complex issue but
[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:07.020]  going back to uh larry our guest a larry graph wall uh looking at this and talking about you know
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:15.820]  the dread uh obama really is trying to invoke as much division i mean i i see articles here
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:25.660]  of espn saying that well there's a black guy that says he isn't into race issues uh and that you
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:31.820]  know you know that we're all basically you know brothers uh and they come out and say you know
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:38.940]  he's not one of us because he's not a democrat i mean i mean and they put this out on espn
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:45.660]  fox sports comes out and says gun ownership is kuklux klan uh bob costas blames things on the
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:53.820]  second amendment i mean the fact that the rhetoric is so diabolical right now this is a short segment
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:57:00.780]  you could see them ringing you know the bugle basically blowing the trumpet that the war against
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:07.660]  our liberties is starting and the open talk now of collectivism larry yes and costas immediately
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:13.900]  after that that football player killed his girlfriend was was on the air saying you know
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:20.860]  time to relook at the gun control laws and actually the team was talking about putting
[01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:28.460]  his number on their jersey that sunday that's kansas city uh and this is for a murderer
[01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:35.180]  for a murderer and you explain that to me it's it's like it's not his fault he's played football
[01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:41.660]  he had had injuries he was taking steroids it was not his fault that was the gun's fault
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:48.860]  and by the way alex i'd like to mention that my book's going to be released again shortly

[02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:34.620]  target new town connecticut school district had recently installed new safety protocols
[02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:40.620]  and a letter to parents strict new guidelines were outlined for elementary schools man i wouldn't
[02:00:40.620 --> 02:00:46.060]  put my children in a government training camp for all the money in the world that's an advertised
[02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:51.180]  mass shooting facility larry grathwald who is uh one of the informants that help bring down the
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:56.940]  weatherman is on with us and you don't need to hear it from him anymore we have a video actually up at
[02:00:56.940 --> 02:01:04.700]  um info wars dot com that goes over this it says a special report obama cronies want to kill
[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:10.860]  and imprison americans and i have communists on tape like ten of them on the street in new york
[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:18.380]  i walk over politely and i just started asking about communism and they said well the communism is
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:23.820]  we're going to kill you and and and and if you understand folks every communist that have ever
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:30.140]  been around all they talk about is how much they look forward to killing people and how much fun it
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:33.980]  is to kill people and how they and they're always real wimpy people too that probably never been
[02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:40.780]  in a fist fight larry what is it about really wimpy people chicken neck potbelly wimps that
[02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:48.140]  they dream about killing people all day i mean it's because they're gutless cowards and of course
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:55.500]  it it's much easier as such as in bill ayer's case he sees himself as being the leader he's not
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:02:01.180]  going to get his hands bloody he's going to have other goons out there doing it for him he's the
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:07.980]  brain you know he's he's the the doctor of education and uh you know bernadine's got her
[02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:15.340]  law degree and and all of that that's what they do they they create these factions these differences
[02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:22.140]  amongst us and then you know that even if they're not manipulating it directly you know that there's
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:29.820]  some nut out there listening to this stuff and finally he he says oh i've got an idea and he
[02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:37.580]  goes out and he kills 26 people at a school and it you know it's predictable you you know that
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:44.220]  that is going to happen and that's exactly what obama and his cronies have created in this country
[02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:48.220]  oh they're going to hype this up and i predict there'll be some more school shootings now from
[02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:56.540]  real nuts because because when they hype this stuff it creates copycats yes i agree i agree and it's
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:04.220]  again you know you have to be you know some kind of mindless lunatic to do what this guy has done
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:10.220]  today 18 kindergarten unbelievable you know i've you've got children and grandchildren and you say
[02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:14.860]  you're spending time with your five-year-old grandson i mean i've got a four-year-old and she's
[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:19.340]  so innocent and good it makes me cry sometimes when she's when i'm reading the book just because
[02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:26.460]  she's so good and i just can't imagine people that would shoot children like this neither neither
[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:31.500]  and i think you've got your hands full today because this is what everybody's going to want to talk
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:38.140]  about and um and and rightfully so and i and i hope that there's enough people out there listening
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:42.540]  to remember that it's not the gun that did it it's the person that did it and we ought to ask
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:46.620]  ourselves what's happened to our country that people are this deranged that's why we got to
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:51.500]  have the second amendment yes so so people can't march around you know the answer is like the israelis
[02:03:51.500 --> 02:04:00.300]  have m16s in in lockers in all the classrooms the answer is arm the schools yes yes where where they
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:07.660]  have allowed people to to get carry permits the crime's gone down and and you know why because
[02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:12.860]  all of a sudden the the bad guys don't know if you've got a gun and that you're going to shoot back
[02:04:12.860 --> 02:04:17.100]  there's such cowards there's such cowards the type of people that do this stuff i mean they are just
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:22.860]  the how i agree i mean i know there's a hell because i mean the universe it's an absolute rule
[02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:30.140]  that these people got to be i mean how would you want to kill children no way i i can't imagine it
[02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:37.340]  i in vietnam i remember if if we saw children in the area we stopped firing even if it's
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:44.860]  the risk of our own life you just you know you can't even imagine it and and that does a soldier

[02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:23.260]  beginning to emerge multiple shooters they're trying to expunge evidence of that but the police
[02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:28.860]  have now detained looks like two different people shot out the back of one window they've been looking
[02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:37.100]  for a van uh with a red or maroon van with its back window blown out uh they've also reportedly uh

[02:08:52.460 --> 02:09:00.300]  wrath walled uh force army veteran fbi infiltrator into the weatherman and was able to bring a lot
[02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:04.620]  of the evidence that sent him to prison and the reason we were going to have him on today is
[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:10.940]  balafonte uh harry balafonte and all these people were on the news saying you know uh
[02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:16.940]  it's fun to kill white people like jamie fox said we need to be like a third world dictator
[02:09:16.940 --> 02:09:23.740]  and put people in jail and again that's what the communists do they they caused division
[02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:30.460]  and it's it's it's this liberation theology uh and we have footage up at info wars dot com
[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:34.940]  special report obama's cronies want to kill him in prison americans and i'll walk over politely
[02:09:34.940 --> 02:09:41.340]  to communists and say hey uh what does your communist sign mean go away did you hear him he
[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:47.660]  just said something very nasty to me that is very nasty and and i didn't say anything and they come
[02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:51.900]  up and i go well what communism you know stalin killed tens of millions of people too bad he
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:56.940]  didn't kill you yeah we're going to kill you and and folks that's happened to me over and over again
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:10:01.900]  so i had him on about that but we were getting into the fact that why are they coming out with
[02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:06.300]  all this and if eight stage fast and furious folks they have a history of staging things or
[02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:12.380]  provocaturing things or knowing something's going to happen and letting it happen uh and uh they do
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:17.580]  this in a victim disarmament zone where people know folks are disarmed they're look notice the timing
[02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:22.380]  of this when obama's saying he may use executive orders to go after our guns so i'm gonna i'm gonna
[02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:30.220]  give the number out for people that are in the area with your reports 800-259-9231 you need to

[02:10:55.660 --> 02:11:00.940]  posted enemies of second amendment will exploit connecticut shooting there's no registration

[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:11.180]  about what's happening and one guy says not everything has to be a conspiracy i agree but
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:16.540]  they will use this to take our guns when larry graffall just pointed out everywhere with concealed
[02:11:16.540 --> 02:11:21.260]  carry crime goes down in countries where they have guns in the schools like israel no school
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:28.540]  shootings okay we need to arm the people in the schools period where are the police whenever this
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:32.780]  starts they always run now under new procedures the new safety procedures the old days were going
[02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:37.420]  up in the ut tower kill the guy now the new procedures are go back call the fed stand down
[02:11:37.420 --> 02:11:43.340]  like blacksburg wait two hours well it's actually almost three till you go in larry you know your
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:48.060]  combat vet yourself worked in you know in in support of law enforcement what's your view
[02:11:48.060 --> 02:11:53.980]  on these new socialist government policies of telling cops stand down run out get back up
[02:11:53.980 --> 02:11:57.100]  i mean if i was a cop this way with shooting people i'm not going to go get back up and i'm
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:12:01.740]  not saying i'm a tough guy i know what i do i've intervened before when people are being robbed
[02:12:01.740 --> 02:12:06.860]  and stuff i'm not going to tell tough guys stories but it's not that i'm a tough guy i guarantee you
[02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:13.020]  that if somebody was shooting kids in a school i would creep up on them and and jump them and
[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:18.060]  we see examples of that i mean i'm ranting here but other comments on this and then finish
[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:22.060]  your story that got cut off about when you were in the army uh and you know what you went through
[02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:27.900]  to not shoot kids well i i think i can start with that that there was times in vietnam when we were
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:35.020]  under fire and if we saw children in the area we would be fired for fear of hitting them and
[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:41.500]  our own lives were in jeopardy i can't imagine being outside of a school and knowing that there's
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:48.460]  something drastically going on inside that school and and standing down i'd have to go
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:54.460]  through the windows they'd have to kill me too because i couldn't live knowing that i had sat
[02:12:54.460 --> 02:13:00.140]  there and not done something and that's what you're saying alex you you you have to do something
[02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:07.260]  and these new rules of engagement that they have are designed to allow these kinds of catastrophes
[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:13.820]  not only to happen but to be bigger catastrophes than they were 50 years ago you know that guy in
[02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:21.980]  the tower in texas he killed some people but he didn't kill nearly as many as 26 and and they went
[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:27.580]  up on that tower and killed him they didn't even wait for backup uh two police along with a citizen
[02:13:27.580 --> 02:13:32.300]  just just and i've interviewed one of the police that killed him became a texas ranger they just
[02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:40.380]  charged in the guy shot him they killed him yeah that's how you do it and that's what you know i i
[02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:45.900]  mean let's make rules of engagement make it more difficult for the police to do the job and i'll
[02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:52.460]  tell you and 99 percent of the cases them men are going to want to do exactly what you're advocating
[02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:57.980]  there's only going to be a small number of them that want to wait and and read the rule book
[02:13:57.980 --> 02:14:03.100]  most there is no way listen if i was driving by a school and the shooting was going off
[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:07.500]  and i didn't even have a gun i'd go in there and that's not because i'm a tough guy i immediately
[02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:12.860]  want to rip the head off of somebody that's shooting kids i mean i it just i mean i never
[02:14:12.860 --> 02:14:17.980]  fantasize about violence but when i hear about whoever shot these these and killed these 18 kids
[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:24.700]  i mean i am just thinking about what i do to them yes and you and you know that that that that i
[02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:31.180]  don't it's not a public duty it's not a tough guy it it's that i want to do something to protect
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:36.220]  the innocent people and i don't care if it's adults or if it's kids but something like that's
[02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:43.020]  happening i'm going to do what i can to help without thinking about it that's just part of my nature
[02:14:43.020 --> 02:14:48.620]  and and and i think that it was what made this country great at one time and what's happened
[02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:55.500]  is we've become so fearful for what what it is that might happen to us if we act and that we're so
[02:14:55.500 --> 02:15:01.340]  afraid of the differences that we've been told we have that we no longer do anything we're like
[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:08.060]  sheep standing there watching that's right and people wait for the specialist to do it the
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:12.860]  you know the average cop now stand down while the SWAT team gets their gear on drives over here for
[02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:19.020]  30 minutes and then masses in their camo you know i mean you know those guys just had gun belts
[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:24.780]  around them nobody armor ran up the tower and killed that guy yeah and and yeah well what do
[02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:31.100]  you need what do you need SWAT for i but don't those police officers carry guns and they're
[02:15:31.100 --> 02:15:35.500]  and they have them for a reason and and protecting innocent people is part of it
[02:15:36.940 --> 02:15:41.180]  Larry thank you so much for spending thanks for having me on and you're going to be on to talk about

[02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:25.260]  it quick i was in the barbershop i got a text message from uh my phone about a shooting at
[02:18:25.260 --> 02:18:30.940]  an elementary school i live in new york i went to college in connecticut so i called my my roommate
[02:18:30.940 --> 02:18:35.980]  who i went to school with to make sure his daughter was okay and then he told me that the school was
[02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:42.620]  in newton he was in oh man we're very and then my mom texted me and she said oh my god that's
[02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:50.300]  carry school carries my cousin so i told him to put the the news on at the barbershop and they
[02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:54.860]  said oh i bet you're gonna think it was an inside job and i said i'm not saying that it was but
[02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:59.100]  i wouldn't put it past them and and they were like why would they kill innocent children and
[02:18:59.100 --> 02:19:05.020]  i said excuse me i said abortion vaccines and poisoning food and water these people are satan
[02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:09.980]  yeah yeah why did Hitler blow up the Reichstag to get control why did government stage these things
[02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:14.700]  to get our guns i mean why can't people get that through their head i don't know and it's so

[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:30.860]  gun culture here unless you're an eat you know unless you're a criminal then of course you

[02:32:55.020 --> 02:33:18.860]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:33:18.860 --> 02:33:26.300]  jacarney jackson was researching drills at the school and just found linkedin a time magazine
[02:33:26.300 --> 02:33:33.500]  article a school twitter photo of the little kids lined up just a few months ago in a shooter drill
[02:33:33.500 --> 02:33:38.860]  and they're just so tiny these kindergartners but then it makes me think about all these wars and
[02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:44.140]  these drones well they say they'll kill 200 people at a wedding putting little kids to get one bad guy
[02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:49.020]  and that's collateral damage so don't ever think the globalists that have hijacked this country
[02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:53.900]  wouldn't stage something like this they kill little kids all day every day and it's not our
[02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:59.660]  government it's the globalist and all i know is thousands of people have died in mexico from
[02:33:59.660 --> 02:34:05.660]  fast and furious many of them children so don't ever think this couldn't be staged now i've said
[02:34:05.660 --> 02:34:10.860]  this guy's what 20 years old who they're saying the shooter was and i was literally saying look
[02:34:10.860 --> 02:34:18.220]  up his age i bet he's 20 something a video game active shooter addicted prozac head if he's not
[02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:22.700]  a staged event and again i'm not saying you're evil if you play video games but
[02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:29.500]  i'm giving you the profile of real shooters we've seen are these nihilistic devil worshiper
[02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:37.500]  mama's boy types uh who do this type of stuff if you want to profile somebody uh it's generally
[02:34:37.500 --> 02:34:42.540]  white or hispanic male it doesn't matter i'm not even gonna get into it i'm just so sick of it
[02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:47.100]  i'm gonna shut up and go back to the police officer in connecticut real quick chris anything
[02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:52.140]  else you want to add you think people should know about this well i i think we gotta learn to protect
[02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:57.980]  ourselves and our children better you know another gun freeze zone um taking advantage of alex you
[02:34:57.980 --> 02:35:05.260]  know it's just uh time for to harden ourselves and harden our schools and and and really gets
[02:35:05.260 --> 02:35:11.580]  serious about security and and not hard i know the the liberal media is going to go after the guns
[02:35:11.580 --> 02:35:17.740]  and it's not the gun's issue it's it's it's being secure in our lives we've now confirmed that they
[02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:23.980]  began to tweet minutes after well they didn't even know i mean they are like ghouls just ready to jump
[02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:31.100]  on this i'm in i mean now they got it they're showing the kid i guess he was 24 years old they're
[02:35:31.100 --> 02:35:36.940]  saying now he's not a 20 year old he's a 24 year old the uh the shooter that's dead um and like i said
[02:35:36.940 --> 02:35:42.940]  before i guess uh his mother was a teacher there and she's amongst the dead so and it's gonna be
[02:35:42.940 --> 02:35:47.420]  something to see it unfold and but but i just wanted to make sure i got that point out there
[02:35:47.420 --> 02:35:54.540]  we're trying to go in alex and uh as far as the stand down issue um i know um statewide we're
[02:35:54.540 --> 02:36:00.780]  we're we're trained and ready to go what about the reports of the van with its wind has shot out
[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:05.820]  and other people another guy being swat teamed well there was another guy they got in the woods
[02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:11.260]  i guess he was in camo and uh and uh they they were just saying uh when he was being dragged
[02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:15.900]  out of woods you know witnesses heard him say i didn't do it i didn't do it and um they have him
[02:36:15.900 --> 02:36:21.820]  secured somewhere away um and being interrogated right now but i guess they went to the mother's
[02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:28.300]  the um shooter's mother's home and uh i i there i believe it was in newtown and they found her
[02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:34.940]  dead on the floor at home unbelievable yeah and the more the media advertises this if it isn't staged
[02:36:35.900 --> 02:36:41.340]  they hype it everybody knows criminology that that when they hype this enough other people
[02:36:41.980 --> 02:36:46.540]  who will decide to commit suicide the new way to commit suicide is go out and shoot a bunch of
[02:36:46.540 --> 02:36:50.620]  people and have the cops then kill you i don't know why these cowards don't just shove a gun in
[02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:55.980]  their mouth and kill themselves why do they have to go kill a bunch of kids uh in the process
[02:36:55.980 --> 02:37:01.260]  and and uh they're they're targeting gunfree zones too because they know it's gonna be a
[02:37:01.260 --> 02:37:07.420]  long time before anybody attacks them you know we can't sit by like sheep anymore and and we gotta
[02:37:07.420 --> 02:37:13.820]  we gotta defend ourselves now look if you can have police outside movie theaters you can have them
[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:18.140]  in the in these big public schools that are targets if they're not gonna arm the principles
[02:37:18.140 --> 02:37:22.220]  and people and then they'll put the police in have you there doing other stuff with the kids
[02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:26.220]  you know turning into a police state but i mean you just imagine that these are the top this is
[02:37:26.220 --> 02:37:32.860]  the advertised place to go kill kids and we're 310 million people you know there's only a few
[02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:37.900]  hundred of these demons out there but they're just they're just they're just out there uh god
[02:37:37.900 --> 02:37:42.940]  bless you i appreciate your point sir let's go to shawn in nevato as a police officer then to rob
[02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:48.940]  shawn you're on the air what's your take on this hey do now yeah i just want to reiterate what
[02:37:48.940 --> 02:37:54.780]  uh what chris just said i i actually train uh officers in in the response to these what we call
[02:37:54.780 --> 02:38:01.180]  act to shooter events and he's absolutely correct um after columbine uh they realized that that
[02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:06.140]  response was absolutely wrong that was how people were trained prior to that event that was the first
[02:38:06.140 --> 02:38:12.060]  mass shooting like that in the country that the training of the time was wait till swath gets there
[02:38:12.060 --> 02:38:19.900]  well swath is going to be too far away officers are trained to go in and uh two men sell three or
[02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:25.900]  four if they if they arrive and actively seek out the shooter they are trained to actually
[02:38:25.900 --> 02:38:32.780]  actually as harsh as it sounds to bypass victims and we do drills we have role players
[02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:38.860]  that are on the floor wearing uh well sure because if you give them aid then the shooter's
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:43.580]  going to come up and shoot you and keep killing people well with the train to track this person
[02:38:43.580 --> 02:38:49.100]  down to go towards the shooting find the shooter and and eliminate them then the rescue effort
[02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:54.060]  starts the searching starts so that's how they're trained so as far as the stand-in issue goes um
[02:38:54.060 --> 02:38:57.900]  wherever you got that from that that's misinformation that's not how we're how we're trained if i
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:02.700]  happen an incident it was completely and totally wrong and i hear you know i know they've changed
[02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:07.180]  it except when the feds get involved like black spark remember that a few years ago in virginia
[02:39:07.180 --> 02:39:11.500]  where they sat there for over two hours again because the feds said we're in control of this
[02:39:12.940 --> 02:39:18.620]  well i i mean i don't know who would listen to that i wouldn't listen to it like you said yourself
[02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:22.540]  if kids are never getting killed i don't know i don't know one single officer
[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:28.060]  that would not go in on duty or off duty by themselves to take care of that that incident
[02:39:28.700 --> 02:39:34.540]  in fact four science four science news is a organization out of uh out of canada that uh
[02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:39.260]  uh analyzes police shootings that kind of stuff and these kinds of events they just came out with
[02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:45.740]  a report this month in their newsletter uh that recommends based upon statistics they no longer
[02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:50.540]  even doing a two or three officer response waiting for them to get there that a single officer
[02:39:50.540 --> 02:39:57.100]  response is better because statistically it's almost like a uh like a trained or ingrained
[02:39:57.100 --> 02:40:02.780]  response these people when they are confronted with police they either kill themselves or they give
[02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:08.460]  up we you know we see that repeatedly well only the ultimate coward would want to go kill children
[02:40:08.460 --> 02:40:13.980]  so of course and then some of this like the batman shooter i mean that whole thing is psychotropic
[02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:17.660]  drugs up one side and down the other you can't debate it thank you so much turf your call we
[02:40:17.660 --> 02:40:22.540]  appreciate that sean you know you hear these police they really sound like good men don't they
[02:40:24.380 --> 02:40:27.660]  but then you got the government on top of them that's as corrupt as the day is long
[02:40:27.660 --> 02:40:32.780]  and if they try to come for people's guns folks it's going to be really bad news i just
[02:40:33.340 --> 02:40:37.100]  i'm just having so much dread right now and i just think i said when you got small children
[02:40:37.100 --> 02:40:41.340]  this really gets to you that's why the globalists use children's deaths to go after our guns because
[02:40:41.340 --> 02:40:46.460]  they know it gets to us you know these liberals would rather have the children aborted immediately
[02:40:46.460 --> 02:40:52.620]  but if they can you know uh if they can use them being killed by these shooters then that's even
[02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:57.980]  better for them robin new york i'm going to look this up we've been looking i haven't found it yet
[02:40:57.980 --> 02:41:02.620]  what's where'd you find this emails release prior to shooting uh tell us what you know about that
[02:41:03.260 --> 02:41:08.620]  yeah how's it going alex i was just watching uh channel seven abc news on long island new york
[02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:13.500]  and um i was wondering about the coincidence that they were saying that they were um email sent out
[02:41:13.500 --> 02:41:19.580]  to family members just recently they didn't say an exact date but it was saying in the emails that
[02:41:19.580 --> 02:41:26.220]  this is the same exact situation to be on the lookout for say that again that this is the
[02:41:26.220 --> 02:41:31.260]  same exact situation to be on the lookout for uh these yeah i know they announced it said a few
[02:41:31.260 --> 02:41:36.060]  weeks ago new security procedures and you had to get through a gate and all this basically turning
[02:41:36.060 --> 02:41:42.140]  it into a uh you turn the whole thing into a prison uh but we'll continue to look at that
[02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:46.460]  anything else you'd like to add sir yeah i was just wondering i mean is i mean it's a coincidence
[02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:51.660]  or and what is their connection of the correlation is that the idea that this person got you know
[02:41:51.660 --> 02:41:58.700]  because of these training drills to go and do that or is i just you know all i know is that
[02:41:58.700 --> 02:42:03.260]  and i appreciate your call because i've i've read a lot of criminology books because they're so
[02:42:03.260 --> 02:42:07.100]  interesting when i was younger i was they were interesting but later in life realized it was
[02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:12.780]  important criminals love to brag that's one thing everybody knows but another big thing is crazy
[02:42:12.780 --> 02:42:17.660]  people every time they had somebody jump off the empire states building or jump off the world trade
[02:42:17.660 --> 02:42:23.500]  center and be on the news immediately they'd put police up there before they built the big
[02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:27.820]  fences because crazies would show up and want to do the same thing and then and then it would cause
[02:42:27.820 --> 02:42:33.180]  a cascade of rip i mean you know some some of the cases four or five people in a week would jump off
[02:42:33.180 --> 02:42:39.100]  a skyscraper and it happens in dallas chicago everywhere uh and it's the same thing a lot of
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:44.220]  times if you have a bank robber robbing things in a certain mask if it happens enough other people
[02:42:44.220 --> 02:42:51.980]  will go get mask and do the same thing and uh people are highly suggestible ryan lands i deed as
[02:42:51.980 --> 02:42:58.860]  newtown school shooting gunman he looks like a hipster i bet money that guy was on a bunch of
[02:42:58.860 --> 02:43:07.660]  serotonin reab take inhibitors the alleged government appears to possibly point to the
[02:43:07.660 --> 02:43:16.060]  the wrong man ryan lands that list his hometown as newtown but indicates he mostly was recently
[02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:21.340]  raised in hoboken so who knows if that's even the right guy what what publication is that out of
[02:43:22.780 --> 02:43:27.660]  the inquisitor all right we'll continue look you better know this all day at info wars.com
[02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:31.660]  and prisonblood.com if you're out the weekend i'll be filing reports um
[02:43:31.660 --> 02:43:40.300]  um they will use this to come after our guns and um it makes me so angry at
[02:43:40.300 --> 02:43:45.580]  michael more and pierce borgen and people like this because because they know they know that
[02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:51.180]  mass shootings are flat in the last 20 years they know that overall crime is much higher in areas
[02:43:51.180 --> 02:43:55.020]  where they restrict the second amendment and they're really angry that the gun culture
[02:43:55.020 --> 02:44:03.660]  starting to take hold here and all i can tell the police is you better let the feds know because i
[02:44:03.660 --> 02:44:10.060]  i mean let me tell you something people are not turning their guns in and uh if they tried to get
[02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:14.940]  the police to do that it is it is going to cause a big problem and i don't want that to happen
[02:44:16.940 --> 02:44:20.300]  we're going to skip this network break coming up because this news is so important plus we have
[02:44:20.300 --> 02:44:26.780]  this report we've worked on for weeks breaking down the fact that 2012 december 21st is not the
[02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:30.540]  end of the world we've got this that air index put together with myself we're going to air that
[02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:37.180]  in a moment um we've got uh cbs second shooter reporter we've confirmed all those reports we're

[02:44:41.100 --> 02:44:46.300]  in a moment i'm going to take a break here and play this special report on 2012 because a lot
[02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:51.740]  of you tune in today to hear it and i'm going to compose myself here um because you know you heard
[02:44:51.740 --> 02:44:57.340]  me a few days ago mike adams say this stuff's really starting to get to me and i uh i'm torn
[02:44:57.340 --> 02:45:02.780]  because i end up thinking about this all the time and working all the time till i'm like a zombie
[02:45:03.340 --> 02:45:07.660]  and then i can't take off to recharge my batteries because all i'm doing is thinking about this
[02:45:07.660 --> 02:45:19.980]  and uh i'm not trying to whine on air i i just uh this country isn't so much trouble that's all i
[02:45:19.980 --> 02:45:26.060]  can say and you know we need to boycott pierce morgan we need to boycott michael more and all
[02:45:26.060 --> 02:45:30.540]  these other people that use stuff like this to try to take our rights america is america because
[02:45:30.540 --> 02:45:35.740]  of the first and second amendment and the tenth amendment and melissa melton's got an article
[02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:40.380]  coming out on twitter where they're calling to murder the head of the nra and calling to kill
[02:45:40.380 --> 02:45:47.100]  gun owners and and and more of this more of this stuff and the collectivist are just so lazy and
[02:45:47.100 --> 02:45:52.620]  stupid and fad driven they are just dumbered in a box of rocks all right here is the special
[02:45:52.620 --> 02:45:59.660]  report and really the inside scoop on 2012 is at the end of the world well here is our take on it
[02:45:59.660 --> 02:46:15.900]  right now we have been told the end of our world will occur on december 21st 2012 as 2012 draws to
[02:46:15.900 --> 02:46:21.500]  a close will it be the end of our species the end of our world or just the beginning
[02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:33.420]  in case you haven't heard the world is going to end in 2012 december 21st 2012 the mayan
[02:46:33.420 --> 02:46:40.380]  calendar basically predicts that the world will end in the world is not going to end
[02:46:40.380 --> 02:46:48.380]  december 21st 2012 coming up in just a few days it is a hoax it is a premeditated fraud
[02:46:48.380 --> 02:46:55.580]  no mayan scholars no archaeologists have ever come out and looked at the mayan prophecies in
[02:46:55.580 --> 02:47:00.780]  the mayan calendar and said that it states is going to be an end to the world the whole thing
[02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:09.420]  is a 30-plus year manufactured hoax a total and complete scam and we're going to break down exactly
[02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:15.900]  who is behind it and why the mainstream media has been peddling this for the decades did the maya
[02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:22.540]  think the world would end in 2012 no they didn't now the mayan people are fighting back saying that
[02:47:22.540 --> 02:47:28.780]  the idea of the world coming to an end in 2012 did not come from their calendar but where do we
[02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:36.220]  find the modern into the world 2012 cult beginning new age thinkers like terrence macchina and robert
[02:47:36.220 --> 02:47:43.980]  anton wilson launched what has become the 2012 doomsday hubbub in the 1970s they simply use the
[02:47:43.980 --> 02:47:50.380]  mayan date to launch a kickoff of the new age scenario to garner attention to their other
[02:47:50.380 --> 02:47:57.020]  illuminati new age writings robert anton wilson in his book the cosmic trigger said that there would
[02:47:57.020 --> 02:48:03.980]  be a scientific quickening similar to what ray Kurzweil says that the singularity would begin
[02:48:03.980 --> 02:48:13.500]  to happen on december 21st 2012 and he used the mayan date as a symbolic trigger for all of this
[02:48:13.500 --> 02:48:20.380]  but there were countless other new age gurus and establishment connected types who came out over
[02:48:20.380 --> 02:48:26.620]  the next few decades and continued to push this idea that the world would either physically end
[02:48:26.620 --> 02:48:33.900]  on december 21st 2012 or that a new age would start at that point and that is exactly what we
[02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:39.580]  are seeing being promoted and being pushed right now this end of the world business is a reoccurring
[02:48:39.580 --> 02:48:46.140]  theme throughout history and it gets people to cop out and to not be involved in their daily lives
[02:48:46.140 --> 02:48:50.940]  it makes you have a feeling of powerlessness and governments of different institutions
[02:48:50.940 --> 02:48:55.820]  have always been happy to promote this the establishment for hundreds of years has gotten
[02:48:55.820 --> 02:49:01.180]  christians to not be politically involved because going back to the time of the nostics they always
[02:49:01.180 --> 02:49:08.540]  believe the world was ending next week it is a total system to cop out it is a manufactured
[02:49:08.540 --> 02:49:14.540]  superstition just as christians are given the rapture as a reason to stand down and not fight
[02:49:14.540 --> 02:49:20.700]  back against corruption and evil the new age crowd or the hippies the trendies people that didn't
[02:49:20.700 --> 02:49:28.060]  believe in god they needed a reason to not be involved it is a self-fulfilling prophecy and
[02:49:28.060 --> 02:49:34.940]  that's what the whole 2012 hoax is about a artificial superstition to make people turn
[02:49:34.940 --> 02:49:41.020]  control of their lives over to the globalist technocrats strangely enough we find the answer
[02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:47.260]  to our current superstition in ancient cultures like the mayan and i don't just want to pick on
[02:49:47.260 --> 02:49:52.620]  them this was this was system-wide throughout all human cultures that you would see the rise
[02:49:52.620 --> 02:49:58.780]  of a priest class who would say if you don't give us the best huts the best temples the best food
[02:49:58.780 --> 02:50:04.620]  and finally human sacrifices the greatest thing they could demand from the general population
[02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:12.060]  the giant titan god will swallow the sun or the snake god will swallow the sun or moon
[02:50:12.060 --> 02:50:16.380]  and it will be the end of the world if you don't give the priest class total control
[02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:21.660]  and that's basically what politicians at hollywood are doing again today it's the end of the world
[02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:27.900]  with terrorism it's the end of the world with the economy if you don't give us more control
[02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:32.940]  we're going to go over the fiscal cliff you remember carl rove when he told the new york times
[02:50:32.940 --> 02:50:37.900]  that it doesn't matter if we lie to people doesn't matter if we change the political narrative tomorrow
[02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:44.460]  up as down down as up in 1984 fashion because we in the governing class are histories actors now
[02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:50.940]  and you the public are in such a coma you will just accept whatever the new reality is so sit down
[02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:57.900]  and shut up and that's what these prophets of doom are doing they are stealing the future they are
[02:50:57.900 --> 02:51:03.420]  prescripting what it's going to be and then we just fall into line and believe it like their god
[02:51:04.060 --> 02:51:12.060]  don't let these people dominate and control the future in conclusion i want to cover some real threats
[02:51:12.060 --> 02:51:18.380]  that could not just destroy the human species but could destroy this beautiful planet itself
[02:51:18.380 --> 02:51:23.740]  many top physicists and scientists are on record saying that these giant cyclotrons
[02:51:23.740 --> 02:51:30.140]  and superconducting super colliders like the hadron facility in europe are engaged in experiments
[02:51:30.140 --> 02:51:34.700]  that could possibly destroy this planet by switching on a ten billion dollar machine
[02:51:34.700 --> 02:51:40.140]  in an attempt to recreate the big bang but critics are worried it will create a black hole which could
[02:51:40.140 --> 02:51:47.660]  swallow the earth interestingly enough cern goes live on december 16th through the 21st many
[02:51:47.660 --> 02:51:54.300]  scientists have warned that nanotech could get out of control and create a self-replicating
[02:51:54.300 --> 02:51:59.580]  manufacturing system that would overtake the service of the globe in just a matter of days
[02:51:59.580 --> 02:52:05.660]  in hundreds of major studies gmo crops that have been eaten by americans for decades cause
[02:52:05.660 --> 02:52:11.580]  near total sterility brain damage and deformities in the different roads that they've been fed to
[02:52:11.580 --> 02:52:17.500]  major universities for decades have been stampeding each other to publish things like the mouse
[02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:24.460]  pox recipe that can be redesigned for humans very easily and inexpensively and kills more than 90
[02:52:24.460 --> 02:52:29.820]  percent of mammal species that come in contact with it and then of course there's the good old
[02:52:29.820 --> 02:52:36.620]  fashion threat of nuclear weapons more than 60 000 of them held by governments right now onboard
[02:52:36.620 --> 02:52:44.700]  aircraft underwater submarines missile cruisers back in the 1960s many nuclear physicists believe
[02:52:44.700 --> 02:52:50.540]  that high altitude detonations of hydrogen bombs could blow a hole in our atmosphere and that the
[02:52:50.540 --> 02:52:57.820]  planet could become dead still the military went ahead with the test teak with the yield of 3.8
[02:52:57.820 --> 02:53:04.780]  megatons detonated nearly 50 miles above the surface of the earth the detonation created a
[02:53:04.780 --> 02:53:10.620]  violent magnetic disturbance in the atmosphere and the point i'm getting at here is that the mad
[02:53:10.620 --> 02:53:17.260]  scientist technocratic elite that runs our planet always engages in the most destructive reckless
[02:53:17.260 --> 02:53:24.140]  behavior while lecturing us that we need a world government to keep rogue states from developing
[02:53:24.140 --> 02:53:29.660]  dangerous chemical biological and radiological weapons the seeds of our destruction may have
[02:53:29.660 --> 02:53:36.940]  already been sown it is imperative that we have a serious debate about the real threats facing us
[02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:45.980]  and not raptures and 2012 into the world garbage there is no way that our society that our civilization
[02:53:45.980 --> 02:53:51.820]  is going to survive if people don't start really getting wise about the real threats we face if you
[02:53:51.820 --> 02:54:04.220]  are listening or watching this transmission you are the resistance all right erin dykes that video
[02:54:04.220 --> 02:54:07.340]  is probably the greatest editing he's ever done if you're a radio listener we're going to post
[02:54:07.340 --> 02:54:12.940]  the video in the next hour it's uploading now to info wars dot com and present planet dot com
[02:54:12.940 --> 02:54:19.340]  will air on the news tonight present planet dot tv and we've got another article about to go up from
[02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:32.300]  melissa melton teachers son 24 shoots dead 29 including 22 children at connecticut elementary
[02:54:32.300 --> 02:54:39.100]  as he and a second shooter massacre cowering students in the worst school shooting in american
[02:54:39.100 --> 02:54:45.580]  history and that is a inside job right there either way you cut it i bet money that woman
[02:54:45.580 --> 02:54:52.060]  was a super liberal i bet money that's what i said i said i bet he's in his 20s a big video
[02:54:52.060 --> 02:54:57.980]  gamer a trendy i said that to jacari and melissa melton and david night back there in their office
[02:54:57.980 --> 02:55:04.620]  and uh they're like yeah he's 20 something yeah and then we found his photo and you know
[02:55:05.660 --> 02:55:12.460]  may just be a nut uh maybe staged so you know they're going to use it though heaven help us
[02:55:14.380 --> 02:55:18.540]  but the media saying here's the guy's photo but then there's other photos of a guy with the same
[02:55:18.540 --> 02:55:24.540]  name who knows we'll have to contract this let's talk to bill who's in connecticut next town over
[02:55:24.540 --> 02:55:32.300]  uh from um where this happened what what's your take on this bill uh well i'm watching the local
[02:55:32.300 --> 02:55:37.740]  cable news and they seem to be have the most updated and accurate information and they just
[02:55:37.740 --> 02:55:43.500]  indicated a moments ago that the police are going door to door looking for a second gunman
[02:55:44.220 --> 02:55:50.940]  and then they have a helicopter shot over another school a mile south uh called let me see
[02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:59.660]  saint rose of lima school and about six policemen were in the parking lot and then suddenly they
[02:55:59.660 --> 02:56:06.620]  just bolted into the school about five minutes ago so they're right now it's just an overhead shot
[02:56:06.620 --> 02:56:12.860]  and really no one knows why they went into the school but it gives one pause to wonder what
[02:56:12.860 --> 02:56:18.780]  they're doing at that school to begin with now now now now say that again for me what exactly
[02:56:18.780 --> 02:56:24.620]  is happening on the local news that the police were in a parking lot of another school about a
[02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:33.020]  mile south of the other school and the school is rose of saint rose of lima school sure and there
[02:56:33.020 --> 02:56:39.420]  were about six policemen in the parking lot and suddenly they bolted into the school
[02:56:40.700 --> 02:56:44.540]  what thinking there may be another shooter i'm sure there's false alarms people are probably
[02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:50.940]  panicking or i didn't see the video of this i mean what it looked like to you um it looked like
[02:56:50.940 --> 02:56:56.860]  something was going on inside the school now the reporters on the scene from the local reporters
[02:56:56.860 --> 02:57:04.380]  are saying that the police are going door to door in the area apparently looking they're assuming
[02:57:04.380 --> 02:57:11.500]  that they're looking for another gunman oh yeah listen even a prozac head because again they admit
[02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:17.260]  it can cause psychotic breaks and make people have no empathy and do this it takes incredible will
[02:57:17.260 --> 02:57:23.020]  to go around shooting a little bit of kids um and uh i mean most soldiers even with
[02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:28.460]  instinctive training have trouble killing other men up close it's just it's just unbelievable
[02:57:28.460 --> 02:57:34.060]  but but i mean there there is this nihilistic sicko satan culture out there where you know
[02:57:34.060 --> 02:57:38.700]  people think it's really cool to talk about hurting kids and all i'd like to say is this man
[02:57:38.700 --> 02:57:44.060]  i'd like to get my hands on them that's all i can say but this could be staged as well i mean
[02:57:44.060 --> 02:57:48.620]  the batman thing had all the signs of it more just keeps coming out and it is crazy to think
[02:57:48.620 --> 02:57:52.620]  government could be doing this but they did fast and furious sir hand sir hand was mind
[02:57:52.620 --> 02:57:57.580]  controlled the police report said he didn't shoot rfk i mean there's so many examples
[02:57:57.580 --> 02:58:02.140]  of real mind control programs uh you know it's hard to believe the government does
[02:58:02.140 --> 02:58:06.940]  secret experiments on kids and kills them but it's been declassified i don't know what's your gut
[02:58:06.940 --> 02:58:13.660]  tell you about this i get i i agree with you that there's there's something more to it you just
