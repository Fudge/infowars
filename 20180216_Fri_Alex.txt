[00:00.000 --> 00:18.040]  Well, they're making their big move to ban guns, they're saying Trump and all gun owners
[00:18.040 --> 00:22.760]  are mentally ill, there's no blame of the psychiatric drugs, there's no blame of the
[00:22.760 --> 00:27.000]  culture of death, and the fake news media has been caught lying saying he traveled the
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.440]  white supremacist compound, that turns out to be a total hoax. Let's look at a breakdown
[00:31.440 --> 00:35.720]  of some of the latest news, then we'll come back with the bombshell info as Democrats
[00:35.720 --> 01:01.200]  call for Republicans to be murdered.
[01:01.200 --> 01:04.400]  There's been a shooting at a high school in Broward County, Florida about an hour north
[01:04.400 --> 01:08.560]  of Miami. More than 14 students have been injured in the superintendent reports that
[01:08.560 --> 01:34.960]  there were numerous fatalities.
[01:34.960 --> 01:44.680]  The answer is armed teachers in the schools. The answer to stop murdering killers is good
[01:44.680 --> 01:49.040]  people with guns. Did we turn our guns in because Hitler was doing bad things with guns?
[01:49.040 --> 01:53.400]  No, we used guns to stop him.
[01:53.400 --> 01:59.960]  He seemed very, I don't know what the word I want to say is, but he was trouble in middle
[01:59.960 --> 02:04.640]  school, so I kind of joked to him about it and said, I'm surprised you weren't the one
[02:04.640 --> 02:11.160]  who did it, and he just gave me a, huh? So that's really what happened.
[02:11.160 --> 02:14.560]  You were walking down the hall he had already fired at that time?
[02:14.560 --> 02:16.480]  Yes, sir, with him.
[02:16.480 --> 02:18.800]  Weren't you scared?
[02:18.800 --> 02:25.840]  Um, in the moment I wasn't, because there was obviously definitely another shooter involved,
[02:25.840 --> 02:26.840]  but...
[02:26.840 --> 02:29.240]  Oh, you think he was not the only one?
[02:29.240 --> 02:30.960]  No, definitely not.
[02:30.960 --> 02:35.560]  Do you think there was more than one shooter?
[02:35.560 --> 02:40.080]  It was impossible for them to have possibly been only one shooter because she heard shot.
[02:40.080 --> 02:45.360]  I think this is, uh, there has to be, like, for sure a second shooter, um, I think they
[02:45.360 --> 02:47.120]  need to keep investigating that.
[02:47.120 --> 02:52.480]  We cannot accept this. I can't do a wolf. I'm sorry. We can't do it.
[02:52.480 --> 02:53.480]  Cups.
[02:53.480 --> 02:54.480]  Please get your guns.
[02:54.480 --> 02:59.560]  We're currently shooting in this country. The odds get worse and worse and worse.
[02:59.560 --> 03:02.160]  Are you really willing to keep playing those odds?
[03:02.160 --> 03:07.120]  They shouldn't just shoot this under the rug as some other, you know, school shooting where
[03:07.120 --> 03:12.680]  there was a lone gunman, and then everyone's up in arms saying, hey, we need gun control.
[03:12.680 --> 03:16.560]  Everyone needs to take the guns away. That's why I said, um, I was talking to this guy,
[03:16.560 --> 03:21.680]  uh, you know, near the school, uh, and he was telling me these teachers, they would be
[03:21.680 --> 03:26.720]  able to protect the students had they just had the ability to fight back. He said, when
[03:26.720 --> 03:31.200]  you have a gun and you're going to get someone who's trying to shoot you, you're equalizing
[03:31.200 --> 03:35.720]  the balance of power. That's exactly what needs to happen because you see there's a
[03:35.720 --> 03:40.040]  teacher laying on the floor on, uh, one video that I saw with blood everywhere and the teachers
[03:40.040 --> 03:46.640]  are in the center walking out. This type of stuff could have been completely, maybe not
[03:46.640 --> 03:52.560]  stopped, but diminished quite a bit. Had a teacher and a gun in that building and they
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.160]  were able to shoot back and kill him. I thank God to this teacher who opened up
[03:57.160 --> 04:01.240]  her door and let all of us in. She got shot in the arm trying to open the door and then
[04:01.240 --> 04:06.760]  the other teacher, he got shot in the head. He went up and down the hallway, just banging
[04:06.760 --> 04:10.440]  and shooting into the classroom. She shot through my door. I think about three and my
[04:10.440 --> 04:15.680]  classroom got hurt. I just saw blood everywhere. But I just want to jump into four weeks ago
[04:15.680 --> 04:22.600]  when the secret service stuff started happening. So, uh, it was sort of like a random thing.
[04:22.600 --> 04:27.960]  I think it happened like right after a weekend or something. The teachers, every single one
[04:27.960 --> 04:33.880]  of them was instructed to tell us like this. Where are we going to go for each class? And,
[04:33.880 --> 04:39.200]  uh, you know, every single day that would tell us. And then I talked to one of my teachers.
[04:39.200 --> 04:43.600]  Uh, in fact, it was the same teacher that I ended up being with.
[04:43.600 --> 04:48.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back on the other side with the latest on the Florida
[04:48.680 --> 04:54.280]  situation. North Korea is really coming to a head. Uh, a lot of science news is to jam

[06:12.760 --> 06:18.920]  Coming to you from the former United States of America. From deep in the heart of Texas.
[06:18.920 --> 06:25.800]  Alex Jones. As I'm sure you know and feel, this is another very sad day in America. Another
[06:25.800 --> 06:31.960]  senseless shooting. This time at a high school in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman, a former
[06:31.960 --> 06:37.080]  student, opened fire yesterday again. Seventeen lives have been lost more than a dozen people
[06:37.080 --> 06:41.720]  are hospitalized. And our president, as he should, weighed in on the tragic events this
[06:41.720 --> 06:49.160]  morning from the White House. We are all joined together as one American family. And your
[06:49.160 --> 06:59.840]  suffering is our burden also. No child, no teacher should ever be in danger in an American
[06:59.840 --> 07:07.240]  school. Agreed. No parent should ever have to fear for their sons and daughters when
[07:07.240 --> 07:13.720]  they kiss them goodbye in the morning. Agreed. So I agree with both of those statements.
[07:13.720 --> 07:17.920]  And here's what you do to fix that. Tell your buddies in Congress, tell Paul Ryan and Mitch
[07:17.920 --> 07:22.800]  McConnell and Marco Rubio, all the family men who care so much about their communities,
[07:22.800 --> 07:28.160]  that what we need are laws, real laws, that do everything possible to keep assault rifles
[07:28.160 --> 07:32.520]  out of the hands of people who are going to shoot our kids. Go on TV and tell them to
[07:32.520 --> 07:39.160]  do that. Remember the left side of the whole Arab Spring.
[07:39.160 --> 07:44.080]  The common sense you told us you were going to bring to the White House. It's time to
[07:44.080 --> 07:48.480]  bring it. We need it. Tell these congressmen and lobbyists who infest that swamp you said
[07:48.480 --> 07:53.180]  you were going to drain. Force these allegedly Christian men and women who stuff their pockets
[07:53.180 --> 07:58.640]  with money from the NRA. All right, pause again. You just got his little anti-Christian
[07:58.640 --> 08:04.880]  statement. And now the money from the NRA stuffed in their pockets. The NRA is one
[08:04.880 --> 08:09.040]  of the only lobbies in the country that actually represents the people and a constitutional
[08:09.040 --> 08:13.440]  right in the Bill of Rights. And it doesn't come from the Bill of Rights. It's simply
[08:13.440 --> 08:18.440]  pointing it out that because they're a bad people in the world is why I have guns. Just
[08:18.440 --> 08:22.520]  like when you're little Islamic buddies you bring in, run over dozens and dozens of people
[08:22.520 --> 08:30.520]  killing them in New York screaming Allah Akbar. We don't blame the truck company that manufactured
[08:30.520 --> 08:34.560]  the automobile that chooses the weapon. Just like when somebody beats somebody over the
[08:34.560 --> 08:41.400]  head with a baseball bat. We don't then blame Louisville Slugger. And you know that. You're
[08:41.400 --> 08:47.240]  on record doing daily consultations five days a week with Chuck E. Schumer who writes your
[08:47.240 --> 08:53.520]  so-called comedy now. It is a bunch of political garbage. And then he comes out and again calls
[08:53.520 --> 08:58.200]  the president. It's a long rant. Mentally ill. So he's reading off a Democrat party
[08:58.200 --> 09:04.640]  teleprompter written statement. And he's seizing on this tragedy when school shootings are
[09:04.640 --> 09:10.000]  still flat but they're still an issue. One young person is too many. And then there's
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.680]  all the warning signs and the FBI called and reports of all the other shooters and all
[09:14.680 --> 09:20.600]  the strangeness going on. And here's Jimmy Kimmel again in Hollywood that glorifies guns
[09:20.600 --> 09:26.280]  and glorifies violence that's been directly causally linked to the rise starting in the
[09:26.280 --> 09:30.880]  70s of mass shootings. Because we are way up mass shooting wise compared to the 1950s
[09:30.880 --> 09:37.080]  or 60s. But if you look since the 70s it's a flat curve. Overall gun crimes down almost
[09:37.080 --> 09:42.600]  60 percent. It was over 60 percent since 1992. But a slight bump the last few years but not
[09:42.600 --> 09:47.880]  towards its old high in 1988. That was the height of gun violence according to the FBI
[09:47.880 --> 09:51.680]  crime statistics that are very, very accurate because they list off local numbers. So the
[09:51.680 --> 10:01.600]  heights 88 we have seen a precipice drop since 92 until 2016. And then it raised back up
[10:01.600 --> 10:08.400]  a little but only a few percentage points or 58 points according to researcher John Lott
[10:08.400 --> 10:14.480]  and others that crunch those federal numbers. So we were at 61 percent now or like 58 percent
[10:14.480 --> 10:20.240]  drop since 1992. And you're here just selling total lies kind of like Don Lemon said yesterday.
[10:20.240 --> 10:26.320]  Oh odds are you got a better chance of being killed in mass shooting. It's just not true.
[10:26.320 --> 10:30.000]  But they know exactly what they're doing. They know exactly what they're engaged in.
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.480]  It's called deception. And again remember it's a fact that when they glorify these mass
[10:35.480 --> 10:40.640]  shooters since the 70s 80s and 90s it continues them. And there's generally a few more mass
[10:40.640 --> 10:45.080]  shootings in the week after one of these. Just like right after Vegas we saw the church
[10:45.080 --> 10:50.120]  shooting in Texas. So everybody should be particularly vigilant right now because there
[10:50.120 --> 10:56.240]  are a lot of mentally ill people out there. The insert the Prozac family of drugs says
[10:56.240 --> 11:00.080]  it can cause mass shootings. But again there's never really a public discussion of that is
[11:00.080 --> 11:07.560]  there. And now a family and friends have come out that knew the reported shooter Nick Cruz.
[11:07.560 --> 11:12.640]  And they're saying that he was on psychotropic drugs and basically was a mental zombie.
[11:12.640 --> 11:17.520]  But that's hardly in the news. You've got to go to info wars dot com or the local papers
[11:17.520 --> 11:22.760]  or drugs report dot com has a top link right now an article by Paul Joseph Watson or article
[11:22.760 --> 11:27.200]  by Don Chalizar. We're going to break all that down. Let's continue with Kimmel here
[11:27.200 --> 11:32.240]  to do something now not later. Now. And don't you dare let anyone say it's too soon to be
[11:32.240 --> 11:36.560]  talking about it because he said it after Vegas. He said it after Sandy Hook. You say
[11:36.560 --> 11:42.000]  that after every one of these eight now fatal school shootings we had in this country this
[11:42.000 --> 11:52.480]  year. Children are being murdered. Oh and now more of the time. This is poor good people.
[11:52.480 --> 12:04.280]  I pause again. I want to be able to lay more of the sound here. But again this is Hollywood
[12:04.280 --> 12:08.360]  that glorifies the mass shootings that pushes the gun culture. This is Kimmel that had a
[12:08.360 --> 12:17.520]  BB gun about a year and a half ago in his studio audience and shot a BB that could put
[12:17.520 --> 12:32.520]  somebody's eye out into a jar of pickles into a glass jar of pickles. And here it is.
[12:32.520 --> 12:42.360]  The juice of these pickles is on you Alex Jones. Now again ladies and gentlemen when
[12:42.360 --> 12:46.000]  he was shooting the jar of pickles he was saying here's a message to you Alex Jones
[12:46.000 --> 12:53.680]  from the New World Order. Now they seize on every one of these opportunities and we need
[12:53.680 --> 12:58.040]  to get back on their face and tell them how dare you sit there and point your finger at
[12:58.040 --> 13:02.880]  American gun owners at American patriots. He just had a skit last week making fun of
[13:02.880 --> 13:08.480]  Christians. He just mixed in again. Oh you dirty Christians up there on Capitol Hill
[13:08.480 --> 13:14.320]  stuffing your pockets. Imagine if he said something like you dirty Jews up there on
[13:14.320 --> 13:19.320]  Capitol Hill stuffing your pockets. Or you dirty Muslims up there on Capitol Hill stuffing
[13:19.320 --> 13:25.760]  your pockets. Or you dirty Buddhists up there on Capitol Hill stuffing your pockets. But
[13:25.760 --> 13:32.240]  he sits there and says it because Christians are the bad guys. We're the people being targeted.
[13:32.240 --> 13:38.480]  Coming up in the next segment fake news lying about Florida shooter being member of white
[13:38.480 --> 13:44.760]  supremacist group not retracted even though it's admitted that that was all a complete
[13:44.760 --> 13:49.480]  hoax. Also the AP still running with it. Far left groups call for murdering Republicans
[13:49.480 --> 13:59.840]  as revenge for Florida shooting. Family says Florida shooter autistic may have been on
[13:59.840 --> 14:04.480]  medication. Of course aren't they always family members claim suspect was on medication deal
[14:04.480 --> 14:09.400]  with his emotional fragility reportedly introduced himself to thousands of people over the last
[14:09.400 --> 14:14.200]  few years as school shooter and said on YouTube he was going to go be a school shooter but
[14:14.200 --> 14:28.220]  the FBI said that wasn't important enough information. So that's all coming up. Now continuing
[14:28.220 --> 14:35.280]  ladies and gentlemen on the other side we will get into all of this and a lot more today.
[14:35.280 --> 14:44.120]  You can be absolutely assured of that. Just briefly here we are offering 50% off all of

[20:05.120 --> 20:24.000]  alex jones show
[20:24.000 --> 20:50.160]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[20:50.160 --> 21:00.000]  all right i've been really frustrated obviously there's been another mass shooting more dead
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.640]  young people makes me sick and i've been really upset as well as a lot of you have that we've
[21:04.640 --> 21:10.680]  had a lot of mainstream media fake news disinformation seizing on the tragedy to blame the basic
[21:10.680 --> 21:16.880]  rights of all americans and overturn the fundamental bedrock of our country we didn't have mass
[21:16.880 --> 21:24.320]  shootings like this sixty seventy years ago because people were not this immoral now there
[21:24.320 --> 21:29.400]  were cases of different gangsters and groups engaged in massacres and there were examples
[21:29.400 --> 21:35.840]  of federal troops killing native americans in mass and native americans killing towns
[21:35.840 --> 21:41.880]  people and villagers in mass so you've always had massacres and there were big battles out
[21:41.880 --> 21:48.920]  west and mormons accused of engaging in massacres and other settlers engaged in an accuser of
[21:48.920 --> 21:54.040]  massacres of mormons and i mean there have been plenty of massacres and pinkerton security
[21:54.040 --> 21:58.360]  men going in and Rockefeller security men going in even in the early nineteen hundreds
[21:58.360 --> 22:05.120]  and mowing down whole towns of gold miners and burning their and their towns to the ground
[22:05.120 --> 22:12.120]  and i mean there's so many famous cases of even the twenties of the u.s. military crushing
[22:12.120 --> 22:17.960]  world war one bonus strikers who camped out around the capitol building so massacres have
[22:17.960 --> 22:23.920]  always happened but generally they were state sponsored or between warring groups this modern
[22:23.920 --> 22:33.120]  thing of the copycat or the lone nut going out to climb up on top the ut tower that's
[22:33.120 --> 22:38.640]  about where you see the kickoff of that type of stuff in u.s. history in the nineteen sixties
[22:38.640 --> 22:44.000]  as i said this stuff wasn't going on until the late sixties and then accelerating the
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.940]  seventies peaking in the eighties and then now it's been flat and that's just the facts
[22:49.940 --> 22:56.880]  but still it doesn't make it okay but i've said this you've said this you know this if
[22:56.880 --> 23:01.000]  someone kills someone with a baseball bat or a knife and there's many people killed every
[23:01.000 --> 23:05.680]  year with blunt objects and knives as there are guns in fact many years more people are
[23:05.680 --> 23:14.320]  killed by knives and not just other objects then then then guns do we say ban knives well
[23:14.320 --> 23:19.320]  actually in the u.k. they've been trying to make you get a license now for butcher knives
[23:19.320 --> 23:25.800]  and cutlery it hasn't passed but they're trying to nationally ban butcher knives and other
[23:25.800 --> 23:31.000]  large knives because they have much higher knife crime there's in the u.k. and they would
[23:31.000 --> 23:37.080]  have quote gun crime that is crime where we're guns are used so it's the human mind is the
[23:37.080 --> 23:43.400]  problem and i know we all know that when we step back but when they get filled mud of
[23:43.400 --> 23:51.200]  the cia slash fbi on tv to cry about another one of god's children has died or when we
[23:51.200 --> 23:57.120]  get jimmy kimmel up there crying they have been instructed just like obama was to emotionally
[23:57.120 --> 24:03.080]  try to punch our buttons and i know as an audience you know that and you're aware of
[24:03.080 --> 24:10.680]  that and you fully get that what i'm getting at here is that a lot of people have gotten
[24:10.680 --> 24:15.560]  comfortable and believe that they're not going to get our guns when we've been one second
[24:15.560 --> 24:20.960]  to midnight many times and when they've already gotten many of our firearms rights curtailed
[24:20.960 --> 24:26.720]  in different areas of the country and it is the global u.n. policy to completely disarm
[24:26.720 --> 24:31.920]  individuals under the unity or small arms treaty that obama signed on to but that we
[24:31.920 --> 24:39.200]  have not ratified so this is serious and anybody that gets up there and blames gun owners or
[24:39.200 --> 24:46.760]  Christians like jimmy kimmel and others are doing is a bigoted lying sack of garbage jimmy
[24:46.760 --> 24:51.840]  kimmel and the democratic party funding the air of spring and funding the islamic takeover
[24:51.840 --> 24:59.560]  of much of the world they have blood on their hands on record and when they pointed us and
[24:59.560 --> 25:10.040]  say that we have blood on our hands it is asinine it is ridiculous hey america acid attack
[25:10.040 --> 25:17.600]  why don't you get stabbed band guns nail bomb goes off so then you'll be safe it's hit by
[25:17.600 --> 25:26.000]  a truck like us that's right just just ban trucks ban acid ban nail bombs ban knives
[25:26.000 --> 25:35.280]  that's a little emoji slash meme that was sent out today on twitter because if you look
[25:35.280 --> 25:43.360]  at the uk's crime they have the highest mugging and stabbing rate in the western world who
[25:43.360 --> 25:50.240]  has the lowest switzerland where everyone by law has to own a machine gun and they've
[25:50.240 --> 25:56.840]  got little armored bunkers scattered all over the country every few square miles full of
[25:56.840 --> 26:04.360]  anti tank guns missiles and high caliber firearms and hand grenades and that's why nobody invades
[26:04.360 --> 26:08.680]  there so there it is uk is one of the highest rates of acid attacks in the world police
[26:08.680 --> 26:15.840]  reveal only after pakistan but never will they say it's islamic connected i saw a story
[26:15.840 --> 26:22.960]  i didn't get to yesterday where a swedish police chief got suspended because he said
[26:22.960 --> 26:27.760]  look let's say it we have roving gangs of muslim men that have made us the rape capital
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.240]  of the world we had the lowest rape numbers before there's such an open nice society and
[26:32.240 --> 26:36.760]  we won't say it's groups of muslim men up to a hundred a time raping women they just
[26:36.760 --> 26:43.120]  grab it's it's insane and it's going on it's being covered up so the globalists hit us
[26:43.120 --> 26:49.480]  with the scourge of radical islam they bring it in to destabilize things and then they've
[26:49.480 --> 26:57.320]  got the nerve to point their finger at us every on average about every six months only been
[26:57.320 --> 27:02.840]  about i guess four months from vegas and you've got some new big mass shooting and behold
[27:02.840 --> 27:09.360]  behold vegas totally fake do we know exactly what happened no but we know he went to the
[27:09.360 --> 27:14.320]  middle east he was an arms dealer he had other people in the room we info wars broke
[27:14.320 --> 27:21.600]  all of this from fbi sources the day after and then other sources confirmed it of course
[27:21.600 --> 27:26.120]  we should now look at this new event and say okay if he did act alone he told everybody
[27:26.120 --> 27:30.320]  i'm the school shooter he wasn't allowed to bring a backpack to school before he was expelled
[27:30.320 --> 27:37.640]  last year and then all these witnesses say multiple shooters they're talking to him while
[27:37.640 --> 27:43.960]  the shots are going off and this is totally ignored i'm fighting to get any of these

[28:10.680 --> 28:15.000]  see what they were really being told and then we interviewed a student yesterday and he said
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.920]  oh yeah that's what other people were telling him it's not like it's one random person saying

[35:11.280 --> 35:15.320]  thousands of women and children sold into sex slavery and now that slavery has been
[35:15.320 --> 35:20.200]  reestablished in North Africa and areas of Middle East CNN has reports about it but never
[35:20.200 --> 35:26.480]  says it's Islamic so just remember that now we're leaving the phones open for at least
[35:26.480 --> 35:31.760]  a couple more segments for anybody from high school or friends or family to call in and
[35:31.760 --> 35:36.800]  give your testimony but we had one of the survivors on yesterday we played multiple clips
[35:36.800 --> 35:43.360]  that never made the local news but that were put on Twitter of local stations interviewing
[35:43.360 --> 35:53.360]  people reporting on multiple shooters and and seeing the supposed shooter Nicholas Cruz
[35:53.360 --> 35:58.800]  while other shots were going off and it appeared he wasn't involved he didn't have a firearm
[35:58.800 --> 36:06.120]  I mean that has got to be looked at ladies and gentlemen that is really gotta be looked
[36:06.120 --> 36:12.800]  at in a big big way and I'm impressed that the listeners are not calling in right now
[36:12.800 --> 36:17.920]  just leaving the phone lines open for anybody there at that high school everybody that had
[36:17.920 --> 36:22.360]  friends or family at the high school anybody that has specific first hand information to
[36:22.360 --> 36:27.480]  call in the number is 877-789 Alex and we'll leave that open for this segment the next
[36:27.480 --> 36:33.720]  then open the phones up to everybody in general 877-789 Alex Quentin Tarantino's father was
[36:33.720 --> 36:39.040]  scheduled to be on today and I'm seeing if I can move him to the third hour because there's
[36:39.040 --> 36:43.480]  just so much news breaking on this front he contacted me and we looked it up that it is
[36:43.480 --> 36:49.120]  his father and has his own production company this is for Quentin began to get into it himself
[36:49.120 --> 36:57.160]  but they they're estranged and he wanted to respond his son's statements on Howard Stern
[36:57.160 --> 37:01.520]  saying that Roman Polanski having sex with a 13 year old girl was no big deal he wanted
[37:01.520 --> 37:05.720]  to respond to that and I was gonna see we can move him to one and they just told me
[37:05.720 --> 37:13.120]  there they typed it on screen there that indeed the Tony Tarantino will be coming on the broadcast
[37:13.120 --> 37:20.440]  World War two veteran you name it and the stuff he told us off air about Quentin and
[37:20.440 --> 37:25.840]  about some of these issues and why Quentin thinks that's normal for children to have
[37:25.840 --> 37:32.720]  sex with adults is to say the least very very horrifying so Tarantino Productions is
[37:32.720 --> 37:40.280]  his site and he's been in film productions before Quentin was born and this is this is
[37:40.280 --> 37:46.600]  gonna we need to look into the mind of one of the main confidants of Harvey Weinstein
[37:46.600 --> 37:51.600]  understand how Quentin Tarantino got so twisted so that is going to be coming up now he's
[37:51.600 --> 37:55.000]  agreed to move to the third hour Alex Newman of the New American magazine we're gonna move
[37:55.000 --> 38:00.440]  him to another day obviously as all this unfolds I'll be back this Sunday Lord willing four
[38:00.440 --> 38:05.080]  to six p.m. central standard time with the Sunday transmission and we will have open
[38:05.080 --> 38:15.280]  phones next hour as well okay I got news a couple weeks ago and then I got it again last
[38:15.280 --> 38:23.720]  week and I got it again Monday from high-level sources and when I say high-level sources
[38:23.720 --> 38:31.800]  and you get information from this high-level and you're gonna announce stuff like this
[38:31.800 --> 38:40.520]  on here I meant to cover a few days ago and I just couldn't bring myself to even discuss
[38:40.520 --> 38:50.000]  it or even talk about it because it's so fraught with issues and it's so concerning and it's
[38:50.000 --> 38:58.040]  so real that one does not feel like they're worthy to cover it but it's like a surgeon
[38:58.040 --> 39:04.120]  even the best surgeons a lot of times don't want to do a surgery because they don't think
[39:04.120 --> 39:08.920]  they can fix the problem I was told that by top surgeon yesterday I waited years to get
[39:08.920 --> 39:14.040]  my Achilles that was ruptured fixed it just grew back as they do when they're ruptured
[39:14.040 --> 39:18.840]  on its own deformed and weakened and he just said I don't think I can I don't think I can
[39:18.840 --> 39:25.560]  make it better because you didn't get it fixed up front and so he here he is board certified
[39:25.560 --> 39:30.720]  one of the top guys in the state and he was honest he said you can probably somebody else
[39:30.720 --> 39:35.000]  to do it he says if you really want me to I can get in there and cut it shorten it and
[39:35.000 --> 39:41.520]  do some other stuff but it's already stretched out and it's it healed but but it healed deformed
[39:41.520 --> 39:50.560]  and it's what kind of wobbles around my leg does the pimp walk is not intentional and
[39:50.560 --> 39:55.040]  it's kind of like the surgeon just doesn't want to do the surgery because he just doesn't
[39:55.040 --> 40:00.280]  think he can probably fix it right and I respect that because a lot of doctors will do it regardless
[40:00.280 --> 40:04.280]  he's had me sign the waiver forms that's why I try to go to the best and it's kind of
[40:04.280 --> 40:10.160]  the same allegory or the same parallel as to what I'm about to cover when we come back
[40:10.160 --> 40:26.360]  after this break and it's not that I'm at loss for words I have asked through a couple
[40:26.360 --> 40:37.760]  phone calls to different sources why I'm being given this information and some of these sources
[40:37.760 --> 40:43.440]  have given us info before it's been very very accurate and another one of the sources is
[40:43.440 --> 40:49.160]  a very very credible source and was meeting with the deputy director of a major intelligence
[40:49.160 --> 40:58.080]  agency recently and was told this information and I gather they won't be specific but yes
[40:58.080 --> 41:03.600]  I they want me to know it and want me to tell you this and then the media probably won't
[41:03.600 --> 41:09.760]  even pick the subject so hardcore that's fine I just can't even get answers to this and they
[41:09.760 --> 41:17.480]  don't really have answers and so I will attempt as best I can we come back to get into this
[41:17.480 --> 41:25.520]  it deals with North Korea obviously and a date a week period that they have picked up
[41:25.520 --> 41:29.640]  chatter that North Korea is planning a strike and the fact that North Korea will be putting
[41:29.640 --> 41:33.320]  this type of chatter out well they put it out publicly and that's what makes me get
[41:33.320 --> 41:36.720]  a headache when I think about it but you guys pull me the stack of North Korea news from
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.120]  yesterday that I had you that I almost covered it then and the day before because I want
[41:41.120 --> 41:46.200]  to yeah I sit here and I say this for hours and I just want to try to figure out the best
[41:46.200 --> 41:54.000]  way to talk about it because this is the number one issue right now and while we're busy looking
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.960]  at the tragic school shooting and all the rest of it that's one drop in the bucket compared
[41:57.960 --> 42:02.440]  to what Islamists are killing right now or what GMO is killing right now or what Roundup
[42:02.440 --> 42:05.720]  is killing right now or what any of these big issues are so we're going to go to break
[42:05.720 --> 42:10.520]  and come back and cover this but bottom line everybody's be praying to God for justice
[42:10.520 --> 42:18.320]  and for awakening and for peace but this is a very very serious time to be alive briefly
[42:18.320 --> 42:26.520]  we have 50% off at m4warstore.com on our best selling it's already our best selling product

[43:24.760 --> 43:28.520]  their patients but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred two
[43:28.520 --> 43:33.760]  hundred dollars for the formulae and I came up with our own formulae working with some

[45:05.000 --> 45:11.160]  Yes hi Alex first I just want to mention if people just go and try the products they will
[45:11.160 --> 45:16.600]  be ordering all the time I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's
[45:16.600 --> 45:21.480]  amazing in particular silver bullet I as soon as I start to feel like I get a little stick
[45:21.480 --> 45:26.120]  you know maybe like a little raspiness in my throat I drop some silver bullet and it
[45:26.120 --> 45:30.280]  like I'll still feel a little sick but it won't last as long and I just ordered the
[45:30.280 --> 45:35.000]  body the alpha power and the pollen block well let me just say something Victor it's
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.200]  people like you that then fund the whole operation because a very small percentage of people
[45:39.200 --> 45:42.960]  buy products and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products so thank you
[45:42.960 --> 45:47.520]  but when you mention the the silver bullet colloidal silver it's got thousands of reviews
[45:47.520 --> 45:52.400]  and 98% review it is our highest reviewed product because it is from the top lab in
[45:52.400 --> 45:55.880]  the country discounted high quality colloidal silver and it's not a silver bullet it's
[45:55.880 --> 46:01.240]  the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet not a group you develop living
[46:01.240 --> 46:05.520]  defense for us it took you over a year to do it why is this so good because people are
[46:05.520 --> 46:10.680]  actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most I mean I try to make
[46:10.680 --> 46:15.800]  sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but right
[46:15.800 --> 46:21.600]  now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that
[46:21.600 --> 46:27.000]  lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.600]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about all

[46:57.000 --> 47:03.480]  for all your work sir on this great product.
[47:03.480 --> 47:20.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:20.400 --> 47:49.600]  Okay here's the bottom line we have been in a state of war since 1950 with
[47:49.600 --> 47:58.680]  the dictatorship of North Korea we are now facing the third hereditary leader of the hermit
[47:58.680 --> 48:08.720]  kingdom as it is called the most backwards nightmarish corrupt starving authoritarian
[48:08.720 --> 48:15.760]  patriarchal communist nightmare that the left thinks is so cute and funny and that NBC and
[48:15.760 --> 48:23.640]  CBS and CNN and MSNBC have been have been defending and promoting and I want to be clear
[48:23.640 --> 48:28.760]  I don't want to have a war with the North Korean people I want to be clear I understand
[48:28.760 --> 48:35.880]  that they are casualties of this evil culturally spiritually physically mentally that said
[48:35.880 --> 48:41.160]  they're being used as a detonator by the communist Chinese and others to project power destabilization
[48:41.160 --> 48:58.720]  into the South China Sea and now North Korea has been threatening for a long long time
[48:58.720 --> 49:14.400]  to attack Japan to attack South Korea to attack the United States the list goes on and on
[49:14.400 --> 49:18.920]  now they have atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs thanks to Clintons the communist Chinese and
[49:18.920 --> 49:24.280]  others that gave them the reactors the technology the missile secrets the rocket secrets the
[49:24.280 --> 49:31.000]  engines now they finally gotten better engines out of Ukraine from our allies not the Russians
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.880]  and so things are deteriorated and they've been kicking the can down the road as the
[49:33.880 --> 49:38.280]  president said it's at the end of the road and North Korea is now saying we will preemptively
[49:38.280 --> 49:42.400]  strike you we will kill you we will destroy you well when someone points a gun at you
[49:42.400 --> 49:48.160]  and says we will attack you we will destroy you we will kill you you have a right when
[49:48.160 --> 49:51.600]  somebody's pointing a gun at you to pull your gun and take them out I don't want that to
[49:51.600 --> 49:55.360]  happen I don't want to bring the communist Chinese in or the Russians this is how you
[49:55.360 --> 50:01.040]  could in the world but if North Korea attacks Seoul or North Korea attacks Japan those are
[50:01.040 --> 50:07.400]  our allies and civilization starts ending real quick these will be drawn into those
[50:07.400 --> 50:12.560]  wars and that's how conventional war they believe within hours will lead into a full
[50:12.560 --> 50:25.960]  out war now that said I have talked to the personnel and the individuals at the highest
[50:25.960 --> 50:32.160]  levels highest levels below the president and then at the levels where people would
[50:32.160 --> 50:38.240]  actually be attempting to go in on suicide missions to kill Kim Jong-un and so a lot
[50:38.240 --> 50:43.640]  of what I'm saying is publicly available information but I have repeatedly been told by different
[50:43.640 --> 50:48.600]  sources this and then ask why I'm not talking about it on air because they know the military
[50:48.600 --> 50:53.800]  and the general public that's thinking is listening and so the highest levels of multiple
[50:53.800 --> 51:01.600]  U.S. intelligence agencies want you to know this North Korean chatter and preparations
[51:01.600 --> 51:07.640]  both from human intelligence and signals states that North Korea is at this time planning
[51:07.640 --> 51:19.920]  a preemptive strike against Japan Tokyo with ICBMs starting in the last two days of March
[51:19.920 --> 51:27.440]  going into April 2nd so anywhere within that four or five day period and that everyone
[51:27.440 --> 51:33.520]  especially families of armed service members should not be traveling and should not be
[51:33.520 --> 51:37.720]  leaving the United States during that period and because they don't want to officially
[51:37.720 --> 51:41.600]  put that announcement out they want that announcement put out to this audience because
[51:41.600 --> 51:52.320]  you are seen as the most awaited patriotic Americans end of that message continuing
[51:52.320 --> 51:57.080]  as other sources have pointed out that the SpaceX launch of a month ago not the recent
[51:57.080 --> 52:04.680]  one the most recent was carrying some type of high tech electromagnetic pulse warhead
[52:04.680 --> 52:09.240]  or warheads that could take out North Korea preemptively and Trump has said that's on
[52:09.240 --> 52:14.800]  the table there's a lot of other secretive weapons in the whole fire and fury arsenal
[52:14.800 --> 52:20.080]  but that North Korean chatter is not also just that they're planning a preemptive strike
[52:20.080 --> 52:24.280]  what you hear them saying will attack you any day we will destroy you the whole U.S.
[52:24.280 --> 52:28.400]  will be fired soon we're going to hit you that's a promise I mean I've got the stacks
[52:28.400 --> 52:33.160]  of articles you've all heard it seen it out of their official but when it's internally
[52:33.160 --> 52:37.680]  going on and they're saying that over the radio to their military maybe their country
[52:37.680 --> 52:40.440]  is about to collapse a lot of evidence shows they want to make the military think they're
[52:40.440 --> 52:44.160]  in such a crisis they stay at their post because the food's running out or whatever I don't
[52:44.160 --> 52:49.640]  know and no one really does outside of Kim Jong Un's insane brain but they're telling
[52:49.640 --> 52:55.120]  them that we are preparing the strike we are preparing we are preparing the the the the
[52:55.120 --> 53:01.640]  first strike we are preparing be ready by March 28th we will launch the attack by April
[53:01.640 --> 53:10.320]  2nd so North Korea is saying that they're going to attack in the last few days of March
[53:10.320 --> 53:16.240]  into the first few days of April and then North Korea is publicly saying warning Trump
[53:16.240 --> 53:21.600]  very close for him to strike decision I mean World War 3 vet threat so both sides are saying
[53:21.600 --> 53:27.080]  this back and forth and then here's the other part you've all heard about EMPs and North
[53:27.080 --> 53:31.080]  Korea is threatened to hit the U.S. with an EMP and I think some of that threat's overplayed
[53:31.080 --> 53:34.480]  unless they hit like Los Angeles that would cause a chain reaction of power plants going
[53:34.480 --> 53:37.880]  out that could knock out large parts of the country and could take months or years to
[53:37.880 --> 53:41.760]  get them back on because it's already so tenuous you see what happens with a few ice storms
[53:41.760 --> 53:45.680]  that only knock down a fraction of the power lines it causes sometimes months of outages
[53:45.680 --> 53:54.960]  and areas but the highest levels of Pentagon the highest levels of the CIA they are telling
[53:54.960 --> 54:01.600]  people who've been in for decades and never heard anything like this that North Korea
[54:01.600 --> 54:08.360]  is launching an attack by the end of March early April and that we have to then be ready
[54:08.360 --> 54:12.720]  to defend against it and that we may strike them first and again I don't want to get on
[54:12.720 --> 54:18.840]  air as a family man or this is a human period and say things like this that in any way escalate
[54:18.840 --> 54:24.800]  things but Kim Jong Un's already doing it and everything they're saying in the news
[54:24.800 --> 54:29.560]  is what I'm getting from behind the scenes and that they just hope this is some weird
[54:29.560 --> 54:37.080]  bluster internally to their forces but they've told their population roughly 20% of it's
[54:37.080 --> 54:42.680]  the military one of the largest training armies in the world though it's somewhat stone age
[54:42.680 --> 54:47.440]  most of them are on foot but they do have ICBMs they do have chemical weapons they do
[54:47.440 --> 54:53.880]  have tens of thousands of large artillery and they could destroy South Korea very quickly
[54:53.880 --> 54:59.480]  and especially the capital Seoul they could attack Japan but I mean they are reportedly
[54:59.480 --> 55:05.720]  sending out communications that they are intending a first strike and I have asked that's why
[55:05.720 --> 55:11.120]  I waited about a week or more so I'm getting these these these in-person meetings and phone
[55:11.120 --> 55:23.360]  calls and other messages why am I being asked to say this to the public and it's just we're
[55:23.360 --> 55:30.080]  just want your audience to know so you sit there and you gauge that however you want
[55:30.080 --> 55:36.320]  but that's real information whatever's meant by it gives me a headache even trying to figure
[55:36.320 --> 55:40.480]  it out and I don't think the people give me the info they don't know either but some of
[55:40.480 --> 55:48.400]  these sources of the type of sources that say I just talked to the hostage rescue team
[55:48.400 --> 55:51.680]  there and this is what happened and this is what's unfolding and he went to the mentally
[55:51.680 --> 55:55.200]  he's a gun dealer and the Saudis were in town and blah blah and then later it all comes
[55:55.200 --> 56:02.320]  out and then I get a call from the hostage rescue team source saying go ahead and go
[56:02.320 --> 56:06.800]  with it and the media makes jokes about it even though you can go back and see that turned
[56:06.800 --> 56:11.920]  out to be accurate so this is it from the FBI hostage rescue team this is from way up
[56:11.920 --> 56:22.040]  above that in the meeting rooms with the satellites and all the people and everything and then
[56:22.040 --> 56:28.840]  it's just relayed and people say what am I supposed to do with that well tell certain
[56:28.840 --> 56:35.240]  people and tell them this and people don't ask why they say yes sir and then I'm giving
[56:35.240 --> 56:42.280]  the information so quite a time to be alive ladies and gentlemen we should be praying

[56:47.720 --> 56:52.000]  exist the absence of nuclear war doesn't mean it exists the longer we push it back
[56:52.000 --> 56:57.880]  statistically the better a chance it'll finally happen until they're eradicated and I'm not
[56:57.880 --> 57:00.520]  even saying eradicated because they want the UN to be the only ones that have the nukes

[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:29.760]  got a drug siren we're in a post on the info to info wars dot com and I've got some big
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:36.080]  breaking news on North Korea but we've got a Mueller indicts 16 Russians so that's how
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:39.360]  he intends to hopefully get somebody to make something up against Trump we knew that was
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.880]  coming to get Roger Stone here ASAP he's here at the office right now I'm former head of
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.520]  the Trump campaign so we got a rare drug siren going let's go to this report though because
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:53.400]  he lays it all out with the second amendment Tucker psychiatric drugs social alienation
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:59.200]  broken families war on men more relevant than gun control and he's dead on here it is decent
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.000]  person is horrified by what happened yesterday in Parkland every thoughtful person knows
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.520]  something horrible is going on in American society tragedies like this happen for a reason
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.560]  and it probably doesn't have a lot to do with guns percentage of American households with
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:18.640]  firearms has dropped dramatically over the past 35 years meanwhile the number of mass
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.480]  shootings has risen if you're over 40 you did not grow up in a country like this so
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.320]  the question is what happened it could be a lot of things far more Americans than ever
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.760]  before take psychiatric medications are outbursts of violence of potential side effect we don't
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:39.880]  know but it's possible does the social atomization of modern society play a role in all this spending
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:45.000]  life online does cause alienation we know that last week we interviewed author Johan
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.560]  Hari who has studied the dramatic rise of depression in this country as he pointed out
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:55.480]  the most common answer to the question how many close friends do you have is now zero
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:00.720]  lack of meaningful relationships does cause despair perhaps in rare cases it drives some
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:06.240]  to mass murder meanwhile the nuclear family has collapsed nationwide does a generation
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.480]  of boys growing up without father's pose a threat to this country of course it does
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.520]  why wouldn't it fatherlessness is one feature common to many mass shooters nobody surprised
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:21.520]  by that and what about men more broadly as a group men are not thriving in this country
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.700]  right now ignore the propaganda and there's a lot of it and instead look at the numbers
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:30.040]  men kill themselves more graduate less and of course commit pretty much a hundred percent
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:35.640]  of mass shootings it's a disaster which for some reason our elites persist in ignoring
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.320]  in march the show begin a month long series every wednesday on what is happening to men
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:45.120]  we hope it will be interesting but why haven't we been talking about this for years we're
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:50.720]  not saying any of these factors cause the massacre we saw yesterday we don't know that
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.840]  we are saying we ought to do our honest best as a nation to figure out what exactly is
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.920]  going on here but we're not doing that that vital conversation has been drowned out and
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:05.320]  made impossible by mindless screeching about gun control led by blustery charlottes in
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.600]  the media you know exactly who they are and also in congress whose only real agenda is
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:14.600]  moral preening they aren't trying to solve the problem their aims are darker than that
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.440]  press a little bit and you'll see it sensible gun reforms you hear that phrase a lot you
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:23.480]  heard it all day today on cable news what does that mean sensible gun reforms banning
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:30.760]  bump stocks no a piece on vox.com today calls for a landmark gun control bill like the one
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:35.720]  australia passed 22 years ago in 1996 that's the law that liberals are always telling you
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:41.520]  about but the australian law wasn't gun control and it wasn't a voluntary buy back no matter
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.400]  what they tell you it was gun confiscation a wholesale mandatory disarmament of the
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:53.040]  entire civilian population imagine what would happen if you tried that here in this country
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.640]  america is not australia for a bunch of reasons including our history and our bill of rights
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.480]  imagine federal officials marching from house to house seizing hundreds of millions of firearms
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:08.080]  from law abiding citizens and then finding and imprisoning those who resist vox approvingly
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:14.120]  calls this leadership in fact it's a recipe for bloodshed and civil war it's nuts yet
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:19.640]  it is a common fantasy on the left dan fifer was a senior advisor to barack obama now he's
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.960]  a contributor at cnn of course last fall fifer wrote an article attacking his fellow democrats
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:30.320]  for what he bluntly called fake moderation on guns his advice was this stop pretending
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:36.120]  to respect the constitution and instead focusing on appointing judges who will nullify it the
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:42.560]  goal gun seizures ammunition regulation the disarmament of the american population a country
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:48.080]  where only the people in charge have guns and everybody else obeys in the wake of yesterday's
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:58.560]  shooting fifer's peace is going viral on the left what he wrote is what they believe
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:05.200]  top scientist and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:12.160]  water supply that are making us fat sick and stupid so what do we do about it well for

[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:12.280]  Let's be about that. He's that man's director of this country. There's a guy on the radio. His name is Alex Jones
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.580]  Alex Jones
[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:17.280]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones for example
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:23.280]  Time to stop submitting a misterity. It's time to realize that we're being enslaved. I heard that on Alex Jones
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:28.280]  Info wars went even further. Info wars. It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:32.280]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war

[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.280]  Info wars
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.280]  I got a chair going
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:54.280]  Looking at widely reported information from Info wars
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.280]  Info wars
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:58.280]  I want freedom
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.280]  That's what I want
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.280]  And that's what you should want
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.280]  Hello, this is Hank Hill
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.280]  And I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex Jones
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:23.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are well into the second hour broadcasting worldwide
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:30.280]  And it just broke on DrudgeReport.com one of the big epic sirens going there
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:34.280]  Mueller indicts 16 Russians and I've got the indictment here in my hands
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:38.280]  We'll be going over it for you right now here live
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:43.280]  Now again, he can only indict two people so far
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:47.280]  Not for Russian collusion but for making false statements to the FBI
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:51.280]  This being the same special division of the FBI created by the Clintons and others
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.280]  That covers up for their crimes
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:09:00.280]  But now they're just going to go after Russians they claim were involved in the elections
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:08.280]  It was actually Russians giving fake intel to Hillary and then she was paying money via Fusion GPS
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.280]  And getting money from Uranium One by the tens of millions of dollars
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:15.280]  But oh, let's see if they're in there
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:23.280]  Russians indicted in special counsel's probe for operations allegedly supporting Donald Trump in the election
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.280]  Ah, nothing to do with Hillary
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:33.280]  The special counsel's office said Friday the federal grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.280]  That's a swamp out of the seat at that
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:40.280]  Now remember they had the lady running against Putin funded by Soros go to the prayer meeting last week
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.280]  And said that she was there for Trump because she is foreign
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.280]  Even though it's the opposite
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:49.280]  So who knows, they could be in guiding their own people who then make stuff up
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:57.280]  The special counsel's office said Friday the federal grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.280]  In the probe into interference in the 2016 elections
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:06.280]  The indictment says that the defendants allegedly by early to mid 2006
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:09.280]  When they started the giant wiretaps they said didn't exist
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:15.280]  We're supporting the presidential campaign of then candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaging Hillary Clinton
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:21.280]  You can have all the other foreign governments in the UN and the Pope involved in our election in Saudi Arabia
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.280]  But they're saying they can even prove these Russians were involved trying to help Trump
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:28.280]  That's Russian collusion, not that Trump was involved, see how that works
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:36.280]  An announcement from the special counsel Robert Mueller's office said that the government accuses all the defendants of conspiracy to defraud the United States
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:39.280]  Three defendants are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.280]  And bank fraud, five defendants are charged with aggravated identity theft
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:49.280]  So they're going to, oh my gosh, you can see it now, oh, some of them might have been staying here illegally
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.280]  Not like your maid might be here illegally and gave you a fake Social Security number
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:59.280]  And they might have wired money wrong, I mean that just is the telltale signs
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.280]  And then here is the indictment, it's now up on infowars.com
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:07.280]  The United States of America, that means the Clinton crime syndicate
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:15.280]  You should scratch that out, but Clinton crime ink versus who knows
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:19.280]  And then it just goes into it here
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:24.280]  The United States of America, don't you love how that's who this guy supposedly is
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:32.280]  And then you go through all these concord catering, oh, I bet the Russians tried to get catering business
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:39.280]  Oh my gosh, concord management and consulting
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:48.280]  And you start reading this, oh yes, they're saying they had social media accounts that weren't in their proper names
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.280]  They're calling that wire fraud now
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:57.280]  See, I mean, wow, this is, man, I thought it was like meeting with Trump with a suitcase of money
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:04.280]  No, no, no, defendants also use the stolen identities of real U.S. persons to post to an organization controlled social media accounts
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:10.280]  Over time, the social media accounts became defendants' means to reach significant numbers of Americans
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:15.280]  So they're going to claim that these guys said they were somebody else
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:20.280]  You mean like Facebook, Twitter and Google and all the government bots?
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.280]  Wow
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.280]  Certain defendants travel the United States under false pretenses with the purpose of collecting intelligence
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:34.280]  Oh, so again, lied on visas to inform defendants' operations
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:42.280]  Defendants also procured and used computer infrastructure, used partly in the United States to hide the Russian origin of their activities to avoid detecting
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.280]  I mean, this is nothing
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:50.280]  Oh my gosh, some Russians came here and had some social media accounts, man, this is just bombshell
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.280]  And I'm reading this
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:13:02.280]  It said they tried to do business with other U.S. companies not revealing they were Russians
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.280]  What?
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.280]  And as they said, obtained visas through false and fraudulent statements
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.280]  That's it
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:18.280]  You can read the cover thing and see that, wow
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:23.280]  And it says starting in 2014, the defendants together
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:27.280]  Tried to do business in the United States
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:33.280]  I'm reading this, there's just nothing here and you normally put it right up front
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:41.280]  So they tried to get contracts for food catering
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:49.280]  Project Lakota had multiple components, some involving domestic audiences with the Russian Federation
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:54.280]  Others targeting foreign audiences in various countries, including the United States
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.280]  So again, like trying to communicate with the Internet, that's espionage
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:03.280]  The organization monthly budget for the project, 73 million Russian rubles
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:08.280]  Or 1 million towards $50,000 including approximately 1 million rubles in bonus payments
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:14.280]  To conceal its involvement, Concorde labeled the monies paid to the organization for project Lakota
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.280]  Payments revealed the software support development
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:21.280]  And again, the way they can even make that sound is you got sub companies and stuff, oh, it's criminal
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:26.280]  And then it just goes through all this, I mean, this is a nothing burger
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:31.280]  But I'm just reading this here, on air
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.280]  They had data analysis for marketing
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:42.280]  Oh my gosh, this is just ridiculous
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:47.280]  They had a translator project tempted to travel the United States under false pretenses
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:51.280]  So they're saying somebody lied on a visa
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:58.280]  I mean, you're not even supposed to get a visa to come to the US, supposed to be wide open according to the left
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:07.280]  Served on the translator project and operated multiple US personas that she used to post, monitor and update social media content
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:12.280]  So it looks like an ad agency for catering
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.280]  Well, there you go
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.280]  Looks like they were selling some ham sandwiches
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.280]  They always said you can indict a ham sandwich
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:23.280]  Object of the conspiracy
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:29.280]  The conspiracy had as its object in pairing, obstructing and defeating the lawful governmental functions of the United States by dishonest means
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:35.280]  In order to enable the defendants to interfere with the US political electoral process
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.280]  Well, this is amazing, ladies and gentlemen
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.280]  And you heard, you know, Tucker Carlson they say must be a Russian agent too
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.280]  Because he says he's not a Russian agent
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:52.280]  And if you say or not, you must be, and Rand Paul didn't want to bomb Russian forces in Syria
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:54.280]  McCain said you're a Russian agent
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:16:23.280]  We'll be back

[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:21.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:28.280]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:39.280]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. We're going to have Roger Stone and Owen Schreuer with us in the next segment
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:47.280]  Responding to Robert Mueller's latest attack on the election of President Trump in 2016, now 15 months ago
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:54.280]  He's indicted people for process, not for Russian collusion, for supposedly giving false statements to the FBI
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:21:01.280]  Which shouldn't even be a federal law, it's totally unconstitutional, it's all up to them and their belief that you've done that
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:05.280]  And then of course the FBI gets constantly caught lying, covering up evidence, planning evidence
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:12.280]  I mean it's just biblical, especially the different political groups within it connected to the Clintons
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:20.280]  And now they've indicted 16 Russians for running social networks and catering and some other stuff
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:25.280]  So we're going to have all of that coming up with the latest details
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:31.280]  We also have a Highland College on lockdown for shots fired, we'll watch that as that unfolds
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:36.280]  Several police agencies are responding to the Highline Community College campus report of shots fired
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:42.280]  Over no shooting at the college has been confirmed, and I just hope there aren't any copycats with what we've been seeing
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:48.280]  As we normally do with any type of mass shooting, with the mass shooting in Florida
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:57.280]  Deputies called to his home 39 times, FBI botched the case, YouTube professional school shooter was his name
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:04.280]  Video wasn't a strong lead, the FBI said shooter calls for power to detain over post
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:09.280]  He was on meds, emotionally fragile, that's an M4Wars.com article
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:16.280]  Demon voices he was hearing, he arrived in an Uber, threats, hoaxes, anxiety, arrest, uneasiness
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:22.280]  Grip schools, sells a bulletproof backpack, soar, by the way we sell those M4Wars.com
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:26.280]  Everybody really should have one, they're very lightweight and they're a good shield
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:30.280]  That's from Infidel Body Armor, and also we have several other great brands
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:38.280]  Florida Student's Grandfather survived, 1949 School Massacre, Media Blamed Trump, Kimmels as President mentally ill
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:45.280]  Facebook group says Murder Republicans, and that's another M4Wars.com article right there
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:51.280]  That's on the top of Drudge, right there at the bottom of the top links
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:59.280]  And I'll go ahead and cover that report right now before we come back and get into the latest Mueller operations
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:06.280]  Far Left group calls for murdering Republicans as revenge for Florida school shooting
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:13.280]  And you saw Kimmels say it's Christians' faults, you dirty Christians, with money sticking out of your pockets
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:18.280]  And that was last night, dear crazed shooters, the GOP has frequent baseball practices
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:21.280]  Well we know one of your crazed shooters already did that
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:25.280]  The Far Left group of Facebook is calling for people to murder Republican lawmakers to support the NRA
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.280]  as revenge for Florida school shooting. The unhinged posts appear on Facebook called
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:37.280]  Milkshakes Against the Republican Party the hours after the massacre at the majority stoneman, Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:42.280]  Dear crazed shooters, the GOP has frequent baseball practices, you really want to be remembered
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:48.280]  That's how you do it, signed Americans tired of our political bathing and blood of the innocents
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:52.280]  who kill some more people, right, for a few million dollars from the terrorist organization NRA
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.280]  States the post that goes on from there
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.280]  This is even bigger, also another in FullWars.com story
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:06.280]  Fake news lie about Florida shooter being member of the white supremacist group
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:10.280]  Turns out AP and others totally lied, no one ever said that, it wasn't true
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:18.280]  He hadn't paramilitary trained at the group, but all the leftist media including the AP ran with it
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:23.280]  and they're not retracting even though other newspapers have
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:26.280]  So there you go ladies and gentlemen
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:32.280]  Meanwhile our story by Don Salazar is very lengthy, very detailed on DrudgeReport.com
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:39.280]  Again it's posted to NewsWars.com, family says Florida school shooter Autistic may have been on medication
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:44.280]  was hearing devils voices, had been on vacation, they think you may have gone off of it
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:50.280]  That's when you really know that the inserts say, especially if you go off it quickly, do not do that
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:56.280]  I had a girlfriend that was a couple months back in college, it was a lot of fun
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:02.280]  She was a nice girl, her dad was a doctor, and she was just so happy and so nice
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:06.280]  and she was on Prozac, actually on Prozac, never met anybody that's on the original Prozac
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:14.280]  She was on Prozac, and then she decided to go off of it
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:21.280]  and about two days later wasn't the sweet, giggly, bubbly, nymphomaniac anymore
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:27.280]  She was going to throw herself off her roof when I got the phone call
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.280]  and I said, I took care of her and got her to the family and everything
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.280]  and then I said, we're not going to date anymore sweetheart
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:37.280]  but that's what that, I didn't even really understand, she was on that stuff till later
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:43.280]  but they'll tell you, 99% of the time they pull up at some house and a woman's cut her kid's arms off
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:47.280]  or ground them in the bathtub or ribbon them off in a car in a lake or shot them
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:55.280]  cops walk in, open the pill box cabinet, medicine cabinet, and it is LuVox, it is
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:01.280]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors, it is there
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:04.280]  it's almost like, you don't even have to guess, it's just, you know it
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.280]  and that's why I called them suicide mass murder pills
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:13.280]  and those are still big advertisers on Fox and CNN and I don't want to criticize the entity
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.280]  but I have the clip, I didn't get to it yesterday
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.280]  just because I'm not going to go out of my way
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:22.280]  but when I was on Pierce Morgan 2013, they were going to have me off for a couple more segments
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.280]  but I talked about, you're the ones that have all these serotonin reuptake inhibitor pill ads
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:28.280]  mass murder pill ads, the insert doesn't matter
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.280]  and I saw them going cut, cut, they cut early to break, kicked me off, they were so pissed
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:37.280]  one of Hannity's people brought up the psychotropic drugs and everything
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:41.280]  and Hannity cut them off, now that's why I played that Tucker Carlson
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.280]  where he brought up the drugs
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:47.280]  so I guess Fox has got a better standard than CNN and does allow that kind of stuff to come out
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:56.280]  or I guess, I guess Tucker Carlson can do whatever he wants on Fox and that's a good thing
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:00.280]  and I really like Tucker
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:03.280]  Tucker saw it out come on my show some
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.280]  I guess getting his bottle feed is straight before he became Mr. Libertarian
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:08.280]  which is great, he's always been Libertarian
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.280]  but kind of became his true self a lot more hardcore than he was on CNN
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.280]  which I think is great and then I've asked him on a few times
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.280]  and he's like, eh Fox didn't let me, sorry, which is true
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:20.280]  like Napolitano used to want to come on, I used to go on his show and then they banned it
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:24.280]  and it's just like, you know, that's the news core folks
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:27.280]  because they want to control the Libertarian movement
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.280]  not just had the Libertarian movement control the country
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.280]  but I'm digressing, we'll come back with the big breaking news
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.280]  on the Russian indictment
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.280]  we've got 16 Russians indicted by Mueller
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.280]  it looks like we're having crooked toenails
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.280]  we'll have all the details for you on the other side of the quick break
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:48.280]  with Roger Stone and with Owen Schreuer
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:51.280]  but before we go there, just please don't forget

[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:23.280]  from Austin Texas Broadcasting Worldwide
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:27.280]  it's Alex Jones
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:33.280]  well remember about a month and a half ago the last big wave of fake news
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:38.280]  that they're desperate with only two indictments previously of US citizens for not being colluding with Russians
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:41.280]  but for supposedly giving false statements to the FBI about side issues
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:46.280]  those stories have all fallen apart as Russia Gate has been exposed to the Democratic Party operation
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:50.280]  but remember Bayhar when she announced General Flynn admits he's a Russian agent
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:54.280]  he's gonna testify they helped run the whole campaign yay we got him
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:56.280]  remember that
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.280]  breaking news
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.280]  oh my god
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:02.280]  oh breaking news ABC News Brian Ross is reporting
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:06.280]  Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:12.280]  and is prepared to testify that as a candidate Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:16.280]  yay we'll kill the economy our president's a traitor yay
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.280]  F America over
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:23.280]  yay I mean don't be horrible even if I hated Obama or something that came out of me like god this is horrible
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:27.280]  but at least we're cleaning it up it's totally made up the Clintons up their eyeballs
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:32.280]  so now Mueller can't find Trump his family he can't even get obstruction on them
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:37.280]  so now to have something this is face-faving it just hit me I'm a shroyer
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:41.280]  that they're gonna go out for low level Russians that were running catering services and online consulting
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:49.280]  and had and and and you know oh RT you know had some bots yeah because they got sold a ad package by Twitter
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:55.280]  that's what they come and advertise to you of what story to run that are popular in the US during the election you know
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:35:03.280]  so so that's all they've got so he's just desperately wanting to find something indicting 13 no-name Russians
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:09.280]  and three companies that are just beyond small potatoes you know you get the thing of french fries
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:13.280]  and you eat all the and then there's like little tiny burn bits at the bottom that are even worth eating
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:19.280]  I mean these are like a speck of a speck there's like I've read the indictment now almost all of it you've read over it
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:26.280]  but doesn't matter like you said oh and Twitter is like my god it's like oh we caught we caught we caught
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:32.280]  Trump you know Putin's wee wee holster you know we caught him in bed with Putin it's over yay
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:38.280]  well there's nothing even in this that I've seen that even mentions Trump other than these Russian bots
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:43.280]  they're saying on social media that are tweeting about Trump forming social media groups about Trump
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:47.280]  and we'll get to that in a second but think about the timing of this Alex they released it
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:52.280]  the week of the Florida shooting while the Florida shooting is dominating the media the Florida shooting
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:57.280]  is dominating everything the Democrats are freaking out and then they just insert this kind of in the back burner
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:03.280]  like oh yeah here's our Russian collusion here's the official document while everyone is still talking about the shooters
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:09.280]  and talking about the shooting so they released this intentionally I think while everyone was talking about the shooting
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:14.280]  so that nobody will actually dig into the nuts and bolts in this because it's nothing it's incredible
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:19.280]  if they're going to indict people I mean they did have Facebook and here on some catering
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:24.280]  but if they're gonna be indicting people over fake Facebook accounts I mean where are they going to stop
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:29.280]  there's about a hundred of them of me so that's what I'm saying so it's like how can you use this as an indictment
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.280]  or and look but see that's why they sent out hundreds of thousands of letters now saying you're all Russian bots
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:38.280]  and then even Twitter did a study and said these are real people these are not Russian bots
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:44.280]  no I've got the Russian collusion right here according to Mueller's indictment on April 6, 2016
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:49.280]  an expert from an excerpt from a Russian advertisement says you know a great number of black people
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:55.280]  support us saying that Hillary Clinton is not my president that was from a Russian bot that's Russian collusion
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:01.280]  that's their price April 7 here Alex April 7 I say no to Hillary Clinton I say no to manipulation
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:07.280]  that was paid for by Russian bot we've got him we've got him right here Alex we've got him on October 14
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:12.280]  we've got him right here in October 14th among all that document can please among among all candidates
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:18.280]  Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend all police from terrorists it's right there it's right there in the document
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:24.280]  and that means if these marketing companies piggybacked on anything else people were putting out
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:29.280]  the whole things of frauds that's what they say they say if any Russian marketing of any type
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.280]  is connected to anything even though they admit it's less than 1% of the internet activity
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:40.280]  the truth is the Russians are not good at this what about Hollywood what about the big Hollywood firms admitted
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:46.280]  they created over 100 fake news accounts and flooded the web with fake news against Trump and against America
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:53.280]  last night my son wanted to watch TV we turned on Netflix I never look at hardly ever and it was it was like
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:38:00.280]  I've seen 10 different documentaries in here about Trump being a shyster and so I watched one of my son last night
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:06.280]  and it was all made up crap I mean it's like you you know he's good because Hollywood everybody hates him
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:12.280]  and then exactly tell people what page that's on because this is where they show this is on page 20 of 37
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:18.280]  this shows the total devil but you know I wanted to do a joke video where a news van pulls up almost
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:23.280]  we're to hire like real reporters who is a joke and they run here and there's a guy's like a little bot outfit
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:29.280]  they're like a little red red carry out they're going beep beep beep beep beep beep and you like knock the door open
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:35.280]  and like zero it's me beep beep beep beep beep beep it's like our Russian bot coming to tell us what to do
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:42.280]  so yeah there's the page right there that has but but Alex I say no to Hillary Clinton join our Hillary Clinton
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:49.280]  for prison I created Hillary for prison 2016 literally Russian and you can probably find the date that we started
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:54.280]  that was before any of these there these tweets that they're no no we've been we've been selling that shirt
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:58.280]  but they were all we've been selling that shirt for like six months before that watch out Alex they're going to die next
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:04.280]  Donald wants to defeat terrorism Hillary wants to sponsor well that was us saying that vote Republican vote
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:09.280]  Trump support the Second Amendment oh my god this oh they even said the Second Amendment is now Russian
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:15.280]  I've seen newscast yeah they say they say oh Washington Post that was that was that was two weeks ago that was Schiff
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:21.280]  he said the Second Amendment's a Russian plot there's a press conference no I know the Washington Post published it
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:27.280]  here here here go back to this go back to this Hillary Clinton doesn't deserve the black vote that's Roger Stone
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:31.280]  that's exposing you know how she said blacks aren't human we said that a year before that
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:35.280]  Trump he noticed all these are our talking points it's all us because we're vicious after we said it
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.280]  Trump is our only hope for a better future so if anything we're influencing
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:45.280]  oh look hashtag Hillary for Prison I sat there over two years ago in that office
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:51.280]  you didn't build it and I said hashtag Hillary for Prison I created that you you didn't
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:56.280]  I you did I created that you that's me you didn't start that hashtag you didn't start that business
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:59.280]  well she gave me the credit before she said I'm a dark evil heart and I came up with it
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:04.280]  no I think we cannot trust Hillary Clinton to take care of our veterans I think that's just who said that the truth
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:09.280]  among all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend the police from terrorists
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.280]  well remember that was a black lives matter and the CNN was saying cops deserve to die remember
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:19.280]  Hillary is a Satan well I mean I'm the one who said that and her crimes and lies had proved just how
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:24.280]  evil she is I guess these are Alex Jones quotes I believe let's keep rolling down here
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:29.280]  Russian this is it they're gonna say Alex Jones is Russian from Russian stealing your talking points
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:34.280]  if that but here's the other thing Alex what they do is they try to trick you
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:38.280]  or if you just read the introduction they're like oh well various social media accounts
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:44.280]  and then bank fraud and wire fraud and then you get into it the only bank fraud was Russians
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:50.280]  allegedly according to this stealing US identities to make bank accounts to then pay for political
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:55.280]  advertisement so again nothing to do with Trump that's the bank's fault if there's by the way
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:00.280]  you've got you've got the EU you've got the Vatican you've got Obama telling foreigners to vote
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:05.280]  you've got Hillary Foundation getting billions of dollars let's bring Roger Stone in he's out on the road
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:08.280]  right now he's here in Austin but taking care of some business so he's not in studio with us
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:14.280]  Roger what in Toledo do you make of this because I mean I read much of the indictment I hadn't read
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:19.280]  the Alex Jones quotes and I'm not trying to take credit where it's not due most of these came directly
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:26.280]  out of my mouth a few of them out of yours so they're taking American talking points that we put out
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:31.280]  way before this these bots ever arrived these bots jumped on the bandwagon like anybody doesn't
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:37.280]  advertising that's what you do is hijack memes and then now this is the proof right Roger so Hillary
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:43.280]  is Hillary for prison 2016 isn't a t-shirt we sold a hundred thousand of that filled the RNC
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:49.280]  no it's a Russian bot Roger yeah where's the collusion where's the coordination and kind of
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:55.280]  conspiracy with the Trump campaign nowhere in this indictment this is meant to bolster Mueller sagging
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:00.280]  public relations I think people have caught on to the fact that he has nothing so he goes out and he
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:07.280]  indicts a bunch of low-level Russians yet where's the connection to the Trump campaign Trump's family
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:13.280]  Trump's campaign Trump's associates nothing he has none of that therefore by definition it reminds me
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:18.280]  of the old sandwich I could I could have a ham sandwich if I had some ham this guy has nothing
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:23.280]  and this just kind of proves it it's pathetic really well that's why I made the joke one of the

[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:42.280]  wars host of the war room along with roger we have on shorter here with us here is the
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:52.280]  big giant news breaking right now 16 russian entities 13 russians three russian entities
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:59.280]  have been indicted by robert meuller today we have gotten the indictment and in the indictment
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:10.280]  indicted for protesting against trump and then protesting for trump so there's your take
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:19.280]  away headline after trump was elected they are reportedly then running protest against
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:24.280]  trump and part of the trump before to yes before and after i mean i mean this is crazy
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:31.280]  it's on page 13 20 and 25 so i'm gonna say this again the russians that they've indicted
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:37.280]  are super low level catering companies and stuff little facebook pages they're claiming
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:43.280]  the russians created hillary for prison 2016 even though i created it in 2015 and sold
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:52.280]  right at 100,000 t-shirts that came out of my brain because i saw it painted in somebody's
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:59.280]  yard on a yard side and i said if somebody's painting that that is really smart and i i came
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:04.280]  on there and i popularize it not the darn russians but let's just stop right there i'm gonna say
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:13.280]  it again if you just joined us the meuller swap grand jury indictment of 13 russians
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:20.280]  and three companies and the headlines are for collusion with trump says that before the
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:25.280]  campaign ended and after the campaign ended when he was president elect the same russian
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:33.280]  group was out there protesting trump what in the world is going on here and i had heard
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:37.280]  trump talk about this like a year ago he said oh we've looked at this there's some of these
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:41.280]  little russian groups were actually protesting me so i guess he'd gotten the intel but i don't
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.280]  believe anything meuller says this just sounds like a huge cop out of meuller what do you
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.280]  think of this someone well i'm still trying to figure out the reason for this i don't
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:55.720]  understand the reasoning behind these russians apparently getting fake ids fake bank accounts
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:50:01.680]  and then funding these quote unquote campaigns if you want to call it this but yeah you had
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:07.800]  in november just after the presidential election you had the same defendants organizing a group
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:13.880]  called trump is not my president and then that was after the election before the election
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:20.080]  you had the same defendants in june creating an advertisement on facebook promoting the
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:25.960]  saying support hillary save american muslims and then again in july sounds like well i
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:30.680]  mean we know what they're doing we know these are entrepreneurs i've looked at their profile
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:36.720]  they're trying to hijack any top meme many of which we made to simply drive traffic to
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:43.800]  their sites so there you go all they're doing is opportunistically jumping on whatever
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:50.880]  is hottest from the left and the right it sounds like these are just mercenaries and
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:56.320]  apparently they're all over in russia so unless russia is going to extradite these people
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:02.560]  to the united states this indictment is about as useful as a roll of toilet paper i'll tell
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:06.560]  you what it is it's face saving this is just astonishing roger i remember you last year
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:11.520]  as well the memory serves you're always ahead of the curve months of nine years you talked
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:15.520]  about and i remember course he harped on this and more and more he's been proven right and
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:19.280]  i thought it was wrong when i first hired coursey over a year ago there was a good guy
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:24.420]  we should get coursey on right now folks or after our next guest is on with us and he
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:29.440]  kept saying alex there were some very small bots they were working for hillary we have
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:34.400]  huge leftist groups in in russia controlled by soros this is all a very elaborate scheme
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:38.880]  to embarrass trump these are actually leftist they were on both sides but only to make it
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:43.840]  look like they were for trump they gave three to one to hillary and i'd watch a lot of rt
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:48.440]  a lot of it was you know actually anti-trump pro hillary until he won the nomination what
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:53.560]  do you make of this this just sounds astounding roger stone yeah first of all the size of
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:59.520]  it you know within the context of a multi-billion dollar presidential campaign a couple thousand
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:04.240]  dollars worth of facebook or twitter posts is like urinating in the ocean it has no impact
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:10.440]  at all secondary let's recognize that loris and ivan who are maybe working for the russians
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:14.000]  but stationed in the united states have to tell their boss something to justify their
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.320]  expense accounts so if you read half these things i can't figure out what they were
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:22.800]  trying to achieve yeah there's some pro-trump messages there also seems to be a bunch of
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:31.000]  anti-trump messages impact zero so this is a public relations move miller knows that
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:37.160]  his public credibility is is waiting this is about the headline miller indicts russians
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:41.920]  as sadly half the people of america don't read beyond that they say oh trump's people
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:47.240]  must have gotten into trouble no there is no connection no coordination no collusion with
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:53.760]  anybody surrounding trump this is half a story but it does set a precedent if miller is going
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:58.840]  to indict foreign nationals for interfering in our elections when are the indictments
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:04.040]  of all the ukrainian nationals coming least ran hand has come on here in info wars and
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:09.480]  laid out chapter and verse the collusion of the ukrainian government to help illy clinton
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:15.840]  uh crimes far more egregious than what's outlined in this uh indictment so what are they being
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:20.360]  indicted you're absolutely right and here's the headline russians indicted in special
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:26.960]  counsel like see there are there in russians they're indicted and it's lying on who you
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:33.440]  are on social media lying to get visas or the democrats you shouldn't have to get visas
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:40.200]  you just come here yeah why are they so anti russian why are they so racist against russians
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:45.760]  seems a little strange roger where does this go from here well the other piece of news
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:53.560]  here is which i have not been able to confirm but reported by abc is that paul manifor associate
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:54:00.000]  rick gates uh has caught a plea deal is now cooperating with miller i still don't think
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:05.320]  that has any implications vis a vis russian collusion there's no russian collusion for
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:11.520]  gates to testify to because there wasn't any what it may do i think it was probably designed
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:18.560]  to do is to increase the pressure on manifor to bear false witness against the president
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:24.880]  in other words this may in some way bolster the indictments against manifor for crimes
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:31.760]  that are completely unrelated uh to uh russia or the trump campaign may not be crimes at
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:38.160]  all by the way uh but help bolster a case against him i guess i should say in an effort to pressure
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:43.280]  him into betraying the chief of staff that's not going to happen paul manifor it's not
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:49.720]  john dean he's not going to lie to satisfy miller whether gates has flipped or not now
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:55.120]  i don't know gates uh he was never an associate at the old black manifort in stone he joined
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:55:00.520]  manifor a long after manifor and i had split as business partners uh but i always thought
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:05.360]  he was kind of a weasley guy uh and i don't really know what this indictment means i don't
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:09.000]  think i don't think it poses any danger to the front where his assistant well let's talk
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  about something in the private conversation we had two weeks ago and you said you were
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:17.800]  ready to talk about it yesterday in studio but we never got to it uh you said that from
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:21.320]  your intel manon's always been a double agent you weren't sure of it until the middle of
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:25.600]  last year you warned me that was on record i didn't want to go with it on air i've apologized
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:29.160]  to you and everybody else for that i was a mistake i made just trying to be such a team
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:33.080]  player you can't be on the team with somebody that's a benedict arnold our judas is scary
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:38.320]  it uh and so that's a big big big big loss we have thanks to me and others but you know
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:44.440]  it it uh but you you said he's clearly working with mewler even though he wasn't ever involved
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:47.960]  the campaign during all this russia crap went on now it's admitted it's in the news today
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:52.880]  that uh now banon's gonna be the star witness to move forward and basically mewler's only
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:58.080]  hope you predicted this you've got intel what is it when we come back uh in about two minutes
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:02.240]  after this break uh and then we've got quentin tarantino's father coming on i'm not a gossip
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:07.640]  columnist but he is his father and quentin tarantino has been promoting basically pedophilia
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:13.160]  and so his father contacted us and laid some incredible info on us that fits in with everything
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:21.400]  we already know and um so we're we're gonna go there okay and uh we're gonna go there
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:26.600]  mr. tarantino uh with with his father and understand exactly why he goes on howards
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:31.160]  turn and says sex with children is okay if they if they're consenting that is the nambla
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:36.640]  creed so we're gonna cover that coming up for about 30 minutes and continue uh with uh

[02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:35.480]  and i was shroyer and of course roger stone so we're not trying to just strafe banan
[02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:39.400]  it's some ego thing uh we wanted to believe in him as this great man he was really just a
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:43.240]  hollywood screenwriter that took our liberty movement my words especially the others and
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:49.640]  twisted it into a conflagration to try to gain control but drudge and others smelled him out
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:55.320]  you smelled him out but you're not a backbiter in fodder like me so you didn't mess with him but
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:01:02.520]  now they're calling him the next golden boy this whole fake russia indictment thing of a ham sandwich
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:08.520]  and people that were actually attacking trump their own indictment admits just bizarre of low
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:15.080]  level nobodies i mean does this signal a face-saving end or as we're seeing in the news uh is the
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:20.440]  man riding on a white horse as the cavalry is the due sex going to be little baby banan
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:26.440]  well let me take this and break it down in two parts alex first of all i think one of the main
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:32.200]  reasons that muller popped this out today is because the indictment of general mike flinn is falling
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:39.400]  apart before his very eyes muller agreed to a stipulation for a protected order of protective
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:45.320]  order on the evidence surrounding flinn's indictment which is looking flimsier and flimsier i think
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:50.760]  there's a high probability that that the charges against flinn are going to get vacated and the
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:54.920]  judge in that case just recused himself and a new judge is in there too that's also significant
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:02:00.360]  roger exactly so i mean i think there's there's good news for that great american patriot mike flinn
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:06.280]  who i think was unfairly terminated and unjustly indicted he was the lynchpin he was the first
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:13.560]  domino to fall no question and that opened the doors for the globalists for hr mcmaster and
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:19.720]  general john kelly and others to get back inside the tent uh as far as muller is pardon me as far
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:26.040]  as banan is concerned my understanding is that he is now singing like a canary and he is attempting
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:33.320]  to impugn the president on business related things it's not it's not me too uh there's some
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:39.960]  speculation about that that he may have tall tales to tell about don trump and women uh that's not
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:45.720]  that at all uh i think the allegation is going to be that the president was trying to do personal
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:51.720]  business when he was you know had allegedly according to bannon recused himself from his
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:58.600]  business now my guess is most of this is trumped up president's way too smart for that plus if you
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:02.520]  actually read presidential power you're allowed to keep doing your private business as president
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:09.560]  well i mean uh the bannon is like a spurned lover you know he's like a scorned scorned
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:16.680]  bloated tart whore uh you know who dresses out of a dumpster uh he looks like a psychotic
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:23.160]  man and who needs to be introduced to open water no look this is it's very strange because the
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:29.000]  president gave this guy the highest possible honor you can have in our business i mean a white
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:34.360]  house job is is is that's a pinnacle of success and he made his chief strategist and then he
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:39.720]  could proceeded to leak all over it and crap all over it and begin plotting his own campaign for
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:44.600]  president delusions the american people will elect a guy who wears three buttoned out shirts on top
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:49.240]  of each other it was only two roger come on all right i've seen him wear three
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:55.320]  you know what's going to be incredible in the oval office where ronald reagan would not even
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:04:00.280]  take off his jacket well now cnn puts different now cnn puts different pictures of steve bannon
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:03.560]  up when they talk about him because he's the good guy now so they have like a photoshop picture of
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:08.840]  steve bannon they use but i tell you what's going to be shocking about this is this is the tripling
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:15.160]  quadrupling down of the trump russia collusion delusion and the brainwashed minions out there
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:19.640]  are only getting more crazier i mean this is they're going to buy this that's going to be the craziest
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:22.360]  thing they're going to buy this they're going to celebrate this and they're going to act like this
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:27.400]  is a big victory for them meanwhile the president's on his way to the hospital in braward county which
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:31.480]  they're also mocking him for they're literally mocking him for that on twitter anna navarro
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:35.560]  and them are mocking the president for going to twitter it for to florida or they'll just do like
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:40.920]  uh some of the cnn reporters they'll just say he never really went to the hospital no he didn't
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:45.400]  he didn't do anything it was a costa he was never there he didn't go see scolese no he never he was
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:51.080]  never in florida and they took the bust out of marlither king and yeah hey thanks roger he colluded
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:54.280]  with russia too we found him now we'll be back with quentin tarantino's father

[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:23.080]  quite frankly uh i just went off what i saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients but it
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:28.360]  wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred two hundred dollars for the formulae

[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:43.480]  we're gonna be joined till about 45 after by tony tarantino tarantino productions dot com
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:48.360]  he got into acting producing directing i guess before his son was even born and we got this call
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:54.200]  about a week and a half ago i looked into it i vetted it made some calls and he's a really interesting
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:10:01.400]  person the tarantino family has for over 80 years in the film industry tarantino productions
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:07.400]  established in 1958 as a general partnership between dominick tarantino and tony tarantino
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:13.080]  in 2017 for the first time since the founding of tarantino productions llc tony tarantino
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:18.680]  decided to bring his son edward j tarantino his vice president turned into productions participates
[02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:23.640]  in the writing of screenplays and scripts and it just goes on he had a very interesting background
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:28.360]  history he's a patriot he's a conservative i'll let him stay a few months about his background
[02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:35.240]  and patriotism but i got the contact and i and i and i and i was like this is tarantino's dad and
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:40.200]  he says that he really is upset about what quentin's saying and my issue was he's defended
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:45.960]  weinstein harvey weinstein clinton has uh clinton for no reason first time i ever saw him came over
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:49.800]  and told me to get the f out of here and i was at a public movie theater watching the friends
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:53.080]  connection that i know he was going to show up and speak i knew the director was going to be there
[02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:58.760]  and then he was there it was his event and some of the people attached to him uh came over and um
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:04.920]  basically costed us as we left and i was like wow i don't like quentin tarantino what a jerk
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:10.600]  um but he had a few films you could say were pretty good but that's not why i'm attacking him
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:16.680]  i'm attacking him because he went on howard stern and said that maroma kalansky uh drugged and
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:24.840]  raped that little girl that when it was a big national controversy that well it was consenting
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:29.000]  well no you can't pick up my 13 year old daughter if you convince her to have sex with you because
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.800]  you drug her that it's consenting it's but below the age of consent that is a nameless statement
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:38.440]  and i don't want to just i feel bad with his father here i've looked up that's a good record and
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:41.960]  everything but his dad wanted to come on to set the record straight about the family we'll play
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:45.640]  that clip if you missed it from howard stern and even howard stern came in like it goes on for
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:51.880]  like an hour like dude back off you know say you're joking and tarantino quentin would not say that
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:55.800]  and then we learned talking to his father and i don't know how much we want to get into on there
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:01.880]  but it fits the mo of why somebody would think something like that if they themselves
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:11.880]  had been abused uh uh so this this this rabbit hole goes deep but at epstein's plane aliyah express
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:19.240]  and of course uh wine scene on board the clinton's on board i mean this is a big house of cards
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:27.160]  and why would tarantino publicly defend that and why would the media refuse to pick it up i mean if
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:33.400]  a guy slaps his wife he gets in trouble he should or if somebody slaps a girl in the but they get
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:40.680]  fired and they should get in trouble but when it's hey it's okay for men to drugs 13 year olds
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:46.920]  and rape him in the but excuse my french it's okay if quentin tarantino says it so we're gonna go
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:51.640]  to break here in a few months to come back with the with the stern clips but tony tarantino um i
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:55.400]  know it's probably hard for you to come on and talk about this but why did you reach out doesn't say
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:13:00.440]  for the family name that was in your first email you wanted to come on and and and and make a statement
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:09.960]  about this uh that's really important to me alex it's you know my dad was everything to me he was
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:18.600]  my hero my dad was an actor in the early 30s he did zones with tom nicks buck jones kim mcoy that
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:25.000]  picture of him that he just showed his arm tom nicks his horse tony you know he was an actor i had to be
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:32.280]  an actor my dad was a world war two marine he served in water canal and he was jima i had to be a marine
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:39.960]  the tarantino name has integrity it has respect and what quentin has been doing with it just sickens
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:47.160]  me and i first spoke out against him and i think it was what 2015 when in new york he stood up and
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:54.120]  called all cops murderers you know i've got two cops in my family one killed on duty the other one
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:14:05.160]  died 50 years later after having his back broken three places the calibri uh obstructions that
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:11.960]  happened in calibri university in new york he just recently passed away from bone cancer due to
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:18.600]  those in your 50 years so your your your marines your police your your patriots and and your your
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:25.800]  piss that your son is pissing all over it yeah exactly exactly and then here's another point
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:35.000]  that i make to me that's important he really has no technical or legal right to the tarantino
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:42.200]  when he was between two and a half and three years old his mother remarried and her new husband
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:50.600]  zastapil adopted quinton so his legal name is quinton juron zastapil he went all through school
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:57.240]  and everything he did as zastapil then when he decided he wanted to get into the film industry
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:03.240]  he decided to jump on the tarantino name that already had some recognition in the industry

[02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:46.600]  it's a kello mcgreen article we're going to be covering it coming up now tony tarantino the
[02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:50.440]  confirmed admitted father of quentin tarantino one of the biggest directors in hollywood
[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:55.320]  is our guest he has tarantino productions his dad was a world war two vet veteran
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:21:02.680]  uh v would seem a marine he himself's a patriot uh and he's on record hundreds of films directing
[02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:09.160]  in tv shows movies you name it and so he's quentin tarantino's dad and i just got up there and
[02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:17.400]  pointed out i guess early last week if you just tuned in that um the media ignores reports of
[02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:22.600]  pedophilia men and women being raped uh i'm not against gay people in general but there is a quote
[02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:29.160]  gay mafia gay hollywood folks have said where men get abused and then no one speaks up for them uh and
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:35.160]  there's been a lot of reports about you tarantino another spitting on women making them wreck cars
[02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:40.040]  do dangerous stunts all sorts of sexual assault by winestein being covered up rape you name it
[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:46.520]  and the media leaves tarantino alone for some reason and so that's a big question for his
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:52.040]  father why do they leave alone and why would quentin go on howard stern and say in the middle
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:22:00.440]  of a firestorm about roman polanski that you know had a girl he grabbed drug raped why would he say
[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:06.200]  it's consensual that's nambla type talk it wasn't consensual plus it can't be legally because he's
[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:12.280]  not the age of consent so it's why you know a 12 year old can't get breast implants or have a sex
[02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:16.600]  change i mean it's the same thing but the left wants to lower the age of consent so they can come in
[02:22:16.600 --> 02:22:21.320]  tell parents not to be parents they come in take control of your children that's the program
[02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:27.560]  so uh he joins us now i want to play a clip of this uh so he can respond to it uh of quentin
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:33.160]  tarantino his son on howard stern when you gary garver our reporter out in hollywood interviewed
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:40.120]  here's what you said i gotta ask you about this this this i don't understand your movie i understand
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:44.760]  this i don't you ready yeah okay here we go hey quentin how you doing man hey i'm pretty good
[02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:50.360]  that's me uh have you done to make the world a better place i don't know uh what do you think i've
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:57.160]  done cool movies oh well there i'll stand with that takes us off yeah yeah we happy when roland
[02:22:57.160 --> 02:23:03.000]  polanski won the oscar yeah that was pretty cool actually yeah uh what's so great about rapist being
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:09.480]  the recipient of hollywood's highest honor i am i don't consider him a rapist that's the one that
[02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:15.960]  how could you defend so i don't understand this how come hollywood embraces this madman
[02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:21.800]  as director who raped a 13 year old he didn't rape the 13 years it was statutory rape yeah all right
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:29.080]  well that's not quite the same thing all right it's it's not statutory rape you know he had sex
[02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:33.880]  with a with a minor all right that's not rape to me when you use the word rape all right you're
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:37.640]  talking about violent throwing them down it's like one of the most violent crimes in the world you
[02:23:37.640 --> 02:23:41.640]  can't throw you know throwing the word rape around is like throwing the word racist around
[02:23:41.640 --> 02:23:45.880]  all right you know it just doesn't apply to everything that people use it for all right you know he
[02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:50.360]  was he was guilty of having sex with a minor all right she didn't want to have no that was not
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:57.240]  the case at all she wanted to have it well and dated trance riffs dated the guy dated the guy and
[02:23:57.240 --> 02:24:02.360]  and she was 13 and found out well you by the way we're talking about america's morals we're not
[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:07.880]  talking about the morals in europe and everything all right let's stop right there more so the argument
[02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:13.720]  is it's consensual but she was drugged and taken there by a woman and none of this is even true
[02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:19.400]  and it's in the police report but he's going with the hollywood story though he's dating yeah a 40
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:24.840]  something year old man a 13 year old girl and and then you know she's bleeding all over the place
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:30.680]  and and and then they sell this while they're saying men and women together is bad and and
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:36.840]  me tube movement trying to break up families then but pedophilia is okay so uh i know you talk to
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:41.480]  producer quite a bit sir and we'll come back in a long segment coming up but hearing that
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:47.640]  what uh generally either people are predators or they've been preyed on when they think like that
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:52.200]  nambla's argument is they should be able to come to your door my door and go you got a five-year-old
[02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:56.440]  daughter 10-year-old daughter son whatever if they want to go on a date with me the un is even
[02:24:56.440 --> 02:25:01.480]  looking at trying to make this world law that if the child wants to go they're emancipated they go
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:06.760]  they want to go on a sailing ship with you know 100 Somalis and you know it's up to them i mean
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:11.080]  no more parental rights your kid wants a vaccine they get it your kid wants to watch take drugs
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:16.440]  they they do it this is an attack on parenthood parental rights obviously uh but i mean what
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:20.760]  it's quick turn to your father and i'm hanging out with wine tea and all this and all the new
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:28.680]  controversies what do you make of this sir what you know for one it totally infuriates me if me
[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:37.080]  me or you as an adult male take an adult female out and get her stoned out of her head on alcohol
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:44.520]  then take her to a room and have sex with her that's rape you get charged with it that's illegal
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:51.560]  look look at all the cases that have come out uh with things like that about men just getting a
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:58.600]  woman intoxicated then taking advantage over that's rape now you take a 13 year old i mean
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:04.520]  god i wouldn't care if this 13 year old was the most beautiful female on the face of the earth
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:11.640]  and she comes up and says i want you you've got to be out of your ever-loving mind to even think
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:18.680]  about taking advantage of something like that uh you know i got three books right here behind me
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:24.440]  written on quentin tarantino and i'm quoting you some of the things he said in there in these books
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:31.880]  one thing that he said is that when he was a kid 11 12 years old his mother used to take him to the
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:38.040]  pushy cat theaters and sit there and watch porn films with him wow now that's a statement he made
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:47.800]  and it's in one of these books uh yeah you know it's it's it's sick it really is there's no excuse
[02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:56.280]  for it quentin i gotta say is a filmmaking genius he's done some phenomenal work but on the other
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:04.440]  hand he's such an egotistical maniac that thinks he's above everything else he sits on 150 million
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:11.000]  dollars of his own capital he could afford to do anything you like right now sony is threatening
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:21.080]  to drop his new film on the manson family that's that's uh been all over the social media i've seen
[02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:27.560]  it um well that's my next question he's into he introduced everybody pulp fiction men raping men
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:34.920]  torture now the manson family satanism helter skelter he's being used as a conduit by some very
[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:40.360]  bad people and usually people that say pedophilia is okay whether abuse themselves or been involved
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:45.080]  and then we he writes as you said he was going to porn theaters with his mother i can't believe
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:52.600]  they let him in to triple x porn theaters at 11 or 12 years old this sounds to me like like quentin
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:59.160]  himself may have been abused it sounds to me too but i couldn't verify that because i don't know
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:04.840]  you know i did well is it not abuse to take an 11 year old or 12 year old boy to a porno theater
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:08.920]  i mean i wouldn't go to one of those myself i'm right well crazy girlfriend in college wants
[02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:13.640]  want to go to one and i say you think i'm like hell no lady so i mean i mean as an adult i wouldn't
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:21.480]  go on one of those filthy things so that's what i'm saying is we're wow you know and then too
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:28.360]  because of all of this and what he's done i've got a film going now that i've written three years ago
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:35.400]  before i met donald trump before donald trump was running for president and this film happens to go
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:40.920]  along with everything he's promoting in his administration let's talk about that when we

[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:51.400]  this is amazingly good news it shows miller has nothing it is low level pr companies that
[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:56.280]  we're trying to get advertising for their products they were attacking hillary supporting hillary
[02:33:56.280 --> 02:34:02.760]  they were hijacking every meme out there which thousands of companies we know of to say thousands
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:07.160]  that's conservative they just take whatever the trend is and they just write stuff about it they
[02:34:07.160 --> 02:34:12.760]  link to it and you jump on it that that's how a lot of people run the internet we try to lead the
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:21.320]  internet we try to actually create you know the new research the new trends to wake people up but
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:27.480]  let's put drudge report dot com back up let's let's see the headline dc rock miller indice 13 russians
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:33.480]  trolls of 2016 and drudges got the right term i was going to think during the last hour who are
[02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:38.440]  these people they're attacking trump during the campaign they're supporting him they're they're
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:43.480]  attacking him after and they're and i went wait a minute why are so many of those things they jumped
[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:53.640]  on things i said things we created like hillary for prison 2016 and it's because they were viral
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:35:00.760]  i mean we sold by then like 80 000 t-shirts trump was like my god alex everywhere i go your t-shirts
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:05.880]  are there you'd go to the r and c it was just every other shirt people saw that they jumped on it
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:11.880]  and and then they go oh jones hillary for prisons the russians no it's me it's you the listeners you
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:19.160]  decided to buy the shirt it got huge some russian marketing companies i'm political jumped on and
[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:26.120]  that's all miller's got this is incredible tony tarantino father quentin tarantino i'm not on
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:31.320]  some mission against quentin and and and you're his dad you've been in a lot of films a lot of
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:35.560]  films a lot of movies before him and you know it's strange you were already in film and your dad was in
[02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:39.720]  film and then he got into it maybe i guess because he was looking back on what you'd done but you've
[02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:43.800]  got to film out or film you're producing tell us about that you are you want to produce but just
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:48.520]  getting into his psychology he mentioned when he wrote the book you're being careful here about
[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:54.120]  being taken to porno theaters by his mother back when i guess it wasn't on wasn't internet or wasn't
[02:35:54.120 --> 02:36:01.800]  you know cinemax or whatever on cable i have seen that when i was a teenager um why would he
[02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:07.640]  defend roman polanski and pedophilia and then why i mean why is he so arrogant and why is he being
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:14.440]  protected by hollywood you know that's a damn good question the only thing i can come up with it
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:23.320]  is because of power you know money and power within the industry it's just the same thing
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:30.120]  that weinstein was accused of uh telling women they'd be blackball they'd never work again if they
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:37.560]  didn't submit to his commands uh and basically in my opinion that's the same strength of the same
[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:46.280]  position uh that quinton issues and when you look at roman polanski what he's been able to get away
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:55.640]  with because again of his recognition of his position you know i met harvey uh at i think we
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:01.720]  sent you a picture at the yeah let's put that up tony tarantino with the harvey weinstein when we
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:09.080]  have that photo let's put that up go ahead uh now that was an award ceremony for quinton at the
[02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:16.200]  february center i saw harvey walking up and i was excited i wanted to go over and meet him he was
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:21.320]  walking up and he had this gorgeous young thing on his arm and i walked up to him and i said hey
[02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:27.960]  harvey let me introduce myself i'm tony tarantino and he looked at me really out like and he said
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:34.760]  don't bother me i'm busy right now and i looked at him and i like you i say what comes to my head
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:40.520]  and a lot of times it gets me in trouble but uh and i just looked at him and i said yeah harvey
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:47.160]  that's obvious you're too busy being an asshole and that was my introduction to harvey why you think
[02:37:49.240 --> 02:37:55.880]  these people all of them regardless of who they they become so full of themselves and self
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:38:03.000]  importance and power within the industry that they basically feel they're above the law they're
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:08.920]  above reproach and they get away with any damn thing they feel like and when you listen to some
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:17.400]  of the idiotic things that he has said not just now but all through his career ever since he became
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:25.720]  well known and to me that's really too bad hey i'm an actor but i'm no different than anybody
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:32.520]  else that's what i do for a living that doesn't make me uh you know above anybody else in any other
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:41.080]  way uh it's just what you do for a living you you have a job you know what you do for a living
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:47.640]  and you're good at it but that doesn't send you set you up against the rest of the world and make
[02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:54.680]  you any better of a person than anybody else and people that take that attitude and think they are
[02:38:54.680 --> 02:39:00.600]  they're sick they have a real problem they need to come back down there or somebody needs to put
[02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:07.320]  them there and honestly that's not my intent i don't let me ask you this question it was 16 years
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:14.040]  ago because my son's almost 16 my ex-wife was about six months pregnant and uh there was one
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:18.120]  alamo draft house then it was called the ritz downtown it's a new location now but it was a
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:24.760]  big theater they built out of an old warehouse and i want to see the french connection i knew the
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:27.720]  director was going to be there but i didn't care about that it was back when there weren't a lot
[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:31.320]  of movie theaters you know they're going to show the actresses next that he didn't care about that
[02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:37.080]  only about the ticket for the first movie so go with my pregnant life we sit down i watched a movie
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:42.840]  eat pizza but of course quentin got up at the first and then the director came on so i'm leaving
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:47.080]  and then one of the guys associated with local paper comes and gets to my face is what are you
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:52.440]  doing here and then quentin walks over out in the big hall open area and goes what what the
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:56.920]  effort you doing here baubla i guess you knew who i was i kind of ignored it and my ex-wife comes out
[02:39:56.920 --> 02:40:01.880]  of the bathroom and and i say let's get out of here and then i'm going down the stairs and the
[02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:06.520]  guy affiliate with an uncle newspaper affiliated with it nobody's going down the big red stairs
[02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:11.160]  at that point everybody's upstairs he jumps down his feet tries to like knock her down the stairs
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:14.840]  and then laughs and goes oh i'm sorry it's an accident it's an accident and they had the local
[02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:19.640]  paper person up there with a pad in their hand it was a lady and then no one's up there i'm looking
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:25.880]  up it's just big area open area outside the there's only one theater there and there's quentin tarantino
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:31.640]  kind of pops out like a like a barracuda or something it just goes right back and so i don't
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:37.080]  think he was behind that but he told me get the f out of here just the arrogance of somebody like that
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:44.440]  to to to act like that that's why when i saw him do the howard stern stuff and say a big deal about
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:48.600]  sexual little you know little girls or whatever he's made me ask this guy really thinks he's got
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:56.840]  yeah yeah and he's proven that i don't know why but he's really come after me big time
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:04.360]  i had prism funded through well spargel bank and then i got a call and i have it on voicemail
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:09.720]  because i couldn't take the call at the time the vice president of financial well spargel bank
[02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:16.920]  called me and on a voicemail he said hey well we got a visit from lansing and quentin and after
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:23.160]  discussion with them we decided not to go with you and then not long after that i got another
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:29.160]  deal that was a 55 million dollar deal then after that i got another deal with the company called
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:41.560]  or the cedar fair they owned all these amusement parks like not very far and they were going with
[02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:48.280]  me and then because i was all over the internet and everywhere else supporting donald trump i got
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:54.600]  an email from them saying hey we decided not to go with you you're too politically sensitive
[02:41:55.480 --> 02:41:59.560]  so that's how it works so so they have that they claim there's a red list and they've been

[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:30.360]  the big breaking news that's unfolding in the war room with elin shroyer and of course roger stone
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:39.640]  is here in studio here in the atx before i hit the final news that i'm going to hit in this hour
[02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:47.320]  i just want to make a point i can't open a newspaper or turn on a television channel
[02:47:47.320 --> 02:47:58.040]  or go see a movie or turn on netflix or hbo or amazon and there not be just anti trump stuff
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:07.960]  everywhere and then below that there's anti alex jones stuff everywhere and it's not like oh look
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:20.600]  they're attacking me it's not like that and so i'm sitting there last night with my son and he's
[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:24.280]  looking at documentaries he's and it's like all this anti-trump stuff and there was like some show
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:29.000]  i called scams or something on netflix i forget and one of them is donald trump and i already knew
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:35.240]  all about it so let's watch this the thing was like almost two hours long we sit there we started
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:39.400]  the thing like nine o'clock at nine i never stay up till 11 anymore am i go man so i gotta be like
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:46.280]  five a.m i watch this whole thing and it was all lies and distortion and it isn't like i'm just
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:55.320]  defending trump i know all about that stuff and i've experienced the lies and then i just say to
[02:48:55.320 --> 02:49:04.440]  myself what is it about this guy that's got them so scared and then i look into my gut and my gut
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:09.960]  goes back trump back trump back trump he's real he's real from way before ever came on the show
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:14.600]  i ever talked to him on the phone i'm not into politicians i'm not into celebrities i don't
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:18.200]  trump's kind of goofy with the stupid hair and all of it he's not about that
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:23.400]  but i'm totally liberated not caring about celebrity
[02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:33.720]  but with trump there was something different and you know somebody by their enemies and the
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:38.120]  way they hate him and the way when i watch that show like all the other ones i've seen was the
[02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:45.000]  exact same thing oh he's fake oh he's a loser oh maybe he only has 10 billion he claims he's so rich
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:53.080]  but you know the big secret almost no one in the last 50 years almost all our forces were made
[02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:58.440]  by mavericks like trump before but the last 50 years they were all made by combines and centralized
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:08.840]  corruption these societies trump did do hundreds of things did fail at dozens of things he's total
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:19.480]  americana and that's why they're so scared he does go with his gut he is impetuous he he does do
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:23.640]  these things and that's what i'm like and that's what you're like and that's why they hate us
[02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:33.640]  and you watch these documentaries and all the rest of it and you really realize what these people
[02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:43.160]  are like and it would show these people that were given access to trump that would stab in the back
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:51.160]  and say crappy things about him like oh in between divorces he really love hot women oh my god what
[02:50:51.160 --> 02:50:56.120]  a demon but if you're trying to screw little kids that you kid dad that's fine you know when all you
[02:50:56.120 --> 02:51:00.200]  goody two shoes are mad about pedophilia i'll start worrying about grown men you know in between
[02:51:00.200 --> 02:51:04.760]  divorces like in hot women that's how god built us and i'm not saying all of it's good or perfect
[02:51:04.760 --> 02:51:09.880]  i get it the point is get this beam out of your own eye before you tell me to get a speck out of
[02:51:09.880 --> 02:51:20.760]  mine it's just my gut tells me trumps good and then it's delivering my guts never wrong i didn't like
[02:51:20.760 --> 02:51:26.360]  the hollywood trump i didn't like the apprentice trump i i don't but then once i got the political
[02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:32.360]  trump i was like and that's the real trump that's what they're scared of the evil spirit that is
[02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:40.680]  globalism hate trump because he simply wants prosperity and he's confident
[02:51:42.760 --> 02:51:51.080]  see a satanist is really immature and they're very very insecure they are really scared by trump
[02:51:51.080 --> 02:51:56.200]  because they act all secure and they act all invincible and they act like they're fake until
[02:51:56.200 --> 02:52:06.520]  they make it trumps already made it and you've already made it because you don't want to screw
[02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:12.680]  people over you're already confident you're not looking for power that's why they hate you
[02:52:14.760 --> 02:52:20.360]  and so that's why i back trump is he perfect absolutely not he made a lot of mistakes yeah
[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:25.400]  if i was in this position i'd have done a worse job i can tell you right now we're not gods we're
[02:52:25.400 --> 02:52:35.640]  men and i look at the stormy daniels thing right before he got remarried or whatever and now you
[02:52:35.640 --> 02:52:42.840]  know she got paid off or whatever and and she admit was all consensual whatever and oh she saved
[02:52:42.840 --> 02:52:49.880]  the dresses and now they're gonna see if any of his dna's on it like he did something wrong like a
[02:52:49.880 --> 02:52:55.880]  woman wants to be with him and he's with her and then now with the treachery of this
[02:52:59.480 --> 02:53:04.040]  i'm not saying stormy daniels has even done all that the point is is that's how the media
[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:10.120]  pushes all this like oh i just can murder and sell little girls into sex slavery that's okay but
[02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:15.160]  if donald trump has consensual sex with a woman 14 years ago it's the end of the world
[02:53:15.160 --> 02:53:22.680]  and that's what i mean and then quentin tarantino says you can rape a 13 year old it's consensual
[02:53:23.640 --> 02:53:28.520]  it's what i mean it's like they're the group that has no morals that knows we have morals
[02:53:29.160 --> 02:53:35.000]  and so it messes with us all day about how we're not perfect when it's completely evil
[02:53:36.840 --> 02:53:38.120]  and that's what i'm getting at here
[02:53:38.120 --> 02:53:49.080]  yeah stormy daniels has a monica lawinsky dress to test for trump's dna reports us god almighty
[02:53:49.960 --> 02:53:56.840]  it never ends so that's where i stand meanwhile north korea has told us military they're gonna
[02:53:56.840 --> 02:54:01.000]  strike tokyo japan between the 28th of march
[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:09.880]  and april second and you know matri media puts out fake leaks and fake reports and fake sources
[02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:13.400]  let me tell you something those aren't fake sources with me
[02:54:15.720 --> 02:54:21.480]  i'd rather blow my head off which i don't want to do by the way never commit suicide
[02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:30.600]  then lie to you my only value is that i tell the truth the globalists call that a weakness
[02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:39.000]  i call it a strength but are the people telling me that trying to manipulate me maybe so
[02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:47.880]  you should i mean i said so does the deputy director want me to say this well you're authorized
[02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:56.280]  to say it no i want to know do they want this said and why we're not going to tell you but
[02:54:56.280 --> 02:55:02.440]  obviously we're authorized to tell you this i ignore it for a few weeks then more contacts more
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:08.920]  more more more we we want you to warn people because we don't want to cause a panic but we want
[02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:14.360]  the arm service network that listens to you everybody to know this and i'm like about
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:19.000]  being used in some larger thing to hive war i don't think that's what trumps wants to do
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:27.640]  i don't know and then after weeks of this i decided to tell you just know i'm at the limits of my
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:33.080]  capacity i i don't like these con men that say they know everything and they've got every answer
[02:55:33.080 --> 02:55:38.760]  and they have no answers i'm telling you i'm maxed out and i'm just telling you this stuff's real
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:45.800]  and that's all i got at this point is the fact that i'm real i can hold on to that point that i'm
[02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:50.760]  not trying to hurt people that i'm real that i love god that i love my family that i love children
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:55.800]  that i want to be a good person and i'm only do whatever it takes to make sure that we continue
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:00.760]  on and i'm i want to be strong because i believe you're strong globalists always say oh alice you're
[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:06.040]  just scaring them for us they're a bunch of cowards but they've been proven wrong haven't they it's
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:11.480]  you're not a bunch of cowards you heard the truth about the globalist and you took action you heard
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:17.400]  the truth about their evil and you took action and that's what i know i don't sit there in some
[02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:23.160]  intellectual calculation like all these other inbred three-barreled names scumbags do you
[02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:26.840]  want to talk about cracker-ass white people let me tell you they are the problem they're one
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:30.760]  tenth of one percent they're a bunch of inbred mental patients they can all go right to hell
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:37.320]  they there's no big fancy calculation with me i go with what the truth is though the heavens
[02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:43.880]  fall and in one minute at the end of the hour if you want to see this type of information continue

[02:58:28.520 --> 02:58:33.960]  you mention the uh the silver bullet colloidal silver it's got thousands of reviews a 98 percent
[02:58:33.960 --> 02:58:38.760]  review it is our highest reviewed product because it is from the top lab in the country discounted
[02:58:38.760 --> 02:58:42.280]  high quality colloidal silver and it's not a silver bullet but the closest thing you're going to find
[02:58:42.280 --> 02:58:51.560]  to a silver bullet over a year in the making produced by one of the top organic firms in the

[02:59:43.160 --> 02:59:59.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:59.080 --> 03:00:26.200]  i want to be very very clear and it's not because i'm in some fbi butt kissing operation but because
[03:00:26.200 --> 03:00:31.800]  i've learned how this stuff works the democrats would stage riots came out in the wiki leagues
[03:00:31.800 --> 03:00:37.640]  came out in other documents soros documents in court we covered just last month would exacerbate
[03:00:37.640 --> 03:00:44.120]  every questionable police shooting would cause race riots would would would try to discredit
[03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:51.720]  local governments to then bring in federal control under unedict under the strong city's initiative
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:56.680]  and believe me i couldn't believe two years ago when they were openly saying the justice
[03:00:56.680 --> 03:01:01.080]  department will read a lynch one of the un to take over local police departments i mean you
[03:01:01.080 --> 03:01:06.520]  can't make that up but that was the announcements even crazier and i can think of i mean it's just
[03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:11.400]  they're getting bold as they lose they're like overshooting they used to like deny world government
[03:01:11.400 --> 03:01:14.680]  now it's like world government summit says get rid of the family you know this week
[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:24.040]  so when you just sit there and like attack a group and say every fbi agent's a horrible person and
[03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:28.840]  they're all bad and blah blah blah you know there's a political aim behind that because it's an
[03:01:28.840 --> 03:01:34.920]  institution somebody wants to hijack that institution and if trump was trying to clearly
[03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:41.160]  block the fbi and do bad things i'd be against him but there are criminal elements of the fbi
[03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:47.000]  so they make it about an attack on the fbi instead of about ferreting out criminal elements within it
[03:01:50.040 --> 03:01:53.480]  but at the left of the globalists are going to call for gun control they're going to blame
[03:01:53.480 --> 03:01:58.360]  gun owners and say we're all guilty and then you've got the holdovers of the whole obama
[03:01:58.360 --> 03:02:03.080]  fbi not doing anything about people that keep one of the mass shootings islamic attack san
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:09.000]  meridino fbi agents were threatened with arrest uh civil rights criminal investigations
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:13.320]  those because they were trying to stop people that went to pakistan and went to saudi arabia
[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:19.960]  those were fbi agents and federal marshals that tried to do their jobs they were threatened with
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:25.320]  criminal charges for civil rights violations like they were kkk members about the blow up of
[03:02:25.320 --> 03:02:31.880]  black church for trying to stop muslim immigrants that were terrorists and later did attack a christmas
[03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:40.920]  party so am i saying the fbi's the enemy no it was the fbi low level trying to stop it it was just
[03:02:40.920 --> 03:02:48.360]  department above it making it a political operation completely that said here's the breaking news
[03:02:48.360 --> 03:02:54.920]  inside of london independent inside of sputnik news inside of ap florida governor calls for fbi

[03:07:53.560 --> 03:07:59.000]  left coast you know me as a frequent guest a filmmaker dreams from my real father there's

[03:08:04.200 --> 03:08:10.280]  trump the art of the insult you won't be able to stop laughing you got to go to the info wars
[03:08:10.280 --> 03:08:17.320]  store and get the art of the insult now coming up at the bottom of the hour clinton basher attorney
[03:08:17.320 --> 03:08:22.760]  larry claimant of freedom watch usa he's going to be giving us a lot of insight on what's going
[03:08:22.760 --> 03:08:28.520]  to happen next in washington with the uh so-called indictments or non indictments if anything's
[03:08:28.520 --> 03:08:33.480]  going to happen and how it can happen to take care of these conspirators against the united states
[03:08:34.440 --> 03:08:39.160]  first i'm going to give you some uh some of my insights some of my takes on what's going on in the
[03:08:39.160 --> 03:08:43.720]  news briefly because we're going to talk to larry claimant later i want to talk about
[03:08:44.760 --> 03:08:51.160]  something personal about the steel dossier of course we all read about bruce or people have
[03:08:51.160 --> 03:08:58.040]  seen bruce or in the news quite a bit his wife worked for fusion gps she was a russia expert
[03:08:58.040 --> 03:09:03.160]  and he's made deep in it well i actually went to high school with bruce or there's that high school
[03:09:03.160 --> 03:09:09.640]  photo and i knew bruce or growing up he's in came from my small town in oakridge tennessee uh bruce
[03:09:09.640 --> 03:09:15.240]  was a nice enough guy and the reason i'm telling you this is because he was a brainiac he was an
[03:09:15.240 --> 03:09:24.280]  a plus student physics major in college uh he was not an ideologue he was not a political person if
[03:09:24.280 --> 03:09:29.800]  i'm being honest he was a little bit of a wimp so i'm going to predict based on my knowledge
[03:09:29.800 --> 03:09:36.520]  and experience with bruce or growing up that he's probably cooperating with the uh
[03:09:37.640 --> 03:09:43.480]  with the investigators because he was actually scheduled to be interviewed by the house committee
[03:09:43.480 --> 03:09:49.400]  over a month ago no interview and i think that's very interesting i think his personality is
[03:09:49.400 --> 03:09:55.240]  someone who's going to cooperate if anything it was his wife nally i think that uh got him into
[03:09:55.240 --> 03:10:00.840]  this uh nonsense because we saw how much he's involved with russia she spent time in russia
[03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:06.440]  she learned russian and in my experience people that become so obsessed with russia is very strange
[03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:11.320]  and very rare group of people that do that and the only people that do that are essentially what we
[03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:17.880]  call red diaper babies red diaper babies are children of communists children of communist
[03:10:17.880 --> 03:10:24.840]  party usa members uh it's a phenomenon that goes way back in the 1960s all the leaders of the weather
[03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:31.640]  underground sds students for democratic society marxist terrorist groups all of them came from
[03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:39.160]  families where their parents taught them growing up we're pro-stalin we're pro-communist we love russia
[03:10:39.160 --> 03:10:44.680]  america is evil this is the nonsense these people were fed and then they grow up having an obsession
[03:10:44.680 --> 03:10:50.200]  with russia uh as you know from my film dreams from my real father i presented a mountain of
[03:10:50.200 --> 03:10:55.800]  evidence that obama's real father was a soviet agent frank marshall davis the man who raised him
[03:10:55.800 --> 03:11:04.040]  in hawaii and he was radicalized now bruce or i believe is going to sing to the feds because
[03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:10.600]  he's no radical he's a very nice kid and he probably got involved in some things that he
[03:11:10.600 --> 03:11:14.520]  realizes you know a way over his head so we're going to talk to larry claiming about that
[03:11:14.520 --> 03:11:21.720]  uh later at the bottom of the hour i want to give you some insights into this horrific shooting by
[03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:28.120]  this nut job in florida this week as usual we hear that the fbi was warned about this guy
[03:11:28.120 --> 03:11:34.360]  and did nothing and of course the left calls for gun restrictions they call this uh common sense
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:40.120]  it's always common sense with the left they use these word games uh they want common sense
[03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:45.640]  gun laws of course there were no common sense truck laws when the terrorists ran over people
[03:11:45.640 --> 03:11:51.320]  in new york or or anywhere else uh when these people are on a bike path uh they didn't talk
[03:11:51.320 --> 03:11:57.640]  about common sense pressure cooker laws after the sarnai brothers uh made bombs out of pressure
[03:11:57.640 --> 03:12:06.120]  cookers every time a islamic terrorist shoots stabs bombs or runs over americans of course the
[03:12:06.120 --> 03:12:12.280]  response of the left is let's not jump to conclusions there's no common sense call for
[03:12:12.280 --> 03:12:17.480]  common sense immigration reform where's the common sense so you got to be careful about
[03:12:17.480 --> 03:12:23.640]  leftist word games they've been playing word games forever because on the face of it their
[03:12:23.640 --> 03:12:29.320]  policies don't make any sense uh of course back in the sixties they used to say don't kill your
[03:12:29.320 --> 03:12:37.000]  children and uh then it became choice abortion was a matter of choice of course only eight nine
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:41.800]  years ago barack obama was saying marriage is between a man and a woman and god god's in the mix
[03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:47.320]  and then later he said well no now the word is equality it's marriage equality so we've got
[03:12:48.200 --> 03:12:55.320]  common sense choice and equality uh the next one is government controlled health care government
[03:12:55.320 --> 03:12:59.800]  controlled doctors doctors work for the government we see how that works in the v a hospitals
[03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:05.240]  but the new word is access you have to have access to health care everyone has to have
[03:13:05.240 --> 03:13:11.960]  access now access simply means uh free government health care and now of course we hear uh because
[03:13:11.960 --> 03:13:18.200]  this nut job shot people that we need common sense uh gun reform which simply means eliminate
[03:13:18.200 --> 03:13:23.960]  of course the second amendment so the media simply in turn replays and repeats these these
[03:13:23.960 --> 03:13:29.480]  word games and often republicans accidentally get caught up in it too they repeat these word games
[03:13:29.480 --> 03:13:34.360]  so you have to be very vigilant uh not to accidentally accept the language of the left
[03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:40.520]  all these things the immigration system is broken i've heard republicans say that in fact the
[03:13:40.520 --> 03:13:46.280]  immigration system was fine it was the enforcement that was broken so it's all about word games when
[03:13:46.280 --> 03:13:53.800]  it comes to the left but let's talk about the fbi and their incompetence uh with this mass shooter uh
[03:13:54.440 --> 03:13:57.720]  they've been missing a lot of mass shooters lately want to go through some of them
[03:13:58.600 --> 03:14:04.120]  and give you some insights especially into las vegas of course dylan roof bought weapons because
[03:14:04.120 --> 03:14:11.160]  of errors of the fbi and their background checks board hood shooter major need al hasan was in
[03:14:11.160 --> 03:14:18.520]  contact with uh al qaeda terrorist anwa al alaki fbi declined to investigate him nothing could go
[03:14:18.520 --> 03:14:24.840]  wrong there of course the sarnai brothers in boston uh one of them was investigated by the fbi
[03:14:25.560 --> 03:14:32.600]  they said no links to terrorism see you later pulse nightclub shooter omar matine was turned
[03:14:32.600 --> 03:14:37.560]  into the fbi remember if you see something say something they had like a two-year investigation
[03:14:37.560 --> 03:14:43.880]  of this guy they interviewed him they eventually said well no problem never mind and then after he
[03:14:43.880 --> 03:14:48.680]  shoots up the nightclub they lecture us again if you see something say something well that entire
[03:14:48.680 --> 03:14:54.040]  idea is completely irrelevant it's been proven over and over uh it's not going to help a better
[03:14:54.040 --> 03:15:01.400]  slogan would be be prepared to protect yourself because the fbi ain't going to do it fbi ain't
[03:15:01.400 --> 03:15:07.960]  going to do it uh what has the fbi been doing lately uh they we know they spend their time
[03:15:07.960 --> 03:15:13.880]  carrying bags of money to russian hoaxers who are offering up short stories about donald trump
[03:15:14.920 --> 03:15:20.200]  biggest uh racket in the world they're paying about 85 000 per page that's what they paid for
[03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:26.520]  this the steel dossier fbi is also leaking about donald trump even the director of the fbi
[03:15:26.520 --> 03:15:32.520]  leaking about donald trump not looking into these guys on these watch lists and of course
[03:15:32.520 --> 03:15:37.080]  they're apparently texting each other that's another big deal so i'm going to talk more in
[03:15:37.080 --> 03:15:42.440]  depth about the los vegas shooter and some things that i've learned and how the fbi goes into the

[03:21:13.080 --> 03:21:21.640]  white guy regular old dude decides to give it all up and murder 59 or so country music fans
[03:21:21.640 --> 03:21:27.080]  what are the odds of that and there's no motive lots of strange things no motive there's hundreds
[03:21:27.080 --> 03:21:32.520]  of cameras in the mandalay bay they must have had this guy coming and going with bags of stuff
[03:21:32.520 --> 03:21:39.080]  in suitcases full of guns or something how come we haven't seen a videotape anyone seen a video
[03:21:39.080 --> 03:21:45.800]  of tape of that there was only one witness which was a security guard who goes to mexico the fbi
[03:21:45.800 --> 03:21:50.840]  lets him go to mexico a few days later and then a week later he's on the ellen degenerate show
[03:21:50.840 --> 03:21:57.800]  you know could it be that a different guy came back from mexico and there's something else going
[03:21:57.800 --> 03:22:04.520]  on as long as there's no information you have to wonder what's happening now i called a source a
[03:22:04.520 --> 03:22:10.360]  good friend of mine who was a retired military guy very high up in the us military retired in
[03:22:10.360 --> 03:22:17.160]  vegas for many years and he checked for me with the top security officials police even fbi
[03:22:17.160 --> 03:22:24.200]  in los vegas and he said that these main security people who usually know everything knew nothing
[03:22:24.760 --> 03:22:30.440]  they knew nothing and they usually know everything and they said that it seemed like all the information
[03:22:30.440 --> 03:22:36.680]  was blocked up from the top so you have to ask you know what really happened now remember the fbi
[03:22:36.680 --> 03:22:41.240]  screwed up in orlando florida they had this guy omer matine under surveillance for two years
[03:22:41.240 --> 03:22:48.440]  and dropped the ball 49 people dead that was pretty embarrassing uh there was a similar story
[03:22:48.440 --> 03:22:55.560]  in manchester uh the shooter salman abadi at the ariana grande concert in england she was under
[03:22:55.560 --> 03:23:00.200]  surveillance and they let him go i'm sorry he was under surveillance and the brits let him go that
[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:06.840]  was pretty embarrassing so it's a pattern uh that we see in vegas except they didn't maybe tell us
[03:23:06.840 --> 03:23:12.920]  what really went down now i would bet one day we're going to find out that steven paddock was
[03:23:12.920 --> 03:23:18.840]  under surveillance uh what if all that video in the in the hotel that they're not showing us what
[03:23:18.840 --> 03:23:23.640]  if there were fbi guys helping them carry guns up to the up to the room they certainly wouldn't
[03:23:23.640 --> 03:23:29.000]  want to show you that if they screwed up and let them go uh when they cut off the information
[03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:34.680]  flow it means there's something wrong uh what if paddock was moonlighting what if he was working
[03:23:34.680 --> 03:23:41.800]  with the fbi trying to set up some isis character and the isis guy did all the shooting and killed
[03:23:41.800 --> 03:23:50.520]  paddock and left remember the fbi has cut off all the information uh we know there's corruption in
[03:23:50.520 --> 03:23:57.240]  the fbi these guys get short stories from russians and that are ridiculous and they say oh let's go
[03:23:57.240 --> 03:24:03.960]  open up an investigation on donald trump so the point is the fbi seems hopelessly corrupt and
[03:24:03.960 --> 03:24:13.320]  incapable on all levels of executing protection for americans so this see something say something
[03:24:13.320 --> 03:24:18.360]  is quite irrelevant doesn't matter uh be prepared to protect yourself because the fbi
[03:24:19.320 --> 03:24:23.960]  hasn't proven that they're ever going to do that next thing i want to give my take
[03:24:23.960 --> 03:24:30.440]  is on iran uh we saw in north korea of course was in the news at the olympics because kim jung's
[03:24:30.440 --> 03:24:36.200]  un's little sister really really impressed the media because she showed up said nothing and
[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:41.960]  hardly even smiled and the media thought that i was really cool so i want to give you a unique
[03:24:41.960 --> 03:24:47.640]  take on north korea that you probably haven't heard uh everyone knows about obama's deal with iran
[03:24:48.200 --> 03:24:53.240]  it was a private deal it was not approved by the senate as required and it included the transfer
[03:24:53.240 --> 03:24:59.640]  of 1.7 billion dollars in cash now the media likes to say well some of this might have gone to
[03:24:59.640 --> 03:25:05.320]  terrorism but i would argue much worse did you notice that the korean north korean nuclear
[03:25:05.320 --> 03:25:11.720]  program suddenly took off they're suddenly shooting all these missiles and exploding nuclear
[03:25:11.720 --> 03:25:18.600]  bombs as soon as iran got this cash so unfortunately the real story that was broken by a reporter
[03:25:18.600 --> 03:25:23.640]  claudie rosette who told me about this i met her and she wrote about it in forbes magazine
[03:25:23.640 --> 03:25:31.400]  she said that iran did not need cash that the entire point of the agreement with obama was to
[03:25:31.400 --> 03:25:38.680]  allow iran access to international banking uh she even told me that iran uh didn't even ask for
[03:25:38.680 --> 03:25:44.120]  cash till the very end uh and she told me that there's only one country in the world one country
[03:25:44.120 --> 03:25:51.880]  that must use cash to do transactions and that one country is north korea so again did you notice
[03:25:51.880 --> 03:25:59.000]  that the north korea nuclear program took off once obama paid the iranians the cash so i think
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:06.200]  what's most likely is the iranians simply sent their 1.7 billion in cash to north korea to continue
[03:26:06.200 --> 03:26:10.840]  the iranian nuclear program during the 10 years they're not allowed to produce this means that
[03:26:10.840 --> 03:26:18.040]  obama's nuclear deal actually caused both iran and north korea to develop nuclear weapons
[03:26:18.040 --> 03:26:23.720]  that's probably what happened and don't think for a second that that obama you didn't know this all
[03:26:23.720 --> 03:26:31.080]  along obama's record in office was to diminish the power of united states and empower america's
[03:26:31.080 --> 03:26:37.080]  intractable enemies if you've seen my film dreams to my real father you know that obama was raised
[03:26:37.080 --> 03:26:43.400]  by a russian agent who i say is his real father and frank marshall davis taught obama to hate
[03:26:43.400 --> 03:26:48.680]  taught him to hate america hate white people hate people of different economic classes he taught in
[03:26:48.680 --> 03:26:56.040]  malchamex angela davis uh so much so that you can see that obama is very comfortable with
[03:26:56.040 --> 03:27:03.240]  anti-american extremists and they're very comfortable with him again the iran deal may have
[03:27:03.240 --> 03:27:09.880]  in fact created two nuclear powers north korea and iran it took america over 10 years to recover
[03:27:09.880 --> 03:27:17.320]  from the disastrous jimmy carter presidency it may take 20 or more years to recover from obama's
[03:27:17.320 --> 03:27:25.480]  legacy of anti-americanism uh racial division class division and damage to security uh coming up at

[03:33:59.800 --> 03:34:06.040]  claimant the incredible warrior founder of judicial watch and freedom watch he's known for a strong
[03:34:06.040 --> 03:34:12.440]  public interest advocacy in ethics individual freedoms larry became so famous for fighting
[03:34:12.440 --> 03:34:19.480]  corruption that the nbc hit show west wing named a character after him named harry claypool
[03:34:20.200 --> 03:34:26.520]  played by john deal his latest book is whores why and how i came to fight the establishment
[03:34:27.320 --> 03:34:34.760]  larry claimant welcome to info wars thank you joel thank you for that nice introduction great
[03:34:34.760 --> 03:34:40.440]  to have you all right before we get into some of the fbi corruption let's catch up a little bit
[03:34:40.440 --> 03:34:45.640]  what people want to know is the clinton's have a rap sheet that would make al capone blush
[03:34:46.600 --> 03:34:53.560]  why have they never been put away what have you done to try to do so and what has always stood in
[03:34:53.560 --> 03:35:01.800]  the way joel that's the 64 000 question adjusted for inflation so it's now in the multimillions
[03:35:01.800 --> 03:35:06.760]  but this is the way washington worked it's why i founded judicial watch back in 1994 of course you
[03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:11.480]  know i left and i ran for the u.s senate and i started freedom watch when i came out and that
[03:35:11.480 --> 03:35:18.680]  can be found at freedom watch usa dot org but it's all a giant kabuki dance in washington dc
[03:35:18.680 --> 03:35:23.320]  i did get a finding that bill clinton committed a crime when he released the privacy act protected
[03:35:23.320 --> 03:35:28.600]  files of a woman he sexually assaulted in the oval office cathleen willey but other than that the
[03:35:28.600 --> 03:35:33.320]  government does not take action against its own it's like the national football league you have
[03:35:33.320 --> 03:35:39.000]  the american conference the national conference they both exploit these scandals they go on tv
[03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:43.880]  whether it's fox news or cnn depending on whether you're right or left but nothing ever happens
[03:35:43.880 --> 03:35:49.400]  because there's an unwritten truce between the parties that we're not going to take out any of
[03:35:49.400 --> 03:35:55.560]  our upper level establishment people and that's why you need a larry claimant and a freedom watch
[03:35:55.560 --> 03:35:59.880]  i've now recommended that i'd be pointed special counsel i'll get the job done i'll take care of
[03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:05.720]  the clintons i'll take care of obama i'll take care of the corrupt republicans we're nonpartisan
[03:36:05.720 --> 03:36:11.080]  and they can sign our petition at freedom watch usa dot org it needs to be we have 15 000 names so
[03:36:11.080 --> 03:36:16.840]  far but we need to have many more because uh the president needs to put his foot down and either
[03:36:16.840 --> 03:36:21.160]  nominate me or nominate somebody like me to finally get this job done because they're gonna
[03:36:21.160 --> 03:36:26.520]  destroy him muller will destroy him and so will the obama clinton deep state all right well that's
[03:36:26.520 --> 03:36:32.920]  what i want to look conservatives uh have been very frustrated because of course obama interfered
[03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:37.640]  in the 2012 election he unleashed the irs on conservative groups so they couldn't organize
[03:36:37.640 --> 03:36:44.040]  while the left could organize of course ben gazi uh american ambassador killed all the evidence was
[03:36:44.040 --> 03:36:50.360]  there nothing happened irs nothing happened now we've got the doj and fbi interfering in the 2016
[03:36:50.360 --> 03:36:56.920]  election what can you tell us to give us any encouragement or hope that the law will be applied
[03:36:56.920 --> 03:37:01.800]  against uh obama and the leftist that this will be any different that it won't just be swept
[03:37:01.800 --> 03:37:08.120]  under the rug and let's move on joe won't be any different unless i'm a point of special counsel
[03:37:08.120 --> 03:37:13.880]  there's nobody like me frankly and you can see what's going on right now with traig out he's playing
[03:37:13.880 --> 03:37:18.440]  both sides of the street he's going out in a private practice he's praising muller he started
[03:37:18.440 --> 03:37:24.680]  an investigation over rob porter and the white house the guy who was accused of abusing his ex-wife
[03:37:25.560 --> 03:37:30.680]  these people play both sides of the street so you know it's not just an advertisement i honestly
[03:37:30.680 --> 03:37:36.280]  believe i will risk my life for this country if i have to and i have been threatened in the past
[03:37:36.920 --> 03:37:41.160]  is that you need a larry claiming to be appointed special counsel where it won't happen
[03:37:41.160 --> 03:37:47.480]  my former okay larry go ahead now my former group gets documents that's good but then they
[03:37:47.480 --> 03:37:53.080]  ask the government to do something the government's not going to do anything and if i'm special counsel
[03:37:53.080 --> 03:37:58.520]  i will have the powers of the justice department behind me and i conduct conduct investigations
[03:37:58.520 --> 03:38:04.920]  we've got enough now to indict the clinton's to indict obama to indict muller for leaking
[03:38:04.920 --> 03:38:11.480]  grand jury on trump for a lot of different things and it won't happen unless i'm special counsel
[03:38:11.480 --> 03:38:16.040]  it won't happen there's nobody else out there that'll do it okay let's take for example what's
[03:38:16.040 --> 03:38:21.160]  going on with jeff sessions you think he would have the power to clean house and uh people
[03:38:21.160 --> 03:38:26.600]  to seem very frustrated that he's kind of acting like an employee at the doj instead of the head
[03:38:26.600 --> 03:38:31.960]  of the doj why isn't this guy hardcore southern conservative supported trump from the get go
[03:38:31.960 --> 03:38:38.920]  why isn't he cleaning house so first of all he's a politician okay so by his nature he plays all
[03:38:38.920 --> 03:38:44.520]  sides at the same time but the problem that jeff sessions has is that he himself is under
[03:38:44.520 --> 03:38:50.920]  investigation as either a subject or a target of muller's investigation he's been accused of
[03:38:50.920 --> 03:38:55.560]  perjuring himself in front of congress by burshiv saying he never met with the russian ambassador
[03:38:55.560 --> 03:39:00.440]  was nonsense even if he met with him there was no big deal but he didn't tell the truth number one
[03:39:00.440 --> 03:39:05.480]  he did meet with the russian ambassador number two he's under investigation for alleged collusion
[03:39:05.480 --> 03:39:09.880]  with russia he was on the trump transition team and he was also supporting the president
[03:39:09.880 --> 03:39:15.320]  uh to be elected president and then of course he's been accused of playing a role in the
[03:39:15.320 --> 03:39:20.040]  firing of james comey which is according to muller possible obstruction of justice so
[03:39:20.040 --> 03:39:25.560]  he's put his head in the sand he doesn't want to offend muller or the democrats and he's been
[03:39:25.560 --> 03:39:30.200]  absolutely zero as an attorney general i've said and others have said after i said it
[03:39:30.200 --> 03:39:36.520]  that he should resign uh or do his job but he's been a complete worthless disgrace
[03:39:36.520 --> 03:39:41.480]  as the attorney general well what you're also yeah what you're also saying is that he was
[03:39:41.480 --> 03:39:46.600]  neutralized by these attacks from the left don't forget devon nunez was neutralized by an ethics
[03:39:46.600 --> 03:39:52.520]  complaint for like six months so maybe this is a technique that they'll always find something to
[03:39:52.520 --> 03:39:58.760]  make you afraid to do anything uh what would you do day one larry claiming you're the special
[03:39:58.760 --> 03:40:03.240]  counsel you're in charge of the clinton investigation uh just for me you're going to
[03:40:03.240 --> 03:40:07.400]  investigate obama's background and whose father really is and you're going to find out what the
[03:40:07.400 --> 03:40:11.640]  doj and fbi were up to what do you do day one what's your agenda those first couple days
[03:40:12.920 --> 03:40:17.640]  but what i do is i impanel a grand jury and you start hauling these people in front of a grand jury
[03:40:17.640 --> 03:40:22.840]  now we know that the evidence exists that obama put forward a fraudulent birth certificate
[03:40:22.840 --> 03:40:27.720]  regardless of where he was born and i don't believe he was born in this country uh and i don't
[03:40:27.720 --> 03:40:31.480]  also you know with regard to who his father is that's an open question but it was a fraudulent
[03:40:31.480 --> 03:40:37.080]  birth certificate and that is a crime so he can be convicted for that he can be convicted
[03:40:37.080 --> 03:40:42.120]  for using the intelligence agencies to illegally spy on hundreds of millions of americans not
[03:40:42.120 --> 03:40:46.760] withstanding president trump who we know he was behind that he could be convicted for misuse of
[03:40:46.760 --> 03:40:51.720]  the irs i can go on and on and on joe but there's a lot there and of course the clinton's we know
[03:40:51.720 --> 03:40:57.160]  about them that's a criminal enterprise and they use the clinton foundation as that enterprise
[03:40:57.160 --> 03:41:02.360]  to be able to make millions and millions of dollars at the expense of american national
[03:41:02.360 --> 03:41:06.440]  security so yes i'll bring them in and that's the difference between jeff's sessions and me
[03:41:06.440 --> 03:41:12.520]  and that's why i want people to go to our website at freedomwatchusa.org sign that petition
[03:41:13.080 --> 03:41:17.800]  because you see the establishment doesn't want someone like larry claiming we have to force it
[03:41:17.800 --> 03:41:23.800]  from the masses to say yes we need larry because i will risk everything sessions won't risk anything
[03:41:23.800 --> 03:41:29.880]  he said you'll you'll empower you'll put up a grand jury and you'll start calling people
[03:41:29.880 --> 03:41:35.400]  before the grand grand jury uh you know look i'm hearing janine piero every other saturday she says
[03:41:35.400 --> 03:41:41.240]  indictments are forthcoming and i just don't see it do you think she's credible i like janine piero
[03:41:41.240 --> 03:41:45.880]  and i like what she says but you know what she doesn't understand you know she's been a judge in
[03:41:45.880 --> 03:41:52.360]  in new york state she was a prosecutor but in washington dc the swamp she doesn't understand it
[03:41:52.360 --> 03:41:56.920]  she doesn't understand it yet and you know fox does this and fox does a good job and i commend
[03:41:56.920 --> 03:42:01.960]  them but they're doing it to boost ratings they they want people to think that something's going
[03:42:01.960 --> 03:42:07.320]  to happen but we know it's not going to happen same thing for hannity you know this optimism or
[03:42:07.320 --> 03:42:11.720]  or sarah carter or john soman i know them both they're nice people they're good reporters but
[03:42:11.720 --> 03:42:17.880]  it's to try to boost interest but unless you have larry claiming a special prosecutor it's not going
[03:42:17.880 --> 03:42:23.320]  to happen it's never happened in my entire right well we're gonna we're gonna come back next segment

[03:47:07.080 --> 03:47:28.600]  welcome back to infowars the alex jones show joel gilbert here coming to you right from the left
[03:47:28.600 --> 03:47:33.560]  coast with my guest larry clayman i'm gonna take a few calls in a minute but first larry i want to
[03:47:33.560 --> 03:47:40.120]  ask you you've been fighting the clintons for 30 years tell us something we don't know that would
[03:47:40.120 --> 03:47:45.960]  just horrify us even more if that's even possible did hillary order the attack on wake on the wake
[03:47:45.960 --> 03:47:51.160]  oh compound what give us one thing we don't know that people would be really shocked by
[03:47:53.880 --> 03:47:59.160]  what we don't know is what we don't know now we know that there's a pattern in practice joel
[03:47:59.160 --> 03:48:05.000]  of the clinton's going all the way back decades where they use government services they sell it
[03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:09.720]  for campaign contributions and to line their own pockets there's a lot of things we don't know now
[03:48:09.720 --> 03:48:14.680]  one of the things that i was trying to uncover was the sale of waivers to do business with iran
[03:48:14.680 --> 03:48:19.640]  while hillary clinton was secretary of state this is something that hasn't come out a democrat
[03:48:19.640 --> 03:48:25.080]  judge was appointed to this case and not one document ever came out so consequently that's
[03:48:25.080 --> 03:48:30.840]  something that we'll be looking into if i'm special counsel because she was actually selling us
[03:48:30.840 --> 03:48:36.920]  national security undermining the sanctions against iran to line her own pocket we know
[03:48:36.920 --> 03:48:41.240]  that's what they do and i also want to get into some of the judges who have covered for them
[03:48:41.800 --> 03:48:46.280]  frankly they should be indicted too for covering these things up we have i'm writing a column
[03:48:46.280 --> 03:48:53.400]  today for worldnet daily dot com about the judges and we have such politicized obama and clinton
[03:48:53.400 --> 03:48:58.840]  hacks on the bench that they slow roll everything and we've got a breakthrough that we have to start
[03:48:58.840 --> 03:49:03.560]  impeaching some of them and i'm going to be working with the judiciary committee to do that
[03:49:03.560 --> 03:49:09.080]  but as special counsel i can bring them in front of the grand jury and in fact we can indict them
[03:49:09.080 --> 03:49:13.880]  for covering things up let me give you an example amy berman jackson who's sitting on the manifold
[03:49:14.520 --> 03:49:20.440]  prosecution first of all won't let manifold out of house arrest then she puts a gag order on so he
[03:49:20.440 --> 03:49:25.800]  can't defend himself when he's being attacked in the media on top of that she's not concerned about
[03:49:25.800 --> 03:49:30.200]  the criminal grand jury leaks of muller which are criminal they're trying to destroy trump and
[03:49:30.200 --> 03:49:35.320]  everybody around him before they're even tried so these are the kinds of things if a judge violates
[03:49:35.320 --> 03:49:41.080]  his or her oath of office she should be indicted and amy berman jackson should be indicted so that's
[03:49:41.080 --> 03:49:46.520]  why i need to be special counsel i mean there will be hell right okay all right laire i think a lot
[03:49:46.520 --> 03:49:50.920]  of people like to see that let's go to rudie in california and see what he thinks of larry
[03:49:50.920 --> 03:49:58.920]  claiming as the special prosecutor rudie go ahead rudie you're on i'm kind of this uh robert
[03:49:58.920 --> 03:50:06.280]  muller is no good i mean he is the truly the state that's who he is i mean uh here i am i'm in
[03:50:06.280 --> 03:50:11.880]  california you know i was raised around democrats but i'm becoming more uh i guess you could say more
[03:50:11.880 --> 03:50:16.840]  of a conservative democrat now but i'm different than them i tell you i'm getting tired of this this
[03:50:16.840 --> 03:50:24.040]  is ridiculous okay thank you for the call uh let me go to someone else let's go to uh there's also
[03:50:24.040 --> 03:50:31.560]  a dr kelly who wants to volunteer for larry's special grand jury larry is it legal if if you
[03:50:31.560 --> 03:50:39.640]  put on a alex jones uh supporter let's let's see what dr kelly has to say are you there are with
[03:50:39.640 --> 03:50:45.880]  you today and thank you for your work and i would like to volunteer and i would like to call on all
[03:50:46.600 --> 03:50:54.120]  californians and nevadans to wake up this is the grand jury reawakening you need to get there and
[03:50:54.120 --> 03:51:01.480]  serve at your county level you need to do the accusation and indictment functions of your
[03:51:01.480 --> 03:51:08.360]  criminal grand jury as well as your civil and i've uh got to serve for three years
[03:51:08.360 --> 03:51:16.360]  in one of the 58 california counties and i would like to volunteer for this special federal grand
[03:51:16.360 --> 03:51:21.320]  jury if needed okay thank you thank you for the call larry can you take volunteers in this way
[03:51:21.320 --> 03:51:24.680]  or you'd have to get the more at random to be able to really kick ass how does it work
[03:51:25.160 --> 03:51:31.320]  so there's two ways who's on the grand jury two ways to do it i have a citizen's grand jury in a
[03:51:31.320 --> 03:51:36.120]  calif florida a very conservative place you know i'm from florida and i actually did indict
[03:51:36.120 --> 03:51:42.920]  clinton and obama and we convicted them in front of a citizen's trial okay this grand juries don't
[03:51:42.920 --> 03:51:46.920]  belong to the judicial branch they don't belong to the executive branch they don't belong to
[03:51:46.920 --> 03:51:53.880]  legislative branch judge scalia ruled that in a case united states versus williams back in 1982
[03:51:53.880 --> 03:51:59.080]  so we can do it in ourselves but the problem is we can't enforce the indictments and convictions
[03:51:59.080 --> 03:52:03.240]  and that's why if i'm special counsel you see i have the powers of the justice department the
[03:52:03.240 --> 03:52:09.480]  us marshall service and once we indict them once we convict them then you can enforce it because
[03:52:09.480 --> 03:52:13.560]  i've always said that the worst punishment for bill and hillary clinton is to be put in prison
[03:52:13.560 --> 03:52:18.600]  in the same prison cell together for the rest of their lives but those grand juries are chosen
[03:52:18.600 --> 03:52:24.040]  randomly on voter rules okay but if people want to assist us as volunteers that's something that
[03:52:24.040 --> 03:52:30.600]  we can consider so go to our website at freedomwatchusa.org sign the petition you can put
[03:52:30.600 --> 03:52:36.040]  comments up there let me know who you are and we'll be back in contact with you because we do need
[03:52:36.040 --> 03:52:41.240]  a citizen's army i'm trying to avoid joe i don't want there to be a violent revolution i want
[03:52:41.240 --> 03:52:46.520]  this to be peaceful so we need larry claiming and i know i sound like i'm advertising myself but i
[03:52:46.520 --> 03:52:51.320]  honestly believe it in my heart is that i'm the only one that will do it and can do it everybody
[03:52:51.320 --> 03:52:54.680]  else is like jeff sessions they'll put their heads in the sand because they're going to put their
[03:52:54.680 --> 03:52:59.320]  interests ahead of the country we don't have patriots anymore in positions of power in law
[03:52:59.320 --> 03:53:04.840]  enforcement that are willing to go against the quintons sessions is a nice man but he lacks us
[03:53:05.880 --> 03:53:13.800]  well how how and when did the doj and fbi and even cia become so corrupt with uh
[03:53:13.800 --> 03:53:19.320]  leftists and people that are not following the law and are on the goose chases like
[03:53:19.320 --> 03:53:25.480]  russian hoaxers instead of uh dealing with uh people making threats and islamic terrorists
[03:53:25.480 --> 03:53:32.040]  in the united states how did that happen well it's it's always been somewhat the case this is why
[03:53:32.040 --> 03:53:38.040]  i was a justice department lawyer i'm very proud when i became one i helped break up atc and t but
[03:53:38.040 --> 03:53:43.240]  i i saw how it was so politicized that if you're on the wrong side of the street you're more likely
[03:53:43.240 --> 03:53:47.880]  to be indicted and tried and if you're on the right side it would look the other way so it's
[03:53:47.880 --> 03:53:52.200]  been that way to a certain extent but over the last several decades it's gotten much worse
[03:53:52.200 --> 03:53:58.440]  it's gotten politicized 97 of the lawyers at the justice department either contributed
[03:53:58.440 --> 03:54:05.320]  monies were voted for either clinton or obama that's unbelievable they're leftists and the people at
[03:54:05.320 --> 03:54:10.680]  the top are scared to take them on like sessions because they're scared that those people wind
[03:54:10.680 --> 03:54:15.000]  up going against them leaking information smearing them whatever there's this deep state
[03:54:15.640 --> 03:54:21.560]  that is highly leftist in this country and that's why you know i want to be special counsel because
[03:54:21.560 --> 03:54:25.480]  i won't let that influence me i've always been nonpartisan i went against bush and cheney when
[03:54:25.480 --> 03:54:29.880]  they did the wrong thing but this is not the kind of a situation where you need someone who's going
[03:54:29.880 --> 03:54:35.480]  to play politics our country's hanging in the balance president trump is our last hope uh before
[03:54:35.480 --> 03:54:40.280]  we get something even worse than obama and clinton and we need to do whatever we can to bring about
[03:54:40.280 --> 03:54:47.240]  justice to get these leftists financed by george soros this and i'm of jewish origin myself i'm
[03:54:47.240 --> 03:54:51.480]  a christian i'm a jewish christian so i don't mean this in an anti-semitic way but he's an ant he's
[03:54:51.480 --> 03:54:57.720]  a self-hating jew who assisted the nazis in world war two and confiscating property from the jewish
[03:54:57.720 --> 03:55:03.800]  people this is the guy who's financing the democratic party and obama and clinton and and the rest of
[03:55:03.800 --> 03:55:08.760]  them he's he's extremely powerful let me let me make a comment about soros i want to say something
[03:55:08.760 --> 03:55:15.000]  about soros is people don't know the whole history that he was the only nazi spy that wasn't executed
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:22.040]  by the russians he shows up in uh in london dealing stolen art that the nazis had taken and
[03:55:22.040 --> 03:55:28.680]  that the soviets had then captured he he's engaging in a one-man crime wave during the cold war
[03:55:28.680 --> 03:55:34.120]  trying to collapse the british pound and then he come to the u.s with his open society program
[03:55:35.240 --> 03:55:41.960]  he's the he's somebody that if you look at his history you just have to ask the question was he
[03:55:41.960 --> 03:55:46.840]  originally a russian agent and is that why they spared him just like the nazis spared him because
[03:55:46.840 --> 03:55:54.520]  he agreed to work for them did he agree to work for the soviets once they captured him and uh i
[03:55:54.520 --> 03:55:58.120]  think if you look at his record you have to ask that question seriously let's go to one more quick
[03:55:58.120 --> 03:56:07.560]  call with uh chris in virginia uh chris you're on yeah well i was uh wondering about is how do we
[03:56:07.560 --> 03:56:13.000]  get rid of the entrenched deep state in the doj in the justice department if you look at it
[03:56:13.960 --> 03:56:19.400]  Mueller then comey then as well what they're saying about ray how do these people get slipped
[03:56:19.400 --> 03:56:26.280]  in front of the president to how they can get put in positions of power and then it filters down to
[03:56:26.280 --> 03:56:32.040]  the field agents around the country okay uh thank you for the call we only got a minute left uh larry
[03:56:32.040 --> 03:56:38.120]  can you comment is how do you get rid of this entrenched deep state 97% of lawyers are left as
[03:56:38.120 --> 03:56:43.640]  it's all throughout the system now does it even matter that trump won did did obama stacked the
[03:56:43.640 --> 03:56:49.000]  system so much that it doesn't even matter it does for the same reason president trump has the power
[03:56:49.000 --> 03:56:54.840]  to have me appointed special counsel and again go to freedom watch usa.org sign that petition
[03:56:54.840 --> 03:57:00.200]  because i send him those names and i'm also sending sessions those names he has the same power
[03:57:00.200 --> 03:57:04.920]  to clean house at the justice department he's not getting good advice right now the poor guy is
[03:57:04.920 --> 03:57:09.560]  hit with 25 different things every day of people trying to destroy him but he has the power to
[03:57:09.560 --> 03:57:14.440]  clean out the justice department i'll tell you most people there walk around like night of the
[03:57:14.440 --> 03:57:20.200]  walking dead like zombies about 30% of that of the justice department actually does his job you can
[03:57:20.200 --> 03:57:27.640]  get rid of 70% let's keep 30% who aren't inflicted by being clinton and obama loyalist okay larry
