[00:36.800 --> 00:43.960]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this 28th day of May 2014
[00:43.960 --> 00:49.440]  on this Wednesday edition we've got Paul Joseph Watson from Copenhagen Denmark
[00:49.440 --> 00:54.640]  with big breaking news on the global elite meeting to continue to plan our
[00:54.640 --> 00:58.400]  future and steal our collective destinies he's gonna be joining us a team
[00:58.400 --> 01:04.800]  minus 30 minutes we've got David Knight who's now in the country as well they're
[01:04.800 --> 01:08.760]  reporting he'll be joining us for 30 minutes at the start of the third hour
[01:08.760 --> 01:14.280]  and dr. Edward group one of my favorite guests is gonna be in studio on a host of
[01:14.280 --> 01:22.200]  issues in the second hour today dr. Steve Pachanik who co-wrote a bunch of books
[01:22.200 --> 01:25.000]  with Tom Clancy and was the head of psychological operations of the State
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.480]  Department and who did head up the Camp David Accords and a lot more who did
[01:29.480 --> 01:34.120]  break down how bin Laden was dead back in 2002 they had his body frozen to be
[01:34.120 --> 01:40.040]  rolled out later he's been proven right on a lot of stuff we have the tape where
[01:40.040 --> 01:50.120]  he said back in this February that Snowden is actually a spy CIA NSA and
[01:50.120 --> 01:56.920]  that he was not just an analyst or not just a tech guy now Snowden's come out
[01:56.920 --> 02:00.960]  and said that so we will definitely play that clip from when he said it earlier
[02:00.960 --> 02:04.600]  this year and I want to get him back on it maybe tomorrow maybe Friday maybe the
[02:04.600 --> 02:11.160]  Sunday show we'll see what happens with dr. Steve Pachanik and Pachanik's also
[02:11.160 --> 02:20.960]  saying that it's a false flag out in California out in Santa Barbara and he's
[02:20.960 --> 02:27.080]  a medical doctor and a psychiatrist and he's saying it's a staged event
[02:27.080 --> 02:31.920]  they're blaming all white males right now even though this guy wasn't even
[02:31.920 --> 02:37.640]  quote pure white and even though he targeted quote blonde women it should
[02:37.640 --> 02:43.160]  be blonde women targeted in racial attack but somehow it's probably blonde
[02:43.160 --> 02:51.440]  women's fault at the end of the day here so we're going to be looking at that
[02:51.440 --> 02:57.920]  coming up and we're also going to get into as I said Bilderberg more on that
[02:57.920 --> 03:02.800]  we have video up on info wars.com and prison planet.com reporters arrested as

[09:03.440 --> 09:07.960]  2014 Paul Watson joins us from Copenhagen Denmark at the bottom of the
[09:07.960 --> 09:12.480]  hour to break down big developments there with Bilderberg group and really the
[09:12.480 --> 09:17.160]  future destiny of our world being continued to be steered we also are
[09:17.160 --> 09:22.120]  going to have David Knight and Josh Owens pop in as well later in the
[09:22.120 --> 09:26.960]  transmission there is so much dealing with the stock market with Edward
[09:26.960 --> 09:33.840]  Snowden with so many other issues that we're going to be breaking down in great
[09:33.840 --> 09:43.360]  detail today but first off I had arguments with Kurt Nemo and with Steve
[09:43.360 --> 09:49.200]  Pachennick separately friendly arguments when they were both saying they
[09:49.200 --> 09:53.800]  thought Snowden was some type of globalist double agent operative to
[09:53.800 --> 09:59.160]  actually roll out limited hangout only some of the NSA spying because it could
[09:59.160 --> 10:05.160]  no longer be covered up anymore and Pachennick said this last year he said
[10:05.160 --> 10:10.160]  it in February of this year on this show we have a clip of that we're going to
[10:10.160 --> 10:16.600]  play later well now Snowden comes out and says I'm a real spy on a low level
[10:16.600 --> 10:28.480]  I work for the CIA and the NSA if he now now now that isn't an admission that he's
[10:28.480 --> 10:33.360]  a double agent working to sell NSA spying because he's been critical of it
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.680]  and he's been critical of Putin maybe he's just saying hey you know you guys
[10:38.680 --> 10:45.440]  know that I was more than just a administrative technical person who had
[10:45.440 --> 10:52.160]  access to a bunch of data I'm more than that there's a lot of different corporate
[10:52.160 --> 10:57.840]  interests though that are transnational and are more entrenched than even just
[10:57.840 --> 11:02.280]  one nation against another it's very cloak and dagger I don't know but
[11:02.280 --> 11:07.520]  Schenick says that it's a coming out operation for the NSA and that Snowden
[11:07.520 --> 11:12.720]  works for the NSA and this is them preparing to bring him back to the US
[11:12.720 --> 11:17.560]  so he can now be the leader of the anti-surveillance movement and then
[11:17.560 --> 11:25.760]  betray it and at that point it just gets so cloak and dagger gives me a headache
[11:25.760 --> 11:32.560]  but Pachennick did say that and now much of us come through and Nemo has been very
[11:32.560 --> 11:37.080]  suspicious of him and written articles showing a bunch of connections to where
[11:37.080 --> 11:42.920]  they leaked the info and how they leaked it to the NSA the British
[11:42.920 --> 11:48.440]  intelligence as well and the CIA and and I told Kurt I said look you can write
[11:48.440 --> 11:51.760]  these articles because I don't get involved a lot with what my writers
[11:51.760 --> 11:54.840]  write I mean I know they're already smart guys that care about freedom we all
[11:54.840 --> 11:58.200]  differ a little bit on our views that's normal I don't run a Kim Jong-un police
[11:58.200 --> 12:02.880]  state around here but I think things are shifting more towards the curtain
[12:02.880 --> 12:14.720]  Nemo Steve Pachennick camp right now and it gives me a headache trying to see all
[12:14.720 --> 12:20.520]  the angles here I guess Nemo's probably right though you go off how he leaked it
[12:20.520 --> 12:27.520]  who he did it through how the telecoms want to actually cut the NSA out of
[12:27.520 --> 12:33.760]  control in the architecture they built that is far surpassed the NSA and I
[12:33.760 --> 12:39.480]  think therein lies the area that Snowden may work if he is a triple or double
[12:39.480 --> 12:48.760]  agent for a deeply aligned
[12:48.760 --> 12:59.480]  movement of corporations where they want to control the opposition but that
[12:59.480 --> 13:05.360]  itself could be a way to cause a distraction and infighting and a diversion
[13:05.360 --> 13:11.040]  and then change the story off of the NSA spying on the surveillance ubiquitous
[13:11.040 --> 13:16.520]  big brother grid on to Snowden and is he a globalist agent but I think in this
[13:16.520 --> 13:21.920]  age of paranoia and this age of deceit and this age of betrayal I think it's to
[13:21.920 --> 13:27.920]  be expected that people don't trust anyone that's why you've got to have a
[13:27.920 --> 13:39.720]  long track record you've got to see consistently where people stand I know
[13:39.720 --> 13:42.560]  the Russians really tried to get rid of Snowden they didn't want him there and
[13:42.560 --> 13:48.440]  no one would take him anywhere else they couldn't get rid of him and now they've
[13:48.440 --> 13:52.960]  basically just parked him working at a website the Russians have so now the
[13:52.960 --> 13:58.640]  media is kind of acting like maybe Snowden's not so bad bringing back I
[14:00.480 --> 14:12.160]  think time will tell I think time will tell I want to play a report that we
[14:12.160 --> 14:16.240]  shot last Friday before David night left town we're gonna premiere here that
[14:16.240 --> 14:19.840]  they just finished yesterday that deals with the history of Bilderberg in just
[14:19.840 --> 14:25.480]  four short minutes the kind of reprimed folks for why Bilderberg so important
[14:25.480 --> 14:29.480]  and why we're covering it it's not the apex of the world government it's not
[14:29.480 --> 14:37.800]  the paramount of the world government it's one of the unsubmerged tips of an
[14:37.800 --> 14:41.800]  iceberg showing larger structures under it and it's a major window into how the
[14:41.800 --> 14:46.440]  world really works and into globalization and the technocratic age that
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.360]  presents you wrote about so it's an entrance into Mordor something they
[14:51.360 --> 14:59.920]  denied ever existed so ladies and gentlemen without further ado let's go
[14:59.920 --> 15:08.440]  ahead and go to this piece the Bilderberg overlords with David Knight put
[15:08.440 --> 15:13.400]  together by Darren McBrane
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.360]  last week elections in the UK saw a huge defection from conservative and
[15:27.360 --> 15:32.560]  Labour parties UKIP a party opposed to the European Union surged from just two
[15:32.560 --> 15:37.040]  seats to more than 150 seats now of course the mainstream media globally
[15:37.040 --> 15:42.680]  dismissed them as wait for it racists but actually they're just opposed to
[15:42.680 --> 15:47.680]  globalist control and that doesn't make them xenophobes or racists now one
[15:47.680 --> 15:51.320]  mainstream media the economists got it right they said throughout Europe
[15:51.320 --> 15:56.520]  broadly anti EU parties are rising as an indictment of the European Union a
[15:56.520 --> 16:00.280]  project that millions of voters have come to associate with hardship and
[16:00.280 --> 16:05.760]  failure they said this is an issue of democracy not of economics voters not
[16:05.760 --> 16:09.280]  impressed when they toss out an incumbent government only to be told by the
[16:09.280 --> 16:13.800]  EU that its replacement must stick to the same fiscal rules and economic
[16:13.800 --> 16:18.720]  policies and we've seen that happen in Greece and in Italy for an Italian
[16:18.720 --> 16:22.960]  member of the European Parliament Borgesio pointed out Mario Monti and
[16:22.960 --> 16:26.240]  he's the Goldman Sachs banker who replaced a democratically elected Prime
[16:26.240 --> 16:31.480]  Minister and Italian Minister Letta are members of Bilderberg and Rienzi the
[16:31.480 --> 16:35.800]  current Prime Minister is their puppet that's right Bilderberg it's not just
[16:35.800 --> 16:39.440]  where European political puppets go to get their job but it's also where
[16:39.440 --> 16:44.320]  American presidential hopefuls go to audition for their job Bilderberg always
[16:44.320 --> 16:50.200]  insist on a media blackout by June of 2008 we had already figured out that
[16:50.200 --> 16:54.880]  Barack Obama was the elite's puppet of choice the national media claimed that
[16:54.880 --> 16:59.040]  during the weekend the Bilderberg group was scheduled to meet that Obama had
[16:59.040 --> 17:04.960]  speaking engagements set for Chicago in the Midwest we knew better in a classic
[17:04.960 --> 17:09.600]  bait-and-switch the Obama campaign told the press corps to get on Obama's
[17:09.600 --> 17:14.960]  campaign plane and that Obama would join them on the flight to Chicago campaign
[17:14.960 --> 17:20.200]  staff then slam the door shut the fawning press had been shanghide as
[17:20.200 --> 17:25.680]  Obama's campaign aircraft lifted off without Obama the Bilderberg group sits
[17:25.680 --> 17:30.600]  at the top of the world power structure 125 of the richest and most
[17:30.600 --> 17:34.520]  influential individuals on the globe make up its membership but the European
[17:34.520 --> 17:38.600]  Union itself as well as a unified currency of the euro were planned in the
[17:38.600 --> 17:42.080]  1950s at Bilderberg as the chairman of Bilderberg
[17:42.080 --> 17:46.520]  Devin Jaune bragged about in 2009 that's why the Italian MEP
[17:46.520 --> 17:51.440]  Borgasio called Bilderberg the root of all evil and other prominent Italians
[17:51.440 --> 17:55.640]  have called for criminal investigation of Bilderberg well as bad as the
[17:55.640 --> 18:00.800]  EU has been for Europe Bilderberg has plans for America as well that's what
[18:00.800 --> 18:05.720]  tafta the transatlantic free trade agreement as well as TPP the trans
[18:05.720 --> 18:11.200]  Pacific partnership will do to America now one will unite us to Europe the
[18:11.200 --> 18:16.920]  other will unite us to Asia both of them will destroy our economy as well as our
[18:16.920 --> 18:21.640]  sovereignty putting us under the rule of globalist corporations and bankers but
[18:21.640 --> 18:25.080]  of course the mainstream media has for decades pretended that Bilderberg doesn't
[18:25.080 --> 18:29.800]  even exist they've ridiculed Jim Tucker Daniel Estolin Alex Jones and others
[18:29.800 --> 18:34.320]  reported on Bilderberg even last year Alex Jones was ridiculed as an idiot and
[18:34.320 --> 18:38.120]  a conspiracy theorist on the BBC for his coverage of last year's Bilderberg
[18:38.120 --> 18:43.240]  meeting in the UK there may be a conspiracy but it's not a theory as Paul
[18:43.240 --> 18:48.600]  Joseph Watson reported just last week a Berlin based magazine Cicero quoted a
[18:48.600 --> 18:52.920]  Bilderberg member is saying those sentences which really matter are being
[18:52.920 --> 18:58.160]  spoken at Bilderberg you learn an incredible amount Davos in comparison is
[18:58.160 --> 19:01.680]  pure PR talk now of course the mainstream media will be all over the
[19:01.680 --> 19:06.120]  economic summit at Davos but the question is will they even show up to the

[24:22.280 --> 24:25.560]  Watson's coming up in the next segment talk about Bilderberg I'm gonna get his
[24:25.560 --> 24:32.000]  take on Snowden as well we have that clip in February a pochetic saying that
[24:32.000 --> 24:38.480]  Snowden's an operative I didn't really shut him down but I just at that point I
[24:38.480 --> 24:43.440]  just didn't see proof and now Snowden's come out saying he was really an operative
[24:43.440 --> 24:49.360]  of the CIA and NSA and that he's a patriot and everything he did was quote
[24:49.360 --> 24:54.640]  for America that has like a double meaning so we're gonna get pochetic on
[24:54.640 --> 24:59.840]  to break that down I'm not throwing Snowden under the bus right now or the
[24:59.840 --> 25:07.760]  Guardian or any of these groups but he's saying it's a false flag pochetic is as
[25:07.760 --> 25:12.880]  well out in Santa Barbara you know it's hard to say a little skinny nerd could
[25:12.880 --> 25:17.720]  kill three people with a knife without them in able to fight back but I mean
[25:17.720 --> 25:23.080]  have you ever seen a mentally ill person how hard it is to control him I don't
[25:23.080 --> 25:27.560]  know I just know white people are being blamed for this he he targeted the most
[25:27.560 --> 25:32.760]  white of white so it's white people's fault I mean it just I slept on a banana
[25:32.760 --> 25:40.240]  pill last week and did you know it was because of white people I want to go to
[25:40.240 --> 25:45.200]  this clip of this full videos up on info wars.com reporters arrested as cloak
[25:45.200 --> 25:49.800]  of secrecy begins agenda for Bilderberg confab illustrates global elite in a
[25:49.800 --> 25:54.880]  panic and one of our great writers here should do a whole story on Daniel
[25:54.880 --> 26:00.240]  Estalon yesterday and the fact that in 2006 he said Bilderberg was going to
[26:00.240 --> 26:04.520]  implode the housing market in 2008 indeed that happened from his sources I
[26:04.520 --> 26:11.240]  have to know who one of his sources is in fact the only reason I can talk about
[26:11.240 --> 26:21.280]  it is some of it actually came out in the newspaper years after that I'm not
[26:21.280 --> 26:24.000]  even gonna say it you know what even though it's public and hiding in blame
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.200]  view I'm not gonna say who the source is the point is Estalon has real sources
[26:28.200 --> 26:34.720]  and he gave nine points yesterday of the real agenda that's the real agenda
[26:34.720 --> 26:39.120]  that was sent weeks ago to one of the members who doesn't like the agenda so
[26:39.120 --> 26:43.080]  they're not all bad in there a lot of them are there because they're at the
[26:43.080 --> 26:48.280]  top of their field and again they're all key managers off for other sectors and
[26:48.280 --> 26:53.720]  other combines and it is a consensus but they're already in the consensus
[26:53.720 --> 26:56.800]  because they were already in another consensus then they just have fine
[26:56.800 --> 27:02.000]  tuning of the consensus and again they didn't want this to be known that it
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.960]  existed it's over for the system I know I keep saying this because it's so
[27:05.960 --> 27:11.140]  important it's like having the plans of the Death Star folks if you have the
[27:11.140 --> 27:14.600]  plans you can blow it up politically that it's an illegitimate corporate
[27:14.600 --> 27:19.960]  takeover that seeks to end free market end the family in humanity as we know
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.440]  it in a technological technocratic takeover for a tiny elite it's bad for
[27:24.440 --> 27:29.120]  ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine we've done
[27:29.120 --> 27:33.920]  the math before there's six thousand super class in the Kissinger groups on
[27:33.920 --> 27:37.760]  analysis which I agree with six thousand super gophers less than 20 families
[27:37.760 --> 27:42.360]  that own pretty much everything so a few hundred people that own it six thousand
[27:42.360 --> 27:47.760]  that serve them six thousand people in the super control class you divide that
[27:47.760 --> 27:54.480]  to seven billion three hundred million it's point zero zero zero zero zero zero two
[27:54.480 --> 28:00.840]  three I think so when they say it's the one percent the enemy no no the globalists
[28:00.840 --> 28:04.640]  are going after the one percent because they're of the middle class wealth some
[28:04.640 --> 28:09.160]  guy that makes a million dollars a year folks is in the one percent you ought to
[28:09.160 --> 28:15.480]  be kissing their booty they are the ones that buy the sports cars and come to
[28:15.480 --> 28:19.640]  your restaurant and get their hair done in there you know their wife divorces them
[28:19.640 --> 28:22.880]  and the lawyers get the money and their kids go to private school they are the
[28:22.880 --> 28:27.720]  economy the globalists have said this you get rid of the nouveau rich upper end
[28:27.720 --> 28:31.880]  of the middle class the new rich you shut down most of the economy and you shut
[28:31.880 --> 28:36.360]  down the ladders up how many of you out there work for somebody who's nouveau
[28:36.360 --> 28:40.040]  rich wealthy has a big house nice cars and you charge them much of money do
[28:40.040 --> 28:43.560]  stuff on their house and do things and they and I mean how would you do if they
[28:43.560 --> 28:47.320]  were gone well there you go you'd be in a third world country let's go to the clip

[33:44.960 --> 33:49.520]  instincts are starting to look like they may be correct with Snowden
[33:49.520 --> 33:54.640]  basically admitting as much Bilderberg 2014 reporters arrested as cloak of
[33:54.640 --> 33:59.080]  secrecy descends there's no footage of the actual arrest because Watson who
[33:59.080 --> 34:02.920]  shot most of it was able to creep off we have on the line they seized Radowski's

[35:17.840 --> 35:25.480]  civilian life you're going to jail for a very long time I tell you the government
[35:25.480 --> 35:29.120]  is just so abusive across the board there's a culture of just getting away

[35:47.960 --> 35:52.760]  generally in Virginia and because they've got a special relationship with
[35:52.760 --> 35:58.400]  the head of Marriott it's generally at a Marriott five-star resort surrounded on
[35:58.400 --> 36:02.480]  multiple sides by water and that's what they've done in the government district
[36:02.480 --> 36:07.640]  of the capital of Denmark Copenhagen they have done that yet again we got the

[36:16.360 --> 36:20.200]  Guardian covered it we are seeing some German and and other papers covering it
[36:20.200 --> 36:25.480]  but no US media covering it joining us to describe the arrest he witnessed
[36:25.480 --> 36:29.640]  yesterday and the fence they've put up and they've now shut the hotel down
[36:29.640 --> 36:33.640]  throwing people out that had reservations right through to today
[36:33.640 --> 36:40.440]  putting Paul Watson is our own Paul Watson then our other reporters that
[36:40.440 --> 36:45.160]  haven't yet been thrown out by security is under common law and we check the EU
[36:45.160 --> 36:49.160]  law and they'll be able to be told to get off before they get arrested so I'll
[36:49.160 --> 36:53.000]  have David Knight and Josh Owens try to go in later today be a live video and
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.280]  audio feeds we'll see if they can get a live Skype feed there on the ground
[36:56.280 --> 37:00.920]  that's coming up in about an hour but Paul Watson a lot is unfolding a lot is
[37:00.920 --> 37:06.000]  going on we also have Esteline with a major source breaking down their real
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.080]  agenda that I know dovetails with your intel you join us via video Skype from
[37:10.080 --> 37:14.040]  your nearby hotel break down what you've seen at Bilderberg 2014 as it
[37:14.040 --> 37:18.440]  prepares to officially kick off tomorrow as the kleptocrats begin arriving
[37:18.440 --> 37:23.080]  Alex yeah if you want to pick up from last night which is when I was last on
[37:23.080 --> 37:30.120]  the show basically we gathered in the lobby just about an hour after I got
[37:30.120 --> 37:34.440]  off your show probably and they're obviously more Bilderberg organizers
[37:34.440 --> 37:37.800]  milling around there was a plan to go to dinner and kind of here we go on some
[37:37.800 --> 37:42.960]  of them but mainly they're speaking in Dutch and so while we were there
[37:42.960 --> 37:46.800]  obviously we were checked in that all went smoothly I've checked into the room
[37:46.800 --> 37:52.080]  we were due to stay there that night Luke Radowski and Dan Dix were also there
[37:52.080 --> 37:55.960]  obviously and they decided to go ahead and confront the Bilderberg organizers
[37:55.960 --> 38:00.480]  straight up so they just walked up to them with the camera started asking them
[38:00.480 --> 38:05.280]  questions about Bill Bilderberg at first they pretended not to know anything
[38:05.280 --> 38:08.920]  about it then it became obvious that they did and the security was called
[38:08.920 --> 38:15.680]  within about two minutes and the issue was they demanded we delete every photo
[38:15.680 --> 38:19.240]  or video that we'd already taken which is pretty stupid in the days of live
[38:19.240 --> 38:24.400]  streaming and incident uploads to Twitter so they went around demanding we all
[38:24.400 --> 38:31.040]  delete our footage obviously my plan was to stay in the hotel and gather some
[38:31.040 --> 38:35.320]  intel so I didn't want to get yeah that was a great plan but that's not gonna happen
[38:35.320 --> 38:42.520]  now please continue so obviously Luke and Dan refused to delete their footage
[38:42.520 --> 38:47.000]  they said we just want to leave we're leaving the hotel started to walk out
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.920]  the door we all basically got out of the hotel but Dan was still in there grabbed
[38:52.920 --> 38:58.680]  him by the arm they physically restrained him at that point we left Luke was still
[38:58.680 --> 39:03.560]  there with Dan and they called the police and ended up being arrested for
[39:03.560 --> 39:08.320]  initially they said they had drugs on them which was completely made up and
[39:08.320 --> 39:11.600]  then they said they were just acting suspiciously so they arrested them and
[39:11.600 --> 39:15.800]  think they were released within a couple of hours afterwards but again it's just
[39:15.800 --> 39:19.640]  illustrates a complete paranoia surrounding the site which is you know
[39:19.640 --> 39:22.720]  even worse than it was last year and Watford basically where they didn't even
[39:22.720 --> 39:27.560]  let us in they let us in this time but the security there is even more intense
[39:27.560 --> 39:31.280]  well let's get technical we were in there three days for it even started and
[39:31.280 --> 39:35.000]  went in to get dinner and they all surround us and go mr. Jones you've
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.800]  got to leave and I said I'm a guest I'm hadn't checked in yet I wanted to snoop
[39:40.800 --> 39:44.920]  around before I even let him throw me out and remember we just kept eating and
[39:44.920 --> 39:47.680]  drinking with the security guys all standing around they got madder and
[39:47.680 --> 39:53.200]  matter that was fine well this time around I mean I posted the image on
[39:53.200 --> 39:57.000]  Twitter they roped off the stairs from the lobby going up to the second floor
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.960]  because Bilderberg has taken over the entire second floor of that hotel
[39:59.960 --> 40:04.560]  actually I went up the staff the emergency back stairs which are only
[40:04.560 --> 40:08.600]  used by the staff and you could get to every level apart from two they
[40:08.600 --> 40:12.800]  completely sealed off the entrance to level two via the back stairs as if it
[40:12.800 --> 40:17.240]  never existed which was probably some kind of fire hazard or something but and
[40:17.240 --> 40:20.000]  then if you got out on the lift at the second floor there were people there
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.760]  immediately you know ushering you back in so that's all locked down they got
[40:24.760 --> 40:28.120]  people patrolling the bridges around they're telling ice cream sellers a
[40:28.120 --> 40:32.440]  mile away to look out for suspicious people if you so much as have a camera
[40:32.440 --> 40:36.600]  anywhere near the hotel they come and harass you today we met with the police
[40:36.600 --> 40:41.760]  liaison and they've given us a spot right as the cars come in so we'll be
[40:41.760 --> 40:46.680]  right up against the cars inside the hotel grounds as they come in as media
[40:46.680 --> 40:51.240]  that's a different spot from where all the protesters will be so they're going
[40:51.240 --> 40:56.160]  to allow a limited amount of media up to 20 people they said in that area to take
[40:56.160 --> 41:00.560]  footage live streaming as Bilderberg members are driving in so we met with
[41:00.560 --> 41:05.120]  the dialogue police is what they called today he walked us to the site and
[41:05.120 --> 41:10.200]  pointed out where they'd graciously allow us to stand and take footage is made
[41:10.200 --> 41:14.680]  very clear that it we couldn't express any kind of opinion or protest that it
[41:14.680 --> 41:19.160]  was simply for observation and documentation purposes but you know it
[41:19.160 --> 41:25.000]  certainly had a lot better spot than it was last year in Watford well Paul I
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.800]  see you're tweeting at your Twitter and that's great please put them out on the
[41:27.800 --> 41:31.280]  Alex Jones channel so a larger audience can see them maybe put an article
[41:31.280 --> 41:35.120]  together with some of the photos because I want people to be able to see them and
[41:35.120 --> 41:38.800]  I know you're about to have a camera crew there so they can get more out but
[41:38.800 --> 41:43.120]  people are really ready to see you do some live feeds as well I'd like you to
[41:43.120 --> 41:48.400]  cover our reporters they try to go in with a live you stream feed so that we
[41:48.400 --> 41:52.080]  have multiple angles on that today that would be excellent how's your internet
[41:52.080 --> 41:57.320]  working there it's not great in the hotel to be honest I mean it's a four-star
[41:57.320 --> 42:03.920]  hotel but the internet is not great here in terms of the area around the hotel
[42:03.920 --> 42:08.400]  there should be a full cell phone signal well let's get some live feeds going for
[42:08.400 --> 42:15.240]  all the folks out there a quarterbacking this from remote I know we saw as many
[42:15.240 --> 42:19.800]  as four thousand anyone time at Watford biggest crowd ever protesting in
[42:19.800 --> 42:24.080]  England north of London what do you expect this year I know it's more
[42:24.080 --> 42:28.640]  remote it's more costly in that area I tried to meet a few years ago I guess
[42:28.640 --> 42:31.560]  three years ago up on top of Swiss Mountain when you were there and that
[42:31.560 --> 42:34.440]  became an international debacle but still hundreds of protesters showed up
[42:34.440 --> 42:40.280]  there how many do you expect to show up tomorrow well obviously you don't have
[42:40.280 --> 42:43.880]  the big Alex Jones David Ike draw so they certainly won't be anywhere near
[42:43.880 --> 42:48.680]  like there was last year the organizers were talking about the thousand but I
[42:48.680 --> 42:52.240]  think that's optimistic I mean there's nobody there now isn't there are no
[42:52.240 --> 42:56.440]  protesters at all it's completely vacant obviously they'll start to turn up
[42:56.440 --> 43:00.720]  tomorrow so I would imagine probably two or three hundred on each day would be a
[43:00.720 --> 43:06.680]  fair guess now Esteline broke down some of the things on their agenda stop the
[43:06.680 --> 43:10.840]  rise of nationalist movements that can block globalization the bankruptcy of
[43:10.840 --> 43:15.040]  Europe people really know the EU's unelected tyrannical now talked about
[43:15.040 --> 43:20.920]  their plan to try to block Russian gas supplies their plan to you know bring in
[43:20.920 --> 43:25.960]  more and more web censorship from our sources Paul there I know you're
[43:25.960 --> 43:29.240]  developing sources on the ground as well other intel you've got on their
[43:29.240 --> 43:35.840]  agenda well obviously the presence of the supreme allied commander of Europe
[43:35.840 --> 43:40.760]  Philip Breedlove in addition to Anders Rasmussen the NATO Secretary General
[43:40.760 --> 43:44.280]  remember that every single NATO Secretary General has also been a
[43:44.280 --> 43:49.080]  Bilderberg member their presence obviously underlines what we revealed a
[43:49.080 --> 43:53.160]  few days ago beforehand which was that Ukraine and the collapse of this
[43:53.160 --> 43:57.400]  unipolar agenda is going to be at the head of the table in terms of
[43:57.400 --> 44:03.320]  discussion and we were actually talking to some US Army who were staying in the
[44:03.320 --> 44:08.240]  hotel as personal protection for the supreme allied commander of Europe
[44:08.240 --> 44:12.000]  Philip Breedlove they basically go around the world as his personal
[44:12.000 --> 44:16.600]  protection so that is going to be a major topic of discussion obviously you've
[44:16.600 --> 44:20.960]  got Christine Lagarde there who oversaw the stripping and looting of Ukraine
[44:20.960 --> 44:27.160]  with the IMF loans and you've got the mayor of Atlanta Kazim Reed we know
[44:27.160 --> 44:32.160]  that Bill Clinton attended in 1991 as a little known governor of Arkansas then
[44:32.160 --> 44:37.240]  he was elected president so he looks like same thing with Tony Blair when they
[44:37.240 --> 44:41.160]  get a mayor or a governor or a senator at the meeting it means they're being
[44:41.160 --> 44:46.760]  looked at as presidential material exactly and then the future of
[44:46.760 --> 44:50.840]  democracy in the middle-class trap and then they're talking about is the
[44:50.840 --> 44:54.600]  economic recovery sustainable which again you go back to 2006 they were
[44:54.600 --> 44:58.080]  positioning themselves for the financial collapse so the fact that they're
[44:58.080 --> 45:01.720]  putting doubt as to whether the so-called economic recovery which of
[45:01.720 --> 45:05.160]  course is nothing of the sort but the fact that they're talking about that
[45:05.160 --> 45:10.880]  again is ominous does privacy exist which is you know closer to should
[45:10.880 --> 45:17.480]  privacy exist in their eyes with bombshell green wall snowden revelations
[45:17.480 --> 45:21.240]  to come we know that the the biggest of those revelations are yet to come which
[45:21.240 --> 45:24.960]  is basically what we already know that they're recording not only metadata
[45:24.960 --> 45:28.800]  they're recording actual conversations of people within the United States that's
[45:28.800 --> 45:33.240]  why they have these huge storage facilities if it was only the metadata
[45:33.240 --> 45:36.920]  they wouldn't need storage facilities that big of course they're tracking it
[45:36.920 --> 45:44.280]  all in real time that's on record you know the top psych warfare expert Dr.
[45:44.280 --> 45:50.280]  Steve Pachennick said he didn't think he he says he knows Alexander he knows
[45:50.280 --> 45:54.320]  Clapper and he said this last year and he said again in February he said look
[45:54.320 --> 45:59.600]  this is all coming out snowden works for us hey hey hey and he wanted to come on
[45:59.600 --> 46:03.240]  there and talk about that I just said you know what I said that might be a
[46:03.240 --> 46:09.000]  sigh up from you to then discrediting he goes no this is a coming out of it this
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.360]  is so they can control the debate and limit what really comes out and now
[46:13.360 --> 46:19.800]  snowden came out as folks know on NBC news basically said look I'm CIA NSA you
[46:19.800 --> 46:23.920]  know high-level operative and I did what I did for America so you got to let me
[46:23.920 --> 46:27.960]  come back to America and the media is now lightening up on him Paul what does
[46:27.960 --> 46:33.840]  your gut tell you on that front I haven't read that article Alex all I know is
[46:33.840 --> 46:38.600]  that I've repeatedly tried to get Glenn Greenwald to come on your show and he
[46:38.600 --> 46:42.200]  at first he says you know he might do it and then you just never hear from him
[46:42.200 --> 46:48.100]  again so well I mean I've had people on the show before and Assange is in the
[46:48.100 --> 46:51.880]  background like Jones Dr. Yerra the member of Parliament and he's there in
[46:51.880 --> 46:55.400]  the room and then during the break we talked about all the big listener but
[46:55.400 --> 46:59.920]  you know I could come on later and then all these people listen to the show and
[46:59.920 --> 47:04.300]  I mean not that big a deal even getting them on it's just that yeah it's well
[47:04.300 --> 47:08.360]  Nemo's done the articles showing their connection to all these different spook
[47:08.360 --> 47:13.640]  organizations go ahead I haven't seen the NBC interview so I don't know what
[47:13.640 --> 47:18.840]  Snowden said he said I was trained as a spy and did operations for the NSA and
[47:18.840 --> 47:26.440]  CIA all over Europe in deep cover right exactly which is exactly what what
[47:26.440 --> 47:31.000]  Pachennik said he's one of our operatives Alex he's doing an under
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.440]  authorization I expect the Russians to kick him out later which they're trying
[47:35.440 --> 47:40.120]  to do yeah everything's gonna be fine Alex I know he's listening to the show
[47:40.120 --> 47:45.800]  right now a pretty good imitation of Jenick right what do you think what do
[47:45.800 --> 47:50.000]  you think I mean it was known that he worked for the CIA I don't think that's
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.840]  a big admission that he's some undercover operative no no no no he worked
[47:53.840 --> 47:57.280]  putting in equipment systems so they claim he had administrative access over
[47:57.280 --> 48:03.000]  a bunch of stuff now he's going look no I was deep cover in Europe CIA NSA on
[48:03.000 --> 48:08.000]  operations well if you if you read Greenwald's new book then it's it's clear
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.280]  that Snowden tried to approach the Washington Post with all this
[48:11.280 --> 48:15.280]  information and they basically weren't interested so and the New York Times and
[48:15.280 --> 48:20.840]  the New York Times yeah so I don't I hear that all the time that Snowden's a
[48:20.840 --> 48:24.680]  double agent I don't personally I don't really buy it well the reason we've had
[48:24.680 --> 48:27.680]  private discussions about this is the reason I agree with you overall is he
[48:27.680 --> 48:31.440]  could be manipulated by the system but that they don't like this coming out if
[48:31.440 --> 48:37.000]  this is full disclosure and it's hurting them and it is why would they trigger it
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.400]  or does he represent a subgroup the big telecoms that are in a fight with NSA
[48:42.400 --> 48:46.400]  over total information dominance and they want the crystal ball
[48:46.400 --> 48:51.520]  Palantir controls they don't want government with Palantir I don't know
[48:51.520 --> 48:55.000]  Alex because there's a tendency to try and strip down anybody who speaks out
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.400]  when you do it to you they say I know full well I'm not an operative exactly
[48:59.400 --> 49:04.480]  yeah so I am Bill next there's always suspicion generated against anybody who's
[49:04.480 --> 49:09.000]  that public and it comes to the point where you know everything's fake the
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.880]  stage events they never happened this person's an inside job that person's a
[49:13.880 --> 49:17.560]  double agent there are some people who actually just speak out based on their
[49:17.560 --> 49:20.800]  own conscience and stuff no no we have whistleblowers all the time that are for
[49:20.800 --> 49:24.720]  real and it shakes the system to score I mean I have to know the state police
[49:24.720 --> 49:31.920]  guy that first gave me a document on my act got demoted because of it and a
[49:31.920 --> 49:37.080]  federal marshal gave me info they didn't figure out who he was because he
[49:37.080 --> 49:41.800]  slipped it to me by hand the I mean that's why Matt drudge said if you're
[49:41.800 --> 49:45.600]  got a whistleblower you got to meet in a parking garage I mean you really do
[49:45.600 --> 49:50.560]  folks and of course they've always known that any time I've gotten really good
[49:50.560 --> 49:56.080]  intel the best stuff where people don't get burned well a preacher gave me the
[49:56.080 --> 49:59.760]  clergy response team documents four years before it was in the news FEMA
[49:59.760 --> 50:05.040]  visited him a week later he went to a grocery store and faxed it to us and
[50:05.040 --> 50:09.080]  they went and pulled the data and went and found out who he was can you believe
[50:09.080 --> 50:14.120]  that that's how surveilled stuff is but they haven't gotten the FBI the military
[50:14.120 --> 50:18.840]  and the federal marshals that have given us stuff because they give it to me by
[50:18.840 --> 50:24.880]  hand Paul no exactly the thing we've snowed and though is you know there's
[50:24.880 --> 50:29.000]  this infighting between WikiLeaks and Greenwald because there's this criticism
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.920]  that they don't release it all in one go they don't dump the data but I don't
[50:33.920 --> 50:37.160]  think that makes sense if you're in the position of Greenwald you want to dole
[50:37.160 --> 50:41.560]  it out and keep it in the media not just for a week or two for a year as he's
[50:41.560 --> 50:45.400]  done so a lot of the criticisms directed to work towards Greenwald and
[50:45.400 --> 50:48.960]  Snowden even though not particularly have any affinity with them because they
[50:48.960 --> 50:53.920]  tend to ignore us but the criticisms don't make much sense which is why I'm
[50:53.920 --> 50:58.120]  kind of shagging away I think it's fair to look at it in a lot of the new
[50:58.120 --> 51:04.720]  days you know about RVs you've heard about bunkers but surviving is not
[51:04.720 --> 51:10.160]  recreation and man wasn't made to live underground introducing survivalist

[54:15.360 --> 54:20.600]  Valentine's Day Steve Pochinnick saying Snowden's an operative and doing all
[54:20.600 --> 54:26.760]  this under full authorization and more than meets the eye here it is
[54:26.760 --> 54:31.960]  well I will tell you very simply I started to think of Snowden a long time
[54:31.960 --> 54:37.520]  ago as I saying I thought he was and analyzing him not as an American but
[54:37.520 --> 54:42.560]  as a count intelligence and operative or somebody who's had experience in
[54:42.560 --> 54:45.560]  count intelligence I thought Snowden was very much what I called the
[54:45.560 --> 54:50.000]  manufactured avatar of the American intelligence community what do I mean by
[54:50.000 --> 54:55.080]  that I started looking at tapes of that it snowed and when he was giving these
[54:55.080 --> 55:00.240]  bombastic interviews self-aggrandizing interviews to the German press and other
[55:00.240 --> 55:04.920]  presses but in the recent press in the recent interview he very clearly stated
[55:04.920 --> 55:11.280]  to the Germans yes I was in the special forces but I broke my ankle now that was
[55:11.280 --> 55:15.000]  not credible because if you're in the special forces you don't just break your
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.320]  ankle and you don't leave but he went on to explain that the special forces was
[55:19.320 --> 55:24.720]  something that was a noble endeavor on his part and he saw it as a magnifier of
[55:24.720 --> 55:28.640]  military power in other words he gave me an explanation that was inconsistent
[55:28.640 --> 55:33.200]  with being a subcontract then he went on to really indict himself by saying in
[55:33.200 --> 55:38.160]  the interview I'm a CIA operative I was recruited by the CIA and then the NSA so
[55:38.160 --> 55:43.040]  when I'm getting at very quickly was Snowden is very typical of what we in
[55:43.040 --> 55:48.240]  the intelligence community would want to do and that is to create an avatar or a
[55:48.240 --> 55:54.240]  image of a person who may be a traitor or a whistleblower so that we allow the
[55:54.240 --> 55:59.440]  American public to play off either part of two figures that the intelligence
[55:59.440 --> 56:03.080]  community creates on the one hand the intelligence community creates this
[56:03.080 --> 56:07.760]  incredible massive surveillance where at the same time they want to make sure
[56:07.760 --> 56:12.800]  that they are not acquitted that they're not judged harshly so that they make
[56:12.800 --> 56:16.680]  sure they can control the narrative that's right it's already starting to
[56:16.680 --> 56:22.040]  come out so they have a limited hangout and dole out the information and then
[56:22.040 --> 56:25.280]  later they can have him come out and dress up in a dress like David Shaler of
[56:25.280 --> 56:31.000]  MI5 or Bradley Manning coming out the dress they found that's the best way
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.840]  to discredit something make him an icon and then Snowden comes out in a big red
[56:34.840 --> 56:40.600]  dress a Chelsea Manning excuse me and I'm not kidding that we may have just
[56:40.600 --> 56:44.600]  blown their operation right there when will Snowden show up in a pink tutu is
[56:44.600 --> 56:51.960]  the question blow on some honestly don't know Alex but yeah there's there are
[56:51.960 --> 56:56.200]  enough really bad things going on that we can prove so I don't I try not to get
[56:56.200 --> 56:59.600]  into speculation too much about Snowden because I know a lot of people get
[56:59.600 --> 57:03.720]  obsessed with that kind of stuff but you know the Manning stuff and Shaler I
[57:03.720 --> 57:08.680]  mean how many whistleblowers have to come out dressed like a woman I mean you
[57:08.680 --> 57:15.120]  know that staged well I met Shaler with you back in 2005 and he was completely
[57:15.120 --> 57:18.240]  the most down-to-earth person you would ever want to know we had drinks with him
[57:18.240 --> 57:23.080]  for about five hours that was pretty odd I think he did have a mental breakdown
[57:23.080 --> 57:25.840]  but whether that was tied into something else I don't know it was
[57:25.840 --> 57:32.320]  definitely odd now that was all him blowing his whole operation at the end
[57:32.320 --> 57:36.520]  of it that's classic man I'm telling you I think Pachinix got something here I'm
[57:36.520 --> 57:39.560]  not sure he's right it may be his training makes a little too paranoid
[57:39.560 --> 57:43.640]  but it's good to be too paranoid than not enough paranoid Watson you're gonna be

[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:41.960]  ladies and gentlemen David Knight and Josh Owens and our other reporter that
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.440]  will go unnamed because obviously Bilderberg groups watching the show
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:49.040]  like to have a little ace in the hole a little secret nobody knows quote the
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:55.040]  immortal George straight they're playing got the leg is a big storms in Texas so
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.320]  they got in a day late then they wouldn't give them their rent car their
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:05.160]  luggage disappeared and this has happened to me before I'm surprised they even got
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.040]  through customs but they don't want to have the big event of reporters being
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:12.800]  stopped at customs they're smart about it so David just got arrested a few weeks
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.800]  ago a week and a half ago in Virginia at Fort AP Hill covering the FEMA camp
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:22.040]  there so they're going to be getting there in the next hour we're going to a
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:26.880]  live feed from there with Paul Watson and crew and then just we have
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:32.640]  reservations there today we're going to politely walk up to the front and then
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.640]  have them say no you can't come in it's Bilderberg and see what happens and get
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.400]  some live feeds out there and some HD feeds that could be on the nightly news
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:43.720]  tonight of that and then tomorrow we'll have all the globalist arriving we'll
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.680]  find out who's arriving who's not part of the list because that's who they're
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:55.200]  really trying to hide British royalty Rothschilds sometimes you'll get the
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.120]  person who they're about to run for president they're sneaking in I've been
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.000]  there when they snuck Hillary and Obama in I was there when they snuck Hillary in
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:11.640]  in a US State Department armored limo in 2006 when she was a senator and they
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:16.080]  they backed it in and had the American flags on it later got photos of Hillary
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.600]  in there and then Richard Holbert was going to come up and talk to us later
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.400]  learned I'm sick of these people but then I started screaming Holbrook we know
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.200]  who you are and he goes I hadn't turned around and walked away so nobody can ever
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.840]  second guess any of the reporters on the ground because you do the best job you
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.760]  can in a fluid situation and it's it's pretty easy to be Monday morning
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:40.320]  quarterbacking folks but that's all coming up and again I know for the
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.080]  audience here most of the old-time audience and steadfast audience this is
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.520]  old hat for you build a bird but you got to remember we have over a hundred and
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:52.320]  seventy MNF affiliates across the country on the weekday transmission and
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:58.120]  a lot of people are you know I've heard of it heard it made fun of now the fact
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.720]  that it's being admitted to is a big deal and I got to give credit where
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:09.520]  credits do in fall wars comm world net daily comm drugs report comm and now
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:13.680]  even the guardian have been at the absolute tip of the spirit last six
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:19.320]  seven years making all the other media that refuses to cover it look bad and
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.600]  it's important that's why CNN lost 44% of its audience last year alone of the
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.560]  already small audience they had him and that's implosion level MSNBC only lost
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:31.640]  24% of their audience last year but they'd already been losing that almost
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:34.760]  every year I mean it's it's still you start losing a smaller and smaller
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.200]  percentage of a smaller and smaller it's like having a swimming pool size
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.600]  audience 15 years ago on CNN and now having a teacup full of you know
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:47.280]  listeners and viewers I mean I harp on that because they really are the mouse
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:53.640]  that roared that I mean they really are the imperge new clothes it's it's it's
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.640]  narcissism television for women and an MSNBC is race-baiting targeting blacks
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.160]  but I've seen a demographic with blacks it's not even high I mean it's it's
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:08.800]  literally a bunch of people that all have their own narcissistic jobs as
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:13.160]  managers and as the heads of it as the anchors most of them political retreads
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.880]  from the Democratic Party and the Republican Party who just keep milking
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.080]  the industries and corporations they work for and the advertisers and I've
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.640]  talked to some of the executives I've seen them in trade publications admit
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.880]  oh it's all gonna implode the next few years it's already really imploded but
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:34.040]  we're just gonna keep riding the gravy train as long as possible so let me
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:40.200]  announce to you the mainstream media is dead the mainstream media is dead he
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:46.280]  she said God is dead which was delusional the mainstream media is dead
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:51.240]  and that's why they want to kill the new media because we really show that but
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.840]  you can't put the Janie back in the bottle you can't put Humpty Dumpty back

[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:27.840]  really glad he's here in studio with us dr. Edward group is our guest the
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:32.880]  global healing center look at this headline FBI agents synthetic biology
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:37.440]  could reduce our population the New York Times reported this is on info wars
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:42.440]  calm but the FBI agent warns of synthetic biology can reduce our
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:46.640]  population by significant percentages the New York Times reported earlier this
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.680]  month on a conference held at MIT on May 1st that discussed synthetic biology the
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.520]  conference gathered an increasing group of scientists and homeland spirit
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:01.080]  representatives who themselves admitted that this could end humanity as we know
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:09.760]  it quote the FBI agent Carmine Negro he was quoted as saying these
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.120]  technologies do not just pose a risk to individual buildings or cities but if
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:17.440]  cleverly deployed can reduce our population by significant percentages
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:23.440]  and it goes on and it's the globalist that are open-air planting synthetic
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:28.480]  biology plants are the easiest thing from the scientists about on to reprogram
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.760]  to grow live viruses whatever you want in them they call it pharmacological
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.560]  crops and it's already having repercussions I mean just look at the
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.840]  glyphosate a chemical in the water creating the epidemic of breast cancer
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:46.200]  every country where it's used I mean it on record grows breast tumors it's you
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:52.440]  know estrogen dependent tumors that's not even this new form of genetic
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:59.080]  engineering that's self-replicating it's genetic nanotech and we're all part of
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:04.560]  the experiment so that's some of what's coming up with Dr. Edward group there's
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:10.000]  so much I want to get him on about today pregnant women should take iodine
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:17.560]  supplements docs that's Newsmax just yesterday pregnant women should take an
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.160]  iodine supplement to protect brain development of their babies according
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.640]  to leading U.S. group of pediatricians oh who's been saying that forever Dr.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:28.880]  group iodine which the body can get from iodide is needed to make the thyroid
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:32.600]  hormones it literally is the building block folks that are required for
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:36.560]  children's brain development before and after birth and then it goes into the
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.480]  studies women and children of childbearing age need to pay attention to
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:44.200]  this topic as well because about half the pregnancy of the U.S. are unplanned
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:49.560]  Dr. Jerome Paulson said women in the early part of their pregnancy may not
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.280]  realize they're pregnant then it gets into the different disorders you can get
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:56.240]  but but no one will tell you this now again the feds back when they weren't
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.040]  pure evil when the eugenics were just taken over in the 20s they did positive
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.080]  eugenics not negative like we're seeing now instead wait a minute we're having
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:09.040]  mental retardation all these disorders we know in animal studies if you don't
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.880]  have iodine then your thyroid can't put out the different directives for other
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:19.680]  glands to regulate the hormones you need and you're gonna really not develop
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.800]  mentally you're gonna have all sorts of problems you're gonna have all sorts of
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.720]  behavioral problems you're gonna have all sorts of medical problems and so they
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:33.640]  said we want iodine put in all the salt that's forced medication I shouldn't have
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:37.760]  done it but it was the right thing to do it's on record that it was a miracle of
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.520]  medical health and paved the way for other forced medications like fluoride
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.960]  because folks had seen how well that it worked fluoride replaces to the same
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:51.600]  molecule chain the same area in the periodic table reblocks that so not
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.360]  only are our kids not getting the iodine they need this is the iodine
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:12:01.020]  conspiracy ladies and gentlemen they are now getting the bromine and bromide and
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:05.200]  iodine this is all mainline medical science I'm begging you to understand
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.960]  that it's the iodine conspiracy iodine slash fluoride conspiracy now he came up
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.160]  here on something completely different today I wanted to go off on this jag
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:16.640]  we'll do that at about 40 after we have a big announcement in the field of iodine
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:23.320]  this is a decade in development he he was gonna have this out a year ago and
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:27.880]  said look we can put out the survival shield now it's great it's something
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:31.360]  kids can take because it's it's not as strong as it tastes like rocket fuel
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:36.160]  it's real iodine it turns you know black on the paper when it's bound you know it
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.480]  turns electric blue you notice ours like the crystals 8,000 feet under the
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:46.160]  ground but he said I've been working on a new one I wish you'd wait that is gonna
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.840]  be unlike anything ever imagined and let me tell you I've been on it for over a
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:56.160]  month and if you thought survival shield was powerful and still great folks
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.440]  there's a lot of people can't handle the detox effect even a bit so you need to
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.520]  really check with your physician or healthcare provider we're gonna make an
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:08.720]  announcement at about 40 after so of the new breaking iodine information and
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:18.960]  when I say revolutionary I mean this is so powerful and there's it is totally new
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.000]  and from a source that no one else has and I'm just so lucky and blessed to be
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.480]  part of this and God just keeps coming through for us to you know work with
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:31.360]  group over the last four or five years as a guest and things but then to just the
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.480]  things he's developed we've got medical doctors involved others they just keep
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.600]  saying yes yes yes trailblazing a bunch of other products he's developing with
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.760]  some chemist we know and some medical doctors who's our science is all just
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.560]  meshing together dealing with mitochondrial DNA so much more it's a
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.840]  very exciting but this is really elementary it's really pathetic folks
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:54.680]  that we you have to have iodine and producer hormones and they just put
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:58.200]  other stuff in there that totally screws you up and that's why people are so
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.080]  zombie-like so we're gonna get into that but he wanted to come on a few weeks
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.680]  ago I wanted to get him in here because we did a whole special on the war on men
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:10.100]  a few months ago and our hormones were the estrogen
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:14.040]  hemikers and people said why not cover women you know why don't you cover
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:19.960]  women well we're mainly a male audience probably 70% male but I'm male so I
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:24.200]  cover male issues it's not that I'm ignoring women we came out with
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:29.960]  super male vitality because that was what was in development already and quite
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.600]  frankly it works great with women but no group said no no we can do something
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:37.160]  even better for women I've tested this with five women I know four of them are
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.480]  bouncing off the walls with energy libido you name it one of them says it's
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.480]  made her tired we're just gonna be honest about the response you've only been on
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.040]  it three days though we're gonna investigate what's happening with that
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:55.000]  so do you know just the results very but I'm talking bouncing off the walls for
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.520]  some women well four out of five
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:04.200]  dr. Edward group is here to make two big announcements we have super female
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.280]  vitality now available in the shopping cart today you only get a great product
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.680]  those block all the garbage they put in the food and water you support the tip
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.360]  of the spear in the info war we have live reportage from going into the
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.680]  Bilderberg hotel next hour with David Knight and others and we're announcing
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:23.400]  the iodine coming up as well at 40 after but but dr. group I've done a long
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:27.160]  intro there we'll have you till 15 after next hour when David Knight joins us
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:32.280]  but you've heard me break down this win-win-win-win situation
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.480]  you've got a lot of points their estrogen dominance decreases b-zinc
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:41.880]  mg dh ea serotonin bill gates history of estrogen dominance eugenics estrogen
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.520]  mimickers what it does in women not just men
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:50.760]  social engineering pesticides bpa soy gmos plastics birth control
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:53.800]  ember bernays alcohol it all starts in the gut
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:58.600]  you've got the floor break down drumroll please
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.360]  there is a solution to this it's diet it's exercise it's purified water
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:06.440]  and then it's the nitrous oxide of race car driving
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.760]  it is a super feminine vitality well it all started years ago
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:16.760]  when the globalists wanted to figure out ways to sterilize the population and
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.680]  to control the birth rates and at that time
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:27.160]  margaret sanger who actually worked with bill gates dad
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:30.360]  was the one that wanted to create a birth control pill and then she worked
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:33.320]  with a scientist called pink it's right his dad was top army intelligence
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.040]  under the Rockefellers and with margaret sanger and it's still alive
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.400]  running off today oh it's plenty actually runs the foundation
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:42.920]  he runs the bill on the gates foundation right and then that all you know that
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:46.760]  that translates into many other things and it ties them on santo and everything
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.680]  else for the whole sterility thing but
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:52.760]  she's the one that really pushed the birth control pills and so that was a way
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:58.200]  because they knew that by the way estrogen blocks the absorption of iodine
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.200]  they know that there's a link between estrogen and iodine so well now
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.680]  because of the birth control pills and the propaganda and the feminization of
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:10.600]  females that was done by Edward Bernays the king of propaganda
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:14.600]  who not only convinced everybody that fluoride was safe
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:19.400]  he's he was the one that was also hired to uh create the feminization because
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.680]  they knew that and to get women to smoke cigarettes and cigarettes was the big
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.960]  campaign too that he convinced the whole public and then he was ultimately
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:31.320]  you know hired on as the mastermind of manipulation of the population but
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:34.520]  they knew that they could they were only getting 50 percent of the tax money
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:39.080]  also by males working so his job was to get females out of the house
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.280]  and get them into the workplace so the government could collect 100 percent of
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.080]  the taxes from everybody and have the state raise the kids and one of the
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.560]  re yeah and the state raised the kid by the way he wrote three books bragging
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:51.080]  about this right anybody out there can read by him saying this
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.680]  yes and but one of the key points i wanted to mention
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:57.800]  how that all ties together in the estrogen conspiracy and the war on
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:02.600]  women is the fact that part of the way to get women out of the household was to
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:06.920]  create canned food and box foods and processed foods and the microwave which
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:10.280]  came into existence too so if women didn't have to cook
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:13.800]  anymore they could go to work and that was the washing they didn't just give us
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.920]  washing machines and all this they wanted to change the culture
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.680]  they wanted to end humans being primitive being self-sufficient
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.200]  yeah that's right and and also the technocracy and i'm not bashing the
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:28.120]  conveniences it's just that they gave us these tools of the gods the fire
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:33.240]  prometheus to end us and therefore we have the creation
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.240]  of the estrogen compounds and the estrogen mimickers starting with bpa
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:41.800]  and all the the bpa that's in the spray in the cans because canned foods everybody
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.480]  wanted to have the easy dinner at night and the microwave
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:49.560]  foods where the male used to bring the worms to the nest
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:53.640]  the female ran the nest not because she was weak she was more important
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:58.920]  now we don't bring worms the the h e b does the safeway does and it's a
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:03.400]  bisphenol a worms to our babies that's right i mean it's so what you
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.920]  have is you have estrogen dominance in males and you have estrogen dominance
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.560]  in females and it's it's coming from every single
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:14.200]  direction and that's why females are suffering from extra weight gain low
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.160]  thyroid because they can't absorb iodine rest this
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.840]  breasts any type of glandular problem
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:25.320]  any type of cysts and any gland directly related to an iodine deficient
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:28.200]  we're going to skip this network break it's too important keep going women and
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:32.440]  men for that for that matter have their hormones completely whacked out especially
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.720]  when you add soy and personal care products in which most people don't
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:39.400]  talk about with women they slather all these parabens and all these by the way
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.200]  last week they came out in ap guys reprint it
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.880]  and admitted what you've been saying forever that guess what those plastics
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.640]  and the stuff in the hair care products guess what it destroys your fertility
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:55.080]  oopsie yeah oopsie estrogen just modifies the growth
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:58.920]  of cells when you put when you have cancer cells in a petri dish and you put
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:02.520]  a drop at like a trillionth of what you would get
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.360]  in a couple cans or are heating something in the microwave
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.040]  you see those cancer cells immediately just start to replicate like
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:14.440]  at a very fast so it's a cancer adjuvant it's a cancer adjuvant and that's why
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:17.400]  we have so much breast cancer and everything else but iodine is there to
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:22.040]  protect people and women from that but so it's racist
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:26.680]  women need to be a iodine is racist well if you look at it from the globalist
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.880]  point on me anything free or good is called racist so it's bad
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:33.160]  right because they know that if they mess up the hormones in everybody
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:38.280]  it can cause just a world of other problems within the system so
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:42.200]  what you have to look at is is women avoiding or going with all natural
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:46.120]  personal care products and then another big problem that no one's talking
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:49.560]  about is the atrazine and the pesticides that are being sprayed everywhere
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.720]  because the roundup atrazine is in the water supply
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:58.200]  every single it tested in every water supply pretty much in the country
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:03.880]  and that is those are also estrogen mimicers and it's hard to avoid because
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:08.280]  what they what what else they have inside those pesticides which they don't
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:11.560]  even have to list on the label they have other chemicals in there as well that
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.960]  help them bind and stick to the foods and it goes down into the soil
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:20.040]  so the plant actually sucks it up inside so bio accumulates
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:25.240]  yeah bio accumulates so what it can really affect the fetus and the womb
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.560]  because if the mother is taking in all these estrogen
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:32.520]  mimicers it can create the brain of a female but
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:37.000]  the genitalia of a male or it can have the genitalia of a male
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  and the brain of a female because they admitted that in the 60s so Dr Michael
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.760]  Kaufman said that in game 2.0 he was reading the documents on air
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:48.200]  how the sexual revolution was so we wouldn't stay together and take care of
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:50.600]  kids at the stake and raise them but next phase
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.440]  was to chemicalize to where males and females were indistinguishable
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:58.200]  they would make the age of puberty earlier just like in Brave New World
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:03.080]  which Huxley admitted was a fictional account of what they really plan to do
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:07.080]  and he said that in Brave New World Revisited. Right I mean just the
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:11.400]  atrazine levels in lakes and ponds and the pesticide levels in there
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:15.240]  actually having and they've done studies on frogs they actually have frogs that
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:20.840]  are have male genitalia but turn over for other males because their brain
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:24.360]  and when I cover this Huffington Post says that we're anti-gay
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.200]  you know the frogs are dying the the animals are dying they're doing this
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:33.640]  on purpose we we should just accept this and and and go for it
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:37.080]  that's the gender-bending chemicals and it's another reason why they planted so
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.400]  much soy they knew that soy was going to be
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:44.440]  extremely toxic it takes a lot well you factor in Henry Ford the Nazi the
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:47.320]  genesis was obsessed with that right and then Monsanto
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:51.800]  genetically modifying all the soy well not only is it genetically modified but
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.720]  it's also round up resistant and then round up in itself as an
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:59.800]  endocrine disrupting chemical or an estrogen mimicker so
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:04.680]  that causes a problem with the hormones and it's soaked up inside the source so
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.400]  not only are you getting the phytoestrogens in soy
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:11.160]  but you're also getting the endocrine disrupting chemicals and the estrogen
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.440]  disrupting and then the printer ink has it in it
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:18.200]  everything and I was reading talking to chemist your dad was a top chemist
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.800]  they don't even need to go with this recipe but they got all the big printer
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.600]  companies to go with it and and it's on the money too
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.360]  they're just sterilizing us at every level right they're disrupting our
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:32.360]  hormones so we can't think properly we can't function properly it creates
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:37.240]  separation in the in the homes the male doesn't feel confident
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:40.600]  anymore because he's estrogen him the male starts getting a belly
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:44.440]  around around himself he starts growing man boobs
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.800]  his butt starts to get a little bit bigger because one of the things with
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:52.280]  estrogen dominance in women is it lowers their libido
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.880]  number two it it increases the fat around their butt
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:00.200]  and it increases the fat around their breast tissue too but also around the
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:03.080]  stomach so you know and it lowers their thyroid and
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:06.200]  the list goes on and on and on and on I mean they have problems with cysts they
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.640]  have premenstrual syndrome their menstrual cycles are irregular
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:13.160]  they're not able to get rid of their toxins on a regular basis
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:17.560]  so all that CNN would just say you're against women for warning them
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:21.560]  well I mean that's I mean if you were just they need to just die for the
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:24.360]  earth isn't it better they shouldn't take iodine
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.320]  they shouldn't learn about this they shouldn't take it when they're pregnant
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.320]  even though there's a bunch of admitted disorders from iodine deficiency
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.160]  in the fetus correct right and that's why there's also such a big
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.520]  push for flu shots on pregnant women right now from all the
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:42.440]  the OB gins which I personally by the way until five years ago all medical
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:45.880]  people were told nurses you name it never give a pregnant woman a vaccine
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:49.560]  they knew it caused deformities they knew it caused disorders autoimmune and
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:55.000]  spontaneous miscarriages now they say pregnant women need extra
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.920]  they do which is just causing more problems with the kids because whenever
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.920]  you put any type of chemical like that into the body it does cross the placenta
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:07.000]  now some of these things and it does affect the kid I mean and not only you
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.080]  could think that you're not exposing yourself to estrogen but there's
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:18.280]  so many women on birth control pills that 85% of the estrogen gets peed out by
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.720]  the way by the woman and that goes into our water system so if you're
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:25.000]  drinking tap water and now in Austin they're going to give us toilet to tap
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.800]  that doesn't even want to move it so now if you drink
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.760]  Austin water or other cities that have it it is a death sentence
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:35.320]  all of the prozac all the Ritalin everything just annihilating you
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:38.280]  right and it's like homeopathic she don't need it in
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.800]  large doses to make a difference in the body I mean all the homeopathic is
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:46.520]  just water with an energy signature in it so basically but fluoride but fluoride
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:49.720]  you know is the medical doctors on like
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:55.160]  blalock is the total turbo adjuvant to turbo once you have fluoride the other
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:58.520]  drugs are in there it turbo charges them yeah that's why they put fluoride
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:02.360]  makes them electrical fluoride in anti-malarials anti-inflammatories
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.360]  anti-arthritis a bunch of the antibiotics it's in anti-depressants
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:10.200]  and it's not just fluoride hydrofluorosalic acid has been
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:14.520]  electrolyzed and aluminum they add aluminum in there to take it up into
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:18.680]  the brain tissue and to to calcify the pineal gland and to calcify you know
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:22.280]  because the pineal gland and then they write books how they're doing it like
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.240]  ecoscience but still we're conspiracy theorists
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:29.720]  right right right i mean it's all the thing is everything's in plain day i
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:32.680]  mean they know how important the pineal gland is that's why the pope has a
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:36.440]  pine cone looking shape on his cone over there and there's pine cones if you look
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.720]  at everywhere around the vatican they tell you straight up
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:43.240]  this is representation of the pineal gland if you look at the eye a horse in
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:47.400]  the egyptian sculptures i mean they knew how important the pineal gland was
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.840]  soon i know we're getting off subject those feet of the soul and is the seat
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.280]  of the soul and it's everywhere so they you cut it out those higher level
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:58.360]  brain waves just don't happen well the pineal gland is made if you cut it open
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:02.200]  it's made of rods and cones exactly like what's in your eye
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.960]  that's why they call it the third eye so why is why are you going to have
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:10.120]  something in the middle of your brain that's made of the exact same thing
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:14.040]  your eye is made of rods and cones the only reason you have rods and cones
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:18.280]  is to see things visual rods and cones pick up color and pick up light
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:23.720]  that's right so if you can see things obviously in the egyptians knew about it
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:27.240]  of course it's picking up all what they now know
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:30.680]  all different particles that are coming throughout a space and the particles
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.880]  coming out of the earth magnetic fields the same way they've proven fish and
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.080]  birds can navigate it's now been proven by scientific american
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:40.680]  and just the last year they've gone no it's true humans have
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:45.480]  the cells in the pineal the same ones fish and and and and other animals have
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:49.160]  to feel magnetic lines and some people have it stronger than others
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:53.880]  that's why they know that the endocrine disrupting chemicals the estrogen
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:58.520]  mimickers the phthalates the pesticides all of the stuff that they're spraying
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.240]  and putting in the air and the food and the water
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.760]  disrupts the glandular system of the body
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:08.360]  you know the glandular system they're attacking our most important eyeball
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:13.800]  the pineal gland the adrenal glands you know all of the glands in the system
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:17.080]  they know that the glands are what runs the body you destroy the glands you
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:21.240]  destroy the consciousness you dumb people down you make them non-aggressive
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.400]  you make them non-motivated you alter their hormone levels and then they
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:30.680]  become nothing more than an easily manipulated
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.120]  easily control every time we get here lies
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:37.560]  population start telling us what super female vitality does how it's different
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.360]  than super male well you know super female

[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:34.120]  if she's taking in if she's lathering herself with all this lotion which is
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:38.360]  decreasing her estrogen or or mimicking if estrogen she needs something to help
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:42.280]  balance that out so that's why super female vitality

[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:07.800]  but super female vitality quite frankly you know groups like well this works
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:10.920]  for most women and you've heard women's testimonials here on the air but
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:15.160]  he said i could tweak some stuff to make it even better for women and we've had
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:20.520]  it a few months here the beta batches of it and then we have to pull the trigger
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:24.040]  after decide to get it okay let's go with it then we get the raw herbs in
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:27.880]  leading competitors have similar things for about twice the price
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:32.520]  and it's dry herbs and it's not as concentrated that's why
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:38.280]  you get such a bigger response and this stuff doesn't mimic your hormones it
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:42.120]  gets your body to produce them and i want i want dr. group to describe how this
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:46.200]  works some of the things that are in the super female vitality and then folks
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:50.600]  can know also you know get a bottle try it if it doesn't work great for you you're
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.800]  going to be in the great minority and it doesn't matter you've supported the
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:59.320]  broadcast but it's the real deal and why so many people i know are cynical about
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:07.480]  female or male you know vitality exercise libido formulas clarity formulas because
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:11.640]  they've gotten a small response or maybe side effects i've never seen such positive
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:16.120]  responses with what you've come out with here why is it so different what is
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:19.960]  in the super female vitality that folks can get at info wars life.com
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:26.680]  most of the stuff that's out there is bought from cheap chinese herbs or they get it from india
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:32.920]  and most of it's just designed to try to sell you a lot of product for a high price i mean if you
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:37.800]  look in the muscle building magazines and you look at most of the vitamin stores that are out there
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:44.680]  it's not really focused on adjusting the root cause of the problem you know they might use
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:53.960]  a high level of standard standardized herbs most likely those were powdered the source of the
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:59.560]  herbs they might contain metals or contaminants and maybe they're not mixed i mean when i look at
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:05.640]  the majority of healthcare products out there on the market and call the companies and say who
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:12.760]  formulated this these herbs don't even work together i mean i could take guaranteed 90 probably
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:18.280]  99 percent of the supplements out there on the market and find a problem with each one of them
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:23.320]  either they have magnesium steroid in it they have some toxic compound in it or they're using a
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:29.560]  two herbs that block each other the action so these formulators really don't know what they're
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:35.080]  doing you know our r and d process is we look at all different things especially when you're
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:40.120]  dealing with a hormone product and you have to look at what what the effect is going to be on
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:45.560]  dha what the effect is going to be on estrogen what the effects going to be on progesterone
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:52.360]  what the effects going to be on testosterone melatonin serotonin i mean there's so many
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:58.360]  hormones that you have to cross reference one might decrease testosterone one might increase
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:02.680]  testosterone and then you have companies out there that are putting both of those both of
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:07.480]  those herbs in one formula so they're canceling each other out there's a lot of research that
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:13.160]  goes behind it and actually the majority of companies formulators don't even have any type
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:17.080]  of scientific degree well i mean i i've talked a lot of the companies looking into this over the
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:21.560]  last few years and they just say look we just throw as many things as we can because people like to
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.440]  see a bunch of stuff on the label yeah but but but but it's like bad drug interactions i guess
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:31.080]  it would be a similar analogy where the doctors just throw people on all these prescriptions
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:34.760]  i've literally talked to formulators because i call them up on the phone and i'm like so tell me
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:39.720]  why'd you put that in there why'd you and then they say one guy said well to be honest with you
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:46.840]  when i formulated the product i just typed in a male hormone product in google and i just copied
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:52.120]  took like the the top two herbs that were in 20 different formulas or 10 different formulas that
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:56.120]  were popular out there and they just take the top two and put it in their formula and then they
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:00.120]  say that that's the thing i played football and stuff so i didn't do any like illegal drugs or
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:04.600]  anything but i would take yo hembi bark and i would be able to work out harder but feel crazy
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:09.480]  swell up and have headaches i was on a week got off of it so many other supplements make me feel bad
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:15.880]  that's why i don't do them these make me feel incredibly good well it has to do with the processing
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:21.160]  too and it has to do with choosing the herb i mean you might be able to get one specific herb
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:27.400]  from 20 different places that you know this place over here it might be you know six months old and
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:31.560]  it might be cut and sifted this place over here might be powdered and they're importing it from
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:36.920]  china sat in a 200 degree warehouse in china for 10 years this place over here might have you know
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:44.200]  sourcing it from india so the problem is when people look at formulating a product other companies
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:51.240]  they look for the least expensive herb available so if they're looking for makarut let's say which
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:58.200]  is which is a good hormone regulator they look they're their purchaser that's going to purchase it
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:03.480]  because it gets handed off to a purchaser i personally handle that myself because i know
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:07.960]  how important it is but no other company does because they don't have time to do that they
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.760]  hand it off to a purchaser they find all the different companies they find the cheapest one
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:19.640]  you know if they're going to buy a ton a thousand kilos they're going to say uh i don't care if the
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:26.200]  best one the organic one over here is a hundred dollars a kilo we got to make some money i'm going
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:30.360]  to buy this one from china it's been sitting up and it's on sale because they're trying to get rid
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:34.840]  of it and by the way look at into this i mean i've that's i've talked to big formulators and they
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:40.280]  go oh our whole bottle cost us two dollars and they laugh at us that we actually get the you
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:46.360]  know the organic wet herbs and and get it all certified and it costs you know a 16 dollars
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:50.440]  a bottle or something i mean they just think that's ridiculous people they'd rather sell it for more
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:57.800]  than we do with the cost of a fraction of the price i want to get good karma i mean i don't mean
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:01.720]  that i'm not a buddhist i don't actually believe me you know you report you so i want to have the
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:06.040]  best product i want to feel good about what i'm selling i want people to reorder it because it's
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:12.680]  so good on top of it you get more success out of giving them a good product well you know the oath
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:17.160]  that medical doctors take is do first do no harm democratic oh they don't even give that anymore
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:22.280]  you know what i mean so that's the way i look at it first do no harm i mean i know because i've
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:27.480]  studied all the other companies and what they do and a lot of those products are harmful to the body
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:33.000]  so uh that's the first step and then the second step is make sure that it's processed correctly
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:38.680]  there's people that process these they're herbs in aluminum uh batches or they hot process you
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:43.720]  hold hot process you call press and that denatures or they use alcohol which you're only able to
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:48.840]  extract you know 40 of the herbs constituents from it and by the way alcohol is an endocrine
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:55.720]  disruptor too so why am i going to put an herb uh you know make an herbal formula that's help
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:00.840]  that's supposed to help support normal hormone that's why you go with glycerin base and put an
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:07.800]  endocrine disruptor and your glycerin is from german certified organic corn my vegetable glycerin
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:14.120]  uh comes from different sources but the one i use and the one i like to use is from palm actually
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:17.800]  yeah it's from i just know one of the purchase orders i saw was a german german corn because
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:22.040]  people can argue well there's no such thing as organic corn no germany's got it certified
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:27.000]  well you know if it's organic it's it's fine i mean we're trying there's a shortage right now
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.480]  vegetable glycerin but a lot of people are trying to to uh do the same thing i was about to say we
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:36.040]  we've caused doing this and it's funny because then everybody's doing what we're doing then they get
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:40.920]  mad at us like we create the market and they're like mad you need to now go die somewhere because
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:49.560]  you made iodine so popular well think about this i mean i i personally believe that you know because
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:55.320]  there's 200 uh plant species or just any living species going extinct practically every day right
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:43:02.040]  now one of the reasons why there's so many pesticides and insecticides sprayed and uh the
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:10.040]  genetically modified uh and with the chemtrails is that the perennial herbs are are highly sensitive
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:15.560]  to soil conditions especially acidic soil so when you spray aluminum nanoparticles all over the
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:21.960]  ground we're losing a lot of the medicinal herbs oh yeah only the gmo that they've stacked in the
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:27.960]  monsanto products aluminum resistance so only their stuff can grow so why do you think that they
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:35.720]  have a seed vault with thousands of medicinal herbs when medicinal herbs are the direct competition
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:40.920]  to population control eugenics and direct competition to the pharmaceutical i was about to say they have
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:49.640]  14 Rockefeller inspired un seed vaults 14th right and they have zoological vaults so what happens
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:54.680]  if they kill off all the medicinal herbs only they then have it yeah to bring it back there's
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:58.840]  and there's no more supplements for people to take that that can that they can use instead of
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:02.920]  they they're forced into taking pharmaceuticals it's simply incredible and it helps fund our
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:07.800]  operation as well super feminine vitality uh tell folks about some of the things that are in it
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:13.720]  it's available at info wars live.com or by calling 888-253-3139 and again this is how we
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:18.440]  help fund the operation as well we do these little promos once a month or so with dr group
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:21.880]  but mainly get into the news here with him uh tell folks how this is different than the
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:26.600]  super male vitality formula well it's it's just this is a lot of the same herbs are in there the
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:32.120]  only difference is we added one herb in there that really works good for female libido which is uh
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:39.240]  epididium and it's uh another name for this horny goatweed and what makes this what makes it so
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:47.480]  special is women especially women in their 40s you know when they're estrogen dominant uh they lose
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:51.800]  a lot of self confidence because they start gaining that extra weight they don't feel sexy anymore
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:58.280]  and it's very important for a woman a woman obviously to feel like she's sexy and that she
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:02.840]  can look in the mirror and she's self confident and she likes herself you know that actually
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:08.520]  that's what sexy is a woman that thinks she's sexy well that is what helps produce the pheromones
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:14.200]  and the pheromones are the attractive hormones for men and women so you know if a women woman is not
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:19.080]  feeling good about herself she doesn't look she thinks she's uh you know unhealthy she's fat you
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:26.040]  know blah blah blah then you know and and the the fact that she's has low energy levels you know she
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:31.400]  she's deficient in iodine i mean all those things go hand in hand what this is designed to do is
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:37.080]  bring them back to where they were when they were 18 of course i highly recommend that you all the
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:44.360]  women look online for endocrine disrupting chemicals estrogen mimicking chemicals and start avoiding
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:48.760]  all those because if you really want to bring yourself back exactly even more important than
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:54.280]  taking this is purify the water get away from the stuff that has it in there by design right i mean
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:57.480]  that's the real public service announcement and then support the info we're getting this product
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:01.960]  and and and you know seeing what it does for you check with your healthcare provider now let's
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:05.560]  shift gears to the really big announcement here today then we're going to build a bird coverage
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:08.440]  in the next hour but i want to get back into your big list of how they're targeting women
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:15.720]  let's talk about survival shield x2 ladies and gentlemen and look you'll notice i have an x2
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:22.040]  that's already been tapped into here i've i've been taking it for over a month and i've also
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:29.080]  been working on some of the other new stuff we've got as well this this look listen we're
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:34.120]  going to keep selling survival shield it's excellent the regular uh and it's great for
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:38.920]  kids and things that is not as strong as this and i got to be honest folks we can't even keep enough
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:44.360]  of this in uh and like you said there's shortages in the palm oil and things so i went out and looked
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:50.360]  at other iodines and they did things like you know burn my gut burn i learned other people were getting
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:54.840]  ulcers from it it has the alcohol items to something weird iodine there's some formulas
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:58.920]  out there i think are okay i'm not knocking it you need it regardless it's just that in this
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:03.880]  glycerin base and the type of iodine it is where it comes from there's nothing like it
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:10.840]  but he came out with x2 that's even stronger is bright red i've never seen iodine it's either black
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:19.960]  brown turns black and brown or it's blue uh blue yellow this is bright red like blood
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:27.080]  and turns bright blue on paper like the actual crystal that if you had a crystal of it is where
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:32.360]  this comes from it would like alien blood eat through three or four floors okay unless it was
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:38.760]  in ceramics this this is explosive stuff and just to let you know a lot of hoops had to be gone through
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:44.600]  to get this type of iodine it's super controlled the group's been in business forever and is able
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:49.880]  to get it okay there's like wars going on you know for our companies to even get this iodine
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:53.080]  of this quality not the group we're not playing games i don't want to go into all the inside
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:58.680]  baseball but iodine is heavily controlled tell people why and tell them what x2 is because this
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:05.880]  is special when when i was looking at developing a higher potency iodine uh one of the questions
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:11.640]  that we were getting from a lot of people was why is all the iodine source from seaweed especially
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:17.080]  with fukushima being you know with all the radiation going on you know how do we know that
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:23.560]  iodine is safe so that led me on a journey to try to find is there any other sources of pure
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:29.240]  raw material of iodine iodine like you said is very heavily regulated by the dea because
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:35.960]  it's used to make methamphetamine so um what i ended up tracking down and i actually had to fly
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:42.280]  out to different places but there was a and this is uh not too many people know this there's actually
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:49.320]  a deposit which is seven thousand to ten thousand feet deep inside the earth for millions of years
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:55.960]  ago it's a salt deposit which is very very high in iodine there's a company that actually drilled
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:02.360]  all the way down and and has i actually flew out and met with the company and i have the rights to
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:05.960]  get oh i want to send crew out there with you but i don't want to say where it's at obviously but
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:10.280]  it's so amazing you've actually got the purple crystals i've got no one's got this highest
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:20.360]  purity iodine crystals in the world a usp grade only has to be 99.6 99.7 i have 99.99 this iodine
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:27.000]  is five to ten times more expensive too per kilogram but we're not even we didn't even raise
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.960]  our price by five times i mean you know i same price it's it's the same price i mean so we're
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:38.600]  really this is this is a uh this is a project for humanity listen it's unbelievable it's it's
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:43.400]  unbelievable what this does it's unbelievable you can use it for skin you can use it for so many
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:49.080]  different things and i don't want to make a bunch of claims but the process that we had to go through
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:56.120]  to to secure this and to get this is amazing i mean throughout 20 years of doing research i've never
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:01.320]  been the type of doctor that said you need to be on 30 different nutraceuticals you need to be
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:07.080]  taking all these vitamins and all this stuff every day because we figured out how easy it is to bring
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:11.400]  the body back to health and to reactivate the body and the globalists know they target iodine
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:16.280]  yeah exactly they but then even though people get is the cruddy forms this is it that's why
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:20.760]  they're too that's why they're trying to suppress iodine they're trying to take it off the market
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:24.840]  probably from what i hear i mean well i got into iodine because years ago i was we're taking the
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:29.640]  modifier on seaweed that we sell and it really helped me so then i started taking other items
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:33.560]  they would make me kind of feel bad but overall better it would hurt my stomach then i found your
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:38.520]  iodine and then i mean it's just it's a totally different iodine it's a huge process that this
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:43.720]  goes through it takes hours upon it takes days and weeks to do this by the time you get the pure
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:50.440]  iodine in you get it in processing you stabilize it into the glycerin the you bottle it i mean
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:56.040]  it's a stay there i want to hear about the process it's proprietary it's x2 it's funding the info or
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:51:03.960]  it's incredible tired of taking handfuls of vitamin pills look and feel super with a great

[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:33.880]  that's exactly what you have to do you have to figure out what she has what what her diet's like
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:38.520]  what she's exposing herself to you know there's obviously some it might actually take longer
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:43.480]  than three days i mean i've had it with our results up to ten days well you warned within
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:48.120]  two weeks to four weeks i would get sick on survival shield when i detox that indeed happened
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:51.960]  for about a week and then it was like going through a wall i felt great after it right when all those
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:56.280]  when all the chlorine and the fluoride and the bromine and all that other stuff is coming out
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:02.600]  of your system so i mean it could be anything i mean i i would definitely not make any type of
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:07.400]  generalization until they've been on it for seven to ten days i mean consult your healthcare

[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:20.360]  bouncing off the walls from if what i heard tell us and i appreciate you giving us a review
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:25.880]  what happened uh now that you've been on the super feminine vitality well my husband started
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:30.920]  taking it and i was super impressed with the effects that it had on him so he's talking about the male
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:36.520]  vitality the male vitality yeah the male vitality so i took actually took the male vitality a couple
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:41.880]  times and i had energy and everything but when he brought me home the bottle was super female

[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:46.040]  get back briefly into x2 because where it comes from why it's so special i mean i really get excited
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:50.280]  about this it doesn't just fund our operation which gets the word out on all the fronts they
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:55.240]  really know iodine's key that to produce all our hormones they've been blocking it and as the word
[02:00:55.240 --> 02:01:00.360]  about this gets out i mean this is serious blow against the globalist especially with fukushima
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:05.800]  and everything like that too it's when i looked at all the minerals like i said i believe that
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:09.800]  everybody has a self-healing mechanism and all you have to do is clean your body and that's really
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:17.000]  the secret to having perfect health it's just your body being clean but when i started unfolding
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  this whole iodine conspiracy and the fact that every single cell in your body needs iodine and you
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:33.720]  need 22 let's say 50 milligrams which is 20 000 micrograms of 50 000 micrograms of iodine a day and
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:38.840]  that everything depends on it all your glandular system everything and then you start looking at
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:45.080]  the whole estrogen and all the other chemicals that are destroying the body at the same time and
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:50.920]  how it all works together um that's really one of the first things that i came out with is saying
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:56.360]  hey listen this is so important that everybody needs it it's not like hey go take calcium you
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:00.520]  know half the people need it half the people don't need it or go take b vitamins or any type of
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:06.840]  those other minerals iodine is something that every single person needs and if you're deficient
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:12.680]  in it look at the the children you were talking about pregnancy and women women that are deficient
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:19.000]  in iodine during pregnancy what causes what are the symptoms what happens to that baby
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:25.560]  mental retardation i mean they're attacking the brain and every spinal bifida and mental retardation
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:32.600]  lower iQ i was really causes spinal development problems well of course because iodine is needed
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:38.280]  in all of the reproductive system they don't tell women you need that you need flu shots well yeah
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:43.160]  i mean of course they're not going to tell you that you need iodine but out of every single thing
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:49.000]  out there i mean look at if you look at iodine you can just automatically tell that there's a
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:56.120]  conspiracy going on because of the fact that look at the other halogens fluoride chlorine and bromide
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:00.840]  or bromine they're assaulting us with stuff that's poisonous so they are while removing the good
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:06.120]  they assault us with chlorine they assault us with fluorine or fluoride or compounds and they assault
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:13.480]  us with bromine or bromide everywhere you turn so those will still block the the absorption of iodine
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:18.360]  in the body and estrogen dominance blocks the absorption of iodine in the body and getting
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:24.440]  back to the super female vitality oh my gosh i've got guys calling me up they're like this
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:30.680]  stuff is amazing my wife is calm i don't have a getting fights with her anymore um her libido
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:36.120]  is through the roof you know think about how many marriages you know you might save i mean i had one
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:40.920]  guys talking about hey my wife was reading that 50 shades uh book and all that stuff and my marriage
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:46.440]  is better now than has been in the last 15 15 years you know with me taking the super male and her
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:54.520]  taking the the uh super female vitality um the fact is when you can you know the global is trying
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:04:00.360]  to break everybody apart so the solution is avoid all the things that they're doing and
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:04.920]  get your body back into shape and start balancing out everything they say get fluoride don't get
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:11.560]  iodine we want iodine whatever they say they say turn your guns in we get guys exactly i know it's
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:18.040]  real simple so by by taking a supplement you know ultimately in eliminating all these sources
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:23.560]  and doing your own research and educating yourself you know hey that's going to be that's going to
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:30.280]  create but i mean listen you're you the products you develop for info warslife.com are revolutionary
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:35.880]  i mean they just blow anything i've taken away and i still look like hell but i i look a lot

[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:10.360]  300 000 people in west virginia had their drinking water contaminated what are the health effects of
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:15.480]  having these drugs in our drinking water it's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents

[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:33.400]  article from a couple days ago pregnant women should take iodine supplements but not all iodine
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:39.720]  supplements are equal we have had the best of the survival shield we're going to keep selling it
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:46.040]  it's excellent comes from the same great source but now we have an even stronger in a new process
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:50.600]  that if you like the old survival shield still available info wars live dot com we're going to
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:55.720]  love the new survival shield x2 and it can all work together with the fluoride shield that has
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:59.800]  the nascent iodine and five other chelating properties not just for fluoride detox but
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:05.000]  other toxins and then you're funding the very tip of the spear in the info war be sure and support
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.400]  our local amen FM affiliates and their sponsors as well about their groups only got five minutes
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:14.840]  left with us then we're going to go to Copenhagen Denmark with our reporters about to try to go
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:20.280]  into the Bilderberg hotel where the globalist are meeting but going back to dr. Edward group
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:29.080]  finishing up with how you produce the new x2 and why it's so much more powerful than the last one
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:35.480]  well it is you know like you said it is all about supporting the patriot movement and you know
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:42.040]  these are the people that are aware of the need for iodine and so the x2 the reason why it's
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:46.760]  different from the standard survival shield is almost double the strength it's actually 650
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:53.960]  micrograms per drop so it gives you a lot more bang for your buck and it's actually you know fairly
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:10:00.680]  right at the same price when we get the crystals from deep in the earth it goes through a process
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:07.080]  that takes about probably a week to two weeks and that purification process purifies the crystals
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:14.840]  to 99.99 percent pure that is unheard of then we get the crystals in our facility and they go
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:23.080]  through a process of stabilizing the crystals and actually infusing them into a vegetable
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:28.760]  glycerin matrix in a nascent form which means they're active or they're monatomic they're an
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:32.600]  atomic iodine form and it actually becomes stabilized in that form that's whatever it's
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:37.880]  so bioavailable it goes right in the blood because all I know is with the alcohol base these other
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:42.040]  systems we've called the companies they go oh we just dump regular old iodine in the industry just
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:48.360]  start with a spoon yeah well you know what iodine is very caustic too so you have to have all glass
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:54.520]  equipment or it has to be silicone platinum tubing I mean the equipment involved alone
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:59.160]  to keep it all non-toxic a lot of companies out there aren't going to put that much money into
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:02.280]  their equipment and their supplies and they're going to run it through stainless steel or they're
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:07.720]  going to run it through metal or aluminum or anything like that that might contaminate the
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:12.280]  product in the end and make it see in a nascent form you got to make sure that it doesn't come
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:17.880]  in contact with a lot of things because you'll lose that charge so the whole purpose of doing it all
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:23.720]  in glass is that you're not it's not going to come in contact with metal or it's not going to bond
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:30.840]  to anything how long do you think the new x2 lasts the x2 I don't know because we we just came up
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:35.000]  with it so you know we like you said like a fine wine I've noticed the supermail and stuff
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:40.120]  seems to get better with time but if this has a charge does it get least good with time well
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:46.760]  iodine is there's no way to stop iodine no matter what kind of iodine product you have
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:51.480]  from gassing out I mean that's just the way it is I mean we try to do it the best to where
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:55.560]  you know any other product out there that's in an alcohol base or anything like that probably
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:12:00.360]  after two years you're going to lose half the strength we haven't tested the x2 yet obviously
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:08.040]  because it just came out but it's always best to take iodine you know since you need it really
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:12.520]  every day or every other day you know I would I take it pretty much every single day I give it
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:17.720]  to my kids I give it to I mean I just know the importance of it and you can pull up tons of
[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:21.960]  research and videos online on YouTube and on Google about the importance of iodine
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:28.200]  you know that's why they took it out of the out of the food supply and right now really the only
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:34.840]  pure grade in the highest grade source is the x2 you cannot find anywhere in the world there is no
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:40.280]  other place that's producing or that's going to even take the time and the effort to produce
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:46.200]  a high quality iodine like this is right here it's coming right out of the ancient deposits
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:52.680]  do we know getting at 7,000 to 12,000 feet do the geologists think they know how it got deposited
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:58.600]  was it volcanic was it oceans it was ocean it's a salt ocean deposit from millions and millions
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:06.280]  and millions of years it's an alluvial plume it's an alluvial plume and it's the highest concentration
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:12.280]  and it's actually located in the united states so fairly in the middle of the united states so it's
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:18.840]  really so that ancient sea you know it back then when it was just pure now all the other iodine
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:25.080]  companies out there are getting their sources from actually china and japan well that and we're not
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:30.440]  knocking other competitions just that this is so good and you're really getting something how old
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:38.840]  do they think it is what the deposit yes millions of years like 200 million 300 million years old
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:44.280]  unbelievable something like that and so you here you have but think about all the yeah i'm not knocking
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:49.480]  other iodine products you know look a tricycle will get you to where you want to go but so will
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:54.680]  eventually you know you know this is the difference between something that extreme is extremely good
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:14:00.920]  for you and it's something that might you know still put iodine in your system but it's all about
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:04.520]  the best is the best you know and that's what i'm all about i don't want to give anybody
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:09.960]  something that's not uh that their body's going to have to break down and this product is is a lower
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:15.320]  price than the the other leading competitors and there's just no comparison oh there's no way you
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:20.120]  can get this this is the highest concentration per drop of any iodine out there except for lugals
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:26.440]  but lugals is a potassium iodide there is no nascent iodine formula on the market that goes over
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:32.440]  500 micrograms per drop this is 650 micrograms per drop well i am just so blessed and thank god
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:36.280]  and all our supporters are the fact that that you work exclusively with info wars

[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:27.800]  do uh we do not get billions of dollars like nbc and msnbc have gotten over the years and stimulus
[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:31.960]  money in bailouts uh we just sell high quality products and if you think they're interesting
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:35.880]  and want to buy them get them that funds our operations so we can send reporters to fema
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:39.720]  camps in virginia and to go out and expose the radiation on the west coast that then made the
[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:43.560]  navy and mainstream news cover it and they had to admit it was increasing and we send reporters
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:47.640]  to cope and hang in Denmark to cover the belterberg group meeting so it gets international attention
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:53.080]  and uh we cover real news we go out and cover the bundy ranch standoff and show the fed stand

[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:33.160]  we uh had our flights canceled because of bad weather and then we were delayed over three hours
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:37.080]  going out of washington because of weather that caused us to miss our london flight our luggage
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:41.480]  got messed up so we've only been here just a couple of minutes we as soon as we were able
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:46.840]  to get our our rental car because that got canceled uh from the states they said somehow so
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:50.840]  that took a little bit longer once we got that we just drove straight out here and we've been
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:56.840]  standing on the street corner about uh two blocks away from uh the marriott right now waiting uh to
[02:17:56.840 --> 02:18:02.920]  get on air well we're gonna go to break in about a minute and i want you to just start walking on
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:07.080]  down towards there and i want you to get arrested do whatever you feel is best i want you to get
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:11.000]  arrested like you did for three hours the military base two weeks ago or we could have a go out of
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.920]  the fire can i show you this this is this is the daily mail we were stuck in london for a while see
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:23.560]  that guy with the tears in his eyes that's the guy who was debating nigel forage on joining the
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:29.160]  european union for britain to join and the headline is obliterated in europe facing mutiny in his party
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:33.880]  and poll show clagg will lose his seat in general election the libertarian tea party
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:39.480]  is taking over europe isn't it beautiful that's right and and that's a rejection of what bill
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:45.000]  deberg created here uh almost 60 years ago the first meeting was 60 years ago and on the uh
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:49.960]  second meeting that was when they bragged that they created the european union and the e you
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:54.200]  now the people here in denmark were one of the first countries to join the european union the
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:19:00.520]  first canadian country but they rejected joining uh getting into the euro and so they have their own
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:05.320]  separate currency just like they do in great britain so people are waking up even here in
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:09.640]  denmark where they were all on board with a globalist agenda they woke up they didn't get
[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:15.160]  them on board with the euro either very well said show us that newspaper one more time he's
[02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:22.600]  literally crying on the cover of the daily mail a newspaper that says the face of a leader at bay
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:27.880]  they lost every one of their seats uh going to the european parliament and they did a poll
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:31.960]  and they said they had the election today he would lose his seat in the house of commons
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:36.920]  this is a guy who a couple of years ago they had the conservatives and the labor party of course
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:41.800]  they're like republican democrats in the u.s. they don't let anybody else into the debates they let
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:47.240]  him in the debates we found out later why because he was the biggest cheerleader for the e you
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:52.360]  oh exactly which is dictatorial and unelected and is ron england under it let's be clear who

[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:46.040]  to keep megan the point we're making about their open agenda of authoritarianism and the fact that
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:53.720]  all over france and germany and and the e you wide in england people are rejecting uh one of the
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:59.400]  longest-serving republicans in congress was just defeated in in the primary to a tea part of your
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:05.640]  yesterday here in texas i mean worldwide when we've got this from inside sources bill deberg is
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:10.760]  scared to death of the libertarian movement even the financial times of london said that a month ago
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:16.840]  yeah yeah absolutely alex you know what they do is they use the same kind of smear tactics
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:22.600]  uh over here in europe that they do in uh in america they're calling a Nigel farange racist you
[02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:28.200]  know xenophobic uh anti-immigrant party uh but you know they they really took a shlaking and here's
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:33.320]  a picture of Nigel farange he's uh celebrating uh had a huge victory in the european parliament
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:38.680]  and of course many people we've had Nigel farange on info wars many times you've talked to him
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:45.800]  and everybody knows the videos where he's kind of harangued uh herman bond rumpoy and called him
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:50.600]  somebody with the demeanor of a third rake bank clark but also he criticized them for
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:56.840]  opposing democratically elected people in italy and greece and then putting in bankers technocrats
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:26:01.640]  these are the people this is the even the terminology that bill deberg came up with saying they're
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:05.800]  going to get rid of politicians and we're going to get rid of democrats we're going to put in
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:11.080]  technocrats we're going to put our own people in and we've had uh uh david rockefeller talking
[02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:17.320]  about how he wanted a supranational elite who were going to join with bankers to essentially
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:21.880]  control the governments of the world a one-world government that's their language and we've seen
[02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:28.200]  that happening in europe and people now are rejecting that by large margins especially
[02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:32.840]  in england by the way david night reporting from cuban hanging denmark billerberg 2014
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:41.320]  who just joined us i'm alex jones are you in the omega man or uh the iam legend or last man
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:46.440]  on earth with vince at price there's you've been on street after street i've seen no cars
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:51.800]  no people in the government's sector of cuban hanging denmark what is going on
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:27:00.920]  well this is about uh seven p.m a little after seven p.m here um it's a very very empty city
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:04.040]  right now at this point nobody's here i don't know if everybody's gone home for the day if
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:07.800]  this is the government sector like you said everybody closed at five o'clock but yeah we
[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:12.600]  are sticking out like sore thumbs because we're the only people out here it's almost as deserted
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:19.320]  as the fake city back in ap hill that's right i wonder what do you think's gonna happen as you
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:23.000]  get ready to march up there during the break now don't go up till we get back on air next segment
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:27.480]  but what does your gut tell you is gonna happen when you march up there and did you get any questions
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:32.760]  at customs uh no nothing at customs but while we were staying on the street corner we had a guy
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:38.040]  come up he he paused for a while and then he backed into the space left his car lights on
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:41.880]  his engine running for quite a while about two or three spaces down from where we were at the
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:46.040]  corner up there he's still in the car he did not get out he's rolled his window down and
[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:51.160]  then we had some marked police car uh came up and paused and looked at us for a while so
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:54.920]  even though we were a couple of blocks away i think they've got our number because like he said
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:28:00.760]  this place is a ghost town at this point in time i like i guess uh as we said before probably people
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:05.240]  have gone home uh for the day it's uh it's a downtown where they're apparently at least in
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:10.280]  this area there's not much nightlife i finally see a few people down there i guess on that main
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:16.040]  street you're about to be on so how far away are you from the hotel right now uh it's just
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:21.400]  out the end of the street down here you want to walk down there yeah let's uh let's get you to go
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:26.200]  ahead and start walking that way a little bit and then pause and then we're going to have you walk
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:30.760]  across the street and and and go up and try to talk to them once you get there you know like i
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:35.160]  said when they act all like you're a criminal just say hey i have a reservation here i want to cover
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:39.480]  the builder bird and you know we have a right to know what goes on at these meetings and say and
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:44.040]  point out that in england it's illegal to set policy that with government officials in a secret
[02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:48.760]  meeting ask them if they have laws like that in Copenhagen and then when the local security threatens
[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:53.400]  their rescue say well i'd like to talk to the police and just don't you know don't push past them
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:57.720]  and just you know just illustrate everything for folks and then maybe we'll get more of a tour of
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:02.760]  the waterfront and stuff again if you're a radio listener we have free video feeds at info wars.com

[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:20.440]  here according to the shots that Watson had i believe this is the staging area where they have
[02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:26.920]  that they've set aside directly across from yeah that's the free speech zone yeah that's free speech
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:33.160]  zone exactly and i don't know all i see is a bunch of uh red and blue uh signs that with x's on them
[02:29:33.160 --> 02:29:36.680]  so i don't know what that's saying because it's not in england well they've got the trash cans
[02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:39.960]  ready and everything no that Watson said that's the free speech zone we got a report on that on

[02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:59.320]  special interest but we got news for them we are exposing the bilberberg group 2014 that they said
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:06.600]  didn't exist and it is now mainstream news because of the work of the real media if seeing an msmc
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:12.120]  see we'll know why they're imploding look in the mirror we're exploding they're imploding
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:17.240]  because we think people want to know about 150 world leaders and royalty meeting and secret
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:23.240]  it that folks don't want to know about kim kardashians baby yeah maybe idiots that are

[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:32.280]  want to know about how the world really works we don't want special interest trying to set up a
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:37.880]  nightmare planet for us for their power at our expense we want to control our own destiny day

[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:55.400]  zones about to march over to the side of bilberberg where they've already taken over and arrested
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:34:59.560]  people yesterday and thrown folks out david night go ahead and take over the live feed
[02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:06.200]  and uh just go up and talk to them you've got the you've got the uh control tower here go ahead
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:12.440]  we know alexis you were just saying uh they want to know everything about us but we're not
[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:17.880]  allowed to know anything about them they meet in secret they violate ethics and sunshine laws that
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:22.600]  governments all over the world have and this is another picture here take a look at you talked
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:28.920]  about this free speech zone that they've created here it's like a prison so we get behind bars we
[02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:34.120]  get in our cages and if we're lucky we can look across the street at the luxurious hotel where
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:41.800]  the royalty and the uh the international elite are meeting to plan the future of world government
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:46.440]  that's what's going on here and i mean it's a pretty powerful image when you look at this
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:50.360]  large parking lot they've created here with temporary uh supports down here at the bottom
[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:54.920]  and uh then they've got these uh these cages up here so they're going to put us all as a giant
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:36:00.520]  free speech cage it's what they do everywhere it's what they did out in nevada they created a free
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:05.560]  speech area and uh first met a first amendment area that's one of the first things that the
[02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:12.840]  bureaucracy was inclined to do and they had it was very small compared to this but uh exactly the
[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:16.120]  same sort of thing somebody went by there and they put up a handwritten sign said the first
[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:23.240]  amendment is not an area and that's the but they always that's their instinct they always want to
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:26.600]  shut down free speech and they want to know everything about us but we're not allowed to know
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:31.240]  anything about them now we're trying to find a place to cross over and david notice notice it's a
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:36.440]  continuity of agenda worldwide the same laws the same free speech zones the same uniforms
[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:44.840]  this is global continuity of agenda standardization yes exactly and i haven't seen uh the complete
[02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:50.120]  we because we were in uh planes i haven't been able to get the uh full bill deberg attendees list but
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:55.960]  i believe that palantir is there again this year they had a lot of uh computer people there last
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:37:01.160]  oh yeah they've got all the snoopy's they've got all the snoop people there um that's right i'm sure
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:07.720]  it's going to be on the agenda to uh you know how they're going to handle all these nsa leaks uh
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:12.280]  and i'm sure that they want to talk to keith alexander who's going to be there now of course
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:18.040]  he went there even when he was head of the nsa he was going to bill deberg this this agency that
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:25.400]  before snowden was so secretive that everybody was joking that nsa may no such agency and even
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:31.720]  though they were saying that was going to compromise us security for him to even acknowledge
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:36.440]  the existence of this agency he was going to bill deberg and meeting with them privately so
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:40.680]  you know how did they justify that sort of thing i hear you when you get there they've got barricades
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:45.480]  and fences put up now take a rest for a minute or two so you're not winded once you get up to
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:49.880]  their main entrance and they've got completely blocked off so that we can't get in they put
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:56.920]  barricades up and they're at you can see right now they're putting barricades no no go down to
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:00.680]  the end of the barricade barricade sure go down to the end of the barricade go down to the end
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:05.880]  of the barricade find where the police checkpoint is and talk to them yeah or or or do whatever
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:09.960]  you think's best what do you want to do david yeah we'll get down this way but we got to get
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:15.400]  over let's get back over the median um because we've got to go around this truck anyway i don't get
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:20.680]  run over so as you can see yeah as you can see here with these this truck uh they're setting
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:25.560]  these concrete barricades down right now and completely barricading it off because they'll
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:30.760]  be arriving tomorrow bill deberg group then i guess they want to have you across the street where you
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:35.240]  can't even across four lanes of travel where you can't get a good shot of who's in the cars
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:39.720]  when they come in that's right that's right it'll be four lanes of traffic uh they've got
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:46.200]  concrete barricades on on the uh free speech zone side and then concrete barricades over here
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:51.000]  but of course this is nothing that anybody should be concerned about right guaranteed it's paid for
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:55.320]  by taxpayers just like england all right you can still get in though there you go there's the entrance
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:03.240]  right there the entrance to mordor david you'll find david rockfeller in there yep it's mariot
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:12.200]  there's a guy there in a suit he's walking around i think he's gonna come over to us
[02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:17.240]  now again in a free society it'd be totally normal to want to know what's going on with this
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:22.280]  yeah absolutely i mean this is more important than davos in their own words
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:26.840]  and here we go can you get a shot over there
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:31.320]  yeah take your time stop and get some shots before they throw you out of there
[02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:37.480]  take a look at that that's what it so this yeah this is the this is the bill de berg
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:41.240]  i view this is uh what they're gonna be seeing of us i guess with the people over there
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:45.160]  yeah so it looks like the free speech sounds a good hundred yards away
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:51.880]  yeah oh yeah it's across a four lane highway and then they've got a very large parking lot
[02:39:51.880 --> 02:40:02.280]  with uh uh uh wires around it i think that modern architecture is so ugly yep okay we're
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:07.320]  going to go through the revolving door here all right now now take it easy because of the signal
[02:40:07.320 --> 02:40:11.800]  cuts i want you to come back out of the signal cuts i'm going to tell you then come out i don't
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:17.320]  i don't want okay here we go good job we've got reservations here we have to go through a metal
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:24.440]  detector to get in or only if you have uh how do we get a reservation uh i mean how do we how do we
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:35.640]  check in you have to uh press uh from the hotel yeah oh we're we're live on the air yeah because
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:41.160]  we're on a radio station yeah we're on a radio station we had reservations we were we were delayed
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:47.720]  so we didn't get in last night reservations this is a private you had reservations for monday and for
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:55.080]  tuesday yeah okay all right best you can do all right ask them for their press representative
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:41:02.040]  do you have a press representative here the hotel how do i get in touch with the hotel i mean
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:08.760]  i'm at the hotel hi how you doing have a night we have a reservation here for monday night and
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:13.720]  tuesday night we were delayed with weather so we didn't get in until today okay so i was wondering
[02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:18.920]  how do we how do we check in well you cannot check in because the hotel is closed now so you need to
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:23.880]  call the hotel on the phone and then tell them what you actually what kind of message you have
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:29.640]  okay all right so they did they they can't sold our reservation for i don't know anything about this
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:35.240]  ask them how long bill deberg's gonna be there a private event so i don't have anything to do so
[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:40.360]  you have to call okay so do you know how long bill deberg's gonna be here or you don't know no okay
[02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:47.640]  are you guys are you private or security or you this with that okay all right so i have to say
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:53.640]  that you need to to call mary a hotel by the phone and ask them about your reservation asking his name
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:42:01.800]  could i get your name no okay no okay all right he doesn't want to give me his name okay all right
[02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:08.520]  okay try to look at his badge thank you for stopping by okay thank you thank you it's bad just says
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:14.520]  kopenhagen 2014 so i asked him what the metal detectors for is there an airport in there
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:19.240]  yeah tell him we're gonna leave tell him you're gonna leave just a few more questions
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:28.920]  oh it's nothing i go ahead and go yes you leave don't think so all right thank you
[02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:32.520]  you think that's for stopping by
[02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:42.360]  oh boy you saw the metal detector the whole bit so um well again the whole point the reason
[02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:46.840]  we're doing this it is now right it is completely cordoned off i mean you walk in and it is like
[02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:55.000]  uh it's like a danish tsa actually this guy's look much better than tsa well listen uh
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:58.600]  david again for new listeners the reason we're covering this is they said this didn't exist for
[02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:04.120]  decades they made fun of it now they're in the news admitting they run things but we're kooks
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:08.680]  do not like it the eu's imploding no one wants to be part of it so they're starting wars in
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:15.640]  places like uh ukraine to try to keep it expanding this is the tyrants these are the people taking
[02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:19.960]  our liberties why don't you march down and try to go to the waterfront now and give us a view of
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:23.880]  the back and then if they come over and tell you to leave again say oh we left the inside
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:28.040]  do you want us to leave the grounds entirely and then say yes and then leave but i think
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:31.800]  they're going to be nice to you as long as you're gentlemanly our goal is to not get you arrested
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:35.720]  yeah so uh or david take whatever initiative you want what do you want to do next
[02:43:39.800 --> 02:43:42.760]  what do you want to do next david look down here look at the side here i'm not sure what's
[02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:47.000]  around the corner i guess we just we just drove straight here from the airport there's water
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:51.320]  made it here there's water so uh we can take a look at there but it looks like this is this is
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:57.880]  amazing alex look at this they've got concrete barricades here plus metal uh barricades on top
[02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:02.360]  of the concrete we used to be able to walk out and see the uh water here they've got that all
[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:07.000]  barricaded off so that's all barricaded all the way down there they've made it like a prison here
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:11.640]  truly amazing here i guess i haven't completed it yet here let's walk down to the end there
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:19.080]  there yeah so uh yeah he had on his badge there's no names on the badges everybody's in uh
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:24.440]  very nice suits and it just said kopenhagen 2014 so maybe they're bill deberg's private
[02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:29.320]  security i wonder uh how much is being paid for by bill deberg and how much is being paid for by
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:35.480]  the people of kopenhagen let's go out on that pier because i'm telling you if it's walkable
[02:44:35.480 --> 02:44:40.120]  or is that a dam not a pier i'm telling you that blocked off they got that blocked off
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:45.160]  from the bill deberg side you see right here they put concrete barrier barricades here and they put
[02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:48.840]  a they've really barricaded this place look at this it looks like that's public but you'll
[02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:58.360]  have to go out and go around it then that's outrageous well david uh you're there what do
[02:44:58.360 --> 02:45:11.400]  you um what do you make of all this yeah well we lost his feed uh let's uh go ahead and reconnect

[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:34.280]  police or if it's a police boat or if that's just uh an individual out there i think that's a police
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:40.600]  boat yeah they're driving like it is they slowed down take a look at us uh they've got everything
[02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:48.920]  barricaded with concrete and metal fences up above that um it's it's pretty amazing around here this
[02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:54.040]  across the way here it's very beautiful there's a lot of older buildings and of course on this side
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:47:00.760]  we've got the uh the glass structure oh look at the chef up there with his big hat they're preparing
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:07.000]  the fine food for the bill yeah let's stop let's get some footage of that of that chef go over to
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  the glass yeah put it right up against the window put it against the window right against the glass
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:16.040]  yeah yeah the chef's up above she's she's smiling yeah put it right against the glass yeah the chef's
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:21.880]  up there yeah maybe back up 20 feet where you're at you can get a shot there you go yeah can you
[02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:26.040]  guys see him yeah so again they don't want us looking in we're looking in we're investigating
[02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:31.480]  like media is supposed to do yep let's see if we can see something in some of these other windows
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:36.280]  a little bit further down here this area and again folks this is what your prison planet
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:43.240]  dot tv subscriptions are paying for we can go stick cameras in the windows that's a guy that's a guy
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:48.280]  doing bookkeeping hey i bet that guy's got badges and stuff and names not in a row you ought to go
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:55.720]  back stick yeah stick camera in there hey good to see you well we're just joined by paul joes
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:48:02.120]  the flat son hello we've been in we're just uh no yeah we went in the front yeah who else is
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:09.000]  with watson give us a pan of the crew sorry what who else is with you how are you guys
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:17.720]  yeah some of the other folks julia julia hi this is julia with this and paul joes of watson
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:22.440]  hey watson so you were inside uh give us your take on what's going on yeah
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:29.000]  yeah give us your take on what's going on um i can't hear what you're saying but yeah we just came
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:34.680]  up here to meet david for the first time and um there are some people across the other side of
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:39.480]  the street getting harassed by police because they were filming but we've probably seen at least a
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:45.080]  dozen people just walking back and forth filming which is strange because yesterday even if you
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:50.120]  weren't filming if you just were carrying a camera in the vicinity they would come up and harass you
[02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:55.160]  and chase you off basically but it seems to have changed now because now there are a dozen or so
[02:48:55.160 --> 02:48:59.640]  people walking around seems to be well we walked in the main lobby they've now got it set up like
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:04.120]  going into an airport so they've got uh metal detectors and the whole thing barricaded off
[02:49:04.120 --> 02:49:07.560]  and we said well we got reservations here we'd like how do we get in touch with anybody else
[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:13.000]  you have to call the hotel this is this is a private party now really yeah i'm surprised it's not
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:18.040]  completely blocked off because obviously we were due to stay there last night they kicked us out before
[02:49:18.040 --> 02:49:22.920]  that so i thought they would seal it off this morning when all the other guests checked out but
[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:28.040]  obviously they've relented again because of the stupid mistake of causing incidents that blow
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:33.800]  up in their faces like the arrest incident last night so they always seem to change tack when
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:38.920]  the light of publicity is shined on them watch and who are the Troy lines that you're with i want to
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:41.240]  i want to are they locals i want to get their take on bill deberg
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:47.800]  i think their video froze again ask them who some of the activists are they've run into
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:52.760]  they've run into and see if those young ladies want to say a word or two about what they think that's going on
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:57.080]  again skype is breaking up hey that's the technology ladies and gentlemen
[02:49:57.880 --> 02:50:01.240]  tell us what happened with your experience when you were harassed for the first time
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:07.400]  uh as soon as i said for in here you you want to meet somebody i just sat outside of the hotel
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:12.840]  and yeah yes
[02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:17.880]  do we do we need permission to tell them you're just on the waterfront why is he filming you
[02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:22.600]  yeah are you here are you seeing the hotel we were we were staying there last night yeah
[02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:28.040]  you've been here yesterday last night yeah tell them you already talked to skip the break look at
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:34.840]  this guy we went in to try and get reservations tonight yeah and and who are you and uh let's
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:41.560]  say this here okay tell them you already talked to the real security up front yeah we just went
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:46.280]  into and talked to the people up front where they've got the airport security you know let's take
[02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:50.120]  your interview we're skipping the no one break you just wanted to see what it looks like back here
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:56.520]  okay so i wouldn't inform them so yeah go inform them check behind look at that little police state
[02:50:56.520 --> 02:51:02.360]  guy i don't want to film me here and i guarantee you that guy comes from a third world country
[02:51:03.160 --> 02:51:07.080]  okay this is like a well you'd be arrested if anybody's ever filmed back side of this i mean
[02:51:07.080 --> 02:51:12.680]  i imagine a lot of everyone's able to film asking where he's from asking where he's from
[02:51:13.800 --> 02:51:19.960]  yeah so where are you from i'm from uh hotel no no no what country what country are you from
[02:51:21.320 --> 02:51:28.200]  uh here in denmark okay yeah he says he's here yeah yeah yeah right here look at him total power
[02:51:28.200 --> 02:51:32.040]  trip notice how the real bill berg security were like being gentlemanly they didn't want to scene
[02:51:32.040 --> 02:51:36.840]  that guy wants to act like a secret police agent anyways finish our interview with the woman
[02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:41.400]  let her finish i have a cap off i need my camera in my hands i had it like this sitting down just
[02:51:41.400 --> 02:51:46.600]  looking around someone came up to me immediately said what are you doing here meeting a friend what's
[02:51:46.600 --> 02:51:51.800]  what's your friend's name said a fake first name what's her last name like why are you talking to me
[02:51:51.800 --> 02:51:55.720]  it's like you're not to film here i'm not filming here i've been taking my camera i don't know how
[02:51:55.720 --> 02:52:03.080]  to be here excuse me i mean i look very threatening obviously no no no it's bigger police is about
[02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:08.120]  making you feel bad yeah it is threatening for them to get their picture taken they you know they're
[02:52:08.120 --> 02:52:11.960]  supposed to be completely anonymous completely private but they're supposed to know everything
[02:52:11.960 --> 02:52:15.480]  about us as soon as they see any camera i guess i was even holding my hand like well why do you
[02:52:15.480 --> 02:52:21.320]  have a camera like i like to take pictures actually yeah pictures are pretty aren't they
[02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:25.240]  and i think this is another is this more security out i think this is more security out here is that
[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:33.560]  more security can you tell uh interview the other activist lady interview the other lady and final
[02:52:33.560 --> 02:52:42.120]  what happened to her well this other lady right here is uh karen hi it's interesting before you
[02:52:42.120 --> 02:52:48.440]  came up and and went in to um talk to the people in the marriott uh they were two gentlemen across
[02:52:48.440 --> 02:52:56.040]  the street and they were filming and talking about it and the police came and the local police came
[02:52:56.040 --> 02:53:01.640]  and got their addresses and they're all their um vital information so i was assuming you would be
[02:53:01.640 --> 02:53:06.520]  stuck with that same situation yeah i don't know what's going on i mean we've kind of got in the
[02:53:06.520 --> 02:53:11.000]  past so far but i guess that guy's gonna be coming back he wants us to stay here it's because you
[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:16.520]  should follow it's because you look distinguished i'm telling you it's you're up man you look yeah
[02:53:16.520 --> 02:53:24.920]  like the ones that i guess we should just go i don't know but uh yeah it's really pretty here
[02:53:24.920 --> 02:53:29.160]  and i guess i really paranoid about people taking the back of the marriott i mean how many tens of
[02:53:29.160 --> 02:53:33.560]  thousands of people have stayed at the marriott and taken pictures well that we've looked it up
[02:53:33.560 --> 02:53:39.640]  online that's a public causeway that's a public uh boardwalk right there and they're blocking a
[02:53:39.640 --> 02:53:44.040]  public comments and trying to tell you you can't be behind hey alex right now they're putting up
[02:53:44.040 --> 02:53:49.320]  some kind of film right behind us on the window i guess to keep people from being able to look in
[02:53:49.320 --> 02:53:54.040]  that's newsworthy that they're putting up there the bill derberg is blacking out windows
[02:53:54.040 --> 02:53:59.400]  to stop the press that is important yeah yeah that's what they're putting so it's kind of a
[02:53:59.400 --> 02:54:04.520]  blurring film what it is it's transparent but it's it's uh blurring it it's kind of a
[02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:10.200]  oh they're not hiding anything inside folks yeah that's right that's right keep it is josh shooting
[02:54:10.200 --> 02:54:15.800]  this in hd are you shooting this in hd now i do we're just streaming it right now make sure we
[02:54:15.800 --> 02:54:22.920]  get hd of of of all this stuff as well yeah we will it's just that we were racing to try to get here
[02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:26.520]  and try no you're doing a great job you're doing a great job just you're not going to get this after
[02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:30.200]  after the night i mean they're shutting it down right now that barricade will probably be closed
[02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:36.760]  in about 20 minutes yeah yeah so they're putting uh putting film up so people can't get any shots i
[02:54:36.760 --> 02:54:43.000]  guess from a distance even though can anybody get up there on those uh walkways over there okay so i
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.960]  guess that's what they're afraid of i guess they're afraid somebody's gonna walk out there on those
[02:54:45.960 --> 02:54:50.920]  walkways there with a long lens and and get a glimpse hey guys i'm telling you right now
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:55.640]  you need to get some high def shots and then putting that film up that is newsworthy
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:59.800]  but they're blacking the windows out for bill derberg that i mean that picture tells a thousand
[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:04.440]  words can you get some high def shots of uh video putting this stuff on video this is this is
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:08.840]  sensational thanks to go up on youtube that's newsworthy right now and then uh you guys need
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:12.760]  to go ahead and get out of there before they i mean that truck was almost done closing it down
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:16.600]  and and and i think you should get out of there in the next five minutes or so because we're
[02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:25.480]  going to be ending this so um yeah uh who's getting the hd right now uh right now i'm sorry
[02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:29.960]  what's your name julia from brave the world julia is getting uh some hd are you getting uh stills

[02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:41.240]  hd and video hardly get yeah i'm pointing my camera at it and you can't really see through it it's
[02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:47.160]  too reflective anyway so they're going to quite an extent to you make it less yeah they're that's
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:52.040]  her point is that they're they've already got a pretty reflective window here and uh just have
[02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:57.080]  a watch and shoot hd video with his iphone okay just i just it's like i'm like directing this from
[02:55:57.080 --> 02:56:01.640]  the us tell them we're getting it yeah we're getting it with the iphone as well it's sensational
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:05.960]  i want to get that out on youtube right now in fact in fact i want you guys to stop for a minute
[02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:11.480]  shoot a report talking about that david uh with the live stream on you and with lots and getting it
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:15.800]  sort of new video shoot a report about them literally blacking out the truth blacking out
[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:20.920]  the windows talk about meeting in a dark room this is it the global government meeting the criminal
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:28.280]  e-mating we're on the march they're on the run give us a report david night okay do we do it right
[02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:32.120]  now you want us to uh break off the broadcast no no i want to get it all right now that's why
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:37.400]  we're there is to get this that's a big deal them doing that well here we are we're back in the back
[02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:41.720]  of the marriott here in covenhagen where they're going to have the bill deberg meeting beginning
[02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:47.800]  tomorrow and in preparation for what they're doing you can see the guy behind us he's putting up a
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:53.960]  translucent film to further obscure what's going on inside they've already got a reflective glass
[02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:59.240]  backing here but they don't want anybody they're so paranoid that people are going to get a glimpse
[02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:03.000]  of who is attending they're going to put on an attendees list we don't know if that's a real
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:06.840]  list or not they could be telling us that people are coming who aren't coming they they're certainly
[02:57:06.840 --> 02:57:10.920]  going to be people that are going to be coming that they're not going to tell us about and they
[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:16.680]  don't want us to see any of this so they're putting up temporary window films as well as blocking the
[02:57:16.680 --> 02:57:22.520]  place off with concrete barriers with metal barriers it's uh essentially they're afraid of
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:27.960]  of everything which say paul yeah it's it's an improvement on last year though because they're
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:33.560]  built a wall entirely around the entire grove hotel and then we were kept over a mile away from that
[02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:37.960]  so and of course there was the anti-terror zone around the whole area which gave them
[02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:41.880]  in their own mind complete right to completely violate everything that's right freedom supposed
[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:47.240]  to stand for but it's it's not as paranoid now as it was last night last night it was like a
[02:57:47.240 --> 02:57:52.280]  feeding frenzy they were just on everybody even carrying a camera anywhere near the hotel so
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:57.800]  compared to last night it's not as bad well I guess they looked at some of the press and
[02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:02.040]  decided maybe they wouldn't do that a second time sure well here's the bottom line first they
[02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:05.720]  didn't exist we prove it exists and now it's no big deal they're not trying to hide anything
[02:58:05.720 --> 02:58:09.880]  they are trying to hide stuff because there's illegal stuff going on it's illegal in the US
[02:58:09.880 --> 02:58:16.360]  under multiple federal laws it's illegal under British laws the stuff that's going on there
[02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:21.720]  it's illegal under EU laws it's a big criminal globalist confab meeting these are the people
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:25.720]  pushing to take our guns these are the people trying to break our families up these are the
[02:58:25.720 --> 02:58:29.720]  people to put the floor on the water i'm going to overdrive david so you guys get out of there
