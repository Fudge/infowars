[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.880]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:36.880 --> 00:41.680]  Another Friday is upon us and will soon come and go. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so
[00:41.680 --> 00:48.760]  much for joining me today. It is the 24th day of May 2013, and we are gonna be live
[00:48.760 --> 00:52.120]  here for the next three hours and have open phones.
[00:52.120 --> 00:56.600]  Armistice Ben Fuchs is gonna pop in about the march on Monsanto tomorrow. We've got
[00:56.600 --> 01:01.840]  a Lee Ann McAdoo special report on that as well, we're gonna be airing. And in the third
[01:01.840 --> 01:07.280]  hour popping in is the former Minister of Defense of Canada, who's been speaking out
[01:07.280 --> 01:15.400]  against the New World Order and the Bilderberg Group, Paul Hellyer. So we'll definitely be
[01:15.400 --> 01:19.640]  having some interesting questions for him coming up today.
[01:19.640 --> 01:25.880]  It is a, well, quite frankly, an orgy of information as usual, but it's just intensifying. Roger
[01:25.880 --> 01:34.600]  Ailes, the head of Fox and the news division of News Corp has written a letter to Fox employees
[01:34.600 --> 01:42.080]  dealing with the government persecution and naked tyranny. And now they are saying the
[01:42.080 --> 01:46.100]  federal government is that if you basically talk to anybody in government and even ask
[01:46.100 --> 01:49.360]  their opinion about the weather, you're gonna be arrested.
[01:49.360 --> 01:55.280]  So we are going, I mean, this is literal. In fact, Roger Ailes talks about that. This
[01:55.280 --> 01:59.280]  is a criminal government that wants to have a chilling effect and intimidate everybody,
[01:59.280 --> 02:05.000]  but it's liberal. I mean, it's so trendy. I mean, Barack Obama is at least part African,
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.600]  so it's just impossible that he could do anything wrong.
[02:11.600 --> 02:18.480]  And then meanwhile, we have got a lot of other really important news dealing with the economy.
[02:18.480 --> 02:26.720]  Bernanke out by August, QENs, rates up, crash, that's the Wall Street Journal headline. I've
[02:26.720 --> 02:34.240]  got an NBC headline and video clip coming up where they say buy canned foods in case
[02:34.240 --> 02:36.220]  an asteroid hits the earth.
[02:36.220 --> 02:43.560]  By the way, I didn't say that, as I know Rachel Maddow with her tiny audience will clip that
[02:43.560 --> 02:49.360]  out and have me saying buy canned foods and asteroids gonna hit us. That's NBC saying
[02:49.360 --> 02:58.000]  that. EMS, NBC, Microsoft, Bill Gates, NBC says prepare for asteroid, but they'll just
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.480]  take it and say I said it.
[03:01.480 --> 03:05.000]  And that leads us to another point. I never got to this yesterday. I briefly talked about
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.680]  it, but it really hit me last night, how ridiculous it is. So I'm gonna cover this as well in
[03:10.680 --> 03:16.280]  this hour because I don't usually cover the news just because we're in it. But when you've
[03:16.280 --> 03:22.880]  got two articles in the Huffington Post, the Washington Post, Raw Story, every White House
[03:22.880 --> 03:29.000]  organ repeating the talking points of the admittedly White House completely run George
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.360]  Soros funded media matters.
[03:34.360 --> 03:39.640]  Now they say that I said the tornado. It's not now that I said there's weather weapons,
[03:39.640 --> 03:45.800]  which are on record, but they just hope you're stupid. Now they openly say I say that Obama
[03:45.800 --> 03:52.560]  did it with the tornado. Which I just say, bring it on, man, more of this stuff. Because
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.360]  I was reading last night on Raw Story and the Huffington Post and the Washington Post,
[03:57.360 --> 04:00.600]  most of the comments were going, well, here's the UN treaty on weather weapons.
[04:00.600 --> 04:05.880]  I mean, here's Bill Gates developing them. I mean, here they are with the HARP program.
[04:05.880 --> 04:11.320]  Here are the Chinese admittedly controlling their weather. In fact, guys, you've done
[04:11.320 --> 04:16.440]  an exemplary job. I forgot to tell you this morning. Will you print me, type in Dubai
[04:16.440 --> 04:21.240]  makes the desert green with weather control. It'll show the different antennas they use.
[04:21.240 --> 04:25.520]  And then print Bill Gates geoengineering, give me a London Guardian on that or something.
[04:25.520 --> 04:32.080]  And then print UN weather weapon treaty 1978. And just print me, not the whole treaty, but
[04:32.080 --> 04:39.120]  just a few pages of it cuz I don't wanna waste paper for the environment. And just some of
[04:39.120 --> 04:44.360]  it, or like weather weapons and click news. You'll have like Fox, CNN, cuz then I'm gonna
[04:44.360 --> 04:49.360]  show all the weather weapons. And all I said is they got weather weapons, this is probably
[04:49.360 --> 04:56.440]  real. And meanwhile, Senator Whitehouse said Midwesterners brought this on themselves.
[04:56.440 --> 05:01.800]  So they're the real conspiracy theorists.
[05:01.800 --> 05:06.040]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[05:06.040 --> 05:10.440]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage. We thought the danger
[05:10.440 --> 05:15.840]  was drought, or food delivered to our gas tanks, or our food sold to other countries,
[05:15.840 --> 05:20.740]  or food so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could afford it. But we
[05:20.740 --> 05:25.600]  have just experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty and security
[05:25.600 --> 05:32.560]  without even a fight. Government regulation. After a 160 year tradition of self-reliance,
[05:32.560 --> 05:37.040]  the do it yourself and charitable Mormon food storage canneries in half the country are
[05:37.040 --> 05:43.680]  forced to shut down due to excessive government regulations. Grow your own food, more regulations.
[05:43.680 --> 05:50.080]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it. Call 800-409-5633 or

[09:07.040 --> 09:13.240]  tip of the spear in the fight to awaken humanity to the global eugenics technocratic takeover
[09:13.240 --> 09:21.240]  and I am your host Alex Jones. You know I read this news, I go over all this information
[09:21.240 --> 09:29.560]  and I got to be honest I get crazed in the morning, crazed with just focus and then my
[09:29.560 --> 09:36.360]  mind starts accelerating and it gets very very frustrating that it's so hard to go over
[09:36.360 --> 09:39.560]  all the information and what's unfolding.
[09:39.560 --> 09:47.280]  You know markets were rattled yesterday and they're talking about Bernanke when he leaves
[09:47.280 --> 09:52.720]  in August in the Wall Street Journal reportedly they're saying is going to leave by August
[09:52.720 --> 10:09.200]  and that QE infinity will end and that rates will shoot up that there will be a crash.
[10:09.200 --> 10:13.780]  That's what all the gearing up is with the bullets and the armored vehicles and the preparations
[10:13.780 --> 10:20.600]  to seize your pension funds to bail out the mega banks. They hold you hostage and say
[10:20.600 --> 10:26.240]  bail us out in Europe bail us out in the US bail us out in Asia but they designed it as
[10:26.240 --> 10:33.200]  an implosion then they get all your tax money and then lecture you how you owe them interest
[10:33.200 --> 10:36.640]  on the money you gave them.
[10:36.640 --> 10:40.720]  Everybody knows that the European banks rebelled out everybody knows the big globalist banks
[10:40.720 --> 10:47.240]  in the US rebelled out the same group in 2008, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 but by now it's like oh
[10:47.240 --> 10:59.240]  the lazy Spanish the lazy Greeks the lazy Italians they're not lazy they work constantly
[10:59.240 --> 11:01.240]  over there.
[11:01.240 --> 11:08.160]  They work two three jobs just like Americans they work six days a week I've gone and looked
[11:08.160 --> 11:13.200]  up the actuaries the numbers are out there. Sure the Germans get a month of vacation the
[11:13.200 --> 11:22.020]  French do but they certainly don't in those other countries and they're hard working people
[11:22.020 --> 11:27.880]  and it's the globalist that created the derivative scam not to even create a bubble and pump
[11:27.880 --> 11:33.480]  up the economy but to infect the entire world market.
[11:33.480 --> 11:38.280]  Stem isn't meant to create global prosperity it's meant to create global pestilence in
[11:38.280 --> 11:43.360]  the financial markets to then hold everyone hostage and demand a financial dictatorship
[11:43.360 --> 11:48.200]  globally or they will wreck it even further and then you acquiesce to the threat of the
[11:48.200 --> 11:54.680]  terrorist and then you only go deeper into bondage.
[11:54.680 --> 12:07.640]  The bravada arrogant stuffed puts befuelled new world order is run by a bunch of madmen
[12:07.640 --> 12:13.960]  and yes fortune favors the bold and just as Napoleon and Hitler went a bridge too far
[12:13.960 --> 12:19.880]  and invaded too many countries the globalist are trying to invade the entire human psyche
[12:19.880 --> 12:26.240]  and give us psychic death a psychic infection a psychic spiritual wound to hate ourselves
[12:26.240 --> 12:32.080]  and hate our life force and hate our survival instinct and stand down so they can take over
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.800]  the world.
[12:37.800 --> 12:44.260]  The new world order is dead on arrival by design it's meant to implode the globe financially
[12:44.260 --> 12:49.360]  economically where they are the only men left standing but that's not going to happen the
[12:49.360 --> 12:59.280]  new world order will be swept under in their own riptide and will be torn physically spiritually
[12:59.280 --> 13:08.680]  mentally financially limb from limb they will be drawn and they will be quartered they will
[13:08.680 --> 13:19.840]  be hoisted on their own petard they will fall into their own pit they believe that they're
[13:19.840 --> 13:25.920]  going to become gods they are in a race with different combines who agree on world government
[13:25.920 --> 13:30.360]  as the structure of dominance over humanity but who are not in full control over their
[13:30.360 --> 13:38.960]  own centralized system as they struggle in battle or control at the top of the pyramid
[13:38.960 --> 13:44.520]  that's why they are pedal to the metal genetic engineering life extension technologies weaponizing
[13:44.520 --> 13:56.520]  all electronics all computer systems in a panopticonic grid of dehumanization in fact
[13:56.520 --> 14:02.120]  we guys print this I meant to cover it two days ago and never did Schmidt the head of
[14:02.120 --> 14:07.440]  Google came out and said I think it's stupid the headline is Schmidt says don't be evil
[14:07.440 --> 14:15.160]  slogan of Google was silly is the headline he gave a speech and said that and he was
[14:15.160 --> 14:24.000]  questioned and the talk he gave and he said well there is no evil that's only in the Bible
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.080]  when you hear that ladies and gentlemen you know what they're doing they're telling you
[14:28.080 --> 14:33.520]  there's no rudder they're telling you there's no standard they're telling you there is nothing
[14:33.520 --> 14:45.560]  that matters so you are blind and death and tasteless and touchless and have no bearing
[14:45.560 --> 14:53.880]  you know a rotten steak full of maggots is evil evil to your palate you know a killer
[14:53.880 --> 14:57.960]  grabbing a small child out of the back of a backyard and raping and torturing them for
[14:57.960 --> 15:04.480]  months psychopaths call it using them up before they kill them you know that's inherently
[15:04.480 --> 15:13.200]  evil it's against life it's against prosperity it's against the universe it is an aberration
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.720]  to not fall to your knees and see the beauty in the firmament of the sky at night and to
[15:17.720 --> 15:22.820]  love all the beautiful and innocent and good things and want to crush the evil not want
[15:22.820 --> 15:29.800]  to crush the innocent it is a cancer in the universe it is a fraud it is a virus it is
[15:29.800 --> 15:37.320]  a malfunction and it tells us we are deformed it tells us we're blind no I have gotten deep
[15:37.320 --> 15:46.040]  knowledge of good and evil I have more knowledge of evil than most these evil people and they
[15:46.040 --> 15:51.440]  believe they are achieving power by going against the universal programming and it's
[15:51.440 --> 15:55.600]  the opposite and so I just want to talk directly to the globalist before I get into the news
[15:55.600 --> 16:06.360]  here many of you after you attain great power realize that it's actually a millstone but
[16:06.360 --> 16:13.000]  then you're so deep in it and so fearful and in the struggle to gain power you burn yourselves
[16:13.000 --> 16:20.360]  out and so you've already carried out your mission for el diablo still others just enjoy
[16:20.360 --> 16:25.520]  the raw exercise of power and the different flavors of it but your statement that there
[16:25.520 --> 16:33.720]  is no evil there is no right and wrong that you are beyond the good and evil any of you
[16:33.720 --> 16:41.520]  that actually believe that are nothing but imprisoned spiritual slaves the higher ups
[16:41.520 --> 16:48.940]  above you truly believe that through darkness there will be brought light and that lucifer
[16:48.940 --> 16:58.560]  is god and that lucifer has chosen them to be gods the highest level of the new world
[16:58.560 --> 17:07.260]  order actually is beyond your term of good and evil but they are deceived they believe
[17:07.260 --> 17:15.320]  they're doing horrible things and see it as evil but believe that they are simply bringing
[17:15.320 --> 17:26.160]  in a time of darkness to bring in a time of great light and that is another lie
[17:26.160 --> 17:40.400]  the truth is there is a force in this universe that wants to kill and destroy life all life
[17:40.400 --> 17:50.940]  new life old forms of life the counterfeit world being built by monsanto and google and
[17:50.940 --> 17:59.340]  microsoft all part of the inner eugenics combine with with ibm as its progenitor a eugenics
[17:59.340 --> 18:13.440]  foundation cult with ibm at the center its plan is the total destruction of this planet
[18:13.440 --> 18:22.760]  you want to know what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole it's death and all of you intellectually
[18:22.760 --> 18:28.160]  but also at a subconscious level because your subconscious is enumerably more powerful than
[18:28.160 --> 18:37.440]  your conscious mind it is your mind the cerebral cortex is only the narrow focus of the mind
[18:37.440 --> 18:42.620]  you already know what i'm telling you is true intellectually academically you can prove
[18:42.620 --> 18:53.340]  it all and we do but there are very few in the world who serve this conspiracy against
[18:53.340 --> 19:00.200]  life and against truth who actually know the great plan but there are those in love with
[19:00.200 --> 19:11.060]  death and in love with the siren song of destruction who are wedded to satan forever in the black
[19:11.060 --> 19:23.280]  tomb the black grave the black hole that they would make this planet there is a spiritual
[19:23.280 --> 19:29.760]  force in the universe that does not want humanity to achieve its next level of development the
[19:29.760 --> 19:36.100]  eye has not seen the ear has not heard what the creator of the universe has in store for
[19:36.100 --> 19:45.240]  those made in the image and the likeness not only the image the likeness the likeness the

[24:41.320 --> 24:47.480]  oids they can do it the problem is their leadership like Ted Cruz said on Monday is basically
[24:47.480 --> 24:52.840]  bought and paid for by the same people the republican leadership and that's why you see
[24:52.840 --> 25:02.040]  the mainstream media and the neo cons attacking Rand Paul Ted Cruz Matt Drudge Alex Jones
[25:02.040 --> 25:07.820]  people like that I mean we've now got Glenn Beck saying he's a libertarian attacking establishment
[25:07.820 --> 25:12.880]  republicans we're very close to getting Rush Limbaugh to do that I mean listen people just
[25:12.880 --> 25:17.800]  don't expect that libertarians and constitutionalist freedom lovers where everyone to call us couldn't

[25:28.840 --> 25:34.400]  that I have time to talk to and I don't have time to call like GQ back I'm not bragging
[25:34.400 --> 25:39.560]  error or Associated Press I mean I've got stacks of just you know we want to do a cover
[25:39.560 --> 25:44.340]  story on this cover story on that how much money do you make it's always the same question
[25:44.340 --> 25:49.440]  on and on and on and on and on in fact remind me to call Bloomberg back because even though
[25:49.440 --> 25:54.720]  I made it clear I want an email on record to them it's not bad to make money but I know
[25:54.720 --> 25:59.240]  how they act they're like so how much money do you make and I said seven million dollars
[25:59.240 --> 26:04.000]  a year is what it costs to run this operation so you keep seven million dollars a year and
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.880]  I'm like no I said it cost seven million dollars a year to run this operation and I put almost
[26:08.880 --> 26:12.960]  all the money into it but it'd be okay if I was making money but my goal is freedom
[26:12.960 --> 26:20.280]  and a future destiny for humanity that's what gets me really excited and they would just
[26:20.280 --> 26:25.200]  go back to show you make a lot of money so will you remind somebody when in their emails
[26:25.200 --> 26:30.760]  I want it on record that we it takes seven million to run this place that's that's their
[26:30.760 --> 26:36.680]  answer see that problem is I've got too much on my mind they're doing some cover story
[26:36.680 --> 26:44.800]  for Bloomberg and I'm like well what's the cover story for well we can't see and I go

[34:27.060 --> 34:33.200]  to the white house here because george florals funds it with millions a year the white house
[34:33.200 --> 34:40.040]  transition chief and others publicly run it and media matters it has a tiny visitorship
[34:40.040 --> 34:47.680]  on it still is important because it is white house run on record its memos have come out
[34:47.680 --> 34:52.080]  two years ago they want to infiltrate alternative media that means getting hired there to quote
[34:52.080 --> 35:01.160]  internally sabotage and destroy it is an intelligence operation of uh of deceivers and they are
[35:01.160 --> 35:07.880]  used for cnn and msnbc's talking points if you see a media matters article attacking
[35:07.880 --> 35:16.480]  myself uh info awards.com prison planet.com paul joseph watson matt drudge of drudge report.com
[35:16.480 --> 35:23.720]  andrew napolitano whoever they're attacking he will then see it on cnn and msnbc that
[35:23.720 --> 35:29.880]  day or the next day word for word they never give it credit though but they word for word
[35:29.880 --> 35:33.880]  that's their directive from the white house and that way they can keep it separated someone
[35:33.880 --> 35:38.560]  from the white house so it's not the white house directly running msnbc or cnn the talking
[35:38.560 --> 35:43.880]  points are written and then they are adopted and loaded into teleprompters uh that night
[35:43.880 --> 35:53.600]  for rachel matt owl uh chrissy matthews uh and uh cia anderson cooper and all the rest
[35:53.600 --> 36:02.800]  of them and a day after the tragic tornado uh this week uh hit more oklahoma the suburb
[36:02.800 --> 36:09.280]  of oklahoma city haulers kept calling in saying we think it's weather weapons could it be
[36:09.280 --> 36:14.720]  weather weapons and i spoke off and on for the three hour show about it and i'd actually
[36:14.720 --> 36:18.320]  been talking the day before when even before the tornado happened the day of the tornado
[36:18.320 --> 36:24.440]  i had a weather uh weapons whistleblower nine-year air force veteran on talking about just tons
[36:24.440 --> 36:31.960]  every week of barium salts aluminum dioxide there in oklahoma uh coming to the air force
[36:31.960 --> 36:40.160]  space so i've had you know clips of the white house science are on air about geoengineering
[36:40.160 --> 36:45.140]  uh there's shows on discovery channel history channel about it i've interviewed uh ben livingstone
[36:45.140 --> 36:51.240]  meteorologist the father of weather weapons that they have you know discovery channel
[36:51.240 --> 36:57.000]  shows about i mean this is a this is like talking about vietnam and they're saying it
[36:57.000 --> 37:02.720]  doesn't exist i mean it's been national geographic shows associated press everybody knows about
[37:02.720 --> 37:08.300]  weather modification weather weapons harp programs and so i said i i don't think this
[37:08.300 --> 37:14.320]  is a weather weapon probably i said it's probably a real tornado we're at a 60-year low uh usa
[37:14.320 --> 37:20.600]  today reported that maybe pull that up on screen for folks of tornadoes and uh saying
[37:20.600 --> 37:26.580]  we should pay carbon taxes like senator winehouse said or we're going to cause more of this
[37:26.580 --> 37:34.680]  is just voodoo it's total voodoo democratic senator urges oklahoma tornado again democratic
[37:34.680 --> 37:40.400]  senator uses oklahoma tornado for anti-gop rant over global warming and he said you midwesterner
[37:40.400 --> 37:44.840]  red state people we're gonna play the clip he said you know we're sick of paying for
[37:44.840 --> 37:50.800]  you you won't vote for the carbon taxes and all the rest of it and so it's your fault
[37:50.800 --> 37:55.880]  this is happening and we're sick of you so he basically said oklahoma you deserve what
[37:55.880 --> 38:01.360]  happened to you and that we're you know because of you were being flooded on the east coast
[38:01.360 --> 38:06.280]  i mean just crazy talk there's always been tornadoes always been hurricanes always been
[38:06.280 --> 38:11.160]  earthquakes there's earthquakes now they say pay al gore carbon taxes pay obama and the
[38:11.160 --> 38:16.360]  chicago carbon exchange money you're causing this i mean it's like witch doctors of old
[38:16.360 --> 38:21.160]  saying you're going to cause the the sun to not come up tomorrow if you don't give me
[38:21.160 --> 38:25.140]  the best hut in the village and then there's an eclipse everybody bows down before the
[38:25.140 --> 38:30.920]  witch doctor and now for you know 20 generations his family takes over then he finally says
[38:30.920 --> 38:35.920]  ah sacrifice your kids to me every culture ends up with witch doctors dancing around
[38:35.920 --> 38:40.200]  you know throwing stuff into the fire causing causing poofs of smoke and everyone bowing
[38:40.200 --> 38:48.200]  down to them and that's all these people are 21st century con artists so senator whitehouse
[38:48.200 --> 38:53.200]  comes out and says the midwest basically deserves this it's their fault because we won't pay
[38:53.200 --> 38:59.900]  the ransom to them and meanwhile there's massive geoengineering going on five billion dollars
[38:59.900 --> 39:04.620]  worth a year by the department of energy the chem trailing that's that's just thousands
[39:04.620 --> 39:09.000]  of government documents it's publicly admitted but they can tell the public doesn't exist
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.160]  and that's what she said so so so my wife last night i was watching this at about 11
[39:13.160 --> 39:18.720]  o'clock and she goes man you ought to sue them you you did you now they're saying that
[39:18.720 --> 39:24.140]  you said the tornado was government controlled and i said honey they're discredited they're
[39:24.140 --> 39:29.600]  public figures i'm a public figure uh they hurt themselves doing this i said this is
[39:29.600 --> 39:34.280]  wonderful she goes well just makes me mad and i go doesn't make me mad makes me as happy
[39:34.280 --> 39:41.000]  as a pig and you know what i mean this is awesome this is awesome because we tell the
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.500]  truth we're teleprompter free we bring out big complex thoughts people actually resonate
[39:46.500 --> 39:52.200]  with it they dumb the news down to dumb you down frontline did a good piece about a decade
[39:52.200 --> 39:57.180]  ago about how they did studies that it's not that people are getting dumber and so tv gets
[39:57.180 --> 40:02.720]  dumber tv is dumber and then that makes you dumber which is really common sense garbage
[40:02.720 --> 40:06.960]  in garbage out you program a computer bad it's gonna be bad so we're up here with complex
[40:06.960 --> 40:12.080]  thoughts and so what do they do with that they go in and and and on media matters you
[40:12.080 --> 40:16.200]  notice it's audio only so they don't show the cuts but with her they just show a short
[40:16.200 --> 40:22.600]  clip where i'm saying well you know if they've got weather modification going on they probably
[40:22.600 --> 40:28.480]  don't even know if they cause this but probably real well they edit that down to make it sound
[40:28.480 --> 40:35.580]  like that i'm saying the tornado was sent by obama when there's and also went further
[40:35.580 --> 40:42.120]  and said the lady no no no you're gonna see small planes and stuff low in and around a
[40:42.120 --> 40:47.000]  storm formation that could create tornadoes when hot and cold you know air comes together
[40:47.000 --> 40:52.400]  i talked about meteorology i went over the history of it i mean i really did a breakdown
[40:52.400 --> 40:57.800]  almost like a university lecture it's trying to get people to actually think and i said
[40:57.800 --> 41:01.920]  so it's probably not that and and we're gonna write an article today with a full full clip
[41:01.920 --> 41:08.400]  up there of the caller uh from the tuesday show but the point is they took that edited
[41:08.400 --> 41:14.560]  it down and then then said you know first on wednesday it was i said it could be man-made
[41:14.560 --> 41:19.400]  and i'm crazy because there's weather modification and everybody in the in in all the white house
[41:19.400 --> 41:23.600]  controlled news sites was going well actually there is weather weapons you're saying he's
[41:23.600 --> 41:27.360]  a kook for saying it could be weather weapons and they were posting all the un treaties
[41:27.360 --> 41:33.760]  and national geographic and ap and Reuters so then they flipped yesterday and are now
[41:33.760 --> 41:45.440]  going directly to alex jones says that obama sent the tornado and they did that from wednesday
[41:45.440 --> 41:50.440]  with her directive that no no no obama sent the tornado of course i didn't say that and
[41:50.440 --> 41:54.800]  anybody watching that knows i didn't say that but that's who they think you are they operate
[41:54.800 --> 42:04.280]  in lies and deceit and i mean it's now no exaggeration in hundreds of publications they're
[42:04.280 --> 42:10.740]  doing a full court press with this let's pull the washington post back up matt al shames
[42:10.740 --> 42:23.100]  republicans and info wars conspiracy theorist alex jones or conspiracist alex jones it reads
[42:23.100 --> 42:32.360]  like conspira racist is that conspiracist i guess they're inventing words
[42:32.360 --> 42:39.360]  because they know subconsciously you see the word racist there the point is is that they
[42:39.360 --> 42:47.520]  come out and they go oh you're blown away oh oh you're discredited you're a kook oh
[42:47.520 --> 42:51.160]  my gosh the republicans are doing hearings about the two billion plus bullets and the
[42:51.160 --> 42:56.040]  seven thousand armored vehicles they just bought and they're doing things about claiming
[42:56.040 --> 43:01.120]  the military train to put us in fema camps and they're doing i mean the republicans are
[43:01.120 --> 43:05.920]  getting their talking points from alex jones and she goes will you please stop it stop
[43:05.920 --> 43:10.440]  it and of course that's when she's not saying don't listen to ran paul and ted cruise they're
[43:10.440 --> 43:16.360]  gonna discredit you republicans whatever you do stop giving them attention you're discredited
[43:16.360 --> 43:21.880]  what they're actually saying is please stop don't no no don't get an hour building fema
[43:21.880 --> 43:26.320]  camps and spying on you and and trying to intimidate and arrest reporters don't look
[43:26.320 --> 43:30.080]  into how we're claiming the military's under nato command don't look at how we're funding
[43:30.080 --> 43:35.440]  al-qaeda groups in libya and syria don't don't listen to this madman don't don't no ted cruise
[43:35.440 --> 43:39.880]  he's discrediting you they know ted cruise will energize libertarians and conservatives
[43:39.880 --> 43:44.160]  and then they will overthrow the old republican leadership and we'll take the country back
[43:44.160 --> 43:49.200]  so she's like ted cruise is totally discredited he's saying the republican leadership's bad
[43:49.200 --> 43:53.400]  now oh that'll really discredit you this is what they're totally afraid of and they're
[43:53.400 --> 44:03.120]  all about as control freaks shedding the narrative that you do what they say and they go there
[44:03.120 --> 44:08.000]  are no two billion bullets and now they're like so what we got two million bullets alex
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.760]  jones is discredited the two billion bullets aren't for what he said they were and then
[44:12.760 --> 44:17.280]  i mean you read these ap debunking articles and stuff and it says yeah there are two billion
[44:17.280 --> 44:22.400]  bullets kind of but they're not for you and then hollow points over target practice and
[44:22.400 --> 44:25.560]  you know the government's not training for war with you oh really we have hundreds of
[44:25.560 --> 44:29.380]  your training manuals saying it's for gun owners veterans are turning better you know
[44:29.380 --> 44:34.320]  never mind that alex jones is discredited look republicans you've got to stop you've
[44:34.320 --> 44:40.120]  got to tell your you've got to tell matt drudge to stop linking to him let me see the report
[44:40.120 --> 44:43.880]  every week about that and you've got to have ron paul's got to stop going on this show
[44:43.880 --> 44:48.740]  and and and and and ted cruise is bad and don't do any republicans do not talk like
[44:48.740 --> 44:56.080]  these people do not do not behave like any of these people it's okay because they're
[44:56.080 --> 45:01.120]  discrediting you they're no no what we're hurting them and they're desperate matt ows
[45:01.120 --> 45:10.560]  gone from a million viewers to four hundred thousand in a year on average on a good night
[45:10.560 --> 45:15.400]  six hundred thousand morgan's gone from over a million to four hundred thousand and plunging
[45:15.400 --> 45:20.640]  folks they are bleeding out hemorrhaging in shock on the ground because we have the truth
[45:20.640 --> 45:26.360]  going and now we're going to show fm dash three nine dot forty that obama demanded the
[45:26.360 --> 45:31.100]  pentagon put out for the re-education of conservatives and libertarians and our gun confiscation
[45:31.100 --> 45:36.580]  it's all in here and we're gonna we're gonna go oh you don't want that do you does that
[45:36.580 --> 45:41.800]  discredit me because it's real it's an army dot mill you don't like that very much do
[45:41.800 --> 45:51.440]  you oh you want me to stop i'm not gonna stop i'm not gonna stop okay so i want to show
[45:51.440 --> 46:03.680]  madow miss madow miss madow i want to show miss madow i want to show her right now just
[46:03.680 --> 46:12.080]  what we printed up today document cam shot please okay democratic senator urges oklahoma
[46:12.080 --> 46:18.960]  again democratic senator uses oklahoma tornado for anti-gop rant over global warming and
[46:18.960 --> 46:23.880]  i'm going to get to that clip later where they actually blame midwesterners and oklahomans
[46:23.880 --> 46:28.920]  for it saying you didn't pay us carbon taxes and we're sick of giving you billions of dollars
[46:28.920 --> 46:34.520]  when you have floods or when you have droughts because i mean that is outrageous that should
[46:34.520 --> 46:40.460]  be the end of his political career right there blaming the tornado victims oh but no that's
[46:40.460 --> 46:47.300]  the real crazy wild-eyed conspiracy theory i come out i can reapply that clip coming
[46:47.300 --> 46:51.160]  up i come out and i say callers are calling i got open phones and i'm like yeah it could
[46:51.160 --> 46:54.880]  be weather weapons but probably not that's tornado alley and people need storm shelters
[46:54.880 --> 46:59.560]  and but here's the history of weather modification and it's harder to steer groups of tornadoes
[46:59.560 --> 47:04.560]  they can mainly help create them but this probably wasn't that and they think their
[47:04.560 --> 47:10.120]  audience is so dumb the white house goes the cast sunstein types go go on this go on this
[47:10.120 --> 47:15.520]  attacking the saying the government can control tornadoes certified in the 60s they could
[47:15.520 --> 47:20.840]  do that and hurricanes stanford research institute declassified five years ago six years ago
[47:20.840 --> 47:26.280]  now they think you're dumb they're targeting an audience folks that cannot tie their shoelaces
[47:26.280 --> 47:30.080]  can you imagine the people that actually watch this globalist garbage where everything's
[47:30.080 --> 47:36.720]  anti-family anti-man anti-woman anti-common sense 24-7 now let's go over some of this
[47:36.720 --> 47:45.680]  here is a story dubai's weather wizards create rain wrestle power for mother nature that
[47:45.680 --> 47:50.800]  was first in the daily mail and it shows graphics we go the daily mail in color of how the harp
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.320]  antennas control the weather of course our government invented these put them up all
[47:54.320 --> 48:01.680]  over the country first in the northern clines and but if you talk about it it doesn't exist
[48:01.680 --> 48:08.120]  okay here's another one national geographic scientists make dozens of storms in abu dhabi
[48:08.120 --> 48:13.960]  desert and then it goes into the secretive swiss company that can control the weather
[48:13.960 --> 48:19.960]  and then we go out and point out these exact antennas have been put up in every major region
[48:19.960 --> 48:23.540]  and then they're and then they won't let anybody into them and if you ask they say it's a conspiracy
[48:23.540 --> 48:36.920]  theory okay whether un weather weapons treaty from the 1970s unga res 31 slash 72 tias 9614
[48:36.920 --> 48:42.840]  i mean here you go rachel on the weather weapons a treaty oh here's another one bill gates
[48:42.840 --> 48:47.320]  backs climate science lobbying for large-scale geoengineering and then you got state department
[48:47.320 --> 48:52.700]  random 200 admitting they use weather as a weapon wars is uh food is a weapon all of
[48:52.700 --> 49:00.180]  it so i'm giving you facts here uh h r 2995 weather modification research and technology
[49:00.180 --> 49:04.000]  transfer authorization and then they also set up this weather board i mean that's just
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.200]  a small i mean there are thousands of mainstream articles about this we're going to skip this
[49:08.200 --> 49:15.120]  network break because i need to get to this clip now now we've got all of this going on
[49:15.120 --> 49:20.800]  all of this happening all of this unfolding and there's a tornado our listeners know there's
[49:20.800 --> 49:25.380]  weather control to a great extent obviously the pentagon has been obsessed with it since
[49:25.380 --> 49:31.000]  the 40s they've been able to make a country bone dryer flooded since the 60s certified
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.800]  stanford research project creating hurricanes killing hurricanes strengthening hurricanes
[49:36.800 --> 49:40.720]  and matt i'll probably take a clip of this and say look he says they can control hurricanes
[49:40.720 --> 49:47.040]  and then they play a laugh track in the background this is how dumb they think you and your family
[49:47.040 --> 49:56.320]  are this is how mindless the system thinks you are and then they come out with i mean
[49:56.320 --> 50:00.120]  i can't even count them all it's got to be over 100 articles huffington post washington
[50:00.120 --> 50:08.080]  post everywhere else madhouse shames republicans and info awards conspiracy ist alex jones
[50:08.080 --> 50:12.360]  after alex jones pushes oklahoma weather weapon theory drudge continues to promote and that's
[50:12.360 --> 50:17.240]  white house media matters because my talking point which is the truth are killing these
[50:17.240 --> 50:22.400]  people politically alex jones pushes tornado truther theory there's weather weapon stuff
[50:22.400 --> 50:27.080]  going on yeah and then i said there's stuff going on so you never know maybe they inadvertently
[50:27.080 --> 50:30.240]  with all the geoengineering are screwing up the weather and then when it is screwed up
[50:30.240 --> 50:37.960]  they go oh pay us carbon taxes we'll fix it alex jones i'm 100 sure obama sent the tornado
[50:37.960 --> 50:44.440]  truther to destroy oklahoma i mean this is the type of bs they put out you just knew
[50:44.440 --> 50:52.000]  there would be tornado truthers didn't you so mad out will weather weapon finally drive
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.480]  gop away from alex jones yeah you're scared to death that the gop will actually become
[50:57.480 --> 51:02.920]  constitutional and end you people you're busy trying to kill this country ship all our jobs
[51:02.920 --> 51:07.620]  out open the borders up working with the republican leadership selling everybody out and you're
[51:07.620 --> 51:12.460]  scared to death because our message unifies everybody around common sense geoengineering
[51:12.460 --> 51:17.940]  governance and technology policy congressional research service i mean january 2nd this year
[51:17.940 --> 51:22.880]  i mean doesn't exist though you can watch the c-span hearings with k bailey hutchinson
[51:22.880 --> 51:28.620]  that ran the committee on their weather manipulation of the u.s five billion bucks a year to spray
[51:28.620 --> 51:33.020]  aluminum dioxide over the u.s alone i mean you can look at a satellite photo type in
[51:33.020 --> 51:40.220]  chemtrail satellite photos of the u.s nasa reports were 21 to 32 percent darker on average
[51:40.220 --> 51:46.640]  globally because of condensation trails that's because they're adding barium salts aluminum
[51:46.640 --> 51:51.520]  dioxide to it they are doing something with the atmosphere they admit they're doing it
[51:51.520 --> 51:55.760]  but it remains classified and they're scared to death you know they mad out came out and
[51:55.760 --> 52:01.200]  attacked me years ago and i said bisphenol a five years ago is sterilizing you and increasing
[52:01.200 --> 52:06.200]  breast cancer and they came out on msnbc a bunch of shows and said he's crazy he says
[52:06.200 --> 52:12.560]  the juice boxes are making you gay now i said the runoff of bisphenol a is making amphibians
[52:12.560 --> 52:18.420]  and fish have both sexual organs and you may think it's cute that's skyrocketing in humans
[52:18.420 --> 52:22.700]  but kids are growing up with two different sets of genitalia and you're like oh alex
[52:22.700 --> 52:28.060]  is being mean to the to the uh to the you know androgynous community now no they're
[52:28.060 --> 52:37.540]  doing this to us and it's wrong it reminds me of uh the end of omega man and so you know
[52:37.540 --> 52:43.100]  a remake really of the last man on earth with uh benson price where he's got the cure he's
[52:43.100 --> 52:47.680]  like here i've got it and they're like no we've already been transformed and now we're
[52:47.680 --> 52:54.140]  going to kill you and they don't and i don't care what you're doing sexually but do you
[52:54.140 --> 53:00.920]  want your brain actually altered and the cancer that comes with it oh american scientist assessing
[53:00.920 --> 53:08.080]  risk of bisphenol a but see i helped ram that out into the public consciousness they're
[53:08.080 --> 53:12.780]  mad at me i can change the agenda because of my audience and our friends in the real
[53:12.780 --> 53:17.820]  media they don't like that they want to keep putting hydrofluoro salicic acid in your water
[53:17.820 --> 53:22.760]  that's killing all of us on record harvard studies you name it they want to continue
[53:22.760 --> 53:26.380]  they don't want you to know the juice boxes have got bisphenol a they don't want that
[53:26.380 --> 53:34.040]  taken out they don't want flame retardant taken out of the gatorade that we exposed
[53:34.040 --> 53:38.460]  they don't want you to figure out you can take the country back now let's go to what
[53:38.460 --> 53:45.060]  rachel maddow is so upset about and then tying all the other real stuff we've pointed out
[53:45.060 --> 53:52.800]  to something we didn't say we're going to go to maddow and then we'll go to mr whitehouse
[53:52.800 --> 53:58.980]  the senator so here is rachel maddow trying to tell conservatives libertarians what you
[53:58.980 --> 54:04.360]  can and can't look at and remember they said the amnesty bill doesn't have felons being
[54:04.360 --> 54:08.080]  let off which it does and it doesn't let them bring in their families which the bill did
[54:08.080 --> 54:14.680]  they lie to you they think you're stupid they hate you let's go to this clip two things
[54:14.680 --> 54:18.740]  happened recently that are related they do not seem related at first but trust me they
[54:18.740 --> 54:23.540]  are related so stick with me here the first thing is a small piece of one of the planes
[54:23.540 --> 54:28.240]  that was used on 9 11 being found wedged in a narrow alleyway not far from ground zero
[54:28.240 --> 54:31.120]  now at first it was reported to be part of the landing gear from one of those planes
[54:31.120 --> 54:36.200]  we learned it actually came from under one of the wings so that was thing number one
[54:36.200 --> 54:40.220]  just a couple of days later thing number two republicans on the house oversight committee
[54:40.220 --> 54:45.200]  held a joint hearing on the amount of ammunition the department of homeland security has on
[54:45.200 --> 54:49.040]  hand see because if the federal government has more bullets than the general population
[54:49.040 --> 54:52.380]  how are we going to defend ourselves in the fight against the government can't let the
[54:52.380 --> 54:55.900]  government get the upper hand in the weapons race right next thing you know they'll have
[54:55.900 --> 55:00.600]  like a standing army and bombs that can take out whole cities and stuff so yes republicans
[55:00.600 --> 55:09.200]  pause she gets off on that power that's designed and pointed at other nations the icbms the
[55:09.200 --> 55:13.400]  all that by the way they're now starting to point those tanks and stuff at us that's the
[55:13.400 --> 55:17.800]  whole point eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex our founders did
[55:17.800 --> 55:23.520]  and you try to make it a cynical joke associated with an airplane part i've never talked about
[55:23.520 --> 55:28.520]  let's continue with someone reading off a white house written script literally this
[55:28.520 --> 55:34.600]  is state-run media here it is the senate followed up the ammo thing with an actual bill an actual
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.960]  piece of legislation that's supposed to prevent the government from buying too many bullets
[55:39.960 --> 55:45.400]  yes this is the same federal government that already stockpiles say abrams tanks and armed
[55:45.400 --> 55:51.560]  drones and giant intercontinental again that can carry new this is homeland security a
[55:51.560 --> 55:56.520]  new fifth branch of the military training to take on the tea party while the irs harasses
[55:56.520 --> 56:01.860]  everybody and harasses pro-lifers and grabs their bank accounts you people are terrorizing
[56:01.860 --> 56:06.680]  the daylights out of us with black uniformed police everywhere trying to intimidate us
[56:06.680 --> 56:11.240]  and we say hey you're our government stop it and you run around trying to say it isn't
[56:11.240 --> 56:16.020]  happening you witch you're going to go to nuremberg trial because you guys are going
[56:16.020 --> 56:19.120]  to commit your crimes i know you're going to try a hot takeover and let me tell you
[56:19.120 --> 56:22.960]  man now you're going to be in the dock at the new nuremberg if you get your way back
[56:22.960 --> 56:27.200]  off now witch you really want to sign on to this takeover because you're going to fail
[56:27.200 --> 56:32.320]  no matter what happens to me when this country gets taken back you're not going to run to
[56:32.320 --> 56:38.240]  europe let's go back to her weapons all that yes but it's an excess of bullets that congressional
[56:38.240 --> 56:46.220]  republicans have decided is the really worrying firepower that was again uh homeland security
[56:46.220 --> 56:50.880]  paid for two million dollars worth of paper targets of five-year-old children to shoot
[56:50.880 --> 56:55.160]  called no more hesitation you're training for us she tries to go well the government's
[56:55.160 --> 56:59.800]  got nuclear missiles and all this stuff that is controlled by congress and aimed at other
[56:59.800 --> 57:07.040]  countries and that's gotten out of see i mean man it's it's so incredible just let's go
[57:07.040 --> 57:12.640]  back to the club here it is crazy so out there that even the national rifle association wouldn't
[57:12.640 --> 57:17.360]  touch it with a 10-foot rifle and yes the conspiracy theory about the government having
[57:17.360 --> 57:22.800]  too many bullets is nuts but it's not out of nowhere that conspiracy theory comes from
[57:22.800 --> 57:27.520]  the mother of all conspiracy theories that can seduce republicans it's an internet talk
[57:27.520 --> 57:32.280]  show called info wars yes this is the same guy who has been selling the idea that the

[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:30.000]  jones all right folks if you just joined us america is really starting to wake up to the
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.060]  fact that the federal government is trying to scare and persecute people libertarians
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:43.080]  conservatives you name it uh yeah the homeland security documents for the last four years
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:49.480]  five years that we've broke and covered that nauseum they're they're training to shoot
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.120]  guys in john deere hats with paper targets and five-year-old kids that's what homeland
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:59.560]  security wants in the you know in the targets they pay for and the manual say your new enemy's
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:03.920]  not al-qaeda it's gun owners it's libertarians it's returning veterans and that's now all
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:10.920]  been mainstream news it's taken me five years almost just to get people to even look at
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.520]  all the training manuals that started coming out as soon as obama got in and i mean you're
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.880]  sitting here reading this stuff where they're preparing for war with you they're buying
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.840]  thousands armored vehicles they're publicly training billions of bullets and then rachel
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:27.880]  maddow goes out and laughs and says republicans don't listen to alex and then now they're
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.880]  having congressional hearings a couple years later they've been trying to suppress this
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:35.960]  and now they're coming out just desperately lying the white house is the white house you
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:41.660]  know writes the media matter stuff saying that i said obama sent the tornado i was just
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:45.800]  answering callers questions saying yeah they've got weather modification you know here's national
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.920]  geographic here's associated press but this is probably a real tornado i'm disagreeing
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:56.080]  with the person but nicely and using it as a way to illustrate but there is massive weather
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.960]  modification going on so maybe inadvertently with all this modification going on you know
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.120]  maybe it's making less tornadoes because it's been less the last 60 years usa today reported
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:10.080]  you guys print me that again please obviously that's a conspiracy theory but that's what
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.220]  noah says and then i was on a talk show and they said you mean the guy with the big white
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:20.720]  beard yeah that's that's not the national weather national oceanic weather administration
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.720]  or what's it stand for i don't know maybe that doesn't exist either i made that up i
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:34.380]  said they got a weather modification bureau in congress maybe noah doesn't exist it's
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:41.500]  like it's crazy that that they're lying this much to people and twisting things and that
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:48.160]  they're worried about info wars dot com and i guess they should be worried i went for
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:57.680]  a exercise this morning to the local park and every person i've got to start just because
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:03.840]  it takes my time up i've got to start wearing even when i wear a hat and glasses people
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:12.720]  recognize my gorilla walk um every person i walked by said they were a listener every
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:19.360]  person i only walked by about 10 people every person was stopping me and trying to shake
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:24.080]  my hand the new world order is in deep trouble if a little old me has reached this many people
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.300]  and i don't know where the numbers are because it shouldn't be that many for the audience
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:34.600]  we have we have a big audience but it shouldn't be that that and about three of them three
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.840]  of the people were like i love that piers morgan thing that's my favorite deal not that
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:44.460]  piers morgan's big but that it aired everywhere and every tv radio everybody covered that
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:49.960]  it was a huge news event one of the biggest stories of the year so far and that's why
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.600]  they're so upset and that's why they're so scared because they're spying on everything
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:56.380]  they know the numbers they know how the audience is tuning in i don't know why it's so big
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:01.320]  i don't i can't actually find numbers that high because you'd think as many people that
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:07.480]  know the show and listen to it that i mean it's like 100 million people or something
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:14.240]  i i've but i don't know i can't find those numbers i guess it's kind of like youtube
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:17.920]  and all the rest of it firing bullets that ricochet forever kind of like at star wars
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.240]  instead of the trash compactor it just keeps bouncing around i think that's what it is
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:26.000]  is there's just so much stuff out there so much i've said and then people see stuff i
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.680]  did 10 years ago they're like well that all came through i think i just answered my own
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.980]  question the thing is it's really creepy but i'm just trying to gauge why the white house
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:41.240]  is attacking us every day now through their surrogates and they're doing it because we
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:46.400]  know what they're up to and we know and we're teaching people not to trust them and we're
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.320]  teaching people they're criminals and we're teaching people they're tyrants and obama's
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:55.220]  like there's no tyranny don't look trust me hand in the guns never mind the army i'm building

[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:16.640]  was drought or food delivered to our gas tanks or our food sold to other countries or food

[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:40.540]  getting smarter and more aware every day and now the collective of individuals is watching
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:50.020]  everything you do and distaining you and exposing you and you are hemorrhaging out your ratings
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:55.500]  are you are a shadow of the shadow of the shadow you're over you're done no amount of
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:00.300]  stage shootings no amount of nukes going off in chicago to be blamed on patriot groups
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:07.620]  no amount of false flags will put humpty dumpty back together again okay now she goes on i'm
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:11.620]  i already played part of this but in the interest of time so so she says that i say sandy hook
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:15.460]  didn't even happen that's not what i say i say it needs to be investigated because there's
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:19.420]  evidence that they stood down and let the guy attack and they tried to blame american
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.980]  gun owners for what happened just like senator whitehouse said midwesterners not paying carbon
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.500]  taxes are causing the rest of the country to have problems and that they don't want
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:34.820]  to bail out oklahoma as if oklahomans are bad people because they're in a red state
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:40.820]  okay this is what's going on this is what's happening they're desperate and so they come
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:46.740]  out and say we just played it in the interest of time the full video is up on infowars.com
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:51.700]  that i said giant wasp aliens live under the they'll probably edit that out and say i said
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:55.460]  that i did not say that i did not say the hurricane was sent by obama or the tornado
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:59.820]  was sent by obama callers asked me and i said there are weather weapons which are all over
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:04.940]  the news and last hour i showed you like 10 different mainstream news articles national
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:11.260]  geographic daily mail congressional record so so first they said on tuesday and wednesday
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:16.980]  that there's no weather weapons i'm a kook then they went to saying that that i said
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:21.100]  obama sent the tornado and that how dare republicans because they know because they're all they
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:26.100]  get white house talking points my talking points of just research and reality now via
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:31.940]  drudgereport.com and other places and the syndicated show and the internet infowars.com
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:36.060]  people are now going okay there's congressmen listening right now their constituents are
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:42.220]  listening fm-39.40 internment resettlement operations for in the u.s. how to put you
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:48.020]  in a fema camp how to re-educate you let's have hearings about this let's have hearings
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:54.820]  about the ran corporation plan for a national stability occupation force under un that reports
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:15:03.140]  right here you don't want to discuss that do you so let's go ahead and go to the rest
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:09.500]  of the maddow clip where she lies to her audience plays a clip of me saying yeah we don't know
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:13.980]  if government did it because they've got the power to do it one thing out of context and
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:17.780]  then lies to her audience because she thinks you're an idiot here it is the massacre at
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:23.440]  aurora colorado were actually fake they were faked as an excuse to take away our guns and
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:28.540]  enslave us to the giant wasps who hide beneath the un building or whatever it's the same
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:32.860]  guy who says the boston bombing was also fake it was faked for political purposes the same
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:36.860]  guy who says he doesn't believe the columbia space shuttle disaster actually happened doesn't
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:40.940]  believe there was actually an oklahoma city bombing naturally of course he also knows
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:48.540]  and sells the idea that 911 was an inside job i covered the san francisco chronicle
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:55.100]  that reported the fbi coming and seizing a video that i got shot on his mead telescope
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:59.020]  of a laser beam because a laser beam has got to be on for a while they're not powerful
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:04.860]  enough yet just one burst at least the ones we've seen it's coming in for it's still up
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:11.540]  in space it's coming in over the west coast it's over california it goes over novada a
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:17.580]  guy in novada films the laser beam shooting because he wanted to film it coming in because
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:21.380]  it's above the earth so the edge of the sun hits even though it's dark you can see it
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:24.500]  i've seen the space shuttle and i was like okay it's coming over now let's go out and
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:28.700]  look at it it's a clarinet we used to go out to the desert when i was a kid and you know
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:32.380]  you watch watch space shuttle come over you can see it you see space stations you name
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:37.360]  it next she'll say there's no space stations because she thinks you're dumb and the guy
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:43.900]  saw a green laser and filmed it and the fbi rated him and took it i just reported on that
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:49.100]  so they said that i now i the space shuttle doesn't even exist according to her that's
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:54.740]  how dumb they think you are see everything she says is a lie i didn't say there's giant
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:59.460]  wasp under the building i didn't say that the space shuttle didn't ever happen i didn't
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:07.980]  say that sandy hook and all that didn't happen oklahoma city didn't happen i mean this this
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:13.740]  is the most desperate flailing i've ever seen to try to get republicans to stop looking
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:17.940]  into what we're covering if it's discrediting republicans so good you should encourage them
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:25.260]  to keep looking into what i'm saying by the way of the it's confirmed associated press
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:31.940]  and reuters the two fbi agents involved in the anti-terrorism team with the bombing that
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:36.820]  were there when the bombing happened in the drill they're the ones that died earlier in
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:41.820]  the week in that other drill and then i told you the witnesses of the friends of the brothers
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:45.060]  would start dying and you notice we're not going to say why he was under questioning
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:50.220]  shot in the head it's all you need to know i told you that they this is a botched deal
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:53.100]  folks they're running scared and if they're ever going to kill me over something it'd
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:57.820]  be the loss of bombing because that was a drill a stand down saudi arabians being flown
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:02.220]  out that the white house secretly meeting with people that i mean they got caught lying
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:07.600]  about that they're desperate let's go back to this clip here it is of a madhouse that
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:14.220]  must be faked too the conspiracy continues in every tragedy the info wars alex jones
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:19.780]  world thinks they see a conspiracy monday's devastating record-breaking tornado in more
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:25.420]  oklahoma killed two dozen people and flattened a community just devastating devastating and
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:29.460]  what does he do but now i'm not kidding these same conspiracy theory folks are peddling
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:38.300]  the idea that the tornado was a conspiracy as well seriously the tornado was a conspiracy
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:42.080]  and you know tornadoes are way down of course they of course they lie and say they're way
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:48.000]  up to try to get carbon taxes uh but um i don't know if this was a weather weapon or
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:55.520]  not but they can with the right weather uh conditions they can create and steer uh groups
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:01.140]  of tornadoes did people 50 miles out as these storm systems and they see aircraft in and
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:05.840]  around the clouds spraying and doing things if you saw that you better bet your bottom
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:09.860]  dollar they did this uh but who knows if they did you know that's the thing
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:16.300]  who knows who knows if the u.s government uses a secret made-up weather weapon that
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:21.340]  only exists in the mind of yeah only existing congressional funding here's the other thing
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:26.180]  alex jones should be disqualified from participating in republican party politics his crackpot
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:30.460]  theories shouldn't prompt actual hearings in congress and they shouldn't inspire actual
[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:34.860]  legislation in congress and you shouldn't do a money bomb on his show when you are running
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:39.820]  for congress do not fundraise on this theater of the absurd by showing yourself to be one
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:46.380]  with this guy really he says the tornado was a conspiracy the tornado can we agree that

[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:33.060]  um but you know what alex you're waking people up you're bringing a lot of light to places that
[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:37.860]  haven't had light in in centuries really and people are and and the mainstream is getting
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:42.020]  freaked out and i you know you can't blame them people are waking up and that's what we're here to
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:48.900]  do and you're going to talk more conspiracy theory here you know i'm going to tell people uh you know
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:52.900]  why they don't need to have their brain removed i mean because brain cancer is up why not just
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:56.980]  preemptively have all our brains removed really if you got you got a cancer of the head chop your
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:01.220]  head off you know and that's that's not i'm not being facetious doctors will tell you if you got a

[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:17.780]  body human body doesn't know it's being operated on in a surgery in a in a uh operating theater
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:22.260]  it thinks it's being eaten by a lion and when you get your breasts hacked off it goes through
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:26.820]  the same stress response it would go through as if a wild animal were eating you the last thing
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:30.820]  you ever want to do is have a surgical procedure prophylactically or preventively you don't have
[01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:35.620]  a surgical procedure they told my grandmother to have her breasts removed like five years ago
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:41.860]  she didn't do it she's fine right now i tell you what stay there extremist stay there more evil
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:46.980]  straight ahead whatever you do don't listen to the show don't look at the boston bombing photos

[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:48.180]  sent me let's not exaggerate we have a document came over here guys it looks like 300 400 i don't
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:56.740]  know 500 pages of exhibits it's right over there it's right up there up in the corner yeah for tv
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:03.700]  viewers and we're going to go over all these exhibits that are over here okay so we're getting
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:08.980]  into the hardcore extremism that we shouldn't ask why breast cancer is up two to three thousand
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:13.780]  percent depending on the type leading the world in the u.s but the whole western world why
[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:19.780]  testicular cancer why pancreatic cancer why esophageal cancer why brain cancer
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:24.580]  well every cancer exploding cancers didn't exist exploding pediatric cancer is up 10,000 plus
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:31.300]  percent no one wants to discuss why these blessings these plagues are upon us the answer is
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:38.020]  hey you're predisposed to breast cancer they're now talking about at puberty having girls have
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:42.340]  them removed pretty soon you won't be able to live unless your head's in a special globalist
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:47.140]  tank that's the plan make things so deadly then they'll have something that keeps you alive but
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:50.740]  enslaved in their system and that's what Monsanto and all the globalists admit that's their medical
[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:54.340]  attorney model they know the vaccines are causing the gut flora problem bill millingate spend
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:37:00.100]  billions and patent to make money on medicalizing all that and then how to let you survive everybody's
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:04.020]  going to have irritable bowel everybody's going to have crones everybody's going to have it's the
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:09.380]  new freedom everybody's going to be mentally ill i'm sorry ben fuchs let's get into your exhibits
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:15.780]  here uh on uh angelina joe lee and they want four thousand dollars per woman with obamacare
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:22.980]  paid uh go ahead ben pharmacist ben fuchs yeah you know this whole thing with angelina joe lee
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:29.140]  is is really it's kind of like a poster child for the utter utter insanity of the modern medical
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:35.460]  model this is a woman who has a supposed genetic predisposition to breast cancer which by the way
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:40.820]  is the result of toxicities like cigarette smoking and drinking booze and who knows what other kind
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:46.500]  of crappy lifestyle both her and her mother were undergoing because the brca gene is mutate
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:52.980]  mutations occur uh secondary to maternal uh malnutrition when the baby is in the womb
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:58.740]  uh this is a woman who had her appendages lopped off her breasts lopped off in what is one of the
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:03.460]  most severe surgical procedures a human being can undergo all surgical procedures are severe but
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:09.780]  having a mastectomy is especially traumatic all in response to a mutation in her genetics that
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:15.700]  is secondary to a lifestyle lifestyle issues and this is again we have the same genetic lines
[01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:21.060]  we've always had they they're telling people this is how it is you have this it's going to happen
[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:26.740]  go on but but but but they know that it's when you go into this environment then it triggers that
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:30.500]  yes what they're not telling you is yeah the genetics are involved but the genetics are
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:35.380]  secondary to the environment this is what epigenetics is all about and doc wallach as
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:39.140]  a matter of fact has a book coming out here in another month or two about this whole idea of
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:44.740]  epigenetics that is nutritional and lifestyle factors that are transcendent to genetics epi
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:50.740]  meaning superior to or transcendent to this genetic model is a lie it's an insidious lie
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:55.060]  it is a lie that disempowers us and condemns us let's just find it like this let's say
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:39:01.700]  you get so many replications in the dna in your cell structure and because of space rays toxins
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:07.380]  the environment say two thousand years ago in central you know italy or as an example very long
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:12.340]  of people even then let's say you were women were living as 85 or so if they didn't die when they
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:16.820]  were young people actually live longer than just that more children die but if you live past 10
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:21.140]  you know and people can look at these statistics i know you know them pharmacist ben fuchs but if
[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:27.220]  you have that going on then sure you're you're predisposed genetically to get a breast cancer
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:33.460]  when it's mutated so many times the cell has split so many times that finally it then uh you
[01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:37.700]  know generates the mutation and then your body doesn't have the vitamins and minerals and nutrients
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:42.260]  there to deal with it so it replicates takes you over because only the mutating cells can live in
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:47.220]  that environment now because you're winding down but instead they go oh no all the kids are getting
[01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:52.900]  cancer because the bad genes no it's the radiation it's the food it's the garbage the gmo you know
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:57.540]  these rats didn't have bad genetics that can fed gmo and get all these tumors they don't say that
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:02.820]  there they know it's the gmo it's the end you hit the nail on the head with the word environment
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:08.100]  alex it's the environment that the genes are in the genetics are nothing more than a blueprint
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:12.580]  that is reflective to the biochemical environment of the body the biochemical and the environment
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:18.980]  of the body is secondary to nutrition to food to emf electromagnetic frequencies there's all kinds
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:26.260]  of factors that are uh they conspire to uh change our body's genetics it's not the genetics that
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:31.380]  count it's what is causing the genetic changes and that is where we have control and that's why for
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:37.460]  the last 25 years i've been preaching the gospel of good nutrition alex there is nothing more
[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:43.460]  powerful on a physical level for changing the way we are changing our biology changing our biochemistry
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:48.100]  than the kind of nutrients we're getting we're the kind of nutrients we're not getting is almost 74
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:55.620]  years old he looks like he's 55 and you look like a kindle well i well i've been using practicing
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:41:00.580]  what i preach for uh uh 25 30 years i've been using nutritional strategies i'm in the skincare
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:07.940]  business my the point is alex 75 percent of our health care costs are caused by chronic degenerative
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:14.260]  diseases that are unnecessary we don't need to be subjected to chronic degenerative diseases if we
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:18.820]  understand how our bodies work if we understand how to take care of our bodies and the key
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:23.140]  component all of this is nutrition and truth and in my opinion nutritional supplementation now
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:27.540]  there's a mental aspect there's a spiritual aspect there's an emotional aspect that have to take
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:33.300]  uh that we have to take into consideration but physical standpoint nutritional supplementation
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:39.860]  good nutrition and food is key and when i say food i mean not cooperating not being complicit
[01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:45.140]  in eating the corporate swill this is so so important wait wait you're being an extremist
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:50.980]  right now you're saying mcdonald's and others uh we have a mcdonald's in the airport at dia how
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:56.500]  in the world can mcdonald's have the lines that it has is beyond me i was looking at the folks
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:42:01.220]  who are lining up to get hamburgers lining up to get their cheeses is addictive French fries they
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:05.700]  might as well be lining up for tickets to Auschwitz they might as well well be lining up for tickets
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:11.540]  to the gas chamber they might as well be lining up for uh to to to participate in obamacare and
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:17.940]  to participate in the modern medical model we cannot accept business as usual when it comes
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:21.140]  to the foods that we're eating when it comes to the corporate foods that we're eating when it
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:25.780]  comes to the fear think of the fear with angelina jolie food when it comes to participating in the
[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:28.380]  in the mainstream model of health and welfare.
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:31.500]  We have to take our health, our welfare,
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:33.020]  into our own account.
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:35.060]  We have to take our family's health and welfare
[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:35.940]  into our own account.
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:38.140]  We have to take responsibility, and it begins,
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:40.140]  number one, with the kind of foods that we're eating,
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:42.060]  and number two, with the kind of nutritional supplements
[01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:43.500]  that we're taking.
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:46.140]  Yeah, and I heard your Skype, or whatever it is,
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:47.900]  renegotiate, and I think your computer flipped
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:49.740]  to internal microphone.
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:52.740]  You probably want to check that, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:55.000]  I think you went off your headset, something happened there,
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.100]  so let's check that for a moment,
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:43:00.660]  but you sent me just hundreds of pages of news articles
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:02.500]  that I want to go through, so if you have those,
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:04.560]  you always prepare so much for the show.
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:09.060]  I want to talk about the exhibits that you sent us.
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:12.300]  And again, this is not our opinion, folks.
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:14.300]  Cancer and these degenerative diseases
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:17.240]  are skyrocketing in the Western world.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.180]  Anywhere globalists are giving people GMO
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:22.260]  and putting fluoride in the water,
[01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:24.580]  and we know it's doing it.
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:28.420]  So they're going to hoax it and say, it's your genetics.
[01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:31.580]  Well, yeah, it's kind of like if you have genetics
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:33.820]  where if you eat the wrong kind of cholesterol,
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:34.860]  you're going to have a heart attack,
[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:36.980]  don't eat the wrong kind of cholesterol.
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:38.820]  But it's not like, we're going to remove your heart
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:41.260]  because your dad died at 50 of a heart attack
[01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:43.140]  and you're predisposed to a heart attack,
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:45.220]  so we're going to remove your heart.
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:47.100]  You're like, well, you'd die.
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:48.980]  But see, the doctors, whenever they can hack off
[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:50.860]  to get money, they will.
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:52.020]  And it's one thing to have something removed
[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:54.140]  if you have cancer in it, okay?
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:57.620]  But the issue here is that we are being poisoned.
[01:43:57.620 --> 01:43:59.340]  Did we get his audio back?
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:00.220]  Yeah, yeah, I'm back.
[01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:02.140]  Okay, so what would you have done
[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:04.100]  if you were Angelina Jolie?
[01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:05.700]  I would, first of all, quit smoking.
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:06.900]  That's the number one thing to do.
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:09.620]  I mean, if you want to assure yourself of participation
[01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:11.460]  in the medical model, go smoke cigarettes.
[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:12.740]  She happens to be a chain smoker,
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:14.760]  only God knows how much alcohol she's drinking
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:15.600]  on top of that.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:18.580]  And by the way, Angelina Jolie is only 36 or 37 years old.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:20.460]  She don't look very good.
[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:24.900]  And I don't want to pile on Angelina Jolie.
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:26.740]  The poor woman just went through a severe surgery.
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:29.780]  But the fact of the matter is if we begin
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:32.140]  to take care of ourselves vis-a-vis nutrition,
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:34.860]  vis-a-vis exercise, vis-a-vis not participating
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:36.260]  and eating the corporate swill,
[01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:38.620]  if we start to participate in a healthy spiritual,
[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:40.620]  mental, and emotional lifestyle as well,
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:44.380]  we do not, we will not have to participate
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:45.260]  in the medical model.
[01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:47.300]  And that should be our number one goal.
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:49.540]  Alex, we can't fight the New World Order
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:51.620]  if we're suffering from colon disease.
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:53.180]  We can't fight the New World Order
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:54.700]  if we have autoimmune disease.
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:56.180]  We can't fight the New World Order
[01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:58.940]  if we have heartburn and we're throwing up
[01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:02.420]  every time we eat, after every meal we eat.
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:04.260]  And this is the kind of health condition
[01:45:04.260 --> 01:45:05.660]  many Americans are dealing with.
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:08.380]  75% of our healthcare costs,
[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:09.840]  three quarters of our healthcare costs,
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:11.980]  over a trillion dollars is spent
[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:14.100]  on chronic degenerative disease,
[01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:16.580]  which in many ways is optional
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:19.700]  because it's secondary to lifestyle choices.
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:21.700]  And this is the message that I've been talking about
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:22.900]  for the last 25 years.
[01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:23.740]  This is the one-
[01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:24.960]  Okay, well you sent me like 50 news articles.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:26.220]  Let's run through these
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:27.760]  because you've obviously got them too.
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:30.260]  Let's go through these different articles.
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:31.380]  Where do you want to start first?
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:33.440]  Let's start off with dementia and drug companies.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.280]  I love this one.
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:38.000]  Big Pharma is now trying to profit off Alzheimer's disease
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.020]  by coming up with drugs that are supposed to help people
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:42.980]  with what is, at the end of the day,
[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:45.300]  a degenerative disease that's secondary
[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:47.580]  to how we live our lives.
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:49.820]  Go down to the fourth story, one, two, three, four.
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:52.780]  Eating less may slow down progression of dementia.
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:55.540]  Alex, if you had to pick one single strategy
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:58.500]  to increase your longevity
[01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:01.420]  and decrease the likelihood of degenerative diseases,
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:03.860]  it would be to simply eat less-
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:04.740]  Well, let me stop you there.
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:07.300]  They've known for 30 years that they feed rats
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:10.180]  high-nutrient, near-starvation diets.
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:11.660]  They live two, three times longer.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:13.780]  And different species of worms,
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:16.060]  they've had them live eight times longer.
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:18.980]  By using nutrients and by reducing calories.
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:20.940]  And by the way, that's what the elite's all doing,
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:22.340]  but we're not supposed to do it.
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:25.100]  We're supposed to go get our colons chopped out.
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:27.340]  By the way, the elite get nutrients
[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:29.660]  stuck in their veins intravenously.
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:30.700]  They don't mess around.
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:32.980]  They put IV nutrients in.
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:35.260]  If we really cared about health in this country,
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:36.900]  we would have national-
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:38.740]  Oh yeah, all the real expensive clinics,
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:39.660]  because they're here in Austin,
[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:41.380]  and I know rich people that go to them
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:44.060]  that are like 65, look like they're 30.
[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:46.340]  I mean, I'm just not a medical guy, so I don't do it.
[01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:47.980]  That's what they get is vitamin C
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:49.740]  and all these nutrient bags.
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:50.580]  It's amazing.
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:52.700]  Yeah, yeah, just shooting it, yeah.
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:56.100]  We've known for 50 or 60 years
[01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:59.380]  that the less calories we eat, the longer we live.
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:03.020]  But we have an economy, an economic system,
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:04.820]  that runs on food.
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:06.660]  There's a really cool book called Empires of Food
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:09.100]  that talks about the history of food,
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:11.900]  how food, how empires throughout history
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:15.300]  have been built on consumption of calories.
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:17.060]  That's why it is up to us,
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:19.300]  because the empire is not going to tell us this.
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:21.060]  The empire depends on us eating
[01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:22.540]  like it's going out of style.
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:24.740]  We have to start to participate
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:25.620]  in some of these strategies,
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:27.060]  and one of the easiest things we could do
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:28.700]  is reduce caloric intake.
[01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:29.900]  I don't know if you have this article up.
[01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:32.820]  Reducing caloric intake delays nerve cell loss.
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:37.380]  You know, I don't, because I was given these in big stacks.
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:39.980]  The stack one, stack two, right through.
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:40.820]  Which stack are you talking about?
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:43.860]  This is on stack four, article four.
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:47.100]  Stack four, article four, dementia, big pharma.
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:48.980]  You have a document, Cam, guys.
[01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:49.820]  Go ahead.
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:51.740]  See where it says that dementia and drug companies,
[01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:53.860]  article four, eating less may slow down
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:55.380]  progression of dementia.
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:56.700]  And I just happened to find this article.
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:58.180]  This came out a couple of days ago.
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:00.620]  But there are literally dozens of these articles
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:04.460]  that talk about the power of eating less calories.
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:07.260]  If you want to make a statement to the New World Order,
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:08.500]  make it this way.
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:11.380]  Don't eat so many calories.
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:15.340]  And how do you restrict yourself from calories with ease?
[01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:17.700]  Get yourself on a nutritional supplement program.
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:19.460]  Get on the Beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:21.460]  Watch what happens to your appetite.
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.020]  As you start to put supplements,
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:24.860]  as you start to put nutrition into your body,
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:27.380]  you will naturally wean yourself off of calories,
[01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:30.880]  and there is no faster way to improve your longevity,
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:34.180]  increase your lifespan, improve the symptoms
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:37.900]  of degenerative disease than to eat less calories.
[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:40.080]  There was another, right after that article,
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.380]  there's another one that came out a couple of days ago
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:45.140]  about lecithin and eggs.
[01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:47.100]  Eggs are one of the most powerful foods
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:48.360]  a human being can eat.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:50.820]  In fact, I'd go so far as to say as far as whole foods go,
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:55.820]  there is no whole food more powerful and more benign
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:49:00.020]  and non-toxic than the humble, simple little egg.
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:02.460]  Yet we're told, to this day we're told,
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:04.540]  not to eat eggs, not to eat a lot of eggs,
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:06.040]  not to eat the yolks of eggs.
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:07.380]  This article came out a couple days ago
[01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:09.300]  talking about lecithin in eggs.
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:13.420]  Lecithin is a high-powered nutritional-like ingredient
[01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:15.240]  that's very important for brain health.
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:17.740]  If you want to protect yourself from Alzheimer's disease,
[01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:19.940]  eat eggs, and a lot of them.
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:22.100]  And by the way, because lecithin is very important
[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:24.940]  for the absorption of fats and fatty vitamins and minerals,
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:27.820]  if you want to protect your heart, eat eggs.
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:30.700]  And this gets us to the whole cholesterol idea.
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:31.620]  You there, Alex?
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:32.620]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:36.060]  Okay, now there's a, I sent you an article on,
[01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:37.100]  I don't think I sent you this one,
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:38.700]  there's new, do you know there's a new class
[01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:40.220]  of cholesterol drugs coming out?
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:41.720]  They're not satisfied with the statins.
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.860]  Now they're going to have a super statin drug
[01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:46.060]  that comes out, a super high-powered-
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:47.300]  Well, I've talked to brain surgeons
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.580]  that have seen people on statins,
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:50.380]  it literally eats your brain.
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:53.180]  Because cholesterol is a key building,
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:57.660]  no, cholesterol is the key building substance in the body.
[01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:00.540]  It is the key anabolic substance in the body.
[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:02.500]  Alex, you know what makes a vegetable different
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.140]  from a human being or an animal?
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:05.900]  The fact that we can move.
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:08.380]  And vegetables don't make cholesterol,
[01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:11.340]  only human beings and animals make cholesterol.
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:13.940]  Because cholesterol is a vital compound
[01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:16.740]  for producing muscle, for producing movement,
[01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:20.080]  for producing action, for producing neural activity.
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:24.540]  Cholesterol is your biochemical of youth and growth.
[01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:27.340]  This sounds like the ravings of a fascist.
[01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:29.420]  Look at any biochemistry.
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:32.100]  No, you're evil, I mean, I don't want to hear
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:33.740]  scientific facts, it's extreme.
[01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:35.140]  There's no way the government and the media
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:37.420]  would not tell me this, they care about me.
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:38.820]  Right, you're doctor care.
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:41.940]  And plus, you're on a guy's show that Rachel Maddow says
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:44.660]  that we say wasp, alien wasp, run the planet.
[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:46.260]  So, of course it's not true,
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:49.000]  but she's on mainstream television, it must be.
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:53.420]  I think giant wasp made me run, Rachel Maddow.
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:55.500]  All right, folks, it's a joke, if you just tuned in,
[01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:58.780]  Rachel Maddow says that I say that aliens run the UN
[01:50:58.780 --> 01:50:59.980]  from an underground base.
[01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:03.180]  The government's Department of Homeland Security
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:04.820]  is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:07.340]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:09.140]  to own and purchase firearms.
[01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:10.860]  Can you put two and two together?

[01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:16.180]  including hollow points and.308 sniper rounds.
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:18.780]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:19.900]  But for how long?
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:24.820]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L,
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:26.500]  bodyarmor.com.
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:29.740]  Infidel body armor just won't quit.
[01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:32.500]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric,
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:34.360]  engraving embed strips and fibers
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:35.500]  to protect from counterfeit,
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:36.900]  then carting to a private bank,
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:38.340]  having it led back at interest,
[01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:39.940]  forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:41.820]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:44.160]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:46.000]  is a greater menace to the liberties of the people
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:46.980]  than a standing army?
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:49.060]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar

[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:17.520]  unfortunately you've grown up
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:21.920]  hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:24.240]  separate sinister entity that's
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:27.200]  at the root of all our problems
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:31.520]  some of these same most voices also do their best to come up the works
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:36.860]  they'll warn that tyranny is always working just around the corner
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:39.460]  you should reject these voices
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:43.760]  because what they suggest is that our brave and creative and unique experiment
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.040]  in self-rule is somehow just a sham
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:51.180]  with which we can't be trusted are there you go we can't be trusted he equates
[01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:54.700]  the people with the government he says it's your government that's what tyrants
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:57.040]  always say they say that north korea
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:00.360]  we watch government throughout history and in modern times doing horrible
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:04.120]  things everywhere always the most dangerous force always with special
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:09.080]  interests used to enslave always to destroy human liberty always to take
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:12.640]  health choices away always to dominate
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:14.600]  humans either ascend
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:19.400]  by what they do what they produce then you have an incredible civilizations
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:24.440]  where science and literature and beauty and honorableness is exalted and
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:26.200]  societies just excel
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:28.040]  then their kids become decadent
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.920]  their kids become evil
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:33.020]  and the cycle goes back into bondage
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:35.100]  and we're going into that right now but look
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:37.260]  i've seen my family and friends
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:39.520]  do the info words health dot com
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:41.080]  uh... routine
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:44.000]  with the longevity products with incredible results
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.080]  uh... i've only stuck my toe in just because i've never done i do about twenty
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:49.240]  percent of what i should
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:53.160]  and it has been revolutionize my brain my skin health
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:56.520]  i was like forty pounds and quit doing a lot of it going back on losing weight
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:57.160]  again
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:55:59.040]  i've been designed for weight loss
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:03.200]  but as a gardener i know this you have to plant rose bushes in a certain type
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.120]  of soil
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:06.200]  they have genetics
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:08.280]  just like humans
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:11.320]  you have to plant them in the right soil and then they have to have the right
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:14.800]  nutrients the right natural fertilizer or they'll die
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:19.640]  and doctor and i guess a botanist of a doctor of plants could say
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:24.960]  the roses are dying because they've mutated and their molting and uh... they
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:31.240]  are uh... you're not producing flowers and dying because they have bad genetics
[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:34.080]  no if the rose bush
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:37.740]  doesn't get the nitrogen and the things it needs the three or four things it
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:39.400]  needs the sunlight the water
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:41.280]  the nitrogen
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.080]  it's not going to grow
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:45.260]  and then it's going to become diseased
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:49.280]  as it just tries to keep its roots alive and then it's going to die
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:51.600]  and that's what's happening with humans
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:54.760]  and instead they go oh you're dying because of your genetics
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:59.400]  yes you're dying because your genetics are predisposed bathed in a radiation
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:02.960]  chamber eating gmo with its own pesticide in it
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:06.260]  the same thing happening why do they do test on rats
[01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:09.160]  and pigs because rats and pigs genetically
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:10.480]  with drugs
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:12.960]  respond the same as humans
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:15.720]  they don't do it on dogs they don't do it on whales
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:16.880]  they don't know
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:20.940]  pigs operate more like us than even a chimpanzee in many studies
[01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:22.760]  so they do it on pigs
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:26.600]  if you take bi... you know the hormone uh... a lot of people do uh...
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:27.800]  thyroid
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:30.280]  it's from a pig a lot of times
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:33.600]  and and folks they put pigs on this stuff and it kills them
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:37.980]  they know exactly what they're doing Ben Fuchs we're going to break here i'm going to keep you in the next hour but they know what
[01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:40.400]  they're doing don't they
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:43.320]  i'm not a genius i just read biochemistry books
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:45.980]  you know all this information everything i'm talking about is right on the
[01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:49.720]  internet if you look up PubMed or go to scholargoogle.com or pick up
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:52.240]  leninger's biochemistry or guidance biology
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:56.180]  uh... guidance pathology there's all kinds of... what about my rose bush analogy
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:57:58.480]  it's exactly the way it is you know what else
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:57:59.700]  the rose bush
[01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:03.960]  not only uh... will be unhealthy but the animals that eat the rose bush or they eat the
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:07.160]  vegetation or they eat the plants they'll be unhealthy as well and this is
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:07.980]  why
[01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:11.680]  today these days you can't get what you need from eating the four food groups you
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:15.120]  can't get what you need by simply eating food it's why you gotta get yourself on

[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:07.840]  other key points uh... that you wanted to get into today that are
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:11.420]  important for people to know i just hope everybody goes to mfortwortshealth.com
[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:13.880]  and bare minimum gets the polymers plus
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:16.620]  and the beyond tangy tangerine and the alex pack
[02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:18.940]  that has the osteo fx and other things i mean
[02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:22.720]  if they'll just do that they'll support us but that's number two
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:25.860]  number one they'll find out we're not we're not playing games here
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:28.680]  and it won't take very long alex that's one of the neat things about nutritional
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:30.320]  supplementation is
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:34.240]  the more you need the nutrients the faster those nutrients gets a get
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:36.060]  absorbed and that's why as you know
[02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:39.100]  when people start this thing when people start a nutritional supplement program
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:41.980]  when people start sipping on the beyond tangy tangerine for example it takes
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:43.440]  about twenty four hours for you
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:44.640]  even less sometimes
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:47.240]  for you to notice a difference and that's because the gift of the human
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:48.040]  body is
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:52.100]  the more deficient you are the faster nutrients get absorbed the sicker you
[02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:56.640]  are the faster you can turn it around but wait i mean i mean so people some
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:00.440]  people genetically are more predisposed to die quicker without water
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:03.820]  the answer is instead of giving somebody water a nutrient
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:04.420]  take their
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:06.040]  take their genes what take
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:07.720]  to hack off part of their body
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:10.920]  well that's the answer because it could just be a brain and they could live on less
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:11.920]  water
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:13.920]  so to give somebody a glass of water
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:16.640]  you know who they need genetically we just get rid of their brain
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:21.580]  i mean i think that sounds like the ratings of a fascist
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:23.180]  okay
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:26.140]  well i mean that's what angelina jolie did
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:27.460]  let me tell you something
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:28.860]  if anybody tells you
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:33.400]  that you have to have an organ removed because you have the genetics for cancer
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:37.540]  run don't walk out of that office run out of that office and never return
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:39.100]  there is no case
[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:43.380]  when you need to have an appendage or a limb or an organ removed
[02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:47.620]  simply because of genetic mandate because genetics are subject to
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:51.500]  epigenetics which means nutrition and which means a lifestyle well i'll tell
[02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:53.700]  you what's next they're already doing this in england
[02:02:53.700 --> 02:02:56.200]  they're saying well you're predisposed to cancer
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:59.380]  so you can't have children because we're socialist health care we're not gonna
[02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:00.180]  pay for it
[02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:02.280]  so you have government approval of
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:05.940]  of the uh... sperm in the egg and they're talking about government approval
[02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:08.260]  of the uh... zygote
[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:10.220]  and basically forced abortion
[02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:14.420]  alex this is why the founding fathers put medical freedom into the
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:18.900]  constitution this is why thomas jefferson and benjamin rush warned us
[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:23.420]  about health freedom they knew thomas jefferson said if if people left the
[02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:28.260]  government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take their
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:35.260]  bodies will soon be in a sorry estate as are the souls who live under tyranny and
[02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:38.960]  he said that two hundred and fifty years ago and benjamin rush and the other
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:42.380]  founding fathers at the same thing they knew good and well
[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:44.220]  it is the job
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:49.100]  of a of the government to disempower the people it is their job is the job of the
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:52.940]  state to take power away from the home on
[02:03:52.940 --> 02:03:53.700]  that
[02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:57.580]  sound like the ratings of a fascist
[02:03:57.580 --> 02:04:00.060]  and i'm a fascist if that's the case
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:01.480]  a big sarcastic
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:02.580]  uh...
[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:03.900]  he was talking about me
[02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:07.620]  uh... you know this is so crazy and so obvious
[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:10.400]  that if you don't
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:14.300]  yourself vitamin c your teeth will fall out of your head but now people are
[02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:16.220]  coming to hospitals with scurvy
[02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:19.820]  that eat fast food diets and stuff and they won't tell them why they're open
[02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:21.840]  sores and teeth falling out
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:23.260]  it's just it's insane
[02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:26.300]  well this is the whole idea of subclinical nutritional deficiency you
[02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:29.900]  know many of us are just walking around and we get sick all the time or we have
[02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:33.420]  asthma or we just don't feel as well as we should or we have problems sleeping
[02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:38.260]  and we don't have full blown out disease states we just don't feel as good as we
[02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:41.820]  have the right the god-given right to feel and it's because we're sub
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:46.140]  clinically deficient in these nutrients not bad enough to be dying in bed but
[02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:49.260]  bad enough to not be feeling as good as we should
[02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:53.940]  well there you go pharmacist ben fuchs he's on every hour uh... every day right

[02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:21.780]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements

[02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:22.100]  what is the secret of the universe info worth dot-com
[02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:29.020]  ladies and gentlemen we are now into the third hour I want to thank you all for
[02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:32.460]  joining us I have the former Minister of Defense from Canada coming on is
[02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:36.820]  speaking out about the New World Order in a Bilderberg group and others he has
[02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:40.220]  some other interesting theories it's not a theory about the Bilderberg group
[02:08:40.220 --> 02:08:43.380]  setting up world government their documents have been stolen leaked I've
[02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:47.860]  gotten them out of the National Archives that little loving moles have given me
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:52.220]  and we put out last year we're gonna be getting into all that at the bottom of
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:56.220]  the hour I personally am going to be going to England if they let me into the
[02:08:56.220 --> 02:09:00.300]  country and speak of the devil I've had multiple police call me wanting to talk
[02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:05.060]  to me from England one of them the deputy chief another the chief of a
[02:09:05.060 --> 02:09:08.900]  constabulary police in the area so I probably need to get around to calling
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:12.660]  them I just always get off the air and I don't call in the morning I'm too busy
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:17.020]  you know they're six hours ahead but you know they've the thousands are kept out
[02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:21.020]  I mean if you're a al-qaeda extremist you're you're let in you're given free
[02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:24.460]  welfare you're taken care of your you can threaten to kill people for eight
[02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:30.140]  years and be allowed to do it by the way we are saying that that is a real
[02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:35.220]  terror attack that happened yesterday or now a day and a half ago but the media
[02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:39.900]  is now saying that we said it wasn't real that's right Paul Watson put an
[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:47.740]  article in a video that went viral saying that it was not a a staged event
[02:09:47.740 --> 02:09:51.980]  they obviously knew about it and that's now come out which is pretty much the
[02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:54.380]  same thing I mean they bring in people that do this and then take everybody's
[02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:59.940]  rights but obviously it'll probably be on MSNBC tonight that I said that you
[02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:05.420]  know it was it was fake too I mean MSNBC now says that I believe giant
[02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:08.980]  wasp alien wasp live under the UN building I don't know where they're
[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:13.900]  getting that I never really cover UFOs but our next guest actually says there's
[02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:17.500]  evidence the government's covering that up so it's strange she's saying that
[02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:21.380]  then I've got him on but he's a prestigious guy speaks before the
[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:25.180]  Parliament now he was the deputy prime minister a bunch of other stuff so we'll
[02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:29.420]  we'll find out this is something we set up like a month ago what's going on with
[02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:34.900]  that but I'm sure Matt I will edit it all up and and put it out and and again
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:37.900]  the reason that's amazing is they're on record getting White House talking
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:42.060]  points and following media matters okay I've already talked about this at nauseum
[02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:46.120]  the video of it it's all up on info Wars calm here's some of the news on info

[02:12:48.180 --> 02:12:53.260]  humans within five to ten years and that means they've already got it ladies and
[02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:57.780]  gentlemen that's why they're so arrogant the people will believe what the media
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:02.740]  tells them to believe so said George Arwell aka Eric Blair that's just some
[02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:07.820]  of the news up on info Wars calm we'll look and see what Drudge is doing a
[02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:11.020]  little bit but let me let me go ahead and just get to this right now hey I
[02:13:11.020 --> 02:13:15.980]  meant to read this first hour I didn't get to it so three it now Fox News Roger
[02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:25.460]  Ailes letter to Fox employees your colleagues the recent news about the FBI
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:32.420]  seizure of the phone and email records of Fox employees including James Rosen
[02:13:32.420 --> 02:13:37.180]  calls into question whether the federal government is meeting its constitutional
[02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:42.740]  obligation to preserve and protect a free press in the United States well
[02:13:42.740 --> 02:13:45.700]  it's gonna soon be a conspiracy that there ever was a free press I mean
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:51.060]  everybody knows there wasn't all there are reeducation facilities but never
[02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:56.900]  mind that we reject the government's efforts to criminalize the pursuit of
[02:13:56.900 --> 02:14:01.700]  investigative journalism and falsely characterize a Fox News reporter to a
[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:08.540]  federal judge is a co-conspiracy a co-conspirator in espionage yeah and I
[02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:13.260]  added that part a federal judge is a co-conspirator in a crime but it's
[02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:18.300]  actually of espionage we're talking to a State Department official about what's
[02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:22.700]  your personal view on Kim Jong-un is he crazy enough to really test a nuke well
[02:14:22.700 --> 02:14:28.340]  I think so so they arrested him and he's now in jail I mean this is like saying
[02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:32.740]  you can't I mean and that's why I can't even get generals and colonels on now
[02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:35.980]  they say if they give their opinion about the weather they'll be arrested I
[02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:41.540]  mean well I've gotten so many documents we've put out I mean if the government's
[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:46.340]  doing something illegal you have a right to talk about it
[02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:50.460]  and the government is illegally spying on you so that to stop you from that
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:55.100]  this is out right I mean this is they're disappearing people he goes on to say
[02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:59.020]  Roger Ailes I know how concerned you are because there's so many of you have
[02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:04.980]  asked me why should the government make me afraid to use a work phone or email
[02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:10.860]  account to gain news or gather news or even call a friend or family member well
[02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:14.380]  they shouldn't have done it the administration's attempt to intimidate
[02:15:14.380 --> 02:15:19.500]  Fox News and its employees will not succeed and their excuses will stand
[02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:24.060]  neither the test of law the test of decency nor the test of time we will not
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:27.820]  allow a climate of press intimidation and I'm telling you the globalists are
[02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:30.980]  really asking for it because there's a lot of corrupt power blocks but they
[02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:33.260]  don't want they don't want to be slaves either you know they get that basic
[02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:36.900]  instinct that you know that the gravy train is going to end if they let one
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:42.620]  power one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them come into power
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:47.660]  we will not allow a climate of press intimidation unseen since McCarthy era
[02:15:47.660 --> 02:15:53.180]  McCarthy was a good guy folks I'm gonna explain that in a minute to frighten any
[02:15:53.180 --> 02:16:00.140]  of us away from the truth he was misled though I am proud of your tireless
[02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:04.860]  efforts to report the news over the last 17 years I stand with you I support you
[02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:09.540]  and I thank you for your reporting with courageous optimism too many Americans
[02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:14.820]  fought and died well this is the right type of talk finally really calling them
[02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:18.780]  out this is the only way to deal with tyrants folks is call them on it too
[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:21.580]  many Americans fought and died to protect our unique American right of
[02:16:21.580 --> 02:16:26.140]  press freedom we can't and we won't forget that be an American journalist
[02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:30.540]  it's not only a great responsibility but also a great honor to be a Fox
[02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:35.380]  journalist is a high honor not a high crime even this memo of support will
[02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:40.380]  cause some to demonize us and try to find irrelevant things to cause us to
[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:45.620]  waiver yeah like saying no one should listen to me and and and and that I'm
[02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:50.380]  insane and I mean they're scared folks we will not waiver see what's happened
[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:54.420]  is Fox and Glenn Beck and all of them they wouldn't cover this stuff but info
[02:16:54.420 --> 02:17:00.460]  wars.com this show my films and then Drudge super charging us like nitrous
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:05.620]  oxide at the key junctures with real reports he went and looked up at his
[02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:08.700]  crew looked up and found out we're accurate so they keep hurting them
[02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:12.180]  because it's true they've got FEMA camps it's true they're buying billions of
[02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:16.420]  bullets it's true their manuals say they're gonna arrest returning veterans
[02:17:16.420 --> 02:17:19.140]  and libertarians and conservatives and that we're the enemy and there's this
[02:17:19.140 --> 02:17:26.700]  coming war with us I mean these people are the radical dangerous folks and
[02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:31.340]  you've got to call it what it is to confront it yeah it's over-the-top yeah
[02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:36.300]  it sounds nuts to say what they're doing but they're the ones doing it it sounds
[02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:39.580]  crazy to say your neighbors got dead bodies in the back but if you've seen
[02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:43.660]  them and you know they're there you got to go call the police
[02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:49.420]  I mean I know why people don't want to believe this but it it's happened
[02:17:50.980 --> 02:17:54.540]  he goes on to say even this memo of support will cause some to demonize us
[02:17:54.540 --> 02:17:59.100]  and try to find irrelevant things to cause us to waver we will not waver see
[02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:03.100]  they get distractions or mad out desperately her body language is
[02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:09.640]  freaking out they're all freaking out right now as Fox News employees we
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:15.500]  sometimes are forced to stand alone but even then when we know we are reporting
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:19.660]  what is true and what is right we stand proud and fearless thank you for your
[02:18:19.660 --> 02:18:24.660]  hard work and all your efforts sincerely Roger Ailes and I know for a fact Roger

[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:37.300]  secretly at least 20 years ago was an anti New World Order guy I've talked to
[02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:42.860]  multiple people a bunch of them that knew him when he was younger and he is
[02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:46.820]  not a communist or a socialist and secretly doesn't like the New World

[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:57.420]  they're more opportunistic they're not like really hating America really hating
[02:18:57.420 --> 02:19:02.140]  families really hating men they just kind of halfway have gone along but now
[02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:06.220]  because they they brought out Benghazi and by the way it was our guest our

[02:19:13.980 --> 02:19:18.220]  between different power structures and the really nasty globalists that want to
[02:19:18.220 --> 02:19:23.100]  shut this country down are in charge at the White House and they are so freaked
[02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:29.900]  out that I've got their numbers they are so freaked out that that we've hit the

[02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:36.900]  is rising
[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:45.380]  the fortune I seek is liberty and a future for humanity you know I've
[02:24:45.380 --> 02:24:51.660]  dropped the ball today we did an investigative report last night with Rob
[02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:56.740]  Dew on the nightly news before I interviewed Pastor Chuck Baldwin in
[02:24:56.740 --> 02:25:02.940]  studio and they are killing FBI agents that were in and around the Boston
[02:25:02.940 --> 02:25:06.480]  bombing and when I first heard this two days ago I went I want to see that check
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:10.380]  their names and sure enough the hostage rescue team is the group they use to
[02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:15.060]  torch wake up the hostage rescue team is the key inside group that was at
[02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:21.620]  Oklahoma City with the ATF they are the internal group that does the black ops
[02:25:21.620 --> 02:25:25.380]  now I'm not saying these dead guys were involved because there's it's a large
[02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:31.700]  organization now but in the past these are the guys that do the deed and and
[02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:35.700]  that's what media kept saying to me and and and when Bloomberg's called her a
[02:25:35.700 --> 02:25:39.500]  bunch they're like you're saying the FBI did aren't you like he wanted me to say
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:43.100]  that I go well and this was even taped last week they were taping me and they've
[02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:47.580]  got it on tape I said it would be the hostage rescue team that's the group
[02:25:47.580 --> 02:25:51.900]  over and over again that that would that we've caught two of these guys that were
[02:25:51.900 --> 02:25:55.620]  at the Boston bombing and we're investigating it died and training
[02:25:55.620 --> 02:25:59.880]  accident and I gotta be honest I heard this for like a day and the articles
[02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:03.580]  were even out I'm like I don't believe that even though I knew they would do
[02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:07.180]  something like this I can't even believe it and then you've got
[02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:11.460]  Tamerlan's friend who they said they were shaking and I said like two weeks
[02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:16.020]  ago he's dead and then they even say because he told friends and family the
[02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:20.420]  questioning so I just meet with them they're not gonna hurt you he reportedly
[02:26:20.420 --> 02:26:24.420]  got agitated so they killed him but they're not gonna tell you details and
[02:26:24.420 --> 02:26:31.540]  but the officer the agent didn't need to go to the doctor but oh the most
[02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:36.980]  important part he confessed that he was involved first I mean no need to torture
[02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:41.700]  you into confessing in a courtroom now or threaten your family just you get
[02:26:41.700 --> 02:26:45.780]  shot in the head and then you confess folks if I ever get pulled over because
[02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:49.980]  they've got CIA and FBI inside police departments everywhere I mean you know
[02:26:49.980 --> 02:26:55.980]  they had that high-level CIA guy down in Houston that Wayne Madsen interviewed
[02:26:55.980 --> 02:27:01.500]  that Wayne Madsen knew and Wayne Madsen was going down interview but the point
[02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:04.680]  is is that they get him out of the car he steps out of the car the Houston
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:12.460]  cops draw shooting and and it's obviously an execution and this is how
[02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:17.260]  it is now I mean you don't just go directly to jail or to a gulag you're
[02:27:17.260 --> 02:27:21.380]  just you just they drop by and shoot you in the head and then there's not even an
[02:27:21.380 --> 02:27:24.580]  investigation you can have a helicopter of the guy getting out with his hands
[02:27:24.580 --> 02:27:31.540]  he's not reached for anything and it was Carnaby and you just shoot him
[02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:36.540]  look at this New York Times two FBI hostage rescue agents died in training
[02:27:36.540 --> 02:27:44.980]  exercise at sea and then we went and looked it up and sure enough they were
[02:27:44.980 --> 02:27:48.820]  involved investigating the Boston bombing that can get very unhealthy if
[02:27:48.820 --> 02:27:53.220]  you're not a bad person these guys were pretty young so I would guess they
[02:27:53.220 --> 02:27:55.820]  probably weren't corrupt even if you're corrupt it takes a while to prove
[02:27:55.820 --> 02:28:03.020]  yourself I'd say 10 years official Navy SEALs killed another injured
[02:28:03.020 --> 02:28:07.500]  in Arizona training exercise yeah shield team six every week some more of them
[02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:12.220]  die they crammed 20-something on a helicopter and then blew it up and then
[02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:16.580]  I talked to a Nate current active duty Navy SEAL who's I'm not gonna say
[02:28:16.580 --> 02:28:19.820]  anything else they can put it in the NSA thing and figure out off clues I give
[02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:24.860]  because that one that that that source hasn't been blown because he was smart
[02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:28.780]  enough to know where to come find me and tell me already said this they know it's
[02:28:28.780 --> 02:28:34.420]  it's somebody the family knows and he said no they know they blew up the
[02:28:34.420 --> 02:28:40.420]  helicopter you know what it's like to actually talk to an active Navy SEAL he
[02:28:40.420 --> 02:28:44.300]  goes but most of the guys think there's al-qaeda moles inside and that's how
[02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:47.700]  they did I said oh on an old helicopter well that's what they say we never fly
[02:28:47.700 --> 02:28:51.140]  on those and they never put that many of us on they said was a rescue mission but
[02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:54.180]  it wasn't it was all just a cover story they're like how do we get some
[02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:56.900]  propaganda out of this we're gonna kill these guys because they know the
[02:28:56.900 --> 02:29:03.940]  bin Laden raid was fake um you say they were flying to save the army pinned down
[02:29:03.940 --> 02:29:08.820]  by al-qaeda and then you blow it up and then it turned out army wasn't pinned
[02:29:08.820 --> 02:29:11.980]  down it wasn't real it's like they recycled Pat Tillman and the Army
[02:29:11.980 --> 02:29:15.220]  Rangers he's going public writing letters he's gonna expose the government
[02:29:15.220 --> 02:29:18.860]  drug dealing how they run al-qaeda now that's all known now that wasn't
[02:29:18.860 --> 02:29:23.100]  supposed to come out you know five six years ago so Pat Tillman they triple
[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:27.540]  capped him and then the air and the army colonel the coroner would line he said
[02:29:27.540 --> 02:29:32.460]  no they murdered him but they said he was charging an al-qaeda machine gun
[02:29:32.460 --> 02:29:37.620]  nest just like the Navy SEALs were going to save the army from al-qaeda there was
[02:29:37.620 --> 02:29:41.620]  no battle there was no nothing they flew him out to a remote place and then
[02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:45.420]  detonated bombs on board and I've got a whole bunch of them a whole bunch of FBI
[02:29:45.420 --> 02:29:50.960]  and Navy SEALs all being killed right now all being murdered we're on the

[02:34:16.460 --> 02:34:23.620]  next guest has quite a political and military pedigree Paul Hellyer is one of
[02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:27.980]  Canada's best known and most controversial politicians and I'm not
[02:34:27.980 --> 02:34:32.180]  gonna go over his whole bio but he's been deputy prime minister he's been the
[02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:37.100]  head of the Defense Department there he's best known for the unification of
[02:34:37.100 --> 02:34:40.340]  the Canadian Armed Forces and chairmanship of the task force on
[02:34:40.340 --> 02:34:44.180]  housing and urban development and he's maintained a lifelong interest in
[02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:48.220]  macroeconomics through the years as a journalist and political commentator he
[02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:51.420]  has continued to fight for economic reforms and has written several books on
[02:34:51.420 --> 02:34:57.660]  the subject and that's Paul Hellyer web.com in recent years he's become
[02:34:57.660 --> 02:35:03.060]  interested in extraterrestrial presence and their superior technology that we
[02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:07.340]  have been emulating in September 2005 he became the first person of cabinet rank
[02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:11.980]  in the g8 group of countries to state unequivocally UFOs are real we know
[02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:16.500]  there's unidentified flying objects just what are they as the airplanes flying
[02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:22.100]  overhead and I don't get into UFO stuff because most of it's just black projects
[02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:25.900]  secret stuff and the media you already heard Rachel Maddow come out and say
[02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:30.940]  that I say giant wasps are under the UN building I don't cover UFOs what's funny
[02:35:30.940 --> 02:35:33.420]  she said that a few nights ago and now I've got somebody that gets into that
[02:35:33.420 --> 02:35:38.380]  and we're gonna play a clip of him in one of these hearings and he speaks
[02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:41.580]  before Parliament you name it getting into the Bilderberg group and global
[02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:45.980]  governance that's not a theory that's real so he comes off very credible and
[02:35:45.980 --> 02:35:49.300]  he's respected all over the world and he's you know one of the most respected
[02:35:49.300 --> 02:35:52.900]  people in the whole disclosure project so we're gonna get his take on that here
[02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:58.740]  in just a moment but here is a clip of him talking to a panel that I believe
[02:35:58.740 --> 02:36:02.660]  was televised on their c-span here it is who are these vested interests and what
[02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:13.740]  are they up to well senator you were talking about a military Honda in my
[02:36:13.740 --> 02:36:23.900]  opinion that is true but I have broadened and deepened the definition to cabal and
[02:36:23.900 --> 02:36:31.860]  the cabal comprises members of the three sisters the Council on Foreign Relations
[02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:37.740]  the Bilderbergers and the Trilateral Commission the International Banking
[02:36:37.740 --> 02:36:45.700]  Cartel the oil cartel members of various intelligence organizations and select
[02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:51.380]  members of the military unit who together have become a shadow government
[02:36:51.380 --> 02:36:59.140]  of not only the United States but of much of the Western world
[02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:05.060]  all right and joining us is Paul Hellyer then I have some big breaking news that
[02:37:05.060 --> 02:37:08.740]  just went up on in full wars calm Adam Kokesh calls for new American Revolution
[02:37:08.740 --> 02:37:12.580]  I am and he's talking about well I'm gonna get to that in a moment I'm
[02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:15.980]  calling for a restoration of the Republic mr. hell you're good to have
[02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:19.580]  you on with us we appreciate your courage you know saying what you believe
[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:23.260]  is formally heading up the Department of Defense in your country when you start
[02:37:23.260 --> 02:37:26.860]  you know talking about the stuff people pay attention thank you for joining us
[02:37:26.860 --> 02:37:31.860]  it's a pleasure tell us about your process of awakening and specifically
[02:37:31.860 --> 02:37:36.580]  what research you've come to to as I agree Trilateral Commission CFR
[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:41.180]  Bilderberg all the heads of that are all the same heads of the other
[02:37:41.180 --> 02:37:44.700]  organizations so people ask well which group is it well they're all just
[02:37:44.700 --> 02:37:47.980]  different management teams as you know so give us your view on the world power
[02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:52.540]  structure and and and and where they want to take us we know it's real but
[02:37:52.540 --> 02:37:56.300]  but who are they and and where do they want to take us well I think the three
[02:37:56.300 --> 02:38:03.540]  sisters are all sort of joined together at the hip like Siamese Siamese children
[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:11.740]  and they're where they're trying to take us and this has been set out in writing
[02:38:11.740 --> 02:38:19.260]  by the Council on Foreign Relations as far back as World War two they're
[02:38:19.260 --> 02:38:25.380]  headed in the direction of a world government and effectively run by them
[02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:33.420]  they don't believe in democracy as we have seen it over the years of of by and
[02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:39.260]  for the people they believe that there is a little better way and the better
[02:38:39.260 --> 02:38:44.540]  way is to have the elite of the world and especially bankers are running it
[02:38:44.540 --> 02:38:49.540]  the problem is that they are already doing that to a very great extent and
[02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:54.460]  running it for their own benefit and to the exclusion of the benefit of ordinary
[02:38:54.460 --> 02:39:00.820]  people who who do most of the work and create most of the wealth so it's it's a
[02:39:00.820 --> 02:39:09.140]  direction which I think has been going on for probably 40 or 50 years very
[02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:15.500]  successfully it involves much of globalization the purpose of
[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:22.300]  globalization was to enable them to extend their their reach into every
[02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:27.500]  country that they would have the ability to cherry-pick the assets and industries
[02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:34.340]  of other countries to establish branch plank plants there of their banks and to
[02:39:34.340 --> 02:39:38.820]  get involved in the money creation function and those in those countries
[02:39:38.820 --> 02:39:46.100]  and all of this leading to the end of a world autocracy and I think this is
[02:39:46.100 --> 02:39:54.060]  absolutely totally wrong and I'm doing everything I can to say whoa let's get
[02:39:54.060 --> 02:40:00.580]  off the train before it's too late and I just hope it isn't too late now because
[02:40:00.580 --> 02:40:05.540]  we're gonna have to act very fast now as the head of the Canadian military at
[02:40:05.540 --> 02:40:09.580]  one time you're obviously led into NATO councils the highest levels of global
[02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:13.660]  national security which they use to breed all this under but but now
[02:40:13.660 --> 02:40:18.340]  everything you just said so eloquently is exactly what they're doing and then
[02:40:18.340 --> 02:40:20.820]  that's what freaks me out when you say they've got a bunch of advanced
[02:40:20.820 --> 02:40:24.860]  technology they're hiding where is all this stuff coming from and then I read
[02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:31.020]  Eric Schmidt Google says AI industry control from humans within five to ten
[02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:35.540]  years and then I read their public writing saying as soon as we merge with
[02:40:35.540 --> 02:40:40.500]  the AI you'll be like bugs whether it's Ray Kurzweil or him they all talk about
[02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:45.580]  the end of humanity bill joy went to a conference in 99 he wrote about it in
[02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:48.900]  2000 why the future doesn't need us he was worth 4 billion at the time even
[02:40:48.900 --> 02:40:54.660]  more now co-owner of Sun Microsystems involved with Apple you name it he said
[02:40:54.660 --> 02:40:59.900]  no I went to a conference and we all discussed do we kill everybody when we
[02:40:59.900 --> 02:41:03.100]  merge with machines and don't need them anymore and become gods basically
[02:41:03.100 --> 02:41:06.100]  whether that's real or not that's what they're saying publicly in Wired
[02:41:06.100 --> 02:41:11.980]  magazine or do we just let them like children continue on eating resources
[02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:14.820]  well you can argue humans are hurting the earth but they're just coldly
[02:41:14.820 --> 02:41:19.460]  talking about writing everyone off and then I see this program so so what is
[02:41:19.460 --> 02:41:23.740]  the endgame because what you said is absolutely correct they believe whether
[02:41:23.740 --> 02:41:27.060]  they're gonna attain this advanced life extension or not they may have already
[02:41:27.060 --> 02:41:32.100]  done it is it we know they've stratified technological development into their
[02:41:32.100 --> 02:41:37.340]  centralized national security reservations I mean how bad is it I mean
[02:41:37.340 --> 02:41:40.380]  obviously sir you know a lot of classified stuff I mean you were the
[02:41:40.380 --> 02:41:45.700]  head of the Canadian US military I've had Andres van Bula former German
[02:41:45.700 --> 02:41:49.900]  defense minister you know head of the German military on and you know he says
[02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:54.500]  the CIA stage 9-11 with the Muslim patsies and he wrote the book the CIA
[02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:58.460]  stage 9-11 I mean it's just it's you get the former German defense minister on he
[02:41:58.460 --> 02:42:01.740]  sounds just like me and you come on you sound just like I mean what is it sir
[02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:05.940]  I'm kind of ranting here how much trouble are we in and were you let into
[02:42:05.940 --> 02:42:08.900]  this when you were in the Canadian government the answer to the second
[02:42:08.900 --> 02:42:15.020]  question is definitely no everything that I know now roughly I have learned
[02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:21.860]  the last eight years with the exception of the direction being taken generally
[02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:27.700]  by the three sisters and their patsies and I have written about that in several
[02:42:27.700 --> 02:42:32.540]  books including my latest one which is the light at the end of the tunnel a
[02:42:32.540 --> 02:42:38.020]  survival plan for the human species species oh I want to read that I didn't
[02:42:38.020 --> 02:42:41.860]  even know you had that book where do people get that sir they can get it from
[02:42:41.860 --> 02:42:47.720]  my website which you put a said was paul heather web.com now there it is okay
[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:51.660]  there's a lot of video up there so getting at this for my research though
[02:42:51.660 --> 02:42:56.660]  the three sisters are the open government management team but but the
[02:42:56.660 --> 02:43:01.100]  shadow government behind the first level of shadow government Northcom it's
[02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:04.620]  already absorbed much of Canada I want your take on that you know US troops at
[02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:09.880]  the Olympics patrolling the streets up there what is you from your research the
[02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:13.580]  goal of the shadow government or do you disagree with a statement I just made
[02:43:13.580 --> 02:43:18.060]  well I don't really know because they haven't let me in on their secrets but
[02:43:18.060 --> 02:43:23.300]  as I said the goal as far as I can see is a world government dominated by them
[02:43:23.300 --> 02:43:29.620]  now one of the things they have been doing in the last few years is some
[02:43:29.620 --> 02:43:35.460]  genetic experiments and I think that's pretty well known and I don't know how
[02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:39.180]  well documented it is now there's thousands of companies creating
[02:43:39.180 --> 02:43:43.020]  humankind mirrors splice with different plants and animals but they terminate
[02:43:43.020 --> 02:43:49.740]  them reportedly before birth well this is probably true in most cases but
[02:43:49.740 --> 02:43:55.300]  they're spending a lot of money on things like that that I think is just
[02:43:55.300 --> 02:43:58.980]  going in exactly the wrong direction oh yeah no kidding yeah exactly what they
[02:43:58.980 --> 02:44:01.940]  should be doing is trying to build a better world for the people who live in
[02:44:01.940 --> 02:44:06.620]  it and one of the things that the extraterrestrials could do for them and
[02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:15.580]  have said and I quote some of this in my book too when I quote some passages from
[02:44:15.580 --> 02:44:21.420]  Jim Sparks book which he allowed me to do was there a way ahead of us in
[02:44:21.420 --> 02:44:27.580]  medicine for example and we could use some improved medicine that much lower
[02:44:27.580 --> 02:44:32.340]  prices without having fixed prices and that sort of thing they're ahead of us
[02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:36.540]  in agriculture they're ahead of us in technology and that they could help us
[02:44:36.540 --> 02:44:40.980]  clean up the air and the water and save our planet which is probably one of the
[02:44:40.980 --> 02:44:46.780]  most beautiful planets that there is there is in a long long way Paul hell
[02:44:46.780 --> 02:44:50.940]  you're again you're the former deputy prime minister of Canada former head
[02:44:50.940 --> 02:44:56.540]  defense minister you're a very respected guy and you're here because again I know
[02:44:56.540 --> 02:45:00.420]  the billerberg groups real now I know that they're gonna put it on national
[02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:05.660]  TV that I said that there are human animal chimeras that's BBC AP Reuters
[02:45:05.660 --> 02:45:09.260]  but they know the general public reads it and doesn't even get that human
[02:45:09.260 --> 02:45:16.340]  clones are illegal but if they make you 1% lizard or 1% fish then they claim
[02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:21.500]  it's not a human and has no rights guys type in human animal clones made in
[02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:24.940]  laboratory show people mainstream news just so it's on record when racial mad
[02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:28.580]  out twist this that that's so that's already so far out that then I'm like
[02:45:28.580 --> 02:45:32.780]  okay maybe there is something going on you know it's certainly something going
[02:45:32.780 --> 02:45:38.220]  on and if the American people were aware of it they would be in many of them at
[02:45:38.220 --> 02:45:44.020]  least very unhappy here's the Daily Mail 150 animal human hybrid human animal
[02:45:44.020 --> 02:45:48.020]  hybrids grown in UK labs embryos have been produced secretly over the past
[02:45:48.020 --> 02:45:50.860]  three years well it's really 30 years but so let's let me say this to you sir
[02:45:50.860 --> 02:45:55.620]  what I'm saying to you is what is your proof of extraterrestrials do you I mean
[02:45:55.620 --> 02:46:01.180]  were you did you see this in government what is your proof the proof that they
[02:46:01.180 --> 02:46:09.740]  exist yes although for one thing the five days of testimony in Washington at
[02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:14.900]  the citizens disclosure from people many of whom I've known and listened to
[02:46:14.900 --> 02:46:23.020]  before who have actually worked in some of the black ops who have seen
[02:46:23.020 --> 02:46:31.020]  extraterrestrials personally and the just a range of evidence which is so
[02:46:31.020 --> 02:46:36.500]  overwhelming that when we appeared there a couple of weeks ago we started out
[02:46:36.500 --> 02:46:44.380]  with these 5x congressman and 1x senator Congress people or persons and they were
[02:46:44.380 --> 02:46:49.960]  all skeptics and two or three of them very vociferous step of skeptics and by
[02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:56.620]  the time we finished on Friday night at six o'clock they had all changed over
[02:46:56.620 --> 02:47:01.980]  completely it began earlier in the week sure but there was one holdout until the
[02:47:01.980 --> 02:47:06.260]  last day and but I'll tell you what's most compelling they have a whole what
[02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:11.900]  is it like 12 of the astronauts Apollo and others the recordings are real NASA
[02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:15.540]  recordings NASA admits they're real but then the media discredits anybody
[02:47:15.540 --> 02:47:18.940]  falsely that talks about it where they did say they were shadowed by their
[02:47:18.940 --> 02:47:22.140]  craft and now you could say it was the Russians or something but I doubt that
[02:47:22.140 --> 02:47:26.460]  and I've seen the NASA footage of you know them shooting particle beams at
[02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:30.300]  stuff that's doing turns so fast that I mean obviously there's a lot of
[02:47:30.300 --> 02:47:34.020]  suppressed technology but what I've been told by high-level NASA people is that
[02:47:34.020 --> 02:47:37.020]  it's really advanced government technology but I guess you're saying
[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:42.660]  that they were given that they've been given a lot of information yes they've
[02:47:42.660 --> 02:47:48.740]  been back engineering this this technology for 60 years with with
[02:47:48.740 --> 02:47:55.860]  hundreds of the best scientists in the United States I guess and spending how
[02:47:55.860 --> 02:48:03.620]  much of the taxpayers dollars will probably never really be known but I was
[02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:08.380]  at a conference I guess was six years ago where an estimate was made that they
[02:48:08.380 --> 02:48:14.260]  had spent over two trillion as of then yeah and that they had basically I think
[02:48:14.260 --> 02:48:21.260]  what they have achieved in 60 years is mind-boggling so much so that I can
[02:48:21.260 --> 02:48:24.780]  understand in a way why they don't want people to know what they've accomplished
[02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:27.780]  yeah how much more yeah they want to keep it for themselves regardless if it's
[02:48:27.780 --> 02:48:32.460]  off-world or not how would how would the word I've got is that the the the
[02:48:32.460 --> 02:48:37.140]  military-industrial complex is probably 30 to 40 years ahead of what we publicly
[02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:44.500]  see about what people know yes that the military-industrial complex has
[02:48:44.500 --> 02:48:49.380]  technology 30 to 40 years advanced of what we know oh yeah more than that by
[02:48:49.380 --> 02:48:57.460]  far hundreds of years advanced in some areas this has happened very rapidly in
[02:48:57.460 --> 02:49:01.580]  the last 60 years and we've known we knew about that in Canada because one of
[02:49:01.580 --> 02:49:09.100]  our scientists was involved in the very early stages in 1950 and he was told by
[02:49:09.100 --> 02:49:17.940]  dr. Robert Starbuck that UFOs were real that the method of propulsion was at
[02:49:17.940 --> 02:49:25.260]  that time unknown that's no longer true I think and that the whole area was
[02:49:25.260 --> 02:49:30.540]  classified more highly than the H bomb and that the United States government
[02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:36.140]  took it extremely seriously and that a group of scientists under dr. van of our
[02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:42.300]  Bush had already begun to see if they could find out the means of propulsion
[02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:47.660]  and back engineer the technology that is your intelligence that they're working
[02:49:47.660 --> 02:49:56.220]  with these these these things pardon me well here's the deal if they've 16 years
[02:49:56.220 --> 02:50:00.860]  ago the BBC reported that a decade-plus before they'd made human animal clones
[02:50:00.860 --> 02:50:05.260]  but it was legal because they weren't human now now it's all over the news
[02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:08.220]  today and I'm still called to cook for that so I know there's a lot of wild
[02:50:08.220 --> 02:50:15.300]  stuff going on but who says that they're not subject to the laws of the world the
[02:50:15.300 --> 02:50:19.780]  laws of I know I agree I think it's I mean my goodness you can't have animal
[02:50:19.780 --> 02:50:23.060]  cruelty but you can have a human that's cruelly mixed with something it's
[02:50:23.060 --> 02:50:26.200]  hellish they got you know 20 years ago they had Reese's monkey splice with
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:30.180]  jellyfish I got it it's it's out of control I'm saying I get there's wild
[02:50:30.180 --> 02:50:34.580]  stuff but I can prove they've created humanoid clones which are pretty much
[02:50:34.580 --> 02:50:38.420]  not of this world when I'm asking you that's an alien to me and that's alien
[02:50:38.420 --> 02:50:43.460]  to what the natural order okay so I'm not too big universe I've just never
[02:50:43.460 --> 02:50:48.660]  seen absolute proof that there's little green men visiting this planet and I'm
[02:50:48.660 --> 02:50:52.460]  saying you've got people that you say have the proof I know there's the
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:55.980]  Bilderberg yeah I'm gonna shut up when we come back I'm gonna ask you you know

[02:54:15.500 --> 02:54:21.780]  minister on with us talking about disclosure look here's what I know there
[02:54:21.780 --> 02:54:25.980]  have been leaked documents over the years of project blue bean and they
[02:54:25.980 --> 02:54:30.060]  could basically with animatronics or holograms high-tech stuff and they've
[02:54:30.060 --> 02:54:35.580]  talked about this have fake UFO landings has been so many hoaxes I'm worried
[02:54:35.580 --> 02:54:39.300]  about them doing some type of alien invasion deal to unify the planet the
[02:54:39.300 --> 02:54:43.460]  only documents I've got from government are on that front so and I don't think
[02:54:43.460 --> 02:54:46.140]  you're a bad guy sir and I appreciate you coming on and I want to read your
[02:54:46.140 --> 02:54:52.040]  book I'm gonna get a copy all hell your web calm but it's light at the end the
[02:54:52.040 --> 02:54:57.860]  tunnel you says the name of it but I want to ask you I mean have you not been
[02:54:57.860 --> 02:55:02.020]  approached about that this whole disclosure project thing could be a
[02:55:02.020 --> 02:55:07.420]  giant disinformation campaign no absolutely not the disclosure project is
[02:55:07.420 --> 02:55:15.220]  perfectly legitimate by some of the most respectable people I know there's a
[02:55:15.220 --> 02:55:19.340]  probably the odd infiltrator from time to time who was part of the
[02:55:19.340 --> 02:55:25.820]  disinformation process which has been going on because you can't keep this
[02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:29.860]  sort of thing secret for 60 years if you don't have people out providing
[02:55:29.860 --> 02:55:34.780]  misinformation and disinformation and on that score I think you sort of that
[02:55:34.780 --> 02:55:39.440]  crit credence to some of their propaganda when you refer to little
[02:55:39.440 --> 02:55:44.580]  green men in my book which I said was light at the end of the tunnel a
[02:55:44.580 --> 02:55:49.980]  survival plan for the human species I list several species and the only one
[02:55:49.980 --> 02:55:53.860]  that could be identified well the two that can be identified by color one is
[02:55:53.860 --> 02:56:00.220]  the Grays so-called which are the ones that apparently the one of the ones that
[02:56:00.220 --> 02:56:05.900]  the US government has been working with and the the orange but there are also
[02:56:05.900 --> 02:56:10.380]  tall whites and there are Nordics that look so much like us that they can walk
[02:56:10.380 --> 02:56:15.020]  down the street without being identified and if you want to handle the graves
[02:56:15.020 --> 02:56:19.220]  like a biomechanical Android of another species well some of them may be but
[02:56:19.220 --> 02:56:23.100]  there are different kinds of graves and they and you'd have to know more about
[02:56:23.100 --> 02:56:26.620]  it than either one of us I know but but I mean Paul where's the proof of all
[02:56:26.620 --> 02:56:30.420]  this and you know I make the little green man joke because I don't really
[02:56:30.420 --> 02:56:34.100]  believe all this stuff and they say I do on television well I'm going to give you
[02:56:34.100 --> 02:56:42.380]  a person to phone who has lived with and the tall whites on a gunnery range in
[02:56:42.380 --> 02:56:49.100]  Nevada where they live with the United States Air Force on the United States
[02:56:49.100 --> 02:56:56.540]  Air Force US government soil and his name is Charles Hall he's written a
[02:56:56.540 --> 02:57:00.700]  series of books called millennial hospitality which you can get through
[02:57:00.700 --> 02:57:05.940]  the internet or you can I'm sure if you want to get us now I know but I mean I
[02:57:05.940 --> 02:57:09.580]  know about all this stuff and there's never proof man I can't get people to
[02:57:09.580 --> 02:57:13.860]  admit they're splicing humans and animals when it's an AP Reuters guys
[02:57:13.860 --> 02:57:18.020]  come up at pizza places and shove me in the back and say I'm a liar about stuff
[02:57:18.020 --> 02:57:22.180]  that's admitted so you know all I know is is that I'm not like Rachel Maddow
[02:57:22.180 --> 02:57:25.940]  who believes there's big wasp under I'm joking so she said about me look look
[02:57:25.940 --> 02:57:30.460]  you say a lot of credible stuff about the Bilderberg group all of it and but
[02:57:30.460 --> 02:57:32.900]  people are going to say that you're mixing all this together because they
[02:57:32.900 --> 02:57:36.580]  always say oh you believe in a new world order you believe in space aliens yeah
[02:57:36.580 --> 02:57:41.700]  so they you know it goes both ways I don't have you on here to discredit you
[02:57:41.700 --> 02:57:46.860]  I've got an open mind is what I'm saying but I just have never seen the beef the
[02:57:46.860 --> 02:57:52.620]  proof show me the money I mean where is the proof of these aliens well what I'm
[02:57:52.620 --> 02:57:57.660]  saying is that if you took if you had read all of the books I have and talked
[02:57:57.660 --> 02:58:02.300]  to all of the of the witnesses who are credible in my opinion and I've checked
[02:58:02.300 --> 02:58:08.820]  them all out anybody that I quote in my book or mentioned online on radio shows
[02:58:08.820 --> 02:58:15.060]  I have checked them out for authenticity if you spent the time that I have
[02:58:15.060 --> 02:58:19.820]  researching those things you could not come to any other conclusion but let me
[02:58:19.820 --> 02:58:25.980]  add do you believe that carbon dioxide is causing global warming yes but what
[02:58:25.980 --> 02:58:33.020]  about a carbon tax fix that no so Paul I'm gonna get you back on some time

[03:00:20.540 --> 03:00:23.900]  Alex Jones
[03:00:27.900 --> 03:00:33.820]  all right my friends thank you for joining us I want to make a statement
[03:00:33.820 --> 03:00:46.380]  now I want to make a statement right now on the entire Adam Kokesh saga
[03:00:46.380 --> 03:00:52.020]  I've only met Adam Kokesh once I have watched and read you know his work for
[03:00:52.020 --> 03:00:57.060]  the last four or five years I do not think that he is a bad person but I
[03:00:57.060 --> 03:01:05.260]  think that he has you know basically not been wise in some of the things that
[03:01:05.260 --> 03:01:11.460]  he's been doing and I think there's too many opportunities by the establishment
[03:01:11.460 --> 03:01:14.460]  to
[03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:19.700]  really set the Liberty movement up at a time that we're gaining so much headway
[03:01:19.700 --> 03:01:23.820]  that I have to say that when he announced he was going to have a
[03:01:23.820 --> 03:01:28.500]  peaceful armed march on DC as civil disobedience to point out the Supreme
[03:01:28.500 --> 03:01:33.420]  Court had overthrown DC versus Heller five years ago and that's legal to carry
[03:01:33.420 --> 03:01:37.780]  firearms there but they still have an unconstitutional law in place I saw the
[03:01:37.780 --> 03:01:40.580]  perspective of it being like black people saying I'm gonna sit at the lunch
[03:01:40.580 --> 03:01:43.620]  counter even if you say no blacks allowed or I'm gonna sit at the front of
[03:01:43.620 --> 03:01:45.820]  the bus
[03:01:46.580 --> 03:01:51.220]  and then if they arrested them create a court case showing that it was unlawful
[03:01:51.220 --> 03:01:54.860]  arrest the problem is they're not gonna play fair they're gonna set people up
[03:01:54.860 --> 03:01:58.740]  the standard deal is to put them all off cocktails in your car or a pipe bomb and
[03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:02.980]  send you to jail people trying to peacefully protest at RNC and DNC have
[03:02:02.980 --> 03:02:07.580]  that done to them I've been covering a military drill in Florida in a
[03:02:07.580 --> 03:02:10.940]  neighborhood and had a special forces guy start a fire and try to blame it on
[03:02:10.940 --> 03:02:15.260]  me that I had to stomp out and then physically stop the guy Mike Hansen's of
[03:02:15.260 --> 03:02:20.540]  my camera guys a witness of that okay I mean these people do not play games and
[03:02:20.540 --> 03:02:27.220]  if you start saying well this is a armed revolt and using legal ease of we're
[03:02:27.220 --> 03:02:31.100]  armed it's our right we're not going to shoot if they don't shoot first that's
[03:02:31.100 --> 03:02:35.540]  when I start really saying hey maybe nobody should go to this because I was
[03:02:35.540 --> 03:02:40.300]  saying go unarmed to videotape it as an observer to be able to hopefully stop
[03:02:40.300 --> 03:02:45.660]  what he's doing not being used by the enemy because I respect the courage but
[03:02:45.660 --> 03:02:50.420]  I don't respect the way it's being handled and now Adam Kokesh they had a
[03:02:50.420 --> 03:02:53.820]  press conference today when they released one of the people that had been
[03:02:53.820 --> 03:02:58.380]  at the rally Adam Kokesh still being held and and after trying to put
[03:02:58.380 --> 03:03:01.660]  attention on this you know we were basically told oh well maybe we'll get
[03:03:01.660 --> 03:03:06.620]  to you later which again just shows the disconnect as if having mainstream
[03:03:06.620 --> 03:03:10.900]  media coverage even matters they're only going to spin and twist everything you
[03:03:10.900 --> 03:03:15.700]  do all that matters is long-form discussions and I think that more and
[03:03:15.700 --> 03:03:19.540]  more they're irritated by the fact that I have said I don't think this is a good
[03:03:19.540 --> 03:03:24.220]  idea now that said here is the breaking news and I'm gonna do a you know focus
[03:03:24.220 --> 03:03:28.420]  statement on this later this just came out about ten minutes ago Adam Kokesh is
[03:03:28.420 --> 03:03:31.500]  now talking about how
[03:03:31.980 --> 03:03:38.140]  people should march on all 50 capitals and all 50 governors he says we may have
[03:03:38.140 --> 03:03:42.260]  passed the point at which nonviolent revolution becomes impossible this was
[03:03:42.260 --> 03:03:47.340]  released by his people so we're taking it as if it's true and this is not the
[03:03:47.340 --> 03:03:51.660]  time to offensively go out and look for a provocation if the global is come to
[03:03:51.660 --> 03:03:55.380]  take our guns you'll see it start happening around the country there'll be
[03:03:55.380 --> 03:03:58.660]  a Lexington will be a Concord and my god I don't want to go there either but if
[03:03:58.660 --> 03:04:03.240]  they start it that's the way it is but but but I'm not here to watch Adam
[03:04:03.240 --> 03:04:07.980]  Kokesh at a I'm for decriminalization because I know the globalists use it as
[03:04:07.980 --> 03:04:10.740]  a tool of control
[03:04:10.900 --> 03:04:16.740]  I am for decriminalization because I understand the fraud of the system but
[03:04:16.740 --> 03:04:19.660]  it doesn't mean I'm for everybody being stoned out of their gourds just you know
[03:04:19.660 --> 03:04:23.460]  George Washington wasn't it things lighting up weed you know getting stoned
[03:04:23.460 --> 03:04:27.600]  and all this stuff it's just the whole thing is out of control and now there's
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:31.940]  talk of maybe we need to get violent I don't support the March I don't support
[03:04:31.940 --> 03:04:35.460]  any of this stuff the minute I started and I know he's locked up mad in a cage
[03:04:35.460 --> 03:04:39.540]  I don't think he's an agent provocateur but he calls himself a Liberty
[03:04:39.540 --> 03:04:43.420]  provocateur I don't like the smell or any of this and I agree with Lou Rockwell
[03:04:43.420 --> 03:04:47.420]  you know from day one I've had problems I've tried to say I admire courage but
[03:04:47.420 --> 03:04:49.940]  hey we need to make sure there's coverage of this so they don't spin it
[03:04:49.940 --> 03:04:55.980]  but now it's just gone too far it and again I think Adams crew are good guys
[03:04:55.980 --> 03:05:05.540]  but I'll have a more of a statement on this on the nightly news tonight
