[00:50.480 --> 00:55.760]  negative towards the police oh you're so negative towards the military oh you're so negative towards
[00:55.760 --> 01:03.280]  city year and how are we supposed to not be when videos like this one are surfacing now I'm going
[01:03.280 --> 01:09.920]  to talk about it before we actually play the audio and then in the top of the third hour maybe I'll
[01:09.920 --> 01:14.400]  have to be the top of the fourth because we have Lou Rockwell coming up we're gonna play the actual
[01:14.400 --> 01:19.440]  video of this but let me break it down and right now there are top stories over at info wars.com
[01:19.440 --> 01:27.840]  and prismplanet.com as we speak the tagline by Kurt Nemo is insane thug cops attack emergency
[01:27.840 --> 01:36.160]  paramedic yeah that's right folks you can't even be an ambulance driver trying to take somebody to
[01:36.160 --> 01:45.600]  the hospital without getting beaten by the police let me repeat that you can't be an EMT worker
[01:45.600 --> 01:54.240]  in an ambulance with somebody in the back needing to go to a hospital an emergency see that's why
[01:54.240 --> 01:58.560]  they're emergency vehicles that's why they have the big lights on the top and the sirens so they
[01:58.560 --> 02:04.480]  can get through traffic you know bring people to the hospital so that they can live that sort of thing
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.120]  no you can't do that anymore in this country without being harassed by police officers
[02:09.120 --> 02:15.600]  then arrested by police officers then beaten by police officers and and again thank god for the
[02:15.600 --> 02:19.600]  cell phone camera you know i'm one of those guys that's really down on the iphone sometimes
[02:19.600 --> 02:23.600]  but it can be used to empower an enslave i'm not saying this guy was using an iphone i'm saying he
[02:23.600 --> 02:30.160]  used his camera phone he hit the video it's about three minutes of video he's he's just in shock
[02:30.160 --> 02:36.960]  because he's not even one of the EMTs it's his mom in the back it's ma dukes and he's trying he can't
[02:36.960 --> 02:45.360]  believe it his mom's screaming in the background what's going on oh so the cop then goes over to
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.120]  the driver who is a white gentleman by the way all the cops are white i don't want to make this a
[02:49.120 --> 02:54.320]  racial issue but you know when people see this i mean i just don't understand where it goes from
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.760]  they're talking to the driver there doesn't seem to be a problem there then they walk over to uh
[02:59.760 --> 03:05.440]  the gentleman in the back he happens to be a black guy and within 30 seconds they're arresting him
[03:05.440 --> 03:11.600]  and then when he's like what are you arresting me for they got their hands around his neck the cops
[03:11.600 --> 03:17.280]  are out of control insane thug cops attack emergency paramedic all across the country cops are
[03:17.280 --> 03:22.880]  attacking people for not responding quick enough to bark commands or for not groveling
[03:22.880 --> 03:27.920]  indeference to their thuggish authority actually let's talk about somebody who groveled if you go
[03:27.920 --> 03:31.840]  over to the info warrior dot com it's a little more edible because it's just my little blog you
[03:31.840 --> 03:37.520]  scroll down we had a guy who admittedly was on the run from the police he exited his vehicle
[03:37.520 --> 03:42.640]  as far as i know he was not a violent criminal at least in the chase even if he was when he was
[03:42.640 --> 03:47.760]  cornered he immediately went to the ground he put his hands to his side just like they instruct and
[03:47.760 --> 03:53.600]  what does he get he gets bootsy mix digger right to the jawline as he's down and then cops high five
[03:53.600 --> 04:01.040]  this is even more disgusting this isn't a criminal this is an emt worker an emt worker insane and
[04:01.040 --> 04:05.680]  violent cops have been caught repeatedly on tape and violent assaulting nonviolent citizens
[04:05.680 --> 04:10.160]  tasering and even murdering them that's right there are snuff films out there because they
[04:10.160 --> 04:15.200]  like to shoot people while they're on the ground begging for their lives in subways let's not
[04:15.200 --> 04:20.640]  forget the gentleman who was at a family reunion a grandfather holding a family reunion in his back
[04:20.640 --> 04:27.200]  yard it wasn't even clear where the police were there and they shot him to death it's unfortunate

[08:55.120 --> 09:03.040]  standard time 11 a.m to 3 p.m but uh i saw at the alex jones channel the resurrected alex jones
[09:03.040 --> 09:09.280]  channel on youtube the top video that's now up on info wars dot com and i watched it about five
[09:09.280 --> 09:14.640]  times and i called you early this morning when you were at the bank and i appreciate you getting
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.840]  in early and getting everybody to get it up on the side but i watched it over and over and over
[09:19.840 --> 09:28.080]  again at least five six times pausing it to get exactly what happened and i want to contact the
[09:28.080 --> 09:34.000]  people i want robbie the producer and others he's on it already actually less good he's already on
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  it to contact that youtube channel i know it's also on the local news there in oklahoma so call
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.720]  that local news channel they're usually very helpful i want to get a hold of this man whose
[09:44.720 --> 09:54.640]  mother i had a heart attack and was uh going to the hospital and so that local news was saying
[09:54.640 --> 10:04.240]  but i've watched the video over and over again and all this is is they pull the ambulance over
[10:04.240 --> 10:08.640]  and i know all over the country they've got new rules where if it isn't life threatening that the
[10:08.640 --> 10:12.560]  ambulance doesn't turn its lights on it doesn't speed i know that because when i cut my finger off
[10:12.560 --> 10:22.240]  i wanted to just drive to the uh you know to the hospital and my buddy said no no no you
[10:22.240 --> 10:26.160]  got to call an ambulance because we were out on a boat when that happened so took a 20 minutes to
[10:26.160 --> 10:30.800]  get back to dock a few years ago when i got there i was getting in my car and forget the ambulance
[10:30.800 --> 10:36.320]  didn't hear yet and the ambulance pulled in and they said no you call this you know come with us
[10:36.320 --> 10:41.680]  and they strapped me in a chair sitting upright through those windy lake travis roads took them
[10:41.680 --> 10:48.080]  45 minutes to get to the downtown hospital uh you know literally driving like 35 miles an hour on
[10:48.080 --> 10:52.640]  a road you're supposed to drop 55 60 on and i never get car sick but actually get a car stick
[10:52.640 --> 10:57.680]  i guess just my finger was cut off so they me nauseated and uh they said yeah we can't speed
[10:57.680 --> 11:02.640]  unless it's life threatening and your finger dangling by a piece of skin isn't life threatening so
[11:02.640 --> 11:08.880]  we're not going to drive even the speed limit so i'm i'm guessing watching this and slowing it down
[11:08.880 --> 11:15.840]  listening to the cops this lady is going to the hospital she's in serious condition they don't
[11:15.840 --> 11:24.480]  like the fact that the ambulance is speeding and so the cops rush up get in the face of the white
[11:24.480 --> 11:30.480]  paramedic who's the head paramedic and because that's the driver and they start yelling at him
[11:30.480 --> 11:33.680]  and you could tell he's getting an argument with him but he goes ahead and submits and the cops are
[11:33.680 --> 11:37.920]  all bowed up wanting to beat the hell out of somebody you know and they've got these shaved
[11:37.920 --> 11:43.200]  head look like they're aroided up just all like like they were charging up san juan hill or iwo jima
[11:43.200 --> 11:48.400]  i mean they were fighting al-qaeda they were going into a machine gun nest chiller instinct on
[11:48.400 --> 11:52.240]  that's why you don't militarize the police military goes and kills people and breaks things
[11:52.240 --> 11:58.160]  they don't i mean let's think of the archetypal image of matt dillon as the sheriff or john wane
[11:58.160 --> 12:01.680]  playing the part of sheriffs and i've read a lot about real history that's what a good sheriff
[12:01.680 --> 12:07.440]  actually did do is they were they were in control they didn't crack heads unless they had to uh you
[12:07.440 --> 12:13.120]  know that's what a real man is like not these cops that want to split your head open
[12:13.120 --> 12:16.720]  and i don't want to bash cops here i know a lot of them are listeners i don't a lot of military
[12:16.720 --> 12:22.720]  are good the issue is they they have gotten on a power trip and are literally under mind control
[12:22.720 --> 12:30.400]  under a spirit of wickedness and aggression so you've got the the the uh and you're gonna play
[12:30.400 --> 12:34.400]  the video coming up next hour uh for folks on prison plot maybe when you go live you're gonna
[12:34.400 --> 12:38.480]  play the audio as soon as i leave but until folks about lou rockwell and other people that are
[12:38.480 --> 12:43.920]  coming up with the important issue here is what when you watch this video and then watch it and
[12:43.920 --> 12:49.280]  pause it and analyze it because then it's even worse than what at first comes off as people spin
[12:49.280 --> 12:53.280]  as they all give the cops time until they're side of the story we know what happened it's video
[12:53.280 --> 12:58.720]  from a camera phone which are becoming higher and higher quality big problems for the establishment
[12:59.680 --> 13:07.360]  and the cops pull over the ambulance more uh the cop stays in his car till more cops show up
[13:07.360 --> 13:12.960]  the man gets out who'd been following the ambulance he says they pulled my mother over in this ambulance
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.480]  the police come over they get in the face of the mt the mt the driver says what is the deal here
[13:21.120 --> 13:25.440]  uh because i've turned the audio jacked it all away and he says what's going on this lady's in
[13:25.440 --> 13:31.760]  bad condition and the cop bows up because they can never be wrong he he bows up in an attack
[13:31.760 --> 13:36.880]  formation you know with his fist together going you got it buddy you understand you know like
[13:36.880 --> 13:41.680]  a drill sergeant and the guy goes ahead and puts his hand down by the way the emt looks like a lot
[13:41.680 --> 13:47.280]  more of a man in this cop he kind of puts his head down in submission and just can't believe the evil
[13:47.280 --> 13:53.840]  he's witnessing so the black emt he starts getting out to go back and help the lady he's often getting
[13:53.840 --> 13:58.960]  a supply that he tried to save her life right there on the spot and the cop runs up the other
[13:58.960 --> 14:04.960]  cops run up with the marine corps drill sergeant hats on and literally starts screaming get back in
[14:04.960 --> 14:12.000]  the in the vehicle and the guy calmly big black guy looks like ten times the man the man this this
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.320]  wannabe tough guy state police officer is drops his shoulders and says i can't believe this this
[14:18.320 --> 14:23.760]  woman's in serious condition i'm doing my job and the cop yells at him and gets in his face so being
[14:23.760 --> 14:30.400]  a man the black emt barks point his finger going what's your problem this lady needs help i'm doing
[14:30.400 --> 14:36.800]  my job and the cop grabs him starts twisting him around being a man with red blood who in the slave
[14:36.800 --> 14:42.640]  he pushes back pushes the the assaulters the crazy right head probably he looks like it he's got
[14:42.640 --> 14:47.840]  fat on the neck you know he's got the signs of it around him he's got that puffy manhood that fake
[14:47.840 --> 14:54.000]  manhood he starts but he starts plus he's scared of the of the too big emt these cops always get
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.400]  scared of big guys i don't think they better take they always just go ahead and attack dog it's kind
[14:58.400 --> 15:04.960]  of like running forward or flight forward uh... it is what they do i mean if the guy looks like
[15:04.960 --> 15:11.040]  he's got any colonies any energy any manhood the police go into convulsions of anger at seeing a man
[15:11.040 --> 15:15.120]  they just they just hate it they hate america they hate freedom they hate liberty i mean this is
[15:15.120 --> 15:18.720]  the spirit that's on them i don't know if they consciously are like this but the spirit that's
[15:18.720 --> 15:23.120]  on them is every time they see somebody doing good it seems to flip them out this particular type
[15:23.120 --> 15:28.960]  but i'm not kidding watch the video it's like demonic spirit they're in these cops and so
[15:28.960 --> 15:32.800]  they start they start choking the black guy and he's smart you know you can tell he can obviously
[15:32.800 --> 15:36.160]  take them all on right there because he's the guy under attack and somebody in the right's always
[15:36.160 --> 15:40.160]  got the strength but he goes ahead and lets them choking and they keep choking him getting off on
[15:40.160 --> 15:44.480]  it and and and you can tell the black guy just totally controls himself and goes into a relaxed
[15:44.480 --> 15:50.400]  position as they're choking him getting off on it and you see one of the senior cops who's choking
[15:50.400 --> 15:55.440]  him start realizing he's embarrassed you see it come over and see his skin turn red he's flushed
[15:55.440 --> 16:00.880]  with embarrassment as he's sitting there choking this this poor emt and then they say okay you can
[16:00.880 --> 16:07.120]  go to the hospital and the cops start apologizing and patting people on the shoulders and they leave
[16:07.120 --> 16:12.240]  but that's what i'm saying an evil spirit i mean that i mean you'll believe in spirituality i mean
[16:12.240 --> 16:18.480]  it's a mindset it's an idea it comes over these cops like mad dogs that you know like when the
[16:18.480 --> 16:23.200]  neighborhood dog sees your cat and starts chasing it wanting to kill it getting into a frothing mood
[16:23.200 --> 16:27.680]  they've got these guys so hyped up that these guys are all for a military probably in iraq
[16:27.680 --> 16:32.640]  after kicking down thousands of doors in iraq all juiced up all out there on the streets like we're
[16:32.640 --> 16:37.280]  the enemy that now they're and i've seen a bunch of footage of them going after emt's or people
[16:37.280 --> 16:41.280]  speeding and maybe even 80 miles an hour with a pregnant wife they pull them over and beat them
[16:41.280 --> 16:45.920]  up in tasermen won't let them get to the hospital and make them have the kid there it's all about
[16:45.920 --> 16:51.760]  them making us submit it's all about them dominating us it's all about them making us put up with
[16:51.760 --> 16:57.920]  asinine ridiculous over the top things and it's getting worse and worse and these videos are coming
[16:57.920 --> 17:03.840]  out i mean it's just like the footage i have in martial law where they're breaking pro lifers arms
[17:03.840 --> 17:08.960]  for sitting on the sidewalk and laughing when they break their arms with numchucks by twisting them
[17:08.960 --> 17:13.840]  they then pull out billy clubs to beat them like they're like they get off on the fact that they
[17:13.840 --> 17:19.120]  broke in their arm and that they didn't resist and it's the same thing i saw when they shot their poor
[17:19.120 --> 17:27.280]  black man in the back on the uh train on the subway station in in oakland and they lied and
[17:27.280 --> 17:32.240]  confiscated all the cameras from people and lied and said that the train station cameras didn't work
[17:32.240 --> 17:37.280]  but somebody in a train across shot video of it and then the train got away before they could grab
[17:37.280 --> 17:43.840]  them and after they shoot him in the back in handcuffs they lied and said he resisted they
[17:43.840 --> 17:48.160]  lied and said he'd fought him didn't fight him whole thing on tape after they shoot him in the
[17:48.160 --> 17:54.240]  back it bounces back back off the concrete back into his heart and lungs as he's done the cop beats
[17:54.240 --> 18:00.160]  him up slamming him into the ground it's not enough that he murdered him as he died he had to sap
[18:00.160 --> 18:05.760]  the demonic force of pain it was a human sacrifice and these police don't know they're literally
[18:05.760 --> 18:10.000]  becoming demon possessed and again i believe that's what's happening even if you don't it's the
[18:10.000 --> 18:16.400]  psychology of just a bloodlust and look there's no way you can say you killed him if he didn't do
[18:16.400 --> 18:21.760]  anything you murdered him but that wasn't enough then they had to cover it up they had to lie and
[18:21.760 --> 18:28.560]  we finally get the footage they were the cop beats him up because he's because it's not enough
[18:28.560 --> 18:34.800]  that he murdered him he had to he had to extract the pain like a satanist as they slowly kill a
[18:34.800 --> 18:39.200]  baby over hours i don't want to go into how they sacrifice babies folks but it's unbelievable
[18:39.200 --> 18:44.880]  and and and and this is literally the spirit that is upon america the bureaucrats want your land

[24:18.400 --> 24:23.360]  well now emt's are the target and it is just unbelievable to me alex that they would number
[24:23.360 --> 24:29.360]  one pull over an ambulance with somebody in the back but number two assault the guy try to arrest
[24:29.360 --> 24:35.920]  him well i mean you know the thing is is that the emt's get out and you can see their body language
[24:35.920 --> 24:39.040]  in there you can hear what they say if you listen carefully you got a jacket way up because the guy
[24:39.040 --> 24:43.600]  with the camera is 15 feet away or so and they know they have their hands open they're going
[24:43.600 --> 24:47.600]  what are you doing we're we're emt's we're going to the hospital and the cops like
[24:49.600 --> 24:55.040]  and they go okay uh and so that goes on for a few minutes and then they decide to go ahead and
[24:55.040 --> 25:00.240]  try to save the lady's life and they go no and they start saying i will arrest you you do not
[25:00.240 --> 25:06.000]  help her and you sit right there and the guy's like what's your problem man and then the cops start
[25:06.000 --> 25:13.920]  choking him and then finally finally you see the cop while he's choking him because of the guy
[25:13.920 --> 25:17.600]  would resist if they probably would have just killed him right there i mean i've seen this over
[25:17.600 --> 25:21.600]  and over again remember all the footage of like football players NFL players won't even argue with
[25:21.600 --> 25:25.760]  their big and it scares the cops the cops start pushing them and the guy'll put their hands up
[25:25.760 --> 25:29.360]  they go that's a good threatening and they'll start tasering them i mean this is and then the
[25:29.360 --> 25:32.800]  police come out and defend it there's been all this footage that came out the last two weeks
[25:32.800 --> 25:38.800]  well what about that football player just at what was it it was like two weeks ago he was at he was
[25:38.800 --> 25:45.040]  driving to the hospital because his mother-in-law was dying he had his wife in the car and the cops
[25:45.040 --> 25:48.720]  are just like they they literally pull up to him they're like no you're not going anywhere
[25:48.720 --> 25:53.520]  they didn't get to talk to the mother before she died they're just like no you submit what the guy
[25:53.520 --> 26:00.240]  what about the guy in there was at san marcus where the dog is dying and and and and you know
[26:00.240 --> 26:03.840]  obviously the cop could have said hey sir we still can't speak because they said i don't care about
[26:03.840 --> 26:09.120]  your dog and he has pleasure in his voice listen listen here's the issue we need to create top 10
[26:09.760 --> 26:18.960]  videos of the most outrageous top 10 videos and and and the debate is is this ambulance footage
[26:18.960 --> 26:26.000]  the most outrageous or is it the guy at the jail who is a quadriplegic you can see his legs are
[26:26.000 --> 26:32.640]  totally shriveled up he's paralyzed neck down he's sitting there leaning over in the you know in
[26:34.080 --> 26:40.960]  wheelchair saying i can't move i can't walk i'm paralyzed and the and the jail guard is actually
[26:40.960 --> 26:46.160]  sheriff's deputy's inducting him into the jail they go no you're not and throw him out on the floor
[26:46.160 --> 26:51.360]  for those that don't know him when you've been a quadriplegic for decades your bones and muscles
[26:51.360 --> 26:56.560]  fall apart when he hit the ground multiple muscles pulled bones broke and they're just laughing
[26:56.560 --> 27:01.840]  they just dump him out of the wheelchair he slams on the concrete there's a little celebration a
[27:01.840 --> 27:06.720]  little devil dance you know there's the happy dance well they do a little little devil dance and now
[27:06.720 --> 27:13.040]  they boot kick people in indiana and california and texas these videos are on the news where the
[27:13.040 --> 27:19.520]  suspect they pull guns on they say get on the ground you know and they always say well that was
[27:19.520 --> 27:23.760]  probably a criminal the point is it can happen to any of us and then they run up and boot kick
[27:23.760 --> 27:29.360]  the person in the head and they say oh that's called adjusting the head now that's how we adjust
[27:29.360 --> 27:34.800]  the head the point is they are defending us so i want to create and i want listeners email curtain

[34:48.720 --> 35:05.680]  phone line so we can discuss it on the other side it's 1-800-259-9231 all right hit the clip
[35:19.440 --> 35:20.720]  let me get the car number here
[35:23.760 --> 35:27.440]  so right here he's going around to the back he's trying to get the state troopers license plate
[35:27.440 --> 35:38.640]  number and there it is right there oh hp 606 the oklahoma highway patrol he's walking around to
[35:38.640 --> 35:48.320]  the side here now here's the older gentleman the heading mt over to the side with the police officer
[35:54.800 --> 35:59.280]  you can tell he's pretty upset we're scrolling over now we're getting our first look at the
[35:59.280 --> 36:04.640]  black police officer he's in the back he's in the back he's not even talking to a cop right now
[36:04.640 --> 36:08.320]  and he's actually telling the guy with the cell phone not to cause trouble the guy with the cell
[36:08.320 --> 36:15.680]  phones like look i'm just trying to get this on the record and then he said i'm here to help
[36:15.680 --> 36:21.200]  county out you understand he yells at that first amt now he walks back around as that cop goes over
[36:21.200 --> 36:32.400]  to talk to the mt who's inside do it to mama no ma dukes is in there he's like all right mom
[36:32.400 --> 36:49.040]  we're gonna get you there i promise and there it is and now he's being choked out
[36:49.040 --> 37:02.480]  and the police officer goes inside now to try to calm the woman down he's strapped to a bed now
[37:02.480 --> 37:19.920]  he's being choked out
[37:19.920 --> 37:31.360]  so
[37:31.360 --> 37:35.600]  that guy was about to be under arrest but because he stood up for himself they let him go
[37:36.560 --> 37:43.920]  and now the cops want to be buddy buddy this is out of control folks
[37:43.920 --> 37:51.360]  totally out of control all right pull the clip folks i mean you know alex has a great
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.920]  point because that guy stood up for himself he didn't go to jail that's the bottom line
[37:55.920 --> 38:01.040]  they you heard him you're under arrest you're under arrest this was the guy that was telling
[38:01.040 --> 38:08.160]  the son who had the cell phone camera with him to calm down to not to not cause any trouble
[38:08.160 --> 38:13.440]  but i mean the guy that they picked on to try to arrest was was jack tackler he was a big dude
[38:13.440 --> 38:18.160]  he did not want to be pushed around and you know in the end these the emt officers were
[38:18.160 --> 38:22.320]  let go i can't imagine what they could have done other than speeding to the hospital like they
[38:22.320 --> 38:28.800]  were supposed to yeah the uh entire video is over at info wars dot com right now it's the top story
[38:28.800 --> 38:32.720]  you can't miss it all right let's go to uh linda in california linda you're online
[38:34.480 --> 38:41.040]  yes linda i hey i just watched the uh the video online and i sent it because i have
[38:41.040 --> 38:46.880]  the uh the city councilman and all these uh officials uh so i sent that to everyone with a
[38:46.880 --> 38:53.840]  little note um i took a little mini vacation i noticed all of these polls along the highway
[38:53.840 --> 39:00.400]  two major highways here in california the 215 and the 15 uh large polls they all had they're not
[39:00.400 --> 39:04.640]  call boxes that's what i thought they were at first it was brought to my attention they they've got
[39:04.640 --> 39:13.200]  uh uh large large polls with big boxes solar panels and cameras uh they're located right before
[39:13.200 --> 39:20.560]  every exit and right um right there of every entry i don't know what that has you know have
[39:20.560 --> 39:25.600]  the costing but it's part of the new smart grid i'm sure i mean they are building a smart grid
[39:25.600 --> 39:31.360]  Pelosi i mean uh jones touched on it really briefly uh but the headline is Pelosi appeals for china's
[39:31.360 --> 39:37.280]  help on climate change it's out of the associated press obviously drudge gave it a different headline
[39:37.280 --> 39:41.040]  they made her ultra green because this is all about a green movement that's why you're seeing
[39:41.040 --> 39:45.440]  solar panels now they want to give the illusion that they care about the environment when in fact
[39:45.440 --> 39:50.480]  it's just going to be used as a process to let me let's read it we have so much room for improvement
[39:50.480 --> 39:56.880]  she said every aspect of our lives must be subjected to an inventory or how we are taking
[39:56.880 --> 40:01.520]  responsibility in other words you're going to be paying extra for your suv you're going to be paying
[40:01.520 --> 40:06.320]  extra for your big home you're going to be paying extra for the amount of garbage you have the size
[40:06.320 --> 40:12.480]  of your lawn whether you want a you know to burn wood outside carbon dioxide is the enemy and this
[40:12.480 --> 40:19.520]  woman wants to use it as a reason to catalog our every single move Pelosi the demon i thank you for
[40:19.520 --> 40:27.360]  the call Linda let's go to Mike in Tennessee Mike you're online yes good afternoon on a good note
[40:27.360 --> 40:33.360]  briefly real quick last week there was a sheriff's deputy who was a son of a former prominent Memphis
[40:33.360 --> 40:38.080]  city uh city councilman he was found guilty of second degree murder when he went to a restaurant
[40:38.080 --> 40:42.640]  and couldn't get his truck parked and got out and got into an argument with a guy in the
[40:42.640 --> 40:48.320]  the bartender slash dj came out and tried to break it up and this officer who's off duty
[40:48.320 --> 40:53.280]  he got his gun and shot and just murdered the guy right there in the parking lot for no reason other
[40:53.280 --> 40:58.640]  than he just didn't want to move his vehicle but that guy fortunately was found guilty and uh he
[40:58.640 --> 41:05.520]  will be going to jail but on a on another note um i went to the grand jury to present evidence of
[41:05.520 --> 41:11.840]  crimes committed by police officers last year and uh while i was doing that the jury foreman went
[41:11.840 --> 41:17.680]  and told the da what i was doing and so when i got out of the jury room i was met by two deputies
[41:17.680 --> 41:21.840]  who told me they had a capious for my arrest which was a blank sheet of paper with no signature
[41:22.480 --> 41:28.080]  and uh i said well can i get my my books to my dad who's in the lobby and sure as i'm doing that
[41:28.080 --> 41:32.160]  they come up behind me there's videotape of this and i've got an audio recording of it
[41:32.880 --> 41:38.240]  they say quit resisting quit resisting and slowly start screaming i'm just standing still
[41:38.240 --> 41:43.200]  and then they jump on my back and start choking me of course i just froze i didn't budge but i'm
[41:43.200 --> 41:50.320]  six five i'm a i'm a fairly tall guy and uh but these guys charged me with resisting arrest later
[41:50.320 --> 41:57.040]  that chart was dropped but uh uh the charge of uh get this aggravated kidnapping because i mean
[41:57.040 --> 42:01.920]  they're trying to present evidence to a grand jury is still going forward they have no case
[42:01.920 --> 42:06.640]  because i didn't kidnap anybody but yet that's the way it is and backwards mafia capital of the
[42:06.640 --> 42:11.040]  world tipped in county tennessee yeah well i mean you're not an exclusive case and with this new
[42:11.040 --> 42:15.360]  supreme court decision you know i mean this new orwellian supreme court decision because they
[42:15.360 --> 42:20.800]  say oh you know we're there's certain circumstances now where we're going to be able to interrogate
[42:20.800 --> 42:26.400]  without a lawyer but this doesn't flip the 1966 decision where you can invoke the right of a
[42:26.400 --> 42:31.040]  lawyer but it really does but it doesn't and you know cops are already doing this they're already
[42:31.040 --> 42:35.280]  illegally interrogating people that say i want my lawyer they're already trying to trick people i
[42:35.280 --> 42:39.040]  mean it's it's common knowledge but now they're putting it on paper so that these things can go
[42:39.040 --> 42:44.320]  forward in a court of law and we have even more kangaroo courts and empowered police officers
[42:44.320 --> 42:48.960]  who just become megalomaniacal like you said if you're a cop and you think you can just shoot
[42:48.960 --> 42:54.000]  somebody over a parking space off duty i mean what is in your head man i thank you for the call
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.840]  mike good luck with the case let's go to reb in colorado reb you're online that's good talk to you
[42:59.840 --> 43:06.480]  we're from that group of a scout reb and we were the ones telling you years ago that we had witness
[43:06.480 --> 43:13.200]  tampering done to us by lakewood colorado pd and jefferson county colorado pd and we told you
[43:13.200 --> 43:19.360]  we call them government intruder no intelligence the guinea and we've made better terminology for
[43:19.360 --> 43:24.320]  them and nobody was listening to us back then now you can't have witnesses when you're accused of
[43:24.320 --> 43:29.760]  something because what they did they held the witnesses above and scout hostage and they did
[43:29.760 --> 43:37.520]  they they put these audio transmitters in their apartment and they just criminally intercepted
[43:37.520 --> 43:44.080]  their speech and then they concocted a stupid fake tape and audio i mean they've gone so far
[43:44.080 --> 43:47.920]  right now and you know one of the things that is just amazing to me and i thank you for the call
[43:47.920 --> 43:54.400]  reb is that they have now said in wisconsin a judge has ruled that the police officers without
[43:54.400 --> 44:01.680]  probable cause without a warrant can take a gps tracking device and put it on somebody's car
[44:01.680 --> 44:07.120]  track and trace them doesn't even really have to be part of an investigation and that's okay
[44:07.920 --> 44:12.560]  yet if the average person on the street doesn't you know what it's called it's called stalking
[44:12.560 --> 44:17.760]  and rightfully so but the cops are allowed to do it no warrant no probable cause no big deal
[44:17.760 --> 44:22.800]  with just gps your car track and trace it again this falls into line what they're rolling out saying
[44:22.800 --> 44:28.640]  as everything you do has to be inventory and you know just just a quick hit here uh where is this
[44:28.640 --> 44:34.320]  this is just unbelievable to me but not really rfid uh threat as scientists develop edible tag for
[44:34.320 --> 44:39.920]  pills rfid tags are on uh on packs could be a thing of the past after american scientists
[44:39.920 --> 44:45.920]  revealed an edible tag that can even be used to track and trace and authenticate individual pills
[44:45.920 --> 44:53.440]  you're going to be swallowing tracking devices do you understand the headline if jaren's looking
[44:53.440 --> 44:59.200]  for it out there are rfid threat as scientists develop edible tag for pills so you don't think
[44:59.200 --> 45:04.000]  they want to track and trace everything you do they they haven't built all the infrastructure yet
[45:04.000 --> 45:09.280]  they're slowly building it up but they're telling you we want to track and trace you we want to
[45:09.280 --> 45:14.400]  know what you're doing we want to charge you a carbon tax we want you to be slaves to the
[45:14.400 --> 45:22.160]  police military and now city year and remember dhs is now being swallowed up by the nsa see that
[45:22.160 --> 45:28.320]  the point was to get the public to uh you know get used to the idea of homeland security and we've
[45:28.320 --> 45:33.440]  got to protect the homeland and we need these new domestic agencies and all these terrorists are in
[45:33.440 --> 45:37.680]  our country and they're extremists too and we're going to blur the line and then we're just going
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.880]  to bring it right into the national security apparatus in front of everybody's face well that
[45:42.880 --> 45:46.960]  was a bit of a rant wasn't it actually if you want to hear some really good rants you know
[45:46.960 --> 45:52.160]  not just the jason bermas style of rand but the alex jones rand what better way to do it
[45:52.160 --> 45:59.280]  than alex jones ringtones dot net that's alex jones ringtones dot net i mean i'm sure that
[45:59.280 --> 46:04.800]  that cop one is going to be a ringtone i mean the way to do it folks it's a cheap way to put
[46:04.800 --> 46:08.720]  something on your phone when you're in a public area you're with your family you're on a bus
[46:08.720 --> 46:13.600]  you're in the mall and then all of a sudden your phone starts going off about how 9 11 was an inside
[46:13.600 --> 46:20.960]  job or city year and you know americor are now a front for this new civilian national security
[46:20.960 --> 46:27.360]  force or maybe a rant about the boy scouts becoming militarized to take on homegrown terrorists who
[46:27.360 --> 46:35.120]  just happen to be iraqi veterans back from leave who are disgruntled alex jones ringtones dot net

[46:49.120 --> 46:55.200]  and we don't have to it's going to get a lot worse what's going to happen is we're going to get
[46:55.200 --> 47:01.600]  acclimated to a soviet police state and then we'll say well that's the norm i can't do anything
[47:01.600 --> 47:07.520]  and that's when things are going to get absolute pitch black and they're counting on people to
[47:07.520 --> 47:13.760]  just sit back and take it what you don't understand is if you're a frog that's boiling and still kicking
[47:14.320 --> 47:19.520]  they're just going to turn the heat up when they turn the heat off they're going to have frog legs
[47:19.520 --> 47:25.840]  and guess who's the frog so all i'm saying is people get involved be active doesn't matter
[47:25.840 --> 47:31.760]  really what you do just do something anything just make sure they still have to keep turning

[56:25.120 --> 56:31.760]  you don't like do abstinence programs it's basically just disinformation from my judge for the rest of
[56:31.760 --> 56:36.720]  us to live lives that are so incredibly boring this i mean this was like one of the worst things
[56:36.720 --> 56:40.160]  i've ever seen but it's just goes to show you that you might want to turn off your television
[56:40.160 --> 56:45.360]  because the only thing thing that they're serving you is just pure boredom they say don't live a
[56:45.360 --> 56:50.640]  real life don't own guns don't be a real human being it's insanity so it's really just taking
[56:50.640 --> 56:55.520]  that ultra slave approach where i just do whatever the authorities say and try to live the purest
[56:55.520 --> 57:01.040]  life you possibly can by recycling and driving green and not trying to get in anybody's way or
[57:01.040 --> 57:05.600]  shake things up and towing the party line is that where you're telling me it's that plus they have
[57:05.600 --> 57:10.640]  the whole neighbor spy on you so like oh you don't you you use two gallons of water each day
[57:11.200 --> 57:17.280]  thinner so it's it's kind of like that guilty for wiping your ass thing and if you think i'm
[57:17.280 --> 57:22.160]  joking folks about two months ago uh i think it was either the telegraph or the times online

[57:34.880 --> 57:38.880]  we can't wipe our bottoms anymore shelled and it's out of control i just think it goes to
[57:38.880 --> 57:43.200]  the the idea that the people that are making this rule feel like their crap doesn't stink so
[57:43.200 --> 57:47.680]  they're not going to need to use toilet paper anyways i thank you for the call shelled you

[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:50.080]  you just listened to the video or you saw the video over at the alex jones channel on youtube
[1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:54.400]  map but uh the first guy kind of says yes sir yes sir puts his head down he's not happy
[1:00:55.120 --> 1:00:59.440]  then all of a sudden that cop goes all the way around starts getting in the face of the other
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:03.760]  guy you're under arrest you're under arrest you're under arrest and if he had if he had just said
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:08.400]  i'm under arrest they would have cuffed him and they would have taken him to jail that's how insane
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:12.640]  this whole thing is instead he stood up for himself he had to get choked out but he did not go to
[1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:19.600]  jail i mean what's your take matt my take is is is that for what i can see on on that video i don't
[1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:25.200]  forget jason um you know uh our british cops in front of four thousand people can murder someone
[1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:33.040]  get away with it by the way uh it is uh for my look on it the cop was i think it was petrified
[1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:39.840]  adrenaline kicked in which is totally um so not only disgusting i mean that poor paramedic guy
[1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:45.920]  there i mean he's a big guy uh and and on him and so on in for for defend himself i mean that's
[1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:49.680]  why that happened in this country i mentioned about that that guy that getting murdered in
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:54.720]  london and are you talking about back in uh you know the seven seven bombings a couple days after
[1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:59.680]  where they took the suspect out of the subway car and literally said they shot him once or
[1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:04.720]  twice at first it turned out to be i think either nine or eleven times in front of people executed
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:11.680]  them right there no judge no jury just executioners no i i i'm actually on about the uh i think
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:16.240]  with the gm summit or something not not so long ago in over at the g20 summit so where those people
[1:02:16.240 --> 1:02:21.520]  were murdered that's right yeah but yeah based upon poor man was just walking walking past the
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:27.200]  right what right police and uh basically someone just had a disgruntled day and well matt don't
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:33.360]  you understand man cops in black uniforms with batons and masks on their face that shoot you
[1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:38.800]  with shotguns with beanbags are good people they love us we should we should institute it everywhere

[1:02:53.200 --> 1:03:00.080]  domestic lexicon document from a dhs who loves us so much give me a break all right roger in
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:05.920]  minnesota you're on the line sir yes i have a couple quick things first of all the prisoners
[1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:12.960]  at montan will be i'm trying to figure out um i believe i have nine levels inside job but why
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:18.720]  are all these prisoners there what's what's the world's unique purpose and in robbing uh you
[1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:24.720]  ever heard of a documentary called crazy rulers of the world all right check out there's a it's
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:29.760]  a three-part doc and it's kind of goofy uh the second part is all about uh these prisons
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:34.800]  guantanamo bay abu grave sensory deprivation they're slave camps they're mk ultra camps
[1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:40.560]  they're an extension of you know what they can get away with their their sensory deprivation centers
[1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:44.880]  for human beings where they're doing studies i mean that is literally what these things are
[1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:49.520]  let me give you for instance what goes on publicly at some of these things other than the rapes and
[1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:53.920]  the torture and all that disgusting stuff they want to see how far they can take it they have
[1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:58.800]  these people with bags over their heads they have mittens over their hands and arms they are fully
[1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:03.280]  clothed so in other words they don't have the same sense of touch as you and i so those those
[1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:10.000]  senses are gone then they are deprived of sunlight then on top of that they pump in music right and
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:14.080]  they decide what kind of music they pump when they were uh actually recording you know what they had
[1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:21.280]  on a loop they had barney i love you you love me we're a happy family on loop for hours and hours
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:26.720]  on end if that doesn't sound like psychological warfare or a scyop experiment i don't know what
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:30.720]  is let me give you another instance they say oh we're going to close down guantanamo bay now
[1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:33.440]  they're not going to let the prisoners go but they're not even going to do that they're not
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:39.840]  closing gitmo they just signed a bill's appropriation for 83 billion dollars to continue the wars in

[1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:50.640]  and serve to authorities to militant crazies with guns that are on power trips all right let's go
[1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:59.120]  to chad new york chad you're online jason how are you good i actually got some good news to report
[1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:06.640]  um i'm here in albany and if you remember uh two months ago uh caller called in about uh they're
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:12.640]  proposing a law that would require registering all ammunition ammunition yes i do well tuesday night
[1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:19.040]  they finally had the public hearing on that and there was a big protest out front of second
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:26.240]  amendment supporters and excellent about 50 to 80 people spoken and against that stupid law
[1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:30.720]  well wait wait are you telling me that people can make a difference if they actually do something
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:37.440]  if they stand up for their rights that's a foreign idea sir go ahead well of course the news shows
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:43.360]  the the two guys out of the 80 that actually were saying well if you got nothing to hide where do
[1:09:43.360 --> 1:09:48.640]  you afraid of that's what they always do you know we were playing a clip last night on my
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:54.160]  program of mark dice talking about angels and demons and they just pull someone off the the
[1:09:54.160 --> 1:09:59.920]  street and uh you know it's some 19-year-old kid in a backpack and they're like that sounds crazy
[1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:04.080]  the Illuminati are behind things meanwhile he just heard about the Illuminati for the first time
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:08.400]  two weeks ago in a preview of another movie and he was going to see the movie this time he has no
[1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:13.440]  idea the true roots of the Illuminati and what they're all about but that's crazy conspiracy
[1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:19.280]  theories you ain't got nothing to hide register all your ammunition take a microchip come on
[1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:26.400]  what's wrong with the real idea go ahead the other good news is um i i remember in wisconsin
[1:10:26.400 --> 1:10:32.160]  there was a court case about police put gps on a we reported on it yet again today but let's let's
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:37.760]  just review it for new listeners what happened was a judge ruled that without a warrant without
[1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:43.600]  probable cause police officers could fit a vehicle with a gps say it's part of an investigation
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:48.320]  doesn't really have to be track and trace that person and that's okay that's all right it's not a
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:51.520]  doesn't break the fourth amendment of course it breaks the fourth amendment but it doesn't
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:54.960]  break the fourth amendment of course it breaks the fourth amendment but it doesn't break the fourth
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:11:00.480]  amendment and then it was so weird because uh this week somebody else did it here in new york
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:06.480]  yeah well they ruled that here in new york well we had almost the exact same case here in albany
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:14.000]  of police did that and it went to the new york state supreme court or a court of appeals but
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:21.120]  here they actually ruled no the police cannot do that they do need a search warrant for gps
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:25.360]  of course they'd otherwise it's stalking and that's why they just charged someone in wisconsin
[1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:29.600]  who wasn't a police officer and did that with stalking because what it is is stalking
[1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:34.720]  i mean it's out of control you got anything else for me chat yeah for all the listeners out there
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:41.760]  they can see the actual tv news on my youtube channel at youtube.com slash the angry news nerd
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:48.880]  the angry news nerd and is that with a z nope just uh just a regular s and that's the albany
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:53.600]  thing right the albany ammunition yep and if you go there right now it's up it's the main video
[1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:59.200]  plus the one about the uh court scene in gps and just really quick uh you remember a couple months
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:05.040]  ago about schenectady thinking about considering marshal law yeah um i can't confirm this but it
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:09.440]  it doesn't look like it's gonna happen because they would need consent of the other towns to
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:14.320]  dissolve their police department and none of the other towns want to do that so well it's
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:19.600]  unnecessary gonna happen it's i'm i'm glad it's not gonna happen because i was just there uh a
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:24.560]  little over a month ago i drove through schenectady schenectady the last thing it needs is marshal law
[1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:30.400]  what it needs is a little bit of growth in the economy some decent jobs and a non-corrupt police
[1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:34.640]  force that's all it needs get the crack heads off the streets god forbid we try to do that before
[1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:40.240]  we implement military dictatorships via marshal law thank you for the call chat and now actually i'm
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:46.960]  gonna go check that out uh man i already forgot the website but i am it to me or email it to me
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:50.960]  over at myspace.com slash jason bermus we're gonna do a story about that one because that really
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:56.080]  needs to be talked about especially with such a good showing of people resisting registering your
[1:12:56.080 --> 1:13:03.120]  ammunition all right let's go to marine in arizona marine you're online hi thanks so much for taking
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:07.440]  my call i'm so glad i got through and what i wanted to share with that i've been reading a history
[1:13:07.440 --> 1:13:13.760]  book on the making of america and the substantive constitution the substance and meaning of the
[1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:20.720]  constitution and i found it so interesting because um you know what we have going on right now is a
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:26.800]  parallel to rulers law and it's a parallel to the conditions for the revolution of you know the
[1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:33.600]  united states in the first place it's amazing to read this stuff because it's almost exactly what
[1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:39.760]  was going on well absolutely and now and beyond that and not only you know is it exactly what's
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:46.480]  going on when we had to revolt against british rule but if you look at niomi wolf's work especially
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:51.680]  her new documentary it's not really that new but the end of america it shows you how this is an
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:58.160]  implementation through incrementalization and compartmentalization over time to get you accustomed
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:02.800]  to these ideas and then all of a sudden you're under a tyrannical dictatorship and she shows you
[1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:09.600]  that with soviet russia she shows you that with of course the nazis and we are really unfortunately
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:14.800]  and really disgracefully the modern day nazis and i am not proud to say that or think that but
[1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:19.840]  that's what the evidence shows i thank you for the call marina i gotta jump let's go to don in texas
[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:26.880]  don you're online oh hi there yeah i'll say uh i was uh first of all i was gonna say i didn't know
[1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:33.040]  a bunch of cops and uh they're they're the good ones and the bad ones absolutely and uh the ones
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:37.760]  that are good kind of have a sad look on their face and they kind of you know look like you know
[1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:44.000]  they stick in there and i'm not a cop at all but i mean i've been had to deal with them quite a bit
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:49.280]  and uh they they try to benefit you and everything like that there are some of them that are brainwashed
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:53.440]  and and you know if you're getting a copy going out kind of you know kind of make me scared to
[1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:58.800]  be around i'd be defensive and i might want to like it's an enemy i've tacked back anything
[1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:05.280]  and then you know they get kind of a uh they get kind of a syndrome of uh uh that they're a powerful
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:13.360]  you know you know kind of like a roman roman uh you know uh maestro and uh but what i called about
[1:15:13.360 --> 1:15:19.440]  was that you know the uh koreans are trying to bump up or you know appear to be pumping up trying to
[1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:25.520]  start a skirmish or you know a minor war you know they're putting out this uh you know information
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:30.560]  yes we are doing nuclear testing yes we don't like our neighbors they they have these military
[1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:34.720]  shows all over who knows where this is going to go there's i think they're being manipulated the
[1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:39.680]  same as in the united states by the southern poverty and abl i think it's all manipulated
[1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:45.280]  and i think if if they create a uh uh uh what looks like you know also in pakistan if there's a
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:51.120]  couple of real major skirmishes there they look like a big time deal then israel can go and uh
[1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:57.360]  whack the hell out of iran and the only reason they do that is so they would maintain supremacy
[1:15:57.360 --> 1:16:04.320]  you know diminish the uh neighbors to the point of uh poverty and uh a weakness and uh furthering
[1:16:04.320 --> 1:16:11.120]  in in in you know grab uh grab territory great points great points don i thank you for the call
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:15.040]  yes we are uh i think they just said that there was a huge thing with israel and united states
[1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:20.400]  backing them on these missiles uh i reported on it last night i don't have the uh don't have the
[1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:24.720]  article in front of me but basically we're just going to pledge some more money to israel doesn't
[1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:29.120]  matter if even the un which is an organization i don't like you know admits that yeah they're
[1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:33.680]  annexing a bunch of land down there yes there is genocide going down on the goddess of strip and
[1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:38.720]  this was an internal memo in the un and oh no big deal we'll just keep funding the wars in the middle
[1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:46.160]  east for our eurasian union whether it be to israel or in the war in afghanistan or the war in iraq
[1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:49.600]  and i've got you know one of the stories i don't know if i have it in front of me but there seems
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:57.600]  to be i think fort campbell is actually shutting down uh for a couple of weeks to educate um soldiers
[1:16:57.600 --> 1:17:01.360]  about suicide because they're having such high suicide rates i think they said something like
[1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:07.200]  since uh in the last three months 22 confirmed but there's 56 cases that they're investigating so
[1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:14.160]  up to 56 cases of uh suicides in the military i think on that basis it's something out of control
[1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:20.960]  that's averaging something like one a week so i mean i can't even imagine i'm glad i'm not in the
[1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:26.960]  military i'm glad i'm not a police officer because to be around you know like you said there are
[1:17:26.960 --> 1:17:32.560]  good cops and there are bad cops but to be around and have to socialize and fraternize with that
[1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:38.320]  amount of corrupt individuals and people that aren't even just corrupt they're on power trips
[1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:44.720]  and they feel it's okay to put emt officers in choke holds after they delay them from saving a
[1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:52.560]  woman's life is out of control jordan england you're on the air hi jennison um you might remember

[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:46.240]  the lead democrat the initial congressional investigation into nine eleven she's the one
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:49.680]  that said oh we're going to get out of the war we're going to really take this administration
[1:24:49.680 --> 1:24:54.080]  to task and then as soon as she was elected in 2006 and became the speaker of the house so
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:57.360]  war crimes are off the table we're really not going to get out of the war what we're going to
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:00.720]  do is we're going to push somebody who says we're going to get out of the war but then we're not
[1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:07.520]  going to get out of the war that's how i roll see i'm a politician i lie to you i get off on it i like

[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:50.400]  let's go to bobbin florida bobby on the air hey um you guys are great i listen to you every day but
[1:25:50.400 --> 1:25:55.040]  you're not correct about everything uh i was watching that video and i don't know why they
[1:25:55.600 --> 1:25:59.680]  were going to arrest them i don't know why they stopped them i don't know why the police did
[1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:08.560]  anything but the physical uh stuff did not start until the uh emt pushed away the policemen
[1:26:08.560 --> 1:26:14.000]  hold on let me let me stop you though they put their hands on him to arrest him right right
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:18.240]  they said hold on they said you're under arrest you're under arrest they grabbed his arm they put
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:22.560]  it behind the back that's when the physicality started but if he had not stood up for himself
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:27.600]  if he hadn't pushed the mtl or the police officer off he went to jail that's my point if he didn't
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:32.000]  stand up for himself at that point say i didn't do anything wrong and he was a big dude he was bigger
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:37.040]  than any of the cops i've said that off the bat go watch it again they say you're under arrest
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:41.520]  you're under arrest they take his arm they pull it back that's when the altercation starts they
[1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:45.760]  touch his arm first to arrest him they do tell him he's under arrest it's not like they come out and
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:50.560]  beat him outright he then pushes off and then all of a sudden the altercation happens and they've
[1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:54.880]  got his one of the cops has the hand around his neck and you could tell one of the cops in the
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:58.160]  background doesn't want anything to do with this but eventually they don't even charge him with
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:02.080]  anything so obviously he didn't do anything to run up to the arrest and if you remember
[1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:07.840]  watch the video again he's the guy telling the son whose cell phone is on filming not to cause
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:12.560]  any trouble let's just get through this so i think he was just at his hairs and when they
[1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:19.840]  tried to arrest him can i say something sure thing it did not start until he pushed the cops
[1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:26.240]  hand away that's resisting arrest yeah but again yeah but again resisting water water
[1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:32.560]  but listen but resisting what arrest the arrest never eventually happened because the guy hadn't
[1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:37.680]  done anything he was under false arrest at that point and i gotta say i'm happy he stood up for
[1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:43.200]  himself otherwise he would have been in the jail cell the guy's a paramedic his his place was in
[1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:48.160]  the back of that ambulance with that woman no man i don't know whether she had a heart attack
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:52.720]  what she was in there for all i know is that the uh the husband of that woman was freaking out
[1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:56.800]  the son did the right thing with the cell phone and ultimately i really do believe i mean the guy
[1:27:56.800 --> 1:28:01.840]  never swung at the cops you know he did push the guy's arm away and he could have swung at the cops
[1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:07.520]  let me tell you that guy was a bull i mean you saw him he was a big big dude so i you know let
[1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:11.920]  you have your peace i'm gonna have to disagree with you i don't think that they should have even
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:17.040]  said he was under arrest but did he initiate the contact no they grabbed his arm he did push them
[1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:23.520]  away which could be interpreted as resisting an arrest but what arrest is he resisting obviously
[1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:29.280]  not a lawful and just one all right let's go to joe in pennsylvania joe you're on the air

[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:25.920]  by the officer that said you're under arrest now if he had really done something and he was
[1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:30.960]  quote unquote under arrest he would end up going to jail and even if he didn't because you know jack

[1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:34.000]  the guy started the physical contact when in fact you know this guy was was the guy who was telling
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.640]  the sun to you know maybe cool out and not cell phone and he's like look i'm just trying to get
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:43.040]  evidence for you guys and he said okay he was inside with the woman then they come around and
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:47.760]  they say you're under arrest you're under arrest then they grab the guy the guy pushes them away
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:54.240]  and it was only through this physical altercation that he wasn't taken to jail alex well you know
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:59.200]  this is the problem with our society is that and the same thing happened at lurch germany the same
[1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:04.640]  thing happened in the sub union the people make excuses for it so before i recap the story and
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:11.120]  give you new developments i want to just go back here and explain something having cameras in public
[1:36:11.120 --> 1:36:18.240]  school bathrooms and in the classrooms isn't freedom having the police with paramilitary units
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:23.040]  in black uniforms and ski masks isn't freedom having a warrantless wire tapping against the
[1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:27.360]  american people which they lied about and now admit that they do do and do against everybody
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:33.680]  is it freedom having children raped and tortured in front of their parents which is declassified
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:39.520]  army's own documents we've been reporting it for four years it's now mainstream news confirming
[1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:46.640]  what we said four years ago raping children the army's own report admits this and i get threatening
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:53.200]  emails going you're a jihadist loving al-qaeda lover well you know if al-qaeda was raping children
[1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:58.320]  and wasn't cia i'd actually want to find them you know the point is is that this sick mental
[1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:02.960]  attitude of we're going to go ahead and rape children in front of their parents because
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:08.720]  this is how we beat al-qaeda even if you believe al-qaeda exist outside of mi6 massad and cia
[1:37:10.160 --> 1:37:15.440]  is the height of evil and they've already been totally compromised psychologically and they've
[1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:21.440]  committed that you know to the fact that this is okay when the police shot that young man who was
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:30.160]  in handcuffs in the back a few months ago on the subway train platform in the bay area of california
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:37.760]  outside oakland people defended it and said the witnesses are lying he hit the police and attacked
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:42.640]  them and and then it turned out the witnesses weren't lying the police had taken all their camera
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:49.440]  phones that claimed that the cameras weren't uh working there that the government ran on the
[1:37:49.440 --> 1:37:56.960]  platform and but thank god a train had been driving by and had uh had someone in it with a
[1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:01.680]  camera phone who videotaped the whole thing start to finish he was in handcuffs submitting it's it's
[1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:08.880]  the whole video they grab him up start shaking him slamming down on the ground he's totally
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:14.800]  submitting to them but see that's the next level of this religion then he's shot in the back and
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:20.560]  then beat up and so it came out people still defended the police just like they defended
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:26.720]  that off hitler and so uh again ladies and gentlemen it has become a religion to worship
[1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:32.560]  government worship the military and worship police and anytime that happens what we now witness
[1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:38.480]  unfolds but for those that don't know as if you think it could be any worse that this ambulance
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:45.360]  is carrying a sick woman her son is following in his car he sees a state trooper in the
[1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:55.760]  state of Oklahoma pull the ambulance over he gets out he's at a distance videotaping the gods
[1:38:55.760 --> 1:39:03.360]  who are videotaping us constantly and with his first amendment they run over and the EMTs
[1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:07.600]  start saying we're an ambulance we're just driving and they don't see the cops in like being
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:10.880]  questioned you don't question god you don't as a reasonable human being
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:20.000]  we're gonna get him back and while we're waiting for him to get back we're going to play the clip
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:27.440]  right now for prisonplanet.tv viewers check it out start to finish here we go you got it jaren hit the
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:39.280]  clip
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:06.520]  And for people watching swinging around to get the license plate number of the original
[1:40:06.520 --> 1:40:14.040]  officer of the highway patrol that did pull them over and right now the patrolman is over
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:37.120]  there talking to the driver and we're about to get a shot of that all right so not to
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:41.760]  get involved this is the guy that's attacked by the police officers saying not to get involved
[1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:59.880]  and right there you can see the unhappy driver kind of cowing down the police officer he
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:11.400]  just wants to get on the road now here it looks like they think they're gonna be on
[1:41:11.400 --> 1:41:13.480]  their way but this is where the outrageousness happens
[1:41:41.400 --> 1:42:10.060]  and there it goes
[1:42:10.060 --> 1:42:27.920]  and they're getting in his face and they choke him out so he doesn't stand up to his
[1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:33.880]  masters and he goes to jail this is insane we have Alex back yet already dropped off

[1:42:52.380 --> 1:42:58.140]  situation when you have this kind of mentality and you know that brings me to this article
[1:42:58.140 --> 1:43:06.740]  right here talk about just insulting people of any sort of intelligence u.s. news and
[1:43:06.740 --> 1:43:12.260]  world report has done the inner worlds of conspiracy believers now it's another Johnny
[1:43:12.260 --> 1:43:20.060]  nonsense and technological term to say everybody who believes the 9-11 wasn't what the government
[1:43:20.060 --> 1:43:25.780]  the media said is crazy they're not jobs shortly after the terrorist attacks destroyed the
[1:43:25.780 --> 1:43:30.580]  world trade center and mangled the Pentagon on September 11th 2001 remember terrorist
[1:43:30.580 --> 1:43:36.580]  attacks it's always terrorist attacks and really these were terrorists but their government
[1:43:36.580 --> 1:43:43.060]  terrorists there they're not you know Muslims in a cave I hate to tell you that the Muslims
[1:43:43.060 --> 1:43:49.740]  in caves that were used in this quote unquote attack were not in caves they had links to
[1:43:49.740 --> 1:43:55.020]  military intelligence some of them had their IDs their drivers licenses saying that they
[1:43:55.020 --> 1:44:02.380]  were living at the Pensacola Navy station in Florida okay so I mean just off the bat
[1:44:02.380 --> 1:44:07.980]  totalize conspiracy theories blossomed about secret and malevolent government plots behind
[1:44:07.980 --> 1:44:12.940]  the tragic events and these are not so secret anymore I mean if you look at the drills that
[1:44:12.940 --> 1:44:17.860]  were going on that day you know they just released another drill operation jackal cave the entire
[1:44:17.860 --> 1:44:23.020]  thing is almost blacked out you look at Apollo guardian northern guardian northern vigilance
[1:44:23.020 --> 1:44:27.660]  the NRO drill where they were ramming a plane to a building at 845 in the morning with John
[1:44:27.660 --> 1:44:32.620]  Fulton and his team from the CIA all this came out in the mainstream media there was
[1:44:32.620 --> 1:44:39.820]  mass armageddon exercises going on that morning hijacking drills I mean those are the plots
[1:44:39.820 --> 1:44:45.820]  unfortunately there was a somehow on the news wire in in uh what was it uh it went out I
[1:44:45.820 --> 1:44:51.820]  think on a Reuters news wire it was that uh building seven had come down 20 20 plus minutes
[1:44:51.820 --> 1:44:58.940]  before it had I mean come on what this is all coincidence oh yes the the muslim terrorists
[1:44:58.940 --> 1:45:03.580]  were able to do all those things jason and blow up building seven a report scheduled
[1:45:03.580 --> 1:45:08.140]  to appear in an upcoming applied cognitive psychology offers a preliminary psychological
[1:45:08.140 --> 1:45:15.980]  profile of people who believe in 9 11 conspiracies a team led by psychologist viran swami of the
[1:45:15.980 --> 1:45:21.660]  university of west minsta in london identified several traits associated with subscribing
[1:45:21.660 --> 1:45:26.940]  to 9 11 conspiracies at least among british citizens these characteristics consist of
[1:45:26.940 --> 1:45:32.700]  backing one or more conspiracy theories unrelated to 9 11 see the people that are hip to 9 11
[1:45:32.700 --> 1:45:37.980]  are hip to the fact that guy was murdered are hip to the fact that 7 7 was an inside job
[1:45:38.540 --> 1:45:42.220]  are hip to the fact that these guys are criminals they're hip to the fact that the
[1:45:42.220 --> 1:45:48.460]  builder group does exist that mi5 is corrupt that cia is corrupt that they've been caught
[1:45:48.460 --> 1:45:54.140]  that there is an international intelligence organization that runs the drugs and pulls
[1:45:54.140 --> 1:45:59.500]  off a thing called black ops see black ops aren't fairy tales and unicorns folks they're reality
[1:46:00.300 --> 1:46:05.820]  real i'm sorry that you can't handle reality i'm sorry you can't put on your big boy pants
[1:46:05.820 --> 1:46:11.580]  and own up so we just watched that clip there's no doubt that if the man had not said no you're
[1:46:11.580 --> 1:46:16.780]  not going to arrest me after they grabbed him the lords would have taken taken him to the
[1:46:16.780 --> 1:46:23.180]  internment camps even though he's an emt trying to help a sick woman alex yes jason it's the
[1:46:23.180 --> 1:46:28.780]  craziest thing a little uh hotel i met on vacation my family their phones aren't working the genesis
[1:46:28.780 --> 1:46:34.460]  phones are completely dead luckily we have a backup but that's dead half the time i definitely want
[1:46:34.460 --> 1:46:39.580]  to put the order in now for the five landlines at the office i've i've really had enough of
[1:46:39.580 --> 1:46:44.700]  computer-based t1 stuff so i want mic and them i'm just saying it on air maybe it'll happen
[1:46:44.700 --> 1:46:51.420]  i want five regular phone lines into the board ordered today oh a side issue i just it's unbelievable
[1:46:51.420 --> 1:46:57.020]  the phone systems everywhere it's just endless problem all right hopefully i can get back on
[1:46:57.020 --> 1:47:03.020]  at the point that i was in the talk you were just saying he would have been taken to the fema camp
[1:47:03.020 --> 1:47:09.820]  he is being taken to the fema camp that's the whole issue i'm on the website of the local
[1:47:09.820 --> 1:47:23.740]  oklahoma station ktul ktul the local news station has the headline that emt could face charges
[1:47:23.740 --> 1:47:29.900]  after incident with prooper it's and they're saying on the site the police were good to pull over
[1:47:30.940 --> 1:47:37.260]  the uh the ambulance uh that that that's just a little safety courtesy that that that's totally
[1:47:37.260 --> 1:47:41.820]  normal just like when they boot kick someone who's not resisting almost kill them or put the kid in
[1:47:41.820 --> 1:47:46.380]  the coma the police chief went on the news and said this is good get him play that clip out of
[1:47:46.380 --> 1:47:51.180]  Seattle he said we'll do it again you know we'll kill you and then they said he ran which by the way
[1:47:51.180 --> 1:47:55.900]  he didn't police just can run up some guy totally innocent they admit and he's in a coma his life
[1:47:55.900 --> 1:48:00.140]  probably over hey that's the way it goes and the government's gonna take your bank accounts too
[1:48:00.140 --> 1:48:04.460]  it'll be all like it you know the paramilitary is going to kill you that's the system we live on her
[1:48:04.460 --> 1:48:10.620]  so they love setting this precedent so he is going to probably lose his emt license his life is
[1:48:10.620 --> 1:48:15.100]  probably over and the cops won't care they won't care he loses his job they won't care he loses
[1:48:15.100 --> 1:48:20.860]  everybody probably his own this is about killing freedom this is about setting a precedent of
[1:48:20.860 --> 1:48:27.980]  we will pull an ambulance over we will rough you up and you will not do anything to the gods and
[1:48:27.980 --> 1:48:34.060]  then that's not enough we will take your job we will take your house we will take everything you've
[1:48:34.060 --> 1:48:42.140]  got because we are god we rule you we will take your 14.8 trillion to give it to offshore banks
[1:48:42.140 --> 1:48:47.980]  we will shoot your kids up with mercury till they die we will GMO your food we are tyranny
[1:48:47.980 --> 1:48:54.140]  this is the this is the religion of worshiping tyranny and always pressing on the nerve of power
[1:48:54.860 --> 1:48:58.060]  and i'm telling you i know a lot of police are nice because i've been in car wrecks and had
[1:48:58.060 --> 1:49:03.980]  nice cop show up but these are mentally ill roid heads these are the people that will inherit the
[1:49:03.980 --> 1:49:09.180]  earth these are the people replacing our old police the military this is what it's turned into
[1:49:09.180 --> 1:49:14.780]  so this is the incredible thing after they try to keep this these men from rendering aid after
[1:49:14.780 --> 1:49:23.980]  they pull over an ambulance with a woman in serious condition when the emt's dare argue with literal
[1:49:23.980 --> 1:49:31.020]  god and this is right of kings this is divine rulership this is because if the federal government
[1:49:31.020 --> 1:49:36.460]  has the fear of precepts of above the law then all of their minions do and this is the nature of
[1:49:36.460 --> 1:49:40.780]  tyranny and so america they're going to take our property they're going to raise our taxes
[1:49:40.780 --> 1:49:45.980]  they're going to micromanage every facet of our lives as nancy polosi said in beijing the ap reporting
[1:49:45.980 --> 1:49:50.700]  saying everything will do will be categorized everything you do will be tracked everything
[1:49:50.700 --> 1:49:54.220]  is about this new rigidity environment has nothing to do with the environment it's about
[1:49:54.220 --> 1:50:01.260]  total control and you understand it's not enough they did this to these emt emt could face charges
[1:50:01.260 --> 1:50:04.380]  after instant with trooper and what they'll do is they'll say if you'll come out and make your
[1:50:04.380 --> 1:50:08.780]  wrong and say you're bad and say it's normal they have police pull over an ambulance and rough you
[1:50:08.780 --> 1:50:15.180]  up for no reason if you come out and bow to the idol bow and worship tyranny then we might drop
[1:50:15.180 --> 1:50:20.460]  charges on you but then see then next time it won't even matter soon they'll just be executing
[1:50:20.460 --> 1:50:24.540]  us on the side of the street and they'll show it on the news and have people literally and in
[1:50:24.540 --> 1:50:32.620]  priest robes bowing down and worshiping it this is how charity works and so uh i mean it's just
[1:50:32.620 --> 1:50:41.100]  unbelievable ladies and gentlemen it is unbelievable alex and i mean the video speaks for itself
[1:50:41.100 --> 1:50:46.620]  this is a guy who was just trying to take a woman to the hospital the husband frantic on the side
[1:50:46.620 --> 1:50:52.060]  trying to make sure that his wife is okay a son frantic taking cell phone video because it's the

[1:54:15.900 --> 1:54:23.820]  are just discussing this latest disgusting piece of police tragedy really i mean when you have a
[1:54:23.820 --> 1:54:28.540]  police force that is this hell bent on power that says we are the authorities that they will pull
[1:54:28.540 --> 1:54:35.980]  over an ambulance and try to forcefully arrest a man who is again attending to a very ill woman
[1:54:35.980 --> 1:54:41.580]  you have a society that is beyond corrupt that is beyond the pale it's it's just shocking alex
[1:54:41.580 --> 1:54:48.780]  but burmese i mean well burmese as bad as that is it's nothing compared to that they're in the news
[1:54:48.780 --> 1:54:55.340]  local tv defending the cops you ought to pull that clip up saying that i probably go ahead and charge
[1:54:55.340 --> 1:55:02.460]  the guy who has these this cop in his face like an attack dog because he's trying to attend a woman
[1:55:03.340 --> 1:55:08.380]  with her frantic son there in i mean this is insane these people aren't saying but then
[1:55:08.380 --> 1:55:15.500]  then they come out and say no you're insane we're saying it's a crime to even talk back to us when
[1:55:15.500 --> 1:55:20.380]  you're trying to help someone in the back of an ambulance and then he gets more insane because
[1:55:20.380 --> 1:55:26.860]  people email and call us saying we're bad because all they do is sit there you know literally
[1:55:26.860 --> 1:55:34.460]  groveling at the feet of the police state folks but people defend on national tv torture of people's
[1:55:34.460 --> 1:55:41.340]  wives and children in front of them they admit would shake uh uh muhammad with with uh that guy
[1:55:41.340 --> 1:55:46.620]  that they tortured his kids to get him to come out and confess to bombing buildings that weren't
[1:55:46.620 --> 1:55:53.100]  built till three years after he was in prison so so my whole point is is that is this is the
[1:55:53.100 --> 1:55:59.020]  globalist or psychiatrist that's who they mainly use and this is meant to make everything so crazy
[1:55:59.020 --> 1:56:03.900]  we feel like we're crazy if you like if you came home and some psychopath filled your life and get
[1:56:03.900 --> 1:56:08.940]  and had intestines wrapped around their neck with a dinner table set up with your chopped up family
[1:56:08.940 --> 1:56:13.420]  and you walk in and you say i you know i think you're crazy scum and they say you're the one that's
[1:56:13.420 --> 1:56:17.820]  crazy as they sit there eating your wife's eyeballs in front of you you know they're openly
[1:56:17.820 --> 1:56:23.580]  stealing everything they're openly setting up youth brigades but it's even crazier half the public
[1:56:23.580 --> 1:56:30.220]  says the youth brigade don't exist as it shows them in military uniforms marching on national tv
[1:56:30.220 --> 1:56:35.900]  ads the public says it's not real as the borders implode they say it's not real as cia aircraft
[1:56:35.900 --> 1:56:39.660]  crash full of cocaine it's admitted they're shipping the coke and people just say well that's
[1:56:39.660 --> 1:56:45.660]  good still put people in jail if they use government cocaine i mean well i just can't
[1:56:45.660 --> 1:56:52.140]  take it anymore bermas to watch this video of these insane demons and then they're not going to get
[1:56:52.140 --> 1:57:00.060]  in trouble the emt is i mean it's just it's totally insane but it there's a method to the madness
[1:57:00.060 --> 1:57:06.300]  crazy like a fox the establishment knows that they could set a precedent to to to torture
[1:57:06.300 --> 1:57:12.060]  children and say that that's mom and apple pie and say we're crisis because we're not for torturing
[1:57:12.060 --> 1:57:18.220]  children they can do anything and they have we are a nation that accepted killing 50 plus million
[1:57:18.220 --> 1:57:22.860]  babies and said it was murder or a nation that accepted having a private fellow reserve that
[1:57:22.860 --> 1:57:28.060]  controls us and set the precedent for that we're a nation that has accepted federal domination
[1:57:28.060 --> 1:57:33.100]  or a nation that has accepted more and more until the public has just capitulated and the
[1:57:33.100 --> 1:57:38.860]  establishment is standing over us urinating on us marking their territory slapping us in the face
[1:57:38.860 --> 1:57:44.380]  rubbing it in saying isn't that right slave isn't that right slave and i tell you spirit of liberty

[2:00:39.980 --> 2:00:45.980]  on the line discussing the latest police madness up at info wars dot com i mean you have to see
[2:00:45.980 --> 2:00:51.820]  it to believe it the thugs are on the loose alex but i go back to the hundreds of other cases
[2:00:52.940 --> 2:00:57.100]  where they walk up and say somebody a hundred yards away can't video cops and then knock their
[2:00:57.100 --> 2:01:04.860]  teeth out or a cop comes up to kids playing with a toy car and they eat and the cop starts stomping
[2:01:04.860 --> 2:01:10.380]  it and beating little twelve-year-olds up and then the vote says yes they're going to charge the
[2:01:10.380 --> 2:01:16.700]  four-year-olds for assaulting the cop and it's on it's on paper some 260 pound cop beats up
[2:01:16.700 --> 2:01:21.660]  12-year-old pothead i mean i mean i've seen thousands of these videos i can't even i mean
[2:01:21.660 --> 2:01:27.820]  every millisecond a new video i remember saying pops into my head where they're hiring every scumbag
[2:01:27.820 --> 2:01:32.940]  every thug every control freak and if the cops get a worse and worse image the good cops are
[2:01:32.940 --> 2:01:39.900]  leaving and pure scum and filth and mentally ill trash who thinks it's normal to stop an ambulance
[2:01:39.900 --> 2:01:43.580]  i mean i'm reading the mainstream news articles about this out of oklahoma and they're saying the
[2:01:43.580 --> 2:01:49.580]  officer does a great job they're saying this is totally normal they're saying that ambulances
[2:01:49.580 --> 2:01:56.940]  shouldn't speed they're saying that the that the emd needs to go to jail i mean this is mental illness
[2:01:56.940 --> 2:02:03.100]  this is this is total and complete insanity and and you know that's why i'm ranting and raving
[2:02:03.100 --> 2:02:08.460]  even behind the scenes i appreciate the great crew and everybody out there who is trying to
[2:02:08.460 --> 2:02:12.700]  help us get the word out on this but but i mean to think about how they covered up how they shot
[2:02:12.700 --> 2:02:18.540]  that kid in the back and then we finally get the video and they're beating him up if he dies for
[2:02:18.540 --> 2:02:23.980]  no reason the cop shoots him in the back and then pros of fit that he shot him in the back
[2:02:23.980 --> 2:02:28.780]  thinking oh i'm gonna get in trouble for this so he slams his head in the ground and stomps on him
[2:02:28.780 --> 2:02:34.940]  i mean this is what our daddy is wrong to murder someone in cold blood it's wrong to rape children
[2:02:34.940 --> 2:02:39.340]  in front of their parents it's wrong to have foreign bankers and the federal reserve on tv
[2:02:39.340 --> 2:02:44.060]  saying they're above the law i know that sounds radical and extreme to some of you it's because
[2:02:44.060 --> 2:02:50.620]  you're under mind control you know this is brainwashing i assure some new listeners out there
[2:02:50.620 --> 2:02:57.100]  it's not normal to have police murder people and then cover it up it's not normal to have a police
[2:02:57.100 --> 2:03:03.260]  state it's not normal to have a new world order in carbon taxes it's not normal to have this is
[2:03:03.260 --> 2:03:08.540]  not good this is horrible this is wrong and everybody just stays in their houses watching
[2:03:08.540 --> 2:03:14.060]  their tv shows being conditioned that all of this is normal and acceptable i mean vermin
[2:03:14.060 --> 2:03:18.380]  what do you think about the fact that and and you open the phones up with rockwell and then
[2:03:18.380 --> 2:03:23.660]  a tower because we can open up our own phone systems genesis is down uh the perennial problems
[2:03:23.660 --> 2:03:33.100]  but but i mean the issue here is uh i mean the issue here is vermin at the end it's being taken
[2:03:33.100 --> 2:03:38.140]  to new levels of tyranny well you know what we had another story alex had another story just last
[2:03:38.140 --> 2:03:44.780]  week this 15 year old kid is on a bike playing cops and robbers with a plastic toy gun with his
[2:03:44.780 --> 2:03:49.500]  friends they shoot him and then they cuff him afterwards listen they shot him and then they
[2:03:49.500 --> 2:03:54.300]  cuffed him after they realized it was a toy gun you know what is this and then you have the eyewitness
[2:03:54.300 --> 2:03:58.300]  is going i can't believe they just let them lie they're bleeding that's the mental illness
[2:03:58.300 --> 2:04:02.620]  that's the mental illness i told you those videos of a breaking pro wiper's arms they didn't beat
[2:04:02.620 --> 2:04:07.740]  them after they break your arm it's like oh you got a toy oh i shot you i'm gonna go ahead and
[2:04:07.740 --> 2:04:12.940]  cuff you and hope you bleed to death that was like that carnaby guy cia down in houston the cops
[2:04:12.940 --> 2:04:17.100]  execute him clearly on a hit team inside the department we know they have one and then they
[2:04:17.100 --> 2:04:21.500]  cuffing and hold medical attention back to lead died that's what i mean they're openly going to
[2:04:21.500 --> 2:04:26.700]  be lining us up and shooting us soon and they'll have all these little minions in the police department
[2:04:26.700 --> 2:04:31.820]  on the message board going good it's good a lot americans up the machine go far you already have
[2:04:31.820 --> 2:04:36.860]  you already have this guy who is a you know a commentator on fox news he's a military veteran

[2:12:38.780 --> 2:12:44.060]  about the economy the imminent collapse of gm the peter schiff talking about the imminent
[2:12:44.060 --> 2:12:50.780]  collapse of the dollar um these reports that perhaps this last builder berg meeting was really
[2:12:50.780 --> 2:12:55.580]  to talk about the gutting of the dollar as the world reserve currency uh brazil moving away
[2:12:55.580 --> 2:13:00.620]  from it china moving away from it apparently russia moving away from the dollar so where is
[2:13:00.620 --> 2:13:05.900]  all this headed we now have lu rockwell on the line how are you sir i'm fine thank you are you
[2:13:05.900 --> 2:13:12.300]  doing very good why don't you just give a brief overview of where you think the economy is going
[2:13:12.300 --> 2:13:16.460]  in the next six months i mean i'm watching the news right now they're saying all right gm is
[2:13:16.460 --> 2:13:20.780]  definitely going under you know the dollar seems to be going under i mean it's getting lower and
[2:13:20.780 --> 2:13:26.060]  lower gold's having kind of an explosion right now it's up around nine sixty a month ago it was at
[2:13:26.060 --> 2:13:31.100]  about eight ninety eight eighty that's going up meanwhile peter schiff is saying the dollar is
[2:13:31.100 --> 2:13:37.580]  about to collapse fully you have brazil you know dumping it as the world currency uh russia following
[2:13:37.580 --> 2:13:42.540]  suit china talking about it i mean what's next what are your predictions well the only world
[2:13:42.540 --> 2:13:48.140]  currency ought to be a gold standard as it was in the 19th century so it was a big mistake
[2:13:48.140 --> 2:13:54.620]  under uh the evil john maynard canes when the united states in 1944 set up the dollar as the world
[2:13:54.620 --> 2:14:03.020]  currency and uh it's enabled us to act in effect export our inflation so we don't pay all the here
[2:14:03.020 --> 2:14:08.060]  at home we don't pay the entire price of u.s. monetary policy or at least we haven't in the past
[2:14:08.060 --> 2:14:13.180]  we are however about to pay it because if you say the dollar is becoming worth less and less
[2:14:13.180 --> 2:14:18.540]  less and less the federal reserve injected and we of course they're very secreted we don't know
[2:14:18.540 --> 2:14:23.900]  exactly what what they're doing this uh this terrible operation but they injected something
[2:14:23.900 --> 2:14:29.740]  like eleven trillion dollars in newly created money uh into the world economy in terms of new
[2:14:29.740 --> 2:14:35.980]  dollars in order to protect wall street in the banks so what they've done is they've in other
[2:14:35.980 --> 2:14:41.580]  words vastly increased the money supply so far that money has gone into reserves in the banks
[2:14:41.580 --> 2:14:46.940]  the banks are running almost 100% reserve which is uh what marie rothbard would have liked i mean
[2:14:46.940 --> 2:14:54.380]  that this is a fractional reserves are always a source of much evil and uh and uh economic disaster
[2:14:55.020 --> 2:15:00.540]  well let's talk about when they when they when the recovery when people perceive the recovery
[2:15:00.540 --> 2:15:05.500]  is starting and people and businessmen start borrowing again banks in other words start
[2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:09.660]  lending because right now that lending and borrowing is not going on thank goodness because
[2:15:09.660 --> 2:15:14.700]  we've just been through a period of craze borrowing and lending but when that's lending and borrowing
[2:15:14.700 --> 2:15:20.220]  starts again then we're going to see very high inflation rates maybe hyperinflation
[2:15:20.220 --> 2:15:25.420]  and uh it's very scary business well let's talk about the imf and their role in all this and the
[2:15:25.420 --> 2:15:30.940]  sdr units or the special drawing rights units and where they come into play i mean they started
[2:15:30.940 --> 2:15:36.940]  really hyping these up after the g20 uh we know trillions were fused into the economy through
[2:15:36.940 --> 2:15:43.660]  these sdrs we know that mexico took 47 billion from the imf because of the swine flu outbreak
[2:15:43.660 --> 2:15:49.260]  what are these sdr units well the eye of the international monetary fund like the world bank
[2:15:49.260 --> 2:15:55.420]  was set up ironically as part of what we're talking about canes and and the britain woods uh conference
[2:15:55.420 --> 2:16:02.060]  in 1944 you can think of these it's sort of like the un it's it's the it's the disguise for us
[2:16:02.060 --> 2:16:07.260]  operations it makes it seem like the whole world is doing things so the imf is one of these institutions
[2:16:07.260 --> 2:16:14.780]  set up by franklin roosevelt on the rest of the boys uh back in 1944 and it serves as a way to give
[2:16:14.780 --> 2:16:20.140]  for an aid without directly coming from the us uh so yeah because they can give money to mexico
[2:16:20.140 --> 2:16:25.740]  they can give money to various places they also created uh a long time ago these special drawing
[2:16:25.740 --> 2:16:33.660]  rights were just just another fiat currency um but this time created by the by the imf uh it
[2:16:33.660 --> 2:16:40.140]  doesn't mean anything it's not a good thing it may engender more inflation which is a great evil
[2:16:40.140 --> 2:16:45.660]  always always and everywhere and of course this is inflation is a benefit uh to the government
[2:16:45.660 --> 2:16:50.540]  it's a benefit to the big banks it's a benefit to the government contractors military industrial
[2:16:50.540 --> 2:16:55.340]  complex all the rest of the uh the flies that the hang around the garbage can and wash it
[2:16:55.340 --> 2:17:03.500]  in dc but it's not good for the rest of us this is the devaluation of the dollar so the imf is
[2:17:03.500 --> 2:17:08.860]  part of the deal just like the federal reserve these are all bad agencies and what we actually need
[2:17:08.860 --> 2:17:14.060]  is the money that can't be depreciated by the government we can't we don't need that we don't
[2:17:14.060 --> 2:17:18.780]  need a money that a bunch of guys with a counterfeiting press which is exactly what the federal
[2:17:18.780 --> 2:17:25.020]  reserve is can just print them up at will uh we've had that kind of a money since 1971
[2:17:25.020 --> 2:17:31.260]  and the and richard nixon's um abolition of the final tiny tie to the gold standard and
[2:17:31.900 --> 2:17:36.700]  we're in very serious trouble not just us the whole world because of what the federal reserve and
[2:17:36.700 --> 2:17:42.060]  it's and it's uh assistant central banks in britain and germany and elsewhere i did during this
[2:17:42.060 --> 2:17:49.020]  recent boom after 9 11 when bush and greenspan turned the monetary spigot on fall so we are we
[2:17:49.020 --> 2:17:53.500]  were we were only beginning to pay the price and i think we've got very serious troubles
[2:17:53.500 --> 2:17:57.580]  ahead of us and i just hope we know who to blame we need to blame the federal reserve
[2:17:58.220 --> 2:18:03.340]  ensure the imf and all those other agencies but the key evil is the central bank the federal
[2:18:03.340 --> 2:18:09.740]  reserve that has made possible ever since its establishment in 1913 the diminution of american
[2:18:09.740 --> 2:18:15.100]  liberty the vast increase in growth of the federal government world wars every kind of
[2:18:15.100 --> 2:18:20.620]  disaster you can think of made possible by this monster as andrew jackson called one of its
[2:18:20.620 --> 2:18:25.900]  predecessors the central bank the federal reserve well let me get your take on this latest article
[2:18:25.900 --> 2:18:31.820]  then out of the associated press federal reserve would serve as risk regulator under obama plan
[2:18:31.820 --> 2:18:37.500]  more self-regulation by the federal reserve as if they don't have enough uh self-regulation
[2:18:37.500 --> 2:18:42.220]  and secrecy behind what they do um i mean the obama administration is proposing that the
[2:18:42.220 --> 2:18:47.340]  u.s federal reserve serve as an all-seeing regulator to detect activities that could pose
[2:18:47.340 --> 2:18:53.340]  risks to the entire financial system that's like saying you know don corleone is going to
[2:18:53.340 --> 2:18:59.740]  investigate the mafia it's absolutely insane well one of the things that happen after the government
[2:19:00.460 --> 2:19:06.300]  crisis i mean it is it is what the federal reserve caused this economic crisis because the
[2:19:06.300 --> 2:19:11.660]  artificial boom the housing boom and so forth they caused the bust but then there's a bust and
[2:19:11.660 --> 2:19:17.100]  you know with every institution in society of it if any institution a church a business or whatever
[2:19:17.100 --> 2:19:22.700]  flops on its face in a total of embarrassing disaster nobody says you know what we need to
[2:19:22.700 --> 2:19:27.820]  give those people more money and more power but with the government if the answer always of course
[2:19:27.820 --> 2:19:32.140]  is more money and more power so the federal reserve wrecks the economy and wrecks the world
[2:19:32.140 --> 2:19:36.940]  economy so now we're supposed to give them more regulatory power indeed you can think of this
[2:19:36.940 --> 2:19:42.940]  crisis as the federal reserve tater i guess wall street entirely taking over the treasury
[2:19:42.940 --> 2:19:47.500]  the federal reserve taking over all regulation of financial markets we're going to talk about
[2:19:47.500 --> 2:19:51.500]  it more on the other side to me it's the height of insanity it's the alex jones show i'm jason

[2:24:13.020 --> 2:24:19.340]  lou rockwell of lou rockwell dot com we're talking federal reserve imf s dr's you name it and now
[2:24:19.340 --> 2:24:24.780]  they want the federal reserve to basically regulate itself after they've caused all of these issues
[2:24:24.780 --> 2:24:32.460]  in this segment can you just give us just a brief synopsis of you know what the federal reserve is
[2:24:32.460 --> 2:24:38.140]  what its origins are and then the latest bill that apparently has a lot of cosponsors by
[2:24:38.140 --> 2:24:43.260]  ron paul to audit the federal reserve and why that is so important well the federal reserve
[2:24:43.260 --> 2:24:51.180]  was founded in 1913 the act federal reserve act was written at the jp morgan's private club in
[2:24:51.180 --> 2:24:58.060]  jackall island georgia um by a group of bankers uh a harvard economist uh the biggest bankers at
[2:24:58.060 --> 2:25:03.980]  the time representing the morgan and the rockfeller family than others and it's a bill designed to set
[2:25:03.980 --> 2:25:09.340]  up an institution that would do two things inflate because that you know sometimes you hear about
[2:25:09.340 --> 2:25:14.620]  the federal reserve is um that there are people associated with the fed who are against inflation
[2:25:14.620 --> 2:25:19.180]  they call them inflation hawks or whatever this is just ridiculous the central the central bank
[2:25:19.180 --> 2:25:25.420]  the federal reserve its job is to inflate that's what it does it in it and you can think of it
[2:25:25.420 --> 2:25:30.140]  it's more it's a it's a different process than this but morally and economically it's no different
[2:25:30.140 --> 2:25:35.420]  than just printing up a bunch of uh hundred dollar bills in your basement except of course on a vast
[2:25:35.420 --> 2:25:42.140]  vast scale now what the federal reserve so they do that um it and they and it was set out to
[2:25:42.140 --> 2:25:47.340]  benefit the big banks allow them to inflate and be the so-called lender of last resort so that
[2:25:47.340 --> 2:25:52.700]  during a boom uh when the boom went bust federal reserve's cause of boom when it goes bust
[2:25:53.260 --> 2:25:58.140]  they would give money to the banks to make sure they didn't they didn't suffer any damage
[2:25:58.700 --> 2:26:02.780]  just as the federal reserve did in this most recent crisis so that's what the federal reserve
[2:26:02.780 --> 2:26:09.340]  was set up to do with the it's a an agency of the banks for the banks by the banks um set up by
[2:26:09.340 --> 2:26:15.340]  the u.s government uh like many other regulatory agencies actually working for the interest of
[2:26:15.340 --> 2:26:20.140]  you for special interest as well as for the interest of the state itself so that so it
[2:26:20.140 --> 2:26:25.740]  it causes inflation it also causes business cycles because the money is injected into the
[2:26:25.740 --> 2:26:30.380]  through them through the banking system for the benefit of the bank it causes the business cycle
[2:26:30.380 --> 2:26:35.820]  that is it causes artificial booms and busts just like we've seen since 9 11 these things are
[2:26:35.820 --> 2:26:40.540]  horrendously damaging uh some people make money out of them but you know the average person is
[2:26:40.540 --> 2:26:46.940]  of course only harm and we've all been harmed and thank goodness for ron paul who his entire
[2:26:46.940 --> 2:26:52.780]  career in public life has been dedicated to sound money and to exposing what the federal reserve does
[2:26:52.780 --> 2:26:58.620]  and doing everything he can to stop the federal reserve from hurting us all so he's got this bill
[2:26:58.620 --> 2:27:04.060]  which is getting a humongous number of cosponsors i i think it's up to more than 180 other members
[2:27:04.060 --> 2:27:09.100]  of congress uh and it's only it's relatively close to actually being able to force hearings
[2:27:09.100 --> 2:27:13.660]  in a vote on this bill and it's from more transparency the federal reserve is more
[2:27:13.660 --> 2:27:20.460]  secret than the cia i'm no fan of the cia either by the way but um the federal reserve is totally
[2:27:20.460 --> 2:27:25.420]  secret um well tell people how that works tell tell people about the federal reserve board
[2:27:25.420 --> 2:27:29.980]  because a lot of people think well we elect the federal reserve board no our elected officials
[2:27:29.980 --> 2:27:33.820]  appoint these people and then what are they're they're i think they're what 13 members and
[2:27:33.820 --> 2:27:39.660]  it's eight year appointments each uh well if it's i believe it's 16 year appointments oh and
[2:27:39.660 --> 2:27:45.340]  they are they are appointed they're uh appointed by the president and approved by the congress
[2:27:45.340 --> 2:27:49.660]  these are people who serve the interests of the banking industry sometimes they're ex bankers
[2:27:49.660 --> 2:27:55.180]  sometimes they're uh economists who are in effect bank economists and i mean not just because they
[2:27:55.180 --> 2:28:01.820]  study banks but because they're owned by the banks and it's an institution that nobody knows anything
[2:28:01.820 --> 2:28:06.940]  about one of the great things ron paul is done in the ron paul campaign and and i've been interested
[2:28:06.940 --> 2:28:11.820]  in this i must say all for you know for many years myself but for most americans federal reserve
[2:28:11.820 --> 2:28:16.380]  is just like a name on the bill in their pocket and sort of boring make sure i was over that was
[2:28:16.380 --> 2:28:22.220]  all deliberate to make it seem boring but it's not boring they're ripping us off so because
[2:28:22.220 --> 2:28:28.220]  of ron paul and his campaign now more and more americans are interested in this and um
[2:28:28.220 --> 2:28:32.940]  louis van mesis wrote about this 1912 even before the establishment of the federal reserve
[2:28:32.940 --> 2:28:39.180]  that such an institution could only bring disaster and um uh of course marie rothbart
[2:28:39.180 --> 2:28:44.220]  henry haslett at bay hayek all the great economists the great of austrian economists
[2:28:44.220 --> 2:28:49.340]  opposed to the institution of central banking and an institution like the fed which again is just
[2:28:49.340 --> 2:28:55.260]  a special interest ripoff they have a marble palace and constitution avenue they uh speak
[2:28:55.260 --> 2:29:01.020]  in the language that's um unintelligible to the average person deliberately so um you don't know
[2:29:01.020 --> 2:29:06.300]  that they really are no different from the mafia although at least the mafia supplies services
[2:29:06.300 --> 2:29:11.180]  people would actually like to buy uh the federal government you know doesn't do that they just take
[2:29:11.180 --> 2:29:18.700]  our money by force and then use it to punish us yeah one of the things like uh yeah it's just
[2:29:18.700 --> 2:29:24.540]  the federal reserve yeah and then to create you know big money for americorps so they can pump up
[2:29:24.540 --> 2:29:30.060]  city year and literally the red jackets the new civilian security force i mean have you seen

[2:31:58.940 --> 2:32:05.100]  there's a guy named mz in santa cruz california who owns one of our affiliate radio stations
[2:32:05.100 --> 2:32:09.660]  he got laid off from a job he loved many years ago he was devastated but it taught him a lesson
[2:32:09.660 --> 2:32:14.380]  very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much
[2:32:14.380 --> 2:32:19.020]  he appreciates you every day there is no job security you are always in danger of losing
[2:32:19.020 --> 2:32:24.940]  your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business since you are the boss
[2:32:24.940 --> 2:32:31.500]  nobody can fire you so mz has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning
[2:32:31.500 --> 2:32:37.260]  other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others mz wants to
[2:32:37.260 --> 2:32:42.300]  tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of helpful dark chocolate

[2:32:54.060 --> 2:32:59.100]  takes very little money and if you're interested mz wants to talk to you remember chocolate dot
[2:32:59.100 --> 2:33:24.220]  own myself com we are back it's the alex jones show on jason firma sitting in for alex jones
[2:33:24.220 --> 2:33:28.620]  we're talking to lou rockwell and we were just talking about the audit the fed bill the last i
[2:33:28.620 --> 2:33:35.020]  knew there was over 170 co-sponsors he's now telling us over 180 i want to i want to get
[2:33:35.020 --> 2:33:39.020]  what happens next you know this this goes to the house they do discuss it it gets
[2:33:39.020 --> 2:33:44.060]  you know more more talk what happens after that and then i really want to talk about this new
[2:33:44.060 --> 2:33:47.820]  push for city year because city has been around for a while but they're getting all these americor
[2:33:47.820 --> 2:33:53.820]  grants and now all of a sudden it's all about i am change taking the obama logo showing mother
[2:33:53.820 --> 2:34:01.340]  teresa martin luther king jr gondy really champions of not only free speech but political
[2:34:01.340 --> 2:34:06.060]  dissidents i mean you know uh... the this is the real opposition these were people that actually
[2:34:06.060 --> 2:34:11.500]  did make a difference and for them to jump on this bandwagon and try to promote this agenda is
[2:34:11.500 --> 2:34:16.860]  just disgusting to me so let's start with where this ought to the fed bill will go
[2:34:16.860 --> 2:34:21.100]  you know let's say it goes into congress what has to happen so that they actually do ought to
[2:34:21.100 --> 2:34:25.180]  the fed and then let's talk about city year lou jason first i gave you the wrong number
[2:34:25.180 --> 2:34:29.260]  it's a hundred and seventy nine co-sponsors that's close to a hundred and eighty one
[2:34:29.260 --> 2:34:34.940]  not just one eighty yet uh... but it's it's thrilling i mean in now i'll they'll
[2:34:34.940 --> 2:34:38.220]  nancy polosi and for that matter the republican leadership of course
[2:34:38.220 --> 2:34:42.780]  will try to block this bill but if it actually were to come to a vote
[2:34:42.780 --> 2:34:46.620]  uh... it's you know where it's ron paul's view that
[2:34:46.620 --> 2:34:50.220]  very few people are going to be willing to vote for total secrecy at the fed
[2:34:50.220 --> 2:34:53.900]  that uh... the whole of congress is upset because they can't find out
[2:34:53.900 --> 2:34:57.260]  where all this money is gone and uh...
[2:34:57.260 --> 2:35:01.020]  you know so that this bill has a very very good chance of passing
[2:35:01.020 --> 2:35:04.860]  if it were to pass it could be the beginning of the end for the federal
[2:35:04.860 --> 2:35:07.900]  reserve because but these are like cockroaches in a dark
[2:35:07.900 --> 2:35:11.020]  kitchen they can't stand the flashlight so this
[2:35:11.020 --> 2:35:15.020]  ron paul's bill is a flashlight and pointing at these people and if they
[2:35:15.020 --> 2:35:18.700]  if you can turn it on it's gonna have a just a very good effect in educating the
[2:35:18.700 --> 2:35:23.420]  american people and who knows what they'll find i mean these guys at the fed
[2:35:23.420 --> 2:35:26.940]  live very very well even the lowest ranking people
[2:35:26.940 --> 2:35:31.740]  have limos and they have hotel suites and four star hotels and
[2:35:31.740 --> 2:35:35.820]  they eat at the fanciest restaurants and they all do very very well
[2:35:35.820 --> 2:35:40.060]  they print their own budget by the way this is the only agency of government
[2:35:40.060 --> 2:35:43.020]  that doesn't have a budget that's actually approved by congress and i'll
[2:35:43.020 --> 2:35:46.780]  admit that's not much of a of a limit but it's a little something
[2:35:46.780 --> 2:35:51.420]  but the fed just decides what they want to print for themselves and they print it
[2:35:51.420 --> 2:35:54.460]  well if there's something funny about that of course that of course they've
[2:35:54.460 --> 2:35:57.740]  got to be oversight of the federal reserve if there is such a thing as a
[2:35:57.740 --> 2:36:01.660]  central bank and if there should not be from a moral or an economic or a
[2:36:01.660 --> 2:36:06.620]  constitutional or a political point of view as ron paul
[2:36:06.620 --> 2:36:11.420]  uh... always points out if there is a fed there has to be oversight
[2:36:11.420 --> 2:36:14.620]  somebody has to be looking at what they're doing and
[2:36:14.620 --> 2:36:17.660]  to the extent that it can be exposed and my guess is
[2:36:17.660 --> 2:36:20.940]  that we would have a lot of things like the british parliamentary scandals
[2:36:20.940 --> 2:36:24.700]  these people putting up money and it hurts every american when they print up
[2:36:24.700 --> 2:36:27.260]  this money uh... to live high on the hog
[2:36:27.260 --> 2:36:30.620]  let's find out what these birds are doing it's unfortunately not going to point
[2:36:30.620 --> 2:36:33.820]  out you know everything they're doing but it's going to tell us some of the
[2:36:33.820 --> 2:36:36.700]  things they're doing and i think when that happens that there can be a
[2:36:36.700 --> 2:36:40.620]  political explosion be much more interest in the part of the american
[2:36:40.620 --> 2:36:43.580]  people to really go after the central bank
[2:36:43.580 --> 2:36:46.140]  this thing is ripping us off again to the tune of
[2:36:46.140 --> 2:36:50.700]  trillions of dollars and of course because these numbers are so big
[2:36:50.700 --> 2:36:54.140]  they're hard to uh... even hard to understand what's going on
[2:36:54.140 --> 2:36:58.060]  but if you can find out that some lower-ranking federal official took
[2:36:58.060 --> 2:37:01.820]  uh... twenty five thousand dollars for some extra deal
[2:37:01.820 --> 2:37:03.900]  you know that kind of people understand it can
[2:37:03.900 --> 2:37:07.260]  it can bring about the indignation of the fed
[2:37:07.260 --> 2:37:11.100]  there should be demonstrations outside the fed people should be angry at the fed
[2:37:11.100 --> 2:37:14.140]  the fed is much worse for us than the irs
[2:37:14.140 --> 2:37:19.420]  or the p a or the rest of the alphabet from hell in washington dc
[2:37:19.420 --> 2:37:22.300]  the federal reserve the worst operation
[2:37:22.300 --> 2:37:25.660]  domestically of the federal government
[2:37:25.660 --> 2:37:29.500]  yeah it's not really even an agency of the federal government it's kind of like
[2:37:29.500 --> 2:37:34.140]  a quasi agency it's really a a private banking system
[2:37:34.140 --> 2:37:38.460]  with no oversight whatsoever let's say this bill does
[2:37:38.460 --> 2:37:43.100]  pass do you really think that we will see oversight of the fed or will we see
[2:37:43.100 --> 2:37:45.580]  this this bill vetoed like i obviously said
[2:37:45.580 --> 2:37:49.100]  you know there's going to be opposition policy i can't see barack obama
[2:37:49.100 --> 2:37:52.780]  getting behind this i see a large media blackout i don't think you're
[2:37:52.780 --> 2:37:57.740]  you know this is already at the point where it should be on nbc abc news cbs
[2:37:57.740 --> 2:38:01.180]  fox if they were actually legitimate cnn but they're not they're not reporting
[2:38:01.180 --> 2:38:04.380]  on this so let's say it does pass through congress
[2:38:04.380 --> 2:38:09.020]  do we have a shot at actually auditing the fed
[2:38:09.020 --> 2:38:12.300]  obama might very well be the one after all he's a bankster president is like
[2:38:12.300 --> 2:38:16.300]  bush was this is who this is who puts these guys into office there are other
[2:38:16.300 --> 2:38:20.220]  interest groups involved but his biggest donors were
[2:38:20.220 --> 2:38:25.020]  big banks on wall street so um he might very well veto it
[2:38:25.020 --> 2:38:30.140]  but we can't overlook the the possibility of popular opposition
[2:38:30.140 --> 2:38:34.300]  popular opposition by the american people can actually make these birds and
[2:38:34.300 --> 2:38:36.700]  washington do what they don't want to do
[2:38:36.700 --> 2:38:40.780]  and that is something in our interest so we're this bill to be passed
[2:38:40.780 --> 2:38:45.180]  uh... and we're obama to veto it uh... i i think in hope that there would be some
[2:38:45.180 --> 2:38:48.940]  indignation so uh... again these are just small
[2:38:48.940 --> 2:38:52.860]  we're just taking baby steps towards getting rid of this horrible thing
[2:38:52.860 --> 2:38:55.900]  but every baby step helps and i can tell you
[2:38:55.900 --> 2:38:59.660]  they are worried at the fed they don't like this bill
[2:38:59.660 --> 2:39:02.940]  they don't like any discussion of themselves there was an article in
[2:39:02.940 --> 2:39:06.380]  fortune magazine making part four was magazine recently
[2:39:06.380 --> 2:39:09.100]  saying look we have to make the fed boring again
[2:39:09.100 --> 2:39:11.820]  but it's very bad to have anybody interested in it
[2:39:11.820 --> 2:39:15.100]  because it has to be independent has to be mysterious it has to be
[2:39:15.100 --> 2:39:19.100]  with no oversight uh... it should be unmisterious
[2:39:19.100 --> 2:39:23.580]  it should be oversight we should at least know what the crooks are doing to us
[2:39:23.580 --> 2:39:27.500]  as they're taking our wallet we should at least give us that
[2:39:27.500 --> 2:39:30.460]  uh... so ron paul's bill is a step in that direction
[2:39:30.460 --> 2:39:33.900]  no it's not our every everything we need but it sure is a great
[2:39:33.900 --> 2:39:37.500]  would be a great change well absolutely you know i'm not trying to discourage
[2:39:37.500 --> 2:39:40.460]  anybody and i really do hope that it goes through and that it does get the
[2:39:40.460 --> 2:39:44.140]  mainstream media attention that it deserves so more and more people at
[2:39:44.140 --> 2:39:47.740]  least take a look at the issue at least take a look at america freedom to
[2:39:47.740 --> 2:39:51.260]  fascism if you don't have time to read a book on the subject matter if you don't
[2:39:51.260 --> 2:39:54.700]  fully understand you know what greenspan said in the obama
[2:39:54.700 --> 2:39:57.660]  deception when he says well it doesn't matter what the president does
[2:39:57.660 --> 2:40:01.660]  we're outside of the president we we do we want you know go check that out
[2:40:01.660 --> 2:40:06.380]  i wanna kind of shift gears i want to play this uh... city your clip
[2:40:06.380 --> 2:40:10.060]  for prison planet dot tv members and then discuss it on the other side if you
[2:40:10.060 --> 2:40:13.340]  haven't seen this you know we've been talking about it for a couple of weeks
[2:40:13.340 --> 2:40:17.420]  but they are truly trying to hijack and indoctrinate the youth
[2:40:17.420 --> 2:40:22.220]  into this stasi like program i mean this it's just so
[2:40:22.220 --> 2:40:26.940]  outrageous to me and you know their first official day their first holiday the
[2:40:26.940 --> 2:40:30.540]  national day of civil service is of course going to be on nine eleven
[2:40:30.540 --> 2:40:33.340]  where they're going to have makeshift memorials around the country
[2:40:33.340 --> 2:40:37.660]  and people from city year knocking on your door asking you to pledge
[2:40:37.660 --> 2:41:00.780]  so let's hit the clip
[2:41:00.780 --> 2:41:10.380]  i've always had the same goals
[2:41:10.380 --> 2:41:15.180]  to make this world a better place by helping those who need it most
[2:41:15.180 --> 2:41:19.900]  to never turn my back when things get tough
[2:41:19.900 --> 2:41:26.540]  and to show that positive can always overpower negative
[2:41:26.540 --> 2:41:31.340]  i am change
[2:41:31.340 --> 2:41:38.540]  and this is what i wear
[2:41:38.540 --> 2:41:41.900]  and there's you know a bunch of these ads out there there's one where a girl is
[2:41:41.900 --> 2:41:45.740]  talking about how she's shedding her individual skin and taking on a
[2:41:45.740 --> 2:41:50.940]  universal skin to build a new world when she puts on this jacket and
[2:41:50.940 --> 2:41:54.140]  i mean let's talk about all let's talk about the figures they use the fact
[2:41:54.140 --> 2:41:57.900]  that they're in militant formation the fact of the people that they show
[2:41:57.900 --> 2:42:02.140]  never had people in militant formation to get their ideas across gondy martin
[2:42:02.140 --> 2:42:05.020]  luther king jr but they're trying to sell this
[2:42:05.020 --> 2:42:08.220]  as kind of like this i don't even know how to describe it it's like pseudo
[2:42:08.220 --> 2:42:12.140]  fascism i mean they're wearing red white and black what's your take on this
[2:42:12.140 --> 2:42:15.340]  luke well i think we've had a growing fascism in this country for some time
[2:42:15.340 --> 2:42:18.620]  the bush administration certainly was a fascist regime in the obama
[2:42:18.620 --> 2:42:22.380]  administration is stepping up stepping up i mean what is fascism
[2:42:22.380 --> 2:42:26.060]  not just an epithet that it's an actual political and economic system
[2:42:26.060 --> 2:42:29.660]  that involves a government business partnership big business big government
[2:42:29.660 --> 2:42:33.660]  and go to get the rest of us it involves militarism it involves crazed
[2:42:33.660 --> 2:42:38.460]  nationalism it involves it involves the suppression of civil liberties
[2:42:38.460 --> 2:42:42.940]  and frequently it involves a uniform party militia
[2:42:42.940 --> 2:42:48.460]  um... so we didn't have that until now you're right the obama people seem to be
[2:42:48.460 --> 2:42:53.100]  intent on setting up some kind of uniformed party militia among the youth
[2:42:53.100 --> 2:42:56.540]  and of course he does your clip uh... said to go back during the campaign he
[2:42:56.540 --> 2:42:57.420]  talked about
[2:42:57.420 --> 2:43:01.180]  a civilian security uh... uh... arm that he was
[2:43:01.180 --> 2:43:03.820]  set up with the federal government maybe like the neighborhood watch
[2:43:03.820 --> 2:43:05.740]  committees in cuba i don't know but
[2:43:05.740 --> 2:43:10.060]  it's it's all uh... it's not good news well it seems even worse that they're
[2:43:10.060 --> 2:43:13.100]  now coming out and saying you know we're gonna use the boy scouts to fight
[2:43:13.100 --> 2:43:15.580]  terror and the example that they use
[2:43:15.580 --> 2:43:19.660]  is a disgruntled iraq war veteran come back home and now he's
[2:43:19.660 --> 2:43:24.140]  a homegrown terrorist and he's shooting people from a tower here come the boy
[2:43:24.140 --> 2:43:27.820]  scouts in their explorers program and then you see the photos
[2:43:27.820 --> 2:43:31.340]  in the new york times and they're giving these kids mock shotguns
[2:43:31.340 --> 2:43:34.700]  and assault weapons it's it's blowing my mind lou
[2:43:34.700 --> 2:43:39.020]  what is terrorism i mean terrorism is like a movable feast
[2:43:39.020 --> 2:43:41.260]  i mean it's whatever the government says it is
[2:43:41.260 --> 2:43:45.820]  it's whatever the government you know it's it's it's in effect resisting the
[2:43:45.820 --> 2:43:49.420]  government is terrorism so that people overseas and that's been that people here
[2:43:49.420 --> 2:43:50.220]  of course
[2:43:50.220 --> 2:43:54.020]  sometimes some of the stuff they call terrorism is is evil
[2:43:54.020 --> 2:43:56.540]  sometimes it's just because sometimes it
[2:43:56.540 --> 2:43:58.540]  just their their epithet
[2:43:58.540 --> 2:44:01.020]  to demonize their enemies
[2:44:01.020 --> 2:44:03.780]  you know that's what that's what they're doing with the boy scouts
[2:44:03.780 --> 2:44:05.220]  and you know they have
[2:44:05.220 --> 2:44:09.140]  we we have for some time in this country that does not do with obama
[2:44:09.140 --> 2:44:13.140]  for some time in this country we've had a government and a reigning ideology
[2:44:13.140 --> 2:44:15.500]  that saw absolutely nothing
[2:44:15.500 --> 2:44:17.940]  beyond the reach of the state
[2:44:17.940 --> 2:44:21.140]  there is nobody in washington with the exception of ron paul
[2:44:21.140 --> 2:44:24.740]  who thinks that there are areas of society family life community life
[2:44:24.740 --> 2:44:25.820]  business life
[2:44:25.820 --> 2:44:28.620]  uh... personal personal liberties
[2:44:28.620 --> 2:44:31.660]  who thinks that's beyond the government whatever the government decides to do
[2:44:31.660 --> 2:44:32.780]  to you
[2:44:32.780 --> 2:44:34.620]  in your family in your home
[2:44:34.620 --> 2:44:37.460]  in your business in your community
[2:44:37.460 --> 2:44:40.820]  it's okay the government has total power over us
[2:44:40.820 --> 2:44:43.820]  in the reigning in the view of the reigning ideology total power to take
[2:44:43.820 --> 2:44:44.700]  your kid
[2:44:44.700 --> 2:44:47.420]  uh... some evil crazy war overseas
[2:44:47.420 --> 2:44:49.340]  or to set up these kinds of uh...
[2:44:49.340 --> 2:44:51.420]  institutions that of course we've had
[2:44:51.420 --> 2:44:54.620]  uh... as happened with the private security guards hired by the federal
[2:44:54.620 --> 2:44:55.940]  government and the
[2:44:55.940 --> 2:44:57.940]  in the katrina disaster
[2:44:57.940 --> 2:45:02.540]  some very alarming stuff of use of of the military power quality military
[2:45:02.540 --> 2:45:03.340]  power
[2:45:03.340 --> 2:45:05.060]  in this case sort of youth
[2:45:05.060 --> 2:45:08.980]  under a red pioneer or hitler youth or whatever military but
[2:45:08.980 --> 2:45:09.820]  uh...
[2:45:09.820 --> 2:45:11.740]  future military power
[2:45:11.740 --> 2:45:13.220]  who are they who are they intending
[2:45:13.220 --> 2:45:15.140]  what are they intending to do with these groups
[2:45:15.140 --> 2:45:16.980]  they're intending to intimidate us
[2:45:16.980 --> 2:45:20.180]  so that uh... you know if you have a problem with uh...
[2:45:20.180 --> 2:45:22.580]  but i like to call death aid which will be the
[2:45:22.580 --> 2:45:24.940]  the federal uh... medical program
[2:45:24.940 --> 2:45:29.300]  uh... you know maybe you'll get a visit from the uh... from the city care youth
[2:45:29.300 --> 2:45:32.260]  uh... to try to dissuade you from making a complaint
[2:45:32.260 --> 2:45:35.380]  well you know what i think it goes on in authoritarian countries
[2:45:35.380 --> 2:45:37.580]  and we are fast approaching that
[2:45:37.580 --> 2:45:42.100]  you know and while this goes on the supreme court just on tuesday ruled
[2:45:42.100 --> 2:45:46.060]  that in certain circumstances of course it's always are well and they say all
[2:45:46.060 --> 2:45:48.660]  we really didn't take away this right it's only in certain cases
[2:45:48.660 --> 2:45:51.940]  but they rolled five to four and again it's a close vote it's never nine to
[2:45:51.940 --> 2:45:54.420]  nothing or seven to two it's always five to four
[2:45:54.420 --> 2:45:58.020]  all we were so close not taking away your civil liberties but we decided to
[2:45:58.020 --> 2:45:58.940]  they ruled
[2:45:58.940 --> 2:46:03.380]  that the a lawyer no longer needs to be president certain circumstances for
[2:46:03.380 --> 2:46:06.980]  police to interrogate you now yes and they've been doing this you know in the
[2:46:06.980 --> 2:46:10.780]  past in some other cases where they're lied to somebody will entrap somebody
[2:46:10.780 --> 2:46:13.940]  they'll you know physically abuse somebody interrogate them yes but now
[2:46:13.940 --> 2:46:15.500]  the supreme court
[2:46:15.500 --> 2:46:17.020]  has ruled
[2:46:17.020 --> 2:46:20.980]  that they can interrogate you without a lawyer and that will not be thrown out
[2:46:20.980 --> 2:46:22.620]  of court what's your take on that
[2:46:22.620 --> 2:46:26.700]  what is the supreme court nine government lawyers
[2:46:26.700 --> 2:46:29.260]  it make decisions in favor of the government
[2:46:29.260 --> 2:46:31.820]  i mean i thought that's what the you know what we're taught to think of the
[2:46:31.820 --> 2:46:32.700]  system sort of
[2:46:32.700 --> 2:46:34.940]  the real guy but the cloud
[2:46:34.940 --> 2:46:39.100]  these are government bureaucrats intent on expanding government power
[2:46:39.100 --> 2:46:42.340]  and expanding the power of the supreme court to within the government
[2:46:42.340 --> 2:46:44.860]  and yet absolutely true i mean we have
[2:46:44.860 --> 2:46:48.820]  after all the president obama building on what bush has done
[2:46:48.820 --> 2:46:51.740]  it said he wants the power in a formal way
[2:46:51.740 --> 2:46:56.260]  for the president but then of course all the president zillion employees
[2:46:56.260 --> 2:46:59.780]  to take any person american or foreign
[2:46:59.780 --> 2:47:01.900]  put them in the prison camp
[2:47:01.900 --> 2:47:04.140]  keep it secret that they're in a prison camp
[2:47:04.140 --> 2:47:07.260]  and keep them there indefinitely and have the ability to interrogate them with
[2:47:07.260 --> 2:47:08.860]  torture of course
[2:47:08.860 --> 2:47:10.540]  on his own say so
[2:47:10.540 --> 2:47:14.740]  so they're undoing you know uh... a thousand years of of development of
[2:47:14.740 --> 2:47:15.980]  of civil liberties
[2:47:15.980 --> 2:47:19.260]  and we're watching the establishment of the totalitarian state
[2:47:19.260 --> 2:47:23.020]  they get this is not that they begin with obama main really frank and roosevelt
[2:47:23.020 --> 2:47:26.460]  was our first fascist president but this has been going on for some time
[2:47:26.460 --> 2:47:28.180]  but american freedoms
[2:47:28.180 --> 2:47:32.180]  are evaporating you know like uh... water in the sun in washington dc in
[2:47:32.180 --> 2:47:33.540]  the summertime
[2:47:33.540 --> 2:47:36.180]  well they really are and you know another story that we've been carrying
[2:47:36.180 --> 2:47:41.860]  here info wars is just a week and a half ago in wisconsin a judge ruled there
[2:47:41.860 --> 2:47:45.500]  that the police could outfit somebody who was not
[2:47:45.500 --> 2:47:49.100]  under probable cause did not have a warrant for an investigation they could
[2:47:49.100 --> 2:47:53.260]  outfit their car without them knowing with a gps device and track and trace
[2:47:53.260 --> 2:47:54.860]  them and this was okay
[2:47:54.860 --> 2:47:58.980]  i mean this police state has gotten completely out of control i mean i have
[2:47:58.980 --> 2:48:03.860]  a story in front of me high-tech sleuth helps reduce truancy of the seventeen
[2:48:03.860 --> 2:48:06.220]  year-old girl is forced to carry this
[2:48:06.220 --> 2:48:07.740]  gps device
[2:48:07.740 --> 2:48:11.060]  that has these different buttons in the certain times she'll have to actually
[2:48:11.060 --> 2:48:14.980]  punch in her coordinates and if her coordinates are outside that she gets
[2:48:14.980 --> 2:48:16.420]  thrown out of school i mean
[2:48:16.420 --> 2:48:20.460]  how much more can we take from big brother it just keeps expanding and
[2:48:20.460 --> 2:48:23.260]  expanding and getting more and more out of control
[2:48:23.260 --> 2:48:26.780]  we have a one thing that every that every but parent ought to consider
[2:48:26.780 --> 2:48:29.780]  if you have your children in the government school
[2:48:29.780 --> 2:48:32.340]  they're entirely run by the federal government of the department of
[2:48:32.340 --> 2:48:33.700]  education washington
[2:48:33.700 --> 2:48:35.900]  what are you doing
[2:48:35.900 --> 2:48:39.060]  what are you doing turning over your children the people want to put up an
[2:48:39.060 --> 2:48:42.340]  ankle bracelet on the keep track of them
[2:48:42.340 --> 2:48:44.980]  where they're totally indoctrinated every day
[2:48:44.980 --> 2:48:48.060]  in the glories of government the glories of government power
[2:48:48.060 --> 2:48:51.220]  and why the government should be able to do anything i want to them
[2:48:51.220 --> 2:48:52.260]  and to you
[2:48:52.260 --> 2:48:54.220]  and why if uh... uh...
[2:48:54.220 --> 2:48:56.740]  you have your own views on religion nor
[2:48:56.740 --> 2:49:00.020]  some other subject the government doesn't like well the heck with you and
[2:49:00.020 --> 2:49:02.140]  the kids should be responsive to the government
[2:49:02.140 --> 2:49:05.980]  the public school exists to take children in the fact away from their parents
[2:49:05.980 --> 2:49:08.580]  away from their community make them a little robot
[2:49:08.580 --> 2:49:09.780]  for dc
[2:49:09.780 --> 2:49:12.940]  so parents if you've got your kids in the government school
[2:49:12.940 --> 2:49:15.220]  please rethink it
[2:49:15.220 --> 2:49:16.380]  i want to get your take
[2:49:16.380 --> 2:49:18.340]  on uh... this uh...
[2:49:18.340 --> 2:49:22.220]  this former soldier ralph peter's he's been on you know he's been on u s a
[2:49:22.220 --> 2:49:25.940]  today contributed fox news rights for the new york post
[2:49:25.940 --> 2:49:27.100]  and i wonder
[2:49:27.100 --> 2:49:29.020]  yeah yeah in his latest column
[2:49:29.020 --> 2:49:32.860]  he starts talking about really something that's kind of already happening but not
[2:49:32.860 --> 2:49:34.380]  you know outward practice
[2:49:34.380 --> 2:49:36.260]  he talks about blackouts
[2:49:36.260 --> 2:49:40.180]  uh... media censorship which is already happening in this country but then he
[2:49:40.180 --> 2:49:42.580]  says ultimately military attacks
[2:49:42.580 --> 2:49:43.940]  on partisan
[2:49:43.940 --> 2:49:46.940]  media saying he they literally need to kill
[2:49:46.940 --> 2:49:48.020]  the media
[2:49:48.020 --> 2:49:49.220]  in order to
[2:49:49.220 --> 2:49:52.420]  you know further the war effort and save us from the terrorist now this is
[2:49:52.420 --> 2:49:53.420]  already happened
[2:49:53.420 --> 2:49:56.500]  on several levels over in the middle east but it seems like he's talking about
[2:49:56.500 --> 2:49:57.340]  this happening
[2:49:57.340 --> 2:50:00.340]  in this country and of course we're our news is already blacked out and
[2:50:00.340 --> 2:50:03.580]  censored anybody with a with half a brain that's paying attention to what's
[2:50:03.580 --> 2:50:04.780]  going on knows this
[2:50:04.780 --> 2:50:07.460]  but for him to put this out there like it's okay
[2:50:07.460 --> 2:50:08.980]  to kill the media i mean
[2:50:08.980 --> 2:50:10.380]  what's your take
[2:50:10.380 --> 2:50:12.820]  well but route here is a new car
[2:50:12.820 --> 2:50:17.220]  therefore he's a totalitarian uh... with the kind of social democrat
[2:50:17.220 --> 2:50:18.700]  in in economics
[2:50:18.700 --> 2:50:21.580]  but it's a totalitarian terms of the warfare state
[2:50:21.580 --> 2:50:24.060]  in terms of civil liberties
[2:50:24.060 --> 2:50:27.220]  already the u.s. government kills foreign reporters
[2:50:27.220 --> 2:50:30.780]  i mean it when they started this when bush started his aggression
[2:50:30.780 --> 2:50:34.180]  both against afghanistan and against iraq
[2:50:34.180 --> 2:50:38.580]  they bombed al-jazeera station that's right bomb the media that was telling
[2:50:38.580 --> 2:50:39.620]  the truth
[2:50:39.620 --> 2:50:43.060]  so the u.s. already does is i guess brawl peters would like to
[2:50:43.060 --> 2:50:47.580]  shoot people in this country or going along with the a bc nbc

[2:54:31.820 --> 2:54:35.420]  of the occupation of afghanistan we went in there in october really
[2:54:35.420 --> 2:54:38.860]  cleaned things up pretty quickly but now the insurgents are back and
[2:54:38.860 --> 2:54:42.540]  that's the main focus and we're redistributing forces from iraq
[2:54:42.540 --> 2:54:45.980]  into afghanistan and meanwhile you know in 2006
[2:54:45.980 --> 2:54:49.180]  the democrats were supposed to save us when they became the majority in the
[2:54:49.180 --> 2:54:52.380]  house and they were going to get us out of the war and Nancy Pelosi said nope
[2:54:52.380 --> 2:54:55.420]  and we're not going to go after war crimes either and she's just a big
[2:54:55.420 --> 2:54:58.780]  figurehead for the for the whole party at this point and for the war
[2:54:58.780 --> 2:55:02.860]  the barack obama administration comes in and they backtrack on their plans oh

[2:55:07.180 --> 2:55:11.180]  combat troops will be out by the end of december 2011 but we're
[2:55:11.180 --> 2:55:14.780]  still going to have 50 000 non-combat troops in iraq
[2:55:14.780 --> 2:55:17.900]  right around the time of an election year give me a break i mean talk about
[2:55:17.900 --> 2:55:22.220]  orwellian speak and then he says we're going to shut down guantanamo bay
[2:55:22.220 --> 2:55:25.500]  but it doesn't happen they can't find the funding well we just passed another
[2:55:25.500 --> 2:55:29.420]  bill for 83 billion dollars for this war in the middle east they can't find the
[2:55:29.420 --> 2:55:33.340]  funding to close down guantanamo bay i mean where do you see
[2:55:33.340 --> 2:55:36.220]  the um middle east situation going in the next few months
[2:55:36.220 --> 2:55:39.420]  well i think it's very frightening and i think barack obama is potentially more
[2:55:39.420 --> 2:55:43.740]  of a militarist and more of a warm warm longer than even george bush
[2:55:43.740 --> 2:55:47.340]  if only because he may feel he has to prove more uh because of what people
[2:55:47.340 --> 2:55:50.380]  thought was his might be his pro-peace agenda
[2:55:50.380 --> 2:55:55.500]  um uh i must say i was fooled early on i thought maybe he was a guy who was
[2:55:55.500 --> 2:55:59.340]  actually going to be less belligerent but of course it's not true so yeah the
[2:55:59.340 --> 2:56:02.780]  the so-called insurgents are doing better in afghanistan
[2:56:02.780 --> 2:56:06.300]  it's you know who are these insurgents these are people these are afghanis
[2:56:06.300 --> 2:56:10.940]  who don't like the idea of a bunch of foreigners occupying their country
[2:56:10.940 --> 2:56:14.460]  now aren't that isn't that a crazy blacko business that somebody might feel that
[2:56:14.460 --> 2:56:17.820]  way uh so because we're supposed to demonize and hate the guts of anybody
[2:56:17.820 --> 2:56:21.900]  who doesn't want to be ruled by the u.s uh i don't want to be ruled by the u.s i
[2:56:21.900 --> 2:56:25.020]  just assumed the amount of this country and i certainly don't want to see them
[2:56:25.020 --> 2:56:29.180]  attacking uh people in other countries but they're stepping up the wars and
[2:56:29.180 --> 2:56:32.860]  they're some very alarming rhetoric being used against iran
[2:56:32.860 --> 2:56:38.140]  um if iran wants an atomic bomb uh and there's no evidence that the that they're
[2:56:38.140 --> 2:56:41.660]  doing anything to produce one according to the international atomic energy
[2:56:41.660 --> 2:56:44.540]  agency and all the people who inspect them there's no evidence
[2:56:44.540 --> 2:56:47.660]  if they want to bomb why would they want to bomb they would not want to bomb to
[2:56:47.660 --> 2:56:50.460]  bomb israel or the u.s or anybody else
[2:56:50.460 --> 2:56:54.540]  they would want to bomb to protect themselves from being bombed
[2:56:54.540 --> 2:56:58.780]  because of course the u.s and israel are threatening them constantly
[2:56:58.780 --> 2:57:01.580]  we're going to kill you we're going to bomb you this by the way against
[2:57:01.580 --> 2:57:05.420]  international order to threaten war like this against another country
[2:57:05.420 --> 2:57:07.980]  they were going to kill you we're going to kill you we're going to kill you we're
[2:57:07.980 --> 2:57:11.420]  going to kill you and i guess there are a lot of people who actually want to
[2:57:11.420 --> 2:57:16.140]  kill everybody in iran this is a great change ancient civilization
[2:57:16.140 --> 2:57:20.700]  um these are wonderful people they're being demonized of course any people
[2:57:20.700 --> 2:57:24.780]  who the u.s plans to mass murder always have to be demonized
[2:57:24.780 --> 2:57:28.700]  um they're great people they never did anything to us
[2:57:28.700 --> 2:57:32.540]  they never uh you know they haven't heard any neighbor
[2:57:32.540 --> 2:57:36.540]  for a thousand years or whatever so to be
[2:57:36.540 --> 2:57:40.140]  committing an act of aggression we have to remember this is the first crime
[2:57:40.140 --> 2:57:44.220]  that was charged with the normberg trials against germany
[2:57:44.220 --> 2:57:48.860]  the first international crime was launching an aggressive war
[2:57:48.860 --> 2:57:53.180]  it is the end of the normberg trial so this was the worst thing the nazis did
[2:57:53.180 --> 2:57:56.540]  um maybe it wasn't the worst thing but it certainly made possible all the
[2:57:56.540 --> 2:57:59.580]  worst things that they did the atmosphere of war
[2:57:59.580 --> 2:58:04.140]  and totalitarianism that comes with total war than the total state
[2:58:04.140 --> 2:58:08.540]  and that seems to be the direction that we the ones of the land of the free
[2:58:08.540 --> 2:58:12.460]  are headed in so i think it's very alarming that they may plan to
[2:58:12.460 --> 2:58:17.580]  to obama ran and kill who knows how many people this by the way is an act of
[2:58:17.580 --> 2:58:19.580]  murder doesn't matter that you're in a government
[2:58:19.580 --> 2:58:23.260]  uniform or that you're in a government house in washington dc
[2:58:23.260 --> 2:58:27.980]  you push the button and kill people you are a murderer
[2:58:27.980 --> 2:58:31.260]  i have to agree with you you are a murderer if you're killing innocent

[3:01:44.860 --> 3:01:47.420]  the headline but it was given to me by my producer in the beginning of the show
[3:01:47.420 --> 3:01:51.340]  and it's definitely worth noting we talked a little bit about supreme court
[3:01:51.340 --> 3:01:55.340]  decisions and the corruption there in the five to four wwe
[3:01:55.340 --> 3:02:00.300]  politics style oh it was so close it's always so close well
[3:02:00.300 --> 3:02:03.980]  we know sotomayor is a council member
[3:02:03.980 --> 3:02:07.340]  on the rosin we know that we're aware of that okay
[3:02:07.340 --> 3:02:11.180]  we know she's already really a reverse racist and it's okay they're calling it
[3:02:11.180 --> 3:02:14.860]  a reverse racist in the media because they love to drum up controversy
[3:02:14.860 --> 3:02:19.420]  between newt gingrich and whoever newt gingrich the fake christian who likes
[3:02:19.420 --> 3:02:22.620]  to go to the bohemian grove club and act like he's a conservative
[3:02:22.620 --> 3:02:25.580]  when he's anything but i think he actually denied that he went to the
[3:02:25.580 --> 3:02:27.900]  bohemian grove when he was confronted about it
[3:02:27.900 --> 3:02:32.940]  or he said you know something ridiculous about it oh it doesn't exist
[3:02:32.940 --> 3:02:37.740]  but this woman apparently uh says that gun ownership is unconstitutional so i'm
[3:02:37.740 --> 3:02:41.340]  going to read the article and we'll see what we'll see what we got
[3:02:41.340 --> 3:02:44.940]  president obama may has made a bold choice to replace supreme court justice
[3:02:44.940 --> 3:02:49.100]  david suitor with appeals court justice uh sonia sotomayor miss sotomayor if
[3:02:49.100 --> 3:02:53.020]  confirmed be the first hispanic justice and would be only the third woman on
[3:02:53.020 --> 3:02:55.340]  the court sotomayor's resume is impressive
[3:02:55.340 --> 3:02:58.700]  including a 1993 ruling in favor of a homeless man
[3:02:58.700 --> 3:03:03.420]  beaten by nypd uh officers and her landmark decision in 2002
[3:03:03.420 --> 3:03:07.340]  regarding terrorism suspects in that case she determined that suspects captured
[3:03:07.340 --> 3:03:11.340]  on the battlefield must receive all rights afforded to american citizens
[3:03:11.340 --> 3:03:15.740]  under the constitution her controversial uh decision was later overturned
[3:03:15.740 --> 3:03:19.340]  by an appellate court but still influenced current policy
[3:03:19.340 --> 3:03:23.180]  sotomayor is a graduate of princeton university where her legal uh
[3:03:23.180 --> 3:03:26.700]  these uh thesis include race in american classroom
[3:03:26.700 --> 3:03:30.780]  and underlying injustice american exceptionalism and permanent bigotry
[3:03:30.780 --> 3:03:31.980]  well she's the bigot
[3:03:31.980 --> 3:03:35.900]  she's the one saying that for some reason her ethnicity is going to make her
[3:03:35.900 --> 3:03:39.340]  more often than not have a better decision than a white man
[3:03:39.340 --> 3:03:43.100]  i mean what does that even mean how do you know again base your decisions on
[3:03:43.100 --> 3:03:47.100]  the content of somebody's car character not the color of their skin
[3:03:47.100 --> 3:03:50.860]  not the not the religious beliefs the content of their character
[3:03:50.860 --> 3:03:53.500]  whether they believe in the constitution of bill right especially for this
[3:03:53.500 --> 3:03:57.740]  job and deadly obsession american gun culture
[3:03:57.740 --> 3:04:01.660]  in this text the student sotomayor explained that the second amendment to
[3:04:01.660 --> 3:04:06.460]  the constitution did not actually afford individual citizens the right to bare
[3:04:06.460 --> 3:04:10.300]  arms but only duly conferred organizations like the
[3:04:10.300 --> 3:04:14.540]  military no that's not correct ma'am
[3:04:14.540 --> 3:04:18.140]  instead of making guns illegal she argues that they'll they'll they have been
[3:04:18.140 --> 3:04:22.780]  illegal for individuals to own since the passing of the bill of rights
[3:04:22.780 --> 3:04:27.180]  wow we need to get deadly obsession american gun culture in the office if
[3:04:27.180 --> 3:04:30.220]  you're listening audience if you're listening if there's an

[3:04:37.180 --> 3:04:39.420]  saying that we don't have a second amendment right
[3:04:39.420 --> 3:04:43.260]  no the if the reason that we have guns is because the military has guns and the
[3:04:43.260 --> 3:04:45.980]  police have guns and it's a stopped tyranny
[3:04:45.980 --> 3:04:49.740]  well organized militias also you know keeping your persons and property safe
[3:04:49.740 --> 3:04:52.700]  she's absolutely ridiculous and that's just another strike against her

[3:04:55.660 --> 3:05:00.380]  comes to the light it's the alex joneshow back after this

[3:09:10.780 --> 3:09:16.140]  he's so much well-prepared analysis and information in info wars dot com
[3:09:16.140 --> 3:09:21.580]  and presently dot com as comments mixed in with all the profanity and
[3:09:21.580 --> 3:09:24.860]  insanity that comes along with the first amendment people complain about that
[3:09:24.860 --> 3:09:28.300]  but we try to leave it as free and wild west as possible
[3:09:28.300 --> 3:09:32.060]  i want listeners who want to write articles write comments write research
[3:09:32.060 --> 3:09:36.220]  papers some of the incredible stuff we see in the present planet dot com forum
[3:09:36.220 --> 3:09:40.060]  to start submitting that but what's the email right now how about
[3:09:40.060 --> 3:09:48.060]  how about stories uh at info wars dot com because it was
[3:09:48.060 --> 3:09:52.220]  last saturday that i saw a comment on the story
[3:09:52.220 --> 3:09:55.500]  and then they're gonna read it because i get so much good info
[3:09:55.500 --> 3:10:01.340]  and it was a link to a mainstream gun website i forget which one
[3:10:01.340 --> 3:10:06.620]  shoot or something and it was quotes of her in newspapers
[3:10:06.620 --> 3:10:10.620]  and quotes of her in that book it listed that book
[3:10:10.620 --> 3:10:15.340]  and then i did some searching and found the actual stories i found a few of
[3:10:15.340 --> 3:10:18.700]  them but my printer was out of printing paper
[3:10:18.700 --> 3:10:22.380]  so i ended up not covering on sunday and i wrote a note
[3:10:22.380 --> 3:10:26.540]  saying cover this and then i forgot so i'm listening to you
[3:10:26.540 --> 3:10:28.940]  and you bring it up that's what we've got you down here barman because you're
[3:10:28.940 --> 3:10:31.900]  such a great new town and they're and are addicted to
[3:10:31.900 --> 3:10:35.580]  knowing more info like i am so it's a perfect you know two piece in a pod
[3:10:35.580 --> 3:10:39.900]  but again i find that's my frustration there's hundreds and hundreds of things
[3:10:39.900 --> 3:10:42.860]  i'd say 50 percent of stuff i come across i don't cover on air
[3:10:42.860 --> 3:10:46.700]  because there's so much of it this woman
[3:10:46.700 --> 3:10:50.300]  is just like the attorney general who argued last year you want the source
[3:10:50.300 --> 3:10:53.260]  from you know obama keeps saying there's no such thing it's all a lie
[3:10:53.260 --> 3:10:57.100]  i just want reasonable gun control well reasonable means all of us turning our
[3:10:57.100 --> 3:11:00.780]  guns in obama as state senator and as u.s senator
[3:11:00.780 --> 3:11:04.220]  attorney general eric holder as deputy attorney general
[3:11:04.220 --> 3:11:08.220]  and then last year arguing for the gun control groups
[3:11:08.220 --> 3:11:13.420]  before the supreme court in the dc gunman case he said no citizens be able to
[3:11:13.420 --> 3:11:17.820]  own guns he went on to say the same thing some of them
[3:11:17.820 --> 3:11:21.820]  may or said obama said the same thing in his
[3:11:21.820 --> 3:11:25.980]  book uh that he wrote the call for the youth brigade to the white outseep of
[3:11:25.980 --> 3:11:29.900]  staff called for that when he was a congressman he tried to pass these
[3:11:29.900 --> 3:11:33.340]  bills they have bills where they can ban you owning a gun
[3:11:33.340 --> 3:11:36.700]  without a judge without a jury without an indictment without a charge without an
[3:11:36.700 --> 3:11:40.460]  arrest there is no doubt they are coming
[3:11:40.460 --> 3:11:44.700]  for your guns they are coming for them now
[3:11:44.700 --> 3:11:49.180]  and we've got to i mean this monster is part of a supremacist
[3:11:49.180 --> 3:11:51.980]  organization notice how only whites can be racist
[3:11:51.980 --> 3:11:55.340]  so they call it reverse racism no this is tribalism
[3:11:55.340 --> 3:11:59.580]  she's part of her tribal group the globalist one race pimp
[3:11:59.580 --> 3:12:02.700]  they want to divide everybody that's why they love her
[3:12:02.700 --> 3:12:05.740]  because the globalist want to destroy u.s sovereignty
[3:12:05.740 --> 3:12:08.780]  and want to try to make the spanish racist just like they want to make black
[3:12:08.780 --> 3:12:12.380]  racist and white racist all the name of multiculturalism
[3:12:12.380 --> 3:12:16.940]  it actually intensifies it and increases it to divide and conquer
[3:12:16.940 --> 3:12:20.780]  but the fact that she's part of a group whose slogan is for the race everything
[3:12:20.780 --> 3:12:24.860]  for those outside the race nothing uh la rosa that means the race
[3:12:24.860 --> 3:12:29.420]  uh on the board that is nothing for the race group
[3:12:29.420 --> 3:12:34.380]  uh the issue is she is openly a treasonous large sentence worm
[3:12:34.380 --> 3:12:38.220]  who openly has declared war on the second amendment and that's the argument
[3:12:38.220 --> 3:12:42.940]  that obama rama manual eric holder and her
[3:12:42.940 --> 3:12:47.980]  have all said they claim that the second amendment only means the military
[3:12:47.980 --> 3:12:52.380]  and they argue that only the national guard can be armed in the united states
[3:12:52.380 --> 3:12:56.300]  and their paramilitary enforcer police when the national guard didn't exist
[3:12:56.300 --> 3:13:01.020]  until 1902 and when clearly the founding fathers
[3:13:01.020 --> 3:13:05.100]  they had a i had uh gone a lot on the professor about this
[3:13:05.100 --> 3:13:08.780]  they had that other professor out of illinois and and and lot exposed him
[3:13:08.780 --> 3:13:13.100]  and got him fired but we actually made a made the call for the
[3:13:13.100 --> 3:13:16.860]  investigation and got the ball rolling i forget the professor's name
[3:13:16.860 --> 3:13:20.300]  five years ago he wrote a book saying no one owned guns the founding fathers
[3:13:20.300 --> 3:13:23.420]  were anti-gun the second amendment actually took everybody's
[3:13:23.420 --> 3:13:28.140]  guns he did fake research we exposed it and there was
[3:13:28.140 --> 3:13:31.580]  investigation and he lost his tenure thanks to uh
[3:13:31.580 --> 3:13:34.620]  professor lot another's exposing him so the issue is
[3:13:34.620 --> 3:13:38.620]  these criminal liars want your property want your farm
[3:13:38.620 --> 3:13:42.220]  want your ranch want your business want your kids want to control your
[3:13:42.220 --> 3:13:45.500]  reproductive life what one shall policies these
[3:13:45.500 --> 3:13:49.580]  puss sucking maggots of hell this enemy of the republic
[3:13:49.580 --> 3:13:54.940]  the swollen communist which or wants to destroy our republic and she needs to
[3:13:54.940 --> 3:13:59.020]  be seen for what she is we must absolutely ensure that even if she
[3:13:59.020 --> 3:14:02.700]  does get confirmation everyone knows the government is an
[3:14:02.700 --> 3:14:06.940]  abomination of evil and wickedness and they want our guns
[3:14:06.940 --> 3:14:10.300]  and they are coming after our guns and if you read the supreme court ruling
[3:14:10.300 --> 3:14:14.060]  they said they can restrict our second amendment under law so they're saying
[3:14:14.060 --> 3:14:16.460]  the second amendment is a right for them this
[3:14:16.460 --> 3:14:21.020]  imperial military officer to take our gun this will start world war three in
[3:14:21.020 --> 3:14:24.540]  this country we have got to avert this happening i know most police are pro
[3:14:24.540 --> 3:14:28.700]  second amendment then you need to speak out against the bug cops nationwide
[3:14:28.700 --> 3:14:31.580]  coming after the second amendment but listen i'm going to get out of here i
[3:14:31.580 --> 3:14:35.420]  just we need the listeners to not just write

[3:17:46.060 --> 3:17:51.420]  this nefarious purposes and uh you know so that's what you know that'll bring
[3:17:51.420 --> 3:17:54.220]  me into this story and i appreciate the call my man because
[3:17:54.220 --> 3:17:57.100]  you know i've been talking about how this is an extension not just for the
[3:17:57.100 --> 3:18:01.260]  census but really google which is in with nasa which is going to become
[3:18:01.260 --> 3:18:04.620]  kind kind of like one of those front organizations didn't start out as a
[3:18:04.620 --> 3:18:06.620]  front organization for the government but with
[3:18:06.620 --> 3:18:09.980]  the implementation of google earth where they are literally
[3:18:09.980 --> 3:18:14.620]  mapping the world and having street views across the country
[3:18:14.620 --> 3:18:18.220]  developers analysts have high expectations for google
[3:18:18.220 --> 3:18:21.260]  i o google will hold on wednesday and thursday
[3:18:21.260 --> 3:18:25.100]  it's a largest event of the year for external developers
[3:18:25.100 --> 3:18:28.860]  a constituency that it's uh views as critically important of the health of
[3:18:28.860 --> 3:18:33.020]  its business and online services about 3500 developers will attend
[3:18:33.020 --> 3:18:35.980]  google i o in uh san francisco's moscon center
[3:18:35.980 --> 3:18:39.020]  where speakers from google and other companies will participate in more than
[3:18:39.020 --> 3:18:42.620]  80 sessions and a hundred technical demos
[3:18:42.620 --> 3:18:46.860]  however the second annual edition of i o still finds google in a weaker position
[3:18:46.860 --> 3:18:50.940]  with developers than competitors like facebook and microsoft say ray valdez
[3:18:50.940 --> 3:18:54.220]  a gardener analyst google has been successful in this attracting a wide
[3:18:54.220 --> 3:18:59.180]  range of developers for a few very narrow scope areas like google maps
[3:18:59.180 --> 3:19:02.300]  see google maps is definitely the one you have to work
[3:19:02.300 --> 3:19:05.900]  look at and google earth they want iphone apps they want
[3:19:05.900 --> 3:19:09.900]  every single piece of this country mapped
[3:19:09.900 --> 3:19:13.500]  photographed and taped just just go there i mean
[3:19:13.500 --> 3:19:17.020]  in loose change second edition when uh when dylan used you know google earth
[3:19:17.020 --> 3:19:20.780]  it was still in pretty much a beta format it was
[3:19:20.780 --> 3:19:25.420]  just it was new it looked cool hey this is neat but now it has gone to another
[3:19:25.420 --> 3:19:30.220]  level and now that the census is going and gpsing all these homes
[3:19:30.220 --> 3:19:34.140]  yet you can bet it's only going to get bigger and bigger and the control grid
[3:19:34.140 --> 3:19:38.460]  will continue to expand and if we don't step up there's going to be a camera on
[3:19:38.460 --> 3:19:43.180]  every street there's going to be a red jacket on every corner
[3:19:43.180 --> 3:19:47.020]  all in the name of the lord obama and the new world order we'll be back after
[3:19:47.020 --> 3:19:49.660]  this it's the alex joneshow on jason bermas sitting in
[3:19:49.660 --> 3:20:01.580]  we're going to go into delton mike and more after this
[3:20:01.580 --> 3:20:05.740]  spring time now that you've planted your organic garden how we keep the bugs
[3:20:05.740 --> 3:20:08.220]  away without using toxic chemicals and poisons

[3:26:11.340 --> 3:26:16.220]  of these callers let's go to uh... delton in detroit you're on the air
[3:26:16.220 --> 3:26:21.020]  hey jason how are you i'm all right and uh... hey alex let's turn up the
[3:26:21.020 --> 3:26:23.580]  radio and go fishing man you know what i mean
[3:26:23.580 --> 3:26:27.340]  a show's almost over 34 minutes hopefully he'll be out on the beach with the
[3:26:27.340 --> 3:26:30.940]  kids or you know strolling down the highway i you know he deserves a break
[3:26:30.940 --> 3:26:33.180]  i mean he is a family man for god's sakes and
[3:26:33.180 --> 3:26:36.540]  you know i i think he's the only one in the office that's really here more than
[3:26:36.540 --> 3:26:40.460]  i am i'm i'm i'm a slave to my job i don't know rob do's here a lot too he's
[3:26:40.460 --> 3:26:43.740]  been coming in late nights i mean there there are a lot of dedicated people here
[3:26:43.740 --> 3:26:46.620]  but there's no one dedicated like alex jones
[3:26:46.620 --> 3:26:49.020]  and i don't know how the family put up with them know that he must be much
[3:26:49.020 --> 3:26:52.780]  public country and uh... have you ever had
[3:26:52.780 --> 3:26:56.380]  james westley wall on the show he's the author
[3:26:56.380 --> 3:27:00.460]  of the book patriots surviving the economic collapse
[3:27:00.460 --> 3:27:04.060]  and that does sound like that sounds familiar
[3:27:04.060 --> 3:27:08.060]  i think that uh... i think jones has had him on i know i haven't had him on but
[3:27:08.060 --> 3:27:11.820]  uh... you know i i can't keep up over every show in the past three years
[3:27:11.820 --> 3:27:14.860]  i'll look into it but i'm almost a hundred percent positive jones has him
[3:27:14.860 --> 3:27:17.020]  on the program before
[3:27:17.020 --> 3:27:20.060]  you do great with uh... guess i'd love to hear him on your show
[3:27:20.060 --> 3:27:23.500]  um but it's a great book everyone to get it's written in a novel format but
[3:27:23.500 --> 3:27:27.420]  it's a guide and it gives great equipment that everybody should have in
[3:27:27.420 --> 3:27:29.660]  their family groups of five you know and their family
[3:27:29.660 --> 3:27:32.140]  the five that want to survive in rough times
[3:27:32.140 --> 3:27:34.700]  and i was wondering if you could talk to him if you heard about geithner over in
[3:27:34.700 --> 3:27:36.780]  china because china is really upset about
[3:27:36.780 --> 3:27:39.580]  the printing frenzy going on over at the federal reserve
[3:27:39.580 --> 3:27:42.940]  well i know that china's been to openly talking about dumping the dollar and i
[3:27:42.940 --> 3:27:45.820]  was aware that geithner was going over there for a couple days to have a
[3:27:45.820 --> 3:27:49.740]  conference with chinese leaders i had not seen any mainstream media covering
[3:27:49.740 --> 3:27:52.380]  that conference and what has been said but
[3:27:52.380 --> 3:27:56.620]  china's obviously very upset russia has dropped the dollar as its reserve
[3:27:56.620 --> 3:27:58.780]  currency apparently they're using rubles
[3:27:58.780 --> 3:28:03.180]  uh... brazil is is in in line to do the same peter schiff is out there saying
[3:28:03.180 --> 3:28:06.060]  you know basically what lindsay williams said on my program
[3:28:06.060 --> 3:28:10.060]  on now almost two months ago that the dollar is completely going to go under
[3:28:10.060 --> 3:28:12.940]  you know i don't know if that's true but it's certainly a possibility
[3:28:12.940 --> 3:28:17.260]  with it being dropped as the world reserve currency
[3:28:17.260 --> 3:28:20.540]  is there are they part of would you consider the
[3:28:20.540 --> 3:28:24.460]  the movement toward the new world order i'll tell you what putin is a total
[3:28:24.460 --> 3:28:28.540]  establishment total kgb um... you know that if they there's a
[3:28:28.540 --> 3:28:31.820]  there's warring sex you know putin doesn't want to see russia

[3:28:35.100 --> 3:28:38.780]  russia be a first world nation in the in the new world order and
[3:28:38.780 --> 3:28:41.020]  you know putin's been around a long time
[3:28:41.020 --> 3:28:44.220]  you look at some nineteen eighties photographs when he was in the kgb
[3:28:44.220 --> 3:28:48.940]  he's sitting there posing as a photographer as reagan and gorbachev
[3:28:48.940 --> 3:28:52.380]  have a photo op with a little boy you know i mean that's how they embed these
[3:28:52.380 --> 3:28:56.620]  guys and then later on you know through his ruthlessness he rises to the top
[3:28:56.620 --> 3:29:00.860]  he's well aware of a plan for you know a global government he's part of that but
[3:29:00.860 --> 3:29:04.300]  at the same time you know he wants his role not to be
[3:29:04.300 --> 3:29:07.420]  squelched by nato not to be coerced you know he's not happy
[3:29:07.420 --> 3:29:11.580]  that georgia you know sneak attack south osetia while they're running drills

[3:29:19.020 --> 3:29:22.460]  i'm sure he's not happy about that but at the same time while that's going on

[3:33:57.340 --> 3:34:00.940]  over at info wars and prison planet right now
[3:34:00.940 --> 3:34:05.260]  but right now we're joined by jim newcomer of mitis resources to tell us
[3:34:05.260 --> 3:34:08.060]  about what's happening with gold it's on the rise again
[3:34:08.060 --> 3:34:11.580]  and the great deals that you can get because they locked in lower prices
[3:34:11.580 --> 3:34:14.540]  just a week ago when they're passing the savings onto you
[3:34:14.540 --> 3:34:18.220]  jim how are you doing this evening i'm doing fine jason it's nice to hear you
[3:34:18.220 --> 3:34:21.260]  nice to hear you too so why don't you tell people the great deals that are over
[3:34:21.260 --> 3:34:24.540]  at mitis right now and why it's so important really to get into the
[3:34:24.540 --> 3:34:28.540]  gold and precious metals market as this is the only thing that has really
[3:34:28.540 --> 3:34:31.340]  retained value over the last 6000 years
[3:34:31.340 --> 3:34:35.020]  yeah the precious metals have been the standard since the beginning of time
[3:34:35.020 --> 3:34:38.380]  now you know they used to say that uh a 20 gold piece was
[3:34:38.380 --> 3:34:41.820]  would exchange for a toga and sandals at the roman days
[3:34:41.820 --> 3:34:45.820]  that same one ounce of gold or one ounce piece that same one ounce piece would
[3:34:45.820 --> 3:34:51.180]  buy a fine suit of clothes in 1929 and 1933 when they confiscated the metals
[3:34:51.180 --> 3:34:56.220]  at that point it was worth 20 and uh 65 cents the same is true today at least
[3:34:56.220 --> 3:34:59.820]  it is here in minneapolis where uh you know a one ounce gold piece is going to
[3:34:59.820 --> 3:35:02.620]  run about a thousand to eleven hundred dollars and we can buy a pretty fine
[3:35:02.620 --> 3:35:05.180]  suit of clothes up here i don't know about the rest of the country maybe out
[3:35:05.180 --> 3:35:08.300]  there in hollywood or new york city or something you're not going to get that
[3:35:08.300 --> 3:35:11.420]  fine a suit but it always retains its value and that's the
[3:35:11.420 --> 3:35:14.220]  important thing to remember about precious metals
[3:35:14.220 --> 3:35:18.300]  a lot of people will look at it as an investment it truly isn't an investment
[3:35:18.300 --> 3:35:22.300]  since it doesn't pay interest and uh you don't get any
[3:35:22.300 --> 3:35:25.420]  actual gains with it what it is it's financial insurance
[3:35:25.420 --> 3:35:28.460]  there's no dividend but it is financial insurance in that
[3:35:28.460 --> 3:35:32.780]  as the dollar devalues the value of the metal will always increase
[3:35:32.780 --> 3:35:35.740]  proportionately so if the dollar is cut in half the
[3:35:35.740 --> 3:35:37.980]  value of the precious metal is going to double
[3:35:37.980 --> 3:35:41.580]  and that's the thing that people have to keep in mind that's the reason why
[3:35:41.580 --> 3:35:47.180]  for generations for centuries really uh people in the know have put reserve money
[3:35:47.180 --> 3:35:50.620]  money that they're not going to be using in the next five ten years whatever
[3:35:50.620 --> 3:35:54.620]  into precious metals because they know that they can't lose value no matter
[3:35:54.620 --> 3:35:57.500]  what happens to the economy and quite frankly
[3:35:57.500 --> 3:36:00.460]  even if it falls a little bit as metals often do
[3:36:00.460 --> 3:36:03.580]  it's still going to maintain the same purchasing power
[3:36:03.580 --> 3:36:06.700]  that it did when it was at the higher rate because it is truly
[3:36:06.700 --> 3:36:10.940]  a commodity that will always exchange for x amount of goods and services no
[3:36:10.940 --> 3:36:13.500]  matter what the value of that commodity is that
[3:36:13.500 --> 3:36:17.740]  so we're talking today we had uh you had mentioned that
[3:36:17.740 --> 3:36:21.420]  ted had purchased these or made commitments on these metals prior to
[3:36:21.420 --> 3:36:24.540]  him leaving for europe he should be back next week he's over there
[3:36:24.540 --> 3:36:28.620]  again looking for additional coins and things that we can offer to
[3:36:28.620 --> 3:36:32.460]  your listeners on the alex jones special at at great prices
[3:36:32.460 --> 3:36:36.780]  but today we have the 20 dollar liberty this is a pre 1907
[3:36:36.780 --> 3:36:40.220]  coin now a lot of people ask well where did it come from they confiscated all the
[3:36:40.220 --> 3:36:44.300]  gold in 1933 fact of the matter is these are coins
[3:36:44.300 --> 3:36:48.300]  that were transferred from our federal reserve to foreign central banks
[3:36:48.300 --> 3:36:53.740]  to pay for foreign debt when the gold was confiscated in this country in 1933
[3:36:53.740 --> 3:36:58.540]  and our government offered 20 and 65 cents for a 20 dollar gold piece
[3:36:58.540 --> 3:37:02.220]  these foreign bankers took a look at the money they had sitting on their shelves
[3:37:02.220 --> 3:37:05.500]  over there and said well wait a minute the world rate or the world
[3:37:05.500 --> 3:37:10.220]  market value is at 35 dollars so they recognized the scam that our government
[3:37:10.220 --> 3:37:12.940]  was perpetrating and they just held on to it
[3:37:12.940 --> 3:37:15.900]  so they're all in real good shape they were transferred from the federal
[3:37:15.900 --> 3:37:19.180]  reserve to central banks and literally sat on the shelf
[3:37:19.180 --> 3:37:23.100]  in the early 1970s when the ownership of gold was freed up they started coming
[3:37:23.100 --> 3:37:26.140]  back in but we do have the 20 dollar liberty series
[3:37:26.140 --> 3:37:29.500]  that's pre 1907 it's the most commonly traded coin
[3:37:29.500 --> 3:37:36.220]  in the private gold market and that's at 1627 today the 10 dollar liberty which
[3:37:36.220 --> 3:37:40.700]  is a half ounce coin is at 799 in addition
[3:37:40.700 --> 3:37:43.820]  the ever popular Lakota national silver rounds
[3:37:43.820 --> 3:37:47.740]  are offered at 20 and 50 cents or a roll price
[3:37:47.740 --> 3:37:52.220]  of 410 dollars we also have the Franklin half dollar
[3:37:52.220 --> 3:37:56.940]  offered at 880 or the roll price of 176 this is a great coin
[3:37:56.940 --> 3:38:00.140]  should it collapse completely that would be used for barter
[3:38:00.140 --> 3:38:03.820]  everybody recognizes it everybody would know what the value of it was
[3:38:03.820 --> 3:38:07.820]  if that did occur in addition the two foreign coins the British sovereign
[3:38:07.820 --> 3:38:12.780]  that's at 278.90 today that's the coin that was carried by the allied flyers
[3:38:12.780 --> 3:38:17.340]  from World War two through the Iraqi war over there that was the coin that they
[3:38:17.340 --> 3:38:21.820]  used was in their survival kit they used to buy themselves out of harm's way
[3:38:21.820 --> 3:38:27.900]  and the 20 franc coin which is either Belgian Swiss or French at 225.90 that's
[3:38:27.900 --> 3:38:31.740]  a fifth ounce coin so i think that you know folks out
[3:38:31.740 --> 3:38:34.780]  there if you have any questions about the precious metals at all
[3:38:34.780 --> 3:38:38.380]  call and talk to the brokers we have 32 of them here
[3:38:38.380 --> 3:38:44.780]  call 800-686-2237 ask for the alex special these are all for the alex
[3:38:44.780 --> 3:38:49.660]  jones listeners but remember call 800-686-2237
[3:38:49.660 --> 3:38:53.100]  and there's somebody going to be here to help you call this afternoon call this
[3:38:53.100 --> 3:38:55.420]  evening i'm sure there'll be people here until midnight
[3:38:55.420 --> 3:38:59.740]  but get called now the demand for these metals is growing
[3:38:59.740 --> 3:39:02.860]  rapidly and it's not going to be available forever
[3:39:02.860 --> 3:39:07.020]  and jim before you go i just want to reiterate the fact that
[3:39:07.020 --> 3:39:10.380]  you know back in the day when i started listening to alex jones when i was just
[3:39:10.380 --> 3:39:15.020]  becoming informed just becoming a fan they were pitching gold back in 2003
[3:39:15.020 --> 3:39:19.740]  at 275 to you know 330 340 an ounce and today
[3:39:19.740 --> 3:39:22.620]  you know like i said at the lowest you're going to see it a little less than
[3:39:22.620 --> 3:39:26.220]  800 dollars when you see it sold on ebay you're talking about a thousand 1100
[3:39:26.220 --> 3:39:30.220]  dollars for an ounce of gold it is basically tripled in value in six
[3:39:30.220 --> 3:39:33.900]  years what what else out there has done so and like
[3:39:33.900 --> 3:39:35.660]  you said it's not really a tripling in value
[3:39:35.660 --> 3:39:39.980]  because the dollar has been devalued that much in these past six years yeah
[3:39:39.980 --> 3:39:43.820]  and people don't realize that why don't you just explain that phenomenon
[3:39:43.820 --> 3:39:47.980]  well um if you take uh if you take a dollar and today it buys
[3:39:47.980 --> 3:39:51.820]  x amount of goods and services and you go out and print more money
[3:39:51.820 --> 3:39:54.860]  and flood it into the market like the treasury has done
[3:39:54.860 --> 3:39:58.220]  now you have twice as much money competing for that commodity well no
[3:39:58.220 --> 3:40:01.340]  matter what the commodity is in the case of gold
[3:40:01.340 --> 3:40:04.780]  it means that by doubling the currency out in circulation
[3:40:04.780 --> 3:40:08.060]  you have twice as much currency the value of those commodities will double in
[3:40:08.060 --> 3:40:11.260]  price in comparison to the currency so and that's
[3:40:11.260 --> 3:40:14.060]  pretty much what's happening today there's been so much
[3:40:14.060 --> 3:40:17.020]  so much currency introduced into the system now
[3:40:17.020 --> 3:40:21.500]  my lord it's more than actually was printed since the country was founded
[3:40:21.500 --> 3:40:25.900]  and we're getting ourselves into a situation that's it's just untenable
[3:40:25.900 --> 3:40:29.260]  the dollar has to collapse you had talked earlier i think about the
[3:40:29.260 --> 3:40:33.260]  Chinese and the situation that they're in they have a an awful lot of our debt
[3:40:33.260 --> 3:40:37.820]  a ton of it and they could collapse our economy at any minute if they wanted to
[3:40:37.820 --> 3:40:41.100]  we're also their largest market so i think they're a little hesitant to do it
[3:40:41.100 --> 3:40:44.620]  but they are getting away from the dollar the Europeans are getting away from
[3:40:44.620 --> 3:40:47.740]  the dollar everybody is the european banks central banks are holding 60
[3:40:47.740 --> 3:40:50.780]  percent of their assets i believe in in hard metals
[3:40:50.780 --> 3:40:56.780]  in gold so these people are concerned and these are people in the know
[3:40:56.780 --> 3:40:59.740]  all right well other than that why don't you talk a little bit about silver and
[3:40:59.740 --> 3:41:02.620]  the Lakota rounds that you have i mean the Lakota tribe
[3:41:02.620 --> 3:41:05.180]  printing up their own currency basically they have these
[3:41:05.180 --> 3:41:08.940]  you know fifty dollar oh ounce rounds of silver i know you guys have that
[3:41:08.940 --> 3:41:12.620]  what are the some of the silver deals that you have over at Midas right now
[3:41:12.620 --> 3:41:15.660]  okay well we have all types of silver available from junk silver all the way
[3:41:15.660 --> 3:41:19.420]  up to the Lakota rounds uh regular rounds what we had the uh
[3:41:19.420 --> 3:41:24.060]  included the Lakota rounds on this at four hundred and ten dollars a roll
[3:41:24.060 --> 3:41:26.700]  the Lakota is because they're a sovereign nation can print their own
[3:41:26.700 --> 3:41:29.980]  currency so they came out with these Lakota rounds it's a beautiful coin
[3:41:29.980 --> 3:41:33.180]  it's marked at fifty dollars on the back of the coin
[3:41:33.180 --> 3:41:37.420]  um we're selling them at uh what's the price twenty dollars and fifty cents a
[3:41:37.420 --> 3:41:40.540]  piece you can't find them if you want to ebay or anywhere else you're not going
[3:41:40.540 --> 3:41:43.740]  to find them at that price and this is a coin that
[3:41:43.740 --> 3:41:47.740]  ted had made a commitment to previously but silver has done extremely well
[3:41:47.740 --> 3:41:52.300]  right now the the gold to silver ratio is about uh sixty three
[3:41:52.300 --> 3:41:55.660]  that's to say that it would take sixty three ounces of silver to buy an ounce of
[3:41:55.660 --> 3:42:00.060]  gold normally that ratio is below twenty in normal
[3:42:00.060 --> 3:42:03.580]  times it hasn't been for a long time so silver is set to really
[3:42:03.580 --> 3:42:07.740]  explode here in the future even if we had a thirty to one ratio
[3:42:07.740 --> 3:42:11.100]  silver would be selling at thirty to thirty five dollars so silver is a
[3:42:11.100 --> 3:42:14.540]  great way to get into the uh precious metals initially
[3:42:14.540 --> 3:42:17.740]  and to continue from there all right why don't you give out the uh number for
[3:42:17.740 --> 3:42:21.180]  people one more time it's mitus resources dot com and the number is
[3:42:21.180 --> 3:42:25.900]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven and call any time if you
[3:42:25.900 --> 3:42:29.180]  you know in home talk to your husband or wife uh you call us here this evening
[3:42:29.180 --> 3:42:32.940]  somebody will be here and the number again is eight hundred six eight six
[3:42:32.940 --> 3:42:36.460]  two two three seven all right thank you so much jim i really appreciate it
[3:42:36.460 --> 3:42:40.380]  you're gonna jump you got it we're gonna jump right back into your calls in a
[3:42:40.380 --> 3:42:43.420]  moment but you know i'm reading this google story
[3:42:43.420 --> 3:42:46.620]  and uh you know hidden in the article is the point that i really wanted to make
[3:42:46.620 --> 3:42:50.220]  i talked about google maps and google earth well how about rfid's
[3:42:50.220 --> 3:42:54.140]  well that's that's what one of these third party software is well star
[3:42:54.140 --> 3:42:58.620]  which operates five non-profit hospitals in the atlanta area
[3:42:58.620 --> 3:43:03.260]  zanan and his colleagues are developing rfid location-based services that will
[3:43:03.260 --> 3:43:07.340]  use google maps api as well as integrated patient
[3:43:07.340 --> 3:43:13.180]  census api that provides hospital administrators operating data straight
[3:43:13.180 --> 3:43:17.340]  to location targeted search result pages see this is getting around
[3:43:17.340 --> 3:43:21.660]  giving you a very chip you know earlier i i discussed the story where it was
[3:43:21.660 --> 3:43:25.740]  edible edible rfid chips that can track and trace you
[3:43:25.740 --> 3:43:29.900]  and this is main line news oh that doesn't exist jason there's no
[3:43:29.900 --> 3:43:33.660]  there's no edible rfid chips that's just crazy
[3:43:33.660 --> 3:43:37.180]  you're just saying that you just like to make stuff up well here it is right
[3:43:37.180 --> 3:43:40.780]  here rfid threaded scientists develop edible tag for pills
[3:43:40.780 --> 3:43:44.860]  rfid tags on packs could be a thing of the past after american scientists
[3:43:44.860 --> 3:43:49.260]  revealed an edible tag that can be used to track and trace
[3:43:49.260 --> 3:43:53.180]  and authenticate individual pills they're talking about putting
[3:43:53.180 --> 3:43:57.580]  rfid's in the medications they give you talk about brave new world
[3:43:57.580 --> 3:44:04.300]  wrapped in a 1984 orwellian package oh my god all right let's let's go to callers
[3:44:04.300 --> 3:44:09.100]  uh betty you're on the air yes jason how are you
[3:44:09.100 --> 3:44:13.820]  i'm calling from toronto um i'm just honored to be able to speak with you
[3:44:13.820 --> 3:44:19.580]  and um on the subject of you know torture and war criminals
[3:44:19.580 --> 3:44:23.500]  i would like everyone to know who's listening to this program
[3:44:23.500 --> 3:44:29.020]  that tomorrow afternoon george w bush and bill clinton are appearing at the
[3:44:29.020 --> 3:44:33.500]  toronto convention center compliments of steven harper
[3:44:33.500 --> 3:44:36.940]  oh isn't that lovely and they're going to be together and all three of them
[3:44:36.940 --> 3:44:40.780]  hand in hand nobody is aware of this when i've told my family when i've told
[3:44:40.780 --> 3:44:43.900]  anyone they said this is absolutely impossible
[3:44:43.900 --> 3:44:46.940]  and we don't understand what they think they think that bill clinton and george
[3:44:46.940 --> 3:44:50.060]  bush aren't the best of buddies behind the scenes i remember
[3:44:50.060 --> 3:44:54.380]  maybe back in 2003 when i was really you know waiting for the 911 commission to
[3:44:54.380 --> 3:44:58.060]  start their hearings and really get figuring out for myself there was no
[3:44:58.060 --> 3:45:00.940]  right or left you know there was just these two parties
[3:45:00.940 --> 3:45:04.780]  acting to oppose each other and i saw the dedication of the bill clinton
[3:45:04.780 --> 3:45:07.900]  library in dc and who's in the front row it's the
[3:45:07.900 --> 3:45:12.140]  entire bush family and it's just giggles and smiles and laughter and
[3:45:12.140 --> 3:45:15.500]  everybody's happy and everybody's best friends i mean it's all a
[3:45:15.500 --> 3:45:18.860]  show they don't really oppose each other on anything and you can watch speeches
[3:45:18.860 --> 3:45:23.500]  of bill clinton talking about the quote unquote new world order by name
[3:45:23.500 --> 3:45:26.540]  and you know praising it you know and saying oh george
[3:45:26.540 --> 3:45:29.660]  you know h w bush is a great man i mean these things
[3:45:29.660 --> 3:45:32.940]  i mean it's unbelievable to me that people buy into the fact that there's
[3:45:32.940 --> 3:45:36.460]  there's some kind of difference between the two continue

[3:46:24.460 --> 3:46:28.380]  cartoon network um really realistically where do we start you know we can talk
[3:46:28.380 --> 3:46:33.500]  about these like evil uh the evil appointment of this lady to supreme
[3:46:33.500 --> 3:46:36.700]  court i mean talk about it alex so eloquently put
[3:46:36.700 --> 3:46:41.020]  one time the uh cult of double worshiping pedophiles
[3:46:41.020 --> 3:46:44.940]  that run like cps rings i mean actually actually i remember
[3:46:44.940 --> 3:46:49.340]  um i wanted to get your take on the kevin trudeau interview with alex
[3:46:49.340 --> 3:46:52.780]  the other day sure um you know i mean do i agree with everything that kevin
[3:46:52.780 --> 3:46:55.500]  trudeau has to say but before i get into kevin trudeau
[3:46:55.500 --> 3:46:59.260]  um let me just say where do we start well you know i had a caller in the first
[3:46:59.260 --> 3:47:03.100]  hour calling me up from a story maybe a month ago out in albany they were
[3:47:03.100 --> 3:47:06.460]  trying to make it so you had to register all your ammunition where they start
[3:47:06.460 --> 3:47:09.420]  they started going to city council meetings they went before the board they
[3:47:09.420 --> 3:47:12.540]  had 80 protesters outside saying you can't put this into law
[3:47:12.540 --> 3:47:15.740]  so that's a good place to start start locally you know same thing in
[3:47:15.740 --> 3:47:19.260]  schenectady when they started saying oh we might declare martial law schenectady
[3:47:19.260 --> 3:47:22.140]  residents got up in arms they started calling their city council members they
[3:47:22.140 --> 3:47:24.380]  started calling the mayor's office they said no
[3:47:24.380 --> 3:47:27.500]  you know we have to say no at some point i think that we you know we should
[3:47:27.500 --> 3:47:31.100]  have some recourse against the supreme court with their five to four decision
[3:47:31.100 --> 3:47:34.460]  that you no longer have a lawyer now as far as kevin trudeau goes
[3:47:34.460 --> 3:47:37.660]  look you know a lot of things that he promotes are real the law of attraction
[3:47:37.660 --> 3:47:40.060]  for instance i you know i'm a strong believer
[3:47:40.060 --> 3:47:43.580]  in the law of attraction maybe not in the hokey new age way
[3:47:43.580 --> 3:47:46.860]  it's presented in the book the secret or the movie the secret but some of that
[3:47:46.860 --> 3:47:49.420]  stuff is definitely true i wouldn't be here
[3:47:49.420 --> 3:47:54.060]  without the will to do what i do and believing that it was actually possible
[3:47:54.060 --> 3:47:56.940]  and setting goals for myself and working towards that
[3:47:56.940 --> 3:48:01.020]  you know so trudeau is a big you know purveyor of that some of his debt cures
[3:48:01.020 --> 3:48:04.220]  in his latest book are real you know i've read some of the information that
[3:48:04.220 --> 3:48:06.780]  they're absolutely real some of his natural cures
[3:48:06.780 --> 3:48:09.820]  are the same things that you'll see on our sponsors websites
[3:48:09.820 --> 3:48:13.580]  so i think that he is a very uh ingenuity of guy
[3:48:13.580 --> 3:48:16.300]  you know uh whether or not he's a hundred percent honest i don't know if
[3:48:16.300 --> 3:48:19.820]  anybody's a hundred percent honest um is the room for criticism there's room
[3:48:19.820 --> 3:48:23.980]  for criticism of everybody but he is able to reach a massive
[3:48:23.980 --> 3:48:29.900]  audience and for some reason the f tc went after him with a 37 million dollar
[3:48:29.900 --> 3:48:33.660]  fine he reaches literally millions and millions of people
[3:48:33.660 --> 3:48:36.940]  you got to ask yourself why are they targeting this guy if he's not a threat
[3:48:36.940 --> 3:48:40.940]  to their establishment million dollars that's a lot of dough
[3:48:40.940 --> 3:48:45.420]  i mean i don't care who you are now 37 mil is is is a lot of cheese my friend
[3:48:45.420 --> 3:48:49.260]  hey if they ever enact a executive order 13 375 where you're
[3:48:49.260 --> 3:48:52.220]  supposed to take mask quarantines or go to prison when they can
[3:48:52.220 --> 3:48:55.180]  prison for one year or up to a 250 thousand dollar fine
[3:48:55.180 --> 3:49:00.300]  i can't afford the 250 g's i don't know about you i ain't got a rolling around
[3:49:00.300 --> 3:49:04.140]  no but uh i definitely think that the only way they take a person like me is
[3:49:04.140 --> 3:49:06.460]  with bullets or something like that you know i'm not
[3:49:06.460 --> 3:49:10.460]  i'm not going to subscribe to this like open handed you know open tyranny
[3:49:10.460 --> 3:49:14.460]  you know that these are with evil globalists really want to push you
[3:49:14.460 --> 3:49:18.380]  know it's it's it's really disgusting you know uh
[3:49:18.380 --> 3:49:23.260]  la rosa what like what the rosa stands for is just absurd you know what la rosa
[3:49:23.260 --> 3:49:27.820]  stands for at the upper echelons when you're a council member a board member
[3:49:27.820 --> 3:49:30.860]  like she is yes it is more than absurd but at the lower
[3:49:30.860 --> 3:49:34.380]  levels people don't understand what it is it's just like you know
[3:49:34.380 --> 3:49:38.700]  people who think that uh i'm trying to think that that al gore and you know
[3:49:38.700 --> 3:49:41.820]  the carbon credit system are going to save the world and people are getting
[3:49:41.820 --> 3:49:44.540]  behind the green movement and they're joining green piece and they
[3:49:44.540 --> 3:49:47.180]  think they're going to make a difference if they join pita for animals they
[3:49:47.180 --> 3:49:49.260]  don't understand it's all corrupt at the top
[3:49:49.260 --> 3:49:52.460]  you know they don't understand what the real message is and i think a lot of
[3:49:52.460 --> 3:49:55.740]  that is you know i don't want to just say every member of la rosa is
[3:49:55.740 --> 3:50:00.620]  automatically a racist i would say every member of la rosa that doesn't realize
[3:50:00.620 --> 3:50:04.140]  that there's race implications and race bias is ignorant
[3:50:04.140 --> 3:50:07.340]  you know and there are some at the top that are openly racist
[3:50:07.340 --> 3:50:11.660]  i mean the you know old habits are hard to break and some people just cannot
[3:50:11.660 --> 3:50:15.420]  get it in their head hard enough that again you should base
[3:50:15.420 --> 3:50:18.860]  your judgments on people by the content of their character
[3:50:18.860 --> 3:50:21.740]  the fruits of their actions what they stand for
[3:50:21.740 --> 3:50:26.860]  you know not you know the color or creed or religion of a person it's
[3:50:26.860 --> 3:50:29.980]  absolutely ludicrous i thank you for the call

[3:55:24.940 --> 3:55:29.340]  thank you um i wanted to suggest a movie idea to you it's called 9 11 the big
[3:55:29.340 --> 3:55:33.820]  setup and i it would exclusively cover all of
[3:55:33.820 --> 3:55:37.500]  the great volume of evidence of this great atrocity was carried out by the
[3:55:37.500 --> 3:55:41.020]  global shadow shadow government acting through its
[3:55:41.020 --> 3:55:45.500]  minions and at the highest levels of the most recent bush administration in the
[3:55:45.500 --> 3:55:49.900]  u.s intelligence community putting the evidential spotlight
[3:55:49.900 --> 3:55:54.700]  in a very big way on the actual individuals global and domestic who
[3:55:54.700 --> 3:55:59.100]  conceived planned and implemented this great crime from what's all of the
[3:55:59.100 --> 3:56:02.060]  current crimes against americans come out of
[3:56:02.060 --> 3:56:05.500]  i thought it might be powerful jason and i know you're a great filmmaker so i
[3:56:05.500 --> 3:56:08.220]  wanted to suggest that to you well i'll tell you what's going around the
[3:56:08.220 --> 3:56:11.500]  office right now you know outside of the invisible empire movie that i'm
[3:56:11.500 --> 3:56:15.260]  i'm doing and i'm going to have some pretty big high profiles
[3:56:15.260 --> 3:56:20.380]  on kissinger on brzezinski i'm gonna probably stay away from the subject of
[3:56:20.380 --> 3:56:23.740]  9 11 just because it's too intricate and i'm trying to fit this into a
[3:56:23.740 --> 3:56:28.300]  you know 120 minute picture but we're thinking and again this is maybe in the
[3:56:28.300 --> 3:56:32.220]  future who knows we don't have a huge staff they're working on obama to right
[3:56:32.220 --> 3:56:36.620]  now the jfk2 film a lot of people are asking about that that's kind of on hold
[3:56:36.620 --> 3:56:39.740]  you know we're talking about a chemtrails movie with rosalind peterson
[3:56:39.740 --> 3:56:43.980]  uh... we're doing these best of dbds but down the line what we would like to do
[3:56:43.980 --> 3:56:48.860]  kind of a profiles of the new world order and do 45 minutes
[3:56:48.860 --> 3:56:53.020]  45 to 60 minutes on these people on these individuals on a rockfeller
[3:56:53.020 --> 3:56:59.580]  on a kissinger on a brzezinski and really do a timeline of how you know they've
[3:56:59.580 --> 3:57:03.420]  influenced policies what organizations their members of some of the more
[3:57:03.420 --> 3:57:07.500]  deplorable things that are on their agenda so
[3:57:07.500 --> 3:57:10.780]  that's definitely you know something we're throwing around hopefully in the
[3:57:10.780 --> 3:57:13.740]  works i know you've got a lot of great ideas out there mark
[3:57:13.740 --> 3:57:17.420]  it's just so hard i mean hey today and tomorrow i'm doing seven hours of radio
