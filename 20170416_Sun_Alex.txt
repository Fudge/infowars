[00:00.000 --> 00:18.080]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you are receiving this
[00:18.080 --> 00:33.320]  transmission you are the resistance riders on the storm make no mistake you may try to stay
[00:33.320 --> 00:38.640]  out of the storm in your life but that puts you in the most dangerous waters because then
[00:38.640 --> 00:46.680]  you never strive you never build you never get challenged and in those doldrums of rotting
[00:46.680 --> 00:57.280]  foam and those back channel eddies your whole destiny basically dies in mediocrity and stagnation
[00:57.280 --> 01:10.760]  the world in 2017 is at a great crossroads and I am here on Friday afternoon taping a few
[01:10.760 --> 01:15.320]  intros to a big important rebroadcast we have some of the best interviews last few months
[01:15.320 --> 01:22.120]  with Michael Savage and others Daniel Estlund you name it and I am just hoping and I am pretty
[01:22.120 --> 01:27.660]  sure in my heart we won't have nuclear war by the time this broadcast is going out Trump
[01:27.660 --> 01:31.680]  has said that if North Korea keeps threatening to attack Japan or South Korea and fires missiles
[01:31.680 --> 01:35.640]  they may shoot down those missiles they do a nuclear test on the grandfathers birthday
[01:35.640 --> 01:41.160]  has been dead for 30, 40 years there is 100 something birthday that they will strike out
[01:41.160 --> 01:47.040]  as well but finally China, South Korea, Japan and the United States are all tired of North
[01:47.040 --> 01:52.200]  Korea's behavior you will never hear this there is actually a big attack because it
[01:52.200 --> 01:56.600]  will probably cause some chain reaction or I will definitely be here alive responding
[01:56.600 --> 02:02.280]  to whatever happens so this is really a celebration the fact this is on air that if you are seeing
[02:02.280 --> 02:08.280]  this on Sunday and it is taped it means I with my children have an Easter dinner and
[02:08.280 --> 02:14.800]  you are with your children your family having an Easter dinner as well you know and I have
[02:14.800 --> 02:19.400]  always been brought up a Christian I love God but I never really pushed my Christianity
[02:19.400 --> 02:24.160]  like Islamists pushed theirs or others but I had a guest on earlier last week Doug Hagman
[02:24.160 --> 02:28.560]  who said it is time for Christians to stop being so tolerant you know we are tolerant
[02:28.560 --> 02:33.680]  everybody else but they are not tolerant of us so we are so tolerant we give up our culture
[02:33.680 --> 02:37.920]  that unifies us to make them happy it doesn't make them happy and I am sorry that Christians
[02:37.920 --> 02:43.080]  everywhere build the best civilizations the best secure countries the biggest social safety
[02:43.080 --> 02:47.960]  networks the most liberal systems and then you use that very liberalism that we created
[02:47.960 --> 02:55.360]  a piss all over it because whether you have a Anglo-Saxon background or Hispanic background
[02:55.360 --> 03:04.000]  or an Asian background or an Arabic background or a whatever it is if you are a Christian
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.040]  that unifies you together on do unto others as you have them do unto you and the golden
[03:09.040 --> 03:14.680]  rule and people say oh look at this and the Bible or that okay but no one denies Christian
[03:14.680 --> 03:19.360]  countries the most prosperous and the most free so I am not going to sit here and hear
[03:19.360 --> 03:24.000]  you piss all over Christianity anymore and I am not going to sit here like some phony
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.560]  establishment preacher who wouldn't use the term piss on you or people to say don't use
[03:28.560 --> 03:32.560]  the Lord's name in vain that is what some preacher defined it when I say God damn the
[03:32.560 --> 03:37.720]  new world order to hell I mean I want God to damn them to hell that is not taking God's
[03:37.720 --> 03:47.320]  name in vain I am asking God to deliver us from these people I am asking for fire like
[03:47.320 --> 03:54.200]  Ezekiel called down from heaven against the enemies or Elijah I want them damn to hell
[03:54.200 --> 03:58.080]  not because I am in a physical war with them I want to see them hurt from some psychopathic
[03:58.080 --> 04:02.520]  perspective but because they are waging war against us and I have had enough of the new
[04:02.520 --> 04:07.800]  world order and the devil worshipers and the pedophiles and the radical Islamists in all
[04:07.800 --> 04:14.440]  the other cults I want them out of my way because I am a lover not a fighter but I am
[04:14.440 --> 04:18.800]  tired of lovers being such lovers we roll over and realize if we are real lovers we
[04:18.800 --> 04:24.240]  got to be fighters because the greatest fighters are the lovers we are not fighters but we
[04:24.240 --> 04:29.520]  are willing to fight because we love people and when we fight it is much stronger so on
[04:29.520 --> 04:36.160]  this Easter Sunday as Christ rose from the dead after 3 days like Lazarus I call on the
[04:36.160 --> 04:42.640]  human spirit the spirit of the life force Christ God's spirit in us the Holy Spirit
[04:42.640 --> 04:46.200]  we are made the image of God Christ is that archetype of what we can build towards to
[04:46.200 --> 04:52.400]  move upon the face of the world but the spirit of evil in 2017 be broken then we all pray
[04:52.400 --> 04:57.080]  that together big hour coming up and I will come back with one more transmission at the

[06:27.200 --> 06:32.040]  said it was a false flag chemical attack the former top British ambassador has come out
[06:32.040 --> 06:37.320]  and said that it was a false flag attack Peter Ford he said now the jihadis will launch more
[06:37.320 --> 06:42.840]  false flags and draw Trump in Vladimir Putin has come out and said it but it hasn't gotten
[06:42.840 --> 06:47.880]  any attention like Michael Savage best-selling author probably the number one or number two
[06:47.880 --> 06:52.840]  talk show host in the United States coming on the broadcast right now exclusively in
[06:52.840 --> 06:57.680]  about an hour he hosts his own broadcast despite the fact he's under the weather his new best
[06:57.680 --> 07:03.520]  selling book Trump's war warrants on page 233 Trump's war against the deep state and
[07:03.520 --> 07:07.480]  he warrants in the chapter I read the book a month ago of them trying to get him into
[07:07.480 --> 07:12.840]  war so that's why they call him Dr. Savage I won't go into all his degrees medical degrees
[07:12.840 --> 07:19.440]  you name it but exclusively it joins us here zero hedge Roger Port has it Michael Savage
[07:19.440 --> 07:24.200]  turns on Trump says Syrian gas attack was false flag I don't think it's turning on Trump
[07:24.200 --> 07:29.240]  it's warning Trump maybe I'm wrong but CNN saying he's turned on Trump I don't want to
[07:29.240 --> 07:33.560]  put words in his mouth I haven't gotten his total view on this but Dr. Savage of Michael
[07:33.560 --> 07:46.360]  Savage.com am I wrong to say you haven't turned your death Trump that's the bourbon in the
[07:46.360 --> 07:54.120]  left trying to divide and conquer once again it's the garbage okay the garbage of the world
[07:54.120 --> 07:55.120]  in the media.
[07:55.120 --> 07:56.120]  I don't know whether we can reach Trump that's the problem I don't know who he's listening
[07:56.120 --> 07:59.360]  to well I did talk to let's just say I did get what the president thought this week and
[07:59.360 --> 08:03.040]  I'll tell you later I know you just had dinner with him a few weeks ago but let's let's just
[08:03.040 --> 08:06.960]  say you've got the floor sir so just roll this out why you're so concerned.
[08:06.960 --> 08:13.080]  Let's start with all the people you mentioned but let's go the other way who is supporting
[08:13.080 --> 08:20.640]  this the worst people on the planet are saluting Trump to read Zachariah Mr. Crazy Eyes Lindsey
[08:20.640 --> 08:25.920]  Graham the weirdest man in the history of the Senate John McCain the psycho when he when
[08:25.920 --> 08:30.720]  he speaks you could see insanity they're all saluting Donald Trump these are the people
[08:30.720 --> 08:35.880]  we hated before the election these are the people rejected during the election now they're
[08:35.880 --> 08:41.680]  on Trump's side along with these the crypto pseudo conservatives in the radio business
[08:41.680 --> 08:47.400]  who hold themselves up as great conservatives who were screaming for war Alex the world
[08:47.400 --> 08:51.920]  is upside down if you can keep your head while all those around you are losing theirs
[08:51.920 --> 08:56.120]  and blaming it on you then you'll be a man my son greatest one of the greatest lines
[08:56.120 --> 09:00.840]  ever written something I've carried with me since I'm 18 years old if you can keep your
[09:00.840 --> 09:03.960]  head all those around you are losing theirs and blaming it on you then you'll be a man
[09:03.960 --> 09:09.400]  my son Alex we are being tested like we have never been tested before I don't know how we
[09:09.400 --> 09:12.840]  come out of this because I don't know if Donald Trump is listening to a word anyone is saying
[09:12.840 --> 09:20.400]  to him other than this this inner cadre around him somebody has turned him now let's look
[09:20.400 --> 09:27.280]  at the big picture in the period of only one week because of a few propaganda photos of
[09:27.280 --> 09:34.280]  a terrible tragedy conducted by we don't know whom the president has now launched wars
[09:34.280 --> 09:40.760]  and threatened wars against three nations China Russia North Korea but more than that
[09:40.760 --> 09:47.520]  did you see Alex here's the strangest part of it all for a smart man why would he conduct
[09:47.520 --> 09:53.360]  these absurd limp wristed missile strikes while the Chinese guests are sitting with him at
[09:53.360 --> 09:59.360]  Mar-a-Lago does anyone not understand protocol do they not understand diplomacy do they understand
[09:59.360 --> 10:03.880]  that's probably one of the greatest breaches of diplomacy I've ever seen in my lifetime
[10:03.880 --> 10:08.600]  this was like saying to the Chinese hello small stupid men with shiny heads are you
[10:08.600 --> 10:13.280]  enjoying my meal well f you as I've just launched missiles now what do you have to say about
[10:13.280 --> 10:20.280]  it what kind of presidency is this I will agree I'll agree it's very very very provocative
[10:20.280 --> 10:25.200]  well you're being more diplomatic than I was just saying an awful lot maybe it's because
[10:25.200 --> 10:28.680]  I have the flu and I have the fever and I'm not thinking clearly no you're thinking very
[10:28.680 --> 10:34.320]  clearly in fact every every veteran I talked to every person I talked to I say 85% of the
[10:34.320 --> 10:38.880]  audience is absolutely freaked out about what's happening and I'll tell you who you know who
[10:38.880 --> 10:43.280]  he listens to I'll tell you who Trump listens to late at night they've taken his phone away
[10:43.280 --> 10:46.800]  they only let negative stuff go on Twitter he doesn't get any positive comments there
[10:46.800 --> 10:50.920]  he would do feedback there he listens to Michael Savage he listens to info wars he looks at
[10:50.920 --> 10:56.200]  drudge report probably more than us combined let's just say it so how does he listen to
[10:56.200 --> 11:01.880]  me if I'm off of the air he he goes and finds clips on YouTube I know for a fact the point
[11:01.880 --> 11:08.000]  is the point is is that he he does listen to you I got a phone call this weekend from somebody
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.320]  I'll just leave it at that saying we're not gonna do it no fly zone we're not gonna have
[11:11.320 --> 11:15.400]  war Rex Tillis is gonna come out and dial this back some people have been speaking on
[11:15.400 --> 11:19.320]  their own and notice Tillis is now done that I said that Sunday I said that Monday it's
[11:19.320 --> 11:22.880]  now happened I don't want to sit here and brag and proud of sound big but just he is
[11:22.880 --> 11:28.160]  listening to you so speak directly to the president go ahead oh my god well hello President
[11:28.160 --> 11:32.680]  Trump you said I should live another 25 years when you put your arm around me at Mar-a-Lago
[11:32.680 --> 11:38.920]  I hope you mean it because I can use another 25 minutes the way I feel my feeling is this
[11:38.920 --> 11:44.720]  Tillis and it's misleading you I have no idea why people don't see through that man it seems
[11:44.720 --> 11:50.560]  to me that it's so plain that you don't have to be a genius to see but what happened here
[11:50.560 --> 11:55.280]  what does exxon mobile gain if they cut Syria out of the gas lines they're running out of
[11:55.280 --> 12:01.880]  the Middle East to Europe what does exxon mobile gain by that Alex that's the whole story
[12:01.880 --> 12:07.720]  in a nutshell it's another war for oil it's all over again it's the same thing as 1999
[12:07.720 --> 12:13.880]  remember when Bill Clinton was mercilessly bombing the Serbian people yes for the Muslim
[12:13.880 --> 12:20.320]  article in 1999 the oily tracks run through Kosovo it was a little noticed article my
[12:20.320 --> 12:26.880]  heart was broken because Bill Clinton engaged in 78 of the worst days of my life until now
[12:26.880 --> 12:34.760]  where Bill Clinton mercilessly bombed Serbia he blew up hospitals he blew up train stations
[12:34.760 --> 12:40.760]  he blow up every bridge on the Danube River for one reason and that was to steal Kosovo
[12:40.760 --> 12:47.160]  from the Serbs to permit an oil an oil pipeline to run through Kosovo what's even worse about
[12:47.160 --> 12:52.440]  that story is the same exact elements that are now on the side of war were on the side
[12:52.440 --> 12:58.920]  of war then and the same same people and rational people who cared for the stability of the earth
[12:58.920 --> 13:05.120]  but the stability of their families were against that insane act by Bill Clinton I have not
[13:05.120 --> 13:11.280]  changed my position it's the same exact thing we cannot let crazed businessmen who put their
[13:11.280 --> 13:17.840]  bottom line ahead of the survival of the planet I'm talking about Rex Tillerson to rule this
[13:17.840 --> 13:24.920]  nation did you vote for Rex Tillerson name on the ballot no did you ever hear of that
[13:24.920 --> 13:33.520]  pro-magnum no who ever heard of that throwback where did he come from where the hell did
[13:33.520 --> 13:38.560]  that throwback come from that lowbrow looks like he crawled out of a pit somewhere any
[13:38.560 --> 13:45.800]  monster we can say all the things we want I did not elect him to the presidency I didn't
[13:45.800 --> 13:50.720]  kill myself for a year I have total faith in Donald Trump and I repeat right now what
[13:50.720 --> 13:56.320]  I said to him I would do anything for that man I have total faith in him but I don't
[13:56.320 --> 14:01.880]  understand how we cannot see through all the president's men they're misleading him they're
[14:01.880 --> 14:06.400]  taking him down a road he cannot come back absolutely that's what my if he loses you
[14:06.400 --> 14:11.480]  when he loses me tell me what happens next that they'll destroy him and he has to know
[14:11.480 --> 14:15.360]  that his base is upset but let's expand on that the British ambassador I want to ask
[14:15.360 --> 14:20.160]  you this question to Sirius said listen it's not that the sides perfect we're on the side
[14:20.160 --> 14:23.840]  of al-qaeda and ISIS they're celebrating this they're going to stage more stuff they got
[14:23.840 --> 14:29.520]  caught in 2013 they got caught last year it's official they videotaped at these jihadis
[14:29.520 --> 14:34.640]  want to be rock stars they videotape launching the chemical attacks it wasn't seren it was
[14:34.640 --> 14:38.920]  chlorine gas because the doctors are taking care of them without gloves it had putin has
[14:38.920 --> 14:42.840]  come out and said it's a false flag and he says more is planned and that's what the British
[14:42.840 --> 14:48.040]  ambassador and putin who are smart are saying is we don't want war we want to de-escalate
[14:48.040 --> 14:52.640]  this what are you going to do now trump when the jihadi stage more stuff this time in a
[14:52.640 --> 14:57.800]  lepo or in the suburbs of Damascus and then the right wing you know left wing neocons
[14:57.800 --> 15:03.000]  whatever you want to call them rhinos the war mongers like mccain and Graham say president
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.320]  you've got to do something they have painted him into a corner what more do you need to
[15:08.320 --> 15:14.280]  know than the crazy eyes of him let's let's look at the man with the craziest most dissent
[15:14.280 --> 15:19.440]  deceitful eyes in me he's our carious Zachariah one of the sickest looking faces I've ever
[15:19.440 --> 15:25.680]  seen if you were to create a puppet of deceit and hatred for America it would be Fareed Zachariah
[15:25.680 --> 15:31.560]  now Fareed Zachariah graduating Donald Trump Lindsey Graham one of the most twisted sisters
[15:31.560 --> 15:38.100]  in the history of the Senate are totally twisted Nancy he's now encouraged by the Trump
[15:38.100 --> 15:46.160]  administration John McCain who looks like what he is a totally sad broken man walking
[15:46.160 --> 15:52.560]  around like the puppet of the defense establishment saluting him and listen to this Alex again

[20:27.680 --> 20:33.920]  make war it is not a mark of strength to go to war especially when our military is depleted
[20:33.920 --> 20:40.000]  now let's look at that we all know the military is depleted the president knows that and now
[20:40.000 --> 20:46.560]  what with threatening china and russia and north korea at once when half our planes
[20:46.560 --> 20:52.520]  on aircraft carriers are inoperable what in the hell is going on here who is leading
[20:52.520 --> 20:59.360]  here who is making these decisions i want to say something on a strictly commercial
[20:59.360 --> 21:05.520]  level my book trumps war became number one on the new york times bestsell list alex with
[21:05.520 --> 21:11.200]  zero appearance on rupert murdoch's fox news never mind all of the other channels that
[21:11.200 --> 21:15.560]  shows the decline of their power not only the client of their power alex i went on your
[21:15.560 --> 21:22.960]  show drudge linked it that was all i needed why i don't need a new car i'm not looking
[21:22.960 --> 21:27.400]  to buy a new car i'm looking to save the nation you want to change the world you want you
[21:27.400 --> 21:31.000]  love your children just like i do it and fundamentally pisses you off exactly and what does that
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.480]  tell you i go on fox they still have me on a few times they wanted me to a show and stuff
[21:35.480 --> 21:40.600]  no response i go on your show you play a clip of my show you have paul watson and on we
[21:40.600 --> 21:44.200]  get millions of people visiting the site i know you get that with us because we're the
[21:44.200 --> 21:49.080]  real median here's the problem dr savage google has banned us off google ads david brock is
[21:49.080 --> 21:52.080]  bragging that they've got all these people boycotting all our sponsors we've lost almost
[21:52.080 --> 21:55.200]  all of them we think i'll be selling our own products and i'm not bitching the audience
[21:55.200 --> 22:00.240]  but here's the deal just like your book on china got banned from distribution we are under
[22:00.240 --> 22:05.560]  attack do folks know that we have the big audience we're we're fighting and the listeners
[22:05.560 --> 22:11.000]  need to know we're not the types to whine but my god are we getting censored alex again
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.600]  talking commercially because a lot of people listening who don't know these things the
[22:15.600 --> 22:21.520]  ratings just came out in streaming radio shows my show is number one in the country beating
[22:21.520 --> 22:28.320]  the great rush limbaugh by a huge number on a bunch of platforms rush limbaugh let's talk
[22:28.320 --> 22:34.840]  about him for a minute how in the world does this man not understand what he sounds like
[22:34.840 --> 22:38.120]  it's very sad well i tuned in the other day and i thought he was saying he was against
[22:38.120 --> 22:42.400]  it then he said oh i'm playing devil's advocate then he did an hour for it and i just i just
[22:42.400 --> 22:46.960]  i don't want to see him go ahead and talk about him it's what it's sad to watch a clown
[22:46.960 --> 22:51.920]  like that fall off the uh high wire alex what are we going to do to get our message across
[22:51.920 --> 22:56.720]  the donald trump does he even care what we have to say let me tell you he listens the
[22:56.720 --> 23:02.640]  problem is we ask him if you have access i don't i live out in nowhereville or way on
[23:02.640 --> 23:08.080]  the west coast no one cares what i think i guarantee you if i tell trump you want to
[23:08.080 --> 23:12.880]  meet him in marlowe go next weekend uh quite frankly i was with a family trip in hawaii
[23:12.880 --> 23:15.840]  i don't want to get the media goes crazy with us i'm not going to get into it but i let
[23:15.840 --> 23:18.960]  me just say i could have gone i just i just literally was family and i just i couldn't
[23:18.960 --> 23:24.240]  do it but i believe me sir he absolutely loves you and you know that you already had dinner
[23:24.240 --> 23:29.160]  with him if you want to go visit trump i mean you can snap your fingers i'll make a phone
[23:29.160 --> 23:34.720]  call and it'll happen well i don't want to snap fingers i would i don't mean that arrogantly
[23:34.720 --> 23:38.600]  i'm just saying he'd love to meet with you i would love to visit him not in marlowe go
[23:38.600 --> 23:43.200]  but in the white house that's what i would like to do and i would fly across the country
[23:43.200 --> 23:48.480]  i'm getting over the flu right now i fought it off with my own nutrients by the way i
[23:48.480 --> 23:51.400]  haven't had the opportunity of taking yours i'll tell you the truth i could use some of
[23:51.400 --> 23:56.560]  that selenium right now i'm pretty depleted i feel like it depleted depleted uranium
[23:56.560 --> 24:04.840]  you're working hard at 75 depleted uranium shell actually look people think this is
[24:04.840 --> 24:09.960]  a joke and they think we do this just for respect to gallows or books alex i know listening
[24:09.960 --> 24:15.160]  to your show that your heart's in it and anyone listening to me knows that my heart is in
[24:15.160 --> 24:21.080]  this i don't know how to rescue the president from his from his advisor something went wrong
[24:21.080 --> 24:27.200]  and it happened last week there must be some way to sit down with him and say please miss
[24:27.200 --> 24:33.840]  the president please in your vast array of people who you listen to please listen to
[24:33.840 --> 24:38.720]  those who helped make you what you are we're not wrong we're not crazy we're not against
[24:38.720 --> 24:43.480]  you why are you listening to the never trumpers who were pretending there for you now they're
[24:43.480 --> 24:49.120]  leading you into a a blind out of which you'll never return and that's key we're not asking
[24:49.120 --> 24:53.480]  for anything but freedom and not having war and lower taxes we're not the sick of fans
[24:53.480 --> 24:57.240]  that tried to destroy him that he tried to co-op by giving power and instead they're
[24:57.240 --> 25:01.200]  beginning to co-opt him in fact that's a key point dr. savage for me in the second you've
[25:01.200 --> 25:07.040]  got to go is that he's just surrounded they have all this national security stuff they
[25:07.040 --> 25:11.920]  took his phone away they did all this other stuff i'm out liberty to get into and he took
[25:11.920 --> 25:15.640]  his phone away they took his cell phone away claiming it would be a violation national
[25:15.640 --> 25:18.800]  security and i don't know why he let him do it because that's what he used to call me
[25:18.800 --> 25:23.520]  on now if he calls people up previs is on the phone when trump calls you now previs
[25:23.520 --> 25:28.640]  goes this is rents previs alex will you talk to trump or roger it's previs will you talk
[25:28.640 --> 25:33.080]  and then they sit there on the phone because he's the president so sir we have to do this
[25:33.080 --> 25:37.480]  to make sure russians aren't doing it and they even tried to keep me from the inauguration
[25:37.480 --> 25:41.920]  telling trump he's a russian that's he they they bully him with this so i think he struck
[25:41.920 --> 25:47.880]  syria so they stopped saying the russia thing i can't go into what he did but there's always
[25:47.880 --> 25:52.760]  a way out of something you do once you realize that it's not required to go down the road
[25:52.760 --> 25:58.320]  100 in other words let's say it's done what's done is done but god's sake stop beating
[25:58.320 --> 26:05.360]  the war drums there are consequences to it the more things change the more they stay
[26:05.360 --> 26:11.360]  the same a few months ago president elect donald trump told an audience during his victory
[26:11.360 --> 26:18.080]  tour that his administration will not take part in regime changes we will stop looking
[26:18.080 --> 26:25.000]  to topple regimes and overthrow governments folks that was then and this is now after
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.560]  the false flag chemical attack in syria which was blamed on Assad the neocons and the military
[26:31.560 --> 26:37.200]  industrial complex have convinced the new president that its business as usual and
[26:37.200 --> 26:44.080]  the regime changes will commence my attitude for syria and Assad has changed very much
[26:44.080 --> 26:51.080]  well the only difference is this time the american patriots won't be fooled again i'm
[26:51.080 --> 27:01.800]  darin mcbrane and you can learn more right now at info wars dot com for the most part
[27:01.800 --> 27:06.240]  info wars has not commented on the united airlines incident because we think world war three
[27:06.240 --> 27:10.920]  is a bigger issue but here's a take on it everyone involved is a jackass let's start
[27:10.920 --> 27:15.040]  with the airline you couldn't raise the offer for someone to take it was a thousand dollars
[27:15.040 --> 27:19.080]  really too high for you you really had a man physically removed from a flight that wasn't
[27:19.080 --> 27:23.960]  even overbooked to the doctor what the heck is wrong with you how older you what did you
[27:23.960 --> 27:28.160]  think would happen you knew they were removing you from the plane why did you then decide
[27:28.160 --> 27:32.560]  to act like a five-year-old who doesn't want to leave the playground you did this to yourself
[27:32.560 --> 27:36.880]  to the passengers as all of you sit there in horror of what you're seeing and hearing
[27:36.880 --> 27:41.040]  not one of you selfish frauds had the courage to step up and volunteer your seat but you
[27:41.040 --> 27:45.440]  had plenty of courage to videotape it didn't you all in all this man got more attention
[27:45.440 --> 27:49.960]  than severed children in sweden and yemen china moving troops to the north korean border
[27:49.960 --> 27:55.440]  a strange naval flight path off the west coast or the alleged patient he so desperately had
[27:55.440 --> 28:24.440]  to save for info wars dot com this is owens shroyer russian president vladimir putin says the syria chemical attack was a false flag and more are on the way we have information from various sources that a similar provocation and i can't call it anything other than a provocation is being prepared in other parts of syria including the southern suburbs of Damascus where they're again prepared
[28:24.440 --> 28:54.240]  to lease some similar chemical substances and accuse the syrian authorities of using them putin went on to compare the situation in syria to saddam hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction which may indicate that he believes the u.s. is either behind the false flag or actively pushing the propaganda meanwhile the russian government says syrian forces possess no chemical weapons and any further attacks in syria by the
[28:54.240 --> 29:18.240]  united states will be unacceptable and you can learn more right now at info wars dot com not a group you develop living defense for us it took you over a year to do it why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most i mean i try to make sure that i don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but right now we're dealing with massive

[34:57.240 --> 35:12.240]  i think alex is great to be able to show you right i haven't been on for about a year a lot has been going on and in this past few weeks first of all you won the very important award in mexico just came back there from mexico congratulations
[35:12.240 --> 35:30.240]  first of all nato montanegro is something i want to discuss urgent issue that americans need to understand the treacherous and the treasonous attempt by the united states and the world presidency back when the white house back we can discuss that as well
[35:30.240 --> 35:44.240]  i think i've no time in america's prior history alex has anything so openly subversive and treacherously treasonous ever been perpetuated on the united states of america before i think the closest being the you know the covert conspiracy single handedly
[35:44.240 --> 36:01.240]  swore it by america's military hero general smithley butler in 1934 on a band of elitist bankers traders attempted a coup d'etat against the fdr administration we know the game the all too familiar dividing conquer strategies once again the globalist go to modus operandi
[36:01.240 --> 36:17.240]  we're seeing it right now in st. petersburg we're seeing it in the united states we're seeing it in europe we're seeing in latin america we're seeing it all over the world and again this is being implemented through the multi prong assaults waging an open insurrection war against the
[36:17.240 --> 36:27.240]  dollar trump administration in america in order to successfully execute a coup d'etat committed by traders to take down america as the latest banana republic
[36:27.240 --> 36:38.240]  daniel you don't like labels but i mean you've been so on target over the years in your books i've read both novels with classified stuff in both non novels makes my head spin i just respect you more as the years go on
[36:38.240 --> 36:45.240]  you're one of those maybe ten people i know that have been so on target it's actually scary people think i'm on target it's my guests that are on target
[36:45.240 --> 36:58.240]  but looking at globalism i would call you a classical liberal you didn't like bush you don't like all this stuff you're very liberal policies i agree with a lot of those as well you're a real liberal we see you know Nigel Farage i'd call a real liberal for
[36:58.240 --> 37:09.240]  trump it's not that trumps perfect is it clearly the power structures against him they hate him and then you lay out st. petersburg you know what's happening they were their agenda so where should we start you have the real liberals
[37:09.240 --> 37:20.240]  and then nationalists of every race color creed they've got republican establishment democratic establishment elites european elites all wanting this global system trying to prop it up
[37:20.240 --> 37:28.240]  and then just we're allied with radical islam we're not against islam but just radical islam who are the players where are we right now
[37:28.240 --> 37:40.240]  well alex the ruling elites long time agenda has been to destroy the united states in the west from within and in reaction to last year's growing anti-globalist movement represented by the brexit vote and also anti-establishment trump election
[37:40.240 --> 37:55.240]  the elite is becoming desperately aggressive right now fighting for absolute domination and population control in seriously wiping up you know unstable domestic conditions throughout the western world engineer to explode you know with racial class
[37:55.240 --> 38:10.240]  religious and also politically charged civil war violence in both america and europe which is seen in the united states we have seen in europe in spain nidalee in france in england in germany in other countries as well in in portugal and also in
[38:10.240 --> 38:25.240]  greece in the united states this takes the form of mass deployment of a robotically dumbed down highly manipulated yet well organized political left and again we've seen this you know with the flake movements in the united states right after Trump election now constituting
[38:25.240 --> 38:42.240]  the elites weapons of mass destruction against trumps reactionary or militarized authoritarian federal forces soon spilling blood and chaos as america's very own spring uprising the coming riots are aimed at causing the violent breakdown of civil society in
[38:42.240 --> 38:55.240]  both america and europe of course whole time with the ongoing let me just back you're spewing so much knowledge here clearly they're trying to foment race for all this crap you mentioned that they're trying to foment war they admit they're trying to foment war so
[38:55.240 --> 39:13.240]  so let's dial back and talk about that some specifically because this is unprecedented the cog mainstream paper saying overthrow trump calling for civil war and they're saying implode the economy to hurt nationalism as if the public doesn't get you're going to hurt our economy to get i mean
[39:13.240 --> 39:26.240]  forget trump they're openly saying make us poor allows there is a new norm in america that is one of chaos race wars and also mass shootings that are supposedly you know real of course you can provide a mountain of evidence to debunk the
[39:26.240 --> 39:41.240]  individual mainstream media narrative police announcements or whatever intelligence sources you know are saying and of course this new norm is you know is even being contributed to by many alternative media sources the interest of being correct no and authentic about what they're
[39:41.240 --> 39:56.240]  saying i think for the first time in modern american history we have a generation that doesn't know what order calmness and peace look like they have no idea what it's like not to be at war or even to be in a war that has realistic scenarios for the possible ending date
[39:56.240 --> 40:12.240]  and now with the ruling elite moving as fast as ever to get the new world order done we're seeing a brand new level of chaos and fear slowly becoming the new norm that particularly the millennials are being led to believe is inevitable and the new unavoidable reality
[40:12.240 --> 40:23.240]  so i think that's what's happening i agree john mccain said the new world order is collapsing in crisis all the elites are saying it that i think it's premature to say that but they're finally hitting the alarm bell why are they saying that
[40:23.240 --> 40:40.240]  you know it's the chaos once almost exclusively limited to the middle east that we become so accustomed to watching on television is slowly but surely carrying over to the united states and also to rush as we saw today once slide up gladio be operation staged event at a time
[40:40.240 --> 40:57.240]  and no longer is chaos something happening thousands of miles away it's happening right here america is happening in russia in my hometown and notice you know i keep saying chaos because unlike operation gladio which occurred throughout europe mostly from the 1960s to the early 1980s 1990s sorry
[40:57.240 --> 41:05.240]  the current so-called operation gladio be which again you know we can call northward setting purely stage they bring in people that will do it
[41:05.240 --> 41:20.240]  much more sophisticated you have gladio be unlike gladio is being conducted in an era of mass psychological terror and deception made possible by technology legalized propaganda fake chair groups like ecys amazing van daniel he moves so quickly it's all so on target while getting
[41:20.240 --> 41:34.240]  my brain burning here let me ask this for you to break why do they hate russia so much i mean russia i'm not i know you're a russia expert i've never been there i just study it they're not expanding they're trying to build their country they have good policies for their people why are the elite
[41:34.240 --> 41:48.240]  they're so out to get russia i just it's crazy because you can't have one world government you were ordered one world company limited unless you can destroy the only nuclear powered china has nuclear weapons but china is a military is an
[41:48.240 --> 41:59.240]  economic superpower russia is the only alternative to the military superpower that is the united states so again until you can destroy russia you will not have your one world whatever you want to call it
[41:59.240 --> 42:11.240]  if the program destroying russia is failing the russians always dig in so where does that go they just keep doing it and trying to destroy it anyway possible and again chaos or order out of case and this is what we're seeing right now
[42:11.240 --> 42:21.240]  keep in mind alex that the people behind the economic policies in russia along the same liberal crowd pulled there by the bill clinton presidency 20 years ago in other words
[42:21.240 --> 42:31.240]  clinton may be a great leader and a great politician and a great strategist but his hands are tied because again put as the president controls foreign policy the prime minister medvedev
[42:31.240 --> 42:40.240]  that's right he's completely surrounded like trump while he's a liberal stooge trader who works for the interest of the western governing elite with all the bankers who represent
[42:40.240 --> 42:54.240]  so putin and trump are both surrounded they like putin suggest they meet with me don't let them intimidate you they need to come together laugh at the whole system and do they need to have a huge you'll have all the ratings they need to like have a two hour talk on tv let's talk about that right now we need to get putin
[42:54.240 --> 43:06.240]  and trump together right now to just absolutely lay out what's happening daniel usland's our guest stay with us you've heard of vigilante justice right well now we have islamic sharia vigilantes from the star tribune many
[43:06.240 --> 43:21.240]  apollos muslims protest sharia vigilante in cedar riverside area that's right 22 year old abdulla rashid is trying to enforce what he calls the civil part of sharia law in his area he's been telling people in the cedar riverside some molly dominated neighborhood

[47:10.240 --> 47:16.240]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting
[47:16.240 --> 47:19.240]  worldwide it's Alex Jones
[47:27.240 --> 47:38.240]  I know the globalists want to cut off the resources to dictate humanity surrender to their technotronic system and the communist Chinese god bless them are enslaving their own people they're totally on board with the
[47:38.240 --> 47:56.240]  globalist it's kind of some infighting and jockeying going on but Russia hasn't you know almost what I was saying six times three times the size of the US five or six times bigger than China most of it's unpopulated and the globalists should say we want that we want that now
[47:56.240 --> 48:09.240]  it's like they've taken Africa exploited it Latin America you name it you know most of the Amazon basins unpopulated as well they want people wiped out of there we live in big cities as we're all together and they go the world's overpopulated go drive an hour there's there's nothing out there
[48:09.240 --> 48:23.240]  but you're on roads that go into the other towns so it creates the perception there's always people know people means commerce it means jobs that's why like a fish reef you know there might not be another reef for 200 miles in the ocean but this reef's all these
[48:23.240 --> 48:39.240]  fish are so many fish here what's going on that's because there's life there there's an economy alright Daniel us to one we were getting into Montenegro the Senate passed it only two people voted against it sessions obviously is a vacant seat so he wasn't there but we're
[48:39.240 --> 48:55.240]  in all this and they're trying to start a war there now Trump can veto it or NATO could veto it but regardless they want to start a war what do you think the global order is going to do because last time we had you on a year ago you said well there
[48:55.240 --> 49:10.240]  have been some problems but they're not in crisis yet sounds like you're saying they're panicked they're in crisis they're getting it seems like they're like Junkers saying we'll start a war with Europe will will march an EU army in will economically destroy the UK they're
[49:10.240 --> 49:23.240]  threatening us with breaking America up it seems like this doesn't look like what winners do but you're the expert so the next 13 minutes you've got the floor before you got to go give us your presentation again Daniel us to one the best selling
[49:23.240 --> 49:33.240]  author of the club Bilderberg and so many books you can follow him obviously at Twitter and we'll put that up on screen for TV viewers but Daniel again what what other knowledge you want to impart to folks
[49:33.240 --> 49:47.240]  well I think it's important to understand why these people want to start a war worlds financial system Alex can survive until about the end of 2017 the total collapse the system that we know today will come no longer than January
[49:47.240 --> 50:03.240]  February 2018 every financial instrument and mechanism available was used up to avoid the 2008 near collapse so there's no more money in the current system the International Monetary Fund and also the United States policy to stimulate the outflow of capital from developing
[50:03.240 --> 50:18.240]  countries which includes obviously China and Russia that's buying time for themselves have taken out over 200 billion dollars from Russia manipulating the currency devaluing the robots you know through the central bank and of course the director of the central bank was
[50:18.240 --> 50:33.240]  pulled there by Clinton's allies in the United States and these are the same people have also caused the outflow of over one trillion dollars from China and doing the same thing with the joint in addition they also took out between two and three trillion dollars
[50:33.240 --> 50:48.240]  which will literally stolen from the offshore accounts of the British elite via Panama paper scandal bringing to light the money hidden by the aristocracy mainly English aristocracy this in fact was the beginning of Brexit now Trump has two options available to him
[50:48.240 --> 51:03.240]  you either save the United States economy and sing the economies of the rest of the world because again you don't have enough money in the system to do everything or you save the world at the expense of the United States and according to Trump there will be no more dollars for international investments
[51:03.240 --> 51:19.240]  only investment available to save the American economy thus in his first speech explicitly talked about the need to invest in US infrastructure something that you and I talked about over a year ago before Trump's election before the primaries we said the need for progress and
[51:19.240 --> 51:32.240]  development of society as goes through infrastructure and space exploration because when we build infrastructure Alex we're actually reorganizing the physical space time of the planet allowing our world to attain
[51:32.240 --> 51:45.240]  any fiat crap and actually building something and making it about human activity that's one way of putting so you know if your system is increasingly moving to higher levels of efficiency such as you know from coal based economy to an oil based economy to a
[51:45.240 --> 51:59.240]  nuclear based economy they'll be an increase in the productive power of human labor at every step of the way and that's the way the actual wealth is created money is simply the way of but as you know the globalist admit they want to post industrial world squeezing off resources
[51:59.240 --> 52:12.240]  so that's really Trump's great sin is he wants cheaper energy and innovation and a world based on humans and that goes through actually probably one of the greatest speeches ever made by United States politician in this case Donald Trump made one of the
[52:12.240 --> 52:28.240]  greatest speeches ever when he talked about the need for space exploration and again money has no no no intrinsic value possesses no magical powers only exploration and trailblazing exactly yes sir well Alex exactly you know we are the gates of a
[52:28.240 --> 52:38.240]  worldwide economic default and dismantling of the capitalist system and the only difference again going back to Hillary Clinton as a Clinton would have pushed us into World War which would probably have meant the end of mankind is
[52:38.240 --> 52:49.240]  that was the old answer to collapse we can't do that now exactly you know at the global level those who supported Clinton are also inside the European Central Bank International Monetary Fund Council of Europe European Parliament
[52:49.240 --> 53:03.240]  endless US think tanks liberal lobby groups and in Russia these people are represented by the United Russia that's President Putin's party and Prime Minister of course Putin has very little to do with United Russia in a sense that his policies are
[53:03.240 --> 53:17.240]  progress and development to say his own party's the enemy from Russian history that it took President Putin to presidencies to actually get control of all the circles of power within the Russian government and of course the United States is seeing the same thing
[53:17.240 --> 53:28.240]  and these people they will do everything possible to recover the power they lost making use of wide range of hybrid irregular methodologies from mega terror deep state people ignoring well that well that's why you've been freezing
[53:28.240 --> 53:41.240]  a car a Bilderberg guy says Trump's most powerful I mean the most powerful leader in the world not that Russia even that powerful now economically you know economically it's like Italy it's because he actually is in power which we're not pushing
[53:41.240 --> 53:50.240]  leadership but instead of globalist manipulation it's a guy for Russia in charge and that's why he's so hard to deal with because finally a country's actually in charge of itself
[53:50.240 --> 54:01.240]  well look what they're doing all over the world in Western Europe assassination assassination of politicians Russian ambassador hundreds of top Russians killed 30 or 40 very very top what do you make of that
[54:01.240 --> 54:13.240]  part of the part you know part possible what we're talking about civil society breakdown civil disobedience United based or Europe Russians thus far has been able to avoid that you know to using refugees as a weapon of destabilization and terrorism
[54:13.240 --> 54:28.240]  of course look at the refugee crisis in Europe 60 million displaced of which 5 million are from Syria alone and you said an end game in 2007 10 years ago they would use refugees as weapons gunner yet sources inside they've been playing this forever
[54:28.240 --> 54:42.240]  well Bilderberg has been planning the things you know they planned generations ahead and in Germany today more than 200 cities have shelters for refugees many of them living in slums in the ghettos segregated from the rest of the population the tensions are palpable and there's
[54:42.240 --> 54:53.240]  only a matter of time Alex before an explosion and social break down occurs in Germany in Italy in Holland that's how you started what are they planning to do after the social breakdown happens that the media is hyping
[54:53.240 --> 55:06.240]  Trump versus Clinton was the fight between the representatives of the two of the world's super national power structures the Rothschilds behind Trump against the Rockefellers behind the Clinton that said none of the Rockefeller family not the Rothschild family
[55:06.240 --> 55:18.240]  represent true power above them you know about the Rockefellers and Rothschilds we have the asters the lodges the Fleming's the Grosvenor's the Madison's the Keswick's whose fortunes are measured and counted in trillions of dollars
[55:18.240 --> 55:34.240]  Trump represents a change in the paradigm of society as we have never seen in the history of humanity not a new world order but rather a new world struggling to be born unsure what you're saying Rothschilds are backing Trump versus the eugenics based
[55:34.240 --> 55:45.240]  Rockefellers exactly if again if you kind of look at the people I see a sources three years ago they said oh you're bashing the Rothschilds watch what they're about to do they're gonna try to actually give wealth back to the people not because they're
[55:45.240 --> 55:59.240]  bashing good they don't want a total world by bloodbath just at this time their interests coincide with our interest because again behind Clinton you have the Rockefellers the transnational bankers which is the world company limited the globalist non American you
[55:59.240 --> 56:19.240]  know or American power lead circles the people are backing a dollar Trump are the non American finance CS circles centered in the city of London Hong Kong World Center for money laundering drugs intelligence and British control left over lead circles of the British Empire the Rothschilds European elite represented by the old European aristocracy
[56:19.240 --> 56:35.240]  such as the house of Sage Coburg Austro-Hungarian aristocracy and also Ottoman ability as well as the Venetian black mobility and then on a small scale you have the intelligence agencies so on and so forth but again these are big groups of people very powerful individuals historically
[56:35.240 --> 56:49.240]  was it fair to say most U.S. intelligence when I research is for Trump most U.S. intelligence except for the DEA NSA and the CIA. All right well it's a crazy time to be alive Daniel we got 50 seconds left what else you want to add.
[56:49.240 --> 57:00.240]  I think again be vigilant be intelligent don't follow propaganda techniques analyze and also ask the right questions why is this being done who's gonna win and who's gonna benefit when all is said and done.
[57:00.240 --> 57:05.240]  All right and again on Twitter what's the best place for people to get in touch with you.
[57:05.240 --> 57:15.240]  At Estwell and Daniel that's my Twitter account and again Alex congratulations on a very important international very prestigious journalistic award in Mexico I also want an award for my documentary film.

[59:12.240 --> 59:16.240]  The animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about is the paramount vehicle.
[59:16.240 --> 59:21.240]  This whole world is a test and this experiment that we're all part of is key.
[59:21.240 --> 59:31.240]  You're conscious and alive and you care and the fact that you're even involved and are even searching for the truth shows you're conscious and haven't been pulled under by these dark forces that now dominate our world.

[1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:34.240]  I don't sit here at some potentate who set himself up as the high priest who claims he has all the answers.
[1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:52.240]  I am a lowly person who has seen the face of God and who wishes to see others break free from the globalist control so that they can lead us with God's spirit out of this great time of evil.
[1:00:52.240 --> 1:01:06.240]  Last hour they put together a powerful rebroadcast with Michael Savage in a lesson we've got Chris Peranto one of the greatest heroes the modern age a true archetype of manliness and commitment and Christian joining us.
[1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:09.240]  And we have Michael Savage again from an earlier interview we did.

[1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:22.240]  But I don't sit here before millions of you.
[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:23.240]  I don't just say this to sound humble.
[1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:30.240]  It's essentially understand that I know much of what I do is a wrecked failure of what my spirit wants to manifest.
[1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:56.240]  But it is in that willing in that attempt to oppose the tyrants of the old age that by increment we together can dream and as builders then manifest not through magic but through real work a better world.
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:06.240]  And I will assure you when we have transcended this level of crisis when humanity is finally together in will.
[1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:18.240]  Not collectivized not enslaved still individual but so humbled by the great spectrum of understanding that we finally come together when we emerge into the next level of consciousness.
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:25.240]  It's going to be a full on war at that level we can't even imagine and we're going to emerge saying why weren't we already ready for this.
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:29.240]  We had no idea what we were even entering because the world is all about competition.
[1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:31.240]  The universe is all about competition.
[1:02:31.240 --> 1:02:41.240]  The dimensions are all about competition and greediness and selfishness in the universe is a powerful force.
[1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:48.240]  And humanity on this plane of existence despite the fact we come from the great spark of God.
[1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:51.240]  You can't just have the spark of God and be given power.
[1:02:51.240 --> 1:03:00.240]  You have to prove yourself so as we go up through these levels of dysfunction and corruption and evil.
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:07.240]  We have to realize that as we ascend higher and higher the challenges are going to become greater and greater and greater.
[1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:16.240]  When you start getting up even within a trillion light years of God's consciousness you realize oh my God we could destroy all the evil in the universe now below us.
[1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:30.240]  But that would in free will and in the test for God's consciousness that swims down deep and then comes back up as God purifies himself over and over again in the great test.
[1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:37.240]  This isn't out of books. This isn't out of anything you'll ever read. This is out of my soul. You can deny this if you want. I know it's true.
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:47.240]  It's not my truth. It is the truth. And all of us are God experiencing consciousness.
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:56.240]  But Christ's perfect Son truly embodied to be tested to make us better.
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:04.240]  Whether you believe the story of Christ which has been proven by Roman historians or don't, the archetype resonates true to all.
[1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:12.240]  Someone so powerful when the devil comes and says I'll give you the whole world Christ had to weaken himself 30 plus days.
[1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:19.240]  What was it out in the desert? No food. No one could live just to even lower himself level to be tempted.
[1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:33.240]  That's an archetype of not just what he did in the desert but God lowering himself all the way down from total consciousness able to create the entire universe we know all the way down in humbleness to experience that with us.
[1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:44.240]  And to be tested.
[1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:53.240]  It's truth. And stare into the universe and see the firmament at night. It's the sign of God's handiwork.
[1:04:53.240 --> 1:04:57.240]  I hope we're able to broadcast this on a Sunday. I think we will.
[1:04:57.240 --> 1:05:04.240]  All right, retransmission straight ahead.
[1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:37.240]  Systematic enzymes.

[1:06:13.240 --> 1:06:29.240]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:06:29.240 --> 1:06:38.240]  Well, the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes has come out and said, I've seen all the proof from all the different agencies. Of course, the president was under surveillance.
[1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:47.240]  Just as he said, they were unlawfully using foreign intelligence gathered on phone calls he was using as staff was using in the transition team as they're supposed to do.
[1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:56.240]  To politically spy on him and then claim they had evidence that he was this Russian agent, but there was no evidence there. So Trump demanded it come out and pointed out it was illegal to leak it.
[1:06:56.240 --> 1:07:04.240]  And they said, we never spied on you thinking we have no memory. They're betting everything on that, just like river said with Obamacare.
[1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:12.240]  And now we've got two days ago on the one year anniversary of the Brussels-Belgium attack. We've got a bunch of people getting run over and killed and stabbed to death.
[1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:26.240]  And members of parliament saying, don't say it's Islamic. It's just crazy. And now we've got 3 million more Islamists, quote, refugees, the U.N. is trying to force Europe to bring in.
[1:07:26.240 --> 1:07:35.240]  They want hundreds of thousands more to be brought in here. We just played the Democratic Party with the Syrian refugees coming in, giving them voter registration cards.
[1:07:35.240 --> 1:07:41.240]  There's so much to talk about. The point is there's a lot of special hunters think this country belongs to them. They've overrun it. They've taken control of it.
[1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:49.240]  But the good news is the sleeping giant that is America of every race, color and creed, we're all Americans. We bleed red blood. We're one race on this planet.
[1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:59.240]  We're waking up to it and it's a beautiful thing. Michael Moore came out again yesterday and said we need a civil emergency and to overthrow President Trump.
[1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:10.240]  You see it all over the news, killing, have martial law, Rosie O'Donnell. You have the former deputy head of the Defense Department in the news, going to the Pentagon, trying to shop the idea of the military overthrowing the president.
[1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:19.240]  That's so illegal, folks, that it makes my head spin. And it's a bunch of foreign interest and the Communist Chinese coming in to help censor Facebook. You cannot make this up.
[1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:33.240]  So I just talked to some military guys, I know. We happen to know Chris Tonto Peronto, of course, one of the big heroes and survivors of what happened in Benghazi, and of course, Lion Eyes properly so in the new film, 13 Hours and Stuff, Big Hit and So Amazing,
[1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:42.240]  to ask, what do you think we should do? Well, say we support the president and talk about if they're calling for military operations against the president, we're not calling for anything offensive.
[1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:53.240]  But we should start a discussion about the left thinking and Soros doubling the amount of money to these groups to kill cops and burn down cities. They're planning something so, so Chris, we're going to skip this break so you have more time.
[1:08:53.240 --> 1:09:03.240]  Thank you for joining us and coming on. Obviously, everything you've done, ChrisTontoPeronto.com. I've kind of set the table the last four minutes. Where are we going with this?
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:13.240]  I honestly, I think right now it's just a lot of live talk. It'd be really ridiculous at this point for them to start to start. There's some civil war going on.
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:26.240]  I mean, you've got guys like myself, you've got plenty of contractors out there that are back home. Now, plenty of person, people like myself that are patriots that are going to stand aside and let some coup, if you want to call it that, take over.
[1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:36.240]  And also, just to strengthen numbers, I'll give you a take. Libs, you want to come out? You better be 100 of you against one of me because that's what it's going to take. And there are a lot of me's out there.
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:46.240]  So I don't think it's realistic. I think, again, it's a lot of threats and the Libs do that. There are a lot of talk when an action comes and it comes actually picking up a gun and doing something.
[1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:53.240]  I think if they were more inclined to protect this country, you'd probably see more of them joining the military, joining the law enforcement.
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:10:06.240]  And again, so I say there's a lot of BS, a lot of just tough talk at this point in time. But if it comes to this, not going to be tough talk, believe me, people like myself will stand up and we'll be coming right back at you.
[1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:16.240]  So I just warn them, don't. Just stop that BS and put a quirk in it right now before it really ends up getting to something that they really don't want to get into.
[1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:30.240]  Well, Chris, that's exactly why, as this rhetoric heated up, I wanted to get you on because you're somebody with just a few other guys, or some of them died, unfortunately, took on hundreds and hundreds of people and two different major battle scenes under 13 hours of admitted stand down.
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:38.240]  You just have the physical courage and one of the most amazing Alamos where some people actually made it out or a 300 where a few people actually made it.
[1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:52.240]  It's beyond that. You actually survived at a 300 type scenario, but where it was just six against 300 or 500. But looking at this, that's why I wanted to get you to talk about this as an expert on it because they seem confident.
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:11:01.240]  And I agree it's a lot of talk, but they're really trying to organize it. And I understand Trump's resistance to standing up to this because it'll make him look like a fascist.
[1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:09.240]  But when they're openly calling for his death everywhere, and my death and everybody else, and it's just horrible at a certain point, it becomes dereliction of duty.
[1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:24.240]  If somebody doesn't get indicted, if somebody doesn't get in trouble, you know, when when Bow Wow, you know, says I want to kidnap and rape and enslave the first lady, or when, you know, his his uncle comes out, Snoop Dogg and says, I want to kill Trump, put some music video out.
[1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:30.240]  We know he's a coward won't do it, but he's trying to activate other mentally ill people. So that's why I'm so concerned.
[1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:38.240]  That's true. And you have a good point there. And in the past, if you did that, then the Secret Service be knocking at your door and possibly you'd be going to prison.
[1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:48.240]  I think that needs to happen. I think it needs to return. There needs to there does need to be an example set, whether it be Snoop Dogg or somebody else out there where you're going to say you're going to kill the president.
[1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:57.240]  That's a threat. That is a terrorist threat at this point. And the Secret Service, FBI, local law enforcement, somebody needs to be knocking on the doors and pulling these guys in handcuffs.
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:12:06.240]  And honestly, if it is a star, and I hate to use the word Hollywood star, but if that's what you want to call yourselves as stars, you know, TMZ needs to be there to to make an example out of you.
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:15.240]  An example needs to be made. And I don't have a problem of Trump decided to do that. And he shouldn't be called the fastest. That's the one you don't threaten to kill the president of the United States.
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:26.240]  You don't do that. In the past, you've never done it. If you do do it, there are repercussions to it. And I think he does at this point in time, or somebody within the just session, somebody within the DOJ needs to take this apart.
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:34.240]  Needs to take this upon themselves and go ahead and do the right thing and arrest somebody, make an example out of somebody and make it a public example.
[1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:42.240]  And, you know, we'll see what happens. But you can't keep letting it go. You're correct. You've got to lance that blister eventually. If not, it's going to get infected. You've got to do it.
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:48.240]  And if you don't, it's just going to get worse and worse and worse. So I do agree. I do agree at this point with the threats to the president.
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:57.240]  But again, do I think that they're going to come out and actually start an all out war, a civil war in the United States of America? They'd be well-earned to not do that.
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:13:10.240]  I mean, I totally agree with what you're saying about the battle space. We have the right. We're Americans. 99% of the patriots are, you know, obviously with the president, he's executing like no president has seen on his promises.
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:16.240]  It's almost unbelievable. It's so good. And so it would be one thing if he was like selling us out the farm powers or something. And that brings us to the next point.
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:24.240]  What do you make of now? Noona's coming on saying, no, they were surveilling him basically illegally. The surveillance was legal because it was overseas, but they were using it domestically.
[1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:35.240]  The Democratic Party during the transition. And then this claim that he's a Russian agent securing our borders, building up our military, turning our coal back on that actually decimates the Russian gas exports.
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:37.240]  I mean, really, if you look at what Trump's doing, he's dominating.
[1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:47.240]  I love how you said that. He's doing exactly what he said. There's no president I think that's come in the last, I know in the last eight years for sure, but the last 12, 16 years.
[1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:52.240]  Reagan was great, but he didn't deliver like, he took him three years to deliver a recovery. Trump's done it 50 days.
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:59.240]  Yes, he's been outstanding. And I have respect for that. Whether I agree with the policies or not, he's doing what he said he was going to do. And that's fantastic.
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:08.240]  As far as Nunez, I know Congressman Nunez. Congressman Nunez is actually a friend. Congressman Nunez has always said what he meant.
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:11.240]  He's always been honest with everything that he's had to do with myself.
[1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:16.240]  He just comes off as very, a lot of courage, very honorable. He's the only guy to admit the truth when they all know the truth.
[1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:21.240]  And so if he's saying it, I'll give it 99.9% that that thing is going on.
[1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:29.240]  And as far as then doing it legally and then doing what it is, they're doing something illegally, but pulling illegal things off of it, that's typical CIA at the moment.
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:38.240]  Pompeo needs to clean house there. They need to come in and see what was actually going on. There needs to be heads to roll at the agency because what they were doing, they were getting information about Trump.
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:49.240]  And it was, in my opinion, that's illegal. You don't do that. Whether it's with a, you're doing an illegal act, a legal action going to foreign powers, but you're masking an illegal action by doing that.
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:53.240]  Well, that's illegal, isn't it? It's still illegal.
[1:14:53.240 --> 1:15:10.240]  So my opinion is, again, Pompeo needs to get in there and take care of the agency and find out what was going on and see if there is actual basis to get somebody arrested, get some charges against somebody within the intelligence community.
[1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:18.240]  And Congressman Nunez, I think, will pursue that. I really do. He's a pit bull and he will continue to pursue until he's run out of options.
[1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:24.240]  He did that with us as best he could when he was under Mike Rogers on that House Until Subcommittee, and I thought he did a fantastic job.
[1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:25.240]  Now he's the head of the committee.
[1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:30.240]  Exactly. So if that says anything about how honest this man is and his integrity.
[1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:36.240]  So I leave it in Congressman Nunez's hands. He's a subject matter expert when it comes to this, and I think he can continue to pursue it.
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:44.240]  And he will come to a good resolution if people within the Trump administration's sessions and others will back him.
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:50.240]  He has a good attorney general that can help them out, where in our case, we didn't have a good attorney general twice.
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:54.240]  We did Eric Holder and then Loretta Lynch, of course, weren't going to back us at all.
[1:15:54.240 --> 1:16:00.240]  But I think he has the opportunity here to come in and set an example.
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:05.240]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Florida Eye Tooth Face is now back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:13.240]  Research across the board is clear. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:20.240]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.

[1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:14.240]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.

[1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:24.240]  But Biotrusillinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:27.240]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:34.240]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production in eyesight, Biotrusillinium is also the perfect supercharger.

[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:21.240]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:25.240]  It helps balance the thyroid gland. It helps detoxify.
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:28.240]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[1:18:28.240 --> 1:18:33.240]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:39.240]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:45.240]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[1:18:45.240 --> 1:18:49.240]  I'm taking it now every day. This is Shoki Biotrusillinium.
[1:18:49.240 --> 1:18:52.240]  It is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
