[00:44.880 --> 00:52.560]  building in Oklahoma City yesterday for the last time she says Jane Graham was
[00:52.560 --> 00:56.760]  one of the heads of HUD and the head of the local union there in Oklahoma City
[00:56.760 --> 01:06.840]  she came on the radio and on the nightly news yesterday and broke down the
[01:06.840 --> 01:11.400]  witnesses the police that were threatened the police that were killed
[01:11.400 --> 01:16.200]  because they saw the feds in there planting the bombs and then being
[01:16.200 --> 01:22.720]  there when the bombs went off amazing information and coming up in the second
[01:22.720 --> 01:26.960]  hour because it is the anniversary of this devastating attack that was used
[01:26.960 --> 01:31.520]  to demonize the state's rights movement the militia libertarians and true
[01:31.520 --> 01:36.960]  conservatives constitutionalist Ron Paul myself I've been demonized with it

[09:06.640 --> 09:10.400]  documentary film that we have available by the way at info wars.com
[09:10.400 --> 09:15.800]  discounted that is the only modern professional film with all the data
[09:15.800 --> 09:24.680]  proving that Oklahoma City was a fast and furious operation a false flag to
[09:24.680 --> 09:29.600]  blame conservatives and libertarians for terrorism and to demonize the state's
[09:29.600 --> 09:35.000]  rights movement that was gaining steam just as it is today and you have all the
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.800]  Democratic strategist memos that have even been in the financial times of
[09:37.800 --> 09:41.720]  London and the Associated Press in the last two years where they say to
[09:41.720 --> 09:46.960]  Obama an Oklahoma City is the only thing that will save you we need a terror
[09:46.960 --> 09:53.360]  attack that domestic groups carry out so you can shut down your detractors they
[09:53.360 --> 09:59.920]  come within one micron of saying stage it they're like one is coming it's going
[09:59.920 --> 10:05.600]  to help when it happens you've got to seize it don't let a good crisis go to
[10:05.600 --> 10:10.240]  waste I mean they they come so close to it so close even when back and then
[10:10.240 --> 10:15.680]  announced a week later he was having to leave Fox over it came out and said the
[10:15.680 --> 10:19.960]  White House was preparing the stage a new Oklahoma City to be blamed on
[10:19.960 --> 10:25.280]  libertarians and conservatives so that is coming up and I interviewed Jane
[10:25.280 --> 10:29.160]  Graham who was one of the heads of HUD in the building that day on the seventh
[10:29.160 --> 10:33.200]  floor when it blew up and she had witnessed the feds planting the bomb
[10:33.200 --> 10:36.760]  she thought they were she'd know what the great sticks of butter were in the
[10:36.760 --> 10:43.840]  days before she'd heard the FBI people in the coffee room in the lounge saying
[10:43.840 --> 10:46.680]  yeah they're gonna bomb a federal building in the next two weeks she
[10:46.680 --> 10:52.640]  called friends about it this is amazing and she's talked to police officers who
[10:52.640 --> 10:56.800]  were threatened with murder if they spoke out some were then killed like
[10:56.800 --> 11:00.800]  Terrence Yeke cop of the year I've interviewed Don Browning head of the
[11:00.800 --> 11:04.880]  K-9 unit who was there minutes after he saw the feds and what they were doing
[11:04.880 --> 11:08.400]  they told him you and your wife are dead if you speak out he still didn't shut
[11:08.400 --> 11:13.160]  up the police chief told other police and she's documented this yeah you better
[11:13.160 --> 11:19.760]  shut up so see you see all these parades for dead cops and stuff that's the
[11:19.760 --> 11:25.960]  system is trying to look good off dead cops dead heroes at the end of the day
[11:25.960 --> 11:31.040]  the end of the day when they were killing cops and killing witnesses the other
[11:31.040 --> 11:37.120]  cops said shut up in pure cowardice to the other police officers and stood down
[11:37.120 --> 11:42.120]  as they were tortured and killed so this lady risk her life coming on this
[11:42.120 --> 11:46.400]  broadcast and she's she's done interviews over the years and she just says
[11:46.400 --> 11:50.280]  she's told her story this is yet and she's got ill family and people she's
[11:50.280 --> 11:55.240]  taking care of she's done Hoppy Heidelberg of course it was on a few
[11:55.240 --> 12:00.080]  months ago he's fighting cancer he said that may be his last interview he was
[12:00.080 --> 12:04.280]  one of the grand jurors at the FBI come to his house threatened to kill him I
[12:04.280 --> 12:08.880]  mean this is serious it's dangerous for me to even be talking about this I've
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.120]  been threatened over it but we've got to tell the truth here of course you know
[12:13.120 --> 12:17.400]  who the deputy attorney general was he's the attorney general today but 17 years
[12:17.400 --> 12:21.720]  ago he was the deputy attorney general in lawsuits via lawyer Jesse Trenadu and
[12:21.720 --> 12:24.680]  others have gotten the four-year documents because a good federal judge
[12:24.680 --> 12:27.760]  is ordered and released where the feds were running the white supremacist
[12:27.760 --> 12:33.280]  compound with the southern poverty law center that McVeigh was at confirming
[12:33.280 --> 12:37.400]  Terry Nichols affidavit that McVeigh was really a deep cover national security
[12:37.400 --> 12:43.400]  asset who believed he was about to stop and bust the bombing in the process or
[12:43.400 --> 12:46.480]  that they were gonna let it go forward but then blame groups but then when
[12:46.480 --> 12:50.120]  McVeigh was told that they were gonna blow up a daycare center and let it go
[12:50.120 --> 12:56.520]  forward he flipped out so they I guess picked him to burn him as a patsy so
[12:56.520 --> 13:03.160]  we're gonna be discussing that coming up in the second hour today we probably
[13:03.160 --> 13:08.040]  should get Don Browning back on to head of the canine unit Sergeant Browning he
[13:08.040 --> 13:11.320]  balked though and I said say the name of the FBI agents and he you'd see him kind
[13:11.320 --> 13:17.720]  of flush he went and then later started saying some names because it's just hard
[13:17.720 --> 13:26.960]  for people imagine at the Oklahoma City Police Department in the hall and
[13:26.960 --> 13:31.040]  coming into his office repeatedly saying you and your wife are gonna be dead you
[13:31.040 --> 13:38.400]  understand me that's who runs America imagine walking into a sergeant's
[13:38.400 --> 13:45.000]  office at a police department and saying you and your wife are dead and yes
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.880]  Austin FBI I've gotten your message that you're listening and want me to be
[13:48.880 --> 13:55.000]  nice nice like Terrence Yakey and the FBI pulled him over and tortured every
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.080]  inch of his body you mean nice nice like cop of the year getting tortured to
[13:59.080 --> 14:02.480]  death and then shot in the back of the head and the police department all knew
[14:02.480 --> 14:06.640]  he was murdered but told all the cops shut up Jane Graham's a witness to that
[14:06.640 --> 14:11.880]  she could name the police officers that told her that this is who runs America
[14:11.880 --> 14:19.520]  ruthless criminal mafia with badges and you better grow up and admit that we're
[14:19.520 --> 14:25.040]  not in Kansas anymore and I'm not here covering this to be shocking I don't
[14:25.040 --> 14:30.600]  like sticking my head in it in a in a lion's mouth for no reason I've got to
[14:30.600 --> 14:34.440]  do this I've got to go into the lion's den because we don't have any future we
[14:34.440 --> 14:39.640]  don't start saying no to this I told you six years ago Bush was shipping guns in
[14:39.640 --> 14:44.400]  the Mexico to cause that war then it continued under Obama and he shipped
[14:44.400 --> 14:49.120]  even more in and blamed the Second Amendment Congresswoman Giffords we've
[14:49.120 --> 14:53.200]  confirmed was beginning an investigation into it with judge role you know what
[14:53.200 --> 15:00.480]  happened to them and I told you that it would be used to blame the Second
[15:00.480 --> 15:03.840]  Amendment even though they got caught they went ahead and used it against the
[15:03.840 --> 15:06.640]  Second Amendment they've called for assault weapon sales bans and
[15:06.640 --> 15:12.880]  manufacturing bans and CBS even got the memo that indeed they did it to blame
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.840]  the Second Amendment if you'll ship tens of thousands of guns to drug gangs in
[15:17.840 --> 15:22.040]  Mexico to destabilize the country to blame the Second Amendment and thousands
[15:22.040 --> 15:26.440]  have been killed Mexico estimates over 2,000 their side hundreds on our side
[15:26.440 --> 15:33.960]  including three federal and three local law enforcement people at six that's
[15:33.960 --> 15:39.760]  conservative that's a false flag that killed thousands and thousands of
[15:39.760 --> 15:49.960]  people who did it John P. Holdren these people mean business he needs something
[15:49.960 --> 15:55.280]  to brainwash you as he said on C-span he met with the heads of the media this
[15:55.280 --> 15:57.960]  was back when he was deputy attorney general guys queue up the brainwashing
[15:57.960 --> 16:02.160]  police people won't believe with their new listeners and he said we need I work
[16:02.160 --> 16:06.280]  with the media to brainwash the public in the schools and through TV we've got
[16:06.280 --> 16:13.080]  to brainwash he said literally brainwash people they want to win and
[16:13.080 --> 16:18.320]  they'll ship guns into Mexico and narcotics back in to do it they'll blow
[16:18.320 --> 16:24.840]  up federal buildings and pick one with the daycare center to get this power
[16:24.840 --> 16:31.560]  undoubtedly the attorney general today was involved in the cover-up did he run
[16:31.560 --> 16:36.720]  the operation I don't know that we know the ATF was at the very head of it the
[16:36.720 --> 16:39.720]  point is he was involved in the cover-up and hence aiding and abetting and
[16:39.720 --> 16:46.520]  people have been tortured to death to bring you this information tortured to
[16:46.520 --> 16:54.880]  death to bring you this information we say it again tortured to death to bring
[16:54.880 --> 17:03.160]  you this information or you can just give up and say do whatever you want have
[17:03.160 --> 17:07.800]  the TSA on highway checkpoints abusing everybody take everybody's property
[17:07.800 --> 17:13.840]  jack-up taxes bankrupt the country bring in the new world order roll over to it

[24:35.120 --> 24:40.440]  legal analyst on CNN that George Zimmerman had approached about being his
[24:40.440 --> 24:48.560]  lawyer and for such a little thing like that she recuses herself because he
[24:48.560 --> 24:55.960]  hadn't become her lawyer but then meanwhile almost all of the FDA and EPA
[24:55.960 --> 24:59.440]  regulators look it up I mean the head regulator is a former executive of
[24:59.440 --> 25:05.200]  Monsanto and the few that aren't are Archer Daniels Midland or other genetic

[25:59.760 --> 26:04.120]  to find terrorists those guys work for the bankers on record it's meant to

[26:12.840 --> 26:16.320]  free society let's just randomly have people on buses and street corners and
[26:16.320 --> 26:21.680]  corners listening to what people say I mean that's directly out of every
[26:21.680 --> 26:26.800]  nightmare science fiction novel or real places like Cambodia
[26:26.800 --> 26:32.200]  communist China Nazi Germany I mean it's here but that's enough of me let's
[26:32.200 --> 26:37.920]  start going to your phone calls Bob in Michigan welcome hi Alex yep this is
[26:37.920 --> 26:41.520]  Bob from Michigan I appreciate you taking my call and long-time listener
[26:41.520 --> 26:46.160]  very long time I just want to make this really brief because there's really a
[26:46.160 --> 26:52.160]  lot of information here there's as I see it there's probably several things that
[26:52.160 --> 26:58.640]  are being used to control us that's medicine and healing energy certainly
[26:58.640 --> 27:04.120]  and events that are a little bit off the wall like this unfortunate business in
[27:04.120 --> 27:11.360]  in Japan I want to refer just the two basic websites I could talk for hours
[27:11.360 --> 27:17.240]  on this the first one is Tom Bearden and this has nothing to do with harp or
[27:17.240 --> 27:22.840]  anything else that's been talked about this is the real deal it is it's let me
[27:22.840 --> 27:29.960]  spell it for you because it's French actually it's C H E N I E R E dot org
[27:29.960 --> 27:35.160]  pronounced shenny dot org let me just go down real quick on the table of
[27:35.160 --> 27:41.600]  contents here there's been a healing machine that was used and suppressed
[27:41.600 --> 27:47.480]  that's on the table of contents there it explains that I couldn't possibly in
[27:47.480 --> 27:52.720]  five minutes or six minutes or whatever even explain it there's a it's there I'm
[27:52.720 --> 27:56.160]  just telling people that if they want to go look at this because we need more
[27:56.160 --> 28:01.200]  people to get active in looking at the real solutions here there's a lot of
[28:01.200 --> 28:05.480]  people claim they got magic machines that heal people I have sponsor
[28:05.480 --> 28:08.960]  opportunities all the time or they claim this you know wife machines and all
[28:08.960 --> 28:13.040]  this and I know that there's been some research with different wavelengths and
[28:13.040 --> 28:16.360]  things but then that doesn't mean that every person that claims they have a
[28:16.360 --> 28:20.120]  machine you know that it does exactly what they're saying I think in some
[28:20.120 --> 28:23.520]  cases there's some reality to it in other cases some of this stuff is a
[28:23.520 --> 28:28.480]  fraud well that and that's right but this cuts away all the mysterious stuff
[28:28.480 --> 28:34.840]  that's why I'm saying go read it for yourself is that your website pardon me
[28:34.840 --> 28:40.600]  is it your website no no it's dr. Bearden's website okay well listen do me
[28:40.600 --> 28:46.760]  a favor send me a link to that and I will check it out sir what else is you

[29:16.560 --> 29:21.280]  monstrous well it would have been done earlier only the technology was not off
[29:21.280 --> 29:28.440]  the shelf in any number of the situations in history so the the actions
[29:28.440 --> 29:32.840]  aren't really that surprising it's that they're using a lot of this advanced
[29:32.840 --> 29:39.680]  technology and like I said I don't know where you want me to email that you know
[29:39.680 --> 29:43.520]  what I think I got the side I'll look it up but you can send stuff to show tips

[34:59.400 --> 35:03.480]  be blackmailed with that and it's a very dangerous game to start killing media
[35:03.480 --> 35:07.960]  people in the United States it's been done before but if someone is extremely
[35:07.960 --> 35:13.360]  prominent and has already put out such a huge body of work killing them
[35:13.360 --> 35:20.360]  highlights underlines puts a hundred exclamation points and bull horns out
[35:20.360 --> 35:25.480]  that information when you get killed is when you have absolute eyewitness
[35:25.480 --> 35:33.600]  accounts and proof of crimes inside the system that's the type of thing that
[35:33.600 --> 35:36.520]  could sink the globalist they would rather try to assassinate my character
[35:36.520 --> 35:41.840]  I do that on my own sometimes just cuz I'm so real and it is unscripted but it
[35:41.840 --> 35:47.280]  doesn't matter the information is out there and if I was to die tomorrow God
[35:47.280 --> 35:51.840]  forbid I'll never commit suicide I know that but if I was to die tomorrow I've
[35:51.840 --> 35:55.760]  already had a big victory and so have you so it's look in fact I have an
[35:55.760 --> 36:01.360]  example of that we're gonna show later of people putting info wars calm on their
[36:01.360 --> 36:07.360]  cars and and and just the power of that all the people they're meeting the
[36:07.360 --> 36:10.840]  like-minded people they're finding people wearing info wars calm shirts to
[36:10.840 --> 36:14.920]  work and finding out that other people were listeners and it's creating
[36:14.920 --> 36:20.400]  community you can do that with a Ron Paul shirt as well it's it's it's flying
[36:20.400 --> 36:24.920]  your colors that you love freedom and you're awake and you know what's going
[36:24.920 --> 36:30.640]  on if you go to our Facebook page and click on the photos wall you can see it
[36:30.640 --> 36:34.720]  there it is photos videos Alex Jones a lot of the listeners every day I see
[36:34.720 --> 36:38.800]  new ones post the side of their barn spray pen and info wars calm or street
[36:38.800 --> 36:43.240]  art or people writing on the money or people writing on the bathroom walls
[36:43.240 --> 36:49.000]  I'm not really condoning that or putting it on their cars amazing I'm here
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.880]  risking my life my treasure my name my family because I want the great goal the
[36:54.880 --> 36:59.680]  great jewel of freedom in our time and incredible freedom and exploration and
[36:59.680 --> 37:03.920]  discovery for our children to come all right let me go back to the calls before
[37:03.920 --> 37:09.640]  I get into news and then never get back to the calls but coming up Egyptian
[37:09.640 --> 37:15.200]  presidential front-runner promises tougher line on Israel why would the
[37:15.200 --> 37:19.960]  West kick out the old dictator that I'm not single bark was good but did
[37:19.960 --> 37:23.320]  everything the West wanted and why would they put in the Muslim Brotherhood and
[37:23.320 --> 37:26.720]  Al-Qaeda affiliated grips because they're getting ready for the clash of
[37:26.720 --> 37:31.560]  civilizations why do they put the underwear bomber on the plane why do
[37:31.560 --> 37:34.640]  they train the driver given the bomb the detonators the First World Trade Center
[37:34.640 --> 37:42.240]  attack why do they train Muhammad at a US military bases AP Reuters Newsweek why
[37:42.240 --> 37:46.160]  did they order the US Embassy to let him and six others in even though they were
[37:46.160 --> 37:50.240]  flagged terrorists they told them their CIA agents their terror designation as a
[37:50.240 --> 37:54.320]  cover their double agents they were taking parts in drills in the week
[37:54.320 --> 37:58.360]  before they were just taking part in a simulation of hijacking an aircraft to
[37:58.360 --> 38:04.040]  see if they could penetrate they were set up as you do know operation North
[38:04.040 --> 38:14.120]  Woods 2001 we even know the name of the umbrella drill tripod to stuff we talk
[38:14.120 --> 38:18.880]  about on this show has the NSA's wires burning not not not even so much
[38:18.880 --> 38:24.280]  listening to me watching who in government is listening and the system
[38:24.280 --> 38:30.280]  now knows whoa 70 plus percent of all donations from the military were to Ron
[38:30.280 --> 38:36.800]  Paul for all political candidates Republican and Democrat whoa Alex Jones's
[38:36.800 --> 38:45.440]  information is on fire when I tell you that I met with a Navy SEAL that I have
[38:45.440 --> 38:50.200]  known through certain ways for several years I'll leave it at that through
[38:50.200 --> 38:56.920]  family and he said yes SEAL team six knows that their helicopter was blown up
[38:56.920 --> 39:05.160]  and they know they've been lotten things fake and then I get contacted by a high
[39:05.160 --> 39:16.080]  level intelligence group and they tell me directly that a subdirector of the CIA
[39:16.080 --> 39:19.800]  by name says you're right the been lotten things fake thank you for what
[39:19.800 --> 39:24.480]  you're doing I mean it's like Steve Pacenek who CFR wrote a bunch of these
[39:24.480 --> 39:29.160]  movies that Harrison Ford's in wrote the but many of the first books with Tom
[39:29.160 --> 39:34.760]  Clancy famous guy overthrew heads of state you know I mean this I mean this
[39:34.760 --> 39:39.400]  guy's you know like the E Howard Hunt type but beyond that a psychiatrist and
[39:39.400 --> 39:43.680]  he's calling up saying yeah the 9-11's an inside job the military's waking up
[39:43.680 --> 39:47.080]  the people in intelligence appreciate what you're doing because the truth is
[39:47.080 --> 39:51.120]  most these people have done a lot of things that some would see as terrible
[39:51.120 --> 39:54.680]  but they don't they did it because they thought they were fighting communism now
[39:54.680 --> 40:00.000]  as they see it becoming America it's really waking people up when I mean he
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.360]  he but Pacenek used to talk about how he thought Petraeus was a good guy because
[40:03.360 --> 40:06.680]  he worked with him he's come out and said Petraeus should resign he's a
[40:06.680 --> 40:11.680]  disgrace for coming out and saying the CIA spying on everybody domestically and
[40:11.680 --> 40:18.960]  you know all this police state is good it's just it's out in the open America
[40:18.960 --> 40:25.680]  has been overrun by scum and people throughout the system have got to gut
[40:25.680 --> 40:29.580]  up whether you're an individual whether you're a civilian whether you're a
[40:29.580 --> 40:33.340]  police officer military whoever you are you're gonna have to start staying
[40:33.340 --> 40:39.000]  up somehow and I'm not saying first day go out and you know really throw it all
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.720]  the line but start doing little things because little things together move
[40:43.720 --> 40:48.520]  mountains because the only way out of this is standing up the only way I've
[40:48.520 --> 40:53.800]  always said this I'm afraid of being afraid being afraid does not feel good
[40:53.800 --> 41:01.720]  being afraid is the mind killer to quote Frank Herbert the little death
[41:01.720 --> 41:08.240]  another French saying orgasms a little death but for me the little death is
[41:08.240 --> 41:14.240]  fear and when you let fear pass through you and over you then it becomes
[41:14.240 --> 41:20.580]  strength it becomes strength I love life so much that I'm willing to give
[41:20.580 --> 41:28.080]  mine up in defense of freedom all right let's go to your phone calls Kim in
[41:28.080 --> 41:33.560]  Alaska you're on the air go ahead
[41:33.560 --> 41:38.280]  I'm angry because starts out when they circumcised me at birth and then I went
[41:38.280 --> 41:42.960]  on and my parents got divorced at 12 years old and the New World Order to
[41:42.960 --> 41:46.680]  convince them that you know you had to be in the parents have to be independent
[41:46.680 --> 41:50.760]  and I went on and live in government subsidized housing but I came out of it
[41:50.760 --> 41:57.200]  I'm from Detroit my great-grandfather in 1942 retired from Ford and my uncle is a
[41:57.200 --> 42:00.680]  millwright he was a millwright but it goes all throughout my family and I
[42:00.680 --> 42:03.680]  just want to say to all those people in Michigan that you need to get up and
[42:03.680 --> 42:07.200]  stand up and get out there and do something I had to do something I had to
[42:07.200 --> 42:10.320]  get out of there I had to move away I came up to Alaska where there's a loyal
[42:10.320 --> 42:15.560]  and I had to have two kids and those two kids are uncircumstised and they're
[42:15.560 --> 42:19.280]  non-vaccinated and they're live and they're vibrant and they're healthy and
[42:19.280 --> 42:24.240]  how do you like that New World Order that's what I gotta say right now well
[42:24.240 --> 42:27.560]  God bless you and I really appreciate your call and love your anger because the
[42:27.560 --> 42:32.240]  anger is the beginning of getting motivated as for circumcision I never
[42:32.240 --> 42:37.160]  even thought of it as a big issue and people are always pointing it out to me
[42:37.160 --> 42:42.720]  and the more I research it it is basically sexual mutilation at many
[42:42.720 --> 42:47.160]  levels and I could understand that sometimes it does get infected there's
[42:47.160 --> 42:51.180]  an argument that it's got a medical reason it's a big debate and it really
[42:51.180 --> 42:57.600]  upsets a lot of people that have been circumcised I want to get into I mean
[42:57.600 --> 43:01.800]  I'm circumcised and most people in America most Protestants at least you
[43:01.800 --> 43:06.160]  have been circumcised I mean I think back around the time I was born about
[43:06.160 --> 43:12.560]  90% of people were I've I've never I mean I mean I guess you don't know what
[43:12.560 --> 43:17.040]  you've lost if you never had it so I never I mean I understand a lot of
[43:17.040 --> 43:20.600]  people are really upset about it and feel like something was stolen from them
[43:20.600 --> 43:27.920]  and I get it I totally I totally get it but but again it's like when you're
[43:27.920 --> 43:37.000]  born into something you don't recognize it and so I think the issue is a newborn
[43:37.000 --> 43:42.680]  can't make the decision on whether they want it or not so they shouldn't be you
[43:42.680 --> 43:47.120]  know that's the issue and circumcision you know is a way so people could tell
[43:47.120 --> 43:51.520]  are you part of this group are you part of this tribe and then it got you know
[43:51.520 --> 43:59.960]  adopted into Christianity and it's just it's just a standard thing but I I do
[43:59.960 --> 44:03.240]  hear what you're saying that's the thing about when I just open the phones up no
[44:03.240 --> 44:07.360]  screening the calls just randomly taking calls it'll go on a lot of different
[44:07.360 --> 44:13.160]  directions but people say well what's the difference of what the Muslims do
[44:13.160 --> 44:19.960]  when they cut away part of the female organ and when it's put in that context
[44:19.960 --> 44:27.360]  you're like yeah I get it but then I've talked to medical doctors and people and
[44:27.360 --> 44:29.960]  they're like no we see a lot of problems with people that aren't circumcised
[44:29.960 --> 44:34.440]  infections and things but then that becomes the issue of there's like
[44:34.440 --> 44:40.920]  people suing Apple right now saying the apps are addictive for children well
[44:40.920 --> 44:45.520]  yeah it's rewiring their brains moderate use of it is causing brain damage
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.240]  because it's not normal humans were never designed for this the it's making
[44:49.240 --> 44:53.520]  their attention spans tiny it's a fact massive studies out there I told you
[44:53.520 --> 44:58.600]  about it years ago now it's admitted I have the studies there but now it's a
[44:58.600 --> 45:01.280]  big issue but I'm like why are you letting your children do this then I
[45:01.280 --> 45:07.040]  mean I go to restaurants now and most the children have iPhones or iPads so the
[45:07.040 --> 45:10.000]  parents can do what they want and the parents are on smartphones doing it and
[45:10.000 --> 45:17.240]  I've made a point that it'll be seven o'clock at night I'm eating dinner one
[45:17.240 --> 45:20.560]  of the yeah I've left to go eat dinner out to eat with my wife and the kids or
[45:20.560 --> 45:23.600]  something Rob do calls up working like oh hey what do you want to call this
[45:23.600 --> 45:29.720]  video part of the report I'm like I'll call it this or what do you think or
[45:29.720 --> 45:32.440]  they'll call and say have you seen this and they text it to me and I look at it
[45:32.440 --> 45:39.960]  but I'm just making myself now turn it off put it in my pocket and check it
[45:39.960 --> 45:44.920]  in little controlled burst because it's dominating my life as well so again when
[45:44.920 --> 45:48.880]  you're just introduced to something and slowly ease into it like the frog in the
[45:48.880 --> 45:53.920]  boiling pot of water if it's slowly turned up you you roast you boil and
[45:53.920 --> 45:59.320]  that's what's happening now let's go ahead and talk to Alan in California
[45:59.320 --> 46:04.640]  you're on the air hey Alex how you doing good Alex just want to say you are an
[46:04.640 --> 46:08.080]  amazing man you woke me up probably about a year and a half ago actually
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.160]  found you through Jesse Ventura on conspiracy theory I used to work in
[46:12.160 --> 46:16.560]  radio I was a complete sheeple I you know voted for Obama I mean he suckered
[46:16.560 --> 46:22.160]  me I have found you guys and started researching and I remember I'm like yeah
[46:22.160 --> 46:26.320]  that Alex Jones guy remember hearing him you know through the radio and just
[46:26.320 --> 46:31.320]  looked things up woke up my best friend and he works at a fast food place what
[46:31.320 --> 46:35.000]  he does is he actually puts your show on at night he's a manager so he plugs in
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.280]  your show at night so that his customers will listen and he spreads the word we
[46:39.280 --> 46:42.800]  started a Facebook group if you'll allow me to kind of say that what you do yeah
[46:42.800 --> 46:48.040]  what is it yeah it's a Facebook group and it's awake USA we started with seven
[46:48.040 --> 46:52.120]  people we're about at 145 people then it's been online maybe about five six
[46:52.120 --> 46:57.320]  months so it's going like crazy what I wanted to ask you is you actually before
[46:57.320 --> 47:00.600]  you started the reporter contest we wanted to call you and ask you if you
[47:00.600 --> 47:04.200]  would ever consider having kind of like a cub reporter type thing something that
[47:04.200 --> 47:07.600]  you don't have to pay because that's living here in San Diego we have tons of
[47:07.600 --> 47:11.400]  military and Navy going on absolutely with it look I'm trying to grow my
[47:11.400 --> 47:18.160]  operation to where I have the managers who can then go through affiliate
[47:18.160 --> 47:22.120]  reporters because for liability and stuff you can be infiltrated with a fake
[47:22.120 --> 47:26.760]  reporter who didn't get some cred just to get close to you and then they make up
[47:26.760 --> 47:31.120]  lies to create a Co and tell pro deal we see that a lot but if people are just
[47:31.120 --> 47:36.360]  affiliates and then we plug the name of their site or their Facebook you know
[47:36.360 --> 47:43.200]  like your name awake USA like here's Alan whatever your last name is awake USA
[47:43.200 --> 47:49.480]  reporting for info wars calm and then it's courtesy we can have reporters all
[47:49.480 --> 47:53.200]  over the country but more importantly because my doors are beaten are being
[47:53.200 --> 47:57.080]  beaten down with this and it's what people want and it's true we need
[47:57.080 --> 48:04.880]  Australian affiliates England Germany Russia Mexico we want it gets harder when
[48:04.880 --> 48:08.520]  you get into other languages though because again we don't have the the
[48:08.520 --> 48:12.240]  interpreters or people to check it on and we do but then they're all busy and
[48:12.240 --> 48:15.360]  we have folks that do speak Spanish a lot of folks and I want to read it it's
[48:15.360 --> 48:18.440]  just that it gets harder with language interface obviously but that's a whole
[48:18.440 --> 48:22.160]  plan we've got we had a few more reporters here so you can send them
[48:22.160 --> 48:27.600]  places every week and have them reporting a male and female reporter we and we
[48:27.600 --> 48:31.120]  may even hire more it's it's it's how much capital we can bring in through
[48:31.120 --> 48:35.800]  sponsors through things like that but then yes we can have affiliate reporters
[48:35.800 --> 48:40.240]  who are from their organization reporting for info wars calm and then they
[48:40.240 --> 48:44.200]  get the consideration of the truth getting out but also their their website
[48:44.200 --> 48:49.640]  plugged and then attention on info wars calm that is our plan that is where
[48:49.640 --> 48:54.800]  going for you Alex because we have a lot of stuff like I said for example we
[48:54.800 --> 48:58.800]  were here being here in San Diego have a friend who likes airplanes and the
[48:58.800 --> 49:02.960]  T1 airport is right next to the border we went over there to watch it and we
[49:02.960 --> 49:07.640]  had I'm not kidding you for DHS border patrol cars come right up to us and
[49:07.640 --> 49:11.320]  they were asking what are we doing are we waiting for drugs to be thrown over and
[49:11.320 --> 49:14.240]  I wasn't awake when this happened or else I would have been or I would have
[49:14.240 --> 49:17.240]  said something I was like no what are you guys are you kidding me can we look
[49:17.240 --> 49:20.280]  through your car bubble I'm like are we doing something wrong you know they
[49:20.280 --> 49:22.720]  were just like all over us it's like this is something I wish I would have
[49:22.720 --> 49:25.960]  had my my iPhone out I would have sent this right away it's like they just all
[49:25.960 --> 49:29.720]  over you for no reason the way to handle it is the minute they pull up just say
[49:29.720 --> 49:34.960]  hey guys we're just a citizen reporters out here doing a border story and when
[49:34.960 --> 49:38.800]  they start asking for stuff just say come on man you know use your brain we're
[49:38.800 --> 49:42.520]  not drug dealers and if they start getting more just say don't violate my
[49:42.520 --> 49:45.600]  rights you wouldn't want yours violated they say hey let us look in your car
[49:45.600 --> 49:49.080]  say can I look in yours because statistically the border patrol has
[49:49.080 --> 49:52.920]  been caught bringing a lot of drugs so statistically you're not saying you're
[49:52.920 --> 49:57.960]  bad individually statistically the MO if I profile you is that you're a drug
[49:57.960 --> 50:01.000]  dealer that's what I say to border patrol a hundred miles in when they want to
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.280]  search my car I say no you can't you want to make a big scene go ahead by the
[50:05.280 --> 50:08.880]  way I know you your bosses ship in narcotics and usually at that point they
[50:08.880 --> 50:13.880]  smile and go get on out of here and I'm like yeah because let me tell you I got
[50:13.880 --> 50:16.800]  to say about half the border patrol from the Intel I've got who's in
[50:16.800 --> 50:21.360]  management is taking money I mean you look at New York narcotics police

[54:55.000 --> 55:00.160]  open for VP slot that's pretty big breaking news it'd only been second hand
[55:00.160 --> 55:07.040]  statements by Jesse Benton and people who adds up his dad's campaign but he's
[55:07.040 --> 55:10.880]  just leaving the door open I want to get your take on that Senator Rand Paul says
[55:10.880 --> 55:15.040]  he's concerned Interpol could arrest Americans under foreign laws that's the
[55:15.040 --> 55:18.560]  big issue it's people are like well Interpol already arrest people yeah when
[55:18.560 --> 55:21.480]  there's an agreement with the country that they're polls working for in Europe
[55:21.480 --> 55:26.920]  that's when that happens like oh yeah we have a we have extradition agreements
[55:26.920 --> 55:30.360]  with you for murder and things this is just you're under European law we're
[55:30.360 --> 55:35.360]  coming to arrest you for your speech or whatever your cars that have become part
[55:35.360 --> 55:40.800]  of the Internet of Things all part of that Google Panopticon spy system it's
[55:40.800 --> 55:46.680]  all up at info wars.com and briefly I've done a lot of research people can
[55:46.680 --> 55:51.920]  debate this all day reverse osmosis is great water distillation is great all
[55:51.920 --> 55:56.560]  that's wonderful but it cuts out many of the good minerals so I cook with
[55:56.560 --> 56:02.680]  reverse osmosis I've got distillation systems if I need it but I just do a
[56:02.680 --> 56:06.520]  mix I drink my well water I drink my rainwater but when I'm on the road I've
[56:06.520 --> 56:11.720]  got a propure road filter in my house I drink a lot of filtered water because
[56:11.720 --> 56:17.560]  with a system like propure that we have discounted at info wars.com 10% off when
[56:17.560 --> 56:22.240]  you put product code water in it's a gravity-fed filter and it reduces many
[56:22.240 --> 56:25.720]  things to non-detectable levels it's got special fluoride filters that reduces
[56:25.720 --> 56:29.480]  it almost down to nothing you can put swamp water in this and drink it the
[56:29.480 --> 56:34.000]  point is is that it's just the latest development and then the best one I've
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.640]  used there's a lot of other good ones out there but it's just heads above the
[56:37.640 --> 56:42.760]  rest look at the side-by-side comparison at info wars.com click on the
[56:42.760 --> 56:46.520]  shopping cart link go to the water filter section they also have shower
[56:46.520 --> 56:51.280]  filter systems the best we found out there for the price that reduce
[56:51.280 --> 56:56.280]  everything doesn't cut it all out but some things are so small but it reduces
[56:56.280 --> 56:59.120]  it and a lot of the poison you're getting is through the biggest organ in
[56:59.120 --> 57:03.000]  your body the skin you're also breathing it through your lungs so the shower
[57:03.000 --> 57:08.320]  filter is essential I live in the country now and have rain water but
[57:08.320 --> 57:13.360]  still I like to filter it because there's stuff in the rain now there's so
[57:13.360 --> 57:17.240]  many toxins out there so again go look at the side-by-side comparisons of the

[01:00:50.600 --> 01:01:00.160]  air Gus hi Alex how are you good buddy my daughter spends some weekends with
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:08.360]  your friend Dave in a temp cool so she's friends with the Mustangs yeah they
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:17.240]  go to school together and I'm a long-time listener and I'm calling and I finally
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:22.560]  got through and you know it's very depressing seeing what we're seeing
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:32.680]  because it's like there's no way around this you know now well you know what
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.040]  happened if citizens started picking out cameras and deciding they disappear
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.960]  they'd remove them people started attacking all the cameras in Arizona
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.880]  they're they're pulling them out I'm not saying do that but yes it's
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.440]  overwhelming because the globalists are just doing whatever they want they
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:51.480]  don't care they're just exercising power against us we're going to have to
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.640]  start exercising power you start looking for opportunities to peacefully
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:00.160]  sabotage the globalist let's say you live next door to an elitist or you're
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.040]  serving an elitist dinner and you hear him talking about criminal stuff just
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.000]  put it out there start getting aggressive there's ways look it's like
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.880]  fight club wherever Tyler Durgan goes people are like hey I get it most people
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.040]  aren't prominent in a fight for liberty so they don't know how many other people
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:23.360]  are awake I am prominent I do know I mean it's ridiculous now I can go to a
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:27.280]  restaurant another city or another country and half the people come over to
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:31.920]  me and I can barely buy myself dinner and everybody's winking and saying we
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.360]  know what's going on or I see Austin cops and they stop and go we're awake you
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.800]  know we're riding their bicycles downtown I'm like okay you're awake do
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.440]  something see people are awake they're just not doing something or they see the
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.680]  other half who isn't awake Gus and they think well nobody cares I mean what do
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:55.800]  you think I I think it's it's very depressing because nobody's doing
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:02.400]  anything when I watched this lady yesterday you know go ahead and tell
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.880]  the truth and she goes out and she says I told the people in the building and
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.880]  they go well my government wouldn't do that well what's wrong with humanity you
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.520]  know I I think they have reverse munchausen by proxy or something like
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.160]  that no I agree with you they want to be abused by the government but it's
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:26.080]  Stockholm syndrome really where where about a 40% on average of people depends
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.560]  on the nation state in the group and their history but around 40% if they
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:35.360]  get kidnapped we'll start worshiping the kidnappers and join them and and fight
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:40.080]  for the kidnappers because people decide to rationalize and just be part of it
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:46.080]  no you're right we have massive Stockholm syndrome it's ridiculous I mean
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.120]  they kill the president they kill his son they they like I'm listening sunny
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.040]  bono I all this time I honestly thought you know and I'm a I'm one of those
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.800]  conspiracy nuts they call me you know like there's no way you're gonna
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.160]  convince me there were any terrorists on 9-11 because there's no way an aluminum
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:07.920]  airplane can go through a building just go watch the footage of that military
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.720]  jet that fell in San Diego a couple of weeks ago okay fell into a brick
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.240]  building the two-story building the building was still standing you know
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:23.520]  it's a joke that people think that that you know two airplanes could go through
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:28.320]  no that's it no steel building of that type had ever fallen from fire we've
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.700]  had big jets hit them before they burned for weeks sometimes nothing falls but
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:38.280]  a little bitty supports and before an insurance now is having to reevaluate and
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.320]  charge more for big buildings and they're saying now they can fall even
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.760]  though their internal science at underwriter laboratory says it's
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:49.200]  impossible I mean pretty soon you can say you blow at a building if they said
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.680]  an Easter Bunny blew on the buildings then they would have to stop building
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:57.080]  buildings because an Easter Bunny might blow on them again it's all fantasy land
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:03.400]  great points this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.640]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.840]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.720]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:20.240]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:24.320]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.640]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the

[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:44.640]  building in Oklahoma City and to go over the evidence of this is mind-blowing
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:51.000]  how much of an inside job it is and how totally proven like with 9-11 we know
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.760]  the official stories alive we know who had the motive we know PNAC wrote
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.120]  documents that it would help to have a big terror attack to take the liberties
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:03.160]  and launch wars 3000 dead would be good Dick Cheney said September 20th 2000

[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:11.840]  proud of it all these White House memos that are out now three of them from
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.120]  advisors saying Oklahoma City or new 9-11 is the only way you're getting
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:20.760]  reelected you can blame your enemies with it gee we sure need this they're
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:25.400]  like saying they're doing it that's how dumb they think we are and it's like
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:29.800]  even if people know it's an inside job now self-inflicted wound is now entered
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:34.480]  the vernacular to a great extent people still just go along with the big media
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.360]  event and the children and we'll get those enemies and let's show some

[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:50.720]  the traitor is the plague and anger is a gift and focused indignation to take
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.560]  action against these people and it begins with not being cowards we're gonna
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.400]  play about eight nine minutes of the hour-long Jane Graham interview that's
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:04.320]  at prisonplanet.tv we've also now posted on the YouTube channel from the
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.000]  nightly news last night get it out to everyone in fact I forget the headline
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.800]  on that I don't even think we posted that on info wars.com so one to our
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.640]  webmasters are so great but there's so much news that it's like we always
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.400]  post everybody else's stuff like look this guy dropped a shoe on the side of

[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.920]  of Air Force weapons development multi-time engineer I mean it just goes
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:22.280]  on and on police officers like Don Browning the FBI comes will kill you and
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.680]  your wife he was the head of the canine unit there minutes after if you talk
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.600]  about what you saw Terrence Yege they talked to his family he was murdered
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:35.960]  cop of the year I mean folks this is sensationally evil what the globalist
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:41.920]  did the truth is so much crazier and it's the very crew running things now at
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:45.280]  the Justice Department that were involved in the cover-up of the black op
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:51.720]  teams in FBI CIA defense intelligence we know is connected at certain levels
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:57.640]  that mention ATF FBI a noble lie available at info wars.com people have
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:03.240]  died police officers have been brutally tortured to death for the
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:07.120]  information in this film you understand that and Jane Graham on the show last
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.720]  night talked about all the different threats other police officers she's
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.080]  talked to and where they'd go to the police chief and others they'd say yeah
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:20.040]  you better shut up you're dead I got some golf to play you know but still the
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.760]  you know that the FBI know there's a real sad about the blown up children
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:30.160]  meanwhile meanwhile meanwhile I mean that's that's the even sicker part is I
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.920]  had to hear on the news what heroes the feds were how they were gonna keep us
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:38.920]  safe they're not the feds they're the criminals but you don't think criminals
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.040]  don't want the federal government that can tax tens of trillions a year and
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:47.000]  steal it and give it to themselves that's all it is crooks took over crooks
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.320]  took over crooks took over a noble lie Oklahoma City and why do I have it here
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:59.600]  next to behind the green mask it's in a 21 also available info wars.com because
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.280]  to carry out this total tyranny on the shutdown of society literally making us
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.480]  all prisoners and turning America into a giant prison it's worldwide in 21 by
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:11.160]  the way but I was talking about the US right now they need to stage the terror
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:16.040]  attack to demonize those that were against the UN takeover that's what
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.600]  Oklahoma was doing was leading a states rights movement against agenda 21 they
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:25.240]  had resolutions against it in their state house so they got picked for the
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:31.240]  daycare center a little bomb shoved in it and they had the FBI director's
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:37.120]  deputy there an hour after blocking the fire department from going in and
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:43.240]  making sure those unexploded goodies got taken out cops that talked about it get
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:48.560]  exes for eyes you've got the FBI had a terror counter terrorism there lying
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:54.280]  saying he wasn't these are nice people these are very nice people but you're
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.720]  supposed to be sappy wrap yourself in American flag and say I'm not gonna
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:01.760]  believe it and then salute the foreign terrorists that have hijacked our
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:06.440]  government and say patriotism is having the troops die of DU patriotism is

[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.080]  now to our guest James Lane the director and Holland then a new and off
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:51.880]  writer-producer here to discuss it you hear me ranting here gentlemen because
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:55.320]  it's not fun having to get on air and talk about these murders but it's got
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:59.120]  to be done it's not fun putting myself in harm's way but I'm in greater harm's
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:03.640]  way by not confronting him head-on gentlemen we're gonna break about five
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.640]  six minutes you've got the floor for now tell us the key points of while
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:12.320]  Oklahoma City's important and what the smoking guns are thank you for having
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:17.320]  us on Alex I think for us or for me personally the biggest smoking gun was
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:20.080]  the additional ordinance that were inside the building the official story
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.520]  states that they truck bomb was the sole source of destruction that the AP
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:28.480]  Murrow building the morning of April 19th 1995 we've got Jane Grammy we're
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.840]  speaking about her earlier her VZ lot and other people that were actually in
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.560]  the building that survived said that the building was coming down it was shaking
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.240]  they it was some of them thought it was an earthquake so it was coming down eight
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:43.320]  to ten seconds before the glass blew in it that the FEMA report says that the
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:47.320]  blast wave from that truck was traveling at 1,700 feet per second that right
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:51.120]  there just proves that that that that was the sole explosive and since they
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.960]  won't release the videotape that would show exactly what happened in front of
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:58.280]  the Murrow building we have to go in the science of the matter now despite the
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:01.360]  24 eyewitness accounts that place McVeigh with another person in that
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.560]  right or truck in front of the Murrow building one can always make the
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.920]  argument which they have that somehow all these two dozen witnesses were
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.680]  mistaken but one cannot deny the science and in a possible examples have
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:14.200]  been used to demonstrate the science the Air Force actually conducted a
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.240]  simulation of the Oklahoma City bombing at Eglin Air Force Base they set up a
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.880]  test structure is a three-story very simple slab structure with no support
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:27.000]  no support columns and actually constructed an info bomb according to
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.440]  how the FBI and Tim McVeigh said it had been constructed a dozen barrels of
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.840]  55 gallon barrels packed with info what they found was that each barrel act as
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.200]  a separate bomb and that most of the explosive force was cancelled and
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:44.640]  whatever remained went straight up it did nothing to their test structure so
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:49.000]  they actually constructed a stronger more powerful single four thousand
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.280]  pound bomb and exploded that outside their structure to see the results what
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:57.800]  they found was that their test structure much less robust than the
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.520]  than the Murrow building which had been designed with bomb resistance and bomb
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.840]  resistance in mind suffered much less damage from a more powerful bomb than
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.720]  what was you supposedly used in Oklahoma City so then they tested the
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:15.000]  hypothesis of explosives inside the building so they actually put bombs
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.720]  inside their test structure blew it up and recorded the results the final
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:23.560]  conclusion of the right armament laboratory out of Elgin Air Force Base
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:27.240]  is that there were bombs inside the building so you have one branch of
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:30.600]  government saying that there were bombs inside the building yet the spokesman
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.200]  for the government says that the info in the truck bomb was the sole cause of
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:37.760]  destruction they can't even get their story straight we know that info was
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.440]  not the even in the truck because the hallmark of an info bomb ammonium
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.800]  nitrate and fuel oil is a nitric gas cloud turn shake he was on the scene
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:49.040]  within minutes pulling Tom Hall out of the building saving eight seven other
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:53.040]  people that day he had no problem with respiration neither did any of the
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:57.400]  survivors every time that an info bomb has been exploded the first responders
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:01.240]  are normally hospitalized from the inhalation of nitric gas that was not
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:04.840]  there that was a present at the at the Murrow building that day that calls in
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:08.680]  question what was actually in the truck and you got the ATF there seconds after
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:13.160]  demanding people patch them up that they were on the ninth floor you got the ATF
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.480]  detonating months before their own rider truck testing it out you've got
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:22.040]  McVay you've got the feds running Elohim City I mean the list just goes on and
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:28.480]  on well the Oklahoma City story the the official story is so easy to disprove it's
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:31.760]  one of the most in fact I say my my position is that they would be very
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.560]  hard-pressed to pull something off as sloppy as Oklahoma City these days
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.800]  because of the dissemination of information made possible by the
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:42.920]  information revolution in 1995 the internet was still as an infancy so we
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:46.560]  didn't see the rapid spread of information that you see these days that
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.040]  they tried to pull something like Oklahoma City off these days it would
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.080]  just blow up right in their face that's another good point there they have

[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:11.280]  all right I went to break and the writer and producer of a noble lie
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:15.320]  Holland Vanden Neuenhof was telling us about a street action they had at the
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:20.240]  site of the globalist stage Reichstag event in Oklahoma City at the at the
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.960]  site of the false flag self-inflicted staged wound to demonize the American
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:28.560]  people and bring in the police state we're now witnessing with highway
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:33.440]  checkpoints and TSA secret police now on the streets of Houston and other cities
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:38.480]  tell us about the street action yes we've long promised ourselves that one
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:42.240]  day we would pass out copies of the movie at the memorial on the anniversary
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.280]  because every year at the anniversary at the memorial they celebrate the lie and
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:49.880]  they try to remember the lies of those 168 dead people with a lie not with
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.680]  truth and justice in their hearts the politicians get up there they make their
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.680]  speeches and they celebrate that it's about the institutionalization of the
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.120]  lie I mean they packed past legislation saying that the official
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:05.280]  they feed vampirically each year off the children that their bosses murder
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:10.560]  exactly so we went out there today we are change Oklahoma and we set up
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.040]  outside both gates of time with teams on either side of the street and we had
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:19.400]  donated 500 free copies of the movie to be passed out today and every single
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:25.360]  person went in there went out got a copy of a noble lie a total antidote to the
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:31.480]  line of propaganda that they're fed inside the memorial one thing that was
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:34.640]  really strange this year that we haven't we've never seen before me we're out
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:38.400]  there most most years was that the homeland security presence and what
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.400]  wasn't there last year there was a homeland security mobile command center
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.680]  there massive they had lined up the SWAT team in front of one of the gates of
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.840]  time as a ceremony let out which I think is an abomination well it's something
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.760]  that said criminals always returned to the scene of the crime I mean this is
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:57.680]  this is a part of sucking every bit of the murdered children they can and dog
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:03.600]  and pony show because remember Alex a third of this audience are cops they're
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:07.120]  all carrying guns no one is going to do anything there but I mean they're on duty
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:11.200]  off duty but you don't need a homeland security swat no it's the feds are gonna
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:15.000]  be on your streets keeping you safe when they blow your buildings up they even
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.880]  had a mobile command center a huge thing probably cost $250,000 but the thing is
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.760]  the museum Memorial they have a command center upstairs they don't need a mobile
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:26.200]  command center on site well of course they don't need it it's all to make us
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:30.560]  think there's a real threat and there is one there the terrorist but we did
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.960]  manage to actually get a few copies to some of those folks and people that
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:37.120]  actually work at the Memorial they were asking for it some of the people working
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:40.440]  there working in the Memorial were asking about the movie and wanted copies
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.720]  head of security actually yeah we should say that on air but yeah he got a copy
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:47.440]  asked for one well that's good because they need to choose whose side they're
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:51.640]  on exactly and so I mean we're not just you know providing this information to
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:54.400]  you know that the general public that was going in there victims family
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:57.160]  members survivors etc I mean these are the people that actually part of the
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:01.200]  institutionalization of the lie you know I was at the ground zero last
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.400]  September 11th for the Memorial there and I had my weird change Oklahoma shirt
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:08.640]  on I get a gentleman comes up he's like oh Oklahoma he goes I'm from the the
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.720]  museum there in Oklahoma City oh really what are you doing here I'm helping set
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:16.160]  up the museum in New York City so they're taking everything that they've
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.400]  learned here moving it to New York and you see the same thing where they're
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.120]  passing legislation saying the official story of 9-11 will be taught in the
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:25.640]  schools I mean if it's not if people you know like you and us and everybody out
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.840]  there listening doesn't get out there and get this information out you know
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:31.560]  we're gonna we're gonna lose because we're up against a machine you know but
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:34.360]  what they can't they cannot defeat us if we are actually out there having those
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:38.880]  one-on-one conversations show that's right that's right no no that there are
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:43.240]  millions of other patriots in low intensity info war conflict at point
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:47.720]  blank range talking and educating and given business cards and DVDs and
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:52.480]  putting it on access TV we can swarm the enemy and we will do it here's an
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:58.320]  example Aaron and I noticed about three years ago a meme in TV that Bill Gates is
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:03.280]  a superhero trying to give kids shots and then we noticed suddenly all over the
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:07.880]  news they were calling him a superhero and we discovered that he's paying ABC
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:14.520]  hundreds of newspapers about CNN you name it they're paying to have him as a
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:18.920]  superhero now they're gonna have a comic book where he's a superhero to the kids
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:22.400]  and anyone that doesn't take the vaccines is the bad guys so I'm gonna
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:26.760]  imagine the propaganda and here's Forbes why Bill Gates is a hero this is a
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.960]  terror attack these shots and Donald Trump is a zero Donald Trump and look
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.440]  they talked to you like you're an idiot but look why Bill Gates is a hero and
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:40.920]  Donald Trump is a zero Forbes Matthew Harper and my point here is when we go
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.320]  to break and come back and talk about this and more in the next long segment
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:47.960]  is that they're panicking they're panicking that people have got the
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:51.080]  Bill Omelette Gates documents the Rockefeller documents where they talk
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:54.400]  about sterilizing to the vaccines they're panicking that they're learning
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.880]  Bill Omelette Gates are giving people real polio in the shots as a cover
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:04.160]  story they're panicking and it's coming out that that again they're that even
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:08.080]  even Donald Trump is saying the shots are hurting people and we need to stop it
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:12.880]  they are panicking because they've almost got us where they want us where you
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.720]  know one in 50 something kids have instead of one in 25,000 and they they
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:20.200]  want to get those kids and they don't want it we're at the tipping point of
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:23.600]  saving those kids and they're very upset as the vampire pigs they are so we're
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.360]  gonna come right back on the other side I mean these ghoul demons no we've got
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:31.200]  them and I mean we're just like it's like arm wrestling we have got them the
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:35.400]  momentum is going in our direction and we just got a gift take that gift of
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:39.440]  anger and slam their fist through the floor if there's not a question of
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.280]  we're gonna try to defeat the New World Order we're coming nothing's gonna stop
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:50.480]  it and that's the way it is we'll be right back stay with us we're on the

[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:20.360]  all right we've got about eight nine minutes of an hour plus interview I did
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:24.440]  with Jane Graham last night coming up here and I'm gonna keep our guests a
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:28.920]  little bit in the next hour and open the phones back up and we've got loaded
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:31.920]  phones I'd like to go to those that are holding but they won't be on Oklahoma
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.600]  City and then get to people that are calling about Oklahoma City but going
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:41.360]  back out of you guys James you kick it back off with other points you think
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.800]  are important to make 17 years later after Bill Clinton told USA Today he
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:52.640]  owed his reelection to the OKC bombing well an interesting thing has happened
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:56.280]  here in Oklahoma last year legislation was passed it says if your family's
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:00.560]  member your family members death was declared a suicide you can now dispute
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:04.440]  that and so we're hoping to to leverage some of this momentum to get a new
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:07.920]  investigation into the death of officer Terrence Yakey I know you spoke about
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:13.040]  this case very many times on your show Alex and thank you for that Terry Yakey
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:17.000]  was a police officer that was on the scene within minutes that day saved
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.640]  saved eight people's lives you know his his death was declared a suicide he had
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:27.400]  multiple lacerations on his arms on his neck there was so much blood in the car
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:31.280]  that they said that you could dip it out with a ladle and we're supposed to
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:34.160]  believe that he dragged himself because there was rope marks or whatever there's
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.600]  grass in his wounds dragged himself a mile away and shot himself at a downward
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:41.440]  angle through the top of his head coming out his jaw with a small caliber
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:46.240]  weapon at a far enough distance that it didn't leave any powder burns the
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:49.120]  sheriff's department is there they look for an hour to try to find the weapon
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:52.640]  they can't find it because it was federal property by the way most pistols
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:56.240]  will leave powder burns at even three feet so somebody was far away probably
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:00.760]  six seven feet away and shot him in the head yeah and he was on his knees yeah
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:04.280]  and now you know he made a phone call before this happened to a friend of his
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:07.840]  he was going to many storage and as soon as he shakes his these feds that were
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:11.160]  following him they would meet up and have a meal he'd been followed by the
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.920]  FBI before he knew exactly who was following him and there were two boxes
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:18.120]  of documents in the back of his car when that the sheriff's department arrived
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:22.360]  by the time it hits the impound lot it doesn't make it into inventory there's
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:26.160]  also an incident with them during the rescue efforts
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:30.680]  teriyaki was there a doctor showed up Dr. Plumlee he actually his office was
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:33.800]  down the road as soon as he saw the mushroom cloud he loaded up a station
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:36.480]  wagon full of medical supplies and he sped down to the murder building started
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:41.080]  rescuing people started misturing first aid and triage he was approached by
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:47.680]  an ATF agent who asked Dr. Plumlee to put a bandage on his head and
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:52.320]  his hand although there was no injury he was asking the doctor to put a prop on
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.960]  him Dr. Plumlee lost it he was he was dealing with people who were dying and
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:01.680]  he's got this ATF agent in front of them asking him to give him a costume and he
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:05.480]  and he chewed out the ATF agent Dr. Plumlee they started collaborating with
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:08.960]  Terrence Yeke in their quest to find out exactly what had happened in Oklahoma
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:12.800]  city they were both there they both had questions Terrence Yeke was officer of
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:16.880]  the year he's getting ready to see the medal of bowler when he died and Dr.
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:23.320]  after Terrence Yeke died the FBI raided Dr. Plumlee actually later died in a
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:27.680]  plane crash under under somewhat mysterious circumstances in Texas
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:33.760]  after Terrence Yeke was murdered which we know he was murdered the FBI raided
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:38.600]  his bank without a search warrant and they took out the contents of the
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.240]  safety deposit box that he shared with Dr. Plumlee and they did it without a
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:46.160]  warrant I guess the bank just caved and they want to deal with the FBI they
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:49.880]  don't want to stand up to them I've been told by people who were involved in
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:54.880]  the investigation that Terrence Yeke had acquired a videotape from evidence and
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:37:01.680]  that was what was in the safety deposit box and the FBI took it it's gone it's
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:05.560]  amazing can you imagine them torturing that police officer to death these are
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:09.560]  really nice people he fought to death there was in that car where they found
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:14.080]  his blood there was another blood type so Terrence Yeke fought and you know we're
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:17.200]  really grateful even you know to his family everybody that was involved with
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:20.640]  the documentary to try to get the story out about Terry because I think we need
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:24.080]  even left the house that day he said they were after him and stuff I mean
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.080]  it's it's I mean imagine you leave your house they're after me and then your dad
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:32.200]  is all suicide he had told his family he knew that he was under threat he had
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:37.160]  told his family that if they ever find him dead of a suicide that he's gonna do
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:41.440]  it like this he knew how to do it he's a cop he'd responded to many suicides you
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:44.280]  know how he knows how the right the right way to kill yourself he told them
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:48.520]  I'm gonna do it like this if it's not like that I didn't do it it wasn't him
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:53.200]  he didn't do it now in addition to that you know there's a lot of new
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.160]  information that's coming out through a Jesse Trinadu you know his efforts have
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:02.720]  just been amazing you know we've spoken before about the death of his brother
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:07.480]  that really spurred his need to to get to the truth of that which you know let
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:11.560]  him to the Oklahoma City bombing and I think Pat Kahn is one of the more
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:15.840]  interesting aspects of the of what he hasn't covered at the time of the
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.480]  Oklahoma City bombing the FBI had a sting operations going on where they
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:25.200]  had infiltrated suppose a patriot groups and this was called Patriot
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.000]  conspiracy or Pat Kahn so they had Pat Kahn group one Pat Kahn group two all
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.200]  over the country and we were not able to find any documents about it being an
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:36.320]  evil him city but you know that was a white separatist compound where we know
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:40.920]  that Timothy Bay was operating around creating the legend so they could then
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.760]  set up a patriot group with a bombing he was going around creating that history
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.480]  I've talked to people who Tim and they approached before the bombing and they're
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:52.040]  like who is this Fed because he's just talking crazy talk about rising up
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:55.180]  against the government and bombing things people people who were smart and
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:58.680]  not federal informants were staying far away from him but he had the company of
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:03.520]  a lot of other federal informants Pat Kahn is is breaking now J.M. Berger of
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:08.000]  Intel wire put out an article that they believe is in foreign policy and it's on
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  Pat Kahn Patriot conspiracy and as one FBI agent said Pat Kahn will get you
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.240]  killed they do not want this exposed because they were not only infiltrating
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:21.160]  all of these so-called militia groups they were inciting them to crime they're
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.480]  being fed weapons from military bases those guys weren't stealing weapons from
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:29.280]  the military they're being fed weapons because one of the gun stores that we
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.960]  found out was involved with fast and furious just recently was involved in
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:36.200]  Pat Kahn back in the mid 90s it was an ATF operation they were in the same
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:41.560]  operation they're beating guns to these militias to manufacture a threat to
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:45.560]  start a fight so they could crack down on them now Newsweek was going to do an
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:49.720]  article several several months ago that was going to cover all the Pat Kahn
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:54.960]  information they the author of it called Jesse Trinadu read it word for word
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.960]  it covered all the information when it hits the newsstands every mention of
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:01.360]  Pat Kahn is completely removed we talked to that Newsweek writer we sent him
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.560]  copy the movie he asked for he liked it but he told us he can't cover it there's
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:11.280]  no way amazing gentlemen continue more with the Pat Kahn well Pat Kahn is
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:15.280]  breaking now that article came out yesterday on Intel wire by J.M. Berger
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:19.400]  he does a lot of good work and it talks about Andy Strasmeyer who we mentioned
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:23.600]  before who Jane Graham goes into at length on the Prison Planet dot TV
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:27.320]  interview Strasmeyer was down in Texas and we talked about in the movie the
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:31.080]  fact that Strasmeyer had to leave Texas and come to Oklahoma because he'd been
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:35.160]  followed by the Texas Light Infantry because a Strasmeyer was down there
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:39.160]  talking about blowing things up and and shooting people and you know that when
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:43.520]  people do that they're either morons or their federal informants either
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.320]  way you need to stay away from them so they became suspicious of him and they
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:50.040]  started following him they followed him into the Fort Worth federal building he
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:54.840]  went there at night after hours through a side door and used a key code to get
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:58.920]  into the door after that Strasmeyer was told to leave Texas and he did wisely and
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:02.040]  he came to Elm City and started scaring them telling them that they're gonna be
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:06.440]  the next Waco and started inciting them to commit some some type of crime and
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:11.360]  most of them were reluctant and in fact the only reason that Terry Nichols the
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:15.240]  only convicted accomplice to Tim and Bay the only reason I believe that Terry
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:19.680]  Nichols is in prison as the only accomplice is that Terry Nichols was
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:25.080]  the only person working with McVay who was not a government informant. Another
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:28.120]  piece of information that came out through Jesse Trindy was that the CIA
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:33.920]  actually had a satellite pointed at Elohim City the day of the bombing now
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.760]  back then it took you know weeks of coordination to move those satellites
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:41.040]  around why was it pointed there that morning? Elm City is a community of like
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:45.600]  100 maybe 200 in the 90s it's not very big there's no walls or anything just
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:50.760]  collection of housing and why did they have a satellite from the National Geospatial
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:54.400]  Intelligence Agency an agency we had never heard of until this document came
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.760]  out the CIA ordered them to point that satellite at Elohim City in eastern
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:03.120]  Oklahoma where McVay had been hanging out but yet they will not release any of
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:06.520]  that footage of course they cited national security reasons. Well it is
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:10.640]  national security for Goldman Sachs Bank of America JP Morgan Chase that have
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:14.840]  hijacked the country to stage stuff and blame it on real Americans it's very
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:20.080]  simple they commit crimes to then blame us here is a clip from last night's
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:23.560]  Hour Plus interview with Jane Graham she says it's the last interview she's
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:29.080]  doing talking about threats to witnesses again she worked in the Alfred P. Murrow
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:33.200]  building and she witnessed so much that's in the full interview but here is
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:38.400]  the threats to witnesses this is even more proof of the criminal elements at
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:44.160]  the top of the Justice Department FBI ATF running this operation with foreign
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:49.000]  nationals operation demonize American patriots that's basically what it is and
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.600]  here is a clip.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:43:00.880]  A friend of mine and also another person Debbie Nakanishi worked for the for the
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:07.320]  US post office she was intimidated she you know she saw what went on outside
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:15.120]  with the the bomb squad and everything and she was told by her employer that if
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:19.680]  she spoke about it or talked about what she saw she would be fired I told her
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:24.280]  immediately to go to the union they did she did and then they came in and then
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:27.760]  the boss came back and then an attorney came back from the telephone company
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.040]  said well you know post office you don't have to you know you're not gonna
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:39.280]  lose your job but many witnesses that saw the bomb squad across the street the
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.760]  courthouse prior to the bombing that morning and when she tries to speak out
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:51.560]  about it her job is threatened and still to be silent yes yes and and you know
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:58.640]  when I went Debbie Nakanishi and I went up to Washington several times we
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:05.840]  tried to get the politicians in Washington the senators and congressmen
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:12.040]  to talk to us about the bombing not one person there would talk to either one of
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:22.520]  us the only person who talked to us was the representative from Ohio and he
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:29.240]  subpoenaed trafficking he subpoenaed the records from GSA and when we went down
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:34.760]  there or we met when he was in office and his assistant and talked to him
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:39.920]  about you know what was going on and the assistant had told it very interesting
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:45.480]  that FBI had called and told him they wanted he could not open one of those
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:51.680]  boxes until they had sent people down there to redraft free to redact redact
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:55.680]  all the information and he said no he says that's beyond your authority I
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:04.360]  will allow one person to come down and do what they can do and that's it and he
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:09.120]  said the one and I believe I was a gentleman came down he was doing that
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:15.320]  and they were he was told we will get you for this and they did I mean they
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:20.320]  took him down with a scandal yeah they really did and it wasn't like he was
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:25.040]  the only person who's created a scandal my god look at the felons that are in
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:29.320]  Congress right now don't tell me about scandals you know look at what's going
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:32.920]  on right now in our government that's scandal so I mean he wasn't the only
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:36.920]  individual and I'm not saying it's a Democrat or Republican both have the
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:45.120]  problem but it is a real concern Charles Key you know he's had his share of
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:52.080]  problems Terrence shaky I met Terrence I knew him I knew his ex-wife when when
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:58.600]  he was having the problems when he was when he had reviewed his report and
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:03.120]  turned in his first report at the police department to his supervisor he was
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:07.200]  told to take it right back cut it down he didn't want all that information in
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:11.440]  there Terrence refused he rewrote it but he refused to do what he said he was
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:16.880]  taking a copy of that out he talked to his wife and told her he he was concerned
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:21.880]  for his life he was concerned for his family killing a lot of his ever protected
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:27.320]  families to children he had and they were supposed to leave then I believe
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:30.800]  the night that he was murdered they were supposed he was supposed to come back
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:35.720]  and take them down to Texas they were gonna I believe get remarried yeah I see
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:39.280]  he had the children yeah with the records out with his wife he had gotten a
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:42.960]  promotion he was getting the key to the city right he had everything to live for
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:47.920]  any and his death was declared a suicide now the the parameters around that is
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:53.080]  that he had supposedly cut his wrist in his car cut his neck and then I guess
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:57.760]  tied a rope around his neck handcuffed marks and dragged himself a mile away out
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:01.560]  to into a field and then shot himself with a small caliber weapon at a
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:05.480]  downward angle through the top of his head came out his jaw far enough away
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:10.640]  that I didn't leave powder residue on his head and then the sheriff's
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:14.720]  department when they do arrive they do a thorough search of the area they cannot
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:19.680]  find the weapon because it was federal property that when the FBI lands they
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:22.600]  they well here's the weapon they immediately go and find it the Sheriff's
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:26.000]  Department had also reported that there were two boxes of documents in the back
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.600]  of his car and then whenever it gets to the impound lot it's not actually part
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:37.920]  of the inventory well also he had left his video camera at his home and right
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:43.840]  after that the police department comes to her home
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:50.240]  Terry's wife's home and bursts in no knock no nothing just barges in goes
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:53.680]  directly where is the camera where is everything she said where's your war
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:57.320]  they went in they searched everything took everything that they wanted and
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:02.800]  walked out with it and that had a lot of evidence I'm sure on it yeah I mean
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:07.200]  it died with nothing they left him nothing they gave them nothing you know
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:11.280]  and they call this you know that he should have had been able to have a
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:16.440]  pension and do for that but they didn't even have the courtesy to call and do
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:20.320]  those things and every police officer that dies in Oklahoma City gets an
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:24.320]  autopsy turn shaky did not get one they didn't ask his family if he had ever
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:29.680]  had suicidal comments or thoughts and when they question the suicide they
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:33.480]  say oh you watch too much television you're acting crazy you need to go back
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:36.520]  home and stop worrying about it and this is not a way to treat a hero that
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:44.040]  saved eight people's lives that day well he also Terry also had Terry's wife
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:49.760]  said that he she had a call from one of the policemen that he worked with that
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:53.600]  he had talked to Terry the day before and he said the feds were after him he
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:49:01.960]  they were following him and he said I've been told that I cannot tell you that I
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:05.680]  know he was in fact murdered but then because they've already told us if any
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.880]  of us talk we're dead our families are dead that was not an uncommon thing to
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:15.920]  be intimidated by everybody down the line did you know Don Brownie I yes I knew
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:21.000]  him well and don knew don knew things that were going on you know and he you
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.200]  know he talked about him you know he would he would talk with VC you know he
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:28.920]  would meet with people he would talk to things you know talk to people about
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:34.840]  what was happening and but they didn't want they didn't want to hear it you
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:40.640]  know it's just like thank God that when Carol Howell went to before the court
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:46.960]  and her her supervisor you know they had made her out to be a liar and she was
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:51.960]  crazy and when then when her supervisor got on the stand and she's a you know
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:57.080]  she was under oh she said what she said was absolutely the truth surely more
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:03.400]  people out there have morals to stand up for what everybody in World War one and

[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.560]  wave them as a bloody shirt to destroy liberty in America and they've done a
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:39.160]  really good job now they're getting ready to shut down free speech and start

[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:02.920]  federal government enjoys that without truth there is no justice it says on
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:06.360]  the back info wars dot com I want to do another 20 minutes with you guys in the

[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:21.080]  us but other tidbits as we close out this hour that you think people should be
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:25.720]  made aware of well yes like I said the Oklahoma City story still developing
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:30.360]  there's a book coming out on the 24th of this month by Roger Charles for a former
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:33.760]  Marine Corps Colonel in Vietnam and actually it's kind of funny we call
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:36.560]  ourselves the Marine Mafia there's so many Marines involved with the true
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:41.440]  seeking efforts Don Browning Craig Roberts Jesse Trinity myself Matthews
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:47.640]  were anyways Roger Charles he's a former ABC producer he actually produced the
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:52.520]  2020 segment on prior knowledge that broadcast just a year and a half after
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:58.520]  the bombing improves so popular that he shot an entire hour show on prior
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:02.760]  knowledge and other evidence about Oklahoma City for 2020 shot produced he
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:06.760]  went home to go watch on TV he turned it on and they played a rerun he called his
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:10.360]  bosses at ABC like what's going on and they said well we got a series of phone
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:13.760]  calls from the Justice Department and they talked us into dropping the show
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:19.280]  and by the way that happened with Jesse Ventura's concentration camp show aired
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:24.560]  once supposed to air like 50 times on cable they pulled it and I mean the I
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:27.400]  can't talk about it because I'm sworn as you know secrets here let it I mean it
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:32.160]  was serious threats I mean that's who runs this government yeah Roger Charles
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:35.480]  became so enraged that he quit ABC and went to work or collaborating with the
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:38.440]  Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee chaired by State Representative Charles
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:41.880]  Key trying to get to the real truth of the bombing was come out with a book
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:45.480]  with a journalist Andrew Gumbel it comes out on the 24th of this month it's
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:49.080]  called Oklahoma City what the investigation missed and why it still
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:52.520]  matters now Roger Charles has a lot of connections to military intelligence
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:55.320]  he's former military intelligence a lot of connections in the government he
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:59.160]  knows a lot of these federal agents who are now retired he's talking to CIA
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:03.560]  agents who are now retired now they're not so afraid to talk anymore because
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:06.280]  they're not so concerned with their careers their pensions they already got
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:10.000]  all that they're not on the clock so there's gonna be some bombshells in that
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.280]  book including from what I told I can't reveal too much but confirmation that
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:19.000]  Andy Strasmeyer was working on an international intelligence operation in
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.360]  the beginning to infiltrate neo-nazis in this country that is being confirmed
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:26.240]  and it'll be detailed in the book coming out on the 24th. And Strasmeyer is the
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:30.200]  thread that really ties all of these different components together I mean he
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:33.920]  was seen with McVeigh at the Elated Godiva Strip Club and up in the Tulsa
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:38.600]  area we have Josiah Stone an Elohim City resident that says he saw McVeigh
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:42.280]  there at the time that Carol Howe was saying that Andy Strasmeyer was
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:47.680]  scouting locations in Oklahoma City for to do a bombing we know that that this
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:53.720]  character is the the one that was in the the basement Jane Graham has identified
[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:58.520]  him as the one with the wire and the gray putty which is exactly the way you
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:02.600]  set up C4. Then actually when we were actually briefing Jane Graham for the
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:05.600]  show yesterday we were going over things and she mentioned the make of the
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:09.920]  vehicle which was an older model station wagon with wood paneling and I was
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:13.720]  thunderstruck I was like that's that's Andy's car that's the car that was towed
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:16.960]  and the State Department called the tow driver and told him to release it. So this
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:20.440]  thing's still unraveling and then we're still finding new information. Un-
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:28.120]  believable and the people involved are still walking around out there and out of
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:32.480]  court will ever carry out justice but I just hope none of the people that killed
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:39.000]  those kids fall down and hit their heads. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:12.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:20.160]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:29.520]  Alex Jones. When the government fears the people there is liberty and the
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:33.240]  people fear the government there is tyranny and I can make jokes about
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:36.600]  child killers falling down in their heads. I know God's gonna bring these people
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:41.760]  to justice but by exposing these people we're gonna be able to stop their
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:47.600]  minions that were trained by them who were down in control to continue to be
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:50.640]  able to stage these and I think that's the most important point we started the
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:54.120]  interview with and before we go to calls I just want to make that point again.
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:58.880]  Exposing false flag and the fact that we have exposed them in the court of
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:02.960]  public opinion really is beginning to take that tool away from these guys.
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.360]  Absolutely I mean just the recent Supreme Court decision where they said
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:09.680]  they can strip search you for the most minor offense that one of the justices
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:13.240]  in their decision actually mentioned McVeigh being pulled over by you know
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:17.000]  after the bombing. Now so I mean that they still invoke the name of McVeigh
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.520]  anytime anybody has the audacity to stand up to tyranny to expose government
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:24.200]  corruption oh it's just one of those McVeigh types and this is why exposing
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:28.320]  the official story to be false about Oklahoma City it takes that power
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:32.000]  away from them. And it robs their loaded words of their value I mean they weigh
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.680]  the bloody shirt of Oklahoma City to the state to demonize anyone who dissents
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:39.280]  against the government who questions the constitutionality of the federal
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:43.160]  government and their actions especially with law enforcement and if we rob them
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:46.960]  of this and we make people aware of their false flag tool and how it works it
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:50.840]  loses its power because if we figured out it's not going to work anymore and I
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:55.280]  honestly think truly do that we are winning in the fact that we're
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:58.800]  discovering so fast and so hard I mean if they try to pull up Oklahoma City today
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:02.840]  I know it would blow up in their face it was entirely too sloppy and they can
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:06.480]  usually rely upon the major media to cover their loose ends because they're
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:10.520]  not going to press too hard but the major media doesn't it's not king anymore not
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:13.880]  at all I mean they're on the downhill slide and the alternative media is
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:16.480]  rising up and they're discovering things or spread things out if they tried
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:19.360]  something like that it would definitely blow up in their face and if they kill
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:23.840]  one of us there's a hundred more that pop up in its place that's what they
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:29.160]  really hate Robert in Oklahoma you're on the air welcome good afternoon Alex how
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:33.640]  are you doing doing all right hey I like to make a personal note that I know
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:40.680]  holland of ended noon half okay great the reason why I knew him for it because I
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:45.680]  used to work for a security office that supplies security for to control the
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:50.520]  building that his office is in and then we tell you something we talked to about
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:55.880]  10 minutes regarding what happened on Oklahoma City of April 19th 1995 and
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:03:00.760]  then we tell you something he is a treacherous of information I just want
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:06.800]  to say by the film research it and then ask questions what do you think of the
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:12.720]  film a noble terrorist attack launched by Loving Liberals I mean a noble lie
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:17.920]  the film I think it was a set up to see if it can be done on a larger scale
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:26.320]  resulting in 9-11 yep and if you killed I hate to say it but if you kill
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:32.960]  children you have to come back packing you up yep that's the way that's
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:37.600]  supposed to be real simple blow up a city next time there'll be God unless we
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:42.280]  expose the false flag we expose the false flag or they will blow stuff up and
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:49.600]  poses a savior it's a very old story I just like to ask both those guys a
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:54.760]  question if you may ask sure go ahead go ahead how would the federal government
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:04:02.040]  do this and why is there some sort of personal thing against us as citizens or
[02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:08.040]  are they have a hidden agenda that you know they know something that's coming
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:12.360]  up sometime in the near future that they're causing all this to happen yeah
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:15.640]  yeah well why did Hitler blow up his own capital building to take people's
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:19.640]  rights you guys want to start answering that I mean why they've won a stage it's
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:24.800]  an attack certainly I mean we saw all of the anti-terrorism legislation being
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:30.240]  opposed across the board in the United States there was a enormous resistance
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:34.280]  to globalization they have to get all of these operations and we're not gonna
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:37.960]  suspend the fourth amendment we're not gonna have federal police and so the
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:41.040]  Fed said we'll just blow up a federal building yep after that everybody just
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:45.040]  rolled over and said take our rights and it inaugurated us into the new age of
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:47.520]  terror there used to be a time in this country Alex we didn't have to worry
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:50.760]  about terrorism the younger generations don't you know what that's like stay
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:53.640]  there explain that on the other side thank you caller then we're gonna go to
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:59.120]  John Patriot Kevin Mark and others straight ahead it's 17 years after Bill
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:04.640]  Clinton's bombing a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:08.440]  why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:12.760]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:16.200]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:20.840]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:25.480]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:30.240]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:07.520]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:11.540]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:06:11.540 --> 02:06:15.440]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:19.440]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:24.000]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.800]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:35.440]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:39.800]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:42.960]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:41.760]  that is the foundation the root of the overthrow of our republic and a beta
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:47.120]  test for 9-11 all of the same to you now TSA all over the country on the
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:50.720]  streets and they're like we're here to fight crime we're here to hear what you
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:55.280]  have to say politically watch what you say we're gonna ship some guns to
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:59.920]  Mexico and to Honduras and to Chicago we're gonna bring some drugs in we're
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:05.240]  gonna have the troops grow the opium we're the good guys you know because of
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:09.240]  the internet alternative media now of course James Land the director joins us
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:14.080]  as well now they just are trying to hide stuff in plain view I mean more and
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:17.840]  more it comes out yeah we bring the drugs in yeah we murdered a lot of our
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:21.520]  troops in tests just a few years ago yeah foreign banks are setting up a
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:25.320]  world government so there's this weird thing where they admit it to take the
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:29.040]  power of the Nile away but then still separately say we're dangerous and bad
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:33.760]  for not liking it and we were just getting into the point that that well
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:36.040]  you're making a point hollering right before I went to break remember what
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:40.760]  that point was yes why why why why would they do the Oklahoma City bombing and
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:44.400]  we can look at the mundane reasons what we know for a fact is that Craig
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:47.400]  Roberts talk to talks about this in the movie that when he was retained by the
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:50.440]  FBI to investigate the bombing he was getting calls from federal agents in
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:54.400]  Arkansas telling him that when the Clintons went to DC to assume the
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:58.560]  presidency that all the files and all the documents related to whitewater were
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:02.240]  moved to get to the offer p more federal building in Oklahoma City and we know
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:05.480]  that the federal government was very concerned about those documents was who
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:08.640]  we have Don Browning another police officer talking about the fact that he
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:13.360]  was told by an FBI agent on the scene that there were documents so important
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:17.040]  to the government inside the building that until they were recovered there
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:22.280]  would be no further rescue and that's why FBI director's head assistant was
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:27.800]  there right after it magically blocking the fire department this is key the
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:31.720]  globalist always do things that are win win win win win they pick the target
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:35.720]  they have the files transferred there because back in the old days there was
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:38.680]  still some good people I guess in government so they had to you know hide
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:42.640]  those from then then they bomb them then they take them out we have the video the
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:46.680]  file cabinets being brought out while they block saving people screaming for
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:50.840]  help and we have rescue workers on film saying that they think that there was a
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:54.560]  lot of people that lost their lives because of the you know them stopping to
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:57.840]  get the document doctors were saying that and I've talked to rescue workers
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:01.800]  who said that FBI agents were stepping over wounded people bleeding people who
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:05.840]  needed help stepping over a wounded person to pick up a piece of paper and
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:09.800]  keep on walking they were they were literally more concerned with the paper
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:13.520]  now I'm not saying that's the precise reason the bombing happened that's one
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:16.440]  of the mundane reasons they actually that's one of the benefits they got I
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:20.560]  don't think that was the precise reason I think the deeper reason was that it did
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:26.720]  inaugurate this country into the age of terror I mean prior to 1995 terrorism or
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:30.520]  war was not a concern you went about your day and you were concerned about being
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:35.160]  bombed Oklahoma City started to plant that seed and people's now you got to
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:39.200]  have spies that grab your wife's breast and genitals because Alcatum I'd be
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:43.800]  hiding in there exactly and then the seed was planted and when 9-11 happened
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:47.200]  no one was surprised it was going to happen one day because of Oklahoma City
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:50.400]  even prior to Oklahoma City in 1993 you have the World Trade Center bombing in
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:54.440]  New York City with an ammonium bomb and a rider truck and an FBI handler who was
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:58.440]  running the whole operation that sounds kind of familiar and that failed they
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:00.760]  were supposed to park that truck next to the columns they were they were too
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:04.480]  dumb to even do that and so I mean they were they were really supposed to start
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:09.440]  get the get the ball rolling in 1993 and Oklahoma City itself was was a sloppy
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:12.520]  job when people say you know the government can ever pull off something
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:16.520]  as perfect as that people would talk people are talking people involved are
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:19.920]  talking and it was a screw-up there are bombs found inside the building I did
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:23.360]  not explode the whole building was supposed to come down there were they
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:26.840]  messed up on the cover-up left and right they had to kill people because of
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:30.200]  that I mean they messed up left and right it was a government operation it
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:34.680]  wasn't competent but they can rely upon the mainstream media to not pursue those
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:38.720]  leads I mean even to that to that end of the first hours after the event you
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:41.360]  know that's where you always get the the most truthful information where they're
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:43.560]  actually talking to people on the streets that saw what you know actually
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:49.280]  happened Channel 4 was the only station that continued to investigate the truth
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:53.360]  in this case so the New York Times bought them out exactly bought them out the
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:56.400]  program directors contractors are and she was fine the program director was
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:00.080]  fired Jane and Davis was like our contract is not renewed but yeah all
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:02.960]  let's go to more calls it's just incredible the film covers it all
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:08.360]  available at info wars.com a noble I must see because this needs to be on
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:11.760]  every access station show it at your church when your preacher gets up it
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:16.120]  says worship government say well okay but what about the corrupt people in top
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:19.760]  of government Jesus was speaking out against the bad government was they
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:23.760]  is out of the devil because I mean church is now it's just worship get ready
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:27.680]  to give your rights up you know God wants you to worship tyranny I mean it
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:30.800]  it's all homeland security run they're getting ready for some new big-stage
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:34.720]  terror they would have already staged more but we're exposing them let's go
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:39.880]  ahead and take another call here Kevin and Oregon you're on the air welcome
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:46.320]  hey that's good one of the things that was proof to me right off the bat is
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:51.760]  when they came out and said that the I used to work for Ford so the way that
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:57.360]  they somehow detected this Ford van was because of the tag on the differential
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:03.040]  and I can tell you this as fact that tag has nothing to do with any kind of ID
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:07.520]  numbers or anything like that strictly to do with gear ratios and things like
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:13.680]  that the same kind of stupid small mistakes were made in 9-11 you get you
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:18.200]  get these reporters kind of reporting from every little location during the
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:23.800]  day of 9-11 and the lady actually points the camera down at all the trucks
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:28.400]  parked there and said oh look the same people that did the that did the
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:34.520]  terrific implosion in Las Vegas so the casino are here to take care of building
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:41.120]  7 now I'm telling you this it's not some sir I didn't hang up on you it's not
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:45.320]  some guy that drives up in with a minivan with a box of dynamite in the
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:50.040]  back of his band you're talking about yeah let me stop you because I've I heard
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:53.400]  those types of things on the radio that day because in between watching TV and
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:57.680]  being on all the different Genesis shows you know I drove to get a pizza a half
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:01.080]  mile away I've told the story and heard CBS Radio back when they still had that
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:05.560]  announcing they're gonna blow up building 7 Solomon brothers for everyone's
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:10.400]  safety and of course we know controlled demolition ink that blew up the
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:13.920]  remains of Oklahoma City building they were involved in all that and I heard
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:16.800]  them blow it up and I got home and everybody's like yeah they said they
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:19.840]  blew it up but then they said that's a conspiracy theory you never heard that
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:22.880]  since then we found a lot of the newscasts where they did say they're
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:27.000]  gonna bring it down BBC screwed up and said it's already fallen and showed it
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.680]  and of course and they go wait it hasn't fallen but they go we'll go with the
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:33.920]  script so kind of like they were announcing that they'd found Lee
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:37.120]  Harvey Oswald before it even been arrested that was already being put out
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:41.080]  in the daily newspapers back in the day they had papers in big cities that you
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:45.440]  know came out every few hours you know extra extra exclusives that would come
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:50.720]  off the presses and so they screw up yeah they screw up in the scripting but I
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:56.320]  have not seen that footage are you saying did you see it that day or is it
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:59.640]  online because a lot of people call in and they we go find these bomb shells
[02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:02.920]  that no one's paid attention to you're saying there's footage because we got
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:05.920]  cops saying get back they're gonna blow up building seven and then they blow it
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:11.680]  up but are you telling me that you've got footage of them saying oh there's
[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:16.440]  the there's the control demolition Inc. they're here to help with building seven
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:22.160]  blow it up are you saying you you have that clip CNN that they shot this and I
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:25.280]  wish I did have the clip I've tried to find it but I can't because they've
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:28.920]  buried that thing so deep no I know there's some there's actually dozens of
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:32.160]  them so we already have them saying similar things and then the debunkers
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:36.240]  get my face on the streets and they go you're saying the cops blew it up and I
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:39.960]  go no they told the cops who I've interviewed by the way the officers who
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:43.680]  are also on the news we've actually had a chance to run into them and find them
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:47.040]  they told them okay they're gonna blow it up it was on the news they said for
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:51.200]  its safety they had a countdown they blew up building seven then they didn't
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:54.880]  want that investigated so they said never happened and you're supposed to just
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:59.320]  say okay never happened because the it's amazing the level of mind control
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:04.800]  Holland yes the caller is right about the writer truck and the number on that
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:08.640]  then that was bandied about with the media as the you know the me the FBI was
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:12.520]  so good that they tracked down this part this vehicle identification number on
[02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:16.520]  the axle and have identified this writer truck tied to this right on 18 Kansas but
[02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:20.600]  that's like passports falling out of the sky that survive on 9-11 he found that
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:24.720]  day we're gonna talk to Ford about this the representative and he he chuckled
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:27.520]  he looked at as he that that's a part number there's nothing to do with
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:32.520]  identifying the truck you cannot track the truck through a part number and so I
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:37.080]  mean the the first clue that they used to justify their whole arrest and tracking
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:41.640]  down to McVay is false it's not really false from the horse's mouth so it's
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:46.080]  just like the magic passports of 9-11 exactly and you know you talk about them
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:50.040]  talking about bringing the building down in 9-11 we've got probably three to four
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:54.640]  minutes 20 plus people saying second bomb we've got that we see the bomb squad
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:59.480]  down at the Oklahoma City but you know at the Murrow building we see people in
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:02.920]  the military saying that the second bomb that was disarmed the night before
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:08.000]  was even bigger the Air Force was stating that even a day after the bombing
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:11.480]  they're they're represented with you have the governor saying they found more
[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:14.680]  bombs yeah and now we're supposed to just act like that didn't exist you know
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:19.520]  you know shut up conspiracy theorists right no it's on all the channels BBC
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:24.400]  simultaneously on two channels says it's falling on its own footprint as it
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:29.560]  later did perfectly from small fires and then on 9-11 they've got all these
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:33.080]  guys they're definitely operatives baseball caps on coming on the news
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:37.240]  within minutes of the towers falling and giving the official story of jet fuel
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:41.120]  pancaking caused the steel to melt and weaken and so it fell into its own
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:45.360]  footprint cut to the next channel another guy you know just just scripting
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:50.320]  boom you've got the terrorists right there right there is a script like like
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:54.160]  with Oklahoma City on the day of the bombing that afternoon the ATF is
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:57.960]  announcing that it was a car bomb with 1200 pounds of explosives it's like where
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:01.040]  did you come up with that number man I mean how would you even hazard a guest
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:05.320]  as to how many pounds the bomb weighed you don't even know what it is turns out
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:10.360]  later that the ATF was keeping 1200 pounds according to a rescue worker he
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:14.040]  actually told the rescue worker that they were keeping 1200 pounds of C4 in
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:17.480]  their illegal armory in the Murrow building they were hoping it would blow
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:20.720]  up it didn't because the other bombs didn't go off so they had to pull it
[02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:25.160]  out but they actually got the number for the script 1200 pounds from the
[02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:28.560]  amount of C4 they were keeping in their own armory illegally well they were
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:32.880]  keeping the stuff there that they use the extra to blow it up yeah it doesn't
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:35.800]  exist and we've got footage in the documentary a noble I showing them
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:40.320]  actually removing the C4 and weapons and you got Jane Graham sees these guys in
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:46.960]  there you know whistling putting the gray sticks of butter with the wires these

[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:05.320]  coming up a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why

[02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:13.120]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:16.560]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:21.080]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace

[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:02.280]  do you guys ever get threats what type of stuff's happened to you making this
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:08.840]  film well I mean nothing majorly overt I think no one thought we'd get the movie
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:13.120]  done so we weren't seen as a threat there have been attempts in the past to
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:17.240]  infiltrate our efforts and they've been foiled rather easily but the making of
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:21.520]  the movie itself I mean doing that I mean we weren't dealing with over threats
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:24.960]  but I mean there was a couple times we risked our lives just interviewing some
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:28.200]  of these neo-nazi suspects going out into the desert to Utah or the wilds of
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:31.000]  eastern Oklahoma you know who you're gonna run into and some of these guys
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.760]  were involved with the bombing even if they were federal informants or not and
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:39.840]  they definitely have something to hide so I mean but we felt compelled to do
[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:44.440]  what we could to get the story out there and we're from Oklahoma Rokies and we
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:49.080]  filmed it Oklahoma shot in Oklahoma and we knew the story had to be told me
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:52.880]  these people survivors victims family members have become friends of ours and
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:57.520]  their story needed to be told he's being ignored by the mainstream media like our
[02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:02.360]  director photography Devin Winter he'd interviewed some of our subjects already
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:08.000]  three or four times for history channel for Nat Geo for other mainstream video
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:13.080]  channels or TV channels and they told the same story each time but with us we
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:16.720]  didn't take everything that that would win contrary the official story and
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:20.400]  leave it on the cutting room floor we actually that was the purpose of the
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:24.440]  interview to show what was contrary to the official story and they have never
[02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:27.720]  changed their story the feds changed their story left and right there's not
[02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:31.360]  even one official story for the Oklahoma City bombing there's like nine or six
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:34.480]  different possible I want to be clear these aren't even feds these are
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:37.920]  criminals that have taken the federal government over yeah I mean we've reached
[02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:40.880]  a period of history I think that we this called the criminalization of the
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:44.120]  state where criminals basically have achieved positions of power and they
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:47.160]  point the gun to the state at their enemies at their political enemies and
[02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:51.400]  they call them criminals we have reached that stage and when we had to deal with
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:55.200]  as much as we can with the realize that not have false hope deal with the system
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:58.880]  when we came here a marine it doesn't feel good to actually be fighting for
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:03.040]  American now against the real enemy I mean this is a real war yeah I mean I
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:06.920]  joined the Marine Corps out of out of an instinct to protect my family and my
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:12.760]  land and for craving for a rite of passage and to and to seek adventure
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:16.600]  just I had a lot of testosterone I didn't want a job so I joined the Marine
[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:20.640]  Corps plus as a family tradition and I quickly saw that there were things in
[02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:23.600]  there I didn't like I mean when I took the oath in the beginning at at the
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:27.080]  MEP station to defend the Constitution gets all in these four domestic I was
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:30.400]  the only one in the room yelling at that part of the oath I took it seriously I
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:34.160]  did my four years I realized I can't work for Sam anymore and I got out and I
[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:37.840]  can sort of this a more noble fight than I was doing in this is the fight this is

[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:21.600]  Reserve and I was thinking about the metaphor of the Federal Reserve actually
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:25.720]  being the reserve actually being a ticket counter that they've created and
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:30.240]  your money is nothing but a ticket to their reality and they can print up as
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:35.640]  many tickets as they want and then I look you know eighties yeah these guys are
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:38.920]  following so right when you pull out of your street boom they're on you and then
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:42.320]  we're gonna see where you live but I mean it's like 15 20 turns yeah I mean
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:46.080]  they're here they follow you 15 miles sure I mean you know and then you get to
[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:51.200]  the office and they turn off yep just wanting you to know yeah just trying to
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:54.160]  intimidate me you know what's great about my wife they call him go we're gonna
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:57.600]  cut your head off and and I see a little dog in the back yeah I'm watching you
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:00.800]  right now and she's like you cowardly piece of crap I got a shotgun right here
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:04.200]  you came in the fact that only gets her more excited you know she doesn't care
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:08.480]  it's not coward like you yeah piece of trash well they're they're sweating
[02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:11.800]  bullets are calling I'm going now your dad's in the hospital we love it I was
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:14.600]  just listening to you talk to your husband I mean that that's who these
[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:18.560]  people are these idiot the idiot public has not been involved in this they
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:22.680]  don't know they don't understand they're gonna understand oh you're gonna
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:25.760]  understand folks cuz they're they're coming to me it's gonna get bad it's
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:30.120]  becoming a larger and larger reality definitely but it's our reality and
[02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:34.640]  it's just a little reminder but I'm not afraid of you I've already died twice
[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:41.400]  and I got nothing to lose except this country and my family's security in
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:45.400]  future so whatever go ahead and follow me all you want but it's not even about
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:49.520]  that it's that commitment to defeating evil it isn't I mean with me it's it's
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:52.320]  like I love my family more than anything but if something happens to them that's
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:55.800]  just the way it is it's just like I'm all in baby yeah I mean they just don't
[02:38:55.800 --> 02:39:00.320]  you get it I'm we're the opposite of you we're the opposite I mean imagine the
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:04.560]  Secret Service they already had the hookers pre-purchased I mean I just
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:07.400]  can't imagine if I went to some place that had time off I don't want to go see
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:12.240]  the sights or or ancient archaeological digs or I want to go see some mountain
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:15.880]  lake or something or a or an active volcano you know that's all down there
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:19.960]  instead they want to that's like wanting to go lick toilet bowls or something to
[02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:23.160]  be with a bunch of hookers that like 20 people a day are having sex with that's
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:27.120]  what the Secret Service is but they're not even corrupt compared to their bosses
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:30.920]  that like to shotgun kids and they had for fun right I mean you know that's what
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:34.480]  that we're run by these people well in the Secret Service we like to think
[02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:38.600]  they're squeaky clean but you go back to JFK you know they're hooking JFK up and
[02:39:38.600 --> 02:39:42.960]  who knows it's all complete farce that's the thing about evil people though
[02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:48.160]  they're all dysfunctional malfunctioning idiots this is true I mean I was
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:51.480]  reading where the feds most of them don't even pay taxes it's just this is I
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:55.920]  mean they're just a wall to wall look at Nancy Pelosi look at Obama these are
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:59.800]  sacks of crud I mean I remember Jay Rockefeller when Luke Radowski's
[02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:02.720]  following him in the halls of the Senate going yeah your family fun of the
[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:06.280]  Nazis they find the eugenics and he looks at me he goes you got a lot of you
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:09.800]  know what it's ought to give you a job but that was the only he actually looked
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:13.200]  at him with respect because this is a killer you know he's walking around like
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:18.120]  six foot six and he just looks over to look as I before he goes like I got one
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:22.320]  that could see it's like sorons are to give you a job what one that actually
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:28.320]  knows what I am or the dragons you know it's it's just like you know yeah it's
[02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:33.440]  well and the thing is is they they've they're under the impression from the
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:37.800]  50s and the 40s and before that we're on that people are unaware I think they
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:44.720]  still got a block in their minds that there aren't 20 million people week in
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:48.680]  week out listening to this that are completely well it's like 15 million a
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:51.520]  week with us but with other stuff it's like hundreds of millions I mean yeah
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:55.760]  what do people are buying five million guns a month to play deadly winks with
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:01.480]  them no they say I don't trust the government well I just want to remind
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:05.880]  everybody to impeach Obama yeah we do have in there like well what the others
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:09.720]  were corrupt yeah we tried to impeach them no we're in bad shape we don't
[02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:15.920]  impeach Obama right now we this needs to happen this needs to happen you I mean
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:19.200]  you know these crooks are scared we're on there talking about them sure they're
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:23.280]  driving around in their fancy cars that we paid for trying to intimidate you
[02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:26.600]  because they think you're like them John yeah yeah and they're like we'll get
[02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:29.600]  you one day strapped down towards ringing of Jones we'll break you so what
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:33.960]  you break me I've already fired all my weapons in the info ward at you don't you
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:41.160]  get it I win I've won I declare victory haha I declare victory John do you want
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:45.120]  some kind of battle cry or no I mean it was just we're declaring victory over
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:48.000]  the New World Order we declare victory in the name of Jesus Christ over the
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:52.360]  devil and all his servants then I declare victory over the New World New
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:58.800]  World Order and the devil in the name of Jesus Christ and I want you folks to
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:03.960]  know that you've lost that's right you've lost you lost you're losing your
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:09.000]  overreaching you're getting desperate you've lost and just like the Alamo
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.480]  some of us won't make it through this but it'll be the spark for the big event
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:15.560]  that's what this is all about okay guys I've been ranting I want to go to calls
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:20.760]  hearing thank you John hearing John tell that story right there because I could
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:23.120]  tell he was angry all morning and I usually you know I was asking what's
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:26.800]  wrong he told me the story what do you make of that I mean that's nothing
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:29.640]  compared to me being physically attacked the death threats all of it but I mean
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:33.560]  it just shows they're testing John to see if they can really terrorize him and
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:37.400]  his family it's about intimidation you know we've had Chris Emery has been
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:41.560]  followed what a private investigator that was working on the Terence Yakey
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:45.520]  story was followed and he may actually manage to get the license plate number
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:49.640]  there was an associate of ours that actually ran that and said it came back
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:53.240]  as a non-existent they said that's typically only a government vehicle that
[02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:56.360]  happens out of a lot of the vehicles that come in and out of the memorial there's
[02:42:56.360 --> 02:42:59.680]  also an intelligence unit being run out of the Memorial downtown in Oklahoma City
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:04.120]  the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism and we've had people
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:07.400]  run plates on those cars and they and they they're not existing either so I
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:10.880]  mean there there's a lot of spooks in this town and they and they've tried to
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:16.920]  intimidate us but frankly they you better watch out if you try something like
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:22.680]  that on me because I and yeah I know back down and yeah try well you don't
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:25.880]  want to end up like Terence Yakey that's a lesson to everybody he figured it out
[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:29.000]  and started fighting but you know that that's the thing about the feds need to
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:32.800]  listen the feds need to get this when they start secretly arresting and
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:36.520]  killing people folks aren't just gonna start going with somebody when they get
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:40.680]  pulled over and police and and others need to understand that this is gonna
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:45.480]  cause a fight you can't win you need to join the American people right now go
[02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:49.960]  ahead I'm sorry Terence Yakey was probably killed because he was keeping
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:54.120]  his mouth shut so what Jesse trying to do told us you never keep a secret you
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:56.920]  always get it out there as soon as possible then that way they have no
[02:43:56.920 --> 02:44:00.120]  reason to kill you it's already out there that's why we announced the
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:03.320]  documentary when we came to do your interview with you Alex that was the
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:06.360]  first interview that we shot for the documentary and we came out on your
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:09.120]  show saying that we are doing the documentary that way everybody knows
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:12.120]  there's no question about it and at best all they can try to do it I think at
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:14.480]  that point is to intimidate you because we have too large of a network of
[02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:18.240]  activists that know what's going on that's what Jim Garrison said Jim Garrison
[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:22.040]  said you've got to be public and he's the same stuff calling up his kids and
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:25.520]  his wife and women saying he was cheating on them it's a standard playbook
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:29.600]  and that's when you know just like my grandpa you know flying around to be
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:34.480]  17 when you go over the enemy that's when you get the flak that is a good sign
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:39.480]  and that's where we don't stand or we don't cave to the intimidation you know
[02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:44.120]  I ask myself every day what what can I do today to expand or preserve individual
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:47.920]  liberty as long as I'm doing that then I'm staying focused and there's a lot of
[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:50.800]  blowback when they do stuff like this they regret to this day killing Kenny
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:55.280]  Trintedew because because of that Jesse has pursued them in court and row rubbed
[02:44:55.280 --> 02:45:00.560]  the FBI's nose and in their own a waste ever since with their own poor excuses
[02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:04.600]  they were correct and they will root to their dying day that they decided to
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:08.600]  kill Kenny Trintedew because of Jesse so I mean they may kill some of us but
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:11.960]  believe me we're coming back and we learned from Kara Yakey you're not
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:16.320]  doing that again you're not getting away with that again well well said
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:21.200]  gentlemen well said there it's just you know in most these idiots they're
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:26.040]  trying to intimidate people that I mean the order goes out try to intimidate
[02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:30.240]  people it's probably the local Austin FBI there they're mad that through an
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:33.400]  intermediary they told me to be nice and I wasn't even talking about the FBI so
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:37.160]  now I talk about them every day I mean I just don't get what world do they want
[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:41.600]  their children growing up in a country like this is what I want to know now
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:44.720]  that they're they're power hungry I mean that's the they're they're complete
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:49.000]  obsessed with their own ego and in power that's what strikes me is like I want to
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.920]  ask you like what do you think you're doing do you I mean do you honestly
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:55.320]  think you're on the good side I mean look at what you're doing these are
[02:45:55.320 --> 02:45:59.000]  citizens who are making inquiries and then going on the internet and writing
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:02.960]  articles and whatever I mean they're not criminals why I mean where are you
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:06.320]  coming from with this I mean I really want to know the answer to that well
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:10.400]  they're criminals or they've gotten hyped up in the process to joining it and
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:14.720]  ask yourself look what look the line you've crossed because this is like you
[02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:18.200]  go over a line and it's incremental you go over this line you fall into the
[02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:23.960]  deep end I mean you're you're falling in with some really bad people I mean
[02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:26.840]  most people was just pretty much do what they're told and especially in a
[02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:30.280]  paramilitary organization the police or whatever and an extraordinary circumstance
[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:33.840]  you kind of just do what you're told and keep your mouth shut but I mean under
[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:37.040]  circumstances like this when you're being told ordered to intimidate and follow
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:42.400]  people who are not criminals not engaging criminal activity and you know
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:47.120]  advisedly they're telling people not to be criminals so you're actively violating
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:50.920]  your oath you're actively violating the Constitution you're actively violating
[02:46:50.920 --> 02:46:55.600]  the integrity that the people expect you to uphold as a police officer as a law
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:46:58.560]  enforcement officer because I'm not against police officers I mean you know
[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:02.960]  what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go over to the FBI garage it might have been ATF or
[02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:07.400]  somebody else but I know the ATF's up in North Austin under the FBI's main I'm
[02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:12.200]  gonna go I'm gonna take John up to find their garage and find that vehicle and
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:15.720]  then we're gonna go and knock on the door I think that's the answer here start
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:18.880]  following them around yeah we've thought about going to the local fusion
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:21.960]  center here in Oklahoma City since they've named us as a domestic terrorist
[02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:24.840]  threat and they have a sit-down with them and ask them oh that's right you got
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:28.880]  put on one little secret list as terrorist yeah yeah so we want to ask
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:32.160]  him with that what the criteria is and and what we actually I mean it's we
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:35.360]  didn't do anything what can we get away with now that we're already terrorists
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:39.200]  yeah I mean what for a website that was actually for the Oklahoma bombing
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:42.960]  investigation committee that was a state representative they they listed them as
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:47.080]  terrorists yeah survivor a man who was three foot away from where the floor
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:52.000]  dropped off lost dozens of his friends and they labeled him a terrorist VZ
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:55.640]  Lawton who's a pillar of this community because they are terrorists they I mean
[02:47:55.640 --> 02:47:59.600]  look to a terrorist good guys are terrorist yeah exactly the criminal
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:03.240]  it's like it's like the pigs that have the demons in them or whatever or or the
[02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:07.200]  you know the the homeless guys that have the demons in them and Christ is there
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:11.480]  and they're rolling around just in the ground pleading I mean imagine how
[02:48:11.480 --> 02:48:17.040]  horrible we are to them go ahead well as I say the bravery of the survivors that

[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:29.880]  this message as much as possible I'm part of one of the few people in this
[02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:33.240]  state that actually called the representatives on a weekly basis to
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:37.800]  let them know I know what you're up to Mr. Conway represents my district Kate
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:41.760]  Bailey Hutchison represents my district and I know what they're up to I've gone
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:46.200]  to debate Conway and he lied to the whole public he led to everybody in that
[02:49:46.200 --> 02:49:49.200]  room he had him filling out a questionnaire when I walked in I was a
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:52.200]  couple minutes late he had him filling out a question there for him and then he
[02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:56.440]  was a they were he was asking the crowd questions and they were answering his
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:49:59.880]  questions and as soon as I saw this I said well look at these sheep just lined
[02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:04.280]  up for the slaughter they came and they just lied be lined right up to be lied
[02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:08.400]  to and wouldn't accept that the truth the man talked about Constitution left and
[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:12.080]  right until I brought up the fact that I studied his very understanding you have
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:15.160]  any questions for our guests we're taking calls in Oklahoma City
[02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:18.560]  question sir yes I'm sorry I got subject care I'm I knew Timothy McBay
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:22.360]  Timothy McBay was a customer my father my stepfather's done shop in Arizona I
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:25.000]  was just a small boy I've been listening to you ever since you've been on the
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:30.360]  air the gentleman talked about McBay being thought of as a fed by the people
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:34.360]  he talked to because he was so he was just so adamant about about what he was
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:37.640]  preaching to people and wanted to get everybody tuned on and tuned in and
[02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:43.800]  turned on and tuned and turned on him exactly what we're all doing right
[02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:48.200]  now and I see that as not being a bad thing about the guy I've been going
[02:50:48.200 --> 02:50:51.760]  back and looking at the ABC interviews with him you know the one clip that
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:55.240]  they will show you of the guy you know what that's not the same guy I knew as
[02:50:55.240 --> 02:50:58.400]  a kid that's not the same guy that inspired me to join the United States
[02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:02.520]  Army well that is true they do create body doubles I've seen the ungevity
[02:51:02.520 --> 02:51:06.120]  products work for many others and so I bought a bunch of them started using them
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:10.280]  had a little bit of results but I wasn't following the regimen every day but
[02:51:10.280 --> 02:51:15.160]  Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds when I saw those
[02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:19.280]  results I said I better follow my own advice I started taking the ungevity

[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:57.440]  for what's right every freedom we've got was hard one we're talking to this
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:01.000]  gentleman earlier calling the city of McVay a lot of people say that's not
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:04.800]  McVay or they say it looked like he was drugged out of his mind we know he was
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:09.440]  sheep dipped out of the military that's a classic black ops situation the
[02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:14.040]  Holland what's your take on that well the caller I guess was referring to the
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:17.720]  fact that he knew McVay as a child and he kind of looked up to McVay well I'm
[02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:20.600]  not saying that McVay was going around to every person he met in his life and
[02:55:20.600 --> 02:55:23.360]  advocating overthrowing the government but he was and I know this for a fact
[02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:27.000]  because I've talked to people he was talking to he was going up to known
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:32.480]  figures in the neo-nazi and far-right movement and preaching insurrection and
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:36.760]  violence to the fact that the word got around to stay away from this Tim Tuttle
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:40.680]  guy who's going by the name Tim Tuttle back then and in fact McVay was
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:44.560]  actually operating with other known informants there was there was an
[02:55:44.560 --> 02:55:51.080]  ATF informant in late actually early 90 early 1995 right before the bombing trying
[02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:57.000]  to get people involved in a plot to bomb a rider truck with info a federal
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  building exact same script that played out in Oklahoma City let's bomb a federal
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:04.400]  building with a writer truck yeah they were trying forever but they couldn't
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:07.560]  set anybody up so they had to do it themselves people were saying no left
[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:10.360]  to right they wanted nothing to do with this guy I talked to my witness Johnny
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:14.040]  Banger and we confirmed this through the Las Vegas Review Journal this ATF
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:17.480]  informant disappeared after the bombing and they didn't know where he went they
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:20.240]  knew he was informed because he was always preaching this stuff and he's
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:22.960]  always paying for everything that's how they kind of know that you're an
[02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:25.120]  informant you're always paying for everything and you're always talking
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:29.320]  about committing felonies and he disappeared and then they get a letter
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:32.760]  from him and it's from a jail and it's like hey Johnny I'm sorry that I was
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:37.000]  trying to get you involved in that plot the ATF pinched me on automatic weapons
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:42.160]  charges and they wanted me to get you in on this this bombing plot and because I
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:46.360]  wasn't able to I'm back in jail but this proves that the ATF was shopping a
[02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:51.640]  script around with 8 to with a writer truck federal building and foe and we
[02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:57.400]  saw it play out a couple months later in Oklahoma City but if you're a good
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:57:00.600]  patriotic American Holland you're supposed to just go along with the
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:07.480]  official story well it depends on your definition of good patriotic American
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:14.560]  and I do not think that buying a lie and obedience is the highest goal I believe
[02:57:14.560 --> 02:57:18.720]  freedom and individual liberty and our rights are a higher goal to go to than
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:23.880]  just mere obedience an animal can obey oh I think I like Goldman Sachs and JP
[02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:26.240]  Morgan kidnapping the country and destroying the Bill of Rights the
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:29.840]  Constitution I mean I think it's great they admit they kidnapped and torture
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:33.920]  people and are surveilling everybody without warrants I think this is
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:37.560]  wonderful I mean this is freedom man this is what's you're an extremist so is
[02:57:37.560 --> 02:57:42.440]  James there of course I'm being sarcastic folks a noble lie available at
[02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:46.400]  info wars.com I can only do a little bit of overdrive here we're gonna go to
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:52.840]  break and go to a mark listing on KL MY 13 40 a.m. and then jam and John I'll

[02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:16.480]  the hour but at the next step is we know what they're not going to blow up
[02:58:16.480 --> 02:58:19.800]  more buildings or run airplanes into buildings and that one's got to be a
[02:58:19.800 --> 02:58:26.640]  biggie and Alex I think this explains why we have all the 40 millimeter ammo the
[02:58:26.640 --> 02:58:32.160]  bulletproof check point boxes tail box so forth is that the next thing is gonna
[02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:35.800]  be this bird flu bird flu virus I agree with you they're gonna release a bio
[02:58:35.800 --> 02:58:39.720]  weapon and they could stay there we'll be right back
[02:58:41.960 --> 02:58:50.640]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today
[02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:54.880]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[02:58:54.880 --> 02:58:58.600]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you
[02:58:58.600 --> 02:59:02.160]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[02:59:02.160 --> 02:59:05.920]  silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in
[02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:09.800]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and
[02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:14.240]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they
[02:59:14.240 --> 02:59:19.280]  call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[02:59:19.280 --> 02:59:23.000]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:26.800]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[02:59:26.800 --> 02:59:31.800]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[02:59:31.800 --> 02:59:42.920]  that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365
[02:59:42.920 --> 02:59:48.240]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[02:59:48.240 --> 02:59:54.960]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com coast-to-coast direct from Austin
[02:59:54.960 --> 03:00:00.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:05.520 --> 03:00:09.400]  all right John and Alabama finish your point then I'll get their take on it
[03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:13.400]  but yeah the bio attack is one of the perfect ways for them to come in and
[03:00:13.400 --> 03:00:18.760]  really take over and they're gearing up for martial law admittedly lockdowns
[03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:23.080]  total control and I think that's one of the most deadly cards they've got and
[03:00:23.080 --> 03:00:27.040]  they've got five or six cards in their hand and that's the race in the hole and
[03:00:27.040 --> 03:00:31.960]  everything I'm seeing tells me that's one of the prime cards they may play but
[03:00:31.960 --> 03:00:36.280]  if they don't think they can control people and have us all just go off and
[03:00:36.280 --> 03:00:42.160]  down our houses like they want they may not play it anything else yes sir we
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:46.120]  know that that would terrorize every person in the nation no matter where
[03:00:46.120 --> 03:00:48.940]  they live I live in the country so I'm not worried about tall buildings
[03:00:48.940 --> 03:00:53.840]  thought on me but that would would terrorize every individual so that would
[03:00:53.840 --> 03:00:58.720]  work anywhere and they've got the technology that may even have a vaccine
[03:00:58.720 --> 03:01:03.080]  antidote that the elite get or whoever you know and we're just that fits with
[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:06.800]  the FEMA camps you know if you're a zombie you might be infected with this
[03:01:06.800 --> 03:01:12.160]  stuff lock them up you are shooting me this and that's what their whole giant
[03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:15.640]  preparations for God bless you good points gentlemen quick comments on that
[03:01:15.640 --> 03:01:21.080]  well they definitely have to take it to the next level I mean the WTC 93 was a
[03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:26.400]  very small truck bomb Oklahoma City was larger 9-11 of course is what it is and
[03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:30.320]  they have to ratchet up the consequences and the effect because it's not kind of
[03:01:30.320 --> 03:01:33.320]  same psychological value if they just pull off another truck bomb that only
[03:01:33.320 --> 03:01:35.760]  kills a hundred people that's not gonna that's not gonna do anything they've
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:39.120]  already taken it to the level they've got to take it to the next level for the
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:41.480]  next attack and we look at the predictive programming that's coming out
[03:01:41.480 --> 03:01:46.400]  through the popular culture and it's all biological you know martial laws
[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:51.760]  required some sort of a nuke attack again martial laws required it's always the
[03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:56.040]  the solution is to accept for you know government control troops on the
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:02:00.880]  streets and in the conditioning to force to accept that and you know the
[03:02:00.880 --> 03:02:04.120]  emergency so bad we've got to arrest people that are saying the government
[03:02:04.120 --> 03:02:07.040]  did it because they're openly getting everybody ready for that well if they
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:10.560]  nuke a city if they dirty nuke a city or put a nuke in the city you'll have
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:16.520]  people screaming blood demanding that Americans be rounded up under NDAA under
[03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:20.280]  mere suspicion and put in camps I mean a president who wouldn't force that would
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:24.280]  be chased out of office it would be a very scary time in this game and when
[03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:28.160]  that happens it's time to spray paint everywhere the government did it that's
[03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:31.600]  a black off we can run against their black off and by black off that's something
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:35.360]  you do and don't you know talk about and we and but you know the thing is we've
[03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:39.880]  got to get it out now right now aggressively that the terrorists run
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:43.960]  the country I'm risking my life to do this so are you and it's just may day get
[03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:48.560]  it out may day get it out may day may day may day trying to stop them from
[03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:52.680]  launching the next one but if they do hit them hit them hard with the info they
[03:02:52.680 --> 03:02:57.080]  did it they stand again they did the last stuff they're the prime suspects may
[03:02:57.080 --> 03:03:03.440]  day may day may day you talked about you know the the biological and stuff we
[03:03:03.440 --> 03:03:07.800]  actually looked into the Oklahoma State Department of Health and through the
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:13.320]  administrative rules here an unelected official can have you or your family or
[03:03:13.320 --> 03:03:17.760]  children rounded up and forcibly vaccinated against your will you know
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:22.640]  well you know we were looking into I was in a camp female William Lewis's movies
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:25.800]  and we actually take him to the lucent building out here and the health
[03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:28.760]  department said that is where they will take people in a mass quarantine
