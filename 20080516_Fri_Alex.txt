[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:15.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:19.000 --> 00:25.000]  It is Friday. Very important broadcast lined up for you today on this 16th day of May,
[00:25.000 --> 00:33.000]  2008 live for the next four hours. Aaron Zelman, head of Jews, the preservation of firearms ownership
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  will be joining us to talk about all of the massive gun control attacks at the state, local, federal level
[00:39.000 --> 00:45.000]  that are taking place. And to go back to the historic example of citizens standing up to tyranny,
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  and that was the Battle of Athens that happened when a bunch of World War II vets got tired of a
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.000]  boss hog-type police department in Tennessee and took over. Celica Still will be popping in.
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  Former DEA agent, former, of course, sheriff's deputy. Before that, Army Sniper in Vietnam,
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  highly decorated. He'll be joining us to talk about the Houston Chronicles headline that U.S.
[01:10.000 --> 01:20.000]  trained Mexican troops are attacking the U.S. Now, Selie told you this three years ago here on air.
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  And he said federal prosecutors tell him to his face, we're going to get you for this. And they did set him up,
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  and he is facing prison time. But we wrote articles at prisonplanet.com and infowars.net. I looked it up last
[01:31.000 --> 01:41.000]  night. Three years ago, three years ago, Celica Stillo told you this on air. He told you on this show
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.000]  four years ago they were using Latin American death squads, tens of thousands of them in Iraq carry out
[01:48.000 --> 01:56.000]  extermination ops against Iraqis. The Army that will take you to FEMA camps, that will break you
[01:56.000 --> 02:03.000]  and your family up, is going to be largely Latin American. Now, it's in the Houston Chronicle yesterday.
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  I saw it last night. My mouth just hung open that, oh, yeah, the U.S. trained these people,
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  but they're claiming, oh, they got away from them. When you hear about Bush wanting to give $146 billion
[02:13.000 --> 02:19.000]  to the, quote, Mexican government to fight drugs and terror, that means to expand the Cadres.
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  So that's the hitman they use. And they're broken up in sectors. They got Mexican hit teams from
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.000]  Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, right down into Texas. That's the main
[02:30.000 --> 02:37.000]  operation zone. And Mexican troops are not just killing other drug dealers that don't pay the cut into
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  the government, into the U.S. government, into the CIA. They're now killing political dissidents,
[02:42.000 --> 02:50.000]  newspaper reporters, and others. By the way, I was driving into work and saw Nortino, 1490,
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.000]  New Austin Station, and it said the Station of the Race in Spanish. Googled that 10 minutes ago
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000]  when I got into the office, as I get ready at my home for the show, and turned out there's Nortino's
[03:01.000 --> 03:10.000]  all over Texas and went to their sub-website, and it is the Mission of the Raza to dominate El Norte
[03:10.000 --> 03:18.000]  and take over the North. So command ops under control of the globalist, just mechanized forces,
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.000]  the mindless idiot public sucking their thumbs, having no idea what's going on as the plan of
[03:24.000 --> 03:31.000]  San Diego continues and expands its operational directives. You just can't explain this to the
[03:31.000 --> 03:38.000]  thumb-sucking yuppies that know it all, though. So we'll be going over that for you as well.
[03:38.000 --> 03:46.000]  The radio station's around here named the Invader, Nortino, and Raza. They've got stations just called
[03:46.000 --> 03:54.000]  Raza. That's in the extra 18-minute mini-film that's on in-game, Blueprint for Global Enslabment.
[03:54.000 --> 04:02.000]  Everyone needs to see that 18-minute film where you have the plan of San Diego to kill all white
[04:02.000 --> 04:11.000]  males, 16 and older, to reeducate all other whites and blacks, and I have to read it on vans.
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  I have to read it. And I'm bad and evil because I don't want to die and have my son murdered.
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  So this is our country. This is what we are. This is who we are. You fight back against Los Zetas,
[04:23.000 --> 04:30.000]  CIA commandos. It's over for you. They love their Latin death squads. God, they love them.
[04:30.000 --> 04:37.000]  They love them so much. It's just sick. This is us turning into a third world country.
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  Our police behave just like Mexican police now. Guatemalan police, Nicaraguan, El Salvador,
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  and our journey into bondage is just beginning. We'll be right back.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[05:03.000 --> 05:09.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.

[06:53.000 --> 06:59.000]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[06:59.000 --> 07:04.500]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet and lack of exercise.
[07:04.500 --> 07:10.000]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.500]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and loss of weight.
[07:15.500 --> 07:18.500]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[07:18.500 --> 07:22.000]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.500]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[07:25.500 --> 07:30.500]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[07:30.500 --> 07:34.000]  Do your part, alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[07:34.000 --> 07:43.000]  Alkavision Plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.500]  Order your bottle of Alkavision Plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[07:49.500 --> 07:52.000]  Again that's alkavision.com.
[07:52.000 --> 08:00.500]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:00.500 --> 08:04.500]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:09.500 --> 08:18.500]  Coming up later in the shower, I'm going to do a mini report on Nortino, a new chain of radio stations
[08:18.500 --> 08:24.500]  that openly proclaim the station of the race.
[08:24.500 --> 08:31.500]  And it's all about the race and all about gringo and how wicked gringo is and how wonderful the illegal aliens are.
[08:31.500 --> 08:34.500]  And it's all financed by the U.S. government.
[08:34.500 --> 08:40.500]  All finance, all bankrolled, all controlled to balkanize, get us at each other's throats.
[08:40.500 --> 08:49.500]  And the U.S. government funds and finances tens of billions a year, now to be 147 or 146, you can pull the numbers up,
[08:49.500 --> 08:51.500]  billion a year to quote, fight drugs and terror.
[08:51.500 --> 08:54.500]  And that means huge death squads being turned loose on you.
[08:54.500 --> 08:58.500]  Shalika Stillo, of course, talked about this here three years ago.
[08:58.500 --> 09:01.500]  We wrote articles at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com on it.
[09:01.500 --> 09:04.500]  And now here it is in the Houston Chronicle yesterday.
[09:04.500 --> 09:11.500]  U.S. trained forces reportedly helping Mexican car tells rocket attacks, truck bombings,
[09:11.500 --> 09:14.500]  mass kidnappings, hundreds dead.
[09:14.500 --> 09:16.500]  And it's kept very quiet.
[09:16.500 --> 09:20.500]  It's in a few Texas papers, absolute bad luck.
[09:20.500 --> 09:24.500]  And they've now taken the running hit teams, killing reporters inside the U.S.
[09:24.500 --> 09:30.500]  And the U.S. government will come after you if you in any way try to fight back against their terror teams.
[09:30.500 --> 09:33.500]  So you want to live as a third world scum.
[09:33.500 --> 09:37.500]  You want to live and be humiliated and shoved around and taught how to be a slave.
[09:37.500 --> 09:38.500]  You're going to.
[09:38.500 --> 09:45.500]  The Iraqis have already gotten more than 10,000 former death squad members are recruited by Negroponte and others.
[09:45.500 --> 09:51.500]  Sully told us that four years ago, only a year into the Iraq war, he said, yeah,
[09:51.500 --> 09:58.500]  I know a lot of these contacts in Latin America and he was also reading it in Spanish out of the papers in Central America.
[09:58.500 --> 10:07.500]  And he said there are huge death squads being sent in and then later years later, it was in the news mainstream news in England in the U.S.
[10:07.500 --> 10:09.500]  I mean, they just ship them in.
[10:09.500 --> 10:10.500]  They go get the families.
[10:10.500 --> 10:11.500]  They line them up.
[10:11.500 --> 10:12.500]  They blow their heads off.
[10:12.500 --> 10:16.500]  They rock and roll and they're going to rock and roll here.
[10:16.500 --> 10:24.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, as they've grown up in a society where you enslave the people, shove them around where the people bow down to badges and guns and uniforms
[10:24.500 --> 10:34.500]  and know it's all about more details and the little bite, the little corruption with smiling potbellied corrupt thugs running around with submachine guns.
[10:34.500 --> 10:38.500]  Absolute enslavement, 1% owning everything.
[10:38.500 --> 10:41.500]  The rest living with huge open sewers.
[10:41.500 --> 10:43.500]  I mean, that's why that's how we are.
[10:43.500 --> 10:45.500]  That's what we are now.
[10:45.500 --> 10:48.500]  Oh, it's so good.
[10:48.500 --> 10:50.500]  It makes me sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:50.500 --> 10:52.500]  Absolutely makes me want to vomit.
[10:52.500 --> 10:58.500]  By 1998, seven Texas towns already flew the Mexican flag over their courthouses.
[10:58.500 --> 11:00.500]  English not allowed in court.
[11:00.500 --> 11:02.500]  Las Zetas running everything.
[11:02.500 --> 11:06.500]  El Sinizo was the first town to do it more than 14 years ago.
[11:06.500 --> 11:11.500]  Finally heard about that on Lou Dobbs last year, but it was a total whitewash.
[11:11.500 --> 11:18.500]  I first learned about it in the San Antonio newspaper, San Antonio Express News.
[11:18.500 --> 11:23.500]  And they just came right out with a 10 part series in 98.
[11:23.500 --> 11:28.500]  Mr. Gonzalez wrote it and he was horrified by it as an American citizen and a veteran, a patriot,
[11:28.500 --> 11:31.500]  who I really feel sorry for our Hispanic Americans.
[11:31.500 --> 11:35.500]  Wonderful patriotic, hard-working, salt-of-the-earth people.
[11:35.500 --> 11:37.500]  And they are just horrified.
[11:37.500 --> 11:42.500]  They were the first to tell me when I was 10, 11, 12 years old, every summer for a week, my parents would send me from Dallas,
[11:42.500 --> 11:48.500]  San Antonio and my aunt and uncle lived down there to hang out with my cousins, Buckley and Verna and Hester and Peter.
[11:48.500 --> 11:55.500]  And I'd go down there and it was 90% Hispanic in middle-class neighborhood where they lived.
[11:55.500 --> 11:58.500]  It was mainly veterans' families, officers' families.
[11:58.500 --> 12:03.500]  And I thought it was some type of race test or something because I've been taught to be a little liberal chicken neck
[12:03.500 --> 12:05.500]  and feel guilty for being white.
[12:05.500 --> 12:09.500]  I mean, not overtly by my parents, but by the schools and a little bit by family.
[12:09.500 --> 12:15.500]  And so I, you know, contrary to not liking Mexicans, I thought I was bad because I was white.
[12:15.500 --> 12:21.500]  And they'd say, you know about these, they call them wetbacks, you know they hate America and want to kill you, right?
[12:21.500 --> 12:22.500]  And I'd say, no.
[12:22.500 --> 12:27.500]  And they'd say, yeah, you know they want to take down the country and that they're going to drive down the wages and they're bad.
[12:27.500 --> 12:32.500]  And I'd be, you know, eating dinner with their parents and they'd say stuff to me like this.
[12:32.500 --> 12:34.500]  And I'd be like, what are you talking about?
[12:34.500 --> 12:38.500]  And they'd, you know, they'd say, you don't know because, see, they speak Spanish.
[12:38.500 --> 12:43.500]  They speak Spanish and they did know they were around it.
[12:43.500 --> 12:48.500]  They shot just like it was some UT professor who was Hispanic.
[12:48.500 --> 12:55.500]  I've seen him at a few events in another white guy told me three years ago at a Mexican Independence Day rally.
[12:55.500 --> 12:58.500]  This Hispanic guy goes, Alex, you know what those green shirts say to you?
[12:58.500 --> 13:03.500]  And I said, I mean, I didn't, I didn't know one tenth of what I knew three years ago that I know now.
[13:03.500 --> 13:07.500]  It all started when he said, you know what those shirts they're all wearing those green shirts mean?
[13:07.500 --> 13:13.500]  And I looked over and the guys look like something out of a, out of a, you know, comic book of the, you know,
[13:13.500 --> 13:18.500]  classical Mexican rebel, you know, with the big mustache and the black slick back hair.
[13:18.500 --> 13:20.500]  And, you know, I mean, it looked like it should be in movies.
[13:20.500 --> 13:22.500]  I mean, it was, you know, handsome guys.
[13:22.500 --> 13:25.500]  I'm not saying they were bad or anything, but they look like bad guys out of a movie.
[13:25.500 --> 13:28.500]  And they were looking at me, smiling, going, yeah, gringo.
[13:28.500 --> 13:30.500]  And I'm going, why, what does the shirt say?
[13:30.500 --> 13:32.500]  And it says, plan a San Diego.
[13:32.500 --> 13:34.500]  It says, implement the plan a San Diego.
[13:34.500 --> 13:38.500]  Google it. So I got home and I Google University of Texas at Austin,
[13:38.500 --> 13:40.500]  University of Mexico at Mexico City.
[13:40.500 --> 13:46.500]  And it was all the history of the plan to kill white 16 and older and the plan to round up all whites and kill us.
[13:46.500 --> 13:48.500]  And my God, I was like, no one knows.
[13:48.500 --> 13:51.500]  And they were like, no, no one knows.
[13:51.500 --> 13:56.500]  And so now you tune into Mexican radio and it'll be the plan of San Diego will be implemented.
[13:56.500 --> 13:58.500]  You know, and they even say it in English.
[13:58.500 --> 14:04.500]  The head of Chicano studies says it up in U.T. Arlington.
[14:04.500 --> 14:10.500]  We've played the tapes here about we're going to implement the plan of San Diego on the gringo,
[14:10.500 --> 14:18.500]  the dirty pilgrim that came to hurt our Chicano nation when you are part dirty gringo,
[14:18.500 --> 14:23.500]  your natives to North America and Mesoamerica, Southern North America.
[14:23.500 --> 14:25.500]  I mean, you're a dirty gringo too.
[14:25.500 --> 14:28.500]  I mean, I don't dislike the Native American in you.
[14:28.500 --> 14:30.500]  I've got a little bit of Native American in me.
[14:30.500 --> 14:34.500]  I'm proud of my little bit of Native American heritage I have.
[14:34.500 --> 14:37.500]  I mean, I'd be happy to have more.
[14:37.500 --> 14:40.500]  So I mean, you're dirty gringo too.
[14:40.500 --> 14:43.500]  And I'm tired of it.
[14:43.500 --> 14:51.500]  And I'm tired of this incredible insane hoax that the average person doesn't know that these radio stations,
[14:51.500 --> 14:56.500]  my wife speaks Spanish, you know, be driving on a road trip and I'll say, I want you to listen to this for 10 minutes.
[14:56.500 --> 14:58.500]  And she'll go, no, no, I don't want to hear it.
[14:58.500 --> 14:59.500]  And she'll tune in.
[14:59.500 --> 15:00.500]  She'll go, yeah, they're saying race stuff.
[15:00.500 --> 15:02.500]  She'll say, look at that restaurant.
[15:02.500 --> 15:04.500]  It says, you know, the race is going to take over right there.
[15:04.500 --> 15:06.500]  She'll go, look at that Mexican grocery store.
[15:06.500 --> 15:08.500]  It says it right there.
[15:08.500 --> 15:12.500]  I tell her about this just with a little I knew like five, six, seven years ago.
[15:12.500 --> 15:16.500]  And she was like, oh, no, Alex, don't be, you know, don't be racist.
[15:16.500 --> 15:19.500]  And, you know, she knows about the New World Order, but she's still, you know, thinking,
[15:19.500 --> 15:21.500]  you know, kind of mainstream.
[15:21.500 --> 15:23.500]  And then now she's like, oh my God, we're in trouble.
[15:23.500 --> 15:25.500]  Look, it says they're going to kill us right there on that.
[15:25.500 --> 15:26.500]  Oh my God, look at that.
[15:26.500 --> 15:34.500]  You know, because she lived once, you know, a romantic language, you know, I'm all, she lived, I don't know, six years in Rome,
[15:34.500 --> 15:39.500]  three years in France, four years in Madrid in Spain.
[15:39.500 --> 15:41.500]  So she speaks it fluently.
[15:41.500 --> 15:43.500]  She speaks, they say, Castilian and people here.
[15:43.500 --> 15:48.500]  It's like the correct chopped off, you know, she can hardly understand sometimes the.
[15:48.500 --> 15:51.500]  Version we've got up here in the border area.
[15:51.500 --> 15:54.500]  We're just kind of mixed with English and other stuff.
[15:54.500 --> 16:02.500]  But I mean, it freaks you out when there's transmitters everywhere going, the takeover will be soon prepare ourselves to deal with the devil gringo.
[16:02.500 --> 16:07.500]  They are the scum of earth and fields for racist trash need to be immediately.
[16:07.500 --> 16:16.500]  I mean, and it's like, you know, huge La Raza meetings with tens of thousands going, we will soon implement the plan of San Diego in English.
[16:16.500 --> 16:18.500]  I'm like, murder me. Why?
[16:18.500 --> 16:21.500]  You know, and it's like, how dare you say you don't want to be murdered?
[16:21.500 --> 16:29.500]  How dare you, you racist pig, white piece of trash, you and your my out of black bird friends.
[16:29.500 --> 16:42.500]  And then you hear about the quote riots in LA and you hear about the quote, you know, SWAT teams and riot gear had to be called out this week and last week and week before when black groups were in Mexican groups and Latin were fighting.
[16:42.500 --> 16:54.500]  Then you actually read the newspaper details, it's, you'll have 10 to one, you know, the Latins attacking the blacks and they have public in this 13 pocron nations about, you must kill a Miata every day.
[16:54.500 --> 16:58.500]  You know, per city and in the blacks are just being shot and killed everywhere.
[16:58.500 --> 17:00.500]  And if they fight back, they're bad.
[17:00.500 --> 17:03.500]  I mean, this is insane.
[17:03.500 --> 17:08.500]  This is, I mean, you know, the white birds and the black birds are to be killed.
[17:08.500 --> 17:13.500]  And, and the Mexican culture is very racist towards Indians too.
[17:13.500 --> 17:15.500]  I mean, it's on mainstream TV.
[17:15.500 --> 17:18.500]  They call the Indians the dirty retarded children in Spanish.
[17:18.500 --> 17:20.500]  That's the, that's the translation.
[17:20.500 --> 17:24.500]  The, in fact, you know what, I think I'm going to do a special.
[17:24.500 --> 17:31.500]  I'm going to dig up clips of these radio stations and shows and websites and I think I'm going to string them all together and then have them translated for you.
[17:31.500 --> 17:33.500]  So everybody can hear it.
[17:33.500 --> 17:34.500]  I don't have the staff.
[17:34.500 --> 17:35.500]  I don't have the people.
[17:35.500 --> 17:38.500]  I don't have the, the infrastructure to do it.
[17:38.500 --> 17:45.500]  That's why I was thinking about how we spend $15,000 a month on internet.
[17:45.500 --> 17:51.500]  We spend about $15,000 a month on radio, shortwave and things like that.
[17:51.500 --> 17:57.500]  We spend, then I pay my employees and there's a tiny amount.
[17:57.500 --> 18:04.500]  And then I've taken that tiny amount that's left over and tried to put it in an account so we could run a few months if money stopped flowing ever.
[18:04.500 --> 18:05.500]  You know, I think ahead.
[18:05.500 --> 18:06.500]  I try to prepare.
[18:06.500 --> 18:10.500]  I try to, and I want to expand and do a bunch of other stuff, but we need your support.
[18:10.500 --> 18:22.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't have the fortune 500 to a man donating huge amounts of money to put up radio stations that say the race or the northern takeover or the rebellion or the rebels.
[18:22.500 --> 18:26.500]  The race rebels or the race or the holy race or the God race.
[18:26.500 --> 18:28.500]  How do you say cosmic in Spanish?
[18:28.500 --> 18:30.500]  It'll say cosmic Raza.
[18:30.500 --> 18:33.500]  I mean, they have city council proclamations that they're the God race.
[18:33.500 --> 18:35.500]  Here in Austin, I have that on video.
[18:35.500 --> 18:40.500]  I mean, I'm freaked out folks and I'm not going to play along with this cover up anymore.
[18:40.500 --> 18:47.500]  And then I hate having to talk about it and hurt the feelings of good Hispanics and good Americans and people who are freaked out about this.
[18:47.500 --> 18:51.500]  But I cannot go along with this anymore.
[18:51.500 --> 18:54.500]  I cannot play along with this anymore.
[18:54.500 --> 19:00.500]  And it's that we want to fight and so much more we want to do, but we need your help.
[19:00.500 --> 19:03.500]  There's a couple of ways to donate.
[19:03.500 --> 19:07.500]  Go to infowars.com, buy 5, 10, 15, 20 DVDs if you've got the capital.
[19:07.500 --> 19:09.500]  I know things are tough.
[19:09.500 --> 19:12.500]  Buy the books and the videos and the materials we carry that others have made.
[19:12.500 --> 19:15.500]  That way you're supporting them as well because we buy it from them.
[19:15.500 --> 19:18.500]  You know, 60% off or so on average.
[19:18.500 --> 19:19.500]  Help us.
[19:19.500 --> 19:21.500]  I mean, we need your help.
[19:21.500 --> 19:22.500]  We need your support.
[19:22.500 --> 19:23.500]  Support our sponsors.
[19:23.500 --> 19:25.500]  Support our aminevam affiliates.
[19:25.500 --> 19:27.500]  If you want to write me a check, that's fine.
[19:27.500 --> 19:33.500]  If you say on the check 100% goes to the effort, 100% will go to it.
[19:33.500 --> 19:35.500]  Okay?
[19:35.500 --> 19:38.500]  Because then I'll put it in a separate account where 100% goes.
[19:38.500 --> 19:43.500]  If not, it goes in a general fund and about, used to be about 10% went to support me and my family.
[19:43.500 --> 19:45.500]  Now it's about 5%.
[19:45.500 --> 19:47.500]  Because things have grown.
[19:47.500 --> 19:48.500]  I need your support.
[19:48.500 --> 19:54.500]  I need the fuel to drive the engine.
[19:54.500 --> 19:57.500]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[19:57.500 --> 20:02.500]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods you are not correctly attacking the cancer
[20:02.500 --> 20:06.500]  and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[20:06.500 --> 20:14.500]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?

[22:53.500 --> 22:56.500]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine
[22:56.500 --> 23:01.500]  Did you know that the builders of the Twin Towers taken down in the 9-1-1 episode
[23:01.500 --> 23:07.500]  said that the steel would not melt unless there was a sustained temperature of 3,000 degrees?
[23:07.500 --> 23:13.500]  The immediate impact created temperatures of 2,000 degrees for about 15 to 20 seconds.
[23:13.500 --> 23:16.500]  Not long enough to even begin the melting process.
[23:16.500 --> 23:19.500]  The fire continued at about 1100 degrees.
[23:19.500 --> 23:23.500]  Fire could not have been the cause for the Twin Towers to collapse.

[24:00.500 --> 24:08.500]  We are change Anthony Yasha had a chance to talk to Jesse Venturi yesterday in Minnesota.
[24:08.500 --> 24:10.500]  He is with We Are Change.
[24:10.500 --> 24:14.500]  He's also in affiliate relations for the GCN Radio Network in Minneapolis, St. Paul.
[24:14.500 --> 24:16.500]  They went out and talked to Jesse.
[24:16.500 --> 24:18.500]  I guess we'll go ahead and tell you now.
[24:18.500 --> 24:20.500]  He is on the show next week.
[24:20.500 --> 24:22.500]  We have another big guest too.
[24:22.500 --> 24:24.500]  But he's coming back on for a second time.
[24:24.500 --> 24:27.500]  He said, yeah, we are change him for wars in GCN.
[24:27.500 --> 24:29.500]  He goes, oh, I'm on that show next week.
[24:29.500 --> 24:31.500]  Venturi volunteered that he'll be on next week.
[24:31.500 --> 24:37.500]  We're going to go ahead and put that video out in the next day or so soon as Anthony can get that up.
[24:37.500 --> 24:41.500]  So Anthony will be popping in about 15 minutes to give us an update on exactly what Venturi said.
[24:41.500 --> 24:45.500]  He wouldn't talk to the rest of the mainstream media, but he would talk to We Are Change, kind of interesting.
[24:45.500 --> 24:47.500]  And then they're going to be meeting with him today.
[24:47.500 --> 24:48.500]  He said he'd talk to him further.
[24:48.500 --> 24:51.500]  So Anthony was asking me what we ought to ask Venturi on.
[24:51.500 --> 24:53.500]  I'm trying to think here.
[24:53.500 --> 24:57.500]  Let's go ahead and get into this.
[24:57.500 --> 24:59.500]  These stations are all over Texas.
[24:59.500 --> 25:01.500]  San Antonio, Austin, you name it.
[25:01.500 --> 25:07.500]  Just driving into work, I saw a van that said the station of the race for the race.
[25:07.500 --> 25:13.500]  And it's got a big Aztec calendar on it with the devil God sticking its tongue out.
[25:13.500 --> 25:15.500]  And it's just real fun.
[25:15.500 --> 25:21.500]  And so a nice station to add to the other local station called the Invader.
[25:21.500 --> 25:36.500]  But this station is Nortino, which I guess I'm told translates into the land of the Latinos, the northern Latino empire, the racial kingdom.
[25:36.500 --> 25:39.500]  Of course, the city council did have a master race proclamation.
[25:39.500 --> 25:40.500]  We have it on video.
[25:40.500 --> 25:42.500]  So they are not just the master race.
[25:42.500 --> 25:47.500]  They are a cosmic and then said it in Spanish meaning of the God race.
[25:47.500 --> 26:01.500]  So I, but actually according to what they put out this liberation theology, I am a God then because we've got Comanche and Cherokee on both several sides of my dad's family.
[26:01.500 --> 26:05.500]  And so I guess I am part of the God, but I look to gringos.
[26:05.500 --> 26:06.500]  I'll have to be killed.
[26:06.500 --> 26:08.500]  Let's go ahead under the plan.
[26:08.500 --> 26:18.500]  Let's go ahead and play that.
[26:59.500 --> 27:01.500]  Okay.
[27:01.500 --> 27:03.500]  Now here's a local.
[27:03.500 --> 27:10.500]  The TV station reporting on how wonderful it is and how they're fighting for the wonderful illegal aliens that will bring us to Raza.
[27:10.500 --> 27:11.500]  Here it is.
[27:11.500 --> 27:13.500]  100,000 listeners tune in daily.
[27:13.500 --> 27:18.500]  Many of them Mexican immigrants legally and illegally in the United States.
[27:18.500 --> 27:25.500]  According to its research, they have helped make KSAH 720 the top AM station in this market.
[27:25.500 --> 27:31.500]  Just the day we got a report is reaching a huge Spanish speaking audience, not to mention their spending power.
[27:31.500 --> 27:42.500]  Alberto Alegres job from 7 to 8 AM daily, find workers and jobs for listeners of Norteño 720.
[27:42.500 --> 27:46.500]  Necesita soldador, welder for metal buildings.
[27:46.500 --> 27:49.500]  Andale troquero con licencia.
[27:49.500 --> 27:52.500]  License truckers and a housekeeper.
[27:52.500 --> 27:55.500]  In Utah, can you believe how many job offers come through here?
[27:55.500 --> 28:00.500]  The job offers and phone numbers that are broadcast fill Alberto Alegres spiral notebook.
[28:00.500 --> 28:04.500]  That's it. Over 100 jobs, bro. Take that to the bank.
[28:06.500 --> 28:12.500]  That's why he says major advertisers also listen to la estación de la Raza.
[28:12.500 --> 28:18.500]  A lot of advertisers wanted to know where are these undocumented, unregistered people?
[28:18.500 --> 28:21.500]  Well, they're somewhere. They work. They listen to the radio.
[28:21.500 --> 28:25.500]  Yet Alegres says his show is a public service for everyone.
[28:25.500 --> 28:30.500]  This is how Radio Norteño reaches its listeners by going to them.
[28:30.500 --> 28:35.500]  Stop right there. It's for everyone in the race, but for those outside the race, nothing.
[28:35.500 --> 28:42.500]  You imagine a number one radio station in San Antonio for white people saying for the race,
[28:42.500 --> 28:46.500]  and then calling in, you know, oh, you're an illegal alien. Let's get you a job.
[28:46.500 --> 28:49.500]  While the wages implode, the economy falls apart.
[28:49.500 --> 28:53.500]  Just literally like strip mining. They do that with high powered water jets.
[28:53.500 --> 28:58.500]  That's what that station is. Just water jetting the country as the walls collapse down.
[28:58.500 --> 29:04.500]  But big green go companies, they help bring down America.
[29:04.500 --> 29:08.500]  It's so much fun. You've got all the big bankers behind you.
[29:08.500 --> 29:11.500]  And you are on the winning team. There's no doubt about it.
[29:11.500 --> 29:17.500]  The country is going down and the cops are told don't arrest you for DWI or no ID.
[29:17.500 --> 29:19.500]  Now that Austin cops tell me it's been on the news.
[29:19.500 --> 29:24.500]  Sheriffs have complained. I mean, I'm a slave. I'm scum. I'm lucky I've not been killed yet.
[29:24.500 --> 29:32.500]  I am a piece of trash gringo filled. And it's good that I'm outside the race. I get nothing.
[29:32.500 --> 29:39.500]  Hail the Raza. Hail the Raza. Hail your plan with the German government in 1918 to attack the U.S.
[29:39.500 --> 29:43.500]  I just, I'm bad because I'm against Hitler.
[29:43.500 --> 29:47.500]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[29:47.500 --> 29:53.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:53.500 --> 29:58.500]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[29:58.500 --> 30:03.500]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[30:03.500 --> 30:08.500]  It's known as the Bilderberg. But their objective being world domination.
[30:08.500 --> 30:11.500]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[30:11.500 --> 30:22.500]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[30:22.500 --> 30:27.500]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[30:27.500 --> 30:31.500]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[30:31.500 --> 30:34.500]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[30:34.500 --> 30:38.500]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[33:15.500 --> 33:20.500]  Imagine you're at a rally. There's people chanting up in Mexico down with the U.S.
[33:20.500 --> 33:27.500]  They're wearing green shirts saying they want to kill all whites, 16 and older.
[33:27.500 --> 33:37.500]  And the media's there going, sweet families came out today to love America and celebrate their Hispanic heritage.
[33:37.500 --> 33:44.500]  Who could be against that? Got the Irish Day Parade, got the Martin Luther King Day stuff, and that's great.
[33:44.500 --> 33:54.500]  But it's not that. It's that I'm going to be murdered, racially murdered, and then all the monies behind it.
[33:54.500 --> 33:59.500]  And I've got to look at vans driving around that say, the station of the race.
[33:59.500 --> 34:04.500]  And then, oh, we're going to do a public service announcement for our people.
[34:04.500 --> 34:07.500]  And we're going to get them all jobs, and that's what this is all about.
[34:07.500 --> 34:12.500]  And folks, it's more than that. If you're a cook in Southern California, and there's been newscasts about this,
[34:12.500 --> 34:18.500]  they tell you, they'll walk off. They go, we're not going to work with a gringo or a mayada. Only our people.
[34:18.500 --> 34:23.500]  And so it's all Hispanic cooks, Latin American, mainly Mexican. They're also mean to other Latin Americans.
[34:23.500 --> 34:26.500]  That's the dominant group. It's up against our border.
[34:26.500 --> 34:33.500]  A hostile, America-hating country that's lost two wars with us, and a bunch of other skirmishes.
[34:33.500 --> 34:36.500]  Poor people totally enslaved by their government who do want jobs.
[34:36.500 --> 34:39.500]  They get up here instead of being brought into the melting pot.
[34:39.500 --> 34:43.500]  It would still be bad for the economy overall, but later might be okay.
[34:43.500 --> 34:47.500]  Instead, it's just, haha, we're going to get the gringos. It's race, race, race.
[34:47.500 --> 34:50.500]  And the corporate media, the government, they all know this.
[34:50.500 --> 34:57.500]  Meanwhile, our government gives 10 plus billion a year. Now they want to give 140 plus billion a year.
[34:57.500 --> 35:04.500]  U.S. trained forces reportedly helping Mexican Tartels, as many as 200 U.S. trained Mexican security personnel have defected to the drug cartels.
[35:04.500 --> 35:07.500]  Defected. The government is the drug cartels.
[35:07.500 --> 35:12.500]  To carry out killings of both sides of the border, as far north as Dallas, Representative Ted Poe,
[35:12.500 --> 35:18.500]  Republican of Humboldt, told Congress on Wednesday, get him on, get him on, get him on.
[35:18.500 --> 35:22.500]  We told you this three years ago when it was in no newspaper.
[35:22.500 --> 35:28.500]  Salah Castillo, who lives on the border. He lives in South Texas.
[35:28.500 --> 35:32.500]  And he came and he told you on air, folks.
[35:32.500 --> 35:37.500]  And it's a lot more than 200. And it goes on. But it says, oh, they switched sides. They didn't switch sides.
[35:37.500 --> 35:44.500]  The U.S. government, the drug cartels, the CIA, the Mexican government are teamed up waging war on cartels they don't control.
[35:44.500 --> 35:48.500]  But according to most of the estimates I've seen are about 20% of the market.
[35:48.500 --> 35:53.500]  Because if the CIA could knock out 20% of that market, it could be like the Bures with the Diamond Monopoly,
[35:53.500 --> 35:56.500]  and then they could charge you even more.
[35:56.500 --> 36:04.500]  Now, this is their phony drug war. So they can jack up the prices and make bigger profits.
[36:04.500 --> 36:09.500]  Now, I'm against the drug war, but knocking out these cartels is even worse.
[36:09.500 --> 36:14.500]  It's going to increase narcotics prices, and then there's going to be more home invasions, more robberies.
[36:14.500 --> 36:17.500]  As the price goes up and the drug heads have got to have it.
[36:17.500 --> 36:22.500]  Thanks a lot, cops. And now they're going to run around as you tighten down on the drugs.
[36:22.500 --> 36:27.500]  They're going to run around and break in more homes so you can make a bigger profit.
[36:27.500 --> 36:30.500]  Disgusting your business model makes me sick.
[36:30.500 --> 36:37.500]  And everybody knows the government brings the drugs in, and I can't believe we have to sit here and play along with this hoax.
[36:37.500 --> 36:40.500]  I'm freaking out.
[36:40.500 --> 36:44.500]  And it's horrible for the poor Mexicans. I mean, down on all the major border towns,
[36:44.500 --> 36:50.500]  and I've had family that's been down there, and I mean, it's boarded up windows, shut down 20-story hotels.
[36:50.500 --> 36:56.500]  I mean, it was nice down there, and now it is a hell pit, and everything's boarded up on both sides of the border.
[36:56.500 --> 37:02.500]  People don't come out at night. If you're driving down, you know, in any type of nice car, everybody runs in fear.
[37:02.500 --> 37:05.500]  I mean, there's rocket attacks, murders, newspapers getting blown up every month.
[37:05.500 --> 37:08.500]  I mean, folks, it is Vietnam war zone.
[37:08.500 --> 37:14.500]  Okay? I mean, remember I told you this five years ago, six years ago you couldn't believe it, now that's the headlines?
[37:14.500 --> 37:22.500]  I mean, it is. The State Department said it's more dangerous on the Texas border on both sides than it is in the West Bank.
[37:22.500 --> 37:26.500]  Statistically, you got a better chance of being killed.
[37:26.500 --> 37:33.500]  Eight hundred and sixty-something people, you can go pull the number up, died in 2006 alone.
[37:33.500 --> 37:37.500]  That's the last time we got numbers. I haven't seen them since.
[37:37.500 --> 37:40.500]  Three hundred and something more on our side going back from memory. The rest were right.
[37:40.500 --> 37:49.500]  I mean, it is unbelievable. I just read to you the Houston Chronicle with congressional testimony that they're running hits.
[37:49.500 --> 37:54.500]  And the drug monies flow, and who do you think's involved with these radio stations and TV stations?
[37:54.500 --> 37:58.500]  I mean, this is sick, and the government just loves it.
[37:58.500 --> 38:06.500]  Our government is so evil and so diabolical and so out of control, it just is unbelievable.
[38:06.500 --> 38:10.500]  Finish up with the local San Antonio newscast as we analyze the propaganda here.
[38:10.500 --> 38:13.500]  How sweet it is. Oh, the station's called The Race.
[38:13.500 --> 38:17.500]  Notice the English-speaking TV won't tell you that. It's, oh, it's a sweet little station.
[38:17.500 --> 38:23.500]  Oh, it's helping the illegals, but they serve everyone in The Race. Go ahead and play it.
[38:23.500 --> 38:24.500]  They work, they listen to the radio.
[38:24.500 --> 38:28.500]  Yeah, Allegra says his show is a public service for everyone.
[38:28.500 --> 38:33.500]  This is how Radio Norteño reaches its listeners by going to them.
[38:33.500 --> 38:41.500]  Some of its loyal listeners recently came straight from their job site.
[38:41.500 --> 38:51.500]  He says Radio Norteño opens the door to more jobs, and he says he frequents their advertisers who make him feel welcomed.
[38:51.500 --> 38:59.500]  I think they should be helped because without them, we wouldn't have everything that we have now in the United States.
[38:59.500 --> 39:04.500]  And that's it. That's going to wrap it up for la hora de los trabajos.
[39:04.500 --> 39:10.500]  Now here in Austin, the top local Brown Berets have been caught in every form of thing you can imagine.
[39:10.500 --> 39:14.500]  They've been caught, these are people involved in city council, you name it,
[39:14.500 --> 39:17.500]  where they'll beat somebody half to death and the police come,
[39:17.500 --> 39:21.500]  and it's because they're running coyote operations, shipping the illegals in.
[39:21.500 --> 39:25.500]  You have to understand these groups also sit on top of the poor Mexican slaves,
[39:25.500 --> 39:33.500]  and that's what it's about is they, they then pimp them out to the gringo owned companies, basically a slave labor.
[39:33.500 --> 39:37.500]  See, if you've made all the Mexicans stay in Mexico, there'd be a rebellion,
[39:37.500 --> 39:39.500]  they take over, you have a good chance of a good government,
[39:39.500 --> 39:44.500]  would triple the resources on average that the U.S. has, more billionaires than the U.S. has.
[39:44.500 --> 39:51.500]  The richest man in the world is now a Mexican because they know how to have their slaves work,
[39:51.500 --> 39:56.500]  and now they've fired their slaves up and got them all mad at the United States,
[39:56.500 --> 40:02.500]  but the globalists are the ones getting rid of the U.S. and they're going to use them as the knife to slit our throat.
[40:02.500 --> 40:05.500]  But when they're done with you, Knife, they're going to drop you into a drain.
[40:05.500 --> 40:07.500]  Just, oh, bye-bye, Knife.
[40:07.500 --> 40:12.500]  You think that government, the media covers up, you're running around saying kill the gringo,
[40:12.500 --> 40:15.500]  and everything for the race, those outside the race, nothing.
[40:15.500 --> 40:18.500]  You think the gringo government likes you?
[40:18.500 --> 40:22.500]  Have you seen your government? Have you ever been to your Congress? I've watched film footage of it.
[40:22.500 --> 40:29.500]  A bunch of six-foot-five white guys named Schmidt and Crump and Fox and everything else,
[40:29.500 --> 40:33.500]  while they laugh at you.
[40:33.500 --> 40:37.500]  Oh, it's so sick. It's so sick.
[40:37.500 --> 40:43.500]  Let me tell the gringos and Hispanic Americans and blacks and everybody else what you do.
[40:43.500 --> 40:45.500]  You don't hire illegal aliens.
[40:45.500 --> 40:52.500]  You find a crew that's got American Hispanics, whites, blacks, and you stop going to Mexican food restaurants.
[40:52.500 --> 40:57.500]  They got Raza on the wall. It's a big joke that they don't like gringo when you come in and buy the food.
[40:57.500 --> 41:03.500]  Just boycott it, folks. You've got to fight for this country or it's over.
[41:03.500 --> 41:05.500]  You've got to fight with everything you've got.
[41:05.500 --> 41:11.500]  Then if people don't like you, if gringos aren't welcome, fine, fine.
[41:11.500 --> 41:17.500]  It's a sick joke, folks, that stupid gringos patronize.
[41:17.500 --> 41:20.500]  You know what? I ought to do a report on it.
[41:20.500 --> 41:26.500]  300 yards from me is a big Mexican food restaurant that's got on the walls outside guys in black ski mask.
[41:26.500 --> 41:30.500]  This is where I knew five, six years ago and I'd be in there and people are like,
[41:30.500 --> 41:32.500]  you know what that says in Spanish on the wall?
[41:32.500 --> 41:36.500]  It turns out it's this big rebel operation. There's a rebel bookstore down the street from it.
[41:36.500 --> 41:41.500]  It turns out the owner runs out screaming. If anybody even halfway parks on his property,
[41:41.500 --> 41:45.500]  he comes running out screaming with baseball bats and screaming, I'm going to get you gringo.
[41:45.500 --> 41:51.500]  He hates white people so much, but then he lets the dumb cattle come in and buy the food.
[41:51.500 --> 42:00.500]  It's perfect because it's another language and the stupid, degenerate, chicken-necked, cowardly, scumbag whites
[42:00.500 --> 42:05.500]  do not know what's going on.
[42:05.500 --> 42:11.500]  Oh, man.
[42:11.500 --> 42:14.500]  Not me. You know, I'm not going to be a schmuck anymore, folks.
[42:14.500 --> 42:18.500]  I'm not going to go along and buy into it. I'm not going to put up with it anymore.
[42:18.500 --> 42:22.500]  You know, I like Jesse Ventura. Is Anthony standing by?
[42:22.500 --> 42:25.500]  Okay. I'm not bashing Jesse Ventura.
[42:25.500 --> 42:27.500]  You know, he's saying he believes the government staged the attacks in 9-11.
[42:27.500 --> 42:31.500]  He's saying he believes they may stage more attacks as a pretext for control.
[42:31.500 --> 42:36.500]  He's saying we're total tyranny and I agree with him on some issues, disagree on others.
[42:36.500 --> 42:42.500]  He gets up on TV and says, hey, I live in Mexico half the year and I'm not scared of the little brown people
[42:42.500 --> 42:44.500]  and blah, blah, blah.
[42:44.500 --> 42:49.500]  Well, that's because you don't speak Spanish, Jesse. I'm in the same way.
[42:49.500 --> 42:52.500]  I can care less if there's 90% Mexicans around me.
[42:52.500 --> 42:56.500]  I like Mexican food, beer, culture, all of it.
[42:56.500 --> 43:03.500]  Okay, I'm not. I don't dislike them. They dislike us, Jesse.
[43:03.500 --> 43:06.500]  Understand comprende?
[43:06.500 --> 43:11.500]  And I'm not going to play along like it's not going on anymore. They got the problem.
[43:11.500 --> 43:14.500]  I don't call my radio show the white ratio.
[43:14.500 --> 43:18.500]  I don't say for white people everything for those outside the whites, nothing.
[43:18.500 --> 43:25.500]  I'm not telling whites to go out to shoot blacks and Mexicans like the Mexican groups are.
[43:25.500 --> 43:28.500]  I'm not the head of Chicano studies or the head of white studies.
[43:28.500 --> 43:33.500]  You know, the head of white studies saying we need to kill all the Mexicans.
[43:33.500 --> 43:36.500]  I've had enough of it.
[43:36.500 --> 43:43.500]  So speaking of interior, I'm going to bring that up to him when he's on next Tuesday, but
[43:43.500 --> 43:46.500]  you got another big guest lined up to next week. That's a surprise guest.
[43:46.500 --> 43:50.500]  But speaking of Jesse Ventura, that's why I brought that up.
[43:50.500 --> 43:52.500]  Anthony works for We Are Change.
[43:52.500 --> 43:56.500]  Well, because he's not paid, but then he called, we talked to him.
[43:56.500 --> 44:00.500]  We got him a job in affiliate relations at Genesis because he lives in Minneapolis, St. Paul.
[44:00.500 --> 44:03.500]  It's been a great job getting us more AM and FM stations.
[44:03.500 --> 44:06.500]  And so he's now part of the Genesis family.
[44:06.500 --> 44:09.500]  And yesterday, a couple of weeks ago, he said, hey, Jesse's coming for a book signing.
[44:09.500 --> 44:11.500]  Should we go to that? And I said, well, don't bug him too much.
[44:11.500 --> 44:13.500]  But I said, yeah, if you want a We Are Change, do what you want.
[44:13.500 --> 44:17.500]  Go ask him a question about, does he think the government may stage another attack as a pretext for control?
[44:17.500 --> 44:20.500]  Now, he was there bashing the media. He said, no questions from the media.
[44:20.500 --> 44:25.500]  But then when he heard that We Are Change and InfoWars, he said, oh, I'm on that show next week.
[44:25.500 --> 44:30.500]  And he did answer some questions. And he said, today, in this other forum where they're going to be, he's going to take more questions.
[44:30.500 --> 44:37.500]  So I wanted to bring Anthony up. What else did Jesse say? What else was he saying yesterday?
[44:37.500 --> 44:39.500]  Hey, Alex.
[44:39.500 --> 44:43.500]  Don't be timid. Come on, turn his audio up. Come on, Anthony. Don't be nervous. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[44:43.500 --> 44:50.500]  No, we actually got to ask him, too, what kind of response he had received since he came out about 9-11.
[44:50.500 --> 44:55.500]  And he's basically saying that he's been getting demonized everywhere he goes just for simply asking questions
[44:55.500 --> 44:58.500]  and that it's the right of Americans to ask questions.
[44:58.500 --> 45:02.500]  And he still got 70% of the family members with unanswered questions.
[45:02.500 --> 45:06.500]  And they deserve answers.
[45:06.500 --> 45:11.500]  Anything else you'd like to report to people?
[45:11.500 --> 45:15.500]  You got to get right up on that microphone, Anthony.
[45:15.500 --> 45:20.500]  Well, like you said, mentioned it, too, that he didn't want to go into it because he didn't want to give away his book,
[45:20.500 --> 45:27.500]  but that he did feel that anything is possible and that they could easily attack us again to bring us into martial law anytime.
[45:27.500 --> 45:29.500]  Oh, he did say he thought they'd do that.
[45:29.500 --> 45:30.500]  Yeah.
[45:30.500 --> 45:33.500]  Have you heard he's announced he may run for Senate in Minnesota?
[45:33.500 --> 45:35.500]  Yeah, he was talking about that last night.
[45:35.500 --> 45:41.500]  And that would probably be the best alternative to either Norm Coleman or Al Franken.
[45:41.500 --> 45:42.500]  Oh, certainly.
[45:42.500 --> 45:46.500]  Now, to be clear, though, he also knows state politics being his former governor.
[45:46.500 --> 45:47.500]  I'm going to support him.
[45:47.500 --> 45:51.500]  To be clear, though, he wouldn't talk to the rest of the media, but he did talk to you.
[45:51.500 --> 45:57.500]  Yeah, he's shown them very, very publicly and made them look very foolish.
[45:57.500 --> 46:03.500]  I mean, they just pretty much attacked him when he was governor about things that weren't even important, really,
[46:03.500 --> 46:08.500]  when he did a trade mission at China and came back and they'd rather cover some gossip story
[46:08.500 --> 46:11.500]  than actually cover news of what our governor's doing.
[46:11.500 --> 46:13.500]  Absolutely, Anthony.
[46:13.500 --> 46:14.500]  Now, let's go back for a minute here.
[46:14.500 --> 46:17.500]  Specifically, you just said I'm from InfoWars and we are changing.
[46:17.500 --> 46:19.500]  He said, oh, I'm on that show next week.
[46:19.500 --> 46:20.500]  Yep.
[46:20.500 --> 46:21.500]  And what's your question, sir?
[46:21.500 --> 46:22.500]  Well, that's good.
[46:22.500 --> 46:23.500]  That's exciting.
[46:23.500 --> 46:28.500]  Well, I'm flattered that they told me at the publisher that he's really excited and wants to come back on.
[46:28.500 --> 46:31.500]  So we're really happy to have him back on.
[46:31.500 --> 46:33.500]  Anything else you want to add, Anthony?
[46:33.500 --> 46:37.500]  It's really good to see him because, like, one of our other members, Terence Scott,
[46:37.500 --> 46:42.500]  he was the one that asked him basically what kind of response did he receive and he took,
[46:42.500 --> 46:46.500]  it was about four minutes of people still standing in line waiting to get books signed
[46:46.500 --> 46:53.500]  and he was signing other people's books while he was still talking to Terence about pretty much the close to freefall speed
[46:53.500 --> 46:57.500]  of the building's collapse and it was really good to see him.
[46:57.500 --> 47:00.500]  How fast can you get that encoded and up on YouTube?
[47:00.500 --> 47:04.500]  Hopefully by the end of the workday here.
[47:04.500 --> 47:05.500]  Okay.
[47:05.500 --> 47:06.500]  Well, good job.
[47:06.500 --> 47:10.500]  Anything else he said we should know about?
[47:10.500 --> 47:17.500]  I think he needs the support is what it seemed like because he seemed like he really wants to come out
[47:17.500 --> 47:23.500]  but he still kind of wants to be able to go back to Baja and maybe surf if he could.
[47:23.500 --> 47:25.500]  I think he needs the support though.
[47:25.500 --> 47:27.500]  Well, we do support him.
[47:27.500 --> 47:31.500]  Of course, the corporate horror media is going to attack him and demonize him and twist what he said
[47:31.500 --> 47:35.500]  but that's what they always do and that's why they're losing their entire market share.
[47:35.500 --> 47:36.500]  It's why everybody's tuning out.
[47:36.500 --> 47:39.500]  We have a trader government and that's the end of it.
[47:39.500 --> 47:42.500]  Anthony, where is he going to be speaking today?
[47:42.500 --> 47:49.500]  He will be at the Maple Grove Barnes & Nobles at 7 o'clock in Maple Grove, Minnesota.
[47:49.500 --> 47:52.500]  Okay, and he told you he was going to talk to you more there today.
[47:52.500 --> 48:00.500]  Specifically, what happened there with that because I want to know the specifics because I want to talk to you before you go about some questions.
[48:00.500 --> 48:04.500]  I told him that we had some stuff for him and they said definitely meet up with me tomorrow
[48:04.500 --> 48:07.500]  and like I said, we just didn't want to be in his hair and linger.
[48:07.500 --> 48:08.500]  Yeah, don't be in his hair today.
[48:08.500 --> 48:11.500]  I'll think of another good question or you think of some.
[48:11.500 --> 48:13.500]  Just ask him the question and give him the stuff.
[48:13.500 --> 48:17.500]  Tell him Alex Jones says thank you and here's some films.
[48:17.500 --> 48:18.500]  He'll talk to you next week.
[48:18.500 --> 48:20.500]  Here's Alex's newest film.
[48:20.500 --> 48:21.500]  Definitely.
[48:21.500 --> 48:22.500]  Okay.
[48:22.500 --> 48:24.500]  Well, I really appreciate you and the great job you've done, Anthony.
[48:24.500 --> 48:25.500]  Thank you, Alex.
[48:25.500 --> 48:26.500]  Take care.
[48:26.500 --> 48:27.500]  There goes Anthony.
[48:27.500 --> 48:29.500]  All right.
[48:29.500 --> 48:31.500]  I got a lot of other news I want to cover.
[48:31.500 --> 48:34.500]  We got Aaron Zellman coming up at one o'clock.
[48:34.500 --> 48:36.500]  That's about an hour and 10 minutes.
[48:36.500 --> 48:42.500]  And then we've got Celica Stillo coming on to talk about how the murder gangs work for the US government.
[48:42.500 --> 48:48.500]  He told you three years ago on this show, we wrote articles about it proving we said it.
[48:48.500 --> 48:51.500]  That US trained forces reportedly helping Mexican cartels.
[48:51.500 --> 48:54.500]  And then it goes into how they're murdering people in the US.
[48:54.500 --> 48:55.500]  Okay.
[48:55.500 --> 48:58.500]  But the big news here is they work for the globalist.
[48:58.500 --> 48:59.500]  Okay.
[48:59.500 --> 49:04.500]  So that's going to be in the fourth hour today with Celica Stillo, a great American patriot,
[49:04.500 --> 49:06.500]  who we are supporting.
[49:06.500 --> 49:11.500]  And again, I want to say that it's very painful that I have to come out on air.
[49:11.500 --> 49:14.500]  I don't like to attack different religious groups.
[49:14.500 --> 49:16.500]  I don't like it to point out racial things that are happening.
[49:16.500 --> 49:18.500]  I want to get along.
[49:18.500 --> 49:23.500]  And I try to ignore things until they're just too big and too important.
[49:23.500 --> 49:31.500]  And it's just too much to have vans driving around saying the station of the race or the rebel station or the takeover station
[49:31.500 --> 49:34.500]  or the station of the Northern Empire of the race.
[49:34.500 --> 49:40.500]  And then to have all of it, you know, to spearhead illegal activity and to get illegal aliens' jobs.
[49:40.500 --> 49:42.500]  It's disgusting.
[49:42.500 --> 49:45.500]  Our country is falling apart.
[49:45.500 --> 49:48.500]  There's six billion people want to come here.
[49:48.500 --> 49:50.500]  Six billion.
[49:50.500 --> 49:53.500]  Mexico's doubling its population every 30 years.
[49:53.500 --> 49:55.500]  They're like 130 million.
[49:55.500 --> 49:58.500]  They were 50 million just 20 years ago.
[49:58.500 --> 50:02.500]  And they're all taught to hate America.
[50:02.500 --> 50:04.500]  Now, does that mean all of them buy into it?
[50:04.500 --> 50:05.500]  No, but a lot of them do.
[50:05.500 --> 50:06.500]  Remember what?
[50:06.500 --> 50:11.500]  About a month after 9-11, they had the big World Cup stuff in Mexico City and they were all chanting,
[50:11.500 --> 50:15.500]  Usama, Usama, Go Usama while they were playing in the U.S.
[50:15.500 --> 50:19.500]  I mean, it's loving the towers being blown up.
[50:19.500 --> 50:21.500]  That was mainstream news that happened.
[50:21.500 --> 50:23.500]  Now, of course, that was a fraud.
[50:23.500 --> 50:24.500]  It wasn't really been lied.
[50:24.500 --> 50:25.500]  And it was our own criminals.
[50:25.500 --> 50:27.500]  Those same ones open the door for you.
[50:27.500 --> 50:31.500]  The same ones energizing your raza.
[50:31.500 --> 50:33.500]  You're not going to get anything in the end.
[50:33.500 --> 50:37.500]  But sterilization shots from the New World Order and cancer injections.
[50:37.500 --> 50:38.500]  I'm your friend.
[50:38.500 --> 50:42.500]  I'm against the Planned Parenthoods and your neighborhoods killing you.
[50:42.500 --> 50:48.500]  That's your liberal, you know, Chicano raza leaders are for.
[50:48.500 --> 51:17.500]  You're being controlled like the dumb gringos.
[51:21.500 --> 51:25.500]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,
[51:25.500 --> 51:29.500]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[51:34.500 --> 51:38.500]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge distance
[51:38.500 --> 51:41.500]  on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement,
[51:41.500 --> 51:44.500]  America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[51:44.500 --> 51:47.500]  We're in a no holds bar information war.
[51:47.500 --> 51:53.500]  Truth is our weapon and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[51:53.500 --> 51:55.500]  Wake up, Protestant America.
[51:55.500 --> 51:59.500]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[51:59.500 --> 52:02.500]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations
[52:02.500 --> 52:05.500]  will form one huge political voting block.
[52:05.500 --> 52:09.500]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[52:09.500 --> 52:12.500]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom,
[52:12.500 --> 52:14.500]  liberty of conscience.
[52:14.500 --> 52:17.500]  They and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state,
[52:17.500 --> 52:19.500]  must be kept separate.
[52:19.500 --> 52:22.500]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[52:22.500 --> 52:25.500]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[52:25.500 --> 52:28.500]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome,
[52:28.500 --> 52:30.500]  religious intolerance resulted.
[52:30.500 --> 52:34.500]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[52:34.500 --> 52:37.500]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[52:37.500 --> 52:40.500]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[52:40.500 --> 52:42.500]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[52:42.500 --> 52:47.500]  Coming soon for free materials call 888-211-1715

[52:53.500 --> 52:57.500]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated,
[52:57.500 --> 52:59.500]  even banned TV on your computer?
[52:59.500 --> 53:03.500]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup
[53:03.500 --> 53:08.500]  that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch
[53:08.500 --> 53:11.500]  without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[53:11.500 --> 53:12.500]  Here's the story.
[53:12.500 --> 53:16.500]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high speed internet connection
[53:16.500 --> 53:20.500]  gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[53:20.500 --> 53:23.500]  And here's the best part, it's 100% legal.
[53:23.500 --> 53:26.500]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries
[53:26.500 --> 53:29.500]  to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[53:29.500 --> 53:34.500]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[53:34.500 --> 53:39.500]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[53:39.500 --> 53:43.500]  That's simple, just go to www.OrderFreeTV.com.
[53:43.500 --> 53:46.500]  That's www.OrderFreeTV.com.
[53:46.500 --> 53:52.500]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.OrderFreeTV.com.
[53:55.500 --> 53:59.500]  The station of La Raza in Norteño, Siente Ventajo.
[53:59.500 --> 54:03.500]  Some of its loyal listeners recently came straight from their job site.
[54:05.500 --> 54:08.500]  He says Radio Norteño opens the door to more jobs
[54:08.500 --> 54:12.500]  and he says he frequents their advertisers who make him feel welcomed.
[54:12.500 --> 54:16.500]  I think they should be helped because without them
[54:16.500 --> 54:20.500]  we wouldn't have everything that we have now in the United States.
[54:20.500 --> 54:39.500]  And that's it, that's gonna wrap it up.
[55:04.500 --> 55:09.500]  I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
[55:09.500 --> 55:14.500]  and the road goes on forever
[55:14.500 --> 55:19.500]  I've got one more silver dollar
[55:19.500 --> 55:22.500]  But I don't know where the kids are going
[55:22.500 --> 55:26.500]  I don't know where the kids are going
[55:26.500 --> 55:30.500]  We're gonna open the phones up in 30 minutes
[55:30.500 --> 55:35.500]  1-800-259-9231
[55:35.500 --> 55:39.500]  You can get lined up now if you want.
[55:39.500 --> 55:42.500]  I want to hear from first time callers today.
[55:42.500 --> 55:45.500]  First time callers, tell us or go to the head of the line.
[55:45.500 --> 55:48.500]  The only thing they can trump that is somebody that disagrees.
[55:48.500 --> 55:50.500]  There's a rare trump.
[55:50.500 --> 55:54.500]  They're calling from McMurtle weather station in Antarctica.
[55:54.500 --> 55:56.500]  We've really gotten calls from there.
[55:56.500 --> 55:59.500]  Or they're calling from a cruise ship or something.
[55:59.500 --> 56:01.500]  We might trump and take it to the head of the line
[56:01.500 --> 56:03.500]  when you're paying two bucks a minute or something.
[56:03.500 --> 56:06.500]  1-800-259-9231
[56:06.500 --> 56:09.500]  If you call me from the space station, we never have one of those calls.
[56:09.500 --> 56:13.500]  If one of the astronauts calls, we'll put them to the head of the line too.
[56:13.500 --> 56:17.500]  1-800-259-9231
[56:17.500 --> 56:24.500]  The globalists plan to play the brainwashed La Ricanquistas
[56:24.500 --> 56:26.500]  that they're bringing into the country
[56:26.500 --> 56:29.500]  against what's left of the middle class in this nation
[56:29.500 --> 56:31.500]  because they're a real enemy in what color you are
[56:31.500 --> 56:35.500]  but ever being able to be independent of them.
[56:35.500 --> 56:38.500]  And so it's more divide and conquer, more of the great game.
[56:38.500 --> 56:44.500]  The British play the three different factions in Iraq off against each other.
[56:44.500 --> 56:49.500]  And so I beg any low-reconquista people listening
[56:49.500 --> 56:52.500]  or anybody who can speak Spanish and people in the Hispanic community.
[56:52.500 --> 56:54.500]  I know we have a huge Hispanic listening audience
[56:54.500 --> 56:56.500]  to reach out to these poor folks.
[56:56.500 --> 56:58.500]  You know, I go out and bullhorn the Klan
[56:58.500 --> 57:00.500]  and I've been out and I've bullhorned La Raza.
[57:00.500 --> 57:03.500]  But the Klan isn't a protected group.
[57:03.500 --> 57:05.500]  The La Raza's are.
[57:05.500 --> 57:08.500]  And I for one have had enough of it.
[57:08.500 --> 57:10.500]  I for one have had enough of it.
[57:10.500 --> 57:13.500]  And I thought it was just in the border in the central areas of Mexico.
[57:13.500 --> 57:15.500]  A few years ago I went on a family vacation.
[57:15.500 --> 57:19.500]  We went down to southern Mexico, down to Costa Maya to do some snorkeling and stuff.
[57:19.500 --> 57:21.500]  And we drove into the interior to see some pyramids.
[57:21.500 --> 57:25.500]  And I have my wife at these little shacks and places where you buy chips and water
[57:25.500 --> 57:28.500]  with the little gift shops there by the pyramids.
[57:28.500 --> 57:30.500]  Hey, have you heard about the La Rican Quista?
[57:30.500 --> 57:31.500]  What do you think of that?
[57:31.500 --> 57:33.500]  And it's like, yes, we're going to get you, we're taking over
[57:33.500 --> 57:35.500]  and then they'll just laugh at you.
[57:35.500 --> 57:37.500]  And it's like, and some of them got downright hateful.
[57:37.500 --> 57:38.500]  They'd be acting real friendly.
[57:38.500 --> 57:40.500]  Give me the money, Gringo, come on.
[57:40.500 --> 57:44.500]  And then as soon as you said, hey, you know, and have my wife say, hey, what's the,
[57:44.500 --> 57:46.500]  or I'd say, hey, do you know about La Rican Quista?
[57:46.500 --> 57:49.500]  And they'd say, yes, yes, we're, we're, we're taking over.
[57:49.500 --> 57:51.500]  You're going to, and they get real serious.
[57:51.500 --> 57:52.500]  You're about to get it.
[57:52.500 --> 57:56.500]  And I mean, I'm going to respond to a plan of San Diego to kill me.
[57:56.500 --> 58:01.500]  I mean, I can't, the plan of San Diego is going well against the blacks in LA right now.
[58:01.500 --> 58:04.500]  They're killing a black guy every day or so.
[58:04.500 --> 58:09.500]  And I mean, this is big.
[58:09.500 --> 58:10.500]  This is the big issue.
[58:10.500 --> 58:11.500]  This is huge.
[58:11.500 --> 58:18.500]  1-800-25-99231, massive news blitz, massive news blitz, and T9 is 70 seconds.
[58:18.500 --> 58:20.500]  I'm going to cover it all, the news of today.
[58:20.500 --> 58:23.500]  And I'm even going to try to get back into some of the news of yesterday.
[58:23.500 --> 58:28.500]  We'll see if I can control myself and not get sidetracked by laboring on one article or the other.
[58:28.500 --> 58:31.500]  M4Wars.com is the attack coordinates.
[58:34.500 --> 58:36.500]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:36.500 --> 58:43.500]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:43.500 --> 58:48.500]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[58:48.500 --> 58:53.500]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:53.500 --> 58:55.500]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[58:55.500 --> 58:58.500]  Could their objective be world domination?
[58:58.500 --> 59:01.500]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:01.500 --> 59:09.500]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:12.500 --> 59:17.500]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:17.500 --> 59:21.500]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[59:21.500 --> 59:24.500]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:24.500 --> 59:25.500]  Most people have no idea.
[59:25.500 --> 59:26.500]  They're not after money.
[59:26.500 --> 59:27.500]  They have all the money they need.
[59:27.500 --> 59:28.500]  They're after power.
[59:28.500 --> 59:29.500]  That's their affidavit.

[59:40.500 --> 59:42.500]  You have been warned.
[59:46.500 --> 59:48.500]  Waging war on corruption.
[59:48.500 --> 59:51.500]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[59:51.500 --> 59:56.500]  Yeah, government cover-ups.
[59:56.500 --> 59:57.500]  You want answers?
[59:57.500 --> 59:59.500]  Well, so does he.
[59:59.500 --> 1:00:03.500]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:00:03.500 --> 1:00:08.500]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:10.500 --> 1:00:15.500]  Coming up later, I'm going to play about a three-minute interview that a great researcher did.
[1:00:15.500 --> 1:00:18.500]  Bohemian Grove member confronted in telephone interview.
[1:00:18.500 --> 1:00:21.500]  That is coming up.
[1:00:21.500 --> 1:00:24.500]  Aaron Zelman, here's the preservation of firearms ownership.
[1:00:24.500 --> 1:00:27.500]  Coming up in the third hour, Celica Stillo.
[1:00:27.500 --> 1:00:30.500]  Talking about government-running hit squads in the US.
[1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:32.500]  Latin American and Mexican hit squads.
[1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:34.500]  Controlled by the globalists, finally in the Houston Chronicle.
[1:00:34.500 --> 1:00:37.500]  But right now, news blitz until the bottom of the hour.
[1:00:37.500 --> 1:00:41.500]  Then intense phone blitz where I'm going to take a lot of your calls in 30 minutes.
[1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:42.500]  That's the game plan.
[1:00:42.500 --> 1:00:44.500]  Let's see if I can do it.
[1:00:44.500 --> 1:00:52.500]  Oil pushed above $127 a barrel for the first time today.
[1:00:52.500 --> 1:01:01.500]  And of course, major institutions like Chase Manhattan City Bank are saying $200 a barrel oil by the end of this year.
[1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:03.500]  I don't know if they're going to be right.
[1:01:03.500 --> 1:01:07.500]  But ladies and gentlemen, this is unbelievably bad.
[1:01:07.500 --> 1:01:10.500]  Oil prices soared more than $3 a barrel.
[1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:14.500]  Surpassing $127 for the first time Friday.
[1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:21.500]  And putting more pressure on already lofty gasoline and diesel prices ahead of the summer driving season in the northern hemisphere.
[1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:23.500]  Also pushing oil prices up.
[1:01:23.500 --> 1:01:33.500]  Respeculation that China's demand for diesel needed to fuel its power plants would rise due to the reconstruction efforts after this week's earthquakes that have now killed 50 plus thousand people.
[1:01:33.500 --> 1:01:43.500]  An upward revision of an oil price forecast by Investment Bank Goldman Sachs of $107 to $141 a barrel for the second half of the year bare minimum.
[1:01:43.500 --> 1:02:00.500]  Light sweet crude for June delivery on New York Mercantile Exchange rose as high as $127.82 a barrel in electronic trading by afternoon in Europe before retreating to $127.55 up from Tuesday's close of $124.12.
[1:02:00.500 --> 1:02:12.500]  All right, the previous all time high for oil was 126.98 a barrel set on Tuesday of this week.
[1:02:12.500 --> 1:02:24.500]  Again, what other show do we tell you two years before what would happen and even the months it would happen early 2008 we said you'd have $20, $125 barrel.
[1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:30.500]  Said so and then by the end of the year 200 if they're correct because we have moles inside Bilderberg.
[1:02:30.500 --> 1:02:31.500]  We didn't this year.
[1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:37.500]  It looks like I Tucker and Esteline aren't even sure and we're going to find out.
[1:02:37.500 --> 1:02:46.500]  You'll find out here first whether they really met last week in Athens and we missed it vital Intel failure that we were unable to do this.
[1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:49.500]  First time in 35 years we haven't gotten the Intel.
[1:02:49.500 --> 1:02:50.500]  This is the case.
[1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:55.500]  See, I said I wouldn't belabor of an article because I got like 50 of them here, but probably more.
[1:02:55.500 --> 1:02:59.500]  But how do you not give everybody the full spectrum analysis of a piece?
[1:02:59.500 --> 1:03:03.500]  Oh my gosh, this is so horrible.
[1:03:03.500 --> 1:03:04.500]  And this is tough.
[1:03:04.500 --> 1:03:06.500]  I mean, it's tough to fill my gas tank up.
[1:03:06.500 --> 1:03:15.500]  I don't know about you, but I'm paying like I got a six cylinder car and $70, $78 to fill it.
[1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:17.500]  And that's why I got a little bit left in the tank.
[1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:19.500]  I haven't run it all the way down lately to see what it does.
[1:03:19.500 --> 1:03:21.500]  I mean, this is insane.
[1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:28.500]  What about people that have got 10 cylinder dodged trucks?
[1:03:28.500 --> 1:03:34.500]  But nowhere in this article does it mention why the main reason you're paying this much for oil.
[1:03:34.500 --> 1:03:37.500]  They scheduled to devalue the dollar.
[1:03:37.500 --> 1:03:39.500]  It's all dollar devaluation.
[1:03:39.500 --> 1:03:41.500]  You actually read what OPEX putting out in press releases.
[1:03:41.500 --> 1:03:43.500]  They're saying, look, we're not raising oil prices.
[1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:44.500]  We're holding them the same.
[1:03:44.500 --> 1:03:45.500]  We'd like to increase.
[1:03:45.500 --> 1:03:51.500]  People are actually paying right around the same amount they were paying four years ago in Europe.
[1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:55.500]  Now they're playing some refinery shenanigans in some areas of England and Germany and it's gone up a bit.
[1:03:55.500 --> 1:04:00.500]  But China quake death toll could reach 50,000 AP.
[1:04:00.500 --> 1:04:12.500]  Again, I felt sorry for myself that I had no shoes until I saw a man who had no feet.
[1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:19.500]  You're out there unhappy because you've got your video games and your movies and you live in a little apartment and you don't have a lot of extra money.
[1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:21.500]  But look, you eat like a hog.
[1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:22.500]  I do too.
[1:04:22.500 --> 1:04:24.500]  We live better than these third world people.
[1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:26.500]  You got all this entertainment and you don't appreciate it.
[1:04:26.500 --> 1:04:29.500]  You don't start living until you start appreciating things.
[1:04:29.500 --> 1:04:39.500]  Myanmar, 50 plus thousand dead and counting from the cyclone, the hurricane, the tornado, whatever you want to call it.
[1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:43.500]  What about China now, 50,000 dead?
[1:04:43.500 --> 1:04:45.500]  We'll come back with this and a lot more.
[1:04:45.500 --> 1:05:11.500]  Thank God you got a good.

[1:06:47.500 --> 1:06:50.900]  but there's no such thing as a little bit dead.
[1:06:50.900 --> 1:06:54.980]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[1:06:54.980 --> 1:06:58.620]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time tested.
[1:06:58.620 --> 1:07:02.260]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[1:07:02.260 --> 1:07:05.500]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[1:07:05.500 --> 1:07:10.020]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the
[1:07:10.020 --> 1:07:11.020]  disease that we see.
[1:07:11.020 --> 1:07:14.620]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal form it's like Cardivite and you see someone
[1:07:14.620 --> 1:07:19.500]  who could barely walk up a hill, now going for regular jog a few months later, we know
[1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:20.500]  we're doing something right.
[1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:21.980]  It's a well thought out formula.
[1:07:21.980 --> 1:07:26.900]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function
[1:07:26.900 --> 1:07:27.900]  is dead on.
[1:07:27.900 --> 1:07:32.220]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation
[1:07:32.220 --> 1:07:33.220]  problems.
[1:07:33.220 --> 1:07:34.220]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[1:07:34.220 --> 1:07:44.580]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[1:07:44.580 --> 1:07:50.740]  That toll free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[1:07:50.740 --> 1:07:53.460]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:07:53.460 --> 1:08:10.580]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:10.580 --> 1:08:16.100]  He's been trained instinctively to avoid conflict, to avoid standing up, to always procrastinate
[1:08:16.100 --> 1:08:21.740]  and they engage in these little mind games with themselves where they'll go, I mean,
[1:08:21.740 --> 1:08:25.780]  I talk to people at events, things I go to and all the people talking about gas prices
[1:08:25.780 --> 1:08:28.020]  and they go, well, I ride the bus so I don't care.
[1:08:28.020 --> 1:08:33.060]  I ride my bike so I don't care or, well, the stock market, you know, is going to go down.
[1:08:33.060 --> 1:08:34.060]  Well, I don't care.
[1:08:34.060 --> 1:08:35.540]  I don't own stocks.
[1:08:35.540 --> 1:08:39.060]  When the stock market goes down, that affects the businesses that employ you and ends up
[1:08:39.060 --> 1:08:42.980]  affecting you and it affects other people that do have the stocks that'll be buying
[1:08:42.980 --> 1:08:47.860]  products from you or products from where you work or what you do.
[1:08:47.860 --> 1:08:54.580]  When you have the cost of fuel, when 80 plus percent, you can debate the numbers, 84, 87,
[1:08:54.580 --> 1:08:58.380]  I see different numbers, but it's 80 plus percent of everything shipped in this country.
[1:08:58.380 --> 1:08:59.380]  Everything.
[1:08:59.380 --> 1:09:06.780]  Light bulbs, your shoes, your mousse, the hairspray, whatever women use, lipstick, screwdrivers,
[1:09:06.780 --> 1:09:07.780]  everything.
[1:09:07.780 --> 1:09:16.020]  Food, lettuce, tomatoes, beef, chicken, all of it is shipped and it just compounds and
[1:09:16.020 --> 1:09:17.020]  compounds.
[1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:20.900]  But have you noticed there, the media is telling us there's not much inflation.
[1:09:20.900 --> 1:09:23.620]  That's a complete lie.
[1:09:23.620 --> 1:09:28.620]  Now, finally, some mainstream media is admitting double digit inflation.
[1:09:28.620 --> 1:09:33.780]  Double digit, ladies and gentlemen, the Federal Reserve still claims it's at 7 percent.
[1:09:33.780 --> 1:09:41.140]  Meanwhile, China quake death toll could reach 50,000 troops, dug burial pits in the quake
[1:09:41.140 --> 1:09:46.940]  shattered town, black smoke poured from the crematorium chimneys elsewhere in central
[1:09:46.940 --> 1:09:51.980]  China, as priorities began shifting Thursday from the hurt of survivors of dealing with
[1:09:51.980 --> 1:09:52.980]  the dead.
[1:09:52.980 --> 1:10:01.660]  Officials said the final toll could be more than double the 50,000, 100,000 dead could
[1:10:01.660 --> 1:10:02.660]  be the number.
[1:10:02.660 --> 1:10:06.460]  50,000 right now, just like Myanmar, they're saying it could be a half a million that they
[1:10:06.460 --> 1:10:08.740]  don't know because the government won't let them in.
[1:10:08.740 --> 1:10:11.420]  And then they talk for the first week, they won't let food and supplies in.
[1:10:11.420 --> 1:10:12.580]  They're an evil government.
[1:10:12.580 --> 1:10:13.940]  They're a junta.
[1:10:13.940 --> 1:10:16.780]  The military won't trust their other commanders and let them in.
[1:10:16.780 --> 1:10:17.780]  What did our government do?
[1:10:17.780 --> 1:10:18.780]  They all act the same.
[1:10:18.780 --> 1:10:20.260]  They're all scum.
[1:10:20.260 --> 1:10:27.100]  As the massive military led recovery operation inch further into regions cut off by Monday's
[1:10:27.100 --> 1:10:30.700]  quake, the government sought to enlist the public's health with an appeal for everything
[1:10:30.700 --> 1:10:36.540]  from hammers to cranes, and then a turnabout began accepting foreign aid missions for the
[1:10:36.540 --> 1:10:42.100]  first regional rival Japan.
[1:10:42.100 --> 1:10:47.460]  Let me just add that there have been a few western nations, especially the United States,
[1:10:47.460 --> 1:10:51.180]  where there have been big disasters before, and where the government trusted the people,
[1:10:51.180 --> 1:10:56.340]  the people trusted the government, the government was very small, and there'd be an emergency.
[1:10:56.340 --> 1:11:01.980]  They had floods, the famous floods almost 80 years ago, 80 plus years ago in Louisiana,
[1:11:01.980 --> 1:11:08.380]  Mississippi, up into Tennessee, and, I mean, the Mississippi went out of its banks for
[1:11:08.380 --> 1:11:16.820]  just thousands of square miles, and they fixed it so fast it'd make your head spin because
[1:11:16.820 --> 1:11:18.380]  the citizens got involved.
[1:11:18.380 --> 1:11:19.780]  But see, government's into control.
[1:11:19.780 --> 1:11:23.780]  They can't have the image of citizens pouring into New Orleans and saving people.
[1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:27.300]  They had had the military lock it down, go in and do gun confiscation, hold the food
[1:11:27.300 --> 1:11:31.260]  for five days, ten yards from the people in the super dome, let them get raped and killed
[1:11:31.260 --> 1:11:32.460]  inside.
[1:11:32.460 --> 1:11:33.700]  That's what government does.
[1:11:33.700 --> 1:11:39.140]  There's video of the police making women show their brass to get aid.
[1:11:39.140 --> 1:11:45.140]  The New Orleans police, more than 90 percent, walked off the job that night when it hit.
[1:11:45.140 --> 1:11:46.900]  That's who they are now.
[1:11:46.900 --> 1:11:50.860]  Cops would have never walked off the job just 30, 40 years ago.
[1:11:50.860 --> 1:11:53.940]  They were angels compared to them now.
[1:11:53.940 --> 1:11:57.700]  I mean, look, any time there was a mass shooting 30, 40, 50 years ago, the cops rushed in in
[1:11:57.700 --> 1:11:59.220]  minutes.
[1:11:59.220 --> 1:12:03.620]  They didn't wait around to put body armor on and urinate on themselves in cowardice and
[1:12:03.620 --> 1:12:04.620]  bed wet.
[1:12:04.620 --> 1:12:07.100]  I mean, you look at the cops and there's a mass shooting now, they're so afraid, they'll
[1:12:07.100 --> 1:12:09.820]  be like 500 yards away, cowering all scared.
[1:12:09.820 --> 1:12:14.580]  I mean, men used to just go, oh, yes, a chance to fight, ah, just go charging in.
[1:12:14.580 --> 1:12:19.060]  It is that the cops didn't have training and didn't know how to do things properly before.
[1:12:19.060 --> 1:12:29.380]  They weren't cowardly little, little weaklings, you know, four and a half hours in Blacksburg,
[1:12:29.380 --> 1:12:35.380]  four hours, 15 minutes waiting in Columbine.
[1:12:35.380 --> 1:12:39.820]  So scared of teenagers with guns, turns out it was really black ops inside.
[1:12:39.820 --> 1:12:40.900]  It wasn't cowardice.
[1:12:40.900 --> 1:12:42.580]  The feds were carrying out that attack.
[1:12:42.580 --> 1:12:46.020]  Blacksburg, we can't prove though the evidence points at it.
[1:12:46.020 --> 1:12:50.620]  Oh, you don't know how they do it, just as I told you, the day it happened, how they
[1:12:50.620 --> 1:12:56.500]  did it, they now admit that in Russia, in Beeslawn, it was special forces, dressed up
[1:12:56.500 --> 1:13:02.660]  like terrorists, they go in and then they stage blowing up the wall, shooting people
[1:13:02.660 --> 1:13:07.780]  inside, then they always escape out the back, jumping trucks, the military outside, lets
[1:13:07.780 --> 1:13:08.780]  them escape.
[1:13:08.780 --> 1:13:12.460]  Then they take some political prisoners they've had in jails for months and shoot them and
[1:13:12.460 --> 1:13:17.140]  throw them into the pile and then find one psychiatric patient drugged up and take him
[1:13:17.140 --> 1:13:18.140]  out for a show trial.
[1:13:18.140 --> 1:13:23.700]  By the way, that came out and eight reporters that reported on it were all murdered in Moscow,
[1:13:23.700 --> 1:13:28.020]  double-capped to the head.
[1:13:28.020 --> 1:13:33.100]  Mainstream news, staged, you only know how Putin staged the theater deal.
[1:13:33.100 --> 1:13:36.620]  You get 10 guys in there in masks, then they evacuate out the back, the Russian troops
[1:13:36.620 --> 1:13:38.700]  go in and spray opium gas on them.
[1:13:38.700 --> 1:13:45.820]  They killed what, 140 something of the 180 that died, go pull it up, it's all admitted.
[1:13:45.820 --> 1:13:53.020]  That's how you run a black op on the idiot public.
[1:13:53.020 --> 1:13:56.100]  I'm sorry I'm digressing, that was Columbine.
[1:13:56.100 --> 1:13:59.940]  They contained Blacksburg too well for us to be able to actually find out what happened
[1:13:59.940 --> 1:14:03.980]  though if I went through it, see, I said I cover all the news, I'm not, I'm digressing.
[1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:11.300]  This quake death toll could reach 50,000, McCain believes Iraq war can be won by 2013
[1:14:11.300 --> 1:14:12.300]  AP.
[1:14:12.300 --> 1:14:13.300]  What's that about?
[1:14:13.300 --> 1:14:17.620]  See, it's always, oh, we'll be back by Christmas in eight months, we promise.
[1:14:17.620 --> 1:14:23.100]  And then oh, we'll start in, you know, in 2005, we'll pull out, oh, we're gonna pull
[1:14:23.100 --> 1:14:28.380]  out in 2007 now, but you can't give a timetable, oh, we'll be out in 2009 now, but oh, we'll
[1:14:28.380 --> 1:14:33.940]  be out in 2013 now, oh, we'll be out in 2015, oh, we'll be out in 2020, oh, we'll be out
[1:14:33.940 --> 1:14:40.020]  in 2020, oh, we'll be out in 2030, oh, see, they put it into a process.
[1:14:40.020 --> 1:14:44.340]  That's a Delphi scam technique of, okay, we're gonna do what you want, just let us do the
[1:14:44.340 --> 1:14:46.380]  process.
[1:14:46.380 --> 1:14:52.180]  Come on, we got a surge, it's working, the numbers come in, no, it's actually far worse.
[1:14:52.180 --> 1:14:56.180]  We're getting hit by Al-Qaeda out of Iran right now, wait a minute, Iran's not Al-Qaeda,
[1:14:56.180 --> 1:14:57.180]  there's Shiites.
[1:14:57.180 --> 1:15:03.500]  Now shut up, and then McCain says to Betrayus in front of a few weeks ago in the Senate,
[1:15:03.500 --> 1:15:05.900]  he says, is it not true that Iran is with Al-Qaeda?
[1:15:05.900 --> 1:15:10.380]  Betrayus says, yes, they are Al-Qaeda, and McCain says, see, I was right, and everyone
[1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:13.380]  goes, that's right, they are Al-Qaeda.
[1:15:13.380 --> 1:15:17.780]  I mean, it's, we live in a lot, but the public can't find the U.S. on a map, doesn't know
[1:15:17.780 --> 1:15:22.700]  how many continents there are, you can give the general public the name of water, scientific,
[1:15:22.700 --> 1:15:27.260]  they'll run, screamy thinking it's a chemical weapon, they just, it's a group of idiots,
[1:15:27.260 --> 1:15:30.700]  and they're, so the big bad boys that want the power, they're gonna rape you, you got
[1:15:30.700 --> 1:15:33.900]  that?
[1:15:33.900 --> 1:15:38.940]  We're gonna finance thousands of Mexican radio stations about how to bring down America,
[1:15:38.940 --> 1:15:43.940]  and open the door up, then have a few staged events a couple times a year to arrest a few
[1:15:43.940 --> 1:15:48.580]  thousand illegals, three million illegals, a million legals come in every year, it's
[1:15:48.580 --> 1:15:53.820]  all about theater, the whole world, the stage, and each of us, player upon it.
[1:15:53.820 --> 1:15:59.220]  Oil pushed above 127, China quick death toll, McCain believes Iraq war can be won by 2013,
[1:15:59.220 --> 1:16:03.620]  it's gotta stay the course till then now.
[1:16:03.620 --> 1:16:07.780]  Another pity party article, they got Peggy Noon in the Wall Street Journal, China Republican
[1:16:07.780 --> 1:16:10.860]  Party could be destroyed forever, it's falling apart, it's over.
[1:16:10.860 --> 1:16:14.780]  Yeah, because you're not real conservative, you're a bunch of gun grabbing, open border
[1:16:14.780 --> 1:16:19.660]  promoting, neural border trash, and that's because it's a globalist policy, so both parties
[1:16:19.660 --> 1:16:22.340]  are gonna be for it.
[1:16:22.340 --> 1:16:31.380]  L.A. jury convicts Hollywood Private Eye and racketeering case, 64, Anthony Palacano,
[1:16:31.380 --> 1:16:36.100]  64 was accused of wiretapping stars at the Sylvester Stallone, had running the names
[1:16:36.100 --> 1:16:40.380]  of others such as Gary Shandling, Kevin Nealon, through law enforcement databases to help
[1:16:40.380 --> 1:16:45.660]  clients, legal, and other disputes, what do you think police scanners do on those little
[1:16:45.660 --> 1:16:50.700]  scanner cameras that scan all our plates, that violates law right there, what law?
[1:16:50.700 --> 1:16:56.380]  And he's gonna spend a long time in prison, he hadn't been sentenced yet, but it came
[1:16:56.380 --> 1:17:06.740]  out in court that Palacano recommended a hit to kill Aaron Rousseau.
[1:17:06.740 --> 1:17:13.740]  Very interesting, that was in the New York Times, Bush in Saudi Arabia to discuss oil,
[1:17:13.740 --> 1:17:16.860]  President Bush on a one day visit to Saudi Arabia is taking his second stab Friday at
[1:17:16.860 --> 1:17:21.340]  getting oil rich nation to increase production and drive down soaring gasoline prices, hurting
[1:17:21.340 --> 1:17:23.660]  U.S. consumers.
[1:17:23.660 --> 1:17:28.340]  By the way folks, the British run Saudi Arabia, the Anglo-American Rothschild arm, runs it
[1:17:28.340 --> 1:17:33.860]  and so this is for outward consumption, kind of like Barack Obama giving speeches about
[1:17:33.860 --> 1:17:37.180]  getting out of NAFTA and then he put out a press release and said, don't worry, I'm
[1:17:37.180 --> 1:17:43.100]  just saying that, I'm not going to, that's just for the public.
[1:17:43.100 --> 1:17:48.460]  You gotta laugh at it, Pentagon carpet bombs, the opposition in cyberspace, Kurt Nemo, he's
[1:17:48.460 --> 1:17:52.300]  got links to all the mainstream articles, you gotta go read this, the Pentagon says
[1:17:52.300 --> 1:17:56.260]  they want to be able to take over every U.S. computer, shut down all computers, quote,
[1:17:56.260 --> 1:18:00.140]  fight anti-America propaganda, hey, you're the guys getting rid of our borders and our
[1:18:00.140 --> 1:18:01.140]  sovereignty.
[1:18:01.140 --> 1:18:06.340]  So that's the big hoax, they're the ones that are anti-America and they admit that it is
[1:18:06.340 --> 1:18:11.940]  larger than the Manhattan Project has been going on for six years and is a giant program
[1:18:11.940 --> 1:18:17.260]  engaging with hundreds of thousands of government and contract employees, quote, preparing to
[1:18:17.260 --> 1:18:20.420]  quote, take down the web.
[1:18:20.420 --> 1:18:23.820]  Now DARPA could go ahead and just shut down the hubs if they wanted to but that's not
[1:18:23.820 --> 1:18:27.660]  what they want, what's hard, it's easy to shut it down, it's hard to go selectively
[1:18:27.660 --> 1:18:30.620]  attack tens of thousands of websites.
[1:18:30.620 --> 1:18:34.860]  You can preset AI computers to kind of go out and do it but then people can do workarounds
[1:18:34.860 --> 1:18:40.300]  around it, it takes project managers full time just to take down, I mean, to take down
[1:18:40.300 --> 1:18:44.420]  info wars and prison planning, I'm not challenging hackers or do it, I know you can.
[1:18:44.420 --> 1:18:49.420]  You know, we've got multiple 4-5 server backups, CDN backups, we're trying to get more capital
[1:18:49.420 --> 1:18:53.780]  to add more backups to it because we want to survive the initial Pentagon attack.
[1:18:53.780 --> 1:18:58.700]  When they set up, when they stage 9-11, watch, you'll see the web go down all over, selectively,
[1:18:58.700 --> 1:19:04.300]  just like they shut down most of the, quote, Arab, you know, real, Wahhabist al-Qaeda websites,
[1:19:04.300 --> 1:19:06.600]  thousands got shut down the two days before the attacks.
[1:19:06.600 --> 1:19:09.980]  They couldn't have real Wahhabists saying we didn't do this but a lot of them still
[1:19:09.980 --> 1:19:13.180]  got a message out saying you didn't, then they just used other fake messages saying
[1:19:13.180 --> 1:19:15.100]  they did.
[1:19:15.100 --> 1:19:19.500]  So that'll be another tip when they set off a nuke or release bird flu or whatever, notice
[1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:24.780]  that the alternative sites, if you see a bunch of alternative sites go down, no, they're
[1:19:24.780 --> 1:19:26.820]  about to attack.
[1:19:26.820 --> 1:19:30.940]  Now they'll probably war game off that intel hole I just brought out, I shouldn't even
[1:19:30.940 --> 1:19:34.980]  bring stuff, I'm sure they've already foreseen that, so they may even bring it down minutes
[1:19:34.980 --> 1:19:39.420]  before the attack but you need to get screenshots of that and document that so when the web
[1:19:39.420 --> 1:19:43.980]  goes back up later, we can prove it, just like they mass the troops in the months before
[1:19:43.980 --> 1:19:50.780]  the attacks on Afghanistan, another key part, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[1:19:50.780 --> 1:19:52.500]  Hey Emily, wow, you look great.
[1:19:52.500 --> 1:19:55.940]  I feel great, I've been using Medi-Clin's colon cleanse.
[1:19:55.940 --> 1:19:56.940]  Really?
[1:19:56.940 --> 1:19:57.940]  What is it?
[1:19:57.940 --> 1:19:58.940]  How does it work?
[1:19:58.940 --> 1:20:02.020]  Medi-Clin's is a natural fiber therapy with ground flax seed, psyllium, and bentonite
[1:20:02.020 --> 1:20:04.660]  clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[1:20:04.660 --> 1:20:08.860]  Medi-Clin's is easy to use without being intrusive, you take two tablespoons of Medi-Clin's powder
[1:20:08.860 --> 1:20:12.420]  mixed with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[1:20:12.420 --> 1:20:13.420]  That's it?
[1:20:13.420 --> 1:20:15.020]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[1:20:15.020 --> 1:20:20.020]  It is easy, plus the FDA says flax seed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause,
[1:20:20.020 --> 1:20:22.900]  weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[1:20:22.900 --> 1:20:24.820]  It helps with all of those elements?
[1:20:24.820 --> 1:20:25.820]  That's amazing.
[1:20:25.820 --> 1:20:31.580]  And the bentonite clay in Medi-Clin's eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[1:20:31.580 --> 1:20:33.380]  Wow, where can I buy Medi-Clin's?
[1:20:33.380 --> 1:20:39.780]  A one-month supply is available online at Medi-Clin's.com, that's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E.com.

[1:20:51.420 --> 1:20:55.300]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:20:55.300 --> 1:21:00.220]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:21:00.220 --> 1:21:04.700]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population
[1:21:04.700 --> 1:21:08.980]  of the U.S., though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest
[1:21:08.980 --> 1:21:13.060]  have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice.
[1:21:13.060 --> 1:21:16.700]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[1:21:16.700 --> 1:21:21.100]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:21:21.100 --> 1:21:23.860]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:21:23.860 --> 1:21:28.380]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[1:21:28.380 --> 1:21:33.060]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[1:21:33.060 --> 1:21:38.060]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority
[1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:40.620]  that has now been delegated to us.
[1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:49.020]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com, that's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G, them.com, the message of

[1:22:49.460 --> 1:22:53.980]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[1:22:53.980 --> 1:22:57.940]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at
[1:22:57.940 --> 1:22:58.940]  the pump.
[1:22:58.940 --> 1:23:02.980]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas
[1:23:02.980 --> 1:23:03.980]  mileage.
[1:23:03.980 --> 1:23:08.300]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a
[1:23:08.300 --> 1:23:13.940]  complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage
[1:23:13.940 --> 1:23:15.500]  and only one tank full.
[1:23:15.500 --> 1:23:20.060]  To engine treatment, not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[1:23:20.060 --> 1:23:23.980]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[1:23:23.980 --> 1:23:29.180]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment,
[1:23:29.180 --> 1:23:31.820]  which is a $12.95 value free.
[1:23:31.820 --> 1:23:41.300]  Call 888-888-3139, use SFR1, or check them out online at OilCompanySecret.com.
[1:23:41.300 --> 1:23:43.300]  That's OilCompanySecret.com.
[1:23:43.300 --> 1:23:58.740]  Your satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back, and it's safe for all cars, act now.
[1:23:58.740 --> 1:24:03.620]  By the way, they sold out for the Saturday showing for truth rising.
[1:24:03.620 --> 1:24:10.100]  Now, they're holding 20 tickets at the door for the day up, so you'll be able to get in
[1:24:10.100 --> 1:24:14.340]  probably.
[1:24:14.340 --> 1:24:17.740]  They've got some tickets left for the Sunday showing.
[1:24:17.740 --> 1:24:20.820]  It's a big nice theater downtown.
[1:24:20.820 --> 1:24:24.700]  They got two theaters in there, it's in their big one.
[1:24:24.700 --> 1:24:30.580]  It's called the Ritz, Salamone Draft House Ritz.
[1:24:30.580 --> 1:24:31.580]  Very devilish, though.
[1:24:31.580 --> 1:24:34.180]  They serve alcohol there, so watch out.
[1:24:34.180 --> 1:24:36.700]  Man, listen to this.
[1:24:36.700 --> 1:24:46.860]  This is my anthem right here, if you think I sit around.
[1:24:46.860 --> 1:24:54.700]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[1:24:54.700 --> 1:25:04.180]  We're here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:25:04.180 --> 1:25:13.180]  Let's continue with the news here.
[1:25:13.180 --> 1:25:19.220]  Planned U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran, well, before I get into that, Pentagon, carpet bombs,
[1:25:19.220 --> 1:25:23.180]  the opposition, and cyberspace, that's illegal for them to do.
[1:25:23.180 --> 1:25:27.260]  But they claim, oh, we do it, foreign assets, but then they admit they're doing it domestically.
[1:25:27.260 --> 1:25:28.820]  And Congress has said that's illegal.
[1:25:28.820 --> 1:25:29.820]  Stop it.
[1:25:29.820 --> 1:25:32.140]  And the White House says, we don't stop anything.
[1:25:32.140 --> 1:25:35.700]  By the way, you can't see our continuity of government plan, though the cover page says
[1:25:35.700 --> 1:25:41.020]  you're under martial law and that we're the boss, and that means all the foreign countries
[1:25:41.020 --> 1:25:46.300]  and corporations that basically buy percentages of the executive.
[1:25:46.300 --> 1:25:49.540]  Pentagon, carpet bombs, the opposition, and cyberspace, totally illegal.
[1:25:49.540 --> 1:25:54.940]  Yeah, you sent comm goons sitting around blogging and posting all over the web and admitting
[1:25:54.940 --> 1:25:55.940]  what you're doing.
[1:25:55.940 --> 1:25:59.580]  You're engaged in felonies, Baba, targeting the U.S. population.
[1:25:59.580 --> 1:26:04.300]  And I know, it's all about lawlessness, oh, my gosh, I forgot the top story today.
[1:26:04.300 --> 1:26:06.940]  I can't even keep track of it all anymore.
[1:26:06.940 --> 1:26:12.780]  Holy mackerel, John, did you get those IMs I sent you early this morning, the audio clip
[1:26:12.780 --> 1:26:18.900]  of Rumsfeld saying that they need another terror attack in the U.S.?
[1:26:18.900 --> 1:26:19.900]  You're kidding.
[1:26:19.900 --> 1:26:20.900]  You're joking.
[1:26:20.900 --> 1:26:22.020]  Well, I IM'd it to you.
[1:26:22.020 --> 1:26:24.340]  My IMs have been acting really funny.
[1:26:24.340 --> 1:26:26.540]  You didn't get those.
[1:26:26.540 --> 1:26:31.700]  Yeah, they're pages with Rumsfeld.
[1:26:31.700 --> 1:26:32.700]  You have them.
[1:26:32.700 --> 1:26:34.500]  Oh, holy mackerel.
[1:26:34.500 --> 1:26:36.420]  See, that's a problem here.
[1:26:36.420 --> 1:26:38.260]  I can't keep track of any of it anymore.
[1:26:38.260 --> 1:26:40.420]  It's just a swirling evidence everywhere.
[1:26:40.420 --> 1:26:44.060]  Oh, before I do that, let me do this, then I'm going to come back and do the Rumsfeld
[1:26:44.060 --> 1:26:45.060]  thing and then your calls.
[1:26:45.060 --> 1:26:48.860]  I promise I'm going to get your calls.
[1:26:48.860 --> 1:26:49.860]  Where is that?
[1:26:49.860 --> 1:26:54.420]  It says Alex Jones lies, and it was a YouTube video I saw this morning and had just been
[1:26:54.420 --> 1:27:00.540]  posted that somebody emailed me.
[1:27:00.540 --> 1:27:03.620]  And I'm not going to give the exact URL because I don't want to give it attention because
[1:27:03.620 --> 1:27:07.580]  it'll just make it a top video and then weak minds will be deceived by it.
[1:27:07.580 --> 1:27:11.100]  And again, this isn't about me being attacked or me being lied about.
[1:27:11.100 --> 1:27:12.100]  I don't.
[1:27:12.100 --> 1:27:17.900]  I mean, when I'm on CNN being attacked, I didn't play it this week, even though most
[1:27:17.900 --> 1:27:21.380]  talk show hosts would puff up and make a big deal about it and talk about it at Nazium.
[1:27:21.380 --> 1:27:22.780]  I don't care.
[1:27:22.780 --> 1:27:24.500]  I mean, it's about the murder of Palfrey.
[1:27:24.500 --> 1:27:28.220]  I should have talked about it and how they're covering it up and I'm so busy covering everything
[1:27:28.220 --> 1:27:29.220]  else.
[1:27:29.220 --> 1:27:30.380]  I don't.
[1:27:30.380 --> 1:27:33.460]  So I mentioned this so you understand how they're manipulating you.
[1:27:33.460 --> 1:27:35.460]  You understand how they're deceiving you.
[1:27:35.460 --> 1:27:42.500]  Now I had to watch this video three times this morning to even figure out how I'm lying,
[1:27:42.500 --> 1:27:44.700]  how I'm supposedly lying.
[1:27:44.700 --> 1:27:48.140]  Now I'm not that smart, but I'm also not really stupid.
[1:27:48.140 --> 1:27:51.060]  I'm some kind of street smart, as they say.
[1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:57.140]  And so if I couldn't figure out how I was lying, that means the person that made this,
[1:27:57.140 --> 1:28:04.700]  and my point is I was not lying, is that this is designed so someone watching it can't really
[1:28:04.700 --> 1:28:08.780]  figure out how I'm lying either, but then the general public's designed to do that.
[1:28:08.780 --> 1:28:12.860]  If they don't understand something, they just go, oh, well, Alex must be lying.
[1:28:12.860 --> 1:28:18.780]  I don't know what this means or what this is saying, but it says he's a liar.
[1:28:18.780 --> 1:28:23.300]  I don't know if this person knows how sophisticated their disinformation is or if they're just
[1:28:23.300 --> 1:28:30.620]  such an idiot and delusional and trying to make up that I'm lying, that they organically
[1:28:30.620 --> 1:28:36.420]  have engaged in a piece of propaganda genius.
[1:28:36.420 --> 1:28:39.820]  But either way, it's government propaganda because the government's trained people how
[1:28:39.820 --> 1:28:41.620]  to engage in mental gymnastics.
[1:28:41.620 --> 1:28:43.620]  They've trained people how to be in denial.
[1:28:43.620 --> 1:28:45.980]  They've trained people how to deceive themselves.
[1:28:45.980 --> 1:28:48.340]  They've trained people so they're mocking birds.
[1:28:48.340 --> 1:28:50.020]  They're not government agents.
[1:28:50.020 --> 1:28:54.340]  They just go out and engage in intellectual bankruptcy and dishonesty.
[1:28:54.340 --> 1:28:59.340]  And what this video basically does in between me sucking on a bottle and in between me yelling
[1:28:59.340 --> 1:29:05.940]  and screaming and out of context, cutting things together, they imply I'm lying about
[1:29:05.940 --> 1:29:11.900]  the Pentagon not releasing most of its videos and only releasing one after judicial watch
[1:29:11.900 --> 1:29:14.620]  did a foyer for it.
[1:29:14.620 --> 1:29:18.020]  But then we're not lying, they're not releasing it.
[1:29:18.020 --> 1:29:23.220]  They claim that we're lying if I get it right because some of the videos weren't official
[1:29:23.220 --> 1:29:29.500]  surveillance tapes, they were businesses tapes or because a couple of them were released
[1:29:29.500 --> 1:29:30.500]  after the fact.
[1:29:30.500 --> 1:29:36.340]  I don't, again, I'm not lying, but they won't even say how I'm lying.
[1:29:36.340 --> 1:29:37.740]  It just says, oh, he's a liar.
[1:29:37.740 --> 1:29:41.300]  The dumb down public goes, oh, he's a liar.
[1:29:41.300 --> 1:29:51.300]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:29:51.300 --> 1:29:57.460]  It is a big idea, a new world order in the near future.
[1:29:57.460 --> 1:30:04.100]  Earth is dominated by powerful government is known as the builder bird, but their objective
[1:30:04.100 --> 1:30:09.260]  being world domination for thousands of years, their dark order group.
[1:30:09.260 --> 1:30:14.260]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[1:30:14.260 --> 1:30:19.660]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:30:19.660 --> 1:30:24.660]  For the first time in history, the elites plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:30:24.660 --> 1:30:28.980]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:30:28.980 --> 1:30:31.620]  Build a very good, great progress toward a world government.
[1:30:31.620 --> 1:30:34.780]  Most people have no idea they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[1:30:34.780 --> 1:30:35.780]  They're after power.
[1:30:35.780 --> 1:30:36.780]  That's their appellation.

[1:32:19.220 --> 1:32:24.060]  so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[1:32:24.060 --> 1:32:33.580]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song for the heart of America wants this one, go to hempusa.org.

[1:32:57.220 --> 1:33:05.020]  It was filled with a bad, bad thing on 9-11, a bad, bad thing, but being in war planning
[1:33:05.020 --> 1:33:10.620]  so long, what's 3,000 lives when they sacrifice that many troops all the time in a major battle?
[1:33:10.620 --> 1:33:15.140]  It's a bad, bad thing, didn't you boy?
[1:33:15.140 --> 1:33:23.020]  It's a bad, bad thing, baby it's a bad, bad thing, baby it's a bad, bad thing.
[1:33:23.020 --> 1:33:27.940]  Here we love summer so much you thought your little heart was gonna break in two, but
[1:33:27.940 --> 1:33:28.940]  they didn't think so.
[1:33:28.940 --> 1:33:33.180]  You ever try with all your heart and soul to get your love back to you?
[1:33:33.180 --> 1:33:46.540]  It's a bad, bad thing, baby it's a bad, bad thing, baby it's a bad, bad thing.
[1:33:46.540 --> 1:33:51.380]  See I was totally freaked out this morning, hundreds of things racing through my mind
[1:33:51.380 --> 1:34:00.980]  when at like 9 a.m. Paul Watson posted his story of the day.
[1:34:00.980 --> 1:34:06.020]  Thumbs felled on tape, terror attack had restored neocon agenda.
[1:34:06.020 --> 1:34:10.380]  All that's racing through my mind until I see two vans, one that said the invader, the
[1:34:10.380 --> 1:34:16.780]  other that said the race station, and then I went off into a tirade at the start of the
[1:34:16.780 --> 1:34:23.260]  show for 45 minutes on that, forgetting my top story that's on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[1:34:23.260 --> 1:34:26.020]  and we gotta get out to everybody.
[1:34:26.020 --> 1:34:34.620]  Now the media does this, they are focusing in on a few dozen military advisors, the guys
[1:34:34.620 --> 1:34:39.220]  that quote Pentagon gives access and recommends to the media, who the media is always known
[1:34:39.220 --> 1:34:44.220]  or on government payroll, who have always known their operatives, and when I heard this,
[1:34:44.220 --> 1:34:47.300]  the government doesn't release something once they want it released, this is a threat
[1:34:47.300 --> 1:34:48.500]  to everyone.
[1:34:48.500 --> 1:34:52.860]  This is just like Gary Hart writing a letter to Iran saying will stage terror attacks and
[1:34:52.860 --> 1:34:56.820]  blaming on you, don't think because 80% of Americans are against a new war that we won't
[1:34:56.820 --> 1:34:57.820]  do it.
[1:34:57.820 --> 1:35:00.780]  And then we ask Hart, are you saying the government will stage something and he said yes, that's
[1:35:00.780 --> 1:35:03.140]  what I'm saying, they'll blow up a ship.
[1:35:03.140 --> 1:35:07.940]  I mean, a lot of neocons are in denial on the blogs saying he never wrote that letter.
[1:35:07.940 --> 1:35:10.420]  Well we got his fat head on video.
[1:35:10.420 --> 1:35:13.180]  Okay, stick that in your pipe and smoke it.
[1:35:13.180 --> 1:35:17.340]  No amount of your no planers you're paying for running around with fake Hitler mustaches
[1:35:17.340 --> 1:35:20.980]  are gonna make the public think we're a bunch of nuts when you're the nuts, you're the nuts
[1:35:20.980 --> 1:35:24.500]  for going along with this.
[1:35:24.500 --> 1:35:27.180]  No amount of your disinfo is gonna work, okay?
[1:35:27.180 --> 1:35:31.380]  Your black propaganda putting out kooky 9-11 truth stuff to make people think we're nuts.
[1:35:31.380 --> 1:35:34.660]  We got the facts, we got the documents.
[1:35:34.660 --> 1:35:39.340]  We got Republican memos, we got Republican strategists, Republican governors, state strategists,
[1:35:39.340 --> 1:35:40.340]  federal strategists.
[1:35:40.340 --> 1:35:44.940]  We told you four years ago there were Republican memos and we got copies of them where they
[1:35:44.940 --> 1:35:48.740]  said we need to stage another attack or we need another attack.
[1:35:48.740 --> 1:35:54.860]  Now they release this and they keep laughing going, oh, this is off the record, right?
[1:35:54.860 --> 1:35:57.500]  Knowing they were gonna release this later if they had to.
[1:35:57.500 --> 1:36:04.260]  This is nothing compared to billions in fake reporters, fake newscasts, planning fake stories.
[1:36:04.260 --> 1:36:10.180]  It's come out that CNN and Fox are just filled with black-off officers in plain clothes from
[1:36:10.180 --> 1:36:13.100]  Cy Warfare, okay?
[1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:15.300]  And they're involved in your local cities, everything.
[1:36:15.300 --> 1:36:17.940]  And they're criminals, it's all illegal.
[1:36:17.940 --> 1:36:21.540]  But this is a bunch of these guys in Rumsfeld's office and listen to Rumsfeld the way he's
[1:36:21.540 --> 1:36:23.100]  talking, you know, for the public.
[1:36:23.100 --> 1:36:27.500]  I mean, this is all so staged and it's a threat to those of us that know and the neocons will
[1:36:27.500 --> 1:36:31.820]  use this and say, see, look, he really wants us to be disciplined and grown up and, you
[1:36:31.820 --> 1:36:33.340]  know, about it.
[1:36:33.340 --> 1:36:37.500]  Shocking excerpts of confidential recordings, yeah.
[1:36:37.500 --> 1:36:40.860]  Recently released in our Freedom of Information Act featured former Defense Secretary Donald
[1:36:40.860 --> 1:36:46.180]  Rumsfeld talking with top military analyst about how a flagging neocon political agenda
[1:36:46.180 --> 1:36:51.140]  could be successfully restored with the aid of another terrorist attack on America.
[1:36:51.140 --> 1:36:54.740]  Now, the key here is that they're saying it would help.
[1:36:54.740 --> 1:36:56.900]  The key is they're saying it's a good thing.
[1:36:56.900 --> 1:37:00.820]  The key is they're bringing it up and then we have all the, they've written news articles
[1:37:00.820 --> 1:37:02.820]  saying how great 9-11 was.
[1:37:02.820 --> 1:37:05.740]  For those of you that say, why would they stage it, Alex, I don't understand.
[1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:09.340]  Why would they attack themselves to get you to give up all your rights so they could dump
[1:37:09.340 --> 1:37:14.140]  trillions into no-bid contracts so they could set up police state mechanisms and national
[1:37:14.140 --> 1:37:15.140]  ID cards?
[1:37:15.140 --> 1:37:18.260]  I mean, don't you know why Hitler staged attacks?
[1:37:18.260 --> 1:37:21.940]  Don't you know why our government staged attacks before?
[1:37:21.940 --> 1:37:23.460]  It's to get agendas going.
[1:37:23.460 --> 1:37:26.220]  PNAC told us barring a huge terror attack.
[1:37:26.220 --> 1:37:30.860]  The vice president said months before 9-11, unless we have a giant attack, we're not
[1:37:30.860 --> 1:37:32.820]  going to be able to get this agenda through.
[1:37:32.820 --> 1:37:34.220]  But don't listen to me.
[1:37:34.220 --> 1:37:35.420]  Listen to Rumsfeld.
[1:37:35.420 --> 1:37:36.420]  Play clip one.
[1:37:36.420 --> 1:37:50.660]  Well, that's what I was just going to say, I mean, this president is pretty much a victim
[1:37:50.660 --> 1:37:51.660]  of success.
[1:37:51.660 --> 1:38:00.100]  We haven't had an attack here in five years to help the perception of the tragedy so low
[1:38:00.100 --> 1:38:08.700]  in society that it's not surprising that the behavior pattern reflects a low threat assessment.
[1:38:08.700 --> 1:38:16.980]  And the same thing is in Europe, there's a low threat perception.
[1:38:16.980 --> 1:38:24.260]  Correction for that, I suppose, is an attack and when that happens, then everyone gets
[1:38:24.260 --> 1:38:29.580]  energized for another person and it's a shame, we don't have the maturity.
[1:38:29.580 --> 1:38:39.420]  But to recognize the seriousness of the threats, the value, the carnage that can be imposed
[1:38:39.420 --> 1:38:46.820]  on our society is so real and so present and so serious that we think we'd be able to
[1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:47.820]  understand it.
[1:38:47.820 --> 1:38:54.020]  But as a society, obviously, the longer you get away from 9-11, the less.
[1:38:54.020 --> 1:38:56.420]  Okay, so that's the first clip.
[1:38:56.420 --> 1:38:59.940]  You can listen to hours of it if you want on the website.
[1:38:59.940 --> 1:39:03.140]  That links to it in the story on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[1:39:03.140 --> 1:39:04.780]  But let's be clear about this.
[1:39:04.780 --> 1:39:08.300]  This was meant for public consumption, just like the Philadelphia Daily News guy wrote
[1:39:08.300 --> 1:39:12.180]  a story saying how great it was, now we need another attack on Republican memos.
[1:39:12.180 --> 1:39:17.220]  It's a threat to the world, those of us in the know, and definitely released for propaganda
[1:39:17.220 --> 1:39:20.260]  purposes as a public threat to people that have brains.
[1:39:20.260 --> 1:39:25.380]  And then for the cattle, we've got to be realistic, we've got to be adult, and that's why they
[1:39:25.380 --> 1:39:28.580]  admit White House memos have come out that they have fake terror alerts when they're
[1:39:28.580 --> 1:39:29.580]  in political trouble.
[1:39:29.580 --> 1:39:31.180]  Barry Fleischer admitted that.
[1:39:31.180 --> 1:39:37.100]  Press Secretary, the threat level indicators meant to scare us.
[1:39:37.100 --> 1:39:41.700]  The drills, the terror drills, are really to federalize local police and military and
[1:39:41.700 --> 1:39:47.100]  to train you to accept martial law and to create the perception that it's real.
[1:39:47.100 --> 1:39:50.620]  And then they also give it as payments to the private companies that run the drills,
[1:39:50.620 --> 1:39:55.700]  billions of dollars a year per state, an excuse to put cameras in as a control grip.
[1:39:55.700 --> 1:40:01.660]  Now, let's go to the next Justice Sickening clip from the same exchange of the room full
[1:40:01.660 --> 1:40:05.380]  of propagandas running another cutesy psych warfare.
[1:40:05.380 --> 1:40:11.220]  These guys are all former generals, former CIA section chiefs, former Black Ops commanders,
[1:40:11.220 --> 1:40:16.500]  running another snickering one on the cattle they feed on as they destroy the United States.
[1:40:16.500 --> 1:40:18.500]  Let's go back to the traitor enemies of America.
[1:40:18.500 --> 1:40:25.740]  Oh, stop it, stop it, stop it, rewind that again, listen to that.
[1:40:25.740 --> 1:40:26.740]  Is this really off the record?
[1:40:26.740 --> 1:40:27.740]  Then they laugh.
[1:40:27.740 --> 1:40:28.980]  It's a little laugh on us.
[1:40:28.980 --> 1:40:31.500]  You thug gangsters, you make me sick.
[1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:32.500]  Back to them.
[1:40:32.500 --> 1:40:49.100]  This is really off the record, do you think that we, this government can survive, it's
[1:40:49.100 --> 1:40:52.940]  going to be government or they're going to eventually have to go through the dark area
[1:40:52.940 --> 1:40:53.940]  in one life.
[1:40:53.940 --> 1:40:54.940]  You know, we came out of Korea, a civilian raid was really a shared dark area leader.
[1:40:54.940 --> 1:40:55.940]  In the 11 years I was in the 40th time in Korea.
[1:40:55.940 --> 1:40:56.940]  The president was an Army major general in civilian conflict.
[1:40:56.940 --> 1:40:57.940]  They had the highest growth rates.
[1:40:57.940 --> 1:41:04.940]  They did the 88th, I don't know if they, I don't know if they can develop them.
[1:41:04.940 --> 1:41:11.940]  Yeah, but the real question is, and we all hope to see them develop them, but it's very
[1:41:11.940 --> 1:41:12.940]  difficult.
[1:41:12.940 --> 1:41:13.940]  It is very difficult.
[1:41:13.940 --> 1:41:20.940]  I mean, you know, you look at it and you're in any that's far enough to know the answer
[1:41:20.940 --> 1:41:21.940]  to your questions.
[1:41:21.940 --> 1:41:26.940]  I think the answer is they can't, but how do you get that right person?
[1:41:26.940 --> 1:41:40.940]  I mean, a lot of people had steel at their backs, and he wasn't well liked and wasn't
[1:41:40.940 --> 1:41:41.940]  perfect.
[1:41:41.940 --> 1:41:46.620]  He lived in a country for a long period of time and stuff he didn't.
[1:41:46.620 --> 1:41:51.700]  This is where they go on and act like the governments over there run something.
[1:41:51.700 --> 1:41:54.900]  But when in their own policy reports, their complete puppets, the presidents that they
[1:41:54.900 --> 1:41:59.260]  install, run nothing, staged elections, that's why you know this is propaganda.
[1:41:59.260 --> 1:42:00.260]  They're there having a discussion.
[1:42:00.260 --> 1:42:05.540]  Oh, this is off the record, giggle, giggle, and then, you know, this fake candidness.
[1:42:05.540 --> 1:42:07.900]  Oh, we're learning the truth now.
[1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:12.700]  Now, this is what the CENTCOM boys are on the Info Wars page, commenting on this story
[1:42:12.700 --> 1:42:18.660]  about Paul Watson or saying, to us, I hope we do get attacked again, well, don't worry,
[1:42:18.660 --> 1:42:22.700]  your buddies are going to plant bombs or really something, don't worry, so you can grandstand.
[1:42:22.700 --> 1:42:24.740]  I hope we do get attacked again.
[1:42:24.740 --> 1:42:29.620]  I hope they rape your mothers while they're at it.
[1:42:29.620 --> 1:42:34.180]  While they are beheading your children, you can thank Alex Jones, say thank you for turning
[1:42:34.180 --> 1:42:37.780]  me into a coward that can't think for myself.
[1:42:37.780 --> 1:42:38.780]  Thank you.
[1:42:38.780 --> 1:42:40.280]  What a bunch of repulsive idiots.
[1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:46.380]  Do you guys all get your bleepers touched when you were uncles, by your uncles when
[1:42:46.380 --> 1:42:48.820]  you were children, or was it your father?
[1:42:48.820 --> 1:42:52.100]  No, you're the one that thinks about this kind of stuff, bro.
[1:42:52.100 --> 1:42:55.140]  When you find some fresh meat over on our rack, don't you?
[1:42:55.140 --> 1:42:57.780]  Or was it your father, bleep you?
[1:42:57.780 --> 1:43:00.380]  You are not patriots who believe this garbage.
[1:43:00.380 --> 1:43:04.860]  Go effing riddance when they turn you into a prayer rug.
[1:43:04.860 --> 1:43:07.860]  Well, let's talk about prayer rugs.
[1:43:07.860 --> 1:43:13.700]  The Middle East was largely secular in government, had a few corrupt dictators, but they had
[1:43:13.700 --> 1:43:20.980]  colleges and rock music and hotels and wanted tourism.
[1:43:20.980 --> 1:43:28.580]  And then by about 1910 through 1920s, they went in and they decided to break up the tribes
[1:43:28.580 --> 1:43:34.340]  in Saudi Arabia, which was just a desert, wasn't even a country, it was called the Arabias.
[1:43:34.340 --> 1:43:38.420]  And they gave a bunch of hand grenades and weapons to the bin Laden family, who were
[1:43:38.420 --> 1:43:40.820]  their advisors in the area.
[1:43:40.820 --> 1:43:47.540]  And they were just a family that, for the British government, that did a lot of the
[1:43:47.540 --> 1:43:50.940]  packing forum, shipping forum across the desert.
[1:43:50.940 --> 1:43:54.620]  They were a family, kind of a dry goods family, based there at one of the ports.
[1:43:54.620 --> 1:43:56.220]  This is history, if you want to go read it.
[1:43:56.220 --> 1:43:58.340]  Then they got recruited by intelligence.
[1:43:58.340 --> 1:44:02.020]  They'd already done intelligence for the Ottomans before that for the Turks.
[1:44:02.020 --> 1:44:05.220]  And then they also, then they picked a Bedouin tribe that seemed particularly fierce, the
[1:44:05.220 --> 1:44:08.420]  Saads.
[1:44:08.420 --> 1:44:11.940]  And so they set it up and they gave them the whole place and divided it up.
[1:44:11.940 --> 1:44:15.340]  And then by the 40s, there were all these other countries that were doing trade, having
[1:44:15.340 --> 1:44:16.340]  their own oil.
[1:44:16.340 --> 1:44:19.540]  You know, they had guys wearing suits and ties as their presidents.
[1:44:19.540 --> 1:44:25.180]  And they liked Hollywood and wanted to, you know, and they said, uh-uh, buddy, by the
[1:44:25.180 --> 1:44:29.060]  way, you stupid cent com cowards, go get an encyclopedia and read this instead of saying
[1:44:29.060 --> 1:44:30.060]  I'm lying.
[1:44:30.060 --> 1:44:31.060]  Okay.
[1:44:31.060 --> 1:44:32.940]  Don't you tell me I'm with the Arabs.
[1:44:32.940 --> 1:44:34.540]  Don't you tell me I'm with the Muslims.
[1:44:34.540 --> 1:44:39.300]  And don't you tell me I'm with the Wahhabist al-Qaeda.
[1:44:39.300 --> 1:44:41.300]  I'm not the one creating the North American Union.
[1:44:41.300 --> 1:44:43.420]  I'm not the one putting toll roads on existing roads.
[1:44:43.420 --> 1:44:45.100]  I'm not the one getting rid of our borders.
[1:44:45.100 --> 1:44:48.420]  I'm not the one that just reintroduced an amnesty bill in the defense package.
[1:44:48.420 --> 1:44:50.300]  It's probably going to pass this time.
[1:44:50.300 --> 1:44:54.300]  I'm not the one that's destroying our currency.
[1:44:54.300 --> 1:44:56.500]  Shut up and stop denying it.
[1:44:56.500 --> 1:45:00.060]  I'm so sick of you cowardly filth.
[1:45:00.060 --> 1:45:02.260]  And you're so pompous how you're defending America.
[1:45:02.260 --> 1:45:08.060]  You're a low down, dirty dog, you're a bunch of self-righteous bastards.
[1:45:08.060 --> 1:45:11.500]  That's why your bosses went and planted bombs in those buildings thinking it was for America.
[1:45:11.500 --> 1:45:13.580]  The Arabs are so deadly and so dangerous.
[1:45:13.580 --> 1:45:16.940]  We don't do this and they're going to destroy our Christian way of life.
[1:45:16.940 --> 1:45:19.380]  We got to do this to protect Israel.
[1:45:19.380 --> 1:45:24.580]  Pastor Hage following Christian Zionists, folks, guaranteed culprits in all of this
[1:45:24.580 --> 1:45:29.980]  as the front boys.
[1:45:29.980 --> 1:45:30.980]  So sick.
[1:45:30.980 --> 1:45:34.100]  Got a guest coming on about that next week.
[1:45:34.100 --> 1:45:40.740]  But just amazing about Pastor Hage.
[1:45:40.740 --> 1:45:44.340]  I mean that type of follower, that type of idea.
[1:45:44.340 --> 1:45:45.340]  Perfect cult members.
[1:45:45.340 --> 1:45:47.260]  You want to run around?
[1:45:47.260 --> 1:45:50.620]  Since the 40s, our government has shipped in textbooks all over the Middle East teaching
[1:45:50.620 --> 1:45:55.060]  them to be Wahhabis, teaching them to be radical, teaching them to kill the Westerners, teaching
[1:45:55.060 --> 1:45:56.060]  them to...
[1:45:56.060 --> 1:45:59.420]  You see, that's like planting a cancer in somebody.
[1:45:59.420 --> 1:46:00.420]  Sectarian violence, murder.
[1:46:00.420 --> 1:46:02.620]  They used them in Iran.
[1:46:02.620 --> 1:46:03.860]  They used them in Afghanistan.
[1:46:03.860 --> 1:46:05.500]  They used them in Serbia.
[1:46:05.500 --> 1:46:09.060]  They are the siege force.
[1:46:09.060 --> 1:46:14.100]  They are the vanguard of the New World Order.
[1:46:14.100 --> 1:46:17.300]  It's in official government documents.
[1:46:17.300 --> 1:46:23.860]  I had no idea seven years ago, those are my wife's parents, they were going out every
[1:46:23.860 --> 1:46:24.860]  dinner.
[1:46:24.860 --> 1:46:28.700]  They're Democrats at somebody's house and I didn't know.
[1:46:28.700 --> 1:46:29.700]  I'm not going to talk about it.
[1:46:29.700 --> 1:46:33.580]  The point is, you've seen Charlie Wilson's war, well I've met those people because they
[1:46:33.580 --> 1:46:40.700]  live here in Austin.
[1:46:40.700 --> 1:46:47.140]  And they attacked the Russians first, Charlie Wilson's war.
[1:46:47.140 --> 1:46:54.540]  After the Russians invade, the U.S. gets involved and I'm an Easter Bunny.
[1:46:54.540 --> 1:46:59.420]  Look what you let the Wahhabis do to those poor Serbs, you sickening, disgusting people
[1:46:59.420 --> 1:47:03.820]  that have hijacked our military.
[1:47:03.820 --> 1:47:05.220]  All you do is hurt this country.
[1:47:05.220 --> 1:47:06.460]  All you do is destroy us.
[1:47:06.460 --> 1:47:08.860]  We'll never pay back the debt, it's over.
[1:47:08.860 --> 1:47:12.500]  You've totally let the internationalists destroy us while you wrap yourselves in Wal-Mart
[1:47:12.500 --> 1:47:18.700]  made desecrated American flags.
[1:47:18.700 --> 1:47:22.020]  You hope our mothers get raped so we learn to hate the Arabs.
[1:47:22.020 --> 1:47:25.540]  Well, I mean, you know, don't worry, a lot of people's mothers did die when you guys
[1:47:25.540 --> 1:47:27.220]  bombed those towers.
[1:47:27.220 --> 1:47:32.700]  Don't worry, you did kill us.
[1:47:32.700 --> 1:47:35.540]  Don't worry, you know, you flushed the country down the toilet.
[1:47:35.540 --> 1:47:38.820]  You win.
[1:47:38.820 --> 1:47:43.820]  The 1,500 is bankrolled the La Raza radio stations to totally get a foothold.
[1:47:43.820 --> 1:47:44.820]  It's over.
[1:47:44.820 --> 1:47:45.820]  It's gone.
[1:47:45.820 --> 1:47:47.380]  All we can hope is to salvage something.
[1:47:47.380 --> 1:47:48.380]  We're third world guaranteed.
[1:47:48.380 --> 1:47:52.940]  It's just, will it be a high, hyper-fascist dictatorship where they put us in camps or
[1:47:52.940 --> 1:47:58.420]  will we just fall apart and be a bankrupt cesspit?
[1:47:58.420 --> 1:48:02.940]  You better hope you can make enough money to live in a gated community.
[1:48:02.940 --> 1:48:07.380]  That's on the good end, is me getting to live and survive and not be taken to a FEMA camp
[1:48:07.380 --> 1:48:11.980]  and hopefully save something of the country while you bastards just go on with your corporate
[1:48:11.980 --> 1:48:18.180]  bosses raping the country to pieces while telling me that you're the good guys.
[1:48:18.180 --> 1:48:24.260]  I've had it with you and I want you to show all the scum with the May 31st money bomb.
[1:48:24.260 --> 1:48:28.020]  I didn't think of it, it was up for weeks before I even plugged it, but we can't have
[1:48:28.020 --> 1:48:29.820]  something not be a big success.
[1:48:29.820 --> 1:48:30.820]  And you know what?
[1:48:30.820 --> 1:48:32.500]  Why I've never asked for money, I don't know.
[1:48:32.500 --> 1:48:34.500]  Buy my books, buy my video, support us.
[1:48:34.500 --> 1:48:35.820]  I'm signing a lease.
[1:48:35.820 --> 1:48:37.180]  I'm getting a bigger office.
[1:48:37.180 --> 1:48:39.820]  I just signed the preliminary today.
[1:48:39.820 --> 1:48:41.140]  I am going to get better cameras.
[1:48:41.140 --> 1:48:45.780]  You know how much a really decent camera cost, $100,000 to really give you a high quality
[1:48:45.780 --> 1:48:46.780]  and that's what the enemy's got.
[1:48:46.780 --> 1:48:49.140]  Of course, we'll never buy something like that.
[1:48:49.140 --> 1:48:50.820]  Best cameras we got are $6,000.
[1:48:50.820 --> 1:48:55.660]  They're getting worn out, beat up, broken by cops, different cities, two of our cameras
[1:48:55.660 --> 1:48:56.660]  are broken by cops.
[1:48:56.660 --> 1:49:00.060]  The tops are, the mic holders are broken on them.
[1:49:00.060 --> 1:49:02.060]  We need money.
[1:49:02.060 --> 1:49:04.540]  So they came with this money bomb and it's perfect timing.
[1:49:04.540 --> 1:49:05.540]  Yeah.
[1:49:05.540 --> 1:49:06.540]  I want to build a stage.
[1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:11.100]  I got to hire another or two IT people.
[1:49:11.100 --> 1:49:12.980]  I mean, I got to go to the next level.
[1:49:12.980 --> 1:49:15.900]  I'm not putting my whole life on the line to just sit around and be comfortable just
[1:49:15.900 --> 1:49:17.140]  doing this show at this level.
[1:49:17.140 --> 1:49:18.700]  I want to start a show for cable.
[1:49:18.700 --> 1:49:22.260]  It's very inexpensive to get on, get sponsorship, get more hours.
[1:49:22.260 --> 1:49:24.620]  Then my plan is to start a whole channel.
[1:49:24.620 --> 1:49:27.940]  I mean, if Free Speech TV can do it, I'll blow them out of the water.
[1:49:27.940 --> 1:49:30.100]  It won't be a bunch of liberal stuff.
[1:49:30.100 --> 1:49:32.540]  It'll be real.
[1:49:32.540 --> 1:49:35.740]  I'm trying here, but I don't have the capital.
[1:49:35.740 --> 1:49:40.940]  And so absolutely, the money bomb coming up, spread the word about that or just send me
[1:49:40.940 --> 1:49:46.460]  a donation right now and it'll go into a stage and cameras and airtime and building it and
[1:49:46.460 --> 1:49:47.900]  doing it.
[1:49:47.900 --> 1:49:51.540]  And you know, this is what it's about here.
[1:49:51.540 --> 1:49:55.820]  All right, well, we're going to call a gentleman and tell him I'm going to get him on at 15
[1:49:55.820 --> 1:49:56.820]  after.
[1:49:56.820 --> 1:49:57.820]  Apologize.
[1:49:57.820 --> 1:49:58.820]  I said, I go to calls.
[1:49:58.820 --> 1:49:59.820]  I've got to do it.
[1:49:59.820 --> 1:50:02.980]  So I'm going to go to Raymond, Justin, Linda, Jeff, Eric and just call them.
[1:50:02.980 --> 1:50:03.980]  Some will call them at 10 after that.
[1:50:03.980 --> 1:50:04.980]  We can sit there for a minute.
[1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:05.980]  I love Aaron Zellman.
[1:50:05.980 --> 1:50:08.980]  Get him on about what's happened on the second amendment.
[1:50:08.980 --> 1:50:17.860]  Some of the new cases that have developed, but a lot of new cases, a lot of new big developments.
[1:50:17.860 --> 1:50:18.860]  But just support us.

[1:55:07.620 --> 1:55:10.780]  Man, it's hard to turn old Chuck Berry off, isn't it?
[1:55:10.780 --> 1:55:14.420]  I love the end of the song.
[1:55:14.420 --> 1:55:21.020]  He said, you will be the leader of a big old band.
[1:55:21.020 --> 1:55:23.820]  I was talking to a well-known musician here in Austin.
[1:55:23.820 --> 1:55:26.900]  He said he'd listen to this when he was a little kid, he'd run down to the corner record
[1:55:26.900 --> 1:55:31.500]  store with his lunch money to buy new Chuck Berry albums, and he'd imagine being the leader
[1:55:31.500 --> 1:55:32.500]  of a big old band.
[1:55:32.500 --> 1:55:33.500]  And now he is.
[1:55:33.500 --> 1:55:36.500]  That's how dreams work.
[1:55:36.500 --> 1:55:43.660]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Raymond, then Marcus, Justin, Linda, Chris, and others.
[1:55:43.660 --> 1:55:45.660]  Raymond, you're on the air worldwide.
[1:55:45.660 --> 1:55:47.380]  How you doing, Alex?
[1:55:47.380 --> 1:55:48.380]  Good.
[1:55:48.380 --> 1:55:49.380]  I love it.
[1:55:49.380 --> 1:55:50.380]  I love your show.
[1:55:50.380 --> 1:55:51.380]  I'm a first-time caller.
[1:55:51.380 --> 1:55:53.020]  I've been listening to you for about a month now.
[1:55:53.020 --> 1:56:00.180]  I was listening to your show, and I saw that MP3 of Rumsfeld, and I was wondering when you
[1:56:00.180 --> 1:56:02.740]  were going to get to it, and I'm glad you did.
[1:56:02.740 --> 1:56:09.660]  I just can't believe, I walk around in disbelief every day of the state of this entire country,
[1:56:09.660 --> 1:56:14.180]  not just where I live, that new law they just passed about the 30 miles an hour over the
[1:56:14.180 --> 1:56:15.180]  speed limit.
[1:56:15.180 --> 1:56:19.540]  They take your car, take your license, and put you in prison for 10 to 20 years.
[1:56:19.540 --> 1:56:21.060]  It's just absolutely ridiculous.
[1:56:21.060 --> 1:56:25.780]  It's five to 10, but yeah, people say you'll never get a ticket for 30 over.
[1:56:25.780 --> 1:56:29.540]  I told the story about how, and I usually only speed 10 miles over the speed limit.
[1:56:29.540 --> 1:56:30.540]  I am a speeder.
[1:56:30.540 --> 1:56:35.940]  I've actually quit because I've gotten tickets, but I never go 510 over, but one time they
[1:56:35.940 --> 1:56:40.060]  put one out in the middle of the country where it was a 60-mile-an-hour road, and suddenly
[1:56:40.060 --> 1:56:44.220]  it was 30 because there was a school down the road, and I got a 30-mile-over-the-speed
[1:56:44.220 --> 1:56:45.220]  limit ticket.
[1:56:45.220 --> 1:56:46.660]  I would have gone to jail for 10 years.
[1:56:46.660 --> 1:56:47.660]  Right.
[1:56:47.660 --> 1:56:54.740]  It's absolutely insane, and I'm trying to get my family, I'm slowly getting my family
[1:56:54.740 --> 1:57:00.700]  woken up to what's going on around them, and they're coming around, but I get so frustrated
[1:57:00.700 --> 1:57:07.820]  and frankly pissed off if I could say that, but how so ho-hum people are when you tell
[1:57:07.820 --> 1:57:13.020]  them things as simple as, you know, I watched the Aaron Russo movie, Freedom to Fascism,
[1:57:13.020 --> 1:57:18.300]  about the income tax, and how people are just so, oh, it's no big deal.
[1:57:18.300 --> 1:57:21.860]  I get so mad, and I just want to slap people around.
[1:57:21.860 --> 1:57:26.860]  I just don't understand how people can just, but that's how they're, like you say, that's
[1:57:26.860 --> 1:57:29.140]  what they've been trained to do their whole life.
[1:57:29.140 --> 1:57:30.660]  Sit back and accept it.
[1:57:30.660 --> 1:57:35.380]  I always say, as long as they have their SUVs and McDonald's in their malls, everybody's
[1:57:35.380 --> 1:57:36.380]  happy.
[1:57:36.380 --> 1:57:39.220]  I hear you, and I love you, and I appreciate you calling, Raymond, good to have you on
[1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:40.220]  board with us.
[1:57:40.220 --> 1:57:45.420]  Yeah, for those that don't know, dropping a banana peel, a battery in your backyard,
[1:57:45.420 --> 1:57:53.260]  a small double A, not turning your turn signal, not having a seatbelt on, jail time, 30 miles
[1:57:53.260 --> 1:57:55.420]  over the speed limit, 10 years in prison.
[1:57:55.420 --> 1:57:59.700]  They're passing laws like that everywhere, and they openly say it's to fill private
[1:57:59.700 --> 1:58:00.700]  prisons.
[1:58:00.700 --> 1:58:01.700]  Quote for the economy.
[1:58:01.700 --> 1:58:08.380]  What a sick economy, where we put people in prison for the economy, and I'm just so
[1:58:08.380 --> 1:58:09.620]  ashamed of Texas.
[1:58:09.620 --> 1:58:14.580]  You know, Texans have been admired through history, because we've had amazing people.
[1:58:14.580 --> 1:58:16.340]  Audie Murphy's from Texas.
[1:58:16.340 --> 1:58:23.380]  Now, the world sees Texas as George Bush, that blue-bud, British Tory, piece of trash
[1:58:23.380 --> 1:58:28.660]  from Kennebunkport, folks are great in Maine, by the way, Dick Curlis is from up there,
[1:58:28.660 --> 1:58:32.620]  I mean, I love.

[1:58:56.260 --> 1:58:59.420]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:58:59.420 --> 1:59:05.340]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:59:05.340 --> 1:59:09.780]  of humanity is at hand.

[1:59:24.940 --> 1:59:27.140]  they're after power, that's their after-easy.

[2:00:12.980 --> 2:00:16.500]  news I want to cover in your calls, really it is in a way, it's not good that one of

[2:00:32.740 --> 2:00:34.740]  Yes, Alex, hi.
[2:00:34.740 --> 2:00:35.740]  Hello.
[2:00:35.740 --> 2:00:36.740]  You're there, great.
[2:00:36.740 --> 2:00:42.100]  I'd like to talk about my two favorite gentlemen, and I think you both had them on, and that's
[2:00:42.100 --> 2:00:45.660]  Ron Paul and David Ray Griffin.
[2:00:45.660 --> 2:00:51.020]  I'm reading Ron Paul's book right now, I was involved in his campaign, and this recently
[2:00:51.020 --> 2:00:56.820]  I started to see all the Google videos of David Ray Griffin and bought his new book,
[2:00:56.820 --> 2:01:01.900]  9-11 Contradictions, incredible book.
[2:01:01.900 --> 2:01:07.300]  Back to Ron Paul, I was involved in his campaign, and I think it was on your show, or somebody
[2:01:07.300 --> 2:01:14.420]  showed that he said that he needs, he has an army, his army needs marching orders.
[2:01:14.420 --> 2:01:18.220]  We may do something at the Republican convention and may get a speech, but where do you think
[2:01:18.220 --> 2:01:19.580]  it's going to go beyond that?
[2:01:19.580 --> 2:01:24.420]  No, that's what I said, and by the way, Ron Paul is on Monday, probably in the studio.
[2:01:24.420 --> 2:01:25.420]  Really?
[2:01:25.420 --> 2:01:26.420]  Yeah, he's in here in Austin.
[2:01:26.420 --> 2:01:27.420]  Look.
[2:01:27.420 --> 2:01:28.420]  Excellent.
[2:01:28.420 --> 2:01:32.220]  I told him privately and on air, separately, he needed to say, we're fighting the North
[2:01:32.220 --> 2:01:36.620]  American Union, here's an organization I'm forming, even if it was a basic manifesto,
[2:01:36.620 --> 2:01:37.820]  he could do it.
[2:01:37.820 --> 2:01:42.700]  I said you need to also fight socialized healthcare, have an organization to fight that, and have
[2:01:42.700 --> 2:01:44.660]  a group to end the war.
[2:01:44.660 --> 2:01:48.980]  And I said with those issues, and a sovereignty group to defend the border, with those four
[2:01:48.980 --> 2:01:54.420]  groups, he would capture basically the entire electorate, and could then give marching orders
[2:01:54.420 --> 2:01:59.820]  and people, when he was at his peak in late January, early February, that he could have
[2:01:59.820 --> 2:02:01.540]  gone to the next level.
[2:02:01.540 --> 2:02:06.460]  And it was the biggest opportunity ever lost, not griping, I mean, we're still growing,
[2:02:06.460 --> 2:02:12.180]  everything's, I guess, good, but it's, I mean, I guess, I have the vision.
[2:02:12.180 --> 2:02:14.900]  By the way, it was me that called it a money bomb.
[2:02:14.900 --> 2:02:17.980]  It was my listeners, we've got him coming on at the end of the show today, one of my
[2:02:17.980 --> 2:02:22.260]  listeners who came up with the idea and put it on the web, I'm not bragging, but we've
[2:02:22.260 --> 2:02:28.580]  created the entire nomenclature, the language of info war and money bombs, and front lines
[2:02:28.580 --> 2:02:32.700]  of the info war and wartime broadcast, because that's how I've always seen it.
[2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:35.380]  I know the enemy sees it like that against us.
[2:02:35.380 --> 2:02:38.300]  It's an info war they've got against us.
[2:02:38.300 --> 2:02:42.020]  So I'm fighting as hard as I can, but I think I deserve some respect.
[2:02:42.020 --> 2:02:44.460]  I think I've shown that I'm able to let you blood.
[2:02:44.460 --> 2:02:48.020]  Right, Alex, I just got turned on to you, I mean, I mean, turned on through other Ron
[2:02:48.020 --> 2:02:52.820]  Paul supporters to take a closer look at you, because you're very flamboyant and that's
[2:02:52.820 --> 2:02:53.820]  what it takes also.
[2:02:53.820 --> 2:02:59.420]  I think the genius of Ron Paul, that all our supporters that are just basically mainstream
[2:02:59.420 --> 2:03:04.780]  working people that enjoy Ron Paul and will stay with him, is he is such a gentleman in
[2:03:04.780 --> 2:03:09.860]  the field of battle, he doesn't give in, he knows where to go, he knows to go to the
[2:03:09.860 --> 2:03:14.700]  Republican Party and take the fight there, because as an independent, it doesn't work.
[2:03:14.700 --> 2:03:20.060]  Aaron Russo's are great, okay, but they don't work when you're fighting these two entities,
[2:03:20.060 --> 2:03:22.460]  the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.
[2:03:22.460 --> 2:03:30.180]  So Ron Paul is still a really great voice, and it is incredible, David Ray Griffin, the
[2:03:30.180 --> 2:03:35.900]  gentleman and the scholar that he is, the way he puts the holes in 9-11, I'm glad to
[2:03:35.900 --> 2:03:36.900]  write.
[2:03:36.900 --> 2:03:40.820]  He's great and I appreciate him, great on 9-11, I don't like his New World Order views,
[2:03:40.820 --> 2:03:42.500]  tell you that right now.
[2:03:42.500 --> 2:03:46.060]  So I do not admire David Ray Griffin's political views, I think they're atrocious.
[2:03:46.060 --> 2:03:51.980]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call here, Justin in Ohio, you're on the air.
[2:03:51.980 --> 2:03:53.780]  Hello, Alex.
[2:03:53.780 --> 2:03:54.780]  Go ahead, welcome.
[2:03:54.780 --> 2:04:00.180]  Welcome, this is Dustin, I spoke to you a couple of times up up here in Ohio, and I was listening
[2:04:00.180 --> 2:04:05.740]  to the radio station this morning, one of the local affiliates, and they said something
[2:04:05.740 --> 2:04:10.980]  that really struck me, and they talked about it for a few seconds, but what they were talking
[2:04:10.980 --> 2:04:17.500]  about is what they call a no-refusal checkpoint, sobriety checkpoint, coming up for Memorial
[2:04:17.500 --> 2:04:20.340]  Day weekend, and I believe they're talking about it.
[2:04:20.340 --> 2:04:21.340]  Stay there, let's talk about it.
[2:04:21.340 --> 2:04:25.260]  Let me get back and plug the affiliate as well, and then we have a couple of affiliates
[2:04:25.260 --> 2:04:28.700]  in Ohio that carry the show, I think three, we're very thankful to all of them.
[2:04:28.700 --> 2:04:29.700]  Stay there.
[2:04:29.700 --> 2:04:31.300]  I want to hear about this on the other side, yeah.
[2:04:31.300 --> 2:04:36.980]  The feds fund these about 10 times a year on holidays and special dates, and it's federalized
[2:04:36.980 --> 2:04:41.700]  funded checkpoints, the cover is for alcohol, but the government documents show it's really
[2:04:41.700 --> 2:04:48.500]  getting you ready for martial law, stay there.
[2:04:48.500 --> 2:04:52.540]  Our beloved republic is on her knees, the forces of globalism are destroying national

[2:05:04.300 --> 2:05:05.300]  master plan.
[2:05:05.300 --> 2:05:09.580]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[2:07:48.220 --> 2:07:54.140]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[2:07:54.140 --> 2:07:57.860]  a war on for your mind.
[2:07:57.860 --> 2:08:08.900]  Okay, yes, I do know about, I had a call a few days ago that started this whole discussion
[2:08:08.900 --> 2:08:11.340]  going, have you heard about Operation Checkpoint?
[2:08:11.340 --> 2:08:15.740]  And I Googled it, there are hundreds of Operation Checkpoints, hundreds of things called Operation
[2:08:15.740 --> 2:08:22.220]  Roundup and the feds pay local county, city, states to even use those names so it's unified
[2:08:22.220 --> 2:08:27.180]  to condition the public for martial law and they even now admit that.
[2:08:27.180 --> 2:08:30.540]  And yeah, you just pull up randomly when you're out with your family and the cops walk over
[2:08:30.540 --> 2:08:34.700]  and say license registration, total violation of the Fourth Amendment, they're turning
[2:08:34.700 --> 2:08:36.980]  the streets and roads into the airport.
[2:08:36.980 --> 2:08:41.380]  But it's been in the news because there have been some good sheriffs in Tennessee and Alabama
[2:08:41.380 --> 2:08:45.140]  and I haven't seen a couple in California, I've seen a bunch, it's in the news every
[2:08:45.140 --> 2:08:48.380]  few weeks, I see it, I had a few of them on over the years, I need to have some of them
[2:08:48.380 --> 2:08:53.140]  back on, just not to do research and remember their names from years ago, but they'll be,
[2:08:53.140 --> 2:08:58.180]  well I arrested 50 illegals during Operation Checkpoint and you know, they were like one
[2:08:58.180 --> 2:09:03.300]  van had 14 people in it, they were all drunk, they had kids without baby seats and I gave
[2:09:03.300 --> 2:09:08.380]  them to ICE and I said, or I gave them to, before that the INS and they said they wouldn't
[2:09:08.380 --> 2:09:10.980]  get them, let them go.
[2:09:10.980 --> 2:09:15.540]  Or I don't know why local judges let them go for DWIs and then I've talked to Austin
[2:09:15.540 --> 2:09:20.140]  cops and they go, yeah, we're told don't get them because the judges just let them go.
[2:09:20.140 --> 2:09:23.820]  But then I come to a checkpoint, you see, I'm the fat cow though, I'm the dumb American,
[2:09:23.820 --> 2:09:28.660]  I'm the milk cow, I'm the food and I pull up and I go, I'm not going to let you search
[2:09:28.660 --> 2:09:32.940]  my car, you got cars all stopped here, you don't have problem with cars officer, I've
[2:09:32.940 --> 2:09:37.260]  got all my tax stickers in order, I'm complying, whoa, what you got a problem with, get out
[2:09:37.260 --> 2:09:41.660]  of the car right now, stand right here, they come over, what's your problem boy, this
[2:09:41.660 --> 2:09:46.380]  happened to me, that's why I don't like you, you know, it's not enough, I grew up with
[2:09:46.380 --> 2:09:50.380]  a drug deal and sheriff in our town that finally went to prison and saw cops beat people up
[2:09:50.380 --> 2:09:54.780]  and everything else and not enough, I've had to see a lie and court and everything else,
[2:09:54.780 --> 2:09:59.180]  I've had this stuff happen to me, hey, I'm an American, I shouldn't pull up to one of
[2:09:59.180 --> 2:10:06.580]  your dirty checkpoints, especially when the illegals are above the law, I've had enough,
[2:10:06.580 --> 2:10:12.260]  and they come up to you and then they start yelling at you and asking why, now that other
[2:10:12.260 --> 2:10:18.380]  cops who still try to violate the fourth amendment, but they back off and at least aren't totally
[2:10:18.380 --> 2:10:23.260]  evil, they'll say, mind if I look in your car for my safety, and I go, your safety,
[2:10:23.260 --> 2:10:27.340]  you've just run my plate, I'm Alex Jones, I have no criminal record officer, and look,
[2:10:27.340 --> 2:10:30.820]  you say I was speeding, I don't think I was, that's happened a few times, but I know you're
[2:10:30.820 --> 2:10:35.300]  out here supposed to randomly stop, quit arguing with me, officer, you just asked to search
[2:10:35.300 --> 2:10:41.260]  my car, look, I want my children to grow up in a free country, I've given like probably
[2:10:41.260 --> 2:10:46.420]  10 times the speech of the last 15 years, never forget one time, I was late to get
[2:10:46.420 --> 2:10:51.820]  to KJFK in like 1998, I was late to get there, we're going to you in a minute sir, tell
[2:10:51.820 --> 2:10:55.340]  the story, and I was late to get there, well I wasn't late, it was like an hour before
[2:10:55.340 --> 2:10:59.900]  showtime, but I wanted to get some more stories once I got to there, because their computers
[2:10:59.900 --> 2:11:04.220]  were faster than my home computer at that time, why am I telling that part of the story,
[2:11:04.220 --> 2:11:08.900]  it doesn't matter, I had to get to the station and get ready for my show, and I still remember
[2:11:08.900 --> 2:11:13.260]  the day and I pull over my cars full of McDonald's bags and stuff at that time, it's when I decided
[2:11:13.260 --> 2:11:16.380]  to not care about myself and that I wasn't going to be alive long and they were going
[2:11:16.380 --> 2:11:21.540]  to kill me, so what, I might as well start drinking beer and eat McDonald's, you know,
[2:11:21.540 --> 2:11:24.620]  why does that part of the story matter, but I remember I was, the car had wrappers in
[2:11:24.620 --> 2:11:28.340]  it because it was digging through them, so I remember that, see I go back and image what
[2:11:28.340 --> 2:11:32.220]  happened and then I start telling you the first thing I see and it doesn't matter, point
[2:11:32.220 --> 2:11:42.380]  to me is that he pulled me over on 183 North and he comes over, I'll never forget, he pulled
[2:11:42.380 --> 2:11:48.540]  me over in a long stretch where it's above ground and so it's like a tiny shoulder and
[2:11:48.540 --> 2:11:53.860]  I remember marveling that he was just standing there with cars flying by, but I knew better
[2:11:53.860 --> 2:11:59.020]  than to drive another quarter mile and pull over by the grass because I'd had cops get
[2:11:59.020 --> 2:12:03.180]  mad at me when I'd done that before, so fine, wants to get himself killed here, I'll pull
[2:12:03.180 --> 2:12:07.140]  right over here for you buddy and I remember he's sitting there and he's going, what you
[2:12:07.140 --> 2:12:11.180]  got in here, what you doing in here, let me see your stuff, you're speeding and I'm like,
[2:12:11.180 --> 2:12:14.860]  you know what, I was even going in the slow lane guy, I don't, what was I going five miles
[2:12:14.860 --> 2:12:18.140]  over maybe and he's like, well, I go, why'd you pull me over, well, let me, you know,
[2:12:18.140 --> 2:12:22.260]  I'll do the talking here and he goes, well, you mind if I search this for my safety, what's
[2:12:22.260 --> 2:12:26.700]  all this and I had like stacks of news articles and a few hamburger bags, they were actually
[2:12:26.700 --> 2:12:33.820]  Culver's bags, not McDonald's but fast food and he's digging around in there and he goes,
[2:12:33.820 --> 2:12:38.140]  well, I'm going to search it and I said, well, you know, you're violating my fourth amendment
[2:12:38.140 --> 2:12:41.180]  and you know, don't you have children, don't you want to live in a free country, listen,
[2:12:41.180 --> 2:12:45.180]  I'm doing this for my safety and then he goes back to his car and two more cars pull up
[2:12:45.180 --> 2:12:48.020]  because I'd questioned him and they're all around me and well, we're going to get a drug
[2:12:48.020 --> 2:12:53.060]  dog and then I just said, you know what, I got to go to work, do it and as soon as I
[2:12:53.060 --> 2:12:58.580]  submitted, they said, no, you can go, it was all about me submitting to them because I
[2:12:58.580 --> 2:13:02.820]  had to get somewhere but I swore then that I'd never do it again, even if I was late
[2:13:02.820 --> 2:13:03.820]  for something.
[2:13:03.820 --> 2:13:09.580]  Now I got kids, what if I was late getting them at school or from gym or something, I
[2:13:09.580 --> 2:13:13.020]  think I'd grovel and do what they said and now if you're not there five minutes after
[2:13:13.020 --> 2:13:15.780]  you're supposed to pick your kid up, they see PSHA.
[2:13:15.780 --> 2:13:22.180]  So that's another big danger there but I mean, I pulled up to a checkpoint and they're sitting
[2:13:22.180 --> 2:13:26.300]  there searching cars off at the side and looking in your car with a flashlight staring at you
[2:13:26.300 --> 2:13:28.500]  and, where are you going?
[2:13:28.500 --> 2:13:29.500]  Why does it matter?
[2:13:29.500 --> 2:13:32.780]  Well, you don't want to answer my questions, get out of the car, we got all the squad car
[2:13:32.780 --> 2:13:36.580]  videos we played on the show and they'll go, listen to me boy, I can plant something on
[2:13:36.580 --> 2:13:39.580]  you right now and ruin your life, I'm going to, you understand that because the guy's
[2:13:39.580 --> 2:13:44.140]  recording it, cops don't realize that we're doing that now, I'll set you up right now
[2:13:44.140 --> 2:13:49.540]  boy, I'll show you I win, I'll show you who wins, it's all about out there the winner
[2:13:49.540 --> 2:13:56.060]  and it's all because you don't want to be stopped by them, I'm a human being, I'm sorry.
[2:13:56.060 --> 2:13:59.460]  Now most cops I've talked to actually don't like running these random checkpoints, you
[2:13:59.460 --> 2:14:04.540]  want to stop criminals, drive around on the highway, there's drunks everywhere, driving
[2:14:04.540 --> 2:14:09.380]  around like maniacs in Austin, crack dealers on East 11th, East 7th, they're running around
[2:14:09.380 --> 2:14:13.780]  by the Chevron station and by the Dutch Royal Shell all the time and I'm going over to the
[2:14:13.780 --> 2:14:16.980]  TV show, I want to stop and get something to drink or stop and get gas, I don't even
[2:14:16.980 --> 2:14:20.900]  stop there because there's like 15 crack heads running around selling crack right there
[2:14:20.900 --> 2:14:31.500]  and the police station is 300 yards, no, 200 yards away, but no, you've got to stop me
[2:14:31.500 --> 2:14:41.100]  and you've got to ask if I've got drugs or weapons, disgusting, disgusting, but I know
[2:14:41.100 --> 2:14:45.660]  it's what your dirt bag socialist bosses tell you, I think cops would rather be busting
[2:14:45.660 --> 2:14:51.060]  the crack heads and you go, Alex, I thought you were for drug decriminalization, yes,
[2:14:51.060 --> 2:14:53.940]  but as long as it's going to be the law and you're going to be pulling me over asking
[2:14:53.940 --> 2:14:58.740]  me about it, why don't you go stop the dangerous zombies, those crack heads don't even eat
[2:14:58.740 --> 2:15:03.260]  or drink, they weigh like 85 pounds, they look like psychopathic day of the dead people
[2:15:03.260 --> 2:15:10.180]  and they're just constantly trying to mug people, but when they mug somebody, a woman
[2:15:10.180 --> 2:15:15.820]  can fight them off because they're poor, horrible zombies, I've already digressed, I'm going
[2:15:15.820 --> 2:15:21.380]  to your calls, Justin in Ohio, go ahead, yes, I don't mean to, have you ever seen a
[2:15:21.380 --> 2:15:22.380]  crack zombie?
[2:15:22.380 --> 2:15:23.380]  You ever seen one?
[2:15:23.380 --> 2:15:27.180]  I grew up in Dallas, man, I'm sick of the government since the mid eighties turning
[2:15:27.180 --> 2:15:33.860]  them into this, go ahead, well, what struck me was and I'm looking for this currently
[2:15:33.860 --> 2:15:39.900]  on the internet right now to email to you, but what they said was on this refusal checkpoint
[2:15:39.900 --> 2:15:46.140]  was if you, they would have equipment there and a testing equipment and if you refused
[2:15:46.140 --> 2:15:52.540]  the breathalyzer that they were going to draw blood right there, they were going to draw
[2:15:52.540 --> 2:15:56.780]  blood out of you to test for alcohol.
[2:15:56.780 --> 2:16:03.620]  Now if that is not a violation of civil rights, blatant, I mean, that's incredible that you
[2:16:03.620 --> 2:16:09.420]  know, I saw the federal documents on that in 2002, it started in Tucson, Arizona, they're
[2:16:09.420 --> 2:16:14.140]  doing that to get the cops trained, those are special officers that have been trained
[2:16:14.140 --> 2:16:19.340]  and forced inoculation and so they're kind of, you know, they question them who will
[2:16:19.340 --> 2:16:25.060]  do it, though the cops doing that will be the only idiot cops on the local force, it
[2:16:25.060 --> 2:16:30.620]  was less than 1% according to the LA Times who agreed to it, those fools agreed to take
[2:16:30.620 --> 2:16:36.380]  smallpox and anthrax, at least in the cities I know, Denver, Tucson, I've seen it in the
[2:16:36.380 --> 2:16:43.180]  Ohio News, Texas News and yeah, since 2002, and they do it at night too, right outside
[2:16:43.180 --> 2:16:46.780]  Denver, whatever that county's called, it was in the Denver Post last year, it said
[2:16:46.780 --> 2:16:51.620]  that these people freaked out, families, they got families out and they stick needles in
[2:16:51.620 --> 2:16:59.300]  your vein on the side of the highway, I mean, total tyranny, total nightmare, just like
[2:16:59.300 --> 2:17:02.620]  they're going to give you 10 years in prison for driving over the speed limit, sorry, go
[2:17:02.620 --> 2:17:03.620]  ahead.
[2:17:03.620 --> 2:17:09.060]  No, that's okay, I wanted to make another point, you've been touching on the topic of
[2:17:09.060 --> 2:17:10.900]  children's protective services.
[2:17:10.900 --> 2:17:13.300]  Yeah, child pedophile services, yeah.
[2:17:13.300 --> 2:17:21.140]  Well, my son, back in October, I was getting ready to get custody of my son, this is how
[2:17:21.140 --> 2:17:28.580]  bad it says in this area here, and children's protective services came to my house, removed
[2:17:28.580 --> 2:17:36.500]  my son because they said that I did not have proof of being, you know, the biological father,
[2:17:36.500 --> 2:17:44.380]  I had taken my, I had taken the DNA test seven years prior to that, and that paperwork was
[2:17:44.380 --> 2:17:45.940]  on file.
[2:17:45.940 --> 2:17:51.180]  And let me guess, let me guess, you had to spend 20 grand over the next year in classes
[2:17:51.180 --> 2:17:53.820]  and bootlicking to get your son back.
[2:17:53.820 --> 2:17:54.820]  Oh yeah.
[2:17:54.820 --> 2:17:58.700]  Well, how much money did you have to spend?
[2:17:58.700 --> 2:18:03.220]  Honestly I spent around $10,000, and I was going to say 10 at first, but usually it's
[2:18:03.220 --> 2:18:05.140]  about 20.
[2:18:05.140 --> 2:18:11.020]  And then let me guess, it was a shaved head woman, hates men, was that, or was it one
[2:18:11.020 --> 2:18:13.020]  of the Nellie guys?
[2:18:13.020 --> 2:18:18.780]  Yeah, it was a quote woman, unquote, yeah, it's always only two types.
[2:18:18.780 --> 2:18:20.820]  It's almost like they've got clones.
[2:18:20.820 --> 2:18:25.060]  But what was really frustrating for me and everybody, and I got them back fairly quickly
[2:18:25.060 --> 2:18:30.860]  because I called the Columbus news stations, I called the local newspapers, I got everybody
[2:18:30.860 --> 2:18:31.860]  in all of them.
[2:18:31.860 --> 2:18:34.500]  Now, do they tell you shut up and everything will be all right?
[2:18:34.500 --> 2:18:37.100]  Because it's like a kidnapper tells you, be quiet, everything's going to be okay, just
[2:18:37.100 --> 2:18:42.420]  do what I say, and then it's Jeffrey Dahmer or Ted Bundy, and then most people shut up
[2:18:42.420 --> 2:18:46.740]  and then they say sign this, and then you sign it, and your kid's off to Saudi Arabia.
[2:18:46.740 --> 2:18:47.740]  Right.
[2:18:47.740 --> 2:18:52.260]  And well, they took them away, and the thing was, here's what got everybody in there.
[2:18:52.260 --> 2:18:54.980]  And I bet he cried, I bet it, and then of course they tried to pro-zack him because
[2:18:54.980 --> 2:18:55.980]  he cried.
[2:18:55.980 --> 2:18:59.100]  See, right when they steal your kid, they're freaking out, they're crying, then they take
[2:18:59.100 --> 2:19:02.420]  them to a government shrink and they say, you're crying for no reason.
[2:19:02.420 --> 2:19:04.220]  You should love the government grabbing you.
[2:19:04.220 --> 2:19:05.220]  I'm not joking.
[2:19:05.220 --> 2:19:10.060]  You're going to be put on anti-psychotics, oh, you're having seizures from it.
[2:19:10.060 --> 2:19:13.300]  We'll do brain surgery.
[2:19:13.300 --> 2:19:14.740]  The people that they took him to.
[2:19:14.740 --> 2:19:16.420]  I'm not joking, really.
[2:19:16.420 --> 2:19:20.900]  However, those days that he went, the people that they took him to, they had him in bed
[2:19:20.900 --> 2:19:22.660]  at six o'clock in the evening.
[2:19:22.660 --> 2:19:23.660]  Other days.
[2:19:23.660 --> 2:19:24.660]  Right.
[2:19:24.660 --> 2:19:27.140]  And he was so miserable when I got him back.
[2:19:27.140 --> 2:19:31.420]  I mean, I called my state representative, I called, like I said, I called everybody,
[2:19:31.420 --> 2:19:32.420]  and they...
[2:19:32.420 --> 2:19:33.420]  Well, you're lucky.
[2:19:33.420 --> 2:19:34.420]  You're lucky.

[2:20:50.500 --> 2:20:54.940]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the industrial age to the space age, gold
[2:20:54.940 --> 2:20:56.740]  has weathered the test of time.
[2:20:56.740 --> 2:21:01.100]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[2:21:01.100 --> 2:21:05.260]  According to the World Gold Council in the US Mint, demand is at an all-time high, the
[2:21:05.260 --> 2:21:09.940]  stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a

[2:22:48.860 --> 2:22:52.620]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[2:22:52.620 --> 2:22:55.140]  disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[2:22:55.140 --> 2:22:59.180]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and
[2:22:59.180 --> 2:23:00.900]  our high stress lifestyles.
[2:23:00.900 --> 2:23:05.020]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[2:23:05.020 --> 2:23:09.500]  The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized
[2:23:09.500 --> 2:23:10.500]  water.
[2:23:10.500 --> 2:23:14.980]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science,

[2:23:46.340 --> 2:23:59.660]  Imagine it's not enough to have a bunch of goons and uniforms, black uniforms, rifle,
[2:23:59.660 --> 2:24:03.340]  your car, and a random fourth amendment violating checkpoint.
[2:24:03.340 --> 2:24:08.380]  No, now they're going to force a breathalyzer on you, of course there's no law that they
[2:24:08.380 --> 2:24:09.380]  can do that.
[2:24:09.380 --> 2:24:11.380]  But now they're just going to shove them.
[2:24:11.380 --> 2:24:19.100]  Pull in your arm and suck your blood, it's all part of the freedom.
[2:24:19.100 --> 2:24:25.740]  Yeah, welcome to your life in the Banana Boat America with a bunch of low grade morons having
[2:24:25.740 --> 2:24:32.140]  their way with you.
[2:24:32.140 --> 2:24:38.340]  The good news is though, the New World Order is in a lot of trouble, the people are waking
[2:24:38.340 --> 2:24:45.180]  up and hating your guts, and we're not going to stop, we're going to list all your crimes
[2:24:45.180 --> 2:24:50.860]  to more and more people, and our great listeners are going to spread the word in the four corners
[2:24:50.860 --> 2:24:56.100]  of the earth.
[2:24:56.100 --> 2:25:04.780]  Let's go back to Justin in Ohio, I want to go back to the local show, and I know about
[2:25:04.780 --> 2:25:07.580]  the cases all over the country under federal funds.
[2:25:07.580 --> 2:25:13.380]  Which cops think it's normal to jab a needle in your arm on the side of the road now, huh?
[2:25:13.380 --> 2:25:15.580]  It's pretty amazing.
[2:25:15.580 --> 2:25:16.580]  What was the local station?
[2:25:16.580 --> 2:25:21.340]  I guess if they're carrying my show, they must be good folks, were they upset about it?
[2:25:21.340 --> 2:25:26.220]  Well, yeah, I mean they didn't go in with prolonged discussion about it, it was one of them.
[2:25:26.220 --> 2:25:31.060]  See, that's the thing that the media, that's how the media manipulates the situation, because
[2:25:31.060 --> 2:25:34.980]  what they do is, they're really important stories like that, they won't discuss for
[2:25:34.980 --> 2:25:40.740]  twenty minutes, they'll discuss Ann and Nicole Smith for forty-five days straight, but something
[2:25:40.740 --> 2:25:46.460]  that's really, really important, like obvious violations of civil rights in the Fourth Amendment
[2:25:46.460 --> 2:25:52.260]  like you said, they'll discuss for, you know, two or three minutes, it was just a regular
[2:25:52.260 --> 2:25:55.460]  FM station, it does not carry your show.
[2:25:55.460 --> 2:25:58.580]  Okay, I thought you were talking about a station that was carrying my show in Ohio.
[2:25:58.580 --> 2:26:02.260]  Oh, no, no, no, they brought this up this morning.
[2:26:02.260 --> 2:26:05.060]  You said one of your affiliates is why I thought that.
[2:26:05.060 --> 2:26:08.780]  Okay, well, what was the other thing you wanted to add, I got to jump here.
[2:26:08.780 --> 2:26:15.300]  Okay, well, the thing about them taking my son was, real quick, is the fact that the
[2:26:15.300 --> 2:26:20.020]  paperwork stating that I was a father was right down the hallway from where that social
[2:26:20.020 --> 2:26:25.660]  worker, you know, was stationed, and, you know, they knew, they knew it was your son,
[2:26:25.660 --> 2:26:26.660]  they're criminals.
[2:26:26.660 --> 2:26:31.460]  Right, I mean, it would have taken her two minutes to get that paperwork, and what they
[2:26:31.460 --> 2:26:35.740]  do, listen, they were all abused as children, or they like to abuse.
[2:26:35.740 --> 2:26:37.980]  It's two types.
[2:26:37.980 --> 2:26:39.460]  That's why half of them quit each year.
[2:26:39.460 --> 2:26:42.620]  The half that are good quit, because they can't be part of the criminality.
[2:26:42.620 --> 2:26:45.940]  A normal person can't go and snatch crying kids all day.
[2:26:45.940 --> 2:26:52.140]  Right, right, you wouldn't think so, but, and that's the thing, it would have taken
[2:26:52.140 --> 2:26:56.540]  her two minutes to get that paperwork cleared up, but what they do is they get you in court,
[2:26:56.540 --> 2:27:01.020]  and then they say, well, what happened, well, this actually sped the process up by us doing
[2:27:01.020 --> 2:27:03.260]  this and this and that, and then they turn it around.
[2:27:03.260 --> 2:27:07.300]  Or they get you in a process for no reason, they're there for no reason, then there's
[2:27:07.300 --> 2:27:11.540]  a dirty dish, then they use your, that to get your kid and fly him to Israel.
[2:27:11.540 --> 2:27:15.300]  Listen, I appreciate you, my friend, I'm glad you got your child back.
[2:27:15.300 --> 2:27:19.660]  That'll be a lesson to them, the government's their enemy, and to be good, don't use drugs,
[2:27:19.660 --> 2:27:23.220]  don't get in trouble, because we hate the government.
[2:27:23.220 --> 2:27:24.860]  We don't get in their criminal clutches.
[2:27:24.860 --> 2:27:26.740]  We defeat the scum.
[2:27:26.740 --> 2:27:31.180]  We're healthy and strong and make money and take care of our children while they are
[2:27:31.180 --> 2:27:33.300]  filth and degenerate trash.
[2:27:33.300 --> 2:27:39.700]  We never use your degenerate drugs, you scum, you filth, we'll never use your trash.
[2:27:39.700 --> 2:27:43.300]  All you young people out there that have been getting on their drugs, stop using them.
[2:27:43.300 --> 2:27:48.260]  If I love you yourself and hate of them, you stop using their dirty products.
[2:27:48.260 --> 2:27:51.140]  Oh, I hate you, you filth.
[2:27:51.140 --> 2:27:56.300]  It is, they ship it in here, they ship it in and then they bust us for it.
[2:27:56.300 --> 2:27:58.060]  I've had enough of it.
[2:27:58.060 --> 2:28:03.460]  It's unbelievable, it's a fraud, it's outrageous.
[2:28:03.460 --> 2:28:04.460]  Who disagrees?
[2:28:04.460 --> 2:28:08.060]  Somebody disagrees with me, I'm going to the Linda, Chris, Mark, John, somebody disagreed,
[2:28:08.060 --> 2:28:09.060]  you said.
[2:28:09.060 --> 2:28:10.860]  Bill and Texas, you're on the air.
[2:28:10.860 --> 2:28:11.860]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:28:11.860 --> 2:28:13.980]  This is Bill in Austin.
[2:28:13.980 --> 2:28:18.500]  I disagree with you on three things, I support 90% of what you do, but these three things
[2:28:18.500 --> 2:28:21.980]  are pretty important in my mind, so that's why I called in today.
[2:28:21.980 --> 2:28:25.260]  The first thing is your histrionics, just like we heard.
[2:28:25.260 --> 2:28:30.460]  Do your emotion, that stuff just really detracts from being factual and being honest.
[2:28:30.460 --> 2:28:34.300]  They have trained us not to have emotions, they have, no, that's a lie.
[2:28:34.300 --> 2:28:35.300]  You know what?
[2:28:35.300 --> 2:28:39.180]  I am like, why do I have the number one Patriot show, blows them all away, dwarfs them, all
[2:28:39.180 --> 2:28:41.740]  of them together aren't as big as this show.
[2:28:41.740 --> 2:28:45.140]  All right, so that's one down and two to go.
[2:28:45.140 --> 2:28:50.780]  Second one, TV fakery, otherwise known as no-planers.
[2:28:50.780 --> 2:28:53.020]  You aren't looking at the evidence there.
[2:28:53.020 --> 2:28:57.260]  You disagree with what Morgan Reynolds had said, have you studied what Morgan has said?
[2:28:57.260 --> 2:28:59.940]  Yes, I don't agree with it.
[2:28:59.940 --> 2:29:02.260]  You disagree with what Ace Baker said?
[2:29:02.260 --> 2:29:03.420]  Yes.
[2:29:03.420 --> 2:29:05.980]  You disagree with what Warren Kugarela is saying?
[2:29:05.980 --> 2:29:06.980]  Yes.
[2:29:06.980 --> 2:29:12.540]  Just because NICO help is a disinfo agent and people like Paula Gloria, those people
[2:29:12.540 --> 2:29:15.580]  are clearly disinfo agents, just like you say.
[2:29:15.580 --> 2:29:19.060]  There's reality behind that and they're helping cover it up.
[2:29:19.060 --> 2:29:23.740]  The government wants us to talk about it, even if it was true, which I don't believe
[2:29:23.740 --> 2:29:28.980]  it is, it's meant because it sounds crazy, instead of the key evidence, you stay there.
[2:29:28.980 --> 2:29:39.100]  And then we'll be right back with me, the leader, yeah.
[2:29:39.100 --> 2:29:42.780]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[2:29:42.780 --> 2:29:49.220]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:49.220 --> 2:29:53.460]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:29:53.460 --> 2:29:58.180]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:29:58.180 --> 2:30:04.020]  It's known as the Builderberg Group, but their objective being world domination.
[2:30:04.020 --> 2:30:07.180]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:30:07.180 --> 2:30:13.100]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[2:30:13.100 --> 2:30:17.580]  of humanity is at hand.
[2:30:17.580 --> 2:30:22.580]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[2:30:26.900 --> 2:30:29.540]  Builderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:30:29.540 --> 2:30:30.540]  Most people have no idea.
[2:30:30.540 --> 2:30:31.540]  They're not after money.
[2:30:31.540 --> 2:30:32.540]  They have all the money they need.
[2:30:32.540 --> 2:30:33.540]  They're after power.

[2:31:48.180 --> 2:31:55.140]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[2:31:55.140 --> 2:31:58.680]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American Empire instead
[2:31:58.680 --> 2:32:00.980]  of what's fair for the American people.
[2:32:00.980 --> 2:32:04.780]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[2:34:00.460 --> 2:34:06.260]  People said that it was a big CG screen in the back the blue sky and then they then people explained to them how blue screens work
[2:34:06.260 --> 2:34:12.820]  And it's in studio not with the sky and they went oh well then it's this and then they show some video feed of like where the
[2:34:12.820 --> 2:34:14.900]  Plane crashes they go. That's the nose now
[2:34:14.900 --> 2:34:19.380]  That's a molten group of junk blowing out the other end. That's how projectiles work
[2:34:21.260 --> 2:34:28.300]  So this is classic black propaganda and I've seen the national news now Howard Stern others they give this attention
[2:34:28.300 --> 2:34:33.780]  They don't give the serious stuff. I've had the BBC here. I've had I've had this history channel here
[2:34:33.780 --> 2:34:35.780]  I've had all the I had
[2:34:36.020 --> 2:34:38.020]  National media just called me
[2:34:38.500 --> 2:34:43.380]  Nightline and I just said you know what I'm not doing it. Don't come around. I don't want to talk to you because they'll come and I'll see
[2:34:43.380 --> 2:34:45.020]  operation Northwoods
[2:34:45.020 --> 2:34:50.660]  I'll talk about the US troops massed around Afghanistan before the attack. I'll talk about the NORAD stand downs
[2:34:50.660 --> 2:34:55.740]  I'll talk about how governments have carried out attacks before and that's our strongest evidence
[2:34:55.740 --> 2:35:00.020]  I'll get into how the hijackers were trained at US military bases and now springmen and other
[2:35:00.580 --> 2:35:06.620]  Ambassadors and you know heads of embassies said that they were ordered to let them back in because they were US government agents and
[2:35:07.500 --> 2:35:13.860]  Boy, they will never allow that out. They'll always allow the stuff that can't be proven one way or the other now I
[2:35:15.940 --> 2:35:17.940]  Think something weird went on at the Pentagon
[2:35:17.980 --> 2:35:24.620]  None of my films covered it until terror storm and I just say well looks like a honeypot where they won't release all these other videos
[2:35:24.620 --> 2:35:29.060]  But then they release, you know one that that only furthers the debate
[2:35:29.060 --> 2:35:32.380]  I think they're gonna release whether it's a fake CG or whether it's real
[2:35:32.940 --> 2:35:39.380]  Sometime in the future something and try to make the whole debate about the Pentagon so they can later run a scyop and bring that out
[2:35:39.620 --> 2:35:41.620]  I've been saying that since 2001
[2:35:42.620 --> 2:35:44.620]  since September
[2:35:44.820 --> 2:35:47.140]  15th or so people first talked about the Pentagon
[2:35:47.380 --> 2:35:54.300]  By the way, I was there when it was happening live watching TV and they were saying the Pentagon has been bombed and the first reports were Pentagon's
[2:35:54.300 --> 2:35:59.380]  Been bombed it was a bomb and I mean obviously something went on there that that we're not being told and
[2:35:59.700 --> 2:36:06.500]  And planes don't leave eight and sixteen foot holes and no wreckage and I've I've acquiesced and said yeah
[2:36:06.500 --> 2:36:08.500]  There may be something happening there probably is
[2:36:09.180 --> 2:36:11.220]  But I did I ever make a film about it? No
[2:36:12.180 --> 2:36:19.140]  Because I first I make films that are effective where we prove the government has staged attacks where they don't debate it where it's
[2:36:19.140 --> 2:36:27.060]  Declassified where it's admitted now you explain to the public. They've done it before then you show them PNAC documents and others now
[2:36:27.060 --> 2:36:33.340]  This rumsfeld tape where they're saying man another terror attack would sure help us with our agenda and you explain that to them
[2:36:34.220 --> 2:36:37.380]  That's why road to tyranny the first 9-11 film
[2:36:37.380 --> 2:36:42.260]  I put an emergency version of it out a week and a half after the attacks the official one came out
[2:36:42.420 --> 2:36:47.220]  February 1st three months four months after the attacks. We see October over December
[2:36:47.220 --> 2:36:49.220]  You know about four months after
[2:36:49.420 --> 2:36:55.540]  But and then we start out with Hitler firebombing the Reichstag Hitler and Gliwitz to start the war with Poland
[2:36:55.940 --> 2:37:01.340]  We get into Oklahoma City. We get into other you know examples, but we but we show some examples like Tonkin and
[2:37:03.460 --> 2:37:08.020]  Northwoods, you know, we show examples of it to explain. Hey, this happens
[2:37:08.060 --> 2:37:14.460]  Then we make it nonpartisan and expose how the Clinton East has bombed Oklahoma City. It's key to make it nonpartisan
[2:37:14.460 --> 2:37:20.660]  Okay, that's to get conservatives to realize it's both parties are owned then we move into the next thing 9-11
[2:37:20.660 --> 2:37:28.100]  We also showed how Clinton bombed the World Trade Center in 93 cook the bomb train the drivers gave them the detonators New York Times CBS news
[2:37:28.820 --> 2:37:32.220]  Mean that's what's effective and frankly. I may not be that effective on the radio
[2:37:32.620 --> 2:37:36.820]  See, I'm not like most these people who got a radio show or they make films or they write books
[2:37:36.820 --> 2:37:42.740]  I write books. I publish books. I produce films. I make films. I do my radio show. I do other radio shows
[2:37:42.740 --> 2:37:47.860]  I write articles. I have got people that write articles. I'm about to start a cable TV show
[2:37:48.380 --> 2:37:51.820]  I oil paint at night and I'm back doing that. I'm gonna do more
[2:37:52.500 --> 2:37:54.500]  Because you only live one time
[2:37:55.700 --> 2:38:00.260]  I'm not into sitting there in the corner sucking my thumb. I have vision. I have understanding
[2:38:00.260 --> 2:38:02.900]  I have daring and it all the glory goes to God
[2:38:03.300 --> 2:38:09.380]  So for all my warts and all my problems, you know why I'm good because I take action. I'll put one foot in front of the other
[2:38:09.380 --> 2:38:15.820]  I'm not lazy. I'm God. I'm serious. I've got courage. I'm focused. I don't care what people say about me
[2:38:16.260 --> 2:38:21.780]  Other than it becomes a distraction and a diversion. So I educate people by covering those attacks
[2:38:22.500 --> 2:38:24.500]  now
[2:38:25.780 --> 2:38:30.380]  You know, I work real nice guy met him in New York didn't know about some of the other stuff weird stuff
[2:38:30.380 --> 2:38:33.980]  You know, he's been involved in whatever so then I realized all that I thought was a nice guy
[2:38:33.980 --> 2:38:37.660]  But the media can really use this if I make a big deal out of her have worn on a bunch
[2:38:37.660 --> 2:38:39.860]  You know, he's listening right now. He calls me all the time and emails me
[2:38:40.460 --> 2:38:43.060]  And you know, he wants to get it all this craziness. I'm not gonna do it
[2:38:43.620 --> 2:38:49.140]  And Reynolds that's pretty obvious what he's doing and I had bad feelings when I met with him in person and interviewing
[2:38:50.060 --> 2:38:55.080]  You get this Bush administration official comes out credibly for a year then just goes into La La land
[2:38:55.700 --> 2:39:00.220]  Fets are mentally unstable. I've been around him and you know, I mean, I mean really mentally unstable
[2:39:00.220 --> 2:39:04.460]  I'm like nice and person and friendly and I've got my on-air persona getting hyped up and wild
[2:39:04.460 --> 2:39:11.420]  And it's not that it's fake, but it's a persona. It's a mindset. I get jacked up to talk
[2:39:11.420 --> 2:39:16.460]  I frankly don't like talking you sit around at my house with me all day. I might talk to you one time
[2:39:17.340 --> 2:39:19.340]  Okay, I don't particularly want to talk to people
[2:39:19.380 --> 2:39:22.380]  This is like somebody who just wants to be left alone when they're made to talk
[2:39:22.380 --> 2:39:27.460]  This is what I turn into and then I just spew it's in my head and I don't want to get to fight with all these people
[2:39:27.460 --> 2:39:30.540]  I don't want it to become a diversion a distraction. I don't care
[2:39:30.540 --> 2:39:34.500]  they can run around and do what they want and be aggressive and
[2:39:34.980 --> 2:39:40.460]  I mean, I remember the bullying a couple years ago when they started space beams and no planes and people call me up and try
[2:39:40.460 --> 2:39:43.500]  To bully me and threaten me and start fights with me and you better do this
[2:39:43.500 --> 2:39:47.220]  You better say this and I mean, I know what I'm seeing an operation
[2:39:47.220 --> 2:39:51.820]  I don't know who's a useful idiot and who's an agent, but I know one thing it stinks to high heaven
[2:39:51.820 --> 2:39:58.660]  It's bull who put this together me who do I trust me who went on the air day one and lost like 20 affiliates
[2:39:58.660 --> 2:40:03.060]  Saying it was an inside job who went on brownfield's show day one and said it was an inside job
[2:40:03.260 --> 2:40:08.060]  Hours after the attack when building seven it just collapsed and it has been banned from his show since
[2:40:08.940 --> 2:40:11.980]  Do I hate brownfield over that? No, he lost a bunch of affiliates, too
[2:40:13.220 --> 2:40:16.740]  You know who doesn't compromise. I've seen all these other patriot networks
[2:40:16.740 --> 2:40:20.020]  We're not gonna talk about the New World Order and we're not gonna get into these things
[2:40:20.020 --> 2:40:26.700]  We're gonna be mainstream immediately. See I've never sold out. I've never faltered. I've never wavered. I've never
[2:40:26.700 --> 2:40:27.820]  never
[2:40:27.820 --> 2:40:34.340]  Compromised one centella in what I do and who I am. I've been physically attacked. I've been demonized
[2:40:34.340 --> 2:40:39.700]  I've been drugged to the mud by every major magazine and TV show you can imagine and do I care? No
[2:40:40.420 --> 2:40:42.420]  Do I care about myself? No
[2:40:42.740 --> 2:40:49.060]  But I care enough about the truth and my instincts and my discernment be able to tell you what's bull and what isn't
[2:40:50.900 --> 2:40:56.540]  How many things have we accurately predicted how many things that we forecast how many things have we covered in fact
[2:40:56.540 --> 2:40:58.820]  I'm just done talking to that person. I don't even want to hear it
[2:40:59.860 --> 2:41:03.540]  And you know, I see the debunkers on the other side not only in our own movement
[2:41:03.540 --> 2:41:10.380]  You know why most people in this movement attack me the Catholics run it all crowd the the the the Jews of the devil crowd
[2:41:10.380 --> 2:41:13.540]  And they go well, I'm not saying the Jews. Well, actually I am they're devil people
[2:41:14.260 --> 2:41:17.460]  Just a year or two ago. They wouldn't say that now they do bunch of nuts
[2:41:18.940 --> 2:41:22.300]  They all hate me they all hate me because they're lazy
[2:41:22.300 --> 2:41:28.380]  They all hate me because they're in this for egomania instead of saving the Republic and serving the human spirit in humanity
[2:41:28.980 --> 2:41:35.100]  They're all in this because they're mentally ill. They're in this because they are either camp followers their government agents
[2:41:35.100 --> 2:41:40.260]  And that's why they attack me and it's a diversion. It's a distraction. Look at the fruits of this show
[2:41:40.260 --> 2:41:44.640]  Look at what we've broken. Look at what we brought out. Look at who we've gotten to come forward
[2:41:44.640 --> 2:41:49.980]  Look at how literal Providence has smiled on this show half of it just happens magically for us
[2:41:49.980 --> 2:41:51.980]  as
[2:41:52.220 --> 2:42:01.020]  A movement you have got to stop spinning your wheels wasting time and ninnying back and forth out of the gates
[2:42:02.460 --> 2:42:08.700]  There's all these sub groups and sub clicks that try to force you to adopt their exact nomenclature
[2:42:09.220 --> 2:42:13.020]  Their exact worldview their exact idea. I don't do that
[2:42:13.700 --> 2:42:14.220]  Okay
[2:42:14.220 --> 2:42:19.420]  I put out a wide spectrum bring a lot of views and a lot of ideas and let you make up your own mind
[2:42:19.420 --> 2:42:23.460]  I mean, if you ever watch these anti-jew groups all they do is fight with each other
[2:42:23.780 --> 2:42:29.900]  And and call each other names and viciously lie about each other and this is the Catholic groups all do that to each other
[2:42:29.900 --> 2:42:34.940]  The you know the anti-Catholic groups. You're a devil. No, you're a demon. No, you're a you're a this you're that you're a
[2:42:34.940 --> 2:42:39.060]  I'm the only good one. You know and the Protestant groups all fight with each other and the
[2:42:40.020 --> 2:42:47.440]  You know, I mean, it's craziness of course schizophrenics and mentally ill people and unstable people are gonna be drawn to this movement
[2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:53.200]  People that are different are gonna be drawn to this movement people that are naysayers people that are questioners people that are
[2:42:54.040 --> 2:43:00.000]  Heroic people people that aren't mind-numbed and so you're gonna get a lot of the cool strange people
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  you're also gonna get a lot of the weird strange people and
[2:43:04.280 --> 2:43:06.360]  Everybody's strange, but you know what I mean the
[2:43:07.600 --> 2:43:12.400]  And so we have to focus our energies on warning people that the vaccines are poisonous
[2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:16.360]  Which the feds now have to admit the mercury's in them and it's causing that's now officially admitted
[2:43:16.360 --> 2:43:18.640]  That's now officially admitted. We won that fight
[2:43:19.480 --> 2:43:25.320]  We have to admit governments do stage terror attacks. We have to admit all of this is going on together
[2:43:26.200 --> 2:43:30.720]  We have to agree that we need to stop the North American Union for five minutes
[2:43:30.720 --> 2:43:33.960]  And even you know, and that doesn't mean changing the mind of the naysayers
[2:43:34.040 --> 2:43:38.400]  You don't have to then just repeat it and talk about it and spend all day on it
[2:43:39.080 --> 2:43:45.220]  Okay, and and frankly, you know, I'm here in a old converted auto repair shop. It's three rooms
[2:43:45.220 --> 2:43:51.500]  Doing my radio show. I'm wearing a black t-shirt with with the mustard stains on my jeans
[2:43:51.700 --> 2:43:56.100]  I'm here working hard fighting a new world order making films at night
[2:43:56.500 --> 2:44:02.340]  Wishing I could spend time with my family working hard. It's it's it's it's it's grease. It's elbow grease
[2:44:02.340 --> 2:44:06.740]  It's it's it's in there getting things done waking people up warning people
[2:44:06.780 --> 2:44:10.740]  That's why we're successful because we don't spend 90% of our time
[2:44:10.740 --> 2:44:19.740]  Nenying and backstabbing and ego mania trips. Okay, so you can go have your coop groups and go talk about how no planes at the
[2:44:19.740 --> 2:44:25.180]  Towers and don't worry the media will give you attention and you can go somewhere else and have your views. I'm not a devil
[2:44:25.180 --> 2:44:27.180]  I'm not bad. I don't need to be killed
[2:44:27.180 --> 2:44:33.300]  I don't need to go to prison because I won't agree with it like some of the people that are pushing and upset and
[2:44:33.660 --> 2:44:35.660]  They're all liars
[2:44:35.660 --> 2:44:40.620]  You know the people that say I cover up for Israel all lies all disinfo all propaganda
[2:44:41.020 --> 2:44:46.340]  Heard one of the cooks somebody sent me a clip saying Galen Ross is a Jew and covers up for Israel
[2:44:46.340 --> 2:44:52.260]  And the guy writes books about the Rothschilds and the Zionist and they go that's not enough. You didn't say Jews were evil
[2:44:52.260 --> 2:44:55.780]  I mean, it's it's sick. They move the gold post
[2:44:55.780 --> 2:45:00.500]  They always change it and they do that because they are convicted criminals
[2:45:00.500 --> 2:45:07.180]  That's why they call good men criminals because they're scum. They're cowards if they don't do it the feds will come pick them up
[2:45:07.900 --> 2:45:12.760]  That's the type of informants. They use as mentally ill people and drug addicts and criminals
[2:45:13.260 --> 2:45:18.820]  And we are a society of scum and trash now we become inbred we become lazy
[2:45:18.980 --> 2:45:24.940]  We become dumb we don't have discernment and it's time to get the discernment back. It's time
[2:45:24.940 --> 2:45:31.260]  It's time to get focused on real issues like explaining to you that it's a fourth of a violation to have cops put taking your
[2:45:31.260 --> 2:45:34.860]  blood on the side of the street and that it's federally funded so you can say no or
[2:45:36.100 --> 2:45:42.780]  Announcing and talking about how the oil price is going up because the dollar has been devalued so people know why it happened or
[2:45:43.300 --> 2:45:47.660]  Explaining to people about how there are thousands of young people all across the country
[2:45:48.100 --> 2:45:49.900]  And older folks as well
[2:45:49.900 --> 2:45:56.660]  Confronting politicians everywhere and it's freaking them out to where they're having congressional hearings with the homegrown extremist
[2:45:57.700 --> 2:46:01.860]  Act and they're about to pass that that's in the news today. I mean we're in deep trouble there
[2:46:02.260 --> 2:46:10.140]  And then they put up scholars for 9-11 truth or or architects and engineers for 9-11 truth and say it's the enemy
[2:46:10.500 --> 2:46:17.700]  Up on c-span with homeland security saying it and and that they want to use the homeland security against the web. I
[2:46:17.700 --> 2:46:22.700]  Mean we're having an effect. Why don't we talk about where we're having an effect?
[2:46:22.700 --> 2:46:24.620]  Why don't we challenge young people to get involved?
[2:46:24.780 --> 2:46:30.780]  We have hundreds of thousands of new listeners every day that tune in and they tune in and they hear you asking the questions
[2:46:30.900 --> 2:46:37.700]  They hear you taking advantage of the unscreened calls to call in and spew that bull and I take it and it's an educational process
[2:46:38.020 --> 2:46:42.300]  But imagine a new listen for their first time has no idea what we're talking about in fact
[2:46:42.300 --> 2:46:44.660]  I'm gonna cover news right now and then we'll go to let's go to London
[2:46:44.660 --> 2:46:47.860]  She's been holding too long Linda and Rhode Island. You're on the air
[2:46:49.140 --> 2:46:54.340]  Go ahead Linda. Hi, I tried to get a hold you about three weeks ago when you were talking about Mexico
[2:46:54.340 --> 2:46:58.620]  And since this morning you were talking about it too of this afternoon. I wanted to call
[2:46:58.620 --> 2:47:04.220]  I want to tell you here in Rhode Island as a young boy about 28 years old a friend of my sons
[2:47:04.340 --> 2:47:10.420]  Who went down to Mexico with thinking with a couple hundred thousand dollars and he has disappeared
[2:47:10.420 --> 2:47:16.340]  It hasn't been in the news or anything his parents. Nobody has heard from him. Yeah, I found his car in California
[2:47:16.540 --> 2:47:18.260]  In at least 15 towns
[2:47:18.260 --> 2:47:26.660]  They've dug up more than a hundred bodies in each town satanic sacrifices and the media to cover up their operations always acts like that's kooky Google it
[2:47:27.460 --> 2:47:29.460]  Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle
[2:47:30.420 --> 2:47:32.420]  San Antonio Express News
[2:47:32.420 --> 2:47:40.220]  Texas Monthly, I mean I grew up here. I've born here and I mean it's raping women killing stealing
[2:47:40.380 --> 2:47:46.940]  Dumb gringos go down there the cops will walk right up shoot you in the head throw you in a ditch bury you take your truck
[2:47:46.940 --> 2:47:50.780]  I mean, it's just and it's all about killing gringos. Oh, yeah
[2:47:50.780 --> 2:47:55.140]  And anybody that goes to northern Mexico is a psychopath. Yeah, you're out of your mind
[2:47:55.140 --> 2:48:00.460]  They're gonna kill you see he's a nice quiet kid and a trusting kid and I do want to kill them
[2:48:00.460 --> 2:48:04.260]  They killed him guaranteed listen my parents took me to Cancun one time
[2:48:04.540 --> 2:48:07.340]  And I was about 12 years old and it was in the early morning out
[2:48:07.340 --> 2:48:12.100]  You know just on the beach and I went out there and was swimming and I came back out and these two adults said hey
[2:48:12.100 --> 2:48:15.540]  Man, we got some we come over here with us and I could look at them till they wanted to kidnap me
[2:48:15.540 --> 2:48:21.220]  And then and then I saw in the paper while I was there warnings about people being kidnapped absolutely
[2:48:21.220 --> 2:48:24.700]  We're gonna live like third-world trash now. We're a nation of trash
[2:48:25.700 --> 2:48:27.940]  I'm sorry go ahead and another thing
[2:48:27.940 --> 2:48:33.900]  Um, you talk about you know the government brings drugs in which I totally agree. I've looked into it and
[2:48:34.660 --> 2:48:38.540]  One thing that happened to a friend of my son's back in the winter
[2:48:38.780 --> 2:48:42.540]  He went up to a drug house to get drugs and when he came down
[2:48:42.540 --> 2:48:46.140]  He drove down the road the cops went on him and I've heard this so many times
[2:48:46.140 --> 2:48:51.540]  You know they do not go after the people of course not of course not they're getting paid, right?
[2:48:51.540 --> 2:48:53.100]  But they want to get paid
[2:48:53.100 --> 2:48:58.500]  Picking you up and in sucking money out of you on the probation and they want to get paid their cut from the crack house
[2:48:58.500 --> 2:49:04.500]  Of course, I grew up with the cops dealing drugs around me and that's why I won't put up with their play their game anymore
[2:49:04.780 --> 2:49:06.740]  I'm not gonna play the illegal aliens game

[2:50:11.700 --> 2:50:14.700]  Well, you I am this to my am's down to Paul. It's a
[2:50:14.700 --> 2:50:20.460]  Neocon general calls for terror attacks in Iran. I mean, this is how sick it is
[2:50:21.020 --> 2:50:26.460]  Four years ago the White House admitted that they hired al-Qaeda al-Siyyeda
[2:50:26.780 --> 2:50:33.580]  The Wahhabis Saudi Arabia to attack Iran and to blow up police station schools water plants mosque
[2:50:35.660 --> 2:50:37.260]  And
[2:50:37.260 --> 2:50:41.660]  Then they say Iran is al-Qaeda. I mean, it's so evil
[2:50:41.660 --> 2:50:45.660]  And then and now they've called for it on Fox News
[2:50:48.860 --> 2:50:50.860]  It is a big idea a
[2:50:51.620 --> 2:50:54.180]  New-world order in the near future
[2:50:54.940 --> 2:50:56.940]  Earth is dominated by
[2:51:04.140 --> 2:51:06.460]  Thousands of years their dark order grew
[2:51:06.460 --> 2:51:14.540]  Now as they hail the birth of the new-world order their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand
[2:51:17.500 --> 2:51:22.540]  For the first time in history the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open

[2:51:49.820 --> 2:51:52.700]  Another untold story here it comes
[2:51:54.460 --> 2:51:57.260]  Another untold story here it comes
[2:51:57.260 --> 2:52:05.260]  Another untold story that you have not been told from another untoldstory.com
[2:52:08.780 --> 2:52:14.940]  This story comes from the greatest story book. So we know it's true though. It seems so untrue so incredible
[2:52:15.020 --> 2:52:17.020]  It seems science fictional
[2:52:17.260 --> 2:52:23.740]  It even goes beyond a seemingly science fictional story to that to that category of a horror story
[2:52:23.740 --> 2:52:33.980]  But as horrible as it was it was done done out of desperation by a mobile king who was fighting a desperate battle against three opposing kings
[2:52:34.700 --> 2:52:39.340]  It of course was long long ago that he did it and it did work
[2:52:40.060 --> 2:52:45.660]  The raging battle was going against him greatly and he was about to be overcome and overrun
[2:52:45.660 --> 2:52:52.940]  So he did it as horrible and difficult as it was to do and he did it in the open
[2:52:53.660 --> 2:52:56.380]  Upon the wall of the city for all to see
[2:52:57.420 --> 2:52:58.700]  It worked
[2:52:58.700 --> 2:53:01.740]  It caused the battle to turn and his enemy to flee
[2:53:02.620 --> 2:53:06.460]  This is how it is said in the greatest story book and I quote
[2:53:07.100 --> 2:53:13.420]  And there came great wrath against Israel and they departed from him and returned to their own land
[2:53:13.420 --> 2:53:15.820]  In quote. What did he do?

[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:40.880]  That they tell them iran's running al-qaeda attacks
[2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:43.440]  Isn't that true general betray us?

[2:57:07.600 --> 2:57:11.840]  You're not outraged that they staged terror attacks using al-qaeda and then say iran's al-qaeda

[3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:31.600]  I'm waiting on the edge of my seat for something from jim tucker and I was wondering if you had heard anything or I missed it

[3:05:00.480 --> 3:05:02.960]  For thousands of years their dark order grew
[3:05:03.680 --> 3:05:11.040]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand

[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:29.840]  But uh going back to selly castillo now to first get his take on what the houston chronicle and others are reporting
[3:09:30.160 --> 3:09:32.160]  Three years after he said it
[3:09:32.160 --> 3:09:34.720]  Uh several years after he reported that
[3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:36.880]  latin american
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:43.040]  Death squads have been rehired by the cia to go to iraq to kill people. Uh, that came out in the mainstream news
[3:09:43.280 --> 3:09:45.280]  So he just has incredible sources
[3:09:45.600 --> 3:09:48.320]  Uh, selly. Hey, have you seen the houston chronicle?
[3:09:48.880 --> 3:09:57.600]  Uh admitting that congress has admitted that the u.s. Is funding uh groups quote killing american citizens carrying out hits as quote far north as dallis
[3:09:57.600 --> 3:10:01.200]  Certainly, uh, I like I used to say it before that I had been uh
[3:10:01.600 --> 3:10:08.000]  Talking about this for quite a while and one of the reasons alex that I happened to know this because when I was working the gun shows and uh
[3:10:08.800 --> 3:10:14.320]  Uh, I had access to all kinds of walkers alive that came up here from the set us to uh, uh
[3:10:15.200 --> 3:10:16.560]  uh
[3:10:16.560 --> 3:10:18.000]  us
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:23.040]  Blackwater guys and and so forth that would come up to me and they would tell me that uh, they were trained the uh, the uh
[3:10:23.040 --> 3:10:28.080]  the uh, the the people that we trained down in central america the caipiris the
[3:10:28.800 --> 3:10:32.960]  Cintas in south america. They're all coming down here and working for the cartels now
[3:10:33.360 --> 3:10:38.080]  And it was part of a u.s. Government. Uh, we also had uh, I don't know if you recall
[3:10:38.560 --> 3:10:41.360]  We have 30 iraqi u.s. Iraqi veterans
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:47.920]  Uh, they went into monorail mexico and were involved in a big shootout and all 30 of them got whacked
[3:10:47.920 --> 3:10:53.760]  And they were all part of working for the paramilitary in the in the in the for the mexican army
[3:10:54.320 --> 3:10:58.320]  In monorail mexico, so that was happening and uh, you know, uh
[3:10:58.880 --> 3:11:02.880]  Those are 30 u.s. Veterans that uh, I never to be seen or found again
[3:11:03.920 --> 3:11:06.560]  Now let's be clear. Uh, what percentage?
[3:11:07.600 --> 3:11:09.600]  We've seen numbers as high as 85
[3:11:10.480 --> 3:11:16.400]  Of the cartels work with the big central banks chase manhattan city bank fellow reserve banks to launder it
[3:11:16.400 --> 3:11:18.400]  And are shipped in on ci aircraft
[3:11:18.800 --> 3:11:21.040]  Uh, do you think 80 plus percent is an accurate number?
[3:11:21.280 --> 3:11:27.040]  And then who are some of the cartels and smaller drug dealers that that are breaking up their monopoly that they're waging war on?
[3:11:27.040 --> 3:11:29.760]  Because from what I get from you and others and what the news is now admitting
[3:11:30.160 --> 3:11:36.320]  This is a cartel war with the u.s. Back just like they kill the communists fark in columbia because they're not paying the cut
[3:11:36.640 --> 3:11:41.200]  Explain that to listeners that there is a drug war, but it's only over who controls the drugs
[3:11:41.200 --> 3:11:46.160]  exactly and basically the uh, the the military came by and uh
[3:11:46.560 --> 3:11:53.280]  For the first time ever alex you got to remember that the mexican military have admitted that they do now have paramilitary people
[3:11:53.680 --> 3:12:03.200]  Which is part of uh, uh, some uh, uh, u.s. Uh, mercenaries and uh, uh, we even have the masat, uh, israeli
[3:12:03.520 --> 3:12:05.520]  Uh, uh, working with the uh
[3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:09.920]  With the uh, cartels and with the uh military uh paramilitary
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:13.840]  Oh, yeah, they're working right here in austin. Uh, the evidence is they're all killing citizens
[3:12:14.400 --> 3:12:21.120]  Exactly. They even had a camp north of uh, edinburgh, texas that were trained. Uh, we're training some of these people
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:26.640]  So not only were they training in the in the south side of the river, but on the north side of the river
[3:12:27.120 --> 3:12:30.160]  And uh, you know, and they have plenty of access to
[3:12:30.880 --> 3:12:36.400]  Uh, the m16s the u.s. Weapon that that's used in uh in in in our armies
[3:12:36.400 --> 3:12:40.400]  Uh, they have access to just about every major weapon there is
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:42.960]  Uh, that's being utilized now
[3:12:43.920 --> 3:12:49.280]  And and and they've also killed a lot of feds and a lot of local police. So the local police now
[3:12:49.680 --> 3:12:53.040]  Uh, are called to them and that's those that aren't on the payroll
[3:12:53.600 --> 3:12:59.520]  Exactly and not only that uh, alex, but they're also have uh during challenges
[3:12:59.520 --> 3:13:06.400]  inequities has reached to the highest level they have several uh members of the atf uh on their payroll
[3:13:06.480 --> 3:13:13.840]  They have a couple of fbi agents and they have a couple of uh several customs agents that that that've been working with them for many many years
[3:13:14.160 --> 3:13:19.680]  So their intelligence is is very up to great on it. You know, it's it's very high and it's very good and
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:26.400]  No, they know exactly who's doing what and and they're up to par with it now when you were all with us three years ago
[3:13:26.400 --> 3:13:31.440]  Uh, you you said when you said this at the time you said now they're going to come after me
[3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  Uh, because you trained a lot of these people
[3:13:34.560 --> 3:13:36.560]  You trained the death squads, you know as you
[3:13:37.360 --> 3:13:40.800]  Have admitted then it was too much for you to learn that they were shipping the drugs back
[3:13:41.200 --> 3:13:42.880]  Uh, and I guess they have come after you now
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:46.640]  We're going to talk about that in the second half of the interview, but a selly specifically
[3:13:47.200 --> 3:13:49.200]  Tell us about the death squads you trained
[3:13:49.680 --> 3:13:54.880]  And and from when I get from you and others and they admit they're doing hits as far north as indiana and other papers
[3:13:54.880 --> 3:14:01.360]  That have been said in the end of this. Houston Chronicle says killing people truck bombs in Dallas. The media keeps it real quiet though normally
[3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:07.280]  Uh, and this is the army of the new world order now is going to be mexican and other
[3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:09.920]  Central american paramilitaries
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:13.520]  And I want to be very clear about that and then go over some of your evidence for that
[3:14:13.840 --> 3:14:17.680]  And how you could report this three years before it came out mainstream news
[3:14:18.320 --> 3:14:19.440]  exactly
[3:14:19.440 --> 3:14:26.560]  Go ahead. Yeah, you know alex and and what happened is the kai bilis, uh, the uh, the apaclot out of salvador
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:29.120]  all those special forces units, uh
[3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:32.960]  That we trained, uh, basically are very vicious
[3:14:33.840 --> 3:14:37.280]  Individuals they're the ones to capitate the heads and the the arms and
[3:14:37.760 --> 3:14:41.200]  Manipulate the bodies and so forth something that you have never seen before
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:45.520]  In in in the drug war of the cartels and basically these people
[3:14:45.520 --> 3:14:50.400]  Uh, have no mercy. No remorse. No nothing and they are now coming across
[3:14:50.800 --> 3:14:54.320]  Uh, as a matter of fact alex three weeks ago the
[3:14:55.360 --> 3:15:01.200]  Venezuelan advisor that I work with down in salvador and Guatemala for uh six years
[3:15:01.680 --> 3:15:05.680]  He was finally and he worked for the cia. He was finally gunned down
[3:15:06.080 --> 3:15:08.880]  And and and his body riddled with bullets, uh
[3:15:09.440 --> 3:15:13.760]  Uh, three weeks ago in Guatemala because uh of his, uh
[3:15:13.760 --> 3:15:19.680]  Um, you know connections with training the death watch his his uh group that came in from Venezuela
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:22.480]  back in the 80s, uh
[3:15:22.560 --> 3:15:25.600]  Were instrumental in in training the death watch, uh
[3:15:26.480 --> 3:15:31.840]  And and myself with part of the uh, how were you involved because I mean explain where you were attached what you did
[3:15:31.840 --> 3:15:37.360]  I mean, I've seen all the photos of you on the helicopters and the news articles, but well, basically what I was alex
[3:15:37.600 --> 3:15:39.920]  I was the uh the advisor
[3:15:39.920 --> 3:15:43.360]  Uh to the uh watermelon military g2
[3:15:44.080 --> 3:15:48.720]  Uh, in other words the drug enforcement administration was it was I was the agent that was
[3:15:49.280 --> 3:15:51.760]  Liaison as they say with the cia
[3:15:52.480 --> 3:15:59.920]  And the and the death watch which was the watermelon counterintelligence unit and basically what we did was when there was no funding
[3:16:00.320 --> 3:16:02.320]  We used dea funds
[3:16:02.320 --> 3:16:09.680]  Um to train the people i'm talking about dr regalado. Uh, i'm talking about uh, um, uh, uh
[3:16:10.320 --> 3:16:13.280]  What's his name the guy that just passed away a couple years ago
[3:16:13.360 --> 3:16:18.080]  Who was the ahead of the death watch in salador and davis on major davis on
[3:16:18.560 --> 3:16:22.960]  Major davis on as he was known, uh all these people were part of the uh
[3:16:23.520 --> 3:16:25.520]  Of cia contractors, uh
[3:16:26.400 --> 3:16:28.400]  Uh assets as they call them now
[3:16:28.400 --> 3:16:33.680]  Uh, you know that that were part of the uh training of this and i'm talking about about
[3:16:34.160 --> 3:16:38.240]  Thousand or so uh death squads that that were trained down in central america
[3:16:38.640 --> 3:16:42.400]  And now they were all working down here in the cartels and they're working for the paramilitary
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:45.840]  They're working for everybody who they're hired guns basically that's what they are
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:49.120]  Now before it was even in central and south america newspapers
[3:16:49.120 --> 3:16:54.000]  You said almost four years ago here that they were going to send tens of thousands and already sent thousands
[3:16:54.000 --> 3:17:00.320]  Of death squad members and new recruits out of latin america to iraq and then it came out in the news years later
[3:17:00.400 --> 3:17:02.400]  How did you find out about that?
[3:17:02.480 --> 3:17:08.640]  well because i uh when they were actually coming down here i like uh, i was uh being contacted by uh
[3:17:09.280 --> 3:17:14.240]  by some of the sectors and some of the uh, uh of the cartels down there about
[3:17:14.960 --> 3:17:18.160]  The possibility of me training individuals down in mexico
[3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:23.520]  Now you said you believe they were really you said you believe they were really trying to set you up to kill you, right?
[3:17:23.520 --> 3:17:29.280]  well, exactly and and basically the they did the second best thing and was to incarcerate me now for
[3:17:29.680 --> 3:17:36.640]  For the rest of my life and uh, basically that's uh, you know when i said the word that they were atf agents
[3:17:37.200 --> 3:17:41.760]  Uh on their payroll. That's when when atf came after me because uh
[3:17:42.320 --> 3:17:48.640]  Uh of my my knowledge that i had uh my intelligence that i had gathered and they didn't want to be embarrassed
[3:17:48.640 --> 3:17:54.560]  So basically they came out after me so they could shut me down. Well, you have total credibility
[3:17:54.640 --> 3:17:56.640]  Not only your presidential awards
[3:17:56.720 --> 3:18:03.200]  You've got from reagan and bush and all the news articles the admissions and your congressional testimony and nightline and
[3:18:03.600 --> 3:18:05.600]  and and and pbs and uh
[3:18:06.160 --> 3:18:10.640]  And dateline mbc. I mean this is all documented. He's got a showtime special on right now

[3:18:16.160 --> 3:18:19.200]  That was going to happen and you said they were going to use them in the u.s
[3:18:19.520 --> 3:18:26.880]  Now who are these cartels they're fighting and is in and are the other cartels 20 of the heroin and cocaine or
[3:18:27.120 --> 3:18:29.840]  What's the power breakup uh from your intel?
[3:18:30.400 --> 3:18:35.920]  Well, my my intel tells me right now that the military is actually now starting to run the cartels
[3:18:36.480 --> 3:18:41.440]  Uh, that's why they came in down to the border and and they did the process of elimination thing
[3:18:41.440 --> 3:18:47.040]  And but yet there's a big the uh, there's cartels are real huge and you know when you take one sell out
[3:18:47.520 --> 3:18:51.120]  Another one comes in. Okay. Let me stop you. Let me stop you. We'll hold you over
[3:18:51.520 --> 3:18:54.240]  Uh past the 30 if you can because this is so important. I got another guy's coming on
[3:18:54.480 --> 3:18:59.200]  That's exactly what all the intel shows is they're now they used to just let the cartels bring it in
[3:18:59.520 --> 3:19:05.840]  Pay their cut and launder the money the u.s and mexican government are now taking full control of the drug war
[3:19:06.480 --> 3:19:08.480]  I mean of the drug business
[3:19:08.480 --> 3:19:12.240]  For themselves just getting rid of the middleman completely and
[3:19:12.880 --> 3:19:18.880]  They're also going to use it as a hitman force. Uh here domestically. Is that accurate? That's absolutely true
[3:19:21.600 --> 3:19:26.960]  Unbelievable stay there sell a castello. We'll give you his website too on the other uh side
[3:19:28.240 --> 3:19:30.240]  So there you have it
[3:19:30.320 --> 3:19:34.800]  And uh, I'll ask selling the other side bush doesn't want to just give Mexico 10 billion for the drug war now
[3:19:34.800 --> 3:19:40.480]  146 where is it seven you can google it billion to quote fight drugs
[3:19:40.560 --> 3:19:44.320]  That's really the buy-off to win the war to control the drugs

[3:23:50.240 --> 3:23:55.440]  I'll be with us a few minutes into the next segment and we got the guy that came up with the idea the original ron paul moneybomb joining us
[3:23:55.920 --> 3:23:58.000]  He's decided to do a moneybomb for info wars
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:08.000]  And you better know that every scent of it will go straight into the heart of the new world order like black arrows being shot into a dragon
[3:24:08.560 --> 3:24:11.520]  Because that's what I want. That's my goal
[3:24:12.480 --> 3:24:14.480]  Is to defeat these arrogant bastards
[3:24:15.360 --> 3:24:19.280]  So our country isn't a drug dealing cesspit of government scum
[3:24:19.280 --> 3:24:26.080]  Celica still American heroes in the line with us. Shelly, you heard make the point
[3:24:26.080 --> 3:24:30.960]  The bush wants to send 146 billion to quote fight the drug war. That's full war funding
[3:24:31.520 --> 3:24:36.320]  So I guess so they decided don't even have middlemen now break it down for us. Well, that's basically it
[3:24:36.640 --> 3:24:38.480]  remember that the
[3:24:38.480 --> 3:24:40.240]  You know the columbians
[3:24:40.240 --> 3:24:43.600]  were handling the whole thing from the very beginning to shipping and
[3:24:44.320 --> 3:24:47.280]  And receiving and so forth and now basically the mexicans have
[3:24:47.280 --> 3:24:49.280]  uh have got their own
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:54.880]  Codes on the on their packages and it's being run strictly by the military and the
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:25:00.800]  And the uh mercs down in down in mexico. So we do have a big change
[3:25:01.520 --> 3:25:03.520]  Uh of who's running the show now
[3:25:05.600 --> 3:25:11.680]  And they just killed the head of the farc. I mean richard grasso head of the new york stock exchange on roiders in 99 hugding
[3:25:11.680 --> 3:25:18.480]  There's a special u.s. Law where this is in mainstream news with where drug money can be laundered to the stock market
[3:25:18.800 --> 3:25:22.160]  But your kid can get caught with one ounce of marijuana. They go to prison
[3:25:22.640 --> 3:25:27.600]  Uh, and they finally killed the head of the farc who refused to pay his cut to him
[3:25:28.880 --> 3:25:35.200]  Exactly and that's been reported. I remember when uh, uh, the stock exchange went down to uh,
[3:25:36.160 --> 3:25:39.840]  to columbia and tried to get them to invest that money into their
[3:25:39.840 --> 3:25:40.800]  uh
[3:25:40.800 --> 3:25:43.920]  star brokers and so forth and and and basically uh
[3:25:44.560 --> 3:25:51.040]  Uh, you know, it's called the process of elimination. You know, they tried taking out the middleman now and just go straight to the uh
[3:25:51.840 --> 3:25:59.200]  To the source of the money and we know there's a lot of classified missions where they send in marines and army to kill people all over
[3:25:59.200 --> 3:26:05.440]  Latin america and really those are those are rival, uh drug gangs, aren't they exactly and and it's basically now
[3:26:05.680 --> 3:26:09.120]  You know with black water has gotten the approval not to go into mexico
[3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:15.840]  Uh, basically, uh, they're going to say that they're going to be training the soldiers and training the paramilitary
[3:26:16.240 --> 3:26:20.880]  But in fact, they're going to be used as assassin groups to go in and and take out
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:28.880]  You know anybody that's against the military and that's basically what's going on 146 billion in one year to mexico
[3:26:29.440 --> 3:26:35.520]  That is uh, about 20 of the iraq war funding. I mean, don't let people have a realize
[3:26:35.520 --> 3:26:38.880]  What do you think mexico is going to do with the money bush is going to give them?
[3:26:39.280 --> 3:26:45.680]  Well, they're not going to do anything because the enforcement on the drug war has never worked and there's a history to show that
[3:26:45.840 --> 3:26:49.680]  Well, no, they're going to use that money, aren't they to go knock out their competition, right? Exactly
[3:26:49.680 --> 3:26:54.080]  they're going to be buying weapons and and and all kinds of explosives from the military
[3:26:54.720 --> 3:26:56.720]  and and uh, you know, uh
[3:26:56.880 --> 3:27:01.280]  The guys the the freelancers are the ones that are going to be making the money and you've got to remember right now
[3:27:01.280 --> 3:27:08.480]  Here in in softex if we got more banks than we do circle case or whatever and and and you know, the banking system has
[3:27:09.040 --> 3:27:10.880]  Is building, you know
[3:27:10.880 --> 3:27:12.800]  Economic wise is terrible down here
[3:27:12.800 --> 3:27:16.400]  But yet we got a bank in every corner now by the way for folks that don't know
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:20.480]  That's because the drug dealers then put their money in a bank and then loan it out 10 times
[3:27:20.800 --> 3:27:24.800]  What's in there in fractional reserve banking here in austin there is literally
[3:27:24.800 --> 3:27:30.800]  Uh, you'll go to new out the middle know where and there'll be 15 banks just sitting there with no one visiting them
[3:27:31.120 --> 3:27:33.120]  Just exactly just just banks everywhere. Just
[3:27:34.240 --> 3:27:35.760]  Yeah, they're just
[3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:40.400]  Storing money and and and and one of the biggest banks here in texas called texas state bank
[3:27:40.880 --> 3:27:42.880]  has just been bought out by a
[3:27:42.880 --> 3:27:45.680]  Spanish bank that is tied to uh
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:48.480]  laundering operations by the CIA
[3:27:48.640 --> 3:27:53.040]  So, uh, there's a history to show that and that's tied in with all the austin officials
[3:27:53.040 --> 3:27:58.880]  Exactly who all have their own private banks. Absolutely. And now it's uh, it's tied in with uh,
[3:27:59.440 --> 3:28:00.640]  You know, it's been sold
[3:28:00.640 --> 3:28:06.160]  Uh, and the the bank out of uh, spain owns the bank at texas state bank now
[3:28:07.120 --> 3:28:11.600]  Man, it's incredible selly. It's like the corruption is just going wild right now
[3:28:11.920 --> 3:28:15.440]  Well, there's no checks or balances than anybody here with this administration
[3:28:15.440 --> 3:28:20.880]  They're basically doing whatever they want to do and uh, and they think they can walk in water
[3:28:20.880 --> 3:28:25.760]  And and I certainly hope that the if a new administration comes in that they'll put a stop there, but uh,
[3:28:26.400 --> 3:28:32.000]  You know, uh, we have more drugs a day alex than we did five years ago. So that's to tell you that
[3:28:32.880 --> 3:28:36.640]  um, there's no such animals that the the war on drugs and it's just a
[3:28:37.440 --> 3:28:41.600]  A big uh monopoly on on cornering the mark market on drugs and money
[3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:50.160]  Selly, well, where's it gonna end? I mean, I guess they'll just kill whoever they want. I guess we'll be
[3:28:50.720 --> 3:28:54.240]  I mean, they're already killing reporters and bombing and then the media keeps it quiet
[3:28:54.240 --> 3:28:57.360]  I guess we're just all gonna be third world slaves. What's gonna happen?
[3:28:57.600 --> 3:28:59.600]  Well, basically that's what's gonna happen alex
[3:29:00.160 --> 3:29:06.000]  You know, as we know one out of ten americans is incarcerated now and and that's gonna shoot down to five
[3:29:07.120 --> 3:29:09.120]  five to five one out of five
[3:29:09.120 --> 3:29:13.760]  And uh, you know, they're building more prisons there than they are schools and so forth and
[3:29:14.320 --> 3:29:17.600]  We have more drugs today in the elementary level than we ever have before
[3:29:18.080 --> 3:29:20.080]  Have you heard the latest you're gonna get
[3:29:20.320 --> 3:29:22.320]  10 years in prison for speeding now
[3:29:22.880 --> 3:29:30.320]  Stay there. We'll be right back with selly castello drug dealing government imprisoning all the good people with mindless idiot cops serving them
[3:29:30.320 --> 3:29:42.320]  We're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[3:29:47.920 --> 3:29:52.880]  I've been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem

[3:30:00.880 --> 3:30:07.120]  In the u.s. Commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months
[3:30:07.760 --> 3:30:14.560]  It's fall in the southern hemisphere and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether
[3:30:15.200 --> 3:30:16.800]  Remember our trade deficit
[3:30:16.800 --> 3:30:22.080]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price
[3:30:22.080 --> 3:30:28.480]  By late summer if not early fall it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law

[3:33:35.680 --> 3:33:38.080]  Because we need the old you
[3:33:38.080 --> 3:33:41.360]  Crazy old you
[3:33:41.360 --> 3:33:45.360]  Let me go crazy, crazy old you
[3:33:47.360 --> 3:33:51.360]  The love is the evening breeze touching the skin
[3:33:51.360 --> 3:33:55.360]  The jellies we've seen in the breeze in the wind
[3:33:55.360 --> 3:33:58.560]  The whisper that calls after you and the night

[3:34:14.560 --> 3:34:18.560]  Let's go ahead and go to Celica still in closing celly
[3:34:18.560 --> 3:34:24.560]  Give people your website. I didn't want to say you wanted to thank the listeners for the support they gave you
[3:34:24.560 --> 3:34:30.560]  And give us a brief update on where your court case is going with them setting you up
[3:34:30.560 --> 3:34:36.560]  Yeah, i just got i was selected for a jury selection for the 9th of June
[3:34:36.560 --> 3:34:42.560]  But we've asked for some files from Darren Contra and we got a continuance
[3:34:42.560 --> 3:34:46.560]  Or we're asking for a continuance instead of the 9th
[3:34:46.560 --> 3:34:48.560]  And basically go to powderburns.org
[3:34:48.560 --> 3:34:52.560]  If you guys still want to buy my books or donate some money
[3:34:52.560 --> 3:34:56.560]  Because i know times are hard and i have to have received some funds
[3:34:56.560 --> 3:35:00.560]  And a lot of prayers from a lot of people and i do certainly understand that
[3:35:00.560 --> 3:35:04.560]  Times are very hard, especially with the gas today and so forth
[3:35:04.560 --> 3:35:08.560]  But if you find that little extra change, i certainly would appreciate it
[3:35:08.560 --> 3:35:12.560]  I paid the attorney the returner that he was asking for
[3:35:12.560 --> 3:35:16.560]  And now i need to continue to pay him with
[3:35:16.560 --> 3:35:18.560]  And this lawyer comes highly recommended?
[3:35:18.560 --> 3:35:20.560]  Very highly recommended
[3:35:20.560 --> 3:35:30.560]  He's an attorney out of San Antonio Texas who has over 30 years of working with the federal
[3:35:30.560 --> 3:35:34.560]  And knows the procedures and so forth and he's a good journey
[3:35:34.560 --> 3:35:38.560]  Very well recommended by different people from all over the state that recommended this guy
[3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:42.560]  Well you have an incredible service record, the military, the police and for the feds
[3:35:42.560 --> 3:35:48.560]  And so i really hope that you're successful in defeating them on this petty gun charge
[3:35:48.560 --> 3:35:52.560]  And it also makes me sick how they spend millions of dollars on these charges on people
[3:35:52.560 --> 3:35:54.560]  All the real criminals run loose
[3:35:54.560 --> 3:35:56.560]  But anything else you want to add, Celica Stillo?
[3:35:56.560 --> 3:36:02.560]  If you guys are interested in emailing me at powderburns.prodigy.net
[3:36:02.560 --> 3:36:08.560]  I would certainly help speak to you or talk to you on exchange emails with you guys
[3:36:08.560 --> 3:36:10.560]  But like i said, i still got plenty of books
[3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:14.560]  If you guys are interested in purchasing powderburns cocaine
[3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:20.560]  Conscious in the drug war, you can email me or you can actually call me at 956-345-5770
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:24.560]  And when the book is sold out, that's it, how many you got left? A couple hundred?
[3:36:24.560 --> 3:36:28.560]  That's exactly what i got, about a couple hundred left
[3:36:28.560 --> 3:36:36.560]  And you know, i need the funds so if you buy them, you'll get a lot of copies
[3:36:36.560 --> 3:36:38.560]  It's an excellent book and aren't all those signed too?
[3:36:38.560 --> 3:36:42.560]  Yes sir, they're all autographed personally by me
[3:36:42.560 --> 3:36:45.560]  Well, fantastic, give them the website again
[3:36:45.560 --> 3:36:52.560]  It's powderburns.org or powderburns.prodigy.net
[3:36:52.560 --> 3:36:56.560]  You know, it's always shocking to me, Shelley, that we know the government brings in the drugs
[3:36:56.560 --> 3:37:02.560]  They're always getting caught, a plane just crashed with four tons, CIA rendition aircraft
[3:37:02.560 --> 3:37:06.560]  The blackout in our news about it, but it's all over the foreign press and admitted
[3:37:06.560 --> 3:37:11.560]  And the cops will still pull you over or have a checkpoint and want to search people's cars for drugs
[3:37:11.560 --> 3:37:14.560]  When you were a cop, did the cops know that the government shipped it in?
[3:37:14.560 --> 3:37:19.560]  Or was it not until you were in the DEA in the 80s and saw it at El Pongo?
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:22.560]  I mean, had you heard stories before?
[3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:29.560]  Yeah, yeah, for example, when I got pulled over with ATF and DPS, that trooper when ballistic
[3:37:29.560 --> 3:37:34.560]  Because when he saw my book, he said, you're a conspiracy theorist and he's shaking the book at my face
[3:37:34.560 --> 3:37:40.560]  And you know, saying, this is what you talk about the government, the government that you belong to
[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:45.560]  And so forth, and he was just going off, you know, and it basically, that's what it is
[3:37:45.560 --> 3:37:47.560]  This people are being trained
[3:37:47.560 --> 3:37:50.560]  What did you say to this bedwetting punk?
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:37:55.560]  You know, I said to him basically, in, you know, very simple words
[3:37:55.560 --> 3:37:58.560]  He says, what have you ever done for your government?
[3:37:58.560 --> 3:38:01.560]  I mean, when was the last time you exercised your constitutional rights?
[3:38:01.560 --> 3:38:04.560]  Whether it was a protest or something
[3:38:04.560 --> 3:38:06.560]  Oh, no, the police act like protest or evil
[3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:10.560]  I saw a protest out of Orlando against the Scientologist
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:13.560]  And I want to get them on regardless of which side of the fence you're on on that
[3:38:13.560 --> 3:38:19.560]  You know, the police come up and say, you can't protest, you can't have a sign, you can't walk down the sidewalk
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:22.560]  And the cops are just like monsters
[3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:28.560]  Yeah, I'm getting ready to get, believe it or not, I'm trying to get a whole bunch of veterans to go and protest
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:35.560]  I started a new organization now, it's called Support Veterans with PTSD, Don't Prosecute them
[3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:38.560]  I'm trying to get numbers of how many veterans have been arrested
[3:38:38.560 --> 3:38:42.560]  They'll probably arrest you saying you're not allowed, veterans aren't allowed to walk down the street
[3:38:42.560 --> 3:38:49.560]  If we come to this point in this country where our veterans who fought for this constitutional right are not allowed to protest
[3:38:49.560 --> 3:38:58.560]  Well, don't forget, they shot a bunch of them with machine guns for peaceably protesting, you know, for their bonus checks, decades after World War I
[3:38:58.560 --> 3:38:59.560]  Exactly, I remember that
[3:38:59.560 --> 3:39:02.560]  Yeah, it's not the first time they like to kill, I love to kill the veterans
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:07.560]  Yeah, they'll probably say, that's what you fight for in the military, so cops can tell you you have no right to walk down the street
[3:39:07.560 --> 3:39:14.560]  Silly, but I mean, to the average cop out there that doesn't know, I know all the detectives know, because most of them are involved in it
[3:39:14.560 --> 3:39:22.560]  And they're in vice, explain to them, what percentage of the drugs are laundered or shipped in directly by the government
[3:39:22.560 --> 3:39:30.560]  Well, very close to almost 100% of it, we go back, we started that crack epidemic, remember that Alex
[3:39:30.560 --> 3:39:32.560]  That's now classified, I know
[3:39:32.560 --> 3:39:43.560]  Yeah, exactly, and there's been a couple of bipartisan investigation, congressional investigations that have acknowledged that our government were complicit in drug traffic
[3:39:43.560 --> 3:39:49.560]  So do you think that state police guy, as he was flipping out on you in the stage staying for, you know, selling a gun illegally or whatever
[3:39:49.560 --> 3:39:58.560]  I think what he was trying to do was trying to get a job with ATF or something, but because he was really kissing up to their butt and I'm telling you
[3:39:58.560 --> 3:40:01.560]  You know, I'm very unprofessional
[3:40:01.560 --> 3:40:15.560]  So the six foot stack of horse dung was yelling at a true veteran, a Vietnam vet, a police officer, a DEA guy who went on all these raids and trained all these people and got shot at and the rest of it
[3:40:15.560 --> 3:40:22.560]  He's sitting there screaming at you, saying you're a conspiracy theorist, violating your first amendment, flipping out over your book
[3:40:22.560 --> 3:40:25.560]  Yeah, exactly, and what did you tell us?
[3:40:25.560 --> 3:40:38.560]  We have a guy who's a non-veteran who actually conspired against me, has not been arrested at all, not even indicted, and this guy is not even a veteran
[3:40:38.560 --> 3:40:43.560]  But I mean describe exactly what this DPS guy looked like, what he was doing and what you said to him
[3:40:43.560 --> 3:40:54.560]  He was about six foot tall and kind of heavy built, his partner was Anglo, a very professional individual
[3:40:54.560 --> 3:41:10.560]  But that Latino guy, and then they're the worst, you know, they tend to destroy their own people and just went off in front of everybody, you know, trying to make an impression on them that I was a conspiracy theorist because of the book that I've written and so forth
[3:41:10.560 --> 3:41:13.560]  Hey, you know, it's never read the book, so how can you...
[3:41:13.560 --> 3:41:15.560]  You've testified to the Congress about this
[3:41:15.560 --> 3:41:31.560]  Yeah, exactly, and he has no IDL or who I am, all he knew was that he was getting ready to arrest a former 20 year law enforcement officer, and that's to him was going to be a big trophy for his name
[3:41:31.560 --> 3:41:46.560]  So there we have guys, individuals like this who are brainwashed, they would think that everybody is a criminal, and that when in fact, you know, I've done more time in the criminal justice enforcement type than he ever will be
[3:41:46.560 --> 3:41:50.560]  All right, Sally, well, give us an update next week and God bless you
[3:41:50.560 --> 3:41:53.560]  Thank you Alex for having me, and God bless everybody
[3:41:53.560 --> 3:41:56.560]  Thank you, all right, I really appreciate him coming on with us
[3:41:56.560 --> 3:42:05.560]  It's Eric Nordstrom, and now Jesse Elder was the original jazz musician in New York where they had to have a money bomb
[3:42:05.560 --> 3:42:13.560]  Then he gave the idea to Eric Nordstrom, I think it's important historically to know this, who carried the ball, then Trevor Lyman, a marketing guy came along later and picked it up
[3:42:13.560 --> 3:42:20.560]  Well, here is Eric Nordstrom, he's the guy that first, you know, really made the initiation to set up the website to do the Ron Paul Money Bombs
[3:42:20.560 --> 3:42:32.560]  We promoted it here, the Ron Paul campaign told us on air without me soliciting that half the funds they got in the first half of their campaign was from this show, you, you, the listeners of this show
[3:42:32.560 --> 3:42:39.560]  Wow, Ron Paul raised tens of millions of dollars, that money was well spent educating the public about the New World Order of the Federal Reserve
[3:42:39.560 --> 3:42:46.560]  We know the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission meeting was very upset about the Ron Paul Revolution, it's ongoing
[3:42:46.560 --> 3:42:58.560]  And I just want us to toot our own horn here, I want to toot your horn, Eric, and to show you how out of the loop I am, last Wednesday I'm about to go on vacation and they go, have you seen this Ron Paul Money Bomb, this Alex Jones Money Bomb
[3:42:58.560 --> 3:43:02.560]  And I said, no, I said, what is it? And they said, well, it's the same guy that originally did it
[3:43:02.560 --> 3:43:09.560]  And I said, man, I don't know, and I said, you know, I know we're thinking about doing this lease and starting this TV show and doing all this
[3:43:09.560 --> 3:43:16.560]  This is the first time I've talked to him, I talked to him during the break just now and then this is the first time I'm talking to him, you know, today live on air
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:26.560]  So let me just ask him, A, why are you doing this money bomb? Why did you decide to do an Alex Jones Money Bomb? Eric, why are you doing this?
[3:43:26.560 --> 3:43:28.560]  Tim, can we bring Eric Nordstrom up?
[3:43:28.560 --> 3:43:29.560]  What's that, Alex?
[3:43:29.560 --> 3:43:35.560]  I'm sorry, Eric, Eric, can you tell people why you decided to do an Alex Jones Money Bomb?
[3:43:35.560 --> 3:43:46.560]  Well, essentially for the same reasons we wanted to do the Ron Paul Money Bombs, which is to educate the public, you know, Ron Paul's out there, he's trying to influence government and politics
[3:43:46.560 --> 3:43:56.560]  But you yourself, Alex, you know, there's all kinds of alternative media, you know, we can only really turn to you guys to see what the heck's really going on
[3:43:56.560 --> 3:44:05.560]  The mainstream media, we watch it, they cover various topics and most of the time it's probably true, but they hide a lot of things, a lot of things they don't cover
[3:44:05.560 --> 3:44:15.560]  Whereas organizations such as yours, you shine the light on everything, you leave nothing unturned, and I really do think that, you know, your organization there is kind of a lighthouse in the fog
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:23.560]  And it's almost serving as a spear to pierce the thin veil of propaganda that we all receive day in and day out from the news
[3:44:23.560 --> 3:44:32.560]  And I am somewhat of a blowhard, but the stuff I talk about is the truth, and in deep fog, you need a loud, ohhhh, I mean, you need a loud noise
[3:44:32.560 --> 3:44:33.560]  Sure
[3:44:33.560 --> 3:44:37.560]  We need to get attention, we need to capture the people's minds and imagination and unlock their minds
[3:44:37.560 --> 3:44:46.560]  Absolutely, you know, as far as the history of the Money Bomb goes, there was a fellow out in England, he wrote a book called The Money Space Bomb
[3:44:46.560 --> 3:44:58.560]  And the book was actually banned in England a while back, I want to say about 10 years ago, and the book actually had something to do with the fact that, you know, governments who have central banks tend to inflate their money
[3:44:58.560 --> 3:45:03.560]  And after a while their money system implodes, and they're why he called it the Money Bomb
[3:45:03.560 --> 3:45:05.560]  Okay, so that's where the name came from, go ahead
[3:45:05.560 --> 3:45:09.560]  Well, it didn't actually come from that, I actually found that out after I had gotten involved with Jesse Elder
[3:45:09.560 --> 3:45:20.560]  Now, Jesse Elder, he had an opt-in email address where people could send him an email asking, you know, to donate $25 a week to Ron Paul's campaign
[3:45:20.560 --> 3:45:26.560]  Soon after, a guy named James Sugra, he created a video called A Perfect Day
[3:45:26.560 --> 3:45:27.560]  Yeah, I saw that
[3:45:27.560 --> 3:45:37.560]  Yeah, his concept was for everybody to donate something on one single perfect day to kind of blast some money to Ron Paul to enable his campaign
[3:45:37.560 --> 3:45:46.560]  James Sugra actually contacted Jesse Elder to do up a Money Bomb for a day, and Jesse Elder agreed
[3:45:46.560 --> 3:45:55.560]  Soon after, Trevor Lyman also contacted James Sugra, and that's when Trevor Lyman put up this November 5th.com website
[3:45:55.560 --> 3:46:05.560]  Okay, let me find out on air with you now, are you, this isn't, has nothing to do though, this is what you're doing, is Trevor Lyman involved in this?
[3:46:05.560 --> 3:46:06.560]  No, he's not
[3:46:06.560 --> 3:46:07.560]  Okay
[3:46:07.560 --> 3:46:12.560]  I've tried to get him involved in a lot of the stuff that I've been doing, and I've never received an email from him
[3:46:12.560 --> 3:46:15.560]  No, no, that's fine, I'd rather, I mean, he's fine and dandy, but he's doing his own
[3:46:15.560 --> 3:46:20.560]  Well, we gave him our support, but that doesn't matter, let's just keep him separate
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:24.560]  I mean, I know I've done any strategizing with you, so we'll just do it out in the open here on air
[3:46:24.560 --> 3:46:25.560]  Yeah
[3:46:25.560 --> 3:46:30.560]  I mean, I pledge, you probably need to put this on the side, and I appreciate what you're doing
[3:46:30.560 --> 3:46:42.560]  I will spend 100% of the money on cameras, computers, a better office, and I'm just now moving anyways the next month or two
[3:46:42.560 --> 3:46:52.560]  And that, and to produce what you call freedom infomercials that wake people up, and it'll cause a self-replicating domino
[3:46:52.560 --> 3:46:57.560]  I just wasn't sure if I had the capital myself, because I don't focus enough on raising capital
[3:46:57.560 --> 3:47:01.560]  This comes at a perfect time when I was on my vacation, not for three days
[3:47:01.560 --> 3:47:05.560]  I was really thinking about, should I get a bigger office? Can I do this? Do I want the extra work?
[3:47:05.560 --> 3:47:10.560]  And I said, well, I'm going to do it, and I said, you know, God, just show me a sign
[3:47:10.560 --> 3:47:15.560]  And then the money bomb pops up, and I hadn't even talked about this really on air
[3:47:15.560 --> 3:47:17.560]  And so I think it is something that needs to happen
[3:47:17.560 --> 3:47:21.560]  What we'll do is we're going to have a PayPal account up there, and I'm going to have people here next
[3:47:21.560 --> 3:47:27.560]  On the 31st, two or three operators at my office where you can call with a credit card number, if you wish
[3:47:27.560 --> 3:47:31.560]  Or you can mail checks that will get here by the 31st or there around
[3:47:31.560 --> 3:47:40.560]  And I will give 100%, 100% into the organization to fund it, 100%
[3:47:40.560 --> 3:47:46.560]  None of it will go to me, it will all go to the infrastructure, to cameras, computers, and to developing
[3:47:46.560 --> 3:47:52.560]  I want to start a once a week, two hour TV show
[3:47:52.560 --> 3:47:56.560]  And I'd like to try to get that on Dish Network or something within three months of this happening
[3:47:56.560 --> 3:47:59.560]  And that will be breakneck, hard to do, in and of itself
[3:47:59.560 --> 3:48:06.560]  Then, within a month of doing the weekend show, I would try to start a 30 minute, everyday show
[3:48:06.560 --> 3:48:10.560]  Which takes a lot of work and fiber optic or satellite uplinks
[3:48:10.560 --> 3:48:14.560]  The air time isn't what's expensive, it's getting set up
[3:48:14.560 --> 3:48:17.560]  And then it can get really big on Dish Network or one of the others
[3:48:17.560 --> 3:48:20.560]  If we get a lower channel, it's more, a higher channel less
[3:48:20.560 --> 3:48:23.560]  I think we have the buzz and the people to grow it
[3:48:23.560 --> 3:48:27.560]  And then I would like to build that within a year into something like Democracy Now
[3:48:27.560 --> 3:48:31.560]  Which has a whole network, and is really becoming effective, but not liberal
[3:48:31.560 --> 3:48:35.560]  We're talking libertarian, patriotic, go ahead, sir
[3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:40.560]  Well, yeah, I mean, the whole thing is, you know, the only way to make a change is
[3:48:40.560 --> 3:48:44.560]  A lot of people like to throw that word around, but the only way to make a permanent
[3:48:44.560 --> 3:48:46.560]  World view change
[3:48:46.560 --> 3:48:49.560]  And what I mean by that is, you know, a lot of people in the states
[3:48:49.560 --> 3:48:54.560]  We kind of run our world based on a popular culture, a celebrity society
[3:48:54.560 --> 3:48:57.560]  Well, that's got to go away
[3:48:57.560 --> 3:49:02.560]  And we've got to try to remember that the bad guys out there are trying to divide and conquer us
[3:49:02.560 --> 3:49:05.560]  There is no us and them, it's just we
[3:49:05.560 --> 3:49:09.560]  You know, so we've got to basically support ourselves, we've got to get the word out
[3:49:09.560 --> 3:49:15.560]  And if we're going to do that, we've got to get into the mainstream celebrity universe
[3:49:15.560 --> 3:49:19.560]  Well, that's it, and we hear a lot of pipe dreams
[3:49:19.560 --> 3:49:24.560]  We hear a lot of other people who claim they're going to raise all this money and buy all these stations or do this or that
[3:49:24.560 --> 3:49:27.560]  I never talk big, I just do it
[3:49:27.560 --> 3:49:32.560]  And so the thing is, I'm going, if I'm going to really upgrade my office, really do a TV show
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:35.560]  Really start another network, a TV network
[3:49:35.560 --> 3:49:41.560]  I mean, I'm going to really try it, I mean, I'm really going to go 18 hours a day and cough up blood if I have to
[3:49:41.560 --> 3:49:44.560]  I mean, I'm going, I mean, I'm not going to start something and not do it
[3:49:44.560 --> 3:49:48.560]  And I've never, but the problem was is I don't like asking for the money
[3:49:48.560 --> 3:49:51.560]  I don't like making the money to do it, but I've got to do it
[3:49:51.560 --> 3:49:53.560]  And this money bomb comes at a perfect time
[3:49:53.560 --> 3:49:56.560]  I mean, when did you finally decide to do this?
[3:49:56.560 --> 3:50:02.560]  Oh, I flipped it around in my head, kind of probably for the same reasons that you were last week
[3:50:02.560 --> 3:50:05.560]  I mean, a money bomb is kind of a finicky thing
[3:50:05.560 --> 3:50:08.560]  It can either bomb good or it can bomb bad
[3:50:08.560 --> 3:50:14.560]  So whether to do it or not, you kind of have to gauge support and you have to gauge, well, are these people ready to do it?
[3:50:14.560 --> 3:50:19.560]  Are they serious about supporting someone? Are they serious about getting the word out?
[3:50:19.560 --> 3:50:22.560]  Are they serious about fighting the bad guys?
[3:50:22.560 --> 3:50:27.560]  You know, that's why I kind of decided, well, yeah, I think that people that listen to Alex Jones
[3:50:27.560 --> 3:50:32.560]  Well, most of them got a pair and I think that they're ready to actually do something
[3:50:32.560 --> 3:50:35.560]  Stay there, Eric Nordstrom, come back in the final five minutes
[3:50:35.560 --> 3:50:37.560]  Sorry about some of the calls, we're out of time
[3:50:37.560 --> 3:50:39.560]  Five minutes, we'll talk more about the money bomb
[3:50:39.560 --> 3:50:41.560]  infowarsmoneybomb.com
[3:50:41.560 --> 3:50:43.560]  Links to it up on infowars.com
[3:50:45.560 --> 3:50:49.560]  It is a big idea, a new world order
[3:50:49.560 --> 3:50:54.560]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government
[3:50:54.560 --> 3:50:57.560]  It's known as the Bilderberg
[3:50:57.560 --> 3:51:00.560]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:51:00.560 --> 3:51:03.560]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew
[3:51:03.560 --> 3:51:06.560]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order
[3:51:06.560 --> 3:51:11.560]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand
[3:51:13.560 --> 3:51:19.560]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open
[3:51:19.560 --> 3:51:23.560]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda
[3:51:23.560 --> 3:51:25.560]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward the world
[3:51:25.560 --> 3:51:27.560]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money
[3:51:27.560 --> 3:51:30.560]  They have all the money they need, they're after power

[3:51:44.560 --> 3:51:45.560]  Why should we fire Congress?
[3:51:45.560 --> 3:51:49.560]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper
[3:51:49.560 --> 3:51:51.560]  They swear an oath to follow it and then they reject it
[3:51:51.560 --> 3:51:54.560]  That was their employment document
[3:51:54.560 --> 3:51:55.560]  They haven't followed it

[3:52:24.560 --> 3:52:25.560]  Washington, you're fired
[3:52:25.560 --> 3:52:28.560]  Captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned Boston Tea Party
[3:52:28.560 --> 3:52:32.560]  Chem Williams describes the film as a rabble-rousing call to arms

[3:54:16.560 --> 3:54:24.560]  There's a lot of people that don't know what it's like to really work in this movement
[3:54:24.560 --> 3:54:28.560]  Well, who's the workaholic? Who's the maniac?

[3:54:42.560 --> 3:54:49.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to step it up a notch against the New World Order
[3:54:49.560 --> 3:54:53.560]  Go to infoawardsmoneybomb.com and pledge
[3:54:53.560 --> 3:54:59.560]  We're going to have a 1-800 number up there for you by next week to call the Money Bomb Day and a PayPal
[3:54:59.560 --> 3:55:04.560]  And if it's successful, we'll launch it in 3-4 months when we start a TV show
[3:55:04.560 --> 3:55:09.560]  We'll have another Bomb Indie Bomb to go to the next level and start the network
[3:55:09.560 --> 3:55:14.560]  And hell, we'll even publish the financials on it
[3:55:14.560 --> 3:55:17.560]  And you know me, I don't talk, I do it
[3:55:17.560 --> 3:55:21.560]  Because, and it's a lot of work folks, a lot of stuff we're facing to do this
[3:55:21.560 --> 3:55:23.560]  And people can say, oh, it won't work, you won't be the New World Order with that
[3:55:23.560 --> 3:55:25.560]  So what, we're taking action
[3:55:25.560 --> 3:55:29.560]  You know, I'm not here to talk, I'm here to take action
[3:55:29.560 --> 3:55:34.560]  Eric Nordstrom, really the critical guy that got the Money Bomb going and then Lyman and others picked it up
[3:55:34.560 --> 3:55:37.560]  Well, I'm glad you're doing this and I apologize, I haven't called you till now
[3:55:37.560 --> 3:55:41.560]  I was kind of apprehensive and we're just going to try to get more sponsors and raise more money
[3:55:41.560 --> 3:55:46.560]  However much it makes, or what is it, like close to $30,000 has been pledged
[3:55:46.560 --> 3:55:49.560]  And in your experience, because I haven't really talked to you guys
[3:55:49.560 --> 3:55:55.560]  But does it usually more money get given than what is pledged or what happens?
[3:55:55.560 --> 3:55:58.560]  It goes up and down, it's hard to tell
[3:55:58.560 --> 3:56:03.560]  And quite often, you'll have certain pledges or certain amount of pledges and then
[3:56:03.560 --> 3:56:08.560]  Whatever has been pledged, usually on the day of the actual donations
[3:56:08.560 --> 3:56:12.560]  More money winds up being poured in than what was advertised
[3:56:12.560 --> 3:56:16.560]  Okay, well, I better get off my hind end
[3:56:16.560 --> 3:56:19.560]  I mean, off my hind end, I've been working to midnight every night for the last few months
[3:56:19.560 --> 3:56:23.560]  But I'm going to get a phone number, I've got a bunch of phone numbers, but we'll get an easy number to call here
[3:56:23.560 --> 3:56:27.560]  I've got to get some extra people in this little hovel to try to answer the phone that day
[3:56:27.560 --> 3:56:31.560]  In case they shut down our PayPal, they play all kinds of games, so they can't stop us
[3:56:31.560 --> 3:56:35.560]  They've done that to a lot of other people, and we'll do it, and we'll try to confer with you
[3:56:35.560 --> 3:56:40.560]  And I'm just going to go with my main PayPal, we'll post that whenever you want
[3:56:40.560 --> 3:56:45.560]  And then we'll, the problem is setting up a new one, then they have a limited amount
[3:56:45.560 --> 3:56:48.560]  How much can be given to a new one, there's a lot of weird problems in this
[3:56:48.560 --> 3:56:50.560]  But we'll figure it all out in the next few days
[3:56:50.560 --> 3:56:55.560]  Alex, do I have a couple seconds? I just wanted to say something to the folks that are listening out there
[3:56:55.560 --> 3:56:57.560]  Yeah, go ahead. This is an info war
[3:56:57.560 --> 3:57:04.560]  And yeah, it's the name of a show, but it's also actually and truly an information war
[3:57:04.560 --> 3:57:09.560]  And if you dive into a little Sun Tzu, there's three primary powers
[3:57:09.560 --> 3:57:12.560]  There's knowledge, there's wealth, and then there's force
[3:57:12.560 --> 3:57:15.560]  You could always symbolize them as a sword, the treasure, and the scroll
[3:57:15.560 --> 3:57:20.560]  Interestingly, our government set up that way, the executive branch is the sword of the force
[3:57:20.560 --> 3:57:26.560]  Congress is the treasure, or the wealth, and the judicial branch is the scroll of the knowledge
[3:57:26.560 --> 3:57:31.560]  Basically, any one of these three forces can be used to obtain the other two
[3:57:31.560 --> 3:57:36.560]  Once you have all three, of course, then you're your god, your king
[3:57:36.560 --> 3:57:42.560]  But the key is, if you have a servant such as our government, you have to balance those powers
[3:57:42.560 --> 3:57:45.560]  You know what, I've been running over you, we're going into overdrive
[3:57:45.560 --> 3:57:48.560]  Overdrive, baby, stay there, okay?
[3:57:48.560 --> 3:57:51.560]  Eric, we're going to call you back on my local studio line, okay?
[3:57:51.560 --> 3:57:53.560]  You got his number, right?
